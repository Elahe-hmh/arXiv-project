including 170\npairings. All these absorption systems have metal lines, usually C IV or Mg II.\nWe see 17 cases of absorption in one line-of-sight within 200 km/s (1 Mpc) of\nabsorption in the paired line-of-sight with the probability at least approx 50%\nat 100kpc, declining rapidly to 23% at 100 - 200 kpc. We detect clustering on\n0.5Mpc scales and see a hint of the \"fingers of God\" redshift-space distortion.\nThe distribution matches absorbers arising in galaxies at z=2 with a normal\ncorrelation function and systematic infall velocities but unusually low random\npair-wise velocity differences. Absorption in gas flowing out from galaxies at\na mean velocity of 250 km/s would produce vastly more elongation than we see.\nThe UV absorption from fast winds that Adelberger et al. 2005 see in spectra of\nLBGs is not representative of the absorption that we see. Either the winds are\nconfined to LBGs, or they can not extend to 40 kpc with large velocities, while\ncontinuing to make UV absorption we see, implying most metals were in place in\nthe IGM long before z=2. Separately, when we examine the absorption seen when a\nsight line passes a second QSO, we see 19 absorbers within 400 km/s of the\npartner QSO. The probability of seeing absorption is approximately constant for\nimpact parameters 0.1 - 1.5 Mpc. Perhaps we do not see a rapid rise in the\nprobability at small impact parameters because the UV from QSOs destroys some\nabsorbers near to the QSOs. The 3D distribution of 64 absorbers around 313 QSOs\nis to first order isotropic, with just a hint of the anisotropy expected if the\nQSO UV emission is beamed, or alternatively QSOs might emit UV isotropically\nbut for a surprisingly short time of only 0.3Myr.\n", "  We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for states to have an\narbitrarily small uncertainty product of the azimuthal angle $\\phi $ and its\ncanonical moment $L_{z}$. We illustrate our results with analytical examples.\n", "  Given a discrete reversible dynamics, we can define a quantum dynamics, which\nacts on basis states like the classical one, but also allows for superpositions\nof them. It is a curious fact that in the quantum version, local changes in the\ninitial state, after a single dynamical step, can sometimes can be detected\nmuch farther away than classically. Here we show that this effect is no use for\ngenerating faster signals. In a run of many steps the quantum propagation\nneighborhood can only increase by a constant fringe, so there is no asymptotic\nincrease in speed.\n", "  Steady-state flow of an incompressible fluid in parallel pipes can\nsimultaneously satisfy two contradictory extremum principles in the entropy\nproduction, depending on the flow conditions. For a constant total flow rate,\nthe flow can satisfy (i) a pipe network minimum entropy production (MinEP)\nprinciple with respect to the flow rates, and (ii) the maximum entropy\nproduction (MaxEP) principle of Ziegler and Paltridge with respect to the\nchoice of flow regime. The first principle - different to but allied to that of\nPrigogine - arises from the stability of the steady state compared to\nnon-steady-state flows; it is proven for isothermal laminar and turbulent flows\nin parallel pipes with a constant power law exponent, but is otherwise invalid.\nThe second principle appears to be more fundamental, driving the formation of\nturbulent flow in single and parallel pipes at higher Reynolds numbers. For\nconstant head conditions, the flow can satisfy (i) a modified maximum entropy\nproduction (MaxEPMod) principle of \\v{Z}upanovi\\'c and co-workers with respect\nto the flow rates, and (ii) an inversion of the Ziegler-Paltridge MaxEP\nprinciple with respect to the flow regime. The interplay between these\nprinciples is demonstrated by examples.\n", "  We study thermal radiation outside equilibrium. The situation considered\nconsists of two bodies emitting photons at two different temperatures. We show\nthat the system evolves to a stationary state characterized by an energy\ncurrent which satisfies a Stefan-Boltzmann-like law expressing it as the\ndifference of the temperatures to the fourth power of the emitters . The\nresults obtained show how the classical laws governing the thermal radiation at\nequlibrium can be generalized away from equilibrium situations.\n", "  Position measurements are examined under the assumption that object position\nx_t and probe position X_t just after the measurement are expressed by a linear\ncombination of positions x_0 and X_0 just before the measurement. The\nHeisenberg uncertainty relation between the position uncertainty and momentum\ndisturbance holds when the measurement error \\epsilon(x_t) for the object\nposition x_t is adopted as the position uncertainty. However, the uncertainty\nin the measurement result obtained for x_0 is the standard deviation of the\nmeasurement result, and not the measurement error \\epsilon(x_0). This\ndifference is due to the reduction of a wave packet. The validity of the\nlinearity assumption is examined in detail.\n", "  Parton distributions in impact parameter space, which are obtained by Fourier\ntransforming GPDs, exhibit a significant deviation from axial symmetry when the\ntarget and/or quark are transversely polarized. Connections between this\ndeformation and transverse single-spin asymmetries as well as with quark-gluon\ncorrelations are discussed. The sign of transverse deformation of impact\nparameter dependent parton distributions in a transversely polarized target can\nbe related to the sign of the contribution from that quark flavor to the\nnucleon anomalous magnetic moment. Therefore, the signs of the Sivers function\nfor $u$ and $d$ quarks, as well as the signs of quark-gluon correlations\nembodied in the polarized structure function $g_2$ can be understood in terms\nof the proton and neutron anomalous magnetic moments.\n", "  We analyze a whispering gallery mode biosensor with a metallic nanorod bound\nto its surface. It is found that a localized surface plasmon resonance in the\nnanorod can reduce the optical mode volume of the resonator by as much as four\norders of magnitude via a local enhancement of the electric field, thus\nimproving the detection sensitivity. Optical frequency shifts as large as 15\nMHz are predicted for typical proteins and, for typical experimental\nparameters, the biosensor is predicted to be limited by laser frequency noise,\nleading to a minimum detectable polarizability on the order of 10 cubic\nangstroms.\n", "  The methodology for a heterodyned laser-induced transient thermal grating\ntechnique for non-contact, non-destructive measurements of thermal transport in\nopaque material is presented. Phase-controlled heterodyne detection allows us\nto isolate pure phase or amplitude transient grating signal contributions by\nvarying the relative phase between reference and probe beams. The phase grating\nsignal includes components associated with both transient reflectivity and\nsurface displacement whereas the amplitude grating contribution is governed by\ntransient reflectivity alone. By analyzing the latter with the two-dimensional\nthermal diffusion model, we extract the in-plane thermal diffusivity of the\nsample. Measurements on a 5 {\\mu}m thick single crystal PbTe film yielded\nexcellent agreement with the model over a range of grating periods from 1.6 to\n2.8 {\\mu}m. The measured thermal diffusivity of 1.3 \\times 10-6 m2/s was found\nto be slightly lower than the bulk value.\n", "  We present a purely wave model (based on classical random field) which\nreproduces quantum probabilities (given by the fundamental law of quantum\nmechanics, Born's rule) including probabilities for joint detection of a pair\nof quantum observables (e.g., spin or polarization projections). The crucial\npoint of our approach is that the presence of detector's threshold and\ncalibration procedure have to be treated not as simply experimental\ntechnicalities, but as the basic counteparts of the theoretical model. The\npresence of the background field (vacuum fluctuations) is also the key-element\nof our prequantum model. It is of the classical signal type and the methods of\nclassical signal theory (including statistical radiophysics) are used for its\ndevelopment. We stress that our prequantum model is not objective, i.e., the\nvalues of observables (clicks of detectors) cannot be assigned in advance,\ni.e., before measurement. Hence, the dilemma, nonobjectivity or nonlocality, is\nresolved in favor of nonobjectivity (our model is local of the classical field\ntype). In particular, we reproduce the probabilities for the EPR-experiment for\nphoton polarization and, hence, violate CHSH inequality for classical random\nsignals (measured by the threshold type and properly calibrated detectors\nacting in the presence of the background field).\n", "  Acausal behavior of solutions to free Salpeter equation is considered . It is\nshown that the formal properties of solutions suggest the acausal propagation\nof quantum phenomena. On the other hand the same properties of solutions\ndescribing macroscopic phenomena can be explained without appealing to the\nnotion of acausality.\n", "  On-line data assimilation techniques such as ensemble Kalman filters and\nparticle filters lose accuracy dramatically when presented with an unlikely\nobservation. Such an observation may be caused by an unusually large\nmeasurement error or reflect a rare fluctuation in the dynamics of the system.\nOver a long enough span of time it becomes likely that one or several of these\nevents will occur. Often they are signatures of the most interesting features\nof the underlying system and their prediction becomes the primary focus of the\ndata assimilation procedure. The Kuroshio or Black Current that runs along the\neastern coast of Japan is an example of such a system. It undergoes infrequent\nbut dramatic changes of state between a small meander during which the current\nremains close to the coast of Japan, and a large meander during which it bulges\naway from the coast. Because of the important role that the Kuroshio plays in\ndistributing heat and salinity in the surrounding region, prediction of these\ntransitions is of acute interest. Here we focus on a regime in which both the\nstochastic forcing on the system and the observational noise are small. In this\nsetting large deviation theory can be used to understand why standard filtering\nmethods fail and guide the design of the more effective data assimilation\ntechniques. Motivated by our analysis we propose several data assimilation\nstrategies capable of efficiently handling rare events such as the transitions\nof the Kuroshio. These techniques are tested on a model of the Kuroshio and\nshown to perform much better than standard filtering methods.\n", "  The implicit particle filter is a sequential Monte Carlo method for data\nassimilation that guides the particles to the high-probability regions via a\nsequence of steps that includes minimizations. We present a new and more\ngeneral derivation of this approach and extend the method to particle smoothing\nas well as to data assimilation for perfect models. We show that the\nminimizations required by implicit particle methods are similar to the ones one\nencounters in variational data assimilation and explore the connection of\nimplicit particle methods with variational data assimilation. In particular, we\nargue that existing variational codes can be converted into implicit particle\nmethods at a low cost, often yielding better estimates, that are also equipped\nwith quantitative measures of the uncertainty. A detailed example is presented.\n", "  Vibrating walls, used to maintain the temperature in a granular gas, modify\nthe system strongly. Most conspicuously, the usual one-peak velocity\ndistribution splits into two, asymmetrically positioned. A surgical repair of\nthe usual hydrodynamic description is presented that provides an account for,\nand an understanding of, the situation.\n", "  A radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulation for the black hole-torus system is\nperformed in the framework of full general relativity for the first time. A\ntruncated moment formalism is employed for a general relativistic neutrino\nradiation transport. Several systems in which the black hole mass is $M_{\\rm\nBH}=3$ or $6M_{\\odot}$, the black hole spin is zero, and the torus mass is\n$\\approx 0.14$--$0.38M_{\\odot}$ are evolved as models of the remnant formed\nafter the merger of binary neutron stars or black hole-neutron star binaries.\nThe equation of state and microphysics for the high-density and\nhigh-temperature matter are phenomenologically taken into account in a\nsemi-quantitative manner. It is found that the temperature in the inner region\nof the torus reaches $\\agt 10$ MeV which enhances a high luminosity of\nneutrinos $\\sim 10^{51}$ ergs/s for $M_{\\rm BH}=6M_{\\odot}$ and $\\sim 10^{52}$\nergs/s for $M_{\\rm BH}=3M_{\\odot}$. It is shown that neutrinos are likely to be\nemitted primarily toward the outward direction in the vicinity of the\nrotational axis and their energy density may be high enough to launch a\nlow-energy short gamma-ray burst via the neutrino-antineutrino\npair-annihilation process with the total energy deposition $\\sim\n10^{47}$--$10^{49}$ ergs. It is also shown in our model that for $M_{\\rm\nBH}=3M_{\\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity is larger than the electromagnetic\nluminosity while for $M_{\\rm BH}=6M_{\\odot}$, the neutrino luminosity is\ncomparable to or slightly smaller than the electromagnetic luminosity.\n", "  We present a way for fast implementation of a two-qubit controlled phase gate\nwith superconducting flux qubits coupled to a cavity. A distinct feature of\nthis proposal is that since only qubit-cavity resonant interaction and\nqubit-pulse resonant interaction are used, the gate can be performed much\nfaster when compared with the previous proposals. This proposal does not\nrequire adjustment of the qubit level spacings during the gate operation. In\naddition, neither uniformity in the qubit parameters nor exact placement of\nqubits in the cavity is needed by this proposal.\n", "  We present a way to realize a 3-qubit quantum controlled-phase gate with\nsuperconducting qubit systems coupled to a cavity. This proposal does not\nrequire adjustment of the qubit level spacings or identical qubit-cavity\ncoupling constants. Moreover, since only a resonant interaction is applied, the\ngate can be performed fast, within $\\sim $ 10 nanosecond. This proposal is\nquite general, which can be applied to various types of superconducting qubits,\natoms trapped in a cavity, or quantum dots coupled to a resonator.\n", "  Present article focuses on the interactions of 84 Kr 36 having kinetic energy\naround 1 GeV per nucleon with NIKFI BR2 nuclear emulsion detectors targets,\nthat can reveal important features of some compound multiplicity. The\nobservation showed that the width of the compound multiplicity distributions\nand value of the mean compound multiplicity have linear relation with the mass\nnumber of the projectile as well as colliding system.\n", "  The article focuses on the multiplicity distributions of shower particles and\ntarget fragments for the interaction of 84^Kr_36 possessing kinetic energy of\n~1 GeV per nucleon with NIKFI BR-2 Nuclear Emulsion target. The experimental\nmultiplicity distributions of shower particles, grey fragments, black\nfragments, and heavily ionization fragments are well described by the\nmulti-component Erlang distribution of the multi-source thermal model. We\nobserved a linear correlation in multiplicities for the above mentioned\nparticles or fragments. The further experimental studies showed that with the\nincrease of target fragment multiplicity, a saturation phenomenon was observed\nin shower particle multiplicity.\n", "  The present work studies the influence of nonlocal spatial coupling on the\nexistence of localized structures in 1-dimensional extended systems. We\nconsider systems described by a real field with a nonlocal coupling that has a\nlinear dependence on the field. Leveraging spatial dynamics we provide a\ngeneral framework to understand the effect of the nonlocality on the shape of\nthe fronts connecting two stable states. In particular we show that non local\nterms can induce spatial oscillations in the front tails, allowing for the\ncreation of localized structures, emerging from pinning between two fronts. In\nparameter space the region where fronts are oscillatory is limited by three\ntransitions: the modulational instability of the homogeneous state, the\nBelyakov-Devaney transition in which monotonic fronts acquire spatial\noscillations with infinite wavelength, and a crossover in which monotonically\ndecaying fronts develop oscillations with a finite wavelength. We show how\nthese transitions are organized by codimension 2 and 3 point s and illustrate\nhow by changing the parameters of the nonlocal coupling it is possible to bring\nthe system into the region where localized structures can be formed.\n", "  We study the influence of a linear nonlocal spatial coupling on the\ninteraction of fronts connecting two equivalent stable states in the\nprototypical 1-D real Ginzburg-Landau equation. While for local coupling the\nfronts are always monotonic and therefore the dynamical behavior leads to\ncoarsening and the annihilation of pairs of fronts, nonlocal terms can induce\nspatial oscillations in the front, allowing for the creation of localized\nstructures, emerging from pinning between two fronts. We show this for three\ndifferent nonlocal influence kernels. The first two, mod-exponential and\nGaussian, are positive-definite and decay exponentially or faster, while the\nthird one, a Mexican-hat kernel, is not positive definite.\n", "  Topological insulators are a new class of materials, that exhibit robust\ngapless surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry. The interplay\nbetween such symmetry-protected topological surface states and symmetry-broken\nstates (e.g. superconductivity) provides a platform for exploring novel quantum\nphenomena and new functionalities, such as 1D chiral or helical gapless\nMajorana fermions, and Majorana zero modes which may find application in\nfault-tolerant quantum computation. Inducing superconductivity on topological\nsurface states is a prerequisite for their experimental realization. Here by\ngrowing high quality topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films on a d-wave\nsuperconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ using molecular beam epitaxy,\nwe are able to induce high temperature superconductivity on the surface states\nof Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films with a large pairing gap up to 15 meV. Interestingly,\ndistinct from the d-wave pairing of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$, the\nproximity-induced gap on the surface states is nearly isotropic and consistent\nwith predominant s-wave pairing as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy. Our work could provide a critical step toward the realization of\nthe long sought-after Majorana zero modes.\n", "  A quantum simulator based on ultracold optically trapped atoms for simulating\nthe physics of atoms and molecules in ultrashort intense laser fields is\nintroduced. The slowing down by about 13 orders of magnitude allows to watch in\nslow motion the tunneling and recollision processes that form the heart of\nattosecond science. The extreme flexibility of the simulator promises a deeper\nunderstanding of strong-field physics, especially for many-body systems beyond\nthe reach of classical computers. The quantum simulator can experimentally\nstraightforwardly be realized and is shown to recover the ionization\ncharacteristics of atoms in the different regimes of laser-matter interaction.\n", "  In this paper, the perihelion precession and deflection of light have been\ninvestigated in the 4-dimensional general spherically symmetric spacetime, and\nthe main equation is obtained. As the application of this main equation, the\nReissner-Nordstorm-AdS solution and Clifton-Barrow solution in $f(R)$ gravity\nhave been taken for the examples. We find that both the electric charge and\n$f(R)$ gravity can affect the perihelion precession and deflection of light,\nwhile the cosmological constant can only effect the perihelion precession.\nMoreover, we clarify a subtlety in the deflection of light in the solar system\nthat the possible sun's electric charge is usually used to interpret the gap\nbetween the experiment data and theoretical result. However, after also\nconsidering the effect from the sun's same electric charge on the perihelion\nprecession of Mercury, we can find that it is not the truth.\n", "  In this paper, we have investigated Bianchi type VIh, II and III cosmological\nmodel with wet dark fluid in scale invariant theory of gravity, where the\nmatter field is in the form of perfect fluid and with a time dependent gauge\nfunction (Dirac gauge). A non-singular model for the universe filled with\ndisorder radiation is constructed and some physical behaviors of the model are\nstudied for the feasible VIh (h = 1) space-time.\n", "  We present 5.5 and 9.0 GHz observations of a sample of seventeen GRB host\ngalaxies at 0.5<z<1.4, using the radio continuum to explore their star\nformation properties in the context of the small but growing sample of galaxies\nwith similar observations. Four sources are detected, one of those (GRB\n100418A) likely due to lingering afterglow emission. We suggest that the\npreviously-reported radio afterglow of GRB 100621A may instead be due to host\ngalaxy flux. We see no strong evidence for redshift evolution in the typical\nstar formation rate of GRB hosts, but note that the fraction of `dark' bursts\nwith detections is higher than would be expected given constraints on the more\ntypical long GRB population. We also determine the average radio-derived star\nformation rates of core collapse supernovae at comparable redshift, and show\nthat these are still well below the limits obtained for GRB hosts, and show\nevidence for a rise in typical star formation rate with redshift in supernova\nhosts.\n", "  We describe a family of lattice models that support a new class of quantum\nmagnetism characterized by correlated spin and bosonic ordering [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 112, 180405 (2014)]. We explore the full phase diagram of the model using\nMatrix-Product-State methods. Guided by these numerical results, we describe a\nmodified variational ansatz to improve our analytic description of the\ngroundstate at low boson frequencies. Additionally, we introduce an\nexperimental protocol capable of inferring the low-energy excitations of the\nsystem by means of Fano scattering spectroscopy. Finally, we discuss the\nimplementation and characterization of this model with current circuit-QED\ntechnology.\n", "  In Ref. [Parra-Rivas at al., 2013], using the Swift-Hohenberg equation, we\nintroduced a mechanism that allows to generate oscillatory and excitable\nsoliton dynamics. This mechanism was based on a competition between a pinning\nforce at inhomogeneities and a pulling force due to drift. Here, we study the\neffect of such inhomogeneities and drift on temporal solitons and Kerr\nfrequency combs in fiber cavities and microresonators, described by the\nLugiato-Lefever equation with periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate that\nfor low values of the frequency detuning the competition between\ninhomogeneities and drift leads to similar dynamics at the defect location,\nconfirming the generality of the mechanism. The intrinsic periodic nature of\nring cavities and microresonators introduces, however, some interesting\ndifferences in the final global states. For higher values of the detuning we\nobserve that the dynamics is no longer described by the same mechanism and it\nis considerably more complex.\n", "  We solve the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints of general relativity for\ntwo black holes with nearly extremal spins and relativistic boosts in the\npuncture formalism. We use a non-conformally-flat ansatz with an attenuated\nsuperposition of two Lorentz-boosted, conformally Kerr or conformally\nSchwarzschild 3-metrics and their corresponding extrinsic curvatures. We\ncompare evolutions of these data with the standard Bowen-York conformally flat\nansatz (technically limited to intrinsic spins $\\chi=S/M^2_{\\text{ADM}}=0.928$\nand boosts $P/M_{\\text{ADM}}=0.897$), finding, typically, an order of magnitude\nsmaller burst of spurious radiation and agreement with inspiral and merger. As\na first case study, we evolve two equal-mass black holes from rest with an\ninitial separation of $d=12M$ and spins $\\chi_i=S_i/m_i^2=0.99$, compute the\nwaveforms produced by the collision, the energy and angular momentum radiated,\nand the recoil of the final remnant black hole. We find that the black-hole\ntrajectories curve at close separations, leading to the radiation of angular\nmomentum. We also study orbiting nonspinning and moderate-spin black-hole\nbinaries and compare these with standard Bowen-York data. We find a substantial\nreduction in the nonphysical initial burst of radiation which leads to cleaner\nwaveforms. Finally, we study the case of orbiting binary black-hole systems\nwith spin magnitude $\\chi_i=0.95$ in an aligned configuration and compare\nwaveform and final remnant results with those of the SXS Collaboration, finding\nexcellent agreement. This represents the first moving punctures evolution of\norbiting and spinning black holes exceeding the Bowen-York limit. Finally, we\nstudy different choices of the initial lapse and lapse evolution equation in\nthe moving punctures approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the\nsimulations.\n", "  We review and supplement the recent result by the authors on the reduction of\nthe three dimensional $R$ (3d $R$) satisfying the tetrahedron equation to the\nquantum $R$ matrices for the $q$-oscillator representations of\n$U_q(D^{(2)}_{n+1})$, $U_q(A^{(2)}_{2n})$ and $U_q(C^{(1)}_{n})$. A new formula\nfor the 3d $R$ and a quantum $R$ matrix for $n=1$ are presented and a proof of\nthe irreducibility of the tensor product of the $q$-oscillator representations\nis detailed.\n", "  We discuss a precise relation between the Veneziano amplitude of string\ntheory, rewritten in terms of ratios of the Riemann zeta function, and two\nelementary criteria for the Riemann hypothesis formulated in terms of integrals\nof the logarithm and the argument of the zeta function. We also discuss how the\nintegral criterion based on the argument of the Riemann zeta function relates\nto the Li criterion for the Riemann hypothesis. We provide a new generalization\nof this integral criterion. Finally, we comment on the physical interpretation\nof our recasting of the Riemann hypothesis in terms of the Veneziano amplitude.\n", "  We provide a complete solution to hydrodynamic transport at all orders in the\ngradient expansion compatible with the second law constraint. The key new\ningredient we introduce is the notion of adiabaticity, which allows us to take\nhydrodynamics off-shell. Adiabatic fluids are such that off-shell dynamics of\nthe fluid compensates for entropy production. The space of adiabatic fluids is\nquite rich, and admits a decomposition into seven distinct classes. Together\nwith the dissipative class this establishes the eightfold way of hydrodynamic\ntransport. Furthermore, recent results guarantee that dissipative terms beyond\nleading order in the gradient expansion are agnostic of the second law. While\nthis completes a transport taxonomy, we go on to argue for a new symmetry\nprinciple, an Abelian gauge invariance that guarantees adiabaticity in\nhydrodynamics. We suggest that this symmetry is the macroscopic manifestation\nof the microscopic KMS invariance. We demonstrate its utility by explicitly\nconstructing effective actions for adiabatic transport. The theory of adiabatic\nfluids, we speculate, provides a useful starting point for a new framework to\ndescribe non-equilibrium dynamics, wherein dissipative effects arise by\nHiggsing the Abelian symmetry.\n", "  An alternative class of the Lagrangian called the multiplicative form is suc-\ncessfully derived for a system with one degree of freedom for both\nnon-relativistic and relativistic cases. This new Lagrangian can be considered\nas a 1-parameter: {\\lambda} extended class from the standard additive form of\nthe Lagrangian since both yield the same equation of motion. Remarkably, the\nmultiplicative form of the Lagrangian could be treated as a generating function\nto produce an infinite hierar- chy of Lagrangians which give the same equation\nof motion. This nontrivial set of Lagrangians confirms that indeed Lagrange\nfunction is not unique.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties of heat engines\nbased on Mach-Zehnder interferometers. The energy dependence of the\ntransmission amplitudes in such setups arises from a difference in the\ninterferometer arm lengths. Any thermoelectric response is thus of purely\nquantum mechanical origin. In addition to an experimentally established\nthree-terminal setup, we also consider a two-terminal geometry as well as a\nfour-terminal setup consisting of two interferometers. We find that\nMach-Zehnder interferometers can be used as powerful and efficient heat engines\nwhich perform well under realistic conditions.\n", "  A central extension of the loop group of a Lie group is called transgressive,\nif it corresponds under transgression to a degree four class in the cohomology\nof the classifying space of the Lie group. Transgressive loop group extensions\nare those that can be explored by finite-dimensional, higher-categorical\ngeometry over the Lie group. We show how transgressive central extensions can\nbe characterized in a loop-group theoretical way, in terms of loop fusion and\nthin homotopy equivariance.\n", "  The conventional gravitational memory effect is a relative displacement in\nthe position of two detectors induced by radiative energy flux. We find a new\ntype of gravitational `spin memory' in which beams on clockwise and\ncounterclockwise orbits acquire a relative delay induced by radiative angular\nmomentum flux. It has recently been shown that the displacement memory formula\nis a Fourier transform in time of Weinberg's soft graviton theorem. Here we see\nthat the spin memory formula is a Fourier transform in time of the\nrecently-discovered subleading soft graviton theorem.\n", "  The interaction between magnetic impurities and the gapless surface state is\nof critical importance for realizing novel quantum phenomena and new\nfunctionalities in topological insulators. By combining angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopic experiments with density functional theory\ncalculations, we show that surface deposition of Cr atoms on Bi$_2$Se$_3$ does\nnot lead to gap opening of the surface state at the Dirac point, indicating the\nabsence of long-range out-of-plane ferromagnetism down to our measurement\ntemperature of 15 K. This is in sharp contrast to bulk Cr doping, and the\norigin is attributed to different Cr occupation sites. These results highlight\nthe importance of nanoscale configuration of doped magnetic impurities in\ndetermining the electronic and magnetic properties of topological insulators.\n", "  There is great interest in designing photonic devices capable of\ndisorder-resistant transport and information processing. In this work we\npropose to exploit 3D integrated photonic circuits in order to realize 2D\ndiscrete-time quantum walks in a background synthetic gauge field. The gauge\nfields are generated by introducing the appropriate phase shifts between\nwaveguides. Polarization-independent phase shifts lead to an Abelian or\nmagnetic field, a case we describe in detail. We find that, in the disordered\ncase, the magnetic field enhances transport due to the presence of\ntopologically protected chiral edge states which do not localize.\nPolarization-dependent phase shifts lead to effective non-Abelian gauge fields,\nwhich could be adopted to realize Rashba-like quantum walks with spin-orbit\ncoupling. Our work introduces a flexible platform for the experimental study of\nmulti-particle quantum walks in the presence of synthetic gauge fields, which\npaves the way towards topologically robust transport of many-body states of\nphotons.\n", "  This paper is devoted mainly to mathematical aspects of modeling and\nsimulation of tunnel relaxation of nonequilibrium charged oxide traps located\nat/near the interface insulator - conductive channel, for instance in\nirradiated MOS devices. The generic form of the tunnel annealing response\nfunction was derived from the rate equation for the charged defect buildup and\nannealing as a linear superposition of the responses of different defects with\ndifferent time constants. Using this linear response function, a number of\nimportant practical problems are analyzed and discussed. Combined tunnel and\nthermal or RICN annealing, power-like temporal relaxation after a single ion\nstrike into the gate oxide, are described in context of general approach.\n", "  Among the most popular and well studied quantum characterization,\nverification and validation techniques is randomized benchmarking (RB), an\nimportant statistical tool used to characterize the performance of physical\nlogic operations useful in quantum information processing. In this work we\nprovide a detailed mathematical treatment of the effect of temporal noise\ncorrelations on the outcomes of RB protocols. We provide a fully analytic\nframework capturing the accumulation of error in RB expressed in terms of a\nthree-dimensional random walk in \"Pauli space.\" Using this framework we derive\nthe probability density function describing RB outcomes (averaged over noise)\nfor both Markovian and correlated errors, which we show is generally described\nby a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters depending on the\ncorrelation structure. Long temporal correlations impart large nonvanishing\nvariance and skew in the distribution towards high-fidelity outcomes --\nconsistent with existing experimental data -- highlighting potential\nfinite-sampling pitfalls and the divergence of the mean RB outcome from\nworst-case errors in the presence of noise correlations. We use the\nFilter-transfer function formalism to reveal the underlying reason for these\ndifferences in terms of effective coherent averaging of correlated errors in\ncertain random sequences. We conclude by commenting on the impact of these\ncalculations on the utility of single-metric approaches to quantum\ncharacterization, verification, and validation.\n", "  We study renormalization group flows in strongly interacting field theories\nwith fermions that correspond to transitions between a theory without Lorentz\ninvariance at high energies down to a theory with approximate Lorentz symmetry\nin the infrared. Holographic description of the strong coupling is used. The\nemphasis is made on emergence of chiral fermions in the low-energy theory.\n", "  We consider the calibration of an optical quantum gyroscope by modeling two\nSagnac interferometers, mounted approximately at right angles to each other.\nReliable operation requires that we know the angle between the interferometers\nwith high precision, and we show that a procedure akin to multi-position\ntesting in inertial navigation systems can be generalized to the case of\nquantum interferometry. We find that while entanglement is a key resource\nwithin an individual Sagnac interferometer, its presence between the\ninterferometers is a far more complicated story. The optimum level of\nentanglement depends strongly on the sought parameter values, and small but\nsignificant improvements may be gained from choosing states with the optimal\namount of entanglement between the interferometers.\n", "  We consider a bottom-up holographic model of QCD at finite temperature T and\nmagnetic field B, and study dependence of thermodynamics and CP-odd transport\non these variables. As the magnetic field couples to the flavor sector only,\none should take the Veneziano limit where the number of flavors and colors are\nlarge while their ratio is kept fixed. We investigate the corresponding\nholographic background in the approximation where the ratio of flavors to\ncolors is finite but small. We demonstrate that B-dependence of the entropy of\nQCD is in qualitative agreement with the recent lattice studies. Finally we\nstudy the CP-odd transport properties of this system. In particular, we\ndetermine the Chern-Simons decay rate at finite B and T, that is an important\ningredient in the Chiral Magnetic Effect.\n", "  Analytic solutions to low-energy string theory, which describe arbitrary\nnumbers of extreme `black holes (strings)' in linear dilaton vacua, are found.\n", "  We present two minimal extensions of the standard model, each giving rise to\nbaryogenesis. They include heavy color-triplet scalars interacting with a light\nMajorana fermion that can be the dark matter (DM) candidate. The electroweak\ncharges of the new scalars govern their couplings to quarks of different\nchirality, which leads to different collider signals. These models predict\nmonotop events at the LHC and the energy spectrum of decay products of highly\npolarized top quarks can be used to establish the chiral nature of the\ninteractions involving the heavy scalars and the DM. Detailed simulation of\nsignal and standard model background events is performed, showing that top\nquark chirality can be distinguished in hadronic and leptonic decays of the top\nquarks.\n", "  Conformal field theory has turned out to be a powerful tool to derive\ntwo-dimensional lattice models displaying fractional quantum Hall physics. So\nfar most of the work has been for lattices with open boundary conditions in at\nleast one of the two directions, but it is desirable to also be able to handle\nthe case of periodic boundary conditions. Here, we take steps in this direction\nby deriving analytical expressions for a family of conformal field theory\nstates on the torus that is closely related to the family of bosonic and\nfermionic Laughlin states. We compute how the states transform when a particle\nis moved around the torus and when the states are translated or rotated, and we\nprovide numerical evidence in particular cases that the states become\northonormal up to a common factor for large lattices. We use these results to\nfind the S-matrix of the states, which turns out to be the same as for the\ncontinuum Laughlin states. Finally, we show that when the states are defined on\na square lattice with suitable lattice spacing they practically coincide with\nthe Laughlin states restricted to a lattice.\n", "  We discuss a possibility that baryon number $B$ is spontaneously broken at\nlow scales, of the order of MeV or even smaller, so that the\nneutron-antineutron oscillation can be induced at the experimentally accessible\nlevel. An associated Goldstone particle, baryonic majoron, can have observable\neffects in neutron to antineutron transitions in nuclei or dense nuclear\nmatter. By extending baryon number to $B-L$ symmetry, baryo-majoron can be\nidentified with the ordinary majoron associated with the spontaneous breaking\nof lepton number, with interesting implications for neutrinoless $2\\beta$ becay\nwith the majoron emission, etc. We also discuss a hypothesis suggesting that\nbaryon number maybe spontaneously broken by the QCD itself via the six-quark\ncondensates.\n", "  We performed ultrafast time-resolved near-infrared pump, resonant soft X-ray\ndiffraction probe measurements to investigate the coupling between the\nphotoexcited electronic system and the spin cycloid magnetic order in\nmultiferroic TbMnO3 at low temperatures. We observe melting of the long range\nantiferromagnetic order at low excitation fluences with a decay time constant\nof 22.3 +- 1.1 ps, which is much slower than the ~1 ps melting times previously\nobserved in other systems. To explain the data we propose a simple model of the\nmelting process where the pump laser pulse directly excites the electronic\nsystem, which then leads to an increase in the effective temperature of the\nspin system via a slower relaxation mechanism. Despite this apparent increase\nin the effective spin temperature, we do not observe changes in the wavevector\nq of the antiferromagnetic spin order that would typically correlate with an\nincrease in temperature under equilibrium conditions. We suggest that this\nbehavior results from the extremely low magnon group velocity that hinders a\nchange in the spin-spiral wavevector on these time scales.\n", "  We derive an integral condition for core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions\nand use it to construct a new diagnostic of explodability. The fundamental\nchallenge in CCSN theory is to explain how a stalled accretion shock revives to\nexplode a star. In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions. Burrows & Goshy suggested that the solutions above this\ncurve are dynamic and explosive. In this manuscript, we take one step closer to\nproving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve\nhave $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to\nexplosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,\n$\\Psi > 0$. $\\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,\nand we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\\tau$ condition used to\ninfer the $L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve. The illuminating\ndifference is that there is a direct relationship between $\\Psi$ and $v_s$.\nBelow the critical curve, $\\Psi$ may be negative, positive, and zero, which\ncorresponds to receding, expanding, and stalled-shock solutions. At the\ncritical curve, the minimum $\\Psi$ solution is zero; above the critical curve,\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$, and all steady solutions have $v_s > 0$. Using\none-dimensional simulations, we confirm our primary assumptions and verify that\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$ is a reliable and accurate explosion diagnostic.\n", "  The question whether indeterminism in quantum measurement outcomes is\nfundamental or is there a possibility of constructing a finer theory underlying\nquantum mechanics that allows no such indeterminism, has been debated for a\nlong time. We show that within the class of ontological models due to Harrigan\nand Spekkens, those satisfying preparation-measurement reciprocity must allow\nindeterminism of the order of quantum theory. Our result implies that one can\ndesign quantum random number generator, for which it is impossible, even in\nprinciple, to construct a reciprocal deterministic model.\n", "  A bipartite state is said to be steerable if and only if it does not have a\nsingle system description, i.e., the bipartite state cannot be explained by a\nlocal hidden state model. Several steering inequalities have been derived using\ndifferent local uncertainty relations to verify the ability to control the\nstate of one subsystem by the other party. Here, we derive complementarity\nrelations between coherences measured on mutually unbiased bases using various\ncoherence measures such as the $l_1$-norm, relative entropy and skew\ninformation. Using these relations, we derive conditions under which non-local\nadvantage of quantum coherence can be achieved and the state is steerable. We\nshow that not all steerable states can achieve such advantage.\n", "  The fractal dimensions of polymer chains and high-temperature graphs in the\nIsing model both in three dimension are determined using the conformal\nbootstrap applied for the continuation of the $O(N)$ models from $N=1$ (Ising\nmodel) to $N=0$ (polymer). The unitarity bound below $N=1$ of the scaling\ndimension for the the $O(N)$-symmetric-tensor develops a kink as a function of\nthe fundamental field as in the case of the energy operator dimension in the\nIsing model. Although this kink structure becomes less pronounced as $N$ tends\nto zero, an emerging asymmetric minimum in the current central charge $C_J$ can\nbe used to locate the CFT. It is pointed out that certain level degeneracies at\nthe $O(N)$ CFT should induce these singular shapes of the unitarity bounds. As\nan application to the quantum and classical spin systems, we also predict\ncritical exponents associated with the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, which\ncould be relevant for locating the correspoinding fixed point in the phase\ndiagram.\n", "  It was shown in \\cite{DVV} for $2d$ topological Conformal field theory (TCFT)\n\\cite{EY,W} and more recently in \\cite{BSZ}-\\cite{BB2} for the non-critical\nString theory \\cite{P}-\\cite{BAlZ} that a number of models of these two types\ncan be exactly solved using their connection with the Frobenius manifold (FM)\nstructure introduced by Dubrovin\\cite{Dub}. More precisely these models are\nconnected with a special case of FMs, so called Saito Frobenius manifolds\n(SFM)\\cite{Saito} (originally called Flat structure together with the Flat\ncoordinate system), which arise on the space of the versal deformations of the\nisolated Singularities after choosing of a suitabe so-called Primitive form,\nand which also arises on the quotient spaces by reflection groups. In this\npaper we explore the connection of the models of TCFT and non-critical String\ntheory with SFM. The crucial point for obtaining an explicit expression for the\ncorrelators is finding the flat coordinates of SFMs as functions of the\nparameters of the deformed singularity. We suggest a direct way to find the\nflat coordinates, using the integral representation for the solutions of\nGauss-Manin system connected with the corresponding SFM for a simple\nsingularity. Also, we address the possible generalization of our approach for\nthe models investigated in \\cite{Gep} which are ${SU(N)_k}/({SU(N-1)_{k+1}\n\\times U(1)})$ Kazama-Suzuki theories \\cite{KS}.\n", "  We propose a novel technique to separate the late-time, post-reionization\ncomponent of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect from the contribution\nto it from a (poorly understood and probably patchy) reionization history. The\nkSZ effect is one of the most promising probe of the {\\em missing baryons} in\nthe Universe. We study the possibility of reconstructing it in three dimensions\n(3D), using future spectroscopic surveys such as the Euclid survey. By\nreconstructing a 3D template from galaxy density and peculiar velocity fields\nfrom spectroscopic surveys we cross-correlate the estimator against CMB maps.\nThe resulting cross-correlation can help us to map out the kSZ contribution to\nCMB in 3D as a function of redshift thereby extending previous results which\nuse tomographic reconstruction. This allows the separation of the late time\neffect from the contribution owing to reionization. By construction, it avoids\ncontamination from foregrounds, primary CMB, tSZ effect as well as from star\nforming galaxies. Due to a high number density of galaxies the signal-to-noise\n(S/N) for such cross-correlational studies are higher, compared to the studies\ninvolving CMB power spectrum analysis. Using a spherical Bessel-Fourier (sFB)\ntransform we introduce a pair of 3D power-spectra: ${\\cal\nC}^{\\parallel}_\\ell(k)$ and ${\\cal C}^{\\perp}_\\ell(k)$ that can be used for\nthis purpose. We find that in a future spectroscopic survey with near all-sky\ncoverage and a survey depth of $z\\approx 1$, reconstruction of ${\\cal\nC}^{\\perp}_\\ell(k)$ can be achieved in a few radial wave bands\n$k\\approx(0.01-0.5 h^{-1}\\rm Mpc)$ with a S/N of upto ${\\cal O}(10)$ for\nangular harmonics in the range $\\ell=(200-2000)$ (abrdiged).\n", "  Spray formation and atomization in a gas-liquid mixing layer is an important\nfundamental problem of multiphase flows. It is highly desirable to visualize\nthe detailed atomization process and to analyze the instabilities and\nmechanisms involved, and massive numerical simulations are required, in\naddition to experiment. Rapid development of numerical methods and computer\ntechnology in the past decades now allows large-scale three-dimensional direct\nnumerical simulations of atomization to be performed. Nevertheless, the\nfundamental question, whether all the physical scales involved in the primary\nbreakup process are faithfully resolved, remains unclear. In the present study,\nwe conduct direct numerical simulations of spray formation in a gas-liquid\nmixing layer with state-of-the-art computational resources (using up to 4\nbillion cells and 16384 cores), in order to obtain a high-fidelity numerical\ncloseup of the detailed mechanisms of spray formation. We also aim to examine\nwhether present computational resources are sufficient for a fully resolved\ndirect numerical simulation of atomization.\n", "  In this study, the properties of wavefunctions of the MHD oscillations for a\nsingle and a system of straight flux tubes are investigated. Magnetic flux\ntubes with a straight magnetic field and longitudinal density stratification\nwere considered in zero-\\beta approximation. A single three-dimensional wave\nequation (eigen value problem) is solved for longitudinal component of the\nperturbed magnetic field using the finite element method (FEM). Wavefunctions\n(eigenfunction of wave equation) of the MHD oscillations are categorized into\nsausage, kink, helical kink and fluting modes. Concerning the amplitude\nlocation of the waves that arise from the flux tube, those waves are identified\nas body, surface, and leaky waves, appeared in the case of both a single and a\nsystem of flux tubes. Exact recognition of the wavefunctions can be used in\ncoronal seismology and also helps to the future high resolution instruments\nthat would be designed for studying the properties of the solar loop\noscillations in details.\n", "  We study Poisson structures of dynamical systems with three degrees of\nfreedom which are known for their chaotic properties, namely L\\\"u, modified\nL\\\"u, Chen, $T$ and Qi systems. We show that all these flows admit\nbi-Hamiltonian structures depending on the values of their parameters.\n", "  We outline a universal Schwinger-Keldysh effective theory which describes\nmacroscopic thermal fluctuations of a relativistic field theory. The basic\ningredients of our construction are three: a doubling of degrees of freedom, an\nemergent abelian symmetry associated with entropy, and a topological (BRST)\nsupersymmetry imposing fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We illustrate these\nideas for a non-linear viscous fluid, and demonstrate that the resulting\neffective action obeys a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which\nguarantees a local form of the second law.\n", "  The accurate and proper form of electron-hole excitations and corresponding\nDirac-like spinors of monolayer molybdenum disulfide superconductor are exactly\nobtained. Andreev reflection and resulting subgap conductance in a\n$MoS_2$-based ferromagnetic superconducting (F/S) junction is accurately\ninvestigated in terms of dynamical characteristics of system. Due to\nspin-splitting energy gap in the valence band and nondegenerate $K$ and $K'$\nvalleys, the ferromagnetic exchange energy $\\sigma h$ can cause a distinct\nbehavior of Andreev process between spin-up and spin-down charge carriers\nbelonging to different valleys. The chemical potential is necessarily fixed by\na determined range in order to occur the retro Andreev reflection. Given\none-particle superconducting bispinors enable us to explicitly involve the\nanisotropic superconducting gap $\\Delta_S$ under electron-hole conversion,\ni.e., taking place in $d$-wave pair coupling. The effect of such gap is exactly\nexplained in terms of the dependence of the Andreev process on the electron\nincidence angle at the interface.\n", "  ZrTe$_5$ is a newly discovered topological material. Shortly after a single\nlayer ZrTe$_5$ had been predicted to be a two-dimensional topological\ninsulator, a handful of experiments have been carried out on bulk ZrTe$_5$\ncrystals, which however suggest that its bulk form may be a three-dimensional\ntopological Dirac semimetal. We report the first transport study on ultra thin\nZrTe$_5$ flakes down to 10 nm. A significant modulation of the characteristic\nresistivity maximum in the temperature dependence by thickness has been\nobserved. Remarkably, the metallic behavior, occurring only below about 150 K\nin bulk, persists to over 320 K for flakes less than 20 nm thick. Furthermore,\nthe resistivity maximum can be greatly tuned by ionic gating. Combined with the\nHall resistance, we identify contributions from a semiconducting and a\nsemimetallic bands. The enhancement of the metallic state in thin flakes are\nconsequence of shifting of the energy bands. Our results suggest that the band\nstructure sensitively depends on the film thickness, which may explain the\ndivergent experimental observations on bulk materials.\n", "  It is very important to find some nontrivial relations for color-ordered\namplitudes at loop levels. In the last several years, a pure group-theoretic\nmethod has been proposed to study loop level relations for color-ordered\namplitudes in $\\sun$ gauge theories. In this paper, we apply the same method to\nstudy the linear relations for loop level four point color-ordered gluon\namplitudes in gauge theory with $\\son$ group and find that there are\n$1,6,10,13,16$ constraint relations at $L=0,1,2,3,4$ loop level. It is expected\nthat there are more group-theoretic constraints for high loop levels. The\nconstraint relations should be derived order by order in $\\son$ gauge theories.\nThis is unlike the $\\sun$ case, where there are only four constraints for\nhigher $(L\\geqslant 2)$ loop amplitudes.\n", "  Deformed square resonators with the flat sides replaced by circular sides are\nproposed and demonstrated to enhance mode Q factors and adjust transverse mode\nintervals using the regular ray dynamic analysis and numerical simulations.\nDual-transverse-mode emissions due to the ultrahigh-Q factors with different\nwavelength intervals are realized experimentally for AlGaInAs/InP circular-side\nsquare microlasers, and the stationary condition of the dual-mode emission is\nsatisfied because the high-Q confined modes have totally different mode\nnumbers. Furthermore, optical frequency combs are generated using the dual-mode\nlasing microlaser as a seeding light source by cascaded four-wave mixing in a\nhighly nonlinear optical fiber.\n", "  Known methods for transverse confinement and guidance of light can be grouped\ninto a few basic mechanisms, the most common being metallic reflection, total\ninternal reflection and photonic-bandgap (or Bragg) reflection. All of them\nessentially rely on changes of the refractive index, that is on scalar\nproperties of light. Recently, processes based on \"geometric Berry phases\",\nsuch as manipulation of polarization states or deflection of spinning-light\nrays, have attracted considerable interest in the contexts of singular optics\nand structured light. Here, we disclose a new approach to light waveguiding,\nusing geometric Berry phases and exploiting polarization states and their\nhandling. This can be realized in structured three-dimensional anisotropic\nmedia, in which the optic axis lies orthogonal to the propagation direction and\nis modulated along it and across the transverse plane, so that the refractive\nindex remains constant but a phase distortion can be imposed on a beam. In\naddition to a complete theoretical analysis with numerical simulations, we\npresent a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of this effect in a\ndiscrete element implementation of a geometric phase waveguide. The mechanism\nwe introduce shows that spin-orbit optical interactions can play an important\nrole in integrated optics and paves the way to an entire new class of photonic\nsystems that exploit the vectorial nature of light.\n", "  Employing Nernst-Einstein decomposition $\\sigma=e^2\\chi_c D$ of the\nconductivity $\\sigma$ onto charge susceptibility (compressibility) $\\chi_c$ and\ndiffusion constant $D$, we argue that the bad-metallic behavior of $\\sigma$ in\nthe regime of high temperatures and lightly doped insulator is dominated by the\nstrong temperature and doping dependence of $\\chi_c$. In particular, we show\nhow at small dopings $\\chi_c$ strongly decreases towards undoped-insulating\nvalues with increasing temperature and discuss simple picture leading to the\nlinear-in-temperature resistivity with the prefactor increasing inversely with\ndecreasing concentration ($p$) of doped holes, $\\rho\\propto T/p$. On the other\nhand, $D$ shows weak temperature and doping dependence in the corresponding\nregime. We support our arguments by numerical results on the prototypical two\ndimensional Hubbard model and discuss the proposed picture at length from the\nexperimental point of view.\n", "  We suggest the measurement of Drell-Yan (DY) lepton pairs in p-Pb collisions\nat the LHC (sqrt(s)=5.02 TeV) in order to disentangle the relative\ncontributions of shadowing and coherent energy loss in quarkonium production\noff nuclei. The nuclear modification of low mass DY production is computed at\nNLO using various sets of nuclear parton densities. It is then observed that\nshadowing effects strongly cancel out in the J/psi over DY suppression ratio\nR_{pA}^{J/psi}(y) / R_{pA}^{DY}(y), unlike the effect of coherent energy loss.\nSuch a measurement could be performed at forward rapidity by the ALICE and LHCb\ncollaborations at the LHC.\n", "  We introduce a scheme that exploits laser cooling and phonon-mediated\nspin-spin interactions in crystals of trapped atomic ions to explore the\ntransport of energy through a quantum magnet. We show how to implement an\neffective transport window to control the flow of energy through the magnet\neven in the absence of fermionic statistics for the carriers. This is achieved\nby shaping the density of states of the effective thermal reservoirs that arise\nfrom the interaction with the external bath of the modes of the electromagnetic\nfield, and can be experimentally controlled by tuning the laser frequencies and\nintensities appropriately. The interplay of this transport window with the\nspin-spin interactions is exploited to build an analogue of the\nCoulomb-blockade effect in nano-scale electronic devices, and opens new\npossibilities to study quantum effects in energy transport.\n", "  The question of whether Hawking evaporation violates unitarity, and therefore\nresults in the loss of information, remains unresolved since Hawking's seminal\ndiscovery. So far the investigations remain mostly theoretical since it is\nalmost impossible to settle this paradox through direct astrophysical black\nhole observations. Here we point out that relativistic plasma mirrors can be\naccelerated drastically and stopped abruptly by impinging ultra intense x-ray\npulses on solid plasma targets with a density gradient. This is analogous to\nthe late time evolution of black hole Hawking evaporation. A conception of such\nan experiment is proposed and a self-consistent set of physical parameters is\npresented. Critical issues such as black hole unitarity may be addressed\nthrough the measurement of the entanglement between the Hawking radiation and\ntheir partner modes.\n", "  Recently the most general completion of Brans-Dicke theory was appeared with\nenergy exchanged between the scalar field and ordinary matter, given that the\nequation of motion for the scalar field keeps the simple wave form of\nBrans-Dicke. This class of theories contain undetermined functions, but there\nexist only three theories which are unambiguously determined from consistency.\nHere, for the first such theory, it is found the action of the vacuum theory\nwhich arises as the limit of the full matter theory. A symmetry transformation\nof this vacuum action in the Jordan frame is found which consists of a\nconformal transformation of the metric together with a redefinition of the\nscalar field. Since the general family of vacuum theories is parametrized by an\narbitrary function of the scalar field, the action of this family is also\nfound. As for the full matter theory it is only found the action of the system\nwhen the matter Lagrangian vanishes on-shell, as for example for pressureless\ndust. Due to the interaction, this matter Lagrangian is non-minimally coupled\neither in the Jordan or the Einstein frame.\n", "  Circulators are non-reciprocal circuit elements integral to technologies\nincluding radar systems, microwave communication transceivers, and the readout\nof quantum information devices. Their non-reciprocity arises from the\ninterference of microwaves over the centimetre-scale of the signal wavelength\nin the presence of bulky magnetic media that break time-reversal symmetry. Here\nwe realize a completely passive on-chip microwave circulator with size\none-thousandth the wavelength by exploiting the chiral, slow-light response of\na 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum Hall regime. For an\nintegrated GaAs device with 330 um diameter and 1 GHz centre frequency, a\nnon-reciprocity of 25 dB is observed over a 50 MHz bandwidth. Furthermore, the\ndirection of circulation can be selected dynamically by varying the magnetic\nfield, an aspect that may enable reconfigurable passive routing of microwave\nsignals on-chip.\n", "  With the non-local observables such as two point correlation function and\nholographic entanglement entropy, we probe the phase structure of the\nBorn-Infeld-anti-de Sitter black holes. We find for the case $bQ>0.5$, the\nphase structure is similar to that of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-AdS black hole,\nnamely the black hole undergoes a Hawking-Page phase transition, a first order\nphase transition, and a second order phase transition. While for the case\n$bQ<0.5$, we find there is a new branch for the infinitesimally small black\nhole so that a pseudo phase transition emerges besides the original first order\nphase transition. For the first order phase transition and the pseudo phase\ntransition, the equal area law is checked, and for the second order phase\ntransition, the critical exponent of the analogous heat capacity is obtained in\nthe neighborhood of the critical points. All the results show that the phase\nstructure of the non-local observables is the same as that of the thermal\nentropy regardless of the size of the boundary region in the field theory.\n", "  The bright soliton solutions and singular solutions are constructed for\nspace-time fractional EW and modified EW equations. Both equations are reduced\nto ordinary differential equations by the use of fractional complex transform\nand properties of modified Riemann-Liouville derivative. Then, implementation\nof ansatz method the solutions are constructed.\n", "  ImageJ is a graphical user interface (GUI) driven, public domain, Java-based,\nsoftware package for general image processing traditionally used mainly in life\nsciences fields. The image processing capabilities of ImageJ are useful and\nextendable to other scientific fields. Here we present AstroImageJ (AIJ), which\nprovides an astronomy specific image display environment and tools for\nastronomy specific image calibration and data reduction. Although AIJ maintains\nthe general purpose image processing capabilities of ImageJ, AIJ is streamlined\nfor time-series differential photometry, light curve detrending and fitting,\nand light curve plotting, especially for applications requiring ultra-precise\nlight curves (e.g., exoplanet transits). AIJ reads and writes standard FITS\nfiles, as well as other common image formats, provides FITS header viewing and\nediting, and is World Coordinate System (WCS) aware, including an automated\ninterface to the astrometry.net web portal for plate solving images. AIJ\nprovides research grade image calibration and analysis tools with a GUI driven\napproach, and easily installed cross-platform compatibility. It enables new\nusers, even at the level of undergraduate student, high school student, or\namateur astronomer, to quickly start processing, modeling, and plotting\nastronomical image data with one tightly integrated software package.\n", "  Phosphorene, a single atomic layer of black phosphorus, has recently emerged\nas a new twodimensional (2D) material that holds promise for electronic and\nphotonic technology. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the electronic\nstructure of few-layer phosphorene varies significantly with the number of\nlayers, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The interband optical\ntransitions cover a wide, technologically important spectrum range from visible\nto mid-infrared. In addition, we observe strong photoluminescence in few-layer\nphosphorene at energies that match well with the absorption edge, indicating\nthey are direct bandgap semiconductors. The strongly layer-dependent electronic\nstructure of phosphorene, in combination with its high electrical mobility,\ngives it distinct advantages over other twodimensional materials in electronic\nand opto-electronic applications.\n", "  It has been recently argued that inserting a probe anti-D3-brane in a flux\nbackground breaks supersymmetry spontaneously instead of explicitly, as\npreviously thought. In this paper we argue that such spontaneous breaking of\nsupersymmetry persists even when the probe anti-D3-brane is kept in a curved\nbackground with an internal space that doesn't have to be a Calabi-Yau\nmanifold. To show this we take a specific curved background generated by\nfractional three-branes and fluxes on a non-Kahler resolved conifold where\nsupersymmetry breaking appears directly from certain world-volume fermions\nbecoming massive. In fact this turns out to be a generic property even if we\nchange the dimensionality of the anti-brane, or allow higher order fermionic\ninteractions on the anti-brane. We argue for the former by taking a probe\nanti-D7-brane in a flux background and demonstrate the spontaneous breaking of\nsupersymmetry using world-volume fermions. We argue for the latter by\nconstructing an all order fermionic action for the anti-D3-brane from which the\nspontaneous nature of supersymmetry breaking can be demonstrated by bringing it\nto a kappa-symmetric form.\n", "  Information theory establishes the fundamental limits on data transmission,\nstorage, and processing. Quantum information theory unites information\ntheoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to\ngive a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful\npossibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and\nquantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion\nof different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of\nentropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding\nanswers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious\ncases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity\nregion of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a\nquantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates.\nHere we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform\nadditivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known\nquantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly\nadditive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy\ninequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and\nintriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information. We also\nuncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive\nfunctions are identical; the tractable answers in classical and quantum\ninformation theory are formally equivalent. Our techniques pave the way for a\ndeeper understanding of the tractability of information theory, from classical\nmulti-user problems like broadcast channels to the evaluation of quantum\nchannel capacities.\n", "  We present multi-wavelength observations of SN2014C during the first 500\ndays. These observations represent the first solid detection of a young\nextragalactic stripped-envelope SN out to high-energy X-rays. SN2014C was the\nexplosion of an H-stripped progenitor star with ordinary explosion parameters.\nHowever, over the time scale of ~1yr, SN2014C experienced a complete\nmetamorphosis and evolved from an ordinary H-poor supernova of type Ib into a\nstrongly interacting, H-rich supernova of type IIn. Signatures of the SN shock\ninteracting with a dense medium are observed across the spectrum. Coordinated\nobservations with Swift, Chandra and NuSTAR have captured the evolution in\ndetail and revealed the presence of a massive shell of ~1 Msun of hydrogen-rich\nmaterial at ~6d16 cm from the explosion site. We estimate that the shell was\nejected by the progenitor star in the decades to centuries before core\ncollapse. This result poses significant challenges to current theories of\nmassive star evolution, as it requires a physical mechanism responsible for the\nejection of the deepest hydrogen layer of H-poor SN progenitors synchronized\nwith the onset of stellar collapse. Theoretical investigations point at binary\ninteractions and/or instabilities during the last stages of nuclear burning in\nmassive stars as potential triggers of the time-dependent mass loss. We\nconstrain these scenarios utilizing the sample of 183 SNe Ib/c with public\nradio observations. Our analysis identifies SN2014C-like signatures in ~10% of\nSNe with constraining radio data. This fraction is somewhat larger but\nreasonably consistent with the expectation from the theory of recent envelope\nejection due to binary evolution IF the ejected material can survive in the\nclose environment for 1000-10000 yrs. Alternatively, nuclear burning\ninstabilities extending all the way to the core C-burning phase might also play\na critical role.\n", "  Conditional pulse nulling (CPN) receiver is proposed by Dolinar to\ndiscriminate pulse position modulation (PPM) signals. The receiver using a beam\nsplitter and an on-off photon detector can outperform the standard quantum\nlimit (SQL) for PPM signals. In this paper, we apply this receiver to\nmulti-pulse PPM (MPPM) and binary quantum coding signals, and use dynamic\nprogramming algorithm to optimize the control strategy. The MPPM signals is\nused to improve the band-utilization efficiency, and the binary quantum coding\nmake the communication able to correct the error. Numerical simulation results\nshow that the CPN receiver with optimized strategy can also outperform SQL for\nboth MPPM and binary quantum coding signals.\n", "  We study the asymptotic volume dependence of the heavy-heavy-light\nthree-point functions in the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory using the\nhexagon bootstrap approach, where the volume is the length of the heavy\noperator. We extend the analysis of our previous short letter 1511.06199 to the\ngeneral case where the heavy operators can be in any rank one sector and the\nlight operator being a generic non-BPS operator. We prove the conjecture of\nBajnok, Janik and Wereszczynski 1404.4556 up to leading finite size\ncorrections.\n", "  Experience collected in mesoscopic dynamic modeling of externally driven\nsystems indicates absence of potentials that could play role of equilibrium or\nnonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials yet their thermo-dynamics-like modeling\nis often found to provide a good description, good understanding, and\npredictions that agree with results of experimental observations. This apparent\ncontradiction is explained by noting that the dynamic and the\nthermodynamics-like investigations on a given mesoscopic level of description\nare not directly related. Their relation is indirect. They both represent two\naspects of dynamic modeling on a more microscopic level of description. The\nthermodynamic analysis arises in the investigation of the way the more\nmicroscopic dynamics reduces to the mesoscopic dynamics (reducing dynamics) and\nthe mesoscopic dynamic analysis in the investigation of the result of the\nreduction (reduced dynamics).\n", "  We give a minimal holographic model of a disorder-driven metal-insulator\ntransition. It consists in a CFT with a charge sector and a\ntranslation-breaking sector that interact in the most generic way allowed by\nthe symmetries and by dynamical consistency. In the gravity dual, it reduces to\na Massive Gravity-Maxwell model with new direct couplings between the Maxwell\nand metric that are allowed when gravity is massive. We show that, generically,\nthe effect of disorder is to decrease the DC electrical conductivity. This\nhappens to such an extent that the conductivity does not obey any lower bound\nand can be very small in the insulating phase. In some cases, the large\ndisorder limit produces gradient instabilities that hint at the formation of\nmodulated phases.\n", "  The Zeeman spatial splitting of a neutron beam takes place during a neutron\nspin-flip in magnetically non-collinear systems at grazing incidence geometry.\nWe apply the neutron beam-splitting method for the investigation of\nmagnetically non-collinear clusters of submicron size in a thin film. The\nexperimental results are compared with ones obtained by other methods.\n", "  Using the diagrammatic approach to integrals over Gaussian random matrices,\nwe find a representation for polynomial Lie group integrals as infinite sums\nover certain maps on surfaces. The maps involved satisfy a specific condition:\nthey have some marked vertices, and no closed walks that avoid these vertices.\nWe also formulate our results in terms of permutations, arriving at new kinds\nof factorization problems.\n", "  The interaction between an atom and the electromagnetic field inside a cavity\nhas played a crucial role in the historical development of our understanding of\nlight-matter interaction and is a central part of various quantum technologies,\nsuch as lasers and many quantum computing architectures. The emergence of\nsuperconducting qubits has allowed the realization of strong and ultrastrong\ncoupling between artificial atoms and cavities. If the coupling strength $g$\nbecomes as large as the atomic and cavity frequencies ($\\Delta$ and\n$\\omega_{\\rm o}$ respectively), the energy eigenstates including the ground\nstate are predicted to be highly entangled. This qualitatively new regime can\nbe called the deep strong-coupling regime, and there has been an ongoing debate\nover whether it is fundamentally possible to realize this regime in realistic\nphysical systems. By inductively coupling a flux qubit and an LC oscillator via\nJosephson junctions, we have realized circuits with $g/\\omega_{\\rm o}$ ranging\nfrom 0.72 to 1.34 and $g/\\Delta\\gg 1$. Using spectroscopy measurements, we have\nobserved unconventional transition spectra, with patterns resembling masquerade\nmasks, that are characteristic of this new regime. Our results provide a basis\nfor ground-state-based entangled-pair generation and open a new direction of\nresearch on strongly correlated light-matter states in circuit-quantum\nelectrodynamics.\n", "  Several examples of classical superintegrable systems in two-dimensional spac\nare shown to possess hidden symmetries leading to their linearization. They are\nthose determined 50 years ago in [Phys. Lett. 13, 354 (1965)], and the more\nrecent Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz system [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 242001\n(2009)].\n  We conjecture that all classical superintegrable systems in two-dimensional\nspace have hidden symmetries that make them linearizable.\n", "  Lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) changes the morphology of\npattern of temperature fluctuations, so topological descriptors such as\nMinkowski Functionals can probe the gravity model responsible for the lensing.\nWe show how the recently introduced two-to-two and three-to-one kurt-spectra\n(and their associated correlation functions), which depend on the power\nspectrum of the lensing potential, can be used to probe modified gravity\ntheories such as $f({R})$ theories of gravity and quintessence models. We also\ninvestigate models based on effective field theory, which include the\nconstant-$\\Omega$ model, and low-energy Ho\\vrava theories. Estimates of the\ncumulative signal-to-noise for detection of lensing-induced morphology changes,\nreaches ${\\cal O}(10^3)$ for the future planned CMB polarization mission\nCOrE$^{+}$. Assuming foreground removal is possible to $\\ell_{max}=3000$, we\nshow that many modified gravity theories can be rejected with a high level of\nsignificance, making this technique comparable in power to galaxy weak lensing\nor redshift surveys. These topological estimators are also useful in\ndistinguishing {\\em lensing} from other scattering secondaries at the level of\nthe four-point function or trispectrum. Examples include the kinetic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect which shares, with lensing, a lack of spectral\ndistortion. We also discuss the complication of foreground contamination from\nunsubtracted point sources.\n", "  Many experiments utilize the precession of trapped particles in magnetic\nfields to perform high precision measurements. It had been presumed that after\nfree precession, initially polarized particles will form a Gaussian phase\ndistribution in the plane of precession. We show that trapped particles in the\npresence of magnetic field gradients and electric fields will often form a\nnon-Gaussian distribution with power-law tails which are consistent with\nnonextensive statistics. As the exact shape of the distribution depends upon\nmany experimental parameters, it provides a potential new technique to directly\nmeasure them.\n", "  We analyse generic AdS flux backgrounds preserving eight supercharges in\n$D=4$ and $D=5$ dimensions using exceptional generalised geometry. We show that\nthey are described by a pair of globally defined, generalised structures,\nidentical to those that appear for flat flux backgrounds but with different\nintegrability conditions. We give a number of explicit examples of such\n\"exceptional Sasaki-Einstein\" backgrounds in type IIB supergravity and\nM-theory. In particular, we give the complete analysis of the generic AdS$_5$\nM-theory backgrounds. We also briefly discuss the structure of the moduli space\nof solutions. In all cases, one structure defines a \"generalised Reeb vector\"\nthat generates a Killing symmetry of the background corresponding to the\nR-symmetry of the dual field theory, and in addition encodes the generic\ncontact structures that appear in the $D=4$ M-theory and $D=5$ type IIB cases.\nFinally, we investigate the relation between generalised structures and\nquantities in the dual field theory, showing that the central charge and\nR-charge of BPS wrapped-brane states are both encoded by the generalised Reeb\nvector, as well as discussing how volume minimisation (the dual of $a$- and\n$\\mathcal{F}$-maximisation) is encoded.\n", "  We present a cosmic void catalog using the large-scale structure galaxy\ncatalog from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This galaxy\ncatalog is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 and is\nthe final catalog of SDSS-III. We take into account the survey boundaries,\nmasks, and angular and radial selection functions, and apply the ZOBOV void\nfinding algorithm to the galaxy catalog. We identify a total of 10,643 voids.\nAfter making quality cuts to ensure that the voids represent real underdense\nregions, we obtain 1,228 voids with effective radii spanning the range\n20-100Mpc/h and with central densities that are, on average, 30% of the mean\nsample density. We release versions of the catalogs both with and without\nquality cuts. We discuss the basic statistics of voids, such as their size and\nredshift distributions, and measure the radial density profile of the voids via\na stacking technique. In addition, we construct mock void catalogs from 1000\nmock galaxy catalogs, and find that the properties of BOSS voids are in good\nagreement with those in the mock catalogs. We compare the stellar mass\ndistribution of galaxies living inside and outside of the voids, and find no\nsignificant difference. These BOSS and mock void catalogs are useful for a\nnumber of cosmological and galaxy environment studies.\n", "  A classification of integrable two-component systems of non-evolutionary\npartial differential equations that are analogous to the Camassa-Holm equation\nis carried out via the perturbative symmetry approach. Independently, a\nclassification of compatible pairs of Hamiltonian operators is carried out,\nwhich leads to bi-Hamiltonian structures for the same systems of equations.\nSome exact solutions and Lax pairs are also constructed for the systems\nconsidered.\n", "  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, LIGO, found direct\nevidence for double black hole binaries emitting gravitational waves. Galactic\nnuclei are expected to harbor the densest population of stellar-mass black\nholes. A significant fraction ($\\sim30\\%$) of these black holes can reside in\nbinaries. We examine the fate of the black hole binaries in active galactic\nnuclei, which get trapped in the inner region of the accretion disk around the\ncentral supermassive black hole. We show that binary black holes can migrate\ninto and then rapidly merge within the disk well within a Salpeter time. The\nbinaries may also accrete a significant amount of gas from the disk, well above\nthe Eddington rate. This could lead to detectable X-ray or gamma-ray emission,\nbut would require hyper-Eddington accretion with a few percent radiative\nefficiency, comparable to thin disks. We discuss implications for gravitational\nwave observations and black hole population studies. We estimate that Advanced\nLIGO may detect $\\sim20$ such, gas-induced binary mergers per year.\n", "  This paper provides a construction of a quantum statistical mechanical system\nassociated to knots in the 3-sphere and cyclic branched coverings of the\n3-sphere, which is an analog, in the sense of arithmetic topology, of the\nBost-Connes system, with knots replacing primes, and cyclic branched coverings\nof the 3-sphere replacing abelian extensions of the field of rational numbers.\nThe operator algebraic properties of this system differ significantly from the\nBost-Connes case, due to the properties of the action of the semigroup of knots\non a direct limit of knot groups. The resulting algebra of observables is a\nnoncommutative Bernoulli crossed product. We describe the main properties of\nthe associated quantum statistical mechanical system and of the relevant\npartition functions, which are obtained from simple knot invariants like genus\nand crossing number.\n", "  Optomechanical systems couple an electromagnetic cavity to a mechanical\nresonator which is typically formed from a solid object. The range of phenomena\naccessible to these systems depends on the properties of the mechanical\nresonator and on the manner in which it couples to the cavity fields. In both\nrespects, a mechanical resonator formed from superfluid liquid helium offers\nseveral appealing features: low electromagnetic absorption, high thermal\nconductivity, vanishing viscosity, well-understood mechanical loss, and in situ\nalignment with cryogenic cavities. In addition, it offers degrees of freedom\nthat differ qualitatively from those of a solid. Here, we describe an\noptomechanical system consisting of a miniature optical cavity filled with\nsuperfluid helium. The cavity mirrors define optical and mechanical modes with\nnear-perfect overlap, resulting in an optomechanical coupling rate ~3 kHz. This\ncoupling is used to drive the superfluid; it is also used to observe the\nsuperfluid's thermal motion, resolving a mean phonon number as low as 11.\n", "  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are intense radio flashes from the sky that are\ncharacterized by millisecond durations and Jansky-level flux densities. We\ncarried out a statistical analysis on FRBs discovered. Their mean dispersion\nmeasure, after subtracting the contribution from the interstellar medium of our\nGalaxy, is found to be $\\sim 660\\,\\rm pc\\,cm^{-3}$, supporting their being from\ncosmological origin. Their energy released in radio band spans about two orders\nof magnitude, with a mean value of $\\sim 10^{39}$ ergs. More interestingly,\nalthough the FRB study is still in a very early phase, the published collection\nof FRBs enables us to derive a useful intensity distribution function. For the\n16 non-repeating FRBs detected by Parkes telescope and the Green Bank\nTelescope, the intensity distribution can be described as $dN/dF_{\\rm obs} =\n(4.1 \\pm 1.3) \\times 10^3 \\, F_{\\rm obs}^{-1.1\\pm0.2} \\; \\rm\nsky^{-1}\\,day^{-1}$, where $F_{\\rm obs}$ is the observed radio fluence in units\nof Jy~ms. Here the power-law index is significantly flatter than the expected\nvalue of 2.5 for standard candles distributed homogeneously in a flat Euclidean\nspace. Based on this intensity distribution function, the Five-hundred-meter\nAperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) will be able to detect about 5 FRBs\nfor every 1000 hours of observation time.\n", "  We apply the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test to the stacked voids identified using\nthe large-scale structure galaxy catalog from the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This galaxy catalog is part of the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 and is the final catalog of SDSS-III. We also\nuse 1000 mock galaxy catalogs that match the geometry, density, and clustering\nproperties of the BOSS sample in order to characterize the statistical\nuncertainties of our measurements and take into account systematic errors such\nas redshift space distortions. For both BOSS data and mock catalogs, we use the\nZOBOV algorithm to identify voids, we stack together all voids with effective\nradii of 30-100Mpc/h in the redshift range 0.43-0.7, and we accurately measure\nthe shape of the stacked voids. Our tests with the mock catalogs show that we\nmeasure the stacked void ellipticity with a statistical precision of 2.6%. We\nfind that the stacked voids in redshift space are slightly squashed along the\nline of sight, which is consistent with previous studies. We repeat this\nmeasurement of stacked void shape in the BOSS data assuming several values of\nOmega_m within the flat LCDM model, and we compare to the mock catalogs in\nredshift space in order to perform the AP test. We obtain a constraint of\n$\\Omega_m = 0.38^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ at the 68% confidence level from the AP test.\nWe discuss the various sources of statistical and systematic noise that affect\nthe constraining power of this method. In particular, we find that the measured\nellipticity of stacked voids scales more weakly with cosmology than the\nstandard AP prediction, leading to significantly weaker constraints. We discuss\nhow AP constraints will improve in future surveys with larger volumes and\ndensities.\n", "  The performance of long-haul high speed coherent optical fiber communication\nsystems is significantly degraded by the laser phase noise and the equalization\nenhanced phase noise (EEPN). In this paper, the analysis of the one-tap\nnormalized least-mean-square (LMS) carrier phase recovery (CPR) is carried out\nand the close-form expression is investigated for quadrature phase shift keying\n(QPSK) coherent optical fiber communication systems, in compensating both laser\nphase noise and equalization enhanced phase noise. Numerical simulations have\nalso been implemented to verify the theoretical analysis. It is found that the\none-tap normalized least-mean-square algorithm gives the same analytical\nexpression for predicting CPR bit-error-rate (BER) floors as the traditional\ndifferential carrier phase recovery, when both the laser phase noise and the\nequalization enhanced phase noise are taken into account.\n", "  We consider asymptotically-AdS $n$-dimensional black brane solutions in a\ntheory of gravity coupled to a set of $N$ $p$-form field strengths, in which\nthe field strengths carry magnetic charges. For appropriately chosen charges,\nthe metrics are isotropic in the $(n-2)$ transverse directions. However, in\ngeneral the field strength configurations break the full Euclidean symmetry of\nthe $(n-2)$-dimensional transverse space. We then study the linearised equation\nfor transverse traceless metric perturbations in these backgrounds, and by\nemploying the Kubo formula we obtain expressions for $\\eta/S$, the ratio of\nshear viscosity to entropy density. We find that the KSS bound on the ratio\n$\\eta/S$ is generally violated in these solutions. We also extend the\ndiscussion by including also a dilatonic scalar field in the theory, leading to\nsolutions that are asymptotically Lifshitz with hyperscaling violation.\n", "  Recent results suggest that a crucial crossroad for quantum gravity is the\ncharacterization of the effective dimension of spacetime at short distances,\nwhere quantum properties of spacetime become significant. This is relevant in\nparticular for various scenarios of \"dynamical dimensional reduction\" which\nhave been discussed in the literature. We are here concerned with the fact that\nthe related research effort has been based mostly on analyses of the \"spectral\ndimension\", which involves an unphysical Euclideanization of spacetime and is\nhighly sensitive to the off-shell properties of a theory. As here shown,\ndifferent formulations of the same physical theory can have wildly different\nspectral dimension. We propose that dynamical dimensional reduction should be\ndescribed in terms of the \"thermal dimension\" which we here introduce, a notion\nthat only depends on the physical content of the theory. We analyze a few\nmodels with dynamical reduction both of the spectral dimension and of our\nthermal dimension, finding in particular some cases where thermal and spectral\ndimension agree, but also some cases where the spectral dimension has puzzling\nproperties while the thermal dimension gives a different and meaningful\npicture.\n", "  We carefully examine the thermodynamic consequences of the repeated partial\nprojection model for coupling a quantum system to an arbitrary series of\nenvironments under feedback control. This paper provides observational\ndefinitions of heat and work that can be realized in current laboratory setups.\nIn contrast to other definitions, it uses only properties of the environment\nand the measurement outcomes, avoiding references to the `measurement' of the\ncentral system's state in any basis. These definitions are consistent with the\nusual laws of thermodynamics at all temperatures, while never requiring\ncomplete projective measurement of the entire system. It is shown that the\nback-action of measurement must be counted as work rather than heat to satisfy\nthe second law. Comparisons are made to stochastic Schr\\\"{o}dinger unravelling\nand transition-probability based methods, many of which appear as particular\nlimits of the present model. These limits show that our total entropy\nproduction is a lower bound on traditional definitions of heat that trace out\nthe measurement device. Examining the master equation approximation to the\nprocess at finite measurement rates, we show that most interactions with the\nenvironment make the system unable to reach absolute zero. We give an explicit\nformula for the minimum temperature achievable in repeatedly measured quantum\nsystems. The phenomenon of minimum temperature offers a novel explanation of\nrecent experiments aimed at testing fluctuation theorems in the quantum realm\nand places a fundamental purity limit on quantum computers.\n", "  The charged pion multiplicity ratio in intermediate energy heavy-ion\ncollisions, a probe of the density dependence of symmetry energy above the\nsaturation point, has been proven in a previous study to be extremely sensitive\nto the strength of the isovector $\\Delta$(1232) potential in nuclear matter. As\nthere is no knowledge, either from theory or experiment, about the magnitude of\nthis quantity, the extraction of constraints on the slope of the symmetry\nenergy at saturation by using exclusively the mentioned observable is hindered\nat present. It is shown that, by including the ratio of average $p_T$ of\ncharged pions $\\langle p_T^{(\\pi^+)}\\rangle/\\langle p_T^{(\\pi^-)}\\rangle$ in\nthe list of fitted observables, the noted problem can be circumvented. A\nrealistic description of this observable requires accounting for the\ninteraction of pions with the dense nuclear matter environment by the\nincorporation of the so called $S$-wave and $P$-wave pion optical potentials.\nThis is performed within the framework of a quantum molecular dynamics\ntransport model that enforces the conservation of the total energy of the\nsystem. It is shown that constraints on the slope of the symmetry energy at\nsaturation density and the strength of the $\\Delta$(1232) potential can be\nsimultaneously extracted. A symmetry energy with a value of the slope parameter\n$L>$ 50 MeV is favored, at 1$\\sigma$ confidence level, from a comparison with\npublished FOPI experimental data. A precise constraint will require\nexperimental data more accurate than presently available, particularly for the\ncharged pion multiplicity ratio, and better knowledge of the density and\nmomentum dependence of the pion potential for the whole range of these two\nvariables probed in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Two different induced effects of a laser falling edge on high-order harmonic\ngeneration are resolved by solving numerically full-dimensional electronic\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation beyond the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. The harmonic spectrum of H$_2^+$ and T$_2^+$ isotopes are\ncompared to see the effects of a 4-cycle falling edge of a 800 nm, 15-cycle\ntrapezoidal laser pulse of $I=$3 $\\times 10^{14}$ Wcm$^{-2}$ intensity on\nharmonic emission spectrum. The harmonic emission at the laser falling part is\nnegligible for H$_2^+$ due to ionization suppression, but considerable for\nT$_2^+$. The falling edge of the laser pulse induces two effects on the HHG in\nT$_2^+$. The first well-known effect is non-adiabatic frequency redshift of\ngenerated odd-order harmonics. The second unknown one is spatially asymmetric\nharmonic emission which appears as even harmonic orders. In order to clarify\nthis new effect, spatial distribution of HHG and resolving HHG into different\ncomponents are demonstrated. The asymmetric emission would appear for both\natoms and molecules as long as harmonic emission of either rising or falling\nedge of an intense trapezoidal or non-trapezoidal laser pulse is dominant.\n", "  Boundary-induced pattern formation from a spatially uniform state is\ninvestigated using one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations. The temporal\noscillation is successively transformed into a spatially periodic pattern,\ntriggered by diffusion from the fixed boundary. We introduced a spatial map,\nwhose temporal sequence, under selection criteria from multiple stationary\nsolutions, can completely reproduce the emergent pattern, by replacing the time\nwith space. The relationship of the pattern wavelength with the period of\noscillation is also obtained. The generality of the pattern selection process\nand algorithm is discussed with possible relevance to biological morphogenesis.\n", "  We develop numerical tools and apply them to solve the relativistic\nYang--Mills--Higgs equations in a model where the SU(N) symmetry is\nspontaneously broken to its center. In SU(2) and SU(3), we obtain the different\nfield profiles for infinite and finite center vortices, with endpoints at\nexternal monopole sources. Exploration of parameter space permits the detection\nof a region where the equations get Abelianized. Finally, a general\nparametrization of the color structure of SU(2) fields leads us to a reference\npoint where an Abelian-like BPS bound is reconciled with N-ality.\n", "  The Auto-Importance Sampling (AIS) method is a Monte Carlo variance reduction\ntechnique proposed for deep penetration problems, which can significantly\nimprove computational efficiency without pre-calculations for importance\ndistribution. However, the AIS method is only validated with several simple\nexamples, and cannot be used for coupled neutron-photon transport. This paper\npresents the improved algorithms for the AIS method, including particle\ntransport, fictitious particles creation and adjustment, fictitious surface\ngeometry, random number allocation and calculation of the estimated relative\nerror. These improvements allow the AIS method to be applicable to complicated\ndeep penetration problems with complex geometry and multiple materials. A\ncoupled Neutron-Photon Auto-Importance Sampling (NP-AIS) method is proposed to\nsolve the deep penetration problems of coupled neutron-photon transport using\nthe improved algorithms. The NUREG/CR-6115 PWR benchmark was calculated by\nusing the methods of NP-AIS, geometry splitting with Russian roulette and the\nanalog Monte Carlo, respectively. The calculation results of NP-AIS were in\ngood agreement with those of geometry splitting with Russian roulette and the\nbenchmark solutions. The computational efficiency of NP-AIS for both neutron\nand photon was much better than that of geometry splitting with Russian\nroulette in most cases, and increased by several orders of magnitude compared\nwith that of the analog Monte Carlo.\n", "  Graphene/h-BN has emerged as a model van der Waals heterostructure, and the\nband structure engineering by the superlattice potential has led to various\nnovel quantum phenomena including the self-similar Hofstadter butterfly states.\nAlthough newly generated second generation Dirac cones (SDCs) are believed to\nbe crucial for understanding such intriguing phenomena, so far fundamental\nknowledge of SDCs in such heterostructure, e.g. locations and dispersion of\nSDCs, the effect of inversion symmetry breaking on the gap opening, still\nremains highly debated due to the lack of direct experimental results. Here we\nreport first direct experimental results on the dispersion of SDCs in 0$^\\circ$\naligned graphene/h-BN heterostructure using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy. Our data reveal unambiguously SDCs at the corners of the\nsuperlattice Brillouin zone, and at only one of the two superlattice valleys.\nMoreover, gaps of $\\approx$ 100 meV and $\\approx$ 160 meV are observed at the\nSDCs and the original graphene Dirac cone respectively. Our work highlights the\nimportant role of a strong inversion symmetry breaking perturbation potential\nin the physics of graphene/h-BN, and fills critical knowledge gaps in the band\nstructure engineering of Dirac fermions by a superlattice potential.\n", "  We make three observations that help clarify the relation between CFT and\nquantum chaos. We show that any 1+1-D system in which conformal symmetry is\nnon-linearly realized exhibits two main characteristics of chaos: maximal\nLyapunov behavior and a spectrum of Ruelle resonances. We use this insight to\nidentify a lattice model for quantum chaos, built from parafermionic spin\nvariables with an equation of motion given by a Y-system. Finally we point to a\nrelation between the spectrum of Ruelle resonances of a CFT and the analytic\nproperties of OPE coefficients between light and heavy operators. In our model,\nthis spectrum agrees with the quasi-normal modes of the BTZ black hole.\n", "  Direct observation of vortex states confined in mesoscopic regular triangle\ndots of amorphous MoGe thin films was made with a scanning superconducting\nquantum interference device microscope. The observed magnetic images illustrate\nclearly how vortices are distributed over the triangle dots by forming not only\ncommensurate triangular clusters, but also unique patterns imposed by\nincommensurability. We discuss the results in terms of vortex shells and\nconstruct the packing sequence of vortices in the multiple shell structure.\n", "  We consider level crossing in a matrix family $H=H_0+\\lambda V$ where $H_0$\nis a fixed $N\\times N$ matrix and $V$ belongs to one of the standard Gaussian\nrandom matrix ensembles. We study the probability distribution of level\ncrossing points in the complex plane of $\\lambda$, for which we obtain a number\nof exact, asymptotic and approximate formulas.\n", "  In the first of these two lectures, I use a comparison to symplectic Khovanov\nhomology to motivate the idea that the Jones polynomial and Khovanov homology\nof knots can be defined by counting the solutions of certain elliptic partial\ndifferential equations in 4 or 5 dimensions. The second lecture is devoted to a\ndescription of the rather unusual boundary conditions by which these equations\nshould be supplemented. An appendix describes some physical background.\n(Versions of these lectures have been presented at various institutions\nincluding the Simons Center at Stonybrook, the TSIMF conference center in\nSanya, and also Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.)\n", "  The search for unconventional superconductivity has been focused on materials\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling and unique crystal lattices. Doped bismuth\nselenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$) is a strong candidate given the topological insulator\nnature of the parent compound and its triangular lattice. The coupling between\nthe physical properties in the superconducting state and its underlying crystal\nsymmetry is a crucial test for unconventional superconductivity. In this paper,\nwe report direct evidence that the superconducting magnetic response couples\nstrongly to the underlying 3-fold crystal symmetry in the recently discovered\nsuperconductor with trigonal crystal structure, niobium (Nb)-doped bismuth\nselenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$). More importantly, we observed that the magnetic\nresponse is greatly enhanced along one preferred direction spontaneously\nbreaking the rotational symmetry. Instead of a simple 3-fold crystalline\nsymmetry, the superconducting hysteresis loop shows dominating 2-fold and\n4-fold symmetry. This observation confirms the breaking of the rotational\nsymmetry and indicates the presence of nematic order in the superconducting\nground state of Nb-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Further, heat capacity measurements\ndisplay an exponential decay in superconducting state and suggest that there is\nno line node in the superconducting gap. These observations provide strong\nevidence of odd-parity topological superconductivity.\n", "  In this work, the $K\\bar{K}^*$ interaction is studied in a quasipotential\nBethe-Salpeter equation approach combined with the one-boson-exchange model.\nWith the help of the hidden-gauge Lagrangian, the exchanges of pseudoscalar\nmesons ($\\pi$ and $\\eta$) and vector mesons ($\\rho$, $\\omega$ and $\\phi$) are\nconsidered to describe the $K\\bar{K}^*$ interaction. Besides the direct\nvector-meson exchange which can be related to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term,\npseudoscalar-meson exchanges also play important roles in the mechanism of the\n$K\\bar{K}^*$ interaction. The poles of scattering amplitude are searched to\nfind the molecular states produced from the $K\\bar{K}^*$ interaction. In the\ncase of quantum number $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(1^{++})$, a pole is found with a\nreasonable cutoff, which can be related to the $f_1(1285)$ in experiment.\nAnother bound state with $0^-(1^{+-})$ is also produced from the $K\\bar{K}^*$\ninteraction, which can be related to the $h_1(1380)$. In the isovector sector,\nthe interaction is much weaker and a bound state with $1^+(1^{+})$ relevant to\nthe $b_1(1235)$ is produced but at a larger cutoff. Our results suggest that in\nthe hadronic molecular state picture the $f_1(1285)$ and $b_1(1235)$ are the\nstrange partners of the $X(3872)$ and $Z_c(3900)$, respectively.\n", "  We present a detailed study of local and non-local correlations in the\nelectronic structure of elemental transition metals carried out by means of the\nQuasiparticle Self-consistent GW (QSGW ) and Dynamical Mean Field Theory\n(DMFT). Recent high resolution ARPES and Haas-van Alphen data of two typical\ntransition metal systems (Fe and Ni) are used as case study. (i) We find that\nthe properties of Fe are very well described by QSGW. Agreement with cyclotron\nand very clean ARPES measurements is excellent, provided that final-state\nscattering is taken into account. This establishes the exceptional reliability\nof QSGW also in metallic systems. (ii) Nonetheless QSGW alone is not able to\nprovide an adequate description of the Ni ARPES data due to strong local spin\nfluctuations. We surmount this deficiency by combining nonlocal charge\nfluctuations in QSGW with local spin fluctuations in DMFT (QSGW + 'Magnetic\nDMFT'). (iii) Finally we show that the dynamics of the local fluctuations are\nactually not crucial. The addition of an external static field can lead to\nsimilarly good results if non-local correlations are included through QSGW.\n", "  Dispersive effects from strong $\\pi\\pi$ rescattering in the final state (FSI)\nof weak $K\\to\\pi\\pi$ decays are revisited with the goal to have a global view\non their {\\it relative} importance for the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule and the ratio\n$\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ in the Standard Model (SM). We point out that\nthis goal cannot be reached within a pure effective (meson) field approach like\nchiral perturbation theory in which the dominant current-current operators\ngoverning the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule and the dominant density-density (four-quark)\noperators governing $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ cannot be disentangled\nfrom each other. But in the context of a dual QCD approach, which includes both\nlong distance dynamics and the UV completion, that is QCD at short distance\nscales, such a distinction is possible. We find then that beyond the strict\nlarge $N$ limit, $N$ being the number of colours, FSI are likely to be\nimportant for the $\\Delta I=1/2$ rule but much less relevant for\n$\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$. The latter finding diminishes significantly\nhopes that improved calculations of $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$ would\nbring its SM prediction to agree with the experimental data, opening thereby an\narena for important new physics contributions to this ratio.\n", "  We study P-V criticality of black holes in Lovelock gravities in the context\nof horizon thermodynamics. The corresponding first law of horizon\nthermodynamics emerges as one of the Einstein-Lovelock equations and assumes\nthe universal (independent of matter content) form dE=TdS-PdV, where P is\nidentified with the total pressure of all matter in the spacetime (including a\ncosmological constant Lambda if present). We compare this approach to recent\nadvances in extended phase space thermodynamics of asymptotically AdS black\nholes where the \"standard\" first law of black hole thermodynamics is extended\nto include a pressure-volume term, where the pressure is entirely due to the\n(variable) cosmological constant. We show that both approaches are quite\ndifferent in interpretation. Provided there is sufficient non-linearity in the\ngravitational sector, we find that horizon thermodynamics admits the same\ninteresting black hole phase behaviour seen in the extended case, such as a\nHawking-Page transition, Van der Waals like behaviour, and the presence of a\ntriple point. We also formulate the Smarr formula in horizon thermodynamics and\ndiscuss the interpretation of the quantity E appearing in the horizon first\nlaw.\n", "  The present article significantly investigated projectiles lightest fragments\n(proton) multiplicity distribution and probability distribution with 84Kr36\nemulsion collision at around 1 A GeV. The multiplicity and normalized\nmultiplicity of projectiles lightest fragments (proton) is correlated with the\ncompound particles, shower particles, black particles, grey particles, helium\nfragments particles and heavily ionizing charged particles. It is found that\nprojectiles lightest fragments (proton) are strongly correlated with compound\nparticles and shower particles rather than other particles and the average\nmultiplicity of projectiles lightest fragments (proton) increases with\nincreasing compound, shower and heavy ionizing particles. Normalized\nprojectiles lightest fragments (proton) are strongly correlated with compound\nparticles, shower particles and heavy ionizing charge particles. The\nmultiplicity distribution of the projectiles lightest fragments (proton)\nemitted in the 84Kr36 + emulsion interaction at around 1 A GeV with different\ntarget has well explained by KNO scaling. The mean multiplicity of projectiles\nlightest fragments (proton) depends on the mass number of the projectile and\ndoes not significantly dependent of the projectile energy. The mean\nmultiplicity projectiles lightest fragment (proton) increases with increasing\nthe target mass number.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of visualizing stress waves\npropagating in plates using air-coupled acoustic emission sensors.\nSpecifically, we employ a device that embeds arrays of microphones around an\noptical lens in a helical pattern. By implementing a beamforming technique,\nthis remote sensing system allows us to record wave propagation events in situ\nvia a single-shot and full-field measurement. This is a significant improvement\nover the conventional wave propagation tracking approaches based on laser\ndoppler vibrometry or digital image correlation techniques. In this paper, we\nfocus on demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of this air-coupled\nacoustic emission technique using large metallic plates exposed to external\nimpacts. The visualization results of stress wave propagation will be shown\nunder various impact scenarios. Such wave visualization capability is of\ntremendous importance from a structural health monitoring and nondestructive\nevaluation (SHM/NDE) standpoint. The proposed technique can be used to\ncharacterize and localize damage by detecting the attenuation, reflection, and\nscattering of stress waves that occurs at damage locations. This can ultimately\nlead to the development of new SHM/NDE methods for identifying hidden cracks or\ndelaminations in metallic or composite plate structures simultaneously negating\nthe need for mounted contact sensors.\n", "  The electrical, in-plane resistance as a function of temperature $R(T)$ of\nbulk and mesoscopic thin graphite flakes obtained from the same batch was\ninvestigated. Samples thicker than $\\sim 30$ nm show metalliclike contribution\nin a temperature range that increases with the sample thickness, whereas a\nsemiconductinglike behavior was observed for thinner samples. The temperature\ndependence of the in-plane resistance of all measured samples and several\nothers from literature can be very well explained between 2 K and 1100 K\nassuming three contributions in parallel: a metalliclike conducting path at the\ninterfaces between crystalline regions, composed of two semiconducting phases,\ni.e. Bernal and rhombohedral stacking. From the fits of $R(T)$ we obtain a\nsemiconducting energy gap of $110 \\pm 20$meV for the rhombohedral and $38\\pm 8\n$meV for the Bernal phase. The presence of these crystalline phases was\nconfirmed by x-ray diffraction measurements. We review similar experimental\ndata from literature of the last 33 years and two more theoretical models used\nto fit $R(T)$.\n", "  Terahertz (THz) near-field imaging is a flourishing discipline [1], with\napplications from fundamental studies of beam propagation [2,3] to the\ncharacterisation of metameterials [4,5] and waveguides [6,7]. Beating the\ndiffraction limit typically involves rastering structures or detectors with\nlength scale shorter than the radiation wavelength; in the THz domain this has\nbeen achieved using a number of techniques including scattering tips [8,9] and\napertures [10]. Alternatively, mapping THz fields onto an optical wavelength\nand imaging the visible light removes the requirement for scanning a local\nprobe, speeding up image collection times [11,12]. Here we report THz to\noptical conversion using a gas of highly excited `Rydberg' atoms. By collecting\nTHz-induced optical fluorescence we demonstrate a real-time image of a THz\nstanding wave and we use well-known atomic properties to calibrate the THz\nfield strength. The mono-atomic gas does not distort the THz field and offers\nthe potential to immerse structures within the THz-to-optical conversion\nmedium.\n", "  We present new connections between quantum information and the field of\nclassical cryptography. In particular, we provide examples where Simon's\nalgorithm can be used to show insecurity of commonly used cryptographic\nsymmetric-key primitives. Specifically, these examples consist of a quantum\ndistinguisher for the 3-round Feistel network and a forgery attack on CBC-MAC\nwhich forges a tag for a chosen-prefix message querying only other messages (of\nthe same length). We assume that an adversary has quantum-oracle access to the\nrespective classical primitives. Similar results have been achieved recently in\nindependent work by Kaplan et al. Our findings shed new light on the\npost-quantum security of cryptographic schemes and underline that classical\nsecurity proofs of cryptographic constructions need to be revisited in light of\nquantum attackers.\n", "  We investigate the ExB diffusion of fusion born \\alpha particles in tokamak\nplasmas. We determine the transport regimes for a realistic model that has the\ncharacteristics of the ion temperature gradient (ITG) or of the trapped\nelectron modes (TEM) driven turbulence. It includes a spectrum of potential\nfluctuations that is modeled using the results of the numerical simulations,\nthe drift of the potential with the effective diamagnetic velocity and the\nparallel motion. Our semi-analytical statistical approach is based on the\ndecorrelation trajectory method (DTM), which is adapted to the gyrokinetic\napproximation. We obtain the transport coefficients as a function of the\nparameters of the turbulence and of the energy of the \\alpha particle.\nAccording to our results, signficant turbulent transport of the \\alpha\nparticles can appear only at energies of the order of 100KeV. We determine the\ncorresponding conditions.\n", "  Radio-frequency (rf) Paul traps operated with multifrequency rf trapping\npotentials provide the ability to independently confine charged particle\nspecies with widely different charge-to-mass ratios. In particular, these traps\nmay find use in the field of antihydrogen recombination, allowing antiproton\nand positron clouds to be trapped and confined in the same volume without the\nuse of large superconducting magnets. We explore the stability regions of\ntwo-frequency Paul traps and perform numerical simulations of small,\nmultispecies charged-particle mixtures that indicate the promise of these traps\nfor antihydrogen recombination.\n", "  We present a new scheme for quantum homomorphic encryption which is compact\nand allows for efficient evaluation of arbitrary polynomial-sized quantum\ncircuits. Building on the framework of Broadbent and Jeffery and recent results\nin the area of instantaneous non-local quantum computation, we show how to\nconstruct quantum gadgets that allow perfect correction of the errors which\noccur during the homomorphic evaluation of T gates on encrypted quantum data.\nOur scheme can be based on any classical (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE) scheme and requires no computational assumptions besides those already\nused by the classical scheme. The size of our quantum gadget depends on the\nspace complexity of the classical decryption function -- which aligns well with\nthe current efforts to minimize the complexity of the decryption function.\n  Our scheme (or slight variants of it) offers a number of additional\nadvantages such as ideal compactness, the ability to supply gadgets \"on\ndemand\", circuit privacy for the evaluator against passive adversaries, and a\nthree-round scheme for blind delegated quantum computation which puts only very\nlimited demands on the quantum abilities of the client.\n", "  Topological Weyl semimetal (TWS), a new state of quantum matter, has sparked\nenormous research interest recently. Possessing unique Weyl fermions in the\nbulk and Fermi arcs on the surface, TWSs offer a rare platform for realizing\nmany exotic physical phenomena. TWSs can be classified into type-I that respect\nLorentz symmetry and type-II that do not. Here, we directly visualize the\nelectronic structure of MoTe2, a recently proposed type-II TWS. Using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we unravel the unique\nsurface Fermi arcs, in good agreement with our ab-initio calculations. From\nspin-resolved ARPES measurements, we demonstrate the non-degenerate\nspin-texture of surface Fermi-arcs, thereby proving their non-trivial\ntopological nature. Our work not only lead to new understandings of the unusual\nproperties discovered in this family of compounds, but also allow for the\nfurther exploration of exotic properties and practical applications of type-II\nTWSs, as well as the interplay between superconductivity (MoTe2 was discovered\nto be superconducting recently) and their topological order.\n", "  Ensembles of solid-state optical emitters enable broadband quantum storage\nand transduction of photonic qubits, with applications in high-rate optical\nquantum networks for secure communications, global time-keeping, and\ninterconnecting future quantum computers. To realize coherent quantum\ninformation transfer using ensembles, spin rephasing techniques are currently\nused to mitigate fast decoherence resulting from inhomogeneous broadening. Here\nwe use a dense ensemble of neodymium rare-earth ions strongly coupled to a\nnanophotonic resonator to demonstrate that decoherence of a single photon\nexcitation is near-completely suppressed via cavity protection- a new technique\nfor accessing the decoherence-free subspace of collective coupling. The\nprotected Rabi oscillations between the cavity field and the atomic\nsuperradiant state thereby enable ultra-fast transfer of photonic frequency\nqubits (~50 GHz bandwidth) into the ions, followed by retrieval with 98.7%\nfidelity. By coupling the superradiant excitation to other long-lived\nrare-earth spin states, this technology will enable broadband, always-ready\nquantum memories and fast optical-to-microwave transducers.\n", "  We utilize machine learning models which are based on recurrent neural\nnetworks to optimize dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences. DD is a relatively\nsimple technique for suppressing the errors in quantum memory for certain noise\nmodels. In numerical simulations, we show that with minimum use of prior\nknowledge and starting from random sequences, the models are able to improve\nover time and eventually output DD-sequences with performance better than that\nof the well known DD-families. Furthermore, our algorithm is easy to implement\nin experiments to find solutions tailored to the specific hardware, as it\ntreats the figure of merit as a black box.\n", "  This paper investigates relationships between low-energy four-particle\nscattering amplitudes with external gauge particles and gravitons in the E_8 X\nE_8 and SO(32) heterotic string theories and the type I and type IA superstring\ntheories by considering a variety of tree level and one-loop Feynman diagrams\ndescribing such amplitudes in eleven-dimensional supergravity in a\nHorava--Witten background compactified on a circle. This accounts for a number\nof perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of low order higher derivative\nterms in the low-energy expansion of string theory amplitudes, which are\nexpected to be protected by half maximal supersymmetry from receiving\ncorrections beyond one or two loops. It also suggests the manner in which type\nI/heterotic duality may be realised for certain higher derivative interactions\nthat are not so obviously protected. For example, our considerations suggest\nthat R**4 interactions (where R is the Riemann curvature) might receive no\nperturbative corrections beyond one loop by virtue of a conspiracy involving\ncontributions from (non-BPS) Z2 D-instantons in the type I and heterotic SO(32)\ntheories.\n", "  The nickel--carbon system has received increased attention over the past\nyears due to the relevance of nickel as a catalyst for carbon nanotube and\ngraphene growth, where Nickel carbide intermediates may be involved or carbide\ninterface layers form in the end. Nickel--carbon composite thin films\ncomprising Ni$_3$C are especially interesting in mechanical sensing\napplications. Due to the meta-stability of nickel carbides, formation\nconditions and the coupling between mechanical and electrical properties are\nnot yet well understood. Using first-principles electronic structure methods,\nwe calculated the elastic properties of Ni$_3$C, Ni$_2$C and NiC, as well as\nchanges in electronic properties under mechanical strain. We observe that the\nelectronic density of states around the Fermi level does not change under the\nconsidered strains of up to 1%, which correspond to stresses up to 3GPa.\nRelative changes in conductivity of Ni$_3$C range up to maximum values of about\n10%.\n", "  In the present paper we have discussed in detail electromagnetically induced\ntransparency and signal storing in the case of one signal pulses propagating in\na classical electric medium resembling this of four-level atoms in the tripod\nconfiguration. Our theoretical results confirm recently observed dependence of\ntransparency windows position on coupling parameters. In the process of storing\nthe pulse energy is confined inside the metamaterial as electric charge\noscillations and after required time it is possible to switch the control\nfields on again and to release the trapped signal. By manipulating the driving\nfields one can thus control the parameters of the released signal and even to\ndivide it on demand into arbitrary parts.\n", "  We study the galaxy populations in 74 Sunyaev Zeldovich Effect (SZE) selected\nclusters from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey that have been imaged in\nthe science verification phase of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The sample\nextends up to $z\\sim 1.1$ with $4 \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}\\le M_{200}\\le\n3\\times 10^{15} M_{\\odot}$. Using the band containing the 4000~\\AA\\ break and\nits redward neighbor, we study the color-magnitude distributions of cluster\ngalaxies to $\\sim m_*+2$, finding: (1) the intrinsic rest frame $g-r$ color\nwidth of the red sequence (RS) population is $\\sim$0.03 out to $z\\sim0.85$ with\na preference for an increase to $\\sim0.07$ at $z=1$ and (2) the prominence of\nthe RS declines beyond $z\\sim0.6$. The spatial distribution of cluster galaxies\nis well described by the NFW profile out to $4R_{200}$ with a concentration of\n$c_{\\mathrm{g}} = 3.59^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, $5.37^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and\n$1.38^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$ for the full, the RS and the blue non-RS populations,\nrespectively, but with $\\sim40$\\% to 55\\% cluster to cluster variation and no\nstatistically significant redshift or mass trends. The number of galaxies\nwithin the virial region $N_{200}$ exhibits a mass trend indicating that the\nnumber of galaxies per unit total mass is lower in the most massive clusters,\nand shows no significant redshift trend. The red sequence (RS) fraction within\n$R_{200}$ is $(68\\pm3)$\\% at $z=0.46$, varies from $\\sim$55\\% at $z=1$ to\n$\\sim$80\\% at $z=0.1$, and exhibits intrinsic variation among clusters of\n$\\sim14$\\%. We discuss a model that suggests the observed redshift trend in RS\nfraction favors a transformation timescale for infalling field galaxies to\nbecome RS galaxies of 2 to 3~Gyr.\n", "  By introducing a temporal change timescale $\\tau_{\\text{A}}(t)$ for the\ntime-dependent system Hamiltonian, a general formulation of the Markovian\nquantum master equation is given to go well beyond the adiabatic regime. In\nappropriate situations, the framework is well justified even if\n$\\tau_{\\text{A}}(t)$ is faster than the decay timescale of the bath correlation\nfunction. An application to the dissipative Landau-Zener model demonstrates\nthis general result. The findings are applicable to a wide range of fields,\nproviding a basis for quantum control beyond the adiabatic regime.\n", "  We investigate the topological degeneracy that can be realized in Abelian\nfractional quantum spin Hall states with multiply connected gapped boundaries.\nSuch a topological degeneracy (also dubbed as \"boundary degeneracy\") does not\nrequire superconducting proximity effect and can be created by simply applying\na depletion gate to the quantum spin Hall material and using a generic\nspin-mixing term (e.g., due to backscattering) to gap out the edge modes. We\nconstruct an exactly soluble microscopic model manifesting this topological\ndegeneracy and solve it using the recently developed technique [S. Ganeshan and\nM. Levin, Phys. Rev. B 93, 075118 (2016)]. The corresponding string operators\nspanning this degeneracy are explicitly calculated. It is argued that the\nproposed scheme is experimentally reasonable.\n", "  We report about an intriguing boiling regime occurring for small heaters\nembedded on the boundary in subcooled water. The microheater is realized by\nfocusing a continuous wave laser beam to about $10\\,\\mu$m in diameter onto a\n165\\,nm-thick layer of gold, which is submerged in water. After an initial\nvaporous explosion a single bubble oscillates continuously and repeatably at\nseveral $100\\,$kHz. The microbubble's oscillations are accompanied with bubble\npinch-off leading to a stream of gaseous bubbles into the subcooled water. The\nself-driven bubble oscillation is explained with a thermally kicked oscillator\ncaused by the non-spherical collapses and by surface pinning. Additionally,\nMarangoni stresses induce a recirculating streaming flow which transports cold\nliquid towards the microheater reducing diffusion of heat along the substrate\nand therefore stabilizing the phenomenon to many million cycles. We speculate\nthat this oscillate boiling regime may allow to overcome the heat transfer\nthresholds observed during the nucleate boiling crisis and offers a new pathway\nfor heat transfer under microgravity conditions.\n", "  Motivated by the naturalness and neutrino mass generation, we study a\nbilinear R-parity violating supersymmetric scenario with a light Higgsino-like\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). We observe that the LSP dominantly\ndecays to $\\nu h$ in a large part of the parameter space, and thus study the\npair production of electroweakinos followed by the decays $\\tilde\\chi^\\pm_1\\to\n\\tilde\\chi^0_1 W^{\\pm*}$ and $\\tilde\\chi^0_1\\to \\nu h$. This leads to an\ninteresting signature of Higgs boson pair production associated with\nsignificantly large missing transverse energy which is grossly distinct from\nthe di-Higgs production in the Standard Model. We investigate the perspective\nof probing such signatures by performing a realistic detector level simulation\nof both the signal and corresponding backgrounds for the high-luminosity high\nenergy phase of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We also advocate some\nobservables based on kinematical features to provide an excellent handle to\nsuppress the backgrounds.\n", "  This paper reports on a measurement of the double-polarization observable G\nin $\\pi^0$ photoproduction off the proton using the CBELSA/TAPS experiment at\nthe ELSA accelerator in Bonn. The observable G is determined from reactions of\nlinearly-polarized photons with longitudinally-polarized protons. The polarized\nphotons are produced by bremsstrahlung off a properly oriented diamond\nradiator. A frozen spin butanol target provides the polarized protons. The data\ncover the photon energy range from 617 to 1325 MeV and a wide angular range.\nThe experimental results for G are compared to predictions by the Bonn-Gatchina\n(BnGa), J\\\"ulich-Bonn (J\\\"uBo), MAID and SAID partial wave analyses.\nImplications of the new data for the pion photoproduction multipoles are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The out-of-equilibrium dynamics of interaction quenched finite ultracold\nbosonic ensembles in periodically driven one-dimensional optical lattices is\ninvestigated. It is shown that periodic driving enforces the bosons in the\nouter wells of the finite lattice to exhibit out-of-phase dipole-like modes,\nwhile in the central well the atomic cloud experiences a local breathing mode.\nThe dynamical behavior is investigated with varying driving frequency,\nrevealing a resonant-like behavior of the intra-well dynamics. An interaction\nquench in the periodically driven lattice gives rise to admixtures of different\nexcitations in the outer wells, an enhanced breathing in the center and an\namplification of the tunneling dynamics. We observe then multiple resonances\nbetween the inter- and intra-well dynamics at different quench amplitudes, with\nthe position of the resonances being tunable via the driving frequency. Our\nresults pave the way for future investigations on the use of combined driving\nprotocols in order to excite different inter- and intra-well modes and to\nsubsequently control them.\n", "  The wide-ranging adoption of quantum technologies requires practical,\nhigh-performance advances in our ability to maintain quantum coherence while\nfacing the challenge of state collapse under measurement. Here we use\ntechniques from control theory and machine learning to predict the future\nevolution of a qubit's state; we deploy this information to suppress\nstochastic, semiclassical decoherence, even when access to measurements is\nlimited. First, we implement a time-division-multiplexed approach, interleaving\nmeasurement periods with periods of unsupervised but stabilised operation\nduring which qubits are available, for e.g. quantum information experiments.\nSecond, we employ predictive feedback during sequential but time delayed\nmeasurements to reduce the Dick effect as encountered in passive frequency\nstandards. Both experiments demonstrate significant improvements in qubit phase\nstability over \"traditional\" measurement-based feedback approaches by\nexploiting time domain correlations in the noise processes. This technique\nrequires no additional hardware and is applicable to all two-level quantum\nsystems where projective measurements are possible.\n", "  We analyze the mass spectrum of spin-2 excitations around the gravity duals\nof \"linear quiver\" supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFT's) in six\ndimensions. We show that for the entire family of gravity solutions it\nsatisfies a bound which corresponds to a unitarity bound for the scaling\ndimension of the dual field theory operators. We determine the masses of\nexcitations which belong to short multiplets, and for certain gravity solutions\nwe obtain the Kaluza-Klein modes and the corresponding mass spectrum, fully and\nexplicitly. Finally, we discuss an intuitive picture of the dual operators in\nterms of the effective descriptions of the SCFT's.\n", "  Very long, one-dimensional (1D) ion chains are the basis for many\napplications, in particular in quantum information processing and reliable\ndiagnostics are needed to quantify them. To that purpose, we have\nexperimentally validated Dubin's model for very long ion chains [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 71, 2753 (1993)]. This diagnostic allows to precisely determine the\nnumber of trapped ion with an accuracy of almost 1\\% without counting them, by\nmeasuring the ion-ion distance of the innermost particles, as well as the\ntrapping potential along the ion chain direction. In our experiment, based on a\n155 ion chain, the central 30 ions are measured to be equidistant to better\nthan 2\\%, and we can determine the total number of trapped ions with a 4.5\\%\nuncertainty, completely dominated by a conservative estimation of the\nexperimental characterisation of the trap.\n", "  Pion production in proton-nucleus (p+A) collisions outside the kinematical\nboundary of proton-nucleon (p+N) reactions, the so-called cumulative effect, is\nstudied. Restrictions from energy-momentum conservation on the energy of pions\nemitted in the backward direction in the target rest frame are analyzed. It is\nassumed that the cumulative pions are produced in p+A reactions by heavy\nbaryonic resonances. The baryonic resonances are first created in p+N\nreactions. Due to successive collisions with nuclear nucleons the masses of\nthese resonances may then increase and, simultaneously, their longitudinal\nvelocities decrease. We also use the Ultra relativistic Quantum Molecular\nDynamics model to reveal the key role of successive collisions of baryonic\nresonances with nuclear nucleons for cumulative pion production in p+A\nreactions. Further experimental studies of cumulative hadron production in p+A\nreactions at high collision energies are needed to search for heavy hadron-like\nobjects and investigate their properties.\n", "  We have performed the calculation of kaon regeneration based on the exact\nsolution of equations of motion. The result differs radically from the previous\none.\n", "  A double-layer integral equation for the surface tractions on a body moving\nin a viscous fluid is derived which allows for the incorporation of a\nbackground flow and/or the presence of a plane wall. The Lorentz reciprocal\ntheorem is used to link the surface tractions on the body to integrals\ninvolving the background velocity and stress fields on an imaginary bounding\nsphere (or hemisphere for wall-bounded flows). The derivation requires the\nvelocity and stress fields associated with numerous fundamental singularity\nsolutions which we provide for free-space and wall-bounded domains. Two sample\napplications of the method are discussed: we study the tractions on an\nellipsoid moving near a plane wall, which provides a more detailed\nunderstanding of the well-studied glancing and reversing trajectories in the\ncontext of particle sedimentation, and the erosion of bodies by a viscous flow,\nin which the surface is ablated at a rate proportional to the local viscous\nshear stress. Simulations and analytical estimates suggest that a spherical\nbody in a uniform flow first reduces nearly but not exactly to the drag\nminimizing profile and then vanishes in finite time. The shape dynamics of an\neroding body in a shear flow and near a wall are also investigated. Stagnation\npoints on the body surface lead generically to the formation of cusps, whose\nnumber depends on the flow configuration and/or the presence of nearby\nboundaries.\n", "  We prove that Schr\\\"odinger operators with meromorphic potentials\n$(H_{\\alpha,\\theta}u)_n=u_{n+1}+u_{n-1}+\n\\frac{g(\\theta+n\\alpha)}{f(\\theta+n\\alpha)} u_n$ have purely singular\ncontinuous spectrum on the set $\\{E: L(E)<\\delta{(\\alpha,\\theta)}\\}$, where\n$\\delta$ is an explicit function, and $L$ is the Lyapunov exponent. This\nextends results of Jitomirskaya and Liu for the Maryland model and of Avila,\nYou and Zhou for the almost Mathieu operator, to the general family of\nmeromorphic potentials.\n", "  We study the cosmological history of the classical conformal $B-L$ gauge\nextension of the standard model, in which the physical scales are generated via\nthe Coleman-Weinberg-type symmetry breaking. Especially, we consider the\nthermal phase transition of the U$(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry in the early universe and\nresulting gravitational-wave production. Due to the classical conformal\ninvariance, the phase transition tends to be a first-order one with\nultra-supercooling, which enhances the strength of the produced gravitational\nwaves. We show that, requiring (1) U$(1)_{B-L}$ is broken after the reheating,\n(2) the $B-L$ gauge coupling does not blow up below the Planck scale, (3) the\nthermal phase transition completes in almost all the patches in the universe,\nthe gravitational wave spectrum can be as large as $\\Omega_{\\rm GW} \\sim\n10^{-8}$ at the frequency $f \\sim 0.01$-$1$Hz for some model parameters, and a\nvast parameter region can be tested by future interferometer experiments such\nas eLISA, LISA, BBO and DECIGO.\n", "  In this paper the relativistic quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 neutral\nparticle with a magnetic moment $\\mu$ in the cosmic string spacetime is\nreexamined by applying the von Neumann theory of self--adjoint extensions.\nContrary to previous studies where the interaction between the spin and the\nline of charge is neglected, here we consider its effects. This interaction\ngives rise to a point interaction: $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}=\n(2\\lambda/\\alpha)\\delta(r)/r$. Due to the presence of the Dirac delta function,\nby applying an appropriated boundary condition provided by the theory of\nself--adjoint extensions, irregular solutions for the Hamiltonian are allowed.\nWe address the scattering problem obtaining the phase shift, S-matrix and the\nscattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude obtained shows a dependency with\nenergy which stems from the fact that the helicity is not conserved in this\nsystem. Examining the poles of the S-matrix we obtain an expression for the\nbound states. The presence of bound states for this system has not been\ndiscussed before in the literature.\n", "  MOND dynamics consists of a modification of the acceleration with respect to\nthe one provided by Newtonian mechanics. In this paper we investigate whether\nit can be derived from a velocity-dependent deformation of the coordinates of\nthe systems. The conclusion is that it cannot be derived this way because of\nthe intrinsic non-local character in time of the MOND procedure. This is a\nfeature pointed out some time ago already by Milgrom himself.\n", "  We perform a statistical analysis of strong gravitational lensing by quasar\nhosts of background galaxies, in the two competing models of dark matter halos\nof quasars, HOD and CS models. Utilizing the BolshoiP Simulation we demonstrate\nthat strong gravitational lensing provides a potentially very powerful test of\nmodels of quasar hosting halos. For quasars at $z=0.5$, the lensing probability\nby quasars of background galaxies in the HOD model is higher than that of the\nCS model by two orders of magnitude or more for lensing image separations in\nthe range of $\\theta\\sim 1.2-12~$arcsec. To observationally test this, we show\nthat, as an example, at the depth of the CANDELS wide field survey and with a\nquasar sample of $1000$ at $z=0.5$, the two models can be differentiated at\n$3-4\\sigma$ confidence level.\n", "  Hybrid dynamical systems characterized by discrete switching of smooth\ndynamics have been used to model various rhythmic phenomena. However, the phase\nreduction theory, a fundamental framework for analyzing the synchronization of\nlimit-cycle oscillations in rhythmic systems, has mostly been restricted to\nsmooth dynamical systems. Here we develop a general phase reduction theory for\nweakly perturbed limit cycles in hybrid dynamical systems that facilitates\nanalysis, control, and optimization of nonlinear oscillators whose smooth\nmodels are unavailable or intractable. On the basis of the generalized theory,\nwe analyze injection locking of hybrid limit-cycle oscillators by periodic\nforcing and reveal their characteristic synchronization properties, such as\nultrafast and robust entrainment to the periodic forcing and logarithmic\nscaling at the synchronization transition. We also illustrate the theory by\nanalyzing the synchronization dynamics of a simple physical model of biped\nlocomotion.\n", "  We present a completely numerical method of calculating one-loop amplitudes.\nOur approach is built upon two different existing methods: the contour\ndeformation and the extrapolation methods. Taking the best features of each of\nthem, we devise an intuitive, stable and robust procedure which circumvents the\nproblem of large cancellations and related numerical instabilities by\ncalculating the complete amplitude at once. As a proof of concept, we use our\nmethod to calculate the $2\\gamma \\to (N - 2)\\gamma$ benchmark process, as well\nas the Higgs decay amplitude $H \\to \\gamma \\gamma$.\n", "  Oxygen ($O_2$) is one of the most important elements required to sustain\nlife. The concentration of $O_2$ on Earth has been accumulated over millions of\nyears and has a direct connection with that of $CO_2$. Further, $CO_2$ plays an\nimportant role in many other planetary atmospheres. Therefore, molecular\nreactions involving $CO_2$ are critical for studying the atmospheres of such\nplanets. Existing studies on the dissociation of $CO_2$ are exclusively focused\non the C--O bond breakage. Here we report first experiments on the direct\nobservation of molecular Oxygen formation from $CO_2$ in strong laser fields\nwith a reaction microscope. Our accompanying simulations suggest that $CO_2$\nmolecules may undergo bending motion during and after strong-field ionization\nwhich supports the molecular Oxygen formation process. The observation of the\nmolecular Oxygen formation from $CO_2$ may trigger further experimental and\ntheoretical studies on such processes with laser pulses, and provide hints in\nstudies of the $O_2$ and $CO_2^+$ abundance in $CO_2$-dominated planetary\natmospheres.\n", "  One of the main obstacles that prevents practical applications of\nantiferromagnets is the difficulty of manipulating the magnetic order\nparameter. Recently, following the theoretical prediction [J. \\v{Z}elezn\\'y et\nal., PRL 113, 157201 (2014)], the electrical switching of magnetic moments in\nan antiferromagnet has been demonstrated [P. Wadley et al., Science 351, 587\n(2016)]. The switching is due to the so-called spin-orbit torque, which has\nbeen extensively studied in ferromagnets. In this phenomena a non-equilibrium\nspin-polarization exchange coupled to the ordered local moments is induced by\ncurrent, hence exerting a torque on the order parameter. Here we give a general\nsystematic analysis of the symmetry of the spin-orbit torque in locally and\nglobally non-centrosymmetric crystals. We study when the symmetry allows for a\nnonzero torque, when is the torque effective, and its dependence on the applied\ncurrent direction and orientation of magnetic moments. For comparison, we\nconsider both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders. In two representative\nmodel crystals we perform microscopic calculations of the spin-orbit torque to\nillustrate its symmetry properties and to highlight conditions under which the\nspin-orbit torque can be efficient for manipulating antiferromagnetic moments.\n", "  We use the OMEGA galactic chemical evolution code to investigate how the\nassumptions used for the treatment of galactic inflows and outflows impact\nnumerical predictions. The goal is to determine how our capacity to reproduce\nthe chemical evolution trends of a galaxy is affected by the choice of\nimplementation used to include those physical processes. In pursuit of this\ngoal, we experiment with three different prescriptions for galactic inflows and\noutflows and use OMEGA within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to recover the\nset of input parameters that best reproduces the chemical evolution of nine\nelements in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. This provides a consistent\nframework for comparing the best-fit solutions generated by our different\nmodels. Despite their different degrees of intended physical realism, we found\nthat all three prescriptions can reproduce in an almost identical way the\nstellar abundance trends observed in Sculptor. While the three models have the\nsame capacity to fit the data, the best values recovered for the parameters\ncontrolling the number of Type Ia supernovae and the strength of galactic\noutflows, are substantially different and in fact mutually exclusive from one\nmodel to another. For the purpose of understanding how a galaxy evolves, we\nconclude that only reproducing the evolution of a limited number of elements is\ninsufficient and can lead to misleading conclusions. More elements or\nadditional constraints such as the galaxy's star formation efficiency and the\ngas fraction are needed in order to break the degeneracy between the different\nmodeling assumptions. Our results show that the successes and failures of\nchemical evolution models are predominantly driven by the input stellar yields,\nrather than by the complexity of the galaxy model itself. Simple models such as\nOMEGA are therefore sufficient to test and validate stellar yields.\n", "  We investigate the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice\nwith an additional scalar chirality term and show that a chiral spin liquid is\nstabilized in a sizeable region of the phase diagram. This topological phase is\nsituated in between a coplanar $120^\\circ$ N\\'{e}el ordered and a non-coplanar\ntetrahedrally ordered phase. Furthermore we discuss the nature of the\nspin-disordered intermediate phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ model. We compare the\ngroundstates from Exact Diagonalization with a Dirac spin liquid wavefunction\nand propose a scenario where this wavefunction describes the quantum critical\npoint between the $120^\\circ$ magnetically ordered phase and a putative\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid.\n", "  Departing from the geodesic flow on a surface of negative curvature as a\nclassic example of the hyperbolic chaotic dynamics, we propose an electronic\ncircuit operating as a generator of rough chaos. Circuit simulation in NI\nMultisim software package and numerical integration of the model equations are\nprovided. Results of computations (phase trajectories, time dependences of\nvariables, Lyapunov exponents and Fourier spectra) show good correspondence\nbetween the chaotic dynamics on the attractor of the proposed system and of the\nAnosov dynamics for the original geodesic flow.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength study of GRB 151027A. This is the 999th GRB\ndetected by the Swift satellite and it has a densely sampled emission in the\nX-ray and optical band and has been observed and detected in the radio up to\n140 days after the prompt. The multiwavelength light curve from 500 s to 140\ndays can be modelled through a standard forward shock afterglow but requires an\nadditional component to reproduce the early X-ray and optical emission. We\npresent TNG and LBT optical observations performed 19.6, 33.9 and 92.3 days\nafter the trigger which show a bump with respect to a standard afterglow flux\ndecay and are possibly interpreted as due to the underlying SN and host galaxy\n(of 0.4 uJy in the R band). Radio observations, performed with SRT, Medicina,\nEVN and VLBA between day 4 and 140, suggest that the burst exploded in an\nenvironment characterised by a density profile scaling with the distance from\nthe source (wind profile). A remarkable feature of the prompt emission is the\npresence of a bright flare 100 s after the trigger, lasting 70 seconds in the\nsoft X-ray band, which was simultaneously detected from the optical band up to\nthe MeV energy range. By combining Swift-BAT/XRT and Fermi-GBM data, the\nbroadband (0.3-1000 keV) time resolved spectral analysis of the flare reveals\nthe coexistence of a non-thermal (power law) and thermal blackbody components.\nThe BB component contributes up to 35% of the luminosity in the 0.3-1000 keV\nband. The gamma-ray emission observed in Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM anticipates\nand lasts less than the soft X-ray emission as observed by Swift-XRT, arguing\nagainst a Comptonization origin. The BB component could either be produced by\nan outflow becoming transparent or by the collision of a fast shell with a\nslow, heavy and optically thick fireball ejected during the quiescent time\ninterval between the initial and later flares of the burst.\n", "  In very high energy collisions nuclei are practically transparent to each\nother but produce very hot, nearly baryon-free, matter in the so-called central\nrapidity region. The energy in the central rapidity region comes from the\nkinetic energy of the colliding nuclei. We calculate the energy and rapidity\nloss of the nuclei using the color glass condensate model. This model also\npredicts the excitation energy of the nuclear fragments. Using a space-time\npicture of the collision we calculate the baryon and energy densities of the\nreceding baryonic fireballs. For central collisions of gold nuclei at the\nhighest energy attainable at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, for example,\nwe find baryon densities more than ten times that of atomic nuclei over a large\nvolume.\n", "  We study the Goos-H\\\"anchen shifts for Dirac fermions in graphene scattered\nby a triangular double barrier potential. The massless Dirac-like equation was\nused to describe the scattered fermions by such potential configuration. Our\nresults show that the GHL shifts is affected by the geometrical structure of\nthe double barrier. In particular the GHL shifts change sign at the\ntransmission zero energies and exhibit enhanced peaks at each bound state\nassociated with the double barrier when the incident angle is less than the\ncritical angle associated with the total reflection.\n", "  We present a class of holographic models that behave effectively as\nprototypes of Mott insulators, materials where electron-electron interactions\ndominate transport phenomena. The main ingredient in the gravity dual is that\nthe gauge-field dynamics contains self-interactions by way of a particular type\nof non-linear electrodynamics. The electrical response in these models exhibits\ntypical features of Mott-like states: i) the low-temperature DC conductivity is\nunboundedly low; ii) metal-insulator transitions appear by varying various\nparameters; iii) for large enough self-interaction strength, the conductivity\ncan even decrease with increasing doping (density of carriers), which appears\nas a sharp manifestation of `traffic-jam'-like behaviour; iv) the insulating\nstate becomes very unstable towards superconductivity at large enough doping.\nWe exhibit some of the properties of the resulting insulator-superconductor\ntransition, which is sensitive to the amount of disorder in a specific way.\nThese models imply a clear and generic correlation between Mott behaviour and\nsignificant effects in the nonlinear electrical response. We compute the\nnonlinear current-voltage curve in our model and find that indeed at large\nvoltage the conductivity is largely reduced.\n", "  We construct a $p$-adic analog to AdS/CFT, where an unramified extension of\nthe $p$-adic numbers replaces Euclidean space as the boundary and a version of\nthe Bruhat-Tits tree replaces the bulk. Correlation functions are computed in\nthe simple case of a single massive scalar in the bulk, with results that are\nstrikingly similar to ordinary holographic correlation functions when expressed\nin terms of local zeta functions. We give some brief discussion of the geometry\nof $p$-adic chordal distance and of Wilson loops. Our presentation includes an\nintroduction to $p$-adic numbers.\n", "  Recent results on laser wakefield acceleration in tailored plasma channels\nhave underlined the importance of controlling the density profile of the gas\ntarget. In particular it was reported that appropriate density tailoring can\nresult in improved injection, acceleration and collimation of laser-accelerated\nelectron beams. To achieve such profiles innovative target designs are\nrequired. For this purpose we have reviewed the usage of additive layer\nmanufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, in order to produce gas jet\nnozzles. Notably we have compared the performance of two industry standard\ntechniques, namely selective laser sintering (SLS) and stereolithography (SLA).\nFurthermore we have used the common fused deposition modeling (FDM) to\nreproduce basic gas jet designs and used SLA and SLS for more sophisticated\nnozzle designs. The nozzles are characterized interferometrically and used for\nelectron acceleration experiments with the Salle Jaune terawatt laser at\nLaboratoire d'Optique Appliqu\\'ee.\n", "  The 10Be/7Be ratio is a sensitive tracer for the study of atmospheric\ntransport, particularly with regard to stratosphere-troposphere exchange.\nMeasurements with high accuracy and efficiency are crucial to 7Be and 10Be\ntracer studies. This article describes sample preparation procedures and\nanalytical benchmarks for 7Be and 10Be measurements at the Xian Accelerator\nMass Spectrometry (Xian-AMS) laboratory for the study of rainwater samples. We\ndescribe a sample preparation procedure to fabricate beryllium oxide (BeO) AMS\ntargets that includes co-precipitation, anion exchange column separation and\npurification. We then provide details for the AMS measurement of 7Be and 10Be\nfollowing the sequence BeO- -> Be2+ -> Be4+ in the Xian- AMS. The 10Be/7Be\nratio of rainwater collected in Xian is shown to be about 1.3 at the time of\nrainfall. The virtue of the method described here is that both 7Be and 10Be are\nmeasured in the same sample, and is suitable for routine analysis of large\nnumbers of rainwater samples by AMS.\n", "  Scaling solutions for the effective action in dilaton quantum gravity are\ninvestigated within the functional renormalization group approach. We find\nnumerical solutions that connect ultraviolet and infrared fixed points as the\nratio between scalar field and renormalization scale $k$ is varied. In the\nEinstein frame the quantum effective action corresponding to the scaling\nsolutions becomes independent of $k$.\n  The field equations derived from this effective action can be used directly\nfor cosmology. Scale symmetry is spontaneously broken by a non-vanishing\ncosmological value of the scalar field. For the cosmology corresponding to our\nscaling solutions, inflation arises naturally. The effective cosmological\nconstant becomes dynamical and vanishes asymptotically as time goes to\ninfinity.\n", "  Kuramoto and Battogtokh [Nonlinear Phenom. Complex Syst. 5, 380 (2002)]\ndiscovered chimera states represented by stable coexisting synchrony and\nasynchrony domains in a lattice of coupled oscillators. After reformulation in\nterms of local order parameter, the problem can be reduced to partial\ndifferential equations. We find uniformly rotating periodic in space chimera\npatterns as solutions of a reversible ordinary differential equation, and\ndemonstrate a plethora of such states. In the limit of neutral coupling they\nreduce to analytical solutions in form of one- and two-point chimera patterns\nas well as localized chimera solitons. Patterns at weakly attracting coupling\nare characterized by virtue of a perturbative approach. Stability analysis\nreveals that only simplest chimeras with one synchronous region are stable.\n", "  We show that three basic actor characteristics, namely normalized\nreciprocity, three cycles, and triplets, can be expressed using an unified\nframework that is based on computing the similarity index between two sets\nassociated with the actor: the set of her/his friends and the set of those\nconsidering her/him as a friend. These metrics are extended to multiplex\nnetworks and then computed for two friendship networks generated by collecting\ndata from two groups of undergraduate students. We found that in offline\ncommunication strong and weak ties are (almost) equally presented, while in\nonline communication weak ties are dominant. Moreover, weak ties are much less\nreciprocal than strong ties. However, across different layers of the multiplex\nnetwork reciprocities are preserved, while triads (measured with normalized\nthree cycles and triplets) are not significant.\n", "  The expression \"wage transition\" refers to the fact that over the past two or\nthree decades in all developed economies wage increases have levelled off.\nThere has been a widening divergence and decoupling between wages on the one\nhand and GDP per capita on the other hand. Yet, in China wages and GDP per\ncapita climbed in sync (at least up to now). In the first part of the paper we\npresent comparative statistical evidence which measures the extent of the wage\ntransition effect. In a second part we consider the reasons of this phenomenon,\nin particular we explain how the transfers of labor from low productivity\nsectors (such as agriculture) to high productivity sectors (such as\nmanufacturing) are the driver of productivity growth, particularly through\ntheir synergetic effects. Although rural flight represents only one of these\neffects, it is certainly the most visible because of the geographical\nrelocation that it implies; it is also the most well-defined statistically.\nMoreover, it will be seen that it is a good indicator of the overall\nproductivity and attractivity of the non-agricultural sector. Because this\nmodel accounts fairly well for the observed evolution in industrialized\ncountries, we use it to predict the rate of Chinese economic growth in the\ncoming decades. Our forecast for the average annual growth of real wages ranges\nfrom 4% to 6% depending on how well China will control the development of its\nhealthcare industry.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the stacked Suzaku observations of 47 galaxy\nclusters, spanning a redshift range of 0.01-0.45, to search for the\nunidentified 3.5 keV line. This sample provides an independent test for the\npreviously detected line. We detect only a 2sigma-significant spectral feature\nat 3.5 keV in the spectrum of the full sample. When the sample is divided into\ntwo subsamples (cool-core and non-cool core clusters), cool-core subsample\nshows no statistically significant positive residuals at the line energy. A\nvery weak (2sigma-confidence) spectral feature at 3.5 keV is permitted by the\ndata from the non-cool core clusters sample. The upper limit on a neutrino\ndecay mixing angle from the full Suzaku sample is consistent with the previous\ndetections in the stacked XMM-Newton sample of galaxy clusters (which had a\nhigher statistical sensitivity to faint lines), M31, and Galactic Center at a\n90% confidence level. However, the constraint from the present sample, which\ndoes not include the Perseus cluster, is in tension with previously reported\nline flux observed in the core of the Perseus cluster with XMM-Newton and\nSuzaku.\n", "  Optical excitation transfer in nanostructured matter has been intensively\nstudied in various material systems for versatile applications. Herein, we\ndiscuss the percolation of optical excitations in randomly organized\nnanostructures caused by optical near-field interactions governed by Yukawa\npotential in a two-dimensional stochastic model. The model results demonstrate\nthe appearance of two phases of percolation of optical excitation as a function\nof the localization degree of near-field interaction. Moreover, it indicates\nsublinear scaling with percolation distance when the light localization is\nstrong. The results provide fundamental insights into optical excitation\ntransfer and will facilitate the design and analysis of nanoscale\nsignal-transfer characteristics.\n", "  Entropy production and an effective viscosity in central Au+Au collisions are\nestimated in a wide range of incident energies 3.3 GeV $\\le \\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\le$\n39 GeV. The simulations are performed within a three-fluid model employing\nthree different equations of state with and without deconfinement transition,\nwhich are equally good in reproduction of the momentum-integrated elliptic flow\nof charged particles in the considered energy range. It is found that more that\n80\\% entropy is prodused during a short early collision stage which lasts\n$\\sim$1 fm/c at highest considered energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\ge$ 20 GeV. The\nestimated values of the viscosity-to-entropy ratio ($\\eta/s$) are approximately\nthe same in all considered scenarios. At final stages of the system expansion\nthey range from $\\sim$0.05 at highest considered energies to $\\sim$0.5 lowest\nones. It is found that the $\\eta/s$ ratio decreases with the temperature ($T$)\nrise approximately as $\\sim 1/T^4$ and exhibits a rather weak dependence on the\nnet-baryon density.\n", "  We develop a theory for the analytic computation of the free energy of band\ninsulators in the presence of a uniform and constant electric field. The two\nkey ingredients are a perturbation-like expression of the Wannier-Stark energy\nspectrum of electrons and a modified statistical mechanics approach involving a\nlocal chemical potential in order to deal with the unbounded spectrum and\nimpose the physically relevant electronic filling. At first order in the field,\nwe recover the result of King-Smith, Vanderbilt and Resta for the electric\npolarization in terms of a Zak phase - albeit at finite temperature - and, at\nsecond order, deduce a general formula for the electric susceptibility, or\nequivalently for the dielectric constant. Advantages of our method are the\nvalidity of the formalism both at zero and finite temperature and the easy\ncomputation of higher order derivatives of the free energy. We verify our\nfindings on two different one-dimensional tight-binding models.\n", "  In this work we introduce a general scheme for measurement based quantum\ncomputation in continuous variables. Our approach does not necessarily rely on\nthe use of ancillary cluster states to achieve its aim, but rather on the\ndetection of a resource state in a suitable mode basis followed by digital\npost-processing, and involves an optimization of the adjustable experimental\nparameters. After introducing the general method, we present some examples of\napplication to simple specific computations.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the anisotropy of the spin relaxation and\ndecoherence in typical quantum wells with an arbitrary magnetic field. In such\nsystems, the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the main\ncrystallographic directions is crucial, owing to the lack of spin-rotation\nsymmetry. For typical high mobility samples, relaxation anisotropies in the\nmotional narrowing limit owing to the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin\norbit coupling are calculated. We also include the effect of the\ncubic-in-momentum terms. Although commonly ignored in literature, the latter\nwere experimentally evidenced by the observation of strong anisotropy in spin\ndecoherence measurements by different experimental groups and has long remained\nunexplained.\n", "  Commonly, a two-dimensional topological insulator is characterized by\nnon-zero Chern numbers associated with its band structure. In our work, we\npresent the experimental demonstration of an anomalous topological insulator,\nfor which the Chern numbers are always zero, and the winding number is the\nappropriate quantity describing the topological character of the system. We\nprobe the robustness of the chiral edge states in such anomalous topological\ninsulators and analyze the phase transition between topological and trivial\nphase.\n", "  The flow driven by a rapidly expanding and collapsing cavitation bubble in a\nnarrow cylindrical gap is studied with the volume of fluid method. The\nsimulations reveal a developing plug flow during the early expansion followed\nby flow reversal at later stages. An adverse pressure gradient leads to\nboundary layer separation and flow reversal, causing large shear stress near\nthe boundaries. Analytical solution to a planar pulsating flow shows\nqualitative agreement with the CFD results. The shear stress close to\nboundaries has implications to deformable objects located near the bubble:\nexperiments reveal that thin, flat biological cells entrained in the boundary\nlayer become stretched, while cells with a larger cross-section are mainly\ntransported with the flow.\n", "  The only one example has been known of magnetic geodesic flow on the 2-torus\nwhich has a polynomial in momenta integral independent of the Hamiltonian. In\nthis example the integral is linear in momenta and corresponds to a one\nparametric group preserving the Lagrangian function of the magnetic flow. In\nthis paper the problem of integrability on one energy level is considered. This\nproblem can be reduced to a remarkable Semi-hamiltonian system of quasi-linear\nPDEs and to the question of existence of smooth periodic solutions for this\nsystem. Our main result states that the pair of Liouville metric with zero\nmagnetic field on the 2-torus can be analytically deformed to a Riemannian\nmetric with small magnetic field so that the magnetic geodesic flow on an\nenergy level is integrable by means of a quadratic in momenta integral. Thus\nour construction gives a new example of smooth periodic solution to the\nSemi-hamiltonian (Rich) quasi-linear system of PDEs.\n", "  We present the results of a study of the diffusion of Rb atoms in paraffin -\ncoated resonant vapor cells. We have modeled the Rb diffusion both in the cell\nand in the coating, assuming that the main loss of Rb atoms is due to the\nphysical absorption of the atoms by the glass substrate. It is demonstrated\nthat the equilibrium atomic density in the cell is a monotonic function of the\nthickness of the paraffin coating: the density increases with an increase in\nthe thickness of the coating. The diffusion coefficient for rubidium in\nparaffin thin films has been determined to be equal to 4,7*10^-7 cm^2/s. The\nresults of the experiment might be useful for a better understanding of the\ndetails involved in the processes of the interaction of alkali atoms with a\nparaffin coating.\n", "  Based on the recent indications of integrability in the planar ABJ model, we\nconjecture an exact expression for the interpolating function\nh(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2) in this theory. Our conjecture is based on the\nobservation that the integrability structure of the ABJM theory given by its\nQuantum Spectral Curve is very rigid and does not allow for a simple consistent\nmodification. Under this assumption, we revised the previous comparison of\nlocalization results and exact all loop integrability calculations done for the\nABJM theory by one of the authors and Grigory Sizov, fixing\nh(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2). We checked our conjecture against various weak coupling\nexpansions, at strong coupling and also demonstrated its invariance under the\nSeiberg-like duality. This match also gives further support to the\nintegrability of the model. If our conjecture is correct, it extends all the\navailable integrability results in the ABJM model to the ABJ model.\n", "  Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy is used to investigate the\nmagnetic state of the Fe monolayer on Re(0001). Two coexisting atomic-scale\nnon-collinear spin textures are observed with a sharp transition between them\non the order of one atomic lattice spacing. A strict position correlation\nbetween the two spin states is observed both in experiments and in Monte Carlo\nsimulations, demonstrating their strong coupling behavior.\n", "  We present new Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging of 25\nextremely luminous (-23.2 < M_ UV < -21.2) Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z ~\n7. The sample was initially selected from 1.65 deg^2 of ground-based imaging in\nthe UltraVISTA/COSMOS and UDS/SXDS fields, and includes the extreme Lyman-alpha\nemitters, `Himiko' and `CR7'. A deconfusion analysis of the deep Spitzer\nphotometry available suggests that these galaxies exhibit strong rest-frame\noptical nebular emission lines (EW_0(H_beta + [OIII]) > 600A). We find that\nirregular, multiple-component morphologies suggestive of clumpy or merging\nsystems are common (f_multi > 0.4) in bright z ~ 7 galaxies, and ubiquitous at\nthe very bright end (M_UV < -22.5). The galaxies have half-light radii in the\nrange r_1/2 ~ 0.5-3 kpc. The size measurements provide the first determination\nof the size-luminosity relation at z ~ 7 that extends to M_UV ~ -23. We find\nthe relation to be steep with r_1/2 ~ L^1/2. Excluding clumpy, multi-component\ngalaxies however, we find a shallower relation that implies an increased\nstar-formation rate surface density in bright LBGs. Using the new, independent,\nHST/WFC3 data we confirm that the rest-frame UV luminosity function at z ~ 7\nfavours a power-law decline at the bright-end, compared to an exponential\nSchechter function drop-off. Finally, these results have important implications\nfor the Euclid mission, which we predict will detect > 1000 similarly bright\ngalaxies at z ~ 7. Our new HST imaging suggests that the vast majority of these\ngalaxies will be spatially resolved by Euclid, mitigating concerns over dwarf\nstar contamination.\n", "  The scaling behavior of the order parameter at the chiral phase transition,\nthe so-called magnetic equation of state, of strongly interacting matter is\nstudied within effective models. We explore universal and nonuniversal\nstructures near the critical point. These include the scaling functions, the\nleading corrections to scaling, and the corresponding size of the scaling\nwindow as well as their dependence on an external symmetry breaking field. We\nconsider two models in the mean-field approximation, the quark-meson and the\nPolyakov loop extended quark-meson (PQM) models, and compare their critical\nproperties with a purely bosonic theory, the $O(N)$ linear sigma model in the\n$N\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit. In these models the order parameter scaling\nfunction is found analytically using the high temperature expansion of the\nthermodynamic potential. The effects of a gluonic background on the\nnonuniversal scaling parameters are studied within the PQM model.\n", "  We study effects of a chiral helimagnet (CHM) on vortex states in a\nsuperconductor, solving the Ginzburg-Landau equations in a chiral\nhelimagnet/superconductor bilayer system. We found that vortices form a\nperiodically modulated triangular lattice, because the magnetic field from the\nchiral helimagnet $H_{CHM}$ oscillates spatially. An increase of a critical\ncurrent is expected, because vortices are pinned by the $H_{CHM}$.\n", "  A solvable molecular collision model that predicts Aharonov-Bohm (AB) like\nscattering in the adiabatic approximation is introduced. For it, we propagate\ncoupled channel wave packets without resorting to a Born-Oppenheimer (BO)\napproximation. In those, exact, solutions we find evidence of topological phase\ndislocation lines that are independent of the collision energy and provide\ndefinitive signatures of AB-like scattering. The results of these simulations\ncontrast with the conclusions of a recent study that suggests survival of the\nmolecular Aharonov-Bohm (MAB) effect only in the adiabatic limit in which the\nnuclear reduced mass $\\mu \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n  We discuss generalizations of this model and consider possible screening of\nthe Mead-Truhlar vector potential by the presence of multiple conical\nintersections (CI). We demonstrate that the Wilson loop phase integral has the\nvalue $-1$ if it encloses an odd-number of CI's, and takes the value $+1$ for\nan even number. Within the scope of this model, we investigate the ultra-cold\nlimit of scattering solutions in the presence of a conical intersection and\ncomment on the relevance of Wigner threshold behavior for s-wave scattering.\n", "  We consider the partition function of super Yang-Mills theories defined on\n$T^2 \\times \\Sigma_g$. This path integral can be computed by the localization.\nThe one-loop determinant is evaluated by the elliptic genus. This elliptic\ngenus gives trivial result in our calculation. As a result, we obtain a theory\ndefined on the Riemann surface.\n", "  We make a scalar representation of interactive models with cold dark matter\nand modified holographic Ricci dark energy through unified models driven by\nscalar fields with non-canonical kinetic term. These models are applications of\nthe formalism of exotic k-essences generated by the global description of\ncosmological models with two interactive fluids in the dark sector and in these\ncases they correspond to usual k-essences. The formalism is applied to the\ncases of constant potential in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometries.\n", "  We study the effect of interactions on the Hofstadter butterfly of the\nhoneycomb lattice. We show that the interactions induce charge ordering that\nbreaks the translational and rotational symmetries of the system. These phase\ntransitions are prolific and occur at many values of the flux and particle\ndensity. The breaking of the translational symmetry introduces a new length\nscale in the problem and this affects the energy band diagram resulting in the\ndisintegration of the fractal structure in the energy flux plot, the Hofstadter\nbutterfly. This disintegration increases with increase in the interaction\nstrength. Many of these phase transitions are accompanied with change in the\nHall conductivity. Consequently, the disintegration of the Hofstadter butterfly\nis manifested in the Landau fan diagram also.\n", "  The High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HIGS) at Duke University is an\naccelerator-driven Compton gamma-ray source, providing high flux gamma-ray beam\nfrom 1 MeV to 100 MeV for photo-nuclear physics research. The HIGS facility\noperates three accelerators, a linac pre-injector (0.16 GeV), a booster\ninjector (0.16-1.2 GeV), and an electron storage ring (0.24-1.2 GeV). Because\nof proximity of the booster injector to the storage ring, the magnetic field of\nthe booster dipoles close to the ring can significantly alter the closed orbit\nin the storage ring being operated in the low energy region. This type of orbit\ndistortion can be a problem for certain precision experiments which demand a\nhigh degree of the energy consistency of the gamma-ray beam. This energy\nconsistency can be achieved by maintaining consistent aiming of the gamma-ray\nbeam, therefore, a steady electron beam orbit and angle at the Compton\ncollision point. To overcome the booster leakage field problem, we have\ndeveloped an orbit compensation scheme. This scheme is developed using two fast\norbit correctors and implemented as a feedforward which is operated\ntransparently together with the slow orbit feedback system. In this paper, we\nwill describe the development of this leakage field compensation scheme, and\nreport the measurement results which have demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nscheme.\n", "  Traditionally, covariant scalar field theory models are either super\nrenormalizable, strictly renormalizable, or nonrenormalizable. The goal of\n`Mixed Models' is to make sense of sums of these distinct examples, e.g.,\n$g\\varphi^4_3+g'\\varphi^6_3+g''\\varphi^8_3$, which includes an example of each\nkind for spacetime dimension $n=3$. We show how the several interactions such\nmixed models have may be turned on and off in any order without any\ndifficulties. Analogous results are shown for $g\\varphi^4_n+g'\\varphi^{138}_n$,\netc., for all $n\\ge3$. Different categories hold for $n=2$ such as, e.g., ${g\nP(\\varphi)_2+g' N\\!P}(\\varphi)_2$, that involve polynomial ($P$) and suitable\nnonpolynomial ($N\\!P$) interactions, etc. Analogous situations for $n=1$ (time\nalone) offer simple `toy' examples of how such mixed models may be constructed.\n", "  Conventional nonlinear spectroscopy uses classical light to detect matter\nproperties through the variation of its response with frequencies or time\ndelays. Quantum light opens up new avenues for spectroscopy by utilizing\nparameters of the quantum state of light as novel control knobs and through the\nvariation of photon statistics by coupling to matter. We present an intuitive\ndiagrammatic approach for calculating ultrafast spectroscopy signals induced by\nquantum light, focusing on applications involving entangled photons with\nnonclassical bandwidth properties - known as \"time-energy entanglement\".\nNonlinear optical signals induced by quantized light fields are expressed using\ntime ordered multipoint correlation functions of superoperators. These are\ndifferent from Glauber's g- functions for photon counting which use normally\nordered products of ordinary operators. Entangled photon pairs are not\nsubjected to the classical Fourier limitations on the joint temporal and\nspectral resolution. After a brief survey of properties of entangled photon\npairs relevant to their spectroscopic applications, different optical signals,\nand photon counting setups are discussed and illustrated for simple multi-level\nmodel systems.\n", "  The rare-earth monopnictide LaBi exhibits exotic magneto-transport properties\nincluding an extremely large and anisotropic magnetoresistance. Experimental\nevidence for topological surface states is still missing although band\ninversions have been postulated to induce a topological phase in LaBi. By\nemploying angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in conjunction with\n$ab~initio$ calculations, we have revealed the existence of surface states of\nLaBi through the observation of three Dirac cones: two coexist at the corners\nand one appears at the center of the Brillouin zone. The odd number of surface\nDirac cones is a direct consequence of the odd number of band inversions in the\nbulk band structure, thereby proving that LaBi is a topological, compensated\nsemi-metal, which is equivalent to a time-reversal invariant topological\ninsulator. Our findings provide insight into the topological surface states of\nLaBi's semi-metallicity and related magneto-transport properties.\n", "  Recent experimental and theoretical efforts have focused on the effect of\ndissipation on quantum many-body systems in their many-body localized (MBL)\nphase. While in the presence of dephasing noise such systems reach a unique\nergodic state, their dynamics is characterized by slow relaxation manifested in\nnon-exponential decay of self-correlations. Here we shed light on a currently\nmuch debated issue, namely the role of interactions for this relaxation\ndynamics. We focus on the experimentally relevant situation of the evolution\nfrom an initial charge density wave in the presence of strong dephasing noise.\nWe find a crossover from a regime dominated by disorder to a regime dominated\nby interactions, with a concomitant change of time correlators from stretched\nexponential to compressed exponential form. The strongly interacting regime can\nbe explained in terms of nucleation and growth dynamics of relaxing regions -\nreminiscent of the kinetics of crystallization in soft matter systems - and\nshould be observable experimentally. This interaction-driven crossover suggests\nthat the competition between interactions and noise give rise to a much richer\nstructure of the MBL phase than anticipated so far.\n", "  We analyze the decays $K\\to\\pi\\ell\\nu$ and $P\\to\\ell\\nu$ ($P=K,\\pi$,\n$\\ell=e,\\,\\mu$) using a low-energy Effective-Field-Theory approach to\nparametrize New Physics and study the complementarity with baryon $\\beta$\ndecays. We then provide a road map for a global analysis of the experimental\ndata, with all the Wilson coefficients simultaneously, and perform a fit\nleading to numerical bounds for them and for $V_{us}$. A prominent result of\nour analysis is a reinterpretation of the well-known $V_{ud}-V_{us}$ diagram as\na strong constraint on new physics. Finally, we reinterpret our bounds in terms\nof the $SU(2)_L\\times~U(1)_Y$-invariant operators, provide bounds to the\ncorresponding Wilson coefficients at the TeV scale and compare our results with\ncollider searches at the LHC.\n", "  In this paper we study the existence of vortex-type solutions for a system of\nself-dual equations deduced from the mass-deformed\nAharony--Bergman--Jafferis--Maldacena (ABJM) model. The governing equations,\nderived by Mohammed, Murugan, and Nastse under suitable ansatz involving fuzzy\nsphere matrices, have the new feature that they can support only\nnon-topological vortex solutions. After transforming the self-dual equations\ninto a nonlinear elliptic $2\\times 2$ system we prove first an existence result\nby means of a perturbation argument based on a new and appropriate scaling for\nthe solutions. Subsequently, we prove a more complete existence result by using\na dynamical analysis together with a blow-up argument. In this way we establish\nthat, any positive energy level is attained by a 1-parameter family of vortex\nsolutions which also correspond to (constraint) energy minimizers. In other\nwords, we register the exceptional fact in a BPS-setting that, neither a\n\"quantization\" effect nor an energy gap is induced upon the system by the rigid\n\"critical\" coupling of the self-dual regime.\n", "  We have investigated microwave nonreciprocity in a noncentro-symmetric magnet\nCuB2O4. We simultaneously observed differently originated nonreciprocities; the\nclassical magnetic dipolar effect and the magneto-chiral (MCh) effect. By\nrotating magnetic field in a tetragonal plane, we clearly unveil qualitative\ndifference between them. The MCh effect signal reveals chiral transitions from\none enantiomer to the other via intermediate achiral state. We show\nmagnetoelectric effect plays an essential role for the emergence of microwave\nMCh effect.\n", "  Godunov Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (Godunov SPH) method is a\ncomputational fluid dynamics method that utilizes a Riemann solver and achieves\nthe second-order accuracy in space. In this paper, we extend the Godunov SPH\nmethod to elastic dynamics by incorporating deviatoric stress tensor that\nrepresents the stress for shear deformation or anisotropic compression.\nAnalogously to the formulation of the original Godunov SPH method, we formulate\nthe equation of motion, the equation of energy, and the time evolution equation\nof deviatoric stress tensor so that the resulting discretized system achieves\nthe second-order accuracy in space. The standard SPH method tends to suffer\nfrom the tensile instability that results in unphysical clustering of particles\nespecially in tension-dominated region. We find that the tensile instability\ncan be suppressed by selecting appropriate interpolation for density\ndistribution in the equation of motion for the Godunov SPH method even in the\ncase of elastic dynamics. Several test calculations for elastic dynamics are\nperformed, and the accuracy and versatility of the present method are shown.\n", "  We discuss, from a quantum information perspective, recent proposals of\nMaldacena, Ryu, Takayanagi, van Raamsdonk, Swingle, and Susskind that spacetime\nis an emergent property of the quantum entanglement of an associated boundary\nquantum system. We review the idea that the informational principle of minimal\ncomplexity determines a dual holographic bulk spacetime from a minimal quantum\ncircuit U preparing a given boundary state from a trivial reference state. We\ndescribe how this idea may be extended to determine the relationship between\nthe fluctuations of the bulk holographic geometry and the fluctuations of the\nboundary low-energy subspace. In this way we obtain, for every quantum system,\nan Einstein-like equation of motion for what might be interpreted as a bulk\ngravity theory dual to the boundary system.\n", "  The T2K off-axis near detector, ND280, is used to make the first differential\ncross section measurements of muon neutrino charged current single positive\npion production on a water target at energies ${\\sim}0.8$ GeV. The differential\nmeasurements are presented as a function of muon and pion kinematics, in the\nrestricted phase-space defined by $p_{\\pi^+}>200$MeV/c, $p_{\\mu^-}>200$MeV/c,\n$\\cos \\theta_{\\pi^+}>0.3$ and $\\cos \\theta_{\\mu^-}>0.3$. The total flux\nintegrated $\\nu_\\mu$ charged current single positive pion production cross\nsection on water in the restricted phase-space is measured to be\n$\\langle\\sigma\\rangle_\\phi=4.25\\pm0.48 (\\mathrm{stat})\\pm1.56\n(\\mathrm{syst})\\times10^{-40} \\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{nucleon}$. The total\ncross section is consistent with the NEUT prediction ($5.03\\times10^{-40}\n\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{nucleon}$) and 2$\\sigma$ lower than the GENIE\nprediction ($7.68\\times10^{-40} \\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{nucleon}$). The\ndifferential cross sections are in good agreement with the NEUT generator. The\nGENIE simulation reproduces well the shapes of the distributions, but\nover-estimates the overall cross section normalization.\n", "  We present the implementation of several color-singlet final-state processes\nat Next-to-Next-to Leading Order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD to the publicly\navailable parton-level Monte Carlo program MCFM. Specifically we discuss the\nprocesses $pp\\rightarrow H$, $pp\\rightarrow Z$, $pp\\rightarrow W$,\n$pp\\rightarrow HZ$, $pp\\rightarrow HW$ and $pp\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$. Decays\nof the unstable bosons are fully included, resulting in a flexible fully\ndifferential Monte Carlo code. The NNLO corrections have been calculated using\nthe non-local $N$-jettiness subtraction approach. Special attention is given to\nthe numerical aspects of running MCFM for these processes at this order. We pay\nparticular attention to the systematic uncertainties due to the power\ncorrections induced by the $N$-jettiness regularization scheme and the\nevaluation time needed to run the hybrid openMP/MPI version of MCFM at NNLO on\nmulti-processor systems.\n", "  To predict the jet mass spectrum at a hadron collider it is crucial to\naccount for the resummation of logarithms between the transverse momentum of\nthe jet and its invariant mass $m_J$. For small jet areas there are additional\nlarge logarithms of the jet radius $R$, which affect the convergence of the\nperturbative series. We present an analytic framework for exclusive jet\nproduction at the LHC which gives a complete description of the jet mass\nspectrum including realistic jet algorithms and jet vetoes. It factorizes the\nscales associated with $m_J$, $R$, and the jet veto, enabling in addition the\nsystematic resummation of jet radius logarithms in the jet mass spectrum beyond\nleading logarithmic order. We discuss the factorization formulae for the peak\nand tail region of the jet mass spectrum and for small and large $R$, and the\nrelations between the different regimes and how to combine them. Regions of\nexperimental interest are classified which do not involve large nonglobal\nlogarithms. We also present universal results for nonperturbative effects and\ndiscuss various jet vetoes.\n", "  We present a simple dynamical model for describing trading interactions\nbetween agents in a social network by considering only two dynamical variables,\nnamely money and goods or services, that are assumed conserved over the whole\ntime span of the agents' trading transactions. A key feature of the model is\nthat agent-to-agent transactions are governed by the price in units of money\nper goods, which is dynamically changing, and by a trust variable, which is\nrelated to the trading history of each agent. All agents are able to sell or\nbuy, and the decision to do either has to do with the level of trust the buyer\nhas in the seller, the price of the goods and the amount of money and goods at\nthe disposal of the buyer. Here we show the results of extensive numerical\ncalculations under various initial conditions in a random network of agents and\ncompare the results with the available related data. In most cases the\nagreement between the model results and real data turns out to be fairly good,\nwhich allow us to draw some general conclusions as how different trading\nstrategies could affect the distribution of wealth in different kinds of\nsocieties.\n", "  Due to seminal works of Weinberg, Cachazo and Strominger we know that tree\nlevel quantum gravity amplitudes satisfy three factorization constraints.\nBuilding on previous works which relate two of these constraints to symmetries\nof quantum gravity at null infinity, we present rather strong evidence that the\nthird constraint is also equivalent to a new set of symmetries of\n(perturbative) quantum gravity. Our analysis implies that the symmetry group of\nquantum gravity may be even richer than the BMS group (or infinite dimensional\nextension thereof) previously considered.\n", "  The fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum are one of the most powerful\nmanifestations of the quantum structure of nature. Their effect on the Dirac\nelectrons of graphene is known to induce some spectacular and purely quantistic\nphenomena, like the Casimir and the Aharanov--Bohm effects. In this work we\ndemonstrate, by using a first principles approach, that the Dirac cone of\ngraphene is also affected by a sizable Lamb shift.We show that the microscopic\nelectronic currents flowing on the graphene plane couple efficiently with the\nvacuum fluctuations causing a renormalization of the electronic levels (as\nlarge as 4 meV) and of the velocities. This Lamb shift is one order of\nmagnitude larger than the value predicted for an isolated carbon atom.\n", "  We consider short range correlations in excited states of the finite XXZ and\nXXX Heisenberg spin chains. We conjecture that the known results for the\nfactorized ground state correlations can be applied to the excited states too,\nif the so-called physical part of the construction is changed appropriately.\nFor the ground state we derive simple algebraic expressions for the physical\npart; the formulas only use the ground state Bethe roots as an input. We\nconjecture that the same formulas can be applied to the excited states as well,\nif the exact Bethe roots of the excited states are used instead. In the XXZ\nchain the results are expected to be valid for all states (except certain\nsingular cases where regularization is needed), whereas in the XXX case they\nonly apply to singlet states or group invariant operators. Our conjectures are\ntested against numerical data from exact diagonalization and coordinate Bethe\nAnsatz calculations, and perfect agreement is found in all cases. In the XXX\ncase we also derive a new result for the nearest-neighbour correlator\n$\\{\\sigma_1^z\\sigma_2^z\\}$, which is valid for non-singlet states as well. Our\nresults build a bridge between the known theory of factorized correlations, and\nthe recently conjectured TBA-like description for the building blocks of the\nconstruction.\n", "  In bounce inflation scenario, the inflation is singularity-free, while the\nadvantages of inflation are reserved. We analytically calculate the power\nspectrum of its primordial gravitational waves (GWs), and show a universal\nresult including the physics of the bounce phase. The spectrum acquires a\ncutoff at large scale, while the oscillation around the cutoff scale is quite\ndrastic, which is determined by the details of bounce. Our work highlights that\nthe primordial GWs at large scale may encode the physics of the bounce ever\nhappened at about $\\sim 60$ efolds before inflation.\n", "  We describe the anomaly structure of an composite Higgs model in which the\n$SO(5)/SO(4)$ coset structure of the minimal model is extended by an\nadditional, non-linearly-realized $U(1)_{\\eta}$. In addition, we show that the\neffective lagrangian admits a term that, like the Wess-Zumino-Witten term in\nthe chiral lagrangian for QCD, is not invariant under the non-linearly realized\nsymmetries, but rather changes by a total derivative. This term is unlike the\nWess-Zumino-Witten term in that it does not arise from anomalies. If present,\nit may give rise to the rare decay $\\eta \\rightarrow h W^+ W^- Z$. The\nphenomenology of the singlet in this model differs from that in a model based\non $SO(6)/SO(5)$, in that couplings to both gluons and photons, arising via\nanomalies, are present. We show that while some tuning is needed to accommodate\nflavour and electroweak precision constraints, the model is no worse than the\nminimal model in this regard.\n", "  We present a Bayesian phase-space reconstruction of the cosmic large-scale\nmatter density and velocity fields from the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillations\nSpectroscopic Survey Data Release 12 (BOSS DR12) CMASS galaxy clustering\ncatalogue. We rely on a given $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, a mesh resolution in the\nrange of 6-10 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, and a lognormal-Poisson model with a redshift\ndependent nonlinear bias. The bias parameters are derived from the data and a\ngeneral renormalised perturbation theory approach. We use combined Gibbs and\nHamiltonian sampling, implemented in the \\textsc{argo} code, to iteratively\nreconstruct the dark matter density field and the coherent peculiar velocities\nof individual galaxies, correcting hereby for coherent redshift space\ndistortions (RSD). Our tests relying on accurate $N$-body based mock galaxy\ncatalogues, show unbiased real space power spectra of the nonlinear density\nfield up to $k\\sim0.2\\, h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and vanishing quadrupoles down to\n$r\\sim20\\,h^{-1}$ Mpc. We also demonstrate that the nonlinear cosmic web can be\nobtained from the tidal field tensor based on the Gaussian component of the\nreconstructed density field. We find that the reconstructed velocities have a\nstatistical correlation coefficient compared to the true velocities of each\nindividual lightcone mock galaxy of $r\\sim0.68$ including about 10% of\nsatellite galaxies with virial motions (about $r=0.75$ without satellites). The\npower spectra of the velocity divergence agree well with theoretical\npredictions up to $k\\sim0.2\\,h\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. This work will be especially\nuseful to improve, e.g. BAO reconstructions, kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ),\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) measurements, or environmental studies.\n", "  Let $c,h$ and $c,\\tilde{h}$ be two admissible pairs of central charge and\nhighest weight for ${\\rm Diff}^+(S^1)$. It is shown here that the positive\nenergy irreducible projective unitary representations $U_{c,h}$ and\n$U_{c,\\tilde{h}}$ of the group ${\\rm Diff}^+(S^1)$ are locally equivalent. This\nmeans that for any $I\\Subset S^1$ open proper interval, there exists a unitary\noperator $W_I$ such that $W_I U_{c,h}(\\gamma)W_I^* = U_{c,\\tilde{h}}(\\gamma)$\nfor all $\\gamma \\in {\\rm Diff}^+(S^1)$ which act identically on $I^c\\equiv\nS^1\\setminus I$ (i.e. which can \"displace\" or \"move\" points only in $I$). This\nresult extends and completes earlier ones that dealt with only certain regions\nof the \"$c,h$-plane\", and closes the gap in the full classification of\nsuperselection sectors of Virasoro nets.\n", "  We present the resummation of the full Pentagon Operator Product Expansion\nseries of the hexagon Wilson loop in planar $\\mathcal N=4$ SYM at tree level.\nWe do so by considering the one effective particle states formed by a\nfundamental flux tube excitation and an arbitrary number of the so called\n\"small fermions\" which are then integrated out. We present our proposals for\nthe one effective particle measures at finite coupling. By evaluating these\nmeasures at tree level and summing over all one effective particle states we\nreproduce the full 6 point tree level amplitude.\n", "  We analyse $B\\to K^\\ast \\ell\\ell$ decays in the region of low hadronic\nrecoil, where an operator product expansion (OPE) in $1/m_b$ applies. Using a\nlocal model for charm contributions based on $e^+ e^- \\to hadrons$ against the\nOPE provides a data-driven method to access the limitations to the OPE's\naccuracy related to binnings in the dilepton mass. Model-independent fits to\n$B\\to K^\\ast \\mu \\mu $ low recoil angular observables exhibit presently only\nsmall sensitivity to different charm models. They give similar results as the\nfits based on the OPE, and are in agreement with the standard model, but leave\nalso room for new physics. Measurements with resolution small enough to probe\ncharm resonances would be desirable.\n", "  The cross section of the $p(e,e'\\pi^+)n$ reaction has been measured for five\nkinematic settings at an invariant mass of $W = 1094$ MeV and for a\nfour-momentum transfer of $Q^2 = 0.078$ (GeV/$c$)$^2$. The measurement has been\nperformed at MAMI using a new short-orbit spectrometer (SOS) of the A1\ncollaboration, intended for detection of low-energy pions. The transverse and\nlongitudinal cross section terms were separated using the Rosenbluth method and\nthe transverse-longitudinal interference term has been determined from the\nleft-right asymmetry. The experimental cross section terms are compared with\nthe calculations of three models: DMT2001, MAID2007 and $\\chi$MAID. The results\nshow that we do not yet understand the dynamics of the fundamental pion.\n", "  We investigate giant molecular cloud (GMCs) collisions and their ability to\ninduce gravitational instability and thus star formation. This mechanism may be\na major driver of star formation activity in galactic disks. We carry out a\nseries of three dimensional, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR) simulations to study how cloud collisions trigger formation of\ndense filaments and clumps. Heating and cooling functions are implemented based\non photo-dissociation region (PDR) models that span the atomic to molecular\ntransition and can return detailed diagnostic information. The clouds are\ninitialized with supersonic turbulence and a range of magnetic field strengths\nand orientations. Collisions at various velocities and impact parameters are\ninvestigated. Comparing and contrasting colliding and non-colliding cases, we\ncharacterize morphologies of dense gas, magnetic field structure, cloud\nkinematic signatures, and cloud dynamics. We present key observational\ndiagnostics of cloud collisions, especially: relative orientations between\nmagnetic fields and density structures, like filaments; $^{13}$CO($J$=2-1),\n$^{13}$CO($J$=3-2), and $^{12}$CO($J$=8-7) integrated intensity maps and\nspectra; and cloud virial parameters. We compare these results to observed\nGalactic clouds.\n", "  Recently some researchers, (A. Sepehri, S. Shoorvazi, CHIN. PHYS. LETT. Vol.\n30, No. 2 (2013)), have considered the effect of Rindler horizon on three jet\nrate. This paper confirms their results and by comparing usual models with this\nnew model for different energies, shows that regarding Rindler horizon gives us\nthe results which more close to experimental data respect to usual models\n", "  We study three different chiral Lagrangians that describe the two- and\nthree-body decays of an excited pseudoscalar glueball, $J^{PC}=0^{*-+}$, into\nlight mesons and charmonium states as well as into a scalar and pseudoscalar\nglueball. We compute the decay channels for an excited pseudoscalar glueball\nwith a mass of $3.7$ GeV and consider a ground state pseudoscalar glueball of\nmass $2.6$ GeV, following predictions from lattice QCD simulations. These\nstates and channels are in reach of the ongoing BESIII experiment and the PANDA\nexperiments at the upcoming FAIR facility experiment. We present the resulting\ndecay branching ratios with a parameter-free prediction.\n", "  High Refractive Index (HRI) dielectric particles smaller than the wavelength,\nisolated or forming a designed ensemble are ideal candidates as new\nmultifunctional elements for building optical devices. Their directionality\neffects are traditionally analyzed through forward and backward measurements,\neven if these directions are not suitable for practical purposes. Here we\npresent unambiguous experimental evidence in the microwave range that, for a\ndimer of HRI spherical particles, a perfect switching effect (perfect means off\n= null intensity) is observed out of those directions as a consequence of the\nmutual particle electric/magnetic interaction. The binary state depends on the\nexcitation polarization (polarization switching). Its analysis is performed\nthrough the linear polarization degree of scattered radiation at a detection\ndirection perpendicular to the incident direction: the beam-splitter\nconfiguration. The scaling property of Maxwell equations allows generalizing\nour results to other frequency range and dimension scales, for instance, the\nvisible and the nanometric scale.\n", "  Linear system games are a generalization of Mermin's magic square game\nintroduced by Cleve and Mittal. They show that perfect strategies for linear\nsystem games in the tensor-product model of entanglement correspond to\nfinite-dimensional operator solutions of a certain set of non-commutative\nequations. We investigate linear system games in the commuting-operator model\nof entanglement, where Alice and Bob's measurement operators act on a joint\nHilbert space, and Alice's operators must commute with Bob's operators. We show\nthat perfect strategies in this model correspond to\npossibly-infinite-dimensional operator solutions of the non-commutative\nequations. The proof is based around a finitely-presented group associated to\nthe linear system which arises from the non-commutative equations.\n", "  Random coincidences of nuclear events can be one of the main background\nsources in low-temperature calorimetric experiments looking for neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay, especially in those searches based on scintillating\nbolometers embedding the promising double-beta candidate $^{100}$Mo, because of\nthe relatively short half-life of the two-neutrino double-beta decay of this\nnucleus. We show in this work that randomly coinciding events of the\ntwo-neutrino double decay of $^{100}$Mo in enriched Li$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$\ndetectors can be effectively discriminated by pulse-shape analysis in the light\nchannel if the scintillating bolometer is provided with a Neganov-Luke light\ndetector, which can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by a large factor,\nassumed here at the level of $\\sim 750$ on the basis of preliminary\nexperimental results obtained with these devices. The achieved pile-up\nrejection efficiency results in a very low contribution, of the order of $\\sim\n6\\times10^{-5}$ counts/(keV$\\cdot$kg$\\cdot$y), to the background counting rate\nin the region of interest for a large volume ($\\sim 90$ cm$^3$)\nLi$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ detector. This background level is very encouraging in\nview of a possible use of the Li$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ solution for a bolometric\ntonne-scale next-generation experiment as that proposed in the CUPID project.\n", "  The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in Fe-based compounds\n[1,2] has triggered numerous investigations on the interplay between\nsuperconductivity and magnetism [3] and, more recently, on the enhancement of\ntransition temperatures through interface effects [4]. It is widely believed\nthat the emergence of optimal superconductivity is intimately linked to the\nsuppression of long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, although the exact\nmicroscopic picture of this relationship remains elusive [1] due to the lack of\ndata with atomic spatial resolution [5-7]. Here, we present a spin-polarized\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy (SP-STS) study of ultrathin FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$\n(x = 0, 0.5) films grown on prototypical Bi-based bulk topological insulators.\nSurprisingly, we find an energy gap at the Fermi level indicating\nsuperconducting correlations up to Tc ~ 6 K for one unit cell thin FeTe layers\ngrown on Bi2Te3 substrates, in contrast to the non-superconducting FeTe bulk\ncompound [8]. Moreover, SP-STS reveals that the energy gap spatially coexists\nwith bicollinear AFM order. This finding opens novel perspectives for\ntheoretical studies of competing orders in Fe-based superconductors as well as\nfor experimental investigations of exotic phases in heterostructures of\ntopological insulators and superconducting layers.\n", "  CEBAF, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, has been actively\nserving the nuclear physics research community as a unique forefront\ninternational resource since 1995. This CW electron linear accelerator (linac)\nat the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator\nFacility (Jefferson Lab) has continued to evolve as a precision tool for\ndiscerning the structure and dynamics within nuclei. Superconducting RF (SRF)\ntechnology has been the essential foundation for CEBAF, first as a 4 GeV\nmachine, then 6 GeV, and currently capable of 12 GeV. We review the\ndevelopment, implementation, and performance of SRF systems for CEBAF from its\nearly beginnings to the commissioning of the 12 GeV era.\n", "  We consider generic pure $n$-qubit states and a general class of pure states\nof arbitrary dimensions and arbitrarily many subsystems. We characterize those\nstates which can be reached from some other state via Local Operations assisted\nby finitely many rounds of Classical Communication ($LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$). For\n$n$ qubits with $n>3$ we show that this set of states is of measure zero, which\nimplies that the maximally entangled set is generically of full measure if\nrestricted to the practical scenario of $LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$. Moreover, we\nidentify a class of states for which any $LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$ protocol can be\nrealized via a concatenation of deterministic steps. We show, however, that in\ngeneral there exist state transformations which require a probabilistic step\nwithin the protocol, which highlights the difference between bipartite and\nmultipartite LOCC.\n", "  In the context of [1]'s string theoretic dual of large-N thermal QCD-like\ntheories at finite gauge/string coupling (as part of the `MQGP' limit of [2]),\nwe discuss the following. First, up to LO in N, using the results of [3], we\nshow that the local T^3 of [2] is the T^2-invariant sLag of [3] in a resolved\nconifold. This, together with the results of [4], shows that for a\n(predominantly resolved or deformed) resolved warped deformed conifold, the\nlocal T^3 of [2] in the MQGP limit, is the T^2-invariant sLag of [3] justifying\nthe construction of the delocalized SYZ type IIA mirror of the type IIB\nbackground of [1]. Then, using the prescription of [5], we obtain the\ntemperature dependence of the thermal (and electrical) conductivity working up\nto leading order in N (the number of D3-branes), and upon comparison with [6]\nshow that the results mimic a 1+1-dimensional Luttinger liquid with impurities.\nFurther, including sub-leading non-conformal terms in the metric determined by\nM (the number of fractional D-branes = the number of colors = 3 in the IR after\nthe end of a Seiberg duality cascade), by looking at respectively the scalar,\nvector and tensor modes of metric perturbations and using [7]'s prescription of\nconstructing appropriate gauge-invariant perturbations, we obtain respectively\nthe speed of sound, the diffusion constant and the shear viscosity \\eta (and\n\\eta/s) including the non-conformal O((g_s M^2) (g_s N_f)/N<<1)-corrections,\nN_f being the number of flavor D7-branes.\n", "  We consider 2D interacting electrons at a monkey saddle with dispersion\n$\\propto p_x^3-3p_xp_y^2$. Such a dispersion naturally arises at the\nmulticritical Lifshitz point when three van Hove saddles merge in an elliptical\numbilic elementary catastrophe, which we show can be realized in biased bilayer\ngraphene. A multicritical Lifshitz point of this kind can be identified by its\nsignature Landau level behavior $E_m\\propto (Bm)^{3/2}$ and related\noscillations in thermodynamic and transport properties, such as de Haas-van\nAlphen and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, whose period triples as the system\ncrosses the singularity. We show, in the case of a single monkey saddle, that\nthe non-interacting electron fixed point is unstable to interactions under the\nrenormalization group flow, developing either a superconducting instability or\nnon-Fermi liquid features. Biased bilayer graphene, where there are two\nnon-nested monkey saddles at the $K$ and $K^\\prime$ points, exhibits an\ninterplay of competing many-body instabilities, namely s-wave\nsuperconductivity, ferromagnetism, and spin- and charge-density wave.\n", "  Solitons are wavepackets that resist dispersion through a self-induced\npotential well. They are studied in many fields, but are especially well known\nin optics on account of the relative ease of their formation and control in\noptical fiber waveguides. Besides their many interesting properties, solitons\nare important to optical continuum generation, in mode-locked lasers and have\nbeen considered as a natural way to convey data over great distances. Recently,\nsolitons have been realized in microcavities thereby bringing the power of\nmicrofabrication methods to future applications. This work reports a soliton\nnot previously observed in optical systems, the Stokes soliton. The Stokes\nsoliton forms and regenerates by optimizing its Raman interaction in space and\ntime within an optical-potential well shared with another soliton. The Stokes\nand the initial soliton belong to distinct transverse mode families and benefit\nfrom a form of soliton trapping that is new to microcavities and soliton lasers\nin general. The discovery of a new optical soliton can impact work in other\nareas of photonics including nonlinear optics and spectroscopy.\n", "  Optical absorbers find uses in a wide array of applications across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, including photovoltaic and photochemical cells,\nphotodetectors, optical filters, stealth technology, and thermal light sources.\nRecent efforts have sought to reduce the footprint of optical absorbers,\nconventionally based on graded structures or Fabry-Perot-type cavities, by\nusing the emerging concepts of plasmonics, metamaterials, and metasurfaces.\nUnfortunately, these new absorber designs require patterning on subwavelength\nlength scales, and are therefore impractical for many large-scale optical and\noptoelectronic devices.\n  In this article, we summarize recent progress in the development of optical\nabsorbers based on lossy films with thicknesses significantly smaller than the\nincident optical wavelength. These structures have a small footprint and\nrequire no nanoscale patterning. We outline the theoretical foundation of these\nabsorbers based on \"ultra-thin-film interference\", including the concepts of\nloss-induced phase shifts and critical coupling, and then present several\napplications, including ultra-thin color coatings, decorative photovoltaics,\nhigh-efficiency photochemical cells, and infrared scene generators.\n", "  This commentary reflects on the 1930 discoveries of L\\'eon Rosenfeld in the\ndomain of phase-space constraints. We start with a short biography of Rosenfeld\nand his motivation for this article in the context of ideas pursued by W.\nPauli, F. Klein, E. Noether. We then comment on Rosenfeld's General Theory\ndealing with symmetries and constraints, symmetry generators, conservation laws\nand the construction of a Hamiltonian in the case of phase-space constraints.\nIt is remarkable that he was able to derive expressions for all phase space\nsymmetry generators without making explicit reference to the generator of time\nevolution. In his Applications, Rosenfeld treated the general relativistic\nexample of Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac theory. We show, that although Rosenfeld\nrefrained from fully applying his general findings to this example, he could\nhave obtained the Hamiltonian. Many of Rosenfeld's discoveries were\nre-developed or re-discovered by others two decades later, yet as we show there\nremain additional firsts that are still not recognized in the community.\n", "  Direct photon flow is measured by subtracting the contribution of decay\nphoton flow from the measured inclusive photon flow via the double ratio\n$R_{\\rm \\gamma}$, which defines the excess of direct over decay photons. The\ninclusive photon sample is affected by a modest contamination from different\nbackground sources, which is often ignored in measurements. However, due to the\nsensitivity of the direct photon measurement even a residual contamination may\nsignificantly bias the extracted direct photon flow. In particular, for\nmeasurements using photon conversions, which are very powerful at low\ntransverse momentum, these effects can be substantial. Assuming three different\ntypes of correlated background contributions we demonstrate using the\nTherminator2 event generator that the impact of the contamination on the\nmagnitude of direct photon flow can be on the level of $50\\%$, even if the\npurity of the inclusive photon sample is about $97\\%$. Future measurements\nshould attempt to account for the contamination by measuring the background\ncontributions and subtracting them from the inclusive photon flow.\n", "  The recently discovered $P_c(4380)^+$ and $P_c(4450)^+$ states at LHCb have\nmasses close to the $\\bar D\\Sigma_c^*$ and $\\bar D^*\\Sigma_c$ thresholds,\nrespectively, which suggest that they may have significant meson-baryon\nmolecular components. We analyze these states in the framework of a constituent\nquark model which has been applied to a wide range of hadronic observables,\nbeing the model parameters, therefore, completely constrained.\n  The $P_c(4380)^+$ and $P_c(4450)^+$ are studied as molecular states composed\nby charmed baryons and open charm mesons. Several bound states with the proper\nbinding energy are found in the $\\bar D\\Sigma_c^*$ and $\\bar D^*\\Sigma_c$\nchannels. We discuss the possible assignments of these states from their decay\nwidths. Moreover, two more states are predicted, associated with the $\\bar\nD\\Sigma_c$ and $\\bar D^* \\Sigma_c^*$ thresholds.\n", "  Long-lived particles (LLPs) are a common feature in many beyond the Standard\nModel theories, including supersymmetry, and are generically produced in exotic\nHiggs decays. Unfortunately, no existing or proposed search strategy will be\nable to observe the decay of non-hadronic electrically neutral LLPs with masses\nabove $\\sim$ GeV and lifetimes near the limit set by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\n(BBN), $c \\tau \\lesssim 10^7 - 10^8$~m. We propose the MATHUSLA surface\ndetector concept (MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra Stable neutraL pArticles),\nwhich can be implemented with existing technology and in time for the high\nluminosity LHC upgrade to find such ultra-long-lived particles (ULLPs), whether\nproduced in exotic Higgs decays or more general production modes. We also\nadvocate for a dedicated LLP detector at a future 100 TeV collider, where a\nmodestly sized underground design can discover ULLPs with lifetimes at the BBN\nlimit produced in sub-percent level exotic Higgs decays.\n", "  The collectivity in the simultaneous diffusion of many particles, i.e. the\ninterdependence of stochastic forces affecting different particles in the same\nsolution, is a largely overlooked phenomenon with no well-established theory.\nRecently, we have proposed a novel type of thermodynamically consistent\nLangevin dynamics driven by the Spatially Correlated Noise (SCN) that can\ncontribute to the understanding of this problem. This model draws a link\nbetween the theory of effective interactions in binary colloidal mixtures and\nthe properties of SCN. In the current article we review this model from the\nperspective of collective diffusion and generalize it to the case of multiple\n($N>2$) particles. Since our theory of SCN-driven Langevin dynamics has certain\nissues that could not be resolved within its framework, in this article we also\nprovide another approach to the problem of collectivity. We discuss the\nmulti-particle Mori-Zwanzig model, which is fully microscopically consistent.\nIndeed, we show that this model supplies many information, complementary to the\nSCN-based approach, e.g. it predicts the deterministic dynamics of the relative\ndistance between the particles, it provides the approximation for\nnon-equilibrium effective interactions and predicts the collective subdiffusion\nof tracers in group. These results provide the short-range, inertial limit of\nthe earlier model and agree with its predictions under some general conditions.\nIn this article we also review the origin of SCN and its consequences for the\nvariety of physical systems, with emphasis on the colloids.\n", "  The coherent manipulation of spin and pseudospin underlies existing and\nemerging quantum technologies, including NMR, quantum communication, and\nquantum computation. Valley polarization, associated with the occupancy of\ndegenerate, but quantum mechanically distinct valleys in momentum space,\nclosely resembles spin polarization and has been proposed as a pseudospin\ncarrier for the future quantum electronics. Valley exciton polarization has\nbeen created in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers using\nexcitation by circularly polarized light and has been detected both optically\nand electrically. In addition, the existence of coherence in the valley\npseudospin has been identified experimentally. The manipulation of such valley\ncoherence has, however, remained out of reach. Here we demonstrate an\nall-optical control of the valley coherence by means of the pseudomagnetic\nfield associated with the optical Stark effect. Using below-bandgap circularly\npolarized light, we experimentally rotate the valley exciton pseudospin in\nmonolayer WSe2 on the femtosecond time scale. Both the direction and speed of\nthe rotation can be optically manipulated by tuning the dynamic phase of\nexcitons in opposite valleys. This study completes the\ngeneration-manipulation-detection paradigm for valley pseudospin, enabling the\nplatform of excitons in 2D materials for the control of this novel degree of\nfreedom in solids.\n", "  We introduce a deformed version of Dyck paths (DDP), where additional to the\nsteps allowed for Dyck paths, 'jumps' orthogonal to the preferred direction of\nthe path are permitted. We consider the generating function of DDP, weighted\nwith respect to their half-length, area and number of jumps. This represents\nthe first example of an exactly solvable lattice path model showing a\nhigher-order multicritical point. Applying the generalized method of steepest\ndescents, we see that the associated two-variable scaling function is given by\nthe logarithmic derivative of a generalized (higher-order) Airy integral.\n", "  In 4 dimensional Maxwell gauge theory, we study the changes of (Renyi)\nentangle-ment entropy which are defined by subtracting the entropy for the\nground state from the one for the locally excited states generated by acting\nwith the gauge invariant local operators on the state. The changes for the\noperators which we consider in this paper reflect the electric-magnetic\nduality. The late-time value of changes can be interpreted in terms of\nelectromagnetic quasi-particles. When the operator constructed of both electric\nand magnetic fields acts on the ground state, it shows that the operator acts\non the late-time structure of quantum entanglement differently from free scalar\nfields.\n", "  The large cavities observed in the dust and gas distributions of transition\ndisks may be explained by planet-disk interactions. At ~145 pc, 2MASS\nJ16042165-2130284 (J1604) is a 5-12 Myr old transitional disk with different\ngap sizes in the mm- and $\\mu$m-sized dust distributions (outer edges at ~79\nand at ~63 au, respectively). Its $^{12}$CO emission shows a ~30 au cavity.\nThis radial structure suggests that giant planets are sculpting this disk. We\naim to constrain the masses and locations of plausible giant planets around\nJ1604. We observed J1604 with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet\nREsearch (SPHERE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), in IRDIFS\\_EXT,\npupil-stabilized mode, obtaining YJH- band images with the integral field\nspectrograph (IFS) and K1K2-band images with the Infra-Red Dual-beam Imager and\nSpectrograph (IRDIS). The dataset was processed exploiting the angular\ndifferential imaging (ADI) technique with high-contrast algorithms. Our\nobservations reach a contrast of $\\Delta K, YH$ ~12 mag from 0.15\" to 0.80\"\n(~22 to 115 au), but no planet candidate is detected. The disk is directly\nimaged in scattered light at all bands from Y to K, and it shows a red color.\nThis indicates that the dust particles in the disk surface are mainly\n$\\gtrsim0.3\\,\\mu$m-sized grains. We confirm the sharp dip/decrement in\nscattered light in agreement with polarized light observations. Comparing our\nimages with a radiative transfer model we argue that the southern side of the\ndisk is most likely the nearest. This work represents the deepest search yet\nfor companions around J1604. We reach a mass sensitivity of $\\gtrsim\n2-3M_{Jup}$ from ~22 to ~115 au according to a hot start scenario. We propose\nthat a brown dwarf orbiting inside of ~15 au and additional Jovian planets at\nlarger radii could account for the observed properties of J1604 while\nexplaining our lack of detection.\n", "  Extending the formulation for open superstring field theory given in\narXiv:1508.00366, we attempt to construct a complete action for heterotic\nstring field theory. The action is non-polynomial in the Ramond string field\nPsi, and we construct it order by order in Psi. Using a dual formulation in\nwhich the role of eta and Q is exchanged, the action is explicitly obtained at\nthe quadratic and quartic order in Psi with the gauge transformations.\n", "  We consider the transition probabilities for random walks in $1+1$\ndimensional space-time random environments (RWRE). For critically tuned weak\ndisorder we prove a sharp large deviation result: after appropriate rescaling,\nthe transition probabilities for the RWRE evaluated in the large deviation\nregime, converge to the solution to the stochastic heat equation (SHE) with\nmultiplicative noise (the logarithm of which is the KPZ equation). We apply\nthis to the exactly solvable Beta RWRE and additionally present a formal\nderivation of the convergence of certain moment formulas for that model to\nthose for the SHE.\n", "  We study the orientation dependence of the reconstructed deceleration\nparameter as a function of redshift. We use the Union 2 and Loss datasets, by\nusing the well known preferred axis discussed in the literature, finding the\nbest fit reconstructed deceleration parameter. We found that a low redshift\ntransition of the reconstructed $q(z)$ is clearly absent in one direction and\namazingly sharp in the opposite one. We discuss the possibility that such a\nbehavior can be associated with large scale structures affecting the data.\n", "  A new and automated method is presented for the analysis of high-resolution\nabsorption spectra. Three established numerical methods are unified into one\n\"artificial intelligence\" process: a genetic algorithm (GVPFIT); non-linear\nleast-squares with parameter constraints (VPFIT); and Bayesian Model Averaging\n(BMA).\n  The method has broad application but here we apply it specifically to the\nproblem of measuring the fine structure constant at high redshift. For this we\nneed objectivity and reproducibility. GVPFIT is also motivated by the\nimportance of obtaining a large statistical sample of measurements of\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$. Interactive analyses are both time consuming and complex\nand automation makes obtaining a large sample feasible.\n  In contrast to previous methodologies, we use BMA to derive results using a\nlarge set of models and show that this procedure is more robust than a human\npicking a single preferred model since BMA avoids the systematic uncertainties\nassociated with model choice.\n  Numerical simulations provide stringent tests of the whole process and we\nshow using both real and simulated spectra that the unified automated fitting\nprocedure out-performs a human interactive analysis. The method should be\ninvaluable in the context of future instrumentation like ESPRESSO on the VLT\nand indeed future ELTs.\n  We apply the method to the $z_{abs} = 1.8389$ absorber towards the $z_{em} =\n2.145$ quasar J110325-264515. The derived constraint of $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha =\n3.3 \\pm 2.9 \\times 10^{-6}$ is consistent with no variation and also consistent\nwith the tentative spatial variation reported in Webb et al (2011) and King et\nal (2012).\n", "  Melott et al. [2016] suggest that individual solar proton events (SPEs) are\ndetectable as nitrate ion spikes in ice cores. They use the high fluence, high\nenergy (hard spectrum) SPE of 23 February 1956 to calculate an enhancement of\nHNO3 from the surface to 46 km that is equivalent to a ~120 ng cm-2 nitrate ion\nspike observed in the GISP2H ice core. The Melott et al. [2016] approach is\nfundamentally flawed, since it considers only the absolute column burden of\nSPE-produced nitrate and not the pre-existing nitrate in the stratosphere.\nModeling studies supported by extensive observations [Duderstadt et al., 2014,\n2016, and this comment] show background HNO3 in the lower and middle\nstratosphere equivalent to 2000 to 3000 ng cm-2 nitrate. These high levels of\nbackground nitrate must also be included when estimating SPE enhancements to\nthe deposition of nitrate ions that might eventually be preserved in an ice\ncore. The 1956 SPE results in less than a 5% increase in the column burden of\natmospheric HNO3, not large enough to explain the nitrate spike seen in the\nGISP2H ice core. Even extreme SPE enhancements cannot explain nitrate peaks\n(typically hundreds of percent increases) observed in the ice record\n[Duderstadt et al., 2016]. Realistic mechanisms linking nitrate ions in ice\ncores to SPEs have not been established. It is time to move the search for\nindicators of SPEs away from nitrate ions: Nitrate ions cannot be used as\nproxies for individual SPEs in the ice core record.\n", "  Cosmic ray muons passing through matter lose energy from inelastic collisions\nwith electrons and are deflected from nuclei due to multiple Coulomb\nscattering. The strong dependence of scattering on atomic number Z and the\nrecent developments on position sensitive muon detectors indicate that multiple\nCoulomb scattering could be an excellent candidate for spent nuclear fuel\nimaging. Muons present significant advantages over existing monitoring and\nimaging techniques and can play a central role in monitoring nuclear waste and\nspent nuclear fuel stored in dense well shielded containers. The main purpose\nof this paper is to investigate the applicability of multiple Coulomb\nscattering for imaging of spent nuclear fuel dry casks stored within vertical\nand horizontal commercial storage dry casks. Calculations of muon scattering\nwere performed for various scenarios, including vertical and horizontal fully\nloaded dry casks, half loaded dry casks, dry casks with one row of fuel\nassemblies missing, dry casks with one fuel assembly missing and empty dry\ncasks. Various detector sizes (1.2 m x 1.2 m, 2.4 m x 2.4 m and 3.6 m x 3.6 m)\nand number of muons ($10^{5}, 5\\cdot10^{5}, 10^{6}$ and $10^{7}$) were used to\nassess the effect on image resolution. The Point-of-Closest-Approach (PoCA)\nalgorithm was used for the reconstruction of the stored contents. The results\ndemonstrate that multiple Coulomb scattering can be used to successfully\nreconstruct the dry cask contents and allow identification of all scenarios\nwith the exception of one fuel assembly missing. In this case, an indication\nexists that a fuel assembly is not present; however the resolution of the\nimaging algorithm was not enough to identify exact location.\n", "  We develop a set of kinetic equations for hydrodynamic fluctuations which are\nequivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. The hydro-kinetic equations\ncan be coupled to existing second order hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the\nphysics of these fluctuations. We first show that the kinetic response\nprecisely reproduces the renormalization of the shear viscosity and the\nfractional power ($\\propto \\omega^{3/2}$) which characterizes equilibrium\ncorrelators of energy and momentum for a static fluid. Then we use the\nhydro-kinetic equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken\nexpansion, evaluating the contribution of thermal noise from the earliest\nmoments and at late times. In the Bjorken case, the solution to the kinetic\nequations determines the coefficient of the first fractional power of the\ngradient expansion ($\\propto 1/(\\tau T)^{3/2}$) for the expanding system.\nNumerically, we find that the contribution to the longitudinal pressure from\nhydrodynamic fluctuations is larger than second order hydrodynamics for typical\nmedium parameters used to simulate heavy ion collisions.\n", "  (Abridged) We here continue our effort to model the behaviour of matter when\norbiting or accreting onto a generic black hole by developing a new numerical\ncode employing advanced techniques geared solve the equations of in\ngeneral-relativistic hydrodynamics. The new code employs a number of\nhigh-resolution shock-capturing Riemann-solvers and reconstruction algorithms,\nexploiting the enhanced accuracy and the reduced computational cost of AMR\ntechniques. In addition, the code makes use of sophisticated ray-tracing\nlibraries that, coupled with general-relativistic radiation-transfer\ncalculations, allow us to compute accurately the electromagnetic emissions from\nsuch accretion flows. We validate the new code by presenting an extensive\nseries of stationary accretion flows either in spherical or axial symmetry and\nperformed either in 2D or 3D. In addition, we consider the highly nonlinear\nscenario of a recoiling black hole produced in the merger of a supermassive\nblack hole binary interacting with the surrounding circumbinary disc. In this\nway we can present, for the first time, ray-traced images of the shocked fluid\nand the light-curve resulting from consistent general-relativistic\nradiation-transport calculations from this process. The work presented here\nlays the ground for the development of a generic computational infrastructure\nemploying AMR techniques to deal accurately and self-consistently with\naccretion flows onto compact objects. In addition to the accurate handling of\nthe matter, we provide a self-consistent electromagnetic emission from these\nscenarios by solving the associated radiative-transfer problem. While magnetic\nfields are presently excluded from our analysis, the tools presented here can\nhave a number of applications to study accretion flows onto black holes or\nneutron stars.\n", "  We consider various lattice models of polymers: lattice trees, lattice\nanimals, and self-avoiding walks. The polymer interacts with a surface\n(hyperplane), receiving a unit energy reward for each site in the surface.\nThere is an adsorption transition of the polymer at a critical value of\n$\\beta$, the inverse temperature. We present a new proof of the result of\nHammersley, Torrie, and Whittington (1982) that the transition occurs at a\nstrictly positive value of $\\beta$ when the surface is impenetrable, i.e. when\nthe polymer is restricted to a half-space. In contrast, for a penetrable\nsurface, it is an open problem to prove that the transition occurs at $\\beta=0$\n(i.e., infinite temperature). We reduce this problem to showing that the\nfraction of N-site polymers whose span is less than $N/\\log^2 N$ is not too\nsmall.\n", "  We investigate single-valued polylogarithms in two complex variables, which\nare relevant for the seven-point remainder function in N=4 super-Yang-Mills\ntheory in the multi-Regge regime. After constructing these two-dimensional\npolylogarithms, we determine the leading logarithmic approximation of the\nseven-point remainder function up to and including five loops.\n", "  We prove R\\'enyi entropic inequalities in a holographic setup based on the\nrecent proposal for the holographic formula of R\\'enyi entropies when the bulk\nis stable against any perturbation. Regarding the R\\'enyi parameter as an\ninverse temperature, we reformulate the entropies in analogy with statistical\nmechanics, which provides us a concise interpretation of the inequalities as\nthe positivities of entropy, energy and heat capacity. This analogy also makes\nclear a thermodynamic structure in deriving the holographic formula. As a\nby-product of the proof we obtain a holographic formula to calculate the\nquantum fluctuation of the modular Hamiltonian. A few examples of the capacity\nof entanglement are examined in detail.\n", "  We examine how to construct a spatial manifold and its geometry from the\nentanglement structure of an abstract quantum state in Hilbert space. Given a\ndecomposition of Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ into a tensor product of factors,\nwe consider a class of \"redundancy-constrained states\" in $\\mathcal{H}$ that\ngeneralize the area-law behavior for entanglement entropy usually found in\ncondensed-matter systems with gapped local Hamiltonians. Using mutual\ninformation to define a distance measure on the graph, we employ classical\nmultidimensional scaling to extract the best-fit spatial dimensionality of the\nemergent geometry. We then show that entanglement perturbations on such\nemergent geometries naturally give rise to local modifications of spatial\ncurvature which obey a (spatial) analog of Einstein's equation. The Hilbert\nspace corresponding to a region of flat space is finite-dimensional and scales\nas the volume, though the entropy (and the maximum change thereof) scales like\nthe area of the boundary. A version of the ER=EPR conjecture is recovered, in\nthat perturbations that entangle distant parts of the emergent geometry\ngenerate a configuration that may be considered as a highly quantum wormhole.\n", "  With the aim of improving predictions on far infrared (FIR) line emission\nfrom Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC), we study the effects of photoevaporation\n(PE) produced by external far-ultraviolet (FUV) and ionizing\n(extreme-ultraviolet, EUV) radiation on GMC structure. We consider three\ndifferent GMCs with mass in the range $M_{\\rm GMC} = 10^{3-6}\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$.\nOur model includes: (i) an observationally-based inhomogeneous GMC density\nfield, and (ii) its time evolution during the PE process. In the fiducial case\n($M_{\\rm GMC}\\approx10^5 M_{\\odot}$), the photoevaporation time ($t_{pe}$)\nincreases from 1 Myr to 30 Myr for gas metallicity $Z=0.05-1\\,\\rm Z_{\\odot}$,\nrespectively. Next, we compute the time-dependent luminosity of key FIR lines\ntracing the neutral and ionized gas layers of the GMCs, ([CII] at $158\\,\\rm{\\mu\nm}$, [OIII] at $88\\,\\rm \\mu m$) as a function of $G_0$, and $Z$ until complete\nphotoevaporation at $t_{pe}$. We find that the specific [CII] luminosity is\nalmost independent on the GMC model within the survival time of the cloud.\nStronger FUV fluxes produce higher [CII] and [OIII] luminosities, however\nlasting for progressively shorter times. At $Z=Z_{\\odot}$ the [CII] emission is\nmaximized ($L_{\\rm CII}\\approx 10^4\\,\\rm{L_{\\odot}}$ for the fiducial model)\nfor $t<1\\,\\rm{Myr}$ and $\\log G_0\\geq 3$. Noticeably, and consistently with the\nrecent detection by Inoue et al. (2016) of a galaxy at redshift $z\\approx 7.2$,\nfor $Z\\leq 0.2\\,\\rm{Z_{\\odot}}$ the [OIII] line might outshine [CII] emission\nby up to $\\approx 1000$ times. We conclude that the [OIII] line is a key\ndiagnostic of low metallicity ISM, especially in galaxies with very young\nstellar populations.\n", "  Information engines can use structured environments as a resource to generate\nwork by randomizing ordered inputs and leveraging the increased Shannon entropy\nto transfer energy from a thermal reservoir to a work reservoir. We give a\nbroadly applicable expression for the work production of an information engine,\ngenerally modeled as a memoryful channel that communicates inputs to outputs as\nit interacts with an evolving environment. The expression establishes that an\ninformation engine must have more than one memory state in order to leverage\ninput environment correlations. To emphasize this functioning, we designed an\ninformation engine powered solely by temporal correlations and not by\nstatistical biases, as employed by previous engines. Key to this is the\nengine's ability to synchronize---the engine automatically returns to a desired\ndynamical phase when thrown into an unwanted, dissipative phase by corruptions\nin the input---that is, by unanticipated environmental fluctuations. This\nself-correcting mechanism is robust up to a critical level of corruption,\nbeyond which the system fails to act as an engine. We give explicit analytical\nexpressions for both work and critical corruption level and summarize engine\nperformance via a thermodynamic-function phase diagram over engine control\nparameters. The results reveal a new thermodynamic mechanism based on\nnonergodicity that underlies error correction as it operates to support\nresilient engineered and biological systems.\n", "  Quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum impose an observable\nquantum limit to the lowest temperatures that can be reached with conventional\nlaser cooling techniques. As laser cooling experiments continue to bring\nmassive mechanical systems to unprecedented temperatures, this quantum limit\ntakes on increasingly greater practical importance in the laboratory.\nFortunately, vacuum fluctuations are not immutable, and can be \"squeezed\"\nthrough the generation of entangled photon pairs. Here we propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate that squeezed light can be used to sideband cool the\nmotion of a macroscopic mechanical object below the quantum limit. To do so, we\nfirst cool a microwave cavity optomechanical system with a coherent state of\nlight to within 15% of this limit. We then cool by more than 2 dB below the\nquantum limit using a squeezed microwave field generated by a Josephson\nParametric Amplifier (JPA). From heterodyne spectroscopy of the mechanical\nsidebands, we measure a minimum thermal occupancy of 0.19 phonons. With this\nnovel technique, even low frequency mechanical oscillators can in principle be\ncooled arbitrarily close to the motional ground state, enabling the exploration\nof quantum physics in larger, more massive systems.\n", "  Data released by the Planck Collaboration in 2015 imply new dates for the era\nof radiation, the era of matter, and the era of dark energy. The era of\nradiation ended, and the era of matter began, when the density of radiation\ndropped below that of matter. This happened 50,953 \\pm 2236 years after the\ntime of infinite redshift when the ratio a(t)/a_0 of scale factors was (2.9332\n\\pm 0.0711) x 10^{-4}. The era of matter ended, and the era of dark energy\nbegan, when the density of matter dropped below that of dark energy (assumed\nconstant). This happened 10.1928 \\pm 0.0375 Gyr after the time of infinite\nredshift when the scale-factor ratio was 0.7646 \\pm 0.0168. The era of dark\nenergy started 3.606 billion years ago.\n  In this pedagogical paper, five figures trace the evolution of the densities\nof radiation and matter, the scale factor, and the redshift through the eras of\nradiation, matter, and dark energy.\n", "  We present a class of analytic solutions of non-relativistic fireball\nhydrodynamics for a fairly general class of equation of state. The presented\nsolution describes the expansion of a triaxial ellipsoid that rotates around\none of the principal axes. We calculate the hadronic final state observables\nsuch as single-particle spectra, directed, elliptic and third flows, as well as\nHBT correlations and corresponding radius parameters, utilizing simple analytic\nformulas. We call attention to the fact that the final tilt angle of the\nfireball, an important observable quantity, is not independent on the exact\ndefinition of it: one gets different angles from the single-particle spectra\nand from HBT measurements. Taken together, it is pointed out that these\nobservables may be sufficient for the determination of the magnitude of the\nrotation of the fireball. We argue that observing this rotation and its\ndependence on collision energy would reveal the softness of the equation of\nstate. Thus determining the rotation may be a powerful tool for the\nexperimental search for the critical point in the phase diagram of strongly\ninteracting matter.\n", "  Rosseland mean opacity plays an important role in theories of stellar\nevolution and X-ray burst models. In the high-temperature regime, when most of\nthe gas is completely ionized, the opacity is dominated by Compton scattering.\nOur aim here is to critically evaluate previous works on this subject and to\ncompute exact Rosseland mean opacity for Compton scattering in a broad range of\ntemperatures and electron degeneracy parameter. We use relativistic kinetic\nequations for Compton scattering and compute the photon mean free path as a\nfunction of photon energy by solving the corresponding integral equation in the\ndiffusion limit. As a byproduct we also demonstrate the way to compute photon\nredistribution functions in case of degenerate electrons. We then compute the\nRosseland mean opacity as a function of temperature and electron degeneracy. We\ncompare our results to the previous calculations and find a significant\ndifference in the low-temperature regime and strong degeneracy. We find useful\nanalytical expressions that approximate well the numerical results. We then\nproceed to compute the flux mean opacity and show that in diffusion\napproximation it is nearly identical to the Rosseland mean opacity. We also\nprovide a simple way for accounting for the true absorption in evaluation of\nthe Rosseland and flux mean opacities.\n", "  We propose to simulate a Dirac field near an event horizon using ultracold\natoms in an optical lattice. Such a quantum simulator allows for the\nobservation of the celebrated Unruh effect. Our proposal involves three stages:\n(1) preparation of the ground state of a massless 2D Dirac field in Minkowski\nspacetime; (2) quench of the optical lattice setup to simulate how an\naccelerated observer would view that state; (3) measurement of the local\nquantum fluctuation spectra by one-particle excitation spectroscopy in order to\nsimulate a De Witt detector. According to Unruh's prediction, fluctuations\nmeasured in such a way must be thermal. Moreover, following Takagi's inversion\ntheorem, they will obey the Bose-Einstein distribution, which will smoothly\ntransform into the Fermi-Dirac as one of the dimensions of the lattice is\nreduced.\n", "  We show that the normalized Higgs production $p_T$ and $y_h$ distributions\nare sensitive probes of Higgs couplings to light quarks. For up and/or down\nquark Yukawa couplings comparable to the SM $b$ quark Yukawa the $\\bar u u$ or\n$\\bar d d$ fusion production of the Higgs could lead to appreciable softer\n$p_T$ distribution than in the SM. The rapidity distribution, on the other\nhand, becomes more forward. We find that, owing partially to a downward\nfluctuation, one can derive competitive bounds on the two couplings using ATLAS\nmeasurements of normalized $p_T$ distribution at 8\\,TeV. With 300 fb${}^{-1}$\nat 13\\,TeV LHC one could establish flavor non-universality of the Yukawa\ncouplings in the down sector.\n", "  Two types of solute-solute interactions are investigated in this work.\nQuadrupole interactions caused by nearby Ag-solute atoms were measured at\nnuclei of 111In/Cd solute probe atoms in the binary compound GdAl2 using the\nmethod of perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC). Locations of\nIn-probes and Ag-solutes on both Gd- and Al-sublattices were identified by\ncomparing site fractions in Gd-poor and Gd-rich GdAl2(Ag) samples. Interaction\nenthalpies between solute-atom pairs were determined from temperature\ndependences of observed site fractions. Repulsive interactions were observed\nfor close-neighbor complexes In/Gd/+Ag/Gd/ and In/Gd/+Ag/Al/ pairs, whereas a\nslightly attractive interaction was observed for In/Al/+Ag/Al/. Interaction\nenthalpies were all in the range +/- 0.15 eV. Temperature dependences of site\nfractions of In-probes on locally defect-free Gd- and Al-sites yields a\ntransfer enthalpy that was found to be 0.343 eV in a previous study of undoped\nGdAl2. The corresponding values in GdAl2(Ag) samples are much smaller. This is\nattributed to competition of In- and Ag-solutes to occupy sites of the same\nsublattice. While the difference in site-enthalpies of In-solutes on Gd- and\nAl-sites is temperature independent, it is proposed that the transfer of\nAg-solutes from Gd- to Al-sites leads to a large temperature dependence of\ndegeneracies of levels available to In-solutes, resulting in an effective\ntransfer enthalpy that is much smaller than the difference in site-enthalpies.\n", "  We employ density-functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) and its extensions GGA+$U$ and GGA+Gutzwiller to calculate\nthe magnetic exchange couplings between pairs of Mn ions substituting Cd in a\nCdTe crystal at very small doping. DFT(GGA) overestimates the exchange\ncouplings by a factor of three because it underestimates the charge-transfer\ngap in Mn-doped II-VI semiconductors. Fixing the nearest-neighbor coupling\n$J_1$ to its experimental value in GGA+$U$, in GGA+Gutzwiller, or by a simple\nscaling of the DFT(GGA) results provides acceptable values for the exchange\ncouplings at 2nd, 3rd, and 4th neighbor distances in Cd(Mn)Te, Zn(Mn)Te,\nZn(Mn)Se, and Zn(Mn)S. In particular, we recover the experimentally observed\nrelation $J_4>J_2,J_3$. The filling of the Mn 3$d$-shell is not integer which\nputs the underlying Heisenberg description into question. However, using a\nfew-ion toy model the picture of a slightly extended local moment emerges so\nthat an integer $3d$-shell filling is not a prerequisite for equidistant\nmagnetization plateaus, as seen in experiment.\n", "  We lift the set of classical non-local symmetries recently studied by Klose,\nLoebbert, and M\\\"unkler in the context of $\\mathbb Z_2$ cosets to the pure\nspinor description of the superstring in the $AdS_5\\times S^5$ background.\n", "  Floodlight quantum key distribution (FL-QKD) is a radically different QKD\nparadigm that can achieve Gbit/s secret-key rates over metropolitan area\ndistances without multiplexing [Phys. Rev. A 94, 012322 (2016)]. It is a\ntwo-way protocol that transmits many photons per bit duration and employs a\nhigh-gain optical amplifier, neither of which can be utilized by existing QKD\nprotocols to mitigate channel loss. FL-QKD uses an optical bandwidth that is\nsubstantially larger than the modulation rate and performs decoding with a\nunique broadband homodyne receiver. Essential to FL-QKD is Alice's injection of\nphotons from a photon-pair source--in addition to the light used for key\ngeneration--into the light she sends to Bob. This injection enables Alice and\nBob to quantify Eve's intrusion and thus secure FL-QKD against collective\nattacks. Our proof-of-concept experiment included 10 dB propagation\nloss--equivalent to 50 km of low-loss fiber--and achieved a 55 Mbit/s\nsecret-key rate (SKR) for a 100 Mbit/s modulation rate, as compared to the\nstate-of-the-art system's 1 Mbit/s SKR for a 1 Gbit/s modulation rate [Opt.\nExpress 21, 24550-24565 (2013)], representing ~500-fold and ~50-fold\nimprovements in secret-key efficiency (SKE) (bits per channel use) and SKR\n(bits per second), respectively.\n", "  We consider tree level form factors of operators from stress tensor operator\nsupermultiplet with light-like operator momentum $q^2=0$. We present a\nconjecture for the Grassmannian integral representation both for these tree\nlevel form factors as well as for leading singularities of their loop\ncounterparts. The presented conjecture was successfully checked by reproducing\nseveral known answers in $\\mbox{MHV}$ and $\\mbox{N}^{k-2}\\mbox{MHV}$, $k\\geq3$\nsectors together with appropriate soft limits. We also discuss the cancellation\nof spurious poles and relations between different BCFW representations for such\nform factors on simple examples.\n", "  Given a set of differential forms on an odd-dimensional noncommutative\nmanifold valued in an internal associative algebra H, we show that the most\ngeneral cubic covariant Hamiltonian action, without mass terms, is controlled\nby an Z_2-graded associative algebra F with a graded symmetric nondegenerate\nbilinear form. The resulting class of models provide a natural generalization\nof the Frobenius-Chern-Simons model (FCS) that was proposed in arXiv:1505.04957\nas an off-shell formulation of the minimal bosonic four-dimensional higher spin\ngravity theory. If F is unital and the Z_2-grading is induced from a Klein\noperator that is outer to a proper Frobenius subalgebra, then the action can be\nwritten on a form akin to topological open string field theory in terms of a\nsuperconnection valued in the direct product of H and F. We give a new model of\nthis type based on a twisting of C[Z_2 x Z_4], which leads to self-dual\ncomplexified gauge fields on AdS_4. If F is 3-graded, the FCS model can be\ntruncated consistently as to zero-form constraints on-shell. Two examples\nthereof are a twisting of C[(Z_2)^3] that yields the original model, and the\nClifford algebra Cl_2n which provides an FCS formulation of the bosonic\nKonstein--Vasiliev model with gauge algebra hu(4^{n-1},0).\n", "  For disordered interacting quantum systems, the sensitivity of the spectrum\nto twisted boundary conditions depending on an infinitesimal angle $\\phi$ can\nbe used to analyze the Many-Body-Localization Transition. The sensitivity of\nthe energy levels $E_n(\\phi)$ is measured by the level curvature $K_n=E_n\"(0)$,\nor more precisely by the Thouless dimensionless curvature $k_n=K_n/\\Delta_n$,\nwhere $\\Delta_n$ is the level spacing that decays exponentially with the size\n$L$ of the system. For instance $\\Delta_n \\propto 2^{-L}$ in the middle of the\nspectrum of quantum spin chains of $L$ spins, while the Drude weight $D_n=L\nK_n$ studied recently by M. Filippone, P.W. Brouwer, J. Eisert and F. von Oppen\n[arxiv:1606.07291v1] involves a different rescaling. The sensitivity of the\neigenstates $\\vert \\psi_n(\\phi) > $ is characterized by the susceptibility\n$\\chi_n=-F_n\"(0)$ of the fidelity $F_n =\\vert < \\psi_n(0) \\vert \\psi_n(\\phi)\n>\\vert $. Both observables are distributed with probability distributions\ndisplaying power-law tails $P_{\\beta}(k) \\simeq A_{\\beta} \\vert k\n\\vert^{-(2+\\beta)} $ and $Q(\\chi) \\simeq B_{\\beta} \\chi^{-\\frac{3+\\beta}{2}} $,\nwhere $\\beta$ is the level repulsion index taking the values $\\beta^{GOE}=1$ in\nthe ergodic phase and $\\beta^{loc}=0$ in the localized phase. The amplitudes\n$A_{\\beta}$ and $B_{\\beta}$ of these two heavy tails are given by some moments\nof the off-diagonal matrix element of the local current operator between two\nnearby energy levels, whose probability distribution has been proposed as a\ncriterion for the Many-Body-Localization transition by M. Serbyn, Z. Papic and\nD.A. Abanin [Phys. Rev. X 5, 041047 (2015)].\n", "  We propose a topological approach suitable to establish a connection between\nthermodynamics and topology in the microcanonical ensemble. Indeed, we report\non results that point to the possibility of describing {\\it interacting\nclassical spin systems} in the thermodynamic limit, including the occurrence of\na phase transition, using topology arguments only. Our approach relies on Morse\ntheory, through the determination of the critical points of the potential\nenergy, which is the proper Morse function. Our main finding is to show that,\nin the context of the studied classical models, the Euler characteristic\n$\\chi(E)$ embeds the necessary features for a correct description of several\nmagnetic thermodynamic quantities of the systems, such as the magnetization,\ncorrelation function, susceptibility, and critical temperature. Despite the\nclassical nature of the studied models, such quantities are those that do not\nviolate the laws of thermodynamics [with the proviso that Van der Waals loop\nstates are mean field (MF) artifacts]. We also discuss the subtle connection\nbetween our approach using the Euler entropy, defined by the logarithm of the\nmodulus of $\\chi(E)$ per site, and that using the {\\it Boltzmann}\nmicrocanonical entropy. Moreover, the results suggest that the loss of\nregularity in the Morse function is associated with the occurrence of unstable\nand metastable thermodynamic solutions in the MF case. The reliability of our\napproach is tested in two exactly soluble systems: the infinite-range and the\nshort-range $XY$ models in the presence of a magnetic field. In particular, we\nconfirm that the topological hypothesis holds for both the infinite-range ($T_c\n\\neq 0$) and the short-range ($T_c = 0$) $XY$ models. Further studies are very\ndesirable in order to clarify the extension of the validity of our proposal.\n", "  The theory of EPI with strong forward scattering peak (FSP)[1-3] is recently\napplied in [4-5] in studying high Tc(~100 K) in a FeSe grown on SrTiO3 [4] and\nTiO2 [6]. The EPI is due to a long-range dipolar electric field created by the\nhigh-energy oxygen vibrations (E0~90 meV) at the interface [4-5]. Besides\nobtaining new results we also correct some misleading results from the recent\nliterature. We show that the mean-field critical temperature Tc0 is an\ninterplay between the maximal pairing potential and the FSP-width qc. For\nTc0~100 K the gap (G) is G~16 meV in agreement with ARPES experiments. We find\nthat in leading order Tc0 is mass-independent and there is small oxygen isotope\neffect in next to leading order. In clean systems Tc0 for s-wave and d-wave\npairing is degenerate but both are affected by non-magnetic impurities. The\nnon-magnetic impurities are pair-weakening in the s-channel and pair-breaking\nin the d-channel. The normal state self-energy at the Fermi surface gives rise\nto the ARPES quasiparticle band at E=0 and to a replica band at\nEr=-E0(1+l(m))^1/2, respectively. The EPI coupling l(m), which enters the\nself-energy, is mass-dependent - the fact overlooked in the literature, makes\nat low energies the slope of the self-energy mass-dependent. The smallness of\nthe oxygen isotope effect in Tc0 and its presence in the self-energy in FeSe\nfilms on SrTiO3 and TiO2 is a smoking-gun experiment for the application of the\nEPI-FSP theory to these systems. The EPI-FSP theory predicts a large number of\nlow-laying pairing states (above the ground state) thus causing internal pair\nfluctuations. The latter reduce Tc0 additionally, by creating a pseudogap state\nfor Tc<T<Tc0. Possibilities to increase Tc0 by designing novel structures are\ndiscussed in the framework of the EPI-FSP theory.\n", "  In this paper, the design of superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors\nwhich are insensitive to the polarization of the incident light is\ninvestigated. By using high-refractive-index dielectrics, the index mismatch\nbetween the nanowire and the surrounding media is reduced. This enhances the\nabsorption of light with electric field vector perpendicular to the nanowire\nsegments, which is generally hindered in this kind of detectors. Building on\nthis principle and focusing on NbTiN nanowire devices, we present several\neasy-to-realize cavity architectures which allow high absorption efficiency (in\nexcess of 90%) and polarization insensitivity simultaneously. Designs based on\nultranarrow nanowires, for which the polarization sensitivity is much more\nmarked, are also presented. Finally, we briefly discuss the specific advantages\nof this approach in the case of WSi or MoSi nanowires.\n", "  We consider a theory with composite top quarks but an elementary Higgs boson.\nThe hierarchy problem can be solved by supplementing TeV scale top\ncompositeness with either supersymmetry or Higgs compositeness appearing at the\nmulti-TeV scale. The Higgs boson couples to uncolored partons within the top\nquark. We study how this approach can give rise to a novel screening effect\nthat suppresses production of the colored top partners at the LHC. Strong\nconstraints arise from Z to bb, as well potentially from flavor physics.\nIndependent of flavor considerations, current constraints imply a compositeness\nscale near a TeV; this implies that the model is likely tuned at the percent\nlevel. Four top quark production at the LHC is a smoking-gun probe of this\nscenario. New CP violation in D meson mixing is also possible.\n", "  The cosmic horseshoe gravitational lens is analyzed using the perturbative\napproach. The two first order perturbative fields are expanded in Fourier\nseries. The source is reconstructed using a fine adaptive grid. The expansion\nof the fields at order 2 produces a higher value of the chi-square. Expanding\nat order 3 provides a very significant improvement, while order 4 does not\nbring a significant improvement over order 3. The presence of the order 3 terms\nis not a consequence of limiting the perturbative expansion to the first order.\nThe amplitude and signs of the third order terms are recovered by including the\ncontribution of the other group members. This analysis demonstrates that the\nfine details of the potential of the lens could be recovered independently of\nany assumptions by using the perturbative approach.\n", "  Strong gravitational lenses with measured time delays between the multiple\nimages allow a direct measurement of the time-delay distance to the lens, and\nthus a measure of cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant,\n$H_{0}$. We present a blind lens model analysis of the quadruply-imaged quasar\nlens HE 0435-1223 using deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging, updated time-delay\nmeasurements from the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses\n(COSMOGRAIL), a measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy based\non Keck data, and a characterization of the mass distribution along the line of\nsight. HE 0435-1223 is the third lens analyzed as a part of the $H_{0}$ Lenses\nin COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring (H0LiCOW) project. We account for various sources of\nsystematic uncertainty, including the detailed treatment of nearby perturbers,\nthe parameterization of the galaxy light and mass profile, and the regions used\nfor lens modeling. We constrain the effective time-delay distance to be\n$D_{\\Delta t} = 2612_{-191}^{+208}~\\mathrm{Mpc}$, a precision of 7.6%. From HE\n0435-1223 alone, we infer a Hubble constant of $H_{0} =\n73.1_{-6.0}^{+5.7}~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ assuming a flat $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology. The cosmographic inference based on the three lenses analyzed by\nH0LiCOW to date is presented in a companion paper (H0LiCOW Paper V).\n", "  Impurity-doping is an exciting new technology in the field of SRF, producing\ncavities with record-high quality factor $Q_0$ and BCS surface resistance that\ndecreases with increasing RF field. Recent theoretical work has offered a\npromising explanation for this anti-Q-slope, but the link between the\ndecreasing surface resistance and the short mean free path of doped cavities\nhas remained elusive. In this work we investigate this link, finding that the\nmagnitude of this decrease varies directly with the mean free path: shorter\nmean free paths correspond with stronger anti-Q-slopes. We draw a theoretical\nconnection between the mean free path and the overheating of the\nquasiparticles, which leads to the reduction of the anti-Q-slope towards the\nnormal Q-slope of long-mean-free-path cavities. We also investigate the\nsensitivity of the residual resistance to trapped magnetic flux, a property\nwhich is greatly enhanced for doped cavities, and calculate an optimal doping\nregime for a given amount of trapped flux.\n", "  This paper presents the design, fabrication, and experimental\ncharacterization of monolithically integrated p-n junction InGaN/GaN multiple\nquantum well diodes (MQWDs) and suspended waveguides. Suspended MQWDs can be\nused as transmitters and receivers simultaneously, and suspended waveguides are\nused for light coupling to create an in-plane visible light communication\nsystem. Compared to the waveguide with separation trench, the calculated total\nlight efficiency is increased from 18% to 22% for the continuous waveguide. The\nMQWDs are characterized by their typical current-voltage performance, and the\npulse excitation measurements confirm that the InGaN/GaN MQWDs can achieve the\nlight emission and photodetection at the same time. The photocurrent\nmeasurements indicate that the photocurrent is modulated by a bias voltage and\nthat the photons are being supplied from another transmitter. An experimental\ndemonstration is presented showing that the proposed device works well for\nin-plane full-duplex communication using visible light.\n", "  We consider using particle production as a friction force by which to\nimplement a \"Relaxion\" solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem. Using\nthis approach, we are able to avoid superplanckian field excursions and avoid\nany conflict with the strong CP problem. The relaxation mechanism can work\nbefore, during or after inflation allowing for inflationary dynamics to play an\nimportant role or to be completely decoupled.\n", "  We present a new measurement of the Hubble Constant H0 and other cosmological\nparameters based on the joint analysis of three multiply-imaged quasar systems\nwith measured gravitational time delays. First, we measure the time delay of\nHE0435-1223 from 13-year light curves obtained as part of the COSMOGRAIL\nproject. Companion papers detail the modeling of the main deflectors and line\nof sight effects, and how these data are combined to determine the time-delay\ndistance of HE 0435-1223. Crucially, the measurements are carried out blindly\nwith respect to cosmological parameters in order to avoid confirmation bias. We\nthen combine the time-delay distance of HE0435-1223 with previous measurements\nfrom systems B1608+656 and RXJ1131-1231 to create a Time Delay Strong Lensing\nprobe (TDSL). In flat $\\Lambda$CDM with free matter and energy density, we find\n$H_0$ = 71.9 +2.4 -3.0 km/s/Mpc and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ = 0.62 +0.24 -0.35 .\nThis measurement is completely independent of, and in agreement with, the local\ndistance ladder measurements of H0. We explore more general cosmological models\ncombining TDSL with other probes, illustrating its power to break degeneracies\ninherent to other methods. The TDSL and Planck joint constraints are $H_0$ =\n69.2 +1.4 -2.2 km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ = 0.70 +0.01 -0.01 and $\\Omega_k$ =\n0.003 +0.004 -0.006 in open $\\Lambda$CDM and $H_0$ = 79.0 +4.4 -4.2 km/s/Mpc,\n$\\Omega_{de}$ = 0.77 +0.02 -0.03 and $w$ = -1.38 +0.14 -0.16 in flat $w$CDM.\nCombined with Planck and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data, when relaxing the\nconstraints on the numbers of relativistic species we find $N_{eff}$ = 3.34\n+0.21 -0.21 and when relaxing the total mass of neutrinos we find 0.182 eV. In\nan open $w$CDM in combination with Planck and CMB lensing we find $H_0$ = 77.9\n+5.0 -4.2 km/s/Mpc, $\\Omega_{de}$ = 0.77 +0.03 -0.03, $\\Omega_k$ = -0.003\n+0.004 -0.004 and $w$ = -1.37 +0.18 -0.23.\n", "  We present a general method for computing Hodge numbers for Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds realised as discrete quotients of complete intersections in products\nof projective spaces. The method relies on the computation of equivariant\ncohomologies and is illustrated for several explicit examples. In this way, we\ncompute the Hodge numbers for all discrete quotients obtained in Braun's\nclassification arXiv:1003.3235.\n", "  In high density quark matter under a strong external magnetic field, possible\nphases are investigated by using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with\ntensor-type four-point interaction between quarks, as well as the\naxial-vector-type four-point interaction. In the tensor-type interaction under\nthe strong external magnetic field, it is shown that a quark spin polarized\nphase is realized in all regions of the quark chemical potential under\nconsideration within the lowest Landau level approximation. In the\naxial-vector-type interaction, it is also shown that the quark spin polarized\nphase appears in the wide range of the quark chemical potential. In both the\ninteractions, the quark mass in zero and small chemical potential regions\nincreases which indicates that the chiral symmetry breaking is enhanced, namely\nthe magnetic catalysis occurs.\n", "  We show that, when compactified on a circle, N=(2,0),d=6 supergravity coupled\nto 1 tensor multiplet and nV vector multiplets is dual to N=(2,0),d=6\nsupergravity coupled to just nT=nV+1 tensor multiplets and no vector\nmultiplets. Both theories reduce to the same models of N=2,d=5 supergravity\ncoupled to nV5=nV+2 vector fields. We derive Buscher rules that relate\nsolutions of these theories (and of the theory that one obtains by dualizing\nthe 3-form field strength) admitting an isometry. Since the relations between\nthe fields of N=2,d=5 supergravity and those of the 6-dimensional theories are\nthe same with or without gaugings, we construct supersymmetric non-Abelian\nsolutions of the 6-dimensional gauged theories by uplifting the recently found\n5-dimensional supersymmetric non-Abelian black-hole solutions. The solutions\ndescribe the usual superpositions of strings and waves supplemented by a BPST\ninstanton in the transverse directions. One of the solutions obtained\ninterpolates smoothly between two AdS3xS3 geometries with different radii.\n", "  We study the fluid drift due to a time-dependent dumbbell model of a\nmicroswimmer. The model captures important aspects of real microswimmers such\nas a time-dependent flagellar motion and a no-slip body. The model consists of\na rigid sphere for the body and a time-dependent moving Stokeslet representing\nthe flagella. We analyze the paths of idealized fluid particles displaced by\nthe swimmer. The simplicity of the model allows some asymptotic calculations\nvery near and far away from the swimmer. The displacements of particles near\nthe swimmer diverge in a manner similar to an isolated no-slip sphere, but with\na smaller coefficient due to the action of the flagellum. Far from the swimmer,\nthe time dependence becomes negligible due to both being very fast and decaying\nwith distance. Finally, we compute the probability distribution of particle\ndisplacements, and find that our model has fatter tails than previous steady\nmodels, due to the presence of a no-slip surface that drags particles along.\n", "  A relative coordinate breathing mode in the quantum Hall system is predicted\nto exist with different behavior under either Coulomb or dipole-dipole\ninteractions. While Kohn's theorem predicts that any relative coordinate\ninteraction will fail to alter the center of mass energy spectrum, it can\naffect excitations in the relative coordinates. One such collective excitation,\nwhich we call the hyperradial breathing mode, emerges naturally from a\nfew-body, hyperspherical representation of the problem and depends on the\ninter-particle interactions, the ground state wave function, and the number of\nparticles participating in the excitation. Possible observations of this\nexcitation will be discussed in the context of both cold rotating atomic\nsimulations and conventional quantum Hall experiments.\n", "  We reported a new result of the neutral impurity scattering of holes that has\nimpact on the charge drift mobility in high purity p-type germanium crystals at\n77 Kelvin. The charge carrier concentration, mobility and resistivity are\nmeasured by Hall Effect system at 77 Kelvin. We investigated the contribution\nto the total charge drift mobility from ionized impurity scattering, lattice\nscattering, and neutral impurity scattering with the best theoretical models\nand experimental data. Several samples with measured Hall mobility from the\ngrown crystals are used for this investigation. With the measured Hall mobility\nand ionized impurity concentration as well as the theoretical models, we\ncalculated the neutral impurity concentration by the Matthiessen's rule. As a\nresult, the distributions of the neutral impurity concentrations with respect\nto the radius of the crystals are obtained. Consequently, we demonstrated that\nneutral impurity scattering is a significant contribution to the charge drift\nmobility, which has dependence on the concentration of neutral impurities in a\ngiven germanium crystal.\n", "  Injection-locked semiconductor lasers can be brought to a neuron-like\nexcitable regime when parameters are set close to the unlocking transition.\nHere we study experimentally the response of this system to repeated optical\nperturbations and observe the existence of a refractory period during which\nperturbations are not able to elicit an excitable response. The results are\nanalyzed via simulations of a set of dynamical equations which reproduced\nadequately the experimental results.\n", "  We introduce a theoretical scheme for the analog quantum simulation of\nlong-range XYZ models using current trapped-ion technology. In order to achieve\nfully-tunable Heisenberg-type interactions, our proposal requires a\nstate-dependent dipole force along a single vibrational axis, together with a\ncombination of standard resonant and detuned carrier drivings. We discuss how\nthis quantum simulator could explore the effect of long-range interactions on\nthe phase diagram by combining an adiabatic protocol with the quasi-periodic\ndrivings and test the validity of our scheme numerically. At the isotropic\nHeisenberg point, we show that the long-range Hamiltonian can be mapped onto a\nnon-linear sigma model with a topological term that is responsible for its\nlow-energy properties, and we benchmark our predictions with\nMatrix-Product-State numerical simulations.\n", "  Following an approach of Matarrese and Pietroni, we derive the functional\nrenormalization group (RG) flow of the effective action of cosmological\nlarge-scale structures. Perturbative solutions of this RG flow equation are\nshown to be consistent with standard cosmological perturbation theory.\nNon-perturbative approximate solutions can be obtained by truncating the a\npriori infinite set of possible effective actions to a finite subspace. Using\nfor the truncated effective action a form dictated by dissipative fluid\ndynamics, we derive RG flow equations for the scale dependence of the effective\nviscosity and sound velocity of non-interacting dark matter, and we solve them\nnumerically. Physically, the effective viscosity and sound velocity account for\nthe interactions of long-wavelength fluctuations with the spectrum of\nsmaller-scale perturbations. We find that the RG flow exhibits an attractor\nbehaviour in the IR that significantly reduces the dependence of the effective\nviscosity and sound velocity on the input values at the UV scale. This allows\nfor a self-contained computation of matter and velocity power spectra for which\nthe sensitivity to UV modes is under control.\n", "  The generation of photocurrent in condensed matter is of main interest for\nphotovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Shift current, a nonlinear\nphotoresponse, has attracted recent intensive attention as a dominant player of\nbulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric materials. In three dimensional\ntopological insulators $\\text{Bi}_2\\text{X}_3$ (X: Te, Se), we find that Dirac\nsurface states with a hexagonal warping term carry shift current by linearly\npolarized light. In addition, shift spin-current is introduced with the\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking perturbation. The estimate for the magnitudes\nof the shift charge- and spin-currents are 0.13$I_0$ and 0.21$I_0$(nA/m) with\nthe intensity of light $I_0$ measured in $(\\text{W}/\\text{m}^2)$, respectively,\nwhich can offer a useful method to generate these currents efficiently.\n", "  We report on the analysis of NuSTAR observations of the Be-transient X-ray\npulsar V 0332+53 during the giant outburst in 2015 and another minor outburst\nin 2016. We confirm the cyclotron-line energy-luminosity correlation previously\nreported in the source and the line energy decrease during the giant outburst.\nBased on 2016 observations, we find that a year later the line energy has\nincreased again essentially reaching the pre-outburst values. We discuss this\nbehaviour and conclude that it is likely caused by a change of the emission\nregion geometry rather than previously suggested accretion-induced decay of the\nneutron stars magnetic field. At lower luminosities, we find for the first time\na hint of departure from the anticorrelation of line energy with flux, which we\ninterpret as a transition from super- to sub-critical accretion associated with\nthe disappearance of the accretion column. Finally, we confirm and briefly\ndiscuss the orbital modulation observed in the outburst light curve of the\nsource.\n", "  We propose the reduced-shifted Conjugate-Gradient (RSCG) method, which is\nnumerically efficient to calculate a matrix element of a Green's function\ndefined as a resolvent of a Hamiltonian operator, by solving linear equations\nwith a desired accuracy. This method does not calculate solution vectors of\nlinear equations but does directly calculate a matrix element of the resolvent.\nThe matrix elements with different frequencies are simultaneously obtained.\nThus, it is easy to calculate the exception value expressed as a Matsubara\nsummation of these elements. To illustrate a power of our method, we choose a\nnano-structured superconducting system with a mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes\n(BdG) approach. This method allows us to treat with the system with the\nfabrication potential, where one can not effectively use the\nkernel-polynomial-based method. We consider the d-wave nano-island\nsuperconductor by simultaneously solving the linear equations with a large\nnumber (~ 50000) of Matsubara frequencies.\n", "  Light sterile neutrinos represent a well-motivated extension of the\n3-neutrino paradigm. However, the impressive agreement between standard\ncosmology and data casts doubts on their existence. Here we present a class of\nscenarios that robustly avoids this tension. In these models the sterile\nneutrinos are light, chiral states of a new sector interacting with the\nStandard Model via the right-handed neutrino portal and, crucially,\nactive-sterile neutrino oscillations require a phase transition in the hidden\nsector. We explore the hidden-couplings/critical-temperature plane and identify\nregions where several sterile neutrinos can be accommodated. A late phase\ntransition is usually preferred and may also ward off a potential threat posed\nby the formation of topologically stable defects.\n", "  A phantom solution in the framework of the causal Israel-Stewart (IS)\nformalism is discussed. We assume a late time behavior of the cosmic evolution\nby considering only one dominant matter fluid with viscosity. In the model it\nis assumed a bulk viscosity of the form $\\xi= \\xi_{0}\\rho^{1/2}$, where $\\rho$\nis the energy density of the fluid. We evaluate and discuss the behavior of the\nthermodynamical parameters associated to this solution, like the temperature,\nrate of entropy, entropy, relaxation time, effective pressure and effective\nEoS. A discussion about the assumption of near equilibrium of the formalism and\nthe accelerated expansion of the solution is presented. The solution allows to\ncross the phantom divide without evoking an exotic matter fluid and the\neffective EoS parameter is always lesser than $-1$ and time independent. A\nfuture singularity (big rip) occurs, but different from the Type I (big rip)\nsolution classified in S. Nojiri, S. D. Odintsov and S. Tsujikawa, Phys. Rev. D\n71, 063004 (2005), if we consider others thermodynamics parameters like, for\nexample, the effective pressure in the presence of viscosity or the relaxation\ntime.\n", "  We study the asymptotic dynamics of arbitrary linear quantum open systems\nwhich are periodically driven while coupled with generic bosonic reservoirs. We\nobtain exact results for the heat flowing into the network, which are valid\nbeyond the usual weak coupling or Markovian approximations. We prove the\nvalidity of the dynamical third law of thermodynamics (Nernst unattainability\nprinciple), showing that the ultimate limit for cooling is imposed by a\nfundamental heating mechanism which becomes dominant at low temperatures: the\nnon resonant creation of pairs of excitations in the reservoirs induced by the\ndriving field. This quantum effect, which is missed in the weak coupling\napproximation, restores the unattainability principle whose validity was\nrecently challenged.\n", "  We present a study of the Very Degenerate Higgsino Dark Matter (DM), whose\nmass splitting between the lightest neutral and charged components is ${\\cal\nO}$(1) MeV, much smaller than radiative splitting of 355 MeV. The scenario is\nrealized in the minimal supersymmetric standard model by small gaugino mixing.\nIn contrast to the pure Higgsino DM with the radiative splitting only, various\nobservable signatures with distinct features are induced. First of all, the\nvery small mass splitting makes (a) sizable Sommerfeld enhancement and\nRamsauer-Townsend (RT) suppression relevant to ~1 TeV Higgsino DM, and (b)\nSommerfeld-Ramsauer-Townsend effect saturate at lower velocities $v/c \\lesssim\n10^{-3}$. As a result, annihilation signals can be large enough to be observed\nfrom the galactic center and/or dwarf galaxies, while relative signal sizes can\nvary depending on the location of Sommerfeld peaks and RT dips. In addition, at\ncollider experiments, stable chargino signature can be searched for to probe\nthe model in the future. DM direct detection signal, however, depends on the\nWino mass; even no detectable signal can be induced if the Wino is heavier than\nabout 10 TeV.\n", "  We introduce a first-principles study to clarify the carrier-scattering\nproperty at the SiC/SiO$_2$. Interestingly, the electron transport at the\nconduction-band edge is significantly affected by the introduction of oxygen,\neven though there are no electrically active defects. The origin of the large\nscattering is explained by the behavior of the internal-space states (ISSs).\nMoreover, the effect of the ISSs is larger than that of the electrically active\ncarbon-related defects. This result indicates that an additional scattering not\nconsidered in a conventional Si/SiO$_2$ occurs at the SiC/SiO$_2$.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo generator that implements significant theoretical\nimprovements in the simulation of top-quark pair production and decay at the\nLHC. Spin correlations and off-shell effects in top-decay chains are described\nin terms of exact matrix elements for $p p \\to\n\\ell^+\\nu_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\ell}\\, l^-\\bar{\\nu}_{\\scriptscriptstyle l} b\n\\bar{b}$ at NLO QCD, where the leptons $\\ell$ and $l$ belong to different\nfamilies, and $b$ quarks are massive. Thus, the contributions from $t\\bar{t}$\nand $Wt$ single-top production as well as their quantum interference are fully\nincluded. Matrix elements are matched to the Pythia8 parton shower using a\nrecently proposed method that allows for a consistent treatment of resonances\nin the POWHEG framework. These theoretical improvements are especially\nimportant for the interpretation of precision measurements of the top-quark\nmass, for single-top analyses in the $Wt$ channel, and for $t\\bar{t}$ and $Wt$\nbackgrounds in the presence of jet vetoes or cuts that enhance off-shell\neffects. The new generator is based on a process-independent interface of the\nOpenLoops amplitude generator with the POWHEGBOX framework.\n", "  In the context of (0,2) gauged linear sigma models, we explore chains of\nperturbatively dual heterotic string compactifications. The notion of target\nspace duality originates in non-geometric phases and can be used to generate\ndistinct GLSMs with shared geometric phases leading to apparently identical\ntarget space theories. To date, this duality has largely been studied at the\nlevel of counting states in the effective theories. We extend this analysis to\nthe effective potential and loci of enhanced symmetry in dual theories. By\nengineering vector bundles with non-trivial constraints arising from\nslope-stability (i.e. D-terms) and holomorphy (i.e. F-terms) the detailed\nstructure of the vacuum space of the dual theories can be explored. Our results\ngive new evidence that GLSM target space duality may provide important hints\ntowards a more complete understanding of (0,2) string dualities.\n", "  We study the association and dissociation dynamics of weakly bound\nheteronuclear Feshbach molecules using transverse RF-fields for expected\nparameters accessible through the microgravity environment of NASA's Cold Atom\nLaboratory (CAL) aboard the International Space Station, including temperatures\nat or below nK and atomic densities as low as $10^8$/cm$^3$. We show that under\nsuch conditions, thermal and loss effects can be greatly suppressed resulting\nin high efficiency in both association and dissociation of Feshbach molecules\nwith mean size exceeding 10$^4a_0$, and allowing for the coherence in\natom-molecule transitions to be clearly observable. Our theoretical model for\nheteronuclear mixtures includes thermal, loss, and density effects in a simple\nand conceptually clear manner. We derive the temperature, density and\nscattering length regimes of $^{41}$K-$^{87}$Rb that allow optimal\nassociation/dissociation efficiency with minimal heating and loss to guide\nfuture experiments with ultracold atomic gases in space.\n", "  In present study, we search the lambda magic number in hypernuclei within the\nframework of relativistic mean field theory (RMF) with inclusion of\nhyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon potentials. Based on one- and two-lambda\nseparation energy and two-lambda shell gap, 2, 8, 14, 18, 20, 28, 34, 40, 50,\n58, 68, 70 and 82 are suggested to be the $\\Lambda$ magic number within the\npresent approach. The weakening strength of $\\Lambda$ spin-orbit interaction is\nresponsible for emerging the new lambda shell closure other than the model\nscheme. The predicted $\\Lambda$ magic numbers are in remarkable agreement with\nearlier predictions and hypernuclear magicity quite resembles with nuclear\nmagicity. %Our results also support the nuclear magicity, Our results are\nsupported by nuclear magicity, where neutron number N = 34 is experimentally\nobserved as a magic which is one of the $\\Lambda$ closed shell in our\npredictions. In addition, the stability of hypernuclei is also examined by\ncalculating the binding energy per particle, where Ni hypernucleus is found to\nbe most tightly bound triply magic system in considered hypernuclei. Nucleon\nand lambda density distributions are observed and it is found that introduced\n$\\Lambda$'s have significant impact on total density and reduces the central\ndepression of the core nucleus. Nucleon and lambda mean field potentials and\nspin-orbit interaction potentials are also observed for predicted triply magic\nhypernuclei and the addition of $\\Lambda$'s affect the both the potentials to a\nlarge extent. The single-particle energy levels are also analyzed to explain\nthe shell gaps for triply magic multi-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei.\n", "  We test a class of holographic models for the very early universe against\ncosmological observations and find that they are competitive to the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. These models are based on three dimensional\nperturbative super-renormalizable Quantum Field Theory (QFT), and while they\npredict a different power spectrum from the standard power-law used in\n$\\Lambda$CDM, they still provide an excellent fit to data (within their regime\nof validity). By comparing the Bayesian evidence for the models, we find that\n$\\Lambda$CDM does a better job globally, while the holographic models provide a\n(marginally) better fit to data without very low multipoles (i.e. $l\\lesssim\n30$), where the dual QFT becomes non-perturbative. Observations can be used to\nexclude some QFT models, while we also find models satisfying all\nphenomenological constraints: the data rules out the dual theory being\nYang-Mills theory coupled to fermions only, but allows for Yang-Mills theory\ncoupled to non-minimal scalars with quartic interactions. Lattice simulations\nof 3d QFT's can provide non-perturbative predictions for large-angle statistics\nof the cosmic microwave background, and potentially explain its apparent\nanomalies.\n", "  We introduce an intermediate quantum computing model built from\ntranslation-invariant Ising-interacting spins. Despite being non-universal, the\nmodel cannot be classically efficiently simulated unless the polynomial\nhierarchy collapses. Equipped with the intrinsic single-instance-hardness\nproperty, a single fixed unitary evolution in our model is sufficient to\nproduce classically intractable results, compared to several other models that\nrely on implementation of an ensemble of different unitaries (instances). We\npropose a feasible experimental scheme to implement our Hamiltonian model using\ncold atoms trapped in a square optical lattice. We formulate a procedure to\ncertify the correct functioning of this quantum machine. The certification\nrequires only a polynomial number of local measurements assuming measurement\nimperfections are sufficiently small.\n", "  The total $W$-boson decay width $\\Gamma_W$ is an important observable which\nallows testing of the standard model. The current world average value is based\non direct measurements of final state kinematic properties of $W$-boson decays,\nand has a relative uncertainty of 2%. The indirect determination of $\\Gamma_W$\nvia the cross-section measurements of vector-boson production can lead to a\nsimilar accuracy. The same methodology leads also to a determination of the\nleptonic branching ratio. This approach has been successfully pursued by the\nCDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron collider, as well as by the CMS\ncollaboration at the LHC. In this paper we present for the first time a\ncombination of the available measurements at hadron colliders, accounting for\nthe correlations of the associated systematic uncertainties. Our combination\nleads to values of $\\textrm{BR}(W\\rightarrow\\mu\\nu)=(10.72 \\pm 0.16)\\%$ and\n$\\Gamma_W = 2113 \\pm 31$ MeV, respectively, both compatible with the current\nworld averages.\n", "  We studied pure state transformations using local operations assisted by\nfinitely many rounds of classical communication ($LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$) in C.\nSpee, J.I. de Vicente, D. Sauerwein, B. Kraus, arXiv:1606.04418 (2016). Here,\nwe first of all present the details of some of the proofs and generalize the\nconstruction of examples of state transformations via $LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$ which\nrequire a probabilistic step. However, we also present explicit examples of\nSLOCC classes where any separable transformation can be realized by a protocol\nin which each step is deterministic (all-det-$LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$). Such\ntransformations can be considered as natural generalizations of bipartite\ntransformations. Furthermore, we provide examples of pure state transformations\nwhich are possible via separable transformations, but not via\n$LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$. We also analyze an interesting genuinely multipartite\neffect which we call locking or unlocking the power of other parties. This\nmeans that one party can prevent or enable the implementation of LOCC\ntransformations by other parties. Moreover, we investigate the maximally\nentangled set restricted to $LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$ and show how easily computable\nbounds on some entanglement measures can be derived by restricting to\n$LOCC_{\\mathbb{N}}$.\n", "  This is a short communication in reference to the comments in (arXiv:\n1605.05147) of our paper in Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 25, 1650051 (2016). We have\ntried to answer to the comments or criticism in the paper.\n", "  In the present investigation an exact generalized model for anisotropic\ncompact stars of embedding class one is sought for under general relativistic\nbackground. The generic solutions are verified by exploring different physical\naspects, viz. energy conditions, mass-radius relation, stability of the models,\nin connection to their validity. It is observed that the model present here for\ncompact stars is compatible with all these physical tests and thus physically\nacceptable as far as the compact star candidates $RXJ~1856-37$,\n$SAX~J~1808.4-3658~(SS1)$ and $SAX~J~1808.4-3658~(SS2)$ are concerned.\n", "  We study the faces of the set of quantum correlations, i.e., the Bell and\nnoncontextuality inequalities without any quantum violation. First, we\ninvestigate the question whether every proper (tight) Bell inequality for two\nparties, other than the trivial ones from positivity, normalization and\nno-signaling can be violated by quantum correlations, i.e., whether the\nclassical Bell polytope or the smaller correlation polytope share any facets\nwith their respective quantum sets. To do this, we develop a recently derived\nbound on the quantum value of linear games based on the norms of game matrices\nto give a simple sufficient condition to identify linear games with no quantum\nadvantage. Additionally we show how this bound can be extended to the general\nclass of unique games, illustrating it for the case of three outcomes. We then\nshow as a main result that the paradigmatic examples of correlation Bell\ninequalities with no quantum violation, namely the non-local computation games\ndo not constitute tight Bell inequalities, not even for the correlation\npolytope. We also extend this to an arbitrary prime number of outcomes for a\nspecific class of these games. We then study the faces in the simplest CHSH\nBell scenario of binary dichotomic measurements, and identify edges in the set\nof quantum correlations in this scenario.\n  Finally, we relate the non-contextual polytope of single-party correlation\ninequalities with the cut polytope $CUT(\\nabla G)$, where $G$ denotes the\ncompatibility graph of observables in the contextuality scenario and $\\nabla G$\ndenotes the suspension graph of $G$. We observe that there exist tight\nnon-contextuality inequalities with no quantum violation, and furthermore that\nthis set of inequalities is beyond those implied by the Consistent Exclusivity\nprinciple.\n", "  We compare observed far infra-red/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) galaxy spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of massive galaxies ($M_{\\star}\\gtrsim10^{10}$\n$h^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$) derived through a stacking analysis with predictions from\na new model of galaxy formation. The FIR SEDs of the model galaxies are\ncalculated using a self-consistent model for the absorption and re-emission of\nradiation by interstellar dust based on radiative transfer calculations and\nglobal energy balance arguments. Galaxies are selected based on their position\non the specific star formation rate (sSFR) - stellar mass ($M_{\\star}$) plane.\nWe identify a main sequence of star-forming galaxies in the model, i.e. a well\ndefined relationship between sSFR and $M_\\star$, up to redshift $z\\sim6$. The\nscatter of this relationship evolves such that it is generally larger at higher\nstellar masses and higher redshifts. There is remarkable agreement between the\npredicted and observed average SEDs across a broad range of redshifts\n($0.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim4$) for galaxies on the main sequence. However, the\nagreement is less good for starburst galaxies at $z\\gtrsim2$, selected here to\nhave elevated sSFRs$>10\\times$ the main sequence value. We find that the\npredicted average SEDs are robust to changing the parameters of our dust model\nwithin physically plausible values. We also show that the dust temperature\nevolution of main sequence galaxies in the model is driven by star formation on\nthe main sequence being more burst-dominated at higher redshifts.\n", "  The pole structure of the $\\Lambda(1405)$ is examined by fitting the\ncouplings of an underlying Hamiltonian effective field theory to cross sections\nof $K^- p$ scattering in the infinite-volume limit. Finite-volume spectra are\nthen obtained from the theory, and compared to lattice QCD results for the mass\nof the $\\Lambda(1405)$. Momentum-dependent, non-separable potentials motivated\nby the well-known Weinberg-Tomozawa terms are used, with SU(3) flavour symmetry\nbroken in the couplings and masses. In addition, we examine the effect on the\nbehaviour of the spectra from the inclusion of a bare triquark-like\nisospin-zero basis state. It is found that the cross sections are consistent\nwith the experimental data with two complex poles for the $\\Lambda(1405)$,\nregardless of whether a bare baryon basis state is introduced or not. However,\nit is apparent that the bare baryon is important for describing the results of\nlattice QCD at high pion masses.\n", "  A comprehensive first principles study on the electronic topological\ntransition in a number of 122 family of Fe based superconductors is presented.\nDoping as well as temperature driven Lifshitz transitions are found from first\nprinciples simulations in a variety of Fe based superconductors that are\nconsistent with experimental findings. In all the studied compounds the\nLifshitz transitions are consistently found to occur at a doping concentration\nwhere superconductivity is highest and magnetism disappears. Systematically,\nthe Lifshitz transition occurs in the electron Fermi surfaces for hole doping,\nwhereas in hole Fermi surfaces for electron doping as well as iso-electronic\ndoping. Temperature driven Lifshitz transition is found to occur in the\niso-electronic Ru-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ compounds. Fermi surface areas are found\nto carry sensitivity of topological modifications more acutely than the band\nstructures and can be used as a better experimental probe to identify\nelectronic topological transition.\n", "  We study the neutrino flavor evolution in the neutrino-driven wind from a\nbinary neutron star merger remnant consisting of a massive neutron star\nsurrounded by an accretion disk. With the neutrino emission characteristics and\nthe hydrodynamical profile of the remnant consistently extracted from a\nthree-dimensional simulation, we compute the flavor evolution by taking into\naccount neutrino coherent forward scattering off ordinary matter and neutrinos\nthemselves. We employ a \"single-trajectory\" approach to investigate the\ndependence of the flavor evolution on the neutrino emission location and angle.\nWe also show that the flavor conversion in the merger remnant can affect the\n(anti-)neutrino absorption rates on free nucleons and may thus impact the\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis in the wind. We discuss the sensitivity of such\nresults on the change of neutrino emission characteristics, also from different\nneutron star merger simulations.\n", "  We numerically investigate the quantum crystallographic phases of a\nRydberg-dressed Bose gas loaded on a square lattice by using the mean-field\nGross--Pitaevskii model. For a relatively weak lattice confinement, the phases\nof ground state undergo amorphism, polycrystal, and polymorphism following the\nincrease of the blockade radius, and if the confinement is stronger, a single\ncrystal with a specific filling factor will be formed. In order to\ndistinctively characterize these phases, the structure function is also\nstudied. In such an anisotropic system, we report that the first diagonal\nelement of the superfluid-fraction tensor should be a measurable quantity, and\nan anisotropy parameter can be defined. In addition, for such crystallographic\nphases, the interaction potential can manifest where the grain boundaries\nappear.\n", "  Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a technology in which water is desalinated\nby ion electrosorption into the electric double layers (EDLs) of charging\nporous electrodes. In recent years significant advances have been made in\nmodeling the charge and salt dynamics in a CDI cell, but the possible effect of\nsurface transport within diffuse EDLs on these dynamics has not been\ninvestigated. We here present theory which includes surface transport in\ndescribing the dynamics of a charging CDI cell. Through our numerical solution\nto the presented models, the possible effect of surface transport on the CDI\nprocess is elucidated. While at some model conditions surface transport\nenhances the rate of CDI cell charging, counter-intuitively this additional\ntransport pathway is found to slow down cell charging at other model\nconditions.\n", "  In the Littlest Higgs model with $T$ parity (LHT), the $T$-odd heavy photon\n($A_H$) is weakly interacting and can play the role of dark matter. We\ninvestigate the lower limit on the mass of $A_H$ dark matter under the\nconstraints from Higgs data, EWPOs, $R_b$, Planck 2015 dark matter relic\nabundance, PandaX-II/LUX 2016 direct detections and LHC-8 TeV monojet results.\nWe find that (1) Higgs data, EWPOs and $R_b$ can exclude the mass of $A_H$ up\nto 99 GeV. To produce the correct dark matter relic abundance, $A_H$ has to\nco-annihilate with $T$-odd quarks ($q_H$) or leptons ($\\ell_H$); (2) the LUX\n(PandaX-II) 2016 data can further exclude $m_{A_H}<380 (270)$ GeV for\n$\\ell_H$-$A_H$ co-annihilation and $m_{A_H}<350 (240)$ GeV for $q_H-A_H$\nco-annihilation; (3) LHC-8 TeV monojet result can give a strong lower limit,\n$m_{A_H}>540$ GeV, for $q_H$-$A_H$ co-annihilation; (4) future XENON1T (2017)\nexperiment can fully cover the parameter space of $\\ell_H$-$A_H$\nco-annihilation and will push the lower limit of $m_{A_H}$ up to about 640 GeV\nfor $q_H$-$A_H$ co-annihilation.\n", "  Using a finite volume Gradient Flow (GF) renormalization scheme with\nSchr\\\"odinger Functional (SF) boundary conditions, we compute the\nnon-perturbative running coupling in the range $2.2 \\lesssim {\\bar\ng}_\\mathrm{GF}^2(L) \\lesssim 13$. Careful continuum extrapolations turn out to\nbe crucial to reach our high accuracy. The running of the coupling is always\nbetween one-loop and two-loop and very close to one-loop in the region of\n$200\\,{\\rm MeV} \\lesssim \\mu=1/L \\lesssim 4\\,{\\rm GeV}$. While there is no\nconvincing contact to two-loop running, we match non-perturbatively to the SF\ncoupling with background field. In this case we know the $\\mu$ dependence up to\n$\\sim 100\\,{\\rm GeV}$ and can thus connect to the $\\Lambda$-parameter.\n", "  In the large D limit, and under certain circumstances, it has recently been\ndemonstrated that black hole dynamics in asymptotically flat spacetime reduces\nto the dynamics of a non gravitational membrane propagating in flat D\ndimensional spacetime. We demonstrate that this correspondence extends to all\norders in a 1/D expansion and outline a systematic method for deriving the\ncorrected membrane equation in a power series expansion in 1/D. As an\nillustration of our method we determine the first subleading corrections to the\nmembrane equations of motion. A qualitatively new effect at this order is that\nthe divergence of the membrane velocity is nonzero and proportional to the\nsquare of the shear tensor reminiscent of the entropy current of hydrodynamics.\nAs a test, we use our modified membrane equations to compute the corrections to\nfrequencies of light quasinormal modes about the Schwarzschild black hole and\nfind a perfect match with earlier computations performed directly in the\ngravitational bulk.\n", "  The electronic states and optical transitions of a ZnO quantum ring\ncontaining few interacting electrons in an applied magnetic field are found to\nbe very different from those in a conventional semiconductor system, such as a\nGaAs ring. The strong Zeeman and Coulomb interaction of the ZnO system, exert a\nprofound influence on the electron states and on the optical properties of the\nring. In particular, our results indicate that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in\na ZnO quantum ring strongly depends on the electron number. In fact, for two\nelectrons in the ZnO ring, the AB oscillations become aperiodic, while for\nthree electrons (interacting) the AB oscillations completely disappear.\nTherefore, unlike in conventional quantum ring topology, here the AB effect\n(and the resulting persistent current) can be controlled by varying the\nelectron number.\n", "  Ever since the discovery of the record-high thermal conductivity of single\nlayer graphene, thermal transport capability of monolayer 2D materials has been\nunder constant spotlight. Since thermal conductivity is an intensive property\nfor 3D materials and the thickness of 2D materials is not well defined,\ndifferent definitions of thickness in literature have led to ambiguity towards\npredicting thermal conductivity values and thus in understanding the heat\ntransfer capability of different monolayer 2D materials. We argue that if\nconventional definition of thermal conductivity should be used as the quantity\nto compare the heat transfer capability of various monolayer 2D materials, then\nthe same thickness should be used. Alternatively, to circumvent the problem of\nambiguous thickness completely, we also suggest that a \"sheet thermal\nconductance\" to be defined as an intensive 2D material property when\ncharacterizing the heat transfer capability of 2D materials. When converting\nliterature thermal conductivity values of monolayer materials to this new\nproperty, some new features that were not displayed when using different\nthicknesses show up.\n", "  We describe a method for the calculation of photoionization cross-sections\nusing square-integrable amplitudes obtained from the diagonalization of\nfinite-basis set representations of the electronic Hamiltonian. Three examples\nare considered: a model example in which the final state is a free particle,\nthe hydrogen atom and neutral atomic sodium. The method exploits the\nWhittaker-Shannon-Kotel'nikov sampling theorem, which is widely used in digital\nsignal sampling and reconstruction. The approach reproduces known data with\nvery good accuracy and converges to the exact solution with increase of the\nbasis set size.\n", "  We demonstrate a continuous-wave ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier which\nproduces 6.3 W at a wavelength of 972.5 nm. We frequency quadruple this source\nin two resonant doubling stages to produce 530 mW at 243.1 nm. Radiation at\nthis wavelength is required to excite the 1S-2S transition in atomic hydrogen\nand could therefore find application in experimental studies of hydrogen and\nanti-hydrogen.\n", "  The motivation of the present work is to reconstruct a dark energy model\nthrough the {\\it dimensionless dark energy function} $X(z)$, which is the dark\nenergy density in units of its present value. In this paper, we have shown that\na scalar field $\\phi$ having a phenomenologically chosen $X(z)$ can give rise\nto a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase of expansion for the\nuniverse. We have examined the possibility of constraining various cosmological\nparameters (such as the deceleration parameter and the effective equation of\nstate parameter) by comparing our theoretical model with the latest Type Ia\nSupernova (SN Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) radiation observations. Using the joint analysis of the SN\nIa+BAO/CMB dataset, we have also reconstructed the scalar potential from the\nparametrized $X(z)$. The relevant potential is found, which comes to be a\npolynomial in $\\phi$. From our analysis, it has been found that the present\nmodel favors the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model within $1\\sigma$ confidence level.\n", "  We present new (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations of the binary neutron\nstar (BNS) merger and postmerger phase. We focus on a previously inaccessible\nregion of the binary parameter space spanning the binary's mass-ratio\n$q\\sim1.00-1.75$ for different total masses and equations of state, and up to\n$q\\sim2$ for a stiff BNS system. We study the mass-ratio effect on the\ngravitational waves (GWs) and on the possible electromagnetic emission\nassociated to dynamical mass ejecta. We compute waveforms, spectra, and\nspectrograms of the GW strain including all the multipoles up to $l=4$. The\nmass-ratio has a specific imprint on the GW multipoles in the\nlate-inspiral-merger signal, and it affects qualitatively the spectra of the\nmerger remnant. The multipole effect is also studied by considering the\ndependency of the GW spectrograms on the source's sky location. Unequal mass\nBNSs produce more ejecta than equal mass systems with ejecta masses and kinetic\nenergies depending almost linearly on $q$. We estimate luminosity peaks and\nlight curves of macronovae events associated to the mergers using a simple\napproach. For $q\\sim2$ the luminosity peak is delayed for several days and can\nbe up to four times larger than for the $q=1$ cases. The macronova emission\nassociated with the $q\\sim2$ BNS is more persistent in time and could be\nobserved for weeks instead of few days ($q=1$) in the near infrared. Finally,\nwe estimate the flux of possible radio flares produced by the interaction of\nrelativistic outflows with the surrounding medium. Also in this case a large\n$q$ can significantly enhance the emission and delay the peak luminosity.\nOverall, our results indicate that BNS merger with large mass ratio have EM\nsignatures distinct from the equal mass case and more similar to black hole -\nneutron star binaries.\n", "  The dynamical commutators of the light-front Poincar\\'e algebra yield first\norder differential equations in the $p^+$ momenta for the interaction vertex\noperators. The homogeneous solution to the equation for the quartic vertex is\nstudied. Consequences as regards the constructibility assumption of quartic\nhigher spin amplitudes from cubic amplitudes are discussed. The existence of\nquartic contact interactions unrelated to cubic interactions by Poincar\\'e\nsymmetry indicates that the higher spin S-matrix is not constructible. Thus\nquartic amplitude based no-go results derived by BCFW recursion for Minkowski\nhigher spin massless fields may be circumvented.\n", "  Intensity minima and maxima of speckle patterns obtained behind a diffuser\nare experimentally interchanged by applying a spiral phase delay of charge $\\pm\n1$ to the impinging coherent beam. This transform arises from the intuitive\nexpectation that a tightly focused beam is so-changed into a vortex beam and\nvice-versa. The statistics of extrema locations and the intensity distribution\nof the so-generated \"complementary\" patterns are characterized by numerical\nsimulations. It is demonstrated experimentally that the incoherent\nsuperposition of the three \"complementary speckle patterns\" yield a synthetic\nspeckle grain size enlarged by a factor $\\sqrt{3}$. A cyclic permutation of\noptical vortices and maxima is unexpectedly observed and discussed.\n", "  Delta(54) can serve as a flavor symmetry in particle physics, but remains\nalmost unexplored. We show that in a classification of semi-realistic Z3xZ3\nheterotic string orbifolds, Delta(54) turns out to be the most natural flavor\nsymmetry, providing additional motivation for its study. We revisit its\nphenomenological potential from a low-energy perspective and subject to the\nconstraints of string models. We find a model with Delta(54) arising from\nheterotic orbifolds that leads to the Gatto-Sartori-Tonin relation for quarks\nand charged-leptons. Additionally, in the neutrino sector, it leads to a normal\nhierarchy for neutrino masses and a correlation between the reactor and the\natmospheric mixing angles, the latter taking values in the second octant and\nbeing compatible at three sigmas with experimental data.\n", "  We study the weak decays of $\\bar{B}_{(s)}$ and $B_c$ into $D$-wave\nheavy-light mesons, including $J^P=2^-$ ($D_{(s)2},D'_{(s)2},B_{(s)2},\nB'_{(s)2}$) and $3^-$~($D^*_{(s)3}, B^*_{(s)3}$) states. The weak decay\nhadronic matrix elements are achieved based on the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter\nmethod. The branching ratios for $\\bar{B}$ decays are $\\mathcal{B}[\\bar{B}\\to\nD_{2}e\\bar{\\nu}_e] = 1.1^{-0.3}_{+0.3} \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\mathcal{B}[\\bar{B}\\to\nD'_2e\\bar{\\nu}_e]=4.1^{-0.8}_{+0.9} \\times 10^{-4}$, and\n$\\mathcal{B}[\\bar{B}\\to D^*_3e\\bar{\\nu}_e]=1.0^{-0.2}_{+0.2} \\times 10^{-3}$,\nrespectively. For semi-electronic decays of $\\bar B_s$ to $D_{s2}$, $D'_{s2}$,\nand $D^*_{s3}$, the corresponding branching ratios are $1.7^{-0.5}_{+0.5}\\times\n10^{-3}$, $5.2^{-1.5}_{+1.6}\\times 10^{-4}$, and $1.5^{-0.4}_{+0.4}\\times\n10^{-3}$, respectively. The branching ratios of semi-electronic decays of $B_c$\nto $D$-wave $D$ mesons are in the order of $10^{-5}$. We also achieved the\nforward-backward asymmetry, angular spectra, and lepton momentum spectra. In\nparticular the distribution of decay widths for $2^-$ states $D_2$ and $D'_2$\nvarying along with mixing angle are presented.\n", "  The angular dynamics of a very small ellipsoidal particle in a viscous flow\ndecouples from its translational dynamics, and the particle angular velocity is\ngiven by Jeffery's theory. It is known that cuboid particles share these\nproperties. In the literature a special case is most frequently discussed,\nnamely that of axisymmetric particles with a continuous rotation symmetry. Here\nwe compute the angular dynamics of crystals that possess a discrete rotation\nsymmetry and certain mirror symmetries, but that do not have a continuous\nrotation symmetry. We give examples of such particles that nevertheless obey\nJeffery's theory. But there are other examples where the angular dynamics is\ndetermined by a more general equation of motion.\n", "  Optimal control of nanomagnets has become an urgent problem for the field of\nspintronics as technological tools approach thermodynamically determined limits\nof efficiency. In complex, fluctuating systems, like nanomagnetic bits, finding\noptimal protocols is challenging, requiring detailed information about the\ndynamical fluctuations of the controlled system. We provide a new, physically\ntransparent derivation of a metric tensor for which the length of a protocol is\nproportional to its dissipation. This perspective simplifies nonequilibrium\noptimization problems by recasting them in a geometric language. We then\ndescribe a numerical method, an instance of geometric minimum action methods,\nthat enables computation of geodesics even when the number of control\nparameters is large. We apply these methods to two models of nanomagnetic bits:\na simple Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert description of a single magnetic spin\ncontrolled by two orthogonal magnetic fields and a two dimensional Ising model\nin which the field is spatially controlled. These calculations reveal\nnontrivial protocols for bit erasure and reversal, providing important,\nexperimentally testable predictions for ultra-low power computing.\n", "  We derive analytical solutions for the autocorrelation and cross-correlation\nfunctions of the kinetic, potential and total energy of a Langevin oscillator.\nThese functions are presented in both the time and frequency domains and\nvalidated by independent numerical simulations. The results are applied to\naddress the long-standing issue of temperature fluctuations in canonical\nsystems.\n", "  We derive a sufficient set of conditions on the Euclidean boundary theory in\ndS/CFT for it to predict classical, Lorentzian bulk evolution at large spatial\nvolumes. Our derivation makes use of a canonical transformation to express the\nbulk wave function at large volume in terms of the sources of the dual\npartition function. This enables a sharper formulation of dS/CFT. The\nconditions under which the boundary theory predicts classical bulk evolution\nare stronger than the criteria usually employed in quantum cosmology. We\nillustrate this in a homogeneous isotropic minisuperspace model of gravity\ncoupled to a scalar field in which we identify the ensemble of classical\nhistories explicitly.\n", "  In the ultracold gases of alkali-earth (like) atoms, a new type of Feshbach\nresonance, i.e., the orbital Feshbach resonance (OFR), has been proposed and\nexperimentally observed in ultracold $^{173}$Yb atoms. When the OFR of the\n$^{173}$Yb atoms occurs, the energy gap between the open and closed channels is\nsmaller by two orders of magnitudes than the van der Waals energy. As a result,\nquantitative accurate results for the low-energy two-body problems can be\nobtained via multi-channel quantum defect theory (MQDT), which is based on the\nexact solution of the Schr$\\ddot{{\\rm o}}$dinger equation with the van der\nWaals potential. In this paper we use the MQDT to calculate the two-atom\nscattering length, effective range, and the binding energy of two-body bound\nstates for the systems with OFR. With these results we further study the\nclock-transition spectrum for the two-body bound states, which can be used to\nexperimentally measure the binding energy. Our results are helpful for the\nquantitative theoretical and experimental researches for the ultracold gases of\nalkali-earth (like) atoms with OFR.\n", "  Universality in the ion flux to the JET outer-wall is observed in outerwall\nlimiter mounted Langmuir probe (OLP) time-series across a large range of plasma\ncurrent and line-averaged density during Ohmically heated horizontal target\nL-mode plasmas. The mean, M, and the standard deviation, sigma, of the\nion-saturation current measured by the OLP show systematic variation with\nplasma current and density. Both increase as either plasma current decreases\nand/or density increases. Upon renormalization, achieved by subtraction of M\nand rescaling by sigma, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of each\nsignal collapse approximately onto a single curve. The shape of the curve\ndeviates from a distribution in the tail of the PDF and is better described by\na log-normal distribution. The collapse occurs over 4 decades of the ordinate\nwhich, given the wide parameter space over which the data spans, is a strong\nindication of universality.\n", "  We present state-of-the art predictions for the production of supersymmetric\nsquarks and gluinos at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), including soft-gluon\nresummation up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, the\nresummation of Coulomb corrections and the contribution from bound states. The\nNNLL corrections enhance the cross-section predictions and reduce the scale\nuncertainty to a level of 5-10%. The NNLL resummed cross-section predictions\ncan be obtained from the computer code NNLL-fast, which also provides the scale\nuncertainty and the pdf and alpha_s error.\n", "  We find a general formula for the operator mixing on the $\\mathbb{S}^4$ of\nchiral primary operators (CPO) for the ${\\cal N}=4$ theory at large $N$ in\nterms of Chebyshev polynomials. As an application, we compute the correlator of\na CPO and a Wilson loop, reproducing an earlier result by Giombi and Pestun\nobtained from a two-matrix model proposal. Finally, we discuss a simple method\nto obtain correlators in general ${\\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories in\nperturbation theory in terms of correlators of the ${\\cal N}=4$ theory.\n", "  The origin of the high-energy flux of neutrinos detected by IceCube is still\nunknown. Recent works report the evidence for a possible positional correlation\nbetween the reconstructed neutrino arrival directions and the positions in the\nsky of low power, high-energy emitting BL Lac objects (HBL). Assuming that\n$\\gamma$-ray emitting HBL form the bulk of the sources of high-energy neutrinos\nabove 100 TeV, we intend to calculate the number of events expected to be\ndetected for each source by IceCube and KM3NeT. Based on a simple\ntheoretically-motivated framework inspired by the structured jet scenario for\nthese sources, we postulate a direct proportionality between high-energy\n$\\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes. We calculate the expected neutrino event rate\nfor the HBL sources of the Second Fermi-LAT Catalog of High-Energy Sources\n(2FHL) for IceCube and the presently under construction KM3NeT using\ndeclination-dependent and exposure-weighted effective areas. We provide a list\nof 2FHL HBL with the calculated number of events. For IceCube, the derived\ncount rate for several sources is relatively high, of the order of $\\lesssim$1\nyr$^{-1}$, consistently with the recent findings of a possible positional\ncorrelation. For KM3NeT the calculated rates are higher, with several sources\nwith expected rate exceeding 1 yr$^{-1}$. This, coupled with the improved\nangular resolution, implies that the HBL origin can be effectively tested with\nfew years of observation of KM3NeT (and IceCube Gen2, for which similar\nperformances are foreseen) through the direct association of neutrinos and\nsingle HBL. Our results show that if -- as hinted by recent works -- HBL\nrepresent a possible population of high-energy neutrino emitters, several\nsingle sources should be identified in few years of exposure of KM3NeT,\nhighlighting the importance of the improved angular resolution anticipated for\nKM3NeT and IceCube Gen2.\n", "  The loss of ultracold trapped atoms due to deeply inelastic reactions has\npreviously been taken into account in effective field theories for low-energy\natoms by adding local anti-Hermitian terms to the effective Hamiltonian. Here\nwe show that when multi-atom systems are considered, an additional modification\nis required in the equation governing the density matrix. We define an\neffective density matrix by tracing over the states containing high-momentum\natoms produced by deeply inelastic reactions. We show that it satisfies a\nLindblad equation, with local Lindblad operators determined by the local\nanti-Hermitian terms in the effective Hamiltonian. We use the Lindblad equation\nto derive the universal relation for the two-atom inelastic loss rate for\nfermions with two spin states and the universal relation for the three-atom\ninelastic loss rate for identical bosons.\n", "  We complete the proof of unitarity of (compactified) heterotic and type II\nstring field theories by showing that in the cut diagrams only physical states\nappear in the sum over intermediate states. This analysis takes into account\nthe effect of mass and wave-function renormalization, and the possibility that\nthe true vacuum may be related to the perturbative vacuum by small shifts in\nthe string fields.\n", "  In this work we explore a correspondence between quantum circuits and\nlow-degree polynomials over the finite field F_2. Any quantum circuit made up\nof Hadamard, Z, controlled-Z and controlled-controlled-Z gates gives rise to a\ndegree-3 polynomial over F_2 such that calculating quantum circuit amplitudes\nis equivalent to counting zeroes of the corresponding polynomial. We exploit\nthis connection, which is especially clean and simple for this particular gate\nset, in two directions. First, we give proofs of classical hardness results\nbased on quantum circuit concepts. Second, we find efficient classical\nsimulation algorithms for certain classes of quantum circuits based on\nefficient algorithms for classes of polynomials.\n", "  Large Gauge Transformations (LGT) are gauge transformations that do not\nvanish at infinity. Instead, they asymptotically approach arbitrary functions\non the conformal sphere at infinity. Recently, it was argued that the LGT\nshould be treated as an infinite set of global symmetries which are\nspontaneously broken by the vacuum. It was established that in QED, the Ward\nidentities of their induced symmetries are equivalent to the Soft Photon\nTheorem. In this paper we study the implications of LGT on the S-matrix between\nphysical asymptotic states in massive QED. In appose to the naively free\nscattering states, physical asymptotic states incorporate the long range\nelectric field between asymptotic charged particles and were already\nconstructed in 1970 by Kulish and Faddeev. We find that the LGT charge is\nindependent of the particles' momenta and may be associated to the vacuum. The\nsoft theorem's manifestation as a Ward identity turns out to be an outcome of\nnot working with the physical asymptotic states.\n", "  We consider present constraints on Two Higgs Doublet Models, both from the\nLHC at Run 1 and from other sources in order to explore the possibility of\nconstraining a neutral scalar or pseudo-scalar particle lighter than the 125\nGeV Higgs boson. Such a lighter particle is not yet completely excluded by\npresent data. We show with a simplified analysis that some new constraints\ncould be obtained at the LHC if such a search is performed by the experimental\ncollaborations, which we therefore encourage to continue carrying out light\ndiphoton resonance searches at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV in the context of Two Higgs\nDoublet Models.\n", "  We calculate the rate of double open charm production in the forward\nkinematics studied recently in the LHCb experiment. We find that the mean field\napproximation for the double parton GPD (Generalized parton distributions),\nwhich neglects parton - parton correlations, underestimates the rate by a\nfactor of two. The enhancement due to the perturbative QCD correlation \\12\nmechanism which explains the rate of double parton interactions at the central\nrapidities is found to explain 60 $\\div$ 80 \\% of the discrepancy. We argue\nthat the nonperturbative fluctuations leading to non-factorized (correlated)\ncontributions to the initial conditions for the DGLAP collinear evolution of\nthe double parton GPD play an important role in this kinematics. Combined, the\ntwo correlation mechanisms provide a good description of the rate of double\ncharm production reported by the LHCb. We also give predictions for the\nvariation of the \\effs (i.e. the ratio of double and square of single inclusive\nrates) in the discussed kinematics as a function of $p_t$. The account for two\ncorrelation mechanisms strongly reduces sensitivity of the results to the\nstarting point of the QCD evolution.\n", "  Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be a conformal net. We give the notion of a proper action\nof a finite hypergroup acting by vacuum preserving unital completely positive\n(so-called stochastic) maps, which generalizes the proper actions of finite\ngroups. Taking fixed points under such an action gives a finite index subnet\n$\\mathcal{B}^K$ of $\\mathcal{B}$, which generalizes the $G$-orbifold.\nConversely, we show that if $\\mathcal{A}\\subset \\mathcal{B}$ is a finite\ninclusion of conformal nets, then $\\mathcal{A}$ is a generalized orbifold\n$\\mathcal{A}=\\mathcal{B}^K$ of the conformal net $\\mathcal{B}$ by a unique\nfinite hypergroup $K$. There is a Galois correspondence between intermediate\nnets $\\mathcal{B}^K\\subset \\mathcal{A} \\subset \\mathcal{B}$ and subhypergroups\n$L\\subset K$ given by $\\mathcal{A}=\\mathcal{B}^L$. In this case, the fixed\npoint of $\\mathcal{B}^K\\subset \\mathcal{A}$ is the generalized orbifold by the\nhypergroup of double cosets $L\\backslash K/ L$.\n  If $\\mathcal{A}\\subset \\mathcal{B}$ is an finite index inclusion of\ncompletely rational nets, we show that the inclusion $\\mathcal{A}(I)\\subset\n\\mathcal{B}(I)$ is conjugate to a Longo--Rehren inclusion. This implies that if\n$\\mathcal{B}$ is a holomorphic net, and $K$ acts properly on $\\mathcal{B}$,\nthen there is a unitary fusion category $\\mathcal{F}$ which is a\ncategorification of $K$ and $\\mathrm{Rep}(\\mathcal{B}^K)$ is braided equivalent\nto the Drinfel'd center $Z(\\mathcal{F})$. More generally, if $\\mathcal{B}$ is\ncompletely rational conformal net and $K$ acts properly on $\\mathcal{B}$, then\nthere is a unitary fusion category $\\mathcal{F}$ extending\n$\\mathrm{Rep}(\\mathcal{B})$, such that $K$ is given by the double cosets of the\nfusion ring of $\\mathcal{F}$ by the Verlinde fusion ring of $\\mathcal{B}$ and\n$\\mathrm{Rep}(\\mathcal{B}^K)$ is braided equivalent to the M\\\"uger centralizer\nof $\\mathrm{Rep}(\\mathcal{B})$ in $Z(\\mathcal{F})$.\n", "  The static dipole polarizability for the hydrogen molecular ions H$_2^+$,\nHD$^+$, and D$_2^+$ are calculated. These new data for polarizability takes\ninto account the leading order relativistic corrections to the wave function of\nthe three-body system resulted from the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian of $m\\alpha^4$\norder. Our study covers a wide range of rotational ($L=0-5$) and vibrational\n($v=0-10$) states, which are of practical interest for precision spectroscopy\nof the hydrogen molecular ions.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials may have potential applications in\nthermoelectric devices. In this work, we systematically investigate the\nthermoelectric properties of orthorhombic group IV-VI monolayers $\\mathrm{AB}$\n(A=Ge and Sn; B=S and Se) by the first-principles calculations and\nsemiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is\nincluded to investigate their electronic transport, which produces observable\neffects on power factor, especially for n-type doping. According to calculated\n$ZT$, the four monolayers exhibit diverse anisotropic thermoelectric\nproperties, although they have similar hinge-like crystal structure. The GeS\nalong zigzag and armchair directions shows the strongest anisotropy, while SnS\nand SnSe show mostly isotropic efficiency of thermoelectric conversion, which\ncan be understood by the strength of anisotropy of their respective power\nfactor, electronic and lattice thermal conductivities. Calculated results show\nthat $ZT$ for different carriers of n- and p-type has little difference for\nGeS, SnS and SnSe. It is found that GeSe, SnS and SnSe show better\nthermoelectric performance compared to GeS in n-type doping, and SnS and SnSe\nexhibit higher efficiency of thermoelectric conversion in p-type doping.\nCompared to a lot of 2D materials, orthorhombic group IV-VI monolayers\n$\\mathrm{AB}$ (A=Ge and Sn; B=S and Se) may possess better thermoelectric\nperformance due to higher power factor and lower thermal conductivity. Our work\nwould be beneficial to further experimental study.\n", "  We revisit AdS/CFT at finite radial cut-off, specifically in the context of\ndouble trace perturbations, $\\mathbb{O}_n$= $\\mathbb{O}(x) (\\partial^2)^{n}\n{\\mathcal O}(x)$, with arbitrary $n$. As well-known, the standard GKPW\nprescription, applied to a finite radial cut-off, leads to contact terms in\ncorrelators. de Haro et al (arXiv:hep-th/0002230) introduced bulk counterterms\nto remove these. However, this prescription yields additional terms in the\ncorrelator corresponding to spurious double trace deformations. Further, if we\nview GKPW prescription coupled with the prescription in arXiv:hep-th/0002230,\nin terms of a boundary wavefunction, we find that it is incompatible with\nradial Schrodinger evolution (in the spirit of holographic Wilsonian RG). We\nconsider a more general wavefunction satisfying the Schrodinger equation, and\nfind that generically such wavefunctions generate both (a) double trace\ndeformations and (b) contact terms. However, we find that there exist special\nchoices of these wavefunctions, amounting to a new AdS/CFT prescription at a\nfinite cut-off, so that both (a) and (b) are removed and we obtain a pure power\nlaw behaviour for the correlator. We compare these special wavefunctions with a\nspecific RG scheme in field theory. We give a geometric interpretation of these\nwavefunctions; these correspond to some specific smearing of boundary points in\nthe Witten diagrams. We present a comprehensive calculation of exact\ndouble-trace beta-functions for all couplings $\\mathbb{O}_n$ and match with a\nholographic computation using the method described above. The matching works\nwith a mapping between the field theory and bulk couplings; such a map is\nhighly constrained because the beta-functions are quadratic and exact on both\nsides. We generalize standard double-trace Wilson-Fisher flow to the space of\nthe infinite number of couplings.\n", "  Warped higher-dimensional compactifications with \"bulk\" standard model, or\ntheir AdS/CFT dual as the purely 4D scenario of Higgs compositeness and partial\ncompositeness, offer an elegant approach to resolving the electroweak hierarchy\nproblem as well as the origins of flavor structure. However, low-energy\nelectroweak/flavor/CP constraints and the absence of non-standard physics at\nLHC Run 1 suggest that a \"little hierarchy problem\" remains, and that the new\nphysics underlying naturalness may lie out of LHC reach. Assuming this to be\nthe case, we show that there is a simple and natural extension of the minimal\nwarped model in the Randall-Sundrum framework, in which matter, gauge and\ngravitational fields propagate modestly different degrees into the IR of the\nwarped dimension, resulting in rich and striking consequences for the LHC (and\nbeyond). The LHC-accessible part of the new physics is AdS/CFT dual to the\nmechanism of \"vectorlike confinement\", with TeV-scale Kaluza-Klein excitations\nof the gauge and gravitational fields dual to spin-0,1,2 composites. Unlike the\nminimal warped model, these low-lying excitations have predominantly\nflavor-blind and flavor/CP-safe interactions with the standard model.\nRemarkably, this scenario also predicts small deviations from flavor-blindness\noriginating from virtual effects of Higgs/top compositeness at $\\sim O(10)$\nTeV, with subdominant resonance decays into Higgs/top-rich final states, giving\nthe LHC an early \"preview\" of the nature of the resolution of the hierarchy\nproblem. Discoveries of this type at LHC Run 2 would thereby anticipate (and\nset a target for) even more explicit explorations of Higgs compositeness at a\n100 TeV collider, or for next-generation flavor tests.\n", "  We present strong evidence that the sub-subleading soft theorem in\nsemi-classical (tree level) gravity discovered by Cachazo and Strominger is\nequivalent to the conservation of asymptotic charges associated to a new class\nof vector fields not contained within the previous extensions of BMS algebra.\nOur analysis crucially relies on analyzing the hitherto established\nequivalences between soft theorems and Ward identities from a new perspective.\nIn this process we naturally (re)discover a class of `magnetic' charges at null\ninfinity that are associated to the dual of the Weyl tensor.\n", "  We present an analysis of the properties of the electron velocity\ndistribution during island coalescence in asymmetric reconnection with and\nwithout guide field. In a previous study, three main domains were identified,\nin the case without guide field, as X-, D- and M-regions featuring different\nreconnection evolutions {Cazzola et al. 2015). These regions are also\nidentified here in the case with guide field. We study the departure from\nisotropic and gyrotropic behavior by means of different robust detection\nalgorithms proposed in the literature. While in the case without guide field\nthese metrics show an overall agreement, when the guide field is present a\ndiscrepancy in the agyrotropy within some relevant regions is observed, such as\nat the separatrices and inside magnetic islands. Moreover, in light of the new\nobservations from the Multiscale MagnetoSpheric mission, an analysis of the\nelectron velocity phase-space in these domains is presented.\n", "  Aptamers are chemically produced oligonucleotides, able to bind a variety of\ntargets such as drugs, proteins and pathogens with high sensitivity and\nselectivity. Therefore, aptamers are largely employed for producing label-free\nbiosensors, with significant applications in diagnostics and drug delivery. In\nparticular, the anti-thrombin aptamers are biomolecules of high interest for\nclinical use, because of their ability to recognize and bind the thrombin\nenzyme. Among them, the DNA 15-mer thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA), has been\nwidely explored concerning both its structure, which was resolved with\ndifferent techniques, and its function, especially about the possibility of\nusing it as the active part of biosensors. This paper proposes a microscopic\nmodel of the electrical properties of TBA and the aptamer-thrombin complex,\ncombining information from both structure and function. The novelty consists in\ndescribing both the aptamer alone and the complex as an impedance network, thus\ngoing deeper inside the issues addressed in an emerging electronics branch\nknown as proteotronics. The theoretical results are compared and validated with\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements reported in the literature.\nFinally, the model suggests resistance measurements as a novel tool for testing\naptamer-target affinity.\n", "  We confirm the leading $\\alpha'^3$ correction to the 4d, $\\mathcal N = 1$\nK\\\"{a}hler potential of type IIB orientifold compactifications, proportional to\nthe Euler characteristic of the Calabi-Yau threefold (BBHL correction). We\npresent the explicit solution for the $\\alpha'^3$-modified internal background\nmetric in terms of the non-harmonic part of the third Chern form of the leading\norder Calabi-Yau manifold. The corrected internal manifold is almost Calabi-Yau\nand admits an $SU(3)$ structure with non-vanishing torsion. We also find that\nthe full ten-dimensional Einstein frame background metric is multiplied by a\nnon-trivial Weyl factor. Performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction on the modified\nbackground we derive the $\\alpha'^3$-corrected kinetic terms for the dilaton\nand the K\\\"{a}hler deformations of the internal Calabi-Yau threefold for\narbitrary $h^{1,1}$. We analyze these kinetic terms in the 4d, $\\mathcal N = 2$\nun-orientifolded theory, confirming the expected correction to the K\\\"ahler\nmoduli space prepotential, as well as in the 4d, $\\mathcal N = 1$ orientifolded\ntheory, thus determining the corrections to the K\\\"ahler potential and K\\\"ahler\ncoordinates.\n", "  Recently in (Eur. Phys. J. C 76:341, 2016) [arXiv:1604.08706], Myung has\nsuggested that the renormalizability of massive conformal gravity is\nmeaningless unless the massive ghost states of the theory are stable. Here we\nshow that massive conformal gravity can be renormalizable having unstable ghost\nstates.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the long-time dynamics of the nonlinear wave\nequation in one-space dimension, $$ u_{tt} - \\delta^2 u_{xx} +V'(u) =0 \\qquad\nx\\in [0,1] $$ where $\\delta>0$ is a parameter and $V(u)$ is a potential bounded\nfrom below and growing at least like $u^2$ as $|u|\\to\\infty$. Infinite energy\nsolutions of this equation preserve a natural Gibbsian invariant measure and\nwhen the potential is double-welled, for example when $V(u) =\n\\tfrac14(1-u^2)^2$, there is a regime such that two small disjoint sets in the\nsystem's phase-space concentrate most of the mass of this measure. This\nsuggests that the solutions to the nonlinear wave equation can be metastable\nover these sets, in the sense that they spend long periods of time in these\nsets and only rarely transition between them. Here we quantify this phenomenon\nby calculating exactly via Transition State Theory (TST) the mean frequency at\nwhich the solutions of the nonlinear wave equation with initial conditions\ndrawn from its invariant measure cross a dividing surface lying in between the\nmetastable sets. Numerical results suggest that the dynamics of the nonlinear\nwave equation is ergodic and rapidly mixing with respect to the Gibbs invariant\nmeasure when the parameter $\\delta$ in small enough. This is a regime in which\nthe dynamics of the nonlinear wave equation displays a metastable behavior that\nis not fundamentally different from that observed in its stochastic counterpart\nin which random noise and damping terms are added to the equation. For larger\n$\\delta$, however, the dynamics either stops being ergodic, or its mixing time\nbecomes larger than the inverse of the TST frequency, indicating that\nsuccessive transitions between the metastable sets are correlated and the\ncoarse-graining to a Markov chain fails.\n", "  An experimental test of quantum complementarity principle based on single\nneutral atom trapped in a blue detuned bottle trap was here performed. A Ramsey\ninterferometer was used to assess the wavelike behavior or particle-like\nbehavior with second $\\pi/2$-rotation on or off. The wavelike behavior or\nparticle-like behavior is characterized by the visibility $V$ of the\ninterference or the predictability $P$ of which-path information, respectively.\nThe measured results fulfill the complementarity relation $P^2+V^2\\leq1$.\nImbalance losses were deliberately introduced to the stem and find the\ncomplementarity relation is then formally \"violated.\" All the experimental\nresults can be completely explained theoretically by quantum mechanics without\nconsidering the interference between wave and particle behaviors. This\nobservation complements existing information concerning the BCP based on\nwave-particle duality of massive quantum.\n", "  A search is made for the highly-suppressed B meson decays $B^{+}\\rightarrow\nK^{+}K^{+}\\pi^{-}$ and $B^{+}\\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}K^{-}$ using a data\nsample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 $fb^{-1}$ collected by\nthe LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7\nand 8 TeV. No evidence is found for the decays, and upper limits at 90\\%\nconfidence level are determined to be $\\mathcal{B}(B^{+}\\rightarrow\nK^{+}K^{+}\\pi^{-}) < 1.1\\times 10^{-8}$ and $\\mathcal{B}(B^{+}\\rightarrow\n\\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}K^{-}) < 4.6\\times 10^{-8}$.\n", "  We present results from a state-of-the-art fit of electroweak precision\nobservables and Higgs-boson signal-strength measurements performed using 7 and\n8 TeV data from the Large Hadron Collider. Based on the HEPfit package, our\nstudy updates the traditional fit of electroweak precision observables and\nextends it to include Higgs-boson measurements. As a result we obtain\nconstraints on new physics corrections to both electroweak observables and\nHiggs-boson couplings. We present the projected accuracy of the fit taking into\naccount the expected sensitivities at future colliders.\n", "  This letter is meant to be a brief survey of several recent publications\nproviding a simple, sequential explanation of Dark Energy, Inflation and Dark\nMatter, which leads to a simple picture of the why and the how of the Big Bang,\nand thence to a possible understanding of the birth and death of a Universe.\n", "  A general scheme is proposed and tested to control the symmetry breaking\ninstability of a homogeneous solution of a spatially extended multispecies\nmodel, defined on a network. The inherent discreteness of the space makes it\npossible to act on the topology of the inter-nodes contacts to achieve the\ndesired degree of stabilization, without altering the dynamical parameters of\nthe model. Both symmetric and asymmetric couplings are considered. In this\nlatter setting the web of contacts is assumed to be balanced, for the\nhomogeneous equilibrium to exist. The performance of the proposed method are\nassessed, assuming the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as a reference model.\nIn this case, the implemented control allows one to stabilize the synchronous\nlimit cycle, hence time-dependent, uniform solution. A system of coupled real\nGinzburg-Landau equations is also investigated to obtain the topological\nstabilization of a homogeneous and constant fixed point.\n", "  We investigate the future evolution of the universe using the Buchert\nframework for averaged backreaction in the context of a two-domain partition of\nthe universe. We show that this approach allows for the possibility of the\nglobal acceleration vanishing at a finite future time, provided that none of\nthe subdomains accelerate individually. The model at large scales is\nanalogously described in terms of a homogeneous scalar field emerging with a\npotential that is fixed and free from phenomenological parametrization. The\ndynamics of this scalar field is explored in the analogous FLRW cosmology.\n  We use observational data from Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the parameters of\nthe model for a viable cosmology, providing the corresponding likelihood\ncontours.\n", "  The radial excitation of the global symmetry-breaking vacuum in composite\nHiggs models, called the \"global Higgs\", has been recently a focus of\ninvestigation. In this paper we study the prospects for detecting this\ncomposite scalar at the 13 TeV LHC. We compute the global Higgs production\nrates and estimate the discovery potential of a global Higgs decaying into top\nquark pairs and into Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons with subsequent\nhadronic decays. The global Higgs may also decay into fermion resonances such\nas top partners, providing a new window into compositeness. We show that top\npartner jets can be effectively unresolved in some regions of the parameter\nspace. Such \"boosted top partner\" signatures would deserve the development of\ndedicated substructure analyses.\n", "  We found the pre-potential in the superspace with $AdS_{5}\\,\\times\\,S^{5}$\nbackground. The pre-potential appears as part of the vielbeins, without\nderivatives. The space-cone gauge destroys the bulk Lorentz covariance, but\nstill preserves boundary Lorentz covariance (projective superspace)\n$SO\\,(\\,3,\\,1\\,)\\,\\otimes\\,SO\\,(\\,4\\,)$, i.e. symmetries of boundary CFT are\nmanifest.\n", "  Using one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems as prototypes of quantum many-body\nsystems, we study the emergence of quantum chaos. The main purpose of this work\nis to answer the following question: how does the spin-orbit interaction, as a\npure quantum interaction, may lead to the onset of quantum chaos? We consider\nthree integrable spin-1/2 systems: the Ising, the XX, and the XXZ limits, and\nanalyze whether quantum chaos develops or not after the addition of the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find that, depending on the strength of\nthe anisotropy parameter, the answer is positive for the XXZ and Ising models,\nwhile no such evidence is observed for the XX model. We also discuss the\nrelationship between quantum chaos and thermalization.\n", "  We consider an alternating Heisenberg spin-$1/2$\nantiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic ($AF-F$) chain with the space modulated\ndominant antiferromagnetic exchange and anisotropic ferromagnetic coupling\n(tetrameric spin-$1/2$ chain). The zero-temperature effect of a symmetry\nbreaking transverse magnetic field on the model is studied numerically. It is\nfound that the anisotropy effect on the ferromagnetic coupling induces two new\ngapped phases. We identified their orderings as a kind of the\nstripe-antiferromagnetic phase. As a result, the magnetic phase diagram of the\ntetrameric chain shows five gapped quantum phases and the system is\ncharacterized by four critical fields which mark quantum phase transitions in\nthe ground state of the system with the changing transverse magnetic field. We\nhave also exploited the well known bipartite entanglement (name as concurrence)\nand global entanglement tools to verify the occurrence of quantum phase\ntransitions and the corresponding critical points.\n", "  Research in semiconductor physics has advanced to the study of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials where the surface controls electronic transport.\nA scanning probe microscope (SPM) is an ideal tool to image electronic motion\nin these devices by using the SPM tip as a scanning gate. In prior work for a\ntwo dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, a number\nof phenomena were imaged, including electron flow from a quantum point contact,\nand tuning of a few electron quantum dot. This approach was also used to study\nInAs quantum dots grown in a InAs/InP nanowire heterostructure. New\ntwo-dimensional materials such as graphene show great promise for fundamental\nresearch and applications. We have extended or prior work to image the motion\nof electrons along cyclotron orbits in single atomic layer graphene passing\nfrom one point contact to a second point contact on the first magnetic focusing\npeak in graphene. The charged SPM tip defects electrons passing from one\ncontact to the other, changing the conductance. A plot of the change in\nconductance vs. tip position presents an image of electron flow. A low\ntemperature Scanning Capacitance Microscope (SCM) with a sensitive charge\npreamplifier located near the SPM tip achieves a charge noise level 0.13\ne/Hz1/2 with high spatial resolution 100 nm, which promises to be useful to\nstudy electronic behavior in nanoscale devices.\n", "  The model of landscape erosion, introduced in [{\\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\\bf\n80}: 4349 (1998); {\\it J. Stat. Phys.} {\\bf 93}: 477 (1998)] and modified in\n[{\\it Theor. Math. Phys.} - in press; arXiv:1602.00432], is advected by\nanisotropic velocity field. The field is Gaussian with vanishing correlation\ntime and the pair correlation function of the form $\\propto \\delta(t-t') /\nk_{\\bot}^{d-1+\\xi}$, where $k_{\\bot}=|{\\bf k}_{\\bot}|$ and ${\\bf k}_{\\bot}$ is\nthe component of the wave vector, perpendicular to a certain preferred\ndirection -- the $d$-dimensional generalization of the ensemble introduced by\nAvellaneda and Majda [{\\it Commun. Math. Phys.} {\\bf 131}: 381 (1990)].\nAnalogous to the case without advection, the model is multiplicatively\nrenormalizable and has infinitely many coupling constants. The one-loop\ncounterterm is derived in a closed form in terms of the certain function\n$V(h)$, entering the original stochastic equation, and its derivatives with\nrespect to the height field $h(t,{\\bf x})$. The full infinite set of the\none-loop renormalization constants, $\\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions\nis obtained from the Taylor expansion of the counter-term. Instead of a\ntwo-dimensional surface of fixed points there is two such surfaces; they are\nlikely to contain infrared attractive region(s). If that is the case, the model\nexhibits scaling behaviour in the infrared range. The corresponding critical\nexponents are nonuniversal because they depend on the coordinates of the fixed\npoints on the surface; they also satisfy certain universal exact relation.\n", "  We present rigorous results for the mean first passage time and first passage\ntime statistics for two-channel Markov additive diffusion in a 3-dimensional\nspherical domain. Inspired by biophysical examples we assume that the particle\ncan only recognise the target in one of the modes, which is shown to effect a\nnon-trivial first passage behaviour. We also address the scenario of\nintermittent immobilisation. In both cases we prove that despite the perfectly\nnon-recurrent motion of two-channel Markov additive diffusion in 3 dimensions\nthe first passage statistics at long times do not display Poisson-like\nbehaviour if none of the phases has a vanishing diffusion coefficient. This\nstands in stark contrast to the standard (one-channel) Markov diffusion\ncounterpart. We also discuss the relevance of our results in the context of\ncellular signalling.\n", "  Optical microtraps provide a strong spatial confinement for laser-cooled\natoms. They can, e.g., be realized with strongly focused trapping light beams\nor the optical near fields of nano-scale waveguides and photonic\nnanostructures. Atoms in such traps often experience strongly spatially varying\nAC Stark shifts which are proportional to the magnetic quantum number of the\nrespective energy level. These inhomogeneous fictitious magnetic fields can\ncause a displacement of the trapping potential that depends on the Zeeman\nstate. Hitherto, this effect was mainly perceived as detrimental. However, it\nalso provides a means to probe and to manipulate the motional state of the\natoms in the trap by driving transitions between Zeeman states. Furthermore, by\napplying additional real or fictitious magnetic fields, the state-dependence of\nthe trapping potential can be controlled. Here, using laser-cooled atoms that\nare confined in a nanofiber-based optical dipole trap, we employ this control\nin order to tune the microwave coupling of motional quantum states. We record\ncorresponding microwave spectra which allow us to infer the trap parameters as\nwell as the temperature of the atoms. Finally, we reduce the mean number of\nmotional quanta in one spatial dimension to $\\langle n\\rangle=0.3 \\pm 0.1$ by\nmicrowave sideband cooling. Our work shows that the inherent fictitious\nmagnetic fields in optical microtraps expand the experimental toolbox for\ninterrogating and manipulating cold atoms.\n", "  The formation of protoplanetary discs during the collapse of molecular dense\ncores is significantly influenced by angular momentum transport, notably by the\nmagnetic torque. In turn, the evolution of the magnetic field is determined by\ndynamical processes and non-ideal MHD effects such as ambipolar diffusion.\nConsidering simple relations between various timescales characteristic of the\nmagnetized collapse, we derive an expression for the early disc radius, $ r\n\\simeq 18 \\, {\\rm AU} \\, \\left({\\eta_{\\rm AD} / 0.1 \\, {\\rm s}} \\right)^{2/9}\n\\left({B_z / 0.1\\, {\\rm G}} \\right) ^{-4/9} \\left({M / 0.1 \\msol} \\right)\n^{1/3},$ where $M$ is the total disc plus protostar mass, $\\eta_\\mathrm{AD}$ is\nthe ambipolar diffusion coefficient and $B_z$ is the magnetic field in the\ninner part of the core. This is about significantly smaller than the discs that\nwould form if angular momentum was conserved.\n  The analytical predictions are confronted against a large sample of 3D,\nnon-ideal MHD collapse calculations covering variations of a factor 100 in core\nmass, a factor 10 in the level of turbulence, a factor 5 in rotation, and\nmagnetic mass-to-flux over critical mass-to-flux ratios 2 and 5. The disc\nradius estimates are found to agree with the numerical simulations within less\nthan a factor 2.\n  A striking prediction of our analysis is the weak dependence of circumstellar\ndisc radii upon the various relevant quantities, suggesting weak variations\namong class-0 disc sizes. In some cases, we note the onset of large spiral arms\nbeyond this radius.\n", "  There has been rapidly growing interest in the past decade in a new gauge\nboson which is considerably lighter than the standard model Z boson. A\nwell-known example of this kind is the so-called dark photon, and it is\nactively searched for in various experiments nowadays. It would be puzzling to\nhave a new gauge boson which is neither massless nor electroweak scale, but\npossesses a rather small yet nonzero mass. We present a mechanism that can\nprovide a light gauge boson as a result of a mass matrix diagonalization.\n", "  A $^{6}$Li glass based scintillation detector developed for the TRIUMF\nneutron electric dipole moment experiment was characterized using the\nultra-cold neutron source at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The data\nacquisition system for this detector was demonstrated to perform well at\nrejecting backgrounds. An estimate of the absolute efficiency of background\nrejection of $99.7\\pm0.1$% is made. For variable ultra-cold neutron rate\n(varying from $<$1 kHz to approx. 100 kHz per channel) and background rate seen\nat the Paul Scherrer Institute, we estimate that the absolute detector\nefficiency is $89.7^{+1.3}_{-1.9}$%. Finally a comparison with a commercial\nCascade detector was performed for a specific setup at the West-2 beamline of\nthe ultra-cold neutron source at PSI.\n", "  We use recently developed method of accurate atomic calculations which\ncombines linearized single-double coupled cluster method with the configuration\ninteraction technique to calculate ionisation potentials, excitation energies,\nstatic polarizabilities and valence electron densities for superheavy elements\nUut, Fl and Uup ($Z$=113 to 115) and their ions. The accuracy of the\ncalculations is controlled by comparing similar calculations for lighter\nanalogs of the superheavy elements, Tl, Pb and Bi with experiment. The role of\nrelativistic effects and correlations is discussed and comparison with earlier\ncalculations is presented.\n", "  Gauge-invariant operators can be specified by equivalence classes of\npermutations. We develop this idea concretely for the singlets of the flavour\ngroup $SO(N_f)$ in $U(N_c)$ gauge theory by using Gelfand pairs and Schur-Weyl\nduality. The singlet operators, when specialised at $N_f =6$, belong to the\nscalar sector of ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM. A simple formula is given for the two-point\nfunctions in the free field limit of $g_{YM}^2 =0$. The free two-point\nfunctions are shown to be equal to the partition function on a 2-complex with\nboundaries and a defect, in a topological field theory of permutations. The\npermutation equivalence classes are Fourier transformed to a representation\nbasis which is orthogonal for the two-point functions at finite $N_c , N_f$.\nCounting formulae for the gauge-invariant operators are described. The one-loop\nmixing matrix is derived as a linear operator on the permutation equivalence\nclasses.\n", "  We consider the Noetherian symmetries of second-order ODEs subjected to\nforces with nonzero curl. Both position and velocity dependent forces are\nconsidered. In the former case the first integrals are shown to follow from the\nsymmetries of the celebrated Emden-Fowler equation.\n", "  Can the cosmological dynamics responsible for settling down the present\nvalues of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix be related to electroweak\nsymmetry breaking? If the Standard Model Yukawa couplings varied in the early\nuniverse and started with order one values before electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the CP violation associated with the CKM matrix could be the origin\nof the matter-antimatter asymmetry. The large effective Yukawa couplings which\nlead to the enhanced CP violation can also help in achieving a strong\nfirst-order electroweak phase transition. We study in detail the feasibility of\nthis idea by implementing dynamical Yukawa couplings in the context of the\nFroggatt--Nielsen mechanism. We discuss two main realizations of such a\nmechanism, related phenomenology, cosmological and collider bounds, and provide\nan estimate of the baryonic yield. A generic prediction is that this scenario\nalways features a new scalar field below the electroweak scale. We point out\nways to get around this conclusion.\n", "  One implication of Bell's theorem is that there cannot in general be hidden\nvariable models for quantum mechanics that both are noncontextual and retain\nthe structure of a classical probability space. Thus, some hidden variable\nprograms aim to retain noncontextuality at the cost of using a generalization\nof the Kolmogorov probability axioms. We generalize a theorem of Feintzeig\n(2015) to show that such programs are committed to the existence of a finite\nnull cover for some quantum mechanical experiments, i.e., a finite collection\nof probability zero events whose disjunction exhausts the space of experimental\npossibilities.\n", "  This paper reviews the physics of quantum disorder in relation with a series\nof experiments using laser-cooled atoms exposed to \"kicks\" of a standing wave,\nrealizing a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos, the kicked rotor. This\ndynamical system can be mapped onto a tight-binding Hamiltonian with\npseudo-disorder, formally equivalent to the Anderson model of quantum disorder,\nwith quantum chaos playing the role of disorder. This provides a very good\nquantum simulator for the Anderson physics.\n", "  The e-ASTROGAM is a gamma-ray space mission to be proposed as the M5\nMedium-size mission of the European Space Agency. It is dedicated to the\nobservation of the Universe with unprecedented sensitivity in the energy range\n0.2 - 100 MeV, extending up to GeV energies, together with a groundbreaking\npolarization capability. It is designed to substantially improve the COMPTEL\nand Fermi sensitivities in the MeV-GeV energy range and to open new windows of\nopportunity for astrophysical and fundamental physics space research.\ne-ASTROGAM will operate as an open astronomical observatory, with a core\nscience focused on (1) the activity from extreme particle accelerators,\nincluding gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei and the link of jet\nastrophysics to the new astronomy of gravitational waves, neutrinos, ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays, (2) the high-energy mysteries of the Galactic center and\ninner Galaxy, including the activity of the supermassive black hole, the Fermi\nBubbles, the origin of the Galactic positrons, and the search for dark matter\nsignatures in a new energy window; (3) nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution,\nincluding the life cycle of elements produced by supernovae in the Milky Way\nand the Local Group of galaxies. e-ASTROGAM will be ideal for the study of\nhigh-energy sources in general, including pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae,\naccreting neutron stars and black holes, novae, supernova remnants, and\nmagnetars. And it will also provide important contributions to solar and\nterrestrial physics. The e-ASTROGAM telescope is optimized for the simultaneous\ndetection of Compton and pair-producing gamma-ray events over a large spectral\nband. It is based on a very high technology readiness level for all subsystems\nand includes many innovative features for the detectors and associated\nelectronics.\n", "  We discuss the resummation of the strong coupling asymptotic expansion of the\ndressing phase of the ${\\rm AdS}_5\\times {\\rm S}^5$ superstring. The dressing\nphase proposed by Beisert, Eden and Staudacher can be recovered from a modified\nBorel-Ecalle resummation of this asymptotic expansion only by completing it\nwith new, non-perturbative and exponentially suppressed terms that can be\norganized into different sectors labelled by an instanton-like number. We\ncompute the contribution to the dressing phase coming from the sum over all the\ninstanton sectors and show that it satisfies the homogeneous crossing symmetry\nequation. We comment on the semiclassical origin of the non-perturbative terms\nfrom the world-sheet theory point of view even though their precise explanation\nremains still quite mysterious.\n", "  We study bipartite post measurement entanglement entropy after selective\nmeasurements in quantum chains. We first study the quantity for the critical\nsystems that can be described by conformal field theories. We find a connection\nbetween post measurement entanglement entropy and the Casimir energy of\nfloating objects. Then we provide formulas for the post measurement\nentanglement entropy for open and finite temperature systems. We also comment\non the Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy in the context of the post measurement\nentanglement entropy. Finally, we also provide some formulas regarding modular\nhamiltonians and entanglement spectrum in the after measurement systems. After\nthrough discussion regarding CFT systems we also provide some predictions\nregarding massive field theories. We then discuss a generic method to calculate\nthe post measurement entanglement entropy in the free fermion systems. Using\nthe method we study the post measurement entanglement entropy in the XY spin\nchain. We check numerically the CFT and the massive field theory results in the\ntransverse field Ising chain and the XX model. In particular, we study the post\nmeaurement entanglement entropy in the infinite, periodic and open critical\ntransverse field Ising chain and the critical XX model. The effect of the\ntemperature and the gap is also discussed in these models.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments, we analyse the phonon-assisted steady-state\ngain of a microwave field driving a double quantum-dot in a resonator. We apply\nthe results of our companion paper, which derives the complete set of\nfourth-order Lindblad dissipators using Keldysh methods, to show that resonator\ngain and loss are substantially affected by dephasing-assisted dissipative\nprocesses in the quantum-dot system. These additional processes, which go\nbeyond recently proposed polaronic theories, are in good quantitative agreement\nwith experimental observations\n", "  The Van der Waals-like phase transition is observed in temperature-thermal\nentropy plane in spherically symmetric charged Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black hole\nbackground. In terms of AdS/CFT, the non-local observables such as holographic\nentanglement entropy, Wilson loop, and two point correlation function of very\nheavy operators in the field theory dual to spherically symmetric charged\nGauss-Bonnet-AdS black hole have been investigated. All of them exhibit the Van\nder Waals-like phase transition for a fixed charge parameter or Gauss-Bonnet\nparameter in such gravity background. Further, with choosing various values of\ncharge or Gauss-Bonnet parameter, the equal area law and the critical exponent\nof the heat capacity are found to be consistent with phase structures in\ntemperature-thermal entropy plane.\n", "  We discuss fitness landscapes and how they can be modified to account for\nco-evolution. We are interested in using the landscape as a way to model\nrational decision making in a toy economic system. We develop a model very\nsimilar to the Tangled Nature Model of Christensen et. al. that we call the\nTangled Decision Model. This is a natural setting for our discussion of\nco-evolutionary fitness landscapes. We use a Monte Carlo step to simulate\ndecision making and investigate two different decision making procedures.\n", "  Exploring the impact of dimensionality on the quantum dynamics of interacting\nbosons in traps including particle correlations is an interesting but\nchallenging task. Due to the different participating length scales the\nmodelling of the short-range interactions in three dimensions plays a special\nrole. We review different approaches for the latter and elaborate that for\nmulti-configurational computational strategies finite range potentials are\nadequate resulting in the need of large grids to resolve the relevant length\nscales. This results in computational challenges which include also the\nexponential scaling of complexity with the number of atoms. We show that the\nrecently developed ab-initio Multi-Layer Multi-Configurational Time- Dependent\nHartee method for Bosons (ML-MCTDHB) [J. Chem. Phys. 139, 134103 (2013)] can\nface both numerical challenges and present an efficient numerical\nimplementation of ML-MCTDHB in three spatial dimensions, particularly suited to\ndescribe the quantum dynamics for elongated traps.\n  The beneficial scaling of our approach is demonstrated by studying the\ntunnelling dynamics of bosonic ensembles in a double well. Comparing\nthree-dimensional with quasi-one dimensional simulations, we find\ndimensionality-induced effects in the density. Furthermore, we study the\ncrossover from weak transversal confinement, where a mean-field description of\nthe system is sufficient, towards tight transversal confinement, where particle\ncorrelations and beyond mean-field effects are pronounced.\n", "  Bosonization dualities relate two different Chern-Simons-matter theories,\nwith bosonic matter on one side replaced by fermionic matter on the other. We\nfirst describe a more general class of non-Abelian bosonization dualities. We\nthen explore the non-relativistic physics of these theories in the quantum Hall\nregime. The bosonic theory lies in a condensed phase and admits vortices which\nare known to form a non-Abelian quantum Hall state. We ask how this same\nphysics arises in the fermionic theory. We find that a condensed boson\ncorresponds to a fully filled Landau level of fermions, while bosonic vortices\nmap to fermionic holes. We confirm that the ground state of the two theories is\nindeed described by the same quantum Hall wavefunction.\n", "  We show at NNLO that the soft factors for double parton scattering (DPS) for\nboth integrated and unintegrated kinematics, can be presented entirely in the\nterms of the soft factor for single Drell-Yan process, i.e. the transverse\nmomentum dependent (TMD) soft factor. Using the linearity of the logarithm of\nTMD soft factor in rapidity divergences, we decompose the DPS soft factor\nmatrices into a product of matrices with rapidity divergences in given sectors,\nand thus, define individual double parton distributions at NNLO. The rapidity\nanomalous dimension matrices for double parton distributions are presented in\nthe terms of TMD rapidity anomalous dimension. The analysis is done using the\ngenerating function approach to web diagrams. Significant part of the result is\nobtained from the symmetry properties of web diagrams without referring to\nexplicit expressions or a particular rapidity regularization scheme.\nAdditionally, we present NNLO expression for the web diagram generating\nfunction for Wilson lines with two light-like directions.\n", "  We investigate the effect of strong disorder on a system with strong\nelectronic repulsion. In absence of disorder, the system has a d-wave\nsuperconducting ground-state with strong non-BCS features due to its proximity\nto a Mott insulator. We find that, while strong correlations make\nsuperconductivity in this system immune to weak disorder, superconductivity is\ndestroyed efficiently when disorder strength is comparable to the effective\nbandwidth. The suppression of charge motion in regions of strong potential\nfluctuation leads to formation of Mott insulating patches, which anchor a\nlarger non-superconducting region around them. The system thus breaks into\nislands of Mott insulating and superconducting regions, with Anderson\ninsulating regions occurring along the boundary of these regions. Thus,\nelectronic correlation and disorder, when both are strong, aid each other in\ndestroying superconductivity, in contrast to their competition at weak\ndisorder. Our results shed light on why Zinc impurities are efficient in\ndestroying superconductivity in cuprates, even though it is robust to weaker\nimpurities.\n", "  We introduce a transverse field Ising model with order N^2 spins interacting\nvia a nonlocal quartic interaction. The model has an O(N,Z), hyperoctahedral,\nsymmetry. We show that the large N partition function admits a saddle point in\nwhich the symmetry is enhanced to O(N). We further demonstrate that this\n`matrix saddle' correctly computes large N observables at weak and strong\ncoupling. The matrix saddle undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition at\nintermediate couplings. At the transition the matrix eigenvalue distribution\nbecomes disconnected. The critical excitations are described by large N matrix\nquantum mechanics. At the critical point, the low energy excitations are waves\npropagating in an emergent 1+1 dimensional spacetime.\n", "  Solitons propagating in media with higher order dispersion will shed\nradiation known as dispersive wave or resonant radiation, with applications in\nfrequency broadening, deep UV sources for spectroscopy or simply fundamental\nstudies of soliton physics. Starting from a recently proposed equation that\nmodels the behaviour of ultrashort optical pulses in nonlinear materials using\nthe analytic signal, we find that the resonant radiation associated with the\nthird-harmonic generation term of the equation is parametrically stimulated\nwith an unprecedented gain. Resonant radiation levels, typically only a small\nfraction of the soliton, are now as intense as the soliton itself. The\nmechanism is quite universal and works also in normal dispersion and with\nharmonics higher than the third. We report experimental hints of this\nsuper-resonant radiation stimulated by the fifth harmonic in diamond.\n", "  Within the Color Glass Condensate effective theory, we reconsider the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) calculation of the single inclusive particle\nproduction at forward rapidities in proton-nucleus collisions at high energy.\nFocusing on quark production for definiteness, we establish a new factorization\nscheme, perturbatively correct through NLO, in which there is no `rapidity\nsubtraction'. That is, the NLO correction to the impact factor is not\nexplicitly separated from the high-energy evolution. Our construction exploits\nthe skeleton structure of the (NLO) Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, in which the\nfirst step of the evolution is explicitly singled out. The NLO impact factor is\nincluded by computing this first emission with the exact kinematics for the\nemitted gluon, rather than by using the eikonal approximation. This particular\ncalculation has already been presented in the literature [1,2], but the\nreorganization of the perturbation theory that we propose is new. As compared\nto the proposal in [1,2], our scheme is free of the fine-tuning inherent in the\nrapidity subtraction, which might be the origin of the negativity of the NLO\ncross-section observed in previous studies.\n", "  We explore the phase diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model with nearest\nneighbor interactions on the honeycomb lattice using the exact diagonalization\nof finite systems combined with the cluster mean field approximation, and\nsupplemented by the insights from the linear spin-wave and second--order\nperturbation theories. This study confirms that by varying the balance between\nthe Heisenberg and Kitaev term, frustrated exchange interactions stabilize in\nthis model four phases with magnetic long range order: N\\'eel phase,\nferromagnetic phase, and two other phases with coexisting antiferromagnetic and\nferromagnetic bonds, zigzag and stripy phases. They are separated by two\ndisordered quantum spin-liquid phases, and the one with ferromagnetic Kitaev\ninteractions has a substantially broader range of stability as the neighboring\ncompeting ordered phases, ferromagnetic and stripy, have very weak quantum\nfluctuations. Focusing on the quantum spin-liquid phases, we study spatial spin\ncorrelations and dynamic spin structure factor of the model by the exact\ndiagonalization technique, and discuss the evolution of gapped low-energy spin\nresponse across the quantum phase transitions between the disordered spin\nliquid and magnetic phases with long range order.\n", "  We have used transient absorption spectroscopy to measure carrier lifetimes\nin the multiband band semiconductor GaPAsN. These measurements probe the\nelectron populations in the conduction band, intermediate band and valance band\nas a function of time after an excitation pulse. Following photoexcitation of\nGaP0.32As0.67N0.01 we find that the electron population in the conduction band\ndecays exponentially with a time constant 23ps. The electron population in the\nintermediate band exhibits bimolecular recombination with recombination\nconstant r = 2 10^-8 cm-3/s. In our experiment an optical pump pulse excited\nelectrons from the valance band to the intermediate and conduction bands, and\nthe change in interband absorption due to absorption saturation and induced\nabsorption was probed with a delayed white light pulse. We modeled the optical\nproperties of our samples using the band anti-crossing model to extract carrier\ndensities as a function of time. These results indicate that the minority\ncarrier lifetimes are too short for efficient solar power conversion and that\nimprovements in material quality will be required for practical applications of\nGaPAsN based intermediate band solar cells.\n", "  The WIMPs are considered one of the favorable dark matter (DM) candidates,\nbut as the upper bounds on the interactions between DM and standard model (SM)\nparticles obtained by the upgraded facilities of DM direct detections get lower\nand lower. Researchers turn their attentions to search for less massive DM\ncandidates, i.e. light dark matter of MeV scale. The recently measured\nanomalous transition in $^8$Be suggests that there exists a vectorial boson\nwhich may mediate the interaction between DM and SM particles. Based on this\nscenario, we combine the relevant cosmological data to constrain the mass range\nof DM, and have found that there exists a model parameter space where the\nrequirements are satisfied, a range of $10.4 \\lesssim m_{\\phi} \\lesssim $ 16.7\nMeV for scalar DM, and $13.6 \\lesssim m_{V} \\lesssim $ 16.7 MeV for vectorial\nDM is demanded. Then a possibility of directly detecting such light DM\nparticles via the DM-electron scattering is briefly studied in this framework.\n", "  We study gauge symmetry breaking patterns of the five-dimensional $SU(5)$\ngrand gauge-Higgs unification compactified on an orbifold $S^1/{\\mathbb Z}_2$\nwith the Hosotani mechanism in the framework of the diagonal embedding method.\nWe find matter contents that lead to the $SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$ gauge\nsymmetry on the global minimum of the effective potential and also present\nexamples of matter content for which each regular subgroup of $SU(5)$ is\nrealized as vacuum configuration. The finite temperature phase transitions for\nthe models with the gauge symmetry of the standard model at zero temperature\nand also for supersymmetric models are studied. We show in a certain model with\nsupersymmetry that the vacuum of the standard model selected dynamically before\nthe inflation continues to stay there up to the present.\n", "  We study deformations of 2D Integrable Quantum Field Theories (IQFT) which\npreserve integrability (the existence of infinitely many local integrals of\nmotion). The IQFT are understood as \"effective field theories\", with finite\nultraviolet cutoff. We show that for any such IQFT there are infinitely many\nintegrable deformations generated by scalar local fields $X_s$, which are in\none-to-one correspondence with the local integrals of motion; moreover, the\nscalars $X_s$ are built from the components of the associated conserved\ncurrents in a universal way. The first of these scalars, $X_1$, coincides with\nthe composite field $(T{\\bar T})$ built from the components of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. The deformations of quantum field theories generated by\n$X_1$ are \"solvable\" in a certain sense, even if the original theory is not\nintegrable. In a massive IQFT the deformations $X_s$ are identified with the\ndeformations of the corresponding factorizable S-matrix via the CDD factor. The\nsituation is illustrated by explicit construction of the form factors of the\noperators $X_s$ in sine-Gordon theory. We also make some remarks on the problem\nof UV completeness of such integrable deformations.\n", "  Magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are one kind of fundamental structures in the\nsolar physics, and involved in various eruption phenomena. Twist,\ncharacterizing how the magnetic field lines wind around a main axis, is an\nintrinsic property of MFRs, closely related to the magnetic free energy and\nstableness. So far it is unclear how much amount of twist is carried by MFRs in\nthe solar atmosphere and in heliosphere and what role the twist played in the\neruptions of MFRs. Contrasting to the solar MFRs, there are lots of in-situ\nmeasurements of magnetic clouds (MCs), the large-scale MFRs in interplanetary\nspace, providing some important information of the twist of MFRs. Thus,\nstarting from MCs, we investigate the twist of interplanetary MFRs with the aid\nof a velocity-modified uniform-twist force-free flux rope model. It is found\nthat most of MCs can be roughly fitted by the model and nearly half of them can\nbe fitted fairly well though the derived twist is probably over-estimated by a\nfactor of 2.5. By applying the model to 115 MCs observed at 1 AU, we find that\n(1) the twist angles of interplanetary MFRs generally follow a trend of about\n$0.6\\frac{l}{R}$ radians, where $\\frac{l}{R}$ is the aspect ratio of a MFR,\nwith a cutoff at about $12\\pi$ radians AU$^{-1}$, (2) most of them are\nsignificantly larger than $2.5\\pi$ radians but well bounded by $2\\frac{l}{R}$\nradians, (3) strongly twisted magnetic field lines probably limit the expansion\nand size of MFRs, and (4) the magnetic field lines in the legs wind more\ntightly than those in the leading part of MFRs. These results not only advance\nour understanding of the properties and behavior of interplanetary MFRs, but\nalso shed light on the formation and eruption of MFRs in the solar atmosphere.\nA discussion about the twist and stableness of solar MFRs are therefore given.\n", "  Competing exchange interactions can produce complex magnetic states together\nwith spin-induced electric polarizations. With competing interactions on\nalternating triangular and kagome layers, the swedenborgite CBO may have one of\nthe largest measured spin-induced polarizations of about 1700 nC/cm$^2$ below\nits ferrimagnetic transition temperature at 70 K. Powder neutron-diffraction\ndata, magnetization measurements, and spin-wave resonance frequencies in the\nTHz range reveal that the complex spin order of multiferroic CBO can be\ndescribed as a triangular array of c-axis chains ferrimagnetically coupled to\neach other in the ab plane. Magnetostriction on bonds that couple those chains\nproduces the large spin-induced polarization of CBO.\n", "  In relativistic ion collisions there are excellent opportunities to produce\nand investigate hyper-nuclei. We have systematically studied the formation of\nhypernuclear spectator residues in peripheral heavy-ion collisions with the\ntransport DCM and UrQMD models. The hyperon capture was calculated within the\npotential and coalescence approaches. We demonstrate that even at the beam\nenergies around and lower than the threshold for producing Lambda hyperons in\nbinary nucleon-nucleon interactions a considerable amount of hypernuclei,\nincluding multi-strange ones, can be produced. This is important for\npreparation of new experiments on hypernuclei in the wide energy range. The\nuncertainties of the predictions are investigated within the models, and the\ncomparison with the strangeness production measured in experiments is also\nperformed.\n", "  We consider a self-avoiding walk on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice,\nterminally attached to an impenetrable hyperplane at which it can adsorb. When\na force is applied the walk can be pulled off the surface and we consider the\nsituation where the force is applied at the middle vertex of the walk. We show\nthat the temperature dependence of the critical force required for desorption\ndiffers from the corresponding value when the force is applied at the end-point\nof the walk. This is of interest in single molecule pulling experiments since\nit shows that the required force can depend on where the force is applied. We\nalso briefly consider the situation when the force is applied at other interior\nvertices of the walk.\n", "  The semiconducting single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides have been\nidentified as ideal materials for accessing and manipulating spin- and\nvalley-quantum numbers due to a set of favorable optical selection rules in\nthese materials. Here, we apply time- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy to directly probe optically excited free carriers in the\nelectronic band structure of a high quality single layer of WS$_2$. We observe\nthat the optically generated free hole density in a single valley can be\nincreased by a factor of 2 using a circularly polarized optical excitation.\nMoreover, we find that by varying the photon energy of the excitation we can\ntune the free carrier density in a given spin-split state around the valence\nband maximum of the material. The control of the photon energy and polarization\nof the excitation thus permits us to selectively excite free electron-hole\npairs with a given spin and within a single valley.\n", "  The possibility of the mechanical detection of the Casimir friction using the\nnon-contact force microscope is discussed. On a SiO2 tip situated above a\ngraphene-covered SiO2 substrate will act the frictional drag force mediated by\na fluctuating electromagnetic field produced by a current in the graphene\nsheet. This friction force will produce the bending of the cantilever, which\ncan be measured by state-of-art non-contact force microscope. Both the thermal\nand quantum contributions to the Casimir frictional drag force can be studied\nusing this experimental setup. This result paves the ways for the mechanical\ndetection of the Casimir friction and for the application of the frictional\ndrag effect in micro- and nano- electromechanical devices (MEMS and NEMS).\n", "  Sun's gravitation potential at earth varies during a year due to varying\nEarth-Sun distance. Comparing the results of very accurate measurements of\natomic clock transitions performed at different time in the year allows us to\nstudy the dependence of the atomic frequencies on the gravitational potential.\nWe examine the measurement data for the ratio of the frequencies in Hg$^+$ and\nAl$^+$ clock transitions and absolute frequency measurements (with respect to\ncaesium frequency standard) for Dy, Sr, H, hyperfine transitions in Rb and H,\nand obtain significantly improved limits on the values of the gravity related\nparameter of the Einstein Equivalence Principle violating term in the Standard\nModel Extension Hamiltonian $c_{00} = (3.0 \\pm 5.7) \\times 10^{-7}$ and the\nparameter for the gravity-related variation of the fine structure constant\n$\\kappa_{\\alpha} = (-5.3 \\pm 10) \\times 10^{-8}$.\n", "  Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) implies quantum phenomena. In\nthis light we establish that the Moreva \\textit{et al.} \\cite{moreva}\nexperiment demonstrating the Page-Wootter's mechanism \\cite{wootters} falls in\nthe quantum domain. An observer outside a 2-photons world does not detect any\nchange in the $2-$photons state,i.e. there is no time parameter for the outside\nobserver. But an observer attached to one of the photons sees the other photon\nevolving and this means there is an \"internal\" time. The LGI is violated for\nthe clock photon whose state evolves with the internal time as measured by the\nsystem photon. Conditional probabilities in this 2-photons system are computed\nfor both sharp and unsharp measurements. The conditional probability increases\nfor entangled states as obtained by Page and Wootters for both ideal and also\nunsharp measurements. We discuss how the conditional probabilities can be used\nto distinguish between massless and massive gravitons. This is important in the\ncontext of gravitational waves.\n", "  A mixed suspension of red blood cells (RBCs) and microparticles flows through\na cylindrical channel with a constriction mimicking a stenosed blood vessel.\nOur three-dimensional Lattice-Boltzmann simulations show that the RBCs are\ndepleted right ahead and after the constriction. Although the RBC mean\nconcentration (hematocrit) is 16.5% or 23.7%, their axial concentration profile\nis very similar to that of isolated tracer particles flowing along the central\naxis. Most importantly, however, we find that the stiff microparticles exhibit\nthe opposite behavior. Arriving on a marginated position near the channel wall,\nthey can pass through the constriction only if they find a suitable gap to dip\ninto the dense plug of RBCs occupying the channel center. This leads to a\nprolonged dwell time and, as a consequence, to a pronounced increase in\nmicroparticle concentration right in front of the constriction. For\nbiochemically active particles such as drug delivery agents or activated\nplatelets this clustering may lead to physiologically relevant hot spots of\nbiochemical activity.\n", "  For any convex non-collinear central configuration of the planar Newtonian\n4-body problem with adjacent equal masses $m_1=m_2\\neq m_3=m_4$, with equal\nlengths for the two diagonals, we prove it must possess a symmetry and must be\nan isosceles trapezoid; furthermore, which is also an isosceles trapezoid when\nthe length between $m_1$ and $ m_4$ equals the length between $m_2$ and $ m_3$.\n", "  We theoretically consider the spin Seebeck effect, the charge Seebeck\ncoefficient, and the thermoelectric figure of merit in superconducting hybrid\nstructures including either magnetic textures or intrinsic spin-orbit coupling.\nWe demonstrate that large magnitudes for all these quantities are obtainable in\nJosephson-based systems with either zero or a small externally applied magnetic\nfield. This provides an alternative to the thermoelectric effects generated in\nhigh-field ($\\sim 1$ T) superconducting hybrid systems, which were recently\nexperimentally demonstrated. The systems studied contain either textured\nferromagnets, spin-active interfaces, or spin-orbit coupling. We present a\nframework for calculating the linear thermoelectric response for both spin and\ncharge of a system upon applying temperature and voltage gradients based on\nquasiclassical theory which allows for arbitrary spin-dependent textures and\nfields to be conveniently incorporated.\n", "  We examine the effect of secular perturbations by giant planets on systems of\nmultiple, lower mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars. We simulate the effects\nof forcing both eccentricity and inclination, separately and together. We\ncompare our results to the statistics of the observed Kepler data and examine\nwhether these results can be used to explain the observed excess of single\ntransiting planets. We cannot explain the observed excess by pumping only\ninclination without driving most systems over the edge of dynamical\ninstability. Thus, we expect the underlying planetary population for systems\nwith a single transitting planet to contain an intrinsically low multiplicity\npopulation. We can explain the Kepler statistics and occurrence rates for R< 2\nRearth planets with a perturber population consistent with that inferred from\nradial velocity surveys, but require too many giant planets if we wish to\nexplain all planets with R < 4 Rearth. These numbers can be brought into\nagreement if we posit the existence of an equivalent size population of planets\nbelow the RV detection limit (of characteristic mass 0.1 Mjupiter). This\npopulation would need to be dynamically hot to produce sufficiently strong\nperturbations and would leave the imprint of high obliquities amongst the\nsurviving planets. Thus, an extensive sample of obliquities for low mass\nplanets can help to indicate the presence of such a population. (...) Some of\nour simulations also produce planetary systems with planets that survive in the\nhabitable zone but have no planets interior to them -- much as in the case of\nour Solar System. This suggests that such a configuration may not be altogether\nrare, but may occur around a few percent of FGK stars.\n", "  A method for producing narrow-band THz radiation proposes passing an\nultra-relativistic beam through a metallic pipe with small periodic\ncorrugations. We present results of a measurement of such an arrangement at\nBrookhaven's Accelerator Test Facility (ATF). Our pipe was copper and was 5 cm\nlong; the aperture was cylindrically symmetric, with a 1 mm (radius) bore and a\ncorrugation depth (peak-to-peak) of 60 um. In the experiment we measured both\nthe effect on the beam of the structure wakefield and the spectral properties\nof the radiation excited by the beam. We began by injecting a relatively long\nbeam compared to the wavelength of the radiation, but with short rise time, to\nexcite the structure, and then used a downstream spectrometer to infer the\nradiation wavelength. This was followed by injecting a shorter bunch, and then\nusing an interferometer (also downstream of the corrugated pipe) to measure the\nspectrum of the induced THz radiation. For the THz pulse we obtain and compare\nwith calculations: the central frequency, the bandwidth, and the spectral\npower---compared to a diffraction radiation background signal.\n", "  The Clifford hierarchy is a set of gates that appears in the theory of\nfault-tolerant quantum computation, but its precise structure remains elusive.\nWe give a complete characterization of the diagonal gates in the Clifford\nhierarchy for prime-dimensional qudits. They turn out to be $p^{m}$-th roots of\nunity raised to polynomial functions of the basis state to which they are\napplied, and we determine which level of the Clifford hierarchy a given gate\nsits in based on $m$ and the degree of the polynomial.\n", "  Precise measurements of charged-kaon multiplicities in deep inelastic\nscattering were performed. The results are presented in three-dimensional bins\nof the Bjorken scaling variable x, the relative virtual-photon energy y, and\nthe fraction z of the virtual-photon energy carried by the produced hadron. The\ndata were obtained by the COMPASS Collaboration by scattering 160 GeV muons off\nan isoscalar 6 LiD target. They cover the kinematic domain 1 (GeV/c)2 < Q2 < 60\n(GeV/c)^2 in the photon virtuality, 0.004 < x < 0.4, 0.1 < y < 0.7, 0.20 < z <\n0.85, and W > 5 GeV/c^2 in the invariant mass of the hadronic system. The\nresults from the sum of the z-integrated K+ and K- multiplicities at high x\npoint to a value of the non-strange quark fragmentation function larger than\nobtained by the earlier DSS fit.\n", "  We present a study of four different formation scenarios that may be able to\nexplain the origin of the recently announced planet (`Proxima b') orbiting\nProxima Centauri. The aim is to examine how the formation scenarios differ in\ntheir predictions for the multiplicity of the Proxima system, the\nwater/volatile content of Proxima b and its orbital eccentricity, so that these\ncan be tested by future observations. A scenario of in situ formation via giant\nimpacts from a locally enhanced disc of planetary embryos/planetesimals\npredicts that Proxima b will be in a multiplanet system with a measurably\nfinite eccentricity. Assuming that the local solid enhancement needed to form a\nProxima b analogue arises because of the inwards drift of solids in the form of\nsmall planetesimals/boulders, this scenario also results in Proxima b analogues\nbeing only moderately endowed with water/volatiles. A scenario in which\nmultiple embryos form, migrate and mutually collide within a gas disc results\nin Proxima b being a member of a multiple system, possibly displaying mean\nmotion resonances, but where the constituent members are Ocean planets due to\naccretion occurring mainly outside of the snowline. A scenario in which a\nsingle accreting embryo forms outside the snowline, and migrates inwards while\naccreting planetesimals/pebbles results in Proxima b being an isolated Ocean\nplanet on a circular orbit. A scenario in which Proxima b formed via pebble\naccretion interior to the snowline produces a dry planet on a circular orbit.\nFuture observations that characterise the physical and orbital properties of\nProxima b, and any additional planets in the system, will provide valuable\ninsights into the formation history of this neighbouring planetary system.\n", "  Work is one of the most basic notion in statistical mechanics, with work\nfluctuation theorems being one central topic in nanoscale thermodynamics. With\nHamiltonian chaos commonly thought to provide a foundation for classical\nstatistical mechanics, here we present general salient results regarding how\n(classical) Hamiltonian chaos generically impacts on nonequilibrium work\nfluctuations. For isolated chaotic systems prepared with a microcanonical\ndistribution, work fluctuations are minimized and vanish altogether in\nadiabatic work protocols. For isolated chaotic systems prepared at an initial\ncanonical distribution at inverse temperature $\\beta$, work fluctuations\ndepicted by the variance of $e^{-\\beta W}$ are also minimized by adiabatic work\nprotocols. This general result indicates that if the variance of $e^{-\\beta W}$\ndiverges for an adiabatic work protocol, then it diverges for all nonadiabatic\nwork protocols sharing the same initial and final Hamiltonians. How such\ndivergence explicitly impacts on the efficiency of using the Jarzynski's\nequality to simulate free energy differences is studied in a Sinai model. Our\ngeneral insights shall boost studies in nanoscale thermodynamics and are of\nfundamental importance in designing useful work protocols.\n", "  We perform the calculation of all relativistic and quantum electrodynamic\ncorrections of the order of $\\alpha^6\\,m$ to the ground electronic state of a\nhydrogen molecule and present improved results for the dissociation and the\nfundamental transitions energies. These results open the window for the\nhigh-precision spectroscopy of H$_2$ and related low-energy tests of\nfundamental interactions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the productions of the newly detected states\n$D_{sJ}(3040)$ and $D_J(3000)$ observed by BABAR Collaboration and LHCb\nCollaboration. We assume these states to be the $D_s(2P)$ and $D(2P)$ states\nwith the quantum number $J^P=1^+$ in our work. The results of improved\nBethe-Salpeter method indicate that the semi-leptonic decays via $B_s$ and $B$\ninto $D_{sJ}(3040)$ and $D_J(3000)$ have considerable branching ratios, for\nexample, Br($\\bar{B}_s^0 \\rightarrow\nD{_{sJ}^+}(3040)e^-\\bar{\\nu}{_e}$)=$5.79\\times10^{-4}$,\nBr($\\bar{B}^0\\rightarrow D_{J}^+(3000)e^-\\bar{\\nu}{_e}$)=$2.63\\times10^{-4}$,\nwhich shows that these semi-leptonic decays can be accessible in experiments.\n", "  The epidemic spreading has been widely studied when each node may get\ninfected by an infected neighbor with the same rate. However, the infection\nrate between a pair of nodes is usually heterogeneous and even correlated with\ntheir nodal degrees in the contact network. We aim to understand how such\ncorrelated heterogeneous infection rates influence the spreading on different\nnetwork topologies. Motivated by real-world datasets, we propose a correlated\nheterogeneous Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model which assumes that the\ninfection rate $\\beta_{ij}(=\\beta_{ji})$ between node $i$ and $j$ is correlated\nwith the degree of the two end nodes: $\\beta_{ij}=c(d_id_j)^\\alpha$, where\n$\\alpha$ indicates the strength of the correlation and $c$ is selected so that\nthe average infection rate is $1$. In order to understand the effect of such\ncorrelation on epidemic spreading, we consider as well the corresponding\nuncorrected but still heterogeneous infection rate scenario as a reference,\nwhere the original correlated infection rates in our CSIS model are shuffled\nand reallocated to the links of the same network topology. We compare these two\nscenarios in the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state on\nErd{\\\"o}s-R{\\'e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) networks with a similar average\ndegree. Through the continuous-time simulations, we find that, when the\nrecovery rate is small, the negative correlation is more likely to help the\nepidemic spread and the positive correlation prohibit the spreading; as the\nrecovery rate increases to be larger than a critical value, the positive but\nnot negative correlation tends to help the spreading. Our findings are further\nanalytically proved in a wheel network (one central node connects with each of\nthe nodes in a ring) and validated on real-world networks with correlated\nheterogeneous interaction frequencies.\n", "  The role of instantons is investigated in the Lagrangian model for the\nvelocity gradient evolution known as the Recent Fluid Deformation\napproximation. After recasting the model into the path-integral formalism, the\nprobability distribution function is computed along with the most probable path\nin the weak noise limit through the saddle-point approximation. Evaluation of\nthe instanton solution is implemented numerically by means of the iteratively\nChernykh-Stepanov method. In the case of the longitudinal velocity gradient\nstatistics, due to symmetry reasons, the number of degrees of freedom can be\nreduced to one, allowing the pdf to be evaluated analytically as well, thereby\nenabling a prediction of the scaling of the moments as a function of Reynolds\nnumber. It is also shown that the instanton solution lies on the Vieillefosse\nline concerning the RQ-plane. We illustrate how instantons can be unveiled in\nthe stochastic dynamics performing a conditional statistics.\n", "  In this work we theoretically study, using Floquet-Bloch theory, the\ninfluence of circularly and linearly polarized light on two-dimensional band\nstructures with Dirac and quadratic band touching points, and flat bands,\ntaking the nearest neighbor hopping model on the kagome lattice as an example.\nWe find circularly polarized light can invert the ordering of this three band\nmodel, while leaving the flat-band dispersionless. We find a small gap is also\nopened at the quadratic band touching point by 2-photon and higher order\nprocesses. By contrast, linearly polarized light splits the quadratic band\ntouching point (into two Dirac points) by an amount that depends only on the\namplitude and polarization direction of the light, independent of the\nfrequency, and generally renders dispersion to the flat band. The splitting is\nperpendicular to the direction of the polarization of the light. We derive an\neffective low-energy theory that captures these key results. Finally, we\ncompute the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity for this 3-band\nmodel and analyze the various interband contributions of the Floquet modes. Our\nresults suggest strategies for optically controlling band structure and\ninteraction strength in real systems.\n", "  We study the molecular abundance and spatial distribution of the simplest\nsugar alcohol, ethylene glycol (EG), the simplest sugar glycoladehyde (GA), and\nother chemically related complex organic species towards the massive\nstar-forming region G31.41+0.31. We have analyzed multiple single dish and\ninterferometric data, and obtained excitation temperatures and column densities\nusing an LTE analysis. We have reported for the first time the presence of EG\ntowards G31.41+0.31, and we have also detected multiple transitions of other\ncomplex organic molecules such as GA, methyl formate (MF), dimethyl ether (DME)\nand ethanol (ET). The high angular resolution images show that the EG emission\nis very compact, peaking towards the maximum of the continuum. These\nobservations suggest that low abundance complex organic molecules, like EG or\nGA, are good probes of the gas located closer to the forming stars. Our\nanalysis confirms that EG is more abundant than GA in G31.41+0.31, as\npreviously observed in other interstellar regions. Comparing different\nstar-forming regions we find evidence of an increase of the EG/GA abundance\nratio with the luminosity of the source. The DME/MF and EG/ET ratios are nearly\nconstant with luminosity. We have also found that the abundance ratios of pairs\nof isomers GA/MF and ET/DME decrease with the luminosity of the sources. The\nmost likely explanation for the behavior of the EG/GA ratio is that these\nmolecules are formed by different chemical formation routes not directly\nlinked; although warm-up timescales effects and different formation and\ndestruction efficiencies in the gas phase cannot be ruled out. The most likely\nformation route of EG is by combination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on dust\ngrains. We also favor that GA is formed via the solid-phase dimerization of the\nformyl radical HCO, and a chemical link between MF and DME.\n", "  We study charged lepton flavor-violating (LFV) transitions in the color octet\nmodel that generates neutrino mass and lepton mixing at one loop. By taking\ninto account neutrino oscillation data and assuming octet particles of TeV\nscale mass, we examine the feasibility to detect these transitions in current\nand future experiments. We find that for general values of parameters the\nbranching ratios for LFV decays of the Higgs and $Z$ bosons are far below\ncurrent and even future experimental bounds. For LFV transitions of the muon,\nthe present bounds can be satisfied generally, while future sensitivities could\ndistinguish between the singlet and triplet color-octet fermions. The triplet\ncase could be ruled out by future $\\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei, and for the\nsinglet case the conversion and the decays $\\mu\\to 3e,~e\\gamma$ play\ncomplementary roles in excluding relatively low mass regions of the octet\nparticles.\n", "  We present a spectrum-splitting approach to conduct all-electron Kohn-Sham\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations by employing Fermi-operator\nexpansion of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. The proposed approach splits the\nsubspace containing the occupied eigenspace into a core-subspace, spanned by\nthe core eigenfunctions, and its complement, the valence-subspace, and thereby\nenables an efficient computation of the Fermi-operator expansion by reducing\nthe expansion to the valence-subspace projected Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. The key\nideas used in our approach are: (i) employ Chebyshev filtering to compute a\nsubspace containing the occupied states followed by a localization procedure to\ngenerate non-orthogonal localized functions spanning the Chebyshev-filtered\nsubspace; (ii) compute the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian projected onto the\nvalence-subspace; (iii) employ Fermi-operator expansion in terms of the\nvalence-subspace projected Hamiltonian to compute the density matrix,\nelectron-density and band energy. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance\nof the method on benchmark materials systems involving silicon nano-clusters up\nto 1330 electrons, a single gold atom and a six-atom gold nano-cluster. The\nbenchmark studies on silicon nano-clusters revealed a staggering five-fold\nreduction in the Fermi-operator expansion polynomial degree by using the\nspectrum-splitting approach for accuracies in the ground-state energies of\n$\\sim 10^{-4} Ha/atom$ with respect to reference calculations. Further,\nnumerical investigations on gold suggest that spectrum splitting is\nindispensable to achieve meaningful accuracies, while employing Fermi-operator\nexpansion.\n", "  In this paper, we present Poisson brackets of certain classes of mappings\nobtained as general periodic reductions of integrable lattice equations. The\nPoisson brackets are derived using the so called Ostrogradsky transformation.\n", "  We present the mathematical analysis of generalized complex contagions in\nclustered multiplex networks for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-like\ndynamics. The model is intended to understand diffusion of influence, or any\nother spreading process implying a threshold dynamics, in setups of\ninterconnected networks with significant clustering. The contagion is assumed\nto be general enough to account for a content-dependent linear threshold model,\nwhere each link type has a different weight (for spreading influence) that may\ndepend on the content (e.g., product, rumor, political view) that is being\nspread. Using the generating functions formalism, we determine the conditions,\nprobability, and expected size of the emergent global cascades. This analysis\nprovides a generalization of previous approaches and is specially useful in\nproblems related to spreading and percolation. The results present non trivial\ndependencies between the clustering coefficient of the networks and its average\ndegree. In particular, several phase transitions are shown to occur depending\non these descriptors. Generally speaking, our findings reveal that increasing\nclustering decreases the probability of having global cascades and their size,\nhowever this tendency changes with the average degree. There exists a certain\naverage degree from which on clustering favours the probability and size of the\ncontagion. By comparing the dynamics of complex contagions over multiplex\nnetworks and their monoplex projections, we demonstrate that ignoring link\ntypes and aggregating network layers may lead to inaccurate conclusions about\ncontagion dynamics, particularly when the correlation of degrees between layers\nis high.\n", "  The universal aspects of atom-dimer elastic collisions are investigated\nwithin the framework of Faddeev equations. The two-body interactions between\nthe neutral atoms are approximated by the separable potential approach. Our\nanalysis considers a pure van der Waals potential tail as well as soft-core van\nder Waals interactions permitting us in this manner to address the universally\ngeneral features of atom-dimer resonant spectra. In particular, we show that\nthe atom-dimer resonances are solely associated with the {\\it excited} Efimov\nstates. Furthermore, the positions of the corresponding resonances for a\nsoft-core potentials with more than 5 bound states are in good agreement with\nthe corresponding results from an infinitely deep pure van der Waals tail\npotential.\n", "  The estimation of the critical current ($I_c$) and AC losses of\nhigh-temperature superconductor (HTS) devices through modeling and simulation\nrequires the knowledge of the critical current density ($J_c$) of the\nsuperconducting material. This $J_c$ is in general not constant and depends\nboth on the magnitude ($B_{loc}$) and the direction ($\\theta$, relative to the\ntape) of the local magnetic flux density. In principle, $J_c(B_{loc},\\theta)$\ncan be obtained from the experimentally measured critical current\n$I_c(B_a,\\theta)$, where $B_a$ is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field.\nHowever, for applications where the superconducting materials experience a\nlocal field that is close to the self field of an isolated conductor, obtaining\n$J_c(B_{loc},\\theta)$ form $I_c(B_a,\\theta)$ is not a trivial task. It is\nnecessary to solve an inverse problem to correct for the contribution derived\nfrom the self field. The methods presented in the literature comprise a series\nof approaches dealing with different degrees of mathematical regularization,\nsuch as the use of brute force or optimization methods to fit the parameters of\npreconceived non linear formulas. In this contribution, we present a\nparameter-free method that provides excellent reproduction of experimental data\nand requires no human interaction or preconception of the $J_c$ dependence with\nrespect to the magnetic field. In particular, it allows going from the\nexperimental data to a ready-to-run $J_c(B_{loc},\\theta)$ model in a few\nminutes.\n", "  The evolution of small magnetic features in quiet regions of the Sun provides\na unique window to probing solar magneto-convection. Here we analyze small\nscale magnetic features in the quiet Sun, using the high resolution,\nseeing-free observations from the Sunrise balloon borne solar observatory. Our\naim is to understand the contribution of different physical processes, such as\nsplitting, merging, emergence and cancellation of magnetic fields to the\nrearrangement, addition and removal of magnetic flux in the photosphere. We\nemploy a statistical approach for the analysis and the evolution studies are\ncarried out using a feature tracking technique. In this paper we provide a\ndetailed description of the feature tracking algorithm that we have newly\ndeveloped and we present the results of a statistical study of several physical\nquantities. The results on the fractions of the flux in the emergence,\nappearance, splitting, merging, disappearance and cancellation qualitatively\nagrees with other recent studies. To summarize, the total flux gained in\nunipolar appearance is an order of magnitude larger than the total flux gained\nin emergence. On the other hand, the bi-polar cancellation contributes nearly\nan equal amount to the loss of magnetic flux as unipolar disappearance. The\ntotal flux lost in cancellation is nearly $6-8$ times larger than the total\nflux gained in emergence. One big difference between our study and previous\nsimilar studies is that thanks to the higher spatial resolution of Sunrise we\ncan track features with fluxes as low as $9\\times10^{14}$ Mx. This flux is\nnearly an order of magnitude lower than the smallest fluxes of the features\ntracked in the highest resolution previous studies based on Hinode data.\n", "  The appearance of linear spaces, describing physical quantities by vectors\nand tensors, is ubiquitous in all of physics, from classical mechanics to the\nmodern notion of local Lorentz invariance. However, as natural as this seems to\nthe physicist, most computer scientists would argue that something like a\n\"local linear tangent space\" is not very typical and in fact a quite surprising\nproperty of any conceivable world or algorithm. In this paper, we take the\nperspective of the computer scientist seriously, and ask whether there could be\nany inherently information-theoretic reason to expect this notion of linearity\nto appear in physics. We give a series of simple arguments, spanning quantum\ninformation theory, group representation theory, and renormalization in quantum\ngravity, that supports a surprising thesis: namely, that the local linearity of\nspace-time might ultimately be a consequence of the linearity of probabilities.\nWhile our arguments involve a fair amount of speculation, they have the virtue\nof being independent of any detailed assumptions on quantum gravity, and they\nare in harmony with several independent recent ideas on emergent space-time in\nhigh-energy physics.\n", "  The gas dynamics under gravitational field is usually associated with the\nmultiple scale nature due to large density variation and a wide range of local\nKnudsen number. It is chal- lenging to construct a reliable numerical algorithm\nto accurately capture the non-equilibrium physical effect in different regimes.\nIn this paper, a well-balanced unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for all flow\nregimes under gravitational field will be developed, which can be used for the\nstudy of non-equilibrium gravitational gas system. The well-balanced scheme\nhere is defined as a method to evolve an isolated gravitational system under\nany initial condition to an isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium state and to\nkeep such a solution. To preserve such a property is important for a numerical\nscheme, which can be used for the study of slowly evolving gravitational\nsystem, such as the formation of star and galaxy. Based on the Boltzmann model\nwith external forcing term, an analytic time evolving (or scale-dependent)\nsolution is constructed to provide the corresponding dynamics in the cell size\nand time step scale, which is subsequently used in the construction of UGKS. As\na result, with the varia- tion of the ratio between the numerical time step and\nlocal particle collision time, the UGKS is able to recover flow physics in\ndifferent regimes and provides a continuum spectrum of gas dynamics. For the\nfirst time, the flow physics of a gravitational system in the transition regime\ncan be studied using the UGKS, and the non-equilibrium phenomena in such a\ngrav- itational system can be clearly identified. Many numerical examples will\nbe used to validate the scheme. New physical observation, such as the\ncorrelation between the gravitational field and the heat flux in the transition\nregime, will be presented. The current method provides an indispensable tool\nfor the study of non-equilibrium gravitational system.\n", "  We analyze time-discrete and continuous `fractional' random walks on\nundirected regular networks with special focus on cubic periodic lattices in\n$n=1,2,3,..$ dimensions. The fractional random walk dynamics is governed by a\nmaster equation involving {\\it fractional} powers of Laplacian matrices\n$L^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$}where $\\alpha=2$ recovers the normal walk. First we\ndemonstrate that the interval $0<\\alpha\\leq 2$ is admissible for the fractional\nrandom walk. We derive analytical expressions for fractional transition matrix\nand closely related the average return probabilities. We further obtain the\nfundamental matrix $Z^{(\\alpha)}$, and the mean relaxation time (Kemeny\nconstant) for the fractional random walk. The representation for the\nfundamental matrix $Z^{(\\alpha)}$ relates fractional random walks with normal\nrandom walks. We show that the fractional transition matrix elements exhibit\nfor large cubic $n$-dimensional lattices a power law decay of an\n$n$-dimensional infinite space Riesz fractional derivative type indicating\nemergence of L\\'evy flights. As a further footprint of L\\'evy flights in the\n$n$-dimensional space, the fractional transition matrix and fractional return\nprobabilities are dominated for large times $t$ by slowly relaxing long-wave\nmodes leading to a characteristic $t^{-\\frac{n}{\\alpha}}$-decay. It can be\nconcluded that, due to long range moves of fractional random walk, a small\nworld property is emerging increasing the efficiency to explore the lattice\nwhen instead of a normal random walk a fractional random walk is chosen.\n", "  Current and planned observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\npolarization anisotropies, with their ever increasing number of detectors, have\nreached a potential accuracy that requires a very demanding control of\nsystematic effects. While some of these systematics can be reduced in the\ndesign of the instruments, others will have to be modeled and hopefully\naccounted for or corrected a posteriori. We propose QuickPol, a quick and\naccurate calculation of the full effective beam transfer function and of\ntemperature to polarization leakage at the power spectra level, as induced by\nbeam imperfections and mismatches between detector optical and electronic\nresponses. All the observation details such as exact scanning strategy,\nimperfect polarization measurements, and flagged samples are accounted for. Our\nresults are validated on Planck high frequency instrument (HFI) simulations. We\nshow how the pipeline can be used to propagate instrumental uncertainties up to\nthe final science products, and could be applied to experiments with rotating\nhalf-wave plates.\n", "  We revisit the construction of local bulk operators in AdS/CFT with special\nfocus on gravitational dressing and its consequences for bulk locality.\nSpecializing to 2+1-dimensions, we investigate these issues via the proposed\nidentification between bulk operators and cross-cap boundary states. We obtain\nexplicit expressions for correlation functions of bulk fields with boundary\nstress tensor insertions, and find that they are free of non-local branch cuts\nbut do have non-local poles. We recover the HKLL recipe for restoring bulk\nlocality for interacting fields as the outcome of a natural CFT crossing\ncondition. We show that, in a suitable gauge, the cross-cap states solve the\nbulk wave equation for general background geometries, and satisfy a conformal\nWard identity analogous to a soft graviton theorem, Virasoro symmetry, the\nlarge N conformal bootstrap and the uniformization theorem all play a key role\nin our derivations.\n", "  We study diffusion of hardcore particles on a one dimensional periodic\nlattice subjected to a constraint that the separation between any two\nconsecutive particles does not increase beyond a fixed value $(n+1);$ initial\nseparation larger than $(n+1)$ can however decrease. These models undergo an\nabsorbing state phase transition when the conserved particle density of the\nsystem falls bellow a critical threshold $\\rho_c= 1/(n+1).$ We find that\n$\\phi_k$s, the density of $0$-clusters ($0$ representing vacancies) of size\n$0\\le k<n,$ vanish at the transition point along with activity density\n$\\rho_a$. The steady state of these models can be written in matrix product\nform to obtain analytically the static exponents $\\beta_k= n-k,\\nu=1=\\eta$\ncorresponding to each $\\phi_k$. We also show from numerical simulations that\nstarting from a natural condition, $\\phi_k(t)$s decay as $t^{-\\alpha_k}$ with\n$\\alpha_k= (n-k)/2$ even though other dynamic exponents $\\nu_t=2=z$ are\nindependent of $k$; this ensures the validity of scaling laws $\\beta= \\alpha\n\\nu_t,$ $\\nu_t = z \\nu$.\n", "  In the present paper, we propose a two-component generalization of the\nreduced Ostrovsky equation, whose differential form can be viewed as the\nshort-wave limit of a two-component Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation. They are\nintegrable due to the existence of Lax pairs. Moreover, we have shown that\ntwo-component reduced Ostrovsky equation can be reduced from an extended BKP\nhierarchy with negative flow through a pseudo 3-reduction and a hodograph\n(reciprocal) transform. As a by-product, its bilinear form and $N$-soliton\nsolution in terms of pfaffians are presented. One- and two-soliton solutions\nare provided and analyzed. In the second part of the paper, we start with a\nmodified BKP hierarchy, which is a B\\\"acklund transformation of the above\nextended BKP hierarchy, an integrable semi-discrete analogue of two-component\nreduced Ostrovsky equation is constructed by defining an appropriate discrete\nhodograph transform and dependent variable transformations. Especially, the\nbackward difference form of above semi-discrete two-component reduced Ostrovsky\nequation gives rise to the integrable semi-discretization of the short wave\nlimit of a two-component DP equation. Their $N$-soliton solutions in terms of\npffafians are also provided.\n", "  Measurements of the $^{17}$O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quadrupolar\nspectrum of apical oxygen in HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$ were performed over a\nrange of magnetic fields from 6.4 to 30\\,T in the superconducting state. Oxygen\nisotope exchanged single crystals were investigated with doping corresponding\nto superconducting transition temperatures from 74\\,K underdoped, to 78\\,K\noverdoped. The apical oxygen site was chosen since its NMR spectrum has narrow\nquadrupolar satellites that are well separated from any other resonance.\nNon-vortex contributions to the spectra can be deconvolved in the time domain\nto determine the local magnetic field distribution from the vortices. Numerical\nanalysis using Brandt's Ginzburg-Landau theory was used to find structural\nparameters of the vortex lattice, penetration depth, and coherence length as a\nfunction of magnetic field in the vortex solid phase. From this analysis we\nreport a vortex structural transition near 15\\,T from an oblique lattice with\nan opening angle of $73^{\\circ}$ at low magnetic fields to a triangular lattice\nwith $60^{\\circ}$ stabilized at high field. The temperature for onset of vortex\ndynamics has been identified with vortex lattice melting. This is independent\nof the magnetic field at sufficiently high magnetic field similar to that\nreported for YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ and Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta}$\nand is correlated with mass anisotropy of the material. This behavior is\naccounted for theoretically only in the limit of very high anisotropy.\n", "  Consistent description of 12C and 16O has been a long standing problem of\nmicroscopic alpha cluster models, where the wave function is fully\nantisymmetrized and the effective interaction is applied not between alpha\nclusters but between nucleons. When the effective interaction is designed to\nreproduce the binding energy of 16O (four alpha), the binding energy of 12C\n(three alpha) becomes underbound by about 10 MeV. In the present study, by\ntaking into account the coupling with the jj-coupling shell model components\nand utilizing Tohsaki interaction, which is phenomenological but has\nfinite-range three-body interaction terms, we show that consistent\nunderstanding of these nuclei can be achieved. The original Tohsaki interaction\ngives small overbound of about 3 MeV for 16O, and this is improved by slightly\nmodifying three-body Majorana exchange parameter. Also, the coupling with the\njj-coupling shell model wave function strongly contributes to the increase of\nthe binding energy of 12C. So far the application of Tohsaki interaction has\nbeen limited to 4N nuclei, and here, we add Bartlet and Heisenberg exchange\nterms in the two-body interaction for the purpose of applying it to\nneutron-rich systems, and it is applied to 6He.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations of layered BSCCO samples are used to investigate the\nbehavior of vortex matter at low fields, particularly in connection with the\npossible occurrence of a Bragg glass (BrG) phase at low density of columnar\ndefects, a phenomenon characterized by the prevalence of short-range over\nlong-range order. In this dislocation-free topological phase the translational\norder correlation function displays a power law decay. For magnetic induction\n$B=0.1$ kG the analysis of the data for the first Bragg peak of the planar\nstructure factor, the hexatic order parameter, and the Delaunay triangulation\nshows that, as the density of columnar defects is lowered, a \\textit{crossover}\n(or transition) from Bose glass to BrG phase takes place in this \\textit{highly\nanisotropic} high-T${}_c$ superconductor. Most importantly, an analysis of the\n{low-temperature} 3D vortex-vortex correlation function in terms of the\nstructure factor, calculated via a saddle point approach and the use of the\nnumerical data as input, provides clear-cut evidence of {the} power law decay\nof the {divergent} Bragg peaks in the BrG phase, a fundamental feature that was\ninequivocally verified only in isotropic compounds.\n", "  We investigate the inhomogeneous Rashba chain coupled to a superconducting\nsubstrate, hosting the Majorana quasiparticles near its edges. We discuss its\nsubgap spectrum and study how robust are the zero-energy quasiparticles against\nthe diagonal and off-diagonal disorder. Studying the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological\ninvariant we show that disorder induced transition from the topologically\nnon-trivial to trivial phases is manifested by characteristic features in the\nspatially-resolved quasiparticle spectrum at zero energy. We provide evidence\nfor the non-local nature of the zero-energy Majorana quasiparticles, that are\nwell preserved upon partitioning the chain into separate pieces. Even though\nthe Majorana quasiparticles are not completely immune to inhomogeneity we show\nthat they can spread onto other (normal) nanoscopic objects via the proximity\neffect.\n", "  Volatiles, especially CO, are important gas tracers of protoplanetary disks\n(PPDs). Freeze-out and sublimation processes determine their division between\ngas and solid phases, which affects both which disk regions can be traced by\nwhich volatiles, and the formation and composition of planets. Recently,\nmultiple lines of evidence suggest that CO is substantially depleted from the\ngas in the outer regions of PPDs. In this letter, we show that the gas dynamics\nin the outer PPDs facilitates volatile depletion through a mechanism which we\nterm \"runaway freeze-out\". Using a simple 1D model that incorporates dust\nsettling, turbulent diffusion of dust and volatiles, as well as volatile\nfreeze-out/sublimation processes, we show that as long as turbulence in the\ncold midplane is sufficiently weak to allow majority of the small grains to\nsettle, CO in the warm surface layer can be turbulently mixed into the midplane\nregion and depleted by freeze-out. The level of depletion sensitively depends\non the level of disk turbulence. Based on recent disk simulations that suggest\na layered turbulence profile with very weak midplane turbulence and strong\nturbulence at disk surface, CO and other volatiles can be efficiently depleted\nby a factor of a few over Myr timescales.\n", "  The mean-field dynamo model is employed to study the non-linear dynamo\nregimes in a fully convective star of mass 0.3$M_{\\odot}$ rotating with period\nof 10 days. For the intermediate value of the parameter of the turbulent\nmagnetic Prandl number, $Pm_{T}=3$ we found the oscillating dynamo regimes with\nperiod about 40Yr. The higher $Pm_{T}$ results to longer dynamo periods. If the\nlarge-scale flows is fixed we find that the dynamo transits from axisymmetric\nto non-axisymmetric regimes for the overcritical parameter of the\n$\\alpha$effect. The change of dynamo regime occurs because of the\nnon-axisymmetric non-linear $\\alpha$-effect. The situation persists in the\nfully non-linear dynamo models with regards of the magnetic feedback on the\nangular momentum balance and the heat transport in the star. It is found that\nthe large-scale magnetic field quenches the latitudinal shear in the bulk of\nthe star. However, the strong radial shear operates in the subsurface layer of\nthe star. In the nonlinear case the profile of the angular velocity inside the\nstar become close to the spherical surfaces. This supports the equator-ward\nmigration of the axisymmetric magnetic field dynamo waves. It was found that,\nthe magnetic configuration of the star dominates by the regular\nnon-axisymmetric mode m=1, forming Yin Yang magnetic polarity pattern with the\nstrong (>500 G) poloidal magnetic field in polar regions.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of entanglement and nonlocality for multipartite\nquantum systems under collective dephasing. Using an exact and computable\nmeasure for genuine entanglement, we demonstrate the possibility of a non\ntrivial phenomenon of time-invariant entanglement for multipartite quantum\nsystems. We find that for four qubits, there exist quantum states, which are\nchanging continously nevertheless their genuine entanglement remains constant.\nBased on our numerical results, we conjecture that there is no evidence of\ntime-invariant entanglement for quantum states of three qubits. We point out\nthat quantum states exhibiting time-invariant entanglement must live in both\ndecoherence free subspace and in the subspaces orthogonal to it. The previous\nstudies on this feature for two qubits can be recovered from our studies as a\nspecial case. We also study the nonlocality of quantum states under collective\ndephasing. We find that although genuine entanglement of quantum states may not\nchange, however their nonlocality changes. We discuss the possibility of finite\ntime end of genuine nonlocality.\n", "  We investigate the decays of the charmed baryons aiming at the systematic\nunderstanding of hadron internal structures based on the quark model by paying\nattention to heavy quark symmetry. We evaluate the decay widths from the one\npion emission for the known excited states, \\Lambda_c^*(2595),\n\\Lambda_c^*(2625), \\Lambda_c^*(2765), \\Lambda_c^*(2880) and \\Lambda_c^*(2940),\nas well as for the ground states \\Sigma_c(2455) and \\Sigma_c^*(2520). The decay\nproperties of the lower excited charmed baryons are well explained, and several\nimportant predictions for higher excited baryons are given. We find that the\naxial-vector type coupling of the pion to the light quarks is essential, which\nis expected from chiral symmetry, to reproduce the decay widths especially of\nthe low lying \\Lambda_c^* baryons. We emphasize the importance of the branching\nratios of \\Gamma(\\Sigma_c^*\\pi)/\\Gamma(\\Sigma_c\\pi) for the study of the nature\nof higher excited \\Lambda_c^* baryons.\n", "  We consider Chern-Simons actions of Abelian tensor hierarchy of $p$-form\ngauge fields in four-dimensional ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity. Using conformal\nsuperspace formalism, we solve the constraints on the field strengths of the\n$p$-form gauge superfields in the presence of the tensor hierarchy. The\nsolutions are expressed by the prepotentials of the $p$-form gauge superfields.\nWe show the internal and superconformal transformation laws of the\nprepotentials. The descent formalism for the Chern-Simons actions is exhibited.\n", "  A generalisation of quantum contextuality to the case of many indentical\nparticles is presented. The model consists of a finite collection of modes that\ncan be occupied by N particles, either bosons or fermions. Measurement\nscenarios allow one to measure occupation of each mode in at least two\ndifferent measurement contexts. The system is said to be non-contextual if the\noccupation numbers can be assigned to modes in each measurement scenario. The\nassignment is done under the non-contextuality assumption, i.e., an occupation\nnumber assigned to a mode does not depend on a scenario in which this mode is\nmeasured. In addition, the total number of particles has to be conserved,\ntherefore the sum of occupation numbers in each measurement context is equal to\nN. For N=1 the model does not differ from the standard contextuality scenario.\nHowever, for N>1 the problem reveals new complex features. In particular, it is\nshown that a type of contextuality exhibited by the system (state-dependent,\nstate-independent, or non-contextual) depends on the type and the number of\nparticles. Further properties of this model and open problems are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Organisms shape their own environment, which in turn affects their survival.\nThis feedback becomes especially important for communities containing a large\nnumber of species; however, few existing approaches allow studying this regime,\nexcept in simulations. Here, we use methods of statistical physics to\nanalytically solve a classic ecological model of resource competition\nintroduced by MacArthur in 1969. We show that the non-intuitive phenomenology\nof highly diverse ecosystems includes a phase where the environment constructed\nby the community becomes fully decoupled from the outside world.\n", "  We study one-dimensional spinless fermions with random interactions, but\nwithout any on-site disorder. We find that random interactions generically\nstabilize a many-body localized phase, in spite of the completely extended\nsingle-particle degrees of freedom. In the large randomness limit, we construct\n\"bubble-neck\" eigenstates having a universal area-law entanglement entropy on\naverage, with the number of volume-law states being exponentially suppressed.\nWe argue that this statistical localization is beyond the phenomenological\nlocal-integrals-of-motion description of many-body localization. With exact\ndiagonalization, we confirm the robustness of the many-body localized phase at\nfinite randomness by investigating eigenstate properties such as level\nstatistics, entanglement/participation entropies, and nonergodic quantum\ndynamics. At weak random interactions, the system develops a thermalization\ntransition when the single-particle hopping becomes dominant.\n", "  Over a handful of rotation periods, dynamical processes in barred galaxies\ninduce non-axisymmetric structure in dark matter halos. Using n-body\nsimulations of a Milky Way-like barred galaxy, we identify both a trapped\ndark-matter component, a shadow bar, and a strong response wake in the\ndark-matter distribution that affects the predicted dark-matter detection rates\nfor current experiments. The presence of a baryonic disk together with\nwell-known dynamical processes (e.g. spiral structure and bar instabilities)\nincrease the dark matter density in the disk plane. We find that the magnitude\nof the combined stellar and shadow bar evolution, when isolated from the effect\nof the axisymmetric gravitational potential of the disk, accounts for >30% of\nthis overall increase in disk-plane density. This is significantly larger that\nof previously claimed deviations from the standard halo model. The dark-matter\ndensity and kinematic wakes driven by the Milky Way bar increase the\ndetectability of dark matter overall, especially for the experiments with\nhigher $v_{min}$. These astrophysical features increase the detection rate by\nmore than a factor of two when compared to the standard halo model and by a\nfactor of ten for experiments with high minimum recoil energy thresholds. These\nsame features increase (decrease) the annual modulation for low (high) minimum\nrecoil energy experiments. We present physical arguments for why these dynamics\nare generic for barred galaxies such as the Milky Way rather than contingent on\na specific galaxy model.\n", "  We study transitions in the Kuramoto model by shedding light on asymmetry in\nthe natural frequency distribution, which has been assumed to be symmetric in\nmany previous studies. The asymmetry brings two nonstandard bifurcation\ndiagrams, with the aid of bimodality. The first diagram consists of stationary\nstates, and has the standard continuous synchronization transition and a\nsubsequent discontinuous transition as the coupling strength increases. Such a\nbifurcation diagram has been also reported in a variant model, which breaks the\nodd symmetry of the coupling function by introducing the phase lag. The second\ndiagram includes the oscillatory state emerging from the partially synchronized\nstate and followed by a discontinuous transition. This diagram is firstly\nrevealed in this study. The two bifurcation diagrams are obtained by employing\nthe Ott-Antonsen ansatz, and are verified by direct $N$-body simulations. We\nconclude that the asymmetry in distribution, with the bimodality, plays a\nsimilar role to the phase lag, and diversifies the transitions.\n", "  Previously, graphene nanoribbons set in lateral heterostructures with\nhexagonal boron nitride were predicted to support topologically protected\nstates at low energy. We investigate how robust the transport properties of\nthese states are against lattice disorder. We find that forms of disorder that\ndo not couple the two valleys of the zigzag graphene nanoribbon do not impact\nthe transport properties at low bias, indicating that these lateral\nheterostructures are very promising candidates for chip-scale conducting\ninterconnects. Forms of disorder that do couple the two valleys, such as\nvacancies in the graphene ribbon, or substantial inclusions of armchair edges\nat the graphene-hexagonal boron nitride interface will negatively affect the\ntransport. However, these forms of disorder are not commonly seen in current\nexperiments.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the morphology of a thin nematic film adsorbed\nat flat substrate patterned by stripes with alternating aligning properties,\nnormal and tangential respectively. We construct a simple \"exactly-solvable\"\neffective interfacial model where the liquid crystal distortions are accounted\nfor via an effective interface potential. We find that chemically patterned\nsubstrates can strongly deform the nematic-air interface. The amplitude of this\nsubstrate-induced undulations increases with decreasing average film thickness\nand with increasing surface pattern pitch. We find a regime where the\ninterfacial deformation may be described in terms of a material-independent\nuniversal scaling function. Surprisingly, the predictions of the effective\ninterfacial model agree semi-quantitatively with the results of the numerical\nsolution of a full model based on the Landau-de Gennes theory coupled to a\nsquare-gradient phase field free energy functional for a two phase system.\n", "  Fiber-fed multi-object spectroscopic surveys, with their ability to collect\nan unprecedented number of redshifts, currently dominate large-scale structure\nstudies. However, physical constraints limit these surveys from successfully\ncollecting redshifts from galaxies too close to each other on the focal plane.\nThis ultimately leads to significant systematic effects on galaxy clustering\nmeasurements. Using simulated mock catalogs, we demonstrate that fiber\ncollisions have a significant impact on the power spectrum, $P(k)$, monopole\nand quadrupole that exceeds sample variance at scales smaller than\n$k\\sim0.1~h/Mpc$.\n  We present two methods to account for fiber collisions in the power spectrum.\nThe first, statistically reconstructs the clustering of fiber collided galaxy\npairs by modeling the distribution of the line-of-sight displacements between\nthem. It also properly accounts for fiber collisions in the shot-noise\ncorrection term of the $P(k)$ estimator. Using this method, we recover the true\n$P(k)$ monopole of the mock catalogs with residuals of $<0.5\\%$ at\n$k=0.3~h/Mpc$ and $<4\\%$ at $k=0.83~h/Mpc$ -- a significant improvement over\nexisting correction methods. The quadrupole, however, does not improve\nsignificantly.\n  The second method models the effect of fiber collisions on the power spectrum\nas a convolution with a configuration space top-hat function that depends on\nthe physical scale of fiber collisions. It directly computes theoretical\npredictions of the fiber-collided $P(k)$ multipoles and reduces the influence\nof smaller scales to a set of nuisance parameters. Using this method, we\nreliably model the effect of fiber collisions on the monopole and quadrupole\ndown to the scale limits of theoretical predictions. The methods we present in\nthis paper will allow us to robustly analyze galaxy power spectrum multipole\nmeasurements to much smaller scales than previously possible.\n", "  In the next few years, intensity-mapping surveys that target lines such as\nCO, Ly$\\alpha$, and CII stand to provide powerful probes of high-redshift\nastrophysics. However, these line emissions are highly non-Gaussian, and so the\ntypical power-spectrum methods used to study these maps will leave out a\nsignificant amount of information. We propose a new statistic, the probability\ndistribution of voxel intensities, which can access this extra information.\nUsing a model of a CO intensity map at $z\\sim3$ as an example, we demonstrate\nthat this voxel intensity distribution (VID) provides substantial constraining\npower beyond what is obtainable from the power spectrum alone. We find that a\nfuture survey similar to the planned COMAP Full experiment could constrain the\nCO luminosity function to order $\\sim10\\%$. We also explore the effects of\ncontamination from continuum emission, interloper lines, and gravitational\nlensing on our constraints and find that the VID statistic retains significant\nconstraining power even in pessimistic scenarios.\n", "  Morphological characteristics of the vertically thick inner bar components\nare studied. At high galaxy inclinations they manifest as Boxy/Peanut/X-shape\nfeatures, and near to face-on view as barlenses. Using the Spitzer Survey of\nStellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and the Near-IR S0 galaxy Survey (NIRS0S),\nwe compared the properties of 88 X-shape features, 85 barlenses, and the\nphotometric bulges of 41 non-barred galaxies. Sizes and minor-to-major axis\nratios (b/a) of these structures are compared, and interpreted by means of\nsynthetic images using N-body simulation models. Barlenses and their parent\ngalaxies are also divided into different sub-groups. The synthetic images are\nanalyzed in a similar manner as the observations. This is the first time that\nthe observed properties of barlenses and X-shape features are compared, over a\nlarge range of galaxy inclinations. Our analysis are consistent with the idea\nthat barlenses and X-shape features are physically the same phenomenon.\nHowever, which of the two features is observed depends, not only on galaxy\ninclination, but also on its central flux concentration. The observed nearly\nround face-on barlens morphology is expected when at least a few percents of\nthe disk mass is in a central component, within a region much smaller than the\nsize of the barlens itself. We also discuss that the large range of stellar\npopulation ages obtained for the photometric bulges in the literature, are\nconsistent with our interpretation.\n", "  Quantum metrology utilizes nonclassical resources, such as entanglement or\nsqueezed light, to realize sensors whose performance exceeds that afforded by\nclassical-state systems. Environmental loss and noise, however, easily destroy\nnonclassical resources, and thus nullify the performance advantages of most\nquantum-enhanced sensors. Quantum illumination (QI) is different. It is a\nrobust entanglement-enhanced sensing scheme whose 6 dB performance advantage\nover a coherent-state sensor of the same average transmitted photon number\nsurvives the initial entanglement's eradication by loss and noise.\nUnfortunately, an implementation of the optimum quantum receiver that would\nreap QI's full performance advantage has remained elusive, owing to its having\nto deal with a huge number of very noisy optical modes. We show how\nsum-frequency generation (SFG) can be fruitfully applied to optimum multi-mode\nGaussian-mixed-state discrimination. Applied to QI, our analysis and numerical\nevaluations demonstrate that our SFG receiver saturates QI's quantum Chernoff\nbound. Moreover, augmenting our SFG receiver with a feed-forward (FF) mechanism\npushes its performance to the Helstrom bound in the limit of low signal\nbrightness. The FF-SFG receiver thus opens the door to optimum quantum-enhanced\nimaging, radar detection, state and channel tomography, and communication in\npractical Gaussian-state situations.\n", "  The idea we advocate in this paper is that the one-loop effective action of a\nfree (massive) field theory coupled to external sources (via conserved\ncurrents) contains complete information about the classical dynamics of such\nsources. We show many explicit examples of this fact for (scalar and fermion)\nfree field theories in various dimensions $d=3,4,5,6$ coupled to (bosonic,\ncompletely symmetric) sources with a number of spins. In some cases we also\nprovide compact formulas for any dimension. This paper is devoted to two-point\ncorrelators, so the one-loop effective action we construct contains only the\nquadratic terms and the relevant equations of motion for the sources we obtain\nare the linearized ones.\n", "  Suppression of H2-cooling in early protogalaxies has important implications\nfor the formation of supermassive black holes seeds, the first generation of\nstars, and the epoch of reionization. This suppression can occur via\nphotodissociation of H2 (by ultraviolet Lyman-Werner [LW] photons) or by\nphotodetachment of H-, a precursor in H2 formation (by infrared [IR] photons).\nPrevious studies have typically adopted idealised spectra, with a blackbody or\na power-law shape, in modeling the chemistry of metal-free protogalaxies, and\nutilised a single parameter, the critical UV flux, or Jcrit, to determine\nwhether H2-cooling is prevented. This can be misleading, and that independent\nof the spectral shape, there is a critical curve in the (kLW , kH^- ) plane,\nwhere kLW and kH^- are the H2-dissocation rates by LW and IR photons, which\ndetermines whether a protogalaxy can cool below ~1000 Kelvin. We use a one-zone\nmodel to follow the chemical and thermal evolution of gravitationally\ncollapsing protogalactic gas, to compute this critical curve, and provide an\naccurate analytical fit for it. We improve on previous works by considering a\nvariety of more realistic Pop III or Pop II-type spectra from population\nsynthesis models and perform fully frequency-dependent calculations of the\nH2-photodissociation rates for each spectrum. We compute the ratio kLW/kH^- for\neach spectrum, as well as the minimum stellar mass M_star, for various IMFs and\nmetallicities, required to prevent cooling in a neighboring halo a distance d\naway. We provide critical M_star/d2 values for suppression of H2-cooling, with\nanalytic fits, which can be used in future studies.\n", "  Pulsar-timing datasets have been analyzed with great success using\nprobabilistic treatments based on Gaussian distributions, with applications\nranging from studies of neutron-star structure to tests of general relativity\nand searches for nanosecond gravitational waves. As for other applications of\nGaussian distributions, outliers in timing measurements pose a significant\nchallenge to statistical inference, since they can bias the estimation of\ntiming and noise parameters, and affect reported parameter uncertainties. We\ndescribe and demonstrate a practical end-to-end approach to perform Bayesian\ninference of timing and noise parameters robustly in the presence of outliers,\nand to identify these probabilistically. The method is fully consistent (i.e.,\noutlier-ness probabilities vary in tune with the posterior distributions of the\ntiming and noise parameters), and it relies on the efficient sampling of the\nhierarchical form of the pulsar-timing likelihood. Such sampling has recently\nbecome possible with a \"no-U-turn\" Hamiltonian sampler coupled to a highly\ncustomized reparametrization of the likelihood; this code is described\nelsewhere, but it is already available online. We recommend our method as a\nstandard step in the preparation of pulsar-timing-array datasets: even if\nstatistical inference is not affected, follow-up studies of outlier candidates\ncan reveal unseen problems in radio observations and timing measurements;\nfurthermore, confidence in the results of gravitational-wave searches will only\nbenefit from stringent statistical evidence that datasets are clean and\noutlier-free.\n", "  In many nonlinear field theories, relevant solutions may be found by reducing\nthe order of the original Euler-Lagrange equations, e.g., to first order\nequations (Bogomolnyi equations, self-duality equations, etc.). Here we\ngeneralise, further develop and apply one particular method for the order\nreduction of nonlinear field equations which, despite its systematic and\nversatile character, is not widely known.\n", "  We investigated a possible use of the magnonic interferometric switches in\nmulti-valued logic circuits. The switch is a three-terminal device consisting\nof two spin channels where input, control, and output signals are spin waves.\nSignal modulation is achieved via the interference between the source and gate\nspin waves. We report experimental data on a micrometer scale prototype based\non Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 structure. The output characteristics are measured at different\nangles of the bias magnetic field. The On/Off ratio of the prototype exceeds 36\ndB at room temperature. Experimental data is complemented by the theoretical\nanalysis and the results of micro magnetic simulations showing spin wave\npropagation in a micrometer size magnetic junction. We also present the results\nof numerical modeling illustrating the operation of a nanometer-size switch\nconsisting of just 20 spins in the source-drain channel. The utilization of\nspin wave interference as a switching mechanism makes it possible to build\nnanometer-scale logic gates, and minimize energy per operation, which is\nlimited only by the noise margin. The utilization of phase in addition to\namplitude for information encoding offers an innovative route towards\nmulti-state logic circuits. We describe possible implementation of the\nthree-value logic circuits based on the magnonic interferometric switches. The\nadvantages and shortcomings inherent in interferometric switches are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Presented is a quantum lattice gas algorithm to efficiently model a system of\nDirac particles interacting through an intermediary gauge field. The algorithm\nuses a fixed qubit array to represent both the spacetime and the particles\ncontained in the spacetime. Despite being a lattice based algorithm, Lorentz\ninvariance is preserved down to the grid scale, with the continuum Dirac\nHamiltonian generating the local unitary evolution even at that scale: there is\nnonlinear scaling between the smallest observable time and that time measured\nin the quantum field theory limit, a kind of time dilation effect that emerges\non small scales but has no effect on large scales. The quantum lattice gas\nalgorithm correctly accounts for the anticommutative braiding of\nindistinguishable fermions---it does not suffer the Fermi-sign problem. It\nprovides a highly convergent numerical simulation for strongly-correlated\nfermions equal to a covariant path integral, presented here for the case when a\nDirac particle's Compton wavelength is large compared to the grid scale of the\nqubit array.\n", "  We theoretically study a strongly-driven optomechanical system which consists\nof a passive optical cavity and an active mechanical resonator. When the\noptomechanical coupling strength is varied, phase transitions, which are\nsimilar those observed in $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems, are observed. We\nshow that the optical transmission can be controlled by changing the gain of\nthe mechanical resonator and loss of the optical cavity mode. Especially, we\nfind that: (i) for balanced gain and loss, optical amplification and absorption\ncan be tuned by changing the optomechanical coupling strength through a control\nfield; (ii) for unbalanced gain and loss, even with a tiny mechanical gain,\nboth optomechanically-induced transparency and anomalous dispersion can be\nobserved around a critical point, which exhibits an ultra-long group delay. The\ntime delay $\\tau$ can be optimized by regulating the optomechanical coupling\nstrength through the control field and improved up to several orders of\nmagnitude ($\\tau\\sim2$ $\\mathrm{ms}$) compared to that of conventional\noptomechanical systems ($\\tau\\sim1$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$). The presence of\nmechanical gain makes the group delay more robust to environmental\nperturbations. Our proposal provides a powerful platform to control light\ntransport using a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric-like optomechanical system.\n", "  We propose a self-consistent quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA)\nplus quasi-particle-vibration coupling (QPVC) model with Skyrme interactions to\ndescribe the width and the line shape of giant resonances in open-shell nuclei,\nin which the effect of superfluidity should be taken into account in both the\nground state and the excited states. We apply the new model to the Gamow-Teller\nresonance in the superfluid nucleus $^{120}$Sn, including both the isoscalar\nspin-triplet and the isovector spin-singlet pairing interactions. The strength\ndistribution in $^{120}$Sn is well reproduced and the underlying microscopic\nmechanisms, related to QPVC and also to isoscalar pairing, are analyzed in\ndetail.\n", "  We analyze interstellar absorption features in the full UV spectrum of the\nnearby (d = 24 pc) B8 IVn star alpha Leo (Regulus) obtained at high resolution\nand high S/N by the HST ASTRAL Treasury program. We derive column densities for\nmany key atomic species and interpret their partial ionizations. The gas in\nfront of alpha Leo exhibits two absorption components, one of which coincides\nin velocity with the local interstellar cloud (LIC) that surrounds the Sun. The\nsecond, smaller, component is shifted by +5.6 km/s relative to the main\ncomponent, in agreement with results for other lines of sight in this region of\nthe sky. The excitation of the C II fine-structure levels and the ratio of Mg I\nto Mg II reveal a temperature T = 6500 (+750,-600)K and electron density n(e) =\n0.11 (+0.025,-0.03) cm^-3. Our investigation of the ionization balance of all\nthe available species indicates that about 1/3 of the hydrogen atoms are\nionized and that metals are significantly depleted onto grains. We infer that\nN(H I) = 1.9 (+0.9,-0.6) X 10^{18} cm^-2, which indicates that this partly\nneutral gas occupies only 2 to 8 pc (about 13%) of the space toward the star,\nwith the remaining volume presumably being filled with a hot gas that emits\nsoft X-rays. We do not detect any absorption features from the highly ionized\nspecies that could be produced in an interface between the warm medium and the\nsurrounding hot gas. Finally, the radial velocity of the LIC agrees with that\nof the Local Leo Cold Cloud, indicating that they may be physically related.\n", "  We study the strange vector meson ($K^*, \\bar K^*$) dynamics in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics\n(PHSD) transport approach which incorporates partonic and hadronic\ndegrees-of-freedom, a phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter -\nQuark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) - and a dynamical hadronization of quarks and\nantiquarks as well as final hadronic interactions. We investigate the role of\nin-medium effects on the $K^*, \\bar K^*$ meson dynamics by employing\nBreit-Wigner spectral functions for the $K^*$'s with self-energies obtained\nfrom a self-consistent coupled-channel G-matrix approach. Furthermore, we\nconfront the PHSD calculations with experimental data for p+p, Cu+Cu and Au+Au\ncollisions at energies up to $\\sqrt{{s}_{NN}} = 200$~GeV. Our analysis shows\nthat at relativistic energies most of the final $K^*$s (observed\nexperimentally) are produced during the late hadronic phase, dominantly by the\n$K+ \\pi \\to K^*$ channel, such that the fraction of the $K^*$s from the QGP is\nsmall and can hardly be reconstructed from the final observables. The influence\nof the in-medium effects on the $K^*$ dynamics at RHIC energies is rather\nmodest due to their dominant production at low baryon densities (but high meson\ndensities), however, it increases with decreasing beam energy. Moreover, we\nfind that the additional cut on the invariant mass region of the $K^*$ further\ninfluences the shape and the height of the final spectra. This imposes severe\nconstraints on the interpretation of the experimental results.\n", "  Experimental results on azimuthal correlations in high energy nuclear\ncollisions (nucleus-nucleus, proton-nucleus and proton-proton) seem to be well\ndescribed by viscous hydrodynamics. It is often argued that this agreement\nimplies either local thermal equilibrium or at least local isotropy. In this\nnote, I present arguments why this is not the case. Neither local\nnear-equilibrium nor near-isotropy are required in order for hydrodynamics to\noffer a successful and accurate description of experimental results. However, I\npredict the breakdown of hydrodynamics at momenta of order seven times the\ntemperature, corresponding to a smallest possible QCD liquid drop size of 0.15\nfm.\n", "  It has recently been demonstrated that the dynamics of black holes at large\n$D$ can be recast as a set of non gravitational membrane equations. These\nmembrane equations admit a simple static solution with shape $S^{D-p-2} \\times\nR^{p,1}$. In this note we study the equations for small fluctuations about this\nsolution in a limit in which amplitude and length scale of the fluctuations are\nsimultaneously scaled to zero as $D$ is taken to infinity. We demonstrate that\nthe resultant nonlinear equations, which capture the Gregory- Laflamme\ninstability and its end point, exactly agree with the effective dynamical\n`black brane' equations of Emparan Suzuki and Tanabe. Our results thus identify\nthe `black brane' equations as a special limit of the membrane equations and so\nunify these approaches to large $D$ black hole dynamics.\n", "  Fluctuations of the surface brightness of cosmic X-ray background (CXB) carry\nunique information about faint and low luminosity source populations, which is\ninaccessible for conventional large-scale structure (LSS) studies based on\nresolved sources. We used Chandra data of the XBOOTES field\n($\\sim9\\,\\mathrm{deg^2}$) to conduct the most accurate measurement to date of\nthe power spectrum of fluctuations of the unresolved CXB on the angular scales\nof $\\sim3\\,$arcsec $-$ $\\sim17\\,$arcmin. We find that at sub-arcmin angular\nscales, the power spectrum is consistent with the AGN shot noise, without much\nneed for any significant contribution from their one-halo term. This is\nconsistent with the theoretical expectation that low-luminosity AGN reside\nalone in their dark matter halos. However, at larger angular scales we detect a\nsignificant LSS signal above the AGN shot noise. Its power spectrum, obtained\nafter subtracting the AGN shot noise, follows a power law with the slope of\n$-0.8\\pm0.1$ and its amplitude is much larger than what can be plausibly\nexplained by the two-halo term of AGN. We demonstrate that the detected LSS\nsignal is produced by unresolved clusters and groups of galaxies. For the flux\nlimit of the XBOOTES survey, their flux-weighted mean redshift equals\n$\\left<z\\right>\\sim0.3$, and the mean temperature of their intracluster medium\n(ICM), $\\left<T\\right>\\approx 1.4$ keV, corresponds to the mass of $M_{500}\n\\sim 10^{13.5}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. The power spectrum of CXB fluctuations\ncarries information about the redshift distribution of these objects and the\nspatial structure of their ICM on the linear scales of up to $\\sim$Mpc, i.e. of\nthe order of the virial radius.\n", "  We observe spin squeezing in three-component Bose gases where all three\nhyperfine states are coupled by synthetic spin-orbit coupling. This phenomenon\nis a direct consequence of spin-orbit coupling, as can be seen clearly from an\neffective spin Hamiltonian. By solving this effective model analytically with\nthe aid of a Holstein-Primakoff transformation for spin-1 system in the low\nexcitation limit, we conclude that the spin-nematic squeezing, a novel category\nof spin squeezing existing exclusively in large spin systems, is enhanced with\nincreasing spin-orbit intensity and effective Zeeman field, which correspond to\nRabi frequency and two-photon detuning within the Raman scheme for synthetic\nspin-orbit coupling, respectively. These trends of dependence are in clear\ncontrast to spin-orbit coupling induced spin squeezing in spin-1/2 systems. We\nalso analyze the effects of harmonic trap and interaction with realistic\nexperimental parameters numerically, and find that a strong harmonic trap\nfavors spin-nematic squeezing. We further show spin-nematic squeezing can be\ninterpreted as two-mode entanglement or two-spin squeezing at low excitation.\nOur findings can be observed in ^{87}Rb gases with existing techniques of\nsynthetic spin-orbit coupling and spin-selectively imaging.\n", "  Observations by the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array of the 358\nGHz continuum emission of the gravitationally lensed quasar host RX\nJ0911.4+0551 have been analysed. They complement earlier Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer observations of the CO(7-6) emission. The good knowledge of the\nlensing potential obtained from Hubble Space Telescope observations of the\nquasar makes a joint analysis of the three emissions possible. It gives\nevidence for the quasar source to be concentric with the continuum source\nwithin 0.31 kpc and with the CO(7-6) source within 1.10 kpc. It also provides a\nmeasurement of the size of the continuum source, 0.76 $\\pm$ 0.04 kpc FWHM,\nmaking RX J0911.4+0551 one of the few high redshift galaxies for which the dust\nand gas components are resolved with dimensions being measured. Both are found\nto be very compact, the former being smaller than the latter by a factor of\n$\\sim$3.4$\\pm$0.4. Moreover, new measurements of the CO ladder $-$ CO(10-9) and\nCO(11-10) $-$ are presented that confirm the extreme narrowness of the CO line\nwidth (107$\\pm$20 km s$^{-1}$ on average). Their mere detection implies higher\ntemperature and/or density than for typical quasar hosts at this redshift and\nsuggests a possible contribution of the central AGN to gas and dust heating.\nThe results are interpreted in terms of current understanding of galaxy\nevolution at the peak of star formation. They suggest that RX J0911.4+0551 is a\nyoung galaxy in an early stage of its evolution, having experienced no recent\nmajor mergers, star formation being concentrated in its centre.\n", "  Scale invariant fluctuations of metric are universal feature of quantum\ngravity in de Sitter spacetime. We construct an effective Lagrangian which\nsummarizes their implications on local physics by integrating super-horizon\nmetric fluctuations. It shows infrared quantum effects are local and render\nfundamental couplings time dependent. We impose Lorenz invariance on the\neffective Lagrangian as it is required by the principle of general covariance.\nWe show that such a requirement leads to unique physical predictions by fixing\nthe quantization ambiguities. We explain how the gauge parameter dependence of\nobservables is canceled. In particular the relative evolution speed of the\ncouplings are shown to be gauge invariant.\n", "  We clarify the relation between various approaches to the manifestly\nT-duality symmetric string. We explain in detail how the PST covariant doubled\nstring arises from an unusual gauge fixing. We pay careful attention to the\nrole of \"spectator\" fields in this process and also show how the T-duality\ninvariant doubled dilaton emerges naturally. We extend these ideas to\nnon-Abelian T-duality and show they give rise to the duality invariant\nformalism based on the semi-Abelian Drinfeld Double. We then develop the\nN=(0,1) supersymmetric duality invariant formalism.\n", "  We present new compact integrated expressions of QCD spectral functions of\nheavy-light molecules and four-quark $XYZ$-like states at lowest order (LO) of\nperturbative (PT) QCD and up to $d=8$ condensates of the Operator Product\nExpansion (OPE). Then, by including up to next-to-next leading order (N2LO) PT\nQCD corrections, which we have estimated by assuming the factorization of the\nfour-quark spectral functions, we improve previous LO results from QCD spectral\nsum rules (QSSR), on the $XYZ$-like masses and decay constants which suffer\nfrom the ill-defined heavy quark mass. PT N3LO corrections are estimated using\na geometric growth of the PT series and are included in the systematic errors.\nOur optimal results based on stability criteria are summarized in Tables 11 to\n14 and compared, in Section 10, with experimental candidates and some LO QSSR\nresults. We conclude that the masses of the $XZ$ observed states are compatible\nwith (almost) pure $J^{PC}=1^{+\\pm}, 0^{++}$ molecule or/and four-quark states.\nThe ones of the $1^{-\\pm}, 0^{-\\pm}$ molecule / four-quark states are about 1.5\nGeV above the $Y_{c,b}$ mesons experimental candidates and hadronic thresholds.\nWe also find that the couplings of these exotics to the associated\ninterpolating currents are weaker than that of ordinary $D,B$ mesons\n($f_{DD}\\approx 10^{-3}f_D$) and may behave numerically as $1/ \\bar m_b^{3/2}$\n(resp. $1/ \\bar m_b$) for the $1^{+},0^{+}$ (resp. $1^{-}, 0^{-}$) states which\ncan stimulate further theoretical studies of these decay constants.\n", "  A Bayesian model to infer edge electron density profiles is developed for the\nJET lithium beam emission spectroscopy system, measuring Li I line radiation\nusing 26 channels with ~1 cm spatial resolution and 10~20 ms temporal\nresolution. The density profile is modelled using a Gaussian process prior, and\nthe uncertainty of the density profile is calculated by a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) scheme. From the spectra measured by the transmission grating\nspectrometer, the Li line intensities are extracted, and modelled as a function\nof the plasma density by a multi-state model which describes the relevant\nprocesses between neutral lithium beam atoms and plasma particles. The spectral\nmodel fully takes into account interference filter and instrument effects, that\nare separately estimated, again using Gaussian processes. The line intensities\nare inferred based on a spectral model consistent with the measured spectra\nwithin their uncertainties, which includes photon statistics and electronic\nnoise. Our newly developed method to infer JET edge electron density profiles\nhas the following advantages in comparison to the conventional method: i)\nproviding full posterior distributions of edge density profiles, including\ntheir associated uncertainties, ii) the available radial range for density\nprofiles is increased to the full observation range (~26 cm), iii) an\nassumption of monotonic electron density profile is not necessary, iv) the\nabsolute calibration factor of the diagnostic system is automatically estimated\novercoming the limitation of the conventional technique and allowing us to\ninfer the electron density profiles for all pulses without preprocessing the\ndata or an additional boundary condition, and v) since the full spectrum is\nmodelled, the procedure of modulating the beam to measure the background signal\nis only necessary for the case of overlapping of the Li line with impurity\nlines.\n", "  Poincare' covariant definitions for the spin-dependent spectral function and\nfor the momentum distributions within the light-front Hamiltonian dynamics are\nproposed for a three-fermion bound system, starting from the light-front wave\nfunction of the system. The adopted approach is based on the Bakamjian-Thomas\nconstruction of the Poincare' generators, that allows one to easily import the\nfamiliar and wide knowledge on the nuclear interaction into a light-front\nframework. The proposed formalism can find useful applications in refined\nnuclear calculations, like the ones needed for evaluating the EMC effect or the\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic cross sections with polarized nuclear targets,\nsince remarkably the light-front unpolarized momentum distribution by\ndefinition fulfills both normalization and momentum sum rules. It is also shown\na straightforward generalization of the definition of the light-front spectral\nfunction to an A-nucleon system.\n", "  We study the $\\chi_{c1} \\to \\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decay, paying attention to the\nproduction of $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ from the final state\ninteraction of pairs of mesons that can lead to these three mesons in the final\nstate, which is implemented using the chiral unitary approach. Very clean and\nstrong signals are obtained for the $a_0(980)$ excitation in the $\\eta \\pi$\ninvariant mass distribution and for the $f_0(500)$ in the $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ mass\ndistribution. A smaller, but also clear signal for the $f_0(980)$ excitation is\nobtained. The results are contrasted with experimental data and the agreement\nfound is good, providing yet one more test in support of the picture where\nthese resonances are dynamically generated from the meson-meson interaction.\n", "  We perform a combined analysis of recent NEOS and Daya Bay data on the\nreactor antineutrino spectrum. This analysis includes approximately 1.5 million\nantineutrino events, which is the largest neutrino event sample analyzed to\ndate. We use a double ratio which cancels flux model dependence and related\nuncertainties as well as the effects of the detector response model. We find at\n3-4 standard deviation significance level, that plutonium-239 and plutonium-241\nare disfavored as the single source for the the so-called 5 MeV bump. This\nanalysis method has general applicability and in particular with higher\nstatistics data sets will be able to shed significant light on the issue of the\nbump. With some caveat this also should allow to improve the sensitivity for\nsterile neutrino searches in NEOS.\n", "  We develop the notion of entwinement to characterize the amount of quantum\nentanglement between internal, discretely gauged degrees of freedom in a\nquantum field theory. This concept originated in the program of reconstructing\nspacetime from entanglement in holographic duality. We define entwinement\nformally in terms of a novel replica method which uses twist operators charged\nin a representation of the discrete gauge group. In terms of these twist\noperators we define a non-local, gauge-invariant object whose expectation value\ncomputes entwinement in a standard replica limit. We apply our method to the\ncomputation of entwinement in symmetric orbifold conformal field theories in\n1+1 dimensions, which have an $S_N$ gauging. Such a theory appears in the weak\ncoupling limit of the D1-D5 string theory which is dual to AdS$_3$ at strong\ncoupling. In this context, we show how certain kinds of entwinement measure the\nlengths, in units of the AdS scale, of non-minimal geodesics present in certain\nexcited states of the system which are gravitationally described as conical\ndefects and the $M=0$ BTZ black hole. The possible types of entwinement that\ncan be computed define a very large new class of quantities characterizing the\nfine structure of quantum wavefunctions.\n", "  We expand on the recent derivation of 3d dualities using bosonization. We\npresent in some detail a general class of Abelian duals.\n", "  We demonstrate that Chromo-Natural Inflation can be made consistent with\nobservational data if the SU(2) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. Working\nin the Stueckelberg limit, we show that isocurvature is negligible, and the\nresulting adiabatic fluctuations can match current observational constraints.\nObservable levels of chirally-polarized gravitational radiation ($r\\sim\n10^{-3}$) can be produced while the evolution of all background fields is\nsub-Planckian. The gravitational wave spectrum is amplified via linear mixing\nwith the gauge field fluctuations, and its amplitude is not simply set by the\nHubble rate during inflation. This allows observable gravitational waves to be\nproduced for an inflationary energy scale below the GUT scale. The tilt of the\nresulting gravitational wave spectrum can be either blue or red.\n", "  We introduce the concept of network susceptibilities quantifying the response\nof the collective dy- namics of a network to small parameter changes. We\ndistinguish two types of susceptibilities: vertex susceptibilities and edge\nsusceptibilities, measuring the responses due to changes in the properties of\nunits and their interactions, respectively. We derive explicit forms of network\nsusceptibilities for oscillator networks close to steady states and offer\nexample applications for Kuramoto-type phase- oscillator models, power grid\nmodels and generic flow models. Focusing on the role of the network topology\nimplies that these ideas can be easily generalized to other types of networks,\nin particular those characterizing flow, transport, or spreading phenomena. The\nconcept of network susceptibil- ities is broadly applicable and may\nstraightforwardly be transferred to all settings where networks responses of\nthe collective dynamics to topological changes are essential.\n", "  Correlations between stellar chemistry and kinematics have long been used to\ngain insight into the evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy. Orbital angular\nmomentum is a key physical parameter and it is often estimated from\nthree-dimensional space motions. We here demonstrate the lower uncertainties\nthat can be achieved in the estimation of one component of velocity through\nselection of stars in key directions and use of line-of-sight velocity alone\n(i.e. without incorporation of proper motion data). In this first paper we\napply our technique to stars observed in the direction of Galactic rotation in\nthe APOGEE survey. We first derive the distribution of azimuthal velocities,\n$v_\\phi$, then from these and observed radial coordinates, estimate the stellar\nguiding centre radii, $R_g$, within $6.9\\leq R \\leq 10$ kpc with uncertainties\nsmaller than (or of the order of) 1kpc. We show that there is no simple way to\nselect a clean stellar sample based on low errors on proper motions and\ndistances to obtain high-quality 3D velocities and hence one should pay\nparticular attention when trying to identify kinematically peculiar stars based\non velocities derived using the proper motions. Using our azimuthal velocity\nestimations, we investigate the joint distribution of elemental abundances and\nrotational kinematics free from the blurring effects of epicyclic motions, and\nwe derive the $\\partial v_\\phi / \\partial R_g$ trends for the thin and thick\ndiscs as a function of radius. Our analysis provides further evidence for\nradial migration within the thin disc and hints against radial migration\nplaying a significant role in the evolution of the thick disc.\n", "  Motivated by numerous experiments on Bose-Einstein condensed atoms which have\nbeen performed in tight trapping potentials of various geometries (elongated\nand/or toroidal/annular), we develop a general method which allows us to reduce\nthe corresponding three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the order\nparameter into an effectively one-dimensional equation, taking into account the\ninteractions (i.e., treating the width of the transverse profile variationally)\nand the curvature of the trapping potential. As an application of our model we\nconsider atoms which rotate in a toroidal trapping potential. We evaluate the\nstate of lowest energy for a fixed value of the angular momentum within various\napproximations of the effectively one-dimensional model and compare our results\nwith the full solution of the three-dimensional problem, thus getting evidence\nfor the accuracy of our model.\n", "  We renormalize the SU(N) Gross-Neveu model in the modified minimal\nsubtraction (MSbar) scheme at four loops and determine the beta-function at\nthis order. The theory ceases to be multiplicatively renormalizable when\ndimensionally regularized due to the generation of evanescent 4-fermi\noperators. The first of these appears at three loops and we correctly take\ntheir effect into account in deriving the renormalization group functions. We\nuse the results to provide estimates of critical exponents relevant to phase\ntransitions in graphene.\n", "  Thermal fluctuations of the Josephson current $I$ induced by the magnetic\nflux through a ring of $N$ superconducting grains are studied. When a\nhalf-fluxon is threading the ring, $I$ exhibits incoherent transitions between\nthe two degenerate states due to thermal phase slips. We propose a new\nnumerical method to deal with both equilibrium and dynamic properties of\nJosephson systems. Computed transition rate has the form $\\Gamma =\nA(N)\\exp[-B(N)/T]$, where $B(N)$ agrees with the analytical result derived for\nthe energy barrier associated with phase slips. In the non-degenerate case\n(e.g., at a quarter-fluxon) the equilibrium value of $I$ decreases with $T$ due\nto harmonic excitations and then gets destroyed by phase slips.\n", "  We report ghost imaging of a single non-reproducible temporal signal in the\nrange of tens kHz by using pseudo-thermal speckle light patterns and a single\ndetector array with a million of pixels working without any temporal\nresolution. A set of speckle patterns is generated deterministically at\nradio-frequency rate, multiplied by the temporal signal and time integrated in\na single shot by the camera. The temporal information is retrieved by computing\nthe spatial intensity correlations between this time integrated image and each\nspeckle pattern of the set.\n", "  We consider a 5-dimensional model with geometry ${\\cal M} = {\\cal M}_4 \\times\n{\\cal S}_1$, with compactification radius $R$. The Standard Model particles are\nlocalized onto a brane located at y=0, with identical branes localized at\ndifferent points in the extra dimension. Objects located on our brane can orbit\naround objects located on a brane at a distance $d=y/R$, with an orbit and a\nperiod significantly different from the standard Newtonian ones. We study the\nkinematical properties of the orbits, finding that it is possible to\ndistinguish one motion from the other in a large region of the initial\nconditions parameter space. This is a warm-up to study if a SM-like mass\ndistribution on one (or more) distant brane(s) may represent a possible dark\nmatter candidate. After using the same technique to the study of orbits of\nobjects lying on the same brane ($d=0$), we apply this method to detect generic\ndeviations from the inverse-square Newton's law. We propose a possible\nexperimental setup to look for departures from Newtonian motion in the\nmicro-world, finding that an order of magnitude improvement on present bounds\ncan be attained at the 95% CL under reasonable assumptions.\n", "  We report the design and characterization of an optical shutter based on a\npiezoelectric cantilever. Compared to conventional electro-magnetic shutters,\nthe device is intrinsically low power and acoustically quiet. The cantilever\nposition is controlled by a high-voltage op-amp circuit for easy tuning of the\nrange of travel, and mechanical slew rate, which enables a factor of 30\nreduction in mechanical noise compared to a rapidly switched device. We achieve\nshuttering rise and fall times of 11 $\\mu$s, corresponding to mechanical slew\nrates of 1.3 $\\textrm{ ms}^{-1}$, with an timing jitter of less than 1 $\\mu$s.\nWhen used to create optical pulses, we achieve minimum pulse durations of 250\n$\\mu$s. The reliability of the shutter was investigated by operating\ncontinuously for one week at 10 Hz switching rate. After this period, neither\nthe shutter delay or actuation speed had changed by a notable amount. We also\nshow that the high-voltage electronics can be easily configured as a versatile\nlow-noise, high-bandwidth piezo driver, well-suited to applications in laser\nfrequency control.\n", "  Graphene has an extremely high carrier mobility partly due to its planar\nmirror symmetry inhibiting scattering by the highly occupied acoustic flexural\nphonons. Electrostatic gating of a graphene device can break the planar mirror\nsymmetry yielding a coupling mechanism to the flexural phonons. We examine the\neffect of the gate-induced one-phonon scattering on the mobility for several\ngate geometries and dielectric environments using first-principles calculations\nbased on density functional theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann equation. We\ndemonstrate that this scattering mechanism can be a mobility-limiting factor,\nand show how the carrier density and temperature scaling of the mobility\ndepends on the electrostatic environment. Our findings may explain the high\ndeformation potential for in-plane acoustic phonons extracted from experiments\nand furthermore suggest a direct relation between device symmetry and resulting\nmobility.\n", "  It has been proven theoretically for bosons with two-body repulsive\ninteraction potentials in the dilute limit that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nprovides the exact energy and density per particle as does the basic\nmany-particle Schroedinger equation [Lieb and Seiringer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88,\n170409 (2002)]. Here, we investigate the overlap of the Gross-Pitaevskii and\nexact ground state wavefunctions. It is found that this overlap is always\nsmaller than unity and may even vanish in spite of the fact that both\nwavefunctions provide the same energy and density per particle. Consequences\nare discussed.\n", "  Warped string compactifications are central to many attempts to stabilize\nmoduli and connect string theory with cosmology and particle phenomenology. We\npresent a first-principles derivation of the low-energy 4D effective theory\nfrom dimensional reduction of a D3-brane in a warped Calabi-Yau\ncompactification of type IIB string theory with imaginary self-dual 3-form\nflux, including effects of D3-brane motion beyond the probe approximation, and\nfind the metric on the moduli space of brane positions, the universal volume\nmodulus, and axions descending from the 4-form potential. As D3-branes may be\nconsidered as carrying either electric or magnetic charges for the self-dual\n5-form field strength, we present calculations in both duality frames. Our\nresults are consistent with, but extend significantly, earlier results on the\nlow-energy effective theory arising from D3-branes in string compactifications.\n", "  This paper deals with tomographic image reconstruction under the situation\nwhere some of projection data bins are contaminated with abnormal data. Such\nsituations occur in various instances of tomography. We propose a new\nreconstruction algorithm called the Fault-Tolerant reconstruction outlined as\nfollows. The least-squares (L2-norm) error function ||Ax-b||_2^2 used in\nordinary iterative reconstructions is sensitive to the existence of abnormal\ndata. The proposed algorithm utilizes the L1-norm error function ||Ax-b||_1^1\ninstead of the L2-norm, and we develop a row-action-type iterative algorithm\nusing the proximal splitting framework in convex optimization fields. We also\npropose an improved version of the L1-norm reconstruction called the L1-TV\nreconstruction, in which a weak Total Variation (TV) penalty is added to the\ncost function. Simulation results demonstrate that reconstructed images with\nthe L2-norm were severely damaged by the effect of abnormal bins, whereas\nimages with the L1-norm and L1-TV reconstructions were robust to the existence\nof abnormal bins.\n", "  This paper concerns iterative reconstruction for low-dose and few-view CT by\nminimizing a data-fidelity term regularized with the Total Variation (TV)\npenalty. We propose a very fast iterative algorithm to solve this problem. The\nalgorithm derivation is outlined as follows. First, the original minimization\nproblem is reformulated into the saddle point (primal-dual) problem by using\nthe Lagrangian duality, to which we apply the first-order primal-dual iterative\nmethods. Second, we precondition the iteration formula using the ramp flter of\nFiltered Backprojection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm in such a way that the\nproblem solution is not altered. The resulting algorithm resembles the\nstructure of so-called iterative FBP algorithm, and it converges to the exact\nminimizer of cost function very fast.\n", "  We develop a see-saw model for neutrino masses and mixing with an S3\\times Z3\nsymmetry. It involves an interplay of Type-I and Type-II see-saw contributions\nof which the former is subdominant. The S3 \\times Z3 quantum numbers of the\nfermion and scalar fields are chosen such that the Type-II see-saw generates a\nmass matrix which incorporates the atmospheric mass splitting and sets\n\\theta_{23} = \\pi/4. The solar splitting and \\theta_{13} are absent, while the\nthird mixing angle can achieve any value, \\theta_{12}^0. Specific choices of\n\\theta_{12}^0 are of interest, e.g., 35.3^\\circ (tribimaximal), 45.0^\\circ\n(bimaximal), 31.7^\\circ (golden ratio), and 0^\\circ (no solar mixing). The role\nof the Type-I see-saw is to nudge all the above into the range indicated by the\ndata. The model results in novel interrelationships between these quantities\ndue to their common origin, making it readily falsifiable. For example, normal\n(inverted) ordering is associated with \\theta_{23} in the first (second)\noctant. CP-violation is controlled by phases in the right-handed neutrino\nMajorana mass matrix, M_{\\nu R}. In their absence, only normal ordering is\nadmissible. When M_{\\nu R} is complex the Dirac CP-phase, \\delta, can be large,\ni.e., \\sim \\pm \\pi/2, and inverted ordering is also allowed. The preliminary\nresults from T2K and NOVA which favour normal ordering and \\delta \\sim -\\pi/2\nare indicative, in this model, of a lightest neutrino mass of 0.05 eV or more.\n", "  We study the gluon distribution produced via successive medium-induced\nbranchings by an energetic jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon\nplasma. We show that under suitable approximations the evolution of the jet can\nbe described as a classical stochastic process, which is exactly solvable. For\nthis process, we construct exact analytic solutions for all the n-point\ncorrelation functions (the n-body densities in the space of energy). The\ncorresponding results for the one-point and the two-point functions were\nalready known, but those for the higher-point functions are new. These results\ndemonstrate strong correlations associated with the existence of common\nancestors in the branching process. By integrating these n-point functions over\nthe gluon energies, we deduce the mean gluon multiplicity $\\langle N\\rangle$ as\nwell as the higher moments $\\langle N^p\\rangle$ with $p\\ge 2$. We find that the\nmultiplicities of the soft gluons are parametrically large and show a\nremarkable regularity, known as Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling: the reduced\nmoments $\\langle N^p\\rangle/\\langle N\\rangle^p$ are pure numbers, independent\nof any of the physical parameters of the problem. We recognize a special\nnegative binomial distribution which is characterized by large statistical\nfluctuations. These predictions can be tested in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC,\nvia event-by-event measurements of the di-jet asymmetry.\n", "  We investigate the potential of using deep learning techniques to reject\nbackground events in searches for neutrinoless double beta decay with high\npressure xenon time projection chambers capable of detailed track\nreconstruction. The differences in the topological signatures of background and\nsignal events can be learned by deep neural networks via training over many\nthousands of events. These networks can then be used to classify further events\nas signal or background, providing an additional background rejection factor at\nan acceptable loss of efficiency. The networks trained in this study performed\nbetter than previous methods developed based on the use of the same topological\nsignatures by a factor of 1.2 to 1.6, and there is potential for further\nimprovement.\n", "  Assuming the existence of a field theory in D dimensions dual to\n(D+1)-dimensional flat space, governed by the asymptotic symmetries of flat\nspace, we make some preliminary remarks about the properties of this field\ntheory. We review briefly some successes of the 3d bulk - 2d boundary case and\nthen focus on the 4d bulk - 3d boundary example, where the symmetry in question\nis the infinite dimensional BMS4 algebra. We look at the constraints imposed by\nthis symmetry on a 3d field theory by constructing highest weight\nrepresentations of this algebra. We construct two and three point functions of\nBMS primary fields and surprisingly find that symmetries constrain these\ncorrelators to be identical to those of a 2d relativistic conformal field\ntheory. We then go one dimension higher and construct prototypical examples of\n4d field theories which are putative duals of 5d Minkowski spacetimes. These\nfield theories are ultra-relativistic limits of electrodynamics and Yang-Mills\ntheories which exhibit invariance under the conformal Carroll group in D=4. We\nexplore the different sectors within these Carrollian gauge theories and\ninvestigate the symmetries of the equations of motion to find that an infinite\nultra-relativistic conformal structure arises in each case.\n", "  Elitzur and Vaidman have proposed a measurement scheme that, based on the\nquantum superposition principle, allows one to detect the presence of an object\n--- in a dramatic scenario, a bomb --- without interacting with it. It was\npointed out by Ghirardi that this interaction-free measurement scheme can be\nput in direct relation with falsification tests of the macro-realistic\nworldview. Here we have implemented the \"bomb test\" with a single atom trapped\nin a spin-dependent optical lattice to show explicitly a violation of the\nLeggett-Garg inequality --- a quantitative criterion fulfilled by\nmacro-realistic physical theories. To perform interaction-free measurements, we\nhave implemented a novel measurement method that correlates spin and position\nof the atom. This method, which quantum mechanically entangles spin and\nposition, finds general application for spin measurements, thereby avoiding the\nshortcomings inherent in the widely used push-out technique. Allowing\ndecoherence to dominate the evolution of our system causes a transition from\nquantum to classical behavior in fulfillment of the Leggett-Garg inequality.\n", "  We present a hierarchical Bayesian method for estimating the total mass and\nmass profile of the Milky Way Galaxy. The new hierarchical Bayesian approach\nfurther improves the framework presented by Eadie, Harris, & Widrow (2015) and\nEadie & Harris (2016) and builds upon the preliminary reports by Eadie et al\n(2015a,c). The method uses a distribution function $f(\\mathcal{E},L)$ to model\nthe galaxy and kinematic data from satellite objects such as globular clusters\n(GCs) to trace the Galaxy's gravitational potential. A major advantage of the\nmethod is that it not only includes complete and incomplete data simultaneously\nin the analysis, but also incorporates measurement uncertainties in a coherent\nand meaningful way. We first test the hierarchical Bayesian framework, which\nincludes measurement uncertainties, using the same data and power-law model\nassumed in Eadie & Harris (2016), and find the results are similar but more\nstrongly constrained. Next, we take advantage of the new statistical framework\nand incorporate all possible GC data, finding a cumulative mass profile with\nBayesian credible regions. This profile implies a mass within $125$kpc of\n$4.8\\times10^{11}M_{\\odot}$ with a 95\\% Bayesian credible region of\n$(4.0-5.8)\\times10^{11}M_{\\odot}$. Our results also provide estimates of the\ntrue specific energies of all the GCs. By comparing these estimated energies to\nthe measured energies of GCs with complete velocity measurements, we observe\nthat (the few) remote tracers with complete measurements may play a large role\nin determining a total mass estimate of the Galaxy. Thus, our study stresses\nthe need for more remote tracers with complete velocity measurements.\n", "  Wide ranging interest in Dirac Hamiltomian is due to the emergence of novel\nmaterials, namely, graphene, topological insulators and superconductors, the\nnewly-discovered Weyl semimetals, and still actively-sought after Majorana\nfermions in real materials. We give a brief review of the relativistic Dirac\nquantum mechanics and its impact in the developments of modern physics. The\nquantum band dynamics of Dirac Hamiltonian is crucial in resolving the giant\ndiamagnetism of bismuth and Bi-Sb alloys. Quantitative agreement of the theory\nwith the experiments on Bi-Sb alloys has been achieved, and physically\nmeaningful contributions to the diamagnetism has been identified. We also treat\nrelativistic Dirac fermion as an interband dynamics in uniform magnetic fields.\nFor the interacting Bloch electrons, the role of translation symmetry for\ncalculating the magnetic susceptibility avoids any approximation to second\norder in the field. The magnetic susceptibility of Hubbard model and those of\nFermi liquids are readily obtained as limiting cases. The expressions for\nmagnetic susceptibility of dilute nonmagnetic alloys give a firm theoretical\nfoundation of the empirical formulas used in fitting experimental results. For\ncompleteness, the magnetic susceptibility of dilute magnetic or Kondo alloys is\nalso given for high and low temperature regimes.\n", "  A framework for studying the effect of the coupling to the heat bath in\nmodels exhibiting anomalous heat conduction is described. The framework is\napplied to the harmonic chain with momentum exchange model where the\nnon-trivial temperature profile is calculated. In this approach one first uses\nthe hydrodynamic (HD) equations to calculate the equilibrium current-current\ncorrelation function in large but finite chains, explicitly taking into account\nthe BCs resulting from the coupling to the heat reservoirs. Making use of a\nlinear response relation, the anomalous conductivity exponent $\\alpha$ and an\nintegral equation for the temperature profile are obtained. The temperature\nprofile is found to be singular at the boundaries with an exponent which varies\ncontinuously with the coupling to the heat reservoirs expressed by the BCs. In\naddition, the relation between the harmonic chain and a system of\nnoninteracting L{\\'e}vy walkers is made explicit, where different BCs of the\nchain correspond to different reflection coefficients of the L{\\'e}vy\nparticles.\n", "  Many of the methods proposed so far to go beyond Standard Perturbation Theory\nbreak invariance under time-dependent boosts (denoted here as extended Galilean\nInvariance, or GI). This gives rise to spurious large scale effects which spoil\nthe small scale predictions of these approximation schemes. By using\nconsistency relations we derive fully non-perturbative constraints that GI\nimposes on correlation functions. We then introduce a method to quantify the\namount of GI breaking of a given scheme, and to correct it by properly tailored\ncounterterms. Finally, we formulate resummation schemes which are manifestly\nGI, discuss their general features, and implement them in the so called\nTime-Flow, or TRG, equations.\n", "  We present the analytic computation of all the planar master integrals which\ncontribute to the two-loop scattering amplitudes for Higgs$\\to 3$ partons, with\nfull heavy-quark mass dependence. These are relevant for the NNLO corrections\nto fully inclusive Higgs production and to the NLO corrections to Higgs\nproduction in association with a jet, in the full theory. The computation is\nperformed using the differential equations method. Whenever possible, a basis\nof master integrals that are pure functions of uniform weight is used. The\nresult is expressed in terms of one-fold integrals of polylogarithms and\nelementary functions up to transcendental weight four. Two integral sectors are\nexpressed in terms of elliptic functions. We show that by introducing a\none-dimensional parametrization of the integrals the relevant second order\ndifferential equation can be readily solved, and the solution can be expressed\nto all orders of the dimensional regularization parameter in terms of iterated\nintegrals over elliptic kernels. We express the result for the elliptic sectors\nin terms of two and three-fold iterated integrals, which we find suitable for\nnumerical evaluations. This is the first time that four-point multiscale\nFeynman integrals have been computed in a fully analytic way in terms of\nelliptic functions.\n", "  We use the high-resolution cosmological simulation Illustris to investigate\nthe clustering of supermassive black holes across cosmic time, the link between\nblack hole clustering and host halo masses, and the implications for black hole\nduty cycles. Our predicted black hole correlation length and bias match the\nobservational data very well across the full redshift range probed. Black hole\nclustering is strongly luminosity-dependent on small, 1-halo scales, with some\nmoderate dependence on larger scales of a few Mpc at intermediate redshifts. We\nfind black hole clustering to evolve only weakly with redshift, initially\nfollowing the behaviour of their hosts. However below z ~ 2 black hole\nclustering increases faster than that of their hosts, which leads to a\nsignificant overestimate of the clustering-predicted host halo mass. The full\ndistribution of host halo masses is very wide, including a low-mass tail\nextending up to an order of magnitude below the naive prediction for minimum\nhost mass. Our black hole duty cycles follow a power-law dependence on black\nhole mass and decrease with redshift, and we provide accurate analytic fits to\nthese. The increase in clustering amplitude at late times, however, means that\nduty cycle estimates based on black hole clustering can overestimate duty\ncycles substantially, by more than two orders of magnitude. We find the best\nagreement when the minimum host mass is assumed to be $10^{11.2} M_\\odot$ ,\nwhich provides an accurate measure across all redshifts and luminosity ranges\nprobed by our simulation.\n", "  Motivated by recent work on quantum integrable models without U(1) symmetry,\nwe show that the sl(2) Hirota equation admits a Lax representation with\ninhomogeneous terms. The compatibility of the auxiliary linear problem leads to\na new consistent family of Hirota-like equations.\n", "  We show how the infra-red divergences associated to Goldstone bosons in the\nminimum condition of the two-loop Landau-gauge effective potential can be\navoided in general field theories. This extends the resummation formalism\nrecently developed for the Standard Model and the MSSM, and we give compact,\ninfra-red finite expressions in closed form for the tadpole equations. We also\nshow that the results at this loop order are equivalent to (and are most easily\nobtained by) imposing an \"on-shell\" condition for the Goldstone bosons.\nMoreover, we extend the approach to show how the infra-red divergences in the\ncalculation of the masses of neutral scalars (such as the Higgs boson) can be\neliminated. For the mass computation, we specialise to the gaugeless limit and\nextend the effective potential computation to allow the masses to be determined\nwithout needing to solve differential equations for the loop functions --\nopening the door to fast, infra-red safe determinations of the Higgs mass in\ngeneral theories.\n", "  We present a recursive method to calculate the $\\alpha'$-expansion of disk\nintegrals arising in tree-level scattering of open strings which resembles the\napproach of Berends and Giele to gluon amplitudes. Following an earlier\ninterpretation of disk integrals as doubly partial amplitudes of an effective\ntheory of scalars dubbed as $Z$-theory, we pinpoint the equation of motion of\n$Z$-theory from the Berends-Giele recursion for its tree amplitudes. A computer\nimplementation of this method including explicit results for the recursion up\nto order $\\alpha'^7$ is made available on the website\nhttp://repo.or.cz/BGap.git\n", "  We assess the effect of the local large scale structure on the estimation of\ntwo-point statistics of the observed radial peculiar velocities of galaxies. A\nlarge N-body simulation is used to examine these statistics from the\nperspective of random observers as well as \"Local Group (LG)-like\" observers\nconditioned to reside in an environment resembling the observed universe within\n20 Mpc. The local environment systematically distorts the shape and amplitude\nof velocity statistics with respect to ensemble-averaged measurements made by a\nCopernican (random) observer. The Virgo cluster has the most significant\nimpact, introducing large systematic deviations in all the statistics. For a\nsimple \"top-hat\" selection function, an idealized survey extending to $\\sim\n160h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ or deeper is needed to completely mitigate the effects of\nthe local environment. Using shallower catalogues leads to systematic\ndeviations of the order of $50$ to $200\\%$ depending on the scale considered.\nFor a flat redshift distribution similar to the one of the CosmicFlows-3\nsurvey, the deviations are even more prominent in both the shape and amplitude\nat all separations considered $({\\stackrel{<}{{}_\\sim}} 100h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc})$.\nConclusions based on statistics calculated without taking into account the\nimpact of the local environment should be revisited.\n", "  It has recently been demonstrated with Monte Carlo studies that combining the\nwell-known Y-splitter and trimming techniques gives rise to important gains in\nthe signal significance achievable for boosted electroweak boson tagging at\nhigh $p_t$. Here we carry out analytical calculations that explain these\nfindings from first principles of QCD both for grooming via trimming and via\nthe modified mass-drop tagger (mMDT). We also suggest modifications to\nY-splitter itself, which result in great simplifications to the analytical\nresults both for pure Y-splitter as well as its combination with general\ngrooming methods. The modifications also lead to further performance gains,\nwhile making the results largely independent of choice of groomer. We discuss\nthe implications of these findings in the broader context of optimal methods\nfor boosted object studies at hadron colliders.\n", "  The emission of the white dwarf-M dwarf binary AR Sco is driven by the rapid\nsynchronization of its white dwarf, rather than by accretion. This requires a\ncomparatively large magnetic field $\\sim 100$ gauss at the M dwarf and $\\sim\n10^8$ gauss on the white dwarf, larger than the fields of most intermediate\npolars but within the range of fields of known magnetic white dwarfs. The\nspindown power is dissipated in the atmosphere of the M dwarf by magnetic\nreconnection, accelerating particles that produce the observed synchrotron\nradiation. The displacement of the optical maximum from conjunction may be\nexplained either by dissipation in a bow wave as the white dwarf's magnetic\nfield sweeps past the M dwarf or by a misaligned white dwarf's rotation axis\nand oblique magnetic moment. In the latter case the rotation axis precesses\nwith a period of decades, predicting a drift in the orbital phase of maximum.\nBinaries whose emission is powered by synchronization may be termed\nsynchronars, in analogy to magnetars.\n", "  A fundamental requirement for the emergence of classical behavior from an\nunderlying quantum description is that certain observed quantum systems make a\ntransition to chaotic dynamics as their action is increased relative to\n$\\hbar$. While experiments have demonstrated some aspects of this transition,\nthe emergence of quantum trajectories with a positive Lyapunov exponent has\nnever been observed directly. Here, we remove a major obstacle to achieving\nthis goal by showing that, for the Duffing oscillator, the transition to a\npositive Lyapunov exponent can be resolved clearly from observed trajectories\neven with measurement efficiencies as low as 20%. We also find that the\npositive Lyapunov exponent is robust to highly mixed, low purity states and to\nvariations in the parameters of the system.\n", "  Jet substructure observables, designed to identify specific features within\njets, play an essential role at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), both for\nsearching for signals beyond the Standard Model and for testing QCD in extreme\nphase space regions. In this paper, we systematically study the structure of\ninfrared and collinear safe substructure observables, defining a generalization\nof the energy correlation functions to probe $n$-particle correlations within a\njet. These generalized correlators provide a flexible basis for constructing\nnew substructure observables optimized for specific purposes. Focusing on three\nmajor targets of the jet substructure community---boosted top tagging, boosted\n$W/Z/H$ tagging, and quark/gluon discrimination---we use power-counting\ntechniques to identify three new series of powerful discriminants: $M_i$,\n$N_i$, and $U_i$. The $M_i$ series is designed for use on groomed jets,\nproviding a novel example of observables with improved discrimination power\nafter the removal of soft radiation. The $N_i$ series behave parametrically\nlike the $N$-subjettiness ratio observables, but are defined without respect to\nsubjet axes, exhibiting improved behavior in the unresolved limit. Finally, the\n$U_i$ series improves quark/gluon discrimination by using higher-point\ncorrelators to simultaneously probe multiple emissions within a jet. Taken\ntogether, these observables broaden the scope for jet substructure studies at\nthe LHC.\n", "  Absolute transition frequencies of the $2s\\,^2{\\rm{S}}_{1/2}$ $\\rightarrow$\n$2p\\,^2{\\rm{P}}_{1/2,3/2}$ transitions in Be$^+$ were measured with a frequency\ncomb in stable and short-lived isotopes at ISOLDE (CERN) using collinear laser\nspectroscopy. Quasi-simultaneous measurements in copropagating and\ncounterpropagating geometry were performed to become independent from\nacceleration voltage determinations for Doppler-shift corrections of the fast\nion beam. Isotope shifts and fine structure splittings were obtained from the\nabsolute transition frequencies with accuracies better than 1\\,MHz and led to a\nprecise determination of the nuclear charge radii of $^{7,10-12}$Be relative to\nthe stable isotope $^9$Be. Moreover, an accurate determination of the $2p$ fine\nstructure splitting allowed a test of high-precision bound-state QED\ncalculations in the three-electron system. Here, we describe the laser\nspectroscopic method in detail, including several tests that were carried out\nto determine or estimate systematic uncertainties. Final values from two\nexperimental runs at ISOLDE are presented and the results are discussed.\n", "  Due to time-reversal symmetry (TRS), two dimensional topological insulators\nsupport counter-propagating helical edge modes. Here we show that, unlike the\ninfinitely sharp edge potential utilized in traditional calculations, an\nexperimentally more realistic smooth edge potential gives rise to edge\nreconstruction and, consequently, spontaneous TRS breaking. Such edge\nreconstruction may lead to breaking of the expected perfect conductance\nquantization, to a finite Hall resistance at zero magnetic field, and to a\nlikely spin current. This calculation underpins the fragility of the\ntopological protection in realistic systems, which is of crucial importance in\nproposed applications.\n", "  The motion of a surfactant-laden viscous droplet in the presence of\nbackground non-isothermal Poiseuille flow is studied analytically and\nnumerically. Specifically, the effect of interfacial Marangoni stress due to\nnon-uniform distribution of surfactants and temperature at the droplet\ninterface on the velocity and direction of motion of the droplet along the\ncenterline of imposed Poiseuille flow is investigated in the presence of\nlinearly varying temperature field. In the absence of thermal convection, fluid\ninertia and shape deformation, the interfacial transport of bulk-insoluble\nsurfactants is governed by the surface Peclet number which represents the\nrelative strength of the advective transport of surfactant over the diffusive\ntransport. We obtain analytical solution for small and large values of the\nsurface Peclet number. Numerical solution is obtained for arbitrary surface\nPeclet number, which compares well with the analytical solution. Depending on\nthe direction of temperature gradient with respect to the imposed Poiseuille\nflow, the surfactant-induced Marangoni stress affects the droplet velocity\ndifferently. When the imposed temperature increases in the direction of imposed\nPoiseuille flow, surfactants retard the droplet motion as compared with a\nsurfactant-free droplet. However, when the imposed temperature decreases in the\ndirection of imposed Poiseuille flow, presence of surfactants may increase or\ndecrease the magnitude of droplet velocity depending on the relevant governing\nparameters. Further, for particular values of governing parameters, we observe\nchange in direction of droplet motion due to presence of surfactants, which may\nbear significant consequences in the design of droplet based microfluidic\nsystems.\n", "  The spin current relaxation time [tau] in thermally evaporated pentacene\nfilms was evaluated with the spin-pump-induced spin transport properties and\nthe charge current transport properties in pentacene films. Under an assumption\nof a diffusive transport of the spin current in pentacene films, the zero-field\nmobility and the diffusion constant of holes in pentacene films were\nexperimentally obtained to be ~8.0x10^-7 m^2/Vs and ~2.0x10^-8 m^2/s,\nrespectively. Using those values and the previously obtained spin diffusion\nlength in pentacene films of 42{plus-minus}10 nm, the [tau] in pentacene films\nwas estimated to be 150{plus-minus}120 ns at room temperature. This estimated\n[tau] in pentacene films is long enough for practical use as a spintronic\nmaterial.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the phenomena of adiabatic quantum charge\npumping through a normal-insulator-superconductor-insulator-normal (NISIN)\nsetup of silicene within the scattering matrix formalism. Assuming thin barrier\nlimit, we consider the strength of the two barriers ($\\chi_{1}$ and $\\chi_{2}$)\nas the two pumping parameters in the adiabatic regime. Within this geometry, we\nobtain crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) with probability unity in the\n$\\chi_{1}$-$\\chi_{2}$ plane without concomitant transmission or elastic\ncotunneling (CT). Tunability of the band gap at the Dirac point by applying an\nexternal electric field perpendicular to the silicene sheet and variation of\nthe chemical potential at the normal silicene region, open up the possibility\nof achieving perfect either CAR or transmission process through our setup. This\nresonant behavior is periodic with the barrier strengths. We analyze the\nbehavior of the pumped charge through the NISIN structure as a function of the\npumping strength and angles of the incident electrons. We show that large\n($Q\\sim2e$) pumped charge can be obtained through our geometry when the pumping\ncontour encloses either the CAR or transmission resonance in the pumping\nparameter space. We discuss possible experimental feasibility of our\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  The formulation of the interaction of matter with singular light fields needs\nspecial care. In a recent article [Phys.~Rev.~A {\\bf 91}, 033808 (2015)] we\nhave shown that the Hamiltonian describing the interaction of a twisted light\nbeam having parallel orbital and spin angular momenta with a small object\nlocated close to the phase singularity can be expressed only in terms of the\nelectric field of the beam. Here, we complement our studies by providing an\ninteraction Hamiltonian for beams having antiparallel orbital and spin angular\nmomenta. Such beams may exhibit unusually strong magnetic effects. We further\nextend our formulation to radially and azimuthally polarized beams. The\nadvantages of our formulation are that for all beams the Hamiltonian is written\nsolely in terms of the electric and magnetic fields of the beam and as such it\nis manifestly gauge-invariant. Furthermore it is intuitive by resembling the\nwell-known expressions in the dipole-electric and dipole-magnetic moment\napproximations.\n", "  A novel explanation of the quasielastic release phenomenon in shock\ncompressed aluminum is presented. A dislocation-based model, taking into\naccount dislocation substructures and evolution, is applied to simulate the\nelastic plastic response of both single crystal and poly crystalline aluminum.\nThe calculated results are in good agreement with experimental results from not\nonly the velocity profiles but also the shear strength and dislocation density,\nwhich demonstrates the accuracy of our simulations. Simulated results indicate\nthat dislocation immobilization during dynamic deformation results in a smooth\nincrease of yield stress, which leads to the quasi-elastic release, while the\ngeneration of dislocations caused by the plastic release wave results in the\nappearance of a transition point between the quasielastic release and the\nplastic release in the profile.\n", "  We investigate the transport of energy in a linear chain of two-level quantum\nemitters (\"atoms\") weakly coupled to a blackbody radiation bath. We show that,\nsimply by displacing one or more atoms from their regular-chain positions, the\nefficiency of the energy transport can be considerably amplified of at least\none order of magnitude. Besides, in configurations providing an efficiency\ngreater than $100\\%$ , the distance between the two last atoms of the chain can\nbe up to 20 times larger than the one in the regular chain, thus achieving a\nmuch longer-range energy transport. By performing both a stationary and\ntime-dependent analysis, we ascribe this effect to an elementary block of three\natoms, playing the role of excitation injector from the blackbody bath to the\nextraction site. By considering chains with up to 7 atoms, we also show that\nthe amplification is robust and can be further enhanced up to $1400\\%$.\n", "  The outcome of upcoming cosmological surveys will depend on the accurate\nestimates of photometric redshifts. In the framework of the implementation of\nthe photo-z algorithm for Euclid, we are exploring new avenues to improve\ntemplate-fitting methods. The paper focusses on the prescription of the\nextinction of source light by dust in the Milky Way. Since Galactic extinction\nstrongly correlates with wavelength and photometry is commonly obtained in\nbroad-band filters, the amount of absorption depends on the source SED, a point\noften neglected as the SED is not known a-priori. A consequence of this is that\nthe observed E(B-V) (=A_B-A_V) will be different from the E(B-V) used to\nnormalise the absorption law k_lambda (=A_lambda/E(B-V)). Band-pass corrections\nare required to renormalise the law for a given SED. We assess the band-pass\ncorrections of a range of SEDs and find they vary by up to 20%. We investigate\nhow dust-to-reddening scaling factors depend of the sources used for their\ncalibration. We derive scaling factors from the color excesses of z<0.4 SDSS\nred galaxies and show that band-pass corrections predict the observed\ndifferences. Extinction is then estimated for a range of SEDs and filters\nrelevant to Euclid and other cosmological ground-based surveys. For high\nextinction line-of-sights (E(B-V)>0.1, ~8% of the Euclid survey), the\nvariations in corrections can be ~0.1mag in the `bluer' optical filters and\n~0.04mag in the NIR filters. An inaccurate correction of extinction critically\naffects photo-z. In particular, for high extinctions and z<0.5, the bias (mean\nD_z=z_phot-z_real) exceeds 0.2%(1+z), the precision required by weak-lensing\nanalyses. Additional uncertainty on the MW extinction law further reduces the\nphoto-z precision. We propose a new prescription of Galactic absorption for\ntemplate-fitting algorithms that takes into consideration the dependence of\nextinction with SED.\n", "  We introduce a new microscopic approach to calculate the dependence of fusion\nbarriers and cross-sections on isospin dynamics. The method is based on the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock theory and the isoscalar and isovector properties\nof the energy density functional (EDF). The contribution to the fusion barriers\noriginating from the isoscalar and isovector parts of the EDF is calculated. It\nis shown that for non-symmetric systems the isovector dynamics influence the\nsub-barrier fusion cross-sections. For most systems this results in an\nenhancement of the sub-barrier cross-sections, while for others we observe\ndiffering degrees of hindrance. We use this approach to provide an explanation\nof recently measured fusion cross sections which show a surprising enhancement\nat low $E_\\mathrm{c.m.}$ energies for the system $^{40}$Ca+$^{132}$Sn as\ncompared to the more neutron-rich system $^{48}$Ca+$^{132}$Sn, and discuss the\ndependence of sub-barrier fusion cross-sections on transfer.\n", "  In the spinel compound GeCo$_2$O$_4$, the Co$^{2+}$ pyrochlore sublattice\npresents remarkable magnetic field-induced behaviors that we unveil through\nneutron and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. The N\\'eel ordered magnetic phase\nis entered through a structural lowering of the cubic symmetry. In this phase,\nwhen a magnetic field is applied along a 2-fold cubic direction, a spin-flop\ntransition of one fourth of the magnetic moments releases the magnetic\nfrustration and triggers magnetostructural effects. At high field, these\nultimately lead to an unusual spin reorientation associated to structural\nchanges.\n", "  A Cr atom in a semiconductor host carries a localized spin with an intrinsic\nlarge spin to strain coupling particularly promising for the development of\nhybrid spin-mechanical systems and coherent mechanical spin driving. We\ndemonstrate here that the spin of an individual Cr atom inserted in a\nsemiconductor quantum dot can be controlled optically. We first show that a Cr\nspin can be prepared by resonant optical pumping. Monitoring the time\ndependence of the intensity of the resonant fluorescence of the quantum dot\nduring this process permits to probe the dynamics of the optical initialization\nof the Cr spin. Using this initialization and read-out technique we measured a\nCr spin relaxation time at T=5 K of about 2 microseconds. We finally\ndemonstrate that, under a resonant single mode laser field, the energy of any\nspin state of an individual Cr atom can be independently tuned by using the\noptical Stark effect.\n", "  We study a Majorana island coupled to a bulk superconductor via a Josephson\njunction and to multiple external normal leads. In the absence of the Josephson\ncoupling, the system displays a topological Kondo state, which had been largely\nstudied recently. However, we find that this state is unstable even to small\nJosephson coupling, which instead leads at low temperature $T$ to a new fixed\npoint. Most interesting is the case of three external leads, forming a minimal\nelectronic realization of the long sought two-channel Kondo effect. While the\n$T=0$ conductance corresponds to simple resonant Andreev reflection, the\nleading $T$ dependence forms an experimental fingerprint for non-Fermi liquid\nproperties.\n", "  Recently ATLAS reported a $3.3\\sigma$ excess in the stop search with\n$\\ell+jets+E_T^{miss}$ channel. We try to interpret the signal by a light stop\npair production in the MSSM. We find: (1) simple models where stop decays into\na higgsino or a bino are not favored. (2) an extension of them can explain the\ndata at $2\\sigma$ level without conflicting with the other search channels. A\nsurviving possibility includes a light stop and a light higgsino, which is\nexpected in a natural SUSY scenario.\n", "  Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted great interest in the\nlast few years. Thinned down to the monolayer limit they change from an\nindirect band structure to a direct band gap in the visible region. Due to the\nmonolayer thickness the inversion symmetry of the crystal is broken and spin\nand valley are coupled to each other. The degeneracy between the two equivalent\nvalleys, K and K', respectively, can be lifted by applying an external magnetic\nfield. Here, we present photoluminescence measurements of CVD-grown tungsten\ndisulphide (WS${_2}$) monolayers at temperatures of 2 K. By applying magnetic\nfields up to 7 T in Faraday geometry, a splitting of the photoluminescence\npeaks can be observed. The magnetic field dependence of the A-exciton, the\ntrion and three bound exciton states is discussed and the corresponding\ng-factors are determined.\n", "  The massive diffusion of online social media allows for the rapid and\nuncontrolled spreading of conspiracy theories, hoaxes, unsubstantiated claims,\nand false news. Such an impressive amount of misinformation can influence\npolicy preferences and encourage behaviors strongly divergent from recommended\npractices. In this paper, we study the statistical properties of viral\nmisinformation in online social media. By means of methods belonging to Extreme\nValue Theory, we show that the number of extremely viral posts over time\nfollows a homogeneous Poisson process, and that the interarrival times between\nsuch posts are independent and identically distributed, following an\nexponential distribution. Moreover, we characterize the uncertainty around the\nrate parameter of the Poisson process through Bayesian methods. Finally, we are\nable to derive the predictive posterior probability distribution of the number\nof posts exceeding a certain threshold of shares over a finite interval of\ntime.\n", "  We determine quark mass dependent order $a$ improvement terms of the form\n$b_J am$ for non-singlet scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axialvector currents,\nusing correlators in coordinate space. We use a set of CLS ensembles comprising\nnon-perturbatively improved Wilson Fermions and the tree-level Luescher-Weisz\ngauge action at $\\beta=3.4,3.46,3.55$ and $\\beta=3.7$, corresponding to lattice\nspacings $a$ ranging from $0.05$ fm to $0.09$ fm. We report the values of the\n$b_J$ improvement coefficients which are proportional to non-singlet quark mass\ncombinations and also discuss the possibility of determining the $\\bar{b}_J$\ncoefficients which are proportional to the trace of the quark mass matrix.\n", "  We examine analytically and numerically a variant of the stochastic Kuramoto\nmodel for phase oscillators coupled on a general network. Two populations of\nphased oscillators are considered, labelled `Blue' and `Red', each with their\nrespective networks, internal and external couplings, natural frequencies, and\nfrustration parameters in the dynamical interactions of the phases. We\ndisentagle the different ways that additive Gaussian noise may influence the\ndynamics by applying it separately on zero modes or normal modes corresponding\nto a Laplacian decomposition for the sub-graphs for Blue and Red. Under the\nlinearisation ansatz that the oscillators of each respective network remain\nrelatively phase-sychronised centroids or clusters, we are able to obtain\nsimple closed-form expressions using the Fokker-Planck approach for the\ndynamics of the average angle of the two centroids. In some cases, this leads\nto subtle effects of metastability that we may analytically describe using the\ntheory of ratchet potentials. These considerations are extended to a regime\nwhere one of the populations has fragmented in two. The analytic expressions we\nderive largely predict the dynamics of the non-linear system seen in numerical\nsimulation. In particular, we find that noise acting on a more tightly coupled\npopulation allows for improved synchronisation of the other population where\ndeterministically it is fragmented.\n", "  Motivated by the experimental development of quasi-homogeneous Bose-Einstein\ncondensates confined in box-like traps, we study numerically the dynamics of\ndark solitons in such traps at zero temperature. We consider the cases where\nthe side walls of the box potential rise either as a power-law or a Gaussian.\nWhile the soliton propagates through the homogeneous interior of the box\nwithout dissipation, it typically dissipates energy during a reflection from a\nwall through the emission of sound waves, causing a slight increase in the\nsoliton's speed. We characterise this energy loss as a function of the wall\nparameters. Moreover, over multiple oscillations and reflections in the\nbox-like trap, the energy loss and speed increase of the soliton can be\nsignificant, although the decay eventually becomes stabilized when the soliton\nequilibrates with the ambient sound field.\n", "  We introduce a new method for the computation of the transition moments\nbetween the excited electronic states based on the expectation value formalism\nof the coupled cluster theory [B. Jeziorski and R. Moszynski, Int. J. Quant.\nChem. 48, 161 (1993)]. The working expressions of the new method solely employ\nthe coupled cluster amplitudes. In the approximation adopted in the present\npaper the cluster expansion is limited to single, double, and linear triple\nexcitations. The computed dipole transition probabilities for the\nsinglet-singlet and triplet-triplet transitions in alkali earth atoms agree\nwell with the available theoretical and experimental data. In contrast to the\nexisting coupled cluster response theory, the matrix elements obtained by using\nour approach satisfy the Hermitian symmetry even if the excitations in the\ncluster operator are truncated. As a part of the numerical evidence for the new\nmethod, we report calculations of the transition moments between the excited\ntriplet states which have not yet been reported in the literature within the\ncoupled cluster theory. Slater-type basis sets constructed according to the\ncorrelation-consistency principle are used in our calculations.\n", "  Non-anticommutative deformations have been studied in the context of\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) in three and four space-time dimensions, and the general\npicture is that highly nontrivial to deform supersymmetry in a way that still\npreserves some of its important properties, both at the formal algebraic level\n(e.g., preserving the associativity of the deformed theory) as well as at the\nphysical level (e.g., maintaining renormalizability). The Hopf algebra\nformalism allows the definition of algebraically consistent deformations of\nSUSY, but this algebraic consistency does not guarantee that physical models\nbuild upon these structures will be consistent from the physical point of view.\nWe will investigate a deformation induced by a Drinfel'd twist of the ${\\cal\nN}=1$ SUSY algebra in three space-time dimensions. The use of the Hopf algebra\nformalism allows the construction of deformed ${\\cal N}=1$ SUSY algebras that\nshould still preserve a deformed version of supersymmetry. We will construct\nthe simplest deformed version of the Wess-Zumino model in this context, but we\nwill show that despite the consistent algebraic structure, the model in\nquestion is not invariant under SUSY transformation and is not renormalizable.\nWe will comment on the relation of these results with previous ones discussed\nin the literature regarding similar four-dimensional constructions.\n", "  We demonstrate a vapor cell atomic clock prototype based on continuous-wave\n(CW) interrogation and double-modulation coherent population trapping (DM-CPT)\ntechnique. The DM-CPT technique uses a synchronous modulation of polarization\nand relative phase of a bi-chromatic laser beam in order to increase the number\nof atoms trapped in a dark state, i.e. a non-absorbing state. The narrow\nresonance, observed in transmission of a Cs vapor cell, is used as a narrow\nfrequency discriminator in an atomic clock. A detailed characterization of the\nCPT resonance versus numerous parameters is reported. A short-term frequency\nstability of $3.2 \\times 10^{-13} \\tau^{-1/2}$ up to 100 s averaging time is\nmeasured. These performances are more than one order of magnitude better than\nindustrial Rb clocks and comparable to those of best laboratory-prototype vapor\ncell clocks. The noise budget analysis shows that the short and mid-term\nfrequency stability is mainly limited by the power fluctuations of the\nmicrowave used to generate the bi-chromatic laser. These preliminary results\ndemonstrate that the DM-CPT technique is well-suited for the development of a\nhigh-performance atomic clock, with potential compact and robust setup due to\nits linear architecture. This clock could find future applications in industry,\ntelecommunications, instrumentation or global navigation satellite systems.\n", "  Bayesian inference provides a principled way of estimating the parameters of\na stochastic process that is observed discretely in time. The overdamped\nBrownian motion of a particle confined in an optical trap is generally modelled\nby the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and can be observed directly in experiment.\nHere we present Bayesian methods for inferring the parameters of this process,\nthe trap stiffness and the particle diffusion coefficient, that use exact\nlikelihoods and sufficient statistics to arrive at simple expressions for the\nmaximum a posteriori estimates. This obviates the need for Monte Carlo sampling\nand yields methods that are both fast and accurate. We apply these to\nexperimental data and demonstrate their advantage over commonly used\nnon-Bayesian fitting methods.\n", "  We collect and estimate support for our long speculated \"multiple point\nprinciple\" saying that there should be several vacua all having (compared to\nthe scales of high energy physics) very low energy densities. In pure Standard\nModel we suggest there being three by \"multiple point principle\" low energy\ndensity vacua, \"present\", \"condensate\" and \"high field\" vacuum. We fit the mass\nof the in our picture since long speculated bound state of six top and six anti\ntop quarks in three quite {\\em independent ways} and get remarkably within our\ncrude accuracy the {\\em same} mass in all three fits! The new point of the\npresent article is to estimate the bound state mass in what we could call a bag\nmodel estimation. The two other fits, which we review, obtain the mass of the\nbound state by fitting to the multiple point principle prediction of degenerate\nvacua.\n  Our remarkable agreement of our three mass-fits can be interpreted to mean,\nthat we have calculated at the end the energy densities of the two extra\nspeculated vacua and found that they are indeed very small!. Unfortunately the\nrecently much discussed statistical fluctuation peak F(750) has now been\nrevealed to be just a fluctuation, very accidentally matches our fitted mass of\nthe bound state remarkably well with the mass of this fluctuation 750 GeV.\n", "  The sign problem of finite-density QCD at the zero temperature becomes very\nsevere if the quark chemical potential exceeds half of the pion mass. In order\nto understand its property, we consider the sign problem of the one-site\nfermion model appearing in its path-integral expression by using the\nLefschetz-thimble method. We show that the original integration cycle becomes\ndecomposed into multiple Lefschetz thimbles at a certain value of the fermion\nchemical potential, which would correspond to half of the pion mass of\nfinite-density QCD. This triggers a fictitious phase transition on each\nLefschetz thimble, and the interference of complex phases among them plays an\nimportant role for the correct description of the system. We also show that the\ncomplex Langevin method does not work in this situation.\n", "  We analyze the mode stability of odd-parity perturbations of black holes with\nlinearly time-dependent scalar hair in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. We\nshow that a large class of black hole solutions in these theories suffer from\nghost or gradient instability, while there are some classes of solutions that\nare stable under linear odd-parity perturbations in the context of mode\nanalysis.\n", "  The reaction $^{11}\\textrm{B}+p$ has been used to populate the $(J^\\pi,T) =\n(2^+,1)$ state at an excitation energy of 16.11 MeV in $^{12}$C. $\\gamma$-decay\nto unbound states in $^{12}$C are identified from analysis of the decay of the\npopulated daughter states. Due to a new technique, $\\gamma$-decay to the 10.8\nMeV 1$^-$ state is observed for the first time, and transitions to the 9.64 MeV\n(3$^-$) and 12.71 MeV (1$^+$) are confirmed. Unresolved transitions to natural\nparity strength at 10 MeV and 11.5-13 MeV are also observed. For all\ntransitions partial widths are deduced\n", "  We revisit the multilepton ($ml$) + ${E\\!\\!\\!\\!/_T}$ + $X$ signatures of the\nInert Doublet Model (IDM) of dark matter in future LHC experiments for $m =$ 3,\n4 and simulate, for the first time, the $m = 5$ case. Here $X$ stands for any\nnumber of jets. We illustrate these signals with benchmark points consistent\nwith the usual constraints like unitarity, perturbativity, the precision\nelectroweak data, the observed dark matter relic density of the Universe and,\nmost importantly, the stringent LHC constraints from the post Higgs ($h$)\ndiscovery era like the measured $M_h$ and the upper bound on the invisible\nwidth of $h$ decay which were not included in earlier analyses of multilepton\nsignatures. We find that if the IDM model is embedded in a grand dessert\nscenario so that the unitarity constraint holds up to a very high scale, the\nwhole of the highly restricted parameter space allowed by the above constraints\ncan be probed at the LHC via the $3l$ signal for an integrated luminosity $\\sim\n3000 ~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$. On the other hand, if any new physics shows up at a scale\n$\\sim$ 10~TeV, only a part of the enlarged allowed parameter space can be\nprobed. The $4l$ and $5l$ signals can help to discriminate among different IDM\nscenarios as and when sufficient integrated luminosity accumulates.\n", "  The gauge boson production at forward rapidities in single diffractive events\nat the LHC is investigated considering $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 8 and 13\nTeV. The impact of gap survival effects is analysed using two different models\nfor the soft rescattering contributions. We demonstrate that using the Forward\nShower Counter Project at LHCb -- HERSCHEL, together with the Vertex Locator --\nVELO, it is possible to discriminate diffractive production of the gauge bosons\n$W$ and $Z$ from the non-diffractive processes and studies of the Pomeron\nstructure and diffraction phenomenology are feasible. Moreover, we show that\nthe analysis of this process can be useful to constrain the modelling of the\ngap survival effects.\n", "  We construct a representation of the zero central charge Virasoro algebra\nusing string fields in Witten's open bosonic string field theory. This\nconstruction is used to explore extensions of the KBc algebra and find novel\nalgebraic solutions of open string field theory.\n", "  We use neutron scattering to study magnetic excitations near the\nantiferromagnetic wave vector in the underdoped single-layer cuprate\nHgBa2CuO4+{\\delta} (superconducting transition temperature Tc ~ 88 K, pseudogap\ntemperature T* ~ 220 K). The response is distinctly enhanced below T* and\nexhibits a Y-shaped dispersion in the pseudogap state, whereas the\nsuperconducting state features an X-shaped (hourglass) dispersion and a further\nresonance-like enhancement. A large spin gap of about 40 meV is observed in\nboth states. This phenomenology is reminiscent of that exhibited by bilayer\ncuprates. The resonance spectral weight, irrespective of doping and compound,\nscales linearly with the putative binding energy of a spin-exciton described by\nan itinerant-spin formalism.\n", "  This is the second paper of a series in which we present measurements of the\nSupernova (SN) rates from the SUDARE survey. In this paper, we study the trend\nof the SN rates with the intrinsic colours, the star formation activity and the\nmass of the parent galaxies. We have considered a sample of about 130000\ngalaxies and a SN sample of about 50 events. We found that the SN Ia rate per\nunit mass is higher by a factor of six in the star-forming galaxies with\nrespect to the passive galaxies. The SN Ia rate per unit mass is also higher in\nthe less massive galaxies that are also younger. These results suggest a\ndistribution of the delay times (DTD) less populated at long delay times than\nat short delays. The CC SN rate per unit mass is proportional to both the sSFR\nand the galaxy mass. The trends of the Type Ia and CC SN rates as a function of\nthe sSFR and the galaxy mass that we observed from SUDARE data are in agreement\nwith literature results at different redshifts. The expected number of SNe Ia\nis in agreement with the observed one for all four DTD models considered both\nin passive and star-forming galaxies so we can not discriminate between\ndifferent progenitor scenarios. The expected number of CC SNe is higher than\nthe observed one, suggesting a higher limit for the minimum progenitor mass. We\nalso compare the expected and observed trends of the SN Ia rate with the\nintrinsic U - J colour of the parent galaxy, assumed as a tracer of the age\ndistribution. While the slope of the relation between the SN Ia rate and the U\n- J color in star-forming galaxies can be reproduced well by all four DTD\nmodels considered, only the steepest of them is able to account for the rates\nand colour in star-forming and passive galaxies with the same value of the SN\nIa production efficiency.\n", "  We develop numerical methods for solving the spin-2 Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. The basis of our work is a two-way splitting of this evolution\nequation that leads to two exactly solvable subsystems. Utilizing second-order\nand fourth-order composition schemes we realize two fully symplectic\nintegration algorithms, the first such algorithms for evolving spin-2\ncondensates. We demonstrate the accuracy of these algorithms against other\nmethods on application to an exact continuous wave solution that we derive.\n", "  Context. Ellerman bombs (EBs) are short-lived emission features,\ncharacterized by extended wing emission in hydrogen Balmer lines. Until now, no\ndistinct signature of EBs has been found in the He I 10830 {\\AA} line, and\nconclusive observations of EBs in He I D 3 have never been reported. Aims. We\naim to study the signature of EBs in neutral helium triplet lines. Methods. The\nobservations consist of 10 consecutive SST/TRIPPEL raster scans close to the\nlimb, featuring the H$\\beta$, He I D3 and He I 10830 {\\AA} spectral regions. We\nalso obtained raster scans with IRIS and make use of the SDO/AIA 1700 {\\AA}\nchannel. We use Hazel to invert the neutral helium triplet lines. Results.\nThree EBs in our data show distinct emission signatures in neutral helium\ntriplet lines, most prominently visible in the He I D3 line. The helium lines\nhave two components: a broad and blue-shifted emission component associated\nwith the EB, and a narrower absorption component formed in the overlying\nchromosphere. One of the EBs in our data shows evidence of strong velocity\ngradients in its emission component. The emission component of the other two\nEBs could be fitted using a constant slab. Our analysis hints towards thermal\nDoppler motions having a large contribution to the broadening for helium and\nIRIS lines. We conclude that the EBs must have high temperatures to exhibit\nemission signals in neutral helium triplet lines. An order of magnitude\nestimate places our observed EBs in the range of $T\\sim 2\\cdot 10^4-10^5$ K.\n", "  Photonic synthesis of radiofrequency revived the quest for unrivalled\nmicrowave purity by its seducing ability to convey the benefits of the optics\nto the microwave world. In this work, we perform a high-fidelity transfer of\nfrequency stability between an optical reference and a microwave signal via a\nlow-noise fiber-based frequency comb and cutting-edge photo-detection\ntechniques. We demonstrate the generation of the purest microwave signal with a\nfractional frequency stability below 6.5 x 10^-16 at 1 s and a timing noise\nfloor below 41 zs.Hz^-1/2 (phase noise below -173 dBc.Hz^-1 for a 12 GHz\ncarrier). This outclasses existing sources and promises a new era for\nstate-of-the-art microwave generation. The characterization is achieved by\nbuilding two auxiliary low noise optoelectronic microwave reference and using a\nheterodyne cross-correlation scheme with lowermost detection noise. This\nunprecedented level of purity can impact domains such as radar systems,\ntelecommunications and time-frequency metrology. Furthermore, the measurement\nmethods developed here can benefit the characterization of a broad range of\nsignals, beyond comb-based systems.\n", "  Thanks to space-based photometry missions CoRoT and Kepler, we benefit from a\nwealth of seismic data for stars other than the sun. In the future, K2, Tess,\nand Plato will complement this data and provide observations in addition to\nthose already at hand. The availability of this data leads to questions on how\nit is feasible to extend linear structural inversion techniques to stars other\nthan the sun. Linked to this problem is the question of the validity of the\nlinear assumption. In this study, we analyse its limitations with respect to\nchanges of structural variables.We wish to provide a more extended theoretical\nbackground to structural linear inversions by doing a study of the validity of\nthe linear assumption for various structural variables. First, we recall the\norigins of the linear assumption for structural stellar inversions and explain\nits importance for asteroseismic studies. We recall the impact of unknown\nstructural quantities such as the mass and the radius of the star on structural\ninversion results. We explain how kernels for new structural variables can be\nderived using two methods, one suited to asteroseismic targets, the other to\nhelioseismic targets. For this second method, we present a new structural pair,\nnamely the (A, Y) structural kernels. The kernels are tested in various\nnumerical experiments that enable us to evaluate the weaknesses of different\npairs and the domains of validity of their respective linear regime. The\nnumerical tests we carry out allow us to disentangle the impact of various\nuncertainties in stellar models on the verification of the linear integral\nrelations. We show the importance of metallicity, the equation of state,\nextra-mixing, and inaccuracies in the microphysics. We discuss the limitations\nof the method of conjugated functions due to the lack of extremely precise\ndeterminations of masses or radii in the asteroseismology.\n", "  An analytic solution for a Fokker-Planck equation that describes propagation\nof energetic particles through a scattering medium is obtained. The solution is\nfound in terms of an infinite series of mixed moments of particle distribution.\nThe spatial dispersion of a particle cloud released at t=0 evolves through\nthree phases, ballistic (t<Tc), transdiffusive (t~Tc) and diffusive (t>>Tc),\nwhere Tc is the collision time.The ballistic phase is characterized by a\ndecelerating expansion of the initial point source in form of a \"box\"\ndistribution with thickening walls. The next, transdiffusive phase is marked by\nthe box walls thickened to its size and a noticeable slow down of expansion.\nFinally, the evolution enters the conventional diffusion phase.\n", "  Low energy observables involving the Standard Model fermions which are\nchirality-violating, such as anomalous electromagnetic moments, necessarily\ninvolve an insertion of the Higgs in order to maintain $SU(2) \\times U(1)$\ngauge invariance. As the result, the properties of the Higgs boson measured at\nthe LHC impact our understanding of the associated low-energy quantities. We\nillustrate this feature with a discussion of the electromagnetic moments of the\n$\\tau$-lepton, as probed by the rare decay $H \\rightarrow \\tau^+ \\tau^-\n\\gamma$. We assess the feasibility of measuring this decay at the LHC, and show\nthat the current bounds from lower energy measurements imply that $13~\\rm{TeV}$\nrunning is very likely to improve our understanding of new physics contributing\nto the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau.\n", "  The presence of a giant planet in a low-viscosity disc can create a gap edge\nin the disc's radial density profile sharp enough to excite the Rossby Wave\nInstability. This instability may evolve into dust-trapping vortices that might\nexplain the \"banana-shaped\" features in recently observed asymmetric transition\ndiscs with inner cavities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations of\nplanet-induced vortices have neglected the timescale of hundreds to thousands\nof orbits to grow a massive planet to Jupiter-size. In this work, we study the\neffect of a giant planet's runaway growth timescale on the lifetime and\ncharacteristics of the resulting vortex. For two different planet masses (1 and\n5 Jupiter masses) and two different disc viscosities ($\\alpha$=3$\\times\n10^{-4}$ and 3$\\times10^{-5}$), we compare the vortices induced by planets with\nseveral different growth timescales between 10 and 4000 planet orbits. In\ngeneral, we find that slowly-growing planets create significantly weaker\nvortices with lifetimes and surface densities reduced by more than $50\\%$. For\nthe higher disc viscosity, the longest growth timescales in our study inhibit\nvortex formation altogether. Additionally, slowly-growing planets produce\nvortices that are up to twice as elongated, with azimuthal extents well above\n$180^{\\circ}$ in some cases. These unique, elongated vortices likely create a\ndistinct signature in the dust observations that differentiates them from the\nmore concentrated vortices that correspond to planets with faster growth\ntimescales. Lastly, we find that the low viscosities necessary for vortex\nformation likely prevent planets from growing quickly enough to trigger the\ninstability in self-consistent models.\n", "  An interaction between dark matter and dark energy, proportional to the\nproduct of their energy densities, results in a scaling behavior of the ratio\nof these densities with respect to the scale factor of the Robertson-Walker\nmetric. This gives rise to a class of cosmological models which deviate from\nthe standard model in an analytically tractable way. In particular, it becomes\npossible to quantify the role of potential dark-energy perturbations. We\ninvestigate the impact of this interaction on the structure formation process.\nUsing the (modified) CAMB code we obtain the CMB spectrum as well as the linear\nmatter power spectrum. It is shown that the strong degeneracy in the parameter\nspace present in the background analysis is considerably reduced by considering\n\\textit{Planck} data. Our analysis is compatible with the $\\Lambda$CDM model at\nthe $2\\sigma$ confidence level with a slightly preferred direction of the\nenergy flow from dark matter to dark energy.\n", "  Isolated, steady-state galaxies correspond to equilibrium solutions of the\nPoisson--Vlasov system. We show that (i) all galaxies with a distribution\nfunction depending on energy alone must be spherically symmetric and (ii) all\naxisymmetric galaxies with a distribution function depending on energy and the\nangular momentum component parallel to the symmetry axis must also be\nreflection-symmetric about the plane $z=0$. The former result is Lichtenstein's\nTheorem, derived here by a method exploiting symmetries of solutions of\nelliptic partial differential equations, while the latter result is new. These\nresults are subsumed into the Symmetry Theorem, which specifies how the\nsymmetries of the distribution function in configuration or velocity space can\ncontrol the planes of reflection symmetries of the ensuing stellar system.\n", "  We study X-ray bright tidal disruption events (TDE), close to the peak of\ntheir emission, with the intention of understanding the evolution of their\nlight curves and spectra. Candidate TDE are identified by searching for soft\nX-ray flares from non-active galaxies in recent XMM-Newton slew data. In April\n2014, X-ray emission was detected from the galaxy XMMSL1 J074008.2-853927\n(a.k.a. 2MASX 07400785-8539307), a factor 20 times higher than an upper limit\nfrom 20 years earlier. Both the X-ray and UV flux subsequently fell, by factors\nof 70 and 12 respectively. The bolometric luminosity peaked at Lbol~2E44 ergs/s\nwith a spectrum that may be modelled with thermal emission in the UV band, a\npower-law with slope~2 dominating in the X-ray band above 2 keV and a soft\nX-ray excess with an effective temperature of ~86 eV. Rapid variability locates\nthe X-ray emission to within <73 Rg of the nuclear black hole. Radio emission\nof flux density ~1 mJy, peaking at 1.5 GHz was detected 21 months after\ndiscovery. Optical spectra indicate that the galaxy, at a distance of 73 Mpc\n(z=0.0173), underwent a starburst 2 Gyr ago and is now quiescent. We consider a\ntidal disruption event to be the most likely cause of the flare. If this proves\nto be correct then this is a very clean example of a disruption exhibiting both\nthermal and non-thermal radiation.\n", "  The increase of the leakage current of NMOS transistors during exposure to\nionizing radiation is known and well studied. Radiation hardness by design\ntechniques have been developed to mitigate this effect and have been\nsuccessfully used. More recent developments in smaller feature size\ntechnologies do not make use of these techniques due to their drawbacks in\nterms of logic density and requirement of dedicated libraries. During operation\nthe resulting increase of the supply current is a serious challenge and needs\nto be considered during the system design.\n  A simple parametrization of the leakage current of NMOS transistors as a\nfunction of total ionizing dose is presented. The parametrization uses a\ntransistor transfer characteristics of the parasitic transistor along the\nshallow trench isolation to describe the leakage current of the nominal\ntransistor. Together with a parametrization of the number of positive charges\ntrapped in the silicon dioxide and number of activated interface traps in the\nsilicon to silicon dioxide interface the leakage current as a function of the\nexposure time to ionizing radiation results. This function is fitted to data of\nthe leakage current of single transistors as well as to data of the supply\ncurrent of full ASICs.\n", "  We present a pilot X-ray study of the five most massive ($M_{500}>5 \\times\n10^{14} M_{\\odot}$), distant (z~1), galaxy clusters detected via the\nSunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We optimally combine XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray\nobservations by leveraging the throughput of XMM to obtain spatially-resolved\nspectroscopy, and the spatial resolution of Chandra to probe the bright inner\nparts and to detect embedded point sources. Capitalising on the excellent\nagreement in flux-related measurements, we present a new method to derive the\ndensity profiles, constrained in the centre by Chandra and in the outskirts by\nXMM. We show that the Chandra-XMM combination is fundamental for morphological\nanalysis at these redshifts, the Chandra resolution being required to remove\npoint source contamination, and the XMM sensitivity allowing higher\nsignificance detection of faint substructures. The sample is dominated by\ndynamically disturbed objects. We use the combined Chandra-XMM density profiles\nand spatially-resolved temperature profiles to investigate thermodynamic\nquantities including entropy and pressure. From comparison of the scaled\nprofiles with the local REXCESS sample, we find no significant departure from\nstandard self-similar evolution, within the dispersion, at any radius, except\nfor the entropy beyond 0.7$R_{500}$. The baryon mass fraction tends towards the\ncosmic value, with a weaker dependence on mass than observed in the local\nUniverse. We compare with predictions from numerical simulations. The present\npilot study demonstrates the utility and feasibility of spatially-resolved\nanalysis of individual objects at high-redshift through the combination of XMM\nand Chandra observations. Observations of a larger sample will allow a fuller\nstatistical analysis to be undertaken, in particular of the intrinsic scatter\nin the structural and scaling properties of the cluster population. (abridged)\n", "  Context: A subclass of broad EUV and X-ray jets, called blowout jets, have\nbecome a topic of research since they could be the link between standard\ncollimated jets and CMEs.}\n  Aim: Our aim is to understand the origin of a series of broad jets, some\naccompanied by flares and associated with narrow and jet-like CMEs.\n  Methods: We analyze observations of a series of recurrent broad jets observed\nin AR 10484 on 21-24 October 2003. In particular, one of them occurred\nsimultaneously with an M2.4 flare on 23 October at 02:41 UT (SOLA2003-10-23).\nBoth events were observed by ARIES H-alpha Solar Tower-Telescope, TRACE, SOHO,\nand RHESSI instruments. The flare was very impulsive and followed by a narrow\nCME. A local force-free model of AR 10484 is the basis to compute its topology.\nWe find bald patches (BPs) at the flare site. This BP topology is present for\nat least two days before. Large-scale field lines, associated with the BPs,\nrepresent open loops. This is confirmed by a global PFSS model. Following the\nbrightest leading edge of the H-alpha and EUV jet emission, we can temporarily\nassociate it with a narrow CME.\n  Results: Considering their characteristics, the observed broad jets appear to\nbe of the blowout class. As the most plausible scenario, we propose that\nmagnetic reconnection could occur at the BP separatrices forced by the\ndestabilization of a continuously reformed flux rope underlying them. The\nreconnection process could bring the cool flux-rope material into the\nreconnected open field lines driving the series of recurrent blowout jets and\naccompanying CMEs.\n  Conclusions: Based on a model of the coronal field, we compute the AR 10484\ntopology at the location where flaring and blowout jets occurred from 21 to 24\nOctober 2003. This topology can consistently explain the origin of these\nevents.\n", "  A number of transition disks exhibit significant azimuthal asymmetries in\nthermal dust emission. One possible origin for these asymmetries is dust\ntrapping in vortices formed at the edges of dead zones. We carry out\nhigh-resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of this scenario,\nincluding the effects of dust feedback. We find that, although feedback weakens\nthe vortices and slows down the process of dust accumulation, the dust\ndistribution in the disk can nonetheless remain asymmetric for many thousands\nof orbits. We show that even after $10^4$ orbits, or $2.5$ Myr when scaled to\nthe parameters of Oph IRS 48 (a significant fraction of its age), the dust is\nnot dispersed into an axisymmetric ring, in contrast to the case of a vortex\nformed by a planet. This is because accumulation of mass at the dead zone edge\nconstantly replenishes the vortex, preventing it from being fully destroyed. We\nproduce synthetic dust emission images using our simulation results. We find\nthat multiple small clumps of dust may be distributed azimuthally. These\nclumps, if not resolved from one another, appear as a single large feature. A\ndefining characteristic of a disk with a dead zone edge is that an asymmetric\nfeature is accompanied by a ring of dust located about twice as far from the\ncentral star.\n", "  We compute the scattering amplitudes of four massless states for chiral\n(closed) bosonic and type II superstrings using the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye ($KLT$)\nfactorization method. The amplitude in the chiral bosonic case is identical to\na field theory amplitude corresponding to the spin-$2$ tachyon, massless\ngravitational sector and massive spin-2 tardyon states of the spectrum. Chiral\ntype II superstrings amplitude only possess poles associated with the massless\ngravitational sector. We briefly discuss the extension of the calculation to\nheterotic superstrings.\n", "  We study the measurement of transverse diffusion through beam echoes. We\nrevisit earlier observations of echoes in RHIC and apply an updated theoretical\nmodel to these measurements. We consider three possible models for the\ndiffusion coefficient and show that only one is consistent with measured echo\namplitudes and pulse widths. This model allows us to parameterize the diffusion\ncoefficients as functions of bunch charge. We demonstrate that echoes can be\nused to measure diffusion much quicker than present methods and could be useful\nto a variety of hadron synchrotrons.\n", "  The sophistication of current predictions for $Z+$jet production at hadron\ncolliders necessitates a re-evaluation of any approximations inherent in the\ntheoretical calculations. In this paper we address one such issue, the\ninclusion of mass effects in top-quark loops. We ameliorate an existing\ncalculation of $Z+1$~jet and $Z+2$~jet production by presenting exact analytic\nformulae for amplitudes containing top-quark loops that enter at\nnext-to-leading order in QCD. Although approximations based on an expansion in\npowers of $1/m_t^2$ can lead to poor high-energy behavior, an exact treatment\nof top-quark loops demonstrates that their effect is small and has limited\nphenomenological interest.\n", "  Aims: We study the acceleration of the stellar winds of rapidly rotating low\nmass stars and the transition between the slow magnetic rotator and fast\nmagnetic rotator regimes. We aim to understand the properties of stellar winds\nin the fast magnetic rotator regime and the effects of magneto-centrifugal\nforces on wind speeds and mass loss rates.\n  Methods: We extend the solar wind model of Johnstone et al. (2015b) to 1D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the winds of rotating stars. We test\ntwo assumptions for how to scale the wind temperature to other stars and assume\nthe mass loss rate scales as Mdot ~ Rstar^2 OmegaStar^1.33 Mstar^-3.36, in the\nunsaturated regime, as estimated by Johnstone et al. (2015a).\n  Results: For 1.0 Msun stars, the winds can be accelerated to several thousand\nkm/s, and the effects of magneto-centrifugal forces are much weaker for lower\nmass stars. We find that the different assumptions for how to scale the wind\ntemperature to other stars lead to significantly different mass loss rates for\nthe rapid rotators. If we assume a constant temperature, the mass loss rates of\nsolar mass stars do not saturate at rapid rotation, which we show to be\ninconsistent with observed rotational evolution. If we assume the wind\ntemperatures scale positively with rotation, the mass loss rates are only\ninfluenced significantly at rotation rates above 75 OmegaSun. We suggest that\nmodels with increasing wind speed for more rapid rotators are preferable to\nthose that assume a constant wind speed. If this conclusion is confirmed by\nmore sophisticated wind modelling. it might provide an interesting\nobservational constraint on the properties of stellar winds.\n", "  In entanglement computations for a free scalar field with coupling to\nbackground curvature, there is a boundary term in the modular Hamiltonian which\nmust be correctly specified in order to get sensible results. We focus here on\nthe entanglement in flat space across a planar interface and (in the case of\nconformal coupling) other geometries related to this one by Weyl rescaling of\nthe metric. For these \"half-space entanglement\" computations, we give a new\nderivation of the boundary term and revisit how it clears up a number of\npuzzles in the literature, including mass corrections and twist operator\ndimensions. We also discuss how related boundary terms may show up in other\nfield theories.\n", "  The advent of modern genome sequencing techniques allows for a more stringent\ntest of the neutrality hypothesis of Darwinian evolution, where all individuals\nhave the same fitness. Using the individual based model of Wright and Fisher,\nwe compute the amplitude of neutral aggregation in the genome space, i.e., the\nprobability of finding two individuals at genetic (hamming) distance k as a\nfunction of genome size L, population size N and mutation probability per base\n\\nu. In well mixed populations, we show that for N\\nu\\textless{}1/L, neutral\naggregation is the dominant force and most individuals are found at short\ngenetic distances from each other. For N\\nu\\textgreater{}1 on the contrary,\nindividuals are randomly dispersed in genome space. The results are extended to\ngeographically dispersed population, where the controlling parameter is shown\nto be a combination of mutation and migration probability. The theory we\ndevelop can be used to test the neutrality hypothesis in various ecological and\nevolutionary systems.\n", "  We propose and analyze a scheme for controlling coherent photon transmission\nand reflection in a cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED) system consisting of\nan optical resonator coupled with three-level atoms coherently prepared by a\ncontrol laser from free space. When the control laser is off and the cavity is\nexcited by two identical light fields from two ends of the cavity, the two\ninput light fields can be completely absorbed by the CQED system and the light\nenergy is converted into the excitation of the polariton states, but no light\ncan escape from the cavity. Two distinct cases of controlling the perfect\nphoton absorption are analyzed: (a) when the control laser is tuned to the\natomic resonance and creates electromagnetically induced transparency, the\nprefect photon absorption is suppressed and the input light fields are nearly\ncompletely transmitted through the cavity; (b) when the control laser is tuned\nto the polariton state resonance and inhibits the polariton state excitation,\nthe perfect photon absorption is again suppressed and the input light fields\nare nearly completely reflected from the cavity. Thus, the CQED system can act\nas a perfect absorber or near perfect transmitter/reflector by simply turning\noff or on of the control laser. Such interference control of the coherent\nphoton-atom interaction in the CQED system should be useful for a variety of\napplications in optical logical devices.\n", "  The four-dimensional effective theory for type IIB warped flux\ncompactifications proposed in [1] is completed by taking into account the\nbackreaction of the K\\\"ahler moduli on the three-form fluxes. The only required\nmodification consists in a flux-dependent contribution to the chiral fields\nparametrising the K\\\"ahler moduli. The resulting supersymmetric effective\ntheory satisfies the no-scale condition and consistently combines previous\npartial results present in the literature. Similar results hold for M-theory\nwarped compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds, whose effective field theory\nand K\\\"ahler potential are also discussed.\n", "  Fe3O4 (magnetite) is one of the most elusive quantum materials and at the\nsame time one of the most studied transition metal oxide materials for thin\nfilm applications. The theoretically expected half-metallic behavior generates\nhigh expectations that it can be used in spintronic devices. Yet, despite the\ntremendous amount of work devoted to preparing thin films, the enigmatic first\norder metal-insulator transition and the hall mark of magnetite known as the\nVerwey transition, is in thin films extremely broad and occurs at substantially\nlower temperatures as compared to that in high quality bulk single crystals.\nHere we have succeeded in finding and making a particular class of substrates\nthat allows the growth of magnetite thin films with the Verwey transition as\nsharp as in the bulk. Moreover, we are now able to tune the transition\ntemperature and, using tensile strain, increase it to substantially higher\nvalues than in the bulk.\n", "  Loop Quantum Cosmology is an appealing quantum completion of classical\ncosmology, which brings along various theoretical features which in many cases\noffer remedy or modify various classical cosmology aspects. In this paper we\naddress the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism in the context of Loop Quantum\nCosmology. As we demonstrate, when Loop Quantum Cosmology effects are taken\ninto account in the resulting Friedmann equations for a flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe, then even for a radiation dominated\nUniverse, the predicted baryon-to-entropy ratio from the gravitational\nbaryogenesis mechanism is non-zero, in contrast to the Einstein-Hilbert case,\nin which case the baryon-to-entropy ratio is zero. We also discuss various\nother cases apart from the radiation domination case, and we discuss how the\nbaryon-to-entropy ratio is affected from the parameters of the quantum theory.\nIn addition, we use illustrative exact solutions of Loop Quantum Cosmology and\nwe investigate under which circumstances the baryon-to-entropy ratio can be\ncompatible with the observational constraints.\n", "  The optoelectronic properties of amorphous conjugated polymers are sensitive\nto conformational disorder and spectroscopy provides the means for structural\ncharacterization of the fragments of the chain which interact with light -\n\"chromophores\". A faithful interpretation of spectroscopic conformational\nsignatures, however, presents a key challenge. We investigate the relationship\nbetween the ground state optical gaps, the properties of the excited states,\nand the structural features of chromophores of a single molecule\npoly(3-hexyl)-thiophene (P3HT), using quantum-classical atomistic simulations.\nOur results demonstrate that chromophoric disorder reflects an interplay\nbetween excited state de-localization and electron-hole polarization, and is\ncontrolled by torsional disorder that is specifically associated with the\npresence of side chains. Within this conceptual framework, we predict and\nexplain a counter-intuitive spectral signature of P3HT: a red-shifted\nabsorption, despite shortening of chromophores, with increasing temperature.\n", "  KMgBi single crystals are grown by using the Bi flux successfully. KMgBi\nshows semiconducting behavior with a metal-semiconductor transition at high\ntemperature region and a resistivity plateau at low temperature region,\nsuggesting KMgBi could be a topological insulator with a very small band gap.\nMoreover, KMgBi exhibits multiband feature with strong temperature dependence\nof carrier concentrations and mobilities.\n", "  Gravity-induced non-Gaussianity can provide important clues to Modified\nGravity (MG) Theories. Several recent studies have suggested using the {\\it\nIntegrated Bispectrum} (IB) as a probe for squeezed configuration of\nbispectrum. Extending previous studies on the IB, we include redshift-space\ndistortions to study a class of (parametrised) MG theories that include the\nstring-inspired Dvali, Gabadadze \\& Porrati (DGP) model. Various contributions\nfrom redshift-space distortions are derived in a transparent manner, and\nsqueezed contributions from these terms are derived separately. Results are\nobtained using the Zel'dovich Approximation (ZA). Results are also presented\nfor projected surveys (2D). We use the Press-Schechter (PS) and Sheth-Torman\n(ST) mass functions to compute the IB for collapsed objects that can readily be\nextended to peak-theory based approaches. The {\\em cumulant correlators} (CCs)\ngeneralise the ordinary {\\em cumulants} and are known to probe collapsed\nconfigurations of higher order correlation functions. We generalise the concept\nof CCs to halos of different masses. We also introduce a generating function\nbased approach to analyse more general non-local biasing models. The Fourier\nrepresentations of the CCs, the skew-spectrum, or the kurt-spctra are discussed\nin this context. The results are relevant for the study of the Minkowski\nFunctionals (MF) of collapsed tracers in redshift-space.} \\keywords {Cosmology,\nLarge Scale Structure, Modified Theories of Gravity\n", "  We study the nature of the flavor changing neutral couplings of the top quark\nwith the Higgs boson and the up/charm quark in the $t\\bar{t}$ production at\nlinear colliders. There are previous bounds on such tqH couplings at both,\nlinear and hadronic colliders, with the assumption that it couples equally to\nthe left and the right handed fermions. In this paper we examine the chirality\nof the tqH coupling and construct different observables which will be sensitive\nto it. The kinematics of the emitted q from t $\\rightarrow$ qH in $t\\bar{t}$\nproduction is discussed and it was found that the polar angle distribution of q\nis sensitive to the chiral nature of tqH couplings. The observables in the\ncontext of top-antitop spin correlations, which are sensitive to new physics in\nthe top decay are considered using different spin-quantization bases. It was\nfound that in particular the off-diagonal basis can be useful to distinguish\namong the chiral tqH couplings. The sensitivity of the unpolarized ILC in\nprobing the couplings at the 3$\\sigma$ level at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV and L =\n500 fb$^{-1}$ is also studied, resulting in predicted BR(t $\\rightarrow$ qH) <\n1.19 $\\times 10^{-3}$. This limit is further improved to BR(t $\\rightarrow$ qH)\n< 8.84 $\\times 10^{-4}$ with the inclusion of initial beam polarization of left\nhanded electrons and right handed positrons.\n", "  Studying the temporal variability of BL Lac objects at the highest energies\nprovides unique insights into the extreme physical processes occurring in\nrelativistic jets and in the vicinity of super-massive black holes. To this\nend, the long-term variability of the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 is analyzed in\nthe high (HE, 100 MeV < E < 300 GeV) and very high energy (VHE, E > 200 GeV)\ngamma-ray domain. Over the course of ~9 yr of H.E.S.S observations the VHE\nlight curve in the quiescent state is consistent with a log-normal behavior.\nThe VHE variability in this state is well described by flicker noise\n(power-spectral-density index {\\ss}_VHE = 1.10 +0.10 -0.13) on time scales\nlarger than one day. An analysis of 5.5 yr of HE Fermi LAT data gives\nconsistent results ({\\ss}_HE = 1.20 +0.21 -0.23, on time scales larger than 10\ndays) compatible with the VHE findings. The HE and VHE power spectral densities\nshow a scale invariance across the probed time ranges. A direct linear\ncorrelation between the VHE and HE fluxes could neither be excluded nor firmly\nestablished. These long-term-variability properties are discussed and compared\nto the red noise behavior ({\\ss} ~ 2) seen on shorter time scales during\nVHE-flaring states. The difference in power spectral noise behavior at VHE\nenergies during quiescent and flaring states provides evidence that these\nstates are influenced by different physical processes, while the compatibility\nof the HE and VHE long-term results is suggestive of a common physical link as\nit might be introduced by an underlying jet-disk connection.\n", "  The recent detection of planets around very low mass stars raises the\nquestion of the formation, composition and potential habitability of these\nobjects. We use planetary system formation models to infer the properties, in\nparticular their radius distribution and water content, of planets that may\nform around stars ten times less massive than the Sun. Our planetary system\nformation and composition models take into account the structure and evolution\nof the protoplanetary disk, the planetary mass growth by accretion of solids\nand gas, as well as planet-planet, planet-star and planet-disk interactions. We\nshow that planets can form at small orbital period in orbit about low mass\nstars. We show that the radius of the planets is peaked at about 1 rearth and\nthat they are, in general, volatile rich especially if proto-planetary discs\norbiting this type of stars are long-lived. Close-in planets orbiting low-mass\nstars similar in terms of mass and radius to the ones recently detected can be\nformed within the framework of the core accretion paradigm as modeled here. The\nproperties of protoplanetary disks, and their correlation with the stellar\ntype, are key to understand their composition.\n", "  Accurately weigh the masses of SMBH in AGN is currently possible for only a\nsmall group of local and bright broad-line AGN through reverberation mapping\n(RM). Statistical demographic studies can be carried out considering the\nempirical scaling relation between the size of the BLR and the AGN optical\ncontinuum luminosity. However, there are still biases against low-luminosity or\nreddened AGN, in which the rest-frame optical radiation can be severely\nabsorbed/diluted by the host and the BLR emission lines could be hard to\ndetect. Our purpose is to widen the applicability of virial-based SE relations\nto reliably measure the BH masses also for low-luminosity or intermediate/type\n2 AGN that are missed by current methodology. We achieve this goal by\ncalibrating virial relations based on unbiased quantities: the hard X-ray\nluminosities, in the 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV bands, that are less sensitive to\ngalaxy contamination, and the FWHM of the most important rest-frame NIR and\noptical BLR emission lines. We built a sample of RM AGN having both X-ray\nluminosity and broad optical/NIR FWHM measurements available in order to\ncalibrate new virial BH mass estimators. We found that the FWHM of the\nH$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ and NIR lines (i.e. Pa$\\alpha$, Pa$\\beta$ and\nHeI$\\lambda$10830) all correlate each other having negligible or small offsets.\nThis result allowed us to derive virial BH mass estimators based on either the\n2-10 keV or 14-195 keV luminosity. We took also into account the recent\ndetermination of the different virial coefficients $f$ for pseudo and classical\nbulges. By splitting the sample according to the bulge type and adopting\nseparate $f$ factors we found that our virial relations predict BH masses of\nAGN hosted in pseudobulges $\\sim$0.5 dex smaller than in classical bulges.\nAssuming the same average $f$ factor for both populations, a difference of\n$\\sim$0.2 dex is still found.\n", "  The damping of high momentum excitations in strongly coupled maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma is studied. Previous calculations of the\nasymptotic behavior of the quasinormal mode spectrum are extended and\nclarified. We confirm that subleading corrections to the lightlike dispersion\nrelation $\\omega({\\bf q}) = |{\\bf q}|$ have a universal $|{\\bf q}|^{-1/3}$\nform. Sufficiently narrow, weak planar shocks may be viewed as coherent\nsuperpositions of short wavelength quasinormal modes. The attenuation and\nevolution in profile of narrow planar shocks are examined as an application of\nour results.\n", "  \\color{blue}{In the wake of efforts made in [EPL {\\bf 97}, 41001 (2012)] and\n[J.

This makes it possible to generate a\nputative conjecture regarding black matter. Our theory reduces to the usual FT\nfor $q\\rightarrow 1$.}\n", "  Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) methods utilizing resonant mechanical\nvibrations of cantilevers in contact with a sample surface have shown\nsensitivities as high as few picometers for detecting surface displacements.\nSuch a high sensitivity is harnessed in several AFM imaging modes. Here, we\ndemonstrate a cantilever-resonance-based method to quantify electrostatic\nforces on a probe arising in the presence of a surface potential or when a bias\nvoltage is applied to the AFM probe. We find that the electrostatic forces\nacting on the probe tip apex can strongly dominate cantilever response in\nelectromechanical measurements and produce signals equivalent to few pm of\nsurface displacement. In combination with modeling, the measurements of the\nforce were used to determine the strength of the electrical field at the probe\ntip apex in contact with a sample. We find an evidence that the electric field\nstrength in the junctions is limited by about 0.5 V/nm. This field can be\nsufficiently strong to significantly influence material states and kinetic\nprocesses through charge injection, Maxwell stress, shifts of phase equilibria,\nand reduction of energy barriers for activated processes. Besides, the results\nprovide a baseline for accounting for the effects of local electrostatic forces\nin electromechanical AFM measurements as well as offer additional means to\nprobe ionic mobility and field-induced phenomena in solids.\n", "  The slow-roll approximation is an analytical approach to study dynamical\nproperties of the inflationary universe. In this article, systematic\nconstruction of the slow-roll expansion for effective loop quantum cosmology is\npresented. The analysis is performed up to the fourth order in both slow-roll\nparameters and the parameter controlling the strength of deviation from the\nclassical case. The expansion is performed for three types of the slow-roll\nparameters: Hubble slow-roll parameters, Hubble flow parameters and potential\nslow-roll parameters. An accuracy of the approximation is verified by\ncomparison with the numerical phase space trajectories for the case with a\nmassive potential term. The results obtained in this article may be helpful in\nthe search for the subtle quantum gravitational effects with use of the\ncosmological data.\n", "  We study the topologically twisted compactification of the 6d $(2,0)$\nM5-brane theory on an elliptically fibered K\\\"ahler three-fold preserving two\nsupercharges. We show that upon reducing on the elliptic fiber, the 4d theory\nis $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang Mills, with varying complexified coupling $\\tau$,\nin the presence of defects. For abelian gauge group this agrees with the\nso-called duality twisted theory, and we determine a non-abelian generalization\nto $U(N)$. When the elliptic fibration is singular, the 4d theory contains 3d\nwalls (along the branch-cuts of $\\tau$) and 2d surface defects, around which\nthe 4d theory undergoes $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ duality transformations. Such\nduality defects carry chiral fields, which from the 6d point of view arise as\nmodes of the two-form $B$ in the tensor multiplet. Each duality defect has a\nflavor symmetry associated to it, which is encoded in the structure of the\nsingular elliptic fiber above the defect. Generically 2d surface defects will\nintersect in points in 4d, where there is an enhanced flavor symmetry. The 6d\npoint of view provides a complete characterization of this 4d-3d-2d-0d\n`Matroshka'-defect configuration.\n", "  Classical lattice Yang-Mills calculations provide a good way to understand\ndifferent nonequilibrium phenomena in nonperturbatively overoccupied systems.\nAbove the Debye scale the classical theory can be matched smoothly to kinetic\ntheory. The aim of this work is to study the limits of this quasiparticle\npicture by determining the plasmon mass in classical real time Yang-Mills\ntheory on a lattice in 3 spatial dimensions. We compare three methods to\ndetermine the plasmon mass: a hard thermal loop expression in terms of the\nparticle distribution, an effective dispersion relation constructed from fields\nand their time derivatives, and by measuring oscillations between electric and\nmagnetic field modes after artificially introducing a homogeneous color\nelectric field. We find that a version of the dispersion relation that uses\nelectric fields and their time derivatives agrees with the other methods within\n50%.\n", "  We have measured the spin injection efficiency and spin lifetime in\nCo$_2$FeSi/$n$-GaAs lateral nonlocal spin valves from 20 to 300 K. We observe\nlarge ($\\sim$40 $\\mu$V) spin valve signals at room temperature and injector\ncurrents of $10^3~$A/cm$^2$, facilitated by fabricating spin valve separations\nsmaller than the 1 $\\mu$m spin diffusion length and applying a forward bias to\nthe detector contact. The spin transport parameters are measured by comparing\nthe injector-detector contact separation dependence of the spin valve signal\nwith a numerical model accounting for spin drift and diffusion. The apparent\nsuppression of the spin injection efficiency at the lowest temperatures\nreflects a breakdown of the ordinary drift-diffusion model in the regime of\nlarge spin accumulation. A theoretical calculation of the D'yakonov-Perel spin\nlifetime agrees well with the measured $n$-GaAs spin lifetime over the entire\ntemperature range.\n", "  We investigate multi-lepton signals produced by ElectroWeakino (EWino) decays\nin the MSSM and the TMSSM scenarios with sfermions, gluinos and non Standard\nModel Higgses at the TeV scale, being the Bino electroweak-scale dark matter.\nWe recast the present LHC constraints on EWinos for these models and we find\nthat wide MSSM and TMSSM parameter regions prove to be allowed. We forecast the\nnumber of events expected in the signal regions of the experimental\nmulti-lepton analyses in the next LHC runs. The correlations among these\nnumbers will help to determine whether future deviations in multi-lepton data\nare ascribable to the EWinos, as well as the supersymmetric model they\noriginate from.\n", "  Seismic observations have shown that a number of evolved stars exhibit\nlow-amplitude dipole modes, which are referred to as depressed modes. Recently,\nthese low amplitudes have been attributed to the presence of a strong magnetic\nfield in the stellar core of those stars.\n  We intend to study the properties of depressed modes in evolved stars, which\nis a necessary condition before concluding on the physical nature of the\nmechanism responsible for the reduction of the dipole mode amplitudes.\n  We perform a thorough characterization of the global seismic parameters of\ndepressed dipole modes and show that these modes have a mixed character. The\nobservation of stars showing dipole mixed modes that are depressed is\nespecially useful for deriving model-independent conclusions on the dipole mode\ndamping.\n  Observations prove that depressed dipole modes in red giants are not pure\npressure modes but mixed modes. This result invalidates the hypothesis that the\ndepressed dipole modes result from the suppression of the oscillation in the\nradiative core of the stars. Observations also show that, except for the\nvisibility, the seismic properties of the stars with depressed modes are\nequivalent to those of normal stars.\n  The mixed nature of the depressed modes in red giants and their unperturbed\nglobal seismic parameters carry strong constraints on the physical mechanism\nresponsible for the damping of the oscillation in the core. This mechanism is\nable to damp the oscillation in the core but cannot fully suppress it.\nMoreover, it cannot modify the radiative cavity probed by the gravity component\nof the mixed modes. The recent mechanism involving high magnetic field proposed\nfor explaining depressed modes is not compliant with the observations and\ncannot be used to infer the strength and the prevalence of high magnetic fields\nin red giants.\n", "  The possibility to engineer the coupling of spin and valley physics is\nexplored in ferroelectric oxide heterostructures with eg electronic\nconfiguration. We show that the polar structural distortion induces the\nappearance of spin-valley coupled properties, at the same time being\nresponsible for a topological transition from a quantum spin-Hall insulating\nphase to a trivial band insulator. The coupled spin-valley physics is affected\nby the topological band inversion in a non-trivial way; while the\nvalley-dependent spin polarization of both conduction and valence bands is\npreserved, a change of the Berry curvature and of spin-valley selection rules\nis predicted, leading to different circular dichroic response as well as valley\nand spin Hall effects.\n", "  Scanning-probe magnetometry is a valuable experimental tool to investigate\nmagnetic phenomena at the micro- and nanoscale. We theoretically analyze the\npossibility of measuring magnetic fields via the electrical current flowing\nthrough quantum dots. We characterize the shot-noise-limited magnetic-field\nsensitivity of two devices: a single dot in the Coulomb blockade regime, and a\ndouble dot in the Pauli blockade regime. Constructing such magnetometers using\ncarbon nanotube quantum dots would benefit from the large, strongly anisotropic\nand controllable g tensors, the low abundance of nuclear spins, and the small\ndetection volume allowing for nanoscale spatial resolution; we estimate that a\nsensitivity below $1 \\, \\mu\\text{T}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ can be achieved with this\nmaterial. As quantum dots have already proven to be useful as scanning-probe\nelectrometers, our proposal highlights their potential as hybrid sensors having\nin situ switching capability between electrical and magnetic sensing.\n", "  Background: Ab initio many-body methods have been developed over the past ten\nyears to address mid-mass nuclei... As progress in the design of inter-nucleon\ninteractions is made, further efforts must be made to tailor many-body methods.\n  Methods: We formulate a truncated configuration interaction method that\nconsists of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a highly truncated subspace of the\ntotal N-body Hilbert space. The reduced Hilbert space is generated via the\nparticle-number projected BCS state along with projected seniority-zero two and\nfour quasi-particle excitations. Furthermore, the extent by which the\nunderlying BCS state breaks U(1) symmetry is optimized in presence of the\nprojected two and four quasi-particle excitations... The quality of the newly\ndesigned method is tested against exact solutions of the so-called attractive\npairing Hamiltonian problem.\n  Results: By construction, the method reproduce exact results for N=2 and N=4.\nFor N=(8,16,20) the error on the ground-state correlation energy is less than\n(0.006, 0.1, 0.15) % across the entire range of inter-nucleon coupling defining\nthe pairing Hamiltonian and driving the normal-to-superfluid quantum phase\ntransition. The presently proposed method offers the advantage to automatically\naccess the low-lying spectroscopy, which it does with high accuracy.\n  Conclusions: The numerical cost of the newly designed variational method is\npolynomial (N$^6$) in system size. It achieves an unprecedented accuracy on the\nground-state correlation energy, effective pairing gap and one-body entropy as\nwell as on the excitation energy of low-lying states of the attractive pairing\nHamiltonian. This constitutes a strong enough motivation to envision its\napplication to realistic nuclear Hamiltonians in view of providing a\ncomplementary, accurate and versatile ab initio description of mid-mass\nopen-shell nuclei in the future.\n", "  We derive a semi-analytical form for the Wigner transform for the canonical\ndensity operator of a discrete system coupled to a harmonic bath based on the\npath integral expansion of the Boltzmann factor. The introduction of this\nsimple and controllable approach allows for the exact rendering of the\ncanonical distribution and permits systematic convergence of static properties\nwith respect to the number of path integral steps. In additions, the\nexpressions derived here provide an exact and facile interface with quasi- and\nsemi-classical dynamical methods, which enables the direct calculation of\nequilibrium time correlation functions within a wide array of approaches. We\ndemonstrate that the present method represents a practical path for the\ncalculation of thermodynamic data for the spin-boson and related systems. We\nillustrate the power of the present approach by detailing the improvement of\nthe quality of Ehrenfest theory for the correlation function\n$\\mathcal{C}_{zz}(t) = \\mathrm{Re}\\langle \\sigma_z(0)\\sigma_z(t)\\rangle$ for\nthe spin-boson model with systematic convergence to the exact sampling\nfunction. Importantly, the numerically exact nature of the scheme presented\nhere and its compatibility with semiclassical methods allows for the systematic\ntesting of commonly used approximations for the Wigner-transformed canonical\ndensity.\n", "  In this note, we study the $\\mathcal{Q}$-cut representation by combining it\nwith BCFW deformation. As a consequence, the one-loop integrand is expressed in\nterms of a recursion relation, i.e., $n$-point one-loop integrand is\nconstructed using tree-level amplitudes and $m$-point one-loop integrands with\n$m\\leq n-1$. By giving explicit examples, we show that the integrand from the\nrecursion relation is equivalent to that from Feynman diagrams or the original\n$\\mathcal{Q}$-cut construction, up to scale free terms.\n", "  We present an in-depth analysis regarding the error resistance and\noptimization of our all-optical Bell measurement and ultrafast long-distance\nquantum communication scheme proposed in [arXiv:1503.06777]. In order to\npromote our previous proposal from loss- to fault-tolerance, we introduce a\ngeneral and compact formalism that can also be applied to other related schemes\n(including non-all-optical ones such as [PRL 112, 250501]). With the help of\nthis new representation we show that our communication protocol does not only\ncounteract the inevitable photon loss during channel transmission, but is also\nable to resist common experimental errors such as Pauli-type errors (bit- and\nphase-flips) and detector inefficiencies (losses and dark counts). Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that on the physical level of photonic qubits the choice of the\nstandard linear optical Bell measurement with its limited efficiency is optimal\nfor our setting in the sense that, apart from their potential use in state\npreparation, more advanced Bell measurements yield only a small decrease in\nresource consumption. We devise two state generation schemes that provide the\nrequired ancillary encoded Bell states (quasi-)on-demand at every station. The\nschemes are either based on nonlinear optics or on linear optics with\nmultiplexing and exhibit resource costs that scale linearly or less than\nquadratic with the number of photons per encoded qubit, respectively. Finally,\nwe show that it is possible to operate our communication scheme with on-off\ndetectors instead of employing photon-number-resolving detectors.\n", "  CANARY is the multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) on-sky pathfinder developed\nin the perspective of Multi-Object Spectrograph on Extremely Large\nTelescopes~(ELTs). In 2013, CANARY was operated on-sky at the William Herschel\ntelescope~(WHT), using three off-axis natural guide stars~(NGS) and four\noff-axis Rayleigh laser guide stars~(LGS), in open-loop, with the on-axis\ncompensated turbulence observed with a H-band imaging camera and a Truth\nwave-front sensor~(TS) for diagnostic purposes. Our purpose is to establish a\nreliable and accurate wave-front error breakdown for LGS MOAO. This will enable\na comprehensive analysis of \\cana on-sky results and provide tools for\nvalidating simulations of MOAO systems for ELTs. To evaluate the MOAO\nperformance, we compared the CANARY on-sky results running in MOAO, in Single\nConjugated Adaptive Optics~(SCAO) and in Ground Layer Adaptive Optics~(GLAO)\nmodes, over a large set of data acquired in 2013. We provide a statistical\nstudy of the seeing. We also evaluated the wave-front error breakdown from both\nanalytic computations, one based on a MOAO system modelling and the other on\nthe measurements from the CANARY TS. We have focussed especially on the\ntomographic error and we detail its vertical error decomposition~(VED). We show\nthat CANARY obtained 30.1\\%, 21.4\\% and 17.1\\% H-band Strehl ratios in SCAO,\nMOAO and GLAO respectively, for median seeing conditions with 0.66\" of total\nseeing including 0.59\" at the ground. Moreover, we get 99\\% of correlation over\n4,500 samples, for any AO modes, between two analytic computations of residual\nphase variance. Based on these variances, we obtain a reasonable\nStrehl-ratio~(SR) estimation when compared to the measured IR image SR. We\nevaluate the gain in compensation for the altitude turbulence brought by MOAO\nwhen compared to GLAO.\n", "  We consider thermal production mechanisms of self-interacting dark matter in\nmodels with gauged $Z_3$ symmetry. A complex scalar dark matter is stabilized\nby the $Z_3$, that is the remnant of a local dark $U(1)_d$. Light dark matter\nwith large self-interaction can be produced from thermal freeze-out in the\npresence of SM-annihilation, SIMP and/or forbidden channels. We show that dark\nphoton and/or dark Higgs should be relatively light for unitarity and then\nassist the thermal freeze-out. We identify the constraints on the parameter\nspace of dark matter self-interaction and mass in cases that one or some of the\nchannels are important in determining the relic density.\n", "  Symplectic tracking is important in accelerator beam dynamics simulation. So\nfar, to the best of our knowledge, there is no self-consistent symplectic\nspace-charge tracking model available in the accelerator community. In this\npaper, we present a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional symplectic\nmulti-particle spectral model for space-charge tracking simulation. This model\nincludes both the effect from external fields and the effect of self-consistent\nspace-charge fields using a split-operator method. Such a model preserves the\nphase space structure and shows much less numerical emittance growth than the\nparticle-in-cell model in the illustrative examples.\n", "  We propose a method to manipulate the normal modes in a chain of trapped ions\nusing only two lasers. Linear chains of trapped ions have proven experimentally\nto be highly controllable quantum systems with a variety of refined techniques\nfor preparation, evolution, and readout, however, typically for quantum\ninformation processing applications people have been interested in using the\ninternal levels of the ions as the computational basis. We analyse the case\nwhere the motional degrees of freedom of the ions is the quantum system of\ninterest, and where the internal levels are leveraged to facilitate\ninteractions. In particular, we focus on an analysis of mode-mixing of phonons\nin different normal modes to mimic the quantum optical equivalent of a beam\nsplitter.\n", "  Stellar evolution models of massive stars are very sensitive to the adopted\nmass-loss scheme. The magnitude and evolution of mass-loss rates significantly\naffect the main sequence evolution, and the properties of post-main sequence\nobjects, including their rotational velocities. Driven by potential\ndiscrepancies between theoretically predicted and observationally derived\nmass-loss rates in the OB star range, we particularly aim to investigate the\nresponse to mass-loss rates that are lower than currently adopted, in parallel\nwith the mass-loss behavior at the \"first\" bi-stability jump. We perform 1D\nhydrodynamical model calculations of single $20 - 60 \\, M_{\\odot}$ Galactic ($Z\n= 0.014$) stars where the effects of stellar winds are already significant\nduring the main sequence phase. We develop an experimental wind routine to\nexamine the behavior and response of the models under the influence of\ndifferent mass-loss rates. This observationally guided, simple and flexible\nwind routine is not a new mass-loss description but a useful tool based on the\nWind-momentum Luminosity Relation and other scaling relations, and provides a\nmeaningful base for various tests and comparisons. The main result of this\nstudy indicates a dichotomy when accounting for currently debated problems\nregarding mass-loss rates of hot massive stars. In a fully diffusive approach,\nand for commonly adopted initial rotational velocities, lower mass-loss rates\nthan theoretically predicted require to invoke an additional source of angular\nmomentum loss (either due to bi-stability braking, or yet unidentified) to\nbrake down surface rotational velocities. [...]\n", "  The coupling of the charge carriers passing through a molecule bridging two\nbulky conductors with local vibrational modes of the molecule, gives rise to\ndistinct features in the electronic transport properties on one hand, and to\nnonequilibrium features in the vibrations' properties, e.g., their population,\non the other. Here we explore theoretically a generic model for a molecular\njunction biased by an arbitrary dc voltage in the weak-coupling regime. We\nanalyze the signature of the electron-vibration interaction on the\nfull-counting statistics of the current fluctuations (i.e., the cumulant\ngenerating-function of the current correlations), we give a detailed account of\nthe response to an ac field exerted on the junction (on top of the dc bias\nvoltage), we study the nonequilibrium distribution of the vibrational modes and\nthe fluctuations they cause in the displacement of the molecule center of mass.\nThe calculations use the technique of nonequilibrium Green's functions, and\ntreat the electron-vibration coupling in perturbation theory, within the\nrandom-phase approximation when required.\n", "  We have used high resolution transmission spectroscopy to study the exciton\nlevel spectrum in Cu$_2$O subject to a longitudinal external electric field,\ni.e., in the geometry where the transmitted light is propagating along the\nfield direction. Different experimental configurations given by the field\norientation relative to the crystal and the light polarization have been\nexplored. We focus on the range of small principal quantum numbers $n \\leq 7$.\nThe number of exciton states belonging to a particular principal quantum number\nincreases with $n$, leading to an enhanced complexity of the spectra. Still, in\nparticular for $n = 3 \\ldots 5$ a spectral separation of the different lines is\nfeasible and identification as well as assignment of the dominant state\ncharacter are possible. We find a strong dependence of the spectra on the\nchosen light propagation direction and polarization configuration, reflecting\nthe inadequacy of the hydrogen model for describing the excitons. With\nincreasing the field excitonic states with different parity become mixed,\nleading to optical activation of states that are dark in zero field. As\ncompared with atoms, due to the reduced Rydberg energy states with different\n$n$ can be brought into resonance in the accessible electric field strength\nrange. When this occurs, we observe mostly crossing of levels within the\nexperimental accuracy showing that the electron and hole motion remains\nregular. The observed features are well described by detailed calculations\naccounting for the spin-orbit coupling, the cubic anisotropy effects, and the\nsymmetry-imposed optical selection rules.\n", "  We calculate the half-chain entanglement entropy of the ground state in the\none-dimensional spinless fermion model. Considering a tiny corner of the\nHilbert space represented by matrix product states, we efficiently find the\nground state by the infinite time-evolving block decimation. The Schmidt\ncoefficients are used to determine the half-chain entanglement entropy. Using\nthe bond dimension scaling of the half-chain entanglement entropy, we find the\ncritical region, which is consistent with the previous results.\n", "  Magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs) contain a white dwarf with magnetic\nfield strong enough to control the accretion flow from a late type secondary.\nIn this paper, we discover a magnetic CV (CXOGSG J215544.4+380116) from the\n$Chandra$ archive data. The X-ray light curves show a significant period of\n14.1 ks, and the X-ray spectra can be described by a multi-temperature hot\nthermal plasma, suggesting the source as a magnetic CV. The broad dip in the\nX-ray light curve is due to the eclipse of the primary magnetic pole, and the\nadditional dip in the bright phase of the soft and medium bands may be caused\nby the accretion stream crossing our line of sight to the primary pole.\nFollow-up optical spectra show features of an M2--M4 dwarf dominating the red\nband and a WD which is responsible for the weak upturn in the blue band. The\nmass ($\\sim$ 0.4 $M_{\\odot}$) and radius ($\\sim$ 0.4 $R_{\\odot}$) for the M\ndwarf are obtained using CV evolution models and empirical relations between\nthe orbital period and the mass/radius. The estimated low X-ray luminosity and\naccretion rate may suggest the source as a low-accretion-rate polar. In\naddition, Very Large Array observations reveal a possible radio counterpart to\nthe X-ray source, but with a low significance. Further radio observations with\nhigh quality are needed to confirm the radio counterpart and explore the\nproperties of this binary system.\n", "  The response properties of excitable systems driven by colored noise are of\ngreat interest, but are usually mathematically only accessible via\napproximations. For this reason, dichotomous noise, a rare example of a colored\nnoise leading often to analytically tractable problems, has been extensively\nused in the study of stochastic systems. Here, we calculate exact expressions\nfor the power spectrum and the susceptibility of a leaky integrate-and-fire\nneuron driven by asymmetric dichotomous noise. While our results are in\nexcellent agreement with simulations, they also highlight a limitation of using\ndichotomous noise as a simple model for more complex fluctuations: Both power\nspectrum and susceptibility exhibit an undamped periodic structure, the origin\nof which we discuss in detail.\n", "  Quantum master equations form an important tool in the description of\ntransport problems in open quantum systems. However, they suffer from the\ndifficulty that the shape of the Lindblad dissipator depends sensibly on the\nsystem Hamiltonian. Consequently, most of the work done in this field has\nfocused on phenomenological dissipators which act locally on different parts of\nthe system. In this paper we show how to construct Lindblad dissipators for\nquantum many-body systems starting from a microscopic theory of the system-bath\ninteraction. We consider specifically a one-dimensional bosonic tight-binding\nchain connected to two baths at the first and last site, kept at different\ntemperatures and chemical potentials. We then shown that, even though the bath\ncoupling is local, the effective Lindblad dissipator stemming from this\ninteraction is inherently non-local, affecting all normal modes of the system.\nWe then use this formalism to study the current of particles and energy through\nthe system and find that they have the structure of Landauer's formula, with\nthe bath spectral density playing the role of the transfer integral. Finally,\nwe consider infinitesimal temperature and chemical potential gradients and show\nthat the currents satisfy Onsager's reciprocal relations, which is a\nconsequence of the fact that the microscopic quantum dynamics obeys detailed\nbalance.\n", "  We continue to investigate the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ deformations of\nfour-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) labeled\nby a nilpotent element of the flavor symmetry. This triggers a renormalization\ngroup (RG) flow to an $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT. We systematically analyze all\npossible deformations of this type for certain classes of $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nSCFTs: conformal SQCDs, generalized Argyres-Douglas theories and the $E_6$\nSCFT. We find a number of examples where the amount of supersymmetry gets\nenhanced to $\\mathcal{N}=2$ at the end point of the RG flow. Most notably, we\nfind that the $SU(N)$ and $Sp(N)$ conformal SQCDs can be deformed to flow to\nthe Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories of type $(A_1, D_{2N-1})$ and $(A_1, D_{2N})$\nrespectively. This RG flow therefore allows us to compute the full\nsuperconformal index of the $(A_1,D_N)$ class of AD theories. Moreover, we find\nan infrared duality between $\\mathcal{N}=1$ theories where the fixed point is\ndescribed by an $\\mathcal{N}=2$ AD theory. We observe that the classes of\nexamples that exhibit supersymmetry enhancement saturate certain bounds for the\ncentral charges implied by the associated two-dimensional chiral algebra.\n", "  We present a two-dimensional multi-component photometric decomposition of 404\ngalaxies from the CALIFA Data Release 3. They represent all possible galaxies\nwith no clear signs of interaction and not strongly inclined in the final\nCALIFA data release. Galaxies are modelled in the g, r, and i SDSS images\nincluding, when appropriate, a nuclear point source, bulge, bar, and an\nexponential or broken disc component. We use a human-supervised approach to\ndetermine the optimal number of structures to be included in the fit. The\ndataset, including the photometric parameters of the CALIFA sample, is released\ntogether with statistical errors and a visual analysis of the quality of each\nfit. The analysis of the photometric components reveals a clear segregation of\nthe structural composition of galaxies with stellar mass. At high masses\n(log(Mstar/Msun)>11), the galaxy population is dominated by galaxies modelled\nwith a single Sersic or a bulge+disc with a bulge-to-total (B/T) luminosity\nratio B/T>0.2. At intermediate masses (9.5<log(Mstar/Msun)<11), galaxies\ndescribed with bulge+disc but B/T < 0.2 are preponderant, whereas, at the low\nmass end (log(Mstar/Msun)<9.5), the prevailing population is constituted by\ngalaxies modelled with either pure discs or nuclear point sources+discs (i.e.,\nno discernible bulge). We obtain that 57% of the volume corrected sample of\ndisc galaxies in the CALIFA sample host a bar. This bar fraction shows a\nsignificant drop with increasing galaxy mass in the range\n9.5<log(Mstar/Msun)<11.5. The analyses of the extended multi-component radial\nprofile result in a volume-corrected distribution of 62%, 28%, and 10% for the\nso-called Type I, Type II, and Type III disc profiles, respectively. These\nfractions are in discordance with previous findings. We argue that the\ndifferent methodologies used to detect the breaks are the main cause for these\ndifferences.\n", "  The Schmidt law (SF law) in the Milky Way was investigated using 3D\ndistribution maps of HII regions, HI and molecular (\\Htwo) gases with spatial\nresolutions of $\\sim 1$ kpc in the Galactic plane and a few tens of pc in the\nvertical direction. HII regions were shown to be distributed in a star-forming\n(SF) disk with nearly constant vertical full thickness 92 pc in spatial\ncoincidence with the molecular gas disk. The vertically averaged volume star\nformation rate (SFR) $\\rho_{\\rm SFR}$ in the SF disk is related to the surface\nSFR $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ by $\\rho_{\\rm SFR} /[{\\rm M_\\odot y^{-1} kpc^{-3}}]\n=9.26\\times \\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}/[{\\rm M_\\odot y^{-1} kpc^{-2}}]$. The SF law\nfitted by a single power law of gas density in the form of $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}\n\\propto \\rho_{\\rm SFR} \\propto \\rho_{\\rm gas}^\\alpha$ and $\\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm\ngas}^\\beta$ showed indices of $\\alpha=0.78 \\pm 0.05$ for $\\rho_{\\rm H_2}$ and\n$2.15 \\pm 0.08$ for $\\rho_{\\rm total}$, and $\\beta=1.14\\pm 0.23$ for\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm total}$, where $\\rho$ and $\\Sigma$ denote volume and surface\ndensities, respectively. The star formation rate is shown to be directly\nrelated to the molecular gas, but indirectly to HI and total gas densities. The\ndependence of the SF law on the gaseous phase is explained by the phase\ntransition theory between HI and H$_2$ gases.\n", "  For a general understanding of the physics involved in the star formation\nprocess, measurements of physical parameters such as temperature and density\nare indispensable. The chemical and physical properties of dense clumps of\nmolecular clouds are strongly affected by the kinetic temperature. Therefore,\nthis parameter is essential for a better understanding of the interstellar\nmedium. Formaldehyde, a molecule which traces the entire dense molecular gas,\nappears to be the most reliable tracer to directly measure the gas kinetic\ntemperature.We aim to determine the kinetic temperature with spectral lines\nfrom formaldehyde and to compare the results with those obtained from ammonia\nlines for a large number of massive clumps.Three 218 GHz transitions\n(JKAKC=303-202, 322-221, and 321-220) of para-H2CO were observed with the 15m\nJames Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) toward 30 massive clumps of the Galactic\ndisk at various stages of high-mass star formation. Using the RADEX non-LTE\nmodel, we derive the gas kinetic temperature modeling the measured para-H2CO\n322-221/303-202and 321-220/303-202 ratios. The gas kinetic temperatures derived\nfrom the para-H2CO (321-220/303-202) line ratios range from 30 to 61 K with an\naverage of 46 K. A comparison of kinetic temperature derived from para-H2CO,\nNH3, and the dust emission indicates that in many cases para-H2CO traces a\nsimilar kinetic temperature to the NH3 (2,2)/(1,1) transitions and the dust\nassociated with the HII regions. Distinctly higher temperatures are probed by\npara-H2CO in the clumps associated with outflows/shocks. Kinetic temperatures\nobtained from para-H2CO trace turbulence to a higher degree than NH3\n(2,2)/(1,1) in the massive clumps. The non-thermal velocity dispersions of\npara-H2CO lines are positively correlated with the gas kinetic temperature. The\nmassive clumps are significantly influenced by supersonic non-thermal motions.\n", "  We consider the leading and subleading UV divergences for the four-point\non-shell scattering amplitudes in D=6,8,10 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories\nin the planar limit. These theories belong to the class of maximally\nsupersymmetric gauge theories and presumably possess distinguished properties\nbeyond perturbation theory. In the previous works, we obtained the recursive\nrelations that allow one to get the leading and subleading divergences in all\nloops in a pure algebraic way. The all loop summation of the leading\ndivergences is performed with the help of the differential equations which are\nthe generalization of the RG equations for non-renormalizable theories. Here we\nmainly focus on solving and analyzing these equations. We discuss the\nproperties of the obtained solutions and interpretation of the results.\n", "  Aims: We provide a new distance estimate for the Pleiades based on the moving\ncluster method, which will be useful to further discuss the so-called Pleiades\ndistance controversy and compare it with the very precise parallaxes from the\nGaia space mission.\n  Methods: We apply a refurbished implementation of the convergent point search\nmethod to an updated census of Pleiades stars to calculate the convergent point\nposition of the cluster from stellar proper motions. Then, we derive individual\nparallaxes for 64 cluster members using radial velocities compiled from the\nliterature, and approximate parallaxes for another 1146 stars based on the\nspatial velocity of the cluster. This represents the largest sample of Pleiades\nstars with individual distances to date.\n  Results: The parallaxes derived in this work are in good agreement with\nprevious results obtained in different studies (excluding Hipparcos) for\nindividual stars in the cluster. We report a mean parallax of $7.44\\pm\n0.08$~mas and distance of $134.4^{+2.9}_{-2.8}$pc that is consistent with the\nweighted mean of $135.0\\pm 0.6$pc obtained from the non-Hipparcos results in\nthe literature.\n  Conclusions: Our result for the distance to the Pleiades open cluster is not\nconsistent with the Hipparcos catalog, but favors the recent and more precise\ndistance determination of $136.2\\pm 1.2$pc obtained from Very Long Baseline\nInterferometry observations. It is also in good agreement with the mean\ndistance of $133\\pm 5$pc obtained from the first trigonometric parallaxes\ndelivered by the Gaia satellite for the brightest cluster members in common\nwith our sample.\n", "  We extend the coupling to the topological backgrounds, recently worked out\nfor the 2-dimensional BF-model, to the most general Poisson sigma models. The\ncoupling involves the choice of a Casimir function on the target manifold and\nmodifies the BRST transformations. This in turn induces a change in the BRST\ncohomology of the resulting theory. The observables of the coupled theory are\nanalyzed and their geometrical interpretation is given. We finally couple the\ntheory to 2-dimensional topological gravity: this is the first step to study a\ntopological string theory in propagation on a Poisson manifold. As an\napplication, we show that the gauge-fixed vectorial supersymmetry of the\nPoisson sigma models has a natural explanation in terms of the theory coupled\nto topological gravity.\n", "  The real-time broadening of density profiles starting from non-equilibrium\nstates is at the center of transport in condensed-matter systems and dynamics\nin ultracold atomic gases. Initial profiles close to equilibrium are expected\nto evolve according to linear response, e.g., as given by the current\ncorrelator evaluated exactly at equilibrium. Significantly off equilibrium,\nlinear response is expected to break down and even a description in terms of\ncanonical ensembles is questionable. We unveil that single pure states with\ndensity profiles of maximum amplitude yield a broadening in perfect agreement\nwith linear response, if the structure of these states involves randomness in\nterms of decoherent off-diagonal density-matrix elements. While these states\nallow for spin diffusion in the XXZ spin-1/2 chain at large exchange\nanisotropies, coherences yield entirely different behavior.\n", "  We investigate the phase diagram of dirty two-band superconductors. This\npaper primarily focuses on the properties and observability of the\ntime-reversal symmetry-breaking $s+is$ superconducting states, which can be\ngenerated in two-band superconductors by interband impurity scattering. We show\nthat such states can appear in two distinct ways. First, according to a\npreviously discussed scenario, the $s+is$ state can form as an intermediate\nphase at the impurity-driven crossover between $s_{\\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.\nWe show that there is a second scenario where domains of the $s+is$ state\nexists in the form of an isolated dome inside the $s_{\\pm}$ domain, completely\ndetached from the transition between $s_{\\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states. We\ndemonstrate that in both cases the $s+is$ state, generated by impurity\nscattering exists in an extremely small interval of impurity concentrations.\nAlthough this likely precludes direct experimental observation of the $s+is$\nstate formation due to this mechanism, this physics leads to the appearance of\na region inside both the $s_{\\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ domains with unusual properties\ndue to softening of normal modes.\n", "  We examine anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents in the critical O(N)\nscalar model and the Gross-Neveu model in arbitrary d dimensions. These two\nmodels are proposed to be dual to the type A and type B Vasiliev theories,\nrespectively. We reproduce the known results on the anomalous dimensions to the\nleading order in 1/N by using conformal perturbation theory. This work can be\nregarded as an extension of previous work on the critical O(N) scalars in 3\ndimensions, where it was shown that the bulk computation for the masses of\nhigher spin fields on AdS_4 can be mapped to the boundary one in conformal\nperturbation theory. The anomalous dimensions of the both theories agree with\neach other up to an overall factor depending only on d, and we discuss the\ncoincidence for d=3 by utilizing N=2 supersymmetry.\n", "  Zero temperature limit in (1+1) directed polymers with finite range\ncorrelated random potential is studied. In terms of the standard replica\ntechnique it is demonstrated that in this limit the considered system reveals\nthe one-step replica symmetry breaking structure similar to the one which takes\nplace in the Random Energy Model. In particular, it is shown that at the\ntemperature $T_{*} \\sim (u R)^{1/3}$ (where $u$ and $R$ are the strength and\nthe correlation length of the random potential) there is a crossover from the\nhigh- to the low-temperature regime. Namely, in the high-temperature regime at\n$T >> T_{*}$ the model is equivalent to the one with the $\\delta$-correlated\npotential where the non-universal prefactor of the free energy is proportional\nto $T^{-2/3}$, while at $T << T_{*}$ this non-universal prefactor saturates at\na finite (temperature independent) value.\n", "  (Abridged) Understanding stellar activity in M dwarfs is crucial for the\nphysics of stellar atmospheres as well as for ongoing radial velocity exoplanet\nprogrammes. Despite the increasing interest in M dwarfs, our knowledge of the\nchromospheres of these stars is far from being complete. We aim to test whether\nthe relations between activity, rotation, and stellar parameters and flux-flux\nrelationships also hold for early-M dwarfs on the main-sequence. We analyse in\nan homogeneous and coherent way a well defined sample of 71 late-K/early-M\ndwarfs that are currently being observed in the framework of the HArps-n red\nDwarf Exoplanet Survey (HADES). Rotational velocities are derived using the\ncross-correlation technique while emission flux excesses in the Ca II H & K and\nBalmer lines from Halpha up to Hepsilon are obtained by using the spectral\nsubtraction technique. The relationships between the emission excesses and the\nstellar parameters are studied. Relations between pairs of fluxes of different\nchromospheric lines are also studied. We find that the strength of the\nchromospheric emission in the Ca II H & K and Balmer lines is roughly constant\nfor stars in the M0-M3 spectral range. Our data suggest that a moderate but\nsignificant correlation between activity and rotation might be present as well\nas a hint of kinematically selected young stars showing higher levels of\nemission. We find our sample of M dwarfs to be complementary in terms of\nchromospheric and X-ray fluxes with those of the literature, extending the\nanalysis of the flux-flux relationships to the very low flux domain. Our\nresults agree with previous works suggesting that the activity-rotation-age\nrelationship known to hold for solar-type stars also applies to early-M dwarfs.\nWe also confirm previous findings that the field stars which deviate from the\nbulk of the empirical flux-flux relationships show evidence of youth.\n", "  The electromagnetic responses of carbon obtained from the Green's function\nMonte Carlo and spectral function approaches using the same dynamical input are\ncompared in the kinematical region corresponding to momentum transfer in the\nrange 300-570 MeV. The results of our analysis, aimed at pinning down the\nlimits of applicability of the approximations involved in the two schemes,\nindicate that the factorization ansatz underlying the spectral function\nformalism provides remarkably accurate results down to momentum transfer as low\nas 300 MeV. On the other hand, it appears that at 570 MeV relativistic\ncorrections to the electromagnetic current not included in the Monte Carlo\ncalculations may play a significant role in the transverse channel.\n", "  A search for Pauli-exclusion-principle-violating K-alpha electron transitions\nwas performed using 89.5 kg-d of data collected with a p-type point contact\nhigh-purity germanium detector operated at the Kimballton Underground Research\nFacility. A lower limit on the transition lifetime of 5.8x10^30 seconds at 90%\nC.L. was set by looking for a peak at 10.6 keV resulting from the x-ray and\nAuger electrons present following the transition. A similar analysis was done\nto look for the decay of atomic K-shell electrons into neutrinos, resulting in\na lower limit of 6.8x10^30 seconds at 90 C.L. It is estimated that the MAJORANA\nDEMONSTRATOR, a 44 kg array of p-type point contact detectors that will search\nfor the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76-Ge, could improve upon these\nexclusion limits by an order of magnitude after three years of operation.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the scattering effect on entanglement propagation in\nRCFTs. In our setup, we consider the time evolution of excited states created\nby the insertion of many local operators. Our results show that because of the\nfiniteness of quantum dimension, entanglement is not changed after the\nscattering in RCFTs. In this mean, entanglement is conserved after the\nscattering event in RCFTs, which reflects the integrability of the system. Our\nresults are also consistent with the free quasiparticle picture after the\nglobal quenches.\n", "  We compute the entanglement entropy of the Wilson-Fisher conformal field\ntheory (CFT) in 2+1 dimensions with O($N$) symmetry in the limit of large $N$\nfor general entanglement geometries. We show that the leading large $N$ result\ncan be obtained from the entanglement entropy of $N$ Gaussian scalar fields\nwith their mass determined by the geometry. For a few geometries, the universal\npart of the entanglement entropy of the Wilson-Fisher CFT equals that of a CFT\nof $N$ massless scalar fields. However, in most cases, these CFTs have a\ndistinct universal entanglement entropy even at $N=\\infty$. Notably, for a\nsemi-infinite cylindrical region it scales as $N^0$, in stark contrast to the\n$N$-linear result of the Gaussian fixed point.\n", "  One of the fundamental results used in observational cosmology is the\ndistance duality relation (DDR), which relates the luminosity distance, $D_L$,\nwith angular diameter distance, $D_A$, at a given redshift $z$. We employ the\nobserved limits of this relation to constrain the coupling of axion like\nparticles (ALPs) with photons. With our detailed $3D$ ALP-photon mixing\nsimulation in standard $\\Lambda$CDM universe and latest DDR limits observed in\nHoland \\& Barros (2016) we limit the coupling constant $g_{\\phi}\\le 6 \\times\n10^{-13} GeV^{-1}\\left(\\frac{nG}{\\langle B \\rangle_{\\rm Mpc}}\\right)$ for ALPs\nof mass $\\le 10^{-15}$ eV. The DDR observations can provide very stringent\nconstraint on ALPs mixing in future. Also any deviation in DDR can be\nconventionally explained as photons decaying to axions or vice-versa.\n", "  Finding numerical solutions describing bubble nucleation is notoriously\ndifficult in more than one field space dimension. Traditional shooting methods\nfail because of the extreme non-linearity of field evolution over a macroscopic\ndistance as a function of initial conditions. Minimization methods tend to\nbecome either slow or imprecise for larger numbers of fields due to their\ndependence on the high dimensionality of discretized function spaces. We\npresent a new method for finding solutions which is both very efficient and\nable to cope with the non-linearities. Our method directly integrates the\nequations of motion except at a small number of junction points, so we do not\nneed to introduce a discrete domain for our functions. The method, based on\nmultiple shooting, typically finds solutions involving three fields in under a\nminute, and can find solutions for eight fields in about an hour. We include a\nnumerical package for Mathematica which implements the method described here.\n", "  We utilise the LHC Run-1 and -2 Higgs data to constrain the CP-violating\ntop-Higgs couplings. In order to satisfy the current full Higgs data sets at\n$2\\sigma$ level, the CP-odd component $C^p_t$ and the CP-even component $C^s_t$\nhave to be within the ranges $|C^p_t|< 0.37$ and $0.85 <C^s_t< 1.20$,\nrespectively, which is stronger than the LHC Run-1 bound $|C^p_t|< 0.54$ and\n$0.68 <C^s_t< 1.20$. With the new bound, we explore the impact on the\nCP-violating top-Higgs couplings in the Higgs production processes $pp \\to\nt\\bar{t}h, thj, hh$ at 13 TeV LHC, and $e^+e^- \\to hZ, h\\gamma$ at future 240\nGeV Higgs factories. We find that the cross sections of $pp \\to t\\bar{t}h$, $pp\n\\to thj$, $pp \\to hh$, $e^+e^- \\to hZ$ and $e^+e^- \\to h\\gamma$ can be enhanced\nup to 1.41, 1.18, 2.20, 1.001 and 1.09 times as large as the SM predictions,\nrespectively. The future precision measurement of the process $e^+e^- \\to\nh\\gamma$ with an accuracy of 5\\% will be able to constrain $|C^p_t|<0.19$ at\nmost at a 240 GeV $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory.\n", "  We study the semiclassical holographic correspondence between 2d CFT n-point\nconformal blocks and massive particle configurations in the asymptotically AdS3\nspace. On the boundary we use the heavy-light approximation in which case two\nof primary operators are the background for the other (n-2) operators\nconsidered as fluctuations. In the bulk the particle dynamics can be reduced to\nthe hyperbolic time slice. Although lacking exact solutions we nevertheless\nshow that for any n the classical n-point conformal block is equal to the\nlength of the dual geodesic network connecting n-3 cubic vertices of worldline\nsegments. To this end, both the bulk and boundary systems are reformulated as\npotential vector fields. Gradients of the conformal block and geodesic length\nare given respectively by accessory parameters of the monodromy problem and\nparticle momenta of the on-shell worldline action represented as a function of\ninsertion points. We show that the accessory parameters and particle momenta\nare constrained by two different algebraic equation systems which nevertheless\nhave the same roots thereby guaranteeing the correspondence.\n", "  Optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers are\ncontrolled by the Wannier-Mott excitons forming a series of $1s$, $2s$,\n$2p$,... hydrogen-like states. We develop the theory of the excited excitonic\nstates energy spectrum fine structure. We predict that $p$- and $s$-shell\nexcitons are mixed due to the specific $D_{3h}$ point symmetry of the\ntransition metal dichalcogenide monolayers. Hence, both $s$- and $p$-shell\nexcitons are active in both single- and two-photon processes providing an\nefficient mechanism of second harmonic generation. The corresponding\ncontribution to the nonlinear susceptibility is calculated.\n", "  We present AIA observations of a structure we interpret as a current sheet\nassociated with an X4.9 flare and coronal mass ejection that occurred on\n2014~February~25 in NOAA Active Region 11990. We characterize the properties of\nthe current sheet, finding that the sheet remains on the order of a few\nthousand km thick for much of the duration of the event and that its\ntemperature generally ranged between $8-10\\,\\mathrm{MK}$. We also note the\npresence of other phenomena believed to be associated with magnetic\nreconnection in current sheets, including supra-arcade downflows and shrinking\nloops. We estimate that the rate of reconnection during the event was $M_{A}\n\\approx 0.004-0.007$, a value consistent with model predictions. We conclude\nwith a discussion of the implications of this event for reconnection-based\neruption models.\n", "  The water at the proposed site of the CHIPS water Cherenkov detector has been\nstudied to measure its attenuation length for Cherenkov light as a function of\nfiltering time. A scaled model of the CHIPS detector filled with water from the\nWentworth 2W pit, proposed site of the CHIPS deployment, in conjunction with a\n3.2\\unit{m} vertical column filled with this water, was used to study the\ntransmission of 405nm laser light. Results consistent with attenuation lengths\nof up to 100m were observed for this wavelength with filtration and UV\nsterilization alone.\n", "  Symplectic and optical joint probability representations of quantum mechanics\nare considered, in which the functions describing the states are the\nprobability distributions with all random arguments (except the argument of\ntime ). The general formalism of quantizers and dequantizers determining the\nstar product quantization scheme in these representations is given. Taking the\nGaussian functions as the distributions of the tomographic parameters the\ncorrespondence rules for most interesting physical operators are found and the\nexpressions of the dual symbols of operators in the form of singular and\nregular generalized functions are derived. Evolution equations and stationary\nstates equations for symplectic and optical joint probability distributions are\nobtained.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the simulation of continuous-time quantum walks\non specific classes of graphs, for which it is possible to fast-forward the\ntime-evolution operator to achieve constant-time simulation complexity and to\nperform the simulation exactly, while maintaining $\\mbox{poly}(\\mbox{log}(n))$\nefficiency. In particular, we discuss two classes of composite graphs,\ncommuting graphs and Cartesian product of graphs, that contain classes of\ngraphs which can be simulated in this fashion. This allows us to identify new\nfamilies of graphs that we can efficiently simulate in a quantum circuit\nframework, providing practical and explicit means to explore quantum-walk based\nalgorithms in laboratories.\n", "  The kinematic space could play a key role in constructing the bulk geometry\nfrom dual CFT. In this paper, we study the kinematic space from geometric\npoints of view, without resorting to differential entropy. We find that the\nkinematic space could be intrinsically defined in the embedding space. For each\noriented geodesic in the Poincar\\'e disk, there is a corresponding point in the\nkinematic space. This point is the tip of the causal diamond of the disk whose\nintersection with the Poincar\\'e disk determines the geodesic. In this\ngeometric construction, the causal structure in the kinematic space can be seen\nclearly. Moreover, we find that every transformation in the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$\nleads to a geodesic in the kinematic space. In particular, for a hyperbolic\ntransformation defining a BTZ black hole, it is a timelike geodesic in the\nkinematic space. We show that the horizon length of the static BTZ black hole\ncould be computed by the geodesic length of corresponding points in the\nkinematic space. Furthermore, we discuss the fundamental regions in the\nkinematic space for the BTZ blackhole and multi-boundary wormholes.\n", "  We propose an analytical model for the force-indentation relationship in\nviscoelastic materials exhibiting a power law relaxation described by an\nexponent n, where n = 1 represents the standard viscoelastic solid (SLS) model,\nand n < 1 represents a fractional SLS model. To validate the model, we perform\nnanoindentation measurements of poylacrylamide gels with atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) force curves. We found exponents n < 1 that depends on the\nbysacrylamide concentration. We also demonstrate that the fitting of AFM force\ncurves for varying load speeds can reproduce the dynamic viscoelastic\nproperties of those gels measured with dynamic force modulation methods.\n", "  Over the past two decades, large strides have been made in the field of\nplanet formation. Yet fundamental questions remain. Here we review our state of\nunderstanding of five fundamental bottlenecks in planet formation. These are:\n1) the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks; 2) the growth of the\nfirst planetesimals; 3) orbital migration driven by interactions between\nproto-planets and gaseous disk; 4) the origin of the Solar System's orbital\narchitecture; and 5) the relationship between observed super-Earths and our own\nterrestrial planets. Given our lack of understanding of these issues, even the\nmost successful formation models remain on shaky ground.\n", "  We have experimentally investigated the quench dynamics of antiferromagnetic\nspinor Bose-Einstein condensates in the vicinity of a zero temperature quantum\nphase transition at zero quadratic Zeeman shift $q$. The rate of instability\nshows good agreement with predictions based upon solutions to the Bogoliubov\nde-Gennes equations. A key feature of this work was removal of magnetic field\ninhomogeneities, resulting in a steep change in behavior near the transition\npoint. The quadratic Zeeman shift at the transition point was resolved to 250\nmilliHertz uncertainty, equivalent to an energy resolution of $k_B \\times 12$\npicoKelvin. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of sub-Hz\nprecision measurement of a phase transition in quantum gases. Our results point\nto the use of dynamics, rather than equilibrium studies for high precision\nmeasurements of phase transitions in quantum gases.\n", "  Using density functional tight-binding method, we studied the effect of grain\nboundaries on the mechanical properties and failure behavior of phosphorene. We\nfound that the large angle tilt boundaries with a higher density of (5|7)\ndefect pairs (oriented along the AC direction) are stronger than the low-angle\ntilt boundaries with a lower defect density, and similarly the large angle\nboundaries with a higher density of (4|8) defect pairs (oriented along the ZZ\ndirection) are stronger than the low-angle boundaries with a lower defect\ndensity. The failure is due to the rupture of the most pre-strained bonds in\nthe heptagons of the (5|7) defect pair or octagons of the (4|8) pairs. The\nlarge-angle grain boundaries are better off in accommodating the pre-strained\nbonds in heptagons and octagons defects, leading to a higher failure stress and\nstrain. The results cannot be described by Griffith-type fracture mechanics\ncriterion since it does not take into account the bond pre-stretching.\nInterestingly, these anomalous mechanical and failure characteristics of tilt\ngrain boundaries in phosphorene are also shared by graphene and hexagonal\nborn-nitride, signifying that they may be universal for 2D materials. The\nfindings revealed here may be useful in tuning the mechanical properties of\nphosphorene via defect engineering for specific applications.\n", "  We have computed the fourth-order nf^2 contributions to all three non-singlet\nquark-quark splitting functions and their four nf^3 flavour-singlet\ncounterparts for the evolution of the parton distributions of hadrons in\nperturbative QCD with nf effectively massless quark flavours. The analytic form\nof these functions is presented in both Mellin N-space and momentum-fraction\nx-space; the large-x and small-x limits are discussed. Our results agree with\nall available predictions derived from lower-order information. The large-x\nlimit of the quark-quark cases provides the complete nf^2 part of the four-loop\ncusp anomalous dimension which agrees with two recent partial computations.\n", "  Markarian 501 is a high-peaked BL Lacertae object and has undergone many\nmajor outburst since its discovery in 1996. As a part of the multiwavelength\ncampaign, in the year 2009 this blazar was observed for 4.5 months from March 9\nto August 1 and during the period April 17 to May 5 it was observed by both\nspace and ground based observatories covering the entire electromagnetic\nspectrum. A very strong high energy $\\gamma$-ray flare was observed on May 1 by\nWhipple telescope in the energy range 317 GeV to 5 TeV and the flux was about\n10 times higher than the baseline flux. We use the photohadronic model\ncomplimented by the extragalactic background radiation (EBL) correction to this\nvery high state flare and have shown that the EBL plays an important role in\nattenuating the very high energy flux even though Markarian 501 is in the local\nUniverse.\n", "  Fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges are sensitive observables\nfor studying the QCD phase transition and critical point in high-energy\nheavy-ion collisions. We have studied the centrality and energy dependence of\nmixed-cumulants (up to fourth order) between net-baryon and net-strangeness in\nAu+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200 GeV\nfrom UrQMD model. To compare with other theoretical calculations, we normalize\nthese mixed-cumulants by various order cumulants of net-strangeness\ndistributions. We found that the results obtained from UrQMD calculations are\ncomparable with the results from Lattice QCD at low temperature and hadron\nresonance gas model. The ratios of mixed-cumulants\n($R_{11}^{BS},R_{13}^{BS},R_{22}^{BS}$,~$R_{31}^{BS}$) from UrQMD calculations\nshow weak centrality dependence. However, the mixed-cumulant ratios\n$R_{11}^{BS}$ and $R_{31}^{BS}$ show strong increase at low energy, while the\n$R_{13}^{BS}$ snd $R_{22}^{BS}$ are similar at different energies. Furthermore,\nwe have also studied the correlations between different hadron species and\ntheir contributions to the net-baryon and net-strangeness correlations. These\nmodels studies can provide baselines for searching for the signals of QCD phase\ntransition and critical point in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  The observation of a charged-lepton flavor violating process would be a\ndefinite sign for physics beyond the Standard Model, but would actually only\nprove that one particular linear combination of lepton numbers is violated. We\ncategorize lepton-flavor-violating processes by their quantum numbers and show\nhow their discovery can be interpreted model independently, studying in\nparticular which processes are required to establish that the entire flavor\ngroup is broken. We also comment on total lepton number, seeing as lepton\nnumber violation practically implies lepton flavor violation as well.\n", "  The Neptune-mass GJ 436b is one of the most-studied transiting exoplanets\nwith repeated measurements of both its thermal emission and transmission\nspectra. We build on previous studies to answer outstanding questions about\nthis planet, including its potentially high metallicity and tidal heating of\nits interior. We present new observations of GJ 436b's thermal emission at 3.6\nand 4.5 micron, which reduce uncertainties in estimates of GJ 436b's flux at\nthose wavelengths and demonstrate consistency between Spitzer observations\nspanning more than 7 years. We analyze the Spitzer thermal emission photometry\nand Hubble WFC3 transmission spectrum in tandem. We use a powerful dual-pronged\nmodeling approach, comparing these data to both self-consistent and retrieval\nmodels. We vary the metallicity, intrinsic luminosity from tidal heating,\ndisequilibrium chemistry, and heat redistribution. We also study the effect of\nclouds and photochemical hazes on the spectra, but do not find strong evidence\nfor either. The self-consistent and retrieval modeling combine to suggest that\nGJ 436b has a high atmospheric metallicity, with best fits at or above several\nhundred times solar metallicity, tidal heating warming its interior with\nbest-fit intrinsic effective effective temperatures around 300--350 K, and\ndisequilibrium chemistry. High metal-enrichments (>600x solar) can only occur\nfrom the accretion of rocky, rather than icy, material. Assuming Tint~300--350\nK, we find that Q'~2x10^5--10^6, larger than Neptune's Q', and implying a long\ntidal circularization timescale for the planet's orbit. We suggest that\nNeptune-mass planets may be a more diverse class than previously imagined, with\nmetal-enhancements potentially spanning several orders of magnitude, to perhaps\nover 1000x solar metallicity. High fidelity observations with instruments like\nJWST will be critical for characterizing this diversity.\n", "  We revisit the calculation of the six-gluon remainder function in planar\n$\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory from the strong coupling TBA in the\nmulti-Regge limit and identify an infinite set of kinematically subleading\nterms. These new terms can be compared to the strong coupling limit of the\nfinite-coupling expressions for the impact factor and the BFKL eigenvalue\nproposed by Basso et al. in arXiv:1407.3766, which were obtained from an\nanalytic continuation of the Wilson loop OPE. After comparing the results order\nby order in those subleading terms, we show that it is possible to precisely\nmap both formalisms onto each other. A similar calculation can be carried out\nfor the seven-gluon amplitude, the result of which shows that the central\nemission vertex does not become trivial at strong coupling.\n", "  Several massive early-type binaries exhibit non-thermal emission which has\nbeen attributed to synchrotron radiation from particles accelerated by\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in the wind-collision region (WCR). If the\nmagnetic field in the strong shocks is ordered, its component parallel to the\nshock front should be enhanced, and the resultant synchrotron radiation would\nbe polarized. However, such polarization has never been measured. We performed\nspatially-unresolved radio continuum observations of WR 146, a well known a\nWC6+O8 system, at 5 cm and 20 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. No\nlinearly polarized radio emission was detected. The data constrain the\nfractional linear polarization to less than 0.6% between 1 to 8 GHz. This is\ncompatible with a high level of turbulence and a dominant random component in\nthe magnetic field. In this case the relativistic particles could be produced\nby turbulent magnetic reconnection (MR). In order for this scenario to satisfy\nthe required non-thermal energy budget, we find through numerical modeling that\nthe strength of the magnetic field in the WCR must be as high as ~150 mG.\nHowever, if the magnetic field is ordered and DSA is ongoing, then a\ncombination of internal and external Faraday rotation could equally account for\nthe depolarization of the emission. It is not clear whether it is possible to\ndevelop the high level of turbulence and strong magnetic fields required for\nefficient MR in a long-period binary such as WR 146. This scenario might also\nhave trouble explaining the low-frequency cutoff in the spectrum. We therefore\nfavor a scenario where particles are accelerated through DSA and the\ndepolarization is produced by mechanisms other than a large ratio between\nrandom to regular magnetic fields.\n", "  The field of ultracold quantum matter has burgeoned over the last few\ndecades, thanks to the growing capabilities for atomic systems to be probed and\nmanipulated with exquisite control. Researchers can now precisely create and\nstudy quantum many-body states that are effectively isolated from the external\nenvironment. Much of the work in ultracold matter has focused on systems of\nalkali or alkaline-earth atoms, mainly due to their ease of cooling. Extending\nthis precise control to molecules has seen rapidly increasing interest and\nactivity, as molecules possess additional degrees of freedom that make them\nuseful for tests of fundamental physics, studying ultracold chemistry and\ncollisions, and engineering qualitatively new types of quantum phases and\nquantum many-body systems. Here, we review one particularly fruitful research\ndirection: the creation and manipulation of ultracold bialkali molecules. The\nrecent success in creating a quantum gas of polar molecules opens many exciting\nresearch opportunities.\n", "  We set up a formalism, within the antenna subtraction framework, for\ncomputing the production of a massive quark-antiquark pair in electron positron\ncollisions at next-to-next-to-leading order in the coupling $\\alpha_s$ of\nquantum chromodynamics at the differential level. Our formalism applies to the\ncalculation of any infrared-safe observable. We apply this set-up to the\nproduction of top-quark top antiquark pairs in the continuum. We compute the\nproduction cross section and several distributions. We determine, in\nparticular, the top-quark forward-backward asymmetry at order $\\alpha_s^2$. Our\nresult agrees with previous computations of this observable.\n", "  Self-diffusion and interdiffusion coefficients of binary ionic mixtures are\nevaluated using the Effective Potential Theory (EPT), and the predictions are\ncompared with the results of molecular dynamics simulations. We find that EPT\nagrees with molecular dynamics from weak coupling well into the strong coupling\nregime, which is a similar range of coupling strengths as previously observed\nin comparisons with the one-component plasma. Within this range, typical\nrelative errors of approximately 20% and worst-case relative errors of\napproximately 40% are observed. We also examine the Darken model, which\napproximates the interdiffusion coefficients based on the self-diffusion\ncoefficients.\n", "  We consider the ${\\cal N}=1$ superpotential generated in type-II orientifold\nmodels by non-geometric fluxes. In particular, we focus on the family of $P$\nfluxes, that are related by T-duality transformations to the S-dual of the $Q$\nflux. We determine the general rule that transforms a given flux in this family\nunder a single T-duality transformation. This rule allows to derive a complete\nexpression for the superpotential for both the IIA and the IIB theory for the\nparticular case of a $T^6/[\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 ]$ orientifold. We\nthen consider how these fluxes modify the generalised Bianchi identities. In\nparticular, we derive a fully consistent set of quadratic constraints coming\nfrom the NS-NS Bianchi identities. On the other hand, the $P$ flux Bianchi\nidentities induce tadpoles, and we determine a set of exotic branes that can be\nconsistently included in order to cancel them. This is achieved by determining\na universal transformation rule under T-duality satisfied by all the branes in\nstring theory.\n", "  We analyse the thermodynamic properties of a generalised Dicke model, i.e. a\ncollection of three-level systems interacting with two bosonic modes. We show\nthat at finite temperatures the system undergoes first-order phase transitions\nonly, which is in contrast to the zero-temperature case where a second-order\nphase transition exist as well. We discuss the free energy and prominent\nexpectation values. The limit of vanishing temperature is discussed as well.\n", "  In an era of large spectroscopic surveys of stars and big data, sophisticated\nstatistical methods become more and more important in order to infer\nfundamental stellar parameters such as mass and age. Bayesian techniques are\npowerful methods because they can match all available observables\nsimultaneously to stellar models while taking prior knowledge properly into\naccount. However, in most cases it is assumed that observables are uncorrelated\nwhich is generally not the case. Here, we include correlations in the Bayesian\ncode BONNSAI by incorporating the covariance matrix in the likelihood function.\nWe derive a parametrisation of the covariance matrix that, in addition to\nclassical uncertainties, only requires the specification of a correlation\nparameter that describes how observables co-vary. Our correlation parameter\ndepends purely on the method with which observables have been determined and\ncan be analytically derived in some cases. This approach therefore has the\nadvantage that correlations can be accounted for even if information for them\nare not available in specific cases but are known in general. Because the new\nlikelihood model is a better approximation of the data, the reliability and\nrobustness of the inferred parameters are improved. We find that neglecting\ncorrelations biases the most likely values of inferred stellar parameters and\naffects the precision with which these parameters can be determined. For\nexample, we apply our technique to massive OB stars, but emphasise that it is\nvalid for any type of stars. For effective temperatures and surface gravities\ndetermined from atmosphere modelling, we find that masses can be underestimated\non average by $0.5\\sigma$ and mass uncertainties overestimated by a factor of\nabout 2 when neglecting correlations. At the same time, the age precisions are\nunderestimated over a wide range of stellar parameters. [abridged]\n", "  The minimal $SO(5)/SO(4)$ sigma model is used as a template for the\nultraviolet completion of scenarios in which the Higgs particle is a low-energy\nremnant of some high-energy dynamics, enjoying a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson\nancestry. Varying the $\\sigma$ mass allows to sweep from the perturbative\nregime to the customary non-linear implementations. The low-energy benchmark\neffective non-linear Lagrangian for bosons and fermions is obtained,\ndetermining as well the operator coefficients including linear corrections. At\nfirst order in the latter, three effective bosonic operators emerge which are\nindependent of the explicit soft breaking assumed. The Higgs couplings to\nvector bosons and fermions turn out to be quite universal: the linear\ncorrections are proportional to the explicit symmetry breaking parameters.\nFurthermore, we define an effective Yukawa operator which allows a simple\nparametrization and comparison of different heavy fermion ultraviolet\ncompletions. In addition, one particular fermionic completion is explored in\ndetail, obtaining the corresponding leading low-energy fermionic operators.\n", "  This review covers recent results concerning the estimation of large\ncovariance matrices using tools from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We introduce\nseveral RMT methods and analytical techniques, such as the Replica formalism\nand Free Probability, with an emphasis on the Marchenko-Pastur equation that\nprovides information on the resolvent of multiplicatively corrupted noisy\nmatrices. Special care is devoted to the statistics of the eigenvectors of the\nempirical correlation matrix, which turn out to be crucial for many\napplications. We show in particular how these results can be used to build\nconsistent \"Rotationally Invariant\" estimators (RIE) for large correlation\nmatrices when there is no prior on the structure of the underlying process. The\nlast part of this review is dedicated to some real-world applications within\nfinancial markets as a case in point. We establish empirically the efficacy of\nthe RIE framework, which is found to be superior in this case to all previously\nproposed methods. The case of additively (rather than multiplicatively)\ncorrupted noisy matrices is also dealt with in a special Appendix. Several open\nproblems and interesting technical developments are discussed throughout the\npaper.\n", "  We analyze dynamics of the AdS$_{N+1}$ particle realized on the coset\nSO$(2,N)/$SO$(1,N)$. Hamiltonian reduction provides the physical phase space in\nterms of the coadjoint orbit obtained by boosting a timelike element of ${\\frak\nso}(2,N)$. We show equivalence of this approach to geometric quantization and\nto the SO$(N)$ covariant oscillator description, for which the boost generators\nentail a complicated operator ordering. As an alternative scheme, we introduce\ndual oscillator variables and derive their algebra at the classical and the\nquantum level. This simplifies the calculations of the commutators for the\nboost generators and leads to unitary irreducible representations of ${\\frak\nso}(2,N)$ for all admissible values of the mass parameter. We furthermore\ndiscuss an SO$(N)$ covariant supersymmetric extensions of the oscillator\nquantization, with its realization for superparticles in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_3$\ngiven by recent works.\n", "  We report the crystal structure and highly-anisotropic magnetic, transport\nand thermal properties of an exceptionally good single crystal of\nU(Ru0.92Rh0.08)2Si2 prepared using a modified Czochralski method. Our study,\nthat also includes neutron diffraction results, shows all the heavy-fermion\nsignatures of pristine URu2Si2 , however, the superconductivity, hidden order\nand remanent weak antiferromagnetic orders are absent. Instead, the ground\nstate of the doped system can be classified as a spin liquid that preserves the\nheavy-fermion character. U(Ru0.92Rh0.08)2Si2 exhibits a short-range magnetic\norder distinguished by reflections of a Lorentzian profile at qIII = (1/2 1/2\n1/2) positions that disappear above approx. 15 K. The short-range order seems\nto be a precursor of a long-range magnetic order that occurs with higher Rh\nconcentration. We indicate that these short-range fluctuations involve, at\nleast partially, inelastic scattering processes.\n", "  We introduce a multi-species generalization of the symmetric simple exclusion\nprocess with open boundaries. This model possesses the property of being\nintegrable and appears as physically relevant because the boundary conditions\ncan be interpreted as the interaction with particles reservoirs with fixed\ndensities of each species. The system is driven out-of-equilibrium by these\nreservoirs. The steady state is analytically computed in a matrix product form.\nThis algebraic structure allows us to obtain exact expressions for the mean\nparticle currents and for the one and two-point correlation functions. An\nadditivity principle is also derived from the matrix ansatz and permits the\ncomputation of the large deviation functional of the density profile. We also\npropose a description of the model in the context of the macroscopic\nfluctuation theory and we check the consistency with the exact computations\nfrom the finite size lattice.\n", "  Multiterminal Josephson junctions have recently been proposed as a route to\nartificially mimic topological matter with the distinct advantage that its\nproperties can be controlled via the superconducting phase difference, giving\nrise to Weyl points in 4-terminal geometries. A key goal is to accurately\ndetermine when the system makes a transition from a gapped to non-gapped state\nas a function of the phase differences in the system, the latter effectively\nplaying the role of quasiparticle momenta in conventional topological matter.\nWe here determine the proximity gap phase diagram of diffusive n-terminal\nJosephson junctions, both numerically and analytically, by identifying a class\nof solutions to the Usadel equation at zero energy in the full proximity effect\nregime. We present an analytical equation which provides the phase diagram for\nan arbitrary number of terminals n. After briefly demonstrating the validity of\nthe analytical approach in the previously studied 2- and 3-terminal cases, we\nfocus on the 4-terminal case and map out the regimes where the electronic\nexcitations in the system are gapped and non-gapped, respectively,\ndemonstrating also in this case full agreement between the analytical and\nnumerical approach.\n", "  We present expressions for the kinematic endpoints of 5-body cascade decay\nchains proceeding through all possible combinations of 2-body and 3-body\ndecays, with one stable invisible particle in the final decay stage. When an\ninvariant mass can be formed in multiple ways by choosing different final state\nparticles from a common vertex, we introduce techniques for finding the\nsub-leading endpoints for all indistinguishable versions of the invariant mass.\nIn contrast to short decay chains, where sub-leading endpoints are linearly\nrelated to the leading endpoints, we find that in 5-body decays, they provide\nadditional independent constraints on the mass spectrum.\n", "  People have probably been watching the sky since the beginning of human\nhistory. Observers in pre-telescopic ages recorded anomalous events and these\nastronomical records in the historical documents provide uniquely valuable\ninformation for modern scientists. Records with drawings are particularly\nuseful, as the verbal expressions recorded by pre-telescopic observers, who did\nnot know the physical nature of the phenomena, are often ambiguous. However,\ndrawings for specific datable events in the historical documents are much fewer\nthan the verbal records. Therefore, in this paper, we show the possible\nearliest drawings of datable auroras and a two-tail comet in a manuscript of\nthe Chronicle of Z\\=uqn\\=in, a Syriac chronicle up to 775/776 CE to interpret\ntheir nature. They provide not only the historical facts in the realm around\nAmida but also information about low-latitude aurora observations due to\nextreme space weather events and the existence of sun-grazing comets.\n", "  The distribution of exoplanets around low-mass stars is still not well\nunderstood. Such stars, however, present an excellent opportunity of reaching\ndown to the rocky and habitable planet domains. The number of current\ndetections used for statistical purposes is still quite modest and different\nsurveys, using both photometry and precise radial velocities, are searching for\nplanets around M dwarfs. Our HARPS-N red dwarf exoplanet survey is aimed at the\ndetection of new planets around a sample of 78 selected stars, together with\nthe subsequent characterization of their activity properties. Here we\ninvestigate the survey performance and strategy. From 2700 observed spectra, we\ncompare the radial velocity determinations of the HARPS-N DRS pipeline and the\nHARPS-TERRA code, we calculate the mean activity jitter level, we evaluate the\nplanet detection expectations, and we address the general question of how to\ndefine the strategy of spectroscopic surveys in order to be most efficient in\nthe detection of planets. We find that the HARPS-TERRA radial velocities show\nless scatter and we calculate a mean activity jitter of 2.3 m/s for our sample.\nFor a general radial velocity survey with limited observing time, the number of\nobservations per star is key for the detection efficiency. In the case of an\nearly M-type target sample, we conclude that approximately 50 observations per\nstar with exposure times of 900 s and precisions of about 1 m/s maximizes the\nnumber of planet detections.\n", "  We evaluate the effect of two experimental parameters on the slow dynamics of\na Von-K\\'arm\\'an swirling flow driven by two propellers in a closed cylinder.\nThe first parameter is the inertia mo- mentum of the propellers, and the second\nparameter is the aspect ratio, i.e. the distance between the propellers $H$\ndivided by the diameter $D$. We use a cell with a fixed diameter $D$ but where\nthe distance between the propellers can be turned continuously and where the\ninertia from the pro- pellers can also be changed using different gears. No\nchange on the dynamics is observed when the momentum of inertia is modified.\nSome dramatic changes of the shear layer position are observed modifying the\naspect ratio $\\Gamma=H/D$. A bifurcation of the shear layer position appears.\nWhereas for low $\\Gamma$ the shear layer position has a smooth evolution when\nturning the asymmetry between the rotation frequency of the propellers, for\nhigh $\\Gamma$ the transition becomes abrupt and a symmetry breaking appears.\nSecondly we observe that the spontaneous reversals already observed in this ex-\nperiment for $\\Gamma=1$ [de la Torre & Burguete PRL 99, 054101 (2007)] exist\nonly in a strait window of aspect ratio. We show using an experimental study of\nthe mean flow structure and a numerical approach based on a Langevin equation\nwith coloured noise that the shear layer position seems to be decided by the\nmean flow structure whereas the reversals are linked to the spatial\ndistribution of the turbulent fluctuations in the cell.\n", "  The paper devoted to investigation of volume reflection and channeling\nprocesses of ultrarela- tivistic positive charged particles moving in germanium\nsingle crystals. We demonstrate that the choice of atomic potential on the\nbasis of Hartree-Fock method and correct choice of Debye tem- perature allow us\nto describe the above mentioned processes in a good agreement with the recent\nexperiments. Moreover, the presented in the paper universal form of equations\nfor volume reflection gives true description of the process at a wide range of\nparticle energies. Standing on this study we make predictions for mean angle\nreflection (as a function of bending radius) of positive and negative particles\nfor germanium (110) and (111) crystallographic planes.\n", "  We consider the dimensional reduction to D = 3 of four maximal-rank\nsupergravities which preserve minimal supersymmetry in D = 11, 7, 5 and 4. Such\n\"curious\" theories were investigated some time ago, and the four-dimensional\none corresponds to an N = 1 supergravity with 7 chiral multiplets spanning the\nseven-disk manifold. Recently, this latter theory provided cosmological models\nfor alpha-attractors, which are based on the disk geometry with possible\nrestrictions on the parameter alpha. A unified picture emerges in D = 3, where\nthe Ehlers group of General Relativity merges with the S-, T- and U- dualities\nof the D = 4 parent theories.\n", "  Despite much effort to probe the properties of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)\nsolution, effects of DMSO on water, especially near plasma membrane surfaces\nstill remain elusive. By performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at\nvarying DMSO concentrations ($X_{\\text{DMSO}}$), we study how DMSO affects\nstructural and dynamical properties of water in the vicinity of phospholipid\nbilayers. As proposed by a number of experiments, our simulations confirm that\nDMSO induces dehydration from bilayer surfaces and disrupts the H-bond\nstructure of water. However, DMSO enhanced water diffusivity at solvent-bilayer\ninterfaces, an intriguing discovery reported by a spin-label measurement, is\nnot confirmed in our simulations. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we\nexamine the location of the spin-label (Tempo), relative to the solvent-bilayer\ninterface. In accord with the evidence in the literature, our simulations,\nwhich explicitly model Tempo-PC, find that the Tempo moiety is equilibrated at\n$\\sim 8-10$ \\AA\\ \\emph{below} the bilayer surface. Furthermore, the\nDMSO-enhanced surface water diffusion is confirmed only when water diffusion is\nanalyzed around the Tempo moiety that is immersed below the bilayer surface,\nwhich implies that the experimentally detected signal of water using Tempo\nstems from the interior of bilayers, not from the interface. Our analysis finds\nthat the increase of water diffusion below the bilayer surface is coupled to\nthe increase of area per lipid with an increasing $X_{\\text{DMSO}}$ $(\\lesssim\n10\\text{ mol\\%})$. Underscoring the hydrophobic nature of Tempo moiety, our\nstudy calls for careful re-evaluation of the use of Tempo in the measurement on\nlipid bilayer surfaces.\n", "  In order to increase its discovery potential, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\naccelerator will be upgraded in the next decade. The high luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC) period demands new sensor technologies to cope with increasing\nradiation fluences and particle rates. The ATLAS experiment will replace the\nentire inner tracking detector with a completely new silicon-only system. 3D\npixel sensors are promising candidates for the innermost layers of the Pixel\ndetector due to their excellent radiation hardness at low operation voltages\nand low power dissipation at moderate temperatures. Recent developments of 3D\nsensors for the HL-LHC are presented.\n", "  We study the classical thermal component of Casimir, or van der Waals, forces\nbetween point particles with highly anharmonic dipole Hamiltonians when they\nare subjected to an external electric field. Using a model for which the\nindividual dipole moments saturate in a strong field (a model that mimics the\ncharges in a neutral, perfectly conducting sphere), we find that the resulting\nCasimir force depends strongly on the strength of the field, as demonstrated by\nanalytical results. For a certain angle between external field and center to\ncenter axis, the fluctuation force can be tuned and suppressed to arbitrarily\nsmall values. We compare the forces between these anharmonic particles to those\nbetween harmonic ones, and also provide a simple formula for asymptotically\nlarge external fields, which we expect to be generally valid for the case of\nsaturating dipole moments.\n", "  We built a catalog of 219 FRI radio galaxies (FRIs), called FRICAT, selected\nfrom a published sample and obtained by combining observations from the NVSS,\nFIRST, and SDSS surveys. We included in the catalog the sources with an\nedge-darkened radio morphology, redshift $\\leq 0.15$, and extending (at the\nsensitivity of the FIRST images) to a radius $r$ larger than 30 kpc from the\ncenter of the host. We also selected an additional sample (sFRICAT) of 14\nsmaller (10 $<r<$ 30 kpc) FRIs, limiting to $z<0.05$. The hosts of the FRICAT\nsources are all luminous ($-21 \\gtrsim M_r \\gtrsim -24$), red early-type\ngalaxies with black hole masses in the range $10^8 \\lesssim M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim\n3\\times10^9 M_\\odot$; the spectroscopic classification based on the optical\nemission line ratios indicates that they are all low excitation galaxies.\nSources in the FRICAT are then indistinguishable from the FRIs belonging to the\nThird Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3C) on the basis of their optical\nproperties. Conversely, while the 3C-FRIs show a strong positive trend between\nradio and [OIII] emission line luminosity, these two quantities are unrelated\nin the FRICAT sources; at a given line luminosity, they show radio luminosities\nspanning about two orders of magnitude and extending to much lower ratios\nbetween radio and line power than 3C-FRIs. Our main conclusion is that the\n3C-FRIs just represent the tip of the iceberg of a much larger and diverse\npopulation of FRIs.\n", "  Phenomenologically appealing supersymmetric grand unified theories have large\ngauge representations and thus are not asymptotically free. Their ultraviolet\nvalidity is limited by the appearance of a Landau pole well before the Planck\nscale. One could hope that these theories save themselves, before the inclusion\nof gravity, by generating an interacting ultraviolet fixed point, similar to\nthe one recently discovered in non-supersymmetric gauge-Yukawa theories.\nEmploying a-maximization, a-theorem, unitarity bounds, as well as positivity of\nother central charges we nonperturbatively rule out this possibility for a\nbroad class of prime candidates of phenomenologically relevant supersymmetric\ngrand unified theories. We also uncover candidates passing these tests, which\nhave either exotic matter or contain one field decoupled from the\nsuperpotential. The latter class of theories contains a model with the minimal\nmatter content required by phenomenology.\n", "  Iron is one of the archetypical ferromagnets to study the critical\nfluctuations at a continuous phase transition thus serving as a model system\nfor the application of scaling theory. We report a comprehensive study of the\ncritical dynamics at the transition from the ferro- to the paramagnetic phase\nin Fe, employing the high-resolution neutron spin echo technique MIEZE. The\nresults show that the dipolar interactions lead to an additional damping of the\ncritical spin fluctuations at small momentum transfers $\\bf q$. The results\nagree essentially with scaling theory if the dipolar interactions are taken\ninto account by means of the mode-coupling equations. However, in contrast to\nexpectations, the dipolar wavenumber $q_D$ that plays a central role in the\nscaling function $f(\\kappa/q,q_D/\\kappa)$ becomes temperature dependent. In the\nlimit of small $\\bf q$ the critical exponent $z$ crosses over from 2.5 to 2.0.\n", "  Flexural thermal fluctuations in crystalline membranes affect the band\nstructure of the carriers, which leads to an exponential density-of-states\n(DOS) tail beyond the unperturbed band edge. We present a theoretical\ndescription of this tail for a particular case of holes in single-layer black\nphosphorus, a material which exhibits an extremely anisotropic\nquasi-one-dimensional dispersion ($m_y/m_x\\gg1$) and, as a result, an enhanced\nVan Hove singularity at the valence band top. The material parameters are\ndetermined by {\\it ab initio} calculations and then are used for quantitative\nestimation of the effect of two-phonon (flexural) processes have on the charge\ncarrier DOS. It is shown that unlike the isotropic case, the physics is\ndetermined by the phonons with wavevectors of the order of $q^*$, where $q^*$\ndetermines the crossover between harmonic and anharmonic behavior of the\nflexural phonons. The spectral density of the holes in single-layer black\nphosphorus at finite temperatures is calculated.\n", "  We present 1\" (<100 pc) resolution maps of millimeter emission from five\nmolecules-CN, HCN, HCO+, CH3OH, and HNCO-obtained towards NGC 4038, which is\nthe northern galaxy of the mid-stage merger, Antennae galaxies, with the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Three molecules (CN, CH3OH, and\nHNCO) were detected for the first time in the nuclear region of NGC 4038.\nHigh-resolution mapping reveals a systematic difference in distributions of\ndifferent molecular species and continuum emission. Active star forming regions\nidentified by the 3 mm and 850 um continuum emission are offset from the\ngas-rich region associated with the HCN (1-0) and CO (3-2) peaks. The CN\n(1-0)/HCN (1-0) line ratios are enhanced (CN/HCN = 0.8-1.2) in the star forming\nregions, suggesting that the regions are photon dominated. The large molecular\ngas mass (10^8 Msun) within a 0.6\" (~60 pc) radius of the CO (3-2) peak and a\nhigh dense gas fraction (>20 %) suggested by the HCN (1-0)/CO (3-2) line ratio\nmay signify a future burst of intense star formation there. The shocked gas\ntraced in the CH3OH and HNCO emission indicates sub-kpc scale molecular shocks.\nWe suggest that the molecular shocks may be driven by collisions between\ninflowing gas and the central massive molecular complex.\n", "  The vectorial holographic correspondences between higher-spin theories in\nAdS$_5$ and free vector models on the boundary are extended to the cases where\nthe latter is described by free massless spin-$j$ field. The dual higher-spin\ntheory in the bulk does not include gravity and can only be defined on rigid\nAdS$_5$ background with $S^4$ boundary. We discuss various properties of these\nrather special higher-spin theories and calculate their one-loop free energies.\nWe show that the result is proportional to the same quantity for spin-$j$\ndoubleton treated as if it is a AdS$_5$ field. Finally, we consider even more\nspecial case where the boundary theory itself is given by an infinite tower of\nmassless higher-spin fields.\n", "  The hierarchical structure formation model predicts that stellar halos should\nform, at least partly, via mergers. If this was a predominant formation channel\nfor the Milky Way's halo, imprints of this merger history in the form of moving\ngroups or streams should exist also in the vicinity of the Sun. Here we study\nthe kinematics of halo stars in the Solar neighbourhood using the very recent\nfirst data release from the Gaia mission, and in particular the TGAS dataset,\nin combination with data from the RAVE survey. Our aim is to determine the\namount of substructure present in the phase-space distribution of halo stars\nthat could be linked to merger debris. To characterise kinematic substructure,\nwe measure the velocity correlation function in our sample of halo (low\nmetallicity) stars. We also study the distribution of these stars in the space\nof energy and two components of the angular momentum, in what we call\n\"Integrals of Motion\" space. The velocity correlation function reveals\nsubstructure in the form of an excess of pairs of stars with similar\nvelocities, well above that expected for a smooth distribution. Comparison to\ncosmological simulations of the formation of stellar halos indicate that the\nlevels found are consistent with the Galactic halo having been built fully via\naccretion. Similarly, the distribution of stars in the space of \"Integrals of\nmotion\" is highly complex. A strikingly high fraction (between 58% and upto\n73%) of the stars that are somewhat less bound than the Sun are on (highly)\nretrograde orbits. A simple comparison to Milky Way-mass galaxies in\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggests that less than 1% have such\nprominently retrograde outer halos. We also identify several other\nstatistically significant structures in \"Integrals of Motion\" space that could\npotentially be related to merger events.\n", "  We study the consistency conditions for interactions of massless fields of\nany spin in four-dimensional flat space using the light-cone approach. We show\nthat they can be equivalently rewritten as the Ward identities for the\noff-shell light-cone amplitudes built from the light-cone Hamiltonian in the\nstandard way. Then we find a general solution of these Ward identities. The\nsolution admits a compact representation when written in the spinor-helicity\nform and is given by an arbitrary function of spinor products, satisfying\nwell-known homogeneity constraints. Thus, we show that the light-cone\nconsistent deformation procedure inevitably leads to a certain off-shell\nversion of the spinor-helicity approach. We discuss how the relation between\nthe two approaches can be employed to facilitate the search of consistent\ninteraction of massless higher-spin fields.\n", "  Two transiting planets have been identified orbiting K2 target EPIC\n220674823. One object is an ultra-short-period planet (USP) with a period of\njust 0.57 days (13.7 hours), while the other has a period of 13.3 days. Both\nplanets are small, with the former having a radius of R_p1=1.5 R_E and the\nlatter R_p2=2.5 R_E. Follow-up observations, including radial velocity (with\nuncertainties of 110 m/s) and high-resolution adaptive optics imagery, show no\nsigns of stellar companions. EPIC 220674823 is the 12th confirmed or validated\nplanetary system in which an ultra-short-period planet (i.e., having an orbital\nperiod less than 1 day) is accompanied by at least one additional planet,\nsuggesting that such systems may be common and must be accounted for in models\nfor the formation and evolution of such extreme systems.\n", "  Since the discovery of topological insulators (TI), there are considerable\ninterests in demonstrating metallic surface states, their shielded robust\nnature to the backscattering and study their properties at nanoscale dimensions\nby fabricating nanodevices. Here we address an important scientific issue\nrelated to TI whether one can clearly demonstrate the robustness of topological\nsurface states (TSS) to the presence of disorder that does not break any\nfundamental symmetry. The simple straightforward method of FIB milling was used\nto synthesize nanowires of Bi2Se3 which we believe an interesting route to test\nrobustness of TSS and obtained results are new compared to many of the earlier\npapers on quantum transport in TI demonstrating robustness of metallic SS to\ngallium doping. In presence of perpendicular magnetic field, we have observed\nthe co-existence of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations and linear magnetoresistance\nwhich was systematically investigated at different channel lengths indicating\nthe Dirac dispersive surface states. The transport properties and estimated\nphysical parameters shown here demonstrate the robustness of SS to the\nfabrication tools triggering flexibility to explore new exotic quantum\nphenomena at nanodevice level.\n", "  We report on the detection of a small overdensity of stars in velocity space\nwith systematically higher Galactocentric rotation velocity than the Sun by\nabout 20 km s$^{-1}$ in the $Gaia$ Data Release 1 Tycho-Gaia astrometric\nsolution (TGAS) data. We find these fast Galactic rotators more clearly outside\nof the Solar radius, compared to inside of the Solar radius. In addition, the\nvelocity of the fast Galactic rotators is independent of the Galactocentric\ndistance up to $R-R_{\\odot}\\sim0.6$ kpc. Comparing with numerical models, we\nqualitatively discuss that a possible cause of this feature is the co-rotation\nresonance of the Perseus spiral arm, where the stars in peri-centre phase in\nthe trailing side of the Perseus spiral arm experience an extended period of\nacceleration owing to the torque from the Perseus arm.\n", "  We consider a class of flavor models proposed by Aranda, Carone and Lebed,\nrelaxing the assumption of supersymmetry and allowing the flavor scale to float\nanywhere between the weak and Planck scales. We perform global fits to the\ncharged fermion masses and CKM angles, and consider the dependence of the\nresults on the unknown mass scale of the flavor sector. We find that the\ntypical Yukawa textures in these models provide a good description of the data\nover a wide range of flavor scales, with a preference for those that approach\nthe lower bounds allowed by flavor-changing-neutral-current constraints.\nNevertheless, the possibility that the flavor scale and Planck scale are\nidentified remains viable. We present models that demonstrate how the assumed\ntextures can arise most simply in a non-supersymmetric framework.\n", "  We delineate the allowed parameter and mass range for a wino-like dark matter\nparticle containing some Higgsino admixture in the MSSM by analysing the\nconstraints from diffuse gamma-rays from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies,\ngalactic cosmic rays, direct detection and cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies. A complete calculation of the Sommerfeld effect for the\nmixed-neutralino case is performed. We find that the combination of direct and\nindirect searches poses significant restrictions on the thermally produced\nwino-Higgsino dark matter with correct relic density. For $\\mu>0$ nearly the\nentire parameter space considered is excluded, while for $\\mu<0$ a substantial\nregion is still allowed, provided conservative assumptions on astrophysical\nuncertainties are adopted.\n", "  The exact bound state solutions of the Dirac-Pauli equation are studied for\nan appropriate position-dependent mass function by using the Nikiforov-Uvarov\nmethod. For a central electric field having a shifted inverse linear term, all\ntwo kinds of solutions for bound states are obtained in closed forms.\n", "  A comprehensive study of a reduced version of Lust's equations, the extended\nmagnetohydrodynamic (XMHD) model obtained from the two-fluid theory for\nelectrons and ions with the enforcement of quasineutrality, is given. Starting\nfrom the Hamiltonian structure of the fully three-dimensional theory, a\nHamiltonian two-dimensional incompressible four-field model is derived. In this\nway energy conservation along with four families of Casimir invariants are\nnaturally obtained. The construction facilitates various limits leading to the\nHamiltonian forms of Hall, inertial, and ideal MHD, with their conserved\nenergies and Casimir invariants. Basic linear theory of the four-field model is\ntreated, and the growth rate for collisionless reconnection is obtained.\nResults from nonlinear simulations of collisionless tearing are presented and\ninterpreted using, in particular normal fields, a product of the Hamiltonian\ntheory that gives rise to simplified equations of motion.\n", "  Here we present inelastic neutron scattering measurements from the\nfrustrated, quantum spin-1/2 chain material linarite, PbCuSO_4(OH)_2. Time of\nflight data, taken at 0.5K and zero applied magnetic field reveals low-energy\ndispersive spin wave excitations below 1.5meV both parallel and perpendicular\nto the Cu-chain direction. From this we confirm that the interchain couplings\nwithin linarite are around 10% of the nearest neighbour intrachain\ninteractions. We analyse the data within both linear spin-wave theory and\ndensity matrix renormalisation group theories and establish the main magnetic\nexchange interactions and the simplest realistic Hamiltonian for this material.\n", "  The inclusive production of {\\Lambda} hyperons in proton-proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 3.18 GeV was measured with HADES at the GSI Helmholtzzentrum f\\\"ur\nSchwerionenforschung in Darmstadt. The experimental data are compared to a\ndata-based model for individual exclusive {\\Lambda} production channels in the\nsame reaction. The contributions of intermediate resonances such as\n{\\Sigma}(1385), {\\Delta}++ or N* are considered in detail. In particular, the\nresult of a partial wave analysis is accounted for the abundant pK$^+${\\Lambda}\nfinal state. Model and data show a reasonable agreement at mid rapidities,\nwhile a difference is found for larger rapidities. A total {\\Lambda} production\ncross section in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 3.18 GeV of {\\sigma}(pp $\\to$\n{\\Lambda} + X) = 207.3 $\\pm$ 1.3 +6.0 -7.3 (stat.) $\\pm$ 8.4 (syst.) +0.4 -0.5\n(model) {\\mu}b is found.\n", "  It has been shown that the conditional probability distributions obtained by\nperforming measurements on an uncharacterized physical system can be used to\ninfer its underlying dimension in a device-independent way both in the\nclassical and quantum setting. We analyze several aspects of the structure of\nthe sets of probability distributions corresponding to a certain dimension\ntaking into account whether shared randomness is available as a resource or\nnot. We first consider the so-called prepare-and-measure scenario. We show that\nquantumness and shared randomness are not comparable resources. That is, on the\none hand, there exist behaviours that require a quantum system of arbitrarily\nlarge dimension in order to be observed while they can be reproduced with a\nclassical physical system of minimal dimension together with shared randomness.\nOn the other hand, there exist behaviours which require exponentially larger\ndimensions classically than quantumly even if the former is supplemented with\nshared randomness. We also show that in the absence of shared randomness, the\nsets corresponding to a sufficiently small dimension are negligible\n(zero-measure and nowhere dense) both classically and quantumly. This is in\nsharp contrast to the situation in which this resource is available and\nexplains the exceptional robustness of dimension witnesses in the setting in\nwhich devices can be taken to be uncorrelated. We finally consider the Bell\nscenario in the absence of shared randomness and prove some non-convexity and\nnegligibility properties of these sets for sufficiently small dimensions. This\nshows again the enormous difference induced by the availability or not of this\nresource.\n", "  We present explicit expressions of the thermodynamic volume inside and\noutside the cosmological horizon of Eguchi-Hanson solitons in general odd\ndimensions. These quantities are calculable and well-defined regardless of\nwhether or not the regularity condition for the soliton is imposed. For the\ninner case, we show that the reverse isoperimetric inequality is not satisfied\nfor general values of the soliton parameter $a$, though a narrow range exists\nfor which the inequality does hold. For the outer case, we find that the mass\n$M_{out}$ satisfies the maximal mass conjecture and the volume is positive. We\nalso show that, by requiring $M_{out}$ to yield the mass of dS spacetime when\nthe soliton parameter vanishes, the associated cosmological volume is always\npositive.\n", "  Out-of-equilibrium phenomena is a subject of considerable interest in many\nfields of physics. Ultracold quantum gases, which are extremely clean,\nwell-isolated and highly controllable systems, offer ideal platforms to\ninvestigate this topic. The recent progress in tailoring trapping potentials\nnow allows the experimental production of homogeneous samples in custom\ngeometries, which is a key advance for studies of the emergence of coherence in\ninteracting quantum systems. Here we review recent experiments in which\ntemperature quenches have been performed across the Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC) phase transition in an annular geometry and in homogeneous 3D and\nquasi-2D gases. Combined, these experiments give a comprehensive picture of the\nKibble-Zurek (KZ) scenario through complementary measurements of correlation\nfunctions and topological defects density. They also allow the measurement of\nKZ scaling laws, the direct confirmation of the \"freeze-out\" hypothesis that\nunderlies the KZ theory, and the extraction of critical exponents of the\nBose-Einstein condensation transition.\n", "  The recent R&D focus on CMOS sensors with charge collection in a depleted\nzone has opened new perspectives for CMOS sensors as fast and radiation hard\npixel devices. These sensors, labelled as depleted CMOS sensors (DMAPS), have\nalready shown promising performance as feasible candidates for the ATLAS Inner\nTracker (ITk) upgrade, possibly replacing the current passive sensors. A\nfurther step to exploit the potential of DMAPS is to investigate the\nsuitability of equipping the outer layers of the ATLAS ITk upgrade with fully\nmonolithic CMOS sensors. This paper presents the development of a depleted\nmonolithic CMOS pixel sensor designed in the LFoundry 150 nm CMOS technology,\nwith the focus on design details and simulation results.\n", "  We describe minimal supergravity models where supersymmetry is non-linearly\nrealized via constrained superfields. We show that the resulting actions differ\nfrom the so called \"de Sitter\" supergravities because we consider constraints\neliminating directly the auxiliary fields of the gravity multiplet.\n", "  Directional dark matter detection attempts to measure the direction of motion\nof nuclei recoiling after having interacted with dark matter particles in the\nhalo of our Galaxy. Due to Earth's motion with respect to the Galaxy, the dark\nmatter flux is concentrated around a preferential direction. An anisotropy in\nthe recoil direction rate is expected as an unmistakable signature of dark\nmatter. The average nuclear recoil direction is expected to coincide with the\naverage direction of dark matter particles arriving to Earth. Here we point out\nthat for a particular type of dark matter, inelastic exothermic dark matter,\nthe mean recoil direction as well as a secondary feature, a ring of maximum\nrecoil rate around the mean recoil direction, could instead be opposite to the\naverage dark matter arrival direction. Thus, the detection of an average\nnuclear recoil direction opposite to the usually expected direction would\nconstitute a spectacular experimental confirmation of this type of dark matter.\n", "  We developed a flare prediction model using machine learning, which is\noptimized to predict the maximum class of flares occurring in the following 24\nh. Machine learning is used to devise algorithms that can learn from and make\ndecisions on a huge amount of data. We used solar observation data during the\nperiod 2010-2015, such as vector magnetogram, ultraviolet (UV) emission, and\nsoft X-ray emission taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. We detected active regions\nfrom the full-disk magnetogram, from which 60 features were extracted with\ntheir time differentials, including magnetic neutral lines, the current\nhelicity, the UV brightening, and the flare history. After standardizing the\nfeature database, we fully shuffled and randomly separated it into two for\ntraining and testing. To investigate which algorithm is best for flare\nprediction, we compared three machine learning algorithms: the support vector\nmachine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and extremely randomized trees\n(ERT). The prediction score, the true skill statistic (TSS), was higher than\n0.9 with a fully shuffled dataset, which is higher than that for human\nforecasts. It was found that k-NN has the highest performance among the three\nalgorithms. The ranking of the feature importance showed that the previous\nflare activity is most effective, followed by the length of magnetic neutral\nlines, the unsigned magnetic flux, the area of UV brightening, and the time\ndifferentials of features over 24 h, all of which are strongly correlated with\nthe flux emergence dynamics in an active region.\n", "  We study ${\\cal N}=2$ compactifications of $E_8\\times E_8$ heterotic string\ntheory on orbifolds of $K3 \\times T^2$ by $g'$ which acts as an $\\mathbb{Z}_N$\nautomorphism of $K3$ together with a$1/N$ shift on a circle of $T^2$. The\norbifold action $g'$ corresponds to the $26$ conjugacy classes of the Mathieu\ngroup $M_{24}$. We show that for the standard embedding the new supersymmetric\nindex for these compactifications can always be decomposed into the elliptic\ngenus of $K3$ twisted by $g'$. The difference in one-loop corrections to the\ngauge couplings are captured by automorphic forms obtained by the theta lifts\nof the elliptic genus of $K3$ twisted by $g'$. We work out in detail the case\nfor which $g'$ belongs to the equivalence class $2B$. We then investigate all\nthe non-standard embeddings for$K3$ realized as a $T^4/\\mathbb{Z}_\\nu$ orbifold\nwith $\\nu = 2, 4$ and $g'$ the $2A$ involution. We show that for non-standard\nembeddings the new supersymmetric index as well as the difference in one-loop\ncorrections to the gauge couplings are completely characterized by the\ninstanton numbers of the embeddings together with the difference in number of\nhypermultiplets and vector multiplets in the spectrum.\n", "  Employing quasiclassical theory of superconductivity combined with Keldysh\ntechnique we investigate large thermoelectric effect in multiterminal ballistic\nnormal-superconducting (NS) hybrid structures. We argue that this effect is\ncaused by electron-hole asymmetry generated by coherent Andreev reflection of\nquasiparticles at interfaces of two different superconductors with non-zero\nphase difference. Within our model we derive a general expression for\nthermoelectric voltages $V_{T1,2}$ induced in two different normal terminals\nexposed to a thermal gradient. Our results apply at any temperature difference\nin the subgap regime and allow to explicitly analyze both temperature and phase\ndependencies of $V_{T1,2}$ demonstrating that in general there exists no\nfundamental relation between these voltages and the equilibrium Josephson\ncurrent in SNS junctions.\n", "  We examine the Regge (high energy) limit of 4-point scattering in both QCD\nand gravity, using recently developed techniques to systematically compute all\ncorrections up to next-to-leading power in the exchanged momentum i.e. beyond\nthe eikonal approximation. We consider the situation of two scalar particles of\narbitrary mass, thus generalising previous calculations in the literature. In\nQCD, our calculation describes power-suppressed corrections to the Reggeisation\nof the gluon. In gravity, we confirm a previous conjecture that next-to-soft\ncorrections correspond to two independent deflection angles for the incoming\nparticles. Our calculations in QCD and gravity are consistent with the\nwell-known double copy relating amplitudes in the two theories.\n", "  In this contribution we introduce a new strategy for the compensation of\nplasmonic losses based on a recently proposed nonlinear mechanism: the resonant\ninteraction between surface plasmon polaritons and spatial solitons propagating\nin parallel along a metal/dielectric/Kerr structure. This mechanism naturally\nleads to the generation of a quasi-particle excitation, the so-called\nsoliplasmon resonance. We analyze the role played by the effective nonlinear\ncoupling inherent to this system and how this can be used to provide a new\nmechanism of quasi-resonant nonlinear excitation of surface plasmon polaritons.\nWe will pay particular attention to the introduction of asymmetric linear gain\nin the Kerr medium. The unique combination of nonlinear propagation, nonlinear\ncoupling and gain give rise to a new scenario for the excitation of long- range\nsurface plasmon polaritons with distinguishing characteristics. The connection\nbetween plasmonic losses and soliplasmon resonances in the presence of gain\nwill be discussed.\n", "  Phase transitions to absorbing states are among the simplest examples of\ncritical phenomena out of equilibrium. The characteristic feature of these\nmodels is the presence of a fluctuationless configuration which the dynamics\ncannot leave, which has proved a rather stringent requirement in experiments.\nRecently, a proposal to seek such transitions in highly tuneable systems of\ncold atomic gases offers to probe this physics and, at the same time, to\ninvestigate the robustness of these transitions to quantum coherent effects.\nHere we specifically focus on the interplay between classical and quantum\nfluctuations in a simple driven open quantum model which, in the classical\nlimit, reproduces a contact process, which is known to undergo a continuous\ntransition in the \"directed percolation\" universality class. We derive an\neffective long-wavelength field theory for the present class of open spin\nsystems and show that, due to quantum fluctuations, the nature of the\ntransition changes from second to first order, passing through a bicritical\npoint which appears to belong instead to the \"tricritical directed percolation\"\nclass.\n", "  We present a new method for evaluating the response of a moving qubit\ndetector interacting with a scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. We treat the\ndetector as an open quantum system, but we do not invoke the Markov\napproximation. The evolution equations for the qubit density matrix are valid\nat all times, for all qubit trajectories and they incorporate non-Markovian\neffects. We analyze in detail the case of uniform acceleration, providing a\ndetailed characterization of all regimes where non-Markovian effects are\nsignificant. We argue that the most stable characterization of acceleration\ntemperature refers to the late time behavior of the detector, because\ninteraction with the field vacuum brings the qubit to a thermal state at the\nUnruh temperature. In contrast, the early-time transition rate, that is invoked\nin most discussions of acceleration temperature, does not exhibit a thermal\nbehavior when non-Markovian effects are taken into account. Finally, we note\nthat the non-Markovian evolution derived here also applies to the\nmathematically equivalent problem of a static qubit interacting with a thermal\nfield bath.\n", "  We demonstrate that chimera behavior can be observed in small networks\nconsisting of three identical oscillators, with mutual all-to-all coupling.\nThree different types of chimeras, characterized by the coexistence of two\ncoherent oscillators and one incoherent oscillator (i.e. rotating with another\nfrequency) have been identified, where the oscillators show periodic (two\ntypes) and chaotic (one type) behaviors. Typical bifurcations at the\ntransitions from full synchronization to chimera states and between different\ntypes of chimeras have been described. Parameter regions for the chimera states\nare obtained in the form of Arnold tongues, issued from a singular parameter\npoint. Our analysis suggests that chimera states can be observed in small\nnetworks, relevant to various real-world systems.\n", "  The decoy-state scheme is the most widely implemented quantum key\ndistribution protocol in practice. In order to account for the finite-size key\neffects on the achievable secret key generation rate, a rigorous statistical\nfluctuation analysis is required. Originally, a heuristic\nGaussian-approximation technique was used for this purpose, which, despite of\nits analytical convenience, was not sufficiently rigorous. The fluctuation\nanalysis has recently been made rigorous by using the Chernoff bound. There is\na considerable gap, however, between the key rate bounds obtained from these\nnew techniques and that obtained from the Gaussian assumption. Here, we develop\na tighter bound for the decoy-state method, which yields a smaller failure\nprobability. This improvement results in a higher key rate and increases the\nmaximum distance over which secure key exchange is possible. By optimizing the\nsystem parameters, our simulation results show that our new method almost\ncloses the gap between the two previously proposed techniques and achieves a\nsimilar performance to that of conventional Gaussian approximations.\n", "  The data release 1 (DR1) of milliarcsecond-scale accurate optical positions\nof stars and galaxies was recently published by the space mission Gaia. We\nstudy the offsets of highly accurate absolute radio (very long baseline\ninterferometry, VLBI) and optical positions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) to\nsee whether or not a signature of wavelength-dependent parsec-scale structure\ncan be seen. We analyzed VLBI and Gaia positions and determined the direction\nof jets in 2957 AGNs from their VLBI images. We find that there is a\nstatistically significant excess of sources with VLBI-to-Gaia position offset\nin directions along and opposite to the jet. Offsets along the jet vary from\nzero to tens of mas. Offsets in the opposite direction do not exceed 3 mas. The\npresense of strong, extended parsec-scale optical jet structures in many AGNs\nis required to explain all observed VLBI-Gaia offsets along the jet direction.\nThe offsets in the opposite direction shorter than 1 mas can be explained\neither by a non-point-like VLBI jet structure or a \"core-shift\" effect due to\nsynchrotron opacity.\n", "  Given any background (or seed) solution of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, the Darboux transformation can be used to generate higher-order\nbreathers with much greater peak intensities. The Darboux transformation is\ngeneric in iterating a pair of generating solutions of the Lax-pair equation\nwhich preserves the solution of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation as a\nconsistency condition. The Darboux transformation itself knows nothing about\nthe background solution except through the initial pair of Lax solutions.\nBecause of this, in this work, we can prove in an unified manner, and without\nknowing the analytical form of the background solution, that the peak-height of\na high-order breather, is just a sum of peak-heights of first-order breathers\nplus that of the background, {\\it irrespective} of the specific choice of the\nbackground. Detailed results are verified for breathers on a cnoidal\nbackground. Generalizations to more extended nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations\nare also indicated.\n", "  We report synthesis, structural details and electrical transport properties\nof topological insulator Bi2Te3. The single crystalline specimens of Bi2Te3 are\nobtained from high temperature (950C) melt and slow cooling (2C/hour). The\nresultant crystals were shiny, one piece (few cm) and of bright silver color.\nThe Bi2Te3 crystal is found to be perfect with clear [00l] alignment. The\npowder XRD pattern being carried out on crushed crystals showed that Bi2Te3\ncrystallized in R3m symmetry with a = b = 4.3866(2) A, c = 30.4978(13) A and\nGamma = 120degree. The Bi position is refined to (0, 0, 0.4038 (9)) at Wyckoff\nposition 6c and of Te are (0, 0, 0) at Wyckoff position 3a and at (0, 0,\n0.2039(8)) at 6c. Ambient pressure and low temperature (down to 2K) electrical\ntransport measurements revealed metallic behavior. Magneto transport\nmeasurements under magnetic field showed huge non saturating magneto resistance\n(MR) reaching up to 250% at 2.5K and under 50KOe field. Summarily, the short\ncommunication clearly demonstrates that Bi2Te3 topological insulator exhibit\nnon-saturating large positive MR at low temperature of say below 10K. The non\nsaturating MR is seen right up to room temperature albeit with much decreased\nmagnitude. Worth mentioning is the fact that these crystals are bulk in nature\nand hence the anomalous MR is clearly an intrinsic property and not due to the\nsize effect as reported for nano-wires or thin films of the same.\n", "  We study collisions of massive pointlike particles in three dimensional\nanti-de Sitter space, generalizing the work on massless particles in [1]. We\nshow how to construct exact solutions corresponding to the formation of either\na black hole or a conical singularity from the collision of an arbitrary number\nof massive particles that fall in radially and collide at the origin of AdS. No\nrestrictions on the masses or the angular and radial positions from where the\nparticles are released, are imposed. We also consider the limit of an infinite\nnumber of particles, obtaining novel timelike thin shell spacetimes. These thin\nshells have an arbitrary mass distribution as well as a non-trivial embedding\nwhere the radial location of the shell depends on the angular coordinate, and\nwe analyze these shells using the junction formalism of general relativity. We\nalso consider the massless limit and find consistency with earlier results, as\nwell as comment on the stress-energy tensor modes of the dual CFT.\n", "  We report on the discovery of coherent pulsations at a period of 2.9 ms from\nthe X-ray transient MAXI J0911-655 in the globular cluster NGC 2808. We\nobserved X-ray pulsations at a frequency of $\\sim339.97$ Hz in three different\nobservations of the source performed with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR during the\nsource outburst. This newly discovered accreting millisecond pulsar is part of\nan ultra-compact binary system characterised by an orbital period of $44.3$\nminutes and a projected semi-major axis of $\\sim17.6$ lt-ms. Based on the mass\nfunction we estimate a minimum companion mass of 0.024 M$_{\\odot}$, which\nassumes a neutron star mass of 1.4 M$_{\\odot}$ and a maximum inclination angle\nof $75^{\\circ}$ (derived from the lack of eclipses and dips in the light-curve\nof the source). We find that the companion star's Roche-Lobe could either be\nfilled by a hot ($5\\times 10^{6}$ K) pure helium white dwarf with a 0.028\nM$_{\\odot}$ mass (implying $i\\simeq58^{\\circ}$) or an old (>5 Gyr) brown dwarf\nwith metallicity abundances between solar/sub-solar and mass ranging in the\ninterval 0.065$-$0.085 M$_{\\odot}$ (16 < $i$ < 21). During the outburst the\nbroad-band energy spectra are well described by a superposition of a weak\nblack-body component (kT$\\sim$ 0.5 keV) and a hard cutoff power-law with photon\nindex $\\Gamma \\sim$ 1.7 and cut-off at a temperature kT$_e\\sim$ 130 keV. Up to\nthe latest Swift-XRT observation performed on 2016 July 19 the source has been\nobserved in outburst for almost 150 days, which makes MAXI J0911-655 the second\naccreting millisecond X-ray pulsar with outburst duration longer than 100 days.\n", "  We discuss recent progress in describing a certain non-Abelian vortex string\nas a critical superstring on a conifold and clarify some subtle points. This\nparticular solitonic vortex is supported in four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric\nQCD with the U(2) gauge group, N_f=4 quark flavors and the Fayet-Iliopoulos\nterm. Under certain conditions the non-Abelian vortex can become infinitely\nthin and can be interpreted as a critical ten-dimensional superstring. In\naddition to four translational moduli the non-Abelian vortex under\nconsideration carries six orientational and size moduli. The vortex moduli\ndynamics are described by a two-dimensional sigma model with the target space\n{R}^4\\times Y_6 where Y_6 is a non-compact Calabi-Yau conifold. The closed\nstring states which emerge in four dimensions (4D) are identified with hadrons\nof 4D bulk N=2 QCD. It turns out that most of the states arising from the\nten-dimensional graviton spectrum are non-dynamical in 4D. A single dynamical\nmassless hypermultiplet associated with the deformation of the complex\nstructure of the conifold is found. It is interpreted as a monopole-monopole\nbaryon of the 4D theory (at strong coupling).\n", "  We have developed a custom amplifier board coupled to a large-format\n16-channel Hamamatsu silicon photomultiplier device for use as the light sensor\nfor the electromagnetic calorimeters in the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab.\nThe calorimeter absorber is an array of lead-fluoride crystals, which produces\nshort-duration Cherenkov light. The detector sits in the high magnetic field of\nthe muon storage ring. The SiPMs selected, and their accompanying custom\nelectronics, must preserve the short pulse shape, have high quantum efficiency,\nbe non-magnetic, exhibit gain stability under varying rate conditions, and\ncover a fairly large fraction of the crystal exit surface area. We describe an\noptimized design that employs the new-generation of thru-silicon via devices.\nThe performance is documented in a series of bench and beam tests.\n", "  We analyzed two twist-3 distribution amplitudes of pion, i.e. pseudoscalar\n$\\phi^P_{3;\\pi}(x)$ and pseudotensor $\\phi^\\sigma_{3;\\pi}(x)$, within the LFQM.\nOur LFQM descriptions both for twist-3 $\\phi^P_{3;\\pi}$ and\n$\\phi^\\sigma_{3;\\pi}$ not only satisfy the fundamental constraint required from\nthe isospin symmetry, but also reproduce exactly the asymptotic forms\nanticipated from QCD's conformal limit.\n", "  This work uses the Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z) formalism, a concept originating from\nnon-equilibrium statistical mechanics, as a basis for the development of\ncoarse-grained models of turbulence. The mechanics of the generalized Langevin\nequation (GLE) are considered and insight gained from the orthogonal dynamics\nequation is used as a starting point for model development. A class of sub-grid\nmodels is considered which represent non-local behavior via a finite memory\napproximation (Stinis, P., \"Mori-Zwanzig reduced models for uncertainty\nquantification I: Parametric uncertainty,\" \\textit{arXiv:1211.4285}, 2012.),\nthe length of which is determined using a heuristic that is related to the\nspectral radius of the Jacobian of the resolved variables. The resulting models\nare intimately tied to the underlying numerical resolution and are capable of\napproximating non-Markovian effects. Numerical experiments on the Burgers\nequation demonstrate that the M-Z-based models can accurately predict the\ntemporal evolution of the total kinetic energy and the total dissipation rate\nat varying mesh resolutions. The trajectory of each resolved mode in\nphase-space is accurately predicted for cases where the coarse-graining is\nmoderate. LES of homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the Taylor Green Vortex\nshow that the M-Z-based models are able to provide excellent predictions,\naccurately capturing the sub-grid contribution to energy transfer. Lastly, LES\nof fully developed channel flow demonstrate the applicability of M-Z-based\nmodels to non-decaying problems. It is notable that the form of the closure is\nnot imposed by the modeler, but is rather derived from the mathematics of the\ncoarse-graining, highlighting the potential of M-Z-based techniques to define\nLES closures.\n", "  We investigate the recently proposed clockwork mechanism delivering light\ndegrees of freedom with suppressed interactions and show, with various\nexamples, that it can be efficiently implemented in inflationary scenarios to\ngenerate flat inflaton potentials and small density perturbations without\nfine-tunings. We also study the clockwork graviton in de Sitter and,\ninterestingly, we find that the corresponding clockwork charge is\nsite-dependent. As a consequence, the amount of tensor modes is generically\nsuppressed with respect to the standard cases where the clockwork set-up is not\nadopted. This point can be made a virtue in resurrecting models of inflation\nwhich were supposed to be ruled out because of the excessive amount of tensor\nmodes from inflation.\n", "  We present the results for the Generalized Transverse Momentum Distribution\nrelated to quark Orbital Angular Momentum, {\\it i.e.} $F_{14}$, in the MIT bag\nmodel. This model has been modified to include the Peierls--Yoccoz projection\nto restore translational invariance. Such a modification allows to fulfill more\nsatisfactorily basic sum rules, that would otherwise be less elegantly carried\nout with the original version. Using the same model, we have calculated the\ntwist-$3$ GPD that corresponds to Orbital Angular Momentum \\`a la Ji, through\nthe Penttinen--Polyakov--Shuvaev--Strikman sum rule. Recently, a new relation\nbetween the two definitions of the quark Orbital Angular Momentum at the\ndensity level has been proposed, which we illustrate here within the model. The\nsum rule is fulfilled. Still within the framework of the MIT bag model, we\nanalyze the Wandzura--Wilczek expression for the GPD of interest. The genuine\nquark-gluon contribution is evaluated directly thanks to the equation of motion\nof the bag, which allows for a direct control of the kinematical contributions\nto the twist-3 GPD.\n", "  In this work we study mesonic excitations in a Quantum Field Theory dual to\nthe non Abelian T-dual of $AdS_5\\times S^5$, using a D6 brane probe on the\nSfetsos-Thompson background. Before and after the duality, we observe\ninteresting differences between the spectra and interpret them. The spectrum of\nmasses and the interactions among mesonic excitations teach valuable lessons\nabout the character of non-Abelian T-duality and its implications for\nHolography. The case of Abelian T-duality is also studied.\n", "  Blue metal-poor stars (BMPs) are main sequence stars that appear bluer and\nmore luminous than normal turnoff stars. They were originally singled out by\nusing B-V and U-B colour cuts. Early studies found that a larger fraction of\nfield BMP stars were binaries compared to normal halo stars. Thus, BMP stars\nare ideal field blue straggler candidates for investigating internal stellar\nevolution processes and binary interaction. In particular, the presence or\ndepletion in lithium in their spectra is a powerful indicator as to their\norigin. They are either old, halo blue stragglers experiencing internal mixing\nprocesses or mass transfer (Li-depletion), or intermediate-age, single stars of\npossibly extragalactic origin (2.2dex halo plateau Li). However, we note that\ninternal mixing processes can lead to an increased level of Li. Hence, this\nstudy combines photometry and spectroscopy to unveil the origin of various BMP\nstars. We first show how to separate binaries from young blue stars using\nphotometry, metallicity, and lithium. Using a sample of 80 BMP stars (T>6300K),\nwe find that 97% of the BMP binaries have V-Ks_0 < 1.08$\\pm0.03$, while BMP\nstars that are not binaries lie above this cut in 2/3 of the cases. This cut\ncan help classify stars which lack radial velocities from follow-up\nobservations. We trace the origin of two BMP stars from the photometric sample\nby conducting a full chemical analysis using new high-resolution and high SN\nspectra. Based on their radial velocities, Li, alpha, and s- and r-process\nabundances we show that BPS CS22874-042 is a single star\n(A(Li)$=2.38\\pm0.10$dex) while with A(Li)$=2.23\\pm0.07$dex CD-48 2445 is a\nbinary, contrary to earlier findings. Our analysis emphasises that field blue\nstragglers can be segregated from single metal-poor stars, using V-Ks colours\nwith a fraction of single stars polluting the binary sample, but not vice\nversa.(Abridged)\n", "  Proxima and Alpha Centauri AB have almost identical distances and proper\nmotions with respect to the Sun. Although the probability of such similar\nparameters is in principle very low, the question as to whether they actually\nform a single gravitationally bound triple system has been open since the\ndiscovery of Proxima one century ago. Owing to HARPS high precision absolute\nradial velocity measurements and the recent revision of the parameters of the\nAlpha Cen pair, we show that Proxima and Alpha Cen are gravitationally bound\nwith a high degree of confidence. The orbital period of Proxima is\napproximately 550 000 years. With an excentricity of 0.50 (+0.08 -0.09),\nProxima comes within 4.3 (+1.1 -0.9) kau of Alpha Cen at periastron. Its\norbital phase is currently close to apastron (13.0 +0.3 -0.1 kau). This orbital\nmotion may have influenced the formation or evolution of the recently\ndiscovered planet orbiting Proxima as well as circumbinary planet formation\naround Alpha Cen.\n", "  We calculate the topological part of the electromagnetic response of Bosonic\nInteger Quantum Hall (BIQH) phases in odd (spacetime) dimensions, and Bosonic\nTopological Insulator (BTI) and Bosonic chiral semi-metal (BCSM) phases in even\ndimensions. To do this we use the Nonlinear Sigma Model (NLSM) description of\nbosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, and the method of gauged\nWess-Zumino (WZ) actions. We find the surprising result that for BIQH states in\ndimension $2m-1$ ($m=1,2,\\dots$), the bulk response to an electromagnetic field\n$A_{\\mu}$ is characterized by a Chern-Simons term for $A_{\\mu}$ with a level\nquantized in integer multiples of $m!$ (factorial). We also show that BTI\nstates (which have an extra $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry) can exhibit a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking Quantum Hall effect on their boundaries, with this\nboundary Quantum Hall effect described by a Chern-Simons term at level\n$\\frac{m!}{2}$. We show that the factor of $m!$ can be understood by requiring\ngauge invariance of the exponential of the Chern-Simons term on a general\nEuclidean manifold, and we also use this argument to characterize the\nelectromagnetic and gravitational responses of fermionic SPT phases with $U(1)$\nsymmetry in all odd dimensions. We then use our gauged boundary actions for the\nBIQH and BTI states to (i) construct a bosonic analogue of a chiral semi-metal\n(BCSM) in even dimensions, (ii) show that the boundary of the BTI state\nexhibits a bosonic analogue of the parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in odd\ndimensions, and (iii) study anomaly inflow at domain walls on the boundary of\nBTI states. In a series of Appendices we derive important formulas and\nadditional results. In particular, in Appendix A we use the connection between\nequivariant cohomology and gauged WZ actions to give a mathematical\ninterpretation of the actions for the BIQH and BTI boundaries constructed in\nthis paper.\n", "  Predicting the compositional phase stability of strongly correlated electron\nmaterials is an outstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. In this\nwork, we employ the DFT+U formalism to address the effects of local\ncorrelations due to transition metal d electrons on compositional phase\nstability in the prototype phase stable and separating materials LixCoO2 and\nolivine LixFePO4, respectively. We exploit a new spectral decomposition of the\nDFT+U total energy, revealing the distinct roles of the filling and ordering of\nthe d orbital correlated subspace. The on-site interaction U drives both of\nthese very different materials systems towards phase separation, stemming from\nenhanced ordering of the d orbital occupancies in the x=0 and x=1 species,\nwhereas changes in the overall filling of the d shell contribute negligibly. We\nshow that DFT+U formation energies are qualitatively consistent with\nexperiments for phase stable LixCoO2, phase separating LixFePO4, and phase\nstable LixCoPO4. However, we find that charge ordering plays a critical role in\nthe energetics at intermediate x, strongly dampening the tendency for the\nHubbard U to drive phase separation. Most relevantly, the phase stability of\nLi1/2CoO2 within DFT+U is qualitatively incorrect without allowing charge\nordering, which is problematic given that neither charge ordering nor the band\ngap that it induces are observed in experiment. We demonstrate that charge\nordering arises from the correlated subspace interaction energy as opposed to\nthe double counting. Additionally, we predict the Li order-disorder transition\ntemperature for Li1/2CoO2, demonstrating that the unphysical charge ordering\nwithin DFT+U renders the method problematic, often producing unrealistically\nlarge results. Our findings motivate the need for other advanced techniques,\nsuch as DFT+DMFT, for total energies in strongly correlated materials.\n", "  We modelled \\HH\\ and CO formation incorporating the fractionation and\nselective photodissociation affecting CO when \\AV\\ $\\la2$mag. UV absorption\nmeasurements typically have N(\\cotw)/N(\\coth) $\\approx 65$ that are reproduced\nwith the standard UV radiation and little density dependence at n(H)\n$\\approx32-1024\\pccc$: Densities n(H) $\\la256\\pccc$ avoid overproducing CO.\nSightlines observed in mm-wave absorption and a few in UV show enhanced \\coth\\\nby factors of 2-4 and are explained by higher n(H) $\\ga256\\pccc$ and/or weaker\nradiation. The most difficult observations to understand are UV absorptions\nhaving N(\\cotw)/N(\\coth) $>$100 and N(CO)$\\ga10^{15}\\pcc$. Plots of \\WCO\\ vs.\nN(CO) show that \\WCO\\ remains linearly proportional to N(CO) even at high\nopacity owing to sub-thermal excitation. \\cotw\\ and \\coth\\ have nearly the same\ncurve of growth so their ratios of column density/integrated intensity are\ncomparable even when different from the isotopic abundance ratio. For\nn(H)$\\ga128\\pccc$, plots of \\WCO\\ vs N(CH) are insensitive to n(H), and\n\\WCO/N(CO)$\\approx1\\Kkms/(10^{15}~{\\rm CO}\\pcc)$: This compensates for small\nCO/\\HH\\ to make \\WCO\\ more readily detectable. Rapid increases of N(CO) with\nn(H), N(H) and N(\\HH) often render the CO bright, ie a small CO-\\HH\\ conversion\nfactor. For n(H) $\\la64\\pccc$ CO enters the regime of truly weak excitation\nwhere \\WCO $\\propto$n(H)N(CO). \\WCO\\ is a strong function of the average \\HH\\\nfraction and models with \\WCO=1\\Kkms\\ fall in the narrow range \\mfH2\\=0.65-0.8,\nor \\mfH2\\=0.4-0.5 at \\WCO\\=0.1\\Kkms. The insensitivity of easily-detected CO\nemission to gas with small \\mfH2\\ implies that even deep CO surveys using broad\nbeams may not discover substantially more emission.\n", "  The escape rate of a Brownian particle over a potential barrier is accurately\ndescribed by the Kramers theory. A quantitative theory explicitly taking the\nactivity of Brownian particles into account has been lacking due to the\ninherently out-of-equilibrium nature of these particles. Using an effective\nequilibrium approach [Farage et al., Phys. Rev. E 91, 042310 (2015)] we study\nthe escape rate of active particles over a potential barrier and compare our\nanalytical results with data from direct numerical simulation of the colored\nnoise Langevin equation. The effective equilibrium approach generates an\neffective potential which, when used as input to Kramers rate theory, provides\nresults in excellent agreement with the simulation data.\n", "  In (3 + 1) spacetime dimensions the Rainich conditions are a set of equations\nexpressed solely in terms of the metric tensor which are equivalent to the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations for non-null electromagnetic fields. Here we provide\nthe analogous conditions for (2 + 1)-dimensional gravity coupled to\nelectromagnetism. Both the non-null and null cases are treated. The\nconstruction of these conditions is based upon reducing the problem to that of\ngravity coupled to a scalar field, which we have treated elsewhere. These\nconditions can be easily extended to other theories of (2 + 1)-dimensional\ngravity. For example, we apply the geometrization conditions to topologically\nmassive gravity coupled to the electromagnetic field and obtain a family of\nplane-fronted wave solutions.\n", "  We present new planar dyonic black hole solutions of the ${\\mathfrak\n{su}}(N)$ Einstein-Yang-Mills equations in asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nspace-time, focussing on ${\\mathfrak {su}}(2)$ and ${\\mathfrak {su}}(3)$ gauge\ngroups. The magnetic part of the gauge field forms a condensate close to the\nplanar event horizon. We compare the free energy of a non-Abelian hairy black\nhole with that of an embedded Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS)\nblack hole having the same Hawking temperature and electric charge. We find\nthat the hairy black holes have lower free energy. We present evidence that\nthere is a phase transition at a critical temperature, above which the only\nsolutions are embedded RN-AdS black holes. At the critical temperature, an\nRN-AdS black hole can decay into a hairy black hole, and it is\nthermodynamically favourable to do so. Working in the probe limit, we compute\nthe frequency-dependent conductivity, and find that enlarging the gauge group\nfrom ${\\mathfrak {su}}(2)$ to ${\\mathfrak {su}}(3)$ eliminates a divergence in\nthe conductivity at nonzero frequency.\n", "  Collective behavior of bacterial colonies plays critical roles in\nadaptability, survivability, biofilm expansion and infection. We employ an\nindividual-based model of an interstitial biofilm to study emergent pattern\nformation based on the assumptions that rod-shaped bacteria furrow through a\nviscous environment, and excrete extracellular polymeric substances which bias\ntheir rate of motion. Because the bacteria furrow through their environment,\nthe substratum stiffness is a key control parameter behind the formation of\ndistinct morphological patterns. By systematically varying this property (which\nwe quantify with a stiffness coefficient {\\gamma}), we show that subtle changes\nin the substratum stiffness can give rise to a stable state characterized by a\nhigh degree of local order and long-range pattern formation. The ordered state\nexhibits characteristics typically associated with bacterial fitness\nadvantages, even though it is induced by changes in environmental conditions\nrather than changes in biological parameters. Our findings are applicable to\nbroad range of biofilms and provide insights into the relationship between\nbacterial movement and their environment, and basic mechanisms behind\nself-organization of biophysical systems.\n", "  The leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the hyperfine\nsplitting of true muonium is reevaluated in two ways. The first considers a\nmore complex pionic form factor and better estimates of the perturbative QCD\ncontributions. The second, more accurate method directly integrates the Drell\nratio $R(s)$ to obtain $C_{1,\\rm hvp}=-0.0489(3)$. This corresponds to an\nenergy shift in the hyperfine splitting of $\\Delta E^\\mu_{hfs,\\rm\nhvp}=276196(51)$ MHz.\n", "  By analyzing $2.93\\ \\rm fb^{-1}$ of data taken at the $\\psi(3770)$ resonance\npeak with the BESIII detector, we measure the branching fractions for the\nhadronic decays $D^+\\to K^0_SK^0_S K^+$, $D^+\\to K^0_SK^0_S \\pi^+$, $D^0\\to\nK^0_S K^0_S$ and $D^0\\to K^0_SK^0_SK^0_S$. They are determined to be ${\\mathcal\nB}(D^+\\to K^0_SK^0_SK^+)=(2.54 \\pm 0.05_{\\rm stat.} \\pm 0.12_{\\rm sys.})\\times\n10^{-3}$, ${\\mathcal B}(D^+\\to K^0_SK^0_S\\pi^+)=(2.70 \\pm 0.05_{\\rm stat.} \\pm\n0.12_{\\rm sys.})\\times 10^{-3}$, ${\\mathcal B}(D^0\\to K^0_SK^0_S)=(1.67 \\pm\n0.11_{\\rm stat.} \\pm 0.11_{\\rm sys.})\\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\\mathcal B}(D^0\\to\nK^0_SK^0_SK^0_S)=(7.21 \\pm 0.33_{\\rm stat.} \\pm 0.44_{\\rm sys.})\\times\n10^{-4}$, where the second one is measured for the first time and the others\nare measured with significantly improved precision over the previous\nmeasurements.\n", "  Recently, we developed an effective theory of pions and a light dilatonic\nmeson for gauge theories with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry that are\nclose to the conformal window. The pion mass term in this effective theory\ndepends on an exponent $y$. We derive the transformation properties under\ndilatations of the renormalized fermion mass, and use this to rederive\n$y=3-\\gamma_m^*$, where $\\gamma_m^*$ is fixed-point value of the mass anomalous\ndimension at the sill of the conformal window. This value for $y$ is consistent\nwith the trace anomaly of the underlying near-conformal gauge theory.\n", "  Enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity of transition metal-doped\nceria (CeO2) nanomaterials have experimentally been demonstrated, whereas there\nare very few reports mentioning the mechanism of this behavior. Here we use\nfirst-principles calculations to explore the origin of enhanced photocatalytic\nperformance of CeO2 doped with transition metal impurities (Fe, Cr and Co).\nWhen a transition metal atom substitutes a Ce atom into CeO2, t2g and eg levels\nof 3d orbits appear in the middle of band gap owing to the effect of cubic\nligand field, and the former is higher than latter. Interestingly, t2g subset\nof FeCe (CoCe and CrCe)-Vo-CeO2 is split into two parts: one merges into the\nconduction band, the other as well as eg will remain in the gap, because O\nvacancy defect adjacent to transition metal atom will break the symmetry of\ncubic ligand field. These eg and t2g levels in the band gap are beneficial for\nabsorbing visible light and enhancing quantum efficiency because of forbidden\ntransition, which is one key factor for enhanced visible light photocatalytic\nactivity. The band gap narrowing also leads to a redshift of optical absorbance\nand high photoactivity. These findings can rationalize the available\nexperimental results and provide some new insights for designing CeO2-based\nphotocatalysts with high photocatalytic performance.\n", "  We study theoretically the current-voltage characteristics (IVCs) of the\nJosephson field effect transistor - a ballistic SNINS junction with\nsuperconducting (S) electrodes confining a planar normal metal region (N),\nwhich is controlled by the gate induced potential barrier (I). The calculations\nwere performed using the computation technique developed earlier for long\nsingle-channel junctions in the coherent multiple Andreev reflections (MAR)\nregime. We find significant difference of the subgap current structure in these\njunctions compared to the subharmonic gap structure in tunnel junctions and\natomic-size point contacts. For long junctions, whose length significantly\nexceeds the coherence length, the IVC exhibits current peaks at multiples\n(harmonics) of the difference $\\delta_m$ between the static Andreev levels,\n$eV_n = n\\delta_m$. Moreover, the averaged IVC follows the power rather than\nexponential behavior, and has a universal scaling with the junction\ntransparency. This result is qualitatively understood using an analytical\napproach based on the concept of resonant MAR trajectories. In shorter\njunctions whose length is comparable to the coherence length, the IVC has an\nexponential form common for point contacts, however the current structures\nappear at the subharmonics of the Andreev interlevel distance, $eV_n =\n\\delta_m/n$ rather than the gap subharmonics $2\\Delta/n$.\n", "  We show that Fermi repulsion can lead to cored density profiles in dwarf\ngalaxies for sub-keV fermionic dark matter. We treat the dark matter as a\nquasi-degenerate self-gravitating Fermi gas and calculate its density profile\nassuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that suitable dwarf galaxy cores of\nlarger than 130 pc can be achieved for fermion dark matter with mass in the\nrange 70 eV - 400 eV. While in conventional dark matter scenarios, such sub-keV\nthermal dark matter would be excluded by free streaming bounds, the constraints\nare ameliorated in models with dark matter at lower temperature than\nconventional thermal scenarios, such as the Flooded Dark Matter model that we\nhave previously considered. Modifying the arguments of Tremaine and Gunn we\nderive a conservative lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter of 70 eV\nand a stronger lower bound from Lyman-$\\alpha$ clouds of about 470 eV, leading\nto slightly smaller cores than have been observed. We comment on this result\nand how the tension is relaxed in dark matter scenarios with non-thermal\nmomentum distributions.\n", "  We study theoretically and numerically spasing conditions and optical\ndynamics of a composite hyperbolic metamaterial interacting with gain\nmolecules. By combining Maxwell-Bloch equations with Green's function approach,\nwe calculate lasing frequency and threshold population inversion for various\ngain density in the gain layer. We demonstrate high level of enhancement for\nphotonic density of states in spacious spectral range provided by hyperbolic\nmetastructures. We find that direct dipole-dipole interactions between\nmolecules in the gain layer has a negligible effect on spasing conditions. We\nidentify a region of parameters in which spasing can occur considering these\neffects.\n", "  Evidence strongly indicates that the strength of the Sun's polar fields near\nthe time of a sunspot cycle minimum determines the strength of the following\nsolar activity cycle. We use our Advective Flux Transport (AFT) code, with\nflows well constrained by observations, to simulate the evolution of the Sun's\npolar magnetic fields from early 2016 to the end of 2019 --- near the expected\ntime of Cycle 24/25 minimum. We run a series of simulations in which the\nuncertain conditions (convective motion details, active region tilt, and\nmeridional flow profile) are varied within expected ranges. We find that the\naverage strength of the polar fields near the end of Cycle 24 will be similar\nto that measured near the end of Cycle 23, indicating that Cycle 25 will be\nsimilar in strength to the current cycle. In all cases the polar fields are\nasymmetric with fields in the south stronger than those in the north. This\nasymmetry would be more pronounced if not for the predicted weakening of the\nsouthern polar fields in late 2016 and through 2017. After just four years of\nsimulation the variability across our ensemble indicates an accumulated\nuncertainty of about 15\\%. This accumulated uncertainty arises from stochastic\nvariations in the convective motion details, the active region tilt, and\nchanges in the meridional flow profile. These variations limit the ultimate\npredictability of the solar cycle.\n", "  Two particle irreducible effective actions (2PIEAs) are valuable\nnon-perturbative techniques in quantum field theory; however, finite\ntruncations of them violate the Ward identities (WIs) of theories with\nspontaneously broken symmetries. The symmetry improvement (SI) method of\nPilaftsis and Teresi attempts to overcome this by imposing the WIs as\nconstraints on the solution; however the method suffers from the non-existence\nof solutions in linear response theory and in certain truncations in\nequilibrium. Motivated by this, we introduce a new method called soft symmetry\nimprovement (SSI) which relaxes the constraint. Violations of WIs are allowed\nbut punished in a least-squares implementation of the symmetry improvement\nidea. A new parameter $\\xi$ controls the strength of the constraint. The method\ninterpolates between the unimproved ($\\xi \\to \\infty$) and SI ($\\xi \\to 0$)\ncases and the hope is that practically useful solutions can be found for finite\n$\\xi$. We study the SSI-2PIEA for a scalar O(N) model in the Hartree-Fock\napproximation. We find that the method is IR sensitive: the system must be\nformulated in finite volume $V$ and temperature $T=\\beta^{-1}$ and the $V\\beta\n\\to \\infty$ limit taken carefully. Three distinct limits exist. Two are\nequivalent to the unimproved 2PIEA and SI-2PIEA respectively, and the third is\na new limit where the WI is satisfied but the phase transition is strongly\nfirst order and solutions can fail to exist depending on $\\xi$. Further, these\nlimits are disconnected from each other; there is no smooth way to interpolate\nfrom one to another. These results suggest that any potential advantages of SSI\nmethods, and indeed any application of (S)SI methods out of equilibrium, must\noccur in finite volume.\n", "  We show that the renormalizable SO(4) X U (1) X SU (2) X SU (3) Yang Mills\ncoupled to matter and the Higgs field fits all the experimentally observed\ndifferential cross sections known in nature. This extended Standard Model\nreproduces the experimental gravitational differential cross sections without\nresorting to the graviton field and instead by exchanging SO(4) gauge fields.\nBy construction, each SO(4) generator in quantum gravitodynamics does not\ncommute with the Dirac gamma matrices. This produces additional interactions\nabsent to non-Abelian gauge fields in the Standard Model. The contributions\nfrom these new terms yield differential cross sections consistent with the\nNewtonian and post Newtonian interactions derived from General Relativity.\nDimensional analysis of the Lagrangian shows that all its terms have total\ndimensionality four or less and therefore that all physical quantities in the\ntheory renormalize by finite amounts. These properties make QGD the only\nrenormalizable 4-dimensional theory describing gravitational interactions.\n", "  We present a state-of-the-art calculation of the next-to-leading-order\nelectroweak corrections to ZZ production, including the leptonic decays of the\nZ bosons into $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mathrm{e}^+\\mathrm{e}^-$ or $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nfinal states. We use complete leading-order and next-to-leading-order matrix\nelements for four-lepton production, including contributions of virtual photons\nand all off-shell effects of Z bosons, where the finite Z-boson width is taken\ninto account using the complex-mass scheme. The matrix elements are implemented\ninto Monte Carlo programs allowing for the evaluation of arbitrary differential\ndistributions. We present integrated and differential cross sections for the\nLHC at 13 TeV both for an inclusive setup where only lepton identification cuts\nare applied, and for a setup motivated by Higgs-boson analyses in the\nfour-lepton decay channel. The electroweak corrections are divided into\nphotonic and purely weak contributions. The former show the well-known\npronounced tails near kinematical thresholds and resonances; the latter are\ngenerically at the level of $\\sim-5\\%$ and reach several $-10\\%$ in the\nhigh-energy tails of distributions. Comparing the results for\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mathrm{e}^+\\mathrm{e}^-$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$ final states,\nwe find significant differences mainly in distributions that are sensitive to\nthe $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ pairing in the $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$ final state. Differences\nbetween $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mathrm{e}^+\\mathrm{e}^-$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$\nchannels due to interferences of equal-flavour leptons in the final state can\nreach up to $10\\%$ in off-shell-sensitive regions. Contributions induced by\nincoming photons, i.e. photon-photon and quark-photon channels, are included,\nbut turn out to be phenomenologically unimportant.\n", "  Aluminium monoxide, AlO, is likely efficiently depleted from the gas around\noxygen-rich evolved stars to form alumina clusters and dust seeds. Its presence\nin the extended atmospheres of evolved stars has been derived from optical\nspectroscopy. More recently, AlO gas was also detected at long wavelengths\naround the supergiant VY CMa and the oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstar o Cet (Mira A). In search of AlO, we mined data obtained with APEX, the\nIRAM 30m telescope, Herschel/HIFI, SMA, and ALMA, which were primarily aimed at\nstudying other molecular species. We report here on observations of AlO towards\na sample of eight oxygen-rich AGB stars in different rotational transitions, up\nto seven for some stars. We present definite detections of one rotational\ntransition of AlO for o Cet and R Aqr, and tentative detections of one\ntransition for R Dor and o Cet, and two for IK Tau and W Hya. The presented\nspectra of WX Psc, R Cas, and TX Cam show no signature of AlO. For o Cet, R\nAqr, and IK Tau, we find that the AlO(N=9-8) emission likely traces the inner\nparts of the wind, out to only a few tens of AU, where the gas has not yet\nreached its terminal velocity. The conclusive detections of AlO emission in the\ncase of o Cet and R Aqr confirm the presence of AlO gas in outflows of AGB\nstars. The tentative detections further support this. Since most of the\nobservations presented in this study were obtained with stronger emission from\nother species than AlO in mind, observations with higher sensitivity in\ncombination with high angular resolution will improve our understanding of the\npresence and behaviour of AlO. From the current data sets we cannot firmly\nconclude whether there is a direct correlation between the wind properties and\nthe detection rate of AlO emission. We hope that this study can serve as a\nstimulus to perform sample studies in search of AlO in oxygen-rich outflows.\n", "  Perturbative probability conservation provides a strong constraint on the\npresence of new interactions of the Higgs boson. In this work we consider CP\nviolating Higgs interactions in conjunction with unitarity constraints in the\ngauge-Higgs and fermion-Higgs sectors. Injecting signal strength measurements\nof the recently discovered Higgs boson allows us to make concrete and\ncorrelated predictions of how CP-violation in the Higgs sector can be directly\nconstrained through collider searches for either characteristic new states or\ntell-tale enhancements in multi-Higgs processes.\n", "  We report the first experimental evidence of Alfvenic ion temperature\ngradient (AITG) modes in HL-2A Ohmic plasmas. A group of oscillations with\n$f=15-40$ kHz and $n=3-6$ is detected by various diagnostics in high-density\nOhmic regimes. They appear in the plasmas with peaked density profiles and weak\nmagnetic shear, which indicates that corresponding instabilities are excited by\npressure gradients. The time trace of the fluctuation spectrogram can be either\na frequency staircase, with different modes excited at different times or\nmultiple modes may simultaneously coexist. Theoretical analyses by the extended\ngeneralized fishbone-like dispersion relation (GFLDR-E) reveal that mode\nfrequencies scale with ion diamagnetic drift frequency and $\\eta_i$, and they\nlie in KBM-AITG-BAE frequency ranges. AITG modes are most unstable when the\nmagnetic shear is small in low pressure gradient regions. Numerical solutions\nof the AITG/KBM equation also illuminate why AITG modes can be unstable for\nweak shear and low pressure gradients. It is worth emphasizing that these\ninstabilities may be linked to the internal transport barrier (ITB) and H-mode\npedestal physics for weak magnetic shear.\n", "  A stable nonlinear wave packet, self-localized in all three dimensions, is an\nintriguing and much sought after object in nonlinear science in general and in\nnonlinear photonics in particular. We report on the experimental observation of\nmode-locked spatial laser solitons in a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser\nwith frequency-selective feedback from an external cavity. These spontaneously\nemerging and long-term stable spatio-temporal structures have a pulse length\nshorter than the cavity round trip time and may pave the way to completely\nindependent cavity light bullets.\n", "  The recently reported gravitational wave events GW$150914$ and GW$151226$\ncaused by the mergers of binary black holes\n[arXiv:1602.03841],[arXiv:1606.04855],[arXiv:1606.04856] provide a formidable\nway to set constraints on alternative metric theories of gravity in the strong\nfield regime. In this paper, we develop an approach where an arbitrary theory\nof gravity can be parametrised by an effective coupling $G_{eff}$ and an\neffective gravitational potential $\\Phi(r)$. The standard Newtonian limit of\nGeneral Relativity is recovered as soon as $G_{eff}\\rightarrow G_N$ and\n$\\Phi(r)\\rightarrow \\Phi_{N}$. The upper bound on the graviton mass and the\ngravitational interaction length, reported by the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration, can\nbe directly recast in terms of the parameters of the theory which allows an\nanalysis where the gravitational wave frequency modulation sets constraints on\nthe range of possible alternative models of gravity. Numerical results based on\npublished parameters for the binary black hole mergers are also reported.\nComparison of the observed phase of the GW$150914$ and GW$151226$ with the\nmodulated phase in alternative theories of gravity does not give reasonable\nconstraints due the large uncertainties in the estimated parameters for the\ncoalescing black holes. In addition to these general considerations, we obtain\nlimits for the frequency dependence of the $\\alpha$ parameter in scalar tensor\ntheories of gravity.\n", "  The inversion in the sphere or Kelvin transformation, which exchanges the\nradial coordinate for its inverse, is used as a guide to relate distinct\nelectrostatic problems with dual features. The exact solution of some\nnontrivial problems are obtained through the mapping from simple highly\nsymmetric systems. In particular, the concept of multipole expansion is\nrevisited from a point of view opposed to the usual one: the sources are\ndistributed in a region far from the origin while the electrostatic potential\nis described at points close to it.\n", "  Quarkonium production offers good possibilities to study gluon TMDs. In this\nproceedings contribution this topic is explored for the linearly polarized\ngluons inside unpolarized hadrons and unpolarized gluons inside transversely\npolarized hadrons. It is argued that $\\chi_{b0/2}$ and $\\eta_b$ production at\nLHC are best to study the effects of linearly polarized gluons in hadronic\ncollisions, by means of angular independent ratios of ratios of cross sections.\nThis can be directly compared to $\\cos 2\\phi$ asymmetries in heavy quark pair\nand dijet production in DIS at a future high-energy Electron-Ion Collider\n(EIC), which probe the same TMDs. In the small-$x$ limit this corresponds to\nthe Weizs\\\"acker-Williams (WW) gluon distributions, which should show a change\nin behavior for transverse momenta around the saturation scale. Together with\ninvestigations of the dipole (DP) gluon distributions, this can provide\nvaluable information about the polarization of the Color Glass Condensate if\nsufficiently small $x$ are reached. Quarkonia can also be useful in the study\nof single transverse spin asymmetries. For transversely polarized hadrons the\ngluon distribution can be asymmetric, which is referred to as the Sivers\neffect. It leads to single spin asymmetries in for instance $J/\\psi$ (pair)\nproduction at AFTER@LHC, which probe the WW or $f$-type gluon Sivers TMD. It\nallows for a test of a sign-change relation w.r.t. the gluon Sivers TMD probed\nat an EIC in open heavy quark pair production. Single spin asymmetries in\nbackward inclusive $C$-odd quarkonium production, such as $J/\\psi$ production,\nmay offer probes of the DP or $d$-type gluon Sivers TMD at small $x$-values in\nthe polarized proton, which in that limit corresponds to a correlator of a\nsingle Wilson loop, describing the spin-dependent odderon.\n", "  We calculate the two-photon exchange correction to the Lamb shift in muonic\nhelium-3 ions within the dispersion relations framework. Part of the effort\nentailed making analytic fits to the electron-$^3$He quasielastic scattering\ndata set, for purposes of doing the dispersion integrals. Our result is that\nthe energy of the 2$S$ state is shifted downwards by two-photon exchange\neffects by 15.14(49) meV, in good accord with the result obtained from a\npotential model and effective field theory calculation.\n", "  We analyze the ${\\it Kepler}$ monitoring light curve of a blazar W2R\n1926$+$42 to examine features of microvariability by means of the \"shot\nanalysis\" technique. We select 195 intra-day, flare-like variations (shots) for\nthe continuous light curve of Quarter 14 with a duration of 100 d. In the\napplication of the shot analysis, an averaged profile of variations is assumed\nto converge with a universal profile which reflects a physical mechanism\ngenerating the microvariability in a blazar jet, although light-variation\nprofiles of selected shots show a variety. A mean profile, which is obtained by\naligning the peaks of the 195 shots, is composed of a spiky-shape shot\ncomponent at $\\pm$0.1 d (with respect to the time of the peak), and two slow\nvarying components ranging from $-$0.50 d to $-$0.15 d and from 0.10 d to 0.45\nd of the peak time. The former spiky feature is well represented by an\nexponential rise of 0.043$\\pm$0.001 d and an exponential decay of\n0.061$\\pm$0.002 d. These timescales are consistent with that corresponding to a\nbreak frequency of a power spectrum density calculated from the obtained light\ncurve. After verification with the Monte-Carlo method, the exponential shape,\nbut not the observed asymmetry, of the shot component can be explained by noise\nvariation. The asymmetry is difficult to explain through a geometrical effect\n(i.e. changes of the geometry of the emitting region), but is more likely to be\ncaused by the production and dissipation of high-energy accelerated particles\nin the jet. Additionally, durations of the detected shots show a systematic\nvariation with a dispersion caused by a statistical randomness. A comparison\nwith the variability of Cygnus X-1 is also briefly discussed.\n", "  Feynman amplitudes of light-cone gauge superstring field theory are\nill-defined because of various divergences. In a previous paper, one of the\nauthors showed that taking the worldsheet theory to be the one in a linear\ndilaton background $\\Phi=-iQX^{1}$ with Feynman $i\\varepsilon$\n$(\\varepsilon>0)$ and $Q^{2}>10$ yields finite amplitudes. In this paper, we\napply this worldsheet theory to dimensional regularization of the light-cone\ngauge NSR superstring field theory. We concentrate on the amplitudes for even\nspin structure with external lines in the (NS,NS) sector. We show that the\nmultiloop amplitudes are indeed regularized in our scheme and that they\ncoincide with the results in the first-quantized formalism through the analytic\ncontinuation $Q\\to0$.\n", "  A $\\gamma$-ray transient, Swift J0644.5-5111, has been claimed to be\nassociated with FRB 131104. The $\\gamma$-ray energy output is estimated as\n$E_\\gamma \\approx 5\\times 10^{51}$\\,erg at the nominal $z\\approx 0.55$ redshift\nimplied by the dispersion measure of FRB 131104. However, a long-term radio\nimaging follow-up observations only place an upper limit on the radio afterglow\nflux of Swift J0644.5-5111. Applying the external shock model, we make a\ndetailed constraint on the afterglow parameters for the FRB 131104/Swift\nJ0644.5-5111 system. We find that for the commonly used microphysics shock\nparameters (e.g., $\\epsilon_e=0.1$, $\\epsilon_B=0.01$ and $p=2.3$), if the\nredshift value inferred from the DM value is correct to order of magnitude\n(i.e., $z>0.1$), the ambient medium number density should be $\\leq\n10^{-3}~\\rm{cm^{-3}}$, which is the typical value for a compact binary merger\nenvironment but disfavors a massive star origin. Assuming a typical ISM\ndensity, one would require that the redshift of the FRB much smaller than the\nvalue inferred from DM value ($z\\ll0.1$), implying a non-cosmological origin of\nDM. The constraints are much looser if one adopts smaller $\\epsilon_B$ and\n$\\epsilon_e$ values, as observed in some GRB afterglows. The FRB 131104/Swift\nJ0644.5-5111 association remains plausible. We critically discuss possible\nprogenitor models for the system.\n", "  We study the hierarchical stellar structures in a $\\sim$1.5 deg$^2$ area\ncovering the 30 Doradus-N158-N159-N160 star-forming complex with the VISTA\nSurvey of the Magellanic Clouds. Based on the young upper main-sequence stars,\nwe find that the surface densities cover a wide range of values, from\nlog($\\Sigma\\cdot$pc$^2$) $\\lesssim$ $-$2.0 to log($\\Sigma\\cdot$pc$^2$)\n$\\gtrsim$ 0.0. Their distributions are highly non-uniform, showing groups that\nfrequently have sub-groups inside. The sizes of the stellar groups do not\nexhibit characteristic values, and range continuously from several parsecs to\nmore than 100 pc; the cumulative size distribution can be well described by a\nsingle power law, with the power-law index indicating a projected fractal\ndimension $D_2$ = 1.6 $\\pm$ 0.3. We suggest that the phenomena revealed here\nsupport a scenario of hierarchical star formation. Comparisons with other\nstar-forming regions and galaxies are also discussed.\n", "  We use the method of differential equations to analytically evaluate all\nplanar three-loop Feynman integrals relevant for form factor calculations\ninvolving massive particles. Our results for ninety master integrals at general\n$q^2$ are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms, and results for\nfiftyone master integrals at the threshold $q^2=4m^2$ are expressed in terms of\nmultiple polylogarithms of argument one, with indices equal to zero or to a\nsixth root of unity.\n", "  We investigated the star formation activities in the AFGL333 region, which is\nin the vicinity of the W4 expanding bubble, by conducting NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and\n(3,3) mapping observations with the 45 m Nobeyama Radio Telescope at an angular\nresolution of 75\". The morphology of the NH3 (1,1) map shows a bow-shape\nstructure with the size of 2.0 x 0.6 pc as seen in the dust continuum. At the\ninterface between the W4 bubble and the dense NH3 cloud, the compact HII region\nG134.2+0.8, associated with IRAS02245+6115, is located. Interestingly, just\nnorth and south of G134.2+0.8 we found NH3 emission exhibiting large velocity\nwidths of ~ 2.8 km/s, compared to 1.8 km/s at the other positions. As the\npossibility of mechanical energy injection through the activity of YSO(s) is\nlow, we considered the origin of the large turbulent gas motion as indication\nof interaction between the compact HII region and the periphery of the dense\nmolecular cloud. We also found expanding motion of the CO emission associated\nwith G134.2+0.8. The overall structure of the AFGL333-Ridge might have been\nformed by the expanding bubble of W4. However, the small velocity widths\nobserved west of IRAS02245+6115, around the center of the dense molecular\ncloud, suggest that interaction with the compact HII region is limited.\nTherefore the YSOs (dominantly Class 0/I) in the core of the AFGL333-Ridge\ndense molecular cloud most likely formed in quiescent mode. As has been\npreviously suggested for the large scale star formation in the W3 giant\nmolecular cloud, our results show an apparent coexistence of induced and\nquiescent star formation in this region. It appears that star formation in the\nAFGL333 region has proceeded without significant external triggers, but\naccompanying stellar feedback environment.\n", "  The joint statistical properties of two free energies computed at two\ndifferent temperatures in {\\it the same sample} of $(1+1)$ directed polymers is\nstudied in terms of the replica technique. The scaling dependence of the\nreduced free energies difference ${\\cal F} = F(T_{1})/T_{1} - F(T_{2})/T_{2}$\non the two temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ is derived. In particular, it is\nshown that if the two temperatures $T_{1} \\, < \\, T_{2}$ are close to each\nother the typical value of the fluctuating part of the reduced free energies\ndifference ${\\cal F}$ is proportional to $(1 - T_{1}/T_{2})^{1/3}$. It is also\nshown that the left tail asymptotics of this free energy difference probability\ndistribution function coincides with the corresponding tail of the TW\ndistribution.\n", "  In the theory of the chiral anomaly in relativistic quantum field theories\n(RQFT) some results depend on regularization scheme at ultraviolet. In the\nchiral superfluid 3He-A, which contains two Weyl points and also experiences\nthe effects of chiral anomaly, the \"trans-Planckian\" physics is known and the\nresults can be obtained without regularization. We discuss this on example of\nthe chiral magnetic effect (CME), which has been observed in 3He-A in 90's.\nThere are two forms of the contribution of the CME to the Chern-Simons term in\nfree energy, perturbative and non-perturbative. The perturbative term comes\nfrom the fermions living in the vicinity of the Weyl point, where the fermions\nare \"relativistic\" and obey the Weyl equation. The non-perturbative term\noriginates from the deep vacuum, being determined by the separation of the two\nWeyl points. Both terms are obtained using the Adler-Bell-Jackiw equation for\nchiral anomaly, and both agree with the results of the microscopic calculations\nin the \"trans-Planckian\" region. Existence of the two nonequivalent forms of\nthe Chern-Simons term demonstrates that the results obtained within the RQFT\ndepend on the specific properties of the underlying quantum vacuum and may\nreflect different physical phenomena in the same vacuum.\n", "  We report a study of the reorientation of the helimagnetic order in the\narchetypal cubic chiral magnet MnSi as a function of magnetic field direction.\nThe reorientation process as inferred from small-angle neutron scattering, the\nmagnetization, and the ac susceptibility is in excellent agreement with an\neffective mean-field theory taking into account the precise symmetries of the\ncrystallographic space group. Depending on the field and temperature history\nand the direction of the field with respect to the crystalline axes, the helix\nreorientation may exhibit a crossover, a first-order, or a second-order\ntransition. The magnetization and ac susceptibility provide evidence that the\nreorientation of helimagnetic domains is associated with large relaxation times\nexceeding seconds. At the second-order transitions residual Ising symmetries\nare spontaneously broken at continuous elastic instabilities of the\nhelimagnetic order. In addition, on the time scales explored in our experiments\nthese transitions are hysteretic as a function of field suggesting, within the\nsame theoretical framework, the formation of an abundance of plastic\ndeformations of the helical spin order. These deformations comprise\ntopologically non-trivial disclinations, promising novel routes to spintronics\napplications alongside skyrmions discovered recently in the same class of\nmaterials.\n", "  Magnetic random access memory schemes employing magnetoelectric coupling to\nwrite binary information promise outstanding energy efficiency. We propose and\ndemonstrate a purely antiferromagnetic magnetoelectric random access memory\n(AF-MERAM) that offers a remarkable 50 fold reduction of the writing threshold\ncompared to ferromagnet-based counterparts, is robust against magnetic\ndisturbances and exhibits no ferromagnetic hysteresis losses. Using the\nmagnetoelectric antiferromagnet Cr2O3, we demonstrate reliable isothermal\nswitching via gate voltage pulses and all-electric readout at room temperature.\nAs no ferromagnetic component is present in the system, the writing magnetic\nfield does not need to be pulsed for readout, allowing permanent magnets to be\nused. Based on our prototypes of these novel systems, we construct a\ncomprehensive model of the magnetoelectric selection mechanism in thin films of\nmagnetoelectric antiferromagnets. We identify that growth induced effects lead\nto emergent ferrimagnetism, which is detrimental to the robustness of the\nstorage. After pinpointing lattice misfit as the likely origin, we provide\nroutes to enhance or mitigate this emergent ferrimagnetism as desired. Beyond\nmemory applications, the AF-MERAM concept introduces a general all-electric\ninterface for antiferromagnets and should find wide applicability in purely\nantiferromagnetic spintronics devices.\n", "  The connection between accretion and jet production in accreting white dwarf\nbinary systems, especially dwarf novae, is not well understood. Radio\nwavelengths provide key insights into the mechanisms responsible for\naccelerating electrons, including jets and outflows. Here we present\ndensely-sampled radio coverage, obtained with the Arcminute MicroKelvin Imager\nLarge Array, of the dwarf nova SS Cyg during its February 2016 anomalous\noutburst. The outburst displayed a slower rise (3 days per mag) in the optical\nthan typical ones, and lasted for more than 3 weeks. Rapid radio flaring on\ntimescales <1 hour was seen throughout the outburst. The most intriguing\nbehavior in the radio was towards the end of the outburst where a fast,\nluminous (\"giant\"), flare peaking at ~20 mJy and lasting for 15 minutes was\nobserved. This is the first time that such a flare has been observed in SS Cyg,\nand insufficient coverage could explain its non-detection in previous\noutbursts. These data, together with past radio observations, are consistent\nwith synchrotron emission from plasma ejection events as being the origin of\nthe radio flares. However, the production of the giant flare during the\ndeclining accretion rate phase remains unexplained within the standard\naccretion-jet framework and appears to be markedly different to similar\npatterns of behavior in X-ray binaries.\n", "  We reconsider the possibility that the tension in the $|V_{cb}|$\ndeterminations from inclusive and exclusive $B$ decay modes is due to a new\nphysics effect. We modify the Standard Model effective Hamiltonian for\nsemileptonic $b \\to c$ transitions including a tensor operator with a lepton\nflavour dependent coupling $\\epsilon_T^\\ell$, and investigate separately the\nmuon and electron modes. The interference term between SM and NP, proportional\nto the lepton mass, has different impact in the inclusive and exclusive $B$\nmodes to muon. Moreover, even when the lepton mass is small as for the\nelectron, the NP effect is different in inclusive and exclusive $B$ channels.\nFor both $\\mu$ and $e$ we find a region of $\\epsilon_T^{\\mu,\\,e}$ where the\nconstraints from $B^- \\to D^{(*)0} \\ell^- {\\bar \\nu}_\\ell$ and $B \\to X_c \\,\n\\ell \\, \\bar \\nu_\\ell$ are satisfied for the same $|V_{cb}|$.\n", "  We investigate the effects of external electric fields on the electronic\nproperties of bilayer armchair graphene nano-ribbons. Using atomistic\nsimulations with Tight Binding calculations and the Non-equilibrium Green\nfunction formalism, we demonstrate that (i) in semi-metallic structures,\nvertical fields impact more effectively than transverse fields in terms of\nopening larger bandgap, showing a contrary phenomenon compared to that\ndemonstrated in previous studies in bilayer zigzag graphene nano-ribbons; (ii)\nin some semiconducting structures, if transverse fields just show usual effects\nas in single layer armchair graphene nano-ribbons where the bandgap is\nsuppressed when varying the applied potential, vertical fields exhibit an\nanomalous phenomenon that the bandgap can be enlarged, i.e., for a structure of\nwidth of 16 dimer lines, the bandgap increases from 0.255 eV to the maximum\nvalue of 0.40 eV when a vertical bias equates 0.96 V applied. Although the\ncombined effect of two fields does not enlarge the bandgap as found in bilayer\nzigzag graphene nano-ribbons, it shows that the mutual effect can be useful to\nreduce faster the bandgap in semiconducting bilayer armchair graphene\nnano-ribbons. These results are important to fully understand the effects of\nelectric fields on bilayer graphene nano-ribbons (AB stacking) and also suggest\nappropriate uses of electric gates with different edge orientations.\n", "  We make publicly available a catalog of calibrated environmental measures for\ngalaxies in the five 3D-HST/CANDELS deep fields. Leveraging the spectroscopic\nand grism redshifts from the 3D-HST survey, multi wavelength photometry from\nCANDELS, and wider field public data for edge corrections, we derive densities\nin fixed apertures to characterize the environment of galaxies brighter than\n$JH_{140} < 24$ mag in the redshift range $0.5<z<3.0$. By linking observed\ngalaxies to a mock sample, selected to reproduce the 3D-HST sample selection\nand redshift accuracy, each 3D-HST galaxy is assigned a probability density\nfunction of the host halo mass, and a probability that is a central or a\nsatellite galaxy. The same procedure is applied to a $z=0$ sample selected from\nSDSS. We compute the fraction of passive central and satellite galaxies as a\nfunction of stellar and halo mass, and redshift, and then derive the fraction\nof galaxies that were quenched by environment specific processes. Using the\nmock sample, we estimate that the timescale for satellite quenching is $t_{\\rm\nquench} \\sim 2-5$ Gyr; longer at lower stellar mass or lower redshift, but\nremarkably independent of halo mass. This indicates that, in the range of\nenvironments commonly found within the 3D-HST sample, satellites are quenched\nby exhaustion of their gas reservoir in absence of cosmological accretion. We\nfind that the quenching times can be separated into a delay phase during which\nsatellite galaxies behave similarly to centrals at fixed stellar mass, and a\nphase where the star formation rate drops rapidly ($\\sim 0.4-0.6$ Gyr), as\nshown previously at $z=0$. We conclude that this scenario requires satellite\ngalaxies to retain a large reservoir of multi-phase gas upon accretion, even at\nhigh redshift, and that this gas sustains star formation for the long quenching\ntimes observed.\n", "  The experimental realization of 2D Bose gases with a tunable interaction\nstrength is an important challenge for the study of ultracold quantum matter.\nHere we report on the realization of an optical accordion creating a lattice\npotential with a spacing that can be dynamically tuned between 11$\\,\\mu$m and\n2$\\,\\mu$m. We show that we can load ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms into a single\nnode of this optical lattice in the large spacing configuration and then\ndecrease nearly adiabatically the spacing to reach a strong harmonic\nconfinement with frequencies larger than $\\omega_z/2\\pi=10\\,$kHz. Atoms are\ntrapped in an additional flat-bottom in-plane potential that is shaped with a\nhigh resolution. By combining these tools we create custom-shaped uniform 2D\nBose gases with tunable confinement along the transverse direction and hence\nwith a tunable interaction strength.\n", "  We present the ultra-low-temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity\nmeasurements on the single crystals of YbMgGaO$_4$, which was recently argued\nto be a promising candidate for quantum spin liquid (QSL). In the zero magnetic\nfield, a large magnetic contribution of specific heat is observed, and exhibits\na power-law temperature dependence ($C_m \\sim T^{0.74}$). On the contrary, we\ndo not observed any significant contribution of thermal conductivity from\nmagnetic excitations. In magnetic fields $H \\ge$ 6 T, the exponential\n$T$-dependence of $C_m$ and the enhanced thermal conductivity indicate a magnon\ngap of the fully-polarized state. The absence of magnetic thermal conductivity\nat the zero field in this QSL candidate puts a strong constraint on the\ntheories of its ground state.\n", "  The technique of discrimination of the $e^+e^-\\to e^+e^-$ and $e^+e^-\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ events in energy range $0.5 < \\sqrt{s} < 1$ GeV by energy\ndeposition in the calorimeter of SND detector was developed by applying machine\nlearning method. Identification efficiency for $e^+e^-\\to e^+e^-$ and\n$e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ events in the range from 99.3 to 99.8 % has been\nachived.\n", "  NGC 1808 is a nearby barred spiral galaxy which hosts young stellar clusters\nin a patchy circumnuclear ring with a radius of $\\sim 240\\,\\mathrm{pc}$. In\norder to study the gaseous and stellar kinematics and the star formation\nproperties of the clusters, we perform seeing-limited $H+K$-band near-infrared\nintegral-field spectroscopy with SINFONI of the inner $\\sim 600\\,\\mathrm{pc}$.\nFrom the $M_\\mathrm{BH}-\\sigma_*$ relation, we find a black hole mass of a few\n$10^7\\,M_\\odot$. We estimate the age of the young stellar clusters in the\ncircumnuclear ring to be $\\lesssim 10\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$. No age gradient along the\nring is visible. However, the starburst age is comparable to the travel time\nalong the ring, indicating that the clusters almost completed a full orbit\nalong the ring during their life time. In the central $\\sim 600\\,\\mathrm{pc}$,\nwe find a hot molecular gas mass of $\\sim 730\\,M_\\odot$ which, with standard\nconversion factors, corresponds to a large cold molecular gas reservoir of\nseveral $10^8\\,M_\\odot$, in accordance with CO measurements from the\nliterature. The gaseous and stellar kinematics show several deviations from\npure disc motion, including a circumnuclear disc and signs of a nuclear bar\npotential. In addition, we confirm streaming motions on $\\sim 200\\,\\mathrm{pc}$\nscale that have recently been detected in CO(1-0) emission. Due to our enhanced\nangular resolution of $<1\\,\\mathrm{arcsec}$, we find further streaming motion\nwithin the inner arcsecond, that have not been detected until now. Despite the\nflow of gas towards the centre, no signs for significant AGN activity are\nfound. This raises the questions what determines whether the infalling gas will\nfuel an AGN or star formation.\n", "  Solar electron beams responsible for type III radio emission generate\nLangmuir waves as they propagate out from the Sun. The Langmuir waves are\nobserved via in-situ electric field measurements. These Langmuir waves are not\nsmoothly distributed but occur in discrete clumps, commonly attributed to the\nturbulent nature of the solar wind electron density. Exactly how the density\nturbulence modulates the Langmuir wave electric fields is understood only\nqualitatively. Using weak turbulence simulations, we investigate how solar wind\ndensity turbulence changes the probability distribution functions, mean value\nand variance of the beam-driven electric field distributions. Simulations show\nrather complicated forms of the distribution that are dependent upon how the\nelectric fields are sampled. Generally the higher magnitude of density\nfluctuations reduce the mean and increase the variance of the distribution in a\nconsistent manor to the predictions from resonance broadening by density\nfluctuations. We also demonstrate how the properties of the electric field\ndistribution should vary radially from the Sun to the Earth and provide a\nnumerical prediction for the in-situ measurements of the upcoming Solar Orbiter\nand Solar Probe Plus spacecraft.\n", "  Introducing up-down asymmetry into the tokamak magnetic equilibria appears to\nbe a feasible method to drive fast intrinsic toroidal rotation in future large\ndevices. In this paper we investigate how the intrinsic momentum transport\ngenerated by up-down asymmetric shaping scales with the mode number of the\nshaping effects. Making use the gyrokinetic tilting symmetry (Ball et al (2016)\nPlasma Phys. Control. Fusion 58 045023), we study the effect of envelopes\ncreated by the beating of different high-order shaping effects. This reveals\nthat the presence of an envelope can change the scaling of the momentum flux\nfrom exponentially small in the limit of large shaping mode number to just\npolynomially small. This enhancement of the momentum transport requires the\nenvelope to be both up-down asymmetric and have a spatial scale on the order of\nthe minor radius.\n", "  A subcell technique for calculation of optical properties of graphene with\nthe finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is presented. The technique\ntakes into account the surface conductivity of graphene which allows the\ncorrect calculation of its dispersive response for arbitrarily polarized\nincident waves interacting with the graphene.The developed technique is\nverified for a planar graphene sheet configuration against the exact analytical\nsolution. Based on the same test case scenario, we also show that the subcell\ntechnique demonstrates a superior accuracy and numerical efficiency with\nrespect to the widely used thin-film FDTD approach for modeling graphene. We\nfurther apply our technique to the simulations of a graphene metamaterial\ncontaining periodically spaced graphene strips (graphene strip-grating) and\ndemonstrate good agreement with the available theoretical results.\n", "  The (111) surface of Cu, Ag and Au is characterized by a band of surface\nShockley states, with constant density of states beginning slightly below the\nFermi energy. These states as well as bulk states hybridize with magnetic\nimpurities which can be placed above the surface. We calculate the\ncharacteristic low-temperature energy scale, the Kondo temperature $T_K$ of the\nimpurity Anderson model, as the bottom of the conduction band $D_s$ crosses the\nFermi energy $\\epsilon_F$. We find simple power laws $T_K \\simeq\n|D_s-\\epsilon_F|^{\\eta}$, where $\\eta$ depends on the sign of $D_s-\\epsilon_F$,\nthe ratio between surface and bulk hybridizations with the impurity\n$\\Delta_s/\\Delta_b$ and the ratio between on-site and Coulomb energy $E_d/U$ in\nthe model.\n", "  We compute the order $\\alpha_s^2$ QCD corrections to the $b$-quark\nforward-backward asymmetry in $e^+e^-\\to b{\\bar b}$ collisions at the $Z$ boson\nresonance, taking the non-zero mass of the $b$ quark into account. We determine\nthese corrections with respect to both the $b$-quark axis and the thrust axis\ndefinition of the asymmetry. We compute also the distributions of these axes\nwith respect to the electron beam. If one neglects the flavor singlet\ncontributions to the $b$-quark asymmetry, as was done in previous computations\nfor massless $b$ quarks, then the second-order QCD corrections for $m_b\\neq 0$\nare smaller in magnitude than the corresponding corrections for $m_b=0$.\nIncluding the singlet contributions slightly increases the magnitude of the\ncorrections. The massive $\\alpha_s^2$ corrections to the $b$-quark\nforward-backward asymmetry slightly diminish the well-known tension between the\nbare $b$-quark asymmetry and the standard model fit from $2.9\\sigma$ to\n$2.6\\sigma$.\n", "  The nonrelativistic limit of nonlocal modifications to the Klein Gordon\noperator is studied, and the experimental possibilities of casting stringent\nconstraints on the nonlocality scale via planned and/or current optomechanical\nexperiments are discussed. Details of the perturbative analysis and\nsemianalitical simulations leading to the dynamical evolution of a quantum\nharmonic oscillator in the presence of non locality reported in [1], together\nwith a comprehensive account of the experimental methodology with particular\nregard to sensitivity limitations related to thermal decoherence time and\nactive cooling of the oscillator, are given. Finally, a strategy for detecting\nnon-locality scales of the order of $10^{- 22} \\div 10^{- 26}$ m by means of\nthe spontaneous time periodic squeezing of quantum coherent states is provided.\n", "  In this work, two new axisymmetric models for the Galactic mass distribution\nare presented. Motivated by recent results, these two models include the\ncontribution of a stellar thin disc and of a thick disc, as massive as the thin\ncounterpart but with a shorter scale-length. Both models satisfy a number of\nobservational constraints: stellar densities at the solar vicinity, thin and\nthick disc scale lengths and heights, rotation curve(s), and the absolute value\nof the perpendicular force Kz as a function of distance to the Galactic centre.\nWe numerically integrate into these new models the motion of all Galactic\nglobular clusters for which distances, proper motions, and radial velocities\nare available, and the orbits of about one thousand stars in the solar\nvicinity. The retrieved orbital characteristics are compared to those obtained\nby integrating the clusters and stellar orbits in pure thin disc models. We\nfind that, due to the possible presence of a thick disc, the computed orbital\nparameters of disc stars can vary by as much as 30-40%. We also show that the\nsystematic uncertainties that affect the rotation curve still plague computed\norbital parameters of globular clusters by similar amounts.\n", "  We establish a link between the phenomenon of Taylor dispersion and the\ntheory of empirical distributions. Using this connection, we derive, upon\napplying the theory of large deviations, an alternative and much more precise\ndescription of the long-time regime for Taylor dispersion.\n", "  Two important sources of information about sunspots in the Maunder minimum\nare the Sp\\\"orer catalog and observations of the Paris observatory, which cover\nin total the last quarter of the 17th and the first two decades of the 18th\ncentury.\n  These data, in particular, contain information about sunspot latitudes. As we\nshowed in previous papers, dispersions of sunspot latitude distributions are\ntightly related to sunspot indices, so we can estimate the level of solar\nactivity in this epoch by a method which is not based on direct calculation of\nsunspots and is weakly affected by loss of observational data.\n  The latitude distributions of sunspots in the time of transition from the\nMaunder minimum to the common regime of solar activity proved to be wide\nenough. It gives evidences in favor of, first, not very low cycle No. -3\n(1712-1723) with the Wolf number in maximum W=$100\\pm50$, and, second, nonzero\nactivity in the maximum of cycle No. -4 (1700-1711) W=$60\\pm45$.\n  Therefore, the latitude distributions in the end of the Maunder minimum are\nin better agreement with the traditional Wolf number and new revisited indices\nof activity SN and GN than with the GSN; the latter provide much lower level of\nactivity in this epoch.\n", "  Motivated by the problem of Casimir energy, we investigate the idea of using\ninhomogeneity of surfaces instead of their corrugation, which leads to Casimir\ninteraction between two inhomogeneous semi-transparent concentric cylinders.\nUsing the multiple scattering method, we study the Casimir energy and torque\nbetween the cylinders with different potentials subjected to Dirichlet boundary\nconditions, both in weak and strong coupling regimes. We also extend our\nformalism to the case of two inhomogeneous dielectrics in a weak coupling\nregime.\n", "  We present a new cosmological model that mimics the Lambda Cold Dark Matter\nby using a stealth field. This kind of field is characterized as not coupling\ndirectly to gravity; however, it is connected to the underlying matter content\nof the universe model. As is known, stealth fields do not back-react on the\nspace-time; however, their mimicry skills show how this field and its\nself-interaction potential determines the cosmic evolution. We show the study\nof the simplest model that can be developed with the stealth field.\n", "  The absolute frequency of the $^{87}{\\rm Sr}$ clock transition measured in\n2015 was reevaluated using an improved frequency link to the SI second. The\nscale interval of International Atomic Time (TAI) that we used as the reference\nwas calibrated for an evaluation interval of five days instead of the\nconventional interval of one month which is regularly employed in Circular T.\nThe calibration on a five-day basis removed the uncertainty in assimilating the\nTAI scale of the five-day mean to that of the one-month mean. The reevaluation\nresulted in the total uncertainty of $10^{-16}$ level for the first time\nwithout local cesium fountains. Since there are presumably no correlations\namong systematic shifts of cesium fountains worldwide, the measurement is not\nlimited by the systematic uncertainty of a specific primary frequency standard.\n", "  We present a uniform analysis of the atmospheric escape rate of Neptune-like\nplanets with estimated radius and mass (restricted to $M_{\\rm\np}<30\\,M_{\\oplus}$). For each planet we compute the restricted Jeans escape\nparameter, $\\Lambda$, for a hydrogen atom evaluated at the planetary mass,\nradius, and equilibrium temperature. Values of $\\Lambda\\lesssim20$ suggest\nextremely high mass-loss rates. We identify 27 planets (out of 167) that are\nsimultaneously consistent with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and are expected\nto exhibit extreme mass-loss rates. We further estimate the mass-loss rates\n($L_{\\rm hy}$) of these planets with tailored atmospheric hydrodynamic models.\nWe compare $L_{\\rm hy}$ to the energy-limited (maximum-possible high-energy\ndriven) mass-loss rates. We confirm that 25 planets (15\\% of the sample)\nexhibit extremely high mass-loss rates ($L_{\\rm hy}>0.1\\,M_{\\oplus}{\\rm\nGyr}^{-1}$), well in excess of the energy-limited mass-loss rates. This\nconstitutes a contradiction, since the hydrogen envelopes cannot be retained\ngiven the high mass-loss rates. We hypothesize that these planets are not truly\nunder such high mass-loss rates. Instead, either hydrodynamic models\noverestimate the mass-loss rates, transit-timing-variation measurements\nunderestimate the planetary masses, optical transit observations overestimate\nthe planetary radii (due to high-altitude clouds), or Neptunes have\nconsistently higher albedos than Jupiter planets. We conclude that at least one\nof these established estimations/techniques is consistently producing biased\nvalues for Neptune planets. Such an important fraction of exoplanets with\nmisinterpreted parameters can significantly bias our view of populations\nstudies, like the observed mass--radius distribution of exoplanets for example.\n", "  Self-assembly of colloidal particles is poised to become a powerful composite\nmaterial fabrication technique, but remains challenged by a limited control\nover the ensuing structures. We develop a new breed of nematic colloids that\nare physical analogs of a mathematical surface with boundary, interacting with\nthe molecular alignment field without inducing defects when flat. However, made\nfrom a thin nanofoil, they can be shaped to prompt formation of\nself-compensating defects that drive pre-programmed elastic interactions\nmediated by the nematic host. To show this, we wrap the nanofoil on all\ntriangular side faces of a pyramid, except its square base. The ensuing\npyramidal cones induce point defects with fractional hedgehog charges of\nopposite signs, spontaneously align with respect to the far-field director to\nform elastic dipoles and nested assemblies with tunable spacing. Nanofoils\nshaped into octahedrons interact as elastic quadrupoles. Our findings may drive\nrealization of low-symmetry colloidal phases.\n", "  We investigate left-right symmetric extensions of the standard model based on\nopen strings ending on D-branes, with gauge bosons due to strings attached to\nstacks of D-branes and chiral matter due to strings stretching between\nintersecting D-branes. The left-handed and right-handed fermions transform as\ndoublets under Sp(1)_L and Sp(1)_R, and so their masses must be generated by\nthe introduction of Higgs fields in a bi-fundamental (2,2) representation under\nthe two Sp(1) gauge groups. For such D-brane configurations the left-right\nsymmetry must be broken by Higgs fields in the doublet representation of\nSp(1)_R and therefore Majorana mass terms are suppressed by some higher physics\nscale. The left-handed and right-handed neutrinos pair up to form Dirac\nfermions which control the decay widths of the right-handed W' boson to yield\ncomparable branching fractions into dilepton and dijets channels. Using the\nmost recent searches at LHC13 Run II with 2016 data we constrain the (g_R,\nm_{W'}) parameter space. Our analysis indicates that independent of the\ncoupling strength g_R, gauge bosons with masses m_{W'} \\agt 3.5~{\\rm TeV} are\nnot ruled out. As the LHC is just beginning to probe the TeV-scale, significant\nroom for W' discovery remains.\n", "  We compute Luscher corrections for a giant magnon in the \\eta-deformed\n(AdS_5\\times S^5)_{\\eta} using the su(2|2)_q-invariant S-matrix at strong\ncoupling and compare with the finite-size effect of the corresponding string\nstate, derived previously. We find that these two results match and confirm\nthat the su(2|2)_q-invariant S-matrix is describing world-sheet excitations of\nthe \\eta-deformed background.\n", "  We perform electromagnetic wave simulations of fully three-dimensional\noptical Lima\\c{c}on-microcavities, one basis for their future applications in\nmicrolasers and photonic devices. The analysis of the three-dimensional modes\nand far-fields reveals an increase of the quality factors as compared to the\ntwo-dimensional case. The structure of the far-field in the third dimension\nshows pronounced maxima in the emission directionality inclined to the\nresonator plane which may be exploited for coupling the resonator modes to the\nenvironment. This triggers ideas for technical applications, like the suggested\nsensor that can detect small changes in the environment based on changes in the\nemission profile.\n", "  We analyse, within a dipole model, the final, inclusive HERA DIS cross\nsection data in the low $x$ region, using fully correlated errors. We show,\nthat these highest precision data are very well described within the dipole\nmodel framework starting from $Q^2$ values of 3.5 GeV$^2$ to the highest values\nof $Q^2 =$ 250 GeV$^2$.\n", "  The quark meson (linear sigma) model with linearized fluctuations displays at\na critical end point the onset of a curve of first-order phase transitions\n(FOPTs) located at non-zero chemical potentials and temperatures below a\ncertain cross-over temperature. The model qualifies well for an illustrative\nexample to study the impact of the emerging FOPT, e.g. on photon emissivities.\nSuch a case study unravels the tight interlocking of the phase structure with\nthe emission rates, here calculated according to lowest-order tree level\nprocesses by kinetic theory expressions. It is the strong dependence of the\nrates on the effective masses of the involved degrees of freedom which\ndistinctively vary over the phase diagram thus shaping the emissivity\naccordingly. At the same time, thermodynamic properties of the medium are\nlinked decisively to these effective masses, i.e. a consistent evaluation of\nthermodynamics, governing for instance adiabatic expansion paths, and emission\nrates is maintained within such an approach.\n", "  Different kinematical regimes of semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering\n(SIDIS) processes correspond to different underlying partonic pictures, and it\nis important to understand the transition between them. This is particularly\nthe case when there is sensitivity to intrinsic transverse momentum, in which\ncase kinematical details can become especially important. We address the\nquestion of how to identify the current fragmentation region --- the\nkinematical regime where a factorization picture with fragmentation functions\nis appropriate. We distinguish this from soft and target fragmentation regimes.\nOur criteria are based on the kinematic regions used in derivations of\nfactorization theorems. We argue that, when hard scales are of order a few\nGeVs, there is likely significant overlap between different rapidity regions\nthat are normally understood to be distinct. We thus comment on the need to\ntake this into account with more unified descriptions of SIDIS, which should\nspan all rapidities for the produced hadron. Finally, we propose general\ncriteria for estimating the proximity to the current region at large Q.\n", "  We propose a novel scheme for laser phase noise measurements with minimized\nsensitivity to external fluctuations including interferometer vibration,\ntemperature instability, other low-frequency noise, and relative intensity\nnoise. In order to minimize the effect of these external fluctuations, we\nemploy simultaneous measurement of two spectrally separated channels in the\nscheme. We present an algorithm for selection of the desired signal to extract\nthe phase noise. Experimental results demonstrate potential of the suggested\nscheme for a wide range of technological applications.\n", "  We explore the joint activated dynamics exhibited by two quantum degrees of\nfreedom: a cavity mode oscillator which is strongly coupled to a\nsuperconducting qubit in the strongly coherently driven dispersive regime.\nDynamical simulations and complementary measurements show a range of parameters\nwhere both the cavity and the qubit exhibit sudden simultaneous switching\nbetween two metastable states. This manifests in ensemble averaged amplitudes\nof both the cavity and qubit exhibiting a partial coherent cancellation.\nTransmission measurements of driven microwave cavities coupled to transmon\nqubits show detailed features which agree with the theory in the regime of\nsimultaneous switching.\n", "  The In-doped topological crystalline insulator Sn$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te is a\npromising candidate for a topological superconductor, where it is theoretically\nsuggested that In creates an impurity state responsible for superconductivity.\nWe synthesized high purity Sn$_{1-x}$In$_x$Te samples and performed\n$^{125}$Te-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The NMR spectra under\na magnetic field of $H_0$ = 5 T show a broadening characteristic due to a\nlocalized impurity state. The spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) divided by\ntemperature shows a Curie-Weiss like temperature-dependence under $H_0$ = 0.1 T\nbut is temperature-independent under $H_0$ = 5 T. These results indicate the\nexistence of quasi-localized impurity states due to In doping.\n", "  GJ 1214b is the most studied sub-Neptune exoplanet to date. Recent\nmeasurements have shown its near-infrared transmission spectrum to be flat,\npointing to a high-altitude opacity source in the exoplanet's atmosphere,\neither equilibrium condensate clouds or photochemical hazes. Many photometric\nobservations have been reported in the optical by different groups, though\nsimultaneous measurements spanning the entire optical regime are lacking. We\npresent an optical transmission spectrum ($4,500-9,260$\\AA) of GJ 1214b in 14\nbins measured with Magellan/IMACS repeatedly over three transits. We measure a\nmean planet-to-star radius ratio of ${R_{p}/R_{s} = 0.1146\\pm{2\\times10^{-4}}}$\nand mean uncertainty of $\\sigma(R_{p}/R_{s})=8.7\\times10^{-4}$ in the spectral\nbins. The optical transit depths are shallower on average than observed in the\nnear-infrared. We present a model for jointly incorporating the effects of a\ncomposite photosphere and atmospheric transmission (CPAT) through the\nexoplanet's limb, and use it to examine the cases of absorber and temperature\nheterogeneities in the stellar photosphere. We find the optical and\nnear-infrared measurements are best explained by the combination of (1)\nphotochemical haze in the exoplanetary atmosphere with a mode particle size\n$r=0.1~\\mu$m and haze-forming efficiency $f_{haze}=10 \\%$ and (2) faculae in\nthe unocculted stellar disk with a temperature contrast $\\Delta\nT=354^{+46}_{-46}$ K, assuming 3.2% surface coverage. The CPAT model can be\nused to assess potential contributions of heterogeneous stellar photospheres to\nobservations of exoplanet transmission spectra, which will be important for\nsearches for spectral features in the optical.\n", "  Local extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are of particular astrophysical\ninterest since they allow us to look into physical processes characteristic of\nthe early Universe, from the assembly of galaxy disks to the formation of stars\nin conditions of low metallicity. Given the luminosity-metallicity\nrelationship, all galaxies fainter than Mr < -13 are expected to be XMPs.\nTherefore, XMPs should be common in galaxy surveys. However, they are not,\nbecause several observational biases hamper their detection. This work compares\nthe number of faint XMPs in the SDSS-DR7 spectroscopic survey with the expected\nnumber, given the known biases and the observed galaxy luminosity function. The\nfaint end of the luminosity function is poorly constrained observationally, but\nit determines the expected number of XMPs. Surprisingly, the number of observed\nfaint XMPs (around 10) is over-predicted by our calculation, unless the upturn\nin the faint end of the luminosity function is not present in the model. The\nlack of an upturn can be naturally understood if most XMPs are central galaxies\nin their low-mass dark matter halos, which are highly depleted in baryons due\nto interaction with the cosmic ultraviolet background and to other physical\nprocesses. Our result also suggests that the upturn towards low luminosity of\nthe observed galaxy luminosity function is due to satellite galaxies.\n", "  Segmented magnetic nanowires are a promising route for the development of\nthree dimensional data storage techniques. Such devices require a control of\nthe coercive field and the coupling mechanisms between individual magnetic\nelements. In our study, we investigate electrodeposited nanomagnets within host\ntemplates using vibrating sample magnetometry and observe a strong dependence\nbetween nanowire length and coercive field (25 nm to 5 $\\mu$m) and diameter (25\nnm to 45 nm). A transition from a magnetization reversal through coherent\nrotation to domain wall propagation is observed at an aspect ratio of\napproximately 2. Our results are further reinforced via micromagnetic\nsimulations and angle dependent hysteresis loops. The found behavior is\nexploited to create nanowires consisting of a fixed and a free segment in a\nspin-valve like structure. The wires are released from the membrane and\nelectrically contacted, displaying a giant magnetoresistance effect that is\nattributed to individual switching of the coupled nanomagnets. We develop a\nsimple analytical model to describe the observed switching phenomena and to\npredict stable and unstable regimes in coupled nanomagnets of certain\ngeometries.\n", "  Future space-based telescopes, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey\nTelescope (WFIRST), will observe the reflected-light spectra of directly imaged\nextrasolar planets. Interpretation of such data presents a number of novel\nchallenges, including accounting for unknown planet radius and uncertain\nstellar illumination phase angle. Here we report on our continued development\nof Markov Chain Monte Carlo retrieval methods for addressing these issues in\nthe interpretation of such data. Specifically we explore how the unknown planet\nradius and potentially poorly known observer-planet-star phase angle impacts\nretrievals of parameters of interest such as atmospheric methane abundance,\ncloud properties and surface gravity. As expected, the uncertainty in retrieved\nvalues is a strong function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the observed\nspectra, particularly for low metallicity atmospheres, which lack deep\nabsorption signatures. Meaningful results may only be possible above certain\nSNR thresholds; for cases across a metallicity range of 1-50 times solar, we\nfind that only an SNR of 20 systematically reproduces close to the correct\nmethane abundance at all phase angles. However, even in cases where the phase\nangle is poorly known we find that the planet radius can be constrained to\nwithin a factor of two. We find that uncertainty in planet radius decreases at\nphase angles past quadrature, as the highly forward scattering nature of the\natmosphere at these geometries limits the possible volume of phase space that\nrelevant parameters can occupy. Finally, we present an estimation of possible\nimprovement that can result from combining retrievals against observations at\nmultiple phase angles.\n", "  Glasses exhibit a liquid-like structure but a solid-like rheological response\nwith plastic deformations only occurring beyond yielding. Thus, predicting the\nrheological behavior from the microscopic structure is difficult, but important\nfor materials science. Here, we consider colloidal suspensions and propose to\nsupplement the static structural information with the local dynamics, namely\nthe rearrangement and breaking of the cage of neighbors. This is quantified by\nthe mean squared nonaffine displacement and the number of particles that remain\nnearest neighbors for a long time, i.e. long-lived neighbors, respectively.\nBoth quantities are followed under shear using confocal microscopy and are the\nbasis to calculate the affine and nonaffine contributions to the elastic\nstress, which is complemented by the viscous stress to give the total stress.\nDuring start-up of shear, the model predicts three transient regimes that\nresult from the interplay of affine, nonaffine and viscous contributions. Our\nprediction quantitatively agrees with rheological data and their dependencies\non volume fraction and shear rate.\n", "  As a cold dark matter candidate, the QCD axion may form Bose-Einstein\ncondensates, called axion stars, with masses around $10^{-11}\\,M_{\\odot}$. In\nthis paper, we point out that a brand new astrophysical object, a Hydrogen\nAxion Star (HAS), may well be formed by ordinary baryonic matter becoming\ngravitationally bound to an axion star. We study the properties of the HAS and\nfind that the hydrogen cloud has a high pressure and temperature in the center\nand is likely in the liquid metallic hydrogen state. Because of the high\nparticle number densities for both the axion star and the hydrogen cloud, the\nfeeble interaction between axion and hydrogen can still generate enough\ninternal power, around $10^{13}~\\mbox{W}\\times(m_a/5~\\mbox{meV})^4$, to make\nthese objects luminous point sources. High resolution ultraviolet, optical and\ninfrared telescopes can discover HAS via black-body radiation.\n", "  Owing to their intrinsic (geometry dependent) radiation hardness, 3D pixel\nsensors are promising candidates for the innermost tracking layers of the\nforthcoming experiment upgrades at the Phase 2 High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). To\nthis purpose, extreme radiation hardness up to the expected maximum fluence of\n2e16 neq.cm-2 must come along with several technological improvements in a new\ngeneration of 3D pixels, i.e., increased pixel granularity (50x50 or 25x100 um2\ncell size), thinner active region (~100 um), narrower columnar electrodes (~5\num diameter) with reduced inter-electrode spacing (~30 um), and very slim edges\n(~100 um). The fabrication of the first batch of these new 3D sensors was\nrecently completed at FBK on Si-Si direct wafer bonded 6-inch substrates.\nInitial electrical test results, performed at wafer level on sensors and test\nstructures, highlighted very promising performance, in good agreement with TCAD\nsimulations: low leakage current (<1 pA/column), intrinsic breakdown voltage of\nmore than 150 V, capacitance of about 50 fF/column, thus assessing the validity\nof the design approach. A large variety of pixel sensors compatible with both\nexisting (e.g., ATLAS FEI4 and CMS PSI46) and future (e.g., RD53) read-out\nchips were fabricated, that were also electrically tested on wafer using a\ntemporary metal layer patterned as strips shorting rows of pixels together.\nThis allowed a statistically significant distribution of the relevant\nelectrical quantities to be obtained, thus gaining insight into the impact of\nprocess-induced defects. A few 3D strip test structures were irradiated with\nX-rays, showing inter-strip resistance of at least several GOhm even after 50\nMrad(Si) dose, thus proving the p-spray robustness. We present the most\nimportant design and technological aspects, and results obtained from the\ninitial investigations.\n", "  We study the sum rules of double Gamow-Teller (DGT) excitations through\ndouble spin-isospin operator $(\\sigma t_-)^2$. In general, $2^+$ states in the\ngranddaughter nuclei have dominant transition strength in DGT excitations and\n$0^+$ states are weak, except in $T=1$ mother nuclei in which $0^+$ strength is\ncompetitive with 2$^+$ strength. The isospin selection of DGT is also discussed\namong 5 possible isospin states in granddaughter nuclei. A possibility to\nextract the unit cross section for the DGT transition strength is pointed out\nin the $(\\sigma t_-)^2$ excitation of double isobaric analog state (DIAS) in\n$T=1$ nuclei.\n", "  We present $1''.4$ (98 pc) resolution ALMA observations of\n$^{13}$CO($J$=1-0), C$^{18}$O($J$=1-0), CS($J$=2-1) and\nCH$_3$OH($J_K$=$2_K$-$1_K$) molecular lines in the central $1'$ (4.2 kpc)\nregion of NGC 1068 to study the physical and chemical properties of giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) and to test whether these GMC-scale properties are\nlinked to the larger-scale galactic environment. Using the derived $^{13}$CO\ncube, we have identified 187 high-significance ($> 8\\sigma$) GMCs by employing\nthe CLUMPFIND algorithm. The molecular gas masses of GMCs $M_{\\rm ^{13}CO}$,\nderived from the $^{13}$CO data, range from $1.8 \\times 10^4 ~ M_\\odot$ to $4.2\n\\times 10^7 ~M_\\odot$.\n  A mass function of GMCs in NGC 1068 has been obtained for the first time at\n$\\sim$100 pc resolution. We find the slope of the mass function $\\gamma = -1.25\n\\pm 0.07$ for a mass range of $M_{\\rm ^{13}CO} \\geq 10^5M_\\odot$. This is\nshallower than the GMCs in the disk regions of the Milky Way, M51 and NGC 300.\nFurther, we find that the high mass cut-off of the GMC mass function occurs at\n$M_{\\rm ^{13}CO} \\sim 6 \\times 10^7 M_\\odot$, which is an order of magnitude\nlarger than that in the nuclear bar region of M51, indicating that the more\nmassive clouds dominate the mass budget in NGC 1068. The observed\nC$^{18}$O)/$^{13}$CO intensity ratios are found to be fairly uniform (0.27\n$\\pm$ 0.05) among the identified GMCs. In contrast, the CH$_3$OH/$^{13}$CO\nratios exhibit striking spatial variation across the disk, with the smallest\nvalues around the bar-end ($<$ 0.03), and larger ratios along the spiral arms\n($\\sim$ 0.1-0.2). We find that GMCs with detectable methanol emission tend to\nhave systematically larger velocity widths than those without methanol\nemission, suggesting that (relatively weak) shocks are responsible for the\nenhancement of the CH$_3$OH/$^{13}$CO ratios of GMCs in the disk of NGC 1068.\n", "  Gravitational wave astronomy has become a reality after the historical\ndetections accomplished during the first observing run of the two advanced LIGO\ndetectors. In the following years, the number of detections is expected to\nincrease significantly with the full commissioning of the advanced LIGO,\nadvanced Virgo and KAGRA detectors. The development of sophisticated data\nanalysis techniques to improve the opportunities of detection for low\nsignal-to-noise-ratio events is hence a most crucial effort. We present in this\npaper one such technique, dictionary-learning algorithms, which have been\nextensively developed in the last few years and successfully applied mostly in\nthe context of image processing. However, to the best of our knowledge, such\nalgorithms have not yet been employed to denoise gravitational wave signals. By\nbuilding dictionaries from numerical relativity templates of both, binary black\nholes mergers and bursts of rotational core collapse, we show how\nmachine-learning algorithms based on dictionaries can be also successfully\napplied for gravitational wave denoising. We use a subset of signals from both\ncatalogs, embedded in non-white Gaussian noise, to assess our techniques with a\nlarge sample of tests and to find the best model parameters. The application of\nour method to the actual signal GW150914 shows promising results.\nDictionary-learning algorithms could be a complementary addition to the\ngravitational wave data analysis toolkit. They may be used to extract signals\nfrom noise and to infer physical parameters if the data are in good enough\nagreement with the morphology of the dictionary atoms.\n", "  We develop scattering theory in a non-commutative space defined by a $su(2)$\ncoordinate algebra. By introducing a positive operator valued measure as a\nreplacement for strong position measurements, we are able to derive explicit\nexpressions for the probability current, differential and total cross-sections.\nWe show that at low incident energies the kinematics of these expressions is\nidentical to that of commutative scattering theory. The consequences of spacial\nnon-commutativity are found to be more pronounced at the dynamical level where,\neven at low incident energies, the phase shifts of the partial waves can\ndeviate strongly from commutative results. This is demonstrated for scattering\nfrom a spherical well. The impact of non-commutativity on the well's spectrum\nand on the properties of its bound and scattering states are considered in\ndetail. It is found that for sufficiently large well-depths the potential\neffectively becomes repulsive and that the cross-section tends towards that of\nhard sphere scattering. This can occur even at low incident energies when the\nparticle's wave-length inside the well becomes comparable to the\nnon-commutative length-scale.\n", "  We study the evolution of close binary systems composed of a normal,\nintermediate mass star and a neutron star considering a chemical composition\ntypical of that present in globular clusters (Z = 0.001). We look for\nsimilarities and differences with respect to solar composition donor stars,\nwhich we have extensively studied in the past. As a definite example, we\nperform an application on one of the redbacks located in a globular cluster. We\nperformed a detailed grid of models in order to find systems that represent the\nso-called redback binary radio pulsar systems with donor star masses between\n0.6 and 2.0 solar masses and orbital periods in the range 0.2 - 0.9 days. We\nfind that the evolution of these binary systems is rather similar to those\ncorresponding to solar composition objects, allowing us to account for the\noccurrence of redbacks in globular clusters, as the main physical ingredient is\nthe irradiation feedback. Redback systems are in the quasi-RLOF state, that is,\nalmost filling their corresponding Roche lobe. During the irradiation cycle the\nsystem alternates between semi-detached and detached states. While detached the\nsystem appears as a binary millisecond pulsar, called a redback. Circumstellar\nmaterial, as seen in redbacks, is left behind after the previous semi-detached\nphase. The evolution of binary radio pulsar systems considering irradiation\nsuccessfully accounts for, and provides a way for, the occurrence of redback\npulsars in low-metallicity environments such as globular clusters. This is the\ncase despite possible effects of the low metal content of the donor star that\ncould drive systems away from redback configuration.\n", "  Evolution of the 7Li abundance in the convection zone of the Sun during\ndifferent stages of its life time is considered to explain its low photospheric\nvalue in comparison with that of the solar system meteorites. Lithium is\nintensively and transiently burned in the early stages of evolution (pre-main\nsequence, pMS) when the radiative core arises, and then the Li abundance only\nslowly decreases during the main sequence (MS). We study the rates of lithium\nburning during these two stages. In a model of the Sun, computed ignoring pMS\nand without extra-convective mixing (overshooting) at the base of the\nconvection zone, the lithium abundance does not decrease significantly during\nthe MS life time of 4.6 Gyr. Analysis of helioseismic inversions together with\npost-model computations of chemical composition indicates the presence of the\novershooting region and restricts its thickness. It is estimated to be\napproximately half of the local pressure scale height 0.5Hp) which corresponds\nto 3.8 % of the solar radius. Introducing this extra region does not noticeably\ndeplete lithium during the MS stage. In contrast, at the pMS stage, an\novershooting region with a value of approximately 0.18Hp is enough to produce\nthe observed lithium depletion. If we conclude that the dominant lithium\nburning takes place during the pMS stage, the dispersion of the lithium\nabundance in solar twins is explained by different physical conditions,\nprimarily during the early stage of evolution before the MS.\n", "  The covariant understanding of dispersion relations as level sets of Hamilton\nfunctions on phase space enables us to derive the most general dispersion\nrelation compatible with homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes. We use this\nconcept to present a Planck-scale deformation of the Hamiltonian of a particle\nin Friedman-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry that is locally\nidentical to the $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e dispersion relation, in the same way as\nthe dispersion relation of point particles in general relativity is locally\nidentical to the one valid in special relativity. Studying the motion of\nparticles subject to such Hamiltonian we derive the redshift and lateshift as\nobservable consequences of the Planck-scale deformed FLRW universe.\n", "  In order to investigate the long-term dimensional stability of matter, we\nhave operated an optical resonator fabricated from crystalline silicon at\n1.5$\\,$K continuously for over one year and repeatedly compared its resonance\nfrequency $f_{res}$ with the frequency of a GPS-monitored hydrogen maser. After\nallowing for an initial settling time, over a 163-day interval we found a mean\nfractional drift magnitude $|f_{res}^{-1}df_{res}/dt|<1.4\\times10^{-20}$/s. The\nresonator frequency is determined by the physical length and the speed of\nlight, and we measure it with respect to the atomic unit of time. Thus, the\nbound rules out, to first order, a hypothetical differential effect of the\nuniverse's expansion on rulers and atomic clocks. We also constrain a\nhypothetical violation of the principle of Local Position Invariance for\nresonator-based clocks and derive bounds for the strength of space-time\nfluctuations.\n", "  S2 has been observed for decades in comets, including comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Despite the fact that this molecule appears\nubiquitous in these bodies, the nature of its source remains unknown. In this\nstudy, we assume that S2 is formed by irradiation (photolysis and/or\nradiolysis) of S-bearing molecules embedded in the icy grain precursors of\ncomets, and that the cosmic ray flux simultaneously creates voids in ices\nwithin which the produced molecules can accumulate. We investigate the\nstability of S2 molecules in such cavities, assuming that the surrounding ice\nis made of H2S or H2O. We show that the stabilization energy of S2 molecules in\nsuch voids is close to that of the H2O ice binding energy, implying that they\ncan only leave the icy matrix when this latter sublimates. Because S2 has a\nshort lifetime in the vapor phase, we derive that its formation in grains via\nirradiation must occur only in low density environments such as the ISM or the\nupper layers of the protosolar nebula, where the local temperature is extremely\nlow. In the first case, comets would have agglomerated from icy grains that\nremained pristine when entering the nebula. In the second case, comets would\nhave agglomerated from icy grains condensed in the protosolar nebula and that\nwould have been efficiently irradiated during their turbulent transport towards\nthe upper layers of the disk. Both scenarios are found consistent with the\npresence of molecular oxygen in comets.\n", "  We emphasize the fact the evolution of quantum states in the inverted\noscillator (IO) is reduced to classical equations of motion, stressing that the\ncorresponding tunnelling and reflexion coefficients addressed in the literature\nare calculated by considering only classically trajectories. The Wigner\nfunction formalism is employed to describe the IO classical dynamics,\nsubsequently leading to the introduction of the Ambiguity function lying in the\nso-called Reciprocal phase space. Our findings, show that the Ambiguity\nfunction behavior, subjected to the IO, allude a classical propagation with an\nassociated integral of motion, and complex conjugated doubly degenerate energy\nstates.\n", "  It is shown that a slip wave solution exists for anti-plane sliding of an\nelastic layer on an elastic half-space. It is a companion solution to the\nwell-known Love wave solution.\n", "  The availability of the unprecedented spectral resolution provided by modern\nX-ray observatories is opening up new areas for study involving the coupled\nformation of the continuum emission and the cyclotron absorption features in\naccretion-powered X-ray pulsar spectra. Previous research focusing on the\ndynamics and the associated formation of the observed spectra has largely been\nconfined to the single-fluid model, in which the super-Eddington luminosity\ninside the column decelerates the flow to rest at the stellar surface, while\nthe dynamical effect of gas pressure is ignored. In a companion paper, we have\npresented a detailed analysis of the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic structure\nof the accretion column obtained using a new self-consistent model that\nincludes the effects of both gas and radiation pressure. In this paper, we\nexplore the formation of the associated X-ray spectra using a rigorous photon\ntransport equation that is consistent with the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic\nstructure of the column. We use the new model to obtain phase-averaged spectra\nand partially-occulted spectra for Her X-1, Cen X-3, and LMC X-4. We also use\nthe new model to constrain the emission geometry, and compare the resulting\nparameters with those obtained using previously published models. Our model\nsheds new light on the structure of the column, the relationship between the\nionized gas and the photons, the competition between diffusive and advective\ntransport, and the magnitude of the energy-averaged cyclotron scattering cross\nsection.\n", "  Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) is prevalent in star-forming galaxies. Using a\nsample of 365 nearly face-on star-forming galaxies observed by MaNGA, we\ndemonstrate how DIG in star-forming galaxies impacts the measurements of\nemission line ratios, hence the interpretation of diagnostic diagrams and\ngas-phase metallicity measurements. At fixed metallicity, DIG-dominated low\nH\\alpha\\ surface brightness regions display enhanced [SII]/H\\alpha,\n[NII]/H\\alpha, [OII]/H\\beta, and [OI]/H\\alpha. The gradients in these line\nratios are determined by metallicity gradients and H\\alpha\\ surface brightness.\nIn line ratio diagnostic diagrams, contamination by DIG moves HII regions\ntowards composite or LI(N)ER-like regions. A harder ionizing spectrum is needed\nto explain DIG line ratios. Leaky HII region models can only shift line ratios\nslightly relative to HII region models, and thus fail to explain the\ncomposite/LI(N)ER line ratios displayed by DIG. Our result favors ionization by\nevolved stars as a major ionization source for DIG with LI(N)ER-like emission.\n  DIG can significantly bias the measurement of gas metallicity and metallicity\ngradients derived using strong-line methods. Metallicities derived using N2O2\nare optimal because they exhibit the smallest bias and error. Using O3N2, R23,\nN2=[NII]/H\\alpha, and N2S2H\\alpha\\ (Dopita et al. 2016) to derive metallicities\nintroduces bias in the derived metallicity gradients as large as the gradient\nitself. The strong-line method of Blanc et al. (2015; IZI hereafter) cannot be\napplied to DIG to get an accurate metallicity because it currently contains\nonly HII region models which fail to describe the DIG.\n", "  SN2005ip was a TypeIIn event notable for its sustained strong interaction\nwith circumstellar material (CSM), coronal emission lines, and IR excess,\ninterpreted as shock interaction with the very dense and clumpy wind of an\nextreme red supergiant. We present a series of late-time spectra of SN2005ip\nand a first radio detection of this SN, plus late-time X-rays, all of which\nindicate that its CSM interaction is still strong a decade post-explosion. We\nalso present and discuss new spectra of geriatric SNe with continued CSM\ninteraction: SN1988Z, SN1993J, and SN1998S. From 3-10 yr post-explosion,\nSN2005ip's H-alpha luminosity and other observed characteristics were nearly\nidentical to those of the radio-luminous SN1988Z, and much more luminous than\nSNe1993J and 1998S. At 10 yr after explosion, SN2005ip showed a drop in\nH$\\alpha$ luminosity, followed by a quick resurgence over several months. We\ninterpret this variability as ejecta crashing into a dense shell located at\naround 0.05 pc from the star, which may be the same shell that caused the IR\necho at earlier epochs. The extreme H-alpha luminosities in SN2005ip and\nSN1988Z are still dominated by the forward shock at 10 yr post-explosion,\nwhereas SN1993J and SN1998S are dominated by the reverse shock at a similar\nage. Continuous strong CSM interaction in SNe~2005ip and 1988Z is indicative of\nenhanced mass loss for about 1e3 yr before core collapse, longer than Ne, O, or\nSi burning phases. Instead, the episodic mass loss must extend back through C\nburning and perhaps even part of He burning.\n", "  We present the discovery of the hot subdwarf B star (sdB) binary PTF1\nJ082340.04+081936.5. The system has an orbital period P$_{\\rm orb}=87.49668(1)$\nmin (0.060761584(10) days), making it the second-most compact sdB binary known.\nThe lightcurve shows ellipsoidal variations. Under the assumption that the sdB\nprimary is synchronized with the orbit, we find a mass $M_{\\rm\nsdB}=0.45^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ M$_\\odot$, a companion white dwarf mass $M_{\\rm\nWD}=0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$ M$_\\odot$ and a mass ratio $q = \\frac{M_{\\rm\nWD}}{M_{\\rm sdB}}=1.03^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$.\n  The future evolution was calculated using the MESA stellar evolution code.\nAdopting a canonical sdB mass of $M_{\\rm sdB}=0.47$ M$_\\odot$, we find that the\nsdB still burns helium at the time it will fill its Roche lobe if the orbital\nperiod was less than 106 min at the exit from the last common envelope phase.\nFor longer common envelope exit periods the sdB will have stopped burning\nhelium and turned into a C/O white dwarf at the time of contact. Comparing the\nspectroscopically derived log(g) and $T_{\\rm eff}$ with our MESA models, we\nfind that an sdB model with a hydrogen envelope mass of $5\\times10^{-4}\nM_\\odot$ matches the measurements at a post-common envelope age of 94 Myr,\ncorresponding to a post-common envelope orbital period of 109 min which is\nclose to the limit to start accretion while the sdB is still burning helium.\n", "  We develop computational tools for calculating supersymmetric higher-order\nderivative corrections to eleven-dimensional supergravity using the action\nprinciple approach. We show that, provided the superspace Bianchi identities\nadmit a perturbative solution in the derivative expansion, there are at least\ntwo independent superinvariants at the eight-derivative order of\neleven-dimensional supergravity. Assuming the twelve-superforms associated to\ncertain anomalous Chern-Simons terms are Weil-trivial, there will be a third\nindependent superinvariant at this order. Under certain conditions, at least\ntwo superinvariants will survive to all orders in the derivative expansion.\nHowever only one of them will be present in the quantum theory: the\nsupersymmetrization of the Chern-Simons terms of eleven dimensional\nsupergravity required for the cancellation of the M5-brane gravitational\nanomaly by inflow. This superinvariant can be shown to be unique at the\neight-derivative order, assuming it is quartic in the fields. On the other\nhand, a necessary condition for the superinvariant to be quartic is the\nexactness, in tau-cohomology, of X0,8 -the purely spinorial component of the\neight-superform related by descent to the M5-brane anomaly polynomial. In that\ncase it can also be shown that the solution of the Weil-triviality condition of\nthe corresponding twelve-form, which is a prerequisite for the explicit\nconstruction of the superinvariant, is guaranteed to exist. We prove that\ncertain highly non-trivial necessary conditions for the tau-exactness of X0,8\nare satisfied. Moreover any potential superinvariant associated to anomalous\nChern-Simons terms at the eight-derivative order must necessarily contain terms\ncubic or lower in the fields.\n", "  We explore wormhole solutions in a non-minimal torsion-matter coupled gravity\nby taking an explicit non-minimal coupling between the matter Lagrangian\ndensity and an arbitrary function of torsion scalar. This coupling depicts the\ntransfer of energy and momentum between matter and torsion scalar terms. The\nviolation of null energy condition occurred through effective energy-momentum\ntensor incorporating the torsion-matter non-minimal coupling while normal\nmatter is responsible for supporting the respective wormhole geometries. We\nconsider energy density in the form of non-monotonically decreasing function\nalong with two types of models. First model is analogous to curvature-matter\ncoupling scenario, that is, torsion scalar with $T$-matter coupling while the\nsecond one involves a quadratic torsion term. In both cases, we obtain wormhole\nsolutions satisfying null energy condition. Also, we find that the increasing\nvalue of coupling constant minimizes or vanishes the violation of null energy\ncondition through matter.\n", "  Detector efficiency determination is essential to correct the measured yields\nand extract reliable cross sections of particles emitted in nuclear reactions.\nWe investigate the efficiencies for measuring the full energies of light\ncharged particle in arrays of CsI crystals employed in particle detection\narrays such as HiRA, LASSA and MUST2. We perform these simulations with a\nGEANT4 Monte Carlo transport code implemented in the NPTool framework. Both\nCoulomb multiple scattering and nuclear reactions within the crystal can\nsignificantly reduce the efficiency of detecting the full energy of high energy\nparticles. The calculated efficiencies decrease exponentially as a function of\nthe range of the particle and are quite similar for both the hydrogen ($p, d,\nt$) and helium ($^3$He, $\\alpha$) isotopes. The use of a close-packed array\nintroduces significant position dependent efficiency losses at the interior\nboundaries between crystals that need to be considered in the design of an\narray and in the efficiency corrections of measured energy spectra.\n", "  Background: Fission barriers of actinide nuclei have been mostly and for long\nbeen microscopi- cally calculated for even-even fissioning systems.\nCalculations in the case of odd nuclei have been performed merely within a\nso-called equal-filling approximation (EFA) as opposed to an approach taking\nexplicitly into account the time reversal breaking properties at the mean field\nlevel- and for only one single-particle configuration.\n  Purpose: We study the dependence of the fission barriers on various relevant\nconfigurations (e.g. to evaluate the so-called specialization energy). Besides,\nwe want to assess the relevance as a func- tion of the deformation of the EFA\napproach which has been already found out at ground state deformation.\n  Methods: Calculations within the Hartree-Fock plus BCS with self-consistent\nparticle blocking have been performed using the SkM* Skyrme effective\ninteraction in the particle-hole channel and a seniority force in the\nparticle-particle channel. Axial symmetry has been imposed throughout the whole\nfission path while the intrinsic parity symmetry has been allowed to be broken\nin the outer fission barrier region.\n  Results: Potential energy curves have been determined for six different\nconfigurations in U-235 and four in Pu-239. Inner and outer fission barriers\nhave been calculated along with some spectroscopic properties in the fission\nisomeric well. These results have been compared with available data. The\ninfluence of time-reversal breaking mean fields on the solutions has been\ninvestigated.\n  Conclusions: A sizeable configuration dependence of the fission barrier\n(width and height) has been demonstrated. A reasonable agreement with available\nsystematic evaluations of fission barrier heights has been found. The EFA\napproach has been validated at the large elongations occurring at the outer\nbarrier region.\n", "  Macrospicules (MS) are localised small-scale jet-like phenomena in the solar\natmosphere, which have the potential to transport considerable amount of\nmomentum and energy from the lower solar atmospheric regions to the Transition\nRegion and the low corona. A detailed statistical analysis of their temporal\nbehaviour and spatial properties is carried out in this work. By means of\nstate-of-the-art spatial and temporal resolution observations, yielded by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we\nconstructed a database covering a 5.5-year long period, containing 301\nmacrospicules that occurred between June 2010 and December 2015 detected at\n30.4 nm wavelength. Here, we report the long-term variation of the height,\nlength, average speed and width of MS in Coronal Holes and Quiet Sun areas both\nin the northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun. This new database helps to\nrefine our knowledge about the physical properties of MS. Cross-correlation of\nthese properties show a relatively strong correlation, but not always a\ndominant one. However, a more detailed analysis indicates a wave-like signature\nin the behaviour of MS properties in time. The period of these long-term\noscillatory behaviours are just under two years. Also, in terms of solar\nnorth/south hemispheres, a strong asymmetry was found in the spatial\ndistribution of MS properties, which may be accounted for the solar dynamo.\nThis latter feature may then indicate a strong and rather intrinsic link\nbetween global internal and local atmospheric phenomena in the Sun.\n", "  We have developed a software library for chemical evolution simulations of\ngalaxy formation under the simple stellar population (SSP) approximation. In\nthis library, all of the necessary components concerning chemical evolution,\nsuch as initial mass functions, stellar lifetimes, yields from type II and Ia\nsupernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and neutron star mergers, are\ncompiled from the literature. Various models are pre-implemented in this\nlibrary so that users can choose their favorite combination of models.\nSubroutines of this library return released energy and masses of individual\nelements depending on a given event type. Since the redistribution manner of\nthese quantities depends on the implementation of users' simulation codes, this\nlibrary leaves it up to the simulation code. As demonstrations, we carry out\nboth one-zone, closed box simulations and three-dimensional simulations of a\ncollapsing gas and dark matter system using this library. In these simulations,\nwe can easily compare the impact of individual models on the chemical evolution\nof galaxies, just by changing the control flags and parameters of the library.\nSince this library only deals with the part of chemical evolution under the SSP\napproximation, any simulation codes that use the SSP approximation -- namely\nparticle-base and mesh codes, as well as semi-analytical models -- can use it.\nThis library is named \"CELib\" after the term \"Chemical Evolution Library\" and\nis made available to the community.\n", "  We study a horizontal streaming excited by means of a low frequency and\nintensity acoustic wave in 2D freely suspended film of thermotropic smectic\nliquid crystal. Acoustic pressure induces fast periodic transverse oscillations\nof the film, which produce in-plane stationary couples of vortices slowly\nrotating in opposite directions owing to hydrodynamic nonlinearity. The\nparameters of vortices are measured using a new method, based on tracking\ndisk-shaped island defects. The horizontal motion occurs only when the\namplitude of acoustic pressure exceeds threshold value, which can be explained\nby Bingham-like behavior of the smectic film. The measurements above threshold\nare in a good agreement with existing theoretical predictions. We have\ndemonstrated experimentally that in-plane flow is well controlled by changing\nthe acoustic pressure, excitation frequency and geometry of the film. The\nobservations open a way to use the phenomenon in various applications.\n", "  Previous research centered on the hydrodynamics in X-ray pulsar accretion\ncolumns has largely focused on the single-fluid model, in which the\nsuper-Eddington luminosity inside the column decelerates the flow to rest at\nthe stellar surface. This type of model has been relatively successful in\ndescribing the overall properties of the accretion flows, but it does not\naccount for the possible dynamical effect of the gas pressure. On the other\nhand, the most successful radiative transport models for pulsars generally do\nnot include a rigorous treatment of the dynamical structure of the column,\ninstead assuming an ad hoc velocity profile. In this paper, we explore the\nstructure of X-ray pulsar accretion columns using a new, self-consistent,\n\"two-fluid\" model, which incorporates the dynamical effect of the gas and\nradiation pressure, the dipole variation of the magnetic field, the\nthermodynamic effect of all of the relevant coupling and cooling processes, and\na rigorous set of physical boundary conditions. The model has six free\nparameters, which we vary in order to approximately fit the phase-averaged\nspectra in Her X-1, Cen X-3, and LMC X-4. In this paper, we focus on the\ndynamical results, which shed new light on the surface magnetic field strength,\nthe inclination of the magnetic field axis relative to the rotation axis, the\nrelative importance of gas and radiation pressure, and the radial variation of\nthe ion, electron, and inverse-Compton temperatures. The results obtained for\nthe X-ray spectra are presented in a separate paper.\n", "  The process of atomic-to-molecular (HI-to-H$_2$) gas conversion is\nfundamental for molecular-cloud formation and star formation. 21 cm\nobservations of the star-forming region W43 revealed extremely high HI column\ndensities, of 120-180 M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, a factor of 10-20 larger than\npredicted by HI-to-H$_2$ transition theories. We analyze the observed HI with\nan HI-to-H$_2$ transition theoretical model, and show that the\ntheory-observation discrepancy cannot be explained by the intense radiation in\nW43, nor by variations of the assumed volume density or H$_2$ formation-rate\ncoefficient. We show that the large observed HI columns are naturally explained\nby several ($9-22$) HI-to-H$_2$ transition layers, superimposed along the\nsightlines of W43. We discuss other possible interpretations such as a\nnon-steady-state scenario, and inefficient dust absorption. The case of W43\nsuggests that HI thresholds reported in extra-galactic observations are\nprobably not associated with a single HI-to-H$_2$ transition, but are rather a\nresult of several transition layers (clouds) along the sightlines, beam-diluted\nwith diffuse inter-cloud gas.\n", "  We present results on a systematic study of flux variability on hourly\ntime-scales in a large sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the 3-79 keV\nband using data from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array. Our sample consists\nof 4 BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), 3 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) 24 Seyfert\n1, 42 Seyfert 2 and 8 narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies. We find that in\nthe 3-79 keV band, about 65% of the sources in our sample show significant\nvariations on hourly time scales. Using Mann-Whitney U-test and\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find no difference in the variability behaviour\nbetween Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies. The blazar sources (FSRQs and BL Lacs) in our\nsample, are more variable than Seyfert galaxies that include Seyfert 1 and\nSeyfert 2 in the soft (3-10 keV), hard (10-79 keV) and total (3-79 keV) bands.\nNLSy1 galaxies show the highest duty cycle of variability (87%), followed by BL\nLacs (82%), Seyfert galaxies (56%) and FSRQs (23%). We obtained flux\ndoubling/halving time in the hard X-ray band less than 10 min in 11 sources.\nThe flux variations between the hard and soft bands in all the sources in our\nsample are consistent with zero lag.\n", "  We present results from models of galactic winds driven by energy injected\nfrom nuclear (at the galactic center) and non-nuclear starbursts. The total\nenergy of the starburst is provided by very massive young stellar\nclusters,which can push the galactic interstellar medium and produce an\nimportant outflow. Such outflow can be a well, or partially mixed wind, or a\nhighly metallic wind. We have performed adiabatic 3D N-Body/Smooth Particle\nHydrodynamics simulations of galactic winds using the GADGET-2 code. The\nnumerical models cover a wide range of parameters, varying the galaxy\nconcentration index, gas fraction of the galactic disk, and radial distance of\nthe starburst. We show that an off-center starburst in dwarf galaxies is the\nmost effective mechanism to produce a significant loss of metals (material from\nthe starburst itself). At the same time a non-nuclear starburst produce a high\nefficiency of metal loss, in spite of having a moderate to low mass loss rate.\n", "  Flares close to the solar limb, where the footpoints are occulted, can reveal\nthe spectrum and structure of the coronal loop-top source in X-rays. We aim at\nstudying the properties of the corresponding energetic electrons near their\nacceleration site, without footpoint contamination. To this end, a statistical\nstudy of partially occulted flares observed with RHESSI is presented here,\ncovering a large part of solar cycles 23 and 24. We perform a detailed spectra,\nimaging and light curve analysis for 116 flares and include contextual\nobservations from SDO and STEREO when available, providing further insights\ninto flare emission that was previously not accessible. We find that most\nspectra are fitted well with a thermal component plus a broken power-law,\nnon-thermal component. A thin-target kappa distribution model gives\nsatisfactory fits after the addition of a thermal component. X-rays imaging\nreveals small spatial separation between the thermal and non-thermal\ncomponents, except for a few flares with a richer coronal source structure. A\ncomprehensive light curve analysis shows a very good correlation between the\nderivative of the soft X-ray flux (from GOES) and the hard X-rays for a\nsubstantial number of flares, indicative of the Neupert effect. The results\nconfirm that non-thermal particles are accelerated in the corona and estimated\ntimescales support the validity of a thin-target scenario with similar\nmagnitudes of thermal and non-thermal energy fluxes.\n", "  We performed near-diffraction-limited (~0.4 FWHM) N-band imaging of one of\nthe nearest Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in M51 with 8.2m Subaru telescope to\nstudy the nuclear structure and spectral energy distribution (SED) at 8-13 um.\nWe found that the nucleus is composed of an unresolved core (at ~13 pc\nresolution, or intrinsic size corrected for the instrumental effect of <6 pc)\nand an extended halo (at a few tens pc scale), and each of their SEDs is almost\nflat. We examined the SED by comparing with the archival Spitzer IRS spectrum\nprocessed to mimic our chopping observation of the nucleus, and the published\nradiative-transfer model SEDs of the AGN clumpy dusty torus. The halo SED is\nlikely due to circumnuclear star formation showing little Polycyclic Aromatic\nHydrocarbon (PAH) emission due to the AGN. The core SED is likely dominated by\nthe AGN because of the following two reasons. Firstly, the clumpy torus model\nSEDs can reproduce the red mid-infrared continuum with apparently moderate\nsilicate 9.7 um absorption. Secondly, the core 12 um luminosity and the\nabsorption-corrected X-ray luminosity at 2-10 keV in the literature follow the\nmid-infrared-X-ray luminosity correlation known for the nearby AGNs including\nthe Compton-thick ones.\n", "  Despite their close proximity, the complex interplay between the two\nMagellanic Clouds, the Milky Way, and the resulting tidal features, is still\npoorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) has a very extended disk strikingly perturbed in its outskirts. We search\nfor recent star formation in the far outskirts of the LMC, out to ~30 degrees\nfrom its center. We have collected intermediate-resolution spectra of\nthirty-one young star candidates in the periphery of the LMC and measured their\nradial velocity, stellar parameters, distance and age. Our measurements confirm\nmembership to the LMC of six targets, for which the radial velocity and\ndistance values match well those of the Cloud. These objects are all young\n(10-50 Myr), main-sequence stars projected between 7 and 13 degrees from the\ncenter of the parent galaxy. We compare the velocities of our stars with those\nof a disk model, and find that our stars have low to moderate velocity\ndifferences with the disk model predictions, indicating that they were formed\nin situ. Our study demonstrates that recent star formation occurred in the far\nperiphery of the LMC, where thus far only old objects were known. The spatial\nconfiguration of these newly-formed stars appears ring-like with a radius of 12\nkpc, and a displacement of 2.6 kpc from the LMC's center. This structure, if\nreal, would be suggestive of a star-formation episode triggered by an\noff-center collision between the Small Magellanic Cloud and the LMC's disk.\n", "  Jefferson Lab (JLab) is starting a wide experimental program aimed at\nstudying the neutron's structure, with a great emphasis on the extraction of\nthe parton transverse-momentum distributions (TMDs). To this end,\nSemi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SiDIS) experiments on polarized\n$^3$He will be carried out, providing, together with proton and deuteron data,\na sound flavor decomposition of the TMDs. Given the expected high statistical\naccuracy, it is crucial to disentangle nuclear and partonic degrees of freedom\nto get an accurate theoretical description of both initial and final states. In\nthis contribution, a preliminary study of the Final State Interaction (FSI) in\nthe standard SiDIS, where a pion (or a Kaon) is detected in the final state is\npresented, in view of constructing a realistic description of the nuclear\ninitial and final states.\n", "  Microphase separation in random multiblock copolymers is studied with\nmean-field theory assuming that long blocks of a copolymer are strongly\nsegregated, whereas short blocks are able to penetrate into \"alien\" domains and\nexchange between the domains and interfacial layer. A bidisperse copolymer with\nblocks of only two sizes (long and short) is considered as a model of\nmultiblock copolymers with high polydispersity in the block size. Short blocks\nof the copolymer play an important role in microphase separation. First, their\npenetration into the \"alien\" domains leads to the formation of joint long\nblocks in their own domains. Second, short blocks localized at the interface\nconsiderably change the interfacial tension. The possibility of penetration of\nshort blocks into the \"alien\" domains is controlled by the product chi*Nsh (chi\nis the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, Nsh is the short block length). At\nnot very large chi*Nsh, the domain size is larger than that for a regular\ncopolymer consisting of the same long blocks as in the considered random\ncopolymer. At a fixed mean block size, the domain size grows with an increase\nin the block size dispersity, the rate of the growth being dependent of the\nmore detailed parameters of the block size distribution.\n", "  We discuss the implementation of physically meaningful branching ratios\nbetween the CRD and PRD contributions to the emissivity of a polarized\nmulti-term atom in the presence of both inelastic and elastic collisions. Our\nderivation is based on a recent theoretical formulation of partially coherent\nscattering, and it relies on a heuristic diagrammatic analysis of the various\nradiative and collisional processes to determine the proper form of the\nbranching ratios. The expression we obtain for the emissivity is\n$\\varepsilon=\\left[\\varepsilon^{\\tiny (1)}-\\varepsilon^{\\tiny (2)}_{\\rm f.s.}\n\\right]+\\varepsilon^{\\tiny (2)}$, where $\\varepsilon^{\\tiny (1)}$ and\n$\\varepsilon^{\\tiny (2)}$ are the emissivity terms for the redistributed and\npartially coherent radiation, respectively, and where \"f.s.\" implies that the\ncorresponding term must be evaluated assuming a flat-spectrum average of the\nincident radiation.\n", "  Wide-field photometric surveys enable searches of rare yet interesting\nobjects, such as strongly lensed quasars or quasars with a bright host galaxy.\nPast searches for lensed quasars based on their optical and near infrared\nproperties have relied on photometric cuts and spectroscopic pre-selection (as\nin the Sloan Quasar Lens Search), or neural networks applied to photometric\nsamples. These methods rely on cuts in morphology and colours, with the risk of\nlosing many interesting objects due to scatter in their population properties,\nrestrictive training sets, systematic uncertainties in catalog-based\nmagnitudes, and survey-to-survey photometric variations. Here, we explore the\nperformance of a Gaussian Mixture Model to separate point-like quasars, quasars\nwith an extended host, and strongly lensed quasars using griz psf and model\nmagnitudes and WISE W1, W2. The choice of optical magnitudes is due to their\npresence in all current and upcoming releases of wide-field surveys, whereas UV\ninformation is not always available. We then assess the contamination from blue\ngalaxies and the role of additional features such as W3 magnitudes or psf-model\nterms as morphological information. As a demonstration, we conduct a search in\na random 10% of the SDSS footprint, and we provide the catalog of the 43 SDSS\nobject with the highest `lens' score in our selection that survive visual\ninspection, and are spectroscopically confirmed to host active nuclei. We\ninspect archival data and find images of 5/43 objects in the Hubble Legacy\nArchive, including 2 known lenses. The code and materials are available to\nfacilitate follow-up.\n", "  We present a model of inflation where the inflaton is accommodated as a\nphantom field which exhibits an initial transient pole behavior and then decays\ninto a quintessence field which is responsible for a radiation era. We must\nstress that the present unified model only deals with a single field and that\nthe transition between two eras is achieved in a smooth way, so the model does\nnot suffer from the eternal inflation issue. We explore the conditions for the\ncrossing of the phantom divide line within the inflationary era along with the\nstructural stability of several critical points. We study the behavior of the\nphantom field within the slow climb approximation along with the necessary\nconditions to have sufficient inflation. We also examine the model at the level\nof classical perturbations within the Newtonian gauge and determine the\nbehavior of the gravitational potential, contrast density and perturbed field\nnear the inflation stage and the subsequent radiation era.\n", "  We find transient, transit-like dimming events within the K2 time series\nphotometry of the young star RIK-210 in the Upper Scorpius OB association.\nThese dimming events are variable in depth, duration, and morphology. High\nspatial resolution imaging revealed the star is single, and radial velocity\nmonitoring indicated that the dimming events can not be due to an eclipsing\nstellar or brown dwarf companion. Archival and follow-up photometry suggest the\ndimming events are transient in nature. The variable morphology of the dimming\nevents suggests they are not due to a single, spherical body. The ingress of\neach dimming event is always shallower than egress, as one would expect for an\norbiting body with a leading tail. The dimming events are periodic and\nsynchronous with the stellar rotation. However, we argue it is unlikely the\ndimming events could be attributed to anything on the stellar surface based on\nthe observed depths and durations. Variable obscuration by a protoplanetary\ndisk is unlikely on the basis that the star is not actively accreting and lacks\nthe infrared excess associated with an inner disk. Rather, we explore the\npossibilities that the dimming events are due to magnetospheric clouds, a\ntransiting protoplanet surrounded by circumplanetary dust and debris, eccentric\norbiting bodies undergoing periodic tidal disruption, or an extended field of\ndust or debris near the corotation radius.\n", "  We combine the Herschel Space Observatory PACS and SPIRE photometry with\narchival WISE photometry to construct the spectral energy distributions (SED)\nfor over 300 local ($z < 0.05$), ultra-hard X-ray (14 - 195 keV) selected\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 58\nmonth catalogue. Using a simple analytical model that combines an exponentially\ncut-off powerlaw with a single temperature modified blackbody, we decompose the\nSEDs into a host-galaxy and AGN component. We calculate dust masses, dust\ntemperatures, and star-formation rates (SFR) for our entire sample and compare\nthem to a stellar mass-matched sample of local non-AGN galaxies. We find AGN\nhost galaxies have systematically higher dust masses, dust temperatures, and\nSFRs due to the higher prevalence of late-type galaxies to host an AGN, in\nagreement with previous studies of the Swift/BAT AGN. We provide a scaling to\nconvert X-ray luminosities into 8 - 1000 $\\mu$m AGN luminosities, as well as\ndetermine the best mid-to-far IR colors for identifying AGN dominated galaxies\nin the IR regime. We find that for nearly 30 per cent of our sample, the 70\n$\\mu$m emission contains a significant contribution from the AGN ($> 0.5$),\nespecially at higher luminosities ($L_{14-195\\,\\rm{keV}} > 10^{42.5}$ ergs\ns$^{-1}$). Finally, we measure the local SFR-AGN luminosity relationship,\nfinding a slope of 0.18, large scatter (0.37 dex), and no evidence for an\nupturn at high AGN luminosity. We conclude with a discussion on the\nimplications of our results within the context of galaxy evolution with and\nwithout AGN feedback.\n", "  Kink instabilities are likely to occur in the current-carrying magnetized\nplasma jets. Recent observations of the blazar radiation and polarization\nsignatures suggest that the blazar emission region may be considerably\nmagnetized. While the kink instability has been studied with first-principle\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the corresponding time-dependent\nradiation and polarization signatures have not been investigated. In this\npaper, we perform comprehensive polarization-dependent radiation modeling of\nthe kink instability in the blazar emission region based on relativistic MHD\n(RMHD) simulations. We find that the kink instability may give rise to strong\nflares with polarization angle (PA) swings or weak flares with polarization\nfluctuations, depending on the initial magnetic topology and magnetization.\nThese findings are consistent with observations. Compared with the shock model,\nthe kink model generates polarization signatures that are in better agreement\nwith the general polarization observations. Therefore, we suggest that kink\ninstabilities may widely exist in the jet environment, and provide an efficient\nway to convert the magnetic energy and produce multiwavelength flares and\npolarization variations.\n", "  Star-forming blue early-type galaxies at low redshift can give insight to the\nstellar mass growth of L$*$ elliptical galaxies in the local Universe. We wish\nto understand the reason for star formation in these otherwise passively\nevolving red and dead stellar systems. The fuel for star formation can be\nacquired through recent accretion events such as mergers or flyby. The\nsignatures of such events should be evident from a structural analysis of the\ngalaxy image. We carried out structural analysis on SDSS $r$-band imaging data\nof 55 star-forming blue elliptical galaxies, derived the structural parameters,\nanalysed the residuals from best-fit to surface brightness distribution, and\nconstructed the galaxy scaling relations. We found that star-forming blue\nearly-type galaxies are bulge-dominated systems with axial ratio $>$ 0.5 and\nsurface brightness profiles fitted by Sersic profiles with index ($n$) mostly\n$>$ 2. Twenty-three galaxies are found to have $n$ $<$ 2; these could be\nhosting a disc component. The residual images of the 32 galaxy surface\nbrightness profile fits show structural features indicative of recent\ninteractions. The star-forming blue elliptical galaxies follow the Kormendy\nrelation and show the characteristics of normal elliptical galaxies as far as\nstructural analysis is concerned. There is a general trend for high-luminosity\ngalaxies to display interaction signatures and high star formation rates. The\nstar-forming population of blue early-type galaxies at low redshifts could be\nnormal ellipticals that might have undergone a recent gas-rich minor merger\nevent. The star formation in these galaxies will shut down once the recently\nacquired fuel is consumed, following which the galaxy will evolve to a normal\nearly-type galaxy.\n", "  Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the most visible tracers of the merging\nand accretion history of galaxy halos. Metal-poor GCs, in particular, are\nthought to arrive in massive galaxies largely through dry, minor merging\nevents, but it is rare to see a direct connection between GCs and visible\nstellar streams. NGC 474 is a post-merger early-type galaxy with dramatic fine\nstructures made of concentric shells and radial streams that have been more\nclearly revealed by deep imaging. We present a study of GCs in NGC 474 to\nbetter establish the relationship between merger-induced fine structure and the\nGC system. We find that many GCs are superimposed on visible streams and\nshells, and about 35% of GCs outside $3R_{\\rm e,galaxy}$ are located in regions\nof fine structure. The spatial correlation between the GCs and fine structure\nis significant at the 99.9% level, showing that this correlation is not\ncoincidental. The colors of the GCs on the fine structures are mostly blue, and\nwe also find an intermediate-color population that is dominant in the central\nregion, and which will likely passively evolve to have colors consistent with a\ntraditional metal-rich GC population. The association of the blue GCs with fine\nstructures is direct confirmation that many metal-poor GCs are accreted onto\nmassive galaxy halos through merging events, and that progenitors of these\nmergers are sub-L* galaxies.\n", "  Selective optical excitation of a substrate lattice can drive phase changes\nacross hetero-interfaces. This phenomenon is a non-equilibrium analogue of\nstatic strain control in heterostructures and may lead to new applications in\noptically controlled phase change devices. Here, we make use of time-resolved\nnon-resonant and resonant x-ray diffraction to clarify the underlying physics,\nand to separate different microscopic degrees of freedom in space and time. We\nmeasure the dynamics of the lattice and that of the charge disproportionation\nin NdNiO3, when an insulator-metal transition is driven by coherent lattice\ndistortions in the LaAlO3 substrate. We find that charge redistribution\npropagates at supersonic speeds from the interface into the NdNiO3 film,\nfollowed by a sonic lattice wave. When combined with measurements of magnetic\ndisordering and of the metal-insulator transition, these results establish a\nhierarchy of events for ultrafast control at complex oxide hetero-interfaces.\n", "  We report the detection of two new systems containing transiting planets.\nBoth were identified by WASP as worthy transiting planet candidates.\nRadial-velocity observations quickly verified that the photometric signals were\nindeed produced by two transiting hot Jupiters. Our observations also show the\npresence of additional Doppler signals. In addition to short-period hot\nJupiters, we find that the WASP-53 and WASP-81 systems also host brown dwarfs,\non fairly eccentric orbits with semi-major axes of a few astronomical units.\nWASP-53c is over 16 $M_{\\rm Jup} \\sin i_{\\rm c}$ and WASP-81c is 57 $M_{\\rm\nJup} \\sin i_{\\rm c}$. The presence of these tight, massive companions restricts\ntheories of how the inner planets were assembled. We propose two alternative\ninterpretations: a formation of the hot Jupiters within the snow line, or the\nlate dynamical arrival of the brown dwarfs after disc-dispersal.\n  We also attempted to measure the Rossiter--McLaughlin effect for both hot\nJupiters. In the case of WASP-81b we fail to detect a signal. For WASP-53b we\nfind that the planet is aligned with respect to the stellar spin axis. In\naddition we explore the prospect of transit timing variations, and of using\nGaia's astrometry to measure the true masses of both brown dwarfs and also\ntheir relative inclination with respect to the inner transiting hot Jupiters.\n", "  Some close-in gaseous exoplanets are nearly in Roche-lobe contact, and\nprevious studies show tidal decay can drive hot Jupiters into contact during\nthe main sequence of their host stars. Improving upon a previous model, we\npresent a revised model for mass transfer in a semi-detached binary system that\nincorporates an extended atmosphere around the donor and allows for an\narbitrary mass ratio. We apply this new formalism to hypothetical, confirmed,\nand candidate planetary systems to estimate mass loss rates and compare with\nmodels of evaporative mass loss. Overflow may be significant for hot Neptunes\nout to periods of $\\sim$ 2 days, while for hot Jupiters, it may only be\nimportant inward of 0.5 days. We find that CoRoT-24 b may be losing mass at a\nrate of more than an Earth mass in a Gyr. The hot Jupiter WASP-12 b may lose an\nEarth mass in a Myr, while the putative planet orbiting a T-Tauri star\nPTFO8-8695 might shed its atmosphere in a few Myrs. We point out that the\norbital expansion that can accompany mass transfer may be less effective than\npreviously considered because the gas accreted by the host star removes some of\nthe system's angular momentum from the orbit, but simple scaling arguments\nsuggest that the Roche-lobe overflow might remain stable. Consequently, the\nrecently discovered small planets in ultra-short-periods ($<$ 1 day) may not be\nthe remnants of hot Jupiters/Neptunes. The new model presented here has been\nincorporated into Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA).\n", "  The elemental compositions of planet hosting stars serve as proxies for the\nprimordial compositions of the protoplanetary disks within which the planets\nform. The temperature profile of the disk governs the condensation fronts of\nvarious compounds, and although these chemically distinct regions migrate and\nmix during the disk lifetime, they can still leave an imprint on the\ncompositions of the forming planets. Observable atmospheric compositions of hot\nJupiters when compared against their host stars could potentially constrain\ntheir formation and migration processes. We compared the measured planetary and\nstellar abundances of carbon and oxygen for ten systems with hot Jupiters. If\nthe planets formed by core accretion with significant planetesimal accretion\nand migrated through the disk, the hot Jupiter atmospheres should be\nsubstantially super-stellar in O/H and sub-stellar in C/O. On the contrary,\nhowever, we find that currently reported abundances of hot Jupiters have\ngenerally super-stellar C/O ratios, though present uncertainties on the\nreported O/H and C/O ratios are too large to reach a firm conclusion. In one\ncase however, HD 209458b, the elevated C/O and depleted O/H of the planet\ncompared to the host star is significant enough to suggest an origin far beyond\nthe ice line, with predominantly gas accretion, and subsequent disk-free\nmigration. Improved measurements from the James Webb Space Telescope will\nenable more precise measurements for more hot Jupiters and we predict, based on\nthe current marginal trend, that a sizable fraction of hot Jupiters will show\nenrichment of C/O and lower O/H than their hosts, similar to HD 209458b.\n", "  The recent discovery of gravitational radiation from merging black holes\nposes a challenge of how to organize the electromagnetic follow-up of\ngravitational-wave events as well as observed bursts of neutrinos. We propose a\ntechnique to select the galaxies that are most likely to host the event given\nsome assumptions of whether the particular event is associated with recent star\nformation, low metallicity stars or simply proportional to the total stellar\nmass in the galaxy. We combine data from the 2-MASS Photometric Redshift Galaxy\nCatalogue with results from galaxy formation simulations to develop observing\nstrategies that potentially reduce the area of sky to search by up to a factor\nof two relative to an unweighted search of galaxies, and a factor twenty to a\nsearch over the entire LIGO localization region.\n", "  We investigate the presence of non-topological solutions of the Q-ball type\nin (1, 1) spacetime dimensions. The model engenders the global U(1) symmetry\nand is of the k-field type, since it contains a new term, of the fourth-order\npower in the derivative of the complex scalar field. It supports analytical\nsolution of the Q-ball type which is stable quantum mechanically. The new\nsolution engenders an interesting behavior, with the charge and energy\ndensities unveiling a splitting profile.\n", "  We present the results of the chi2 minimization model fitting technique\napplied to optical and near-infrared photometric and radial velocity data for a\nsample of 9 fundamental and 3 first overtone classical Cepheids in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC). The near- infrared photometry (JK filters) was obtained\nby the European Southern Observatory (ESO) public survey \"VISTA near-infrared\nY; J;Ks survey of the Magellanic Clouds system\"(VMC). For each pulsator\nisoperiodic model sequences have been computed by adopting a nonlinear\nconvective hydrodynamical code in order to reproduce the multi- filter light\nand (when available) radial velocity curve amplitudes and morphological\ndetails. The inferred individual distances provide an intrinsic mean value for\nthe SMC distance modulus of 19.01 mag and a standard deviation of 0.08 mag, in\nagreement with the literature. Moreover the instrinsic masses and luminosities\nof the best fitting model show that all these pulsators are brighter than the\ncanonical evolutionary Mass- Luminosity relation (MLR), suggesting a\nsignificant efficiency of core overshooting and/or mass loss. Assuming that the\ninferred deviation from the canonical MLR is only due to mass loss, we derive\nthe expected distribution of percentage mass loss as a function of both the\npulsation period and of the canonical stellar mass. Finally, a good agreement\nis found between the predicted mean radii and current Period-Radius (PR)\nrelations in the SMC available in the literature. The results of this\ninvestigation support the predictive capabilities of the adopted theoretical\nscenario and pave the way to the application to other extensive databases at\nvarious chemical compositions, including the VMC Large Magellanic Cloud\npulsators and Galactic Cepheids with Gaia parallaxes.\n", "  In this article, we study the possibility of sustaining a static and\nspherically symmetric traversable wormhole geometries admitting conformal\nmotion in Einstein gravity, which presents a more systematic approach to search\na relation between matter and geometry. In wormhole physics, the presence of\nexotic matter is a fundamental ingredient and we show that this exotic source\ncan be dark energy type which support the existence of wormhole spacetimes. In\nthis work we model a wormhole supported by dark energy which admits conformal\nmotion. We also discuss the possibility of detection of wormholes in the outer\nregions of galactic halos by means of gravitational lensing. The studies of the\ntotal gravitational energy for the exotic matter inside a static wormhole\nconfiguration are also done.\n", "  We use the image solution technique to compute the leading order\nfrequency-dependent self-mobility function of a small solid particle moving\nperpendicular to the surface of a spherical capsule whose membrane possesses\nshearing and bending rigidities. Comparing our results with those obtained\nearlier for an infinitely extended planar elastic membrane, we find that\nmembrane curvature leads to the appearance of a prominent additional peak in\nthe mobility. This peak is attributed to the fact that the shear resistance of\nthe curved membrane involves a contribution from surface-normal displacements\nwhich is not the case for planar membranes. In the vanishing frequency limit,\nthe particle self-mobility near a no-slip hard sphere is recovered only when\nthe membrane possesses a non-vanishing resistance towards shearing. We further\ninvestigate capsule motion, finding that the pair-mobility function is solely\ndetermined by membrane shearing properties. Our analytical predictions are\nvalidated by fully resolved boundary integral simulations where a very good\nagreement is obtained.\n", "  Observations of the solar atmosphere show that internal gravity waves are\ngenerated by overshooting convection, but are suppressed at locations of\nmagnetic flux, which is thought to be the result of mode conversion into\nmagneto-acoustic waves. Here, we present a study of the acoustic-gravity wave\nspectrum emerging from a realistic, self-consistent simulation of solar\n(magneto-)convection. A magnetic field free, hydrodynamic simulation and a\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation with an initial, vertical, homogeneous\nfield of 50 G flux density were carried out and compared with each other to\nhighlight the effect of magnetic fields on the internal gravity wave\npropagation in the Sun's atmosphere. We find that the internal gravity waves\nare absent or partially reflected back into the lower layers in the presence of\nmagnetic fields and argue that the suppression is due to the coupling of\ninternal gravity waves to slow magneto acoustic waves still within the\nhigh-beta region of the upper photosphere. The conversion to Alfven waves is\nhighly unlikely in our model because there is no strongly inclined magnetic\nfield present. We argue that the suppression of internal waves observed within\nmagnetic flux-concentrations may also be due to non-linear breaking of internal\nwaves due to vortex flows that are ubiquitously present in the upper\nphotosphere and the chromosphere.\n", "  Determining the ages of red-giant stars is a key problem in stellar\nastrophysics. One of the difficulties in this determination is to know the\nevolutionary state of the individual stars -- i.e. have they started to burn\nHelium in their cores? That is the topic of this paper. Asteroseismic data\nprovide a route to achieving this information. What we present here is an\nhighly autonomous way of determining the evolutionary state from an analysis of\nthe power spectrum of the light curve. The method is fast and efficient and can\nprovide results for a large number of stars. It uses the structure of the\ndipole-mode oscillations, which have a mixed character in red-giant stars, to\ndetermine some measures that are used in the categorisation. It does not\nrequire that all the individual components of any given mode be separately\ncharacterised. Some 6604 red giant stars have been classified. Of these 3566\nare determined to be on the red-giant branch, 2077 are red-clump and 439 are\nsecondary-clump stars. We do not specifically identify the low metallicity,\nhorizontal-branch stars. The difference between red-clump and secondary-clump\nstars is dependent on the manner in which Helium burning is first initiated. We\ndiscuss that the way the boundary between these classifications is set may lead\nto mis-categorisation in a small number of stars. The remaining 522 stars were\nnot classified either because they lacked sufficient power in the dipole modes\n(so-called depressed dipole modes) or because of conflicting values in the\nparameters.\n", "  We try to constrain the cosmic molecular gas mass density at $z =1-1.5$ and\nthat in the local universe by combining stellar mass functions of star-forming\ngalaxies and their average molecular gas mass fractions against the stellar\nmass. The average molecular gas mass fractions are taken from recent CO\nobservations of star-forming galaxies at the redshifts. The cosmic molecular\ngas mass density is obtained to be $\\rho_{\\rm H_2} =\n(6.8-8.8)~\\times~10^7~M_\\odot~{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z=1-1.5$ and $6.7 \\times\n10^6~M_\\odot~{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \\sim 0$ by integrating down to\n$0.03~M^\\ast$. Although the values have various uncertainties, the cosmic\nmolecular gas mass density at $z =1-1.5$ is about ten times larger than that in\nthe local universe. The cosmic star formation rate density at $z \\sim 1-2$ is\nalso about ten times larger than that in the local universe. Our result\nsuggests that the large cosmic molecular gas mass density at $z=1-1.5$ accounts\nfor the large cosmic star formation rate density at $z \\sim 1 -2$.\n", "  We present a radio-quiet quasar at z=0.237 discovered \"turning on\" by the\nintermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). The transient, iPTF 16bco, was\ndetected by iPTF in the nucleus of a galaxy with an archival SDSS spectrum with\nweak narrow-line emission characteristic of a low-ionization emission line\nregion (LINER). Our follow-up spectra show the dramatic appearance of broad\nBalmer lines and a power-law continuum characteristic of a luminous\n(L_bol~10^45 erg/s) type 1 quasar 12 years later. Our photometric monitoring\nwith PTF from 2009-2012, and serendipitous X-ray observations from the\nXMM-Newton Slew Survey in 2011 and 2015, constrain the change of state to have\noccurred less than 500 days before the iPTF detection. An enhanced broad Halpha\nto [OIII]5007 line ratio in the type 1 state relative to other changing-look\nquasars also is suggestive of the most rapid change of state yet observed in a\nquasar. We argue that the >10 increase in Eddington ratio inferred from the\nbrightening in UV and X-ray continuum flux is more likely due to an intrinsic\nchange in the accretion rate of a pre-existing accretion disk, than an external\nmechanism such as variable obscuration, microlensing, or the tidal disruption\nof a star. However, further monitoring will be helpful in better constraining\nthe mechanism driving this change of state. The rapid \"turn on\" of the quasar\nis much shorter than the viscous infall timescale of an accretion disk, and\nrequires a disk instability that can develop around a ~10^8 M_sun black hole on\ntimescales less than a year.\n", "  We consider the interaction of gapped graphene in the two-band approximation\nusing an explicit time-dependent approach. In addition to the full high-order\nharmonic generation (HHG) spectrum, we also obtain the perturbative harmonic\nresponse using the time-dependent method at photon energies covering all the\nsignificant features in the responses. The transition from the perturbative to\nthe fully non-perturbative regime of HHG at these photon energies is studied in\ndetail.\n", "  Electrical resistivity measurements have been performed on the iron-based\nladder compounds Ba$_{1-x}$Cs$_x$Fe$_2$Se$_3$ ($x$ = 0, 0.25, 0.65, and 1)\nunder high pressure. A cubic anvil press was used up to 8.0 GPa, whereas\nfurther higher pressure was applied using a diamond anvil cell up to 30.0 GPa.\nMetallic behavior of the electrical conductivity was confirmed in the $x$ =\n0.25 and 0.65 samples for pressures greater than 11.3 and 14.4 GPa,\nrespectively, with the low-temperature $\\log T$ upturn being consistent with\nweak localization of 2D electrons due to random potential. At pressures higher\nthan 23.8 GPa, three-dimensional Fermi-liquid-like behavior was observed in the\nlatter sample. No metallic conductivity was observed in the parent compounds\nBaFe$_2$Se$_3$ ($x $ = 0) up to 30.0 GPa and CsFe$_2$Se$_3$ ($x$ = 1) up to\n17.0 GPa. The present results indicate that the origins of the insulating\nground states in the parent and intermediate compounds are intrinsically\ndifferent; the former is a Mott insulator, whereas the latter is an Anderson\ninsulator owing to the random substitution of Cs for Ba.\n", "  The MICROSCOPE space mission, launched on April 25, 2016, aims to test the\nweak equivalence principle (WEP) with a 10^-15 precision. To reach this\nperformance requires an accurate and robust data analysis method, especially\nsince the possible WEP violation signal will be dominated by a strongly colored\nnoise. An important complication is brought by the fact that some values will\nbe missing -therefore, the measured time series will not be strictly regularly\nsampled. Those missing values induce a spectral leakage that significantly\nincreases the noise in Fourier space, where the WEP violation signal is looked\nfor, thereby complicating scientific returns. Recently, we developed an\ninpainting algorithm to correct the MICROSCOPE data for missing values. This\ncode has been integrated in the official MICROSCOPE data processing pipeline\nbecause it enables us to significantly measure an equivalence principle\nviolation (EPV) signal in a model-independent way, in the inertial satellite\nconfiguration. In this work, we present several improvements to the method that\nmay allow us now to reach the MICROSCOPE requirements for both inertial and\nspin satellite configurations. The main improvement has been obtained using a\nprior on the power spectrum of the colored-noise that can be directly derived\nfrom the incomplete data. We show that after reconstructing missing values with\nthis new algorithm, a least-squares fit may allow us to significantly measure\nan EPV signal with a 0.96x10^-15 precision in the inertial mode and 1.2x10^-15\nprecision in the spin mode. Although, the inpainting method presented in this\npaper has been optimized to the MICROSCOPE data, it remains sufficiently\ngeneral to be used in the general context of missing data in time series\ndominated by an unknown colored-noise. The improved inpainting software, called\nICON, is freely available at http://www.cosmostat.org/software/icon.\n", "  The coming era of large photometric wide-field surveys will increase the\ndetection rate of supernovae by orders of magnitude. Such numbers will restrict\nspectroscopic follow-up in the vast majority of cases, and hence new methods\nbased solely on photometric data must be developed. Here, we construct a\ncomplete Hubble diagram of Type II supernovae combining data from three\ndifferent samples: the Carnegie Supernova Project-I, the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey-II SN, and the Supernova Legacy Survey. Applying the Photometric Colour\nMethod (PCM) to 73 Type II supernovae (SNe~II) with a redshift range of\n0.01--0.5 and with no spectral information, we derive an intrinsic dispersion\nof 0.35 mag. A comparison with the Standard Candle Method (SCM) using 61 SNe~II\nis also performed and an intrinsic dispersion in the Hubble diagram of 0.27 mag\nis derived, i.e., 13\\% in distance uncertainties. Due to the lack of good\nstatistics at higher redshifts for both methods, only weak constraints on the\ncosmological parameters are obtained. However, assuming a flat Universe and\nusing the PCM, we derive a Universe's matter density:\n$\\Omega_{m}$=0.32$^{+0.30}_{-0.21}$ providing a new independent evidence for\ndark energy at the level of two sigma.\n", "  The formation scenario of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn has been revisited.\niPTF13bvn is unique in the sense that a corresponding pre-supernova image has\nbeen identified. This has enabled us to strongly constrain the nature of its\nprogenitor. From the pre-supernova image, light curve and the latest\nobservations, it is currently widely accepted that the progenitor of iPTF13bvn\nwas in a binary system. The fast decline in the light curve suggests a\nprogenitor mass of $\\sim3.5M_\\odot$, and the upper limit on the remaining\ncompanion is $\\sim20M_\\odot$. Recent works suggest that binary evolution models\ninvolving common envelope episodes can satisfy all the observational\nconstraints. We have examined the common envelope scenario based on latest\nknowledges on common envelope evolution. We have found that the common envelope\nscenario for the progenitor of iPTF13bvn seems not to be suitable since it can\nnot explain the pre-supernova radius. We also propose an alternative model with\na black hole companion. Stellar evolution calculations with a large black hole\ncompanion were carried out and succeeded in satisfying all observational\nconstraints. However, more studies should be carried out to explain the origin\nof the large black hole companion.\n", "  The flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 is a known $\\gamma$-ray variable source\nthat has recently exhibited minute-scale variability at energies $>100$ MeV.\nOne-zone leptonic models for blazar emission are severely constrained by the\nshort timescale variability that implies a very compact emission region at a\ndistance of hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the central black hole. Here,\nwe investigate a hadronic scenario where GeV $\\gamma$-rays are produced via\nproton synchrotron radiation. We also take into account the effects of the\nhadronically initiated electromagnetic cascades (EMC). For a $\\gamma$-ray\nemitting region in rough equipartition between particles and kG magnetic\nfields, located within the broad-line region (BLR), the development of EMC\nredistributes the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity to softer energy bands and eventually\nleads to broad-band spectra that differ from the observed ones. Suppression of\nEMC and energy equipartition are still possible, if the $\\gamma$-ray emitting\nregion is located beyond the BLR, is fast moving with Doppler factor ($>70$),\nand contains strong magnetic fields ($>100$ G). Yet, these conditions cannot be\neasily met in parsec-scale jets, thus disfavouring a proton synchrotron origin\nof the Fermi-LAT flare.\n", "  Plages are the magnetically active chromospheric structures prominently\nvisible in Ca $\\scriptsize{{\\textrm{II}}}$ K line (3933.67 \\r{A}). A plage may\nor may not be associated with a sunspot which is a magnetic structure visible\nin the solar photosphere. In this study we explore this aspect of association\nof plages with sunspots using the newly digitized Kodaikanal Ca\n$\\scriptsize{{\\textrm{II}}}$ K plage data and the Greenwich sunspot area data.\nInstead of using the plage index or fractional plage area and their comparison\nwith the sunspot number, we use, to our knowledge for the first time, the\nindividual plage areas and compared it with the sunspot area time series. Our\nanalysis shows that these two structures formed at two different layers are\nhighly correlated with each other on a time scale comparable to the solar\ncycle. The area and the latitudinal distributions of plages are also similar to\nthat of the sunspots. Different area thresholdings on the `Butterfly diagram'\nreveal that plages with area $\\geq$4 arcmin$^2$ are mostly associated with a\nsunspot in the photosphere. Apart from this, we found that the cyclic\nproperties change when different sized plages are considered separately. These\nresults may help us to better understand the generation and the evolution of\nthe magnetic structures in different layers of the solar atmosphere.\n", "  Chang-Refsdal (C-R) lensing, which refers to the gravitational lensing of a\npoint mass perturbed by a constant external shear, provides a good\napproximation in describing lensing behaviors of either a very wide or a very\nclose binary lens. C-R lensing events, which are identified by short-term\nanomalies near the peak of a high-magnification lensing light curves, are\nroutinely detected from lensing surveys, but not much attention is paid to\nthem. In this paper, we point out that C-R lensing events provide an important\nchannel to detect planets in binaries, both in close and wide binary systems.\nDetecting planets through the C-R lensing event channel is possible because the\nplanet-induced perturbation occurs in the same region of the C-R\nlensing-induced anomaly and thus the existence of the planet can be identified\nby the additional deviation in the central perturbation. By presenting the\nanalysis of the actually observed C-R lensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1319, we\ndemonstrate that dense and high-precision coverage of a C-R lensing-induced\nperturbation can provide a strong constraint on the existence of a planet in\nthe wide range of the planet parameters. The sample of an increased number of\nmicrolensing planets in binary systems will provide important observational\nconstraints in giving shape to the details of the planet formation scenario\nwhich has been restricted to the case of single stars.\n", "  We study compound systems with a classical sector and a quantum sector. Among\nother consistency conditions we require a canonical structure, that is, a Lie\nbracket for the dynamical evolution of hybrid observables in the Heisenberg\npicture, interpolating between the Poisson bracket and the commutator. Weak and\nstrong postulates are proposed. We explicitly construct one such hybrid bracket\nwhen the Hilbert space of the quantum sector is finite dimensional and show\nthat it is unique if the strong postulates are enforced. The adjoint bracket\nfor the Schrodinger picture version of the dynamics is also obtained.\nUnfortunately, preservation of the positivity of the density matrix under the\nevolution is not guaranteed. The case of a particle with classical position and\nmomentum and quantum spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ is discussed and the spin-orbit\ndynamics is worked out.\n", "  Using the explicit string scattering calculation and the linear T-dual ward\nidentity, we evaluate the string theory disc amplitude of one Ramond-Ramond\nfield $C^{(p+1)}$ and two Neveu-Schwarz B-fields in the presence of a single\n$D_p$-brane in type $IIB$ string theory. From this amplitude we extract the\n$O(\\alpha'^2)$ (or equivalently four-derivative) part of the $D_p$-brane\ncouplings involving these fields.\n", "  Observations of extended atmospheres around hot planets have generated\nexciting results concerning the dynamics of escaping planetary material. The\nconfiguration of the escaping planetary gas can result in asymmetric transit\nfeatures, producing both pre- and post-transit absorption in specific atomic\ntransitions. Measuring the velocity and strength of the absorption can provide\nconstraints on the mass loss mechanism and, potentially, clues to the\ninteractions between the planet and the host star. Here we present a search for\nH$\\alpha$ absorption in the circumplanetary environments of the hot planets\nKELT-3 b and GJ 436 b. We find no evidence for absorption around either planet\nat any point during the two separate transit epochs that each system was\nobserved. We provide upper limits on the radial extent and density of the\nexcited hydrogen atmospheres around both planets. The null detection for GJ 436\nb contrasts with the strong Ly$\\alpha$ absorption measured for the same system,\nsuggesting that the large cloud of neutral hydrogen is almost entirely in the\nground state. The only confirmed exoplanetary H$\\alpha$ absorption to date has\nbeen made around the active star HD 189733 b. KELT-3 and GJ 436 are less active\nthan HD 189733, hinting that exoplanet atmospheres exposed to EUV photons from\nactive stars are better suited for H$\\alpha$ absorption detection.\n", "  Interplanetary space is characteristically structured mainly by high-speed\nsolar wind streams emanating from coronal holes and transient disturbances such\nas coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While high-speed solar wind streams pose a\ncontinuous outflow, CMEs abruptly disrupt the rather steady structure causing\nlarge deviations from the quiet solar wind conditions. For the first time, we\ngive a quantification of the duration of disturbed conditions (preconditioning)\nfor interplanetary space caused by CMEs. To this aim, we investigate the plasma\nspeed component of the solar wind and the impact of in situ detected CMEs\n(ICMEs), compared to different background solar wind models (ESWF, WSA,\npersistence model) for the time range 2011-2015. We quantify in terms of\nstandard error measures the deviations between modeled background solar wind\nspeed and observed solar wind speed. Using the mean absolute error, we obtain\nan average deviation for quiet solar activity within a range of 75.1-83.1 km/s.\nCompared to this baseline level, periods within the ICME interval showed an\nincrease of 18-32% above the expected background and the period of 2 days after\nthe ICME displayed an increase of 9-24%. We obtain a total duration of enhanced\ndeviations over about 3 and up to 6 days after the ICME start, which is much\nlonger than the average duration of an ICME disturbance itself (~1.3 days),\nconcluding that interplanetary space needs ~2-5 days to recover from the impact\nof ICMEs. The obtained results have strong implications for studying CME\npropagation behavior and also for space weather forecasting.\n", "  We present measurements of star formation rates (SFRs) for dwarf galaxies\n(M*~10^8.5 Msun ) at z~1 using near-infrared slitless spectroscopy from the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) by targetting and measuring the luminosity of the\nH{\\alpha} emission line. Our sample is derived from the Redshift One LDSS3\nEmission Line Survey (ROLES), which used [O II]{\\lambda} 3727 as a tracer of\nstar formation to target very low stellar masses down to very low SFRs (~0.1\nMsun yr^-1) at this epoch. Dust corrections are estimated using SED-fits and we\nfind, by comparison with other studies using Balmer decrement dust corrections,\nthat we require a smaller ratio between the gas phase and stellar extinction\nthan the nominal Calzetti relation, in agreement with recent findings by other\nstudies. By stacking the WFC3 spectra at the redshifts obtained from\nground-based [O II] detections, we are able to push the WFC3 spectra to much\nlower SFRs and obtain the most complete spectroscopic measurement of the low\nmass end of the SSFR--mass relation to date. We measure a flatter low mass\npower law slope (-0.47 +/- 0.04) than found by other (shallower)\nH{\\alpha}-selected samples (\\approx -1), although still somewhat steeper than\nthat predicted by the EAGLE simulation (-0.14 +/- 0.05), hinting at possible\nmissing physics not modelled by EAGLE or remaining incompleteness for our\nH{\\alpha} data.\n", "  We explore the idea that the coupling between matter and spacetime is more\ncomplex than the one originally envisioned by Einstein. We propose that such\ncoupling takes the form of a new fundamental tensor in the Einstein field\nequations. We then show that the introduction of this tensor can account for\ndark phenomenology in General Relativity, maintaining a weak field limit\ncompatible with standard Newtonian gravitation. The same paradigm can be\napplied any other theory of gravitation. We show, as an example, that in the\ncontext of conformal gravity a generalised coupling is able to solve\ncompatibility issues between the matter and the gravitational sector.\n", "  As is well known, the gravitational degrees of freedom contained in $R+\\zeta\nR^{2}$ (super)gravity lead to Starobinsky's potential, in a one-field setting\nfor inflationary Cosmology that appears favored by Planck data. In this letter\nwe discuss another interesting aspect of this model, related to gravitino\nproduction, with emphasis on the corresponding mass spectrum. Assuming that\nsupersymmetry is broken at a very high scale, Super Heavy Gravitino Dark Matter\n(SHGDM) and Starobinsky's inflation can be coherently unified in a $R+\\zeta\nR^{2}$ supergravity. Gravitinos are assumed to be the Lightest Supersymmetric\nParticles (LSP) and are non-thermally produced during inflation, in turn\noriginated by a scalar with a Starobinsky's potential. Gravitino mass runs with\nthe inflaton field, so that a continuos spectrum of superheavy gravitinos\nemerges. The theory is implemented with a $U(1)_{R}$ gauge symmetry. However,\nin a string UV completion, $U(1)_{R}$-symmetry can be broken by\nnon-perturbative string instantons, while for consistency of our scenario\n$U(1)_{R}$ gauge symmetry breaking must be broken in order to generate a soft\nmass terms for the gravitino and gauginos. R-parity violating operators can be\ngenerated at non-perturbative level. Gravitinos can decay into very energetic\nneutrinos and photons in cosmological time scale, with intriguing implications\nfor high energy cosmic rays experiments.\n", "  We report on the first open-use based Atacama Large Millimeter/submm Array\n(ALMA) 345-GHz observation for the late afterglow phase of GRB131030A. The ALMA\nobservation constrained a deep limit at 17.1 d for the afterglow and host\ngalaxy. We also identified a faint submillimeter source (ALMAJ2300-0522) near\nthe GRB131030A position. The deep limit at 345 GHz and multifrequency\nobservations obtained using {\\it Swift} and RATIR yielded forward shock\nmodeling with a two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic jet simulation and\ndescribed X-ray excess in the afterglow. The excess was inconsistent with the\nsynchrotron self-inverse Compton radiation from the forward shock. The host\ngalaxy of GRB131030A and optical counterpart of ALMAJ2300-0522 were also\nidentified in the SUBARU image. Based on the deep ALMA limit for the host\ngalaxy, the 3-$\\sigma$ upper limits of IR luminosity and the star formation\nrate (SFR) is estimated as $L_{IR}<1.11\\times10^{11} L_{\\odot}$ and SFR$<18.7$\n($M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$), respectively. Although the separation angle from the\nburst location (3.5 arcsec) was rather large, ALMAJ2300-0522 may be one\ncomponent of the GRB131030A host galaxy, according to previous host galaxy\ncases.\n", "  Transport of quantum or classical waves in open systems is known to be\nstrongly affected by non-Hermitian terms that arise from an effective\ndescription of system-enviroment interaction. A simple and paradigmatic example\nof non-Hermitian transport, originally introduced by Hatano and Nelson two\ndecades ago [N. Hatano and D.R. Nelson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 570 (1996)], is\nthe hopping dynamics of a quantum particle on a one-dimensional tight-binding\nlattice in the presence of an imaginary vectorial potential. The imaginary\ngauge field can prevent Anderson localization via non-Hermitian delocalization,\nopening up a mobility region and realizing robust transport immune to disorder\nand backscattering. Like for robust transport of topologically-protected edge\nstates in quantum Hall and topological insulator systems, non-Hermitian robust\ntransport in the Hatano- Nelson model is unidirectional. However, there is not\nany physical impediment to observe robust bidirectional non-Hermitian\ntransport. Here it is shown that in a quasi-one dimensional zigzag lattice,\nwith non-Hermitian (imaginary) hopping amplitudes and a synthetic gauge field,\nrobust transport immune to backscattering can occur bidirectionally along the\nlattice.\n", "  The nature of progenitors of the so-called super-Chandrasekhar candidate Type\nIa supernovae (SC-SNe Ia) has been actively debated. Recently, Yamanaka et al.\n(2016) reported a near-infrared (NIR) excess for SN 2012dn, and proposed that\nthe excess originates from an echo by circumstellar (CS) dust. In this paper,\nwe examine a detailed distribution of the CS dust around SN 2012dn, and\ninvestigate implications of the CS dust echo scenario for general cases of\nSC-SNe Ia. We find that a disk/bipolar CS medium configuration reproduces the\nNIR excess fairly well, where the radial density distribution is given by a\nstationary mass loss. The inner radius of the CS dust is $0.04$ pc. The\nmass-loss rate of the progenitor system is estimated to be $1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$\nand $3.2 \\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the disk and bipolar CS\nmedium configurations, respectively, which adds another support for the single\ndegenerate scenario. Our models limit SN 2009dc, another SC-SN Ia, to have a\ndust mass less than $0.16$ times that of SN 2012dn. While this may merely\nindicate some variation on the CS environment among SC-SNe Ia, this could raise\nanother interesting possibility. There could be two classes among SC-SNe Ia;\nthe brighter SC-SNe Ia in a clean environment (SN 2009dc) and the fainter\nSC-SNe Ia in a dusty environment (SN 2012dn).\n", "  Comets can exhibit non-gravitational accelerations caused by recoil forces\ndue to anisotropic mass loss. So might active asteroids. We present an\nastrometric investigation of 18 active asteroids in search of non-gravitational\nacceleration. Statistically significant (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $> 3$)\ndetections are obtained in three objects: 313P/Gibbs, 324P/La Sagra and (3200)\nPhaethon. The strongest and most convincing detection ($>$7$\\sigma$ in each of\nthree orthogonal components of the acceleration), is for the $\\sim$1 km\ndiameter nucleus of 324P/La Sagra. A 4.5$\\sigma$ detection of the transverse\ncomponent of the acceleration of 313P/Gibbs (also $\\sim$1 km in diameter) is\nlikely genuine too, as evidenced by the stability of the solution to the\nrejection or inclusion of specific astrometric datasets. We also find a\n3.4$\\sigma$ radial-component detection for $\\sim$5 km diameter (3200) Phaethon,\nbut this detection is more sensitive to the inclusion of specific datasets,\nsuggesting that it is likely spurious in origin. The other 15 active asteroids\nin our sample all show non-gravitational accelerations consistent with zero. We\nexplore different physical mechanisms which may give rise to the observed\nnon-gravitational effects, and estimate mass-loss rates from the\nnon-gravitational accelerations. We present a revised momentum-transfer law\nbased on a physically realistic sublimation model for future work on\nnon-gravitational forces, but note that it has little effect on the derived\norbital elements.\n", "  We study the underlying theory of dielectric haloscopes, a new way to detect\ndark matter axions. When an interface between different dielectric media is\ninside a magnetic field, the oscillating axion field acts as a source of\nelectromagnetic waves, which emerge in both directions perpendicular to the\nsurface. The emission rate can be boosted by multiple layers judiciously placed\nto achieve constructive interference and by a large transverse area. Starting\nfrom the axion-modified Maxwell equations, we calculate the efficiency of this\nnew dielectric haloscope approach. This technique could potentially search the\nunexplored high-frequency range of 10--100 GHz (axion mass 40--400 $\\mu$eV),\nwhere traditional cavity resonators have difficulties reaching the required\nvolume.\n", "  The Chelyabinsk meteorite is a highly shocked, low porosity, ordinary\nchondrite, probably similar to S- or Q-type asteroids. Therefore,\nnanoindentation experiments on this meteorite allow us to obtain key data to\nunderstand the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids. Tests at different\nlength scales provide information about the local mechanical properties of the\nminerals forming this meteorite: reduced Young's modulus, hardness, elastic\nrecovery, and fracture toughness. Those tests are also useful to understand the\npotential to deflect threatening asteroids using a kinetic projectile. We found\nthat the differences in mechanical properties between regions of the meteorite,\nwhich increase or reduce the efficiency of impacts, are not a result of\ncompositional differences. A low mean particle size, attributed to repetitive\nshock, can increase hardness, while low porosity promotes a higher momentum\nmultiplication. Momentum multiplication is the ratio between the change in\nmomentum of a target due to an impact, and the momentum of the projectile, and,\ntherefore higher values imply more efficient impacts. In the Chelyabinsk\nmeteorite, the properties of the light-colored lithology materials facilitate\nobtaining higher momentum multiplication values, compared to the other regions\ndescribed for this meteorite. Also, we found a low value of fracture toughness\nin the shock-melt veins of Chelyabinsk, which would promote the ejection of\nmaterial after an impact and, therefore, increase the momentum multiplication.\nThese results are relevant considering the growing interest in missions to test\nasteroid deflection, such as the recent collaboration between the European\nSpace Agency and NASA, known as the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment\nmission.\n", "  Photoproduction of electron-positron pairs by the strong-field Breit-Wheeler\nprocess in an intense laser field is studied. The laser field is assumed to\nconsist of two consecutive short pulses, with a variable time delay in between.\nBy numerical calculations within the framework of scalar quantum\nelectrodynamics, we demonstrate that the time delay exerts a strong impact on\nthe pair-creation probability. For the case when both pulses are identical, the\neffect is traced back to the relative quantum phase of the interfering S-matrix\namplitudes and explained within a simplified analytical model. Conversely, when\nthe two laser pulses differ from each other, the pair-creation probability\ndepends not only on the time delay but, in general, also on the temporal order\nof the pulses.\n", "  The magnetic dynamics of low-dimensional iron ion chains have been studied\nwith regards to the tunable finite-sized chain length using iron phthalocyanine\nthin films. The deposition temperature varies the diffusion length during thin\nfilm growth by limiting the average crystal size in the range from 40 to 110\nnm. Using a method common for single chain magnets, the magnetic relaxation\ntime for each chain length is determined from temporal remanence data and fit\nto a stretched exponential form in the temperature range below 5 K, the onset\nfor magnetic hysteresis. A temperature-independent master curve is generated by\nscaling the remanence by its relaxation time to fit the energy barrier for spin\nreversal, and the single spin relaxation time. The energy barrier of 95 K is\nfound to be independent of the chain length. In contrast, the single spin\nrelaxation time increases with longer chains from under 1 ps to 800 ps. We show\nthat thin films provide the nano-architecture to control magnetic relaxation\nand a testbed to study finite-size effects in low-dimensional magnetic systems.\n", "  Predicting the large-amplitude deformations of thin elastic sheets is\ndifficult due to the complications of self-contact, geometric nonlinearities,\nand a multitude of low-lying energy states. We study a simple two-dimensional\nsetting where an annular polymer sheet floating on an air-water interface is\nsubjected to different tensions on the inner and outer rims. The sheet folds\nand wrinkles into many distinct morphologies that break axisymmetry. These\nstates can be understood within a recent geometric approach for determining the\ngross shape of extremely bendable yet inextensible sheets by extremizing an\nappropriate area functional. Our analysis explains the remarkable feature that\nthe observed buckling transitions between wrinkled and folded shapes are\ninsensitive to the bending rigidity of the sheet.\n", "  Zitterbewegung (ZB) is a phenomenon in relativistic quantum systems where the\nelectron wave packet exhibits a trembling or oscillating behavior during its\nmotion, caused by its interaction or coupling with the negative energy state.\nTo directly observe ZB in electronic systems is difficult, due to the\nchallenges associated with the atomic scale wavelength of the electron.\nPhotonic systems offer an alternative paradigm. We exploit the concept of\npseudo parity-time (pseudo PT ) symmetry to study ZB in non-Hermitian quantum\nsystems implemented as an experimentally feasible optical waveguide array. In\nparticular, the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is realized through evanescent\ncoupling among the waveguides to form a one-dimensional lattice with periodic\nmodulations in gain and loss along the guiding direction. As the modulation\nfrequency is changed, we obtain a number of phenomena including periodically\nsuppressed ZB trembling, spatial energy localization, and Hermitian-like ZB\noscillations. We calculate phase diagrams indicating the emergence of different\ntypes of dynamical behaviors of the relativistic non-Hermitian quantum system\nin an experimentally justified parameter space. We provide numerical results\nand a physical analysis to explain the distinct dynamical behaviors revealed by\nthe phase diagrams. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of both the\nrelativistic ZB phenomenon and non-Hermitian pseudo-PT systems, with potential\napplications in controlling/harnessing light propagation in waveguide-based\noptical systems.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of a model neuron that receives a\nbiophysically-realistic noisy post-synaptic current based on uncorrelated\nspiking activity from a large number of afferents. We show that, with static\nsynapses, such noise can give rise to inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) as a\nfunction of the presynaptic firing rate. We compare this to the case with\ndynamic synapses that feature short-term synaptic plasticity, and show that the\ninterval of presynaptic firing rate over which ISR exists can be extended or\ndiminished. We consider both short-term depression and facilitation.\nInterestingly, we find that a double inverse stochastic resonance (DISR), with\ntwo distinct wells centered at different presynaptic firing rates, can appear.\n", "  A study of the zero field and field induced magnetic states of the frustrated\nrare earth tetraboride, HoB$_4$, has been carried out using single crystal\nneutron diffraction complemented by magnetisation measurements. In zero field,\nHoB$_4$ shows magnetic phase transitions at $T_{\\mathrm{N1}}$ = 7.1 K to an\nincommensurate state with a propagation vector ($\\delta$, $\\delta$, $\\delta'$),\nwhere $\\delta$ = 0.02 and $\\delta'$ = 0.43 and at $T_{\\mathrm{N2}}$ = 5.7 K to\na non-collinear commensurate antiferromagnetic structure. Polarised neutron\ndiffraction measurements in zero field have revealed that the incommensurate\nreflections, albeit much reduced in intensity, persist down to 1.5 K despite\nantiferromagnetic ordering at 5.7 K. At lower temperatures, application of a\nmagnetic field along the $c$-axis initially re-establishes the incommensurate\nphase as the dominant magnetic state in a narrow field range, just prior to\nHoB$_4$ ordering with an up-up-down ferrimagnetic structure characterised by\nthe $(h,k,\\frac{1}{3})$-type reflections between 18 and 24 kOe. This field\nrange is marked by the previously reported $M/M_{\\mathrm{sat}}$= $\\frac{1}{3}$\nmagnetisation plateau, which we also see in our magnetisation measurements. The\nregion between 21 and 33 kOe is characterised by the increase in the intensity\nof the antiferromagnetic reflections, such as (100), the maximum of which\ncoincides with the appearance of the narrow magnetisation plateau with\n$M/M_{\\mathrm{sat}}\\approx$ $\\frac{3}{5}$. Further increase of the magnetic\nfield results in the stabilisation of a polarised state above 33 kOe, while the\nincommensurate reflections are clearly present in all fields up to 59 kOe. We\npropose the $H-T$ phase diagram of HoB$_4$ for the $H \\parallel c$ containing\nboth stationary and transitionary magnetic phases which overlap and show\nsignificant history dependence.\n", "  An array of excitable Josephson junctions under global mean-field interaction\nand a common periodic forcing shows emergence of two important classes of\ncoherent dynamics, librational and rotational motion in the weaker and stronger\ncoupling limits, respectively, with transitions to chimeralike states and\nclustered states in the intermediate coupling range. In this numerical study,\nwe use the Kuramoto complex order parameter and introduce two measures, a\nlibration index and a clustering index to characterize the dynamical regimes\nand their transition and locate them in a parameter plane.\n", "  As a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics, Born's rule assigns\nprobabilities to the measurement outcomes of quantum systems and excludes\nmulti-order quantum interference. Here we report an experiment on a single spin\nin diamond to test Born's rule by inspecting the third-order quantum\ninterference. The ratio of the third-order quantum interference to the\nsecond-order in our experiment is ceiled at the scale of $10^{-3}$, which\nprovides a stringent constraint on the potential breakdown of Born's rule.\n", "  The theory of \"Adiabatic Fountain Resonance\" with superfluid $^4$He is\nclarified. In this geometry a film region between two silicon wafers bonded at\ntheir outer edge opens up to a central region with a free surface. We find that\nthe resonance in this system is not a Helmholtz resonance as claimed by\nGasparini and co-workers, but in fact is a fourth sound resonance. We postulate\nthat it occurs at relatively low frequency because the thin silicon wafers flex\nappreciably from the pressure oscillations of the sound wave.\n", "  A precursor of superconductivity has been searched in the in-plane optical\nspectra of underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$, in which the previous $c$-axis\noptical spectra showed the presence of superconducting carriers at a\ntemperature far above $T_c$ [Uykur $et al$., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 127003\n(2014)][Dubroka $et al$., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 047006 (2011)]. By carefully\nsubtracting the normal component from the imaginary part of conductivity\n$\\sigma_2$($\\omega$), we found a clear in-plane response of superconducting\ncondensate at the temperature consistent with the $c$-axis optical data. This\nconfirms that the precursory superconductivity developing with reducing a\ndoping level is an intrinsic phenomenon in the cuprates.\n", "  The frequency of multiple systems and their properties are key constraints of\nstellar formation and evolution. Formation mechanisms of very low-mass (VLM)\nobjects are still under considerable debate and an accurate assessment of their\nmultiplicity and orbital properties are essential for constraining current\ntheoretical models.\n  Taking advantage of the Virtual Observatory capabilities, we looked for\ncomoving low and VLM binary (or multiple) systems using the Large Area Survey\nof the UKIDSS LAS DR10, SDSS DR9, and the 2MASS Catalogues. Other catalogues\n(WISE, GLIMPSE, SuperCosmos ...) were used to derive the physical parameters of\nthe systems.\n  We report the identification of 36 low and VLM (~M0-L0 spectral types)\ncandidates to binary/multiple system (separations between 200 and 92000 AU),\nwhose physical association is confirmed through common proper motion, distance\nand low probability of chance alignment. This new system list notably increases\nthe previous sampling in their mass-separation parameter space (~100). We have\nalso found 50 low-mass objects that we can classify as ~L0-T2 according to\ntheir photometric information. Only one of these objects presents a common\nproper motion high-mass companion.\n  Although we could not constrain the age of the majority of the candidates,\nprobably most of them are still bound except four that may be under disruption\nprocesses. We suggest that our sample could be divided in two populations: one\ntightly bound wide VLM systems that are expected to last more than 10 Gyr, and\nother formed by weak bound wide VLM systems that will dissipate within a few\nGyr.\n", "  Non equilibrium coarse grained, dissipative particle dynamics simulations of\ncomplex fluids, made up of polymer brushes tethered to planar surfaces immersed\nin a solvent yield non monotonic behavior of the friction coefficient as a\nfunction of the polymer grating density on the substrates, \\Gamma, while the\nviscosity shows a monotonically increasing dependence on \\Gamma. This effect is\nshown to be independent of the degree of polymerization, N, and the size of the\nsystem. It arises from the composition and the structure of the first particle\nlayer adjacent to each surface that results from the confinement of the fluid.\nWhenever such layers are made up of as close a proportion of polymer beads to\nsolvent particles as there are in the fluid, the friction coefficient shows a\nminimum, while for disparate proportions the friction coefficient grows. At the\nmushroom to brush transition (MBT) the viscosity scales with an exponent that\ndepends on the characteristic exponent of the MBT (6/5) and the solvent quality\nexponent (\\nu = 0.5, for theta solvent), but it is independent of the\npolymerization degree (N). On the other hand, the friction coefficient at the\nMBT scales as {\\mu}~N^(6/5), while the grafting density at the MBT scales as\n{\\Gamma}~ N^(-6/5) when friction is minimal, in agreement with previous scaling\ntheories. We argue these aspects are the result of cooperative phenomena that\nhave important implications for the understanding of biological brushes and the\ndesign of microfluidics devices, among other applications of current academic\nand industrial interest.\n", "  High-mass star formation is one of the top-priority issues in astrophysics.\nRecent observational studies are revealing that cloud-cloud collisions may play\na role in high-mass star formation in several places in the Milky Way and the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud. The Trifid Nebula M20 is a well known galactic HII\nregion ionized by a single O7.5 star. In 2011, based on the CO observations\nwith NANTEN2 we reported that the O star was formed by the collision between\ntwo molecular clouds ~0.3,Myr ago. Those observations identified two molecular\nclouds towards M20, traveling at a relative velocity of 7.5 km/s. This velocity\nseparation implies that the clouds cannot be gravitationally bound to M20, but\nsince the clouds show signs of heating by the stars there they must be\nspatially coincident with it. A collision is therefore highly possible. In this\npaper we present the new CO J=1-0 and J=3-2 observations of the colliding\nclouds in M20 performed with the Mopra and ASTE telescopes. The high resolution\nobservations revealed the two molecular clouds have peculiar spatial and\nvelocity structures, i.e., the spatially complementary distribution between the\ntwo clouds and the bridge feature which connects the two clouds in velocity\nspace. Based on a new comparison with numerical models, we find that this\ncomplementary distribution is an expected outcome of cloud-cloud collisions,\nand that the bridge feature can be interpreted as the turbulent gas excited at\nthe interface of the collision. Our results reinforce the cloud-cloud collision\nscenario in M20.\n", "  A precision measurement by AMS of the antiproton-to-proton flux ratio in\nprimary cosmic rays in the absolute rigidity range from 1 to 450 GV is\npresented based on $3.49\\times10^5$ antiproton events and $2.42\\times10^9$\nproton events. Above $\\sim60$ GV the antiproton to proton flux ratio is\nconsistent with being rigidity independent. A decreasing behaviour is expected\nfor this ratio considering the traditional models for the secondary antiproton\nflux.\n", "  Decades after the beginning of its FU Orionis-type outburst, V346 Nor\nunexpectedly underwent a fading event of $\\Delta{}K$ = 4.6 mag around 2010. We\nobtained near-infrared observations and re-analysed data from the VISTA/VVV\nsurvey to outline the brightness evolution. In our VLT/NaCO images, we\ndiscovered a halo of scattered light around V346~Nor with a size of about 0.04\narcsec (30 au). The VISTA data outlined a well-defined minimum in the light\ncurve at late 2010/early 2011, and tentatively revealed a small-amplitude\nperiodic modulation of 58 days. Our latest data points from 2016 demonstrate\nthat the source is still brightening but has not reached the 2008 level yet. We\nused a simple accretion disk model with varying accretion rate and\nline-of-sight extinction to reproduce the observed near-infrared magnitudes and\ncolors. We found that before 2008, the flux changes of V346 Nor were caused by\na correlated change of extinction and accretion rate, while the minimum around\n2010 was mostly due to decreasing accretion. The source reached a maximal\naccretion rate of ${\\approx}10^{-4} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ in 1992. A combination\nof accretion and extinction changes was already invoked in the literature to\ninterpret the flux variations of certain embedded young eruptive stars.\n", "  The observation of neutrino oscillation as well as the recent experimental\nresult on lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation in $B$ meson decays are\nindications of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Many theoretical models,\nwhich are introduced in the literature as an extension of SM to explain these\nobserved deviations in LFU, lead to new kind of interactions so-called\nnon-standard interaction (NSI) between the elementary particles. In this paper,\nwe consider a model with an additional $Z'$ boson (which is quite successful in\nexplaining the observed LFU anomalies) and analyze its effect in the lepton\nflavour violating (LFV) $B_d\\to \\tau^\\pm e^\\mp$ decay modes. From the present\nupper bound of the $B_d\\to \\tau^\\pm e^\\mp$ branching ratio, we obtain the\nconstraints on the new physics parameters, which are related to the\ncorresponding NSI parameters in the neutrino sector by $SU(2)_L$ symmetry.\nThese new parameters are expected to have potential implications in the\nneutrino oscillation studies and in this work we investigate the possibility of\nobserving the effects of these interactions in the currently running and\nupcoming long-baseline experiments, i.e., NOvA and DUNE respectively.\n", "  We examine the dynamics of chiral states of chiral molecules with high\ntunneling rates in dilute and condensed phases in the context of time-dependent\nperturbation theory. The chiral molecule is effectively described by an\nasymmetric double-well potential, whose asymmetry is a measure of chiral\ninteractions. The dilute and condensed phases are conjointly described by a\ncollection of harmonic oscillators but respectively with temperature-dependent\nsub-ohmic and temperature-independent ohmic spectral densities. We examine our\nmethod quantitatively by applying the dynamics to isotopic ammonia molecule,\nNHDT, in an inert background gas (as the dilute phase) and in water (as the\ncondensed phase). As different spectral densities implies, the extension of the\ndynamics from the dilute phase to the condensed phase is not trivial. While the\ndynamics in the dilute phase leads to racemization, the chiral interactions in\nthe condensed phase induce the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, contrary to the\ncondensed phase, the short-time dynamics in the dilute phase is sensitive to\nthe initial state of the chiral molecule and to the strength of the coupling\nbetween the molecule and the environment.\n", "  First-passage time problems are ubiquitous across many fields of study\nincluding transport processes in semiconductors and biological synapses,\nevolutionary game theory and percolation. Despite their prominence,\nfirst-passage time calculations have proven to be particularly challenging.\nAnalytical results to date have often been obtained under strong conditions,\nleaving most of the exploration of first-passage time problems to direct\nnumerical computations. Here we present an analytical approach that allows the\nderivation of first-passage time distributions for the wide class of\nnon-differentiable Gaussian processes. We demonstrate that the concept of sign\nchanges naturally generalises the common practice of counting crossings to\ndetermine first-passage events. Our method works across a wide range of\ntime-dependent boundaries and noise strengths thus alleviating common hurdles\nin first-passage time calculations.\n", "  In hydrodynamic turbulence, it is well established that the length of the\ndissipation scale depends on the energy cascade rate, i.e., the larger the\nenergy input rate per unit mass, the more the turbulent fluctuations need to be\ndriven to increasingly smaller scales to dissipate the larger energy flux.\nObservations of magnetic spectral energy densities indicate that this intuitive\npicture is not valid in solar wind turbulence. Dissipation seems to set in at\nthe same length scale for different solar wind conditions independently of the\nenergy flux. To investigate this difference in more detail, we present an\nanalytic dissipation model for solar wind turbulence at electron scales, which\nwe compare with observed spectral densities. Our model combines the energy\ntransport from large to small scales and collisionless damping, which removes\nenergy from the magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic regime. We assume\nwave-particle interactions of kinetic Alfv\\'{e}n waves (KAW) to be the main\ndamping process. Wave frequencies and damping rates of KAW are obtained from\nthe hot plasma dispersion relation. Our model assumes a critically balanced\nturbulence, where larger energy cascade rates excite larger parallel\nwavenumbers for a certain perpendicular wavenumber. If the dissipation is\nadditionally wave driven such that the dissipation rate is proportional to the\nparallel wavenumber - as with KAW - then an increase of the energy cascade rate\nis counter-balanced by an increased dissipation rate for the same perpendicular\nwavenumber leading to a dissipation length independent of the energy cascade\nrate.\n", "  We extend the dynamical systems analysis of Scalar-Fluid interacting dark\nenergy models performed in C. G. Boehmer et al, Phys. Rev. D 91, 123002 (2015),\nby considering scalar field potentials beyond the exponential type. The\nproperties and stability of critical points are examined using a combination of\nlinear analysis, computational methods and advanced mathematical techniques,\nsuch as centre manifold theory. We show that the interesting results obtained\nwith an exponential potential can generally be recovered also for more\ncomplicated scalar field potentials. In particular, employing power-law and\nhyperbolic potentials as examples, we find late time accelerated attractors,\ntransitions from dark matter to dark energy domination with specific\ndistinguishing features, and accelerated scaling solutions capable of solving\nthe cosmic coincidence problem.\n", "  In the background of a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime with zero spatial\ncurvature, we consider interacting scenarios between two barotropic fluids, one\nis the pressureless dark matter (DM) and the other one is dark energy (DE), in\nwhich the equation of state (EoS) in DE is either constant or time dependent.\nIn particular, for constant EoS in DE, we show that the evolution equations for\nboth fluids can be analytically solved. For all these scenarios, the model\nparameters have been constrained using the current astronomical observations\nfrom Type Ia Supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic\noscillations distance measurements. Our analysis shows that both for constant\nand variable EoS in DE, a very small but nonzero interaction in the dark sector\nis favored while the EoS in DE can predict a slight phantom nature, i.e. the\nEoS in DE can cross the phantom divide line `$-1$'. On the other hand, although\nthe models with variable EoS describe the observations better, but the Akaike\nInformation Criterion supports models with minimal number of parameters.\nHowever, it is found that all the models are very close to the $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology.\n", "  Intrinsic flow in plasma physics is a long-standing puzzle, since it is\ndifficult to understand its origin without contradiction to momentum\nconservation in conventional wisdom. It is proved that the electromagnetic\nturbulent acceleration as a candidate for intrinsic parallel flow generation\ndriven by pressure gradient along the total magnetic field line does not\ncontradict momentum conservation. The conserved quantity corresponding to axial\nsymmetry is the total gyrocenter parallel canonical momentum carried by both\nspecies or the total gyrocenter parallel momentum including the ion gyrocenter\nkinematic momentum and electromagnetic fields momentum, but not the ion\nkinematic momentum, or even the ion parallel flow. A conservation equation of\ntotal parallel momentum including the ion particles' kinematic momentum and\nelectromagnetic fields momentum is also presented.\n", "  Determining wavelength-dependent exoplanet radii measurements is an excellent\nway to probe the composition of exoplanet atmospheres. In light of this, Borsa\net al. (2016) sought to develop a technique to obtain such measurements by\ncomparing ground-based transmission spectra to the expected brightness\nvariations during an exoplanet transit. However, we demonstrate herein that\nthis is not possible due to the transit light curve normalisation necessary to\nremove the effects of the Earth's atmosphere on the ground-based observations.\nThis is because the recoverable exoplanet radius is set by the planet-to-star\nradius ratio within the transit light curve; we demonstrate this both\nanalytically and with simulated planet transits, as well as through a\nreanalysis of the HD 189733b data.\n", "  The work investigates the coupling between ion-acoustic waves and neutrino\nflavor oscillations in a non-relativistic electron-ion plasma under the\ninfluence of a mixed neutrino beam. Neutrino oscillations are mediated by the\nflavor polarization vector dynamics in a material medium. The linear dispersion\nrelation around homogeneous static equilibria is developed. When resonant with\nthe ion-acoustic mode, the neutrino flavor oscillations can transfer energy to\nthe plasma exciting a new fast unstable mode in extreme astrophysical\nscenarios. The growth rate and the unstable wavelengths are determined in\ntypical type II supernovae parameters. The predictions can be useful for a new\nindirect probe on neutrino oscillations in nature.\n", "  The properties of a quantum dissipative scalar field is analyzed by\nCaldeira-Leggett model in strong-coupling regime. The Lagrangian of the total\nsystem is canonically quantized and the full Hamiltonian is diagonalized using\nFano technique. A mode-dependent probability density is introduced. The steady\nstate energy and correlation functions at finite temperature are calculated in\nterms of the probability density.\n", "  Several recent publications claim that the proton charge {\\em rms}-radius\nresulting from the analysis of electron scattering data restricted to {\\em low}\nmomentum transfer agrees with the radius determined from muonic hydrogen, in\ncontrast to the radius resulting from analyses of the full (e,e) data set which\nis $0.04fm$ larger. Here we show why these publications erroneously arrive at\nthe low radii.\n", "  Multi-nucleon transfer in $^{86}$Kr+$^{64}$Ni at an incident energy of 25\nMeV/nucleon is for the first time investigated with a microscopic dynamics\nmodel: improved quantum molecular dynamics (ImQMD) model. The measured isotope\ndistributions are reasonably well reproduced by using the ImQMD model together\nwith a statistical code (GEMINI) for describing the secondary decay of\nfragments. The reaction mechanism is explored with the microscopic dynamics\nsimulations from central to peripheral collisions. In central collisions there\nexists a strong competition among fusion, deep-inelastic scattering and\nmulti-fragmentation at such an incident energy. In semi-peripheral collisions,\nbinary scattering together with nucleon transfer is dominant, and the\nprobability of elastic+inelastic scattering events increases rapidly with\nimpact parameter in peripheral collisions and approaches to one when $b>14$ fm.\nThe mass-TKE distribution in central collisions due to the competition is quite\ndifferent from those in peripheral collisions and the distribution of total\nkinetic energy loss (TKEL) for binary events with nucleon transfer is much more\nbroader than those without transfer.\n", "  We consider the time dependent dispersion properties of overdamped tracer\nparticles diffusing in a one dimensional periodic potential under the influence\nof an additional constant tilting force $F$. The system is studied in the\nregion where the force is close to the critical value $F_c$ at which the\nbarriers separating neighboring potential wells disappear. We show that, when\n$F$ crosses the critical value, the shape of the Mean-Square Displacement (MSD)\ncurves is strongly modified. We identify a diffusive regime at intermediate\ntime scales, with an effective diffusion coefficient which is much larger than\nthe late time diffusion coefficient for $F>F_c$, whereas for $F<F_c$ the late\ntime and intermediate time diffusive regimes are indistinguishable. Explicit\nasymptotic regimes for the MSD curves are identified at all time scales.\n", "  In classical and quantum frustrated magnets the interactions in combination\nwith the lattice structure impede the spins to order in optimal configurations\nat zero temperature. The theoretical interest in their classical realisations\nhas been boosted by the artificial manufacture of materials with these\nproperties, that are of flexible design. This note summarises work on the use\nof vertex models to study bidimensional spin-ices samples, done in\ncollaboration with R. A. Borzi, M. V. Ferreyra, L. Foini, G. Gonnella, S. A.\nGrigera, P. Guruciaga, D. Levis, A. Pelizzola and M. Tarzia, in recent years.\nIt is an invited contribution to a J. Stat. Phys. special issue dedicated to\nthe memory of Leo P. Kadanoff.\n", "  It is important to study the fine structures of solar filaments with\nhigh-resolution observations since it can help us understand the magnetic and\nthermal structures of the filaments and their dynamics. In this paper, we study\na newly-formed filament located inside the active region NOAA 11762, which was\nobserved by the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory\n(BBSO) from 16:40:19 UT to 17:07:58 UT on 2013 June 5. As revealed by the\nH$\\alpha$ filtergrams, cool material is seen to be injected into the filament\nspine with a speed of 5--10 km s$^{-1}$. At the source of the injection,\nbrightenings are identified in the chromosphere, which is accompanied by\nmagnetic cancellation in the photosphere, implying the importance of magnetic\nreconnection in replenishing the filament with plasmas from the lower\natmosphere. Counter-streamings are detected near one endpoint of the filament,\nwith the plane-of-the-sky speed being 7--9 km s$^{-1}$ in the H$\\alpha$\nred-wing filtergrams and 9--25 km s$^{-1}$ in the blue-wing filtergrams. The\nobservations are indicative of that this active region filament is supported by\na sheared arcade without magnetic dips, and the counter-streamings are due to\nunidirectional flows with alternative directions, rather than due to the\nlongitudinal oscillations of filament threads as in many other filaments.\n", "  Early attempts to apply asteroseismology to study the Galaxy have already\nshown unexpected discrepancies for the mass distribution of stars between the\nGalactic models and the data; a result that is still unexplained. Here, we\nrevisit the analysis of the asteroseismic sample of dwarf and subgiant stars\nobserved by Kepler and investigate in detail the possible causes for the\nreported discrepancy. We investigate two models of the Milky Way based on\nstellar population synthesis, Galaxia and TRILEGAL. In agreement with previous\nresults, we find that TRILEGAL predicts more massive stars compared to Galaxia,\nand that TRILEGAL predicts too many blue stars compared to 2MASS observations.\nBoth models fail to match the distribution of the stellar sample in $(\\log\ng,T_{\\rm eff})$ space, pointing to inaccuracies in the models and/or the\nassumed selection function. When corrected for this mismatch in $(\\log g,T_{\\rm\neff})$ space, the mass distribution calculated by Galaxia is broader and the\nmean is shifted toward lower masses compared to that of the observed stars.\nThis behaviour is similar to what has been reported for the Kepler red giant\nsample. The shift between the mass distributions is equivalent to a change of\n2\\% in $\\nu_{\\rm max}$, which is within the current uncertainty in the\n$\\nu_{\\rm max}$ scaling relation. Applying corrections to the $\\Delta \\nu$\nscaling relation predicted by the stellar models makes the observed mass\ndistribution significantly narrower, but there is no change to the mean.\n", "  Recent results have suggested that there is tension between the Gaia DR1 TGAS\ndistances and the distances obtained using luminosities determined by eclipsing\nbinaries or asteroseismology on red giant stars. We use the $K_s$-band\nluminosities of red clump stars, identified and characterized by\nasteroseismology, to make independent distance estimates. Our results suggest\nthat Gaia TGAS distances contain a systematic error that decreases with\nincreasing distance. We propose a correction to mitigate this offset as a\nfunction of parallax that is valid for the Kepler field and values of parallax\nthat are less than ${\\sim} 1.6 \\rm \\, mas$. For parallaxes greater than this we\nfind agreement with previously published values. We note that the TGAS\ndistances to the red clump stars of the open cluster M67 show a high level of\ndisagreement that is difficult to correct for.\n", "  Recent high-resolution observations reveal that subarcsecond bright dots\n(BDs) with sub-minute lifetimes appears ubiquitously in the transition region\n(TR) above sunspot penumbra. The presence of penumbral micro-jets (PMJs) in the\nchromosphere have also been reported earlier. It was proposed that both the\nPMJs and BDs are formed due to magnetic reconnection process and may play an\nimportant role in heating of the penumbra. Using simultaneous observation of\nthe chromosphere from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) aboard Hinode and the\nTR from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), we study the dynamics\nof BDs and their relation with PMJs. We find two types of BDs, one which is\nrelated to PMJs and the others which do not show any visible dynamics in the\nSOT Ca II H images. From a statistical analysis we show that these two types\nhave different properties. The BDs which are related to PMJs always appear at\nthe top of the PMJs, the vast majority of which show inward motion and\noriginate before the generation of the PMJs. These results may indicate that\nthe reconnection occurs at the lower coronal/TR height and initiates PMJs at\nthe chromosphere. This formation mechanism is in contrast with the currently\nbelieved formation of PMJs by reconnection in the (upper) photosphere between\ndifferently inclined fields.\n", "  The art of quantum algorithm design is highly nontrivial. Grover's search\nalgorithm constitutes a masterpiece of quantum computational software. In this\narticle, we use methods of geometric algebra (GA) and information geometry (IG)\nto enhance the algebraic efficiency and the geometrical significance of the\ndigital and analog representations of Grover's algorithm, respectively.\nSpecifically, GA is used to describe the Grover iterate and the discretized\niterative procedure that exploits quantum interference to amplify the\nprobability amplitude of the target-state before measuring the query register.\nThe transition from digital to analog descriptions occurs via Stone's theorem\nwhich relates the (unitary) Grover iterate to a suitable (Hermitian)\nHamiltonian that controls Schrodinger's quantum mechanical evolution of a\nquantum state towards the target state. Once the discrete-to-continuos\ntransition is completed, IG is used to interpret Grover's iterative procedure\nas a geodesic path on the manifold of the parametric density operators of pure\nquantum states constructed from the continuous approximation of the parametric\nquantum output state in Grover's algorithm. Finally, we discuss the\ndissipationless nature of quantum computing, recover the quadratic speedup\nrelation, and identify the superfluity of the Walsh-Hadamard operation from an\nIG perspective with emphasis on statistical mechanical considerations.\n", "  Most of the diffuse Galactic GeV gamma-ray emission is produced via\ncollisions of cosmic ray (CR) protons with ISM protons. As such the observed\nspectra of the gamma-rays and the CRs should be strongly linked. Recent\nobservations of Fermi-LAT exhibit a hardening of the gamma-ray spectrum at\naround a hundred GeV, between the Sagittarius and Carina tangents, and a\nfurther hardening at a few degrees above and below the Galactic plane. However,\nstandard CR propagation models that assume a time independent source\ndistribution and a location independent diffusion cannot give rise to a\nspatially dependent CR (and hence gamma-ray) spectral slopes. Here we consider\na dynamic spiral arm model in which the distribution of CR sources is\nconcentrated in the (dynamic) spiral arms, and we study the effects of this\nmodel on the $\\pi^0$-decay produced gamma-ray spectra. Within this model, near\nthe Galactic arms the observed gamma-ray spectral slope is not trivially\nrelated to the CR injection spectrum and energy dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient. We find unique signatures that agree with the Fermi-LAT\nobservations. This model also provides a physical explanation for the\ndifference between the local CR spectral slope and the CR slope inferred from\nthe average gamma-ray spectrum.\n", "  We study the frustrated ferromagnetic spin-1 chains, where the ferromagnetic\nnearest-neighbor coupling competes with the antiferromagnetic\nnext-nearest-neighbor coupling. We use the density matrix renormalization group\nto obtain the ground states. Through the analysis of spin-spin correlations we\nidentify the double Haldane phase as well as the ferromagnetic phase. It is\nshown that the ferromagnetic coupling leads to incommensurate correlations in\nthe double Haldane phase. Such short-range correlations transform continuously\ninto the ferromagnetic instability at the transition to the ferromagnetic\nphase. We also compare the results with the spin-1/2 and classical spin\nsystems, and discuss the string orders in the system.\n", "  In an XMM-Newton observation of the binary SDSS J121209.31+013627.7,\nconsisting of a white dwarf and an L dwarf, we detect X-ray orbital modulation\nas proof of accretion from the substellar companion onto the magnetic white\ndwarf. We constrain the system geometry (inclination as well as magnetic and\npole-cap angle) through modelling of the X-ray light curve, and we derive a\nmass accretion rate of 3.2 10^(-14) M_sun/yr from the X-ray luminosity (~ 3\n10^(29) erg/s). From X-ray studies of L dwarfs, a possible wind driven from a\nhypothesized corona on the substellar donor is orders of magnitude too weak to\nexplain the observed accretion rate, while the radius of the L dwarf is\ncomparable to its Roche lobe (0.1 R_sun), making Roche-lobe overflow the likely\naccretion mechanism in this system.\n", "  We present the discovery of a 360 AU separation T3 companion to the tight\n(3.1 AU) M4.5+M6.5 binary 2MASS J02132062+3648506. This companion was\nidentified using Pan-STARRS1 data and, despite its relative proximity to the\nSun (22.2$_{-4.0}^{+6.4}$ pc; Pan-STARRS1 parallax) and brightness ($J$=15.3),\nappears to have been missed by previous studies due to its position near a\ndiffraction spike in 2MASS. The close M~dwarf binary has active X-ray and\nH$\\alpha$ emission and shows evidence for UV flares. The binary's weak {\\it\nGALEX} UV emission and strong Na I 8200\\AA Na absorption leads us to an age\nrange of $\\sim$1-10Gyr. Applying this age range to evolutionary models implies\nthe wide companion has a mass of 0.063$\\pm$0.009\\,$M_{\\odot}$. 2MASS J0213+3648\nC provides a relatively old benchmark close to the L/T transition and acts as a\nkey, older comparison to the much younger early-T companions HN~Peg~B and\nGU~Psc~b.\n", "  We report Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the 1.5 GHz radio\ncontinuum emission of the {\\it z=6.326} quasar SDSS J010013.02+280225.8\n(hereafter J0100+2802). J0100+2802 is, by far the most optically luminous, and\nradio-quiet quasar with the most massive black hole known at z>6. The VLBA\nobservations have a synthesized beam size of 12.10 mas $\\times$5.36 mas (FWHM),\nand detected the radio continuum emission from this object with a peak surface\nbrightness of 64.6+/-9.0 micro-Jy/beam and a total flux density of 88+/-19\nmicro-Jy. The position of the radio peak is consistent with that from SDSS in\nthe optical and Chandra in the X-ray. The radio source is marginally resolved\nby the VLBA observations. A 2-D Gaussian fit to the image constrains the source\nsize to $\\rm (7.1+/-3.5) mas x (3.1+/-1.7) mas. This corresponds to a physical\nscale of (40+/-20) pc x (18+/-10) pc. We estimate the intrinsic brightness\ntemperature of the VLBA source to be T_{B}=(1.6 +/- 1.2) x 10^{7} K. This is\nsignificantly higher than the maximum value in normal star forming galaxies,\nindicating an AGN origin for the radio continuum emission. However, it is also\nsignificantly lower than the brightness temperatures found in highest redshift\nradio-loud quasars. J0100+2802 provides a unique example to study the radio\nactivity in optically luminous and radio quiet active galactic nuclei in the\nearly universe. Further observations at multiple radio frequencies will\naccurately measure the spectral index and address the dominant radiation\nmechanism of the radio emission.\n", "  A highly integrated, high performance, and re-configurable device, which is\ndesigned for the Nitrogen-Vacancy center based quantum applications, is\nreported. The digital compartment of the device is fully implemented in a\nField-Programmable-Gate- Array. The digital compartment is designed to manage\nthe multi-function digital waveform generation and the\nTime-to-Digital-Convertors. The device provides two\nArbitrary-Waveform-Generator channels which operate at a 1 Gsps sampling rate\nwith a maximum bandwidth of 500 MHz. There are twelve pulse channels integrated\nin the device with a 50 ps time resolution in both duration and delay. The\npulse channels operate with the 3.3 V Transistor-Transistor logic. The\nFPGA-based Timeto- Digital-Convertor provides a 23-ps time measurement\nprecision. A data accumulation module, which can record the input count rate\nand the distributions of the time measurement, is also available. A\nDigital-to-Analog-Convertor board is implemented as the analog compartment,\nwhich converts the digital waveforms to analog signals with 500 MHz\nlow-pass-filters. All the input and output channels of the device are equipped\nwith 50 Sub-Miniature version A termination. The hardware design is modularized\nthus it can be easily upgraded with compatible components. The device is\nsuitable to be applied in the quantum technologies based on the N-V centers, as\nwell as in other quantum solid state systems, such as quantum dots, phosphorus\ndoped in silicon and defect spins in silicon carbide.\n", "  The ATLAS experiment will undergo around the year 2025 a replacement of the\ntracker system in view of the high luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) with a\nnew 5-layer pixel system. Thin planar pixel sensors are promising candidates to\ninstrument the innermost region of the new pixel system, thanks to the reduced\ncontribution to the material budget and their high charge collection efficiency\nafter irradiation. The sensors of 50-150 $\\mu$m thickness, interconnected to\nFE-I4 read-out chips, have been characterized with radioactive sources and beam\ntests. In particular active edge sensors have been investigated. The\nperformance of two different versions of edge designs are compared: the first\nwith a bias ring, and the second one where only a floating guard ring has been\nimplemented. The hit efficiency at the edge has also been studied after\nirradiation at a fluence of $10^{15}$ \\neqcm. Highly segmented sensors will\nrepresent a challenge for the tracking in the forward region of the pixel\nsystem at HL-LHC. In order to reproduce the performance of 50x50 $\\mu$m$^2$\npixels at high pseudo-rapidity values, FE-I4 compatible planar pixel sensors\nhave been studied before and after irradiation in beam tests at high incidence\nangles with respect to the short pixel direction. Results on the hit efficiency\nin this configuration are discussed for different sensor thicknesses.\n", "  We present near-infrared (0.8-1.8 $\\mu$m) spectra of 105 bright (${m_{J}}$\n$<$ 10) stars observed with the low resolution spectrometer on the rocket-borne\nCosmic Infrared Background Experiment (CIBER). As our observations are\nperformed above the earth's atmosphere, our spectra are free from telluric\ncontamination, which makes them a unique resource for near-infrared spectral\ncalibration. Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry information is used\nto identify cross-matched stars after reduction and extraction of the spectra.\nWe identify the spectral types of the observed stars by comparing them with\nspectral templates from the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) library. All the\nobserved spectra are consistent with late F to M stellar spectral types, and we\nidentify various infrared absorption lines.\n", "  Ferroelectric $\\pi$-stacked molecular wires for solar cell applications are\ntheoretically designed, in such a way that their energy gaps fall within\nvisible and infrared range of the Sun radiation. Band engineering is tailored\nby a modification of the number of the aromatic rings and via a choice of the\nnumber and kind of the dipole groups. The electronic structures of molecular\nwires and the chemical character of the electron-hole pair are analyzed within\nthe density functional theory (DFT) framework and the hybrid DFT approach by\nmeans of the B3LYP scheme. Moreover, it is found that one of the advantageous\nproperties of these systems - namely the separate-path electron and hole\ntransport - reported earlier, still holds for the larger molecules, due to the\ndipole selection rules for the electron-hole generation, which do not allow the\nlowest optical transitions between the states localized at the same part of the\nmolecule.\n", "  We present new optical broad-band (UBVRI) aperture polarimetric observations\nof 53 post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars selected to exhibit a large\nnear-infrared excess. 24 out of the 53 stars (45% of our sample) are presented\nfor the first time. A statistical analysis shows four distinctive groups of\npolarized post-AGB stars: unpolarized or very lowly polarized (degree of\npolarization or DoP < 1%), lowly polarized (1% < DoP < 4%), moderately\npolarized (4% < DoP < 8%) and highly polarized (DoP > 8%). 23 out of the 53\n(66%) belong to the first group, 10 (19%) to the second, five (9%) to the third\nand only three (6%) to the last group.\n  Approximately, 34% of our sample was found to be unpolarized objects, which\nis close to the percentage of round planetary nebulae. On average, the low and\nmoderate groups show a wavelength-dependent polarization that increases towards\nshorter wavelength, implying an intrinsic origin of the polarization, which\nsignifies a Rayleigh-like scattering spectrum typical for non-symmetrical\nenvelopes composed principally of small dust grains. The moderately polarized\nstars exhibit higher K-W3 and W1-W3 colour indices compared with the group of\nlowly polarized stars suggesting a possible relation between DoP and mass-loss\nrate. Moreover, they are found to be systematically colder (redder in B-V),\nwhich may be associated with the condensation process close to these stars that\nresults in higher degree of polarization. We also provide evidence that\nmultiple scattering in optically thin polar outflows is the mechanism that\ngives high DoP in post-AGB stars with a bipolar or multi-polar envelopes.\n", "  In the BHR71 region, two low-mass protostars drive two distinguishable\noutflows. They constitute an ideal laboratory to investigate the effects of\nshock chemistry and the mechanisms that led to their formation. We aim to\ndefine the morphology of the warm gas component of the BHR 71 outflow and at\nmodelling its shocked component. We present the first far infrared Herschel\nimages of the BHR71 outflow in the CO(14-13), H$_2$O (2$_{21}$-1$_{10}$),\nH$_2$O (2$_{12}$-1$_{01}$) and [OI] 145 $\\mu$m, lines, revealing the presence\nof several knots of warm, shocked gas associated with fast outflowing gas. In\ntwo of these knots we performed a detailed study of the physical conditions by\ncomparing a large set of transitions from several molecules to a grid of shock\nmodels. Herschel lines ratios in the outflow knots are quite similar, showing\nthat the excitation conditions of the fast moving gas do not change\nsignificantly within the first $\\sim$ 0.068 pc of the outflow, apart at the\nextremity of the southern blue-shifted lobe that is expanding outside the\nmolecular cloud. Rotational diagram, spectral line profile and LVG analysis of\nthe CO lines in knot A show the presence of two gas components: one extended,\ncold ($T\\sim$80 K) and dense ($n$(H$_2$) = 3$\\times$10$^5$-4$\\times$10$^6$\ncm$^{-3}$) and another compact (18 arcsec), warm ($T$ = 1700-2200 K) with\nslightly lower density ($n$(H$_2$) = (2-6)$\\times$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$). In the two\nbrightest knots (where we performed shock modelling) we found that H$_2$ and CO\nare well fitted with non-stationary (young) shocks. These models, however,\nsignificantly underestimate the observed fluxes of [OI] and OH lines, but are\nnot too far off those of H$_2$O, calling for an additional, possibly\ndissociative, J-type shock component. Our modelling indirectly suggests that an\nadditional shock component exists, possibly a remnant of the primary jet\n", "  We investigate how star formation efficiency can be significantly decreased\nby the removal of a molecular cloud's envelope by feedback from an external\nsource. Feedback from star formation has difficulties halting the process in\ndense gas but can easily remove the less dense and warmer envelopes where star\nformation does not occur. However, the envelopes can play an important role\nkeeping their host clouds bound by deepening the gravitational potential and\nproviding a constraining pressure boundary. We use numerical simulations to\nshow that removal of the cloud envelopes results in all cases in a fall in the\nstar formation efficiency (SFE). At 1.38 free-fall times our 4 pc cloud\nsimulation experienced a drop in the SFE from 16 to six percent, while our 5 pc\ncloud fell from 27 to 16 per cent. At the same time, our 3 pc cloud (the least\nbound) fell from an SFE of 5.67 per cent to zero when the envelope was lost.\nThe star formation efficiency per free-fall time varied from zero to $\\approx$\n0.25 according to $\\alpha$, defined to be the ratio of the kinetic plus thermal\nto gravitational energy, and irrespective of the absolute star forming mass\navailable. Furthermore the fall in SFE associated with the loss of the envelope\nis found to even occur at later times. We conclude that the SFE will always\nfall should a star forming cloud lose its envelope due to stellar feedback,\nwith less bound clouds suffering the greatest decrease.\n", "  We introduce CRASH-AMR, a new version of the cosmological Radiative Transfer\n(RT) code CRASH, enabled to use refined grids. This new feature allows us to\nattain higher resolution in our RT simulations and thus to describe more\naccurately ionisation and temperature patterns in high density regions. We have\ntested CRASH-AMR by simulating the evolution of an ionised region produced by a\nsingle source embedded in gas at constant density, as well as by a more\nrealistic configuration of multiple sources in an inhomogeneous density field.\nWhile we find an excellent agreement with the previous version of CRASH when\nthe AMR feature is disabled, showing that no numerical artifact has been\nintroduced in CRASH-AMR, when additional refinement levels are used the code\ncan simulate more accurately the physics of ionised gas in high density\nregions. This result has been attained at no computational loss, as RT\nsimulations on AMR grids with maximum resolution equivalent to that of a\nuniform cartesian grid can be run with a gain of up to 60% in computational\ntime.\n", "  The thermal and electrical transport properties of single-crystalline\nLaBe$_{13}$ have been investigated by specific-heat ($C$) and\nelectrical-resistivity ($\\rho$) measurements. The specific-heat measurements in\na wide temperature range revealed the presence of a hump anomaly near 40 K in\nthe $C$($T$)/$T$ curve, indicating that LaBe$_{13}$ has a low-energy\nEinstein-like-phonon mode with a characteristic temperature of $\\sim$ 177 K. In\naddition, a superconducting transition was observed in the $\\rho$ measurements\nat the transition temperature of 0.53 K, which is higher than the value of 0.27\nK reported previously by Bonville et al. Furthermore, an unusual $T^3$\ndependence was found in $\\rho$($T$) below $\\sim$ 50 K, in contrast to the\nbehavior expected from the electron--electron scattering or the electron--Debye\nphonon scattering.\n", "  The evolution of main sequence binaries resided in the galactic centre is\ninfluenced a lot by the central super massive black hole (SMBH). Due to this\nperturbation, the stars in a dense environment are likely to experience mergers\nor collisions through secular or non-secular interactions. In this work, we\nstudy the dynamics of the stellar binaries at galactic center, perturbed by\nanother distant SMBH. Geometrically, such a four-body system is supposed to be\ndecomposed into the inner triple (SMBH-star-star) and the outer triple\n(SMBH-stellar binary-SMBH). We survey the parameter space and determine the\ncriteria analytically for the stellar mergers and the tidal disruption events\n(TDEs). For a relative distant and equal masses SMBH binary, the stars have\nmore opportunities to merge as a result from the Lidov-Kozai(LK) oscillations\nin the inner triple. With a sample of tight stellar binaries, our numerical\nexperiments reveal that a significant fraction of the binaries, ~70 per cent,\nexperience merger eventually. Whereas the majority of the stellar TDEs are\nlikely to occur at a close periapses to the SMBH, induced by the outer Kozai\neffect. The tidal disruptions are found numerically as many as ~10 per cent for\na close SMBH binary that is enhanced significantly than the one without the\nexternal SMBH. These effects require the outer perturber to have an inclined\norbit (>=40 degree) relatively to the inner orbital plane and may lead to a\nburst of the extremely astronomical events associated with the detection of the\nSMBH binary.\n", "  We present an investigation of the effect of the interaction between a thin\npolystyrene film and its supporting substrate on its glass transition\ntemperature (Tg). We modulate this interaction by depositing the film on\nend-tethered polystyrene grafted layers of controlled molecular parameters. By\ncomparing Tg measurements versus film thickness for films deposited on\ndifferent grafted layers and films deposited directly on a silicon substrate,\nwe can conclude that there is no important effect of the film-subtrate\ninteraction. Our interpretation of these results is that local orientation and\ndynamic effects substantial enough to influence Tg cannot readily be obtained\nby grafting prepolymerized chains to a surface, due to intrinsic limitation of\nthe surface grafting density.\n", "  We derive a new relation between the metallicity of Seyfert 2 Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGNs) and the intensity of the narrow emission-lines ratio\n$N2O2$=log([N II]$\\lambda$6584/[O II]$\\lambda$3727). The calibration of this\nrelation was performed determining the metallicity ($Z$) of a sample of 58 AGNs\nthrough a diagram containing the observational data and the results of a grid\nof photoionization models obtained with the Cloudy code. We find the new\n$Z/Z_\\odot$-$N2O2$ relation using the obtained metallicity values and the\ncorresponding observational emission line intensities for each object of the\nsample. Estimations derived through the use of this new calibration indicate\nthat narrow line regions of Seyfert 2 galaxies exhibit a large range of\nmetallicities ($0.3 \\: < \\: Z/Z_{\\odot} \\: < \\:2.0$), with a median value $Z\n\\approx Z_{\\odot}$. Regarding the possible existence of correlations between\nthe luminosity $L(\\rm H\\beta$), the electron density, and the color excess\nE(B$-$V) with the metallicity in this kind of objects, we do not find\ncorrelations between them.\n", "  We confirm two new local massive relic galaxies, i.e. untouched survivors of\nthe early universe massive population: Mrk1216 and PGC032873. Both show early\nand peaked formation events within very short timescales (<1 Gyr) and thus old\nmean mass-weighted ages (~13 Gyr). Their star formation histories remain\nvirtually unchanged out to several effective radii, even when considering the\nsteeper IMF values inferred out to ~3 effective radii. Their morphologies,\nkinematics and density profiles are like those found in the z>2 massive\npopulation, setting them apart of the typical z~0 massive early-type galaxies.\nWe find that there seems to exist a \"degree of relic\" that is related on how\nfar into the path to become one of these typical z~0 massive galaxies the\ncompact relic has undergone. This path is partly dictated by the environment\nthe galaxy lives in. For galaxies in rich environments, such as the previously\nreported relic galaxy NGC1277, the most extreme properties (e.g. sizes, short\nformation timescales, larger super-massive black holes) are expected, while\nlower density environments will have galaxies with delayed and/or extended star\nformations, slightly larger sizes and not that extreme black hole masses. The\nconfirmation of 3 relic galaxies up to a distance of 106Mpc implies a lower\nlimit in the number density of these red nuggets in the local universe of\n6x10^{-7} Mpc^{3}, which is within the theoretical expectations.\n", "  Amongst O-type stars with detected magnetic fields, the fast rotator in the\nclose binary called Plaskett's star shows a variety of unusual properties.\nSince strong binary interactions are believed to have occurred in this system,\none may wonder about their potential role in generating magnetic fields. Stokes\nV spectra collected with the low-resolution FORS2 and high-resolution ESPaDOnS\nand Narval spectropolarimeters were therefore used to search for magnetic\nfields in 15 interacting or post-interaction massive binaries. No magnetic\nfield was detected in any of them, with 0G always being within 2sigma of the\nderived values. For 17 out of 25 stars in the systems observed at\nhigh-resolution, the 90% upper limit on the individual dipolar fields is below\nthe dipolar field strength of Plaskett's secondary; a similar result is found\nfor five out of six systems observed at low resolution. If our sample is\nconsidered to form a group of stars sharing similar magnetic properties, a\nglobal statistical analysis results in a stringent upper limit of ~200G on the\ndipolar field strength. Moreover, the magnetic incidence rate in the full\nsample of interacting or post-interaction systems (our targets + Plaskett's\nstar) is compatible with that measured from large surveys, showing that they\nare not significantly different from the general O-star population. These\nresults suggest that binary interactions play no systematic role in the\nmagnetism of such massive systems.\n", "  We report the first large, systematic study of the dynamics and energetics of\na representative sample of FRII radio galaxies with well-characterized\ngroup/cluster environments. We used X-ray inverse-Compton and radio synchrotron\nmeasurements to determine the internal radio-lobe conditions, and these were\ncompared with external pressures acting on the lobes, determined from\nmeasurements of the thermal X-ray emission of the group/cluster. Consistent\nwith previous work, we found that FRII radio lobes are typically\nelectron-dominated by a small factor relative to equipartition, and are\nover-pressured relative to the external medium in their outer parts. These\nresults suggest that there is typically no energetically significant proton\npopulation in the lobes of FRII radio galaxies (unlike for FRIs), and so for\nthis population, inverse-Compton modelling provides an accurate way of\nmeasuring total energy content and estimating jet power. We estimated the\ndistribution of Mach numbers for the population of expanding radio lobes,\nfinding that at least half of the radio galaxies are currently driving strong\nshocks into their group/cluster environments. Finally, we determined a jet\npower--radio luminosity relation for FRII radio galaxies based on our estimates\nof lobe internal energy and Mach number. The slope and normalisation of this\nrelation are consistent with theoretical expectations, given the departure from\nequipartition and environmental distribution for our sample.\n", "  We present the first results from our on-going Australia Telescope Compact\nArray survey of CO(1-0) in ALMA-identified submillimetre galaxies in the\nExtended Chandra Deep Field South. Strong detections of CO(1-0) emission from\ntwo submillimetre galaxies, ALESS 122.1 (z = 2.0232) and ALESS 67.1 (z =\n2.1230), were obtained. We estimate gas masses of M_gas ~ 1.3 \\times 10^{11}\nM_odot and M_gas ~ 1.0 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot for ALESS 122.1 and ALESS 67.1,\nrespectively, adopting alpha_CO = 1.0. Dynamical mass estimates from the\nkinematics of the CO(1-0) line yields M_dyn (sin i)^2 = 2.1 +- 1.1 \\times\n10^{11} M_odot and (3.2 +- 0.9) \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot for ALESS 122.1 and\nALESS 67.1, respectively. This is consistent with the total baryonic mass\nestimates of these two systems. We examine star formation efficiency using the\nL_FIR versus L'_CO(1-0) relation for samples of local ULIRGs and LIRGs, and\nmore distant star-forming galaxies, with CO(1-0) detections. We find some\nevidence of a shallower slope for ULIRGs and SMGs compared to less luminous\nsystems, but a larger sample is required for definite conclusions. We determine\ngas-to-dust ratios of 170 +- 30 and 140 +- 30 for ALESS 122.1 and ALESS 67.1,\nrespectively, showing ALESS 122.1 has an unusually large gas reservoir. By\ncombining the 38.1 GHz continuum detection of ALESS 122.1 with 1.4 and 5.5 GHz\ndata, we estimate that the free-free contribution to radio emission at 38.1 GHz\nis 34 +- 17 microJy, yielding a star formation rate (1400 +- 700 M_\\odot\nyr^{-1}) consistent with that from the infrared luminosity.\n", "  Understanding gas-grain chemistry of deuterium in star-forming objects may\nhelp to explain their history and present state. We aim to clarify how\nprocesses in ices affect the deuterium fractionation. In this regard, we\ninvestigate a Solar-mass protostellar envelope using an astrochemical\nrate-equation model that considers bulk-ice chem- istry. The results show a\ngeneral agreement with the molecular D/H abundance ratios observed in low-mass\nprotostars. The simultaneous processes of ice accumulation and rapid synthesis\nof HD on grain surfaces in the prestellar core hampers the deuteration of icy\nspecies. The observed very high D/H ratios exceeding 10 per cent, i.e., super-\ndeuteration, are reproduced for formaldehyde and dimethyl ether, but not for\nother species in the protostellar envelope phase. Chemical transformations in\nbulk ice lower D/H ratios of icy species and do not help explaining the\nsuper-deuteration. In the protostellar phase, the D2O/HDO abundance ratio was\ncalculated to be higher than the HDO/H2O ratio owing to gas-phase chemistry.\nSpecies that undergo evaporation from ices have high molecular D/H ratio and a\nhigh gas-phase abundance.\n", "  We present the results of multi-epoch VLBI observations of water masers in\nthe AGFL 5142 massive star forming region. We measure an annual parallax of\n$\\pi=0.467 \\pm 0.010$ mas, corresponding to a source distance of\n$D=2.14^{+0.051}_{-0.049}$ kpc. Proper motion and line of sight velocities\nreveal the 3D kinematics of masers in this region, most of which associate with\nmillimeter sources from the literature. In particular we find remarkable\nbipolar bowshocks expanding from the most massive member, AFGL 5142 MM1, which\nare used to investigate the physical properties of its protostellar jet. We\nattempt to link the known outflows in this region to possible progenitors by\nconsidering a precessing jet scenario and we discuss the episodic nature of\nejections in AFGL 5142.\n", "  We study the orbital properties of dark matter haloes by combining a spectral\nmethod and cosmological simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies. We compare the\ndynamics and orbits of individual dark matter particles from both hydrodynamic\nand $N$-body simulations, and find that the fraction of box, tube and resonant\norbits of the dark matter halo decreases significantly due to the effects of\nbaryons. In particular, the central region of the dark matter halo in the\nhydrodynamic simulation is dominated by regular, short-axis tube orbits, in\ncontrast to the chaotic, box and thin orbits dominant in the $N$-body run. This\nleads to a more spherical dark matter halo in the hydrodynamic run compared to\na prolate one as commonly seen in the $N$-body simulations. Furthermore, by\nusing a kernel based density estimator, we compare the coarse-grained\nphase-space densities of dark matter haloes in both simulations and find that\nit is lower by $\\sim0.5$ dex in the hydrodynamic run due to changes in the\nangular momentum distribution, which indicates that the baryonic process that\naffects the dark matter is irreversible. Our results imply that baryons play an\nimportant role in determining the shape, kinematics and phase-space density of\ndark matter haloes in galaxies.\n", "  Using the VLA, we recently detected a large number of protoplanetary disk\n(proplyd) candidates lying within a couple of light years of the massive black\nhole Sgr A*. The bow-shock appearance of proplyd candidates point toward the\nyoung massive stars located near Sgr A*. Similar to Orion proplyds, the strong\nUV radiation from the cluster of massive stars at the Galactic center is\nexpected to photoevaporate and photoionize the circumstellar disks around\nyoung, low mass stars, thus allowing detection of the ionized outflows from the\nphotoionized layer surrounding cool and dense gaseous disks. To confirm this\npicture, ALMA observations detect millimeter emission at 226 GHz from five\nproplyd candidates that had been detected at 44 and 34 GHz with the VLA. We\npresent the derived disk masses for four sources as a function of the assumed\ndust temperature. The mass of protoplanetary disks from cool dust emission\nranges between 0.03 -- 0.05 solar mass. These estimates are consistent with the\ndisk masses found in star forming sites in the Galaxy. These measurements show\nthe presence of on-going star formation with the implication that gas clouds\ncan survive near Sgr A* and the relative importance of high vs low-mass star\nformation in the strong tidal and radiation fields of the Galactic center.\n", "  We present an investigation into the magnetism of the Magellanic Bridge,\ncarried out through the observation of Faraday rotation towards 167 polarized\nextragalactic radio sources spanning the continuous frequency range of 1.3 -\n3.1 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Comparing measured Faraday\ndepth values of sources 'on' and 'off' the Bridge, we find that the two\npopulations are implicitly different. Assuming that this difference in\npopulations is due to a coherent field in the Magellanic Bridge, the observed\nFaraday depths indicate a median line-of-sight coherent magnetic-field strength\nof $B_{\\parallel}\\,\\simeq\\,0.3\\,\\mu$G directed uniformly away from us.\nMotivated by the varying magnitude of Faraday depths of sources on the Bridge,\nwe speculate that the coherent field observed in the Bridge is a consequence of\nthe coherent magnetic fields from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds being\npulled into the tidal feature. This is the first observation of a coherent\nmagnetic field spanning the entirety of the Magellanic Bridge and we argue that\nthis is a direct probe of a 'pan-Magellanic' field.\n", "  Measurements of the galaxy stellar mass function are crucial to understand\nthe formation of galaxies in the Universe. In a hierarchical clustering\nparadigm it is plausible that there is a connection between the properties of\ngalaxies and their environments. Evidence for environmental trends has been\nestablished in the local Universe. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) provides large\nphotometric datasets that enable further investigation of the assembly of mass.\nIn this study we use ~3.2 million galaxies from the (South Pole Telescope)\nSPT-East field in the DES science verification (SV) dataset. From grizY\nphotometry we derive galaxy stellar masses and absolute magnitudes, and\ndetermine the errors on these properties using Monte-Carlo simulations using\nthe full photometric redshift probability distributions. We compute galaxy\nenvironments using a fixed conical aperture for a range of scales. We construct\ngalaxy environment probability distribution functions and investigate the\ndependence of the environment errors on the aperture parameters. We compute the\nenvironment components of the galaxy stellar mass function for the redshift\nrange 0.15<z<1.05. For z<0.75 we find that the fraction of massive galaxies is\nlarger in high density environment than in low density environments. We show\nthat the low density and high density components converge with increasing\nredshift up to z~1.0 where the shapes of the mass function components are\nindistinguishable. Our study shows how high density structures build up around\nmassive galaxies through cosmic time.\n", "  The Fermi-LAT has detected more than 3000 sources in the GeV $\\gamma$-ray\nregime. The majority are extra-galactic and these sources are dominated by\nblazars. However, $\\sim28$ per cent of the sources in Fermi 3LAC are listed as\nblazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU). Increasing the number of classified\nFermi-LAT sources is important for improving our understanding of\nextra-galactic $\\gamma$-ray sources and can be used to search for new very high\nenergy sources. We report on the optical spectroscopy of seven selected\nunclassified BCU sources during 2014 and 2015 undertaken using the SAAO 1.9-m\nand Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Based on the identified spectral\nlines we have classified three of the sources as FSRQs and the remaining four\nas BL Lac objects, determining the redshift for four sources.\n", "  One of the most remarkable predictions of the general theory of relativity is\nthe existence of black-hole \"photonspheres\", compact null hypersurfaces on\nwhich massless particles can orbit the central black hole. We prove that every\nspherically-symmetric asymptotically flat black-hole spacetime is characterized\nby a photonsphere whose radius is bounded from above by $r_{\\gamma} \\leq 3M$,\nwhere $M$ is the total ADM mass of the black-hole spacetime. It is shown that\nhairy black-hole configurations conform to this upper bound. In particular, the\nnull circular geodesic of the (bald) Schwarzschild black-hole spacetime\nsaturates the bound.\n", "  High-redshift quasars are important to study galaxy and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) evolution, test cosmological models, and study supermassive black\nhole growth. Optical searches for high-redshift sources have been very\nsuccessful, but radio searches are not hampered by dust obscuration and should\nbe more effective at finding sources at even higher redshifts. Identifying\nhigh-redshift sources based on radio data is, however, not trivial. Here we\nreport on new multi-frequency Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)\nobservations of eight z>4.5 sources previously studied at high angular\nresolution with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Combining these\nobservations with those from the literature, we construct broad-band radio\nspectra of all 30 z>4.5 sources that have been observed with VLBI. In the\nsample we found flat, steep and peaked spectra in approximately equal\nproportions. Despite several selection effects, we conclude that the z>4.5 VLBI\n(and likely also non-VLBI) sources have diverse spectra and that only about a\nquarter of the sources in the sample have flat spectra. Previously, the\nmajority of high-redshift radio sources were identified based on their\nultra-steep spectra (USS). Recently a new method has been proposed to identify\nthese objects based on their megahertz-peaked spectra (MPS). Neither method\nwould have identified more than 18% of the high-redshift sources in this\nsample. More effective methods are necessary to reliably identify complete\nsamples of high-redshift sources based on radio data.\n", "  Bulk velocities exceed thermal velocities for sufficiently radiation pressure\ndominated accretion flows. We model the contribution of bulk Comptonization to\nthe soft X-ray excess in AGN. Bulk Comptonization is due to both turbulence and\nthe background shear. We calculate spectra both taking into account and not\ntaking into account bulk velocities using scaled data from radiation\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shearing box simulations. We characterize our results\nwith temperatures and optical depths to make contact with other warm\nComptonization models of the soft excess. We chose our fiducial mass, $M = 2\n\\times 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, and accretion rate, $L/L_{\\rm Edd} = 2.5$, to\ncorrespond to those fit to the super-Eddington narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)\nRE1034+396. The temperatures, optical depths, and Compton $y$ parameters we\nfind broadly agree with those fit to RE1034+396. The effect of bulk\nComptonization is to shift the Wien tail to higher energy and lower the gas\ntemperature, broadening the spectrum. Observations of the soft excess in NLS1s\ncan constrain the properties of disc turbulence if the bulk Comptonization\ncontribution can be separated out from contributions from other physical\neffects, such as reflection and absorption.\n", "  We review experimental and theoretical studies of coherent backscattering of\nnear resonant radiation from an ultracold atomic gas in the weak localization\nregime. Recent accomplishments in high resolution spectroscopy of atomic\nensembles based on the coherent backscattering process are discussed. We also\npropose several new experimental schemes for time-dependent spectroscopy as\napplied to multiple scattering in the regime of weak localization.\n", "  The successful measurements of the smallest neutrino mixing angle,\n$\\theta_{13}$, in 2012 by the short (1$\\sim$2 km) baseline reactor neutrinos\nexperiments, Daya Bay, RENO, and Double Chooz, have triggered a golden age of\nneutrino physics. The three experiments have been improving the $\\theta_{13}$\nmeasurements by accumulating event statistics and reducing systematic\nuncertainties. Now the $\\theta_{13}$ measurement is the most precise one among\nthe mixing angles in the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix. The most\nupdated $\\theta_{13}$ and $\\Delta m^{2}_{ee}$ measurements from these\nexperiments are reported here as well as the 5 MeV excess, absolute reactor\nneutrino flux and sterile neutrino search. The best final precision on the\nsin$^{2}2\\theta_{13}$ ($|\\Delta m^2_{ee}|$) measurement is expected to be\n$\\sim$3\\% ($\\sim$3\\%). A combined analysis from the three experiments will\nreduce the uncertainty and the relevant activity has started recently.\n", "  The first-passage time (FPT), defined as the time a random walker takes to\nreach a target point in a confining domain, is a key quantity in the theory of\nstochastic processes. Its importance comes from its crucial role to quantify\nthe efficiency of processes as varied as diffusion-limited reactions, target\nsearch processes or spreading of diseases. Most methods to determine the FPT\nproperties in confined domains have been limited to Markovian (memoryless)\nprocesses. However, as soon as the random walker interacts with its\nenvironment, memory effects can not be neglected. Examples of non Markovian\ndynamics include single-file diffusion in narrow channels or the motion of a\ntracer particle either attached to a polymeric chain or diffusing in simple or\ncomplex fluids such as nematics \\cite{turiv2013effect}, dense soft colloids or\nviscoelastic solution. Here, we introduce an analytical approach to calculate,\nin the limit of a large confining volume, the mean FPT of a Gaussian\nnon-Markovian random walker to a target point. The non-Markovian features of\nthe dynamics are encompassed by determining the statistical properties of the\ntrajectory of the random walker in the future of the first-passage event, which\nare shown to govern the FPT kinetics.This analysis is applicable to a broad\nrange of stochastic processes, possibly correlated at long-times. Our\ntheoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for several\nexamples of non-Markovian processes including the emblematic case of the\nFractional Brownian Motion in one or higher dimensions. These results show, on\nthe basis of Gaussian processes, the importance of memory effects in\nfirst-passage statistics of non-Markovian random walkers in confinement.\n", "  Hybrid Morphology Radio Sources (HyMoRS) are a class of radio galaxies having\nthe lobe morphology of a Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I on one side of the active\nnucleus and of a FR type II on the other. The origin of the different\nmorphologies between FR I and FR II sources has been widely discussed in the\npast 40 years, and HyMoRS may be the best way to understand whether this\ndichotomy is related to the intrinsic nature of the source and/or to its\nenvironment. However, these sources are extremely rare (<1% of radio galaxies)\nand only for a few of them a detailed radio study, that goes beyond the\nmorphological classification, has been conducted. In this paper we report the\ndiscovery of one new HyMoRS; we present X-ray and multi-frequency radio\nobservations. We discuss the source morphological, spectral and polarisation\nproperties and confirm that HyMoRS are intrinsically bimodal with respect to\nthese observational characteristics. We notice that HyMoRS classification based\njust on morphological properties of the source is hazardous.\n", "  HI absorption studies yield information on both AGN feeding and feedback\nprocesses. This AGN activity interacts with the neutral gas in compact radio\nsources, which are believed to represent the young or recently re-triggered AGN\npopulation. We present the results of a survey for HI absorption in a sample of\n66 compact radio sources at 0.040 < z < 0.096 with the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array. In total, we obtained seven detections, five of which are new,\nwith a large range of peak optical depths (3% to 87%). Of the detections, 71%\nexhibit asymmetric, broad ($\\Delta{v}_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$ > 100 km s$^{-1}$)\nfeatures, indicative of disturbed gas kinematics. Such broad, shallow and\noffset features are also found within low-excitation radio galaxies which is\nattributed to disturbed circumnuclear gas, consistent with early-type galaxies\ntypically devoid of a gas-rich disk. Comparing mid-infrared colours of our\ngalaxies with HI detections indicates that narrow and deep absorption features\nare preferentially found in late-type and high-excitation radio galaxies in our\nsample. These features are attributed to gas in galactic disks. By combining\nXMM-Newton archival data with 21-cm data, we find support that absorbed X-ray\nsources may be good tracers of HI content within the host galaxy. This sample\nextends previous HI surveys in compact radio galaxies to lower radio\nluminosities and provides a basis for future work exploring the higher redshift\nuniverse.\n", "  We discuss an apparent information paradox that arises in a materialist's\ndescription of the Universe if we assume that the Universe is 100% quantum. We\ndiscuss possible ways out of the paradox, including that Laws of Nature are not\npurely deterministic, or that gravity is classical. Our observation of the\nparadox stems from an interdisciplinary thought process whereby the Universe\ncan be viewed as a \"quantum computer\". Our presentation is intentionally\nnontechnical to make it accessible to as wide a readership base as possible.\n", "  Recent interferometric surveys of nearby main-sequence stars show a faint but\nsignificant near-infrared excess in roughly two dozen systems, i.$\\,$e. around\n$10\\,\\%$ to $30\\,\\%$ of stars surveyed. This excess is attributed to dust\nlocated in the immediate vicinity of the star, the origin of which is highly\ndebated. We used previously published interferometric observations to constrain\nthe properties and distribution of this hot dust. Considering both scattered\nradiation and thermal reemission, we modelled the observed excess in nine of\nthese systems. We find that grains have to be sufficiently absorbing to be\nconsistent with the observed excess, while dielectric grains with pure silicate\ncompositions fail to reproduce the observations. The dust should be located\nwithin $\\sim\\,0.01-1\\,au$ from the star depending on its luminosity.\nFurthermore, we find a significant trend for the disc radius to increase with\nthe stellar luminosity. The dust grains are determined to be below\n$0.2-0.5\\,\\mu\\textrm{m}$, but above $0.02-0.15\\,\\mu\\textrm{m}$ in radius. The\ndust masses amount to $(0.2-3.5)\\times10^{-9}\\,M_\\oplus$. The near-infrared\nexcess is probably dominated by thermal reemission, though a contribution of\nscattered light up to $35\\,\\%$ cannot be completely excluded. The polarisation\ndegree predicted by our models is always below $5\\,\\%$, and for grains smaller\nthan $\\sim0.2\\,\\mu\\textrm{m}$ even below $1\\,\\%$. We also modelled the observed\nnear-infrared excess of another ten systems with poorer data in the\nmid-infrared. The basic results for these systems appear qualitatively similar,\nyet the constraints on the dust location and the grain sizes are weaker.\n", "  In a previous work, the n-vicinity method for approximate calculation of the\npartition function of a spin system was proposed. The equation of state was\nobtained in the most general form. In the present paper, we analyze the\napplicability of this method for the Ising model on a D-dimensional cubic\nlattice. The equation of state is solved for an arbitrary dimension D and the\nbehavior of the free energy is analyzed. As expected, for large dimensions (D >\n2) the system demonstrates a phase transition of the second kind. In this case,\nwe obtain an analytical expression for the critical value of the inverse\ntemperature. When 2 < D < 8 this expression is in a very good agreement with\nthe results of computer simulations. In the case of small dimensions (D < 3),\nthere is a noticeable discrepancy with the known exact results.\n", "  Wheeled ground robots are limited from exploring extreme environments such as\ncaves, lava tubes and skylights. Small robots that can utilize unconventional\nmobility through hopping, flying or rolling can overcome these limitations.\nMul-tiple robots operating as a team offer significant benefits over a single\nlarge ro-bot, as they are not prone to single-point failure, enable distributed\ncommand and control and enable execution of tasks in parallel. These robots can\ncomplement large rovers and landers, helping to explore inaccessible sites,\nobtaining samples and for planning future exploration missions. Our robots, the\nSphereX, are 3-kg in mass, spherical and contain computers equivalent to\ncurrent smartphones. They contain an array of guidance, navigation and control\nsensors and electronics. SphereX contains room for a 1-kg science payload,\nincluding for sample return. Our work in this field has recognized the need for\nminiaturized chemical mobility systems that provide power and propulsion. Our\nresearch explored the use of miniature rockets, including solid rockets,\nbi-propellants including RP1/hydrogen-peroxide and\npolyurethane/ammonium-perchlorate. These propulsion options provide maximum\nflight times of 10 minutes on Mars. Flying, especially hovering consumes\nsignificant fuel; hence, we have been developing our robots to perform\nballistic hops that enable the robots to travel efficiently over long\ndistances. Techniques are being developed to enable mid-course correction\nduring a ballistic hop. Using multiple cameras, it is possible to reconstitute\nan image scene from motion blur. Hence our approach is to enable photo mapping\nas the robots travel on a ballistic hop. The same images would also be used for\nnavigation and path planning. Using our proposed design approach, we are\ndeveloping low-cost methods for surface exploration of planetary bodies using a\nnetwork of small robots.\n", "  Modeling deformation at elevated temperatures using discrete dislocation\ndynamics (DDD) is a recent area of high interest. However, the literature\ndedicated to this subject fails to address the variations of DDD parameters\nwith temperature. This study aims to investigate the effect of temperature on\nthe yield strength of aluminum thin films in two-dimensional DDD simulations.\nTo this end, the temperature dependence of DDD parameters has been studied\nusing molecular dynamics, three-dimensional DDD simulations, and the existing\nexperimental results. Based on these calculations, we observed 18% decrease in\nthe yield strength when temperature was increased from 100 K to 600 K.\n", "  Type-II Weyl semimetals are a novel gapless topological phase of matter\ndiscovered recently in 2015. Similar to normal (type-I) Weyl semimetals,\ntype-II Weyl semimetals consist of isolated band touching points. However,\nunlike type-I Weyl semimetals which have a linear energy dispersion around the\nband touching points forming a three dimensional (3D) Dirac cone, type-II Weyl\nsemimetals have a tilted cone-like structure around the band touching points.\nThis leads to various novel physical properties that are different from type-I\nWeyl semimetals. In order to study further the properties of type-II Weyl\nsemimetals and perhaps realize them for future applications, generating\ncontrollable type-II Weyl semimetals is desirable. In this paper, we propose a\nway to generate a type-II Weyl semimetal via a generalized Harper model\ninteracting with a harmonic driving field. When the field is treated\nclassically, we find that only type-I Weyl points emerge. However, by treating\nthe field quantum mechanically, some of these type-I Weyl points may turn into\ntype-II Weyl points. Moreover, by tuning the coupling strength, it is possible\nto control the tilt of the Weyl points and the energy difference between two\nWeyl points, which makes it possible to generate a pair of mixed Weyl points of\ntype-I and type-II. We also discuss how to physically distinguish these two\ntypes of Weyl points in the framework of our model via the Landau level\nstructures in the presence of an artificial magnetic field. The results are of\ngeneral interest to quantum optics as well as ongoing studies of Floquet\ntopological phases.\n", "  The rigid double-torus torsional oscillator (TO) is constructed to reduce any\nelastic effects in-herent to complicate TO structures, allowing explicit\nprobing for a genuine supersolid signature. We investigated the frequency- and\ntemperature-dependent response of the rigid double-torus TO containing solid\n4He with 0.6 ppb 3He and 300 ppb 3He. We did not find evidence to support the\nfrequency-independent contribution proposed to be a property of supersolid\nhelium. The frequency-dependent contribution which comes from the simple\nelastic effect of solid helium coupled to TO is essentially responsible for the\nentire response. The magnitude of the period drop is linearly proportional to\n${f}^{2}$, indicating that the responses observed in this TO are mostly caused\nby the overshoot of `soft' solid helium against the wall of the torus.\nDissipation of the rigid TO is vastly suppressed compared to those of non-rigid\nTOs.\n", "  We compare expressions for the atom interferometer phase obtained using the\npath integral approach and the approach based on the density matrix equation in\nthe Wigner representation. The power series of these expressions over the\nPlanck constant, truncated to the $\\hbar ^{2}$ term, coincide. This coincidence\nis achieved only after the $Q-$term is included.\n", "  We report on measurements of the local friction law at a multi-contact\ninterface formed between a smooth rubber and statistically rough glass lenses,\nunder steady state friction. Using contact imaging, surface displacements are\nmeasured, and inverted to extract both distributions of frictional shear stress\nand contact pressure with a spatial resolution of about 10~$\\mu$m. For a glass\nsurface whose topography is self-affine with a Gaussian height asperity\ndistribution, the local frictional shear stress is found to vary strongly\nsub-linearly with the local contact pressure over the whole investigated\npressure range. Such sub-linear behavior is also evidenced for a surface with a\nnon Gaussian height asperity distribution, demonstrating that, for such\nmulti-contact interfaces, Amontons-Coulomb's friction law does not prevail at\nthe local scale.\n", "  Frictional properties of contacts between a smooth viscoelastic rubber and\nrigid surfaces are investigated using a torsional contact configuration where a\nglass lens is continuously rotated on the rubber surface. From the inversion of\nthe displacement field measured at the surface of the rubber, spatially\nresolved values of the steady state frictional shear stress are determined\nwithin the non homogeneous pressure and velocity fields of the contact. For\ncontacts with a smooth lens, a velocity dependent but pressure independent\nlocal shear stress is retrieved from the inversion. On the other hand, the\nlocal shear stress is found to depend both on velocity and applied contact\npressure when a randomly rough (sand blasted) glass lens is rubbed against the\nrubber surface. As a result of changes in the density of micro-asperity\ncontacts, the amount of light transmitted by the transparent multi-contact\ninterface is observed to vary locally as a function of both contact pressure\nand sliding velocity. Under the assumption that the intensity of light\ntransmitted by the rough interface is proportional to the proportion of area\ninto contact, it is found that the local frictional stress can be expressed\nexperimentally as the product of a purely velocity dependent term, $k(v)$, by a\nterm representing the pressure and velocity dependence of the actual contact\narea, $A/A_0$. A comparison between $k(v)$ and the frictional shear stress of\nsmooth contacts suggests that nanometer scale dissipative processes occurring\nat the interface predominate over viscoelastic dissipation at micro-asperity\nscale.\n", "  Among the potential applications of topological insulators, we investigate\ntheoretically the effect of coexistence of proximity-induced ferromagnetism and\nsuperconductivity on the surface states of 3-dimensional topological insulator,\nwhere the superconducting electron-hole excitations can be significantly\naffected by the magnetization of ferromagnetic order. We find that, Majorana\nmode energy, as a verified feature of TI F/S structure, along the interface\nsensitively depends on the magnitude of magnetization $m_{zfs}$ in FS region,\nwhile its slope in perpendicular incidence presents steep and no change. Since\nthe superconducting gap is renormalized by a factor $\\eta(m_{zfs})$, hence\nAndreev reflection is more or less suppressed, and, in particular, resulting\nsubgap tunneling conductance is more sensitive to the magnitude of\nmagnetizations in FS and F regions. Furthermore, an interesting scenario\nhappens at the antiparallel configuration of magnetizations $m_{zf}$ and\n$m_{zfs}$ resulting in magnetoresistance in N/F/FS junction, which can be\ncontrolled and decreased by tuning the magnetization magnitude in FS region.\n", "  Among the potential applications of topological insulators, we theoretically\nstudy the coexistence of proximity-induced ferromagnetic and superconducting\norders in the surface states of a 3-dimensional topological insulator. The\nsuperconducting electron-hole excitations can be significantly affected by the\nmagnetic order induced by a ferromagnet. In one hand, the surface state of the\ntopological insulator, protected by the time-reversal symmetry, creates a\nspin-triplet and, on the other hand, magnetic order causes to renormalize the\neffective superconducting gap. We find Majorana mode energy along the\nferromagnet/superconductor interface to sensitively depend on the magnitude of\nmagnetization $m_{zfs}$ from superconductor region, and its slope around\nperpendicular incidence is steep with very low dependency on $m_{zfs}$. The\nsuperconducting effective gap is renormalized by a factor $\\eta(m_{zfs})$, and\nAndreev bound state in\nferromagnet-superconductor/ferromagnet/ferromagnet-superconductor (FS/F/FS)\nJosephson junction is more sensitive to the magnitude of magnetizations of FS\nand F regions. In particular, we show that the presence of $m_{zfs}$ has a\nnoticeable impact on the gap opening in Andreev bound state, which occurs in\nfinite angle of incidence. This directly results in zero-energy Andreev state\nbeing dominant. By introducing the proper form of corresponding Dirac spinors\nfor FS electron-hole states, we find that via the inclusion of $m_{zfs}$, the\nJosephson supercurrent is enhanced and exhibits almost abrupt crossover curve,\nfeaturing the dominant zero-energy Majorana bound states.\n", "  In this paper, by exploiting the weak measurement and quantum measurement re-\nversal (WMQMR) procedure, we propose a scheme to show how one can protect the\ngeometric quantum discord (GQD) of a two-qutrit V-type atomic system each of\nwhich interacts with a dissipative reservoir independently. We examine the\nscheme for the GQD of the initial two-qutrit Werner and Horodecki states for\ndifferent classes of weak mea- surement strengthes. It is found out that the\npresented protocol enables us to suppress decoherence due to the amplitude\ndamping (AD) channel and preserve the quantum dis- cord of the two-qutrit\nsystem successfully.\n", "  In the strong coupling limit, $n$-point functions in lattice QCD with\nstaggered fermions can be rewritten exactly as sums over constrained\nconfigurations of monomers, dimers, and baryon loops covering the spacetime\nlattice. Worm algorithms provide efficient global sampling methods over such\nensembles, and are particularly efficient in the chiral limit. We study the\nthermodynamics of strongly-coupled U(3) and SU(3) lattice QCD with one massless\nstaggered fermion using such methods, and compare the results with the\nrelativistic pion gas down to low temperatures O(15 MeV).\n", "  In the present work, we have studied for the first time the combined effect\nof both sonication and precipitation pH on the structure of amorphous zirconia\ngels synthesized from zirconium(IV) propoxide. The techniques of small-angle\nneutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS) and low temperature nitrogen\nadsorption provided the integral data on the changes in the microstructure and\nmesostructure of these materials caused by ultrasonic (US) treatment. Amorphous\nZrO2.xH2O synthesized under ultrasonic treatment was found to possess a very\nstructured surface, characterized by the surface fractal dimension 2.9-3.0,\ncompared to 2.3-2.5 for the non US-assisted synthesis, and it was also found to\npossess a higher specific surface area, while the sizes of the primary\nparticles remain unchanged.\n", "  This paper deals with the energy transport properties of charged particles\nwith time-dependent damping force. Based on the proposed nonlinear\ndimensionless mapping,the stability and dynamical evolution of the particle\nsystem is analyzed with the help of manifold-based analysis approach.It has\nbeen found that the particle system possesses two types of energy asymptotic\nbehaviors. More significantly, the underlying mechanism of an \"energy barrier\"\nis uncovered,i.e., one generalized invariant spanning curve emerges in the\ndissipative particle system. These results will be useful to enrich the energy\ntransport behavior knowledge of the particle system.\n", "  In this work, which is a continuation of Castell\\'o-Mor et al. (2016), we\npresent new X-ray and infrared (IR) data for a sample of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) covering a wide range in Eddington ratio over a small luminosity range.\nIn particular, we rigorously explore the dependence of the optical-to-X-ray\nspectral index $\\alpha_{OX}$ and the IR-to-optical spectral index on the\ndimensionless accretion rate, $\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}=\\dot{m}/\\eta$ where\n$\\dot{m}=L_{AGN}/L_{Edd}$ and $\\eta$ is the mass-to-radiation conversion\nefficiency, in low and high accretion rate sources. We find that the SED of the\nfaster accreting sources are surprisingly similar to those from the comparison\nsample of sources with lower accretion rate. In particular: i) the\noptical-to-UV AGN SED of slow and fast accreting AGN can be fitted with thin AD\nmodels. ii) The value of $\\alpha_{OX}$ is very similar in slow and fast\naccreting systems up to a dimensionless accretion rate\n$\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}_{c}\\sim$10. We only find a correlation between $\\alpha_{OX}$\nand $\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ for sources with $\\dot{\\mathcal{M}} >\n\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}_{c}$. In such cases, the faster accreting sources appear to\nhave systematically larger $\\alpha_{OX}$ values. iii) We also find that the\ntorus in the faster accreting systems seems to be less efficient in\nreprocessing the primary AGN radiation having lower IR-to-optical spectral\nslopes.\n  These findings, failing to recover the predicted differences between the SEDs\nof slim and thin ADs within the observed spectral window, suggest that\nadditional physical processes or very special geometry act to reduce the\nextreme UV radiation in fast accreting AGN. This may be related to photon\ntrapping, strong winds, and perhaps other yet unknown physical processes.\n", "  Hydrophobic PMMA colloidal particles, when dispersed in oil with a relatively\nhigh dielectric constant, can become highly charged. In the presence of an\ninterface with a conducting aqueous phase, image charge effects lead to strong\nbinding of colloidal particles to the interface, even though the particles are\nwetted very little by the aqueous phase. In this paper, we study both the\nbehavior of individual colloidal particles as they approach the interface, and\nthe interactions between particles that are already interfacially bound. We\ndemonstrate that using particles which are minimally wetted by the aqueous\nphase allows us to isolate and study those interactions which are due solely to\ncharging of the particle surface in oil. Finally, we show that these\ninteractions can be understood by a simple image-charge model in which the\nparticle charge $q$ is the sole fitting parameter.\n", "  We present a study of carbon radio recombination lines towards Cassiopeia A\nusing LOFAR observations in the frequency range 10-33 MHz. Individual carbon\n$\\alpha$ lines are detected in absorption against the continuum at frequencies\nas low as 16 MHz. Stacking several C$\\alpha$ lines we obtain detections in the\n11-16 MHz range. These are the highest signal-to-noise measurements at these\nfrequencies. The peak optical depth of the C$\\alpha$ lines changes considerably\nover the 11-33 MHz range with the peak optical depth decreasing from\n4$\\times10^{-3}$ at 33 MHz to 2$\\times10^{-3}$ at 11 MHz, while the line width\nincreases from 20 km s$^{-1}$ to 150 km s$^{-1}$. The combined change in peak\noptical depth and line width results in a roughly constant integrated optical\ndepth. We interpret this as carbon atoms close to local thermodynamic\nequilibrium.\n  In this work we focus on how the 11-33 MHz carbon radio recombination lines\ncan be used to determine the gas physical conditions. We find that the ratio of\nthe carbon radio recombination lines to that of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII]\nfine-structure line is a good thermometer, while the ratio between low\nfrequency carbon radio recombination lines provides a good barometer. By\ncombining the temperature and pressure constraints with those derived from the\nline width we are able to constrain the gas properties (electron temperature\nand density) and radiation field intensity. Given the 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties\nin our measurements these are; $T_{e}\\approx68$-$98$ K,\n$n_{e}\\approx0.02$-$0.035$ cm$^{-3}$ and $T_{r,100}\\approx1500$-$1650$ K.\nDespite challenging RFI and ionospheric conditions, our work demonstrates that\nobservations of carbon radio recombination lines in the 10-33 MHz range can\nprovide insight into the gas conditions.\n", "  At a distance of about 4.22 lightyears, it would take about 100,000 years for\nhumans to visit our closest stellar neighbor Proxima Centauri using modern\nchemical thrusters. New technologies are now being developed that involve\nhigh-power lasers firing at 1 gram solar sails in near-Earth orbits,\naccelerating them to 20% the speed of light (c) within minutes. Although such\nan interstellar probe could reach Proxima 20 years after launch, without\npropellant to slow it down it would traverse the system within hours. Here we\ndemonstrate how the stellar photon pressures of the stellar triple $\\alpha$ Cen\nA, B, and C (Proxima) can be used together with gravity assists to decelerate\nincoming solar sails from Earth. The maximum injection speed at $\\alpha$ Cen A\nto park a sail with a mass-to-surface ratio ($\\sigma$) similar to graphene\n(7.6e-4 gram/m$^{-2}$) in orbit around Proxima is about 13,800 km/s (4.6% c),\nimplying travel times from Earth to $\\alpha$ Cen A and B of about 95 years and\nanother 46 years (with a residual velocity of 1280 km/s) to Proxima. The size\nof such a low-$\\sigma$ sail required to carry a payload of 10 grams is about\n10$^5$ m$^2$ = (316 m)$^2$. Such a sail could use solar photons instead of an\nexpensive laser system to gain interstellar velocities at departure.\nPhotogravitational assists allow visits of three stellar systems and an\nEarth-sized potentially habitable planet in one shot, promising extremely high\nscientific yields.\n", "  We have compiled a catalog of 903 candidates for type 1 quasars at redshifts\n3<z<5.5 selected among the X-ray sources of the serendipitous XMM-Newton survey\npresented in the 3XMM-DR4 catalog (the median X-ray flux is 5x10^{-15}\nerg/s/cm^2 the 0.5-2 keV energy band) and located at high Galactic latitudes\n>20 deg in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) fields with a total area of about\n300 deg^2. Photometric SDSS data as well infrared 2MASS and WISE data were used\nto select the objects. We selected the point sources from the photometric SDSS\ncatalog with a magnitude error Delta z<0.2 and a color i-z<0.6 (to first\neliminate the M-type stars). For the selected sources, we have calculated the\ndependences chi^2(z) for various spectral templates from the library that we\ncompiled for these purposes using the EAZY software. Based on these data, we\nhave rejected the objects whose spectral energy distributions are better\ndescribed by the templates of stars at z=0 and obtained a sample of quasars\nwith photometric redshift estimates 2.75<zphot<5.5. The selection completeness\nof known quasars at z>3 in the investigated fields is shown to be about 80%.\nThe normalized median absolute deviation is 0.07, while the outlier fraction is\neta= 9. The number of objects per unit area in our sample exceeds the number of\nquasars in the spectroscopic SDSS sample at the same redshifts approximately by\na factor of 1.5. The subsequent spectroscopic testing of the redshifts of our\nselected candidates for quasars at 3<z<5.5 will allow the purity of this sample\nto be estimated more accurately.\n", "  On 2010 August 14, a wide-angled coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed.\nThis solar eruption originated from a destabilized filament that connected two\nactive regions and the unwinding of this filament gave the eruption an\nuntwisting motion that drew the attention of many observers. In addition to the\nerupting filament and the associated CME, several other low-coronal signatures\nthat typically indicate the occurrence of a solar eruption were associated to\nthis event. However, contrary to what is expected, the fast CME\n($\\mathrm{v}>900~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) was accompanied by only a weak\nC4.4 flare.\n  We investigate the various eruption signatures that were observed for this\nevent and focus on the kinematic evolution of the filament in order to\ndetermine its eruption mechanism. Had this solar eruption occurred just a few\ndays earlier, it could have been a significant event for space weather. The\nrisk to underestimate the strength of this eruption based solely on the C4.4\nflare illustrates the need to include all eruption signatures in event analyses\nin order to obtain a complete picture of a solar eruption and assess its\npossible space weather impact.\n", "  We present the results of optical spectroscopy for 19 quasar candidates at\nphotometric redshifts $\\zphot \\gtrsim 3$, \\Nobs \\ of which enter into the\nKhorunzhev et al.~(2016) catalog (K16). This is a catalog of quasar candidates\nand known type 1 quasars selected among the X-ray sources of the\n\\textit{3XMM-DR4}catalog of the XMM-Newton serendipitous survey. We have\nperformed spectroscopy for a quasi-random sample of new candidates at the 1.6-m\n\\Azt \\ telescope of the Sayan Solar Observatory and the 6-m BTA telescope of\nthe Special Astrophysical Observatory. The spectra at \\Azt \\ were taken with\nthe new low- and medium-resolution ADAM spectrograph that was produced and\ninstalled on the telescope in 2015. Fourteen of the \\Nobs \\ candidates actually\nhave turned out to be quasars; 10 of them are at spectroscopic redshifts z > 3.\nThe high purity of the sample of new candidates suggests that the purity of the\nentire K16 catalog of quasars is probably 70--80\\%. One of the most distant\n($\\zspec=5.08$) optically bright ($i^\\prime\\lesssim 21$) quasars ever detected\nin X-ray surveys has been discovered.\n", "  The High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD) is one of the payloads of the CSES\nspace mission. The CSES (China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite) mission will\ninvestigate the structure and the dynamic of the topside ionosphere, will\nmonitor electric and magnetic field and high energy particle fluctuations,\nsearching for their correlations with the geophysical activity, in order to\ncontribute to the monitoring of earthquakes from space. The HEPD is built by\nthe Italian collaboration and has different goals. It will study the temporal\nstability of the inner Van Allen radiation belts, the precipitation of trapped\nparticles in the atmosphere and the low energy component of the cosmic rays (5\n- 100 MeV for electrons and 15 - 300 MeV for protons). Here is presented a\nstudy of the performance of the apparatus to separate electrons and protons and\nidentify nuclei up to iron.\n", "  We report on electronic transport measurements of electrostatically gated\nnano-devices of the semimetal WTe\\textsubscript{2}. High mobility metallic\nbehavior is achieved in the 2D limit by encapsulating thin flakes in an inert\natmosphere. At low temperatures, we find that a large magnetoresistance can be\nturned on and off by electrostatically doping the system between a semimetallic\nstate and an electron-only metallic state, respectively. We confirm the nature\nof the two regimes by analyzing the magnetoresistance and Hall effect with a\ntwo-carrier model, as well as by analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations,\nboth of which indicate depletion of hole carriers via the electrostatic gate.\nThis confirms that semiclassical transport of two oppositely charged carriers\naccurately describes the exceptional magnetoresistance observed in this\nmaterial. Finally, we also find that the magnetoresistance power law is\nsub-quadratic and density-independent, suggesting new physics specifically in\nthe semimetallic regime.\n", "  Networks can model real-world systems in a variety of domains. Network\nalignment (NA) aims to find a node mapping that conserves similar regions\nbetween compared networks. NA is applicable to many fields, including\ncomputational biology, where NA can guide the transfer of biological knowledge\nfrom well- to poorly-studied species across aligned network regions. Existing\nNA methods can only align static networks. However, most complex real-world\nsystems evolve over time and should thus be modeled as dynamic networks. We\nhypothesize that aligning dynamic network representations of evolving systems\nwill produce superior alignments compared to aligning the systems' static\nnetwork representations, as is currently done. For this purpose, we introduce\nthe first ever dynamic NA method, DynaMAGNA++. This proof-of-concept dynamic NA\nmethod is an extension of a state-of-the-art static NA method, MAGNA++. Even\nthough both MAGNA++ and DynaMAGNA++ optimize edge as well as node conservation\nacross the aligned networks, MAGNA++ conserves static edges and similarity\nbetween static node neighborhoods, while DynaMAGNA++ conserves dynamic edges\n(events) and similarity between evolving node neighborhoods. For this purpose,\nwe introduce the first ever measure of dynamic edge conservation and rely on\nour recent measure of dynamic node conservation. Importantly, the two dynamic\nconservation measures can be optimized using any state-of-the-art NA method and\nnot just MAGNA++. We confirm our hypothesis that dynamic NA is superior to\nstatic NA, under fair comparison conditions, on synthetic and real-world\nnetworks, in computational biology and social network domains. DynaMAGNA++ is\nparallelized and it includes a user-friendly graphical interface.\n", "  In this paper, a novel electret-based capacitive energy harvesting device has\nbeen developed according to out-of-plane gap closing scheme. The device is\ncomposed of a micro cantilever and a substrate which form a variable capacitor\nand is in series with a resistance. An electret material is used to provide the\nbias voltage which is needed in capacitive energy harvesters in order to\nscavenge energy from ambient vibration. The ambient vibration is applied to the\nsystem as a harmonic base excitation. The motion equations and the\ncorresponding boundary conditions are derived using Hamilton's principle based\non Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the Kirchhoff's voltage law is employed to\ncouple the mechanical and electrical fields. The equations of motion are\ndiscretized using Galerkin procedure and integrated numerically over time.\nPull-in instability of the system is investigated in both static and dynamic\ncases. The effect of various parameters on the behavior of the device is\nstudied. The maximum theoretical harvested power is resistance in the order of\n1 micro-watt.\n", "  We propose the concept of a bianisotropic metasurface with controllable\nangular scattering. We illustrate this concept with the synthesis and the\nanalysis of a metasurface exhibiting controllable absorption and transmission\nphase as function of the incidence angle.\n", "  There is a strong interest to attach nanoparticles non-covalently to\none-dimensional systems like boron nitride nanotubes to form composites. The\ncombination of those materials might be used for catalysis, in solar cells, or\nfor water splitting. Additionally, the fundamental aspect of charge transfer\nbetween the components can be studied in such systems. We report on the\nsynthesis and characterization of nanocomposites based on semiconductor\nnanoparticles attached directly and non-covalently to boron nitride nanotubes.\nBoron nitride nanotubes were simply integrated into the colloidal synthesis of\nthe corresponding nanoparticles. With PbSe, CdSe, and ZnO nanoparticles a wide\nrange of semiconductor bandgaps from the near infrared to the ultra violet\nrange was covered. A high surface coverage of the boron nitride nanotubes with\nthese semiconducting nanoparticles was achieved, while it was found that a\nsimilar in-situ approach with metallic nanoparticles does not lead to proper\nattachment. In addition, possible models for the underlying attachment\nmechanisms of all investigated nanoparticles are presented. To emphasize the\nnew possibilities that boron nitride nanotubes offer as a support material for\nsemiconductor nanoparticles we investigated the fluorescence of BN-CdSe\ncomposites. In contrast to CdSe nanoparticles attached to carbon nanotubes,\nwhere the fluorescence is quenched, particles attached to boron nitride\nnanotubes remain fluorescent. With our versatile approaches we expand the\nlibrary of BN-nanoparticle composites that present an interesting,\nelectronically non-interacting complement to the widely applied carbon\nnanotube-nanoparticle composite materials.\n", "  Exact bright, dark, antikink solitary waves and Jacobi elliptic function\nsolutions of the generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation with arbitrary\npower-law nonlinearity will be constructed in this work. The method used to\ncarry out the integration is the F-expansion method. Solutions obtained have\nfractional and integer negative or positive power-law nonlinearities. These\nsolutions have many free parameters such that they may be used to simulate many\nexperimental situations, and to precisely control the dynamics of the system.\n", "  During recent years the interest to dynamics of quantum systems has grown\nconsiderably. Quantum many body systems out of equilibrium often manifest\nbehavior, different from the one predicted by standard statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics in equilibrium. Since the dynamics of a many body quantum\nsystem typically involve many excited eigenstates, with a non-thermal\ndistribution, the time evolution of such a system provides an unique way for\ninvestigation of non-equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. Last decade\nsuch new subjects like quantum quenches, thermalization, pre-thermalization,\nequilibration, generalized Gibbs ensemble, etc. are among the most attractive\ntopics of investigation in modern quantum physics. One of the most interesting\nthemes in the study of dynamics of quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium\nis connected with the recently proposed important concept of dynamical quantum\nphase transitions. During the last few years a great progress has been achieved\nin studying of those singularities in the time dependence of characteristics of\nquantum mechanical systems, in particular, in understanding how the quantum\ncritical points of equilibrium thermodynamics affect their dynamical\nproperties. Dynamical quantum phase transitions reveal universality, scaling,\nconnection to the topology, and many other interesting features. Here we review\nthe recent achievements of this quickly developing part of low temperature\nquantum physics. The study of dynamical quantum phase transitions is especially\nimportant in context of their connection to the problem of the modern theory of\nquantum information, where namely non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum\nsystem plays the major role.\n", "  The health of cells found in the inner retinal layers of the human eye is\ncrucial to understand the onset of diseases of the retina such as macular\ndegeneration and retinopathy. A challenge is to periodically image these cells\nin human eyes to detect abnormalities well before physiological and\npathological changes occur. However, in vivo imaging of many of these cells is\nstill elusive despite the phenomenal advances in Optical Coherence Tomography\n(OCT) and Adaptive Optics systems. It stems from the fact that cell contrast in\nreflection is extremely low. Here, we report a major advance towards this goal\nby proposing and demonstrating a method to visualize these cells with high\ncontrast and resolution. The method uses a transcleral illumination which\nprovides a high numerical aperture in a dark field configuration. The light\nbackscattered by the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and Choroid layer\nprovides a forward illumination for the upper layer of the retina, thus\nproviding a transmission illumination condition. By collecting the scattered\nlight through the pupil, the partially coherent illumination produces dark\nfield images, which are combined to reconstruct a quantitative phase image with\ntwice the numerical aperture given by the eye's pupil. The retrieved\nquantitative phase images (QPI) of cells in ex vivo human and pig's eyes are\nvalidated with those taken with a standard QPI system. We then report, to our\nknowledge, the very first human in vivo phase images of inner retinal cells\nwith high contrast.\n", "  Superconductivity and topological quantum states are two frontier fields of\nresearch in modern condensed matter physics. The realization of\nsuperconductivity in topological materials is highly desired, however,\nsuperconductivity in such materials is typically limited to two- or\nthree-dimensional materials and is far from being thoroughly investigated. In\nthis work, we boost the electronic properties of the quasi-one-dimensional\ntopological insulator bismuth iodide \\b{eta}-Bi4I4 by applying high pressure.\nSuperconductivity is observed in \\b{eta}-Bi4I4 for pressures where the\ntemperature dependence of the resistivity changes from a semiconducting-like\nbehavior to that of a normal metal. The superconducting transition temperature\nTc increases with applied pressure and reaches a maximum value of 6 K at 23\nGPa, followed by a slow decrease. Our theoretical calculations suggest the\npresence of multiple pressure-induced topological quantum phase transitions as\nwell as a structural-electronic instability.\n", "  The efficient interaction of light with quantum emitters is crucial to most\napplications in nano and quantum photonics, such as sensing or quantum\ninformation processing. Effective excitation and photon extraction are\nparticularly important for the weak signals emitted by a single atom or\nmolecule. Recent works have introduced novel collection strategies, which\ndemonstrate that large efficiencies can be achieved by either planar dielectric\nantennas combined with high numerical-aperture objectives or optical\nnanostructures that beam emission into a narrow angular distribution. However,\nthe first approach requires the use of elaborate collection optics, while the\nlatter is based on accurate positioning of the quantum emitter near complex\nnanoscale architectures; hence, sophisticated fabrication and experimental\ncapabilities are needed. Here, we present a theoretical and experimental\ndemonstration of a planar optical antenna that beams light emitted by a single\nmolecule, which results in increased collection efficiency at small angles\nwithout stringent requirements on the emitter position. The proposed device\nexhibits broadband performance and is spectrally scalable, and it is simple to\nfabricate and therefore applies to a wide range of quantum emitters. Our design\nfinds immediate application in spectroscopy, quantum optics and sensing.\n", "  Brunel radiation appears as a result of a two-step process of\nphoto-ionization and subsequent acceleration of electron, without the need of\nelectron recollision. We show that for generation of Brunel harmonics at all\nfrequencies the subcycle ionization dynamics is of critical importance. Namely,\nsuch harmonics disappear at low pump intensities when the ionization dynamics\ndepends only on the slow envelope (so called multiphoton ionization regime) and\nnot on the instantaneous field. Nevertheless, if the pump pulse contains\nincommensurate frequencies, Brunel mechanism does generate new frequencies even\nin the multiphoton ionization regime.\n", "  We present a sequence of eight spectropolarimetric observations monitoring\nthe geometric evolution of the late phase of the major 2012 outburst of SN\n2009ip. These were acquired with the FORS2 polarimeter mounted on ESO VLT. The\ncontinuum was polarised at 0.3-0.8 per cent throughout the observations,\nshowing that the photosphere deviated substantially from spherical symmetry by\n10-15 per cent. Significant line polarisation is detected for both hydrogen and\nhelium at high velocities. The similarity in the polarised signal between these\nelements indicates that they form in the same location in the ejecta. The line\npolarisation (p$\\sim$1-1.5 per cent) at low velocities revealed the presence of\na highly-aspherical hydrogen and helium rich circumstellar medium (CSM). Monte\nCarlo simulations of the observed polarimetry were performed in an effort to\nconstrain the shape of the CSM. The simulations imply that the polarimetry can\nbe understood within the framework of a disk-like CSM inclined by 14$\\pm$2\ndegrees out of the line of sight, obscuring the photosphere only at certain\nepochs. The varying temporal evolution of polarisation at high and low\nvelocities indicated that the fast-moving ejecta expanded with a preferred\ndirection orthogonal to that of the CSM.\n", "  800 GeV gluino pair production is simulated using ISASUSY 1.1 MC-program. The\ncascade decay of the gluino into two lightest neutralinos, $\\widetilde{g}\n\\rightarrow \\widetilde{\\chi}_2^0 X$, $\\widetilde{\\chi}_2^0 \\rightarrow \\mu^+\n\\mu^- \\widetilde{\\chi}_1^0$, is studied for a convenient set of SUSY\nparameters: $\\mu$ = 200 GeV, tan$\\beta$ = 2, average squark masses of 1600 GeV,\ncharged Higgs mass of 500 GeV, and top quark mass of 140 GeV. With such\nparameters the mass difference between $\\widetilde{\\chi}_2^0$ and\n$\\widetilde{\\chi}_1^0$ is less than the mass of Z. As a background, $t\\bar{t}$,\nZ + jets, WW, WZ and ZZ events were generated using ISAJET 6.50 MC-program. The\ngranularities and energy resolutions of the calorimeters in the pseudorapidity\nrange of $\\mid\\eta\\mid$ < 5 are taken into account. If missing transverse\nmomentum is greater than 200 GeV, the number of jets in the calorimeters is 4\nor more, the invariant mass of two isolated muons is less than 80 GeV, the\nbackground in the muon transverse momentum distribution is negligible.\n", "  We present a new updated catalogue of Galactic and extragalactic symbiotic\nstars (SySts). Since the last catalogue of SySts (Belczynski et al. 2000), the\nnumber of known SySts has significantly increased. Our new catalogue contains\n316 known and 82 candidates SySts. Of the confirmed Systs 252 are located in\nour Galaxy and 64 in nearby galaxies. This reflects an increase of $\\sim$50% in\nthe population of Galactic SySts and $\\sim$400% in the population of\nextragalactic SySts. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of 334 (known and\ncandidates) SySts have been constructed using the 2MASS and WISE data. These\nSEDs are used to provide a robust reclassification in scheme of S- (74%), D-\n(15%) and D'-types (2.5%). The SEDs of S- and D-type peak between 0.8 and\n1.6$\\mu$m and between 1.6 and 4$\\mu$m, respectively, whereas those of D'-type\nexhibit a plateau profile. Moreover, we provide the first compilation of SySts\nthat exhibit the OVI Raman-scattered line at 6830\\AA. Our analysis shows that\n55% of the Galactic SySts exhibit that line in their spectrum, whereas this\npercentage is different from galaxy to galaxy.\n", "  I present here the first results from an ongoing pilot project with the 1.6 m\ntelescope at the OPD, Brasil, aimed at the detection of the OVI $\\lambda$6830\nline via linear polarization in symbiotic stars. The main goal is to\ndemonstrate that OVI imaging polarimetry is an efficient technique for\ndiscovering new symbiotic stars. The OVI $\\lambda$6830 line is found in 5 out\nof 9 known symbiotic stars, in which the OVI line has already been\nspectroscopically confirmed, with at least 3-$\\sigma$ detection. Three new\nsymbiotic star candidates have also been found.\n", "  The sausage model, first proposed by Fateev, Onofri, and Zamolodchikov, is a\ndeformation of the O(3) sigma model preserving integrability. The target space\nis deformed from the sphere to \"sausage\" shape by a deformation parameter \\nu.\nThis model is defined by a factorizable S-matrix which is obtained by deforming\nthat of the O(3) sigma model by a parameter \\lambda. Clues for the deformed\nsigma model are provided by various UV and IR information through the\nthermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) analysis based on the S-matrix. Application of\nTBA to the sausage model is, however, limited to the case of 1/\\lambda integer\nwhere the coupled integral equations can be truncated to a finite number. In\nthis paper, we propose a finite set of nonliear integral equations (NLIEs),\nwhich are applicable to generic value of \\lambda. Our derivation is based on\nT-Q relations extracted from the truncated TBA equations. For consistency\ncheck, we compute next-leading order corrections of the vacuum energy and\nextract the S-matrix information in the IR limit. We also solved the NLIE both\nanalytically and numerically in the UV limit to get the effective central\ncharge and compared with that of the zero-mode dynamics to obtain exact\nrelation between \\nu and \\lambda.\n  This paper is a tribute to the memory of Prof. Petr Kulish.\n", "  The internal structure of exotic hadron candidates are studied from the\nviewpoint of the compositeness of near-threshold states. We focus on the\nWeinberg's weak-binding relation between the experimental observables and the\ncompositeness of the state. First we extend the relation for quasibound states\nwithin the framework of the effective field theory. Next, considering the\ncorrection term, we develop a systematic method to estimate the uncertainty of\ncompositeness in the weak-binding relation. Finally, applying the extended\nrelation and the error evaluation method, we conclude that the structure of\nLambda(1405) is dominated by the Kbar N component.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a novel design of dielectric laser-driven\naccelerator (DLA) utilizing evanescent electric field of racetrack ring\nresonator structures. Driven by laser light with the correctly designed optical\nphase window, sustained acceleration of electrons with controlled deflection is\nshown. Based on this design, we calculate an acceleration from 30 keV to\n148.312 keV in 104.655 {\\mu}m using a cascaded 11-stage racetrack ring\nresonators. This new idea poses a solution for on-chip integration of many DLA\nstages, while maintains high average accelerating gradients, providing a\npotential practical realization for \"accelerator on a chip\".\n", "  Rampino & Caldeira (2015) carry out a circular spectral analysis (CSA) of the\nterrestrial impact cratering record over the past 260 million years (Ma), and\nsuggest a ~26 Ma periodicity of impact events. For some of the impacts in that\nanalysis, new accurate and high-precision (\"robust\"; 2SE<2%) 40Ar-39Ar ages\nhave recently been published, resulting in significant age shifts. In a CSA of\nthe updated impact age list, the periodicity is strongly reduced. In a CSA of a\nlist containing only impacts with robust ages, we find no significant\nperiodicity for the last 500 Ma. We show that if we relax the assumption of a\nfully periodic impact record, assuming it to be a mix of a periodic and a\nrandom component instead, we should have found a periodic component if it\ncontributes more than ~80% of the impacts in the last 260 Ma. The difference\nbetween our CSA and the one by Rampino & Caldeira (2015) originates in a subset\nof \"clustered\" impacts (i.e., with overlapping ages). The ~26 Ma periodicity\nseemingly carried by these clusters alone is strongly significant if tested\nagainst a random distribution of ages, but this significance disappears if it\nis tested against a distribution containing (randomly-spaced) clusters. The\npresence of a few impact age clusters (e.g., from asteroid break-up events) in\nan otherwise random impact record can thus give rise to false periodicity peaks\nin a CSA. There is currently no evidence for periodicity in the impact record.\n", "  Non-perturbative lattice QCD calculations at non vanishing baryon number\ndensity are hampered by the QCD sign problem. The path integral, that in\nlattice QCD is calculated numerically, becomes highly oscillating. One possible\nsolution is the Lefschetz thimble approach. It requires a deformation of the\noriginal integration domain into a manifold embedded in complex space. For\nproperly chosen integration manifolds (\"thimbles\") the sign problem is\ndrastically alleviated. For some bosonic and fermionic models this approach has\nbeen shown to work. Here we apply the thimble disretization to\n(0+1)-dimensional QCD with standard staggerd quarks and disscuss issues that\nmay arrise in higher dimensions.\n", "  We present results for the isospin-0 $\\pi\\pi$ s-wave scattering length\ncalculated in twisted mass lattice QCD. We use three $N_f = 2$ ensembles with\nunitary pion mass at its physical value, 240~MeV and 330~MeV respectively. We\nalso use a large set of $N_f = 2 + 1 +1$ ensembles with unitary pion masses\nvarying in the range of 230~MeV - 510~MeV at three different values of the\nlattice spacing. A mixed action approach with the Osterwalder-Seiler action in\nthe valence sector is adopted to circumvent the complications arising from\nisospin symmetry breaking of the twisted mass quark action. Due to the\nrelatively large lattice artefacts in the $N_f = 2 + 1 +1$ ensembles, we do not\npresent the scattering lengths for these ensembles. Instead, taking the\nadvantage of the many different pion masses of these ensembles, we\nqualitatively discuss the pion mass dependence of the scattering properties of\nthis channel based on the results from the $N_f = 2 + 1 +1$ ensembles. The\nscattering length is computed for the $N_f = 2$ ensembles and the chiral\nextrapolation is performed. At the physical pion mass, our result $M_\\pi\na^\\mathrm{I=0}_0 = 0.198(9)(6)$ agrees reasonably well with various\nexperimental measurements and theoretical predictions.\n", "  The analogy between the laws of black hole mechanics and the laws of\nthermodynamics led Bekenstein and Hawking to argue that black holes should be\nconsidered as real thermodynamic systems that are characterised by entropy and\ntemperature. Black hole thermodynamics indicates a deeper connection between\nthermodynamics and gravity. We review and examine in detail the arguments that\nsuggest an interpretation of gravity itself as a thermodynamic theory.\n", "  The goals of the ongoing and planned ATLAS muon detector upgrades are to\nincrease the acceptance for precision muon momentum measurement and triggering\nand to improve the rate capability of the muon chambers in the high-background\nregions corresponding to the increasing LHC luminosity. Smalldiameter Muon\nDrift Tube (sMDT) chambers have been developed for these purposes. With half\nthe drift-tube diameter of the current ATLAS Muon Drift Tube (MDT) chambers\nwith 30 mm drift tube diameter and otherwise unchanged operating parameters,\nthe sMDT chambers share all the advantages of the MDTs, but have an about an\norder of magnitude higher rate capability and can be installed in detector\nregions where MDT chambers do not fit in. The construction of twelve chambers\nfor the feet regions of the ATLAS detector has been completed for the\ninstallation in the winter shutdown 2016/17 of the Large Hadron Collider. The\npurpose of this upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is to increase the\nacceptance for three-point muon track measurement which substantially improves\nthe muon momentum resolution in the regions concerned.\n", "  The Huang-Hilbert transform is applied to Seismic Electric Signal (SES)\nactivities in order to decompose them into a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions\n(IMFs) and study which of these functions better represent the SES. The results\nare compared to those obtained from the analysis in a new time domain termed\nnatural time after having subtracted the magnetotelluric background from the\noriginal signal. It is shown that the instantaneous amplitudes of the IMFs can\nbe used for the distinction of SES from artificial noises when combined with\nthe natural time analysis.\n", "  We summarize our results concerning the spectrum and mass anomalous dimension\nof SU(2) gauge theories with various numbers of fermions in the adjoint\nrepresentation, where each Majorana fermion corresponds effectively to half a\nDirac flavour $N_f$. The most relevant examples for extensions of the standard\nmodel are supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory ($N_f=1/2$) and Minimal Walking\nTechnicolour ($N_f=2$). In addition to these theories we will also consider the\ncases of $N_f=1$ and $N_f=3/2$. The results comprise the particle spectrum of\nglueballs, triplet and singlet mesons, and possible fractionally charged spin\nhalf particles. In addition we will discuss our recent results for the mass\nanomalous dimension.\n", "  The diffusion of tungsten in {\\alpha}-iron is important for the application\nof ferritic-iron alloys to thermal power plants. These data, over a wide\ntemperature range across the Curie temperature, have been recently reported. We\nshow that these diffusion coefficients can be satisfactory reproduced in terms\nof the bulk elastic and expansivity data by means of a thermodynamical model\nthat interconnects point defects parameters with bulk qualities.\n", "  Ab initio detailed calculations of the elastic properties of AgCl_{x}Br_{1-x}\nalloys recently appeared using density-functional perturbation theory and\nemploying the virtual crystal approximation or by means of the full potential\nlinearized augmented plane wave method. Here, we suggest a simple theoretical\nmodel that enables the estimation of the isothermal compressibility of these\nalloys in terms of the elastic data of end members alone. The calculated values\nare in satisfactory agreement with the experimental ones. The present model\nmakes use of an early suggestion that interconnects the Gibbs energy for the\nformation and/or migration of defects in solids with bulk properties.\n", "  The explanation for the origin of families of quarks and leptons and their\nproperties is one of the most promising ways to understand the assumptions of\nthe Standard Model. The Spin-Charge-Family theory, which does propose the\nmechanism for the appearance of families and offers an explanation for all the\nassumptions of the Standard Model, predicts two decoupled groups of four\nfamilies. The lightest of the upper four families has stable members, which are\ncorrespondingly candidates to constitute the dark matter. We study the weak and\nthe \"nuclear\" (determined by the colour interaction among the heavy fifth\nfamily quarks) scattering of such a very heavy baryon by ordinary nucleons in\norder to show that the cross-section is very small and consistent with the\nobservation in most experiments so far, provided that the quark mass of this\nbaryon is about 100 TeV or above.\n", "  In van der Waals heterostructures, the periodic potential from the Moir\\'e\nsuperlattice can be used as a control knob to modulate the electronic structure\nof the constituent materials. Here we present a nanoscale angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (Nano-ARPES) study of transferred graphene/h-BN\nheterostructures with two different stacking angles of 2.4{\\deg} and 4.3{\\deg}\nrespectively. Our measurements reveal six replicas of graphene Dirac cones at\nthe superlattice Brillouin zone (SBZ) centers. The size of the SBZ and its\nrelative rotation angle to the graphene BZ are in good agreement with Moir\\'e\nsuperlattice period extracted from atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements.\nComparison to epitaxial graphene/h-BN with 0{\\deg} stacking angles suggests\nthat the interaction between graphene and h-BN decreases with increasing\nstacking angle.\n", "  We present a method for calibrating images acquired by the Dawn Framing\nCamera (FC) that is based on the results of an in-flight calibration campaign\nperformed during the cruise from Earth to Vesta. We describe this campaign and\nthe data analysis in full. Both the primary camera FC2 and the backup camera\nFC1 are radiometrically and geometrically calibrated through observations of\nstandard stars, star fields, and solar system objects. The calibration in each\nspectral filter is accurate to within a few percent for point sources.\nGeometric distortion, small by design, is characterized with high accuracy.\nDark current, monitored on a regular basis, is very low at flight operational\ntemperatures. Out-of-field stray light was characterized using the Sun as a\nstray light source. In-field stray light is confirmed in narrow-band filter\nimages of Vesta. Its magnitude and distribution are scene-dependent, and\nexpected to contribute significantly to images of extended objects. Description\nof a method for in-field stray light correction is deferred to a follow-up\npaper, as is a discussion of the closely related topic of flat-fielding.\n", "  Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and X-ray emission from galaxy\nclusters have been extensively used to constrain cosmological parameters. These\nconstraints are highly sensitive to the relations between cluster masses and\nobservables (tSZ and X-ray fluxes). The cross-correlation of tSZ and X-ray data\nis thus a powerful tool, in addition of tSZ and X-ray based analysis, to test\nour modeling of both tSZ and X-ray emission from galaxy clusters. We chose to\nexplore this cross correlation as both emissions trace the hot gas in galaxy\nclusters and thus constitute one the easiest correlation that can be studied.\nWe present a complete modeling of the cross correlation between tSZ effect and\nX-ray emission from galaxy clusters, and focuses on the dependencies with\nclusters scaling laws and cosmological parameters. We show that the present\nknowledge of cosmological parameters and scaling laws parameters leads to an\nuncertainties of 47\\% on the overall normalization of the tSZ-X cross\ncorrelation power spectrum. We present the expected signal-to-noise ratio for\nthe tSZ-X cross-correlation angular power spectrum considering the sensitivity\nof actual tSZ and X-ray surveys from {\\it Planck}-like data and ROSAT. We\ndemonstrate that this signal-to-noise can reach 31.5 in realistic situation,\nleading to a constraint on the amplitude of tSZ-X cross correlation up to\n3.2\\%, fifteen times better than actual modeling limitations. Consequently,\nused in addition to other probes of cosmological parameters and scaling\nrelations, we show that the tSZ-X is a powerful probe to constrain scaling\nrelations and cosmological parameters.\n", "  We present the first detection of the cross-correlation angular power\nspectrum between the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and the X-ray\nemission over the full sky. The tSZ effect and X-rays are produced by the same\nhot gas within groups and clusters of galaxies, which creates a naturally\nstrong correlation between them that can be used to boost the joint signal and\nderive cosmological parameters. We computed the correlation between the ROSAT\nAll Sky Survey in the 0.5-2 keV energy band and the tSZ effect reconstructed\nfrom six Planck all-sky frequency maps between 70 and 545 GHz. We detect a\nsignificant correlation over a wide range of angular scales. In the range\n$50<\\ell < 2000$, the cross-correlation of X-rays to tSZ is detected at an\noverall significance of 28 $\\sigma$. As part of our systematic study, we\nperformed a multi-frequency modelling of the AGN contamination and the\ncorrelation between cosmic infra-red background and X-rays. Taking advantage of\nthe strong dependence of the cross-correlation signal on the amplitude of the\npower spectrum, we constrained $\\sigma_8 = 0.804 \\pm 0.037$, where modelling\nuncertainties dominate statistical and systematic uncertainties. We also\nderived constraints on the mass indices of scaling relations between the halo\nmass and X-ray luminosity, L$_{500}$-M$_{500}$, and SZ signal,\nY$_{500}$-M$_{500}$, $a_{\\rm sz} + a_{\\rm x} = 3.37 \\pm 0.09$, and on the\nindices of the extra-redshift evolution, $\\beta_{\\rm sz} + \\beta_{\\rm x} =\n0.4^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$.\n", "  The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect is produced by the interaction of\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) photons with the hot (a few keV) and diffuse\ngas of electrons inside galaxy clusters integrated along the line of sight.\nThis effect produces a distortion of CMB blackbody emission law. This\ndistortion law depends on the electronic temperature of the intra-cluster hot\ngas, $T_{e}$, through the so-called tSZ relativistic corrections. In this work,\nwe have performed a statistical analysis of the tSZ spectral distortion on\nlarge galaxy cluster samples. We performed a stacking analysis for several\nelectronic temperature bins, using both spectroscopic measurements of X-ray\ntemperatures and a scaling relation between X-ray luminosities and electronic\ntemperatures. We report the first high significance detection of the\nrelativistic tSZ at a significance of 5.3 $\\sigma$. We also demonstrate that\nthe observed tSZ relativistic corrections are consistent with X-ray deduced\ntemperatures. This measurement of the tSZ spectral law demonstrates that tSZ\neffect spectral distorsion can be used as a probe to measure galaxy cluster\ntemperatures.\n", "  We investigate the impact of dissipation on the energy balance in the\nelectron dynamics of metal clusters excited by strong electro-magnetic pulses.\nThe dynamics is described theoretically by Time-Dependent Density-Functional\nTheory (TDDFT) at the level of Local Density Approximation (LDA) augmented by a\nself interaction correction term and a quantum collision term in\nRelaxation-Time Approximation (RTA). We evaluate the separate contributions to\nthe total excitation energy, namely energy exported by electron emission,\npotential energy due to changing charge state, intrinsic kinetic and potential\nenergy, and collective flow energy. The balance of these energies is studied as\nfunction of the laser parameters (frequency, intensity, pulse length) and as\nfunction of system size and charge. We also look at collisions with a highly\ncharged ion and here at the dependence on the impact parameter (close versus\ndistant collisions). Dissipation turns out to be small where direct electron\nemission prevails namely for laser frequencies above any ionization threshold\nand for slow electron extraction in distant collisions. Dissipation is large\nfor fast collisions and at low laser frequencies, particularly at resonances.\n", "  The NASA Dawn spacecraft acquired thousands of images of asteroid Vesta\nduring its year-long orbital tour, and is now on its way to asteroid Ceres. A\nmethod for calibrating images acquired by the onboard Framing Camera was\ndescribed by Schr\\\"oder et al. (2013; Icarus 226, 1304). However, their method\nis only valid for point sources. In this paper we extend the calibration to\nimages of extended sources like Vesta. For this, we devise a first-order\ncorrection for in-field stray light, which is known to plague images taken\nthrough the narrow band filters, and revise the flat fields that were acquired\nin an integrating sphere before launch. We used calibrated images of the Vesta\nsurface to construct simple photometric models for all filters, that allow us\nto study how the spectrum changes with increasing phase angle (phase\nreddening). In combination with these models, our calibration method can be\nused to create near-seamless mosaics that are radiometrically accurate to a few\npercent. Such mosaics are provided in JVesta, the Vesta version of the JMARS\ngeographic information system.\n", "  We determine the exact time-dependent non-idempotent one-particle reduced\ndensity matrix and its spectral decomposition for a harmonically confined\ntwo-particle correlated one-dimensional system when the interaction terms in\nthe Schr\\\"odinger Hamiltonian are changed abruptly. Based on this matrix in\ncoordinate space we derivea precise condition for the equivalence of the purity\nand the overlap-square of the correlated and non-correlated wave functions as\nthe system evolves in time. This equivalence holds only if the interparticle\ninteractions are affected, while the confinement terms are unaffected within\nthe stability range of the system. Under this condition we also analyze various\ntime-dependent measures of entanglement and demonstrate that, depending on the\nmagnitude of the changes made in the Schr\\\"odinger Hamiltonian, periodic,\nlogarithmically incresing or constant value behavior of the von Neumann entropy\ncan occur.\n", "  Black phosphorus (BP) has recently emerged as an alternative 2D semiconductor\nowing to its fascinating electronic properties such as tunable bandgap and high\ncharge carrier mobility. The structural investigation of few-layer BP, such as\nidentification of layer thickness and atomic-scale edge structure, is of great\nimportance to fully understand its electronic and optical properties. Here we\nreport atomic-scale analysis of few-layered BP performed by aberration\ncorrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We establish the\nlayer-number-dependent atomic resolution imaging of few-layer BP via TEM\nimaging and image simulations. The structural modification induced by the\nelectron beam leads to revelation of crystalline edge and formation of BP\nnanoribbons. Atomic resolution imaging of BP clearly shows the reconstructed\nzigzag (ZZ) edge structures, which is also corroborated by van der Waals first\nprinciples calculations on the edge stability. Our study on the precise\nidentification of BP thickness and atomic-resolution imaging of edge structures\nwill lay the groundwork for investigation of few-layer BP, especially BP in\nnanostructured forms.\n", "  Given a set of attributed subgraphs known to be from different classes, how\ncan we discover their differences? There are many cases where collections of\nsubgraphs may be contrasted against each other. For example, they may be\nassigned ground truth labels (spam/not-spam), or it may be desired to directly\ncompare the biological networks of different species or compound networks of\ndifferent chemicals.\n  In this work we introduce the problem of characterizing the differences\nbetween attributed subgraphs that belong to different classes. We define this\ncharacterization problem as one of partitioning the attributes into as many\ngroups as the number of classes, while maximizing the total attributed quality\nscore of all the given subgraphs.\n  We show that our attribute-to-class assignment problem is NP-hard and an\noptimal $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation algorithm exists. We also propose two\ndifferent faster heuristics that are linear-time in the number of attributes\nand subgraphs. Unlike previous work where only attributes were taken into\naccount for characterization, here we exploit both attributes and social ties\n(i.e. graph structure).\n  Through extensive experiments, we compare our proposed algorithms, show\nfindings that agree with human intuition on datasets from Amazon co-purchases,\nCongressional bill sponsorships, and DBLP co-authorships. We also show that our\napproach of characterizing subgraphs is better suited for sense-making than\ndiscriminating classification approaches.\n", "  The recent release of {\\it Planck} data gives access to a full sky coverage\nof the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) lensing potential ($\\phi$).\n  The cross-correlation of these two probes of the large-scale structures in\nthe Universe is a powerful tool for testing cosmological models, especially in\nthe context of the difference between galaxy clusters and CMB for the\nbest-fitting cosmological parameters.\n  However, the tSZ effect maps are highly contaminated by cosmic infra-red\nbackground (CIB) fluctuations.\n  Unlike other astrophysical components, the spatial distribution of CIB varies\nwith frequency.\n  Thus it cannot be completely removed from a tSZ Compton parameter map, which\nis constructed from a linear combination of multiple frequency maps.\n  We have estimated the contamination of the CIB-$\\phi$ correlation in the\ntSZ-$\\phi$ power-spectrum.\n  We considered linear combinations that reconstruct the tSZ Compton parameter\nfrom {\\it Planck} frequency maps.\n  We conclude that even in an optimistic case, the CIB-$\\phi$ contamination is\nsignificant with respect to the tSZ-$\\phi$ signal itself.\n  Consequently, We stress that tSZ-$\\phi$ analyses that are based on Compton\nparameter maps are highly limited by the bias produced by CIB-$\\phi$\ncontamination.\n", "  HD 90386 is a rarely studied bright A2V type Delta Scuti star (V = 6.66 mag).\nIt displays short-term light curve variations which are originated due to\neither a beating phenomenon or a non-periodic variation. In this paper, we\npresented high-precision photometric data of HD 90386 taken by the STEREO\nsatellite between 2007 and 2011 to shed light on its internal structure and\nevolution stage. From the frequency analysis of the four-year data, we detected\nthat HD 90386 had at least six different frequencies between 1 and 15\nc~d$^{-1}$. The most dominant frequencies were found at around 10.25258\nc~d$^{-1}$ (A $\\sim$ 1.92 mmag) and 12.40076 c~d$^{-1}$ (A $\\sim$ 0.61 mmag).\nBased on the ratio between these frequencies, the star was considered as an\novertone pulsator. The variation in pulsation period over 35 years was\ncalculated to be dP/Pdt = 5.39(2) x 10$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Other variabilities at\naround 1.0 c~d$^{-1}$ in the amplitude spectrum of HD90386 were also discussed.\nIn order to explain these variabilities, possible rotational effects and Gamma\nDor type variations were focused. Consequently, depending on the rotation\nvelocity of HD 90386, we speculated that these changes might be related to\nGamma Dor type high-order g-modes shifted to the higher frequencies and that HD\n90386 might be a hybrid star.\n", "  The high-significance measurement of large-scale structure signals enables\ntesting the isotropy of the Universe. The measurement of cosmological\nparameters through the large-scale distribution of matter is now a mature\ndomain. This approach is mainly limited by our knowledge of astrophysical\nprocesses that are used to observe the large-scale structure. However, when we\nassume that these astrophysical processes are the same across the Universe,\nthen it is possible to tightly constrain the isotropy of cosmological\nparameters across the sky. Particularly the X-SZ cross-correlation has been\nshown to be a probe of the large scale structures that has a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio and low bias. For this analysis, we used a localized\nmeasurement of the X-SZ cross-correlation as a test of the cosmological\nparameter isotropy. Using the scatter of the X-SZ cross-correlation across the\nsky, we derive cosmological constraints $\\sigma_{8} \\left( \\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.28\n\\right)^{0.34} = 0.78 \\pm 0.02$ and tight isotropy constraints on the dark\nenergy dipole $\\Delta \\Omega_{\\Lambda} < 0.07$ at 95\\% confidence level.\n", "  Nanolayered lamellae are common structures in nanoscience and nanotechnology,\nbut most are nearly symmetric in layer thickness. Here, we report on the\nstructure and mechanics of highly asymmetric and thermodynamically stable\nsoft--hard lamellar structures self-assembled from optimally designed\nPS1-(PI-b-PS2)3 miktoarm star block copolymers. The remarkable mechanical\nproperties of these strong and ductile PS (polystyrene)-based nanomaterials can\nbe tuned over a broad range by varying the hard layer thickness while\nmaintaining the soft layer thickness constant at 13 nm. Upon deformation, thin\nPS lamellae (\\textless{}100 nm) exhibited kinks and predamaged/damaged grains,\nas well as cavitation in the soft layers. In contrast, deformation of thick\nlamellae (\\textgreater{}100 nm) manifests cavitation in both soft and hard\nnanolayers. In situ tensile-SAXS experiments revealed the evolution of cavities\nduring deformation and confirmed that the damage in such systems reflects both\nplastic deformation by shear and residual cavities. The aspects of the\nmechanics should point to universal deformation behavior in broader classes of\nasymmetric hard--soft lamellar materials, whose properties are just being\nrevealed for versatile applications.\n", "  The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects are produced by the interaction of cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons with the ionized and diffuse gas of\nelectrons inside galaxy clusters integrated along the line of sight. The two\nmain effects are the thermal SZ (tSZ) produced by thermal pressure inside\ngalaxy clusters and the kinetic SZ (kSZ) produce by peculiar motion of galaxy\nclusters compared to CMB rest-frame. The kSZ effect is particularly challenging\nto measure as it follows the same spectral behavior as the CMB, and\nconsequently can not be separated from the CMB using spectral considerations.\nIn this paper, we explore the feasibility of detecting the kSZ through the\ncomputation of the tSZ-CMB-CMB cross-correlation bispectrum for current and\nfuture CMB experiments. We conclude that next generation of CMB experiments\nwill offer the possibility to detect at high S/N the tSZ-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum.\nThis measurement will constraints the intra-cluster dynamics and the velocity\nfield of galaxy cluster that is extremely sensitive to the growth rate of\nstructures and thus to dark energy properties. Additionally, we also\ndemonstrate that the tSZ-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum can be used to break the\ndegeneracies between the mass-observable relation and the cosmological\nparameters to set tight constraints, up to 4\\%, on the $Y-M$ relation\ncalibration.\n", "  Advances in GNC, particularly from miniaturized control electronics,\nreaction-wheels and attitude determination sensors make it possible to design\nsurface probes and small robots to perform surface exploration and science on\nlow-gravity environments. These robots would use their reaction wheels to roll,\nhop and tumble over rugged surfaces. These robots could provide 'Google\nStreetview' quality images of off-world surfaces and perform some unique\nscience using penetrometers. These systems can be powered by high-efficiency\nfuel cells that operate at 60-65 % and utilize hydrogen and oxygen electrolyzed\nfrom water. However, one of the major challenges that prevent these probes and\nrobots from performing long duration surface exploration and science is thermal\ndesign and control. In the inner solar system, during the day time, there is\noften enough solar-insolation to keep these robots warm and power these\ndevices, but during eclipse the temperatures falls well below storage\ntemperature. We have developed a thermal control system that utilizes chemicals\nto store and dispense heat when needed. The system takes waste products, such\nas water from these robots and transfers them to a thermochemical storage\nsystem. These thermochemical storage systems when mixed with water (a waste\nproduct from a PEM fuel cell) releases heat. Under eclipse, the heat from the\nthermochemical storage system is released to keep the probe warm enough to\nsurvive. In sunlight, solar photovoltaics are used to electrolyze the water and\nreheat the thermochemical storage system to release the water. Our research has\nshowed thermochemical storage systems are a feasible solution for use on\nsurface probes and robots for applications on the Moon, Mars and asteroids.\n", "  Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a fast-emerging water desalination\ntechnology in which a small cell voltage of ~1 V across porous carbon\nelectrodes removes salt from feedwaters via electrosorption. In flow-through\nelectrode (FTE) CDI cell architecture, feedwater is pumped through macropores\nor laser perforated channels in porous electrodes, enabling highly compact\ncells with parallel flow and electric field, as well as rapid salt removal. We\nhere present a one-dimensional model describing water desalination by FTE CDI,\nand a comparison to data from a custom-built experimental cell. The model\nemploys simple cell boundary conditions derived via scaling arguments. We show\ngood model-to-data fits with reasonable values for fitting parameters such as\nthe Stern layer capacitance, micropore volume, and attraction energy. Thus, we\ndemonstrate that from an engineering modeling perspective, an FTE CDI cell may\nbe described with simpler one-dimensional models, unlike more typical\nflow-between electrodes architecture where 2D models are required.\n", "  Structural characterization of metalloporphyrins in complex systems such as\nnative hydrocarbons is in the focus of scientific and industrial interests\nsince many years. We describe electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) of\ncrude oil from the well without any additional sample treatment (i.e., in the\nnative environment) in the magnetic field of about 3.4 T and temperature of 50\nK by applying microwave pulses at 94 GHz (W-band) and radiofrequency pulses at\nnear the proton Larmor frequencies of 144 MHz to probe the paramagnetic\nvanadyls. By means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ENDOR\nfeatures are explained and ascribed to certain vanadyl porhyrin structural\nforms known to be present in crude oil.\n", "  Exploration of asteroids and small-bodies can provide valuable insight into\nthe origins of the solar system, into the origins of Earth and the origins of\nthe building blocks of life. However, the low-gravity and unknown surface\nconditions of asteroids presents a daunting challenge for surface exploration,\nmanipulation and for resource processing. This has resulted in the loss of\nseveral landers or shortened missions. Fundamental studies are required to\nobtain better readings of the material surface properties and physical models\nof these small bodies. The Asteroid Origins Satellite 1 (AOSAT 1) is a CubeSat\ncentrifuge laboratory that spins at up to 4 rpm to simulate the milligravity\nconditions of sub 1 km asteroids. Such a laboratory will help to de-risk\ndevelopment and testing of landing and resource processing technology for\nasteroids. Inside the laboratory are crushed meteorites, the remains of\nasteroids. The laboratory is equipped with cameras and actuators to perform a\nseries of science experiments to better understand material properties and\nasteroid surface physics. These results will help to improve our physics models\nof asteroids. The CubeSat has been designed to be low-cost and contains 3-axis\nmagnetorquers and a single reaction-wheel to induce spin. In our work, we first\nanalyze how the attitude control system will de-tumble the spacecraft after\ndeployment. Further analysis has been conducted to analyze the impact and\nstability of the attitude control system to shifting mass (crushed meteorites)\ninside the spacecraft as its spinning in its centrifuge mode. AOSAT 1 will be\nthe first in a series of low-cost CubeSat centrifuges that will be launched\nsetting the stage for a larger, permanent, on-orbit centrifuge laboratory for\nexperiments in planetary science, life sciences and manufacturing.\n", "  In this paper, we propose to control the strength of phase-locking between\ntwo dipolarly coupled vortex based spin-torque nano-oscillators by placing an\nintermediate oscillator between them. We show through micromagnetic simulations\nthat the strength of phase-locking can be largely tuned by a slight variation\nof current in the intermediate oscillator. We develop simplified numerical\nsimulations based on analytical expressions of the vortex core trajectories\nthat will be useful for investigating large arrays of densely packed\nspin-torque oscillators interacting through their stray fields.\n", "  For a series of Markov processes we prove stochastic duality relations with\nduality functions given by orthogonal polynomials. This means that expectations\nwith respect to the original process (which evolves the variable of the\northogonal polynomial) can be studied via expectations with respect to the dual\nprocess (which evolves the index of the polynomial). The set of processes\ninclude interacting particle systems, such as the exclusion process, the\ninclusion process and independent random walkers, as well as interacting\ndiffusions and redistribution models of Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti type. Duality\nfunctions are given in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials, both of\ndiscrete and continuous variable, and the measure in the orthogonality relation\ncoincides with the process stationary measure.\n", "  In the spirit of the Composite Standard Model (CSM) we look at the effect of\n$H$, $Z_L$ compositeness on $ZH$ production in gluon-gluon and photon-photon\ncollisions. Because they would perturb the basic cancellations occuring in SM\namplitudes, such compositeness effects would lead to spectacular modifications\nof the energy dependence of the amplitudes and cross sections. We illustrate\nthis fact by introducing $H$, $Z_L$ test form factors and computing the\ncorresponding differential cross section and the fraction of longitudinal $Z_L$\nproduction.\n", "  Coronal X-ray sources (CXSs) are phenomenon very often occurring in solar\nflares regardless of a flare size, duration or power. The nature of the sources\nwas difficult to uncover for many years. It seems that at last, combining data\nfrom RHESSI and SDO/AIA, there is a unprecedented possibility to 'look inside'\nCXSs and to answer the questions about their formation, evolution and\nstructure. We present a study of a CXS of the SOL2011-10-22T11:10 long-duration\nflare observed simultaneously with RHESSI and SDO/AIA. We focus our attention\non the following questions: What was responsible for the CXS presence and long\nduration? Was there any fine structure in the CXS? Available data enables us to\nstudy a relation between the CXS and structures observed in EUV during the\ndecay phase of the flare. X-ray emission recorded by RHESSI during the decay\nphase of the flare came from about 10 MK hot CXS. The source was observable for\n5 hours. This long presence of the source could be supported by magnetic\nreconnection ongoing during the decay phase. Supra-arcade downflows, which are\nconsidered to be a manifestation of magnetic reconnection, were observed at the\nsame time as the CXS. The source was co-spatial with the part of the hot\nsupra-arcade region that had the highest emission measure and simultaneously\nthe temperature within the range of RHESSI thermal-response. However, while the\nsupra-arcade region was a dynamic region consisting of small-scale structures,\nthe CXS seemed to be smooth, structureless. We run simulations using real and\nsynthetic RHESSI data, but we did not find any strong evidence that the CXS had\nany small-scale structure.\n", "  We present a direct comparison between resonant terahertz (THz) and\nnonresonant impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) excitation of\nphonon-polaritons in ferroelectric lithium niobate. THz excitation offers\nadvantages of selectively driving only the forward propagating phonon-polariton\nmode to exceedingly high amplitudes, without complications due to nonlinear\nprocesses at the high 800 nm pump fluences used in Raman excitation. At\npeak-to-peak THz electric field strengths exceeding 1 MV/cm, the ferroelectric\nlattice is driven into the anharmonic regime, allowing experimental\ndetermination of the shape of the potential energy surface.\n", "  Collapse models possibly suggest the need for a better understanding of the\nstructure of space-time. We argue that physical space, and space-time, are\nemergent features of the Universe, which arise as a result of dynamical\ncollapse of the wave function. The starting point for this argument is the\nobservation that classical time is external to quantum theory, and there ought\nto exist an equivalent reformulation which does not refer to classical time. We\npropose such a reformulation, based on a non-commutative special relativity. In\nthe spirit of Trace Dynamics, the reformulation is arrived at, as a statistical\nthermodynamics of an underlying classical dynamics in which matter and\nnon-commuting space-time degrees of freedom are matrices obeying arbitrary\ncommutation relations. Inevitable statistical fluctuations around equilibrium\ncan explain the emergence of classical matter fields and classical space-time,\nin the limit in which the universe is dominated by macroscopic objects. The\nunderlying non-commutative structure of space-time also helps understand better\nthe peculiar nature of quantum non-locality, where the effect of wave-function\ncollapse in entangled systems is felt across space-like separations.\n", "  The resonance frequency of the system is found and the linear gain is derived\nfor the odd harmonics of this frequency. Averaging of the gain is carried out\nover the initial distribution of electrons in a transverse cross section of the\nbeam. Estimates are obtained of the maximum lasing frequency and of the gain at\nthis frequency\n", "  Using water/salty-water laboratory experiments}, we investigate the mechanism\nof erosion by a turbulent jet impinging on a density interface, for moderate\nReynolds and Froude numbers. Contrary to previous models involving baroclinic\ninstabilities, we show that the entrainment is driven by interfacial gravity\nwaves, which break and induce mixing. The waves are generated by the turbulent\nfluctuations of the jet and are amplified by a mechanism of wave-induced stress\n. Based on the physical observations, we introduce a scaling model which varies\ncontinuously from the $Fr_i^3$ to the $Fr_i$ power law from small to large\nFroude numbers, in agreement with some of the previous laboratory data.\n", "  While Fabry-P\\'erot resonances and Moir\\'e superlattices are intensively\nstudied in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), the two effects have not\nbeen discussed in their coexistence. Here we investigate the FP oscillations in\na ballistic pnp-junctions in the presence and absence of a Moir\\'e\nsuperlattice. First, we address the effect of the smoothness of the confining\npotential on the visibility of the FP resonances and carefully map the\nevolution of the FP cavity size as a function of densities in and outside the\ncavity in the absence of a superlattice, when the cavity is bound by regular\npn-junctions. Using a sample with a Moir\\'e superlattice, we next show that a\nFP cavity can also be formed by interfaces that mimic a pn-junction, but are\ndefined through a satellite Dirac point due to the superlattice. We carefully\nanalyse the FP resonances, which can provide insight into the\nband-reconstruction due to the superlattice.\n", "  The High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will provide the unique opportunity to\nexplore the nature of physics beyond the Standard Model of strong and\nelectroweak interactions. Highly selective first-level triggers are essential\nfor the physics programme of the ATLAS experiment at HL-LHC, where the\ninstantaneous luminosity will exceed the instantaneous LHC Run 1 luminosity by\nabout an order of magnitude. The ATLAS first-level muon trigger rate is\ndominated by low momentum muons, which are accepted because of the moderate\nmomentum resolution of the RPC and TGC trigger chambers. This limitation can be\novercome by exploiting the data of the precision Muon Drift-Tube (MDT) chambers\nin the first-level trigger decision. This requires continuous fast transfer of\nthe MDT hits to the off-detector trigger logic and fast track reconstruction\nalgorithms. The reduction of the muon trigger rate achievable with the proposed\nnew trigger concept, the performance of a novel fast track reconstruction\nalgorithm, and the first hardware demonstration of the scheme with muon\ntestbeam data taken at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility are discussed.\n", "  We can probe observationally and reproduce theoretically intricate properties\nof the Crab Nebula nearest to the pulsar - The Inner Knot. The tiny knot is\nindeed a bright spot on the surface of a quasi-stationary magnetic relativistic\nshock that accelerates particles. It is required that the part of the wind that\nproduces the Inner Knot has low magnetization; thus, it is not a site of\ngamma-ray flares.\n  We develop a model of particle acceleration during explosive reconnection\nevents in relativistic highly magnetized plasma and apply the model to explain\nthe Crab gamma-ray flares. Particles are efficiently accelerated by\ncharge-starved DC-type electric fields during initial stages of magnetic flux\nmerges. By implication, the magnetic reconnection is an important, and possibly\ndominant process of particle acceleration in high energy astrophysical sources.\n", "  Modified structures of SAPO-34 were prepared using polyethylene glycol as the\nmesopores generating agent. The synthesized catalysts were applied in\nmethanol-to-olefins (MTO) process. All modified synthesized catalysts were\ncharacterized via XRD, XRF, FESEM, FTIR, N2 adsorption-desorption techniques,\nand temperature-programmed NH3 desorption and they were compared with\nconventional microporous SAPO-34. Introduction of non-ionic PEG capping agent\naffected the degree of homogeneity and integrity of the synthesis media and\nthus reduced the number of nuclei and order of coordination structures\nresulting in larger and less crystalline particles compared with the\nconventional sample. During the calcination process, decomposition of absorbed\nPEG moieties among the piled up SAPO patches formed a great portion of tuned\nmesopores into the microporous matrix. These tailored mesopores were served as\nauxiliary diffusion pathways in MTO reaction. The effects of molecular weight\nof PEG and PEG/Al molar ratio on the properties of the synthesized materials\nwere investigated in order to optimize their MTO reaction performance. It was\nrevealed that both of these two parameters can significantly change the\nstructural composition and physicochemical properties of resultant products.\nUsing PEG with MW of 6000 has led to the formation of RHO and CHA structural\nframeworks i.e. DNL-6 and SAPO-34, simultaneously, while addition of PEG with\nMW of 4000 resulted the formation of pure SAPO-34 phase. Altering the PEG/Al\nmolar ratio in the precursor significantly influenced the porosity and acidity\nof the synthesized silicoaluminophosphate products. SAPO-34 impregnated with\nPEG molecular weight of 4000 and PEG/Al molar ratio of 0.0125 showed superior\ncatalytic stability in MTO reaction because of the tuned bi-modal porosity and\ntailored acidity pattern.\n", "  Magnetoferritin, a synthetic derivate of iron storage protein - ferritin, has\nbeen synthesized with different iron oxide loading values. Small-angle neutron\nscattering experiments were applied to study the structure of magnetoferritin\nsolutions using contrast variation method by varying the light to heavy water\nratio of the solvent. Higher iron loading leads to increasing of the neutron\nscattering length density of magnetoferritin and also to the increase of the\npolydispersity of complexes. The formation of the magnetic core and the\nvariation of the protein shell structure upon iron loading are concluded.\n", "  Let $X_{m} = G_{1}\\ldots G_{m}$ denote the product of $m$ independent random\nmatrices of size $N \\times N$, with each matrix in the product consisting of\nindependent standard Gaussian variables. Denoting by $N_{\\mathbb{R}}(m)$ the\ntotal number of real eigenvalues of $X_{m}$, we show that for $m$ fixed\n\\begin{equation*} \\mathbb{E}(N_{\\mathbb{R}}(m)) =\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2Nm}{\\pi}}+O(\\log(N)), \\qquad N \\to \\infty. \\end{equation*} This\ngeneralizes a well-known result of Edelman et al. \\cite{EKS94} to all $m>1$.\nFurthermore, we show that the normalized global density of real eigenvalues\nconverges weakly in expectation to the density of the random variable\n$|U|^{m}B$ where $U$ is uniform on $[-1,1]$ and $B$ is Bernoulli on $\\{-1,1\\}$.\nThis proves a conjecture of Forrester and Ipsen \\cite{FI16}. The results are\nobtained by the asymptotic analysis of a certain Meijer G-function.\n", "  NIF experiments with Be capsules have followed a path of the highly\nsuccessful \"high-foot\" CH capsules. Several keyhole and ConA targets preceeded\na DT layered shot. In addition to backscatter subtraction, laser drive\nmultipliers were needed to match observed X-ray drives. Those for the picket\n(0.95), trough (1.0) and second pulse (0.80) were determined by VISAR\nmeasurements. The time dependence of the Dante total x-ray flux and its\nfraction > 1.8 keV reflect the time dependence of the multipliers. A two step\ndrive multiplier for the main pulse can match implosion times, but Dante\nmeasurements suggest the drive multiplier must increase late in time. With a\nsingle set of time dependent, multi-level multipliers the Dante data are well\nmatched. These same third pulse drive multipliers also match the implosion\ntimes and Dante signals for two CH capsule DT. One discrepancy in the\ncalculations is the X-ray flux in the picket. Calculations over-estimate the\nflux > 1.8 keV by a factor of ~100, while getting the total flux correctly.\nThese harder X-rays cause an expansion of the Be/fuel interface of 2-3 km/s\nbefore the arrival of the first shock. VISAR measurements show only 0.2 to 0.3\nkm/s. The X-ray drive on the DT Be capsule was further degraded by a random\ndecrease of 9% in the total picket flux. This small change caused the capsule\nfuel to change from an adiabat of 1.8 to 2.3 by mistiming of the first and\nsecond shocks. With this shock tuning and adjustments to the calculation, the\nfirst NIF Be capsule implosion achieved 29% of calculated yield, comparable to\nthe CH DT capsules of 68% and 21%. Inclusion of a large M1 asymmetry in the DT\nice layer and mixing from instability growth may help explain this final\ndegradation. In summary when driven similarly the Be capsules performed like CH\ncapsules. Performance degradation for both seems to be dominated by drive and\ncapsule asymmetries.\n", "  I present a first determination of a set of collinear fragmentation functions\nof charged pions using the NNPDF methodology. The analysis is based on a wide\nset of single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data, including recent\nmeasurements from $B$-factory experiments, and is performed up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics.\nI discuss the results of the fits, highlighting their quality in the\ndescription of the data, their stability upon the inclusion of higher-order\ncorrections, and their comparison to other sets of fragmentation functions.\n", "  While the recent discovery of the Cepheid variables in the Virgo cluster\ngalaxies puts additional support for the Hubble constant $H_0 \\sim\n80$km/sec/Mpc, a relatively lower value $H_0 \\sim 50$km/sec/Mpc is suggested by\nother distance indicators based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the\ngravitational lens which probe the universe at higher redshifts $z=(0.1\\sim\n1)$. In order to reconcile the possible discrepancy between the estimates of\nthe Hubble constants from nearby galaxy samples and high-redshift clusters, we\nconsider a model of locally open universe embedded in the spatially flat\nuniverse. We find analytic expressions for the lower limit on the global Hubble\nconstant $\\hg$, and the upper limit on the age of the universe with a given\nvalue for the Hubble constant $\\hl$ in the local universe. We conclude that it\nis quite unlikely that the above difference in the estimates of the Hubble\nconstant is explained within the framework of the gravitational instability\npicture.\n", "  The pseudo-spectral method is proposed for following the evolution of density\nand velocity fluctuations at the weakly non-linear stage in the expanding\nuniverse with a good accuracy. In this method, the evolution of density and\nvelocity fluctuations is integrated in the Fourier Space with using FFT. This\nmethod is very useful to investigate accurately the non-linear dynamics in the\nweakly non-linear regime. Because the pseudo-spectral method works directly in\nthe Fourier space, it should be especially useful for examining behavior in the\nFourier domain, for an example, the effects of the non-linear coupling of\ndifferent wave modes on the evolution of the power spectrum. I show the results\nof this analysis both in one and three dimensional systems.\n", "  As is well-known, in the conventional formulation of Bogoliubov's theory of\nan interacting Bose gas, the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is written as a decoupled\nsum of contributions from different momenta of the form $\\hat{H} = \\sum_{k\\neq\n0}\\hat{H}_{k}$. Then, each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$ is\ndiagonalized separately, and the resulting ground state wavefunction of the\ntotal Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is written as a simple product of the ground state\nwavefunctions of each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$. We argue\nthat, from a number-conserving perspective, this diagonalization method may not\nbe adequate since the true Hilbert spaces where the Hamiltonians\n${\\hat{H}_{k}}$ should be diagonalized all have the ${k}=0$ state in common,\nand hence the ground state wavefunction of the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ may\n{not} be written as a simple product of the ground state wavefunctions of the\n$\\hat{H}_{k}$'s. In this paper, we give a thorough review of Bogoliubov's\nmethod, and discuss a variational and number-conserving formulation of this\ntheory in which the ${k}=0$ state is restored to the Hilbert space of the\ninteracting gas, and where, instead of diagonalizing the Hamiltonians\n$\\hat{H}_{k}$ separately, we diagonalize the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ as a\nwhole. When this is done, we find that the ground state energy is lowered below\nthe Bogoliubov result, and the depletion of bosons is significantly reduced\nwith respect to the one obtained in the number non-conserving treatment. We\nalso find that the spectrum of the usual $\\alpha_{k}$ excitations of\nBogoliubov's method changes from a gapless one, as predicted by the standard,\nnumber non-conserving formulation of this theory, to one which exhibits a\nfinite gap in the $k\\to 0$ limit.\n", "  In the Fractional Quantum Hall state, we introduce a bi-local mean field and\nget vortex mean field solutions. Rotational invariance is imposed and the\nsolution is constructed by means of numerical self-consistent method. It is\nshown that vortex has a fractional charge, a fractional angular momentum and a\nmagnetic field dependent energy. In $\\nu=1/3$ state, we get finite energy gap\nat $B=10,15,20[T]$. We find that the gap vanishes at $B=5.5[T]$ and becomes\nnegative below it. The uniform mean field becomes unstable toward vortex pair\nproduction below $B=5.5[T]$.\n", "  We review recent results obtained for a class of one-dimensional quantum\nmodels with $1/r^2$ long-range interaction. Based on the asymptotic\nBethe-ansatz solution and conformal field theory, we study critical properties\nof the continuum boson model, the SU($\\nu$) spin chain, the OSp($\\nu$,1)\nsupersymmetric {\\it t-J} model, and a new hierarchy of models related to the\nfractional quantum Hall effect. We further investigate the class of $1/r^2$\nmodels with harmonic confinement by means of a newly proposed method of the\nrenormalized-harmonic oscillator solution.\n", "  We present detailed discussions on a new approach we proposed in a previous\npaper to numerically study quantum spin systems. This method, which we will\ncall re-structuring method hereafter, is based on rearrangement of intermediate\nstates in the path integral formulation. We observed our approach brings\nremarkable improvement in the negative sign problem when applied to\none-dimensional quantum spin $1/2$ system with next-to-nearest neighbor\ninteractions. In this paper we add some descriptions on our method and show\nresults from analyses by the exact diagonalization and by the transfer matrix\nmethod of the system on a small chain. These results also indicate that our\nmethod works quite effectively.\n", "  Applying a bi-local mean field approximation to the fractional quantum Hall\nstate of $\\nu=1/3$, we obtain charged and neutral vortex mean field solutions\nnumerically. We calculate the mean field energy and the fluctuation\ncorrections. The charged vortex has a fractional charge and a fractional\nangular momentum. The neutral vortex is a bound state of two charged vortices\nand has a zero charge and a zero angular momentum. The creation energy of the\nneutral vortex is about a half of the pair creation energy of two charged\nvortices. The magnetic field dependence of the gap energy agrees with the\nLaughlin's quasiparticle gap energy.\n", "  We propose a new algorithm which works effectively in global updates in Monte\nCarlo study. We apply it to the quantum spin chain with next-nearest-neighbor\ninteractions. We observe that Monte Carlo results are in excellent agreement\nwith numerically exact ones obtained by the transfer matrix method.\n", "  On the purpose of studying the effect of long-range Coulomb-interaction in\nstrongly correlated electronic systems we bring in as its representative the\nnearest-neighbor repulsion ($v$) in addition to the on-site repulsion ($u$) and\nshall investigate the possibility of the superconducting transition of carriers\ndoped into the charge-density wave (CDW) state expected for $v\\,>\\,u/4$ in\n2-dimensional square lattice. We shall see that strongly correlated hopping\nprocesses of doped carriers make the systems superconducting. The favored\nsuperconducting phase is of extended s-wave symmetry, and $T_{c} \\sim$100K is\nshown to easily be attained near the half-filling.\n", "  We discuss the asymptotic behavior of regulated field commutators for\nlinearly polarized, cylindrically symmetric gravitational waves and the\nmathematical techniques needed for this analysis. We concentrate our attention\non the effects brought about by the introduction of a physical cut-off in the\nstudy of the microcausality of the model and describe how the different\nphysically relevant regimes are affected by its presence. Specifically we\ndiscuss how genuine quantum gravity effects can be disentangled from those\noriginating in the introduction of a regulator.\n"]}
