In the fully\ndeveloped nonlinear regime, the IGM will evolve into the state of turbulence,\ncontaining strong and curved shocks, vorticity and complex structures.\nTurbulence would lead to the density and velocity fields of the IGM to be\ndifferent from those of underlying collisionless dark matter. Consequently, the\nbaryon fraction f_b will deviate from its cosmic mean . We study these\nphenomena with simulation samples produced by the weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) hybrid cosmological hydrodynamic/N-body code, which is\neffective of capturing shocks and complex structures. We find that the\ndistribution of baryon fraction is highly nonuniform on scales from hundreds\nkpc to a few of Mpc, and f_b varies from as low as 1% to a few times of the\ncosmic mean. We further show that the turbulence pressure in the IGM is weakly\nscale-dependent and comparable to the gravitational energy density of halos\nwith mass around 10^11 h-1 M\\odot . The baryon fraction in halos with mass\nequal to or smaller than 10^11 h^-1 M\\odot should be substantially lower than\nf_b^cosmic. Numerical results show that f_b is decreasing from 0.8 f_b^cosmic\nat halo mass scales around 10^12 h^-1 M\\odot to 0.3f_b^cosmic at 10^11 h^-1\nM\\odot and shows further decrease when halo mass is less than 10^11 h^-1\nM\\odot. The strong mass dependence of f_b is similar to the observed results.\n  Although the simulated f_b in halos are higher than the observed value by a\nfactor of 2, the turbulence of the\n  IGM should be an important dynamical reason leading to the remarkable missing\nof baryonic matter in halos with mass \\leq 10^12 h^-1 M\\odot.\n", "  We present IntU package for Mathematica computer algebra system. The\npresented package performs a symbolic integration of polynomial functions over\nthe unitary group with respect to unique normalized Haar measure. We describe a\nnumber of special cases which can be used to optimize the calculation speed for\nsome classes of integrals. We also provide some examples of usage of the\npresented package.\n", "  We study the Poincare polynomials of all known Calabi-Yau three-folds as\nconstrained polynomials of Littlewood type, thus generalising the well-known\ninvestigation into the distribution of the Euler characteristic and Hodge\nnumbers. We find interesting fractal behaviour in the roots of these\npolynomials in relation to the existence of isometries, distribution versus\ntypicality, and mirror symmetry.\n", "  An introductory theory of frames on finite dimensional quaternion Hilbert\nspaces is demonstrated along the lines of their complex counterpart.\n", "  Let X be a compact complex manifold equipped with a smooth (but not\nnecessarily positive) closed form theta of one-one type. By a well-known\nenvelope construction this data determines a canonical theta-psh function u\nwhich is not two times differentiable, in general. We introduce a family of\nregularizations of u, parametrized by a positive number beta, defined as the\nsmooth solutions of complex Monge-Ampere equations of Aubin-Yau type. It is\nshown that, as beta tends to infinity, the regularizations converge to the\nenvelope u in the strongest possible Holder sense. A generalization of this\nresult to the case of a nef and big cohomology class is also obtained. As a\nconsequence new PDE proofs are obtained for the regularity results for\nenvelopes in [14] (which, however, are weaker than the results in [14] in the\ncase of a non-nef big class). Applications to the regularization problem for\nquasi-psh functions and geodesic rays in the closure of the space of Kahler\nmetrics are given. As briefly explained there is a statistical mechanical\nmotivation for this regularization procedure, where beta appears as the inverse\ntemperature. This point of view also leads to an interpretation of the\nregularizations as transcendental Bergman metrics.\n", "  We use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, run by two fixed\ngrid codes, to investigate the properties of solenoidal and dilatational\nmotions of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and the impact of numerical\nviscosity on turbulence in a LCDM universe. The codes differ only in the\nspatial difference discretization. We find that (1) The vortical motion grows\nrapidly since $z=2$, and reaches $\\sim 10 km/s -90 km/s$ at $z=0$. Meanwhile,\nthe small-scale compressive ratio $r_{CS}$ drops from 0.84 to 0.47, indicating\ncomparable vortical and compressive motions at present. (2) Power spectra of\nthe solenoidal velocity possess two regimes, $\\propto k^{-0.89}$ and $\\propto\nk^{-2.02}$, while the total and dilatational velocity follow the scaling\n$k^{-1.88}$ and $k^{-2.20}$ respectively in the turbulent range. The IGM\nturbulence may contain two distinct phases, the supersonic and post-supersonic\nphases. (3) The non-thermal pressure support, measured by the vortical kinetic\nenergy, is comparable with the thermal pressure for $\\rho_b \\simeq 10-100$, or\n$T <10^{5.5} K$ at $z=0.0$. The deviation of the baryon fraction from the\ncosmic mean shows a preliminary positive correlation with the turbulence\npressure support. (4) A relatively higher numerical viscosity would dissipate\nboth the compressive and vortical motions of the IGM into thermal energy more\neffectively, resulting in less developed vorticity, remarkably shortened\ninertial range, and leading to non-negligible uncertainty in the thermal\nhistory of gas accretion. Shocks in regions outside of clusters are\nsignificantly suppressed by numerical viscosity since $z=2$, which may directly\ncause the different levels of turbulence between two codes.\n", "  We introduce a method to compute particle detector transition probability in\nspacetime regions of general curved spacetimes provided that the curvature is\nnot above a maximum threshold. In particular we use this method to compare the\nresponse of two detectors, one in a spherically symmetric gravitational field\nand the other one in Rindler spacetime to compare the Unruh and Hawking\neffects: We study the vacuum response of a detector freely falling through a\nstationary cavity in a Schwarzschild background as compared with the response\nof an equivalently accelerated detector traveling through an inertial cavity in\nthe absence of curvature. We find that as we set the cavity in further radiuses\nfrom the black hole, the thermal radiation measured by the detector approaches\nthe quantity recorded by the detector in Rindler background showing in which\nway and at what scales the equivalent principle is recovered in the\nHawking-Unruh effect. I.e. when the Hawking effect in a Schwarzschild\nbackground becomes equivalent to the Unruh effect in Rindler spacetime.\n", "  We classify discrete-rotation symmetric topological crystalline\nsuperconductors (TCS) in two dimensions and provide the criteria for a zero\nenergy Majorana bound state (MBS) to be present at composite defects made from\nmagnetic flux, dislocations, and disclinations. In addition to the Chern number\nthat encodes chirality, discrete rotation symmetry further divides TCS into\ndistinct stable topological classes according to the rotation eigenspectrum of\nBogoliubov-de Gennes quasi-particles. Conical crystalline defects are shown to\nbe able to accommodate robust MBS when a certain combination of these bulk\ntopological invariants is non-trivial as dictated by the index theorems proved\nwithin. The number parity of MBS is counted by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued index\nthat solely depends on the disclination and the topological class of the TCS.\nWe also discuss the implications for corner-bound Majorana modes on the\nboundary of topological crystalline superconductors.\n", "  Renormalization of massless Feynman amplitudes in $x$-space is reexamined\nhere, using almost exclusively real-variable methods. We compute a wealth of\nconcrete examples by means of recursive extension of distributions. This allows\nus to show perturbative expansions for the four-point and two-point functions\nat several loop order. To deal with internal vertices, we expound and expand on\nconvolution theory for log-homogeneous distributions. The approach has much in\ncommon with differential renormalization as given by Freedman, Johnson and\nLatorre; but differs in important details.\n", "  We resolve the space-time canonical variables of the relativistic point\nparticle into inner products of Weyl spinors with components in a Clifford\nalgebra and find that these spinors themselves form a canonical system with\ngeneralized Poisson brackets. For N particles, the inner products of their\nClifford coordinates and momenta form two NxN Hermitian matrices X and P which\ntransform under a U(N) symmetry in the generating algebra. This is used as a\nstarting point for defining matrix mechanics for a point particle in Clifford\nspace. Next we consider the string. The Lorentz metric induces a metric and a\nscalar on the world sheet which we represent by a Jackiw-Teitelboim term in the\naction. The string is described by a polymomenta canonical system and we find\nthe wave solutions to the classical equations of motion for a flat world sheet.\nFinally, we show that the SL(2.C) charge and space-time momentum of the\nquantized string satisfy the Poincare algebra.\n", "  The family of one-dimensional localized solutions to dissipative nonlinear\nequations includes a variety of objects such as sources, sinks, shocks (kinks),\nand pulses. These states are in general accompanied by nontrivial density\ncurrents, which are not necessarily related to the movement of the object\nitself. We investigate the existence and physical properties of sink-type\nsolutions in nonresonantly pumped exciton-polariton condensates modeled by an\nopen-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While sinks possess density\nprofiles similar to bright solitons, they are qualitatively different objects\nas they exist in the case of repulsive interactions and represent a\nheteroclinic solution. We show that sinks can be created in realistic systems\nwith appropriately designed pumping profiles. We also conclude that in\ntwo-dimensional configurations, due to the proliferation of vortices, sinks do\nnot appear.\n", "  We report a partial-wave analysis of new data on the double-polarization\nvariable $E$ for the reactions $\\gamma p\\to \\pi^+ n$ and $\\gamma p\\to \\pi^0 p$\nand of further data published earlier. The analysis within the Bonn-Gatchina\n(BnGa) formalism reveals evidence for a poorly known baryon resonance, the\none-star $\\Delta(2200)7/2^-$. This is the lowest-mass $\\Delta^*$ resonance with\nspin-parity $J^P=7/2^-$. Its mass is significantly higher than the mass of its\nparity partner $\\Delta(1950)7/2^+$ which is the lowest-mass $\\Delta^*$\nresonance with spin-parity $J^P=7/2^+$. It has been suggested that chiral\nsymmetry might be restored in the high-mass region of hadron excitations, and\nthat these two resonances should be degenerate in mass. Our findings are in\nconflict with this prediction.\n", "  The vortical motions of the baryonic gas residing in large scale structures\nare investigated by cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Proceeding in the\nformation of the cosmic web, the vortical motions of baryonic matter are pumped\nup by baroclinity in two stages, i.e., the formation of sheets, and filaments.\nThe mean curl velocity are about $< 1$, 1-10, 10-150, 5-50 km/s in voids,\nsheets, filaments and knots at $z=0$, respectively. The scaling of the vortical\nvelocity of gas can be well described by the She-Leveque hierarchical\nturbulence model in the range of $l<0.65(1.50) h^{-1}$ Mpc in simulation of box\nsize 25(100) $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The fractal Hausdorff dimension of vortical motions,\n$d$, revealed by velocity structure functions, is $\\sim 2.1-2.3$($\\sim\n1.8-2.1$). It is slightly larger than the fractal dimension of mass\ndistribution in filaments, $\\textit{D}^f \\sim 1.9-2.2$, and smaller than the\nfractal dimension of sheets, $\\textit{D}^s \\sim 2.4-2.7$. The vortical kinetic\nenergy of baryonic gas is mainly transported by filaments. Both the scaling of\nmass distribution and vortical velocity increments show distinctive transition\nat the turning scale of $\\sim 0.65(1.50) h^{-1}$ Mpc, which may be closely\nrelated to the characteristic radius of density filaments.\n", "  In this paper we define the analogue of Calabi--Yau geometry for generic\n$D=4$, $\\mathcal{N}=2$ flux backgrounds in type II supergravity and M-theory.\nWe show that solutions of the Killing spinor equations are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with integrable, globally defined structures in\n$E_{7(7)}\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$ generalised geometry. Such \"exceptional\nCalabi--Yau\" geometries are determined by two generalised objects that\nparametrise hyper- and vector-multiplet degrees of freedom and generalise\nconventional complex, symplectic and hyper-Kahler geometries. The integrability\nconditions for both hyper- and vector-multiplet structures are given by the\nvanishing of moment maps for the \"generalised diffeomorphism group\" of\ndiffeomorphisms combined with gauge transformations. We give a number of\nexplicit examples and discuss the structure of the moduli spaces of solutions.\nWe then extend our construction to $D=5$ and $D=6$ flux backgrounds preserving\neight supercharges, where similar structures appear, and finally discuss the\nanalogous structures in $O(d,d)\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$ generalised geometry.\n", "  Gaussian quantum systems exhibit many explicitly quantum effects but can be\nsimulated classically. Using both the Hilbert space (Koopman) and the\nphase-space (Moyal) formalisms we investigate how robust this classicality is.\nWe find failures of consistency of the dynamics of a hybrid classical-quantum\nsystems from both perspectives. By demanding that no unobservable operators\ncouple to the quantum sector in the Koopmanian formalism, we show that the\nclassical equations of motion act on their quantum counterparts without\nexperiencing any back-reaction, resulting in non-conservation of energy in the\nquantum system. Using the phase-space formalism we study the short time\nevolution of the moment equations of a hybrid classical-Gaussian quantum system\nand observe violations of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation in the quantum\nsector for a broad range of initial conditions. We estimate the time scale for\nthese violations, which is generically rather short. This inconsistency\nindicates that while many explicitly quantum effects can be represented\nclassically, quantum aspects of the system cannot be fully masked. We comment\non the implications of our results for quantum gravity.\n", "  We consider the problem of a quantum particle interacting with $N$ attractive\npoint $\\delta$-interactions in two and three dimensional Riemannian manifolds\nand discuss its some spectral properties. The main aim of this paper is to give\na sufficient condition for the Hamiltonian to have $N$ bound states and give an\nexplicit criterion for it in hyperbolic manifolds $\\mathbb{H}^2$ and\n$\\mathbb{H}^3$. Furthermore, we study the same spectral problem for a\nrelativistic extension of the model on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{H}^2$.\n", "  Using a novel analysis technique, the gluon polarisation in the nucleon is\nre-evaluated using the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry measured in the cross\nsection of semi-inclusive single-hadron muoproduction with photon virtuality\n$Q^2>1~({\\rm GeV}/c)^2$. The data were obtained by the COMPASS experiment at\nCERN using a 160 GeV/$c$ polarised muon beam impinging on a polarised $^6$LiD\ntarget. By analysing the full range in hadron transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T}$,\nthe different $p_{\\rm T}$-dependences of the underlying processes are separated\nusing a neural-network approach. In the absence of pQCD calculations at\nnext-to-leading order in the selected kinematic domain, the gluon polarisation\n$\\Delta g/g$ is evaluated at leading order in pQCD at a hard scale of $\\mu^2=\n\\langle Q^2 \\rangle = 3 ({\\rm GeV}/c)^2$. It is determined in three intervals\nof the nucleon momentum fraction carried by gluons, $x_{\\rm g}$, covering the\nrange $0.04 \\!<\\! x_{ \\rm g}\\! <\\! 0.28$~ and does not exhibit a significant\ndependence on $x_{\\rm g}$. The average over the three intervals, $\\langle\n\\Delta g/g \\rangle = 0.113 \\pm 0.038_{\\rm (stat.)}\\pm 0.036_{\\rm (syst.)}$ at\n$\\langle x_{\\rm g} \\rangle \\approx 0.10$, suggests that the gluon polarisation\nis positive in the measured $x_{\\rm g}$ range.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs boson is both a milestone achievement for the\nStandard Model and an exciting probe of new physics beyond the SM. One of the\nmost important properties of the Higgs is its mass, a number that has proven to\nbe highly constraining for models of new physics, particularly those related to\nthe electroweak hierarchy problem. Perhaps the most extensively studied\nexamples are supersymmetric models, which, while capable of producing a 125 GeV\nHiggs boson with SM-like properties, do so in non-generic parts of their\nparameter spaces. We review the computation of the Higgs mass in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model, in particular the large radiative corrections\nrequired to lift $m_h$ to 125 GeV and their calculation via\nFeynman-diagrammatic and effective field theory techniques. This review is\nintended as an entry point for readers new to the field, and as a summary of\nthe current status, including the existing analytic calculations and\npublicly-available computer codes.\n", "  Recent discovery of neutrino large mixings implies the large mixings in the\ndiagonalizing matrices of $\\bf\\bar 5$ fields in $SU(5)$ grand unified theory\n(GUT), while the diagonalizing matrices of $\\bf 10$ fields of $SU(5)$ are\nexpected to have small mixings like Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. We\ncalculate the predictions of flavor changing nucleon decays (FCND) in $SU(5)$,\n$SO(10)$, and $E_6$ GUT models which have the above features for mixings. We\nfound that FCND can be the main decay mode especially for GUT with higher rank\nunification group. Recent report for $P\\rightarrow \\pi^0\\mu^+$ process implies\n$E_6$ or $SO(10)$ GUT if the signal is from the nucleon decay.\n", "  In this article we provide a systematic experimental method for sorting\nanimals according to socially relevant traits, without assaying them or even\ntagging them individually. Instead, they are repeatedly subjected to\nbehavioural assays in groups, between which the group memberships are\nrearranged, in order to test the effect of many different combinations of\nindividuals on a group-level property or feature. We analyse this method using\na general model for the group feature, and simulate a variety of specific cases\nto track how individuals are sorted in each case. We find that in the case\nwhere the members of a group contribute equally to the group feature, the\nsorting procedure increases the between-group behavioural variation well above\nwhat is expected for groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide\nclass of group feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted\nacross the groups and thus become available for further analysis on how\nindividual properties affect group behaviour. We also show that the\nexperimental data can be used to estimate the individual-level repeatability of\nthe underlying traits.\n", "  The entanglement entropy (EE) has emerged as an important window into the\nstructure of complex quantum states of matter. We analyze the universal part of\nthe EE for gapless systems put on tori in 2d/3d, denoted by $\\chi$. Focusing on\nscale invariant systems, we derive general non-perturbative properties for the\nshape dependence of $\\chi$, and reveal surprising relations to the EE\nassociated with corners in the entangling surface. We obtain closed-form\nexpressions for $\\chi$ in 2d/3d within a model that arises in the study of\nconformal field theories (CFTs), and use them to obtain ansatzes without\nfitting parameters for the 2d/3d free boson CFTs. Our numerical lattice\ncalculations show that the ansatzes are highly accurate. Finally, we discuss\nhow the torus EE can act as a fingerprint of exotic states such as gapless\nquantum spin liquids, e.g. Kitaev's honeycomb model.\n", "  Multi-agent models often describe populations segregated either in the\nphysical space, i.e. subdivided in metapopulations, or in the ecology of\nopinions, i.e. partitioned in echo chambers. Here we show how the interplay\nbetween homophily and social influence controls the emergence of both kinds of\nsegregation in a simple model of mobile agents, endowed with a continuous\nopinion variable. In the model, physical proximity determines a progressive\nconvergence of opinions but differing opinions result in agents moving away\nfrom each others. This feedback between mobility and social dynamics determines\nto the onset of a stable dynamical metapopulation scenario where physically\nseparated groups of like-minded individuals interact with each other through\nthe exchange of agents. The further introduction of confirmation bias in social\ninteractions, defined as the tendency of an individual to favor opinions that\nmatch his own, leads to the emergence of echo chambers where different opinions\ncan coexist also within the same group. We believe that the model may be of\ninterest to researchers investigating the origin of segregation in the offline\nand online world.\n", "  Interference between independent single photons is perhaps the most\nfundamental interaction in quantum optics. It has become increasingly important\nas a tool for optical quantum information science, as one of the rudimentary\nquantum operations, together with photon detection, for generating entanglement\nbetween non-interacting particles. Despite this, demonstrations of large-scale\nphotonic networks involving more than two independent sources of quantum light\nhave been limited due to the difficulty in constructing large arrays of\nhigh-quality single photon sources. Here, we solve the key challenge, reporting\na novel array of more than eighteen near-identical, low-loss, high-purity,\nheralded single photon sources achieved using spontaneous four-wave mixing\n(SFWM) on a silica chip. We verify source quality through a series of heralded\nHong-Ou-Mandel experiments, and further report the experimental three-photon\nextension of the entire Hong-Ou-Mandel interference curves, which map out the\ninterference landscape between three independent single photon sources for the\nfirst time.\n", "  Emergence of an orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP) found in multi-band\ncorrelated systems leads to a non-perturbative obliteration of the Landau Fermi\nliquid in favor of a novel metallic state exhibiting anomalous infra-red\n(branch-cut) continuum features in one- and two-particle responses. We use a\ncombination of $(1)$ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) using the\ncontinuous-time-quantum Monte-Carlo (CTQMC) solver for a two-band Hubbard model\nand $(2)$ analytic arguments from an effective bosonized description to\ninvestigate strange metal features in inelastic neutron scattering studies for\ncuprates. Specifically, restricting our attention to symmetry-unbroken metallic\nphase, we study how emergence of an OSMP leads to qualitatively novel features\nin $(i)$ the dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities, and $(ii)$ phonon\nresponse in the strange metal, in detail. Extinction of the Landau\nquasiparticle pole in the one-electron propagator in the OSMP mirrors the\nemergence of critical liquid-like features in the dynamical spin response. This\nnovel finding also underpins truly anomalous features in phonon dynamics, which\nwe investigate by coupling half-breathing phonons in the specific context of\ncuprates to such a multi-electronic continuum. We find good understanding of\nvarious anomalies encountered in experimental inelastic neutron scattering\nstudies in the near-optimally doped cuprates. We also extend these results in a\nphenomenological way to argue how modification of phonon spectra in underdoped\ncuprates can be reconciled with proposals for a nematic-plus-d-wave charge\nmodulation order in the pseudogap state. We also study the issue of the\ndominant \"pair glue\" contributions to superconductivity, allowing us to\ninterpret recent pump-probe results within a strange metal scenario.\n", "  Lossy compression and clustering fundamentally involve a decision about what\nfeatures are relevant and which are not. The information bottleneck method (IB)\nby Tishby, Pereira, and Bialek formalized this notion as an\ninformation-theoretic optimization problem and proposed an optimal tradeoff\nbetween throwing away as many bits as possible, and selectively keeping those\nthat are most important. In the IB, compression is measure my mutual\ninformation. Here, we introduce an alternative formulation that replaces mutual\ninformation with entropy, which we call the deterministic information\nbottleneck (DIB), that we argue better captures this notion of compression. As\nsuggested by its name, the solution to the DIB problem turns out to be a\ndeterministic encoder, or hard clustering, as opposed to the stochastic\nencoder, or soft clustering, that is optimal under the IB. We compare the IB\nand DIB on synthetic data, showing that the IB and DIB perform similarly in\nterms of the IB cost function, but that the DIB significantly outperforms the\nIB in terms of the DIB cost function. We also empirically find that the DIB\noffers a considerable gain in computational efficiency over the IB, over a\nrange of convergence parameters. Our derivation of the DIB also suggests a\nmethod for continuously interpolating between the soft clustering of the IB and\nthe hard clustering of the DIB.\n", "  We apply exceptional generalised geometry to the study of exactly marginal\ndeformations of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs that are dual to generic AdS$_5$ flux\nbackgrounds in type IIB or eleven-dimensional supergravity. In the gauge\ntheory, marginal deformations are parametrised by the space of chiral primary\noperators of conformal dimension three, while exactly marginal deformations\ncorrespond to quotienting this space by the complexified global symmetry group.\nWe show how the supergravity analysis gives a geometric interpretation of the\ngauge theory results. The marginal deformations arise from deformations of\ngeneralised structures that solve moment maps for the generalised\ndiffeomorphism group and have the correct charge under the generalised Reeb\nvector, generating the R-symmetry. If this is the only symmetry of the\nbackground, all marginal deformations are exactly marginal. If the background\npossesses extra isometries, there are obstructions that come from fixed points\nof the moment maps. The exactly marginal deformations are then given by a\nfurther quotient by these extra isometries.\n  Our analysis holds for any $\\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_5$ flux background. Focussing\non the particular case of type IIB Sasaki-Einstein backgrounds we recover the\nresult that marginal deformations correspond to perturbing the solution by\nthree-form flux at first order. In various explicit examples, we show that our\nexpression for the three-form flux matches those in the literature and the\nobstruction conditions match the one-loop beta functions of the dual SCFT.\n", "  Influence Maximization (IM), that seeks a small set of key users who spread\nthe influence widely into the network, is a core problem in multiple domains.\nIt finds applications in viral marketing, epidemic control, and assessing\ncascading failures within complex systems. Despite the huge amount of effort,\nIM in billion-scale networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and World Wide Web has\nnot been satisfactorily solved. Even the state-of-the-art methods such as TIM+\nand IMM may take days on those networks.\n  In this paper, we propose SSA and D-SSA, two novel sampling frameworks for\nIM-based viral marketing problems. SSA and D-SSA are up to 1200 times faster\nthan the SIGMOD'15 best method, IMM, while providing the same\n$(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$ approximation guarantee. Underlying our frameworks is an\ninnovative Stop-and-Stare strategy in which they stop at exponential check\npoints to verify (stare) if there is adequate statistical evidence on the\nsolution quality. Theoretically, we prove that SSA and D-SSA are the first\napproximation algorithms that use (asymptotically) minimum numbers of samples,\nmeeting strict theoretical thresholds characterized for IM. The absolute\nsuperiority of SSA and D-SSA are confirmed through extensive experiments on\nreal network data for IM and another topic-aware viral marketing problem, named\nTVM. The source code is available at https://github.com/hungnt55/Stop-and-Stare\n", "  The study of axion models and quantum corrections to their potential has\nexperienced great progress by phrasing the axion potential in terms of a 3-form\nfield eating up the 2-form field dual to the axion. Such reformulation of the\naxion potential has been described for axion monodromy models, and for axion\npotentials from non-perturbative gauge dynamics. In this paper we propose a\n3-form description of the axion potentials from non-gauge D-brane instantons.\nInterestingly, the required 3-form field does not arise in the underlying\ngeometry, but rather shows up in the KK compactification in the generalized\ngeometry obtained when the backreaction of the D-brane instanton is taken into\naccount.\n", "  Phase transitions, where observable properties of a many-body system change\ndiscontinuously, can occur in both open and closed systems. Ultracold atoms\nhave provided an exemplary model system to demonstrate the physics of\nclosed-system phase transitions, confirming many theoretical models and\nresults. Our understanding of dissipative phase transitions in quantum systems\nis less developed, and experiments that probe this physics even less so. By\nplacing cold atoms in optical cavities, and inducing strong coupling between\nlight and excitations of the atoms, one can experimentally study phase\ntransitions of open quantum systems. Here we observe and study a novel form of\nnonequilibrium phase transition, the condensation of\nsupermode-density-wave-polaritons. These polaritons are formed from a hybrid\n\"supermode\" of cavity photons coupled to atomic density waves of a quantum gas.\nBecause the cavity supports multiple photon spatial modes, and because the\nmatter-light coupling can be comparable to the energy splitting of these modes,\nthe composition of the supermode polariton is changed by the matter-light\ncoupling upon condensation. These results, found in the few-mode-degenerate\ncavity regime, demonstrate the potential of fully multimode cavities to exhibit\nphysics beyond mean-field theories. Such systems will provide experimental\naccess to nontrivial phase transitions in driven dissipative quantum systems as\nwell as enabling the studies of novel non-equilibrium spin glasses and\nneuromorphic computation.\n", "  We derive the kinetic equation that describes the secular evolution of a\nlarge set of particles orbiting a dominant massive object, such as stars bound\nto a supermassive black hole or a proto-planetary debris disc encircling a\nstar. Because the particles move in a quasi-Keplerian potential, their orbits\ncan be approximated by ellipses whose orientations remain fixed over many\ndynamical times. The kinetic equation is obtained by simply averaging the BBGKY\nequations over the fast angle that describes motion along these ellipses. This\nso-called Balescu-Lenard equation describes self-consistently the long-term\nevolution of the distribution of quasi-Keplerian orbits around the central\nobject: it models the diffusion and drift of their actions, induced through\ntheir mutual resonant interaction. Hence, it is the master equation that\ndescribes the secular effects of resonant relaxation. We show how it captures\nthe phenonema of mass segregation and of the relativistic Schwarzschild barrier\nrecently discovered in $N$-body simulations.\n", "  The $\\pi_0$ neutral meson pole mass is calculated in a strongly magnetized\nmedium using the SU(2) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model within the random phase\napproximation (RPA) at zero temperature and zero baryonic density. We employ a\nmagnetic field dependent coupling, $G(eB)$, fitted to reproduce lattice QCD\nresults for the quark condensates. Divergent quantities are handled with a\nmagnetic field independent regularization scheme in order to avoid unphysical\noscillations. A comparison between the running and the fixed couplings reveals\nthat the former produces results much closer to the predictions from recent\nlattice calculations. In particular, we find that the $\\pi_0$ meson mass\nsystematically decreases when the magnetic field increases while the scalar\nmass remains almost constant. We also investigate how the magnetic background\ninfluences other mesonic properties such as $f_{{\\pi}_0}$ and $g_{\\pi_0 q q}$.\n", "  The Leggett-Garg (LG) test of macroscopic realism involves a series of\ndichotomic non-invasive measurements that are used to calculate a function\nwhich has a fixed upper bound for a macrorealistic system and a larger upper\nbound for a quantum system. The quantum upper bound depends on both the details\nof the measurement and the dimension of the system. Here we present an LG\nexperiment on a three-level quantum system, which produces a larger theoretical\nquantum upper bound than that of a two-level quantum system. The experiment is\ncarried out in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and consists of the LG test as\nwell as a test of the ideal assumptions associated with the experiment, such as\nmeasurement non-invasiveness. The non-invasive measurements are performed via\nthe modified ideal negative result measurement scheme on a three-level system.\nOnce these assumptions are tested, the violation becomes small, despite the\nfact that the LG value itself is large. Our results showcase the advantages of\nusing the modified measurement scheme that can reach the higher LG values, as\nthey give more room for hypothetical malicious errors in a real experiment\n", "  Quantum systems in extreme conditions can exhibit universal behavior far from\nequilibrium associated to nonthermal fixed points with a wide range of topical\napplications from early-universe inflaton dynamics and heavy-ion collisions to\nstrong quenches in ultracold quantum gases. So far, most studies have relied on\na mapping of the quantum dynamics onto a classical-statistical theory that can\nbe simulated on a computer. However, the mapping is based on a weak-coupling\nlimit, while phenomenological applications often require moderate interaction\nstrengths. We report on the observation of nonthermal fixed points directly in\nquantum field theory beyond the weak-coupling limit. For the example of a\nrelativistic scalar O(N)-symmetric quantum field theory, we numerically solve\nthe nonequilibrium dynamics employing a 1/N expansion to next-to-leading order,\nwhich does not rely on a small coupling parameter. Starting from two different\nsets of overoccupied and of strong-field initial conditions, we find that\nnonthermal fixed points are not restricted to parameter ranges suitable for\nclassical-statistical simulations, but extend also to couplings of order one.\nWhile the infrared behavior is found to be insensitive to the differences in\nthe initial conditions, we demonstrate that transport phenomena to higher\nmomenta depend on the presence or absence of a symmetry-breaking field\nexpectation value.\n", "  The future gravitational wave (GW) observations of compact binaries and their\npossible electromagnetic counterparts may be used to probe the nature of the\nextra dimension. It is widely accepted that gravitons and photons are the only\ntwo completely confirmed objects that can travel along null geodesics in our\nfour-dimensional space-time. However, if there exist extra dimensions and only\nGWs can propagate freely in the bulk, the causal propagations of GWs and\nelectromagnetic waves (EMWs) are in general different. In this paper, we study\nnull geodesics of GWs and EMWs in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time\nin the presence of the curvature of the universe. We show that for general\ncases the horizon radius of GW is longer than EMW within equal time. Taking the\nGW150914 event detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory and the X-ray event detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor\nas an example, we study how the curvature $k$ and the constant curvature radius\n$l$ affect the horizon radii of GW and EMW in the de Sitter and Einstein-de\nSitter models of the universe. This provides an alternative method for probing\nextra dimension through future GW observations of compact binaries and their\nelectromagnetic counterparts.\n", "  Interaction of spin and intrinsic orbital angular momentum of light is\nobserved, as evidenced by length-dependent rotations of both spatial patterns\nand optical polarization in a cylindrically-symmetric isotropic optical fiber.\nSuch rotations occur in straight few-mode fiber when superpositions of two\nmodes with parallel and anti-parallel orientation of spin and intrinsic orbital\nangular momentum (IOAM=$2\\hslash$) are excited, resulting from a degeneracy\nsplitting of the propagation constants of the modes.\n", "  Global geometry optimization and time-dependent density functional theory\ncalculations have been used to study the structural evolution and optical\nproperties of (AgAu)n (n=2-6) nanoalloys both as individual clusters and as\nclusters stabilized with the fragments of DNA of different size. We show that\nalloying can be used to control and tune the level of interaction between the\nmetal atoms of the cluster and the organic fragments of the DNA ligands. For\ninstance, gold and silver atoms are shown to exhibit synergistic effects in the\nprocess of charge transfer from the nucleobase to the cluster, with the silver\natoms directly connected to the nitrogen atoms of cytosine increasing their\npositive partial charge, while their more electronegative neighbouring gold\natoms host the excess negative charge. This allows the geometrical structures\nand optical absorption spectra of small bimetallic clusters to retain many of\ntheir main features upon aggregation with relatively large DNA fragments, such\nas a cytosine-based 9-nucleotide hairpin loop, which suggests a potential\nsynthetic route to such hybrid metal-organic compounds, and opens up the\npossibility of bringing the unique tunable properties of bimetallic nanoalloys\nto biological applications.\n", "  We consider the entanglement entropy for a free $U(1)$ theory in $3 + 1$\ndimensions in the extended Hilbert space definition. By taking the continuum\nlimit carefully we obtain a replica trick path integral which calculates this\nentanglement entropy. The path integral is gauge invariant, with a gauge fixing\ndelta function accompanied by a Faddeev-Popov determinant. For a spherical\nregion it follows that the result for the logarithmic term in the entanglement,\nwhich is universal, is given by the $a$ anomaly coefficient. We also consider\nthe extractable part of the entanglement, which corresponds to the number of\nBell pairs which can be obtained from entanglement distillation or dilution.\nFor a spherical region we show that the coefficient of the logarithmic term for\nthe extractable part is different from the extended Hilbert space result. We\nargue that the two results will differ in general, and this difference is\naccounted for by a massless scalar living on the boundary of the region of\ninterest.\n", "  We study the total quantum dimension in the thermodynamic limit of\ntopologically ordered systems. In particular, using the anyons (or\nsuperselection sectors) of such models, we define a secret sharing scheme,\nstoring information invisible to a malicious party, and argue that the total\nquantum dimension quantifies how well we can perform this task. We then argue\nthat this can be made mathematically rigorous using the index theory of\nsubfactors, originally due to Jones and later extended by Kosaki and Longo.\nThis theory provides us with a \"relative entropy\" of two von Neumann algebras\nand a quantum channel, and we argue how these can be used to quantify how much\nclassical information two parties can hide form an adversary.\n  We also review the total quantum dimension in finite systems, in particular\nhow it relates to topological entanglement entropy. It is known that the latter\nalso has an interpretation in terms of secret sharing schemes, although this is\nshown by completely different methods from ours. Our work provides a different\nand independent take on this, which at the same time is completely\nmathematically rigorous. This complementary point of view might be beneficial,\nfor example, when studying the stability of the total quantum dimension when\nthe system is perturbed.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal wire with an axial magnetization has metallic surface states\n(Fermi arcs) winding along its perimeter, connecting bulk Weyl cones of\nopposite topological charge (Berry curvature). We investigate what happens to\nthis \"Weyl solenoid\" if the wire is covered with a superconductor, by\ndetermining the dispersion relation of the surface modes propagating along the\nwire. Coupling to the superconductor breaks up the Fermi arc into a pair of\nMajorana modes, separated by an energy gap. Upon variation of the coupling\nstrength along the wire there is a gap inversion that traps the Majorana\nfermions.\n", "  Ultrafast pump-probe measurements of plasmonic nanostructures probe the\nnon-equilibrium behavior of excited carriers, which involves several competing\neffects obscured in typical empirical analyses. Here we present pump-probe\nmeasurements of plasmonic nanoparticles along with a complete theoretical\ndescription based on first-principles calculations of carrier dynamics and\noptical response, free of any fitting parameters. We account for detailed\nelectronic-structure effects in the density of states, excited carrier\ndistributions, electron-phonon coupling, and dielectric functions which allow\nus to avoid effective electron temperature approximations. Using this\ncalculation method, we obtain excellent quantitative agreement with spectral\nand temporal features in transient-absorption measurements. In both our\nexperiments and calculations, we identify the two major contributions of the\ninitial response with distinct signatures: short-lived highly non-thermal\nexcited carriers and longer-lived thermalizing carriers.\n", "  For the first time, we observed and controlled the Brownian motion of\nsolitons. We launched solitonic excitations in highly elongated $^{87}\\rm{Rb}$\nBECs and showed that a dilute background of impurity atoms in a different\ninternal state dramatically affects the soliton. With no impurities and in\none-dimension (1-D), these solitons would have an infinite lifetime, a\nconsequence of integrability. In our experiment, the added impurities scatter\noff the much larger soliton, contributing to its Brownian motion and decreasing\nits lifetime. We describe the soliton's diffusive behavior using a quasi-1-D\nscattering theory of impurity atoms interacting with a soliton, giving\ndiffusion coefficients consistent with experiment.\n", "  High-energy behavior of R-ratio of electron-positron annihilation into\nhadrons is studied. In particular, it is argued that at any given order of\nperturbation theory the re-expansion of the R-ratio in the ultraviolet\nasymptotic can be reduced to the form of power series in the naive continuation\nof the strong running coupling into the timelike domain. The convergence range\nof the re-expanded R-ratio and the corresponding higher-order pi2-terms are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The change of bonding status, typically occurring only in chemical processes,\ncould dramatically alter the material properties. Here, we show that a tunable\nbreaking and forming of a diatomic bond can be achieved through physical means,\ni.e., by a moderate biaxial strain, in the newly discovered MoN$_2$\ntwo-dimensional (2D) material. Based on first-principles calculations, we\npredict that as the lattice parameter is increased under strain, there exists\nan isostructural phase transition at which the N-N distance has a sudden drop,\ncorresponding to the transition from a N-N nonbonding state to a N-N single\nbond state. Remarkably, the bonding change also induces a magnetic phase\ntransition, during which the magnetic moments transfer from the N(2p)\nsublattice to the Mo(4d) sublattice, meanwhile the type of magnetic coupling is\nchanged from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic. We provide a physical picture\nfor understanding these striking effects. The discovery is not only of great\nscientific interest in exploring unusual phase transitions in low-dimensional\nsystems, but it also reveals the great potential of the 2D MoN$_2$ material in\nthe nanoscale mechanical, electronic, and spintronic applications.\n", "  We address the statistics of continuous weak linear measurement on a\nfew-state quantum system that is subject to a conditioned quantum evolution.\nFor a conditioned evolution, both the initial and final states of the system\nare fixed: the latter is achieved by the post-selection in the end of the\nevolution. The statistics may drastically differ from the non-conditioned case,\nand the interference between initial and final states can be observed in the\nprobability distributions of measurement outcomes as well as in the average\nvalues exceeding the conventional range of non-conditioned averages. We develop\na proper formalism to compute the distributions of measurement outcomes,\nevaluate and discuss the distributions in experimentally relevant setups. We\ndemonstrate the manifestations of the interference between initial and final\nstates in various regimes. We consider analytically simple examples of\nnon-trivial probability distributions. We reveal peaks (or dips) at\nhalf-quantized values of the measurement outputs. We discuss in detail the case\nof zero overlap between initial and final states demonstrating anomalously big\naverage outputs and sudden jump in time-integrated output. We present and\ndiscuss the numerical evaluation of the probability distribution aiming at\nextend- ing the analytic results and describing a realistic experimental\nsituation of a qubit in the regime of resonant fluorescence.\n", "  We study the thermal transition of QCD with two degenerate light flavours by\nlattice simulations using $O(a)$-improved Wilson quarks. Temperature scans are\nperformed at a fixed value of $N_t = (aT)^{-1}=16$, where $a$ is the lattice\nspacing and $T$ the temperature, at three fixed zero-temperature pion masses\nbetween 200 MeV and 540 MeV. In this range we find that the transition is\nconsistent with a broad crossover. As a probe of the restoration of chiral\nsymmetry, we study the static screening spectrum. We observe a degeneracy\nbetween the transverse isovector vector and axial-vector channels starting from\nthe transition temperature. Particularly striking is the strong reduction of\nthe splitting between isovector scalar and pseudoscalar screening masses around\nthe chiral phase transition by at least a factor of three compared to its value\nat zero temperature. In fact, the splitting is consistent with zero within our\nuncertainties. This disfavours a chiral phase transition in the $O(4)$\nuniversality class.\n", "  Asymmetry of quantum states is a useful resource in applications such as\nquantum metrology, quantum communication, and reference frame alignment.\nHowever, asymmetry of a state tends to be degraded in physical scenarios where\nenvironment-induced noise is described by covariant operations, e.g., open\nsystems constrained by superselection rules, and such degradations weaken the\nabilities of the state to implement quantum information processing tasks. In\nthis paper, we investigate under which dynamical conditions asymmetry of a\nstate is totally unaffected by the noise described by covariant operations. We\nfind that all asymmetry measures are frozen for a state under a covariant\noperation if and only if the relative entropy of asymmetry is frozen for the\nstate. Our finding reveals the existence of universal freezing of asymmetry,\nand provides a necessary and sufficient condition under which asymmetry is\ntotally unaffected by the noise.\n", "  We present a detailed investigation of ultrafast (subpicosecond) exciton\ndynamics in the lattice model of a donor/acceptor heterojunction. Exciton\ngeneration by means of a photoexcitation, exciton dissociation, and further\ncharge separation are treated on equal footing. The experimentally observed\npresence of space-separated charges at $\\lesssim 100$ fs after the\nphotoexcitation is usually attributed to ultrafast transitions from excitons in\nthe donor to charge transfer and charge separated states. Here, we show,\nhowever, that the space-separated charges appearing on $\\lesssim 100$-fs time\nscales are predominantly directly optically generated. Our theoretical insights\ninto the ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy challenge usual interpretations of\npump-probe spectra in terms of ultrafast population transfer from donor\nexcitons to space-separated charges.\n", "  We report the first measurement of a tune-out wavelength for ground-state\nbosonic Dy and linearly polarized light. The tune-out wavelength measured is\nnear the narrow-line 741-nm transition in $^{162}$Dy, and is the wavelength at\nwhich the total Stark shift of the ground state vanishes. We find that it\nstrongly depends on the relative angle between the optical field and\nquantization axis due to Dy's large tensor polarizability. This anisotropy\nprovides a wide, 22-GHz tunability of the tune-out frequency for linearly\npolarized light, in contrast to Rb and Cs whose near-infrared tune-out\nwavelengths do not exhibit large anisotropy. The measurements of the total\nlight shift are performed by measuring the contrast of multipulse Kapitza-Dirac\ndiffraction. The calculated wavelengths are within a few GHz of the measured\nvalues using known Dy electronic transition data. The lack of hyperfine\nstructure in bosonic Dy implies that the tune-out wavelengths for the other\nbosonic Dy isotopes should be related to this $^{162}$Dy measurement by the\nknown isotope shifts.\n", "  We show that the clustering coefficient, a standard measure in network\ntheory, when applied to flow networks, i.e. graph representations of fluid\nflows in which links between nodes represent fluid transport between spatial\nregions, identifies approximate locations of periodic trajectories in the flow\nsystem. This is true for steady flows and for periodic ones in which the time\ninterval $\\tau$ used to construct the network is the period of the flow or a\nmultiple of it. In other situations the clustering coefficient still identifies\ncyclic motion between regions of the fluid. Besides the fluid context, these\nideas apply equally well to general dynamical systems. By varying the value of\n$\\tau$ used to construct the network, a kind of spectroscopy can be performed\nso that the observation of high values of mean clustering at a value of $\\tau$\nreveals the presence of periodic orbits of period $3\\tau$ which impact phase\nspace significantly. These results are illustrated with examples of increasing\ncomplexity, namely a steady and a periodically perturbed model two-dimensional\nfluid flow, the three-dimensional Lorenz system, and the turbulent surface flow\nobtained from a numerical model of circulation in the Mediterranean sea.\n", "  We review the geometric features of negative conditional entropy and the\nproperties of the conditional amplitude operator proposed by Cerf and Adami for\ntwo qubit states in comparison with entanglement and nonlocality of the states.\nWe identify the region of negative conditional entropy in the tetrahedron of\nlocally maximally mixed two-qubit states. Within this set of states, negative\nconditional entropy implies nonlocality and entanglement, but not vice versa,\nand we show that the Cerf-Adami conditional amplitude operator provides an\nentanglement witness equivalent to the Peres-Horodecki criterion. Outside of\nthe tetrahedron this equivalence is generally not true.\n", "  The equations governing one-dimensional, steady-state electrodiffusion are\nconsidered when there are arbitrarily many mobile ionic species present, in any\nnumber of valence classes, possibly also with a uniform distribution of fixed\ncharges. Exact constant field solutions and new formulas of\nGoldman-Hodgkin-Katz type are found. All of these formulas are exact, unlike\nthe usual approximate ones. Corresponding boundary conditions on the ionic\nconcentrations are identified. The question of uniqueness of constant field\nsolutions with such boundary conditions is considered, and is re-posed in terms\nof an autonomous ordinary differential equation of order $n+1$ for the electric\nfield, where $n$ is the number of valence classes. When there are no fixed\ncharges, the equation can be integrated once to give the non-autonomous\nequation of order $n$ considered previously in the literature including, in the\ncase $n=2$, the form of Painlev\\'e's second equation considered first in the\ncontext of electrodiffusion by one of us. When $n=1$, the new equation is a\nform of Li\\'enard's equation. Uniqueness of the constant field solution is\nestablished in this case.\n", "  The convention in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) physics of employing\nthe dipole approximation to describe laser-induced processes replaces four\nsource-free Maxwell equations governing laser fields with a single Maxwell\nequation for a \"proxy\" field that requires a virtual source current for its\nexistence. Laser fields are transverse, but proxy fields are longitudinal;\nthere can be no gauge equivalence. The proxy field is sometimes serviceable,\nbut its limitations are severe. One example is the \"above-threshold ionization\"\n(ATI) phenomenon; surprising by proxy-field understanding, but natural and\npredicted in advance of observation with a laser-field method. An\noften-overlooked limitation is that numerical solution of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) is exact for proxy fields, but not for laser\nfields. Acceptance of proxy-field concepts has been costly in terms of\ninefficiently deployed research resources. Calculations with a nearly-40-year\nold transverse-field method remain unmatched with proxy fields. The\ntransverse-field method is applicable in the \"tunneling\" domain, the\n\"multiphoton\" domain, and, as shown here, in the low-frequency \"magnetic\"\ndomain. Attempts to introduce low-frequency magnetic field corrections into\nTDSE cannot be expected to produce meaningful results. They would be based on\ninappropriate Maxwell equations, a non-existent virtual source, and would\napproach constant electric field properties as the field frequency declines.\nLaser fields propagate at the speed of light for all frequencies; they cannot\napproach a constant-field limit. Extremely strong laser fields are\nunambiguously relativistic; a nonrelativistic limit that connects continuously\nto the relativistic domain is simpler conceptually and mathematically than is a\ntheory constructed with a proxy field that is certain to fail as intensities\nincrease.\n", "  Finite trigonometric sums occur in various branches of physics, mathematics,\nand their applications. These sums may contain various powers of one or more\ntrigonometric functions. Sums with one trigonometric function are known,\nhowever sums with products of trigonometric functions can get complicated and\nmay not have a simple expressions in a number of cases. Some of these sums have\ninteresting properties and can have amazingly simple value. However, only some\nof them are available in literature. We obtain a number of such sums using\nmethod of residues.\n", "  We employ radio-frequency spectroscopy to investigate a polarized\nspin-mixture of ultracold ${}^6$Li atoms close to a broad Feshbach scattering\nresonance. Focusing on the regime of strong repulsive interactions, we observe\nwell-defined coherent quasiparticles even for unitarity-limited interactions.\nWe characterize the many-body system by extracting the key properties of\nrepulsive Fermi polarons: the energy $E_+$, the effective mass $m^*$, the\nresidue $Z$ and the decay rate $\\Gamma$. Above a critical interaction, $E_+$ is\nfound to exceed the Fermi energy of the bath while $m^*$ diverges and even\nturns negative, thereby indicating that the repulsive Fermi liquid state\nbecomes energetically and thermodynamically unstable.\n", "  Genetic oscillators play important roles in cell life regulation. The\nregulatory efficiency usually depends strongly on the emergence of stable\ncollective dynamic modes, which requires designing the interactions between\ngenetic networks. We investigate the dynamics of two identical synthetic\ngenetic repressilators coupled by an additional plasmid which implements quorum\nsensing (QS) in each network thereby supporting global coupling. In a basic\ngenetic ring oscillator network in which three genes inhibit each other in\nunidirectional manner, QS stimulates the transcriptional activity of chosen\ngenes providing for competition between inhibitory and stimulatory activities\nlocalized in those genes. The \"promoter strength\", the Hill cooperativity\ncoefficient of transcription repression, and the coupling strength, i.e.,\nparameters controlling the basic rates of genetic reactions, were chosen for\nextensive bifurcation analysis. The results are presented as a map of dynamic\nregimes. We found that the remarkable multistability of the anti-phase limit\ncycle and stable homogeneous and inhomogeneous steady states exists over broad\nranges of control parameters. We studied the anti-phase limit cycle stability\nand the evolution of irregular oscillatory regimes in the parameter areas where\nthe anti-phase cycle loses stability. In these regions we observed developing\ncomplex oscillations, collective chaos, and multistability between regular\nlimit cycles and complex oscillations over uncommonly large intervals of\ncoupling strength. QS-coupling stimulates the appearance of intrachaotic\nperiodic windows with spatially symmetric and asymmetric partial limit cycles\nwhich, in turn, change the type of chaos from a simple anti-phase character\ninto chaos composed of pieces of the trajectories having alternating polarity.\nAbstract truncated...\n", "  We study the most general continuous transformation on the generators of\nbilinear master equations of a quantum oscillator. We find that transformation\noperators that preserve the hermiticity of density operators and conserve the\nprobability of reduced dynamics should be adjoint-symmetric, and they are not\nlimited to the pure product of unitary operators in the bra and ket space but\ncould be a mixture of them. We need to include the more general transformation\noperators to explore the full symmetry of generic reduced dynamics. We discuss\nhow the operators are related to those considered in previous works, and\nillustrate how they leave the reduced dynamics form invariant, or map one into\nthe other. The positive semidefinite requirement on the density operator can be\nimposed to give a valid range of transformation parameters.\n", "  Description of hadronic reactions at high energies is conventionally done on\nbasis of QCD factoriza- tion so that factorization convolutions involve\nnon-perturbative inputs mimicking non-perturbative contributions and\nperturbative evolution of those inputs. We construct the inputs for the gluon-\nhadron scattering amplitudes in the forward kinematics and, using the Optical\ntheorem, convert them into inputs for gluon distributions in the both polarized\nand unpolarized hadrons. Firstly, we derive general mathematical criteria which\nany model for the inputs should obey and then suggest a Resonance Model\nsatisfying those criteria. This model is inspired by a simple observation:\nafter emitting an active parton off the hadron, the remaining ensemble of\nspectators becomes unstable and therefore it can be described through factors\nof the resonance type. Exploiting Resonance Model, we obtain non-perturbative\ninputs for gluon distributions in unpolarized and polarized hadrons for all\navailable forms of QCD factorization: Basic, KT - and Collinear Factorizations.\nWe compare the obtained inputs to the inputs available in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of competing coexisting\nsuperconducting (SC) and charge-density wave (CDW) orders in an attractive\nHubbard model. A time-periodic laser field $\\vec{A}(t)$ lifts the SC-CDW\ndegeneracy, since the CDW couples linearly to the field ($\\vec{A}$), whereas SC\ncouples in second order ($\\vec{A}^2$) due to gauge invariance. This leads to a\nstriking resonance: When the photon energy is red-detuned compared to the\nequilibrium single-particle energy gap, CDW is enhanced and SC is suppressed,\nwhile this behavior is reversed for blue detuning. Both orders oscillate with\nan emergent slow frequency, which is controlled by the small amplitude of a\nthird induced order, namely $\\eta$ pairing, given by the commutator of the two\nprimary orders. The induced $\\eta$ pairing is shown to control the enhancement\nand suppression of the dominant orders. Finally, we demonstrate that\nlight-induced superconductivity is possible starting from a predominantly CDW\ninitial state.\n", "  A search for heavy resonances that decay to tau lepton pairs is performed\nusing proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. The data were collected\nwith the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.2 inverse femtobarns. The observations are in agreement with\nstandard model predictions. An upper limit at 95% confidence level on the\nproduct of the production cross section and branching fraction into tau lepton\npairs is calculated as a function of the resonance mass. For the sequential\nstandard model, the presence of Z' bosons decaying into tau lepton pairs is\nexcluded for Z' masses below 2.1 TeV, extending previous limits for this final\nstate. For the topcolor-assisted technicolor model, which predicts Z' bosons\nthat preferentially couple to third-generation fermions, Z' masses below 1.7\nTeV are excluded, representing the most stringent limit to date.\n", "  Low-temperature ($T$) thermodynamic properties in magnetic fields ($B$) of\nthe quasi-Kagome antiferromagnet CePdAl ($T_{\\rm N}\\sim$ 2.7 K) were studied by\nmeans of magnetization and specific-heat $C(T,B)$ measurements. The unusual\nmagnetic phase diagram, including three thermodynamic phases I-III, and\ncrossover anomalies, has been obtained. In low-field phase I, the existence of\nthe partial Kondo screening state on the one-third Ce sites is supported from\nthe thermodynamic point of view: (i) an appearance of the paramagnetic moment\nwith one-third of the full moment around 3 T, and (ii) an occurrence of the\nentropy release $\\sim$0.3$R$ln2 around the observed crossover. On the other\nhand, a strong enhancement of $C/T$ is found around the point, where $T_{\\rm\nN}(B)$ meets the boundary of phase III, indicating the possible presence of a\ntri-critical point. Furthermore, it is suggested that the three metamagnetic\ntransitions at $B_{{\\rm m}i}$ ($i=$1,2,3) come from successive increments of\nthe Ising-type magnetic moment along the $c$-axis. In high-field state above 20\nT, the behavior of $f$ electron can be rather described by the\ncrystal-electric-field model.\n", "  Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an on-going growing field of research.\nEmploying both standard density functional theory and the $GW$ approximation\nwithin the framework of the FLAPW method, we study the electronic and magnetic\nproperties of seven potential antiferromagnetic semiconducting Heusler\ncompounds with 18 (or 28 when Zn is present) valence electrons per unit cell.\nWe show that in these compounds G-type antiferromagnetism is the ground state\nand that they are all either emiconductors (Cr$_2$ScP, Cr$_2$TiZn, V$_2$ScP,\nV$_2$TiSi, and V$_3$Al) or semimetals (Mn$_2$MgZn and Mn$_2$NaAl). The\nmany-body corrections have a minimal effect on the electronic band structure\nwith respect to the standard electronic structure calculations.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the detection mechanism in a meandered\nmolybdenum silicide (MoSi) superconducting nanowire single-photon detector by\ncharacterising the detection probability as a function of bias current in the\nwavelength range of 750 to 2050 nm. Contrary to some previous observations on\nniobium nitride (NbN) or tungsten silicide (WSi) detectors, we find that the\nenergy-current relation is nonlinear in this range. Furthermore, thanks to the\npresence of a saturated detection efficiency over the whole range of\nwavelengths, we precisely quantify the shape of the curves. This allows a\ndetailed study of their features, which are indicative of both Fano\nfluctuations and position-dependent effects.\n", "  The current practice of angular (Lorentz, Polarization and absorption (LPA))\ncorrections in bulk materials for higher angle broad peaks, due to the\nK{\\alpha} doublet, are based on the results of Pike (Acta Cryst., 12 (1959)\n87-92) and Ladell (Acta Cryst. 14 (1961) 47-53). These results are extended to\nthin film x-ray diffraction. The current practice in thin film studies of using\nthe absorption factors for monochromatic radiation in LPA corrections is\nincorrect in both symmetric and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction. The\ncorrect expressions for absorption corrections are developed. In addition, a\nnew length scale, the linear regime, is shown to exist for very thin films\nwhere the absorption factor and the integrated intensity are independent of the\nabsorption coefficient. For very thin films, it is practically advantageous to\nuse the expressions for the linear regime over those for the thin film regime.\nThe procedures to obtain both the main results are of general validity and can\nbe extended to several thin film diffraction techniques.\n", "  An emitter in the vicinity of a metal nanostructure is quenched by its decay\nthrough non-radiative channels, leading to the belief in a zone of inactivity\nfor emitters placed within $<$10nm of a plasmonic nanostructure. Here we\ndemonstrate that in tightly-coupled plasmonic resonators forming nanocavities\n\"quenching is quenched\" due to plasmon mixing. Unlike isolated nanoparticles,\nplasmonic nanocavities show mode hybridization which massively enhances emitter\nexcitation and decay via radiative channels. This creates ideal conditions for\nrealizing single-molecule strong-coupling with plasmons, evident in dynamic\nRabi-oscillations and experimentally confirmed by laterally dependent emitter\nplacement through DNA-origami.\n", "  The nucleon generalized polarizabilities (GPs), probed in virtual Compton\nscattering (VCS), describe the spatial distribution of the polarization density\nin a nucleon. They are accessed experimentally via the process of\nelectron-proton bremsstrahlung ($ep\\to ep\\gamma$) at electron-beam facilities,\nsuch as MIT-Bates, CEBAF (Jefferson Lab), and MAMI (Mainz). We present the\ncalculation of the nucleon GPs and VCS observables at next-to-leading order in\nbaryon chiral perturbation theory (B$\\chi$PT), and confront the results with\nthe empirical information. At this order our results are predictions, in the\nsense that all the parameters are well-known from elsewhere. Within the\nrelatively large uncertainties of our calculation we find good agreement with\nthe experimental observations of VCS and the empirical extractions of the GPs.\nWe find large discrepancies with previous chiral calculations---all done in\nheavy-baryon $\\chi$PT (HB$\\chi$PT)---and discuss the differences between\nB$\\chi$PT and HB$\\chi$PT responsible for these discrepancies.\n", "  B2 1215+30 is a BL Lac-type blazar that was first detected at TeV energies by\nthe MAGIC atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, and subsequently confirmed by the\nVERITAS observatory with data collected between 2009 and 2012. In 2014 February\n08, VERITAS detected a large-amplitude flare from B2 1215+30 during routine\nmonitoring observations of the blazar 1ES 1218+304, located in the same field\nof view. The TeV flux reached 2.4 times the Crab Nebula flux with a variability\ntimescale of < 3.6 h. Multiwavelength observations with Fermi-LAT, Swift, and\nthe Tuorla observatory revealed a correlated high GeV flux state and no\nsignificant optical counterpart to the flare, with a spectral energy\ndistribution where the gamma-ray luminosity exceeds the synchrotron luminosity.\nWhen interpreted in the framework of a one-zone leptonic model, the observed\nemission implies a high degree of beaming, with Doppler factor > 10, and an\nelectron population with spectral index < 2.3.\n", "  In a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime with a negative cosmological constant, the\nthermodynamics and the entropy of an extremal rotating thin shell, i.e., an\nextremal rotating ring, are investigated. The outer and inner regions are taken\nto be the Ba\\~{n}ados-Teitelbom-Zanelli (BTZ) spacetime and the vacuum ground\nstate anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, respectively. By applying the first law\nof thermodynamics to the extremal shell one shows that its entropy is an\narbitrary function of the gravitational area $A_+$ alone, $S=S(A_+)$. When the\nshell approaches its own gravitational radius $r_+$ and turns into an extremal\nrotating BTZ black hole, it is found that the entropy of the spacetime remains\nsuch a function of $A_+$. It is thus vindicated, that extremal black holes,\nhere extremal BTZ black holes, have different properties from the corresponding\nnonextremal black holes, which have the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S(A_+)=\n\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. It is argued that for\nthe extremal case $0\\leq S(A_+)\\leq \\frac{A_+}{4G}$. Thus, rather than having\njust two entropies for extremal black holes, as previous results debated, 0 and\n$\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, it is shown that extremal black holes may have a continuous\nrange of entropies, limited by precisely those two entropies. Surely, the\nentropy that a particular extremal black hole picks must depend on past\nprocesses, notably on how it was formed. It is also found a remarkable relation\nbetween the third law of thermodynamics and the impossibility for a massive\nbody to reach the velocity of light. In the procedure, it becomes clear that\nthere are two distinct angular velocities for the shell, the mechanical and\nthermodynamic angular velocities. In passing, we clarify, for a static\nspacetime with a thermal shell, the meaning of the Tolman temperature formula\nat a generic radius and at the shell. (Abridged version).\n", "  We have performed time-dependent wave packet simulations of realistic\nAharonov-Bohm (AB) devices with a quantum dot embedded in one of the arms of\nthe interferometer. The AB ring can function as a measurement device for the\nintrinsic transmission phase through the quantum dot, however, care has to be\ntaken in analyzing the influence of scattering processes in the junctions of\nthe interferometer arms. We consider a harmonic quantum dot and show how the\nDarwin-Fock spectrum emerges as a unique pattern in the interference fringes of\nthe AB oscillations.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to check the impact of observer and Palatini\n$f(R)$ terms in the formulations of inhomogeneity factors of spherical\nrelativistic systems. We consider Lema\\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi dynamical model as\na compact object and studied its evolution with both tilted and non-tilted\nobservers. We performed our analysis for particular cases of fluid distribution\nin tilted frame and found some energy density irregularity variables. We found\nthat these variables are drastically different from those observed by\nnon-tilted observer. The conformal flat dust and perfect matter contents are\nhomogeneous as long as they impregnate vacuum core. However, this restriction\nis relaxed, when the complexity in the fluid description is increased. The\nradial fluid velocity due to tilted congruences and Palatini $f(R)$ curvature\nterms tend to produce hindrances in the appearance of energy-density\ninhomogeneities in the initially regular spherical stellar populations.\n", "  We study non-thermal gravitino production in the minimal supergravity\ninflation. In this minimal model utilizing orthogonal nilpotent superfields,\nthe particle spectrum includes only graviton, gravitino, inflaton, and\ngoldstino. We find that a substantial fraction of the cosmic energy density can\nbe transferred to the longitudinal gravitino due to non-trivial change of its\nsound speed. This implies either a breakdown of the effective theory during\nreheating or a serious gravitino problem.\n", "  We report extensive 3-yr multiwavelength observations of the WZ Sge-type\ndwarf nova SSS J122221.7-311525 during its unusual double superoutburst, the\nfollowing decline and in quiescence. The second segment of the superoutburst\nhad a long duration of 33 d and a very gentle decline with a rate of 0.02\nmag/d, and it displayed an extended post-outburst decline lasting at least 500\nd. Simultaneously with the start of the rapid fading from the superoutburst\nplateau, the system showed the appearance of a strong near-infrared excess\nresulting in very red colours, which reached extreme values (B-I~1.4) about 20\nd later. The colours then became bluer again, but it took at least 250 d to\nacquire a stable level. Superhumps were clearly visible in the light curve from\nour very first time-resolved observations until at least 420 d after the rapid\nfading from the superoutburst. The spectroscopic and photometric data revealed\nan orbital period of 109.80 min and a fractional superhump period excess <0.8\nper cent, indicating a very low mass ratio q<0.045. With such a small mass\nratio the donor mass should be below the hydrogen-burning minimum mass limit.\nThe observed infrared flux in quiescence is indeed much lower than is expected\nfrom a cataclysmic variable with a near-main-sequence donor star. This strongly\nsuggests a brown-dwarf-like nature for the donor and that SSS J122221.7-311525\nhas already evolved away from the period minimum towards longer periods, with\nthe donor now extremely dim.\n", "  In this work we have investigated, by fully atomistic reactive (force field\nReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, some aspects of impact dynamics of\nwater nanodroplets on graphdiyne-like membranes. We simulated\ngraphdiyne-supported membranes impacted by nanodroplets at different velocities\n(from 100 up to 1500 m/s). The results show that due to the graphdiyne porous\nand elastic structure, the droplets present an impact dynamics very complex in\nrelation to the ones observed for graphene membranes. Under impact the droplets\nspread over the surface with a maximum contact radius proportional to the\nimpact velocity. Depending on the energy impact value, a number of water\nmolecules were able to percolate (pass through) the nanopore sheets. However,\neven in these cases the droplet shape (liquid state) is preserved and the main\ndifferences between the different impact velocities cases reside on the\nsplashing pattern at the maximum spreading.\n", "  The high-energy non-thermal universe is dominated by power law-like spectra.\nTherefore results in high-energy astronomy are often reported as parameters of\npower law fits, or, in the case of a non-detection, as an upper limit assuming\nthe underlying unseen spectrum behaves as a power law. In this paper I\ndemonstrate a simple and powerful one-to-one relation of the integral upper\nlimit in the two dimensional power law parameter space into the spectrum\nparameter space and use this method to unravel the so far convoluted question\nof the sensitivity of astroparticle telescopes.\n", "  We consider the possibility for the existence of the third family of compact\nobjects, considering the effect of strong magnetic fields inside the hybrid\nstars. As a result, we demonstrate such new sequences of stable equilibrium\nconfigurations for some hadronic equations of state. Through the analysis of\nthe adiabatic index inside stars, we find the conditions for appearing the\nthird family of compact objects, i.e., for hadronic stars without quarks, that\nthe maximum mass should be small, the central density for the maximum mass\nshould be also small, and the radius for the the maximum mass should be large.\nEven for soft hadronic equations of state, the two solar-mass stars might\nsurvive as the third family of compact objects, once quark matter with strong\nmagnetic field, such as $\\sim {\\cal O}(10^{19} {\\rm G})$, is taken into\naccount. It might give a hint to solve the so-called hyperon puzzle in nuclear\nphysics.\n", "  We have a new observation that near horizon symmetry generators,\ncorresponding to diffeomorphisms which leave the horizon structure invariant,\nsatisfy noncommutative Heisenberg algebra. The results are valid for any null\nsurfaces (which has Rindler structure in the near null surface limit) and in\nany spacetime dimensions. Using Sugawara construction technique the central\ncharge is identified. It is shown that the horizon entropy is consistent with\nthe standard form of Cardy formula. Therefore we feel that the noncommutative\nalgebra might leads to quantum mechanics of horizon and also can probe into the\nmicroscopic description of entropy.\n", "  We study the multipole interactions between $f^2$ ions with the $\\Gamma_3$\nnon-Kramers doublet ground state under a cubic crystalline electric field. We\nconstruct the $\\Gamma_3$ doublet state of the electrons with the total angular\nmomentum $j=5/2$. By applying the second-order perturbation theory with respect\nto the intersite hopping, we derive the multipole interactions. We obtain a\nquadrupole interaction for a simple cubic lattice, an octupole interaction for\na bcc lattice, and both quadrupole and octupole interactions for an fcc\nlattice. We also discuss general tendencies of the multipole interactions\ndepending on the lattice structure by comparing the results with those for the\n$\\Gamma_8$ quartet systems of $f^1$ ions.\n", "  We investigate the process of coarsening via annihilation of\nvortex-antivortex pairs, following the quench to the condensate phase in a\nnonresonantly pumped polariton system. We find that the late-time dynamics is\nan example of universal phase ordering kinetics, characterized by scaling of\ncorrelation functions in time. Depending on the parameters of the system, the\nevolution of the characteristic length scale L(t) can be the same as for the\ntwo-dimensional XY model, described by a power law with the dynamical exponent\nz \\aprox 2 and a logarithmic correction, or z \\aprox 1 which agrees with\nprevious studies of conservative superfluids.\n", "  The maximum mass limits of neutron stars in scalar-tensor gravity is\ndiscussed and compared with the limits set by general relativity. The limit is\nparametrized with respect to the combination of the nuclear saturation\nparameters and the maximum sound velocity in the core. It is shown that, for\nsmaller values of the sound velocity in the core, the maximum mass limit of the\nscalarized neutron stars is larger than that of in general relativity. However,\nfor stiff equations of state with sound velocity higher than $79\\%$ of the\nvelocity of light, the maximum mass limit in general relativity is larger than\nthat of in scalar-tensor gravity. The results suggest that future observations\nof massive neutron stars, may constrain the maximum sound velocity as well as\nthe coupling parameter in scalar-tensor gravity.\n", "  Recent work on recurrence in quantum walks has provided a representation of\nSchur functions in terms of unitary operators. We propose a generalization of\nSchur functions by extending this operator representation to arbitrary\noperators on Banach spaces. Such generalized Schur functions meet the formal\nstructure of first return generating functions, thus we call them FR-functions.\nWe derive general properties of FR-functions, among them a generalization of\nthe renewal equation already known for random and quantum walks, as well as\nsplitting properties which extend useful factorizations of Schur functions.\n  When specialized to self-adjoint operators, FR-functions become Nevanlinna\nfunctions. This leads to new results on Nevanlinna functions: decomposition\nrules which are the analogue of useful factorizations of Schur functions, a\nsimple Nevanlinna version of the Schur algorithm and new operator and integral\nrepresentations of Nevanlinna functions which, in contrast to standard ones,\nare exact analogues of those already known for Schur functions, giving\nsimilarly a one-to-one correspondence between Nevanlinna functions and measures\non the real line.\n  The paper is completed with several applications of FR-functions to\northogonal polynomials and random and quantum walks which illustrate their wide\ninterest: an analogue for orthogonal polynomials on the real line of the\nKhrushchev formula for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle, and the use\nof FR-functions to study recurrence in random walks, quantum walks and open\nquantum walks. These applications provide numerous explicit examples of\nFR-functions and their splittings and show that these new tools, despite being\nextensions of very classical ones, play an important role in the study of\nphysical problems of a highly topical nature.\n", "  The present discussion concerning certain fundamental physical theories (such\nas string theory and multiverse cosmology) has reopened the demarcation problem\nbetween science and non-science. While parts of the physics community see the\nsituation as a beginning epistemic shift in what defines science, others deny\nthat the traditional criterion of empirical testability can or should be\nchanged. As demonstrated by the history of physics, it is not the first time\nthat drastic revisions of theory assessment have been proposed. Although\nhistorical reflection has little to offer modern physicists in a technical\nsense, it does offer a broader and more nuanced perspective on the present\ndebate. This paper suggests that history of science is of some indirect value\nto modern physicists and philosophers dealing with string theory, multiverse\nscenarios, and related theoretical ideas.\n", "  The classes of electrovacuum Einstein - Maxwell fields (with a cosmological\nconstant), which metrics admit an Abelian two-dimensional isometry group\n$\\mathcal{G}_2$ with non-null orbits and electromagnetic fields possess the\nsame symmetry, are considered. For these fields we describe the structures of\nso called \"nondynamical degrees of freedom\" which presence as well as the\npresence of a cosmological constant change (in a strikingly similar ways) the\ndynamical equations and destroy their known integrable structures.\nModifications of the known reduced forms of Einstein - Maxwell equations -- the\nErnst equations and self-dual Kinnersley equations in the presence of\nnon-dynamical degrees of freedom are found and subclasses of fields with\nnon-dynamical degrees of freedom are considered for : (I) vacuum metrics with\ncosmological constant, (II) vacuum space-times with isometry groups\n$\\mathcal{G}_2$ which orbits do not admit the orthogonal 2-surfaces\n(none-orthogonally-transitive isometry groups) and (III) electrovacuum fields\nwith more general structures of electromagnetic fields than in the known\nintegrable cases. For these classes, in the case of diagonal metrics, the field\nequations can be reduced to the only nonlinear equation of the fourth order for\none real function $\\alpha(x^1,x^2)$ which characterises the element of area on\nthe orbits of the isometry group $\\mathcal{G}_2$ . Simple examples of solutions\nfor each of these classes are presented. It is pointed out that if for some\ntwo-dimensional reduction of Einstein's field equations in four or higher\ndimensions, the function $\\alpha(x^1,x^2)$ possess a \"harmonic\" structure,\ninstead of being (together with other field variables) a solution of some\nnonlinear equations, this can be an indication of possible complete\nintegrability of these reduced dynamical equations for the fields with\nvanishing of all non-dynamical degrees of freedom.\n", "  Expressing the Schroedinger Lagrangian ${\\cal L}$ in terms of the quantum\nwavefunction $\\psi=\\exp(S+{\\rm i}I)$ yields the conserved Noether current ${\\bf\nJ}=\\exp(2S)\\nabla I$. When $\\psi$ is a stationary state, the divergence of\n${\\bf J}$ vanishes. One can exchange $S$ with $I$ to obtain a new Lagrangian\n$\\tilde{\\cal L}$ and a new Noether current $\\tilde{\\bf J}=\\exp(2I)\\nabla S$,\nconserved under the equations of motion of $\\tilde{\\cal L}$. However this new\ncurrent $\\tilde{\\bf J}$ is generally not conserved under the equations of\nmotion of the original Lagrangian ${\\cal L}$. We analyse the role played by\n$\\tilde{\\bf J}$ in the case when classical configuration space is a complex\nmanifold, and relate its nonvanishing divergence to the inexistence of\ncomplex-analytic wavefunctions in the quantum theory described by ${\\cal L}$.\n", "  This report is a synthesis of my master thesis internship at the National\nInstitute of Informatics (NII) in Tokyo, Japan, that lasted during the summer\nof year 2012. I worked in the Quantum Information Science Theory (QIST) group\nunder supervision of Prof. Kae Nemoto and Dr. Simon Devitt. This group works on\ntheoretical and experimental implementations of quantum information science.\nThe aim of my project was to study and improve quantum optical systems. I first\nstudied different fields and systems of quantum information science. Then I\nfocused my research on single-photon sources, entangled photon sources and\ninterferometric photonic switches. Finally, I found some strategies to design\nan efficient and optimized single-photon source that could be built with\ntoday's technologies. This report describes in details the created and\noptimized design of a single-photon source based on time and space multiplexing\nof Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC) sources.\n", "  Ion hydrations are ubiquitous in natural and fundamental processes. A\nquantitative analysis of a novel CO2 sorbent driven by ion hydrations was\npresented by molecular dynamics (MD). We explored the humidity effect on the\ndiffusion and structure of ion hydrations in CO2 sorbent, as well as the\nworking mechanism of the moisture-swing CO2 sorbent. The discovery of the\ndiffusion coefficients of ions at different humidity levels can be applied to\ndesign a new CO2 sorbent with superior performance. The molecular structure\nanalysis shows a higher precipitation rate of HCO3- ions than CO32- ions in a\ndry surrounding, which leads to a more alkaline surrounding on CO2 sorbent that\nmay promote the absorption of CO2.\n", "  We consider the relativistic generalization of the problem of the \"least\nuncomfortable\" linear trajectory from point A to point B. The traditional\nproblem minimizes the time-integrated squared acceleration (termed the\n\"discomfort\"), and there is a universal solution for all distances and\ndurations. This universality fails when the maximum speed of the trajectory\nbecomes relativistic, and we consider the more general case of minimizing the\nsquared proper acceleration over a proper time. The least uncomfortable\nrelativistic trajectory has a rapidity that evolves like the motion of a\nparticle in a hyperbolic sine potential, agreeing with the classical solution\nat low velocities. We consider the special case of a hypothetical trip to Alpha\nCentauri, and compare the minimal-discomfort trajectory to one with uniform\nEarth-like acceleration.\n", "  Long linear codes constructed from toric varieties over finite fields, their\nmultiplicative structure and decoding. The main theme is the inherent\nmultiplicative structure on toric codes. The multiplicative structure allows\nfor \\emph{decoding}, resembling the decoding of Reed-Solomon codes and aligns\nwith decoding by error correcting pairs. We have used the multiplicative\nstructure on toric codes to construct linear secret sharing schemes with\n\\emph{strong multiplication} via Massey's construction generalizing the Shamir\nLinear secret sharing shemes constructed from Reed-Solomon codes. We have\nconstructed quantum error correcting codes from toric surfaces by the\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane method.\n", "  In Phys.Rev.D89, 104053 (2014) we studied the absorption cross section of a\nscalar field of mass $m$ impinging on a static black hole of mass $M$ and\ncharge $Q$. We presented numerical results using the partial-wave method, and\nanalytical results in the high- and low-frequency limit. Our low-frequency\napproximation was only valid if the (dimensionless) field velocity $v$ exceeds\n$v_c = 2 \\pi M m$. In this Addendum we give the complementary result for $v\n\\lesssim v_c$, and we consider the possible physical relevance of this regime.\n", "  Score reliability is necessary for establishing a validity argument for an\ninstrument, and is therefore highly important to investigate. Depending on the\nproposed instrument use and score interpretations, differing degrees of\nprecision in measurement or reliability are required. Researchers sometimes\nfail to take a critical stance when investigating this important measurement\nproperty, and default to accepted values of commonly known measures. This study\ntakes a multi-faceted approach to scrutinizing score reliability from a measure\nof STEM teacher strategic knowledge using rater agreement, classical test\ntheory conceptions of reliability, and Generalizability Theory. This detailed\nexamination provides insight about where the greatest gains in score\nreliability can be realized, given the design of the instrument and the context\nof measurement.\n", "  We report 3D coherent diffractive imaging of Au/Pd core-shell nanoparticles\nwith 6 nm resolution on 5-6 femtosecond timescales. We measured single-shot\ndiffraction patterns of core-shell nanoparticles using very intense and short\nx-ray free electron laser pulses. By taking advantage of the curvature of the\nEwald sphere and the symmetry of the nanoparticle, we reconstructed the 3D\nelectron density of 34 core-shell structures from single-shot diffraction\npatterns. We determined the size of the Au core and the thickness of the Pd\nshell to be 65.0 +/- 1.0 nm and 4.0 +/- 0.5 nm, respectively, and identified\nthe 3D elemental distribution inside the nanoparticles with an accuracy better\nthan 2%. We anticipate this method can be used for quantitative 3D imaging of\nsymmetrical nanostructures and virus particles.\n", "  The interface formation between copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and two\nrepresentative metal substrates, i.e., Au and Co, was investigated by the\ncombination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and inverse photoelectron\nspectroscopy. The occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals and thus the\ntransport band gap of CuPc are highly influenced by film thickness, i.e.,\nmolecule-substrate distance. Due to the image charge potential given by the\nmetallic substrates the transport band gap of CuPc \"opens\" from $(1.4 \\pm 0.3)$\neV for 1 nm thickness to $(2.2 \\pm 0.3)$ eV, and saturates at this value above\n10 nm CuPc thickness. The interface dipoles with values of 1.2 eV and 1.0 eV\nfor Au and Co substrates, respectively, predominantly depend on the metal\nsubstrate work functions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements using\nsynchrotron radiation provide detailed information on the interaction between\nCuPc and the two metal substrates. While charge transfer from the Au or Co\nsubstrate to the Cu metal center is present only at sub-monolayer coverages,\nthe authors observe a net charge transfer from the molecule to the Co substrate\nfor films in the nm range. Consequently, the Fermi level is shifted as in the\ncase of a p-type doping of the molecule. This is, however, a competing\nphenomenon to the energy band shifts due to the image charge potential.\n", "  Quantum correlations of observables for two particle states have demonstrated\nthe nonlocal character of the quantum mechanics. However nonlocality can be\nexhibited even for noncommuting observables of a single particle system. In\nthis paper we show nonlocality of position-momentum correlations of a single\nparticle in the double-slit experiment modeled by an initially correlated\nGaussian wavepacket. The positivity or negativity of the Wigner function for\nthe state of the particle at the detection screen is related with the\n$\\sigma_{xp}$ covariances. A Bell's inequality is constructed from the Wigner\nfunction and it is violated for both the positive and negative cases. The case\nof positive Wigner function is the analogous of the original EPR state for a\nsingle particle.\n", "  The W51 cloud complex is one of the best laboratories in our Galaxy to study\nhigh-mass star formation. At a distance of about 5 kpc, it is the closest\nregion containing a high-mass protocluster, and it has two. The cloud includes\na long infrared-dark cloud, is interacting with a supernova remnant, and\ncontains a variety of unique massive protostellar sources. This article is an\nobservational review of the region.\n", "  A surface acoustic wave (SAW) can produce a moving potential wave that can\ntrap and drag electrons along with it. We review work on using a SAW to create\nmoving quantum dots containing single electrons, with the aims of developing a\ncurrent standard, emitting single photons, transferring single electrons\nbetween static quantum dots, and investigating non-adiabatic effects.\n", "  We study the self-energy of a gravitating point particle in AdS$_3$, and\ncompare to operator dimensions in CFT$_2$. In particular, we compute the one\nand two loop diagram contributions to the expectation value of an open Wilson\nline in the SL(2,R)$\\times$ SL(2,R) Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$\ngravity. This gives the two-point function of CFT primary operators to second\norder in a large $c$ expansion, and hence yields the scaling dimension $h(j,c)$\nas a function of the SL(2,R) spin $j$. Comparison to CFT is made in the context\nof constructing Virasoro representations starting from representations of\nSL(2,R) current algebra. Our Wilson line computations follow the framework\nadvanced recently by Fitzpatrick et. al., which is based on earlier work by H.\nVerlinde. We encounter some renormalization scheme ambiguities at the two-loop\nlevel which we are not able to fully resolve, hampering a definitive comparison\nwith CFT expressions at this order.\n", "  Spatial averaging and time evolving are non-commutative operations in General\nRelativity, which questions the reliability of the FLRW model. The long\nstanding issue of the importance of backreactions induced by cosmic\ninhomogeneities is addressed for a toy model assuming a peak in the primordial\nspectrum of density perturbations and a simple CDM cosmology. The backreactions\nof initial Hubble-size inhomogeneities are determined in a fully relativistic\nframework, from a series of simulations using the BSSN formalism of numerical\nrelativity. In the FLRW picture, these backreactions can be effectively\ndescribed by two so-called morphon scalar fields, one of them acting at late\ntime like a tiny cosmological constant. Initial density contrasts ranging from\n$10^{-2}$ down to $10^{-4}$, on scales crossing the Hubble radius between\n$z\\sim 45 $ and $z\\sim 1000$ respectively, i.e. comoving gigaparsec scales,\nmimic a Dark Energy (DE) component that can reach $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{DE}} \\approx\n0.7$ when extrapolated until today. A similar effect is not excluded for lower\ndensity contrasts but our results are then strongly contaminated by numerical\nnoise and thus hardly reliable. A potentially detectable signature of this\nscenario is a phantom-like equation of state $w< -1$, at redshifts $z\\gtrsim 4$\nfor a density contrast of $10^{-2}$ initially, relaxing slowly to $w \\approx\n-1$ today. This new class of scenarios would send the fine-tuning and\ncoincidence issues of Dark energy back to the mechanism at the origin of the\nprimordial power spectrum enhancement, possibly in the context of inflation.\n", "  The geodetic VLBI technique is capable of measuring the Sun's gravity light\ndeflection from distant radio sources around the whole sky. This light\ndeflection is equivalent to the conventional gravitational delay used for the\nreduction of geodetic VLBI data. While numerous tests based on a global set of\nVLBI data have shown that the parameter 'gamma' of the post-Newtonian\napproximation is equal to unity with a precision of about 0.02 percent, more\ndetailed analysis reveals some systematic deviations depending on the angular\nelongation from the Sun. In this paper a limited set of VLBI observations near\nthe Sun were adjusted to obtain the estimate of the parameter 'gamma' free of\nthe elongation angle impact. The parameter 'gamma' is still found to be close\nto unity with precision of 0.06 percent, two subsets of VLBI data measured at\nshort and long baselines produce some statistical inconsistency.\n", "  Novel phenomena appear when two different oxide materials are combined\ntogether to form an interface. For example, at the interface of LaAlO3/SrTiO3,\ntwo dimensional conductive states form to avoid the polar discontinuity and\nmagnetic properties are found at such interface. In this work, we propose a new\ntype of interface between two nonmagnetic and nonpolar oxides that could host a\nconductive state with magnetic properties, where it is the ferroelectric\npolarization discontinuity instead of the polar discontinuity that leads to the\ncharge transfer, forming the interfacial conductive or magnetic states. As a\nconcrete example, we investigate by first-principles calculations the\nheterostructures made of ferroelectric perovskite oxide PbTiO3 and\nnon-ferroelectric polarized oxides TiO2. We show that charge is transferred to\nthe interfacial layer forming an interfacial conductive state with\nferromagnetic ordering that may persist up to room temperature. Especially, the\nstrong coupling between bulk ferroelectric polarization and interface\nferromagnetism represents a new type of magnetoelectric effect, which provides\nan ideal platform for exploring the intriguing interfacial multiferroics. The\nfindings here are important not only for fundamental science but also for\npromising applications in nanoscale electronics and spintronics.\n", "  The first part of this work consists of a study of the ODE/IM correspondence\nfor simply-laced affine Toda field theories. It is a first step towards a full\ngeneralisation of the results of Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov on $\\hat{\\mathfrak\na}_1$ to a general affine Lie-Ka\\v{c}-Moody algebra $\\hat{\\mathfrak g}$. In\norder to achieve our goal, we investigate the structure of evaluation\nrepresentations of $\\hat{\\mathfrak g}$ and show how their tensor products are\nrelated by what we call projected isomorphisms. These isomorphisms are used to\nconstruct a set of quadratic functional relations, called $\\psi$-system, for\nthe solutions to complex differential equations associated to $\\hat{\\mathfrak\ng}$. Finally, from the $\\psi$-system for the algebras $\\mathfrak a$ and\n$\\mathfrak d$, we derive a set of Bethe Ansatz equations satisfied by the\neigenvalues of some particular boundary problem for the above mentioned\ndifferential equations.\n  The second part of this work deals with the study of one-point functions in\nsine- and sinh-Gordon models. The approach to the computation of these\nquantities follows a powerful method, which we call fermionic basis, developed\nby Boos et al. for the XXZ, quantum Liouville and quantum sine-Gordon models.\nWe show how the determinant formula for one-point functions obtained there can\nbe generalised to the sinh-Gordon model. In doing so we give an interpretation\nof the fermionic basis in terms of certain symmetries of the system. This new\nperspective will also allow us to solve trivially the reflection relations\nintroduced by Fateev et al. We then provide analytical and numerical results\nsupporting our finding.\n", "  The concept of the polaron in condensed matter physics has been extended to\nthe Rabi model, where polarons resulting from the coupling between a two-level\nsystem and single-mode photons represent two oppositely displaced oscillators.\nInterestingly, tunneling between these two displaced oscillators can induce an\nanti-polaron, which has not been systematically explored in the literature,\nespecially in the presence of an asymmetric term. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic analysis of the competition between the polaron and anti-polaron\nunder the interplay of the coupling strength and the asymmetric term. While\nintuitively the anti-polaron should be secondary owing to its higher potential\nenergy, we find that, under certain conditions, the minor anti-polaron may gain\na reversal in the weight over the major polaron. If the asymmetric amplitude\n$\\epsilon$ is smaller than the harmonic frequency $\\omega$, such an\noverweighted anti-polaron can occur beyond a critical value of the coupling\nstrength $g$; if $\\epsilon$ is larger, the anti-polaron can even be always\noverweighted at any $g$. We propose that the explicit occurrence of the\noverweighted anti-polaron can be monitored by a displacement transition from\nnegative to positive values. This displacement is an experimentally accessible\nobservable, which can be measured by quantum optical methods, such as balanced\nHomodyne detection.\n", "  The formation of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is related\nto accretion on to their central supermassive black holes, and magnetic fields\nare believed to play a central role in launching, collimating and accelerating\nthe jet streams from very compact regions out to kiloparsec or megaparsec\nscales. In the presence of helical or toroidal magnetic fields threading the\nAGN jets and their immediate vicinity, gradients in the observed Faraday\nrotation measures are expected due to the systematic change in the\nline-of-sight component of the magnetic field across the jet. We have analysed\ntotal intensity, linear polarization, fractional polarization and Faraday\nrotation maps based on Very Long Baseline Array data obtained at four\nwavelengths in the 18-22 cm range for six AGN (OJ 287, 3C 279, PKS 1510-089, 3C\n345, BL Lac and 3C 454.3). These observations typically probe projected\ndistances out to tens of parsecs from the observed core, and are well suited\nfor Faraday rotation studies due to the relatively long wavelengths used and\nthe similarity of the structures measured at the different wavelengths. We have\nidentified statistically significant, monotonic, transverse Faraday rotation\ngradients across the jets of four of these six sources, as well as a tentative\ntransverse Faraday rotation gradient across the jet of OJ 287, providing\nevidence for the presence of toroidal magnetic fields, which may be one\ncomponent of helical magnetic fields associated with these AGN jets.\n", "  During our optical monitoring of UV Ceti, iconic late-type flaring star, with\nhigh temporal resolution using the Russian 6-m telescope in 2008 we detected a\ngiant flare with the amplitude of about 3 magnitudes in $U$-band. Near flare\nmaximum more than a dozen of spike bursts have been discovered with triangular\nshapes and durations from 0.6 to 1.2 s and maximal luminosities in the range\n$(1.5-8)\\times10^{27}$ erg~s$^{-1}$. For the half of these events the linear\npolarization exceeds 35% with significance better than $5\\sigma$. We argue that\nthese events are synchrotron emission of electron streams with the energies of\nseveral hundred MeV moving in the magnetic field of about 1.4 kG. Emission from\nsuch ultrarelativistic (with energies far exceeding 10 MeV) particles is being\nroutinely observed in solar flares, but has never been detected from UV Ceti\ntype stars.\n  This is the first ever detection of linearly polarized optical light from the\nUV Ceti-type stars which indicates that at least some fraction of the flaring\nevents on these stars are powered by a non-thermal synchrotron emission\nmechanism.\n", "  Repeated computed tomography (CT) scans are required in some clinical\napplications such as image-guided radiotherapy and follow-up observations over\na time period. To optimize the radiation dose utility, a normal-dose (or\nfull-dose) CT scan is often first performed to set up reference, followed by a\nseries of low-dose scans. Using the previous normal-dose scan to improve\nfollow-up low-dose scans reconstruction has drawn great interests recently,\nsuch as the previous normal-dose induced nonlocal means (ndiNLM) regularization\nmethod. However, one major concern with this method is that whether it would\nintroduce false structures or miss true structures when the previous\nnormal-dose image and current low-dose image have different structures (e.g., a\ntumor could be present, grow, shrink or absent in either image). This study\naims to investigate the performance of the ndiNLM regularization method in the\nabove mentioned situations. A patient with lung nodule for biopsy was recruited\nto this study. A normal-dose scan was acquired to set up biopsy operation,\nfollowed by a few low-dose scans during needle intervention toward the nodule.\nWe used different slices to mimic different possible cases wherein the previous\nnormal-dose image and current low-dose image have different structures. The\nexperimental results characterize performance of our ndiNLM regularization\nmethod.\n", "  With the tremendous increase of the Internet traffic, achieving the best\nperformance with limited resources is becoming an extremely urgent problem. In\norder to address this concern, in this paper, we build an optimization problem\nwhich aims to maximize the total utility of traffic flows with the capacity\nconstraint of nodes and links in the network. Based on Duality Theory, we\npropose an iterative algorithm which adjusts the rates of traffic flows and\ncapacity of nodes and links simultaneously to maximize the total utility.\nSimulation results show that our algorithm performs better than the NUP\nalgorithm on BA and ER network models, which has shown to get the best\nperformance so far. Since our research combines the topology information with\ncapacity constraint, it may give some insights for resource allocation in real\ncommunication networks.\n", "  In a recent paper (arXiv:1701.04298 [quant-ph]) Toro\\v{s}, Gro{\\ss}ardt and\nBassi claim that the potential necessary to support a composite particle in a\ngravitational field must necessarily cancel the relativistic coupling between\ninternal and external degrees of freedom. As such a coupling is responsible for\nthe gravitational redshift measured in numerous experiments, the above\nstatement is clearly incorrect. We identify the simple mistake in the paper\nresponsible for the incorrect claim.\n", "  A comprehensive study on the evolution of Stoner factor with doping\nconcentration for various doped 122 systems (like BaFe$_2$As$_2$,\nSrFe$_2$As$_2$) of Fe-based superconductors is presented. Our first principles\nelectronic structure calculations reveal that for Co/Ru (electron or\niso-electronic) doping at Fe sites or P doping at As sites result in a\nreduction of Stoner factor with increasing doping concentration. On the\ncontrary, in case of Na/K (hole) doping at the Ba sites, Stoner factor is\nenhanced for higher doping concentrations. This may be considered as an\nindicator of elevation of \"magnetic fluctuation\" in these systems. We find that\nthe Stoner factor uniquely follows the variation of the pnictide height\nz$_{As}$/Fe-As bond length with various kinds of doping. Our calculated Fermi\nsurfaces explicate the diversities in the behaviour of Stoner factors for\nvarious doped 122 systems ; larger degree of Fermi surface nesting, larger the\nvalue of Stoner factor and vice versa.\n", "  Recently the engineering of the entanglement for photon pairs generated\nduring the spontaneous parametric down conversion process (SPDC) can be\nachieved via manipulation of pump wavelength behind a \\c{hi}(2)-based type II\nSPDC process [1]. Such effect is used in this paper for demonstration of\nnon-classical dispersion cancellation phenomenon in both local and nonlocal\ndetections, theoretically. The following results are analytically achieved: I)\nFor local detection, if narrow pump laser (highly entangled photons) are used,\nthe dispersive broadening cancelation is directly depends on the degree of\nentanglement. The higher entanglement degree, the more compensation occurs. The\nresults indicate that by increasing the FWHM of the pump the impact of the\nentanglement degree is decreased in such a way that for a pump with FWHM=4 nm\nthe entanglement has no effect on the broadening. Therefore, the dispersive\nbroadening is only depends on the temporal walk-off between generated photon\npairs and the pump. II) For nonlocal detection, it is also shown that\nentanglement cancels the dispersive broadening if and only if each of the\ngenerated paired photons propagate through dispersive material with identical\nlength with opposite group velocity sign.\n", "  In this letter we study the problem of scalar particle production in external\nelectric field in de Sitter geometry. The total probability is calculated using\nthe previously obtained result in Ref.\\cite{6} for transition amplitude in\nexternal electric field on de Sitter space. Then we make a graphical study of\nthe total probability in terms of the ratio mass of the particle/expansion\nfactor. Our results show that the probability depend of the direction in which\nthe particles are emitted and that the probability becomes maxim when particles\nare emitted on the direction of the electric field. In the Minkowski limit we\nobtain that the probability is vanishing.\n", "  We investigate the region of the nuclear chart around $A \\simeq 70$ from a\nthree-body perspective, where we compute reaction rates for the radiative\ncapture of two protons. One key quantity is here the photon dissociation cross\nsection for the inverse process where two protons are liberated from the\nborromean nucleus by photon bombardment. We find a number of peaks at low\nphoton energy in this cross section where each peak is located at the energy\ncorresponding to population of a three-body resonance. Thus, for these energies\nthe decay or capture processes proceed through these resonances. However, the\nnext step in the dissociation process still has the option of following several\npaths, that is either sequential decay by emission of one proton at a time with\nan intermediate two-body resonance as stepping stone, or direct decay into the\ncontinuum of both protons simultaneously. The astrophysical reaction rate is\nobtained by folding of the cross section as function of energy with the\noccupation probability for a Maxwell-Boltzmann temperature distribution. The\nreaction rate is then a function of temperature, and of course depending on the\nunderlying three-body bound state and resonance structures. We show that a very\nsimple formula at low temperature reproduces the elaborate numerically computed\nreaction rate.\n", "  Nuclear cluster physics implicitly assumes a distinction between groups of\ndegrees-of-freedom, that is the (frozen) intrinsic and (explicitly treated)\nrelative cluster motion. We formulate a realistic and practical method to\ndescribe the coupled motion of these two sets of degrees-of-freedom. We derive\na coupled set of differential equations for the system using the\nphenomenologically adjusted effective in-medium Skyrme type of nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction. We select a two-nucleon plus core system where the mean-field\napproximation corresponding to the Skyrme interaction is used for the core. A\nhyperspherical adiabatic expansion of the Faddeev equations is used for the\nrelative cluster motion. We shall specifically compare both the structure and\nthe decay mechanism found from the traditional three-body calculations with the\nresult using the new boundary condition provided by the full microscopic\nstructure at small distance. The extended Hilbert space guaranties an improved\nwave function compared to both mean-field and three-body solutions. We shall\ninvestigate the structures and decay mechanism of $^{22}$C ($^{20}$C+n+n). In\nconclusion, we have developed a method combining nuclear few- and many-body\ntechniques without losing the descriptive power of each approximation at\nmedium-to-large distances and small distances respectively. The coupled set of\nequations are solved self-consistently, and both structure and dynamic\nevolution are studied.\n", "  Magnetic domain wall (DW) motion induced by a localized Gaussian temperature\nprofile is studied in a Permalloy nanostrip within the framework of the\nstochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation. The different contributions to\nthermally induced DW motion, entropic torque and magnonic spin transfer torque,\nare isolated and compared. The analysis of magnonic spin transfer torque\nincludes a description of thermally excited magnons in the sample. A third\ndriving force due to a thermally induced dipolar field is found and described.\nFinally, thermally induced DW motion is studied under realistic conditions by\ntaking into account the edge roughness. The results give quantitative insights\ninto the different mechanisms responsible for domain wall motion in temperature\ngradients and allow for comparison with experimental results.\n", "  We have fabricated oxygen deficient polycrystalline ZnO films by the rf\nsputtering deposition method. To systematically investigate the charge\ntransport mechanisms in these samples, the electrical resistivities have been\nmeasured over a wide range of temperature from 300 K down to liquid-helium\ntemperatures. We found that below about 100 K, the variable-range-hopping (VRH)\nconduction processes govern the charge transport properties. In particular, the\nMott VRH conduction process dominates at higher temperatures, while crossing\nover to the Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH conduction process at lower temperatures.\nThe crossover occurred at temperatures as high as a few tens degrees Kelvin.\nMoreover, the temperature behavior of resistivity over the entire VRH\nconduction regime from the Mott-type to the ES-type process can be well\ndescribed by a universal scaling law.\n", "  We investigate spacetimes whose light cones could be anisotropic. We prove\nthe equivalence of the structures: (a) Lorentz-Finsler manifold for which the\nmean Cartan torsion vanishes, (b) Lorentz-Finsler manifold for which the\nindicatrix (observer space) at each point is a convex hyperbolic affine sphere\ncentered on the zero section, and (c) pair given by a spacetime volume and a\nsharp convex cone distribution. The equivalence suggests to describe {\\em\n(affine sphere) spacetimes} with this structure, so that no algebraic-metrical\nconcept enters the definition. As a result, this work shows how the metric\nfeatures of spacetime emerge from elementary concepts such as measure and\norder. Non-relativistic spacetimes are obtained replacing proper spheres with\nimproper spheres, so the distinction does not call for group theoretical\nelements. In physical terms, in affine sphere spacetimes the light cone\ndistribution and the spacetime measure determine the motion of massive and\nmassless particles (hence the dispersion relation). Furthermore, it is shown\nthat, more generally, for Lorentz-Finsler theories non-differentiable at the\ncone, the lightlike geodesics and the transport of the particle momentum over\nthem are well defined though the curve parametrization could be undefined.\nCausality theory is also well behaved. Several results for affine sphere\nspacetimes are presented. Some results in Finsler geometry, for instance in the\ncharacterization of Randers spaces, are also included.\n", "  Metal catalysts supporting the growth of Single Wall Carbon Nanotubes display\ndifferent carbon solubilities and chemical reactivities. In order to\nspecifically assess the role of carbon solubility, we take advantage of the\nphysical transparency of a tight binding model established for Ni-C alloys, to\ndevelop metal carbon models where all properties, except carbon solubility, are\nsimilar. These models are used to analyze carbon incorporation mechanisms,\nmodifications of metal / carbon wall interfacial properties induced thereby,\nand the associated nanotube growth mechanisms. Fine tuning carbon solubility is\nshown to be essential to support sustainable growth, preventing growth\ntermination by either nanoparticle encapsulation or detachment.\n", "  Domain walls in ferroelectrics exhibit a plethora of phases and\nfunctionalities not found in the bulk. The interplay of electrostatic,\nchemical, topological, and distortive inhomogeneities at the walls can be so\ncomplex, however, that this obstructs their technological performance. In\ntetragonal ferroelectrics like PbZrxTi1-xO3, for example, the desired\nfunctional 180{\\deg} domain walls within out-of-plane-polarized c-domains are\ninterspersed by in-plane-polarized a-domains and the associated network of\ndomain walls remains challenging to analyze. Here we use a combination of STEM\nand optical second harmonic generation (SHG) to determine the relation between\nstrain, film thickness, local electric fields and the resulting domain and\ndomain-wall structures across the entire thickness of a set of PZT films. We\nquantify the distribution of a-domains in the c-domain matrix of the films.\nUsing locally applied electric fields we control the a/c distribution and\ninduce the technologically preferable 180{\\deg} domain walls. We find that\nthese voltage induced walls are tilted and exhibit a mixed Ising-N\\'eel type\ntransverse rotation of polarization across the wall with a specific nonlinear\noptical response.\n", "  In the context of Lorentz-Finsler spacetime theories the relativity principle\nholds at a spacetime point if the indicatrix (observer space) is homogeneous.\nWe point out that in four spacetime dimensions there are just three kinematical\nmodels which respect an exact form of the relativity principle and for which\nall observers agree on the spacetime volume. They have necessarily affine\nsphere indicatrices. For them every observer which looks at a flash of light\nemitted by a point would observe, respectively, an expanding (a) sphere, (b)\ntetrahedron, or (c) cone, with barycenter at the point. The first model\ncorresponds to Lorentzian relativity, the second one has been studied by\nseveral authors though the relationship with affine spheres passed unnoticed,\nand the last one has not been previously recognized and it is studied here in\nsome detail. The symmetry groups are $O^+(3,1)$, $R^3$, $O^+(2,1) \\times R$,\nrespectively. In the second part, devoted to the general relativistic theory,\nwe show that the field equations can be obtained by gauging the Finsler\nLagrangian symmetry while avoiding direct use of Finslerian curvatures. We\nconstruct some notable affine sphere spacetimes which in the appropriate\nvelocity limit return the Schwarzschild, Kerr-Schild, Kerr-de Sitter,\nKerr-Newman, Taub, and FLRW spacetimes, respectively.\n", "  Microplasma generation using microwaves in an electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT)-like metasurface composed of two types of radiatively\ncoupled cut-wire resonators with slightly different resonance frequencies is\ninvestigated. Microplasma is generated in either of the gaps of the cut-wire\nresonators as a result of strong enhancement of the local electric field\nassociated with resonance and slow microwave effect. The threshold microwave\npower for plasma ignition is found to reach a minimum at the EIT-like\ntransmission peak frequency, where the group index is maximized. A pump-probe\nmeasurement of the metasurface reveals that the transmission properties can be\nsignificantly varied by varying the properties of the generated microplasma\nnear the EIT-like transmission peak frequency and the resonance frequency. The\nelectron density of the microplasma is roughly estimated to be of order\n$1\\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for a pump power of $15.8\\,\\mathrm{W}$ by\ncomparing the measured transmission spectrum for the probe wave with the\nnumerically calculated spectrum. In the calculation, we assumed that the plasma\nis uniformly generated in the resonator gap, that the electron temperature is\n$2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, and that the elastic scattering cross section is $20 \\times\n10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n", "  The feedback forces exerted by particles suspended in a turbulent flow is\nshown to lead to a new scaling law for velocity fluctuations associated to a\npower-spectra $\\propto k^{-2}$. The mechanism at play relies on a direct\ntransfer of kinetic energy to small scales through Kelvin--Helmholtz\ninstabilities occurring in regions of high particle density contrast. This\nfinding is confirmed by two-dimensional direct numerical simulations.\n", "  In this paper we consider a two-component system of the Holm-Staley equation\nwith no stretching and a one-parameter nonlinearity in the convection term.\nPoint symmetries are found, conditions for the existence of multipeakon and\nmultikink solutions are determined. Solutions for the 1-peakon and 1-kink are\nexplicitly obtained and they exhibit a behaviour quite different of their\nanalogous in the scalar equation.\n", "  Next-generation radio interferometers, such as the Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA), will revolutionise our understanding of the universe through their\nunprecedented sensitivity and resolution. However, standard methods in radio\ninterferometry produce reconstructed interferometric images that are limited in\nquality and they are not scalable for big data. In this work we apply and\nevaluate alternative interferometric reconstruction methods that make use of\nstate-of-the-art sparse image reconstruction algorithms motivated by\ncompressive sensing, which have been implemented in the PURIFY software\npackage. In particular, we implement and apply the proximal alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (P-ADMM) algorithm presented in a recent\narticle. We apply PURIFY to real interferometric observations. For all\nobservations PURIFY outperforms the standard CLEAN, where in some cases PURIFY\nprovides an improvement in dynamic range by over an order of magnitude. The\nlatest version of PURIFY, which includes the developments presented in this\nwork, is made publicly available.\n", "  Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis methods are powerful tools for engineers\nwho use flow simulations for design. However, the conventional adjoint method\nbreaks down for scale-resolving simulations like large-eddy simulation (LES) or\ndirect numerical simulation (DNS), which exhibit the chaotic dynamics inherent\nin turbulent flows. Sensitivity analysis based on least-squares shadowing (LSS)\navoids the issues encountered by conventional methods, but has a high\ncomputational cost. The following report outlines a new, more computationally\nefficient formulation of LSS, non-intrusive LSS, and estimates its cost for\nseveral canonical flows using Lyapunov analysis.\n", "  We present the emergence of a root system in six dimensions from the\ntetrahedra of an icosahedral core known as the 20-group (20G) within the\nframework of Clifford's geometric algebra. Consequently, we establish a\nconnection between a three dimensional icosahedral seed, a six dimensional\nDirichlet quantized host and a higher dimensional lattice structure. The 20G,\nowing to its icosahedral symmetry, bears the signature of a 6D lattice that\nmanifests in the Dirichlet integer representation. We present an interpretation\nwhereby the three dimensional 20G can be regarded as the core substratum from\nwhich the higher dimensional lattices emerge. This emergent geometry is based\non an induction principle supported by the Clifford multivector formalism of 3D\nEuclidean space. This lays a geometric framework for understanding several\nphysics theories related to $SU(5)$, $E_6$, $E_8$ Lie algebras and their\ncomposition with the algebra associated with the even unimodular lattice in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. The construction presented here is inspired by Penrose's\n\\textit{three world} model.\n", "  John Nash has proposed a new theory of gravity. We define a Nash-tensor equal\nto the curvature tensor appearing in the Nash field equations for empty space,\nand calculate its components for two cases. 1. A static, spherically symmetric\nspace, and 2. The expanding, homogeneous and isotropic space of the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe models. We find the\ngeneral, exact solution of the Nash field equations for empty space in the\nstatic case. The line element turns out to represent the Schwarzschild-de\nSitter spacetime. Also we find the simplest non-trivial solution of the field\nequations in the cosmological case, which gives the scale factor corresponding\nto the de Sitter spacetime. Hence empty space in the Nash theory corresponds to\na space with Lorentz Invariant Vacuum Energy (LIVE) in the Einstein theory.\nThis suggests that dark energy may be superfluous according to the Nash theory.\nWe also consider a radiation filled universe model in an effort to find out how\nenergy and matter may be incorporated into the Nash theory. A tentative\ninterpretation of the Nash theory as a unified theory of gravity and\nelectromagnetism leads to a very simple form of the field equations in the\npresence of matter. It should be noted, however, that the Nash theory is still\nunfinished. A satifying way of including energy-momentum into the theory has\nyet to be found.\n", "  Neutrino flux streaming from a supernova can undergo rapid flavor conversions\nalmost immediately above the core. Focusing on this region, we study these fast\nconversions using a linear stability analysis. We find that, for realistic\nangular distributions of neutrinos, fast conversions can occur within a few\nnanoseconds in regions just above the neutrinosphere. Our results also show\nthat neutrinos travelling towards the core make fast conversions more rapid.\nThese conversions, if they exist, can have significant implications for\nsupernova explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis.\n", "  Nano-crystalline diamond is a new carbon phase with numerous intriguing\nphysical and chemical properties and applications. Small doped nanodiamonds for\nexample do find increased use as novel quantum markers in biomedical\napplications. However, growing doped nanodiamonds below sizes of 5 nm with\ncontrolled composition has been elusive so far. Here we grow nanodiamonds under\nconditions where diamond-like organic seed molecules do not decompose. This is\na key first step toward engineered growth of fluorescent nanodiamonds wherein a\ncustom designed seed molecule can be incorporated at the center of a\nnanodiamond. By substituting atoms at particular locations in the seed molecule\nit will be possible to achieve complex multi-atom diamond color centers or even\nto engineer complete nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum registers. Other benefits\ninclude the potential to grow ultrasmall nanodiamonds, wherein each diamond no\nmatter how small can have at least one bright and photostable fluorescent\nemitter.\n", "  In this Report we show the role of charge defects in the context of the\nformation of electrostatically defined quantum dots. We introduce a barrier\narray structure to probe defects at multiple locations in a single device. We\nmeasure samples both before and after an annealing process which uses an\nAl$_2$O$_3$ overlayer, grown by atomic layer deposition. After passivation of\nthe majority of charge defects with annealing we can electrostatically define\nhole quantum dots up to 180 nm in length. Our ambipolar structures reveal\namphoteric charge defects that remain after annealing with charging energies of\n~10 meV in both the positive and negative charge state.\n", "  We introduce a novel numerical method to integrate partial differential\nequations representing the Hamiltonian dynamics of field theories. It is a\nmulti-symplectic integrator that locally conserves the stress-energy tensor\nwith an excellent precision over very long periods. Its major advantage is that\nit is extremely simple (it is basically a centered box scheme) while remaining\nlocally well defined. We put it to the test in the case of the non-linear wave\nequation (with quartic potential) in one spatial dimension, and we explain how\nto implement it in higher dimensions. A formal geometric presentation of the\nmulti-symplectic structure is also given as well as a technical trick allowing\nto solve the degeneracy problem that potentially accompanies the\nmulti-symplectic structure.\n", "  Polycrystalline Mn 5 Ge 3 thin films were produced on SiO 2 using magnetron\nsputtering and reactive diffusion (RD) or non-diffusive reaction (NDR). In situ\nX-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy were used to determine the layer\nstructures, and magnetic force microscopy, superconducting quantum interference\ndevice and ferromagnetic resonance were used to determine their magnetic\nproperties. RD-mediated layers exhibit similar magnetic properties as MBE-grown\nmonocrystalline Mn 5 Ge 3 thin films, while NDR-mediated layers show magnetic\nproperties similar to monocrystalline C-doped Mn 5 Ge 3 C x thin films with\n$0.1 \\leq x \\leq 0.2.$ NDR appears as a CMOS-compatible efficient method to\nproduce good magnetic quality high-curie temperature Mn 5 Ge 3 thin films.\n", "  The supercomputing platforms available for high performance computing based\nresearch evolve at a great rate. However, this rapid development of novel\ntechnologies requires constant adaptations and optimizations of the existing\ncodes for each new machine architecture. In such context, minimizing time of\nefficiently porting the code on a new platform is of crucial importance. A\npossible solution for this common challenge is to use simulations of the\napplication that can assist in detecting performance bottlenecks. Due to\nprohibitive costs of classical cycle-accurate simulators, coarse-grain\nsimulations are more suitable for large parallel and distributed systems. We\npresent a procedure of implementing the profiling for openQCD code [1] through\nsimulation, which will enable the global reduction of the cost of profiling and\noptimizing this code commonly used in the lattice QCD community. Our approach\nis based on well-known SimGrid simulator [2], which allows for fast and\naccurate performance predictions of HPC codes. Additionally, accurate\nestimations of the program behavior on some future machines, not yet accessible\nto us, are anticipated.\n", "  The electronic properties of single-layer antimony are studied by a\ncombination of first-principles and tight-binding methods. The band structure\nobtained from relativistic density functional theory is used to derive an\nanalytic tight-binding model that offers an efficient and accurate description\nof single-particle electronic states in a wide spectral region up to the\nmid-UV. The strong ($\\lambda=0.34$ eV) intra-atomic spin-orbit interaction\nplays a fundamental role in the band structure, leading to splitting of the\nvalence band edge and to a significant reduction of the effective mass of the\nhole carriers. To obtain an effective many-body model of two-dimensional Sb we\ncalculate the screened Coulomb interaction and provide numerical values for the\non-site $\\bar{V}_{00}$ (Hubbard) and intersite $\\bar{V}_{ij}$ interactions. We\nfind that the screening effects originate predominantly from the 5$p$ states,\nand are thus fully captured within the proposed tight-binding model. The\nleading kinetic and Coulomb energies are shown to be comparable in magnitude,\n$|t_{01}|/(\\bar{V}_{00}-\\bar{V}_{01}) \\sim 1.6$, which suggests a strongly\ncorrelated character of 5$p$ electrons in Sb. The results presented here\nprovide an essential step toward the understanding and rational description of\na variety of electronic properties of this two-dimensional material.\n", "  We investigate the capillary force that applies on a tilted cylinder as a\nfunction of its dipping angle i, using a home-built tilting Atomic Force\nMicroscope (AFM) with custom made probes. A micrometric-size rod is glued at\nthe end of an AFM cantilever of known stiffness, whose deflection is measured\nwhen the cylindrical probe is dipped in and retracted from reference liquids.\nWe show that a torque correction is necessary to understand the measured\ndeflection. The results are compatible with a vertical capillary force varying\nas 1/ cos i, in agreement with a recent theoretical prediction. We also discuss\nthe accuracy of the method for measuring the surface tension times the cosine\nof the contact angle of the liquid on the hanging fiber.\n", "  Various metals (Ag, Al, Au, Bi, Cu), polymers (polyvinylpyrrolidone,\npolystyrene), and electrically conductive polymers (polyacetylene, polyaniline,\npoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) were subjected to a\nparticle swarm optimizer inboth the planar and grating configuration to\noptimize conditions which supported surface plasmon resonances (SPR) for\nchemical sensing. The objective functions for these configurations were based\non absorption peak depth, full width at half maximum, or the enhancement factor\n(planar). Simple logic gates were constructed for both configurations which\nassessed if a lossy region was plasmonic by several figures of merit. The\nplanar substrates returned viable sensing configurations for all of the metals\ntested, most notably bismuth metal at 2.1{\\mu}m. The corrugated metal\nsubstrates also resulted in tuned SPRs. Most interestingly an optimized surface\nplasmon on the conductive polymer, polyaniline at 12{\\mu}m, was also\ndiscovered.\n", "  We propose a calibrated filtered reduced order model (CF-ROM) framework for\nthe numerical simulation of general nonlinear PDEs that are amenable to reduced\norder modeling. The novel CF-ROM framework consists of two steps: (i) In the\nfirst step, we use explicit ROM spatial filtering of the nonlinear PDE to\nconstruct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is low-dimensional, but is not\nclosed (because of the nonlinearity in the given PDE). (ii) In the second step,\nwe use a calibration procedure to close the filtered ROM, i.e., to model the\ninteraction between the resolved and unresolved modes. To this end, we use a\nlinear or quadratic ansatz to model this interaction and close the filtered\nROM. To find the new coefficients in the closed filtered ROM, we solve an\noptimization problem that minimizes the difference between the full order model\ndata and our ansatz. Although we use a fluid dynamics setting to illustrate how\nto construct and use the CF-ROM framework, we emphasize that it is built on\ngeneral ideas of spatial filtering and optimization and is independent of\n(restrictive) phenomenological arguments. Thus, the CF-ROM framework can be\napplied to a wide variety of PDEs.\n", "  We discuss possible new physics (NP) effects beyond the standard model (SM)\nin the exclusive decays $\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^{(\\ast)} \\tau^- \\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}$.\nStarting with a model-independent effective Hamiltonian including non-SM\nfour-Fermi operators, we show how to obtain experimental constraints on\ndifferent NP scenarios and investigate their effects on a large set of physical\nobservables. The $\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^{(\\ast)}$ transition form factors are\ncalculated in the full kinematic $q^2$ range by employing the covariant\nconfined quark model developed by our group.\n", "  In the usual formulation of quantum mechanics, groups of automorphisms of\nquantum states have ray representations by unitary and antiunitary operators on\ncomplex Hilbert space, in accordance with Wigner's Theorem. In the phase-space\nformulation, they have real, true unitary representations in the space of\nsquare-integrable functions on phase-space. Each such phase-space\nrepresentation is a Weyl-Wigner product of the corresponding Hilbert space\nrepresentation with its contragredient, and these can be recovered by\n`factorising' the Weyl-Wigner product. However, not every real, unitary\nrepresentation on phase-space corresponds to a group of automorphisms, so not\nevery such representation is in the form of a Weyl-Wigner product and can be\nfactorised. The conditions under which this is possible are examined. Examples\nare presented.\n", "  Classical mechanics is formulated in complex Hilbert space with the\nintroduction of a commutative product of operators, an antisymmetric bracket,\nand a quasidensity operator. These are analogues of the star product, the Moyal\nbracket, and the Wigner function in the phase space formulation of quantum\nmechanics. Classical mechanics can now be viewed as a deformation of quantum\nmechanics. The forms of semiquantum approximations to classical mechanics are\nindicated.\n", "  Quantum mechanics has been formulated in phase space, with the Wigner\nfunction as the representative of the quantum density operator, and classical\nmechanics has been formulated in Hilbert space, with the Groenewold operator as\nthe representative of the classical Liouville density function. Semiclassical\napproximations to the quantum evolution of the Wigner function have been\ndefined, enabling the quantum evolution to be approached from a classical\nstarting point. Now analogous semiquantum approximations to the classical\nevolution of the Groenewold operator are defined, enabling the classical\nevolution to be approached from a quantum starting point. Simple nonlinear\nsystems with one degree of freedom are considered, whose Hamiltonians are\npolynomials in the Hamiltonian of the simple harmonic oscillator. The behaviour\nof expectation values of simple observables and of eigenvalues of the\nGroenewold operator, are calculated numerically and compared for the various\nsemiclassical and semiquantum approximations.\n"]}
