The model reveals\nnew intrinsic angular momentum (or isospin) eigenvectors whose structural\nsymmetries are detailed, some of which are not available for groups having only\none quantization axis available for configurations. Additionally, an intrinsic\ncyclic ordering of the quantization axes and internal geometric phase relations\nbetween the basis states naturally fall out from the algebraic properties of\nthe group. The nature of the coupling into a SU(3) symmetry group also allows\nfor the definition of both positive and negative basis states along each\nquantization axis relative to the center of the group. These basis states\nconfigurations mimic those observed in color-charge and electroweak theories.\n"]}
