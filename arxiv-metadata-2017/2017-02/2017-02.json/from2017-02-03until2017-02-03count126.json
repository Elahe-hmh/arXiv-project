To\nthis end, we first develop a characterization of sh Lie-Rinehart algebras in\nterms of differential graded cocommutative coalgebras and Lie algebra twisting\ncochains that extends the nowadays standard characterization of an ordinary sh\nLie algebra (equivalently: Linfty algebra) in terms of its associated\ngeneralized Cartan-Chevalley-Eilenberg coalgebra. Our approach avoids any\nhigher brackets but reproduces these brackets in a conceptual manner. The new\ntechnical tool we develop is a notion of filtered multi derivation chain\nalgebra, somewhat more general than the standard notion of a multicomplex\nendowed with a compatible algebra structure. The crucial observation, just as\nfor ordinary Lie-Rinehart algebras, is this: For a general sh Lie-Rinehart\nalgebra,the generalized Cartan-Chevalley-Eilenberg operator on the\ncorresponding graded algebra involves two operators, one coming from the sh Lie\nalgebra structure and the other from the generalized action on the\ncorresponding algebra; the sum of the operators is defined on the algebra while\nthe operators are individually defined only on a larger ambient algebra. We\nillustrate the structure with quasi Lie-Rinehart algebras.\n", "  Wormholes that meet the flare-out condition violate the weak energy condition\nin classical general relativity. The purpose of this note is to show that even\na slight modification of the gravitational theory could, under certain\nconditions, avoid this violation for matter threading the wormhole. The first\npart discusses some general criteria based on the field equations, while the\nsecond part assumes a specific equation of state describing normal matter,\ntogether with a particular type of shape function. The analysis is confined to\nwormholes with zero tidal forces.\n", "  We investigate a system of two interacting qubits having one of them isolated\nand the other coupled to a thermal reservoir. We consider two different models\nof system-reservoir interaction: i) a \"microscopic\" model, in which the master\nequation is derived taking into account the interaction between the two\nsubsystems (qubits), ii) a naive \"phenomenological\" model, in which the master\nequation consists of a dissipative term added to the unitary evolution term. We\nstudy the dynamics of quantities such as bipartite entanglement, quantum\ndiscord and the linear entropy of the isolated qubit for both strong and weak\ncoupling regimes (qubit-qubit interaction) as well as for different\ntemperatures of the reservoir. We find significant disagreements between the\nresults obtained from the two models even in the weak coupling regime. For\ninstance, we show that according to the phenomenological model, the isolated\nqubit would approach a maximally mixed state more slowly for higher\ntemperatures (unphysical result), while the microscopic model predicts the\nopposite behaviour (correct result).\n", "  We study U(N|M) character expectation value with the supermatrix Chern-Simons\ntheory, known as the ABJM matrix model, with emphasis on its connection to the\nknot invariant. This average just gives the half BPS circular Wilson loop\nexpectation value in ABJM theory, which shall correspond to the unknot\ninvariant. We derive the determinantal formula, which gives U(N|M) character\nexpectation values in terms of U(1|1) averages for a particular type of\ncharacter representations. This means that the U(1|1) character expectation\nvalue is a building block for all the U(N|M) averages, and in particular, by an\nappropriate limit, for the U(N) invariants. In addition to the original model,\nwe introduce another supermatrix model obtained through the symplectic\ntransform, which is motivated by the torus knot Chern-Simons matrix model. We\nobtain the Rosso-Jones-type formula and the spectral curve for this case.\n", "  Recently a new method to set the scale in lattice gauge theories, based on\nthe gradient flow generated by the Wilson action, has been proposed, and the\nsystematic errors of the new scales t0 and w0 have been investigated by various\ngroups. The Wilson flow provides also an interesting alternative smoothing\nprocedure in particular useful for the measurement of the topological charge as\na pure gluonic observable. We show the viability of this method for N=1\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by analysing the configurations produced by\nthe DESY-Muenster collaboration. For increasing flow time the topological\ncharge quickly approaches near-integer values. The topological susceptibility\nhas been measured for different fermion masses and its value is observed to\napproach zero in the chiral limit. Finally, the relation between the scale\ndefined by the Wilson flow and the topological charge has been investigated,\ndemonstrating a correlation between these two quantities.\n", "  Transition edge sensor microcalorimeters can measure x-ray and gamma-ray\nenergies with very high energy resolution and high photon-collection\nefficiency. For this technology to reach its full potential in future x-ray\nobservatories, each sensor must be able to measure hundreds or even thousands\nof photon energies per second. Current \"optimal filtering\" approaches to\nachieve the best possible energy resolution work only for photons well isolated\nin time, a requirement in direct conflict with the need for high-rate\nmeasurements. We describe a new analysis procedure to allow fitting for the\npulse height of all photons even in the presence of heavy pulse pile-up. In the\nlimit of isolated pulses, the technique reduces to the standard optimal\nfiltering with long records. We employ reasonable approximations to the noise\ncovariance function in order to render multi-pulse fitting computationally\nviable even for very long data records. The technique is employed to analyze\nx-ray emission spectra at 600 eV and 6 keV at rates up to 250 counts per second\nin microcalorimeters having exponential signal decay times of approximately 1.2\nms.\n", "  The NESSiE Collaboration has been setup to undertake a conclusive experiment\nto clarify the {\\em muon--neutrino disappearance} measurements at short\nbaselines in order to put severe constraints to models with more than the\nthree--standard neutrinos. To this aim the current FNAL--Booster neutrino beam\nfor a Short--Baseline experiment was carefully evaluated by considering the use\nof magnetic spectrometers at two sites, near and far ones. The detector\nlocations were studied, together with the achievable performances of two\nOPERA--like spectrometers. The study was constrained by the availability of\nexisting hardware and a time--schedule compatible with the undergoing project\nof multi--site Liquid--Argon detectors at FNAL.\n  The settled physics case and the kind of proposed experiment on the Booster\nneutrino beam would definitively clarify the existing tension between the\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$ disappearance and the $\\nu_e$ appearance/disappearance at the eV\nmass scale. In the context of neutrino oscillations the measurement of\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$ disappearance is a robust and fast approach to either reject or\ndiscover new neutrino states at the eV mass scale. We discuss an experimental\nprogram able to extend by more than one order of magnitude (for neutrino\ndisappearance) and by almost one order of magnitude (for antineutrino\ndisappearance) the present range of sensitivity for the mixing angle between\nstandard and sterile neutrinos. These extensions are larger than those achieved\nin any other proposal presented so far.\n", "  The experimental shock wave, discovery in quantum systems is the important\none through last years. This effect has several phenomenological explanations.\nIt seems to us there is interesting, especially from the systematical point of\nview, for high school student and scientists alike, to take the result from\n\"first principles\", that is \"with the tip of the pen\". It was made in the paper\nproposed.\n", "  Search in an environment with an uncertain distribution of resources involves\na trade-off between exploitation of past discoveries and further exploration.\nThis extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker shifts between\nreading in depth and studying new domains. To study this decision-making\nprocess, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated\nscientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books\nlisted in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic\nmodels to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading\ndecisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated,\ninformation-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of\nsurprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's\nbehavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually\nhigh levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts,\ndetected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual\nepochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's\nown self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts\nwith their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory\nthan the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal\nchanges are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our\nquantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework\nfor testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between\nshort- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic\nmodeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies of\ncollective scientific behavior.\n", "  A Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the ground state of an\nantiferromagnetic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with nearest and\nnext-nearest-neighbor interactions is re-investigated from a different\nperspective: An unequivocal correspondence is found between components of the\nscalar product $\\langle \\Psi_0| \\Psi_0 \\rangle$ and geometrical objects. One\ncan classify these objects according to whether any two of them can be\ntransformed into each other in a continuous way (belong to the same homotopy\nclass). A finite size scaling of the \"connection term`` $\\langle\n\\Psi_0|\\partial \\Psi_0 \\rangle$ with respect to chain length (16, 18, 20, 22,\n24 spins) for each homotopy class of above mentioned objects leads to the\ncritical value of $\\lambda$ with rather high accuracy.\n", "  The analysis of data from x-ray microcalorimeters requires great care; their\nexcellent intrinsic energy resolution cannot usually be achieved in practice\nwithout a statistically near-optimal pulse analysis and corrections for\nimportant systematic errors. We describe the essential parts of a\npulse-analysis pipeline for data from x-ray microcalorimeters, including steps\ntaken to reduce systematic gain variation and the unwelcome dependence of\nfiltered pulse heights on the exact pulse-arrival time. We find these steps\ncollectively to be essential tools for getting the best results from a\nmicrocalorimeter-based x-ray spectrometer.\n", "  In this paper we investigate whether the holographic principle proposed in\nstring theory has a classical counterpart in general relativity theory. We show\nthat there is a partial correspondence: at least in the case of vacuum Petrov\ntype D spacetimes that admit a non-trivial Killing tensor, which encompass all\nthe astrophysical black hole spacetimes, there exists a one to one\ncorrespondence between gravity in bulk and a two dimensional classical\nconformal scalar field on a null boundary.\n", "  We derive the low-energy Hamiltonian for a honeycomb lattice with anisotropy\nin the hopping parameters. Taking the reported Dirac Hamiltonian for the\nanisotropic honeycomb lattice, we obtain its optical conductivity tensor and\nits transmittance for normal incidence of linearly polarized light. Also, we\ncharacterize its dichroic character due to the anisotropic optical absorption.\nAs an application of our general findings, which reproduce the case of\nuniformly strained graphene, we study the optical properties of graphene under\na nonmechanical distortion.\n", "  For experiments with high arrival rates, reliable identification of\nnearly-coincident events can be crucial. For calorimetric measurements to\ndirectly measure the neutrino mass such as HOLMES, unidentified pulse pile-ups\nare expected to be a leading source of experimental error. Although Wiener\nfiltering can be used to recognize pile-up, it suffers errors due to\npulse-shape variation from detector nonlinearity, readout dependence on\nsub-sample arrival times, and stability issues from the ill-posed deconvolution\nproblem of recovering Dirac delta-functions from smooth data. Due to these\nfactors, we have developed a processing method that exploits singular value\ndecomposition to (1) separate single-pulse records from piled-up records in\ntraining data and (2) construct a model of single-pulse records that accounts\nfor varying pulse shape with amplitude, arrival time, and baseline level,\nsuitable for detecting nearly-coincident events. We show that the resulting\nprocessing advances can reduce the required performance specifications of the\ndetectors and readout system or, equivalently, enable larger sensor arrays and\nbetter constraints on the neutrino mass.\n", "  The main purpose of this article is to study from the geometric point of view\nthe problem of limit cycles bifurcation of perturbed completely integrable\nsystems.\n", "  This paper proposes a reconfigurable planar metamaterial that can be switched\nbetween capacitive and inductive responses using local changes in the\nelectrical conductivity of its constituent material. The proposed device is\nbased on Babinet's principle and exploits the singular electromagnetic\nresponses of metallic checkerboard structures, which are dependent on the local\nelectrical conductivity. Utilizing the heating-induced metal-insulator\ntransition of vanadium dioxide ($\\mathrm{VO}_2$), the proposed metamaterial is\ndesigned to compensate for the effect of the substrate and is experimentally\ncharacterized in the terahertz regime. This reconfigurable metamaterial can be\nutilized as a switchable filter and as a switchable phase shifter for terahertz\nwaves.\n", "  Scanning gate microscopy measurements in a circular ballistic cavity with a\ntip placed near its center yield a non-monotonic dependence of the conductance\non the tip voltage. Detailed numerical quantum calculations reproduce these\nconductance oscillations, and a classical scheme leads to its physical\nunderstanding. The large-amplitude conductance oscillations are shown to be of\nclassical origin, and well described by the effect of a particular class of\nshort trajectories.\n", "  Fixed points in QCD can appear when the number of quark flavors ($N_f$) is\nincreased above a certain critical value as proposed by Banks and Zaks (BZ).\nThere is also the possibility that QCD possess an effective charge indicating\nan infrared frozen coupling constant. In particular, an infrared frozen\ncoupling associated to dynamical gluon mass generation (DGM) does lead to a\nfixed point even for a small number of quarks. We compare the BZ and DGM\nmechanisms, their $\\beta$ functions and fixed points, and within the\napproximations of this work, which rely basically on extrapolations of the\ndynamical gluon masses at large $N_f$, we verify that near the so called QCD\nconformal window both cases exhibit fixed points at similar coupling constant\nvalues ($g^*$). We argue that the states of minimum vacuum energy, as a\nfunction of the coupling constant up to $g^*$ and for several $N_f$ values, are\nrelated to the dynamical gluon mass generation mechanism.\n", "  Links in many real-world networks activate and deactivate in correspondence\nto the sporadic interactions between the elements of the system. The activation\npatterns may be irregular or bursty and play an important role on the dynamics\nof processes taking place in the network. Information or disease spreading in\nnetworks are paradigmatic examples of this situation. Besides burstiness,\nseveral correlations may appear in the process of link activation: memory\neffects imply temporal correlations, but also the existence of communities in\nthe network may mediate the activation patterns of internal an external links.\nHere we study the competition of topological and temporal correlations in link\nactivation and how they affect the dynamics of systems running on the network.\nInterestingly, both types of correlations by separate have opposite effects:\none (topological) delays the dynamics of processes on the network, while the\nother (temporal) accelerates it. When they occur together, our results show\nthat the direction and intensity of the final outcome depends on the\ncompetition in a non trivial way.\n", "  We study how the cosmic environment affects galaxy evolution in the Universe\nby comparing the metallicities of dwarf galaxies in voids with dwarf galaxies\nin more dense regions. Ratios of the fluxes of emission lines, particularly\nthose of the forbidden [O III] and [S II] transitions, provide estimates of a\nregion's electron temperature and number density. From these two quantities and\nthe emission line fluxes [O II] 3727, [O III] 4363, and [O III] 4959,5007, we\nestimate the abundance of oxygen with the Direct Te method. We estimate the\nmetallicity of 42 blue, star-forming void dwarf galaxies and 89 blue,\nstar-forming dwarf galaxies in more dense regions using spectroscopic\nobservations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, as re-processed\nin the MPA-JHU value-added catalog. We find very little difference between the\ntwo sets of galaxies, indicating little influence from the large-scale\nenvironment on their chemical evolution. Of particular interest are a number of\nextremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies that are less prevalent in voids than in\nthe denser regions.\n", "  We address a long-standing problem of describing the thermodynamics of a\ncharged accelerating black hole. We derive a standard first law of black hole\nthermodynamics, with the usual identification of entropy proportional to the\narea of the event horizon -- even though the event horizon contains a conical\nsingularity. This result not only extends the applicability of black hole\nthermodynamics to realms previously not anticipated, it also opens a\npossibility for studying novel properties of an important class of exact\nradiative solutions of Einstein equations describing accelerated objects. We\ndiscuss the thermodynamic volume, stability and phase structure of these black\nholes.\n", "  We consider non-reversible random walks evolving on a potential field in a\nbounded domain of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. We describe the complete metastable behavior\nof the random walk among the landscape of valleys, and we derive the\nEyring-Kramers formula for the mean transition time from a metastable set to a\nstable set.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56\n(the Bullet Cluster), including the effects of elastic dark matter scattering.\nIn a similar manner to the stripping of gas by ram pressure, dark matter\nself-interactions would transfer momentum between the two galaxy cluster dark\nmatter haloes, causing them to lag behind the collisionless galaxies. The\nabsence of an observed separation between the dark matter and stellar\ncomponents in the Bullet Cluster has been used to place upper limits on the\ncross-section for dark matter scattering. We emphasise the importance of\nanalysing simulations in an observationally-motivated manner, finding that the\nway in which the positions of the various components are measured can have a\nlarger impact on derived constraints on dark matter's self-interaction\ncross-section than reasonable changes to the initial conditions for the merger.\nIn particular, we find that the methods used in previous studies to place some\nof the tightest constraints on this cross-section do not reflect what is done\nobservationally, and overstate the Bullet Cluster's ability to constrain the\nparticle properties of dark matter. We introduce the first simulations of the\nBullet Cluster including both self-interacting dark matter and gas. We find\nthat as the gas is stripped it introduces radially-dependent asymmetries into\nthe stellar and dark matter distributions. As the techniques used to determine\nthe positions of the dark matter and galaxies are sensitive to different radial\nscales, these asymmetries can lead to erroneously measured offsets between dark\nmatter and galaxies even when they are spatially coincident.\n", "  In this paper, we study the relativistic quantum problem of a particle\nconstrained to a double cone surface. For this purpose, we build the Dirac\nequation in a curved space using the tetrads formalism. Two cases are analysed.\nFirst, we consider a free particle on a double cone surface, and then we add an\nuniform magnetic field. The energy spectrum is obtained and the instability of\nthe motion is discussed. We show that the magnetic field breaks the nappe\ndegeneracy, inducing different energy spectra for each nappe. The results\nobtained here can be applied, for instance, in he investigation of the\nelectronic and transport properties of condensed matter systems that can be\ndescribed by an effective Dirac equation, such as graphene and topological\ninsulators.\n", "  Large-radius translation invariant (TI) bipolarons are considered in a\none-dimensional Holstein molecular chain. Criteria of their stability are\nobtained. The energy of a translation invariant bipolaron is shown to be lower\nthan that of a bipolaron with broken symmetry. The results obtained are applied\nto the problem of superconductivity in 1D-systems. It is shown that\nTI-bipolaron mechanism of Bose-Einstein condensation can support\nsuperconductivity even for infinite chain.\n", "  We investigate the sub gap properties of a three terminal Josephson\nT-junction composed of topologically superconducting wires connected by a\nnormal metal region. This system naturally hosts zero energy Andreev bound\nstates which are of self-conjugate Majorana nature and we show that they are,\nin contrast to ordinary Majorana zero modes, spatially extended in the normal\nmetal region. If the T-junction respects time-reversal symmetry, we show that a\nzero mode is distributed only in two out of three arms in the junction and\ntuning the superconducting phases allows for transfer of the mode between the\njunction arms. We further provide tunneling conductance calculations showing\nthat these features can be detected in experiments. Our findings suggest an\nexperimental platform for studying the nature of spatially extended Majorana\nzero modes.\n", "  In this article, we study the $C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C$ type and $C\\otimes\nC$ type scalar $cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with the QCD sum rules by\ncalculating the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to dimension 10 in a\nconsistent way. The ground state masses $M_{C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C}=3.89\\pm\n0.05\\,\\rm{GeV}$ and $M_{C\\otimes C}=5.48\\pm0.10\\,\\rm{GeV}$ support assigning\nthe $X(3915)$ to be the ground state $C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C$ type\ntetraquark state with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, but do not support assigning the\n$X(4700)$ to be the ground state $C\\otimes C$ type $cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$\ntetraquark state with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. Then we tentatively assign the $X(3915)$\nand $X(4500)$ to be the 1S and 2S $C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C$ type scalar\n$cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$ tetraquark states respectively, and obtain the 1S mass\n$M_{\\rm 1S}=3.85^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\\,\\rm{GeV}$ and 2S mass $M_{\\rm\n2S}=4.35^{+0.10}_{-0.11}\\,\\rm{GeV}$ from the QCD sum rules, which support\nassigning the $X(3915)$ to be the 1S $C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C$ type\ntetraquark state, but do not support assigning the $X(4500)$ to be the 2S\n$C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C$ type tetraquark state.\n", "  We propose a non-associative phase space algebra for M-theory backgrounds\nwith locally non-geometric fluxes based on the non-associative algebra of\noctonions. Our proposal is based on the observation that the non-associative\nalgebra of the non-geometric R-flux background in string theory can be obtained\nby a proper contraction of the simple Malcev algebra generated by imaginary\noctonions. Furthermore, by studying a toy model of a four-dimensional locally\nnon-geometric M-theory background which is dual to a twisted torus, we show\nthat the non-geometric background is \"missing\" a momentum mode. The resulting\nseven-dimensional phase space can thus be naturally identified with the\nimaginary octonions. This allows us to interpret the full uncontracted algebra\nof imaginary octonions as the uplift of the string theory R-flux algebra to\nM-theory, with the contraction parameter playing the role of the string\ncoupling constant $g_s$.\n", "  Superconducting electron systems of solids hosting flat bands are studied,\nwith a view to improved understanding of the fundamental physics giving rise to\nhigh-temperature superconductivity. We present a modified form of the set of\nGor'kov equations of BCS theory that incorporates a Mott-like gap in the\nsingle-particle spectrum. Such a quantity is emergent in systems with flat\nbands having interactions repulsive in the Cooper channel, provided\nparticle-hole symmetry is broken. The equations so obtained are applied to the\nelucidation of features of the two-gap structure of single-particle spectra of\nunderdoped high-$T_c$ superconductors, as revealed in angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectrometry.\n", "  The $B_s^0\\pi^\\pm$ invariant mass distribution is investigated in order to\nsearch for possible exotic meson states. The analysis is based on a data sample\nrecorded with the LHCb detector corresponding to $3$ fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$\ncollision data at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ and $8$ TeV. No significant excess is found,\nand upper limits are set on the production rate of the claimed $X(5568)$ state\nwithin the LHCb acceptance. Upper limits are also set as a function of the mass\nand width of a possible exotic meson decaying to the $B_s^0\\pi^\\pm$ final\nstate. The same limits also apply to a possible exotic meson decaying through\nthe chain $B_s^{*0}\\pi^\\pm$, $B_s^{*0} \\to B_s^0 \\gamma$ where the photon is\nexcluded from the reconstructed decays.\n", "  A new scheme for building two dimensional laser arrays that operate in the\nsingle supermode regime is proposed. This is done by introducing an optical\ncoupling between the laser array and a lossy pseudo-isospectral chain of\nphotonic resonators. The spectrum of this discrete reservoir is tailored to\nsuppress all the supermodes of the main array except the fundamental one. This\nspectral engineering is facilitated by employing the Householder transformation\nin conjunction with discrete supersymmetry. The proposed scheme is general and\ncan in principle be used in different platforms such as VCSEL arrays and\nphotonic crystal laser arrays.\n", "  We find that generic boundary conditions of Weyl semimetal is dictated by\nonly a single real parameter, in the continuum limit. We determine how the\nenergy dispersions (the Fermi arcs) and the wave functions of edge states\ndepend on this parameter. Lattice models are found to be consistent with our\ngeneric observation. Furthermore, the enhanced parameter space of the boundary\ncondition is shown to support a novel topological number.\n", "  A comprehensive theoretical study of the E1, M1, E2 transitions of Ca-like\ntungsten ions is presented. Using multi-configuration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) method\nwith a restricted active space treatment, the wavelengths and probabilities of\nthe M1 and E2 transitions between the multiplets of the ground state\nconfiguration ([Ne]3s$^{2}$3p$^{6}$3d$^{2}$) and of the E1 transitions between\n[Ne]3s$^{2}$3p$^{5}$3d$^{3}$ and [Ne]3s$^{2}$3p$^{6}$3d$^{2}$ have been\ncalculated. The results are in reasonable agreement with available experimental\ndata. The present E1 and M1 calculations are compared with previous theoretical\nvalues. For E2 transitions, the importance of electron correlation from 3s and\n3p orbitals is pointed out. Several strong E1 transitions are predicted, which\nhave potential advantage for plasma diagnostics.\n", "  Since the recent detection of an astrophysical flux of high energy neutrinos,\nthe question of its origin has not yet fully been answered. Much of what is\nknown about this flux comes from a small event sample of high neutrino purity,\ngood energy resolution, but large angular uncertainties. In searches for\npoint-like sources, on the other hand, the best performance is given by using\nlarge statistics and good angular reconstructions. Track-like muon events\nproduced in neutrino interactions satisfy these requirements. We present here\nthe results of searches for point-like sources with neutrinos using data\nacquired by the IceCube detector over seven years from 2008--2015. The\ndiscovery potential of the analysis in the northern sky is now significantly\nbelow $E_\\nu^2d\\phi/dE_\\nu=10^{-12}\\:\\mathrm{TeV\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$, on average\n$38\\%$ lower than the sensitivity of the previously published analysis of four\nyears exposure. No significant clustering of neutrinos above background\nexpectation was observed, and implications for prominent neutrino source\ncandidates are discussed.\n", "  We present a time domain waveform model that describes the\ninspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) of compact binary systems whose components are\nnon-spinning, and which evolve on orbits with low to moderate eccentricity. The\ninspiral evolution is described using third order post-Newtonian equations both\nfor the equations of motion of the binary, and its far-zone radiation field.\nThis latter component also includes instantaneous, tails and tails-of-tails\ncontributions, and a contribution due to non-linear memory. This framework\nreduces to the post-Newtonian approximant TaylorT4 at third post-Newtonian\norder in the zero eccentricity limit. To improve phase accuracy, we incorporate\nhigher-order post-Newtonian corrections for the energy flux of quasi-circular\nbinaries and gravitational self-force corrections to the binding energy of\ncompact binaries. This enhanced inspiral evolution prescription is combined\nwith an analytical prescription for the merger-ringdown evolution using a\ncatalog of numerical relativity simulations. This IMR waveform model reproduces\neffective-one-body waveforms for systems with mass-ratios between 1 to 15 in\nthe zero eccentricity limit. Using a set of eccentric numerical relativity\nsimulations, not used during calibration, we show that our eccentric model\naccurately reproduces the features of eccentric compact binary coalescence\nthroughout the merger. Using this model we show that the gravitational wave\ntransients GW150914 and GW151226 can be effectively recovered with template\nbanks of quasi-circular, spin-aligned waveforms if the eccentricity $e_0$ of\nthese systems when they enter the aLIGO band at a gravitational wave frequency\nof 14 Hz satisfies $e_0^{\\rm GW150914}\\leq0.15$ and $e_0^{\\rm\nGW151226}\\leq0.1$.\n", "  Benefited from the advantages on environmental benign, easy purification, and\nhigh thermal stability, the recently synthesized two-dimensional (2D) material\nMoN2 shows great potential for clean and renewable energy applications. Here,\nthrough first-principles calculations, we show that the monolayered MoN2 is\npromising to be a high capacity electrode material for metal ion batteries.\nFirstly, identified by phonon dispersion and exfoliation energy calculations,\nMoN2 monolayer is proved to be structurally stable and could be exfoliated from\nits bulk counterpart in experiments. Secondly, all the studied metal atoms (Li,\nNa and K) can be adsorbed on MoN2 monolayer, with both pristine and doped MoN2\nbeing metallic. Thirdly, the metal atoms possess moderate/low migration\nbarriers on MoN2, which ensures excellent cycling performance as a battery\nelectrode. In addition, the calculated average voltages suggest that MoN2\nmonolayer is suitable to be a cathode for Li-ion battery and anodes for Na-ion\nand K-ion batteries. Most importantly, as a cathode for Li-ion battery, MoN2\npossesses a comparable average voltage but a 1-2 times larger capacity (432 mA\nh g-1) than usual commercial cathode materials; as an anode for Na-ion battery,\nthe theoretical capacity (864 mA h g-1) of MoN2 is 2-5 times larger than\ntypical 2D anode materials such as MoS2 and most MXenes. Finally we also\nprovide an estimation of capacities for other transition-metal dinitrides\nmaterials. Our work suggests that the transition-metal dinitrides MoN2 is an\nappealing 2D electrode materials with high storage capacities.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of the spacelike nucleon electromagnetic\nform factors and their flavor decomposition within the framework of light-front\nholographic QCD. We show that the inclusion of the higher Fock components $\\ket\n{qqqq\\bar{q}}$ has a significant effect on the spin-flip elastic Pauli form\nfactor and almost zero effect on the spin-conserving Dirac form factor. We\npresent light-front holographic QCD results for the proton and neutron form\nfactors at any momentum transfer range, including asymptotic predictions, and\nshow that our results agree with the available experimental data with high\naccuracy. In order to correctly describe the Pauli form factor we need an\nadmixture of a five quark state of about 30$\\%$ in the proton and about 40$\\%$\nin the neutron. We also extract the nucleon charge and magnetic radii and\nperform a flavor decomposition of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. The\nfree parameters needed to describe the experimental nucleon form factors are\nvery few: two parameters for the probabilities of higher Fock states for the\nspin-flip form factor and a phenomenological parameter $r$, required to account\nfor possible SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry breaking effects in the neutron,\nwhereas the Pauli form factors are normalized to the experimental values of the\nanomalous magnetic moments. The covariant spin structure for the Dirac and\nPauli nucleon form factors prescribed by AdS$_5$ semiclassical gravity\nincorporates the correct twist scaling behavior from hard scattering and also\nleads to vector dominance at low energy.\n", "  We report on a chiral nanostructure, which we term a \"butterfly nanoantenna,\"\nthat, when used in a metasurface, allows the direct conversion of a linearly\npolarized beam into a nonlinear optical far-field of arbitrary complexity. The\nbutterfly nanoantenna exhibits field enhancement in its gap for every incident\nlinear polarization, which can be exploited to drive nonlinear optical emitters\nwithin the gap, for the structuring of light within a frequency range not\naccessible by linear plasmonics. As the polarization, phase and amplitude of\nthe field in the gap are highly controlled, nonlinear emitters within the gap\nbehave as an idealized Huygens source. A general framework is thereby proposed\nwherein the butterfly nanoantennas can be arranged on a surface to produce a\nhighly structured far-field nonlinear optical beam with high purity. A third\nharmonic Laguerre-Gauss beam carrying an optical orbital angular momentum of 41\nis demonstrated as an example, through large-scale simulations on a\nhigh-performance computing platform of the full plasmonic metasurface with an\narea large enough to contain up to 3600 nanoantennas.\n", "  We demonstrate that a self-complementary checkerboard-like metasurface works\nas a broadband coherent perfect absorber (CPA) when symmetrically illuminated\nby two counter-propagating incident waves. A theoretical analysis based on wave\ninterference and results of numerical simulations of the proposed metasurface\nare provided. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate the proposed CPA in\nthe terahertz regime by using a time-domain spectroscopy technique. We observe\nthat the metasurface can work as a CPA below its lowest diffraction frequency.\nThe size of the absorptive areas of the proposed CPA can be much smaller than\nthe incident wavelength. Unlike conventional CPAs, the presented one\nsimultaneously achieves the broadband operation and energy concentration of\nelectromagnetic waves at the deep-subwavelength scale.\n", "  We investigate scalar particle creation in a set of bouncing models where the\nbounce occurs due to quantum cosmological effects described by the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation. The scalar field can be either conformally or\nminimally coupled to gravity, and it can be massive or massless, without self\ninteraction. The analysis is made for models containing a single radiation\nfluid, and for the more realistic case of models containing the usual observed\nradiation and dust fluids, which can fit most of the observed features of our\nUniverse, including an almost scale invariant power spectrum of scalar\ncosmological perturbations. In the conformal coupling case, the particle\nproduction is negligible. In the minimal coupling case, for massive particles,\nthe results point to the same physical conclusion within observational\nconstraints: particle production is most important at the bounce energy scale,\nand it is not sensitive neither to its mass nor whether there is dust in the\nbackground model. The only caveat is the case where the particle mass is larger\nthan the bounce energy scale. On the other hand, the energy density of produced\nmassive particles depend on their masses and the energy scale of the bounce.\nFor very large masses and deep bounces, this energy density may overcome that\nof the background. In the case of massless particles, the energy density of\nproduced particles can become comparable to the background energy density only\nfor bounces occurring at energy scales comparable to the Planck scale or above,\nwhich lies beyond the scope of this paper: we expect that the simple\nWheeler-DeWitt approach we are using should be valid only at scales some few\norders of magnitude below the Planck energy. Nevertheless, in the case in which\ndust is present, there is an infrared divergence, which becomes important only\nfor scales much larger than today's Hubble radius.\n", "  We study perturbative unitarity in a Lorentz-symmetry-violating QED model\nwith higher-order derivative operators in the light of the results of Lee and\nWick to preserve unitarity in indefinite metric theories. Specifically, we\nconsider the fermionic sector of the Myers-Pospelov model, which includes\ndimension-five operators, coupled to standard photons. We canonically quantize\nthe model, paying attention to its effective character, and show that its\nHamiltonian is stable, emphasizing the exact stage at which the indefinite\nmetric appears and decomposes into a positive-metric sector and a\nnegative-metric sector. Finally, we verify the optical theorem at the one-loop\nlevel in the annihilation channel of the forward-scattering process $e^+(p_2,\nr) + e^-(p_1,s)$ by applying the Lee-Wick prescription in which the states\nassociated with the negative metric are left out from the asymptotic Hilbert\nspace, but nevertheless are considered in the loop integration via the\npropagator.\n", "  Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$ provides a material platform to study three-dimensional\nquantum spin liquids in the geometrically frustrated hyperkagome lattice of\nIr$^{4+}$ ions. In this work, we consider quantum spin liquids on hyperkagome\nlattice for generic spin models, focusing on the effects of anisotropic spin\ninteractions. In particular, we classify possible $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$\nspin liquid states, following the projective symmetry group analysis in the\nslave-fermion representation. There are only three distinct $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin\nliquids, together with 2 different $U(1)$ spin liquids. The non-symmorphic\nspace group symmetry of hyperkagome lattice plays a vital role in simplifying\nthe classification, forbidding \"$\\pi$-flux\" or \"staggered-flux\" phases in\ncontrast to symmorphic space groups. We further prove that both $U(1)$ states\nand one $Z_2$ state among all 3 are symmetry-protected gapless spin liquids,\nrobust against any symmetry-preserving perturbations. Motivated by the\n\"spin-freezing\" behavior recently observed in Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$ at low\ntemperatures, we further investigate the nearest-neighbor spin model with\ndominant Heisenberg interaction subject to all possible anisotropic\nperturbations from spin-orbit couplings. We found a $U(1)$ spin liquid ground\nstate with spinon fermi surfaces is energetically favored over $Z_2$ states.\nAmong all spin-orbit coupling terms, we show that only Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\n(DM) interaction can induce spin anisotropy in the ground state when perturbing\nfrom the isotropic Heisenberg limit. Our work paves the way for a systematic\nstudy of quantum spin liquids in various materials with a hyperkagome crystal\nstructure.\n", "  Recently Weyl fermions have attracted increasing interest in condensed matter\nphysics due to their rich phenomenology originated from their nontrivial\nmonopole charges. Here we present a theory of real Dirac points that can be\nunderstood as real monopoles in momentum space, serving as a real\ngeneralization of Weyl fermions with the reality being endowed by the $PT$\nsymmetry. The real counterparts of topological features of Weyl semimetals,\nsuch as Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, $2$D sub topological insulators and\nFermi arcs, are studied in the $PT$ symmetric Dirac semimetals, and the\nunderlying reality-dependent topological structures are discussed. In\nparticular, we construct a minimal model of the real Dirac semimetals based on\nrecently proposed cold atom experiments and quantum materials about $PT$\nsymmetric Dirac nodal line semimetals.\n", "  We explore the warm inflation scenario theoretical predictions looking at two\ndifferent dissipative regimes for several representative primordial potentials.\nAs it is well known, the warm inflation is able to decrease the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio value, rehabilitating several primordial potential ruled\nout in the cold inflation context by the recent cosmic microwave background\ndata. Here we show that it is also able to produce a running of the running\n$n_s\"$ positive and within the Planck data limits. This is very remarkable\nsince the standard cold inflation model is unable to justify the current\nindication of a positive constraint on $n_s\"$. We achieve a parameterization\nfor the primordial power spectrum able to take into account higher order\neffects as the running of the spectral index and the running of the running,\nand we perform statistical analysis using the most up-to-date Planck data to\nconstrain the dissipative effects. We find that the warm inflation can explain\nthe current observables with a good statistical significance, even for those\npotentials ruled out in the simplest cold inflation scenario.\n", "  Based on a dynamical formation model of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), we\nestimate the expected observational profile of gravitational wave at\nground-based detectors, such as KAGRA or advanced LIGO/VIRGO. Noting that the\nsecond generation of detectors have enough sensitivity from 10 Hz and up\n(especially with KAGRA owing to its location at less seismic noise), we are\nable to detect the ring-down gravitational wave of a BH with the mass $M <\n2\\times 10^3 M_\\odot $. This enables us to check the sequence of BH mergers to\nSMBHs via intermediate-mass BHs. We estimate the number density of galaxies\nfrom the halo formation model and estimate the number of BH mergers from the\ngiant molecular cloud model assuming hierarchical growth of merged cores. At\nthe designed KAGRA (and/or advanced LIGO/VIRGO), we find that the BH merger of\nits total mass $M\\sim 60M_\\odot$ is at the peak of the expected mass\ndistribution. With its signal-to-noise ratio $\\rho=10 (30)$, we estimate the\nevent rate $R \\sim 200 (20)$ per year in the most optimistic case, and we also\nfind that BH mergers in the range $M < 150 M_\\odot$ are $R>1$ per year for\n$\\rho=10$. Thus, if we observe a BH with more than $100 M_\\odot$ in future\ngravitational-wave observations, our model naturally explains its source.\n", "  We estimate contributions from Kaluza-Klein excitations of third generation\nquarks and gauge bosons to the branching ratio of $B\\rightarrow X_s\\gamma$\ndecay process in 5-Dimensional Universal Extra Dimensional scenario with\nnon-vanishing boundary localised terms. This model is conventionally known as\nnon-minimal Universal Extra Dimensional model. We have derived the lower limit\non the size of the extra dimension by comparing our theoretical estimation of\nthe branching ratio which includes next-to-next-to leading order QCD\ncorrections with its experimentally measured value. Coefficients of the\nboundary localised terms have also been constrained. 95 \\% C.L. lower limit on\ninverse of radius of compactification ($R^{-1}$) can be as large as 670 GeV for\nsome choice of the value of coefficients of boundary localised terms.\n", "  We investigate at the subscale of the neighborhoods of a highly populated\ncity the incidence of property crimes in terms of both the resident and the\nfloating population. Our results show that a relevant allometric relation could\nonly be observed between property crimes and floating population. More\nprecisely, the evidence of a superlinear behavior indicates that a\ndisproportional number of property crimes occurs in regions where an increased\nflow of people takes place in the city. For comparison, we also found that the\nnumber of crimes of peace disturbance only correlates well, and in a\nsuperlinear fashion too, with the resident population. Our study raises the\ninteresting possibility that the superlinearity observed in previous studies\n[Bettencourt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104, 7301 (2007) and Melo et\nal., Sci. Rep. 4, 6239 (2014)] for homicides versus population at the city\nscale could have its origin in the fact that the floating population, and not\nthe resident one, should be taken as the relevant variable determining the\nintrinsic microdynamical behavior of the system.\n", "  We have developed a real-space method to correct distortion due to thermal\ndrift and piezoelectric actuator nonlinearities on scanning tunneling\nmicroscope images using Matlab. The method uses the known structures typically\npresent in high-resolution atomic and molecularly-resolved images as an\ninternal standard. Each image feature (atom or molecule) is first identified in\nthe image. The locations of each feature's nearest neighbors (NNs) are used to\nmeasure the local distortion at that location. The local distortion map across\nthe image is simultaneously fit to our distortion model, which includes thermal\ndrift in addition to piezoelectric actuator hysteresis and creep. The image\ncoordinates of the features and image pixels are corrected using an inverse\ntransform from the distortion model. We call this technique the thermal-drift,\nhysteresis, and creep transform (DHCT). Performing the correction in real space\nallows defects, domain boundaries, and step edges to be excluded with a spatial\nmask. Additional real-space image analyses are now possible with these\ncorrected images. Using graphite(0001) as model system, we show lattice fitting\nto the corrected image, averaged unit cell images, and symmetry-averaged unit\ncell images. Statistical analysis of the distribution of the image features\naround their best-fit lattice sites measures the aggregate noise in the image,\nwhich can be expressed as feature confidence ellipsoids.\n", "  The $N$-jettiness subtraction has proven to be an efficient method to perform\ndifferential QCD next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations in the last\nfew years. One important ingredient of this method is the NNLO soft function.\nWe calculate this soft function for one massive colored particle production at\nhadron colliders. We select the color octet and color triplet cases to present\nthe final results. We also discuss its application in NLO and NNLO differential\ncalculations.\n", "  Dispersion studies are conducted on 1m long multimode polymer spiral\nwaveguides with different refractive index profiles. Bandwidth-length products\n>40GHzxm are obtained from such waveguides under a 50/125 um MMF, indicating\nthe potential of this technology.\n", "  Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising components in future\nnanoelectronics due to the large mobility of graphene electrons and their\ntunable electronic band gap in combination with recent experimental\ndevelopments of on-surface chemistry strategies for their growth. Here we\nexplore a prototype 4-terminal semiconducting device formed by two crossed\narmchair GNRs (AGNRs) using state-of-the-art first-principles transport\nmethods. We analyze in detail the roles of intersection angle, stacking order,\ninter-GNR separation, and finite voltages on the transport characteristics.\nInterestingly, when the AGNRs intersect at $\\theta= 60^\\circ$, electrons\ninjected from one terminal can be split into two outgoing waves with a tunable\nratio around 50% and with almost negligible back-reflection. The splitted\nelectron wave is found to propagate partly straight across the intersection\nregion in one ribbon and partly in one direction of the other ribbon, i.e., in\nanalogy of an optical beam splitter. Our simulations further identify realistic\nconditions for which this semiconducting device can act as a mechanically\ncontrollable electronic beam splitter with possible applications in\ncarbon-based quantum electronic circuits and electron optics. We rationalize\nour findings with a simple model that suggests that electronic beam splitters\ncan generally be realized with crossed GNRs.\n", "  Manipulation of magnetization by electric field is a central goal of\nspintronics because it enables energy-efficient operation of spin-based\ndevices. Spin wave devices are promising candidates for low-power information\nprocessing but a method for energy-efficient excitation of short-wavelength\nspin waves has been lacking. Here we show that spin waves in nanoscale magnetic\ntunnel junctions can be generated via parametric resonance induced by electric\nfield. Parametric excitation of magnetization is a versatile method of\nshort-wavelength spin wave generation, and thus our results pave the way\ntowards energy-efficient nanomagnonic devices.\n", "  We complete the generalisation of the BCFW recursion relation to the\noff-shell case, allowing for the computation of tree level scattering\namplitudes for full High Energy Factorisation (HEF), i.e. with both incoming\npartons having a non-vanishing transverse momentum. We provide explicit results\nfor color-ordered amplitudes with two off-shell legs in massless QCD up to 4\npoint, continuing the program begun in two previous papers. For the 4-fermion\namplitudes, which are not BCFW-recursible, we perform a diagrammatic\ncomputation, so as to offer a complete set of expressions. We explicitly show\nand discuss some plots of the squared $2 \\rightarrow 2$ matrix elements as\nfunctions of the differences in rapidity and azimuthal angle of the final state\nparticles.\n", "  Several materials in the regime of strong spin-orbit interaction such as\nHgTe, the pyrochlore iridate Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, and the half-Heusler compound\nLaPtBi, as well as various systems related to these three prototype materials,\nare believed to host a quadratic band touching point at the Fermi level.\nRecently, it has been proposed that such a three-dimensional gapless state is\nunstable to a Mott-insulating ground state at low temperatures when the number\nof band touching points $N$ at the Fermi level is smaller than a certain\ncritical number $N_c$. We further substantiate and quantify this scenario by\nvarious approaches. Using $\\epsilon$ expansion near two spatial dimensions, we\nshow that $N_c = 64/(25 \\epsilon^2) + O(1/\\epsilon)$ and demonstrate that the\ninstability for $N < N_c$ is towards a nematic ground state that can be\nunderstood as if the system were under (dynamically generated) uniaxial strain.\nWe also propose a truncation of the functional renormalization group equations\nin the dynamical bosonization scheme which we show to agree to one-loop order\nwith the results from $\\epsilon$ expansion both near two as well as near four\ndimensions, and which smoothly interpolates between these two perturbatively\naccessible limits for general $2<d<4$. Directly in $d=3$ we therewith find $N_c\n= 1.86$, and thus again above the physical $N=1$. All these results are\nconsistent with the prediction that the interacting ground state of pure,\nunstrained HgTe, and possibly also Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, is a strong topological\ninsulator with a dynamically-generated gap -- a topological Mott insulator.\n", "  Using geomterothermodynamics (GTD), we investigate the phase transition of\nblack hole in a metric independent way. We show that for any black hole,\ncurvature scalar (of equilibrium state space geometry) is singular at the point\nwhere specific heat diverges. Previously such a result could only be shown by\ntaking specific examples on a case by case basis. A different type of phase\ntransition, where inverse specific heat diverges, is also studied within this\nframework. We show that in the latter case, metric (of equilibrium state space\ngeometry) is singular instead of curvature scalar. Since a metric singularity\nmay be a coordinate artifact, we propose that GTD indicates that it is the\nsingularity of specific heat and not inverse specific heat which indicates a\nphase transition of black holes.\n", "  We calculate the large deviation functions characterizing the long-time\nfluctuations of the occupation of drifted Brownian motion and show that these\nfunctions have non-analytic points. This provides the first example of\ndynamical phase transition that appears in a simple, homogeneous Markov process\nwithout an additional low-noise, large-volume or hydrodynamic scaling limit.\n", "  The so-called \"optimal filter\" analysis of a microcalorimeter's x-ray pulses\nis statistically optimal only if all pulses have the same shape, regardless of\nenergy. The shapes of pulses from a nonlinear detector can and do depend on the\npulse energy, however. A pulse-fitting procedure that we call \"tangent\nfiltering\" accounts for the energy dependence of the shape and should therefore\nachieve superior energy resolution. We take a geometric view of the\npulse-fitting problem and give expressions to predict how much the energy\nresolution stands to benefit from such a procedure. We also demonstrate the\nmethod with a case study of K-line fluorescence from several 3d transition\nmetals. The method improves the resolution from 4.9 eV to 4.2 eV at the Cu\nK$\\alpha$ line (8.0keV).\n", "  The Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction is a key measure to constrain the neutral\nstate of the intergalactic medium and then to understand how the universe was\nfully reionized. We combine deep narrowband imaging data from the custom-made\nfilter NB393 and the $H_{2}S$1 filter centered at 2.14 $\\mu$m to examine the\nLy$\\alpha$ emitters and H$\\alpha$ emitters at the same redshift $z=2.24$. The\ncombination of these two populations allows us to determine the Ly$\\alpha$\nescape fraction at $z=2.24$. Over an area of 383 arcmin$^{2}$ in the Extended\nChandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), 124 Ly$\\alpha$ emitters are detected down to\nNB393 = 26.4 mag at the 5$\\sigma$ level, and 56 H$\\alpha$ emitters come from\nAn14. Of these, four have both Ly$\\alpha$ and H$\\alpha$ emissions (LAHAEs). We\nmeasure the individual/volumetric Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction by comparing the\nobserved Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity/luminosity density to the extinction-corrected\nH$\\alpha$ luminosity/luminosity density. We revisit the extinction correction\nfor H$\\alpha$ emitters using the Galactic extinction law with the color excess\nfor nebular emission. We also adopt the Calzetti extinction law together with\nan identical color excess for stellar and nebular regions to explore how the\nuncertainties in extinction correction affect our results. In both cases, an\nanti-correlation between the Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction and dust attenuation is\nfound among the LAHAEs, suggesting that dust absorption is responsible for the\nsuppression of the escaping Ly$\\alpha$ photons. However, the estimated\nLy$\\alpha$ escape fraction of individual LAHAEs varies up to ~3 percentage\npoints between the two methods of extinction correction. We find the global\nLy$\\alpha$ escape fraction at $z=2.24$ to be ($3.7\\pm1.4$)% in the ECDFS. The\nvariation in the color excess of the extinction causes a discrepancy of ~1\npercentage point in the global Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction.\n", "  A number of authors have proposed that the statistically significant orbital\nalignment of the most distant Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) is evidence of an\nas-yet undetected planet in the outer solar system, now referred to\ncolloquially a \"Planet Nine\". Dynamical simulations by Batygin & Brown (2016)\nhave provided constraints on the range of the planet's possible orbits and sky\nlocations. We extend these investigations by exploring the suggestion of\nMalhotra et al. (2016) that Planet Nine is in small integer ratio mean-motion\nresonances (MMRs) with several of the most distant KBOs. We show that the\nobserved KBO semi-major axes present a set of commensurabilities with an unseen\nplanet at $\\sim 654 \\ \\mathrm{AU}$ ($P \\sim 16,725 \\ \\mathrm{yr}$) that has a\ngreater than $98\\%$ chance of stemming from a sequence of MMRs rather than from\na random distribution. We describe and implement a Monte-Carlo optimization\nscheme that drives billion-year dynamical integrations of the outer solar\nsystem to pinpoint the orbital properties of perturbers that are capable of\nmaintaining the KBOs' apsidal alignment. This optimization exercise suggests\nthat the unseen planet is most consistently represented with mass, $m \\sim 6-12\nM_{\\oplus}$, semi-major axis, $a \\sim 654 \\ \\mathrm{AU}$, eccentricity,\n$e\\sim0.45$, inclination, $i \\sim 30^{\\circ}$, argument of periastron, $\\omega\n\\sim 150^{\\circ}$, longitude of ascending node, $\\Omega \\sim 50^{\\circ}$, and\nmean anomaly, $M \\sim 180^{\\circ}$. A range of sky locations relative to this\nfiducial ephemeris are possible. We find that the region $30^{\\circ}\\, \\lesssim\n\\mathrm{RA} \\lesssim 50^{\\circ}$, $-20^{\\circ}\\, \\lesssim \\mathrm{Dec} \\lesssim\n20^{\\circ}$ is promising.\n", "  We perform the high-performance computation of the ferromagnetic Ising model\non the pyrochlore lattice. We determine the critical temperature accurately\nbased on the finite-size scaling of the Binder ratio. Comparing with the data\non the simple cubic lattice, we argue the universal finite-size scaling. We\nalso calculate the classical XY model and the classical Heisenberg model on the\npyrochlore lattice.\n", "  Mc Gaugh et al. (2016) have found, by investigating a large sample of\nSpirals, a tight non linear relationship between the total radial acceleration,\nconnected with the Dark Matter phenomenon, and its component which comes from\nthe distribution of baryonic matter, as the stellar and HI disks. The strong\nlink between these two quantities is considered by them and by other\nresearchers, as challenging the scenario featuring the presence of DM halos in\ngalaxies. Or, at least, to indicate the peculiar nature of the underlying dark\nmatter particles. We have explored this issue by investigating a larger number\nof galaxies by means of several techniques of analysis. Our results support and\neven increase, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the validity of McGaugh\net al. (2016) 's relationship. However, we prove that such relationship exists\nalso in the scenario featuring dark matter halos + ordinary baryonic matter and\nthat it arises by the fact the DM is less concentrated than the luminous matter\nand it is progressively more abundant in lower luminosity objects. These\nproperties are due to well known astrophysical effects: the implications of\nthis relationship for the properties of dark matter halos are nothing of new or\nof unexpected. The relationship, definitively, is not a portal to go beyond the\nstandard picture of $\\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation.\n", "  Direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method with simplified Bernoulli-trials\n(SBT) collision scheme has been used to study the rarefied pressure-driven\nnitrogen flow through diverging microchannels. The fluid behaviours flowing\nbetween two plates with different divergence angles ranging between 0$^{\\circ}$\nto 17$^{\\circ}$ are described at different pressure ratios\n(1.5${\\le}{\\prod}{\\le}$2.5) and Knudsen numbers (0.03${\\le}$Kn${\\le}$12.7). The\nprimary flow field properties, including pressure, velocity, and temperature,\nare presented for divergent microchannels and are compared with those of a\nmicrochannel with a uniform cross-section. The variations of the flow field\nproperties in divergent microchannels, which are influenced by the area change,\nthe channel pressure ratio and the rarefication are discussed. The results show\nno flow separation in divergent microchannels for all the range of simulation\nparameters studied in the present work. It has been found that a divergent\nchannel can carry higher amounts of mass in comparison with an equivalent\nstraight channel geometry. A correlation between the mass flow rate through\nmicrochannels, the divergence angle, the pressure ratio, and the Knudsen number\nhas been suggested. The present numerical findings prove the occurrence of\nKnudsen minimum phenomenon in micro- and Nano- channels with non-uniform\ncross-sections.\n", "  We present HST spectroscopy for 45 cataclysmic variables (CVs), observed with\nHST/COS and HST/STIS. For 36 CVs, the white dwarf is recognisable through its\nbroad Ly$\\alpha$ absorption profile and we measure the white dwarf effective\ntemperatures ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) by fitting the HST data assuming\n$\\log\\,g=8.35$, which corresponds to the average mass for CV white dwarfs\n($\\simeq\\,0.8\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$). Our results nearly double the number of CV\nwhite dwarfs with an accurate temperature measurement. We find that CVs above\nthe period gap have, on average, higher temperatures ($\\langle T_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n\\rangle \\simeq 23\\,000\\,$K) and exhibit much more scatter compared to those\nbelow the gap ($\\langle T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\rangle \\simeq 15\\,000\\,$K). While\nthis behaviour broadly agrees with theoretical predictions, some discrepancies\nare present: (i) all our new measurements above the gap are characterised by\nlower temperatures ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\simeq 16\\,000 - 26\\,000\\,$K) than\npredicted by the present day CV population models ($T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\simeq\n38\\,000 - 43\\,000\\,$K); (ii) our results below the gap are not clustered in the\npredicted narrow track and exhibit in particular a relatively large spread near\nthe period minimum, which may point to some shortcomings in the CV evolutionary\nmodels. Finally, in the standard model of CV evolution, reaching the minimum\nperiod, CVs are expected to evolve back towards longer periods with mean\naccretion rates $\\dot{M}\\lesssim 2 \\times\n10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to\n$T_\\mathrm{eff}\\lesssim 11\\,500\\,$K. We do not unambiguously identify any such\nsystem in our survey, suggesting that this major component of the predicted CV\npopulation still remains elusive to observations.\n", "  The magnetic reconnection process is analyzed for relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamical plasmas around rotating black holes. A simple\ngeneralization of the Sweet-Parker model is used as a first approximation to\nthe problem. The reconnection rate, as well as other important properties of\nthe reconnection layer, have been calculated taking into account the effect of\nspacetime curvature. Azimuthal and radial current sheet configurations in the\nequatorial plane of the black hole have been studied, and the case of small\nblack hole rotation rate has been analyzed. For the azimuthal configuration, it\nis found that the black hole rotation decreases the reconnection rate. On the\nother hand, in the radial configuration, it is the gravitational force created\nby the black hole mass that decreases the reconnection rate. These results\nestablish a fundamental interaction between gravity and magnetic reconnection\nin astrophysical contexts.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the study of the statistical mechanics of trapped\ngravitons obtained by 'trapping' a spherical gravitational wave in a box. As a\nconsequence, a discrete spectrum dependent on the Legendre index $\\ell$ similar\nto the harmonic oscillator one is obtained and a statistical study is\nperformed. The mean energy $<E>$ results as a sum of two discrete Planck\ndistributions with different dependent frequencies. As an important\napplication, we derive the semiclassical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for\na static Schwarzschild black hole by only requiring that the black hole\ninternal energy $U$ is provided by its ADM rest energy, without invoking\nparticular quantum gravity theories. This seriously suggests that the interior\nof a black hole can be composed of trapped gravitons at a thermodynamical\ntemperature proportional by a factor $\\simeq 2$ to the horizon temperature\n$T_h$.\n", "  This Workshop brought top experts, researchers, postdocs, and students from\nhigh-energy heavy ion interactions, lattice QCD and hadronic physics\ncommunities together. YSTAR2016 discussed the impact of \"missing\" hyperon\nresonances on QCD thermodynamics, on freeze-out in heavy ion collisions, on the\nevolution of early universe, and on the spectroscopy of strange particles.\nRecent studies that compared lattice QCD predictions of thermodynamic\nproperties of quark-gluon plasma at freeze-out with calculations based on\nstatistical hadron resonance gas models as well as experimentally measured\nratios between yields of different hadron species in heavy ion collisions\nprovide indirect evidence for the presence of \"missing\" resonances in all of\nthese contexts. The aim of the YSTAR2016 Workshop was to sharpen these\ncomparisons and advance our understanding of the formation of strange hadrons\nfrom quarks and gluons microseconds after the Big Bang and in todays\nexperiments at LHC and RHIC as well as at future facilities like FAIR, J-PARC\nand KL at JLab.\n  It was concluded that the new initiative to create a secondary beam of\nneutral kaons at JLab will make a bridge between the hardron spectroscopy,\nheavy-ion experiments and lattice QCD studies addressing some major issues\nrelated to thermodynamics of the early universe and cosmology in general.\n", "  In this work, the quantization of the Yang-Mills theory is worked out by\nmeans of Dirac's canonical quantization method, using the generalized Coulomb\ngauge fixing conditions. Following the construction of the matrix composed of\nall the second class constraints of the theory, its convenience within the\nframework of the canonical approach is discussed. Although this method can be\nused successfully in the quantization of the Abelian theories, it brings along\ndifficulties for the non-Abelian case, which can not be handled easily even for\nthe generalized Coulomb gauge of the Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  We investigate the influence of random variations of the Galactic\ngravitational field on the apparent celestial positions of extragalactic\nsources. The basic statistical characteristics of a stochastic process\n(first-order moments, an autocorrelation function and a power spectral density)\nare used to describe a light ray deflection in a gravitational field of\nrandomly moving point masses as a function of the source coordinates. We map a\n2D distribution of the standard deviation of the angular shifts in positions of\ndistant sources (including reference sources of the International Celestial\nReference Frame) with respect to their true positions. For different Galactic\nmatter distributions the standard deviation of the offset angle can reach\nseveral tens of $\\mu as$ (microarcsecond) toward the Galactic center,\ndecreasing down to 4-6 $\\mu as$ at high galactic latitudes. The conditional\nstandard deviation (`jitter') of 2.5 $\\mu as$ is reached within 10 years at\nhigh galactic latitudes and within a few months toward the inner part of the\nGalaxy. The photometric microlensing events are not expected to be disturbed by\nastrometric random variations anywhere except the inner part of the Galaxy as\nthe Einstein--Chvolson times are typically much shorter than the jittering\ntimescale. While a jitter of a single reference source can be up to dozens of\n$\\mu as$ over some reasonable observational time, using a sample of reference\nsources would reduce the error in relative astrometry. The obtained results can\nbe used for estimating the physical upper limits on the time-dependent accuracy\nof astrometric measurements.\n", "  We present a weak lensing analysis of a sample of SDSS Compact Groups (CGs).\nUsing the measured radial density contrast profile, we derive the average\nmasses under the assumption of spherical symmetry, obtaining a velocity\ndispersion for the Singular Isothermal Spherical model, $\\sigma_V = 270 \\pm 40\n\\rm ~km~s^{-1}$, and for the NFW model, $R_{200}=0.53\\pm0.10\\,h_{70}^{-1}\\,\\rm\nMpc$. We test three different definitions of CGs centres to identify which best\ntraces the true dark matter halo centre, concluding that a luminosity weighted\ncentre is the most suitable choice. We also study the lensing signal dependence\non CGs physical radius, group surface brightness, and morphological mixing. We\nfind that groups with more concentrated galaxy members show steeper mass\nprofiles and larger velocity dispersions. We argue that both, a possible lower\nfraction of interloper and a true steeper profile, could be playing a role in\nthis effect. Straightforward velocity dispersion estimates from member\nspectroscopy yields $\\sigma_V \\approx 230 \\rm ~km~s^{-1}$ in agreement with our\nlensing results.\n", "  We simulate bulk materials under strong currents by following in real-time\nthe dynamics of the electrons under an electric field. By changing the\nintensity of the electric field, our method can model, for the first time,\nnon-linear effects in the conductivity from first principles. To illustrate our\napproach, we show calculations that predict that liquid aluminum exhibits\nnegative-differential conductivity for current densities of the order of\n$10^{12}-10^{13}~\\mathrm{A/cm^2}$. We find that the change in the non-linear\nconductivity emerges from a competition between the accumulation of charge\naround the nuclei that increases the scattering of the conduction electrons,\nand a decreasing scattering cross-section at high currents.\n", "  Motivated by recent developments in black hole thermodynamics, we investigate\nvan der Waals phase transitions of charged black holes in massive gravity. We\nfind that massive gravity theories can exhibit strikingly different\nthermodynamic behaviour compared to that of Einstein gravity, and that the mass\nof the graviton can generate a range of new phase transitions for topological\nblack holes that are otherwise forbidden.\n", "  Advances in astronomy are intimately linked to advances in digital signal\nprocessing (DSP). This special issue is focused upon advances in DSP within\nradio astronomy. The trend within that community is to use off-the-shelf\ndigital hardware where possible and leverage advances in high performance\ncomputing. In particular, graphics processing units (GPUs) and field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs) are being used in place of\napplication-specific circuits (ASICs); high-speed Ethernet and Infiniband are\nbeing used for interconnect in place of custom backplanes. Further, to lower\nhurdles in digital engineering, communities have designed and released\ngeneral-purpose FPGA-based DSP systems, such as the CASPER ROACH board, ASTRON\nUniboard and CSIRO Redback board. In this introductory article, we give a brief\nhistorical overview, a summary of recent trends, and provide an outlook on\nfuture directions.\n", "  Neutrinos coming from the Sun's core are now measured with a high precision,\nand fundamental neutrino oscillations parameters are determined with a good\naccuracy. In this work, we estimate the impact that a new neutrino physics\nmodel, the so-called generalized Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) oscillation\nmechanism, has on the shape of some of leading solar neutrino spectra, some of\nwhich will be partially tested by the next generation of solar neutrino\nexperiments. In these calculations, we use a high-precision standard solar\nmodel in good agreement with helioseismology data. We found that the neutrino\nspectra of the different solar nuclear reactions of the proton-proton chains\nand carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle have quite distinct sensitivities to the new\nneutrino physics. The $HeP$ and $^8B$ neutrino spectra are the ones for which\ntheir shapes are more affected when neutrinos interact with quarks in addition\nto electrons. The shape of the $^{15}O$ and $^{17}F$ neutrino spectra are also\nmodified, although in these cases the impact is much smaller. Finally, the\nimpact in the shape of the $PP$ and $^{13}N$ neutrino spectra is practically\nnegligible.\n", "  A theoretical model of electroosmosis through a circular pore of radius $a$\nthat traverses a membrane of thickness $h$ is investigated. Both the\ncylindrical surface of the pore and the outer surfaces of the membrane are\ncharged. When $h\\gg a$ end effects are negligible: results of full numerical\ncomputations of electroosmosis in an infinite pore agree with theory. When\n$h=0$, end effects dominate, and computations again agree with analysis. For\nintermediate values of $h/a$, an approximate analysis that combines these two\nlimiting cases captures the main features of computational results when the\nDebye length $\\kappa^{-1}$ is small compared with the pore radius $a$. However,\nthe approximate analysis fails when $\\kappa^{-1}\\gg a$, when the charge cloud\ndue to the charged cylindrical walls of the pore spills out of the ends of the\npore, and the electroosmotic flow is reduced. When this spilling out is\nincluded in the analysis, agreement with computation is restored.\n", "  Nonequilibrium work-Hamiltonian connection for a microstate plays a central\nrole in diverse branches of statistical thermodynamics (fluctuation theorems,\nquantum thermodynamics, stochastic thermodynamics, etc.). We show that the\nchange in the Hamiltonian for a microstate should be identified with the work\ndone by it, and not the work done on it. This contradicts the current practice\nin the field. The difference represents a contribution whose average gives the\nwork that is dissipated due to irreversibility. As the latter has been\noverlooked, the current identification does not properly account for\nirreversibilty. As an example, we show that the corrected version of\nJarzynski's relation can be applied to free expansion, where the original\nrelation fails. Thus, the correction has far-reaching consequences and requires\nreassessment of current applications.\n", "  We theoretically study a current switch that exploits the phase acquired by a\ncharge carrier as it tunnels through a potential barrier in graphene. The\nsystem acts as an interferometer based on an armchair graphene quantum ring,\nwhere the phase difference between interfering electronic wave functions for\neach path can be controlled by tuning either the height or the width of a\npotential barrier in the ring arms. By varying the parameters of the potential\nbarriers the interference can become completely destructive. We demonstrate how\nthis interference effect can be used for developing a simple graphene-based\nlogic gate with high on/off ratio\n", "  We have carried out boundary-layer-resolved, unstructured fully-compressible\nNavier--Stokes simulations of an ultrasonic standing-wave thermoacoustic engine\n(TAE) model. The model is constructed as a quarter-wavelength engine,\napproximately 4 mm by 4 mm in size and operating at 25 kHz, and comprises a\nthermoacoustic stack and a coin-shaped cavity, a design inspired by Flitcroft\nand Symko (2013). Thermal and viscous boundary layers (order of 10\n$\\mathrm{\\mu}$m) are resolved. Vibrational and rotational molecular relaxation\nare modeled with an effective bulk viscosity coefficient modifying the viscous\nstress tensor. The effective bulk viscosity coefficient is estimated from the\ndifference between theoretical and semi-empirical attenuation curves.\nContributions to the effective bulk viscosity coefficient can be identified as\nfrom vibrational and rotational molecular relaxation. The inclusion of the\ncoefficient captures acoustic absorption from infrasonic ($\\sim$10 Hz) to\nultrasonic ($\\sim$100 kHz) frequencies. The value of bulk viscosity depends on\npressure, temperature, and frequency, as well as the relative humidity of the\nworking fluid. Simulations of the TAE are carried out to the limit cycle, with\ngrowth rates and limit-cycle amplitudes varying non-monotonically with the\nmagnitude of bulk viscosity, reaching a maximum for a relative humidity level\nof 5%. A corresponding linear model with minor losses was developed; the linear\nmodel overpredicts transient growth rate but gives an accurate estimate of\nlimit cycle behavior. An improved understanding of thermoacoustic energy\nconversion in the ultrasonic regime based on a high-fidelity computational\nframework will help to further improve the power density advantages of\nsmall-scale thermoacoustic engines.\n", "  The Multi-scalar field cosmology of the anisotropic Bianchi type I model is\nused in order to construct a family of potentials that are the best suited to\nmodel the inflation phenomenon. We employ the quantum potential approach to\nquantum mechanics due to Bohm in order to solve the corresponding\nWheeler-DeWitt equation; which in turn enables us to restrict sensibly the\naforementioned family of potentials. Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SUSYQM)\nis also employed in order to constrain the superpotential function, at the same\ntime the tools from SUSY Quantum Mechanics are used to test the family of\npotentials in order to infer which is the most convenient for the inflation\nepoch. For completeness solutions to the wave function of the universe are also\npresented.\n", "  We present the first attempt to extract the \"$x$\" dependence of the parton\ndistribution function (PDF) of the quark gluon plasma (QGP). In the absence of\nknowledge regarding the mass of a QGP constituent, we define the new variable\n$x_N$, the nucleonic momentum fraction, which represents the ratio of the\nmomentum of the parton to that of a self-contained section of the plasma that\nhas the mass of a nucleon. Calculations are compared to data for single hadron\nsuppression in terms of the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the\nazimuthal anisotropy parameter $v_{2}$, as a function of transverse momentum\n$p_{T}$, centrality and energy of the collision. It is demonstrated that the\nscale evolution of the QGP-PDF is responsible for the reduction in\nnormalization of the jet transport coefficient $\\hat{q}$, between fits to\nRelativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data; a\npuzzle, first discovered by the JET collaboration. Best fits to data are\nsuggestive of the presence of quasi-particles with wide dispersion relations in\nthe QGP.\n", "  Power system dynamic state estimation is essential to monitoring and\ncontrolling power system stability. Kalman filtering approaches are predominant\nin estimation of synchronous machine dynamic states (i.e. rotor angle and rotor\nspeed). This paper proposes an adaptive multi-step prediction (AMSP) approach\nto improve the extended Kalman filter s (EKF) performance in estimating the\ndynamic states of a synchronous machine. The proposed approach consists of\nthree major steps. First, two indexes are defined to quantify the non-linearity\nlevels of the state transition function and measurement function, respectively.\nSecond, based on the non-linearity indexes, a multi prediction factor (Mp) is\ndefined to determine the number of prediction steps. And finally, to mitigate\nthe non-linearity impact on dynamic state estimation (DSE) accuracy, the\nprediction step repeats a few time based on Mp before performing the correction\nstep. The two-area four-machine system is used to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed AMSP approach. It is shown through the Monte-Carlo method that a\ngood trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational time can be\nachieved effectively through the proposed AMSP approach.\n", "  It has been suggested that the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way reside in\na highly-flattened, kinematically-coherent plane called Disk of Satellites\n(DoS). The origin of the DoS, however, has been hotly debated, and a number of\nconflicting claims have been reported in the literature on whether or not the\nDoS is consistent with predictions from the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter\n($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model. Here we investigate this issue by comparing\na high-resolution, hydrodynamic $\\Lambda$CDM simulation of a Milky Way sized\ngalaxy with its dark matter only counterpart. We find the following results:\n(1) The abundance and distribution of satellite galaxies around a host galaxy\nis significantly different in the hydro simulation compared to its N-body\ncounterpart; (2) No clear coherent rotation is found in the satellite system,\nas the fractions of corotating and counter-corotating satellites remain\ncomparable across cosmic time; (3) The satellite distribution evolves\nsignificantly with time, from nearly isotropic at high redshift to anisotropic\nat the present day; (4) The DoS properties strongly depend on sample selection\nand plane identification methods. Our results imply that the spatially-thin and\ncoherently-rotating DoS reported in Milky Way and other galaxies may be a\nselection effect of small sample size.\n", "  Motivated by the spin-triplet superconductor Sr2RuO4, the thermal Hall\nconductivity is investigated for several pairing symmetries with broken\ntime-reversal symmetry. In the chiral p-wave phase with a fully opened\nquasiparticle excitation gap, the temperature dependence of the thermal Hall\nconductivity has a temperature linear term associated with the topological\nproperty directly, and an exponential term, which shows a drastic change around\nthe Lifshitz transition. Examining f-wave states as alternative candidates with\n$\\bm d=\\Delta_0\\hat{z}(k_x^2-k_y^2)(k_x\\pm ik_y)$ and $\\bm\nd=\\Delta_0\\hat{z}k_xk_y(k_x\\pm ik_y)$ with gapless quasiparticle excitations,\nwe study the temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity, where for\nthe former state the thermal Hall conductivity has a quadratic dependence on\ntemperature, originating from the linear dispersions, in addition to linear and\nexponential behavior. The obtained result may enable us to distinguish between\nthe chiral p-wave and f-wave states in Sr2RuO4.\n", "  Photon antibunching in the light scattered by single quantum emitters is one\nof the hallmarks of quantum optics, providing an unequivocal demonstration of\nthe quantized nature of the electromagnetic field. Antibunching can be\nintuitively understood by the need for a two-level system lying in its lower\nstate after emitting a photon to be re-excited into the upper one before a\nsecond emission can take place. Here we show that such a picture breaks down in\nthe ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime, when the coupling strength\nbecomes comparable to the bare emitter frequency. Specialising to the cases of\nboth a natural and a superconducting artificial atom, we thus show that a\nsingle emitter coupled to a photonic resonator can emit bunched light. The\nresult presented herein is a clear evidence of how the ultrastrong coupling\nregime is able to change the nature of individual atoms.\n", "  We present a reconstruction of jet geometry models using numerical methods\nbased on a Markov ChainMonte Carlo (MCMC) and limited memory\nBroyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimized algorithm. Our aim is to\nmodel the three-dimensional geometry of an AGN jet using observations, which\nare inherently two-dimensional. Many AGN jets display complex hotspots and\nbends over the kiloparsec scales. The structure of these bends in the jets\nframe may be quite different than what we see in the sky frame, transformed by\nour particular viewing geometry. The knowledge of the intrinsic structure will\nbe helpful in understanding the appearance of the magnetic field and hence\nemission and particle acceleration processes over the length of the jet. We\npresent the method used, as well as a case study based on a region of the M87\njet.\n", "  Frequent Measurements on an unstable particle located at observable initial\nstate freeze the particle on this state, known as quantum Zeno effect [1-14].\nMeasurements on an observable subspace further open the prelude of quantum Zeno\ndynamics [15-17]. These phenomena affect the results of quantum measurement\nthat has been widely used in quantum information and quantum computation\n[18-21]. However, this common argument is insufficient when the initial state\nis coupled with a continuum reservoir. In such an irreversible system,\nintrinsic decay property destroys the frozen behavior. Although it has been\nproven that the decay rate of the initial state will be affected by\nmeasurements [7], the knowledge of detailed mechanisms for this\nmeasurement-dependent decay is still limited. In this work, we found based on\nthree-subsystem perturbation theory that the indirect correlation between a\ncontinuum reservoir and a measurement apparatus through the interaction with a\nquantum system causes a Rabi-like inter-modulation among these subsystems. The\nindirect correlation effect from this combination drives the system into\nquantum Zeno and reactivation regions, which are dependent upon the Rabi\nstrength, pulse duty, and its repetition rate. We also found that the dynamical\nchanges of decay rate are quite different in continuous and pulsed\nmeasurements, and, thus, significantly affect the dynamics of the system.\n", "  Recently it is claimed that there is a significant systematic error from\nexcited state contributions in the nucleus correlation functions by comparing\nwith calculations using the exponential and wall source operators. However, the\nwall source result is obtained in much earlier time than the plateau region. In\norder to investigate the systematic error in the plateau region, we calculate\nthe correlation functions with both the operators in quenched QCD at 0.8 GeV\npion mass and in $N_f=2+1$ QCD at 0.7 GeV pion mass in high accuracy. In this\nreport we present preliminary results of those calculations, and show that the\nenergy shift obtained from the two sources agree with each other, if those are\ndetermined from a region, where both the nucleon and two-nucleon correlation\nfunctions have plateaus.\n", "  Methods to classify events experimentally according to collision geometry are\nwell established and non-controversial when collisions of large ions are\nstudied. However, high luminosity data from $p/d$+A collisions at RHIC and LHC\nprovided some surprising results that either call for new physics or question\nthe applicability of the established methods of event classification for them.\nSo far there is no consensus in the community what is the proper model and\nprocedure to determine centrality, how to connect observed event activity with\ncollision geometry in very asymmetric, $p/d$+A collisions in the same sense and\nwith the same accuracy as was done in A+A. We argue that high $p_T$ direct\nphotons offer an {\\it a posteriori} test of any method suggested to categorize\n$p/d$+A -- and in general, very asymmetric -- collisions: the method is only\nviable if the nuclear modification factor for high $p_T$ direct photons is\nabout unity for all centrality classes.\n", "  In this study, we confirm the universality of density of microscopic states\nin non-interacting system; this means statistical interdependence is vanished\nin any lattices. This enable one to obtain information of configuration of\nsolute atoms, free energy, phase diagram with performing first-principles\ncalculation on few special microscopic states combined with our established\ntheory.\n", "  Silicate hybrid materials were prepared by the sol-gel process with the\naddition of x wt% of zirconium propoxide (x = 0 and 1). The thermal behavior as\nwell as the influence of Zr addition was studied by thermal gravimetric\nanalysis and differential thermal analysis. The microstructure evolution with\ntemperature was investigated by X-ray diffraction and small angle neutron\nscattering. It was found that the beginning of polymer degradation occurs at a\nhigher temperature in the material prepared with addition of Zr than in the one\nprepared without. At the nanometric scale, the materials prepared without Zr\nshow smooth interfaces, whereas those with Zr present a mass fractal structure.\nThis structure is also observed in the material without Zr after thermal\ntreatment at 200 C. The results showed that bioactivity is favored by mass\nfractal structures in comparison with one consisting of smooth surfaces.\n", "  Drying of colloidal droplets on solid, rigid substrates is associated with a\ncapillary pressure developing within the droplet. In due course of time, the\ncapillary pressure builds up due to droplet evaporation resulting in the\nformation of a colloidal thin film that is prone to crack formation. In this\nstudy, we show that introducing a minimal amount of nematic liquid crystal\n(NLC) can completely suppress the crack formation. The mechanism behind the\ncurbing of the crack formation may be attributed to the capillary\nstress-absorbing cushion provided by the elastic arrangements of the liquid\ncrystal at the substrate-droplet interface. Cracks and allied surface\ninstabilities are detrimental to the quality of the final product like surface\ncoatings, and therefore, its suppression by an external inert additive is a\npromising technique that will be of immense importance for several industrial\napplications. We believe this fundamental investigation of crack suppression\nwill open up an entire avenue of applications for the NLCs in the field of\ncoatings, broadening its already existing wide range of benefits.\n", "  In this review article, we discuss the synthesis, properties, and novel\ndevice applications of low-symmetry 2D materials, including black phosphorus\nand its arsenic alloys, compounds with black-phosphorus like structure such as\nthe monochalcogenides of group IV elements like Ge and Sn, as well as the class\nof low-symmetry transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials such as\nrhenium disulfide (ReS2) and rhenium diselenide (ReSe2). Their unique physical\nproperties resulting from the low symmetry in-plane crystal structure and the\nprospects of their application in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics, as well as\npiezoelectric devices and thermoelectrics are discussed.\n", "  We report on the Fermi-LAT detection of high-energy emission from the\nbehind-the-limb (BTL) solar flares that occurred on 2013 October 11, and 2014\nJanuary 6 and September 1. The Fermi-LAT observations are associated with\nflares from active regions originating behind both the eastern and western\nlimbs, as determined by STEREO. All three flares are associated with very fast\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs) and strong solar energetic particle events. We\npresent updated localizations of the >100 MeV photon emission, hard X-ray\n(HXR)and EUV images, and broadband spectra from 10 keV to 10 GeV, as well as\nmicrowave spectra. We also provide a comparison of the BTL flares detected by\nFermi-LAT with three on-disk flares and present a study of some of the\nsignificant quantities of these flares as an attempt to better understand the\nacceleration mechanisms at work during these occulted flares. We interpret the\nHXR emission to be due to electron bremsstrahlung from a coronal thin-target\nloop top with the accelerated electron spectra steepening at semirelativistic\nenergies. The >100 MeV gamma-rays are best described by a pion-decay model\nresulting from the interaction of protons (and other ions) in a thick-target\nphotospheric source. The protons are believed to have been accelerated (to\nenergies >10 GeV) in the CME environment and precipitate down to the\nphotosphere from the downstream side of the CME shock and landed on the front\nside of the Sun, away from the original flare site and the HXR emission.\n", "  We propose and throughly investigate a temporalized version of the popular\nMassey's technique for rating actors in sport competitions. The method can be\ndescribed as a dynamic temporal process in which team ratings are updated at\nevery match according to their performance during the match and the strength of\nthe opponent team. Using the Italian soccer dataset, we empirically show that\nthe method has a good foresight prediction accuracy.\n", "  Many migratory animals regularly travel thousands of kilometers, exactly\nfinding their destinations. It is assumed that migrants have both a compass\nsense to hold their course, and a map sense --- a kind of \"biological\" GPS ---\nto correct accumulated errors and determine right direction during navigation.\nUnlike the compass sense, the map sense is still not reliably explained.\nTherefore, an alternative way is discussed in literature to eliminate the\nerrors --- the aggregation of animals in groups and their coordinated movement.\nOrientation accuracy of a group may be significantly higher because the errors\ncaused by the action of a variety of casual factors are averaged. This idea,\ncalled the \"many wrongs principle,\" has been confirmed both in behavioral\nexperiments and in the results of computer simulations. However, until now\nthere was no analytical model that considered this effect and its limitations.\nSuch a model is presented in this article. The model is given in terms of the\ncourse deviation angle and its variance. It includes a few parameters:\nindividual sensitivity of the animal compass, the power of the herd instinct,\nand the level of random noise. These parameters determine, among other factors,\nthe size of the group that is optimal for precise navigation. It is shown that\nthere is a range of the noise level, at which the aggregation of individuals\ninto groups that do not exceed a certain size would be favorable.\n", "  A novel type of approximants is introduced, being based on the ideas of\nself-similar approximation theory. The method is illustrated by the examples\npossessing the structure typical of many problems in applied mathematics. Good\nnumerical convergence is demonstrated for the cases that can be compared with\nexact solutions, when these are available. The method is shown to be not less\nand as a rule essentially more accurate than that of Pade approximants.\nComparison with other approximation methods is also given.\n", "  Drop-surface interaction is predominant in nature as well as in many\nindustrial applications. Freezing rain is the frequent origin of ice accretion\non surfaces. Superhydrophobic surfaces show potential for anti-icing\napplications as they exhibit complete drop rebounce. Nonetheless, drop shedding\nhas to take place before freezing for effective functioning. Recently,\nintroducing a macro-ridge to break the hydrodynamic symmetry, has been shown to\nreduce the residence time on the surface of a bouncing drop. However, for a\npractical application the surface must be decorated with a series of ridges so\nthat most of the drops actually encounter the ridges and lift-off rapidly. Here\nwe show that a parallel neighbor ridge can influence the dynamics of recoiling.\nRidge spacing plays a key role on the performance of surface to reduce the\nresidence time. This finding can be of great significance for the development\nof macro-ridged anti-icing surfaces.\n", "  We report on preliminary results for the triple-gluon and the quark-gluon\nvertex in Landau gauge. Our results are based on two-flavor and quenched\nlattice QCD calculations for different quark masses, lattice spacings and\nvolumes. We discuss the momentum dependence of some of the vertices's form\nfactors and the deviations from the tree-level form.\n", "  Many biological and cognitive systems do not operate deep into one or other\nregime of activity. Instead, they exploit critical surfaces poised at\ntransitions in their parameter space. The pervasiveness of criticality in\nnatural systems suggests that there may be general principles inducing this\nbehaviour. However, there is a lack of conceptual models explaining how\nembodied agents propel themselves towards these critical points. In this paper,\nwe present a learning model driving an embodied Boltzmann Machine towards\ncritical behaviour by maximizing the heat capacity of the network. We test and\ncorroborate the model implementing an embodied agent in the mountain car\nbenchmark, controlled by a Boltzmann Machine that adjust its weights according\nto the model. We find that the neural controller reaches a point of\ncriticality, which coincides with a transition point of the behaviour of the\nagent between two regimes of behaviour, maximizing the synergistic information\nbetween its sensors and the hidden and motor neurons. Finally, we discuss the\npotential of our learning model to study the contribution of criticality to the\nbehaviour of embodied living systems in scenarios not necessarily constrained\nby biological restrictions of the examples of criticality we find in nature.\n", "  Hexapole oriented 2-bromobutane is photodissociated and detected by a slice\nion imaging technique at 234 nm. The laser wavelength corresponds to the C Br\nbond breaking with emission of a Br atom fragment in two accessible fine\nstructure states: the ground state Br and the excited state Br*, both\nobservable separately by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI).\nOrientation is evaluated by time of flight measurements combined with slice ion\nimaging.\n", "  Viscoelasticity has been described since the time of Maxwell as an\ninterpolation of purely viscous and purely elastic response, but its\nmicroscopic atomic-level mechanism in solids has remained elusive. We studied\nthree model disordered solids: a random lattice, the bond-depleted fcc lattice,\nand the fcc lattice with vacancies. Within the harmonic approximation for\ncentral-force lattices, we applied sum-rules for viscoelastic response derived\non the basis of non-affine atomic motions. The latter motions are a direct\nresult of local structural disorder, and in particular, of the lack of\ninversion-symmetry in disordered lattices. By defining a suitable quantitative\nand general atomic-level measure of nonaffinity and inversion-symmetry, we show\nthat the viscoelastic responses of all three systems collapse onto a master\ncurve upon normalizing by the overall strength of inversion-symmetry breaking\nin each system. Close to the isostatic point for central-force lattices,\npower-law creep $G(t)\\sim t^{-1/2}$ emerges as a consequence of the interplay\nbetween soft vibrational modes and non-affine dynamics, and various analytical\nscalings, supported by numerical calculations, are predicted by the theory.\n", "  The SIDIS transverse spin asymmetries weighted with powers of $P_T$, the\nhadron transverse momentum in the $\\gamma N$ reference system,have been\nintroduced already twenty years ago and are considered quite interesting. While\nthe amplitudes of the modulations in the azimuthal distribution of the hadrons\nare the ratios of convolutions over transverse momenta of the\ntransverse--momentum dependent parton distributions and of the corresponding\nfragmentation functions, and can be evaluated analytically only making\nassumptions on the transverse--momentum dependence of these functions, the\nweighted asymmetries allow to solve the convolution integrals over\ntransverse--momenta without those assumptions. Using the high statistics data\ncollected in 2010 on transversely polarized proton target COMPASS has evaluated\nin x-bins the $P_T$ weighted Sivers asymmetry which is proportional to the\nproduct of the first transverse moment of the Sivers function and of the\nfragmentation function. The results are compared to the standard unweighted\nSivers asymmetry.\n", "  We applied $ab$ $initio$ phonon analysis to layered titanium-oxypnictides,\nNa$_2$Ti$_2Pn_2$O ($Pn$ = As, Sb), and found a clear contrast between the cases\nwith lighter/heavier pnictogen in comparisons with experiments. The result\ncompletely explains the experimental structure, $C$2/$m$ for $Pn$ = As, within\nthe conventional electron-phonon framework, while there arise discrepancies\nwhen the pnictogen gets heavier, being in the same trend for the BaTi$_2Pn_2$O\n($Pn$ = As, Sb, Bi) case. The fact implies a systematic dependence on pnictogen\nto tune the mechanism of the phase transition and superconductivity from\nconventional to exotic.\n", "  Yes, but only for a parameter value that makes it almost coincide with the\nstandard model. We reconsider the cosmological dynamics of a generalized\nChaplygin gas (gCg) which is split into a cold dark matter (CDM) part and a\ndark energy (DE) component with constant equation of state. This model, which\nimplies a specific interaction between CDM and DE, has a $\\Lambda$CDM limit and\nprovides the basis for studying deviations from the latter. Including matter\nand radiation, we use the (modified) CLASS code \\cite{class} to construct the\nCMB and matter power spectra in order to search for a gCg-based concordance\nmodel that is in agreement with the SNIa data from the JLA sample and with\nrecent Planck data. The results reveal that the gCg parameter $\\alpha$ is\nrestricted to $|\\alpha|\\lesssim 0.05$, i.e., to values very close to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM limit $\\alpha =0$. This excludes, in particular, models in which\nDE decays linearly with the Hubble rate.\n", "  The Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer aboard the Huygens probe successfully\nacquired images and spectra of the surface of Titan. To counter the effects of\nhaze and atmospheric methane absorption it carried a Surface Science Lamp to\nilluminate the surface just before landing. We reconstruct the reflectance\nspectrum of the landing site in the 500-1500 nm range from Downward Looking\nVisual and Infrared Spectrometer data that show evidence of lamp light. Our\nreconstruction is a followup to the analysis by Tomasko et al. (2005), who\nscaled their result to the ratio of the up- and down flux measured just before\nlanding. Instead, we use the lamp flux from the calibration experiment, and\nfind a significantly higher overall reflectance. We attribute this to a phase\nangle dependance, possibly representing the opposition surge commonly\nencountered on solar system bodies. The reconstruction in the visible\nwavelength range is greatly improved. Here, the reflectance spectrum features a\nred slope, consistent with the presence of organic material. We confirm the\nblue slope in the near-IR, featureless apart from a single shallow absorption\nfeature at 1500 nm. We agree with Tomasko et al. that the evidence for water\nice is inconclusive. By modeling of absorption bands we find a methane mixing\nratio of 4.5% +/- 0.5% just above the surface. There is no evidence for the\npresence of liquid methane, but the data do not rule out a wet soil at a depth\nof several centimeters.\n", "  A simple theoretical approach is used to investigate active colloids at the\nfree interface and near repulsive substrates. We employ dynamical density\nfunctional theory to determine the steady-state density profiles in an\neffective equilibrium system [Farage et al., Phys. Rev. E, 91 (2015) 042310].\nIn addition to the known accumulation at surfaces, we predict wetting and\ndrying transitions at a flat repulsive wall and capillary condensation and\nevaporation in a slit pore. These new phenomena are closely related to the\nmotility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in the bulk.\n", "  A facile route for the fabrication of surface-attached hydrogel thin films\nwith well-controlled chemistry and tailored architecture on wide range of\nthickness from nanometers to micrometers is reported. The synthesis, which\nconsists in cross-linking and grafting the preformed and ene-reactive polymer\nchains through thiol--ene click chemistry, has the main advantage of being\nwell-controlled without the addition of initiators. As thiol--ene click\nreaction can be selectively activated by UV-irradiation (in addition to thermal\nheating), micropatterned hydrogel films are easily synthesized. The versatility\nof our approach is illustrated by the possibility to fabricate various chemical\npolymer networks, like stimuli-responsive hydrogels, on various solid\nsubstrates, such as silicon wafers, glass, and gold surfaces. Another\nattractive feature is the development of new complex hydrogel films with\ntargeted architecture. The fabrication of various architectures for polymer\nfilms is demonstrated: multilayer hydrogel films in which single-networks are\nstacked one onto the other, interpenetrating networks films with mixture of two\nnetworks in the same layer, and nanocomposite hydrogel films where\nnanoparticles are stably trapped inside the mesh of the network. Thanks to its\nsimplicity and its versatility this novel approach to surface-attached hydrogel\nfilms should have a strong impact in the area of polymer coatings\n", "  We propose a simple formula for multichannel resonant scattering with\nparameters related to physical resonant properties. It can be used to predict\nresidue phase from other resonant parameters and describe the shape of\nscattering amplitudes close to the resonance without any background\ncontributions or fitting. It works well even for overlapping resonances.\nImposing unitarity to the proposed formula enabled us to explain some puzzling\nfeatures of much more advanced models.\n", "  While landing on Titan, several instruments onboard Huygens acquired\nmeasurements that indicate the probe did not immediately come to rest. Detailed\nknowledge of the probe's motion can provide insight into the nature of Titan's\nsurface. Combining accelerometer data from the Huygens Atmospheric Structure\nInstrument (HASI) and the Surface Science Package (SSP) with photometry data\nfrom the Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR) we develop a quantitative\nmodel to describe motion of the probe, and its interaction with the surface.\nThe most likely scenario is the following. Upon impact, Huygens created a 12 cm\ndeep hole in the surface of Titan. It bounced back, out of the hole onto the\nflat surface, after which it commenced a 30-40 cm long slide in the southward\ndirection. The slide ended with the probe out of balance, tilted in the\ndirection of DISR by around 10 degrees. The probe then wobbled back and forth\nfive times in the north-south direction, during which it probably encountered a\n1-2 cm sized pebble. The SSP provides evidence for movement up to 10 s after\nimpact. This scenario puts the following constraints on the physical properties\nof the surface. For the slide over the surface we determine a friction\ncoefficient of 0.4. While this value is not necessarily representative for the\nsurface itself due to the presence of protruding structures on the bottom of\nthe probe, the dynamics appear to be consistent with a surface consistency of\ndamp sand. Additionally, we find that spectral changes observed in the first\nfour seconds after landing are consistent with a transient dust cloud, created\nby the impact of the turbulent wake behind the probe on the surface. The\noptical properties of the dust particles are consistent with those of Titan\naerosols from Tomasko et al. (P&SS 56, 669). We suggest that the surface at the\nlanding site was covered by a dust layer, possibly the 7 mm layer of...\n", "  This is a transcript of my conference talk in remembrance of Peter Hasenfratz\nwho deceased earlier in 2016. One of Peter's many important contributions to\nthe lattice community has been the initiation of the first lattice conference\nat CERN in 1982. From among his many important ideas, which Peter contributed\nto our field, I choose to discuss three in some detail and show how they are\ninfluencing the subject today.\n", "  All-dielectric nanophotonics is an exciting and rapidly developing area of\nnanooptics which utilizes the resonant behavior of high-index low-loss\ndielectric nanoparticles for enhancing light-matter interaction on the\nnanoscale. When experimental implementation of a specific all-dielectric\nnanostructure is an issue, two crucial factors have to be in focus: the choice\nof a high-index material and a fabrication method. The degree to which various\neffects can be enhanced relies on the dielectric response of the chosen\nmaterial as well as the fabrication accuracy. Here, we make an overview of\navailable high-index materials and existing fabrication techniques for the\nrealization of all-dielectric nanostructures. We compare performance of the\nchosen materials in the visible and IR spectral ranges in terms of scattering\nefficiencies and Q-factors. Various fabrication methods of all-dielectric\nnanostructures are further discussed, and their advantages and disadvantages\nare highlighted. We also present an outlook for the search of better materials\nwith higher refractive indices and novel fabrication methods enabling low-cost\nmanufacturing of optically resonant high-index nanoparticles. We hope that our\nresults will be valuable for researches across the whole field of nanophotonics\nand particularly for the design of all-dielectric nanostructures.\n", "  In the framework of the earlier derived dispersion equation, we study induced\nSmith Purcell (SP) radiation of relativistic electron beam in the absence of a\nresonator. We offer a new method for calculation of coefficients for partial\namplitudes in the case of rectangular grating. Using this method we calculate\nthe growth rate of the SPFEL with a rectangular grating. The growth rate\ndependences on harmonic number, beam current, observation angle and\nrelativistic factor are presented.\n", "  In the present paper we propose the use of desnity matrix formalism for the\ncalculation of the atomic spectroscopic properties of autoionizing states in\ndense plasmas, i.e. warm dense matter and strongly coupled plasmas. This is\nmotivated by the importance of taking into account the effect of the electric\nmicrofield generated by the plasma charge constituents in the calculation of\nthe atomic populations of autoionizing states. For autoionizing states,\nelectron densities justifying the statistical approach exceed solid density\nbringing serious doubts to the statistical approach even in dense plasmas. This\nleads also to the change of the spectral line shapes in the frame of the\nstandard methods. We discuss the importance of the present analysis in view of\nthe radiation emission originating from dense plasmas created by the\ninteraction of the X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL) with solid density matter.\n", "  Molecular orientation is a fundamental requisite in the study of\nstereodirected dynamics of collisional and photoinitiated processes. In this\nlast decade, variable hexapolar electric filters have been developed and\nemployed for the rotational-state selection and the alignment of molecules of\nincreasing complexity, for which main difficulties are their mass, their low\nsymmetry and the very dense rotational manifold. In this work, for the first\ntime, a complex molecule such as 2-bromobutane, an asymmetric-top containing a\nheavy atom (the bromine), has been successfully oriented by a weak homogeneous\nfield placed downstream the hexapolar filter. Efficiency of the orientation has\nbeen characterized experimentally, by combining time-of-flight measurements and\na slice-ion-imaging detection technique. The application is described to the\nphotodissociation dynamics of the oriented 2-bromobutane, which was carried out\nat a laser wavelength of 234 nm, corresponding to the breaking of the C Br\nbond. The Br photofragment is produced in both the ground Br (2P3/2) and the\nexcited Br (2P1/2) electronic states and both channels are studied by the slice\nimaging technique, revealing new features in the velocity and angular\ndistributions with respect to previous investigations on non-oriented\nmolecules.\n", "  In this paper, we find a reasonable explanation of high temperature\nsuperconductivity phenomena using Anyon statistics.\n", "  Drawing from our earlier works on the notion of causality for nonlocal\nphenomena, we propose and study the extension of the Sorkin--Woolgar relation\n$K^+$ onto the space of Borel probability measures on a given spacetime. We\nshow that it retains its fundamental properties of transitivity and closedness.\nFurthermore, we list and prove several characterizations of this relation,\nincluding the `nonlocal' analogue of the characterization of $K^+$ in terms of\ntime functions. This generalizes and casts new light on our earlier results\nconcerning the causal precedence relation $J^+$ between measures.\n", "  Precise thermal expansion and magnetostriction studies of the intermetallic\ncompound Eu$_2$CuSi$_3$ in the temperature range between 5 and 300 K are\npresented. A clear sign of magnetic second order phase transition at the\nferromagnetic Curie temperature $T_{\\rm C}$ = 34 K indicates strong\nmagneto-structural coupling. Uniaxial thermal expansion data show a large\nanisotropy between the magnetic easy $c$-axis and the hexagonal $ab$-plane,\nwhich is associated with a strongly anisotropic magnetic coupling. A\nspin-reorientation regime as well as a non-uniform energy scale are indicated\nby Gr\\\"uneisen analysis of the data at low temperatures. Anomalous\ncontributions to the thermal expansion imply ferromagnetic correlations far\nabove in zero magnetic field. The magnetic phase diagram is constructed,\nshowing the evolution of short- and long-range magnetic order in magnetic\nfields up to 15 T. The anisotropic magnetic field effect yields anomalous\nmagnetostrictive effects up to about 200 K.\n", "  Two-dimensional materials have significant potential for the development of\nnew devices. Here we report the electronic and structural properties of\n$\\beta$-GeSe, a previously unreported polymorph of GeSe, with a unique crystal\nstructure that displays strong two-dimensional structural features.\n$\\beta$-GeSe is made at high pressure and temperature and is stable under\nambient conditions. We compare it to its structural and electronic relatives\n$\\alpha$-GeSe and black phosphorus. The $\\beta$ form of GeSe displays a boat\nconformation for its Ge-Se six-ring, while the previously known $\\alpha$ form,\nand black phosphorus, display the more common chair conformation for their\nsix-rings. Electronic structure calculations indicate that $\\beta$-GeSe is a\nsemiconductor, with an approximate bulk band gap of $\\Delta~\\approx$ 0.5 eV,\nand, in its monolayer form, $\\Delta~\\approx$ 0.9 eV. These values fall between\nthose of $\\alpha$-GeSe and black phosphorus, making $\\beta$-GeSe a promising\ncandidate for future applications. The resistivity of our $\\beta$-GeSe crystals\nmeasured in-plane is on the order of $\\rho \\approx$ 1 $\\Omega$cm, while being\nessentially temperature independent.\n", "  The point-contact spectra of tetragonal $\\rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\\delta}$ with\n$T_c=50-60~K$ are studied at various temperatures. The single-electron energy\n($2\\Delta_0/kT_c\\simeq 17$) and its temperature dependence are determined. The\ncharacteristic energies of quasiparticle excitations interacting with\nconduction electrons in this high-$T_c$. superconductor are found to correlate\nwith the characteristic phonon energies. The possibility of a pair gap, which\nincreases with temperature, is revealed near the critical temperature.\n", "  The wealth of high-energy (E > 50 MeV) and very-high-energy (E > 100 GeV)\ndata accumulated over the past few years have provided unprecedented\nopportunities to probe pulsar emission models. The Fermi Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) has now detected over 200 gamma-ray pulsars of vastly different ages,\nproviding an extensive dataset of spectra and light curves compared to a mere\ndecade ago. Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes deepened our appreciation of the\nmysterious richness of the pulsar mechanism by a surprise detection of pulsed\nemission up to 1 TeV from the Crab pulsar. These discoveries position us to\nmake real progress in pulsar theory. A number of studies have developed new and\nenhanced existing dissipative magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and particle-in-cell\n(PIC) codes to solve the global electrodynamics and pursue fundamental\nquestions about magnetospheric particle injection, acceleration, and radiation.\nWhile MHD models capture the global aspects of pulsar magnetospheres, the\nmicrophysics need to be probed self-consistently by PIC simulations. Some\ndissipative MHD models consider the current sheet (CS) as an important site for\nhigh-energy curvature radiation (CR), while early PIC results point to energy\ndissipation taking place in the CS, where particles are accelerated by magnetic\nreconnection and may possibly emit $\\gamma$ rays via synchrotron radiation\n(SR). This is in marked contrast to some older local emission models that\nstudied CR gamma rays produced in gaps nearer to the spinning neutron star. The\nuniversality of these results should become clearer as current computational\nrestrictions are overcome and boundary conditions are refined. Continued and\ncombined polarimetric, spectral, and temporal measurements should aid us in\nscrutinising these new emission models in our persistent pursuit of a deeper\nunderstanding of the pulsar marvel.\n", "  Unlike the conventional first-order network (FoN), the higher-order network\n(HoN) provides a more accurate description of transitions by creating\nadditional nodes to encode higher-order dependencies. However, there exists no\nvisualization and exploration tool for the HoN. For applications such as the\ndevelopment of strategies to control species invasion through global shipping\nwhich is known to exhibit higher-order dependencies, the existing FoN\nvisualization tools are limited. In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel\nvisual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the\nglobal ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple\nviews to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i.e., the\nglobal, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of\ninterest at the global level and specify a port to investigate its higher-order\nnodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is\nenabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global\nocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nwith a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species\ninvasion. Finally, we discuss the generalizability of this framework to other\nreal-world applications such as information diffusion in social networks and\nepidemic spreading through air transportation.\n", "  The presently accepted value of the energy splitting of the Th-229\nground-state doublet has been obtained on the basis of undirect gamma\nspectroscopy measurements by Beck et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 142501 (2007).\nSince then, a number of experiments set out to measure the isomer energy\ndirectly, however none of them resulted in an observation of the transition.\nHere we perform an analysis to identify the parameter space of isomer energy\nand branching ratio that is consistent with the Beck et al. experiment.\n", "  Motivated by some models arising in quantum plasma dynamics, in this paper we\nstudy the Maxwell-Schr\\\"odinger system with a power-type nonlinearity. We show\nthe local well-posedness in $H^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)\\times H^{3/2}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ and\nthe global existence of finite energy weak solutions, these results are then\napplied to the analysis of finite energy weak solutions for Quantum\nMagnetohydrodynamic systems.\n", "  Holant problems are a framework for the analysis of counting complexity\nproblems on graphs. This framework is simultaneously general enough to\nencompass many other counting problems on graphs and specific enough to allow\nthe derivation of dichotomy results, partitioning all problem instances into\nthose which can be solved in polynomial time and those which are #P-hard. The\nHolant framework is based on the theory of holographic algorithms, which was\noriginally inspired by concepts from quantum computation, but this connection\nappears not to have been explored before.\n  Here, we employ quantum information theory to explain existing results in a\nconcise way and to derive a dichotomy for a new family of problems, which we\ncall Holant$^+$. This family sits in between the known families of Holant$^*$,\nfor which a full dichotomy is known, and Holant$^c$, for which only a\nrestricted dichotomy is known. Using knowledge from entanglement theory -- both\npreviously existing work and new results of our own -- we prove a full\ndichotomy theorem for Holant$^+$, which is very similar to the restricted\nHolant$^c$ dichotomy. Other than the dichotomy for #R$_3$-CSP, ours is the\nfirst Holant dichotomy in which the allowed functions are not restricted and in\nwhich only a finite number of functions are assumed to be freely available.\n", "  We investigate scaling properties of human brain functional networks in the\nresting-state. Analyzing network degree distributions, we statistically test\nwhether their tails scale as power-law or not. Initial studies, based on\nleast-squares fitting, were shown to be inadequate for precise estimation of\npower-law distributions. Subsequently, methods based on maximum-likelihood\nestimators have been proposed and applied to address this question.\nNevertheless, no clear consensus has emerged, mainly because results have shown\nsubstantial variability depending on the data-set used or its resolution. In\nthis study, we work with high-resolution data (10K nodes) from the Human\nConnectome Project and take into account network weights. We test for the\npower-law, exponential, log-normal and generalized Pareto distributions. Our\nresults show that the statistics generally do not support a power-law, but\ninstead these degree distributions tend towards the thin-tail limit of the\ngeneralized Pareto model. This may have implications for the number of hubs in\nhuman brain functional networks.\n", "  We study nonlinear resonance of coupled modes in nano-mechanical systems. To\nreveal the qualitative features of the dynamics, we consider the limiting\ncases, where the results can be obtained analytically. For 1:3 resonance, we\nfind the anomalously strong and nonmonotonic dependence of the decay rate of\nthe low frequency mode on its amplitude, if the decay rate of the\nhigh-frequency mode is comparatively large. In this case the low-frequency mode\ndriven close to resonance can have several branches of steady-state vibrations\nwith constant amplitude. If the decay rates of the both modes are small\ncompared to their coupling and internal nonlinearity, the dynamics corresponds\nto slowly decaying strongly nonsinusoidal oscillations of the vibration\namplitude. Weak driving can make these vibrations stable.\n", "  MHD waves permeate the solar atmosphere and constitute potential coronal\nheating agents. Yet, the waves detected so far may be but a small subset of the\ntrue existing wave power. Detection is limited by instrumental constraints, but\nalso by wave processes that localise the wave power in undetectable spatial\nscales. In this study we conduct 3D MHD simulations and forward modelling of\nstanding transverse MHD waves in coronal loops with uniform and non-uniform\ntemperature variation in the perpendicular cross-section. The observed\nsignatures are largely dominated by the combination of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI), resonant absorption and phase mixing. In the presence of a\ncross-loop temperature gradient we find that emission lines sensitive to the\nloop core catch different signatures than those more sensitive to the loop\nboundary and the surrounding corona, leading to an out-of-phase intensity\nmodulation produced by the KHI mixing. Common signatures to all considered\nmodels include an intensity and loop width modulation at half the kink period,\nfine strand-like structure, a characteristic arrow-shaped structure in the\nDoppler maps, overall line broadening in time but particularly at the loop\nedges. For our model, most of these features can be captured with a spatial\nresolution of $0.33\\arcsec$ and spectral resolution of 25~km~s$^{-1}$, although\nsevere over-estimation of the line width is obtained. Resonant absorption leads\nto a significant decrease of the observed kinetic energy from Doppler motions\nover time, which is not recovered by a corresponding increase in the line width\nfrom phase mixing and the KHI motions. We estimate this hidden wave energy to\nbe a factor of $5-10$ of the observed value.\n"]}
