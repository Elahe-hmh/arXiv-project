We yield evidence for the existence of these processes\nby recovering from them the standard Brownian motion we started with after\npower elevation. The perfect coincidence of the numerical results we obtained\nis a clear evidence of existence of these processes. This could pave the way to\na generalization of the concepts of stochastic integral and relative process.\n", "  Purpose: Repeated brain MRI scans are performed in many clinical scenarios,\nsuch as follow up of patients with tumors and therapy response assessment. In\nthis paper, the authors show an approach to utilize former scans of the patient\nfor the acceleration of repeated MRI scans.\n  Methods: The proposed approach utilizes the possible similarity of the\nrepeated scans in longitudinal MRI studies. Since similarity is not guaranteed,\nsampling and reconstruction are adjusted during acquisition to match the actual\nsimilarity between the scans. The baseline MR scan is utilized both in the\nsampling stage, via adaptive sampling, and in the reconstruction stage, with\nweighted reconstruction. In adaptive sampling, k-space sampling locations are\noptimized during acquisition. Weighted reconstruction uses the locations of the\nnonzero coefficients in the sparse domains as a prior in the recovery process.\nThe approach was tested on 2D and 3D MRI scans of patients with brain tumors.\n  Results: The longitudinal adaptive CS MRI (LACS-MRI) scheme provides\nreconstruction quality which outperforms other CS-based approaches for rapid\nMRI. Examples are shown on patients with brain tumors and demonstrate improved\nspatial resolution. Compared with data sampled at Nyquist rate, LACS-MRI\nexhibits Signal-to-Error Ratio (SER) of 24.8dB with undersampling factor of\n16.6 in 3D MRI.\n  Conclusions: The authors have presented a novel method for image\nreconstruction utilizing similarity of scans in longitudinal MRI studies, where\npossible. The proposed approach can play a major part and significantly reduce\nscanning time in many applications that consist of disease follow-up and\nmonitoring of longitudinal changes in brain MRI.\n", "  We propose and analyze a mesoscopic Josephson junction consisting of two\nferromagnetic insulator-superconductors (FI-Ss) coupled through a normal metal\n(N) layer. The Josephson current of the junction is non-trivially affected by\nthe spin-splitting field induced by the FIs in the two superconductors. In\nparticular, it shows sizeable enhancement by increasing the amplitude of the\nexchange field ($h_{ex}$) and displays a switchable current-phase relation\nwhich depends on the relative orientation of $h_{ex}$ in the FIs. In a\nrealistic EuS/Al-based setup this junction can be exploited as a\nhigh-resolution threshold sensor for the magnetic field as well as an on-demand\ntunable kinetic inductor.\n", "  Purpose: In many clinical MRI scenarios, existing imaging information can be\nused to significantly shorten acquisition time or to improve Signal to Noise\nRatio (SNR). In this paper the authors present a framework for fast MRI by\nexploiting a reference image (FASTMER).\n  Methods: The proposed approach utilizes the possible similarity of the\nreference image that exists in many clinical MRI imaging scenarios. Such\nscenarios include similarity between adjacent slices in high resolution MRI,\nsimilarity between various contrasts in the same scan and similarity between\ndifferent scans of the same patient. The authors take into account that the\nreference image may exhibit low similarity with the acquired image and develop\nan iterative weighted approach for reconstruction, which tunes the weights\naccording to the degree of similarity.\n  Results: Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the method in\nthree different clinical MRI scenarios: SNR improvement in high resolution\nbrain MRI, exploiting similarity between T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated\ninversion recovery (FLAIR) for fast FLAIR scanning and utilizing similarity\nbetween baseline and follow-up scans for fast follow-up. Results outperform\nreconstruction results of existing state-of-the-art methods.\n  Conclusions: The authors present a method for fast MRI by exploiting a\nreference image. The method is based on an iterative reconstruction approach\nthat supports cases in which similarity to the reference scan is not\nguaranteed, which enables the applicability of the method to a variety of MRI\napplications. Thanks to the existence of reference images in various clinical\nimaging scenarios, the proposed framework can play a major part in improving\nreconstruction in many MR applications.\n", "  In recent years, there has been increasing attention to the spatial\ndimensions of residential segregation, such as the spatial arrangement of\nsegregated neighborhoods and the geographic scale or relative size of\nsegregated areas. However, the methods used to measure segregation do not\nincorporate features of the built environment, such as the road connectivity\nbetween locations or the physical barriers that divide groups. This article\nintroduces the Spatial Proximity and Connectivity (SPC) method for measuring\nand analyzing segregation. The SPC method addresses the limitations of current\napproaches by taking into account how the physical structure of the built\nenvironment affects the proximity and connectivity of locations. In this\narticle, I describe the method and its application for studying segregation and\nspatial inequality more broadly. I demonstrate one such application-analyzing\nthe impact of physical barriers on residential segregation-with a stylized\nexample and an empirical analysis of racial segregation in Pittsburgh, PA. The\nSPC method contributes to scholarship on residential segregation by capturing\nthe effect of an important yet understudied mechanism of segregation-the\nconnectivity, or physical barriers, between locations-on the level and spatial\npattern of segregation, and enables further consideration of the role of the\nbuilt environment in segregation processes.\n", "  We have synthesized 20 nm thick films of tetragonally strained interstitial\nFe-Co-B alloys epitaxially grown on Au55Cu45 buffer layer. The strained axis is\nperpendicular to the film plane and the corresponding lattice constant c is\nenlarged with respect to the in-plane lattice parameter a. By adding the\ninterstitial boron with different concentrations 0, 4, and 10 at.% we were able\nto stabilize the tetragonal strain in 20 nm Fe-Co films with different c/a\nratios of 1.013, 1.034 and 1.02, respectively. Using ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) we found that the orbital\nmagnetic moment increases with increasing the c/a ratio, pointing towards the\nenhancement of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at larger strain. Our results show\nthat careful doping of ferromagnetic films allows to control the SOC by\nstabilizing anisotropic strain states. These findings are applicable in\nmaterial design for spintronics applications. We also discuss the influence of\nB doping on the Fe-Co film microstructure, its magnetic properties and magnetic\nrelaxation.\n", "  We investigate decoherence of quantum superpositions induced by gravitational\ntime dilation and spontaneous emission between two atomic levels. It has been\nshown that gravitational time dilation can be an universal decoherence source.\nHere, we consider decoherence induced by gravitational time dilation only in\nthe situation of spontaneous emission. Then, we obtain that the coherence of\nparticle's position state depends on reference frame due to the time dilation\nchanging the distinguishability of emission photon from two positions of\nparticle. Changing the direction of light field can also result in the\ndifference about the coherence of quantum superpositions. For observing the\ndecoherence effect mainly due to gravitational time dilation, time-delayed\nfeedback can be utilized to increase the decoherence of particle's\nsuperpositions.\n", "  The minimal memory required to model a given stochastic process - known as\nthe statistical complexity - is a widely adopted quantifier of structure in\ncomplexity science. Here, we ask if quantum mechanics can fundamentally change\nthe qualitative behaviour of this measure. We study this question in the\ncontext of the classical Ising spin chain. In this system, the statistical\ncomplexity is known to grow monotonically with temperature. We evaluate the\nspin chain's quantum mechanical statistical complexity by explicitly\nconstructing its provably simplest quantum model, and demonstrate that this\nmeasure exhibits drastically different behaviour: it rises to a maximum at some\nfinite temperature then tends back towards zero for higher temperatures. This\ndemonstrates how complexity, as captured by the amount of memory required to\nmodel a process, can exhibit radically different behaviour when quantum\nprocessing is allowed.\n", "  We study semi-analytically the light emission and absorption properties of\narbitrary stratified photonic structures with embedded two-dimensional\nmagnetoelectric point scattering lattices, as used in recent plasmon-enhanced\nLEDs and solar cells. By employing dyadic Green's function for the layered\nstructure in combination with Ewald lattice summation to deal with the particle\nlattice, we develop an efficient method to study the coupling between planar 2D\nscattering lattices of plasmonic, or metamaterial point particles, coupled to\nlayered structures. Using the `array scanning method' we deal with localized\nsources. Firstly, we apply our method to light emission enhancement of dipole\nemitters in slab waveguides, mediated by plasmonic lattices. We benchmark the\narray scanning method against a reciprocity-based approach to find that the\ncalculated radiative rate enhancement in k-space below the light cone shows\nexcellent agreement. Secondly, we apply our method to study\nabsorption-enhancement in thin-film solar cells mediated by periodic Ag\nnanoparticle arrays. Lastly, we study the emission distribution in k-space of a\ncoupled waveguide-lattice system. In particular, we explore the dark mode\nexcitation on the plasmonic lattice using the so-called Array Scanning Method.\nOur method could be useful for simulating a broad range of complex nanophotonic\nstructures, i.e., metasurfaces, plasmon-enhanced light emitting systems and\nphotovoltaics.\n", "  We show that scattering amplitudes in magical, symmetric or homogeneous N=2\nMaxwell-Einstein supergravities can be obtained as double copies of two gauge\ntheories, using the framework of color/kinematics duality. The left-hand-copy\nis N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a hypermultiplet, whereas the\nright-hand-copy is a non-supersymmetric theory that can be identified as the\ndimensional reduction of a D-dimensional Yang-Mills theory coupled to P\nfermions. For generic D and P, the double copy gives homogeneous\nsupergravities. For P=1 and D=7,8,10,14, it gives the magical supergravities.\nWe compute explicit amplitudes, discuss their soft limit and study the\nUV-behavior at one loop.\n", "  We report on the results of ~7 yrs of the very-high energy (10-600 GeV)\nobservations of HESS J0632+057 with FERMI/LAT. In the highest energy band,\n200-600 GeV, the source is clearly detected with the statistical significance\n>3.6sigma at orbital phases 0.2-0.4 and 0.6-0.8 at which HESS J0632+057 is\nknown to demonstrate enhanced emission in TeV energy band. The analysis did not\nreveal the emission from HESS J0632+057 at lower energies and different orbital\nphases. Using the upper limits on source's flux we locate the break of the\nspectrum to >80 GeV and low-energy slope <2.0 (2sigma statistical\nsignificance).\n", "  The fabrication of nanostructures with controlled assembly and architecture\nis significant for the development of novel nanomaterials-based devices. In\nthis work we demonstrate that laser techniques coupled with low-temperature\nhydrothermal growth enable complex three-dimensional ZnO nanorods patterning on\nvarious types of substrates and geometries. The suggested methodology is based\non a procedure involving the 3D scaffold fabrication using Multi-Photon\nLithography of a photosensitive material, followed by Zn seeded Aqueous\nChemical Growth of ZnO nanorods. 3D, uniformly aligned ZnO nanorods are\nproduced, exhibiting electrical conductance and highly efficient photocatalytic\nperformance, providing a path to applications in a diverse field of\ntechnologies.\n", "  Based on a mathematical lemma related to the Vandermonde determinant and two\ntheorems derived from the first law of black hole thermodynamics, we\ninvestigate the angular momentum independence of the entropy sum as well as the\nentropy product of general rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes in higher\ndimensions. We show that for both non-charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes\nand non-charged rotating Kaluza-Klein-AdS black holes, the angular momentum of\nthe black holes will not be present in entropy sum relation in dimensions\n$d\\geq4$, while the independence of angular momentum of the entropy product\nholds provided that the black holes possess at least one zero rotation\nparameter $a_j$ = 0 in higher dimensions $d\\geq5$, which means that the\ncosmological constant does not affect the angular momentum-free property of\nentropy sum and entropy product under the circumstances that charge $\\delta=0$.\nFor the reason that the entropy relations of charged rotating Kaluza-Klein\nblack holes as well as the non-charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes in\nasymptotically flat spacetime act the same way, it is found that the charge has\nno effect in the angular momentum-independence of entropy sum and product in\nasymptotically flat spactime.\n", "  We explore the modification of the entropic formulation of uncertainty\nprinciple in quantum mechanics which measures the incompatibility of\nmeasurements in terms of Shannon entropy. The deformation in question is the\ntype so called generalized uncertainty principle that is motivated by thought\nexperiments in quantum gravity and string theory and is characterized by a\nparameter of Planck scale. The corrections are evaluated for small deformation\nparameters by use of the Gaussian wave function and numerical calculation. As\nthe generalized uncertainty principle has proven to be useful in the study of\nthe quantum nature of black holes, this study would be a step toward\nintroducing an information theory viewpoint to black hole physics.\n", "  Sampling from a Boltzmann distribution is NP-hard and so requires heuristic\napproaches. Quantum annealing is one promising candidate. The failure of\nannealing dynamics to equilibrate on practical time scales is a well understood\nlimitation, but does not always prevent a heuristically useful distribution\nfrom being generated. In this paper we evaluate several methods for determining\na useful operational temperature range for annealers. We show that, even where\ndistributions deviate from the Boltzmann distribution due to ergodicity\nbreaking, these estimates can be useful. We introduce the concepts of local and\nglobal temperatures that are captured by different estimation methods. We argue\nthat for practical application it often makes sense to analyze annealers that\nare subject to post-processing in order to isolate the macroscopic distribution\ndeviations that are a practical barrier to their application.\n", "  This paper describes a study of the self-sustaining process in\nwall-turbulence based on a second order statistical state dynamics (SSD) model\nof Couette flow. SSD models with this form are referred to as S3T models and\nself-sustain turbulence with a mean flow and second order perturbation\nstructure similar to that obtained by DNS. The use of a SSD model to study the\nphysical mechanisms underlying turbulence has advantages over the traditional\napproach of studying the dynamics of individual realizations of turbulence. One\nadvantage is that the analytical structure of SSD isolates and directly\nexpresses the interaction between the coherent mean flow and the incoherent\nperturbation components of the turbulence. Isolation of the interaction between\nthese components reveals how this interaction underlies both the maintenance of\nthe turbulence variance by transfer of energy from the externally driven flow\nto the perturbation components as well as the enforcement of the observed\nstatistical mean turbulent state by feedback regulation between the mean and\nperturbation fields. Another advantage of studying turbulence using SSD models\nis that the analytical structure of S3T turbulence can be completely\ncharacterized. For example, turbulence in the S3T system is maintained by a\nparametric growth mechanism. Furthermore, the equilibrium statistical state of\nthe turbulence can be demonstrated to be enforced by feedback regulation in\nwhich transient growth of the incoherent perturbations episodically suppresses\ncoherent streak growth preventing runaway parametric growth of the incoherent\nturbulent component. Using S3T to isolate these parametric growth and feedback\nregulation mechanisms allows a detailed characterization of the dynamics of the\nself-sustaining process in S3T turbulence with compelling implications for\nunderstanding the mechanism of wall-turbulence.\n", "  In this paper, to fit the multi-scale perturbations, the single-parameter Lie\ntransform perturbation theory given in [Ann Phys, 151 1 (1983)] is generalized\nto a multi-parameter case, which provides a formal solution of the new\nLagrangian differential 1-form transformed from the old one. In the new method,\nthe generators and their orders are appropriately chosen under the purpose of\nreducing the fast variables from the new Lagrangian differential 1-form order\nby order. As for the application, this multi-parameter Lie transform method is\napplied to deriving the gyrokinetic model with the presentation of\nlow-frequency electrostatic perturbations. Compared with the conventional\nmodel, the Finite Larmor Radius terms in the Lagrangian 1-form of the new model\nare perfectly cancelled, without using any gauge function.\n", "  We investigate that temperature can be measured by a modified Michelson\ninterferometer, where at least one reflected mirror is replaced by a\nthermalized sample. Both of two mirrors replaced by the corresponding two\nthermalized samples can help to approximatively improve the resolution of\ntemperature up to twice than only one mirror replaced by a thermalized sample.\nFor further improving the precision, a nonlinear medium can be employed. The\nMichelson interferometer is embedded in a gas displaying Kerr nonlinearity. We\nobtain the analytical equations and numerically calculate the precision with\nparameters within the reach of current technology, proving that the precision\nof temperature can be greatly enhanced by using a nonlinear medium. Our results\nshow that one can create an accurate thermometer by measuring the photons in\nthe Michelson interferometer, with no need for directly measuring the\npopulation of thermalized sample.\n", "  In the framework of a model based on the gravitational field of the Kerr\nblack hole, we turn to investigate the kinematic behavior of extragalactic\njets. We analytically calculate the observable velocities and accelerations\nalong any geodesic. Then, by numerical calculations, we apply our results to a\ngeodesic, typical of the M87 jet, and probe our results by confrontation to\nrecent observations. A transition from non-relativistic to ultrarelativistic\nspeeds at subparsec scale is highlighted. This transition comes sooner and more\nabruptly than in models based on magnetic paradigm, which indicates that we\nneed a weaker magnetic field to explain observed synchrotron radiation. We\nattribute the ejection phenomenon to the repulsive effect of the\ngravitomagnetic Kerr field.\n", "  We propose to sharpen the weak gravity conjecture by the statement that,\nexcept for BPS states in a supersymmetric theory, the gravitational force is\nstrictly weaker than any electric force and provide a number of evidences for\nthis statement. Our conjecture implies that any non-supersymmetric anti-de\nSitter vacuum supported by fluxes must be unstable, as is the case for all\nknown attempts at such holographic constructions.\n", "  We study Schr\\\"odinger operators on trees and construct associated Poisson\nkernels, in analogy to the laplacian on the unit disc. We show that in the\nabsolutely continuous spectrum, the generalized eigenfunctions of the operator\nare generated by the Poisson kernel. We use this to define a \"Fourier\ntransform\", giving a Fourier inversion formula and a Plancherel formula, where\nthe domain of integration runs over the energy parameter and the geometric\nboundary of the tree.\n", "  When the Standard Model is interpreted as the renormalizable sector of a\nlow-energy effective theory, the effects of new physics are encoded into a set\nof higher dimensional operators. These operators potentially deform the shapes\nof Standard Model differential distributions of final states observable at\ncolliders. We describe a simple and systematic method to obtain optimal\nestimations of these deformations when using numerical tools, like Monte Carlo\nsimulations. A crucial aspect of this method is minimization of the estimation\nuncertainty: we demonstrate how the operator coefficients have to be set in the\nsimulations in order to get optimal results. The uncertainty on the\ninterference term turns out to be the most difficult to control and grows very\nquickly when the interference is suppressed. We exemplify our method by\ncomputing the deformations induced by the ${\\cal O}_{3W}$ operator in $W^+W^-$\nproduction at the LHC, and by deriving a bound on ${\\cal O}_{3W}$ using $8$ TeV\nCMS data.\n", "  Second-harmonic scattering experiments of water and other bulk molecular\nliquids have long been assumed to be insensitive to interactions between the\nmolecules. The measured intensity is generally thought to arise from incoherent\nscattering due to individual molecules. We introduce a method to compute the\nsecond-harmonic scattering pattern of molecular liquids directly from atomistic\ncomputer simulations, which takes into account the coherent terms. We apply\nthis approach to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water,\nwhere we show that nanosecond second-harmonic scattering experiments contain a\ncoherent contribution arising from radial and angular correlations on a length\nscale of < 1 nm, much shorter than had been recently hypothesized (Shelton, D.\nP. J. Chem. Phys. 2014, 141). By combining structural correlations from\nsimulations with experimental data (Shelton, D. P. J. Chem. Phys. 2014, 141),\nwe can also extract an effective molecular hyperpolarizability in the liquid\nphase. This work demonstrates that second-harmonic scattering experiments and\natomistic simulations can be used in synergy to investigate the structure of\ncomplex liquids, solutions, and biomembranes, including the intrinsic\nintermolecular correlations.\n", "  We present an exhaustive theoretical analysis of a double-loop Josephson\nproximity interferometer, as the one recently realized by Strambini et al. for\nthe control of the Andreev spectrum via an external magnetic field. This\nsystem, called $\\omega$-SQUIPT, consists of a T-shaped diffusive normal metal\n(N) attached to three superconductors (S) forming a double loop configuration.\nBy using the quasiclassical Green function formalism, we calculate the local\nnormalized density of states, the Josephson currents through the device and the\ndependence of the former on the length of the junction arms, the applied\nmagnetic field and the S/N interface transparencies. We show that by tuning the\nfluxes through the double loop, the system undergoes transitions from a gapped\nto a gapless state. We also evaluate the Josephson currents flowing in the\ndifferent arms as a function of magnetic fluxes and explore the quasi-particle\ntransport, by considering a metallic probe tunnel-coupled to the Josephson\njunction and calculating its I-V characteristics. Finally, we study the\nperformances of the $\\omega$-SQUIPT and its potential applications, by\ninvestigating its electrical and magnetometric properties.\n", "  Higgs physics at hadron colliders as the LHC is reviewed within the Standard\nModel (SM) and its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM) by summarizing the\npresent state-of-the-art of theoretical predictions for the production cross\nsections and decay rates.\n", "  This paper presents an accurate density computation approach for large dark\nmatter simulations, based on a recently introduced phase-space tessellation\ntechnique and designed for massively parallel, heterogeneous cluster\narchitectures. We discuss a memory efficient construction of an oct-tree\nstructure to sample the mass densities with locally adaptive resolution,\naccording to the features of the underlying tetrahedral tessellation. We\npropose an efficient GPU implementation for the computationally intensive\noperation of intersecting the tetrahedra with the cubical cells of the deposit\ngrid, that achieves a speedup of almost an order of magnitude compared to an\noptimized CPU version. We discuss two dynamic load balancing schemes - the\nfirst exchanges particle data between cluster nodes and deposits all tetrahedra\nfor each block of the grid structure on single nodes, whereas the second\napproach uses global reduction operations to obtain the total masses. We\ndemonstrate the scalability of our algorithms for up to 256 GPUs and TB-sized\nsimulation snapshots, resulting in tessellations with over 400 billion\ntetrahedra.\n", "  This article is an extended version of previous work of the authors [40, 41]\non low-rank matrix estimation in the presence of constraints on the factors\ninto which the matrix is factorized. Low-rank matrix factorization is one of\nthe basic methods used in data analysis for unsupervised learning of relevant\nfeatures and other types of dimensionality reduction. We present a framework to\nstudy the constrained low-rank matrix estimation for a general prior on the\nfactors, and a general output channel through which the matrix is observed. We\ndraw a paralel with the study of vector-spin glass models - presenting a\nunifying way to study a number of problems considered previously in separate\nstatistical physics works. We present a number of applications for the problem\nin data analysis. We derive in detail a general form of the low-rank\napproximate message passing (Low- RAMP) algorithm, that is known in statistical\nphysics as the TAP equations. We thus unify the derivation of the TAP equations\nfor models as different as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the restricted\nBoltzmann machine, the Hopfield model or vector (xy, Heisenberg and other) spin\nglasses. The state evolution of the Low-RAMP algorithm is also derived, and is\nequivalent to the replica symmetric solution for the large class of vector-spin\nglass models. In the section devoted to result we study in detail phase\ndiagrams and phase transitions for the Bayes-optimal inference in low-rank\nmatrix estimation. We present a typology of phase transitions and their\nrelation to performance of algorithms such as the Low-RAMP or commonly used\nspectral methods.\n", "  We report on the poroelastic indentation response of hydrogel thin films\ngeometrically confined within contacts with rigid spherical probes of radii in\nthe millimeter range. Poly(PEGMA) (poly(ethylene glycol)) methyl ether\nmethacrylate), poly(DMA) (dimethylacrylamide) and poly(NIPAM)\n(\\textit{N}-isopropylacrylamide) gel films with thickness less than 15 $\\mu$m\nwere grafted onto glass substrates using a thiol-ene click chemistry route.\nChanges in the indentation depth under constant applied load were monitored\nover time as a function of the film thickness and the radius of curvature of\nthe probe using an interferometric method. In addition, shear properties of the\nindented films were measured using a lateral contact method. In the case of\npoly(PEGMA) films, we show that poroelastic indentation behavior is adequately\ndescribed within the framework of an approximate contact model derived within\nthe limits of confined contact geometries. This model provides simple scaling\nlaws for the characteristic poroelastic time and the equilibrium indentation\ndepth. Conversely, deviations from this model are evidenced for poly(DMA) and\npoly(NIPAM) films. From lateral contact experiments, these deviations are found\nto result from strong changes in the shear properties as a result of glass\ntransition (poly(DMA)) or phase separation (poly(NIPAM)) phenomena induced by\nthe drainage of the confined films squeezed between the rigid substrates.\n", "  Topological spin liquids are robust quantum states of matter with long-range\nentanglement and possess many exotic properties such as the fractional\nstatistics of the elementary excitations. Yet these states, short of local\nparameters like all topological states, are elusive for conventional\nexperimental probes. In this work, we combine theoretical analysis and quantum\nMonte Carlo numerics on a frustrated spin model which hosts a $\\mathbb Z_2$\ntopological spin liquid ground state, and demonstrate that the presence of\nsymmetry-protected gapless edge modes is a characteristic feature of the state,\noriginating from the nontrivial symmetry fractionalization of the elementary\nexcitations. Experimental observation of these modes on the edge would directly\nindicate the existence of the topological spin liquids in the bulk, analogous\nto the fact that the observation of Dirac edge states confirmed the existence\nof topological insulators.\n", "  The fiber g-ratio is the ratio of the inner to the outer diameter of the\nmyelin sheath of a myelinated axon. It has a limited dynamic range in healthy\nwhite matter, as it is optimized for speed of signal conduction, cellular\nenergetics, and spatial constraints. In vivo imaging of the g-ratio in health\nand disease would greatly increase our knowledge of the nervous system and our\nability to diagnose, monitor, and treat disease. MRI based g-ratio imaging was\nfirst conceived in 2011, and expanded to be feasible in full brain with\npreliminary results in 2013. This manuscript reviews the growing g-ratio\nimaging literature and speculates on future applications. It details the\nmethodology for imaging the g-ratio with MRI, and describes the known pitfalls\nand challenges in doing so.\n", "  Additive manufacturing of polymer bonded magnets is a recently developed\ntechnique, for single-unit production, and for structures that have been\nimpossible to manufacture previously. Also new possibilities to create a\nspecific stray field around the magnet are triggered. The current work presents\na method to 3D print polymer bonded magnets with a variable magnetic compound\ndensity distribution. A low-cost, end-user 3D printer with a mixing extruder is\nused to mix permanent magnetic filaments with pure PA12 filaments. The magnetic\nfilaments are compounded, extruded, and characterized for the printing process.\nTo deduce the quality of the manufactured magnets with a variable compound\ndensity, an inverse stray field framework is used. The effectiveness of the\nprinting process and the simulation method is shown. It can also be used to\nmanufacture magnets that produce a predefined stray field in a given region.\nExamples for sensor applications are presented. This setup and simulation\nframework allows the design and manufacturing of polymer bonded permanent\nmagnets which are impossible to create with conventional methods.\n", "  This paper reports on the frictional properties of smooth rubber substrates\nsliding against rigid surfaces covered with various densities of colloidal\nnano-particles (average diameter 77 nm). Friction experiments were carried out\nusing a transparent Poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) rubber contacting a silica\nlens with silica nano-particles sintered onto its surface. Using a previously\ndescribed methodology (Nguyen \\textit{et al.}, \\textit{J. of Adhesion}\n\\textbf{87} (2011) 235-250 ), surface shear stress and contact-pressure\ndistribution within the contact were determined from a measurement of the\ndisplacement field at the surface of the PDMS elastomer. Addition of silica\nnano-particles results in a strong, pressure-independent enhancement of the\nfrictional shear stress as compared to the smooth lens. The contribution of\nviscoelastic losses to these increased frictional properties is analyzed in the\nlight of a numerical model that solves the contact problem between the rubber\nand the rough surface. An order-of-magnitude agreement is obtained between\nexperimental and theoretical results, the latter showing that the calculation\nof viscoelastic dissipation within the contact is very sensitive to the details\nof the topography of the rigid asperities.\n", "  We report results from twelve simulations of the collapse of a molecular\ncloud core to form one or more protostars, comprising three field strengths\n(mass-to-flux ratios, {\\mu}, of 5, 10, and 20) and four field geometries (with\nvalues of the angle between the field and rotation axes, {\\theta}, of 0{\\deg},\n20{\\deg}, 45{\\deg}, and 90{\\deg}), using a smoothed particle\nmagnetohydrodynamics method. We find that the values of both parameters have a\nstrong effect on the resultant protostellar system and outflows. This ranges\nfrom the formation of binary systems when {\\mu} = 20 to strikingly differing\noutflow structures for differing values of {\\theta}, in particular highly\nsuppressed outflows when {\\theta} = 90{\\deg}. Misaligned magnetic fields can\nalso produce warped pseudo-discs where the outer regions align perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field but the innermost region re-orientates to be perpendicular\nto the rotation axis. We follow the collapse to sizes comparable to those of\nfirst cores and find that none of the outflow speeds exceed 8 km s$^{-1}$.\nThese results may place constraints on both observed protostellar outflows, and\nalso on which molecular cloud cores may eventually form either single stars and\nbinaries: a sufficiently weak magnetic field may allow for disc fragmentation,\nwhilst conversely the greater angular momentum transport of a strong field may\ninhibit disc fragmentation.\n", "  We investigate the effects of disorder in Floquet topological insulators\n(FTIs) occurring in semiconductor quantum wells. Such FTIs are induced by\nresonantly driving a transition between the valence and conduction band. We\nshow that when disorder is added, the topological nature of such FTIs persists\nas long as there is a mobility gap at the resonant quasi-energy. For strong\nenough disorder, this gap closes and all the states become localized as the\nsystem undergoes a transition to a trivial insulator. Interestingly, the\neffects of disorder are not necessarily adverse: we show that in the same\nquantum well, disorder can also induce a transition from a trivial to a\ntopological system, thereby establishing a Floquet Topological Anderson\nInsulator (FTAI). We identify the conditions on the driving field necessary for\nobserving such a transition.\n", "  A superconducting qubit in the strong dispersive regime of a circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics system is a powerful probe for microwave photons in a cavity\nmode. In this regime, a qubit spectrum is split into multiple peaks, with each\npeak corresponding to an individual photon number in the cavity (discrete ac\nStark shift). Here, we measure the qubit spectrum in the cavity that is driven\ncontinuously with a squeezed vacuum field generated by a Josephson parametric\namplifier. By fitting the qubit spectrum with a model which takes into account\nthe finite qubit excitation power, the photon number distribution, which is\ndissimilar from the apparent peak area ratio in the spectrum, is determined.\nThe photon number distribution shows the even-odd photon number oscillation and\nquantitatively fulfills Klyshko's criterion for the nonclassicality.\n", "  The Darwin-Kaula theory of bodily tides is intended for celestial bodies\nrotating without libration. We demonstrate that this theory, in its customary\nform, is inapplicable to a librating body. Specifically, in the presence of\nlibration in longitude, the actual spectrum of Fourier tidal modes differs from\nthe conventional spectrum rendered by the Darwin-Kaula theory for a\nnon-librating celestial object. This necessitates derivation of formulae for\nthe tidal torque and the tidal heating rate, that are applicable under\nlibration.\n  We derive the tidal spectrum for longitudinal forced libration with one and\ntwo main frequencies, generalisation to more main frequencies being\nstraightforward. (By main frequencies we understand those emerging due to the\ntriaxiality of the librating body.) Separately, we consider a case of free\nlibration at one frequency (once again, generalisation to more frequencies\nbeing straightforward).\n  We also calculate the tidal torque. This torque provides correction to the\ntriaxiality-caused physical libration. Our theory is not self-consistent: we\nassume that the tidal torque is much smaller than the\npermanent-triaxiality-caused torque; so the additional libration due to tides\nis much weaker than the main libration due to the permanent triaxiality.\n  Finally, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate in a body experiencing\nforced libration at the main mode, or free libration at one frequency, or\nsuperimposed forced and free librations.\n", "  We report on the evaluation of commercial electroless nickel phosphorus (NiP)\ncoatings for ultracold neutron (UCN) transport and storage. The material\npotential of 50~$\\mu$m thick NiP coatings on stainless steel and aluminum\nsubstrates was measured to be $V_F = 213(5.2)$~neV using the time-of-flight\nspectrometer ASTERIX at the Lujan Center. The loss per bounce probability was\nmeasured in pinhole bottling experiments carried out at ultracold neutron\nsources at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and the Institut Laue-Langevin.\nFor these tests a new guide coupling design was used to minimize gaps between\nthe guide sections. The observed UCN loss in the bottle was interpreted in\nterms of an energy independent effective loss per bounce, which is the\nappropriate model when gaps in the system and upscattering are the dominate\nloss mechanisms, yielding a loss per bounce of $1.3(1) \\times 10^{-4}$. We also\npresent a detailed discussion of the pinhole bottling methodology and an energy\ndependent analysis of the experimental results.\n", "  We study the collective optical response of an atomic ensemble confined\nwithin a single-mode optical cavity by stochastic electrodynamics simulations\nthat include the effects of atomic position correlations, internal level\nstructure, and spatial variations in cavity coupling strength and atom density.\nIn the limit of low light intensity the simulations exactly reproduce the full\nquantum field-theoretical description for cold stationary atoms and at higher\nlight intensities we introduce semiclassical approximations to atomic\nsaturation that we compare with the exact solution in the case of two atoms. We\nfind that collective subradiant modes of the atoms, with very narrow\nlinewidths, can be coupled to the cavity field by spatial variation of the\natomic transition frequency and resolved at low intensities, and show that they\ncan be specifically driven by tailored transverse pumping beams. We show that\nthe cavity optical response, in particular both the subradiant mode profile and\nthe resonance shift of the cavity mode, can be used as a diagnostic tool for\nthe position correlations of the atoms and hence the atomic quantum many-body\nphase. The quantum effects are found to be most prominent close to the narrow\nsubradiant mode resonances at high light intensities. Although an optical\ncavity can generally strongly enhance quantum fluctuations via light\nconfinement, we show that the semiclassical approximation to the stochastic\nelectrodynamics model provides at least a qualitative agreement with the exact\noptical response outside the subradiant mode resonances even in the presence of\nsignificant saturation of the atoms.\n", "  A unique feature of gravity is its ability to control the information\naccessible to any specific observer. We quantify the notion of cosmic\ninformation ('CosmIn') for an eternal observer in the universe. Demanding the\nfiniteness of CosmIn requires the universe to have a late-time accelerated\nexpansion. Combining the introduction of CosmIn with generic features of the\nquantum structure of spacetime (e.g., the holographic principle), we present a\nholistic model for cosmology. We show that (i) the numerical value of the\ncosmological constant, as well as (ii) the amplitude of the primordial, scale\ninvariant, perturbation spectrum can be determined in terms of a single free\nparameter, which specifies the energy scale at which the universe makes a\ntransition from a pre-geometric phase to the classical phase. For a specific\nvalue of the parameter, we obtain the correct results for both (i) and (ii).\nThis formalism also shows that the quantum gravitational information content of\nspacetime can be tested using precision cosmology.\n", "  We propose a toy model of quantum gravity in two dimensions with Euclidean\nsignature. The model is given by a kind of discretization which is different\nfrom the dynamical triangulation. We show that there exists a continuum limit\nand we can calculate some physical quantities such as the expectation value of\nthe area, that is, the volume of the two dimensional euclidean space-time. We\nalso consider the extensions of the model to higher dimensions.\n", "  The idea of determining the magnetic resonance condition in a rotating frame\nof reference is being studied. In this frame, the rotating magnetic field\nshould be at rest. The 3D transformation that determines the transition to the\nframe is found. The Dirac equation in a rotating electromagnetic field after\nsuch a transition is obtained. The magnetic resonance condition is determined\nby the stationarity of solutions. The connection between g-factor in the\nanomalous magnetic moment and a constant in 3D transformation is established.\n", "  We investigate whether cosmological inflation is possible in a class of flux\ncompactifications of type IIA strings on rigid Calabi-Yau manifolds, when all\nperturbative string corrections are taken into account. We confine ourselves to\nthe universal hypermultiplet and an abelian vector multiplet, representing\nmatter in four dimensions. Since all axions can be stabilized by D-instantons,\nwe choose dilaton and a K\\\"ahler modulus as the only running scalars. Though\npositivity of their scalar potential can be achieved, we find that there is no\nslow roll ($\\varepsilon > 2$ and $\\eta >2$), and no Graceful Exit because the\nscalar potential has the run-away behaviour resulting in decompactification. We\nconclude that it is impossible to generate phenomenologically viable inflation\nin the given class of flux compactifications of type IIA strings, without\nexplicit breaking of $N=2$ local supersymmetry of the low-energy effective\naction.\n", "  We investigate the scaling of the R\\'{e}nyi entanglement entropies for a\nparticle bipartition of interacting spinless fermions in one spatial dimension.\nIn the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid regime, we calculate the second R\\'{e}nyi\nentanglement entropy and show that the leading order finite-size scaling is\nequal to a universal logarithm of the system size plus a non-universal\nconstant. Higher-order corrections decay as power-laws in the system size with\nexponents that depend only on the Luttinger parameter. We confirm the\nuniversality of our results by investigating the one dimensional $t-V$ model of\ninteracting spinless fermions via exact-diagonalization techniques. The\nresulting sensitivity of the particle partition entanglement to boundary\nconditions and statistics supports its utility as a probe of quantum liquids.\n", "  The sensitivities to the anomalous quartic gauge boson coupling\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\gamma Z$ are estimated via $\\gamma Z$ production with intact\nprotons in the forward region at the LHC. Proton tagging proves to be a\npowerful tool to suppress the background, which allows consideration of the\nhadronic decays of the $Z$ boson in addition to the leptonic ones. We discuss\nthe discovery potential for an integrated luminosity of $300\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$\nand $3000\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The sensitivity we obtain at\n$300\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ goes beyond the one expected from LHC bounds on the\n$Z\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma\\gamma$ decay by about three orders of magnitude. The\n$\\gamma Z$ channel provides important discriminatory information with respect\nto the exclusive $\\gamma\\gamma$ channel, as many particles beyond the Standard\nModel (such as a radion or Kaluza Klein gravitons) predict a signal in the\nlatter but not the former.\n", "  The paper presents and experimentally investigates a concept of an efficient\nradiation trap based on adiabatic photon confinement between curved mirrors.\nSuch a trap is free of restrictions typical to the Fabry-Perot cells, relating\nto the confined radiation quality and accuracy and stabilization of optical\nelements. Experiments have demonstrated high efficiency of confinement, which\ndepends mainly on the reflectivity of the mirrors and defects on their surface.\n", "  Massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are thought to have formed stars rapidly at\nearly times followed by a long period of quiescence. The recent discovery of a\nMQG, ZF-COSMOS-20115 at $z\\sim4$, only 1.5 Gyr after the big bang, places new\nconstraints on galaxy growth and the role of feedback in early star formation.\nSpectroscopic follow-up confirmed ZF-COSMOS-20115 as a MQG at $z=3.717$ with an\nestimated stellar mass of ${\\sim}10^{11}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, showing no evidence\nof recent star formation. We use the Meraxes semi-analytic model to investigate\nhow ZF-COSMOS-20115 analogues build stellar mass, and why they become\nquiescent. We identify three analogue galaxies with similar properties to\nZF-COSMOS-20115. We find that ZF-COSMOS-20115 is likely hosted by a massive\nhalo with virial mass of ${\\sim}10^{13}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, having been through\nsignificant mergers at early times. These merger events drove intense growth of\nthe nucleus, which later prevented cooling and quenched star formation.\nZF-COSMOS-20115 likely remained quiescent at $z<3.7$. We find that the\nanalogues host the most massive black holes in our simulation and were luminous\nquasars at $z\\sim5$, indicating that ZF-COSMOS-20115 and other MQGs may be the\ndescendants of high-redshift quasars. In addition, the model suggests that\nZF-COSMOS-20115 formed in a region of intergalactic medium that was reionized\nearly.\n", "  Chiral effective field theory (EFT) predictions are necessarily truncated at\nsome order in the EFT expansion, which induces an error that must be quantified\nfor robust statistical comparisons to experiment. In previous work, a Bayesian\nmodel for truncation errors of perturbative expansions was adapted to EFTs. The\nmodel yields posterior probability distribution functions (pdfs) for these\nerrors based on expectations of naturalness encoded in Bayesian priors and the\nobserved order-by-order convergence pattern of the EFT. A first application was\nmade to chiral EFT for neutron-proton scattering using the semi-local\npotentials of Epelbaum, Krebs, and Mei{\\ss}ner (EKM). Here we extend this\napplication to consider a larger set of regulator parameters, energies, and\nobservables as a general example of a statistical approach to truncation\nerrors. The Bayesian approach allows for statistical validations of the\nassumptions and enables the calculation of posterior pdfs for the EFT breakdown\nscale. The statistical model is validated for EKM potentials whose convergence\nbehavior is not distorted by regulator artifacts. For these cases, the\nposterior for the breakdown scale is consistent with EKM assumptions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the heat engine where charged AdS black holes\nsurrounded by dark energy is the working substance and the mechanical work is\ndone via $PdV$ term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics in the\nextended phase space. We first investigate the effects of a kind of dark energy\n(quintessence field in this paper) on the efficiency of the RN-AdS black holes\nas heat engine defined as a rectangle closed path in the $P-V$ plane. We get\nthe exact efficiency formula and find that quintessence field can improve the\nheat engine efficiency which will increase as the field density $\\rho_q$ grows.\nAt some fixed parameters, we find that bigger volume difference between the\nsmaller black holes($V_1$) and the bigger black holes($V_2$ ) will lead to a\nlower efficiency, while the bigger pressure difference $P_1-P_4$ will make the\nefficiency higher but it is always smaller than 1 and will never be beyond\nCarnot efficiency which is the maximum value of the efficiency constrained by\nthermodynamics laws, this is consistent to the heat engine in traditional\nthermodynamics. After making some special choices for thermodynamical\nquantities, we find that the increase of electric charge $Q$ and normalization\nfactor $a$ can also promote heat engine efficiency which would infinitely\napproach the Carnot limit when $Q$ or $a$ goes to infinity.\n", "  Modified gravity theories are supposed to incorporate low-energy\nquantum-gravity effects and, at the same time, they could shed light into the\ndark matter and dark energy problems. Here we study a particular modification\nof general relativity where local Lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken\nand whose physical effects, despite a decade-long effort, were unknown. We show\nthat, during inflation, this modification produces anisotropies that would\ngenerate measurable effects on the Cosmic Microwave Background. Then, by using\nempirical constraints on the B-mode polarization spectrum, we can estimate that\nthe `coefficient' components absolute value have to be smaller than $10^{-43}$.\nThis is a remarkably strong limit, in fact, it is 29 orders of magnitude better\nthan the best constraints on similar coefficients. Thus, we propose that\ninflation could stringently test other modified gravity theories.\n", "  The competition between the length scales associated with the periodicity of\na lattice potential and the cyclotron radius of a uniform magnetic field is\nknown to have dramatic effects on the single-particle properties of a quantum\nparticle, e.g., the fractal spectrum is known as the Hofstadter butterfly.\nHaving this intricate competition in mind, we consider a two-component Fermi\ngas on a square optical lattice with opposite synthetic magnetic fields for the\ncomponents, and study its effects on the many-body BCS-pairing phenomenon. By a\ncareful addressing of the distinct superfluid transitions from the semi-metal,\nquantum spin-Hall insulator or normal phases, we explore the low-temperature\nphase diagrams of the model, displaying lobe structures that are reminiscent of\nthe well-known Mott-insulator transitions of the Bose-Hubbard model.\n", "  Controlling and confining light by exciting plasmons in resonant metallic\nnanostructures is an essential aspect of many new emerging optical\ntechnologies. Here we explore the possibility of controllably reconfiguring the\nintrinsic optical properties of semi-continuous gold films, by inducing\npermanent morphological changes with a femtosecond (fs)-pulsed laser above a\ncritical power. Optical transmission spectroscopy measurements show a\ncorrelation between the spectra of the morphologically modified films and the\nwavelength, polarization, and the intensity of the laser used for alteration.\nIn order to understand the modifications induced by the laser writing, we\nexplore the near-field properties of these films with electron energy-loss\nspectroscopy (EELS). A comparison between our experimental data and full-wave\nsimulations on the exact film morphologies hints toward a restructuring of the\nintrinsic plasmonic eigenmodes of the metallic film by photothermal effects. We\nexplain these optical changes with a simple model and demonstrate\nexperimentally that laser writing can be used to controllably modify the\noptical properties of these semi-continuous films. These metal films offer an\neasy-to-fabricate and scalable platform for technological applications such as\nmolecular sensing and ultra-dense data storage.\n", "  We derive a density matrix (DM) theory for quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) that\ndescribes the influence of scattering on coherences through a generalized\nscattering superoperator. The theory enables quantitative modeling of QCLs,\nincluding localization and tunneling effects, using the well-defined energy\neigenstates rather than the ad hoc localized basis states required by most\nprevious DM models. Our microscopic approach to scattering also eliminates the\nneed for phenomenological transition or dephasing rates. We discuss the\nphysical interpretation and numerical implementation of the theory, presenting\nsets of both energy-resolved and thermally averaged equations which can be used\nfor detailed or compact device modeling. We illustrate the theory's\napplications by simulating a high performance resonant-phonon terahertz (THz)\nQCL design which cannot be easily or accurately modeled using conventional DM\nmethods. We show that the theory's inclusion of coherences is crucial for\ndescribing localization and tunneling effects consistent with experiment.\n", "  In our recent paper entitled \"The return of the King: No-Scale ${\\cal\nF}$-$SU(5)$\", we showed that the model space supporting the most favorable\nphenomenology should have been probed in 2016 at the LHC2, with an even further\nreach into this region of the model in 2017-18. This ideal realm of the\none-parameter version of No-Scale ${\\cal F}$-$SU(5)$ yields a 1.9-2.3 TeV\ngluino mass at the very same point where the light Higgs boson mass enters its\nrather narrow experimentally determined range of $m_h = 125.09 \\pm 0.24$ GeV.\nGiven the recent results reported at Moriond 2017 for 36 ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of\nluminosity collected in 2016 at the 13 TeV LHC2, we now update the status of\nthe No-Scale ${\\cal F}$-$SU(5)$ model space in light of the gluino mass\nexclusion limits presented by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. We illustrate\nthat a resolution could be reached soon as to whether supersymmetry lives in\nthis most critical region of the model space.\n", "  $G_0W_0$ calculations for predicting vertical ionization potentials (IPs) and\nelectron affinities of molecules and clusters are known to show a significant\ndependence on the density functional theory (DFT) starting point. A number of\nnon-empirical procedures to find an optimal starting point have been proposed,\ntypically based on tuning the amount of HF exchange in the underlying hybrid\nfunctional specifically for the system at hand. For the case of\n$\\pi$-conjugated molecular chains, these approaches lead to a significantly\ndifferent amount of HF exchange for different oligomer sizes. In this study, we\nanalyze if and how strongly this size dependence affects the ability of\nnon-empirical tuning approaches to predict accurate IPs for $\\pi$-conjugated\nmolecular chains of increasing chain length. To this end, we employ three\ndifferent non-empirical tuning procedures for the $G_0W_0$ starting point to\ncalculate the IP of polyene oligomers up to 22 repeat units and compare the\nresults to highly accurate coupled-cluster calculations. We find that, despite\nits size dependence, using an IP-tuned hybrid functional as a starting point\nfor $G_0W_0$ yields excellent agreement with the reference data for all chain\nlengths.\n", "  We study the correlations between parameters characterizing neutrino physics\nand the evolution of dark energy. Using a fluid approach, we show that\ntime-varying dark energy models exhibit degeneracies with the cosmic neutrino\nbackground over extended periods of the cosmic history, leading to a degraded\nestimation of the total mass and number of species of neutrinos. We investigate\nhow to break degeneracies and combine multiple probes across cosmic time to\nanchor the behaviour of the two components. We use Planck CMB data and BAO\nmeasurements from the BOSS, SDSS and 6dF surveys to present current limits on\nthe model parameters, and then forecast the future reach from the CMB Stage-4\nand DESI experiments. We show that a multi-probe analysis of current data\nprovides only marginal improvement on the determination of the individual\nparameters and no reduction of the correlations. Future observations will\nbetter distinguish the neutrino mass and preserve the current sensitivity to\nthe number of species even in case of a time-varying dark energy component.\n", "  The characteristic damping times of the natural oscillations of a Kerr black\nhole become arbitrarily large as the extremal limit is approached. This\nbehavior is associated with the so-called zero damped modes (ZDMs), and\nsuggests that extremal black holes are characterized by quasinormal modes whose\nfrequencies are purely real. Since these frequencies correspond to oscillations\nwhose angular phase velocity matches the horizon angular velocity of the black\nhole, they are sometimes called \"synchronous frequencies\". Several authors have\nstudied the ZDMs for near-extremal black holes. Recently, their correspondence\nto branch points of the Green's function of the wave equation was linked to the\nAretakis instability of extremal black holes. Here we investigate the existence\nof ZDMs for extremal black holes, showing that these real-axis resonances of\nthe field are unphysical as natural black hole oscillations: the corresponding\nfrequency is always associated with a scattering mode. By analyzing the\nbehavior of these modes near the event horizon we obtain new insight into the\ntransition to extremality, including a simple way to understand the Aretakis\ninstability.\n", "  Optical lattice experiments with ultracold fermion atoms and quantum gas\nmicroscopy have recently realized direct measurements of magnetic correlations\nat the site-resolved level. We calculate the short-range spin correlation\nfunctions in the ground state of the two-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model\nwith the auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. The results are\nnumerically exact at half filling where the fermion sign problem is absent.\nAway from half-filling, we employ the constrained path AFQMC approach to\neliminate the exponential computational scaling from the sign problem. The\nconstraint employs unrestricted Hartree-Fock trial wave-functions with an\neffective interaction strength U , which is optimized self-consistently within\nAFQMC. Large supercells are studied, with twist averaged boundary conditions as\nneeded, to reach the thermodynamic limit. We find that the nearest-neighbor\nspin correlation always increases with the interaction strength U , contrary to\nthe finite-temperature behavior where a maximum is reached at a finite U value.\nWe also observe a change of sign in the next nearest neighbor spin correlation\nwith increasing density, which is a consequence of the buildup of the\nlong-range anti-ferromagnetic correlation. We expect the results presented in\nthis work to serve as a benchmark as lower temperatures are reached in\nultracold atom experiments.\n", "  We investigate out-of-equilibrium stationary processes emerging in a Discrete\nNonlinear Schroedinger chain in contact with a heat reservoir (a bath) at\ntemperature $T_L$ and a pure dissipator (a sink) acting on opposite edges. We\nobserve two different regimes. For small heat-bath temperatures $T_L$ and\nchemical-potentials, temperature profiles across the chain display a\nnon-monotonous shape, remain remarkably smooth and even enter the region of\nnegative absolute temperatures. For larger temperatures $T_L$, the transport of\nenergy is strongly inhibited by the spontaneous emergence of discrete\nbreathers, which act as a thermal wall. A strongly intermittent energy flux is\nalso observed, due to the irregular birth and death events of the breathers.\nThe corresponding statistics exhibits the typical signature of rare events of\nprocesses with large deviations. In particular, the breather lifetime is found\nto be ruled by a stretched-exponential law.\n", "  We study the effect of electron correlations on a system consisting of a\nsingle-level quantum dot with local Coulomb interaction attached to two\nsuperconducting leads. We use the single-impurity Anderson model with BCS\nsuperconducting baths to study the interplay between the proximity induced\nelectron pairing and the local Coulomb interaction. We show how to solve the\nmodel using the continuous-time hybridization-expansion quantum Monte Carlo\nmethod. The results obtained for experimentally relevant parameters are\ncompared with results of self-consistent second order perturbation theory as\nwell as with the numerical renormalization group method.\n", "  We consider forces acting on objects immersed in, or attached to, long\nfluctuating polymers. The confinement of the polymer by the obstacles results\nin polymer-mediated forces that can be repulsive (due to loss of entropy) or\nattractive (if some or all surfaces are covered by adsorbing layers). The\nstrength and sign of the force in general depends on the detailed shape and\nadsorption properties of the obstacles, but assumes simple universal forms if\ncharacteristic length scales associated with the objects are large. This occurs\nfor scale-free shapes (such as a flat plate, straight wire, or cone), when the\npolymer is repelled by the obstacles, or is marginally attracted to it (close\nto the depinning transition where the absorption length is infinite). In such\ncases, the separation $h$ between obstacles is the only relevant macroscopic\nlength scale, and the polymer mediated force equals ${\\cal A} \\, k_{B}T/h$,\nwhere $T$ is temperature. The amplitude ${\\cal A}$ is akin to a critical\nexponent, depending only on geometry and universality of the polymer system.\nThe value of ${\\cal A}$, which we compute for simple geometries and ideal\npolymers, can be positive or negative. Remarkably, we find ${\\cal A}=0$ for\nideal polymers at the adsorption transition point, irrespective of shapes of\nthe obstacles, i.e. at this special point there is no polymer-mediated force\nbetween obstacles (scale-free or not).\n", "  We analyze a model of double quantum dot Cooper pair splitter coupled to two\nferromagnetic detectors, and demonstrate the possibility of determination of\nspin correlation by current measurements. We use perturbation theory taking\naccount of the exchange interaction with the detectors, which leads to complex\nspin dynamics in the dots. This affects the measured spin and restricts the use\nof ferromagnetic detectors to the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic\nregime at current plateau, where the relevant spin projection is conserved, in\ncontrast to the linear current-voltage characteristic regime, in which the spin\ninformation is distorted. Moreover, we show that for separable states the spin\ncorrelation can only be determined in a limited parameter regime, much more\nrestricted than in the case of entangled states. We propose an entanglement\ntest based on the Bell inequality.\n", "  The short wavelength of graphene plasmons relative to the light wavelength\nmakes them attractive for applications in optoelectronics and sensing. However,\nthis property limits their coupling to external light and our ability to create\nand detect them. More efficient ways of generating plasmons are therefore\ndesirable. Here we demonstrate through realistic theoretical simulations that\ngraphene plasmons can be efficiently excited via electron tunneling in a\nsandwich structure formed by two graphene monolayers separated by a few atomic\nlayers of hBN. We obtain plasmon generation rates of $\\sim10^{12}-10^{14}/$s\nover an area of the squared plasmon wavelength for realistic values of the\nspacing and bias voltage, while the yield (plasmons per tunneled electron) has\nunity order. Our results support electrical excitation of graphene plasmons in\ntunneling devices as a viable mechanism for the development of optics-free\nultrathin plasmonic devices.\n", "  Quantum mechanical calculations had been previously applied to predict phase\nstability in many ternary and multinary nitride systems. While the predictions\nwere very accurate for the Ti-Al-N system, some discrepancies between theory\nand experiment were obtained in the case of other systems. Namely, in the case\nof Ta-Al-N, the calculations tend to overestimate the minimum Al content\nnecessary to obtain a metastable solid solution with a cubic structure. In this\nwork, we present a comprehensive study of the impact of vacancies on the phase\nfields in quasi-binary TaN-AlN and NbN-AlN systems. Our calculations clearly\nshow that presence of point defects strongly enlarges the cubic phase field in\nthe TaN-AlN system, while the effect is less pronounced in the NbN-AlN case.\nThe present phase stability predictions agree better with experimental\nobservations of physical vapour deposited thin films reported in the literature\nthan that based on perfect, non-defected structures. This study shows that a\nrepresentative structural model is crucial for a meaningful comparison with\nexperimental data.\n", "  A new mechanism of radiation emission in the polar gap of a pulsar is\nproposed. It is the curvature radiation which is emitted by returning positrons\nmoving toward the surface of the neutron star along field lines of the inclined\nmagnetic field and reflects from the surface. Such radiation interferes with\ntransition radiation emitted from the neutron star when positrons hit the\nsurface. It is shown that the proposed mechanism may be applicable for\nexplanation of the mystery of the interpulse shift in the Crab pulsar at high\nfrequencies discovered by Moffett and Hankins twenty years ago.\n", "  We show that using the electric field as a quantization variable in nonlinear\noptics leads to incorrect expressions for the squeezing parameters in\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion and conversion rates in frequency\nconversion. This observation is related to the fact that if the electric field\nis written as a linear combination of bosonic creation and annihilation\noperators one cannot satisfy Maxwell's equations in a nonlinear dielectric.\n", "  In elastic-wave turbulence, strong turbulence appears in small wave numbers\nwhile weak turbulence does in large wave numbers. Energy transfers in the\ncoexistence of these turbulent states are numerically investigated in both of\nthe Fourier space and the real space. An analytical expression of a detailed\nenergy balance reveals from which mode to which mode energy is transferred in\nthe triad interaction. Stretching energy excited by external force is\ntransferred nonlocally and intermittently to large wave numbers as the kinetic\nenergy in the strong turbulence. In the weak turbulence, the resonant\ninteractions according to the weak turbulence theory produces cascading net\nenergy transfer to large wave numbers. Because the system's nonlinearity shows\nstrong temporal intermittency, the energy transfers are investigated at active\nand moderate phases separately. The nonlocal interactions in the Fourier space\nare characterized by the intermittent bundles of fibrous structures in the real\nspace.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a family of protocols for growing a private\nencryption key between two parties. Despite much progress, all ground-based QKD\napproaches have a distance limit due to atmospheric losses or in-fibre\nattenuation. These limitations make purely ground-based systems impractical for\na global distribution network. However, the range of communication may be\nextended by employing satellites equipped with high-quality optical links. This\nmanuscript summarizes research and development which is beginning to enable QKD\nwith satellites. It includes a discussion of protocols, infrastructure, and the\ntechnical challenges involved with implementing such systems, as well as a top\nlevel summary of on-going satellite QKD initiatives around the world.\n", "  Extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) regions are a common feature in\ncolor-magnitude diagrams of young and intermediate-age star clusters in the\nMagellanic Clouds. The nature of eMSTOs remains debated in the literature. The\ncurrently most popular scenarios are extended star formation activity and\nranges of stellar rotation rates. Here we study details of differences in MSTO\nmorphology expected from spreads in age versus spreads in rotation rates, using\nMonte Carlo simulations with the Geneva SYCLIST isochrone models that include\nthe effects of stellar rotation. We confirm a recent finding of Niederhofer et\nal. that a distribution of stellar rotation velocities yields an MSTO extent\nthat is proportional to the cluster age, as observed. However, we find that\nstellar rotation yields MSTO crosscut widths that are generally smaller than\nobserved ones at a given age. We compare the simulations with high-quality\nHubble Space Telescope data of NGC 1987 and NGC 2249, which are the two only\nrelatively massive star clusters with an age of ~1 Gyr for which such data is\navailable. We find that the distribution of stars across the eMSTOs of these\nclusters cannot be explained solely by a distribution of stellar rotation\nvelocities, unless the orientations of rapidly rotating stars are heavily\nbiased towards an equator-on configuration. Under the assumption of random\nviewing angles, stellar rotation can account for ~60% and ~40% of the observed\nFWHM widths of the eMSTOs of NGC 1987 and NGC 2249, respectively. In contrast,\na combination of distributions of stellar rotation velocities and stellar ages\nfits the observed eMSTO morphologies very well.\n", "  Despite the fact that the observed gradient in water content among the\nGalilean satellites is globally consistent with a formation in a circum-Jovian\ndisk on both sides of the snowline, the mechanisms that led to a low water mass\nfraction in Europa ($\\sim$$8\\%$) are not yet understood. Here, we present new\nmodeling results of solids transport in the circum-Jovian disk accounting for\naerodynamic drag, turbulent diffusion, surface temperature evolution and\nsublimation of water ice. We find that the water mass fraction of pebbles\n(e.g., solids with sizes of 10$^{-2}$ -- 1 m) as they drift inward is globally\nconsistent with the current water content of the Galilean system. This opens\nthe possibility that each satellite could have formed through pebble accretion\nwithin a delimited region whose boundaries were defined by the position of the\nsnowline. This further implies that the migration of the forming satellites was\ntied to the evolution of the snowline so that Europa fully accreted from\npartially dehydrated material in the region just inside of the snowline.\n", "  We discuss the current status of the anomaly in beryllium-8 nuclear\ntransitions recently reported in the angular distribution of internal\nconversion electron-positron pairs. We present a phenomenological analysis of\nthe signal and review the models proposed to explain it, focusing on those\ninvolving a new light protophobic vector gauge boson. We also elaborate on the\nprospects of verifying the anomaly in present and future experiments.\n", "  Biological neurons receive multiple noisy oscillatory signals, and their\ndynamical response to the superposition of these signals is of fundamental\nimportance for information processing in the brain. Here we study the response\nof neural systems to the weak envelope modulation signal, which is superimposed\nby two periodic signals with different frequencies. We show that stochastic\nresonance occurs at the beat frequency in neural systems at the single-neuron\nas well as the population level. The performance of this\nfrequency-difference-dependent stochastic resonance is influenced by both the\nbeat frequency and the two forcing frequencies. Compared to a single neuron, a\npopulation of neurons is more efficient in detecting the information carried by\nthe weak envelope modulation signal at the beat frequency. Furthermore, an\nappropriate fine-tuning of the excitation-inhibition balance can further\noptimize the response of a neural ensemble to the superimposed signal. Our\nresults thus introduce and provide insights into the generation and modulation\nmechanism of the frequency-difference-dependent stochastic resonance in neural\nsystems.\n", "  Cooperation in repeated public goods game is hardly achieved, unless\ncontingent behavior is present. Surely, if mechanisms promoting positive\nassortment between cooperators are present, then cooperators may beat\ndefectors, because cooperators would collect greater payoffs. In the context of\nevolutionary game theory, individuals that always cooperate cannot win the\ncompetition against defectors in well-mixed populations. Here, we study the\nevolution of a population where fitness is obtained in repeated public goods\ngames and players have a fixed probability of playing the next round. As a\nresult, the group size decreases during the game. The population is well-mixed\nand there are only two available strategies: always cooperate (ALLC) or always\ndefect (ALLD). Through numerical calculation and analytical approximations we\nshow that cooperation can emerge if the players stay playing the game, but not\nfor too long. The essential mechanism is the interaction between the transition\nfrom strong to weak altruism, as the group size decreases, and the existence of\nan upper limit to the number of rounds representing limited time availability.\n", "  We present an analysis of the global stellar populations of galaxies in the\nSAMI Galaxy Survey. Our sample consists of 1319 galaxies spanning four orders\nof magnitude in stellar mass and includes all morphologies and environments. We\nderive luminosity-weighted, single stellar population equivalent stellar ages,\nmetallicities and alpha enhancements from spectra integrated within one\neffective radius apertures. Variations in galaxy size explain the majority of\nthe scatter in the age--mass and metallicity--mass relations. Stellar\npopulations vary systematically in the plane of galaxy size and stellar mass,\nsuch that galaxies with high stellar surface mass density are older, more\nmetal-rich and alpha-enhanced than less dense galaxies. Galaxies with high\nsurface mass densities have a very narrow range of metallicities, however, at\nfixed mass, the spread in metallicity increases substantially with increasing\ngalaxy size (decreasing density). We identify residual correlations with\nmorphology and environment. At fixed mass and size, galaxies with late-type\nmorphologies, small bulges and low Sersic n are younger than early-type, high\nn, high bulge-to-total galaxies. Age and metallicity both show small residual\ncorrelations with environment; at fixed mass and size, galaxies in denser\nenvironments or more massive halos are older and somewhat more metal rich than\nthose in less dense environments. We connect these trends to evolutionary\ntracks within the size--mass plane.\n", "  We study the evolution of accreting oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarfs (WDs),\nwith a particular emphasis on the effects of the presence of the carbon-burning\nproducts $\\mathrm{^{23}Na}$ and $\\mathrm{^{25}Mg}$. These isotopes lead to\nsubstantial cooling of the WD via the $\\mathrm{^{25}Mg}$-$\\mathrm{^{25}Na}$,\n$\\mathrm{^{23}Na}$-$\\mathrm{^{23}Ne}$, and\n$\\mathrm{^{25}Na}$-$\\mathrm{^{25}Ne}$ Urca pairs. We derive an analytic formula\nfor the peak Urca-process cooling rate and use it to obtain a simple expression\nfor the temperature to which the Urca process cools the WD. Our estimates are\nequally applicable to accreting carbon-oxygen WDs. We use the Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution code to evolve a\nsuite of models that confirm these analytic results and demonstrate that\nUrca-process cooling substantially modifies the thermal evolution of accreting\nONe WDs. Most importantly, we show that MESA models with lower temperatures at\nthe onset of the $\\mathrm{^{24}Mg}$ and $\\mathrm{^{24}Na}$ electron captures\ndevelop convectively unstable regions, even when using the Ledoux criterion. We\ndiscuss the difficulties that we encounter in modeling these convective regions\nand outline the potential effects of this convection on the subsequent WD\nevolution. For models in which we do not allow convection to operate, we find\nthat oxygen ignites around a density of $\\log(\\rho_{\\rm c}/\\rm g\\,cm^{-3})\n\\approx 9.95$, very similar to the value without Urca cooling. Nonetheless, the\ninclusion of the effects of Urca-process cooling is an important step in\nproducing progenitor models with more realistic temperature and composition\nprofiles which are needed for the evolution of the subsequent oxygen\ndeflagration and hence for studies of the signature of accretion-induced\ncollapse.\n", "  We present a new algorithm for 3D cone-beam tomography. The algorithm is\nbased on decomposition of the cone-beam backprojection operation and angular\ndecimation. It has computational complexity of $O(N^{3.5})$ and allows\nconsiderable reduction of peak memory usage in comparison with conventional\nalgorithms. Tests with real data demonstrate the acceleration, achieved by\nusing our algorithm instead of FDK, with 20-fold speedup for a $2000 \\times\n2000 \\times 720$ image. The algorithm is compared with other fast FDK\nalgorithms.\n", "  The framework to compute the cross sections for the production of particles\nwith high mass and/or large transverse momentum in double- (DPS), triple-\n(TPS), and in general $n$-parton scatterings, from the corresponding\nsingle-parton ($\\sigma_{\\rm SPS}$) values in high-energy proton-proton,\nproton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus is reviewed. The basic parameter of the\nfactorized $n$-parton scattering ansatz is an effective cross section\n$\\sigma_{\\rm eff}$ encoding all unknowns about the underlying generalized\n$n$-parton distribution in the proton (nucleon). In its simplest and most\neconomical form, the $\\sigma_{\\rm eff}$ parameter can be derived from the\ntransverse parton profile of the colliding protons and/or nucleus, using a\nGlauber approach. Numerical examples for the cross sections and yields expected\nfor the concurrent DPS or TPS production of heavy-quarks, quarkonia, and/or\ngauge bosons in proton and nuclear collisions at LHC and Future Circular\nCollider (FCC) energies are provided. The obtained cross sections are based on\nperturbative QCD predictions for $\\sigma_{\\rm SPS}$ at next-to-leading-order\n(NLO) or next-to-NLO (NNLO) accuracy including, when needed, nuclear\nmodifications of the corresponding parton densities.\n", "  We present theoretical formulation and experimental demonstration of a novel\ntechnique for the fast compression-less terahertz imaging based on the\nbroadband Fourier optics. The technique exploits k-vector/frequency duality in\nFourier optics which allows using a single-pixel detector to perform angular\nscan along a circular path, while the broadband spectrum is used to scan along\nthe radial dimension in Fourier domain. The proposed compression-less image\nreconstruction technique (hybrid inverse transform) requires only a small\nnumber of measurements that scales linearly with the image linear size, thus\npromising real-time acquisition of high-resolution THz images. Additionally,\nour imaging technique handles equally well and on the equal theoretical footing\nthe amplitude contrast and the phase contrast images, which makes this\ntechnique useful for many practical applications. A detailed analysis of the\nnovel technique advantages and limitations is presented, as well as its place\namong other existing THz imaging techniques is clearly identified\n", "  This research uses Twitter, as a social media device, to track communications\nrelated to the 2015 U.S. foodborne illness outbreak linked to Salmonella in\nimported cucumbers from Mexico. The relevant Twitter data are analyzed in light\nof the timeline of the official announcements made by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC). The largest number of registered tweets is\nassociated with the period immediately following the CDC initial announcement\nand the official release of the first recall of cucumbers.\n", "  We perform the calculation of the dc resistivity as a function of temperature\nof the \"strange-metal\" state that emerges in the vicinity of a\nspin-density-wave phase transition in the presence of weak disorder. This\nscenario is relevant to the phenomenology of many important correlated\nmaterials, such as, e.g., the pnictides, the heavy-fermion compounds and the\ncuprates. To accomplish this task, we implement the memory-matrix approach that\nallows the calculation of the transport coefficients of the model beyond the\nquasiparticle paradigm. Our computation is also inspired by the $\\epsilon=3-d$\nexpansion in a hot-spot model embedded in $d$-space dimensions recently put\nforth by Sur and Lee [Phys. Rev. B 91, 125136 (2015)], in which they find a new\nlow-energy non-Fermi liquid fixed point that is perturbatively accessible near\nthree dimensions. As a consequence, we are able to establish here the\ntemperature and doping dependence of the electrical resistivity at intermediate\ntemperatures of a two-dimensional disordered antiferromagnetic metallic model\nwith a composite operator that couples the order-parameter fluctuations to the\nentire Fermi surface. We argue that our present theory provides a good basis in\norder to unify the experimental transport data, e.g., in the cuprates and the\npnictide superconductors, within a wide range of doping regimes.\n", "  Emission from high-dipole moment molecules such as HCN allows determination\nof the density in molecular clouds, and is often considered to trace the\n\"dense\" gas available for star formation. We assess the importance of electron\nexcitation in various environments. The ratio of the rate coefficients for\nelectrons and H$_2$ molecules, $\\simeq$10$^5$ for HCN, yields the requirements\nfor electron excitation to be of practical importance if $n({\\rm H}_2) \\leq\\\n10^{5.5} ~ \\rm cm^{-3}$ and $X({\\rm e}^-) \\geq\\ 10^{-5}$, where the numerical\nfactors reflect critical values $n_{\\rm{}c}({\\rm H_2})$ and $X^*({\\rm{}e}^-)$.\nThis indicates that in regions where a large fraction of carbon is ionized,\n$X({\\rm e}^-)$ will be large enough to make electron excitation significant.\nThe situation is in general similar for other \"high density tracers\", including\nHCO$^+$, CN, and CS. But there are significant differences in the critical\nelectron fractional abundance, $X^*({\\rm e}^-)$, defined by the value required\nfor equal effect from collisions with H$_2$ and e$^-$. Electron excitation is,\nfor example, unimportant for CO and C$^+$. Electron excitation may be\nresponsible for the surprisingly large spatial extent of the emission from\ndense gas tracers in some molecular clouds (Pety et al. 2017; Kauffmann,\nGoldsmith et al. 2017). The enhanced estimates for HCN abundances and HCN/CO\nand HCN/HCO$^+$ ratios observed in the nuclear regions of luminous galaxies may\nbe in part a result of electron excitation of high dipole moment tracers. The\nimportance of electron excitation will depend on detailed models of the\nchemistry, which may well be non-steady state and non-static.\n", "  Master's thesis. We present a study of the BMS Group is higher space-time\ndimensions, and the extension of this group to non-relativistic systems.\n", "  The aim of this work is to describe the spin magnetization of graphene with\nRashba spinorbit coupling and Zeeman effect. It is shown that the magnetization\ndepends critically on the spin-orbit coupling l that is controlled with an\nexternal electric field. In turn, by manipulating the density of charge\ncarriers, it is shown that spin up and down Landau levels mix introducing jumps\nin the spin magnetization. Two magnetic oscillations phases are described that\ncan be tunable through the applied external fields. The maximum and minimum of\nthe oscillations can be alternated by taking into account how the energy levels\nare filled when the Rashba-spin-orbit coupling is turned on. The results\nobtained are of importance to design superlattices with variable spin-orbit\ncoupling with different configurations in which spin oscillations and spin\nfilters can be developed.\n", "  In PT quantum mechanics a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, that\nthe Hamiltonian must be hermitian, is replaced by another set of requirements,\nincluding notably symmetry under PT, where P denotes parity and T denotes time\nreversal. Here we study the role of boundary conditions in PT quantum mechanics\nby constructing a simple model that is the PT symmetric analog of a particle in\na box. The model has the usual particle in a box Hamiltonian but boundary\nconditions that respect PT symmetry rather than hermiticity. We find that for a\nbroad class of PT-symmetric boundary conditions the model respects the\ncondition of unbroken PT-symmetry, namely that the Hamiltonian and the symmetry\noperator PT have simultaneous eigenfunctions, implying that the energy\neigenvalues are real. We also find that the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint under\nthe PT inner product. Thus we obtain a simple soluble model that fulfils all\nthe requirements of PT quantum mechanics. In the second part of this paper we\nformulate a variational principle for PT quantum mechanics that is the analog\nof the textbook Rayleigh-Ritz principle. Finally we consider electromagnetic\nanalogs of the PT-symmetric particle in a box. We show that the isolated\nparticle in a box may be realized as a Fabry-Perot cavity between an absorbing\nmedium and its conjugate gain medium. Coupling the cavity to an external\ncontinuum of incoming and outgoing states turns the energy levels of the box\ninto sharp resonances. Remarkably we find that the resonances have a\nBreit-Wigner lineshape in transmission and a Fano lineshape in reflection; by\ncontrast in the corresponding hermitian case the lineshapes always have a\nBreit-Wigner form in both transmission and reflection.\n", "  Two-mode squeezed states in the limit of small squeezing, Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference and post selection on coincidence counts are some of the staples\nof linear quantum optics. We show that by using classical expectations on\ncentral moments of intensities, we can remove the requirement of small\nsqueezing necessary for high fidelity coincidence detection. Utilizing existing\ntechniques to probabilistically generate a cluster state, we construct a\nstatistical analogue with deterministic generation at the cost of losing the\nability to feed forward and requiring statistical averaging.\n", "  The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) mission is being\ndesigned to establish charged-particle astronomy with ultra-high energy cosmic\nrays (UHECRs) and to observe cosmogenic tau neutrinos (CTNs). The study of\nUHECRs and CTNs from space will yield orders-of-magnitude increase in\nstatistics of observed UHECRs at the highest energies, and the observation of\nthe cosmogenic flux of neutrinos for a range of UHECR models. These\nobservations should solve the long-standing puzzle of the origin of the highest\nenergy particles ever observed, providing a new window onto the most energetic\nenvironments and events in the Universe, while studying particle interactions\nwell beyond accelerator energies. The discovery of CTNs will help solve the\npuzzle of the origin of UHECRs and begin a new field of Astroparticle Physics\nwith the study of neutrino properties at ultra-high energies.\n", "  We describe a concept that has the potential to change how we think about the\nunderlying mechanisms of cell membrane electroporation (EP). Prior\nexperimental, theoretical and modeling have emphasized a single pore lifetime\nas adequate for particular conditions. Here we introduce a much more complex\nresponse: The rapid creation of many types of pore structures, of which some\nare traditional transient lipidic pores (TPs), but the great majority are\ncomplex pores (CPs) based on both lipids and other molecules or molecular\nsegments. At the inner leaflet of the cell plasma membrane (PM) non-lipidic\nmolecules come from the over-crowded cytoplasm. At the outer leaflet they\noriginate from the extracellular medium and extracellular matrix. Some\npartially or fully insert into TPs during or shortly after TP formation, or\nbind to the membrane nearby. This process is complex, leading to mostly\nshort-lived structures, with relatively few lasting for long times. We\nspeculate that the characteristic pore lifetimes range from $\\sim$100 ns to\n1,000 s, based on implications from experiments. The frequency-of-occurrence\nprobably falls off extremely rapidly with increasing lifetime, $\\tau_{CP}$,\nwhich implies that most are inaccessible to traditional experimental methods.\nIt also suggests that unexpected behavior can occur early in pulsing, vanishing\nbefore post-pulse observations begin.\n", "  In this paper, we have used the QUICK scheme of the finite volume method to\ninvestigate the problem of steady 2-D free convective incompressible flow with\nheat and mass transfer in an inclined rectangular domain at different Rayleigh\nnumbers in the range of $10^4 \\le Ra \\le 10^6$, for Prandtl number $Pr=7.2$,\nand Lewis number $Le=1$. We have used no-slip wall boundary conditions for the\ncomponents of velocity and Neumann boundary conditions for temperature and\nconcentration. We have used the QUICK scheme to discretize the governing\nequations along with the boundary conditions chosen in the present problem. The\nSIMPLE algorithm is adopted to compute the numerical solutions of flow\nvariables, $U$-velocity, $V$-velocity, pressure, temperature, and concentration\nas well as the local and average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers at different\nRayleigh numbers in the range mentioned above. Our numerical solutions for\n$U$-velocity along the vertical line through the geometric center has been\ncompared with benchmark solutions available in the literature for\n$\\lambda=15^{\\circ},\\, Ra=10^4,\\, Pr=7.2$, and $Le=1$ and it has been found\nthat it is in the good agreement. Pressure increases with increasing the angles\nof inclination. When the angles of inclination increase from\n$\\lambda=15^{\\circ}$ to $\\lambda=45^{\\circ}$, the intensity of streamlines\ndecreases near the center and secondary cells are formed at the top and bottom\nof the center of the domain. As the Rayleigh number is increased from $10^4$ to\n$10^6$, the average Nusselt number is decreased for $\\lambda=15^{\\circ}$, and\ndecreases and then increases for $\\lambda=45^{\\circ}$, whereas, the average\nSherwood number increases for $\\lambda=15^{\\circ}$ and decreases for\n$\\lambda=45^{\\circ}$.\n", "  The order-disorder transition of a sphere-forming block copolymer thin film\nwas numerically studied through a Cahn-Hilliard model. Simulations show that\nthe fundamental mechanisms of pattern formation are spinodal decomposition and\nnucleation and growth. The range of validity of each relaxation process is\ncontrolled by the spinodal and order-disorder temperatures. The initial stages\nof spinodal decomposition are well-approximated by a linear analysis of the\nevolution equation of the system. In the metastable region, the critical size\nfor nucleation diverges upon approaching the order-disorder transition, and\nreduces to the size of a single domain as the spinodal is approached. Grain\nboundaries and topological defects inhibit the formation of superheated phases\nabove the order-disorder temperature. The numerical results are in good\nqualitative agreement with experimental data on sphere-forming diblock\ncopolymer thin films.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a crucial role in studying cosmology and\ngalactic chemical evolution. They are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) when their masses reach the Chandrasekar\nmass limit in binaries. Previous studies have suggested that He novae may be\nprogenitor candidates of SNe Ia. However, the mass retention efficiencies\nduring He nova outbursts are still uncertain. In this article, we aim to study\nthe mass retention efficiencies of He nova outbursts and to investigate whether\nSNe Ia can be produced through He nova outbursts. Using the stellar evolution\ncode Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we simulated a series of\nmulticycle He-layer flashes, in which the initial WD masses range from 0.7 to\n1.35 Msun with various accretion rates. We obtained the mass retention\nefficiencies of He nova outbursts for various initial WD masses, which can be\nused in the binary population synthesis studies. In our simulations, He nova\noutbursts can increase the mass of the WD to the Chandrasekar mass limit and\nthe explosive carbon burning can be triggered in the center of the WD; this\nsuggests that He nova outbursts can produce SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the mass\nretention efficiencies in the present work are lower than those of previous\nstudies, which leads to a lower birthrates of SNe Ia through the WD + He star\nchannel. Furthermore, we obtained the elemental abundances distribution at the\nmoment of explosive carbon burning, which can be used as the initial input\nparameters in studying explosion models of SNe Ia.\n", "  An absorption mechanism based on second-harmonic generation (ASHG) is\nsuccessfully implemented as a buffer reservoir in a solid-state Er,Yb:Glass\nlaser emitting at telecom wavelength. We show that a slight ASHG rate\nconversion of 0.016% using a BBO crystal enables to cancel out the excess\nintensity noise at the relaxation oscillation frequency, i.e. 35 dB reduction,\nas well as to cancel the amplified spontaneous emission beating at the free\nspectral range resonances of the laser lying in the GHz range.\n", "  We consider a symmetric five-body problem with three unequal collinear masses\non the axis of symmetry. The remaining two masses are symmetrically placed on\nboth sides of the axis of symmetry. Regions of possible central configurations\nare derived for the four- and five-body problems. These regions are determined\nanalytically and explored numerically. The equations of motion are regularized\nusing Levi-Civita type transformations and then the phase space is investigated\nfor chaotic and periodic orbits by means of Poincar\\'e surface of sections.\n", "  The nonleptonic two-body $B^{\\ast}$ ${\\to}$ $\\bar{D}D$ weak decays are\nstudied phenomenologically with the perturbative QCD factorization approach.

The final state of $WW\\gamma$ events containing an\nelectron, a muon and a photon is analysed as well as the final states of\n$WW\\gamma$ and $WZ\\gamma$ production containing an electron or a muon, two jets\nand a photon. For all final states two different fiducial regions are defined:\none yielding the best sensitivity to the production cross-section of the\nprocess and one optimised for the detection of new physical phenomena. In the\nformer region, the $WW\\gamma$ production cross-section is computed and in both\nregions, upper limits on the $WW\\gamma$ and $WZ\\gamma$ production cross-section\nare derived. The results obtained in the second phase space are combined for\nthe interpretation in the context of anomalous quartic gauge couplings using an\neffective field theory.\n", "  The $\\bar{B}_{q}^{\\ast}$ ${\\to}$ $DP$, $DV$ weak decays are studied with the\nperturbative QCD approach, where $q$ $=$ $u$, $d$ and $s$; $P$ and $V$ denote\nthe ground $SU(3)$ pseudoscalar and vector meson nonet. It is found that the\nbranching ratios for the color-allowed $\\bar{B}_{q}^{\\ast}$ ${\\to}$\n$D_{q}{\\rho}^{-}$ decays can reach up to $10^{-9}$ or more, and should be\npromisingly measurable at the running LHC and forthcoming SuperKEKB experiments\nin the near future.\n", "  In a homogeneous medium, the far-field generated by a localized source can be\nexpanded in terms of multipoles; the coefficients are determined by the moments\nof the localized charge distribution. We show that this structure survives to\nsome extent for a random medium in the sense of quantitative stochastic\nhomogenization: In three space dimensions, the effective dipole and quadrupole\n- but not the octupole - can be inferred without knowing the realization of the\nrandom medium far away from the (overall neutral) source and the point of\ninterest.\n  Mathematically, this is achieved by using the two-scale expansion to higher\norder to construct isomorphisms between the hetero- and homogeneous versions of\nspaces of harmonic functions that grow at a certain rate, or decay at a certain\nrate away from the singularity (near the origin); these isomorphisms crucially\nrespect the natural pairing between growing and decaying harmonic functions\ngiven by the second Green's formula. This not only yields effective multipoles\n(the quotient of the spaces of decaying functions) but also intrinsic moments\n(taken with respect to the elements of the spaces of growing functions). The\nconstruction of these rigid isomorphisms relies on a good (and\ndimension-dependent) control on the higher-order correctors and their flux\npotentials.\n", "  For a long time, there have been no efficient ways of controlling\nantiferromagnets. Quite a strong magnetic field was required to manipulate the\nmagnetic moments because of a high molecular field and a small magnetic\nsusceptibility. It was also difficult to detect the orientation of the magnetic\nmoments since the net magnetic moment is effectively zero. For these reasons,\nresearch on antiferromagnets has not been progressed as drastically as that on\nferromagnets which are the main materials in modern spintronic devices. Here we\nshow that the magnetic moments in NiO, a typical natural antiferromagnet, can\nindeed be controlled by the spin torque with a relatively small electric\ncurrent density (~5 x 10^7 A/cm^2) and their orientation is detected by the\ntransverse resistance resulting from the spin Hall magnetoresistance . The\ndemonstrated techniques of controlling and detecting antiferromagnets would\noutstandingly promote the methodologies in the recently emerged\n\"antiferromagnetic spintronics\". Furthermore, our results essentially lead to a\nspin torque antiferromagnetic memory.\n", "  We consider a straight three dimensional quantum layer with singular\npotential supported on a straight wire which is localized perpendicularly to\nthe walls and connects them. We prove that the infinite number of embedded\neigenvalues appears in this system. Furthermore, we show that after introducing\na small surface impurity to the layer, the embedded eigenvalues turn to the\nsecond sheet resolvent poles which state resonances. We discuss the asymptotics\nof the imaginary component of the resolvent pole with respect to the surface\narea.\n", "  In 2+1 dimensions the global U($2N$) symmetry associated with massless Dirac\nfermions is broken to U($N)\\otimes$U($N$) by a parity-invariant mass. I will\nshow how to adapt the domain wall formulation to recover the U($2N$)-invariant\nlimit in interacting fermion models as the domain wall separation is increased.\nIn particular, I will focus on the issue of potential dynamical mass generation\nin the Thirring model, postulated to take place for $N$ less than some critical\n$N_c$. I will present results of simulations of the model using both HMC\n($N=2$) and RHMC ($N=1$) algorithms, and show that the outcome is very\ndifferent from previous numerical studies of the model made with staggered\nfermions, where the corresponding pattern of symmetry breaking is distinct.\n", "  A novel low cost, near equi-atomic alloy comprising of Al, Cu, Fe and Mn is\nsynthesized using arc-melting technique. The cast alloy possesses a dendritic\nmicrostructure where the dendrites consist of disordered FCC and ordered FCC\nphases. The inter-dendritic region is comprised of ordered FCC phase and\nspinodally decomposed BCC phases. A Cu segregation is observed in the\ninter-dendritic region while dendritic region is rich in Fe. The bulk hardness\nof the alloy is ~ 380 HV, indicating significant yield strength.\n", "  We study the statistics of the vertical motion of inertial particles in\nstrongly stratified turbulence. We use Kinematic Simulation (KS) and Rapid\nDistortion Theory (RDT) to study the mean position and the root mean square\n(rms) of the position fluctuation in the vertical direction. We vary the\nstrength of the stratification and the particle inertial characteristic time.\nThe stratification is modelled using the Boussinesq equation and solved in the\nlimit of RDT. The validity of the approximations used here requires\nthat$\\sqrt{{L}/{g}}<{2\\pi}/{\\mathcal{N}}<\\tau\\_{\\eta}$,where $\\tau\\_{\\eta}$ is\nthe Kolmogorov time scale, $g$ the gravitational acceleration, $L$ the\nturbulence integral length scale and $\\mathcal{N}$ the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a\nfrequency. We introduce a drift Froude number$Fr\\_{d} = \\tau\\_p g / \\mathcal{N}\nL$. When $Fr\\_{d} < 1$, the rms of the inertial particle displacement\nfluctuation is the same as for fluid elements, i.e.$\\langle(\\zeta\\_3 - \\langle\n\\zeta\\_3 \\rangle)^2\\rangle^{1/2} = 1.22\\, u'/\\mathcal{N} +\n\\mbox{oscillations}$. However, when $Fr\\_{d} > 1$,$\\langle(\\zeta\\_3 - \\langle\n\\zeta\\_3 \\rangle)^2\\rangle^{1/2} = 267 \\, u' \\tau\\_p$. That is the level of the\nfluctuation is controlled by the particle inertia $\\tau\\_p$ andnot by the\nbuoyancy frequency $\\mathcal{N}$. In other words it seems possible for inertial\nparticles to retain the vertical capping while loosing the memory of\ntheBrunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency.\n", "  The crystal structure, magnetic ordering, and electrical resistivity of\nTlFe1.6Se2 were studied at high pressures. Below ~7 GPa, TlFe1.6Se2 is an\nantiferromagnetically ordered semiconductor with a ThCr2Si2-type structure. The\ninsulator-to-metal transformation observed at a pressure of ~ 7 GPa is\naccompanied by a loss of magnetic ordering and an isostructural phase\ntransition. In the pressure range ~ 7.5 - 11 GPa a remarkable downturn in\nresistivity, which resembles a superconducting transition, is observed below 15\nK. We discuss this feature as the possible onset of superconductivity\noriginating from a phase separation in a small fraction of the sample in the\nvicinity of the magnetic transition.\n", "  It is shown that the set of optical quantum tomograms can be provided with\nthe topology of Frechet space. In such a case the conjugate space will consist\nof symbols of quantum observables including all polynomials of the position and\nmomentum operators.\n", "  After realising qutrit in the form of bipartite system we estimate from below\nthe entropy gain under the action of the amplitude damping channel.\n", "  When the energy functional of a Bose-condensed state of matter features an\neffective gauge potential which depends on the density $\\rho$ of the\ncondensate, the kinetic energy density of the matter field becomes nonlinear in\n$\\rho$ and additional flow-dependent terms enter the wave equation for the\nphase of the condensate wavefunction. To begin with, we consider a certain\nclass of density-dependent `single-component' gauge potentials, and later\nextend this class to encompass more general `multi-component' potentials. The\nnonlinear flow terms are cast into the general form of an inner-product between\nthe velocity field of the fluid and the gauge potential. This is achieved by\nintroducing a coupling matrix of dimensionless functions $\\gamma_{ij}\\left(\n\\rho \\right)$, which characterises the particular functional form of the gauge\npotential and regulates the strengths of the nonlinear terms accordingly. In\nthe momentum-transport equation of the fluid, two non-trivial terms emerge due\nto the density-dependent vector potential. A body-force of dilation appears as\na product of the gauge potential and the dilation rate of the fluid, while the\nfluid stress tensor features a flow-dependent pressure contribution given by\nthe inner-product of the gauge potential and the current density of the fluid.\nThis explicit dependence of the fluid pressure on the flow highlights the lack\nof Galilean invariance of the nonlinear fluid.\n", "  We provide here a reply to: Smaldino, P.

R., Do\nSigmoidal Acquisition Curves Indicate Conformity? bioRxiv 159038 (2017).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1101/159038\n", "  The equilibrium shapes of vesicles are governed by the general shape equation\nwhich is derived from the minimization of the Helfrich elastic free energy and\ncan be reduced to the Willmore equation in a special case. The general shape\nequation is a high order nonlinear partial differential equation and it is very\ndifficult to find analytical solution even in axisymmetric case, which is\nreduced to a seconder ordinary differential equation. Traditional axisymmetric\nshape equation is with the turning radius as the variable. Here we study the\nshape equation with the tangential angle as the variable. In this case, the\nWillmore equation is reduced to the Bernoulli differential equation and the\ngeneral solution is obtained conveniently. We find that the curvature in this\nsolution is discontinuous in some cases, which was ignored by previous\nresearchers. This solution can satisfy the boundary conditions for open vesicle\nwith free edges.\n", "  Almost two decades of observations of radio emission in galaxy clusters have\nproven the existence of relativistic particles and magnetic fields that\ngenerate extended synchrotron emission in the form of radio halos. In the\ncurrent scenario, radio halos are generated through re--acceleration of\nrelativistic electrons by turbulence generated by cluster mergers. Although\nthis theoretical framework has received increasingly supporting observational\nevidence over the last ten years, observations of statistically complete\nsamples are needed in order to fundamentally test model predictions. In this\npaper we briefly review our 7--element Karoo Radio Telescope observations of a\nsample of nearby clusters aimed to test the predictions of the turbulent\nre--acceleration model in small systems ($M_{500} > 4 \\times 10^{14}$\nM$_{\\odot}$). We conclude by presenting two galaxy cluster surveys to be\ncarried out with MeerKAT in order to provide crucial test of models of radio\nhalo formation in nearby ($z < 0.1$) and high redshift ($z > 0.4$) systems\nrespectively.\n", "  We study discrete nonlinear edge excitations of polaritonic kagome lattice.\nWe show that when nontrivial topological phase of polaritons is realized, the\nkagome lattice permits propagation of bright solitons formed from topological\nedge states.\n", "  One of the great challenges of modern science is to faithfully model, and\nunderstand, matter at a wide range of scales. Starting with atoms, the vastness\nof the space of possible configurations poses a formidable challenge to any\nsimulation of complex atomic and molecular systems. We introduce a\ncomputational method to reduce the complexity of atomic configuration space by\nsystematically recognising hierarchical levels of atomic structure, and\nidentifying the individual components. Given a list of atomic coordinates, a\nnetwork is generated based on the distances between the atoms. Using the\ntechnique of modularity optimisation, the network is decomposed into modules.\nThis procedure can be performed at different resolution levels, leading to a\ndecomposition of the system at different scales, from which hierarchical\nstructure can be identified. By considering the amount of information required\nto represent a given modular decomposition we can furthermore find the most\nsuccinct descriptions of a given atomic ensemble. Our straightforward,\nautomatic and general approach is applied to complex crystal structures. We\nshow that modular decomposition of these structures considerably simplifies\nconfiguration space, which in turn can be used in discovery of novel crystal\nstructures, and opens up a pathway towards accelerated molecular dynamics of\ncomplex atomic ensembles. The power of this approach is demonstrated by the\nidentification of a possible allotrope of boron containing 56 atoms in the\nprimitive unit cell, which we uncover using an accelerated structure search,\nbased on a modular decomposition of a known dense phase of boron,\n$\\gamma$-B$_{28}$.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive study of the dark energy equation of state (EoS)\nutilizing the model-independent Gaussian processes (GP). Using a combination of\nthe Union 2.1 data set, the 30 newly added H(z) cosmic chronometer data points\nand Planck's shift parameter, we modify the usual GaPP code and provide a\ntighter constraint on the dark energy EoS than the previous literature about GP\nreconstructions. Subsequently, we take the \"controlling variable method\" to\ninvestigate directly the effects of variable matter density parameter\n$\\Omega_{m0}$, variable cosmic curvature $\\Omega_{k0}$ and variable Hubble\nconstant $H_0$ on the dark energy EoS, respectively. We find that too small or\nlarge $\\Omega_{m0}$, $\\Omega_{k0}$ and $H_0$ are all disfavored by our GP\nreconstructions based on current cosmological observations. Subsequently, we\nfind that variable $\\Omega_{m0}$ and $\\Omega_{k0}$ affect the reconstructions\nof the dark energy EoS, but affect hardly the reconstructions of the normalized\ncomoving distance $D(z)$ and its derivatives $D'(z)$ and $D\"(z)$. However,\nvariable $H_0$ affects the reconstructions of the dark energy EoS by affecting\nobviously those of $D(z), D'(z)$ and $D\"(z)$. Furthermore, we find that the\nresults of our reconstructions support substantially the recent local\nmeasurement of $H_0$ reported by Riess et al.\n", "  Earlier attempts to investigate the changes of the role of friendship in\ndifferent life stages have failed due to lack of data. We close this gap by\nusing a large data set of mobile phone calls from a European country in 2007,\nto study how the people's call patterns to their close social contacts are\nassociated with age and gender of the callers. We hypothesize that (i)\ncommunication with peers, defined as callers of similar age, will be most\nimportant during the period of family formation and that (ii) the importance of\nbest friends defined as same-sex callers of exactly the same age, will be\nstronger for women than for men. Results show that the frequency of phone calls\nwith the same-sex peers in this population turns out to be relatively stable\nthrough life for both men and women. In line with the first hypothesis, there\nwas a significant increase in the length of the phone calls for callers between\nages 30 to 40 years. Partly in line with the second hypothesis, the increase in\nphone calls turned out to be particularly pronounced among females, although\nthere were only minor gender differences in call frequencies. Furthermore,\nwomen tended to have long phone conversations with their same-age female\nfriend, and also with somewhat older peers. In sum, we provide evidence from\nbig data for the adult life stages at which peers are most important, and\nsuggest that best friends appear to have a niche of their own in human\nsociality.\n", "  Many embryonic deformations during development are the global result of local\ncell shape changes and other local active cell sheet deformations.\nMorphogenesis does not only therefore rely on the ability of the tissue to\nproduce these active deformations, but also on the ability to regulate them in\nsuch a way as to overcome the intrinsic variability of and geometric\nconstraints on the tissue. Here, we explore the interplay of regulation and\nvariability in the green alga $Volvox$, whose spherical embryos turn themselves\ninside out to enable motility. Through a combination of light sheet microscopy\nand theoretical analysis, we quantify the variability of this inversion and\nanalyse its mechanics in detail to show how shape variability arises from a\ncombination of geometry, mechanics, and active regulation.\n", "  We develop a mathematical model of extinction and coexistence in a generic\npredator-prey ecosystem composed of two herbivores in asymmetrical competition\nand a hunter exerting a predatory pressure on both species. With the aim of\nrepresenting the satiety of hunters when preys are overabundant, we introduce\nfor the predation behavior a dependence on preys density. Specifically,\npredation is modeled as growing proportionally to the presence of herbivores at\nlow density, and saturating when the total population of prey is sufficiently\nlarge. The model predicts the existence of different regimes depending on the\nparameters considered: survival of a single species, coexistence of two species\nand extinction of the third one, and coexistence of the three species. But more\ninterestingly, in some regions parameters space the solutions oscillate in\ntime, both as a transient phenomena and as persistent oscillations of constant\namplitude. The phenomenon is not present for the more idealized linear\npredation model, suggesting that it can be the source of real ecosystems\noscillations.\n", "  Different dopants with their specific dopant concentration can be utilized to\nproduce ferroelectric HfO$_2$ thin films. In this work it is explored for the\nexample of Sr in a comprehensive first-principles study. Density functional\ncalculations reveal structure, formation energy and total energy of the Sr\nrelated defects in HfO$_2$. We found the charge compensated defect including an\nassociated oxygen vacancy Sr$_\\text{Hf}$V$_\\text{O}$ to strongly favour the\nnon-ferroelectric, tetragonal P4$_\\text{2}$/mnc phase energetically. In\ncontrast, the uncompensated defect without oxygen vacancy Sr$_\\text{Hf}$\nfavours the ferroelectric, orthorhombic Pca2$_\\text{1}$ phase. According to the\nformation energy the uncompensated defect can form easily under oxygen rich\nconditions in the production process. Low oxygen partial pressure existing over\nthe lifetime promotes the loss of oxygen leading to V$_\\text{O}$ and, thus, the\ndestabilization of the ferroelectric, orthorhombic Pca2$_\\text{1}$ phase\naccompanied by an increase of the leakage current. This study attempts to\nfundamentally explain the stabilization of the ferroelectric, orthorhombic\nPca2$_\\text{1}$ phase by doping.\n", "  Analyticity constitutes a rigid constraint on hadron scattering amplitudes.\nThis property is used to relate models in different energy regimes. Using meson\nphotoproduction as a benchmark, we show how to test contemporary low energy\nmodels directly against high energy data. This method pinpoints deficiencies of\nthe models and treads a path to further improvement. The implementation of this\ntechnique enables one to produce more stable and reliable partial waves for\nfuture use in hadron spectroscopy and new physics searches.\n", "  The ability to prepare desired states without allowing time for the atomic\nsystem to spontaneously decay to the ground state is limited by the fact that\nHamiltonian controls cannot affect the purity of the state in question. In this\npaper, we discuss how a continuous off-resonant electromagnetic wave can be\nused to prepare a desired final quantum state. With the aid of plasmonic\nsurface-enhancement, by placing a two-level atomic system near a gold\nnanoparticle, preparation is accomplished in a reduced period of time and with\nlower electric field intensity while the system purity is improved when\ncompared to an isolated system.\n"]}
