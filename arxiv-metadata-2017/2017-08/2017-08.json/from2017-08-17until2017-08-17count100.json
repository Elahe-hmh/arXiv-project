This principle is the basis for a\nmethod to characterize states in quantum computation and simulation with\noptical lattices. As examples, we study the detection of spin correlations in a\nquantum magnetic phase, and the characterization of cluster states.\n", "  We present a formula to evaluate the spontaneous emission spectra of an atom\nin contact with a radiation field with non-Markovian effects. This formula is\nwritten in terms of a two-time correlation of system observables and the\nenvironmental correlation function, and depends on the distance between the\nemitting atom and the detector. As an example, we use it to analyze the\nfluorescence spectra of a two level atom placed as an impurity in a photonic\ncrystal. The radiation field within those materials has a gap or discontinuity\nwhere electromagnetic modes cannot propagate in the stationary limit. In that\nsituation, the atomic emission occurs in the form of evanescent waves which are\ndetected with less efficiency the farther we place the detector. The\nmethodology presented in this paper may be useful to study the non-Markovian\ndynamics of any quantum open system in linear interaction with a harmonic\noscillator reservoir and within the weak coupling approximation.\n", "  We introduce a simple set--up corresponding to the matter-wave analogue of\nimpurity atoms embedded in an infinite photonic crystal and interacting with\nthe radiation field. Atoms in a given internal level are trapped in an optical\nlattice, and play the role of the impurities. Atoms in an untrapped level play\nthe role of the radiation field. The interaction is mediated by means of lasers\nthat couple those levels. By tuning the lasers parameters, it is possible to\ndrive the system through different regimes, and observe phenomena like matter\nwave superradiance, non-Markovian atom emission, and the appearance of bound\natomic states.\n", "  We analyze several aspects of the transport dynamics in the LH1-RC core of\npurple bacteria, which consists basically in a ring of antenna molecules that\ntransport the energy into a target molecule, the reaction center, placed in the\ncenter of the ring. We show that the periodicity of the system plays an\nimportant role to explain the relevance of the initial state in the transport\nefficiency. This picture is modified, and the transport enhanced for any\ninitial state, when considering that molecules have different energies, and\nwhen including their interaction with the environment. We study this last\nsituation by using stochastic Schr{\\\"o}dinger equations, both for Markovian and\nnon-Markovian type of interactions.\n", "  We consider the effect of two different environments on the performance of\nthe quantum adiabatic search algorithm, a thermal bath at finite temperature,\nand a structured environment similar to the one encountered in systems coupled\nto the electromagnetic field that exists within a photonic crystal. While for\nall the parameter regimes explored here, the algorithm performance is worsened\nby the contact with a thermal environment, the picture appears to be different\nwhen considering a structured environment. In this case we show that, by tuning\nthe environment parameters to certain regimes, the algorithm performance can\nactually be improved with respect to the closed system case. Additionally, the\nrelevance of considering the dissipation rates as complex quantities is\ndiscussed in both cases. More particularly, we find that the imaginary part of\nthe rates can not be neglected with the usual argument that it simply amounts\nto an energy shift, and in fact influences crucially the system dynamics.\n", "  Here we first discuss briefly the quantum annealing technique. We then study\nthe quantum annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model with the\ntuning of both transverse and longitudinal fields. Both the fields are\ntime-dependent and vanish adiabatically at the same time, starting from high\nvalues. We solve, for rather small systems, the time-dependent Schrodinger\nequation of the total Hamiltonian by employing a numerical technique. At the\nend of annealing we obtain the final state having high overlap with the exact\nground state(s) of classical spin glass system (obtained independently).\n", "  We show that the low frequency absorption cross section of minimally coupled\ntest massless scalar fields by extremal spherically symmetric black holes in d\ndimensions is equal to the horizon area, even in the presence of\nstring--theoretical $\\alpha'$ corrections. Classically one has the relation\n$\\sigma = 4 G S$ between that absorption cross section and the black hole\nentropy. By comparing in each case the values of the horizon area and Wald's\nentropy, we discuss the validity of such relation in the presence of higher\nderivative corrections for extremal black holes in many different contexts: in\nthe presence of electric and magnetic charges, for nonsupersymmetric and\nsupersymmetric black holes, in d=4 and d=5 dimensions. The examples we consider\nseem to indicate that this relation is not verified in the presence of\n$\\alpha'$ corrections in general, although being valid in some specific cases\n(electrically charged maximally supersymmetric black holes in d=5). We argue\nthat the relation $\\sigma = 4 G S$ should in general be valid for the\nabsorption cross section of scalar fields which, although being independent\nfrom the black hole solution, have their origin from string theory, and\ntherefore are not minimally coupled.\n", "  We present and study a new class of Fock states underlying to discrete\nelectromagnetic Schr\\\"odinger operators from a multivector calculus\nperspective. This naturally lead to hypercomplex versions of Poisson-Charlier\npolynomials, Meixner polynomials, among other ones. The foundations of this\nwork are based on the exploitation of the quantum probability formulation '\\`a\nla Dirac' to the setting of Bayesian probabilities, on which the Fock states\narise as discrete quasi-probability distributions carrying a set of independent\nand identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables. By employing\nMellin-Barnes integrals in the complex plane we obtain counterparts for the\nwell-known multidimensional Poisson and hypergeometric distributions, as well\nas quasi-probability distributions that may take negative or complex values on\nthe lattice $h\\mathbb{Z}^n$.\n", "  Multifractal structure of global monthly mean temperature anomaly time series\nover the period of 1850-2012 are studied in terms of the multifractal detrended\nmoving average (MFDMA) analysis. We try to address the possible source(s) and\nthe nature of multifractality in the time series data by comparing the results\nderived from the actual series with those from a set of shuffled and surrogate\nseries. It is seen that the MFDMA method predicts a multifractal structure of\nthe temperature anomaly records that is more or less similar to what was\nobtained from the multifractal detrended analysis for the same set of data. In\nour analysis the major contribution of multifractality in the data is found to\nbe due to the long-range temporal correlation among the measurements, however\nthe contribution of a fat-tail distribution function of the variables is not\nnegligible. The existence of long-range correlation is also confirmed by the\nconstancy of the local slopes of the fluctuation function over a sufficient\nscale intervals. The results of the moving average analysis are found to depend\nupon the location of the detrending window and tend to the observations of the\nmultifractal detrended analysis for a specific choice of the location of the\ndetrending window.\n", "  Scale-discretised wavelets yield a directional wavelet framework on the\nsphere where a signal can be probed not only in scale and position but also in\norientation. Furthermore, a signal can be synthesised from its wavelet\ncoefficients exactly, in theory and practice (to machine precision).\nScale-discretised wavelets are closely related to spherical needlets (both were\ndeveloped independently at about the same time) but relax the axisymmetric\nproperty of needlets so that directional signal content can be probed. Needlets\nhave been shown to satisfy important quasi-exponential localisation and\nasymptotic uncorrelation properties. We show that these properties also hold\nfor directional scale-discretised wavelets on the sphere and derive similar\nlocalisation and uncorrelation bounds in both the scalar and spin settings.\nScale-discretised wavelets can thus be considered as directional needlets.\n", "  Nanoantennas for light enhance light-matter interaction at the nanoscale\nmaking them useful in optical communication, sensing, and spectroscopy. So far\nnanoantenna engineering has been largely based on rules derived from the radio\nfrequency domain which neglect the inertia of free metal electrons at optical\nfrequencies causing phenomena such as complete field penetration, ohmic losses\nand plasmon resonances. Here we introduce a general and scalable evolutionary\nalgorithm that accounts for topological constrains of the fabrication method\nand therefore yields unexpected nanoantenna designs exhibiting strong light\nlocalization and enhancement which can directly be \"printed\" by focused-ion\nbeam milling. The fitness ranking in a hierarchy of such antennas is validated\nexperimentally by two-photon photoluminescence. Analysis of the best antennas'\noperation principle shows that it deviates fundamentally from that of classical\nradio wave-inspired designs. Our work sets the stage for a widespread\napplication of evolutionary optimization to a wide range of problems in nano\nphotonics.\n", "  A generalization of Tutte polynomial involved in the evaluation of the\nmoments of the integrated geometric Brownian in the Ito formalism is discussed.\nThe new combinatorial invariant depends on the order in which the sequence of\ncontraction-deletions have been performed on the graph. Thus, this work\nprovides a motivation for studying an order-dependent Tutte polynomial in the\ncontext of stochastic differential equations. We show that in the limit of the\ncontrol parameters encoding the ordering going to zero, the multivariate\nTutte-Fortuin-Kasteleyn polynomial is recovered.\n", "  In the last years many studies examined the consistency of students' answers\nin a variety of contexts. Some of these papers tried to develop more detailed\nmodels of the consistency of students' reasoning, or to subdivide a sample of\nstudents into intellectually similar subgroups. The problem of taking a set of\ndata and separating it into subgroups where the elements of each subgroup are\nmore similar to each other than they are to elements not in the subgroup has\nbeen extensively studied through the methods of Cluster Analysis. This method\ncan separate students into groups that can be recognized and characterized by\ncommon traits in their answers, without any prior knowledge of what form those\ngroups would take (unbiased classification). In this paper we start from a\ndetailed analysis of the data coding needed in Cluster Analysis, in order to\ndiscuss the meaning and the limits of the interpretation of quantitative\nresults. Then two methods commonly used in Cluster Analysis are described and\nthe variables and parameters involved are outlined and criticized. Section III\ndeals with the application of these methods to the analysis of data from an\nopen-ended questionnaire administered to a sample of university students, and\nthe quantitative results are discussed. Finally, the quantitative results are\nrelated to student answers and compared with previous results reported in the\nliterature, by pointing out the new insights resulting from the application of\nsuch new methods.\n", "  We consider quantum and private communications assisted by repeaters, from\nthe basic scenario of a single repeater chain to the general case of an\narbitrarily-complex quantum network, where systems may be routed through single\nor multiple paths. In this context, we investigate the ultimate rates at which\ntwo end-parties may transmit quantum information, distribute entanglement, or\ngenerate secret keys. These end-to-end capacities are defined by optimizing\nover the most general adaptive protocols that are allowed by quantum mechanics.\nCombining techniques from quantum information and classical network theory, we\nderive single-letter upper bounds for the end-to-end capacities in repeater\nchains and quantum networks connected by arbitrary quantum channels,\nestablishing exact formulas under basic decoherence models, including bosonic\nlossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels. For\nthe converse part, we adopt a teleportation-inspired simulation of a quantum\nnetwork which leads to upper bounds in terms of the relative entropy of\nentanglement. For the lower bounds we combine point-to-point quantum protocols\nwith classical network algorithms. Depending on the type of routing (single or\nmultiple), optimal strategies corresponds to finding the widest path or the\nmaximum flow in the quantum network. Our theory can also be extended to\nsimultaneous quantum communication between multiple senders and receivers.\n", "  We study the phenomenon of the \"walking droplet\", by means of numerical fluid\ndynamics simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics numerical\nmethod. This phenomenon occurs when a millimetric drop is released on the\nsurface of an oil of the same composition, contained in a tank and subjected to\nvertical oscillations of frequency and amplitude very close to the Faraday\ninstability threshold. At appropriate values of the parameters of the system\nunder study, the oil droplet jumps permanently on the surface of the vibrating\nliquid forming a localized wave-particle system, reminding the behaviour of a\nwave particle quantum system as suggested by de Broglie. In our study, we made\nrelevant simplifying assumptions, however we observe that the wave-drop\ncoupling is surely obtained. Moreover, the droplet and the wave travel at\nnearly constant velocity, as observed in experiments. These facts suggest that\nthe phenomenon may occur in many contexts and opens the possibility to study it\nin an extremely wide range of physical configurations.\n", "  Starting from the representation of the $(n-1)+n-$dimensional Lorentz\npseudo-sphere on the projective space $\\mathbb{P}\\mathbb{R}^{n,n}$, we propose\na method to derive a class of solutions underlying to a Dirac-K\\\"ahler type\nequation on the lattice. We make use of the Cayley transform $\\varphi({\\bf\nw})=\\dfrac{1+{\\bf w}}{1-{\\bf w}}$ to show that the resulting group\nrepresentation arise from the same mathematical framework as the conformal\ngroup representation in terms of the {\\it general linear group}\n$GL\\left(2,\\Gamma(n-1,n-1)\\cup\\{ 0\\}\\right)$. That allows us to describe such\nclass of solutions as a commutative $n-$ary product, involving the\nquasi-monomials $\\varphi\\left({\\bf z}_j\\right)^{-\\frac{x_j}{h}}$ ($x_j \\in\nh\\mathbb{Z}$) with membership in the paravector space $\\mathbb{R}\\oplus\n\\mathbb{R}{\\bf e}_j{\\bf e}_{n+j}$.\n", "  To quantify the fundamental evolution of time-varying networks, and detect\nabnormal behavior, one needs a notion of temporal difference that captures\nsignificant organizational changes between two successive instants. In this\nwork, we propose a family of distances that can be tuned to quantify structural\nchanges occurring on a graph at different scales: from the local scale formed\nby the neighbors of each vertex, to the largest scale that quantifies the\nconnections between clusters, or communities. Our approach results in the\ndefinition of a true distance, and not merely a notion of similarity. We\npropose fast (linear in the number of edges) randomized algorithms that can\nquickly compute an approximation to the graph metric. The third contribution\ninvolves a fast algorithm to increase the robustness of a network by optimally\ndecreasing the Kirchhoff index. Finally, we conduct several experiments on\nsynthetic graphs and real networks, and we demonstrate that we can detect\nconfigurational changes that are directly related to the hidden variables\ngoverning the evolution of dynamic networks.\n", "  We present the public version of hi_class (www.hiclass-code.net), an\nextension of the Boltzmann code CLASS to a broad ensemble of modifications to\ngeneral relativity. In particular, hi_class can calculate predictions for\nmodels based on Horndeski's theory, which is the most general scalar-tensor\ntheory described by second-order equations of motion and encompasses any\nperfect-fluid dark energy, quintessence, Brans-Dicke, $f(R)$ and covariant\nGalileon models. hi_class has been thoroughly tested and can be readily used to\nunderstand the impact of alternative theories of gravity on linear structure\nformation as well as for cosmological parameter extraction.\n", "  Quantum computing has seen tremendous progress in the past years. However,\ndue to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are\nfar from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more\nfeasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers\non the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of Blind Quantum\nComputation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the\ncomputation being performed. In this work, we further develop this idea of\ncomputing over encrypted data, to propose a multiparty delegated quantum\ncomputing protocol in the measurement-based quantum computing framework.\n", "  A unified formulation of rigid body dynamics based on Gauss principle is\nproposed. The Lagrange, Kirchhoff and Newton-Euler equations are seen to arise\nfrom different choices of the quasicoordinates in the velocity space. The\ngroup-theoretical aspects of the method are discussed.\n", "  We report the results of our radio, optical and infra-red studies of a\npeculiar radio source 4C~35.06, an extended radio-loud AGN at the center of\ngalaxy cluster Abell 407 ($z=0.047$). The central region of this cluster hosts\na remarkably tight ensemble of nine galaxies, the spectra of which resemble\nthose of passive red ellipticals, embedded within a diffuse stellar halo of\n$\\sim$1~arcmin size. This system (named the `Zwicky's Nonet') provides unique\nand compelling evidence for a multiple-nucleus cD galaxy precursor.\nMultifrequency radio observations of 4C~35.06 with the Giant Meterwave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 610, 235 and 150 MHz reveal a system of 400~kpc scale\nhelically twisted and kinked radio jets and outer diffuse lobes. The outer\nextremities of jets contain extremely steep spectrum (spectral index -1.7 to\n-2.5) relic/fossil radio plasma with a spectral age of a few$\\,\\times (10^7 -\n10^8)$ yr. Such ultra-steep spectrum relic radio lobes without definitive\nhot-spots are rare, and they provide an opportunity to understand the\nlife-cycle of relativistic jets and physics of black hole mergers in dense\nenvironments. We interpret our observations of this radio source in the context\nof the growth of its central black hole, triggering of its AGN activity and jet\nprecession, all possibly caused by galaxy mergers in this dense galactic\nsystem. A slow conical precession of the jet axis due to gravitational\nperturbation between interacting black holes is invoked to explain the unusual\njet morphology.\n", "  We consider a Hamiltonian lattice field model with two conserved quantities,\nenergy and volume, perturbed by stochastic noise preserving the two previous\nquantities. It is known that this model displays anomalous diffusion of energy\nof fractional type due to the conservation of the volume [5, 3]. We superpose\nto this system a second stochastic noise conserving energy but not volume. If\nthe intensity of this noise is of order one, normal diffusion of energy is\nrestored while it is without effect if intensity is sufficiently small. In this\npaper we investigate the nature of the energy fluctuations for a critical value\nof the intensity. We show that the latter are described by an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by a L\\'evy process which interpolates\nbetween Brownian motion and the maximally asymmetric 3/2-stable L\\'evy process.\nThis result extends and solves a problem left open in [4].\n", "  We develop techniques to solve ill-posed inverse problems on the sphere by\nsparse regularisation, exploiting sparsity in both axisymmetric and directional\nscale-discretised wavelet space. Denoising, inpainting, and deconvolution\nproblems, and combinations thereof, are considered as examples. Inverse\nproblems are solved in both the analysis and synthesis settings, with a number\nof different sampling schemes. The most effective approach is that with the\nmost restricted solution-space, which depends on the interplay between the\nadopted sampling scheme, the selection of the analysis/synthesis problem, and\nany weighting of the l1 norm appearing in the regularisation problem. More\nefficient sampling schemes on the sphere improve reconstruction fidelity by\nrestricting the solution-space and also by improving sparsity in wavelet space.\nWe apply the technique to denoise Planck 353 GHz observations, improving the\nability to extract the structure of Galactic dust emission, which is important\nfor studying Galactic magnetism.\n", "  We use a three-bead-spring model to investigate the dynamics of bi-flagellate\nmicro-swimmers near a surface. While the primary dynamics and scattering are\ngoverned by geometric-dependent direct contact, the fluid flows generated by\nthe swimmer locomotion are important in orienting it toward or away from the\nsurface. Flagellar noise and in particular cell spinning about the main axis\nhelp a surface-trapped swimmer escape, whereas the time a swimmer spends at the\nsurface depends on the incident angle. The dynamics results from a nuanced\ninterplay of direct collisions, hydrodynamics, noise and the swimmer geometry.\nWe show that to correctly capture the dynamics of a biflagellate swimmer,\nminimal models need to resolve the shape asymmetry.\n", "  Molecular vibroic spectroscopy, where the transitions involve non-trivial\nBosonic correlation due to the Duschinsky Rotation, is strongly believed to be\nin a similar complexity class as Boson Sampling. At finite temperature, the\nproblem is represented as a Boson Sampling experiment with correlated Gaussian\ninput states. This molecular problem with temperature effect is intimately\nrelated to the various versions of Boson Sampling sharing the similar\ncomputational complexity. Here we provide a full description to this relation\nin the context of Gaussian Boson Sampling. We find a hierarchical structure,\nwhich illustrates the relationship among various Boson Sampling schemes.\nSpecifically, we show that every instance of Gaussian Boson Sampling with an\ninitial correlation can be simulated by an instance of Gaussian Boson Sampling\nwithout initial correlation, with only a polynomial overhead. Since every\nGaussian state is associated with a thermal state, our result implies that\nevery sampling problem in molecular vibronic transitions, at any temperature,\ncan be simulated by Gaussian Boson Sampling associated with a product of vacuum\nmodes. We refer such a generalized Gaussian Boson Sampling motivated by the\nmolecular sampling problem as Vibronic Boson Sampling.\n", "  We determine the mass scale of Planck galaxy clusters using gravitational\nlensing mass measurements from the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with\nHubble (CLASH). We have compared the lensing masses to the Planck\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) mass proxy for 21 clusters in common, employing a\nBayesian analysis to simultaneously fit an idealized CLASH selection function\nand the distribution between the measured observables and true cluster mass. We\nused a tiered analysis strategy to explicitly demonstrate the importance of\npriors on weak lensing mass accuracy. In the case of an assumed constant bias,\n$b_{SZ}$, between true cluster mass, $M_{500}$, and the Planck mass proxy,\n$M_{PL}$, our analysis constrains $1- b_{SZ} = 0.73\\pm 0.10$ when moderate\npriors on weak lensing accuracy are used, including a zero-mean Gaussian with\nstandard deviation of 8% to account for possible bias in lensing mass\nestimations. Our analysis explicitly accounts for possible selection bias\neffects in this calibration sourced by the CLASH selection function. Our\nconstraint on the cluster mass scale is consistent with recent results from the\nWeighing the Giants program and the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project. It is\nalso consistent, at 1.34$\\sigma$, with the value needed to reconcile the Planck\nSZ cluster counts with Planck's base $\\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies.\n", "  The purpose of this note is to share some observations and speculations\nconcerning the asymptotic behavior of Gromov-Witten invariants. They may be\nindicative of some deep phenomena in symplectic topology that in full\ngenerality are outside of the reach of current techniques. On the other hand,\nmany interesting cases can perhaps be treated via combinatorial techniques.\n", "  The nuclear matrix element determining the $pp\\to d e^+ \\nu$ fusion cross\nsection and the Gamow-Teller matrix element contributing to tritium\n$\\beta$-decay are calculated with lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for the\nfirst time. Using a new implementation of the background field method, these\nquantities are calculated at the SU(3)-flavor-symmetric value of the quark\nmasses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_\\pi$ ~ 806 MeV. The Gamow-Teller\nmatrix element in tritium is found to be 0.979(03)(10) at these quark masses,\nwhich is within $2\\sigma$ of the experimental value. Assuming that the\nshort-distance correlated two-nucleon contributions to the matrix element\n(meson-exchange currents) depend only mildly on the quark masses, as seen for\nthe analogous magnetic interactions, the calculated $pp\\to d e^+ \\nu$\ntransition matrix element leads to a fusion cross section at the physical quark\nmasses that is consistent with its currently accepted value. Moreover, the\nleading two-nucleon axial counterterm of pionless effective field theory is\ndetermined to be $L_{1,A}=3.9(0.1)(1.0)(0.3)(0.9)\\ {\\rm fm}^3$ at a\nrenormalization scale set by the physical pion mass, also in agreement with the\naccepted phenomenological range. This work concretely demonstrates that weak\ntransition amplitudes in few-nucleon systems can be studied directly from the\nfundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom and opens the way for subsequent\ninvestigations of many important quantities in nuclear physics.\n", "  A qudit ($d$-level quantum systems) has a large Hilbert space and thus can be\nused to achieve many quantum information and communication tasks. Here, we\npropose a method to transfer arbitrary $d$-dimensional quantum states (known or\nunknown) between two superconducting qudits coupled to a single cavity. The\nstate transfer can be performed fast because of employing resonant interactions\nonly. In addition, quantum states can be deterministically transferred without\nmeasurement. Numerical simulations show that high-fidelity transfer of quantum\nstates between two superconducting transmon qudits ($d\\leq5$) is feasible with\ncurrent circuit QED technology. This proposal is quite general and can be\napplied to accomplish the same task with various superconducting qudits,\nquantum dots, or natural atoms coupled to a cavity or resonator.\n", "  The dynamics of interacting quantized vortex filaments in a rotating trapped\nBose-Einstein condensate, which is in the Thomas-Fermi regime at zero\ntemperature and described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, is considered in\nthe hydrodynamic \"anelastic\" approximation. In the presence of a smoothly\ninhomogeneous array of filaments (vortex lattice), a non-canonical Hamiltonian\nequation of motion is derived for the macroscopically averaged vorticity, with\ntaking into account the spatial non-uniformity of the equilibrium condensate\ndensity determined by the trap potential. A minimum of the corresponding\nHamiltonian describes a static configuration of deformed vortex lattice against\na given density background. The minimum condition is reduced to a vector\nnonlinear partial differential equation of the second order, for which some\napproximate and exact solutions are found. It is shown that if the condensate\ndensity has an anisotropic Gaussian profile then equation of motion for the\naveraged vorticity admits solutions in the form of a spatially uniform vector\nwith a nontrivial time dependence. An integral representation is obtained for\nthe matrix Green function determining the non-local Hamiltonian of a system of\narbitrary shaped vortex filaments in a condensate with Gaussian density. ... A\nsimple approximate expression for the two-dimensional Green function is\nsuggested at rather arbitrary density profile, and its successful comparison to\nthe exact result in the Gaussian case is done. Approximate equations of motion\nare derived which describe a long-wave dynamics of interacting vortex filaments\nin condensates with the density depending on the transverse coordinates only.\n", "  We investigate electronic and transport properties of bismuth (111) bilayer\nin the context of stability of its topological properties against different\nperturbations. The effects of spin-orbit coupling variations, geometry\nrelaxation and an interaction with a substrate are considered. Transport\nproperties are studied in the presence of Anderson disorder. Band structure\ncalculations are performed within multi-orbital tight-binding model and density\nfunctional theory methods. A band inversion process in bismuth (111) infinite\nbilayer and an evolution of edge states dispersion in ribbons as a function of\nspin-orbit coupling strength are analyzed. A significant change of orbital\ncomposition of the conduction and valence bands during a topological phase\ntransition is observed. A topological phase is shown to be robust when the\neffect of geometry relaxation is taken into account. An interaction with a\nsubstrate has similar effect to an external perpendicular electric field. The\nrobust quantized conductance is observed when the Fermi energy lies within the\nbulk energy gap, where only two counter-propagating edge states are present.\nFor energies where the Fermi level crosses more in-gap states, a scattering is\npossible between channels lying close in $k-$space. When the energy of edge\nstates overlaps with bulk states, no topological protection is observed.\n", "  By applying Wannier-based extended Kugel-Khomskii model, we carry out\nfirst-principles calculations and electronic structure analysis to understand\nthe spin-phonon coupling effect in transition-metal perovskites. We demonstrate\nthe successful application of our approach to SrMnO$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$. We show\nthat both the electron orbitals under crystal field splitting and the\nelectronic configuration should be taken into account in order to understand\nthe large variances of spin-phonon coupling effects among various phonon modes\nas well as in different materials.\n", "  We present the charged-particle pseudorapidity density in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02\\,\\mathrm{Te\\kern-.25exV}$ in centrality classes\nmeasured by ALICE. The measurement covers a wide pseudorapidity range from\n$-3.5$ to $5$, which is sufficient for reliable estimates of the total number\nof charged particles produced in the collisions. For the most central (0-5%)\ncollisions we find $21\\,400\\pm 1\\,300$ while for the most peripheral (80-90%)\nwe find $230\\pm 38$. This corresponds to an increase of $(27\\pm4)\\%$ over the\nresults at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76\\,\\mathrm{Te\\kern-.25exV}$ previously\nreported by ALICE. The energy dependence of the total number of charged\nparticles produced in heavy-ion collisions is found to obey a modified\npower-law like behaviour. The charged-particle pseudorapidity density of the\nmost central collisions is compared to model calculations --- none of which\nfully describes the measured distribution. We also present an estimate of the\nrapidity density of charged particles. The width of that distribution is found\nto exhibit a remarkable proportionality to the beam rapidity, independent of\nthe collision energy from the top SPS to LHC energies.\n", "  The Kondo lattice model of spin-1/2 local moments coupled to the conduction\nelectrons at half-filling is studied for its orbital response to magnetic field\non bipartite lattices. Through an effective charge dynamics, in a canonical\nrepresentation of electrons that appropriately describes the Kondo insulating\nground state, the magnetization is found to show de Haas-van Alphen\noscillations from intermediate to weak Kondo coupling. These oscillations are\nascribed to Lifshitz-like inversion of a dispersion of the gapped\nquasiparticles, whose chemical potential surface is measured by the oscillation\nfrequency. Such oscillations are also predicted to occur in spin-density wave\ninsulators.\n", "  The confinement-deconfinement transition is discussed from topological\nviewpoints. The topological change of the system is achieved by introducing the\ndimensionless imaginary chemical potential ($\\theta$). Then, the non-trivial\nfree-energy degeneracy becomes the signal of the deconfinement transition and\nit can be visualized by using the map of the thermodynamic quantities to the\ncircle $S^1$ along $\\theta$. To understand this \"topological\" deconfinement\ntransition at finite real quark chemical potential ($\\mu_\\mathrm{R}$), we\nconsider the isospin chemical potential ($\\mu_\\mathrm{iso}$) in the effective\nmodel of QCD. The phase diagram at finite $\\mu_\\mathrm{iso}$ is identical with\nthat at finite $\\mu_\\mathrm{R}$ outside of the pion-condensed phase at least in\nthe large-$N_\\mathrm{c}$ limit via the well-known orbifold equivalence. In the\npresent effective model, the topological deconfinement transition does not show\na significant dependence on $\\mu_\\mathrm{iso}$ and then we can expect that this\ntendency also appears at small $\\mu_\\mathrm{R}$. Also, the chiral transition\nand the topological deconfinement transition seems to be weakly correlated. If\nwe will access lattice QCD data for the temperature dependence of the quark\nnumber density at finite $\\mu_\\mathrm{iso}$ with $\\theta=\\pi/3$, our surmise\ncan be judged.\n", "  Different from the previous works on generating entangled states, this work\nis focused on how to transfer the prepared entangled states onto memory qubits\nfor protecting them against decoherence. We here consider a physical system\nconsisting of $n$ operation qubits and $2n$ memory qubits placed in a cavity or\ncoupled to a resonator. A method is presented for transferring $n$-qubit\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled states from the operation qubits\n(i.e., information processing cells) onto the memory qubits (i.e., information\nmemory elements with long decoherence time). The transferred GHZ states are\nencoded in a decoherence-free subspace against collective dephasing, and thus\ncan be immune from decoherence induced by a dephasing environment. In addition,\nthe state transfer procedure has nothing to do with the number of qubits, the\noperation time does not increase with the number of qubits, and no measurement\nis needed for the state transfer. This proposal can be applied to a wide range\nof hybrid qubits such as natural atoms and artificial atoms (e.g., various\nsolid-state qubits).\n", "  As Harvey Brown emphasizes in his book Physical Relativity, inertial motion\nin general relativity is best understood as a theorem, and not a postulate.\nHere I discuss the status of the \"conservation condition\", which states that\nthe energy-momentum tensor associated with non-interacting matter is\ncovariantly divergence-free, in connection with such theorems. I argue that the\nconservation condition is best understood as a consequence of the differential\nequations governing the evolution of matter in general relativity and many\nother theories. I conclude by discussing what it means to posit a certain\nspacetime geometry and the relationship between that geometry and the dynamical\nproperties of matter.\n", "  Partial symmetries are described by generalized group structures known as\nsymmetric inverse semigroups. We use the algebras arising from these structures\nto realize supersymmetry in (0+1) dimensions and to build many-body quantum\nsystems on a chain. This construction consists in associating appropriate\nsupercharges to chain sites, in analogy to what is done in spin chains. For\nsimple enough choices of supercharges, we show that the resulting states have a\nfinite non-zero Witten index, which is invariant under perturbations, therefore\ndefining supersymmetric phases of matter protected by the index. The\nHamiltonians we obtain are integrable and display a spectrum containing both\nproduct and entangled states. By introducing disorder and studying the\nout-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC), we find that these systems are in the\nmany-body localized phase and do not thermalize. Finally, we reformulate a\ntheorem relating the growth of the second Renyi entropy to the OTOC on a\nthermal state in terms of partial symmetries.\n", "  We identify a novel regime of soliton-plasma interactions in which\nhigh-intensity ultrashort pulses of intermediate soliton order undergo coherent\nplasma-induced fission. Experimental results obtained in gas-filled hollow-core\nphotonic crystal fibers are supported by rigorous numerical simulations. The\ncumulative blueshift of higher-order input solitons with ionizing intensities\nresults in pulse splitting before the ultimate self-compression point, leading\nto the generation of robust pulse pairs with PHz bandwidths. The novel dynamics\ncloses the gap between plasma-induced adiabatic soliton compression and\nmodulational instability.\n", "  We investigate the formation of non-equilibrium superconducting states in\ndriven alkali-doped fullerides A$_3$C$_{60}$. Within a minimal three-orbital\nmodel for the superconductivity of these materials, it was recently\ndemonstrated theoretically that an orbital-dependent imbalance of the\ninteractions leads to an enhancement of superconductivity at equilibrium [M.\nKim et al. Phys. Rev. B 94, 155152 (2016)]. We investigate the dynamical\nresponse to a time periodic modulation of this interaction imbalance, and show\nthat it leads to the formation of a transient superconducting state which\nsurvives much beyond the equilibrium critical temperature $T_c$. For a specific\nrange of modulation frequencies, we find that the driving reduces\nsuperconductivity when applied to a superconducting state below $T_c$, while\nstill inducing a superconducting state when the initial temperature is larger\nthan $T_c$. These findings reinforce the relevance of the interaction-imbalance\nmechanism as a possible explanation of the recent experimental observation of\nlight-induced superconductivity in alkali-doped fullerenes.\n", "  Quantum networks distributed over distances greater than a few kilometers\nwill be limited by the time required for information to propagate between\nnodes. We analyze protocols that are able to circumvent this bottleneck by\nemploying multi-qubit nodes and multiplexing. For each protocol, we investigate\nthe key network parameters that determine its performance. We model achievable\nentangling rates based on the anticipated near-term performance of\nnitrogen-vacancy centres and other promising network platforms. This analysis\nallows us to compare the potential of the proposed multiplexed protocols in\ndifferent regimes. Moreover, by identifying the gains that may be achieved by\nimproving particular network parameters, our analysis suggests the most\npromising avenues for research and development of prototype quantum networks.\n", "  Topological behavior has been observed in quantum systems including ultracold\natoms. However, background harmonic traps for cold-atoms hinder direct\ndetection of topological edge states arising at the boundary because the\ndistortion fuses the edge states into the bulk. We propose experimentally\nfeasible protocols to probe localized edge states and dimerization of ultracold\nfermions. By confining cold-atoms in a ring lattice and changing the boundary\ncondition from periodic to open using an off-resonant laser sheet to cut open\nthe ring, topological edge states can be generated. A lattice in a topological\nconfiguration can trap a single particle released at the edge as the system\nevolves in time. Alternatively, depleting an initially filled lattice away from\nthe boundary reveals the occupied edge states. Signatures of dimerization in\nthe presence of contact interactions can be found in selected correlations as\nthe system boundary suddenly changes from periodic to open and exhibit memory\neffects of the initial state distinguishing different configurations or phases.\n", "  It has been known that $B \\rightarrow D^{(*)} \\tau \\nu_{\\tau}$ are good\nobservables in the search for the charged Higgs. The recent obervation of\ndeviation from standard-model by almost 4$\\sigma$ by Babar, Belle and LHCb in\n$R(D^{(*)})$ revived the interest in possible signal of presence of charged\nHiggs in these modes. But such a large deviation in the rates, where\nstandard-model has tree level contribution, coming from a charged Higgs alone\nis highly unlikely. However these decay modes are good probes to search for\nsmall charged Higgs signal if we can construct sensitive observables in these\nmodes. In this work we would like to propose four new observables which shows\nmuch more sensitivity to the presence of charged Higgs than the usual\nobservables such as $A_{\\lambda}^{D^{(*)}}$ and $A_{\\theta}^{D^{(*)}}$. These\nfour observable are (1) $\\frac{1}{A_{\\lambda}^{D}}$,\\ (2) $Y_{1}(q^{2}) =\n\\frac{A^{D}_{\\theta}}{A^{D}_{\\lambda}}$,\\ (3) $Y_{2}(q^{2}) = \\frac{d\\Gamma(B\n\\rightarrow D^{*}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau})}{d\\Gamma_{D}(\\lambda_{\\tau}=+1/2) -\nd\\Gamma_{D}(\\lambda_{\\tau}=-1/2)}$ and (4) $Y_{3}(q^{2}) =\n(\\frac{q^{2}}{m^{2}_{\\tau}})(A^{D}_{\\lambda} + 1)\\frac{1}{A^{D}_{\\lambda}}$.\n", "  The Algorithms for Lattice Fermions package provides a general code for the\nfinite temperature auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. The code is\nengineered to be able to simulate any model that can be written in terms of\nsums of single-body operators, of squares of single-body operators and\nsingle-body operators coupled to an Ising field with given dynamics. We provide\npredefined types that allow the user to specify the model, the Bravais lattice\nas well as equal time and time displaced observables. The code supports an MPI\nimplementation. Examples such as the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice and\nthe Hubbard model on the square lattice coupled to a transverse Ising field are\nprovided and discussed in the documentation. We furthermore discuss how to use\nthe package to implement the Kondo lattice model and the\n$SU(N)$-Hubbard-Heisenberg model. One can download the code from our Git\ninstance at https://alf.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de and sign in to file issues.\n", "  We propose a setup allowing to entangle two directly non-interacting\nradiation modes applying four sequential pulsed quantum resonant interactions\nwith a noisy vibrational mode of a mechanical oscillator which plays the role\nof the mediator. We analyze Gaussian entanglement of the radiation modes\ngenerated by the transducer and confirm that the noisy mechanical mode can\nmediate generation of entanglement. The entanglement, however, is limited if\nthe interaction gains are not individually optimized. We prove the robustness\nof the transducer to optical losses and the influence of the mechanical bath\nand propose the ways to achieve maximal performance through the individual\noptimization.\n", "  This paper compares three different methods about computing joint terms in\non-shell action of gravity, which are identifying the joint term by the\nvariational principle in Dirichlet boundary condition, treating the joint term\nas the limit contribution of smooth boundary and finding the joint term by\nlocal SO(1,$d-1$) transformation. In general metric gravitational theory, we\nshow that the differences between these joint terms are some variational\ninvariants under fixed boundary condition. We also give an explicit condition\nto judge the existence of joint term determined by variational principle and\napply it into general relativity as an example.\n", "  We propose a system of highly efficient photoemitters comprising\nmetal-dielectric (plasmonic-excitonic) multilayered structures. In the proposed\nstructure, the absorption in the excitonic layer is greatly enhanced through\nquantum interference between the split modes arising from the coupling of the\nlayered excitons and the plasmons sustained by the metallic layer. Furthermore,\nthe large interaction volume between surface plasmons and excitons causes\nexciton superradiance, which results in the extremely efficient photoemission.\nThis finding indicates the possibility of designing highly efficient\nphotoemitters based on simple layered structures.\n", "  The rational solutions of the Painlev\\'e-II equation appear in several\napplications and are known to have many remarkable algebraic and analytic\nproperties. They also have several different representations, useful in\ndifferent ways for establishing these properties. In particular,\nRiemann-Hilbert representations have proven to be useful for extracting the\nasymptotic behavior of the rational solutions in the limit of large degree\n(equivalently the large-parameter limit). We review the elementary properties\nof the rational Painlev\\'e-II functions, and then we describe three different\nRiemann-Hilbert representations of them that have appeared in the literature: a\nrepresentation by means of the isomonodromy theory of the Flaschka-Newell Lax\npair, a second representation by means of the isomonodromy theory of the\nJimbo-Miwa Lax pair, and a third representation found by Bertola and Bothner\nrelated to pseudo-orthogonal polynomials. We prove that the Flaschka-Newell and\nBertola-Bothner Riemann-Hilbert representations of the rational Painlev\\'e-II\nfunctions are explicitly connected to each other. Finally, we review recent\nresults describing the asymptotic behavior of the rational Painlev\\'e-II\nfunctions obtained from these Riemann-Hilbert representations by means of the\nsteepest descent method.\n", "  We report on the growth of axial InAs-on-GaAs nanowire heterostructures on\nsilicon by molecular beam epitaxy using 20 nm diameter Au catalysts. First, the\ngrowth parameters of the GaAs nanowire segment were optimized to achieve a pure\nwurtzite crystal structure. Then, we developed a two-step growth procedure to\nenhance the yield of vertical InAs-on-GaAs nanowires. We achieved 90% of\nstraight InAs-on-GaAs nanowires by further optimizing the growth parameters. We\ninvestigated the composition change at the interface by energy dispersive X-ray\nspectroscopy and the nanowire crystal structure by transmission electron\nmicroscopy. The nominal composition of the InAs segment is found to be\nIn$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As with $x$=0.85 and corresponds to 6% of lattice mismatch\nwith GaAs. Strain mapping performed by the geometrical phase analysis of\nhigh-resolution images revealed a dislocation-free GaAs/InAs interface. In\nconclusion, we successfully fabricated highly mismatched heterostructures,\nconfirming the prediction that axial GaAs/InAs interfaces are pseudomorphic in\nnanowires below 40 nm diameter.\n", "  We derive a lower bound on the field excursion for the tachyon inflation,\nwhich is determined by the amplitude of the scalar perturbation and the number\nof $e$-folds before the end of inflation. Using the relation between the\nobservables like $n_s$ and $r$ with the slow-roll parameters, we reconstruct\nthree classes of tachyon potentials. The model parameters are determined from\nthe observations before the potentials are reconstructed, and the observations\nprefer the concave potential. We also discuss the constraints from the\nreheating phase preceding the radiation domination for the three classes of\nmodels by assuming the equation of state parameter $w_{re}$ during reheating is\na constant. Depending on the model parameters and the value of $w_{re}$, the\nconstraints on $N_{re}$ and $T_{re}$ are different. As $n_s$ increases, the\nallowed reheating epoch becomes longer for $w_{re}=-1/3$, 0 and $1/6$ while the\nallowed reheating epoch becomes shorter for $w_{re}=2/3$.\n", "  We present absolute frequency measurement of the unperturbed P7 P7 O$_2$\nB-band transition with relative standard uncertainty of $2\\times10^{-11}$. We\nreached the level of accuracy typical for Doppler-free techniques, with\nDoppler-limited spectroscopy. The Doppler-limited shapes of the P7 P7 spectral\nline were measured with a frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectrometer\nreferenced to an $^{88}$Sr optical atomic clock by an optical frequency comb.\n", "  A Gaussian wave function is used for detailed study of mass spectra of the\n$B$ and $B_S$ mesons using a Cornell potential incorporated with a\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/m)$ correction in the potential energy term and expansion of the\nkinetic energy term up to a ${{\\cal{O}}\\left({\\bf p}^{10}\\right)}$ for\nrelativistic correction of the Hamiltonian. The predicted excited states for\nthe $B$ and $B_s$ mesons are in very good agreement with results obtained by\nexperiment. We assigned the $B_{2}(5747)$ and $B_{s2}(5840)$ as $1^{3}p_{2}$\nstate, the $B_{1}(5721)$ and $B_{s1}(5830)$ as $1 p_{1}$ state, the\n$B_{0}(5732)$ as $1^{3}p_{0}$ state, the $B_{s1}(5850)$ as $1p_{1}^{'}$ state\nand the $B(5970)$ as $2^{3}S_{1}$ state. We investigate the Regge trajectories\nin the $(J,M^{2})$ and $(n_r,M^{2})$ planes with their corresponding\nparameters. Branching ratio for leptonic and radiative-leptonic decays are\nestimated for the $B$ and $B_S$ mesons. Our results are in good agreement with\nexperimental observation as well as outcomes of other theoretical models.\n", "  The effect of imposing a constraint on a fluctuating scalar order parameter\nfield in a system of finite volume is studied within statistical field theory.\nThe canonical ensemble, corresponding to a fixed total integrated order\nparameter, is obtained as a special case of the theory. A perturbative\nexpansion is developed which allows one to systematically determine the\nconstraint-induced finite-volume corrections to the free energy and to\ncorrelation functions. In particular, we focus on the Landau-Ginzburg model in\na film geometry (i.e., a rectangular parallelepiped with a small aspect ratio)\nwith periodic, Dirichlet, or Neumann boundary conditions in the transverse\ndirection and periodic boundary conditions in the remaining, lateral\ndirections. Within the expansion in terms of $\\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the\nspatial dimension of the bulk, the finite-size contribution to the free energy\nand the associated critical Casimir force are calculated to leading order in\n$\\epsilon$ and are compared to the corresponding expressions for an\nunconstrained (grand canonical) system. The constraint restricts the\nfluctuations within the system and it accordingly modifies the residual\nfinite-size free energy. The resulting Casimir force is shown to depend on\nwhether it is defined by assuming a fixed transverse area or a fixed total\nvolume. In the former case, the constraint is typically found to significantly\nenhance the attractive character of the force as compared to the grand\ncanonical case. In contrast to the grand canonical Casimir force, which, for\nsupercritical temperatures, vanishes in the limit of thick films, the canonical\nCasimir force defined for fixed transverse area attains for thick films a\nnegative value for all boundary conditions studied here. Typically, the\ndependence of the Casimir force both on the temperature- and on the field-like\nscaling variables is different in the two ensembles.\n", "  Hedin's scheme is solved with the inclusion of the vertex function\n($GW\\Gamma$) for a set of small molecules.\n  The computational scheme allows for the consistent inclusion of the vertex\nboth at the polarizability level and in the self-energy.\n  A diagrammatic analysis shows that the self-energy formed with this\nfour-point vertex does not lead to double counting of diagrams, that can be\nclassified as direct \"bubbles\" and exchange diagrams.\n  By removing the exchange diagrams from the self-energy, a simpler\napproximation is obtained, called $GW^{\\rm{tc-tc}}$.\n  Very good agreement with expensive wavefunction-based methods is obtained for\nboth approximations.\n", "  We apply a formalism accounting for thermal effects (such as modified\nSommerfeld effect; Salpeter correction; decohering scatterings; dissociation of\nbound states), to one of the simplest WIMP-like dark matter models, associated\nwith an \"inert\" Higgs doublet. A broad temperature range T ~ M/20...M/10^4 is\nconsidered, stressing the importance and less-understood nature of late\nannihilation stages. Even though only weak interactions play a role, we find\nthat resummed real and virtual corrections increase the tree-level overclosure\nbound by 1...18%, depending on quartic couplings and mass splittings.\n", "  Through the last three decades, accurate simulation of the interactions of\nparticles with matter and modeling of detector geometries has proven to be of\ncritical importance to the success of the international high-energy physics\n(HEP) experimental programs. For example, the detailed detector modeling and\naccurate physics of the Geant4-based simulation software of the CMS and ATLAS\nparticle physics experiments at the European Center of Nuclear Research (CERN)\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) was a determinant factor for these collaborations\nto deliver physics results of outstanding quality faster than any hadron\ncollider experiment ever before.\n  This review article highlights the impact of detector simulation on particle\nphysics collider experiments. It presents numerous examples of the use of\nsimulation, from detector design and optimization, through software and\ncomputing development and testing, to cases where the use of simulation samples\nmade a difference in the precision of the physics results and publication\nturnaround, from data-taking to submission. It also presents estimates of the\ncost and economic impact of simulation in the CMS experiment.\n  Future experiments will collect orders of magnitude more data with\nincreasingly complex detectors, taxing heavily the performance of simulation\nand reconstruction software. Consequently, exploring solutions to speed up\nsimulation and reconstruction software to satisfy the growing demand of\ncomputing resources in a time of flat budgets is a matter that deserves\nimmediate attention. The article ends with a short discussion on the potential\nsolutions that are being considered, based on leveraging core count growth in\nmulticore machines, using new generation coprocessors, and re-engineering HEP\ncode for concurrency and parallel computing.\n", "  We combine the latest spectrally stacked data of 21-cm emission from the\nALFALFA survey with an updated version of the Dark Sage semi-analytic model to\ninvestigate the relative contributions of secular and environmental\nastrophysical processes on shaping the HI fractions and quiescence of galaxies\nin the local Universe. We calibrate the model to match the observed mean HI\nfraction of all galaxies as a function of stellar mass. Without consideration\nof stellar feedback, disc instabilities, and active galactic nuclei, we show\nhow the slope and normalisation of this relation would change significantly. We\nfind Dark Sage can reproduce the relative impact that halo mass is observed to\nhave on satellites' HI fractions and quiescent fraction. However, the model\nsatellites are systematically gas-poor. We discuss how this could be affected\nby satellite--central cross-contamination from the group-finding algorithm\napplied to the observed galaxies, but that it is not the full story. From our\nresults, we suggest the anti-correlation between satellites' HI fractions and\nhost halo mass, seen at fixed stellar mass and fixed specific star formation\nrate, can be attributed almost entirely to ram-pressure stripping of cold gas.\nMeanwhile, stripping of hot gas from around the satellites drives the\ncorrelation of quiescent fraction with halo mass at fixed stellar mass. Further\ndetail in the modelling of galaxy discs' centres is required to solidify this\nresult, however. We contextualise our results with those from other\nsemi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations.\n", "  The Telescope Array (TA) shows a 20$^{\\circ}$ hotspot as well as an excess of\nUHECRs above 50~EeV when compared with the Auger spectrum. We consider the\npossibility that both the TA excess and hotspot are due to a dominant source in\nthe Northern sky. We carry out detailed simulations of UHECR propagation in\nboth the intergalactic medium and the Galaxy, using different values for the\nintergalactic magnetic field. We consider two general classes of sources:\ntransients and steady, adopting a mixed UHECR composition that is consistent\nwith the one found by Auger. The spatial location of the sources is draw\nrandomly. We generate Auger-like and TA-like data sets from which we determine\nthe spectrum, the sky maps and the level of anisotropy. We find that, while\nsteady sources are favored over transients, it is unlikely to account for all\nthe currently available observational data. While we reproduce fairly well the\nAuger spectrum for the vast majority of the simulated data sets, most of the\nsimulated data sets with a spectrum compatible with that of TA (at most a few\npercent depending on density model tested) show a much stronger anisotropy than\nthe one observed. We find that the rare cases in which both the spectrum and\nthe anisotropy are consistent require a steady source within $\\sim 10$ Mpc, to\naccount for the flux excess, and a strong extragalactic magnetic field $\\sim\n10$ nG, to reduce the excessive anisotropy.\n", "  The numerical simulation of a Poiseuille flow in a narrow channel using the\nmolecular dynamics simulation (MDS) is performed. Poiseuille flow of liquid\nArgon in a carbon nanochannel is simulated by embedding the fluid particles in\na uniform force field. Density, velocity and Temperature profiles across the\nchannel are investigated. When particles will be inserted into the flow, it is\nexpected that the dynamics of flow will depend on the thermostat chosen. To\nobtain a more uniform temperature distribution across the channel we use local\nthermostating near the wall. The obtained results show that velocity profile,\nslip length and slip velocity depends on the driving force.\n", "  We present a unique method for solving for the Reynolds stress in turbulent\ncanonical flows, based on the momentum balance for a control volume moving at\nthe local mean velocity. A differential transform converts this momentum\nbalance to a solvable form. Comparisons with experimental and computational\ndata in simple geometries show quite good agreements. An alternate picture for\nthe turbulence momentum transport is offered, as verified with data, where the\nturbulence momentum is transported by the mean velocity while being dissipated\nby viscosity. The net momentum transport is the Reynolds stress. This\nturbulence momentum balance is verified using DNS and experimental data.\nImplications of this work are that the Reynolds stress can be written\nexplicitly in terms of basic turbulence parameters in a simple form, derived\nfrom pure fluid physics, and that potential exists for applications of this\nconcept to more complex turbulent flows.\n", "  Shan-Chen model is a numerical scheme to simulate multiphase fluid flows\nusing Lattice Boltzmann approach. The original Shan-Chen model suffers from\ninability to accurately predict behavior of air bubbles interacting in a\nnon-aqueous fluid. In the present study, we extended the Shan-Chen model to\ntake the effect of the attraction-repulsion barriers among bubbles in to\naccount. The proposed model corrects the interaction and coalescence criterion\nof the original Shan-Chen scheme in order to have a more accurate simulation of\nbubbles morphology in a metal foam. The model is based on forming a thin film\n(narrow channel) between merging bubbles during growth. Rupturing of the film\noccurs when an oscillation in velocity and pressure arises inside the channel\nfollowed by merging of the bubbles. Comparing numerical results obtained from\nproposed model with mettallorgraphy images for aluminum A356 demonstrated a\ngood consistency in mean bubble size and bubbles distribution\n", "  We consider a member of the family of scalar-tensor theories of Inflation -\nthe so-called Horndeski model for Inflation, for which we calculate the\nnon-Gaussianity (NG) and the power spectrum of curvature perturbations. We\nconcentrate on the determination of the power spectrum, and the bi-spectrum\nalong with the associated $f_\\mathrm{NL}$ parameter and the Spectral Index. We\nfollow the methodology outlined within the Quantum field theory framework\n(S-matrix approach and Weinberg's 'in-in' formalism) and compare - whenever\nnecessary - our findings with those obtained via the traditional $\\delta$N\nformalism. The work contained herein is an extensive review of the existing\nliterature on this subject and the 'Inflationary theory' in general, along with\nsome newly developed techniques and calculations.\n", "  In this work the conduction of ion-water solution through two discrete\nbundles of armchair carbon and silicon carbide nanotubes, as useful membranes\nfor water desalination, is studied. In order that studies on different types of\nnanotubes be comparable, the chiral vectors of C and Si-C nanotubes are\nselected as (7,7) and (5,5), respectively, so that a similar volume of fluid is\ninvestigated flowing through two similar dimension membranes. Different\nhydrostatic pressures are applied and the flow rates of water and ions are\ncalculated through molecular dynamics simulations. Consequently, according to\nconductance of water per each nanotube, per nanosecond, it is perceived that at\nlower pressures (below 150 MPa) the Si-C nanotubes seem to be more applicable,\nwhile higher hydrostatic pressures make carbon nanotube membranes more suitable\nfor water desalination.\n", "  We present observations of the double-peaked broad H$\\alpha$ profile emitted\nby the active nucleus of NGC 7213 using the the Gemini South Telescope in 13\nepochs between 2011 September 27 and 2013 July 23. This is the first time that\nthe double-peaked line profile of this nucleus -- typical of gas emission from\nthe outer parts of an accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) -- is reported to vary. From the analysis of the line profiles we find\ntwo variability timescales: (1) the shortest one, between 7 and 28 days, is\nconsistent with the light travel time between the ionizing source and the part\nof the disk emitting the line; and (2) a longer one of $\\gtrsim 3$ months\ncorresponding to variations in the relative intensity of the blue and red sides\nof the profile, which can be identified with the dynamical timescale of this\nouter part of the the accretion disk. We modeled the line profiles as due to\nemission from a region between $\\approx$ 300 and 3000 gravitational radii of a\nrelativistic, Keplerian accretion disk surrounding the SMBH. Superposed on the\ndisk emissivity, the model includes an asymmetric feature in the shape of a\nspiral arm with a rotation period of $\\approx$ 21 months, which reproduces the\nvariations in the relative intensity of the blue and red sides of the profile.\nBesides these variations, the $rms$ variation profile reveals the presence of\nanother variable component in the broad line, with smaller velocity width\nW$_{68}$ (the width of the profile corresponding to 68$\\%$ of the flux) of\n$\\sim 2100$ km s$^{-1}$.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the additivity phenomenon in the dynamic\ncapacity of a quantum channel for trading classical communication, quantum\ncommunication and entanglement. Understanding such additivity property is\nimportant if we want to optimally use a quantum channel for general\ncommunication purpose. However, in a lot of cases, the channel one will be\nusing only has an additive single or double resource capacity, and it is\nlargely unknown if this could lead to an superadditive double or triple\nresource capacity. For example, if a channel has an additive classical and\nquantum capacity, can the classical-quantum capacity be superadditive? In this\nwork, we answer such questions affirmatively.\n  We give proof-of-principle requirements for these channels to exist. In most\ncases, we can provide an explicit construction of these quantum channels. The\nexistence of these superadditive phenomena is surprising in contrast to the\nresult that the additivity of both classical-entanglement and classical-quantum\ncapacity regions imply the additivity of the triple capacity region.\n", "  Surface scattering is the key limiting factor to thermal transport in\ndielectric crystals as the length scales are reduced or when temperature is\nlowered. To explain this phenomenon, it is commonly assumed that the mean free\npaths of heat carriers are bound by the crystal size and that thermal\nconductivity is reduced in a manner proportional to such mean free paths. We\nshow here that these conclusions rely on simplifying assumptions and\napproximated transport models. Instead, starting from the linearized Boltzmann\ntransport equation in the relaxon basis, we show how the problem can be reduced\nto a set of decoupled linear differential equations. Then, the heat flow can be\ninterpreted as a hydrodynamic phenomenon, with the relaxon gas being slowed\ndown in proximity of a surface by friction effects, similar to the flux of a\nviscous fluid in a pipe. As an example, we study a ribbon and a trench of\nmonolayer molybdenum disulphide, describing the procedure to reconstruct the\ntemperature and thermal conductivity profile in the sample interior and showing\nhow to estimate the effect of nanostructuring. The approach is general and\ncould be extended to other transport carriers, such as electrons, or extended\nto materials of higher dimensionality and to different geometries, such as thin\nfilms.\n", "  We extend our recent study on the duality between stringy higher spin\ntheories and free CFTs in the $SU(N)$ adjoint representation to other matrix\nmodels namely the free $SO(N)$ and $Sp(N)$ adjoint models as well as the free\n$U(N)\\times U(M)$ bi-fundamental and $O(N)\\times O(M)$ bi-vector models. After\ndetermining the spectrum of the theories in the planar limit by Polya counting,\nwe compute the one loop vacuum energy and Casimir energy for their respective\nbulk duals by means of the CIRZ method that we have introduced recently. We\nalso elaborate on possible ambiguities in the application of this method.\n", "  In this paper we present results of our studying of famous very young pair of\nasteroids 6070 Rheinland and 54827 (2001 NQ8). We have done numeric integration\nof orbits of pair with only planet perturbations and include Ceres and Vesta\neffect. We have confirmed results of previous studying, obtained with different\nintegrators. And we confirm significant effect of Ceres and Vesta perturbation\non dynamic of this pair. We find that effect of other massive asteroids is\ninsignificant. According our results, more probable age of 6070 Rheinland and\n54827 (2001 NQ8) pair is 16.2 kyrs. Our value of age is very close to most\nrecent age determination by Vokrouhlicky et al [12], obtained with different\nmethod. After the compare our results, we can conclude, that non-gravitational\nforces are small and large number of clones is not necessary in studying of\nthis pair. As an additional way of studying of close orbits dynamics, we\ncalculate relative velocity in pair during numeric integration. Normal\ncomponent of velocity show a very good convergence at epoch of closest\nencounter in pair.\n", "  I discuss the recent claims made by Mario Bunge on the philosophical\nimplications of the discovery of gravitational waves. I think that Bunge is\nright when he points out that the detection implies the materiality of\nspacetime, but I reject his identification of spacetime with the gravitational\nfield. I show that Bunge's analysis of the spacetime inside a hollow sphere is\ndefective, but this in no way affects his main claim.\n", "  I present an accurate and efficient technique for numerical evaluation of\nsingular 6-dimensional integrals over tetrahedon-product domains, with\napplications to calculation of Galerkin matrix elements for discretized\nvolume-integral-equation (VIE) solvers using Schaubert-Wilton-Glisson (SWG) and\nother tetrahedral basis functions. My method extends the generalized\nTaylor-Duffy strategy---used to handle the singular \\textit{triangle}-product\nintegrals arising in discretized surface-integral-equation (SIE)\nformulations---to the tetrahedron-product case; it effects an exact\ntransformation of a singular 6-dimensional integral to an nonsingular\nlower-dimensional integral that may be evaluated by simple numerical cubature\nThe method is highly general and may---with the aid of automatic code\ngeneration facilitated by computer-algebra systems---be applied to a wide\nvariety of singular integrals arising in various VIE formulations with various\ntypes of tetrahedral basis function, of which I present several examples. To\ndemonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of my method, I apply it to the\ncalculation of matrix elements for the volume electric-field integral equation\n(VEFIE) discretized with SWG basis functions, where the method yields 12-digit\nor higher accuracy with low computational cost---an improvement of many orders\nof magnitude compared to existing techniques.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a novel - physico-chemical - approach for\ncalibration of a digital camera chip. This approach utilizes results of\nmeasurement of incident light spectra of calibration films of different levels\nof gray for construction of calibration curve (number of incident photons vs.\nimage pixel intensity) for each camera pixel. We show spectral characteristics\nof such corrected digital raw image files (a primary camera signal) and\ndemonstrate their suitability for next image processing and analysis.\n", "  We introduce the ongoing MaStar project, which is going to construct a large,\nwell-calibrated, high quality empirical stellar library with more than 8000\nstars covering the wavelength range from 3622 to 10,354A at a resolution of\nR~2000, and with better than 3% relative flux calibration. The spectra are\ntaken using hexagonal fiber bundles feeding the BOSS spectrographs on the 2.5m\nSloan Foundation Telescope, by piggybacking on the SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2\nobservations. Compared to previous efforts of empirical libraries, the MaStar\nLibrary will have a more comprehensive stellar parameter coverage, especially\nin cool dwarfs, low metallicity stars, and stars with different [alpha/Fe].\nThis is achieved by a target selection method based on large spectroscopic\ncatalogs from APOGEE, LAMOST, and SEGUE, combined with photometric selection.\nThis empirical library will provide a new basis for calibrating theoretical\nspectral libraries and for stellar population synthesis. In addition, with\nidentical spectral coverage and resolution to the ongoing integral field\nspectroscopy survey of nearby galaxies --- SDSS-IV/MaNGA (Mapping Nearby\nGalaxies at APO). This library is ideal for spectral modeling and stellar\npopulation analysis of MaNGA data.\n", "  Though structured illumination (SI) microscopy is a popular imaging technique\nconventionally associated with fluorescent super-resolution, recent works have\nsuggested its applicability towards sub-diffraction coherent imaging with\nquantitative endogenous biological contrast. Here, we demonstrate that SI can\nefficiently integrate the principles of fluorescent super-resolution and\ncoherent synthetic aperture to achieve 3D dual-modality sub-diffraction\nresolution, fluorescence and refractive-index (RI) visualizations of biological\nsamples. Such a demonstration can enable future biological studies to\nsynergistically explore molecular and biophysical/biochemical mechanisms at\nsub-diffraction resolutions. We experimentally demonstrate this framework by\nintroducing a SI microscope capable of 3D sub-diffraction fluorescence and RI\nimaging, and verify its biological visualization capabilities by experimentally\nreconstructing 3D RI/fluorescence visualizations of fluorescent calibration\nmicrospheres as well as alveolar basal epithelial adenocarcinoma (A549) and\nhuman colorectal adenocarcinmoa (HT-29) cells, fluorescently stained for\nF-actin.\n", "  Tearing modes with real frequencies in the plasma frame (i.e. in addition to\nthe Doppler shift due to $E\\times B$ rotation) are of potential importance\nbecause of their effect on the locking process. In particular, it has recently\nbeen shown [J. M. Finn, A. J. Cole, and D. P. Brennan, Phys. Plasmas (Letters),\n22:120701, 2015] that the Maxwell torque on the plasma in the presence of an\napplied error field is modified significantly for tearing modes having real\nfrequencies near marginal stability. In addition, it is known [J. M. Finn and\nR. A. Gerwin, Phys. Plasmas, 3:2344, 1996] that resistive wall tearing modes\ncan be destabilized below their no-wall limits by rotation, if the tearing\nmodes have real frequencies near marginal stability. In this paper we first\nderive the tearing mode dispersion relation with pressure gradient, field line\ncurvature and parallel dynamics in the resistive-inertial (RI) regime,\nneglecting the divergence of the $E\\times B$ drift and perpendicular\nresistivity. The results show that the usual Glasser effect, a toroidal effect\nwhich involves real frequencies, occurs in this simplified model, which ignores\nperpendicular resistivity and the divergence of the $E\\times B$ drift. We also\nfind, using a similar simple model, the surprising result that in the\nviscoresistive regime with pressure gradient, favorable curvature due to\ntoroidal effects, and parallel dynamics, a similar Glasser-like effect is\nfound. We show that in both regimes the existence of tearing modes with complex\nfrequencies is related to nearby electrostatic resistive interchange modes with\ncomplex frequencies. We discuss the effect on locking to an error field and the\nsignificant lowering of the threshold for destabilization of resistive wall\ntearing modes, which can be much more pronounced than the weak effect observed\nfor RI tearing modes without pressure-curvature drive in Finn and Gerwin, 1996.\n", "  Understanding the structural properties of random packings of jammed colloids\nrequires an unprecedented high-resolution determination of the contact network\nproviding mechanical stability to the packing. Here, we address the\ndetermination of the contact network by a novel strategy based on fluorophore\nsignal exclusion of quantum dot nanoparticles from the contact points. We use\nfluorescence labeling schemes on particles inspired by biology and biointerface\nscience in conjunction with fluorophore exclusion at the contact region. The\nmethod provides high-resolution contact network data that allows us to measure\nstructural properties of the colloidal packing near marginal stability. We\ndetermine scaling laws of force distributions, soft modes, correlation\nfunctions, coordination number and free volume that define the universality\nclass of jammed colloidal packings and can be compared with theoretical\npredictions. The contact detection method opens up further experimental testing\nat the interface of jamming and glass physics.\n", "  The realization of multimessenger astrophysics will open new vistas upon the\nmost energetic events in the universe. Messenger particles of all four of\nnature's fundamental forces, recorded by detectors on the ground and satellites\nin space, enable coincidence searches for multimessenger phenomena that will\nallow us to discover, observe, and explore these sources. The Astrophysical\nMultimessenger Observatory Network (AMON) links multiple high-energy neutrino,\ncosmic ray, and gamma-ray observatories as well as gravitational wave\nfacilities into a single virtual system, enabling near real-time coincidence\nsearches for multimessenger astrophysical transients and their electromagnetic\ncounterparts, and providing alerts to follow-up observatories. The science\ncase, design elements, partner observatories, and status of the AMON project\nare presented, followed by recent results from AMON real-time and archival\nanalyses.\n", "  Using a model spectral function of the electron the Hall conductivity in the\nnormal metallic state of the Pr_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_4 (PCCO) superconductor is\ncalculated neglecting the current vertex-correction. The result is\nqualitatively consistent with the experiment. Consequently the reason becomes\nclear why the Fermi-liquid theory fails to explain the anomaly of the Hall\nconductivity. The inconsistency of the fluctuation-exchange approximation also\nbecomes clear.\n", "  Hydrogen bond networks play vital roles in biological functions ranging from\nprotein folding to enzyme catalysis. Here we combine electronic structure\ncalculations and ab initio path integral molecular dynamics simulations, which\nincorporate both nuclear and electronic quantum effects, to show why the\nnetwork of short hydrogen bonds in the active site of ketosteroid isomerase is\nremarkably robust to mutations along the network and how this gives rise to\nlarge local electric fields. We demonstrate that these properties arise from\nthe network's ability to respond to a perturbation by shifting proton positions\nand redistributing electronic charge density. This flexibility leads to small\nchanges in properties such as the partial ionization of residues and $pK_a$\nisotope effects upon mutation of the residues, consistent with recent\nexperiments. This proton flexibility is further enhanced when an extended\nhydrogen bond network forms in the presence of an intermediate analog, which\nallows us to explain the chemical origins of the large electric fields in the\nenzyme's active site observed in recent experiments.\n", "  We describe studies on the nanoscale transport dynamics of carriers in\nstrained AlN/GaN/AlN quantum wells: an electron-hole bilayer charge system with\nlarge difference in transport properties between the two charge layers. From\nelectronic band diagram analysis, the presence of spatially separated\ntwo-dimensional electron and hole charge layers is predicted at opposite\ninterfaces. Since these charge layers exhibit distinct spectral signatures at\nterahertz frequencies, a combination of terahertz and far-infrared spectroscopy\nenables us to extract (a) individual contributions to the total conductivity,\nas well as (b) effective scattering rates for charge-carriers in each layer.\nFurthermore, by comparing direct-current and terahertz extracted conductivity\nlevels, we are able to determine the extent to which structural defects affect\ncharge transport. Our results evidence that (i) a non-unity Hall-factor and\n(ii) the considerable contribution of holes to the overall conductivity, lead\nto a lower apparent mobility in Hall-effect measurements. Overall, our work\ndemonstrates that terahertz spectroscopy is a suitable technique for the study\nof bilayer charge systems with large differences in transport properties\nbetween layers, such as quantum wells in III-Nitride semiconductors.\n", "  The behavior of a massive charged test Dirac field in the background of a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole is investigated. Especially, we obtain the\nfrequencies of quasibound states by solving the Dirac equation numerically both\nin time and frequency domain. Our results suggest that although the absence of\nsuperradiance excludes the existence of stationary solutions for massive Dirac\nfields, it is still possible to find arbitrarily long-lived solutions.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors isoelectronic to phosphorene has been\ndrawing much attention recently due to their promising applications for\nnext-generation (opt)electronics. This family of 2D materials contains more\nthan 400 members, including (a) elemental group-V materials, (b) binary III-VII\nand IV-VI compounds, (c) ternary III-VI-VII and IV-V-VII compounds, making\nmaterials design with targeted functionality unprecedentedly rich and extremely\nchallenging. To shed light on rational functionality design with this family of\nmaterials, we systemically explore their fundamental band gaps and alignments\nusing hybrid density functional theory (DFT) in combination with machine\nlearning. First, GGA-PBE and HSE calculations are performed as a reference. We\nfind this family of materials share similar crystalline structures, but possess\nlargely distributed band-gap values ranging approximately from 0 to 8 eV. Then,\nwe apply machine learning methods, including Linear Regression (LR), Random\nForest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), to build\nmodels for prediction of electronic properties. Among these models, SVR is\nfound to have the best performance, yielding the root mean square error (RMSE)\nless than 0.15 eV for predicted band gaps, VBMs, and CBMs when both PBE results\nand elemental information are used as features. Thus, we demonstrate machine\nlearning models are universally suitable for screening 2D isoelectronic systems\nwith targeted functionality and especially valuable for the design of alloys\nand heterogeneous systems.\n", "  We construct an effective commutative Schr\\\"odinger equation in Moyal\nspace-time in $(1+1)$-dimension where both $t$ and $x$ are operator-valued and\nsatisfy $\\left[ \\hat{t}, \\hat{x} \\right] = i \\theta$. Beginning with a\ntime-reparametrised form of an action we identify the actions of various\nspace-time coordinates and their conjugate momenta on quantum states,\nrepresented by Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Since time is also regarded as a\nconfiguration space variable, we show how an `induced' inner product can be\nextracted, so that an appropriate quantum mechanical interpretation is\nobtained. We then discuss several other applications of the formalism developed\nso far.\n", "  We present a simple closed expression for determining the condition for\nCoherent Perfect Absorption derived through electromagnetic wave treatment and\ninterface boundary conditions. Apart from providing physical insight this\nexpression can be used to estimate the values of various parameters required\nfor observation of coherent perfect absorption in a given medium characterized\nby a complex dielectric constant. The results of the theoretical expression are\nfound to be in good agreement with those obtained through numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  We present new viscosity measurements of a synthetic silicate system\nconsidered an analogue for the lava erupted on the surface of Mercury. In\nparticular, we focus on the northern volcanic plains (NVP), which correspond to\nthe largest lava flows on Mercury and possibly in the Solar System.\nHigh-temperature viscosity measurements were performed at both superliquidus\n(up to 1736 K) and subliquidus conditions (1569-1502 K) to constrain the\nviscosity variations as a function of crystallinity (from 0 to 28\\%) and shear\nrate (from 0.1 to 5 s 1). Melt viscosity shows moderate variations (4-16 Pa s)\nin the temperature range of 1736-1600 K. Experiments performed below the\nliquidus temperature show an increase in viscosity as shear rate decreases from\n5 to 0.1 s 1, resulting in a shear thinning behavior, with a decrease in\nviscosity of 1 log unit. The low viscosity of the studied composition may\nexplain the ability of NVP lavas to cover long distances, on the order of\nhundreds of kilometers in a turbulent flow regime. Using our experimental data\nwe estimate that lava flows with thickness of 1, 5, and 10 m are likely to have\nvelocities of 4.8, 6.5, and 7.2 m/s, respectively, on a 5 degree ground slope.\nNumerical modeling incorporating both the heat loss of the lavas and its\npossible crystallization during emplacement allows us to infer that high\neffusion rates (>10,000 m3/s) are necessary to cover the large distances\nindicated by satellite data from the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment,\nGEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft.\n", "  We used data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope obtained during the last 7\nyears and spanning two passages of $\\eta$ Carinae at periastron and compared\nthem with the predictions of particle acceleration in hydrodynamic simulations.\nTwo emission components can be distinguished. The low-energy component cuts off\nbelow 10 GeV and its flux, modulated by the orbital motion, varies by a factor\nless than 2. Short-term variability occurs at periastron. The flux of the high\nenergy component varies by a factor 3-4 but differently during the two\nperiastrons. The variabilities observed at low-energy, including some details\nof them, and these observed at high-energy during the first half of the\nobservations, do match the prediction of the simulation, assuming a surface\nmagnetic field in the range 0.4-1 kG. The high-energy component and the thermal\nX-ray emission were weaker than expected around the second periastron\nsuggesting a modification of the wind density in the inner wind collision zone.\nDiffuse shock acceleration in the complex geometry of the wind collision zone\nof $\\eta$ Carinae provides a convincing match to the observations and new\ndiagnostic tools to probe the geometry and energetics of the system.\n", "  During reactive transport modeling, the computational cost associated with\nchemical reaction calculations is often 10-100 times higher than that of\ntransport calculations. Most of these costs results from chemical equilibrium\ncalculations that are performed at least once in every mesh cell and at every\ntime step of the simulation. Calculating chemical equilibrium is an iterative\nprocess, where each iteration is in general so computationally expensive that\neven if every calculation converged in a single iteration, the resulting\nspeedup would not be significant. Thus, rather than proposing a fast-converging\nnumerical method for solving chemical equilibrium equations, we present a\nmachine learning method that enables new equilibrium states to be quickly and\naccurately estimated, whenever a previous equilibrium calculation with similar\ninput conditions has been performed. We demonstrate the use of this smart\nchemical equilibrium method in a reactive transport modeling example and show\nthat, even at early simulation times, the majority of all equilibrium\ncalculations are quickly predicted and, after some time steps, the\nmachine-learning-accelerated chemical solver has been fully trained to rapidly\nperform all subsequent equilibrium calculations, resulting in speedups of\nalmost two orders of magnitude. We remark that our new on-demand machine\nlearning method can be applied to any case in which a massive number of\nsequential/parallel evaluations of a computationally expensive function $f$\nneeds to be done, $y=f(x)$. We remark, that, in contrast to traditional machine\nlearning algorithms, our on-demand training approach does not require a\nstatistics-based training phase before the actual simulation of interest\ncommences. The introduced on-demand training scheme requires, however, the\nfirst-order derivatives $\\partial f/\\partial x$ for later smart predictions.\n", "  Recently, the energy determination of extensive air showers using radio\nemission has been shown to be both precise and accurate. In particular, radio\ndetection offers the opportunity for an independent measurement of the absolute\nenergy of cosmic rays, since the radiation energy (the energy radiated in the\nform of radio signals) can be predicted using first-principle calculations\ninvolving no free parameters, and the measurement of radio waves is not subject\nto any significant absorption or scattering in the atmosphere. Here, we verify\nthe implementation of radiation-energy calculations from microscopic simulation\ncodes by comparing Monte Carlo simulations made with the two codes CoREAS and\nZHAireS. To isolate potential differences in the radio-emission calculation\nfrom differences in the air-shower simulation, the simulations are performed\nwith equivalent settings, especially the same model for the hadronic\ninteractions and the description of the atmosphere. Comparing a large set of\nsimulations with different primary energies and shower directions we observe\ndifferences amounting to a total of only 3.3 %. This corresponds to an\nuncertainty of only 1.6 % in the determination of the absolute energy scale and\nthus opens the potential of using the radiation energy as an accurate\ncalibration method for cosmic ray experiments.\n", "  Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized using a co-precipitation\napproach. Co:Fe precursor ratio is varied over a certain window (1.05 to 1.2).\nIt is observed that the 1.15:2 precursor ratio gives better phase control but\npoor coercivity. On the other hand, 1.05:2 precursor ratio results in\nsubstantially better coercivity values (274kA/m; almost 300% the value reported\nfor co-precipitated cobalt ferrite by Praveena et al.), but moderate BH product\nmaximum (2.25 kJ/m3; ~ comparable to many reports on cobalt ferrite\nnanoparticles so far). The nanoparticles with best coercivity are annealed at\n873K for varying durations (2, 4, 6, 12 hrs). It is observed that the\ncoercivity drops drastically (almost by 80%) after annealing for 2 hours.\nHowever thereafter coercivity and saturation magnetization improves marginally\nwith increasing duration of annealing. These studies, along with\nthermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopic results indicate that a\nhydroxide nanophase based flux pinning mechanism at the grain boundary plays an\nimportant role in explaining the observed magnetic property trends. It is\nbelieved that this result will be generically helpful in developing soft\nchemically derived ferrites with higher coercivity and moderate (BH)max.\nHowever to develop plausible applications using the reported ferrites that use\nnanophase flux pinning, soft materials and device processing methods will need\nto be explored.\n", "  Recent observations of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission by the\nFermi-LAT satellite have shown significant deviations from models which assume\nthe same diffusion properties for cosmic rays (CR) throughout the Galaxy. We\nexplore the possibility that a fraction of this diffuse Galactic emission could\nbe due to hadronic interactions of CRs self-confined in the region around their\nsources. In fact, freshly accelerated CRs that diffuse away from the\nacceleration region can trigger the streaming instability able to amplify\nmagnetic disturbance and to reduce the particle diffusion. When this happen,\nCRs are trapped in the near source region for a time longer than expected and\nan extended gamma-ray halo is produces around each source. Here we calculate\nthe contribution to the diffuse gamma-ray background due to the overlap along\nlines of sight of several of these extended halos. We find that if the density\nof neutrals is low, the halos can account for a substantial fraction of the\ndiffuse emission observed by Fermi-LAT, depending on the orientation of the\nline of sight with respect to the direction of the galactic center.\n", "  Tomograms and quasi-distribution functions like Wigner, Glauber - Sudarshan\n$P$- and Husimi $Q$- functions that violate the standard normalization\ncondition are considered. Conditions under which a reconstruction of the\ndensity matrix using these tomograms and quasi-distribution functions is\npossible are obtained. Three different examples of states like the de Broglie\nplane wave, the Moschinsky shutter problem and the stationary state of the\ncharged particle in the uniform and constant electric field are studied. Their\ntomograms and quasi-distribution functions expressed in terms of the Dirac\ndelta function, the Airy function and the Fresnel integrals are shown to\nviolate the standard normalization condition and thus the density matrix of the\nstate can not always be reconstructed.\n", "  Implantation and diffusion of Zn dopant into bulk InP:S were performed. Zn\nconcentration profiles were investigated by secondary ion mass spectrometry and\ncapacitance-voltage method. We find that thermodynamic conditions of annealing\ninfluence diffusion mechanism of Zn atoms. Excess phosphorus vacancies\ngeneration causes diffusion of Zn dopant by the complex [V_{P}-Zn_{In}-V_{P}]\nproducing characteristic diffusion profile with the sharp slope. Such\nelectrically inactive Zn configuration cause lower diffusion coefficient than\nthat in the generally known interstitial-substitutional mechanism.\n", "  In this paper, we prove theoretically that both the stimulated Stokes\nscattering and its reverse process can occur simultaneously for the light and\nacoustic waves at different points of the medium, resulting in transient and\nalternate energy flow between the pump and Stokes waves in the stimulated\nBrillouin scattering. Furthermore, it is found that stimulated Stokes\nscattering and its reverse process will dominate alternately on the whole\nduring the three-wave coupling, but the eventual net energy flow must be from\nthe pump wave to the Stokes wave as a result of the finite lifetime of\nacoustical phonons. It is also deduced that direction of energy flow between\nthe pump and Stokes waves will turn to the opposite side once any one of the\nthree waves experiences a ${\\pi}$-phase shift. Consequently, we present that\ntransient energy convection between the pump and Stokes waves can give rise to\noptical wave splitting for the output pump and Stokes pulses, and is also\nresponsible for the generation of Brillouin solitons because energy reflux can\nprovide additional dissipation for the Stokes and acoustic waves to achieve the\ngain-loss balance.\n", "  Topological materials have attracted considerable experimental and\ntheoretical attention. They exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling both in the band\nstructure (intrinsic) and in the impurity potentials (extrinsic), although the\nlatter is often neglected. Here we discuss weak localization and\nantilocalization of massless Dirac fermions in topological insulators and\nmassive Dirac fermions in Weyl semimetal thin films taking into account both\nintrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit interactions. The physics is governed by the\ncomplex interplay of the chiral spin texture, quasiparticle mass, and scalar\nand spin-orbit scattering. We demonstrate that terms linear in the extrinsic\nspin-orbit scattering are generally present in the Bloch and momentum\nrelaxation times in all topological materials, and the correction to the\ndiffusion constant is linear in the strength of the extrinsic spin-orbit. In\nTIs, which have zero quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity\nspin-orbit coupling lead to an observable density dependence in the weak\nantilocalization correction. They produce substantial qualitative modifications\nto the magnetoconductivity, differing greatly from the conventional HLN formula\ntraditionally used in experimental fits, which predicts a crossover from weak\nlocalization to antilocalization as a function of the extrinsic spin-orbit\nstrength. In contrast, our analysis reveals that topological insulators always\nexhibit weak antilocalization. In WSM thin films having intermediate to large\nvalues of the quasiparticle mass extrinsic spin-orbit scattering strongly\naffects the boundary of the weak localization to antilocalization transition.\nWe produce a complete phase diagram for this transition as a function of the\nmass and spin-orbit scattering strength. We discuss implications for\nexperiments and provide a brief comparison with transition metal\ndichalcogenides.\n", "  By making use of circularly polarized light and electrostatic gating,\nmonolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS$_2$) can form a platform supporting\nmultiple types of charge carriers. They can be discriminated by their spin,\nvalley index or whether they're electrons or holes. We investigate the\ncollective properties of those charge carriers and are able to identify new\ndistinct plasmon modes. We analyze the corresponding dispersion relation,\nlifetime and oscillator strength, and calculate the phase relation between the\noscillations in the different components of the plasmon modes. All platforms in\nML-MoS$_2$ support a long-wavelength $\\sqrt{q}$ plasmon branch at zero Kelvin.\nIn addition to this, for an $n$-component system, $n-1$ distinct plasmon modes\nappear as acoustic modes with linear dispersion in the long-wavelength limit.\nThese modes correspond to out-of-phase oscillations in the different Fermion\nliquids and have, although being damped, a relatively long lifetime.\nAdditionally, we also find new distinct modes at large wave vector that are\nstronger damped by intra-band processes.\n", "  Despite decades of observations across all wavebands and dedicated\ntheoretical modelling, the SS 433 system still poses many questions, especially\nin the high-energy range. SS 433 is a high-mass X-ray binary at a distance of\n$\\sim 5.5$ kpc, with a stellar mass black hole in a $13$ day orbit around a\nsupergiant $\\sim$A7Ib star. SS 433 is unusual because it contains dual\nrelativistic jets with evidence of high-energy hadronic particles. X-ray\nemission is seen from the central source as well as the jet termination\nregions, where the eastern and western jets interact with the surrounding\ninterstellar medium. Very-high-energy gamma-ray emission is predicted both from\nthe central source and multiple smaller regions in the jets. This emission\ncould be detectable by current generation imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov\ntelescopes like VERITAS. VERITAS has observed the extended region around SS 433\nfor $\\sim 70$ hours during 2009-2012. No significant emission was detected\neither from the location of the black hole or the jet termination regions. We\nreport 99\\% confidence level flux upper limits above 600 GeV for these regions\nin the range $(1-10) \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{cm^{-2} \\ s^{-1}}$. A phase\nresolved analysis also does not reveal any significant emission from the\nextended SS 433 region.\n", "  We study collective modes in a classical system of particles with repulsive\ninverse-power-law (IPL) interactions in the fluid phase, near the fluid-solid\ncoexistence (IPL melts). The IPL exponent is varied from $n=10$ to $n=100$ to\nmimic the transition from moderately soft to hard-sphere-like interactions. We\ncompare the longitudinal dispersion relations obtained using molecular dynamic\n(MD) simulations with those calculated using the quasi-crystalline\napproximation (QCA) and find that this simple theoretical approach becomes\ngrossly inaccurate for $n\\gtrsim 20$. Similarly, conventional expressions for\nhigh-frequency (instantaneous) elastic moduli, predicting their divergence as\n$n$ increases, are meaningless in this regime. Relations of the longitudinal\nand transverse elastic velocities of the QCA model to the adiabatic sound\nvelocity, measured in MD simulations, are discussed for the regime where QCA is\napplicable. Two potentially useful freezing indicators for classical particle\nsystems with steep repulsive interactions are discussed.\n", "  We discuss the Hirota bilinear equation for the CKP hierarchy introduced by\nDate, Jimbo, Kashiwara and Miwa in J. Phys. Soc. Japan. 50(11), 3813-3818\n(1981), and its algebraic properties. We review in parallel the two\nbosonizations of the CKP hierarchy: one arising from a twisted Heisenberg\nalgebra (van de Leur, Orlov and Shiota, SIGMA 8, 28 (2012)), and the second\nfrom an untwisted Heisenberg algebra (Anguelova, J. Math. Phys. 58(7), 071707\n(2017)). In particular, we recount the decompositions into irreducible\nHeisenberg modules and the (twisted) fermionic structures of the spaces spanned\nby the highest weight vectors under the two Heisenberg actions. We show that\nthe two bosonizations give rise to four different diagonalizable grading\noperators on the CKP Fock space, not all of them commuting among each other. We\ncompute the various graded dimensions related to these four grading operators.\nWe prove a sum-vs-product identity relating the bosonic vs fermionic\ndescriptions under the untwisted Heisenberg action, utilizing the charge and\nthe degree grading operators. As a corollary, the resulting identities relate\nthe CKP hierarchy, the Dyson crank of a partition and the Hammond-Lewis birank\nof a distinct integer bipartition.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the behavior of the shear hydrodynamic response\nfunctions in a simple holographic model exhibiting momentum relaxation. We\ncompute several stress tensor response functions in the transverse channel, and\nfrom there derive the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density, $\\eta/s$,\nusing two different methods. The two values differ from each other, one which\nsatisfies the KSS bound $\\eta/s \\geq \\frac{1}{4\\pi}$ and one which does not,\nand we discuss the causes and implications of this result.\n", "  We present the Focus-Induced Photoresponse (FIP) technique, a novel approach\nto optical distance measurement. It takes advantage of a widely-observed\nphenomenon in photodetector devices: a nonlinear, irradiance-dependent\nphotoresponse. This means that the output from a sensor is dependent on the\ntotal number of photons incident and the size of the area in which they fall.\nWith a certain arrangement of sensor and lens, this phenomenon will cause the\noutput of the sensor to change based on how far in or out of focus an object\nis. We call this the FIP effect. Here we demonstrate how to use the FIP effect\nfor distance measurements. We show that this technique works with different\nsensor materials, device types, as well as visible and near infrared light. In\nprinciple, any sensor exhibiting a photoresponse that depends nonlinearly on\nirradiance could be used with the FIP technique. It is our belief that the FIP\ntechnique can become an important method for measuring distance.\n", "  The more than thirty years old issue of the (classical) information capacity\nof quantum communication channels was dramatically clarified during the last\nyears, when a number of direct quantum coding theorems was discovered. The\npresent paper gives a self contained treatment of the subject, following as\nmuch in parallel as possible with classical information theory and, on the\nother side, stressing profound differences of the quantum case. An emphasis is\nmade on recent results, such as general quantum coding theorems including cases\nof infinite (possibly continuous) alphabets and constrained inputs, reliability\nfunction for pure state channels and quantum Gaussian channel. Several still\nunsolved problems are briefly outlined.\n"]}
