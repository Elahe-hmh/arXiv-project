The spin relaxation time $\\tau_s$ scales inversely with the\nmobility $\\mu$ of BLG samples both at room temperature and at low temperature.\nThis indicates the importance of D'yakonov - Perel' spin scattering in BLG.\nSpin relaxation times of up to 2 ns are observed in samples with the lowest\nmobility. These times are an order of magnitude longer than any values\npreviously reported for single layer graphene (SLG). We discuss the role of\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors that could lead to the dominance of\nD'yakonov-Perel' spin scattering in BLG. In comparison to SLG, significant\nchanges in the density dependence of $\\tau_s$ are observed as a function of\ntemperature.\n", "  We demonstrate injection, transport and detection of spins in spin valve\narrays patterned in both copper based chemical vapor deposition (Cu-CVD)\nsynthesized wafer scale single layer (SLG) and bilayer graphene (BLG). We\nobserve spin relaxation times comparable to those reported for exfoliated\ngraphene samples demonstrating that CVD specific structural differences such as\nnano-ripples and grain boundaries do not limit spin transport in the present\nsamples. Our observations make Cu-CVD graphene a promising material of choice\nfor large scale spintronic applications.\n", "  Confocal Raman spectroscopy is a versatile, non-invasive investigation tool\nand a major workhorse for graphene characterization. Here we show that the\nexperimentally observed Raman 2D line width is a measure of nanometer-scale\nstrain variations in graphene. By investigating the relation between the G and\n2D line at high magnetic fields we find that the 2D line width contains\nvaluable information on nanometer-scale flatness and lattice deformations of\ngraphene, making it a good quantity for classifying the structural quality of\ngraphene even at zero magnetic field.\n", "  We provide the proper definition of all the leading-twist (un)polarized gluon\ntransverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs), by\nconsidering the Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution in hadron-hadron\ncollisions and deriving the factorization theorem in terms of them. We show\nthat the evolution of all the (un)polarized gluon TMDPDFs is driven by a\nuniversal evolution kernel, which can be resummed up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Considering the proper definition\nof gluon TMDPDFs, we perform an explicit next-to-leading-order calculation of\nthe unpolarized ($f_1^g$), linearly polarized ($h_1^{\\perp g}$) and helicity\n($g_{1L}^g$) gluon TMDPDFs, and show that, as expected, they are free from\nrapidity divergences. As a byproduct, we obtain the Wilson coefficients of the\nrefactorization of these TMDPDFs at large transverse momentum. In particular,\nthe coefficient of $g_{1L}^g$, which has never been calculated before,\nconstitutes a new and necessary ingredient for a reliable phenomenological\nextraction of this quantity, for instance at RHIC or the future AFTER@LHC or\nElectron-Ion Collider. The coefficients of $f_1^g$ and $h_1^{\\perp g}$ have\nnever been calculated in the present formalism, although they could be obtained\nby carefully collecting and recasting previous results in the new TMD\nformalism. We apply these results to analyze the contribution of linearly\npolarized gluons at different scales, relevant, for instance, for the inclusive\nproduction of the Higgs boson and the $C$-even pseudoscalar bottomonium state\n$\\eta_{b}$. Applying our resummation scheme we finally provide predictions for\nthe Higgs boson $q_T$-distribution at the LHC.\n", "  We present a temperature and magnetic field dependence study of spin\ntransport and magnetothermal corrections to the thermal conductivity in the\nspin S = 1/2 integrable easy-plane regime Heisenberg chain, extending an\nearlier analysis based on the Bethe ansatz method. We critically discuss the\nlow temperature, weak magnetic field behavior, the effect of magnetothermal\ncorrections in the vicinity of the critical field and their role in recent\nthermal conductivity experiments in 1D quantum magnets.\n", "  We propose a new quantization rule which generates Landau levels consistent\nwith the zero-field magnetic response functions from the semiclassical theory.\nIt reproduces the Onsager's rule in the leading order, and re-formulates\ncorrections from the Berry phase and magnetic moment effect in terms of one\nsingle magnetic response: the zero-field magnetization. It can yield higher\norder corrections by including successively magnetic susceptibility and higher\norder magnetic response functions. In application, it can be easily applied to\nobtain Landau levels in lattice models. Moreover, it provides an experimental\nmethod of measuring different magnetic response functions directly from the\nmeasurement of Landau level fan diagram or Hofstadter spectrum.\n", "  A simple model for image formation in linear shift-invariant systems is\nconsidered, in which both the detected signal and the noise variance are\nvarying slowly compared to the point-spread function of the system. It is shown\nthat within the constraints of this model, the square of the signal-to-noise\nratio is always proportional to the \"volume\" of the spatial resolution unit. In\nthe case of Poisson statistics, the ratio of these two quantities divided by\nthe incident density of the imaging particles (e.g. photons) represents a\ndimensionless invariant of the imaging system, which was previously termed the\nintrinsic imaging quality. The relationship of this invariant to the notion of\ninformation capacity of communication and imaging systems, which was previously\nconsidered by Shannon, Gabor and others, is investigated. The results are then\napplied to a simple generic model of quantitative imaging of weakly scattering\nobjects, leading to an estimate of the upper limit for the amount of\ninformation about the sample that can be obtained in such experiments. It is\nshown that this limit depends only on the total number of imaging particles\nincident on the sample, the average scattering coefficient, the size of the\nsample and the number of spatial resolution units.\n", "  We present a method to create and erase spatially resolved doping profiles in\ngraphene-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures. The technique is based\non photo-induced doping by a focused laser and does neither require masks nor\nphoto resists. This makes our technique interesting for rapid prototyping of\nunconventional electronic device schemes, where the spatial resolution of the\nrewritable, long-term stable doping profiles is only limited by the laser spot\nsize (~600 nm) and the accuracy of sample positioning. Our optical doping\nmethod offers a way to implement and to test different, complex doping patterns\nin one and the very same graphene device, which is not achievable with\nconventional gating techniques.\n", "  A light meta-stable dark photon decaying into collimated electron/positron\npair can fake a photon, either converted or unconverted, at the LHC. The\ndetailed object identification relies on the specifics of the detector and\nstrategies for the reconstruction. We study the fake rate based on the\nATLAS(CMS) detector geometry and show that it can be O(1) with a generic choice\nof parameters. Especially, the probability of being registered as a photon is\nangular dependent. Such detector effects can induce bias to measurements on\ncertain properties of new physics. In this paper, we consider the scenario\nwhere dark photons in final states are from a heavy resonance decay.\nConsequently, the detector effects can dramatically affect the results when\ndetermine the spin of a resonance. Further, if the decay products from the\nheavy resonance are one photon and one dark photon, which has a large\nprobability to fake a diphoton event, the resonance is allowed to be a vector.\nDue to the difference in detector, the cross sections measured in ATLAS and CMS\ndo not necessarily match. Furthermore, if the diphoton signal is given by the\ndark photons, the SM $Z\\gamma$ and $ZZ$ final states do not necessarily come\nwith the $\\gamma\\gamma$ channel, which is a unique signature in our scenario.\nThe issue studied here is relevant also for any future new physics searches\nwith photon(s) in the final state. We discuss possible ways of distinguishing\ndark photon decay and real photon in the future.\n", "  We introduce the two-parameter quantum affine algebra\n$U_{r,s}(\\widehat{gl}_n)$ via the RTT realization. The Drinfeld realization is\ngiven and the type A quantum affine algebra is proved to be a special\nsubalgebra of our extended algebra.\n", "  Carbon is one of the most investigated materials and shows chaotic behavior\nin terms of evolving structure. Synthesizing carbon materials largely depend on\nthe deposition technique, process parameters, condition of substrate surface\nand ratios of the gaseous chemistry. A variety of techniques have been employed\nto depositing carbon films from various gaseous mixtures to different substrate\nmaterials. In this study, carbon thin and thick films are discussed for\ndifferent techniques known as hot filament chemical vapor deposition and\nmicrowave plasma chemical vapor deposition where their synthesis process has\nbeen explained in a new context. Here, we discuss attained dynamics of atoms or\ntiny grains amalgamating into a particular phase of grain or crystallite and\nelectron-dynamics responsible for binding atoms in the formation of all sorts\nof tiny grains, grains and crystallites controlling overall\nmorphology-structure of films thickness at few nanometers to several microns.\nCarbon atoms when in solid state, on amalgamation at flat surface result into\nbind under uniform electron-dynamics and when the amalgamation is at uneven\nsurface, they result into bind under non-uniform electron-dynamics. Substrates\nunder appropriate surface defects or abrasion result into an improved rate of\nnucleation of tiny grains, hence, their increased rate of growth. This study\nembarks on unexplored science of carbon films where in addition to localized\nprocess parameters nature of substrate also influence dynamics of formation of\ntiny clusters, grains and crystallites at their initial stage of formation. Our\nresults and discussions enlighten us to revisit the nucleation and growth\nmechanisms of different sorts of films deposit at any scale and at any\nsubstrate surface constituting different composition.\n", "  We prove that the topological recursion reconstructs the WKB expansion of a\nquantum curve for all spectral curves whose Newton polygons have no interior\npoint (and that are smooth as affine curves). This includes nearly all\npreviously known cases in the literature, and many more; in particular, it\nincludes many quantum curves of order greater than two. We also explore the\nconnection between the choice of ordering in the quantization of the spectral\ncurve and the choice of integration divisor to reconstruct the WKB expansion.\n", "  An uncertainty inequality is presented that establishes a lower limit for the\nproduct of the variance of the time-averaged intensity of a mode of a quantized\nelectromagnetic field and the degree of its spatial localization. The lower\nlimit is determined by the vacuum fluctuations within the volume corresponding\nto the width of the mode. This result also leads to a generalized form of the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle for boson fields in which the lower limit for\nthe product of uncertainties in the spatial and momentum localization of a mode\nis equal to the product of Planck's constant and a dimensionless functional\nwhich reflects the joint signal-to-noise ratio of the position and momentum of\nvacuum fluctuations in the region of the phase space occupied by the mode.\nExperimental X-ray synchrotron measurements provide an initial verification of\nthe proposed theory in the case of Poisson statistics.\n", "  The Raman 2D line of graphene is widely used for device characterization and\nduring device fabrication as it contains valuable information on e.g. the\ndirection and magnitude of mechanical strain and doping. Here we present\nsystematic asymmetries in the 2D line shape of exfoliated graphene and graphene\ngrown by chemical vapor deposition. Both graphene crystals are fully\nencapsulated in van der Waals heterostructures, where hexagonal boron nitride\nand tungsten diselenide are used as substrate materials. In both material\nstacks, we find very low doping values and extremely homogeneous strain\ndistributions in the graphene crystal, which is a hall mark of the outstanding\nelectronic quality of these samples. By fitting double Lorentzian functions to\nthe spectra to account for the contributions of inner and outer processes to\nthe 2D peak, we find that the splitting of the sub-peaks, $6.6 \\pm 0.5$\ncm$^{-1}$(hBN-Gr-WSe2) and $8.9 \\pm 1.0$ cm$^{-1}$ (hBN-Gr-hBN), is\nsignificantly lower than the values reported in previous studies on suspended\ngraphene.\n", "  Ising model with competing nearest-neighbors and prolonged\nnext-nearest-neighbors interactions on a Cayley tree has long been studied but\nthere are still many problems untouched. This paper tackles new Gibbs measures\nof Ising-Vannimenus model with competing nearest-neighbors and prolonged\nnext-nearest-neighbors interactions on a Cayley tree (or Bethe lattice) of\norder three. By using a new approach, we describe the translation-invariant\nGibbs measures for the model. We show that some of the measures are extreme\nGibbs distributions. In this paper we take up with trying to determine when\nphase transition does occur.\n", "  The standard paradigm of collisionless cold dark matter is in tension with\nmeasurements on large scales. In particular, the best fit values of the Hubble\nrate $H_0$ and the matter density perturbation $\\sigma_8$ inferred from the\ncosmic microwave background seem inconsistent with the results from direct\nmeasurements. We show that both problems can be solved in a framework in which\ndark matter consists of two distinct components, a dominant component and a\nsubdominant component. The primary component is cold and collisionless. The\nsecondary component is also cold, but interacts strongly with dark radiation,\nwhich itself forms a tightly coupled fluid. The growth of density perturbations\nin the subdominant component is inhibited by dark acoustic oscillations due to\nits coupling to the dark radiation, solving the $\\sigma_8$ problem, while the\npresence of tightly coupled dark radiation ameliorates the $H_0$ problem. The\nsubdominant component of dark matter and dark radiation continue to remain in\nthermal equilibrium until late times, inhibiting the formation of a dark disk.\nWe present an example of a simple model that naturally realizes this scenario\nin which both constituents of dark matter are thermal WIMPs. Our scenario can\nbe tested by future stage-IV experiments designed to probe the CMB and large\nscale structure.\n", "  Coherent jets with most of the kinetic energy of the flow are common in\natmospheric turbulence. In the gaseous planets these jets are maintained by\nincoherent turbulence excited by small-scale convection. Large-scale coherent\nwaves are sometimes observed to coexist with the jets; a prominent example is\nSaturn's hexagonal North polar jet (NPJ). The mechanism responsible for forming\nand maintaining such a turbulent state remains elusive. The coherent\nplanetary-scale component of the turbulence arises and is maintained by\ninteraction with the incoherent small-scale turbulence component. Theoretical\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the jet/wave/turbulence coexistence regime is\ngained by employing a statistical state dynamics (SSD) model. Here, a\nsecond-order closure implementation of a two-layer beta-plane SSD is used to\ndevelop a theory that accounts for the structure and dynamics of the NPJ.\nAsymptotic analysis of the SSD equilibrium in the weak jet damping limit\npredicts a universal jet structure in agreement with NPJ observations. This\nasymptotic theory also predicts the wavenumber (six) of the prominent jet\nperturbation. Analysis with this model of the jet/wave/turbulence regime\ndynamics reveals that jet formation is controlled by the effective value of\n$\\beta$; the required value of this parameter for correspondence with\nobservation is obtained. As this is a robust prediction it is taken as an\nindirect observation of a deep poleward sloping stable layer beneath the NPJ.\nThe slope required is obtained from observations of NPJ structure as is the\nsmall-scale turbulence excitation required to maintain the jet. The observed\njet structure is then predicted by the theory as is the wave-six disturbance.\nThis wave, which is identified with the least stable mode of the equilibrated\njet, is shown to be primarily responsible for equilibrating the jet with the\nobserved structure and amplitude.\n", "  We consider deformations of a conformal field theory that explicitly break\nsome global symmetries of the theory. If the deformed theory is still a\nconformal field theory, one can exploit the constraints put by conformal\nsymmetry to compute broken currents anomalous dimensions. We consider several\ninstances of this scenario, using field theory techniques and also holographic\nones, where necessary. Field theoretical methods suffice to discuss examples of\nsymmetry-breaking deformations of the $O(N )$ model in $d=4-\\epsilon$\ndimensions. Holography is instrumental, instead, for computing current\nanomalous dimensions in $\\beta$-deformed superconformal field theories, and in\na class of supersymmetric RG flows at large $N$.\n", "  The genus-1 KP-Whitham system is derived for both variants of the\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation (namely, the KPI and KPII equations). The\nbasic properties of the KP-Whitham system, including symmetries, exact\nreductions, and its possible complete integrability, together with the\nappropriate generalization of the one-dimensional Riemann problem for the\nKorteweg-deVries equation are discussed. Finally, the KP-Whitham system is used\nto study the linear stability properties of the genus-1 solutions of the KPI\nand KPII equations; it is shown that all genus-1 solutions of KPI are linearly\nunstable while all genus-1 solutions of KPII {are linearly stable within the\ncontext of Whitham theory.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions also occur in non-Hermitian systems. In this work\nwe show that density functional theory, for the first time, uncovers universal\nbehaviors for phase transitions in non-Hermitian many-body systems. To be\nspecific, we first prove that the non-degenerate steady state of a\nnon-Hermitian quantum many-body system is a universal function of the first\nderivative of the steady state energy with respect to the control parameter.\nThis finding has far-reaching consequences for non-Hermitian systems: (i) It\nbridges the nonanalytic behavior in physical observable and nonanalytic\nbehavior of steady state energy, which explains why the quantum phase\ntransitions in non-Hermitian systems occur for finite systems. (ii) It predicts\nuniversal scaling behaviors of any physical observable at non-Hermitian phase\ntransition point with scaling exponent being\n$(1-1/p),2(1-1/p),\\cdots,n(1-1/p),\\cdots$ with $p$ being the number of\ncoalesced states at the exceptional point and $n$ being a positive integer.\n(iii). It reveals that quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian phase transition\npoint presents universal scaling behaviors with critical exponents being\n$(1-1/p),2(1-1/p),\\cdots,n(1-1/p),\\cdots$. These results uncover universal\ncritical behaviors in non-Hermitian phase transitions and provide profound\nconnections between entanglement and phase transition in non-Hermitian quantum\nmany-body physics and establish foundations for quantum metrology in\nnon-Hermitian systems.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are two-dimensional non-collinear spin textures\ncharacterised by an integer topological number. They commonly crystallise at\nlow temperatures in bulk noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets where the lack of\ninversion symmetry leads to an antisymmetric component of the exchange\ninteraction. Recently, stable room-temperature skyrmions were reported in\nstacks of thin magnetic films where antisymmetric exchange results from broken\nsymmetry at the interface. Determining the spin structure of these\ntechnologically-relevant skyrmions in the presence of external magnetic fields\nhas remained a key experimental challenge. Here, we use the single electron\nspin of a Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centre in diamond to perform scanning\nmagnetometry of skyrmions in Pt/Co/Ta multilayers under ambient conditions. We\nintroduce a novel method to assess the manifold of spin textures compatible\nwith the measured local magnetic fields and identify physically allowed\nconfigurations based on the topology of the resulting solution. We determine\nthat the underlying magnetization pattern for the skyrmion is consistent with a\ncycloid (or N\\'eel)-like spin texture, in agreement with theoretical\npredictions for interfacial antisymmetric exchange interaction. Our results\nopen up wide-ranging possibilities in quantitative model-free imaging of\ntwo-dimensional spin structures using scanning NV magnetometry.\n", "  Understanding the scattering mechanisms from the ground surface in the\npresence of different vegetation densities is necessary for the interpretation\nof P-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations and for the design of\ngeophysical retrieval algorithms. In this study, a quantitative analysis of\nvegetation and soil scattering mechanisms estimated from the observations of an\nairborne P-band SAR instrument across nine different biomes in North America is\npresented. The goal is to apply a hybrid (model- and eigen- based) three\ncomponent decomposition approach to separate the contributions of surface,\ndouble-bounce and vegetation volume scattering across a wide range of biome\nconditions. The decomposition makes no prior assumptions about vegetation\nstructure. We characterize the dynamics of the decomposition across different\nNorth American biomes and assess their characteristic range. Impacts of\nvegetation cover seasonality and soil surface roughness on the contributions of\neach scattering mechanism are also investigated. Observations used here are\npart of the NASA Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface\n(AirMOSS) mission and data have been collected between 2013 and 2015.\n", "  Expanding the frontiers of information processing technologies and, in\nparticular, computing with ever increasing speed and capacity has long been\nrecognized an important societal challenge, calling for the development of the\nnext generation of quantum technologies. With its potential to exponentially\nincrease computing power, quantum computing opens up possibilities to carry out\ncalculations that ordinary computers could not finish in the lifetime of the\nUniverse, while optical communications based on quantum cryptography become\ncompletely secure. At the same time, the emergence of Big Data and the ever\nincreasing demands of miniaturization and energy saving technologies bring\nabout additional fundamental problems and technological challenges to be\naddressed in scientific disciplines dealing with light-matter interactions. In\nthis context, quantum plasmonics represents one of the most promising and\nfundamental research directions and, indeed, the only one that enables ultimate\nminiaturization of photonic components for quantum optics when being taken to\nextreme limits in light-matter interactions.\n", "  Yang-Lee edge singularities are the branch point of the free energy on the\ncomplex plane of physical parameters and were shown to be the simplest\nuniversality class of phase transitions. However, the Yang-Lee edge\nsingularities have not been regarded as experimentally observable since they\noccur at complex physical parameters, which are unphysical. A recent discovery\nabout the relation between partition functions and probe spin coherence makes\nit experimentally feasible to access the complex plane of physical parameters.\nHowever, how to extract the critical point and the critical exponent of\nYang-Lee edge singularities in many-body systems, which occurs only at\nthermodynamic limit, has still been elusive. Here we show that the quantum\ncoherence of a probe spin coupled to finite-size Ising-type spin systems\npresents universal scaling behavior near the Yang-Lee edge singularity. The\nfinite-size scaling behavior of quantum coherence of the probe spin predicts\nthat one can extract the critical point and the critical exponent of the\nYang-Lee edge singularity of Ising-type spin system in the thermodynamic limit\nfrom the spin coherence measurement of the probe spin coupled to finite\nIsing-type spin systems. This finding provides a practical approach to studying\nthe nature of Yang-Lee edge singularities of many-body systems.\n", "  In this paper we consider torsion gravity in the case of the Dirac field, and\nby going into the rest frame we study what happens when a uniform precession as\nwell as a phase are taken into account for the spinor field; we discuss how\npartially conserved axial-vector currents and torsion-spin attractive\npotentials justify negative Takabayashi angle and energy smaller than mass:\nbecause in this instance the module goes to zero exponentially fast then we\nobtain stable and localized matter distributions suitable to be regarded as a\ndescription of particles.\n", "  We present a geometrical approach for studying dimers. We introduce a\nconnection for dimer problems on bipartite and non-bipartite graphs. In the\nbipartite case the connection is flat but has non-trivial ${\\bf Z}_2$ holonomy\nround certain curves. This holonomy has the universality property that it does\nnot change as the number of vertices in the fundamental domain of the graph is\nincreased. It is argued that the K-theory of the torus, with or without\npunctures, is the appropriate underlying invariant. In the non-bipartite case\nthe connection has non-zero curvature as well as non-zero Chern number. The\ncurvature does not require the introduction of a magnetic field. The phase\ndiagram of these models is captured by what is known as an amoeba. We introduce\na dimer model with negative edge weights that give rise to vortices. The\namoebae for various models are studied with particular emphasis on the case of\nnegative edge weights which corresponds to the presence of vortices. Vortices\ngives rise to new kinds of amoebae with certain singular structures which we\ninvestigate. On the amoeba of the vortex full hexagonal lattice we find the\npartition function corresponds to that of a massless Dirac doublet.\n", "  In this work the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation for a complex scalar field with\nU(1) symmetry endowed in a mexican-hat scalar field potential with thermal and\nelectromagnetic contributions is written as a Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)-like\nequation. This equation is interpreted as a charged generalization of the GP\nequation at finite temperatures found in previous works. Its hydrodynamical\nrepresentation is obtained and the corresponding thermodynamical properties are\nderived and related to measurable quantities. The condensation temperature in\nthe non-relativistic regime associated with the aforementioned system within\nthe semiclassical approximation is calculated. Also, a generalized equation for\nthe conservation of energy for a charged bosonic gas is found when\nelectromagnetic fields are introduced, and it is studied how under certain\ncircumstances its breaking of symmetry can give some insight on the phase\ntransition of the system not just into the condensed phase but also on other\nrelated systems.\n", "  We study and classify free actions of compact quantum groups on unital\nC*-algebras in terms of generalized factor systems. Moreover, we use these\nfactor systems to show that all finite coverings of irrational rotation\nC*-algebras are cleft.\n", "  We have studied disordering effects on the coefficients of Ginzburg - Landau\nexpansion in powers of superconducting order - parameter in attractive Anderson\n- Hubbard model within the generalized $DMFT+\\Sigma$ approximation. We consider\nthe wide region of attractive potentials $U$ from the weak coupling region,\nwhere superconductivity is described by BCS model, to the strong coupling\nregion, where superconducting transition is related with Bose - Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) of compact Cooper pairs formed at temperatures essentially\nlarger than the temperature of superconducting transition, and the wide range\nof disorder - from weak to strong, where the system is in the vicinity of\nAnderson transition. In case of semi - elliptic bare density of states disorder\ninfluence upon the coefficients $A$ and $B$ before the square and the fourth\npower of the order - parameter is universal for any value of electron\ncorrelation and is related only to the general disorder widening of the bare\nband (generalized Anderson theorem). Such universality is absent for the\ngradient term expansion coefficient $C$. In the usual theory of \"dirty\"\nsuperconductors the $C$ coefficient drops with the growth of disorder. In the\nlimit of strong disorder in BCS limit the coefficient $C$ is very sensitive to\nthe effects of Anderson localization, which lead to its further drop with\ndisorder growth up to the region of Anderson insulator. In the region of BCS -\nBEC crossover and in BEC limit the coefficient $C$ and all related physical\nproperties are weakly dependent on disorder. In particular, this leads to\nrelatively weak disorder dependence of both penetration depth and coherence\nlengths, as well as of related slope of the upper critical magnetic field at\nsuperconducting transition, in the region of very strong coupling.\n", "  It was recently shown that nonsymmorphic space group symmetries can protect\nnovel surface states with hourglass-like dispersions. In this paper, we show\nthat such dispersions can also appear in the bulk of three-dimensional (3D)\nsystems which respect nonsymmorphic symmetries. Specifically, we construct 3D\nlattice models featuring hourglass-like dispersions in the bulk, which are\nprotected by nonsymmorphic and time-reversal symmetries. We call such systems\nhourglass semimetals, as they have point or line nodes associated with\nhourglass-like dispersions. Hourglass nodal lines appear in glide-invariant\nplanes, while hourglass Weyl points can occur on screw-invariant axes. The Weyl\npoints and surface Fermi arcs in hourglass Weyl semimetals are stable against\nweak perturbations breaking those nonsymmorphic symmetries. Our results may\nshed light on searching for exotic Weyl semimetals in nonsymmorphic materials.\n", "  It is analyzed the effects of both bulk and shear viscosities on the\nperturbations, relevant for structure formation in late time cosmology. It is\nshown that shear viscosity can be as effective as the bulk viscosity on\nsuppressing the growth of perturbations and delaying the nonlinear regime. A\nstatistical analysis of the shear and bulk viscous effects is performed and\nsome constraints on these viscous effects are given.\n", "  We present the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to dynamical\nelectromagnetic fields, including the effects of polarization, electric fields,\nand the derivative expansion. We enumerate the transport coefficients at\nleading order in derivatives, including electrical conductivities, viscosities,\nand thermodynamic coefficients. We find the constraints on transport\ncoefficients due to the positivity of entropy production, and derive the\ncorresponding Kubo formulas. For the neutral state in a magnetic field, small\nfluctuations include Alfven waves, magnetosonic waves, and the dissipative\nmodes. For the state with a non-zero dynamical charge density in a magnetic\nfield, plasma oscillations gap out all propagating modes, except for\nAlfven-like waves with a quadratic dispersion relation. We relate the transport\ncoefficients in the \"conventional\" magnetohydrodynamics (formulated using\nMaxwell's equations in matter) to those in the \"dual\" version of\nmagnetohydrodynamics (formulated using the conserved magnetic flux).\n", "  We show that introducing subnucleon scale fluctuations constrained by HERA\ndiffractive $J/\\Psi$ production data significantly affects the incoherent\ndiffractive $J/\\Psi$ production cross section in ultraperipheral heavy ion\ncollisions. We find that the inclusion of the additional fluctuations increases\nthe ratio of the incoherent to the coherent cross section approximately by a\nfactor of $2$, and modifies the transverse momentum spectra of the produced\n$J/\\Psi$ at momenta larger than the scale that corresponds to the distance\nscale of the subnucleonic fluctuations. We present predictions for $J/\\Psi$\nproduction in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ at the LHC and $200\\,{\\rm GeV}$ at RHIC.\n", "  Previous studies have found our velocity in the rest frame of radio galaxies\nat high redshift to be substantially larger than that inferred from the CMB\ntemperature dipole anisotropy. We construct a full sky catalogue NVSUMSS, by\nmerging the NVSS and SUMSS catalogues and removing local sources by various\nmeans including cross-correlating with the 2MRS catalogue. We take into account\nboth aberration and Doppler boost to deduce our velocity from the hemispherical\nnumber count asymmetry, as well as via a 3-dimensional linear estimator. Both\nthe magnitude and direction depend on cuts made to the catalogue, e.g. on the\nlowest source flux, however these effects are small. With the hemispheric\nnumber count asymmetry method we obtain a velocity of 1729 $\\pm$ 187 km/s i.e.\nabout 4 times larger than that obtained from the CMB dipole, but close in\ndirection, towards RA=149 $\\pm$ 2 degree, DEC = -17 $\\pm$ 12 degree. With the\n3-dimensional estimator, the derived velocity is 1355 $\\pm$ 174 km/s towards\nRA=141 $\\pm$ 11 degree, DEC=-9 $\\pm$ 10 degree. We assess the statistical\nsignificance of these results by constructing catalogues of random\ndistributions and show that they are at best significant at the $2.81 \\sigma$\n(99.95% confidence) level.\n", "  We show that some or all of the inventory of $r$-process nucleosynthesis can\nbe produced in interactions of primordial black holes (PBHs) with neutron stars\n(NSs) if PBHs with masses ${10}^{-14}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot < {\\rm M}_{\\rm PBH} <\n{10}^{-8}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ make up a few percent or more of the dark matter. A\nPBH captured by a neutron star (NS) sinks to the center of the NS and consumes\nit from the inside. When this occurs in a rotating millisecond-period NS, the\nresulting spin-up ejects $\\sim 0.1-0.5\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ of relatively cold\nneutron-rich material. This ejection process and the accompanying decompression\nand decay of nuclear matter can produce electromagnetic transients, such as a\nkilonova-type afterglow and fast radio bursts. These transients are not\naccompanied by significant gravitational radiation or neutrinos, allowing such\nevents to be differentiated from compact object mergers occurring within the\ndistance sensitivity limits of gravitational wave observatories. The PBH-NS\ndestruction scenario is consistent with pulsar and NS statistics, the dark\nmatter content and spatial distributions in the Galaxy and Ultra Faint Dwarfs\n(UFD), as well as with the $r$-process content and evolution histories in these\nsites. Ejected matter is heated by beta decay, which leads to emission of\npositrons in an amount consistent with the observed 511-keV line from the\nGalactic Center.\n", "  Recent literature on deep neural networks for tagging of highly energetic\njets resulting from top quark decays has focused on image based techniques or\nmultivariate approaches using high-level jet substructure variables. Here, a\nsequential approach to this task is taken by using an ordered sequence of jet\nconstituents as training inputs. Unlike the majority of previous approaches,\nthis strategy does not result in a loss of information during pixelisation or\nthe calculation of high level features. The jet classification method achieves\na background rejection of 45 at a 50% efficiency operating point for\nreconstruction level jets with transverse momentum range of 600 to 2500 GeV and\nis insensitive to multiple proton-proton interactions at the levels expected\nthroughout Run 2 of the LHC.\n", "  The behaviour of quantum systems in non-inertial frames is revisited from the\npoint of view of affine coherent state (ACS) quantization. We restrict our\napproach to the one-particle dynamics confined in a rotating plane about a\nfixed axis. This plane is considered as punctured due to the existence of the\nrotation center, which is viewed as a singularity. The corresponding phase\nspace is the affine group of the plane and the ACS quantization enables us to\nquantize the system by respecting the affine symmetry of the true phase space.\nOur formulation predicts the appearance of an additional quantum centrifugal\nterm, besides the usual angular momentum one, which prevents the particle to\nreach the singular rotation center. Moreover it helps us to understand why two\ndifferent non-inertial Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations are obtained in previous\nworks. The validity of our equation can be confirmed experimentally by\nobserving the harmonic oscillator bound states and the critical angular\nvelocity for their existence.\n", "  We address the problem of characterizing the steerability of quantum states\nunder restrictive measurement scenarios, i.e., the problem of determining\nwhether a quantum state can demonstrate steering when subjected to $N$\nmeasurements of $k$ outcomes. We consider the cases of either general positive\noperator-valued measures (POVMs) or specific kinds of measurements (e.g.,\nprojective or symmetric). We propose general methods to calculate lower and\nupper bounds for the white-noise robustness of a $d$-dimensional quantum state\nunder different measurement scenarios that are also applicable to the study of\nthe noise robustness of the incompatibility of sets of unknown qudit\nmeasurements. We show that some mutually unbiased bases, symmetric\ninformationally complete measurements, and other symmetric choices of\nmeasurements are not optimal for steering isotropic states and provide\ncandidates to the most incompatible sets of measurements in each case. Finally,\nwe provide numerical evidence that nonprojective POVMs do not improve over\nprojective ones for this task.\n", "  Photon correlations between the photoluminescence peaks of the Mollow triplet\nhave been known for a long time, and recently hailed as a resource for heralded\nsingle-photon sources. Here, we provide the full picture of photon-correlations\nat all orders (we deal explicitly with up to four photons) and with no\nrestriction to the peculiar frequency windows enclosing the peaks. We show that\na rich multi-photon physics lies between the peaks, due to transition involving\nvirtual photons, and thereby much more strongly correlated than those\ntransiting through the dressed states. Specifically, we show that such\nemissions occur in bundles of photons rather than as successive, albeit\ncorrelated, photons. We provide the recipe to frequency-filter the emission of\nthe Mollow triplet to turn it into a versatile and tunable photon source,\nallowing in principle all scenarios of photon emission, with advantages already\nat the one-photon level, i.e., providing more strongly correlated heralded\nsingle-photon sources than those already known.\n", "  We study the anomalous Hall effect in monolayers of transition-metal\ndichalcogenides 2H-$MX_2$ ($M$=Mo, W, and $X$=S, Se, Te) under a proximity\neffect of ferromagnetic substrate. If a proximity-induced exchange field is\nintroduced, the spin-polarized energy bands in $K$ and $K'$ valleys are shifted\nin the opposite directions, and it causes the Hall effect by breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry. The induced Hall effect is the most prominent in the\nvalence band which has a large intrinsic spin splitting. Moreover, we find that\ntilting the magnetization from the perpendicular direction gives rise to a\nsensitive change in the Hall conductivity only in the electron side, and it is\nattributed to the mixing of the Berry phase by the in-plane field in the nearly\ndegenerate conduction bands.\n", "  The energy threshold of a cryogenic calorimeter can be lowered by reducing\nits size. This is of importance since the resulting increase in signal rate\nenables new approaches in rare-event searches, including the detection of MeV\nmass dark matter and coherent scattering of reactor or solar neutrinos. A\nscaling law for energy threshold vs. detector size is given. We analyze the\npossibility of lowering the threshold of a gram-scale cryogenic calorimeter to\nthe few eV regime. A prototype 0.5 g Al$_2$O$_3$ device achieved an energy\nthreshold of (${19.7\\pm0.1}$) eV, the lowest value reported for a macroscopic\ncalorimeter.\n", "  We discuss a small-scale experiment, called $\\nu$-cleus, for the first\ndetection of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering by probing nuclear-recoil\nenergies down to the 10 eV-regime. The detector consists of low-threshold\nCaWO$_4$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ calorimeter arrays with a total mass of about 10 g and\nseveral cryogenic veto detectors operated at millikelvin temperatures.\nRealizing a fiducial volume and a multi-element target, the detector enables\nactive discrimination of $\\gamma$, neutron and surface backgrounds. A first\nprototype Al$_2$O$_3$ device, operated above ground in a setup without\nshielding, has achieved an energy threshold of ${\\sim20}$ eV and further\nimprovements are in reach. A sensitivity study for the detection of coherent\nneutrino scattering at nuclear power plants shows a unique discovery potential\n(5$\\sigma$) within a measuring time of ${\\lesssim2}$ weeks. Furthermore, a site\nat a thermal research reactor and the use of a radioactive neutrino source are\ninvestigated. With this technology, real-time monitoring of nuclear power\nplants is feasible.\n", "  Energy saving mechanisms in nature allow following organisms to expend less\nenergy than leaders. Queues, or ordered rows of individuals, may form when\norganisms exploit the available energy saving mechanism while travelling at\nnear-maximal sustainable metabolic capacities; compact clusters form when group\nmembers travel well below maximal sustainable metabolic capacities. The group\nsize range, given here as the ratio of the difference between the size of the\nlargest and smallest group members, and the size of the largest member (as a\nper cent), has been hypothesized to correspond proportionately to the energy\nsaving quantity because weaker, smaller, individuals sustain speeds of\nstronger, larger, individuals by exploiting the energy saving mechanism (as a\nper cent). During migration, small individuals outside this range may perish,\nor form sub-groups, or simply not participate in migratory behavior. We\napproximate drag forces for leading and following individuals in queues of the\nlate Devonian (approx. 370 Ma) trilobite Trimerocephalus chopini. Applying data\nfrom literature of R. herculea, a living crustacean, we approximate the\nhypothetical walking speed and maximal speeds for T. chopini. Findings\nreasonably support the hypothesis: among the population of fossilized queues of\nT. chopini reported by Kin and Blazejowski (2013), trilobite size range was 75%\nwhile the size range within queues, was 63%; this corresponds reasonably with\ndrag reductions in following positions that permit approx. 61.5% energy saving\nfor trilobites following others in optimal low-drag positions. We model\ncollective trilobite behavior associated with hydrodynamic drafting.\n", "  The first observation of the decays $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\chi_{c1} p K^-$ and\n$\\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\chi_{c2} p K^-$ is reported using a data sample corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of $3.0$ fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb\nexperiment in $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The\nfollowing ratios of branching fractions are measured\n  \\begin{eqnarray*}\n  \\frac{{\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\chi_{c1} p K^-)}{{\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to\nJ/\\psi p K^-)} = 0.242 \\pm 0.014 \\pm 0.013 \\pm 0.009,\n  \\frac{{\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\chi_{c2} p K^-)}{{\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to\nJ/\\psi p K^-)} = 0.248 \\pm 0.020 \\pm 0.014 \\pm 0.009,\n  \\frac{{\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\chi_{c2} p K^-)}{{\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to\n\\chi_{c1} p K^-)} = 1.02 \\pm 0.10 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.05,\n  \\end{eqnarray*} where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second\nsystematic and the third due to the uncertainty on the branching fractions of\nthe $\\chi_{c1}\\to J/\\psi\\gamma$ and $\\chi_{c2} \\to J/\\psi\\gamma$ decays. Using\nboth decay modes, the mass of the $\\Lambda_b^0$ baryon is also measured to be\n$m_{\\Lambda_b^0} = 5619.44 \\pm 0.28 \\pm 0.26$ MeV/$c^2$, where the first and\nsecond uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively.\n", "  We demonstrate the coherent coupling and the resulting transfer of phase\ninformation between microwave and optical fields in a single nitrogen vacancy\ncenter in diamond. The relative phase of two microwave fields is encoded in a\ncoherent superposition spin state. This phase information is then retrieved\nwith a pair of optical fields. A related process is also used for the transfer\nof phase information from optical to microwave fields. These studies show the\nessential role of dark states, including optical pumping into the dark states,\nin the coherent microwave-optical coupling and open the door to the full\nquantum state transfer between microwave and optical fields in a solid-state\nspin ensemble.\n", "  In chemical or physical reaction dynamics, it is essential to distinguish\nprecisely between reactants and products for all time. This task is especially\ndemanding in time-dependent or driven systems because therein the dividing\nsurface (DS) between these states often exhibits a nontrivial time-dependence.\nThe so-called transition state (TS) trajectory has been seen to define a DS\nwhich is free of recrossings in a large number of one-dimensional reactions\nacross time-dependent barriers, and, thus, allows one to determine exact\nreaction rates. A fundamental challenge to applying this method is the\nconstruction of the TS trajectory itself. The minimization of Lagrangian\ndescriptors (LDs) provides a general and powerful scheme to obtain that\ntrajectory even when perturbation theory fails. Both approaches encounter\npossible breakdowns when the overall potential is bounded, admitting the\npossibility of returns to the barrier long after trajectories have reached the\nproduct or reactant wells. Such global dynamics cannot be captured by\nperturbation theory. Meanwhile, in the LD-DS approach, it leads to the\nemergence of additional local minima which make it difficult to extract the\noptimal branch associated with the desired TS trajectory. In this work, we\nillustrate this behavior for a time-dependent double-well potential revealing a\nself-similar structure of the LD, and we demonstrate how the reflections and\nside-minima can be addressed by an appropriate modification of the LD\nassociated with the direct rate across the barrier.\n", "  Most theoretical descriptions of lyotropic cholesteric liquid crystals to\ndate focus on homogeneous systems in which the rod concentration, as opposed to\nthe rod orientation, is uniform. In this work, we build upon the\nOnsager-Straley theory for twisted nematics and study the effect of weak\nconcentration gradients, generated by some external potential, on the\ncholesteric twist. We apply our theory to chiral nematics of nanohelices in\nwhich the supramolecular helix sense is known to spontaneously change sign upon\nvariation of particle concentration, passing through a so-called compensation\npoint at which the mesoscopic twist vanishes. We show that the imposed field\noffers exquisite control of the handedness and magnitude of the helicoidal\ndirector field, even at weak field strengths. Within the same framework we also\nquantify the director fluctuation spectrum and find evidence for a correlation\nlength diverging at the compensation point.\n", "  For three-dimensional ABJ(M) theories and $\\mathcal N=4$ Chern-Simons-matter\nquiver theories, we construct two sets of 1/2 BPS Wilson loop operators by\napplying the Higgsing procedure along independent directions of the moduli\nspace, and choosing different massive modes. For theories whose dual M-theory\ndescription is known, we also determine the corresponding spectrum of 1/2 BPS\nM2-brane solutions. We identify the supercharges in M-theory and field theory,\nas well as the supercharges preserved by M2-/anti-M2-branes and 1/2 BPS Wilson\nloops. In particular, in $\\mathcal N=4$ orbifold ABJM theory we find pairs of\ndifferent 1/2 BPS Wilson loops that preserve exactly the same set of\nsupercharges. In field theory they arise by Higgsing with the choice of either\nparticles or antiparticles, whereas in the dual description they correspond to\na pair of M2-/anti-M2-branes localized at different positions in the compact\nspace. This result enlightens the origin of classical Wilson loop degeneracy in\nthese theories, already discussed in arXiv:1506.07614. A discussion on possible\nscenarios that emerge by comparison with localization results is included.\n", "  In beam shaping applications, the minimization of the number of necessary\noptical elements for the beam shaping process can benefit the compactness of\nthe optical system and reduce its cost. The single freeform surface design for\ninput wavefronts, which are neither planar nor spherical, is therefore of\ninterest. In this work, the design of single freeform surfaces for a given\nzero-\\'etendue source and complex target irradiances is investigated. Hence,\nnot only collimated input beams or point sources are assumed. Instead, a\npredefined input ray direction vector field and irradiance distribution on a\nsource plane, which has to be redistributed by a single freeform surface to\ngive the predefined target irradiance, is considered. To solve this design\nproblem, a partial differential equation (PDE) or PDE system, respectively, for\nthe unknown surface and its corresponding ray mapping is derived from energy\nconservation and the ray-tracing equations. In contrast to former PDE\nformulations of the single freeform design problem, the derived PDE of\nMonge-Amp\\`ere type is formulated for general zero-\\'etendue sources in\ncartesian coordinates. The PDE system is discretized with finite differences\nand the resulting nonlinear equation system solved by a root-finding algorithm.\nThe basis of the efficient solution of the PDE system builds the introduction\nof an initial iterate constuction approach for a given input direction vector\nfield, which uses optimal mass transport with a quadratic cost function. After\na detailed description of the numerical algorithm, the efficiency of the design\nmethod is demonstrated by applying it to several design examples. This includes\nthe redistribution of a collimated input beam beyond the paraxial\napproximation, the shaping of point source radiation and the shaping of an\nastigmatic input wavefront into a complex target irradiance distribution.\n", "  We present results of a theoretical study of photocurrents in the Weyl\nsemimetals belonging to the gyrotropic symmetry classes. We show that, in\nweakly gyrotropic symmetry classes C$_{nv}$ ($n = 3,4,6$), the circular\nphotocurrent transverse to the incidence direction appears only with account,\nin the electron effective Hamiltonian, for both linear and quadratic or cubic\nin quasi-momentum spin-dependent terms as well as a spin-independent term\nresulting in the tilt of the cone dispersion. A polarization-independent\nmagneto-induced photocurrent is predicted which is also allowed in gyrotropic\nsystems only. For crystals of the C$_{2v}$ symmetry, we consider a microscopic\nmechanism of the photocurrent in a quantized magnetic field which is generated\nunder direct optical transitions between the ground and the first excited\nmagnetic subbands. It is shown that this current becomes nonzero with allowance\nfor anisotropic tilt of the dispersion cones.\n", "  In semimetals with time-reversal symmetry, the interplay between Weyl points\nand Fu-Kane-Mele indices results in coexisting surface Dirac cones and Fermi\narcs that are transmutable without a topological phase transition. We show that\nWeyl points act as a new type of monopole, and that their connectivity is\nessential for capturing the full topology of semimetals and their role as\nintermediaries of topological insulator transitions. The history of Weyl point\ncreation-annihilation provides a simple and mathematically equivalent way to\nclassify semimetals, and directly prefigures the surface state topology. We\nfurther predict the possibility of a topological Dirac cone on the interface\nbetween two Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Cross-field neoclassical transport of heat, particles and momentum is studied\nin sharp density pedestals, with a focus on isotope and profile effects, using\na radially global approach. Global effects -- which tend to reduce the peak ion\nheat flux, and shift it outward -- increase with isotope mass for fixed\nprofiles. The heat flux reduction exhibits a saturation with a favorable\nisotopic trend. A significant part of the heat flux can be convective even in\npure plasmas, unlike in the plasma core, and it is sensitive to how momentum\nsources are distributed between the various species. In particular, if only ion\nmomentum sources are allowed, in global simulations of pure plasmas the ion\nparticle flux remains close to its local value, while this may not be the case\nfor simulations with isotope mixtures or electron momentum sources. The radial\nangular momentum transport that is a finite orbit width effect, is found to be\nstrongly correlated with heat sources.\n", "  We assess the range of validity of sgoldstino-less inflation in a scenario of\nlow energy supersymmetry breaking. We first analyze the consistency conditions\nthat an effective theory of the inflaton and goldstino superfields should\nsatisfy in order to be faithfully described by a sgoldstino-less model.\nEnlarging the scope of previous studies, we investigate the case where the\neffective field theory cut-off, and hence also the sgoldstino mass, are\ninflaton-dependent. We then introduce a UV complete model where one can realize\nsuccessfully sgoldstino-less inflation and gauge mediation of supersymmetry\nbreaking, combining the alpha-attractor mechanism and a weakly coupled model of\nspontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. In this class of models we find that,\ngiven current limits on superpartner masses, the gravitino mass has a lower\nbound of the order of the MeV, i.e. we cannot reach very low supersymmetry\nbreaking scales. On the plus side, we recognize that in this framework, one can\nderive the complete superpartner spectrum as well as compute inflation\nobservables, the reheating temperature, and address the gravitino overabundance\nproblem. We then show that further constraints come from collider results and\ninflation observables. Their non trivial interplay seems a staple feature of\nphenomenological studies of supersymmetric inflationary models.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to present a linear viscoelastic model based on\nPrabhakar fractional operators. In particular, we propose a modification of the\nclassical fractional Maxwell model, in which we replace the Caputo derivative\nwith the Prabhakar one. Furthermore, we also discuss how to recover a formal\nequivalence between the new model and the known classical models of linear\nviscoelasticity by means of a suitable choice of the parameters in the\nPrabhakar derivative. Moreover, we also underline an interesting connection\nbetween the theory of Prabhakar fractional integrals and the recently\nintroduced Caputo-Fabrizio differential operator.\n", "  We present a semiclassical study of the spectrum of a few-body system\nconsisting of two short-range interacting bosonic particles in one dimension, a\nparticular case of a general class of integrable many-body systems where the\nenergy spectrum is given by the solution of algebraic transcendental equations.\nBy an exact mapping between $\\delta$-potentials and boundary conditions on the\nfew-body wave functions, we are able to extend previous semiclassical results\nfor single-particle systems with mixed boundary conditions to the two-body\nproblem. The semiclassical approach allows us to derive explicit analytical\nresults for the smooth part of the two-body density of states that are in\nexcellent agreement with numerical calculations. It further enables us to\ninclude the effect of bound states in the attractive case. Remarkably, for the\nparticular case of two particles in one dimension, the discrete energy levels\nobtained through a requantization condition of the smooth density of states are\nessentially in perfect agreement with the exact ones.\n", "  Fractional Josephson effect is a unique character of Majorana Fermions in\ntopological superconductor system. This effect is very difficult to detect\nexperimentally because of the disturbance of quasiparticle poisoning and\nunwanted couplings in the superconductor. Here, we propose a scheme to probe\nfractional DC Josephson effect of semiconductor nanowire-based topological\nJosephson junction through 4{\\pi} phase slip. By exploiting a topological RF\nSQUID system we find that the dominant contribution for Josephson coupling\ncomes from the interaction of Majorana Fermions, resulting the resonant\ntunneling with 4{\\pi} phase slip. Our calculations with experimentally\nreachable parameters show that the time scale for detecting the phase slip is\ntwo orders of magnitude shorter than the poisoning time of nonequilibrium\nquasiparticles. Additionally, with a reasonable nanowire length the 4{\\pi}\nphase slip could overwhelm the topological trivial 2{\\pi} phase slip. Our work\nis meaningful for exploring the effect of modest quantum fluctuations of the\nphase of the superconductor on the topological system, and provide a new method\nfor quantum information processing.\n", "  We demonstrate that numerical relativity codes based on the moving punctures\nformalism are capable of evolving nearly maximally spinning black hole\nbinaries. We compare a new evolution of an equal-mass, aligned-spin binary with\ndimensionless spin chi=0.99 using puncture-based data with recent simulations\nof the SXS Collaboration. We find that the overlap of our new waveform with the\npublished results of the SXS Collaboration is larger than 0.999. To generate\nour new waveform, we use the recently introduced HiSpID puncture data, the CCZ4\nevolution system, and a modified lapse condition that helps keep the horizon\nradii reasonably large.\n", "  We consider the flotation of deformable, non-wetting drops on a liquid\ninterface. We consider the deflection of both the liquid interface and the\ndroplet itself in response to the buoyancy forces, density difference and the\nvarious surface tensions within the system. Our results suggest new insight\ninto a range of phenomena in which such drops occur, including Leidenfrost\ndroplets and floating liquid marbles. In particular, we show that the floating\nstate of liquid marbles is very sensitive to the tension of the\nparticle-covered interface and suggest that this sensitivity may make such\nexperiments a useful assay of the properties of these complex interfaces.\n", "  We introduce and explore a family of self-dual models of single-particle\nmotion in quasiperiodic potentials, with hopping amplitudes that fall off as a\npower law with exponent $p$. These models are generalizations of the familiar\nAubry-Andre model. For large enough $p$, their static properties are similar to\nthose of the Aubry-Andre model, although the low-frequency conductivity in the\nlocalized phase is sensitive to $p$. For $p \\leq 2.1$ the Aubry-Andre\nlocalization transition splits into three transitions; two distinct\nintermediate regimes with both localized and delocalized states appear near the\nself-dual point of the Aubry-Andre model. In the intermediate regimes, the\ndensity of states is singular continuous in much of the spectrum, and is\napproximately self-similar: states form narrow energy bands, which are divided\ninto yet narrower sub-bands; we find no clear sign of a mobility edge. When $p\n< 1$, localized states are not stable in random potentials; in the present\nmodel, however, tightly localized states are present for relatively large\nsystems. We discuss the frequency-dependence and strong sample-to-sample\nfluctuations of the low-frequency optical conductivity, although a suitably\ngeneralized version of Mott's law is recovered when the power-law is slowly\ndecaying. We present evidence that many of these features persist in models\nthat are away from self-duality.\n", "  Through timelike dualities, one can generate exotic versions of $M$-theory\nwith different spacetime signatures. These are the $M^*$-theory with signature\n$(9,2,-)$, the $M'$-theory, with signature $(6,5,+)$ and the theories with\nreversed signatures $(1,10, -)$, $(2,9, +)$ and $(5,6, -)$. In $(s,t, \\pm)$,\n$s$ is the number of space directions, $t$ the number of time directions, and\n$\\pm$ refers to the sign of the kinetic term of the $3$ form.\n  The only irreducible pseudo-riemannian manifolds admitting absolute\nparallelism are, besides Lie groups, the seven-sphere $S^7 \\equiv SO(8)/SO(7)$\nand its pseudo-riemannian version $S^{3,4} \\equiv SO(4,4)/SO(3,4)$. [There is\nalso the complexification $SO(8,\\mathbb{C})/SO(7, \\mathbb{C})$, but it is of\ndimension too high for our considerations.] The seven-sphere $S^7\\equiv\nS^{7,0}$ has been found to play an important role in $11$-dimensional\nsupergravity, both through the Freund-Rubin solution and the Englert solution\nthat uses its remarkable parallelizability to turn on non trivial internal\nfluxes. The spacetime manifold is in both cases $AdS_4 \\times S^7$. We show\nthat $S^{3,4}$ enjoys a similar role in $M'$-theory and construct the exotic\nform $AdS_4 \\times S^{3,4}$ of the Englert solution, with non zero internal\nfluxes turned on. There is no analogous solution in $M^*$-theory.\n", "  Low-dimensional plasmonic materials can function as high quality terahertz\nand infrared antennas at deep subwavelength scales. Despite these antennas'\nstrong coupling to electromagnetic fields, there is a pressing need to further\nstrengthen their absorption. We address this problem by fabricating thick films\nof aligned, uniformly sized carbon nanotubes and showing that their plasmon\nresonances are strong, narrow, and broadly tunable. With thicknesses ranging\nfrom 25 to 250 nm, our films exhibit peak attenuation reaching 70%, quality\nfactors reaching 9, and electrostatically tunable peak frequencies by a factor\nof 2.3x. Excellent nanotube alignment leads to the attenuation being 99%\nlinearly polarized along the nanotube axis. Increasing the film thickness\nblueshifts the plasmon resonators down to peak wavelengths as low as 1.4\nmicrometers, promoting them to a new near-infrared regime in which they can\nboth overlap the S11 nanotube exciton energy and access the technologically\nimportant infrared telecom band.\n", "  In this work the process of elastic hadron scattering is discussed. In\nparticular, scattering amplitudes for the various Pomeron models are compared.\nIn addition, differential elastic cross section as a function of the scattered\nproton transverse momentum for unpolarised and polarised protons is presented.\nFinally, an implementation of the elastic scattering amplitudes into the GenEx\nMonte Carlo generator is discussed.\n", "  In this work, we study the magnetic orders of the classical spin model with\nthe anisotropic exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in order to\nunderstand the uniaxial stress effect in chiral magnets such as MnSi.\nVariational zero temperature (T) calculated results demonstrate that various\nhelical orders can be developed depending on the magnitude of the interaction\nanisotropy, consistent with the experimental observations at low T.\nFurthermore, the creation and annihilation of the skyrmions by the uniaxial\npressure can be also qualitatively reproduced in our Monte Carlo simulations.\nThus, our work suggests that the interaction anisotropy tuned by applied\nuniaxial stress may play an essential role in modulating the magnetic orders in\nstrained chiral magnets.\n", "  We consider a movable mirror coupled to a one-dimensional massless scalar\nfield in a cavity. Both the field and the mirror's mechanical degrees of\nfreedom are described quantum-mechanically, and they can interact each other\nvia the radiation pressure operator. We investigate the dynamical evolution of\nmirror and field starting from a nonequilibrium initial state, and their local\ninteraction which brings the system to a stationary configuration for long\ntimes. This allows us to study the time-dependent dressing process of the\nmovable mirror interacting with the field, and its dynamics leading to a local\nequilibrium dressed configuration. Also, in order to explore the effect of the\nradiation pressure on both sides of the movable mirror, we generalize the\neffective field-mirror Hamiltonian and previous results to the case of two\ncavities sharing the same mobile boundary. This leads us to address, in the\nappropriate limit, the dynamical dressing problem of a single mobile wall,\nbounded by a harmonic potential, in the vacuum space.\n", "  We discuss the dynamics of a generalized three-sphere microswimmer in which\nthe spheres are connected by two elastic springs. The natural length of each\nspring is assumed to undergo a prescribed cyclic change. We analytically obtain\nthe average swimming velocity as a function of the frequency of the cyclic\nchange in the natural length. In the low-frequency region, the swimming\nvelocity increases with the frequency and its expression reduces to that of the\noriginal three-sphere model by Najafi and Golestanian. In the high-frequency\nregion, conversely, the average velocity decreases with increasing the\nfrequency. Such a behavior originates from the intrinsic spring relaxation\ndynamics of an elastic swimmer moving in a viscous fluid.\n", "  We study the emergence of chimera states in a multilayer neuronal network,\nwhere one layer is composed of coupled and the other layer of uncoupled\nneurons. Through the multilayer structure, the layer with coupled neurons acts\nas the medium by means of which neurons in the uncoupled layer share\ninformation in spite of the absent physical connections among them. Neurons in\nthe coupled layer are connected with electrical synapses, while across the two\nlayers neurons are connected through chemical synapses. In both layers the\ndynamics of each neuron is described by the Hindmarsh-Rose square wave bursting\ndynamics. We show that the presence of two different types of connecting\nsynapses within and between the two layers, together with the multilayer\nnetwork structure, plays a key role in the emergence of between-layer\nsynchronous chimera states and patterns of synchronous clusters. In particular,\nwe find that these chimera states can emerge in the coupled layer regardless of\nthe range of electrical synapses. Even in all-to-all and nearest-neighbor\ncoupling within the coupled layer, we observe qualitatively identical\nbetween-layer chimera states. Moreover, we show that the role of information\ntransmission delay between the two layers must not be neglected, and we obtain\nprecise parameter bounds at which chimera states can be observed. The expansion\nof the chimera region and annihilation of cluster and fully coherent states in\nthe parameter plane for increasing values of inter-layer chemical synaptic time\ndelay are illustrated using effective range measurement. These results are\ndiscussed in the light of neuronal evolution, where the coexistence of coherent\nand incoherent dynamics during the developmental stage is particularly likely.\n", "  Diving induces large pressures during water entry, accompanied by the\ncreation of cavity and water splash ejected from the free water surface. To\nminimize impact forces, divers streamline their shape at impact. Here, we\ninvestigate the impact forces and splash evolution of diving wedges as a\nfunction of the wedge opening angle. A gradual transition from impactful to\nsmooth entry is observed as the wedge angle decreases. After submersion, diving\nwedges experience significantly smaller drag forces (two-fold smaller) than\nimmersed wedges. Our experimental findings compare favorably with existing\nforce models upon the introduction of empirically-based corrections. We\nexperimentally characterize the shapes of the cavity and splash created by the\nwedge and find that they are independent of the entry velocity at short times,\nbut that the splash exhibits distinct variations in shape at later times. We\npropose a one-dimensional model of the splash that takes into account gravity,\nsurface tension and aerodynamics forces. The model shows, in conjunction with\nexperimental data, that the splash shape is dominated by the interplay between\na destabilizing Venturi-suction force due to air rushing between the splash and\nthe water surface and a stabilizing force due to surface tension. Taken\ntogether, these findings could direct future research aimed at understanding\nand combining the mechanisms underlying all stages of water entry in\napplication to engineering and bio-related problems, including naval\nengineering, disease spreading or platform diving.\n", "  The carrier-mediated RKKY interaction between local spins plays an important\nrole for the application of magnetically doped graphene in spintronics and\nquantum computation. Previous studies largely concentrate on the influence of\nelectronic states of uniform systems on the RKKY interaction. Here we reveal a\nvery different way to manipulate the RKKY interaction by showing that the\nanomalous focusing - a well-known electron optics phenomenon in graphene P-N\njunctions - can be utilized to refocus the massless Dirac electrons emanating\nfrom one local spin to the other local spin. This gives rise to rich spatial\ninterference patterns and symmetry-protected non-oscillatory RKKY interaction\nwith a strongly enhanced magnitude. It may provide a new way to engineer the\nlong-range spin-spin interaction in graphene.\n", "  The Micromegas technology is one of the most successful MPGD concepts and\nwidely utilized in nuclear and particle physics experiments. Twenty years of\nresearch and development rendered the technology sufficiently mature to be\nselected as precision tracking detector for the New Small Wheel (NSW) upgrade\nof the ATLAS Muon spectrometer. This will be the first large scale application\nof Micromegas in one of the major LHC experiments. The studies on signal\nformation in Micromegas focuses on the microscopic signal electron loss\nmechanisms and the amplification processes in electron gas interaction. Based\non a model of detector parameter dependencies, these processes are scrutinized\nin an iterating comparison between exper- imental results, theory prediction of\nthe macroscopic observables and process simulation on the microscopic level.\nUtilizing the specialized detectors developed in the scope of this thesis as\nwell as refined simulation algorithms, an unprecedented level of accuracy in\nthe process description is reached, deepening the understanding of the\nfundamental process in gaseous detectors. The second part is dedicated to the\nchallenges arising with the large scale Micro- megas production for the ATLAS\nNSW. A selection of technological choices, are discussed alongside a final\nreport on two production related tasks addressing the detectors core\ncomponents: For the industrial production of resistive anode PCBs a detailed\nquality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) scheme as well as the therefore\nrequired testing tools have been developed. In parallel the study on micromesh\nparameter optimization and production feasibility resulted in the selection of\nthe proposed mesh by the NSW community. The successful completion of both tasks\nwere important milestones towards the construction of large size Micromegas\ndetectors clearing the path for NSW series production.\n", "  Realistic calculations of electron addition and removal spectra rely most\noften on Green's functions and complex, non-local self-energies. We introduce a\nshortcut to obtain the spectral function directly from a local and\nfrequency-dependent, yet real, potential. We calculate this potential in the\nhomogeneous electron gas (HEG), and we design a connector which prescribes the\nuse of the HEG results to calculate spectral functions of real materials.\nBenchmark results for several solids demonstrate the potential of our approach.\n", "  We map the star formation history across M31 by fitting stellar evolution\nmodels to color-magnitude diagrams of each 83$''{\\times}$83$''$ (0.3$\\times$1.4\nkpc, deprojected) region of the PHAT survey outside of the innermost\n6$'{\\times}$12$'$ portion. We find that most of the star formation occurred\nprior to $\\sim$8 Gyr ago, followed by a relatively quiescent period until\n$\\sim$4 Gyr ago, a subsequent star formation episode about 2 Gyr ago and a\nreturn to relative quiescence. There appears to be little, if any, structure\nvisible for populations with ages older than 2 Gyr, suggesting significant\nmixing since that epoch. Finally, assuming a Kroupa IMF from 0.1$-$100\nM$_{\\odot}$, we find that the total amount of star formation over the past 14\nGyr in the area over which we have fit models is 5${\\times}$10$^{10}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. Fitting the radial distribution of this star formation and\nassuming azimuthal symmetry, (1.5$\\pm$0.2)${\\times}$10$^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of\nstars have formed in the M31 disk as a whole, (9$\\pm$2)${\\times}$10$^{10}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ of which has likely survived to the present after accounting for\nevolutionary effects. This mass is about one fifth of the total dynamical mass\nof M31.\n", "  We compare alternative planar cavity structures for strong exciton$-$photon\ncoupling, where the conventional distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and three\nunconventional types of cavity mirrors$-$ air/GaAs DBR, Tamm $-$ plasmon mirror\nand sub$-$wavelength grating mirror. We design and optimize the planar cavities\nbuilt with each type of mirror at one side or both sides for maximum vacuum\nfield strength. We discuss the trade$-$off between performance and fabrication\ndifficulty for each cavity structure. We show that cavities with\nsub$-$wavelength grating mirrors allow simultaneously strongest field and high\ncavity quality. The optimization principles and techniques developed in this\nwork will guide the cavity design for research and applications of\nmatter$-$light coupled semiconductors, especially new material systems that\nrequire greater flexibility in the choice of cavity materials and cavity\nfabrication procedures.\n", "  The most abundant components of primitive meteorites (chondrites) are\nmillimeter-sized glassy spherical chondrules formed by transient melting events\nin the solar protoplanetary disk. Using Pb-Pb dates of 22 individual\nchondrules, we show that primary production of chondrules in the early solar\nsystem was restricted to the first million years after formation of the Sun and\nthat these existing chondrules were recycled for the remaining lifetime of the\nprotoplanetary disk. This is consistent with a primary chondrule formation\nepisode during the early high-mass accretion phase of the protoplanetary disk\nthat transitions into a longer period of chondrule reworking. An abundance of\nchondrules at early times provides the precursor material required to drive the\nefficient and rapid formation of planetary objects via chondrule accretion.\n", "  The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph's (STIS) BAR5 coronagraphic occulter\nwas designed to provide high-contrast, visible-light, imaging in close (>=\n0.15\") angular proximity to bright point-sources. This is the smallest inner\nworking angle (IWA) possible with HST's suite of coronagraphically augmented\ninstruments through its mission lifetime. The STIS BAR5 image plane occulter,\nhowever, was damaged (bent and deformed) pre-launch and had not been enabled\nfor GO science use following the installation of the instrument in 1997, during\nHST servicing mission SM2. With the success of the HST GO 12923 program,\ndiscussed herein, we explored and verified the functionality and utility of the\nBAR5 occulter. Thus, despite its physical damage, with updates to the knowledge\nof the aperture mask metrology and target pointing requirements, a robust\ndetermination of achievable raw and PSF-subtracted stellocentric image\ncontrasts and fidelity was conducted. We also investigated, and herein report\non, the use of the BAR10 rounded corners as narrow-angle occulters and compare\nIWA vs. contrast performance for the BAR5, BAR10, and Wedge occulters. With\nthat, we provide recommendations for the most efficacious BAR5 and BAR10 use\non-orbit in support of GO science. With color-matched PSF-template subtracted\ncoronagraphy, inclusive of a small (+/- 1/4 pixel) 3-point cross-bar dithering\nstrategy we recommend, we find BAR5 can deliver effective ~ 0.2\" IWA image\ncontrast of ~ 4 x 10^-5 pixel^-1 to ~ 1 x 10^-8 pixel^-1 at 2\". With the\npointing updates (to the PDB SIAF.dat file and/or implemented through APT) that\nwe identified, and with observing strategies we explored, we recommend the use\nof STIS BAR5 coronagraphy as a fully \"supported\" capability for unique GO\nscience.\n", "  During the last decade, density function theory (DFT) in its static and\ndynamic time dependent forms, has emerged as a powerful tool to describe the\nstructure and dynamics of doped liquid helium and droplets. In this review, we\nsummarize the activity carried out in this field within the DFT framework since\nthe publication of the previous review article on this subject [M. Barranco et\nal., J. Low Temp. Phys. 142, 1 (2006)]. Furthermore, a comprehensive\npresentation of the actual implementations of helium DFT is given, which have\nnot been discussed in the individual articles or are scattered in the existing\nliterature. This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published on August 2,\n2017 by Taylor & Francis Group in Int. Rev. Phys. Chem. 36, 621 (2017),\navailable online: http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0144235X.2017.1351672\n", "  We provide a Mathematica package, DirectDM, that takes as input the Wilson\ncoefficients of the relativistic effective theory describing the interactions\nof dark matter with quarks, gluons and photons, and matches it onto an\neffective theory describing the interactions of dark matter with neutrons and\nprotons. The nonperturbative matching is performed at leading order in a chiral\nexpansion. The one-loop QCD and QED renormalization-group evolution from the\nelectroweak scale down to the hadronic scale, as well as finite corrections at\nthe heavy quark thresholds are taken into account. We also provide an interface\nwith the package DMFormFactor so that, starting from the relativistic effective\ntheory, one can directly obtain the event rates for direct detection\nexperiments.\n", "  In the current study, the influence of turbulent mixing and local reaction\nrates on deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) was investigated using a\nstate-of-the-art large eddy simulation (LES) strategy. Specifically, detonation\nattenuation by a porous medium, and the subsequent re-initiation for\nmethane-oxygen, a moderately unstable mixture, was considered. The purpose of\nthe investigation was to validate the numerical strategy with previous\nexperimental observations, and to determine what specific roles turbulent\nmixing and shock compression have on flame acceleration during the final stages\nof DDT. The modelling procedure adopted was a grid-within-a-grid approach: The\ncompressible linear eddy model for large eddy simulation (CLEM-LES). It was\nfound that average turbulent fluctuations greater than the laminar flame speed\nwere required in order to maintain wave velocities above the Chapman-Jouguet\n(CJ)-deflagration velocity threshold, a precursor requirement for DDT to occur.\nIt was also found that sufficient turbulent burning on the flame surface was\nrequired in order to drive pressure waves to sufficiently strengthen the\nleading shock wave, locally, in order to trigger auto-ignition hot spots in the\nwave front. These local explosion events, which were found to burn out through\nturbulent surface reactions, drive transverse pressure waves outward. Upon\nsubsequent shock reflections or interactions of the transverse waves, new local\nexplosion events occurred, which further strengthened the adjacent leading\nshock wave above the CJ-detonation speed. Eventually, through this process, the\nwave sustained the CJ-detonation speed, on average, through the cyclic\nmechanism of local explosion events followed by turbulent surface reactions.\nFinally, combustion of the flame acceleration process was found to lie\npredominantly within the thin-reaction zones regime.\n", "  Starting from the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation (FKPP) we\nmodel the dynamic of a diffusive system with two mutually communicating\nidentical patches and isolated of the remaining matrix. For this system we find\nthe minimal size of each fragment in the explicit form and compare with the\nexplicit results for similar problems found in the literature. From this\ncomparison emerges an unexpected result that for a same set of the parameters,\nthe isolated system studied in this work with size L, can be better or worst\nthan the non isolated systems with the same size L, uniquely depending on the\nparameter $a_{0}$ (internal conditions of the patches). Due to the fact that\nthis result is unexpected we propose a experimental verification.\n", "  We here propose and demonstrate a point-by-point programmable broadband\nmicrowave spectrum processor with high-resolution up to tens of MHz. We achieve\nthis by bandwidth-minified mapping a programmable optical spectrum processor,\nwhich has much larger bandwidth and lower frequency resolution, to a microwave\none, and make sure the mapping is a similarity transformation. As a comparison,\nthe traditional optical-to-microwave mapping based on super-heterodyne is\nbandwidth-preserved and identical. Here the optical spectrum processor is\nfirstly sliced by a high-quality-factor optical resonator, which has periodic\ntransmission peak with MHz-level bandwidth, and then is mapped to microwave\ndomain by optical-frequency-comb-assisted multi-heterodyne. We demonstrate the\nhigh frequency resolution and full function reconfigurability experimentally.\nIn a numerical example, we show that the group delay variation of optical\nspectrum processor could be greatly enlarged after mapping. The resolution\nimprovement and group delay magnification distinguish our proposal\nsignificantly from previous spectrum mapping from optics to microwave.\n", "  While in a triggered experiment the matching of the RPC transmission line\nimpedance with the one of the front-end electronics is less critical, for a\ntrigger-less data recording this becomes mandatory. As expected, impedance\nmatching is not straightforward when other requirements in terms of time and\nposition resolutions, efficiency and granularity, have to be fulfilled in the\nsame time. A method and the very first results obtained with a RPC prototype\nbuilt based on it, presented in this paper, show that the impedance matching,\nindependent of its granularity, can be achieved using an innovative\narchitecture of the RPC.\n", "  Two distinct structures of aggregates of atoms connected by anisotropic bonds\nwith a network configuration are discussed from the viewpoint of a point set\ntopology. A specific topological space connects the two types of topological\nstructures based on the equivalence classes, which show the main difference of\nthe structures between the aggregates of atoms with or without a clusterized\nstructure.\n", "  In the continuity of our previous paper arXiv:1509.05516, we define three new\nalgebras, $A_{n}(a,b,c)$, $B_{n}$ and $C_{n}$, that are close to the braid\nalgebra. They allow to build solutions to the braided Yang-Baxter equation with\nspectral parameters. The construction is based on a baxterisation procedure,\nsimilar to the one used in the context of Hecke or BMW algebras.\n  The $A_{n}(a,b,c)$ algebra depends on three arbitrary parameters, and when\nthe parameter $a$ is set to zero, we recover the algebra $M_{n}(b,c)$ already\nintroduced elsewhere for purpose of baxterisation. The Hecke algebra (and its\nbaxterisation) can be recovered from a coset of the $A_{n}(0,0,c)$ algebra. The\nalgebra $A_{n}(0,b,-b^2)$ is a coset of the braid algebra.\n  The two other algebras $B_{n}$ and $C_{n}$ do not possess any parameter, and\ncan be also viewed as a coset of the braid algebra.\n", "  In the spatial circular restricted three-body problem librational motion\naround the Lagrangian points $L_4$ and $L_5$ exists up to high inclinations of\nthe massless object. We report the results of numerical investigations on the\nstability of this librational motion for systematic variations in the\ninclination of the Trojan and the mass-ratio $\\mu$ of the two massive bodies.\nWe show that stable motion prevails for inclinations below 60 degrees and\nmass-ratios $\\mu < 0.04$ for typical integration times up to $10^6$ revolution\nperiods. At even higher mass-ratios -- beyond the critical mass-ratio for the\nplanar case -- stable orbits were found to exist for up to $10^7$ periods at\nmoderate inclinations. We extracted the librational frequencies on a grid in\nthe parameter space from the Fourier spectra and traced their variation.\nSeveral resonances between the short and long period librational frequency as\nwell as the vertical frequency lie inside the investigated region. The\napplication of the Lyapunov characteristic indicator and spectral number\nmethods also reveals the chaotic regions. This simple model is equally\napplicable in the Solar system for low mass ratios for Trojans of the planets,\nas well as to Trojan-type exoplanets in binary star systems at high\nmass-ratios.\n", "  A system of equations of anisotropic hydrodynamics that describes mixture of\nquark and gluon fluids is studied. The equations are based on the zeroth,\nfirst, and second moments of the RTA kinetic equations. Tests of this\nformulation are performed by comparing the results of anisotropic\nhydorodynamics with the exact solutions of the Boltzmann equations for a\nmixture of fluids in the Bjorken flow limit. One finds a very good agreement\nbetween the hydrodynamic and kinetic-theory results.\n", "  Over the last decade, significant attention has been drawn to the gender\nratio of speakers at conferences, and many meetings are evolving to better\nreflect the gender balance of the field as a whole. We find that women are\nsignificantly under-represented, however, among the astronomers asking\nquestions after talks.\n", "  The problem of finding null geodesics in a stationary Lorentzian spacetime is\nknown to to be equivalent to finding the geodsics of a Randers-Finlser\nstructure. This latter problem is equivalent to finding the motion of charged\nparticles moving on a Riemannian manifold in a background magnetic field or\nequivalently, by a generalization of Fermat's principle, to Zermelo's problem\nof extremizing travel time of an aeroplane in the presence of a wind. In this\npaper this triad of equivalences is extended to include recent model of the\nspread of a forest fire which uses form of Huyghen's principle. The\nconstruction may also be used to solve a problem in quantum control theory in\nwhich one seeks a control Hamiltonia taking an initial state of a quantum\nmechanical system with its own Hamiltonian to a desired final state in least\ntime.\n  The associated stationary spacetime may be thought of as defined on an\nextended quantum phase space (Souriau's evolution space), the space of quantum\nstares being complex projective space equipped with its Fubini-Study K\\\"ahler\nmetric. It is possible that this spacetime view point may provide insights\nrelevant for our understanding of quantum gravity.\n", "  Gapped $Z_{2}$ spin liquid as the simplest spin liquid has been proved to be\nthe most difficult to realize in realistic models. Here we show that the\nfrustration from a third-neighbor exchange $J_{3}$ on the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\n$J_{1}-J_{2}$ model on the square lattice may serve to stabilize such a\nlong-sought state. We argue that a Bosonic RVB description is more appropriate\nthan a Fermonic RVB description for such a gapped spin liquid phase. We show\nthat while the mean field ansatz of the proposed state has a $U(1)$ gauge\nsymmetry, the gauge fluctuation spectrum on it is actually gapped and the state\nshould be understood rather as a $Z_{2}$ spin liquid state with topological\norder. The state is thus locally stable with respect to gauge fluctuation and\ncan emerge continuously from a collinear Neel ordered phase.\n", "  To guarantee the integrity and security of data transmitted through the\nInternet, hash functions are fundamental tools. But recent researches have\nshown that security flaws exist in the most widely used hash functions. So a\nnew way to improve their security performance is urgently demanded. In this\narticle, we propose new hash functions based on chaotic iterations, which have\nchaotic properties as defined by Devaney. The corresponding diffusion and\nconfusion analyzes are provided and a comparative study between the proposed\nhash functions is carried out, to make their use more applicable in any\nsecurity context.\n", "  Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhances nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nsignals by transferring electron spin polarization to nuclei. As DNP requires\nmicrowave magnetic fields B1 strong enough to saturate electron spins,\nmicrowave resonators are generally used to achieve a sufficient B1, at the\nexpense of restricting the sample size. Higher fields improve NMR sensitivity\nand resolution. However, resonators at 9 T for example can only hold\nnano-liters (nL). Larger volumes are possible by avoiding resonators, but the\nhigher power needed to reach B1 is likely to evaporate the sample. Here, we\ndemonstrate a breakthrough in liquid state DNP at 9 T, boosting the sample size\nto the microliter range. We could use high-power (70 W) microwaves thanks to a\nplanar probe designed to alleviate dielectric heating. We enhanced the 1H NMR\nsignal intensity of 2 uL of liquid water by a factor of 14, while maintaining\nthe water temperature below 40 degree Celsius.\n", "  Dispersions of immiscible liquids, such as emulsions and polymer blends, are\nat the core of many industrial applications which makes the understanding of\ntheir properties (morphology, stability, etc.) of great interest. A wide range\nof these properties depend on interfacial phenomena, whose understanding is\ntherefore of particular importance. The behaviour of interfacial tension in\nemulsions and polymer blends is well-understood -both theoretically and\nexperimentally -in the case of non-reactive stabilization processes using\npre-made surfactants. However, this description of the interfacial tension\nbehaviour in reactive systems, where the stabilizing agents are created in-situ\n(and which is more efficient as a stabilization route for many systems), does\nnot yet find a consensus amongst the community. In this review, we compare the\ndifferent theories which have been developed for non-reactive and for reactive\nsystems, and we discuss their ability to capture the behaviour found\nexperimentally. Finally, we address the consequences of the reactive\nstabilization process both on the global emulsions or polymer blend\nmorphologies and at the interfacial scale.\n", "  The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program's SAG15 group has solicited,\ncollected, and organized community input on high-level science questions that\ncould be addressed with future direct imaging exoplanet missions and the type\nand quality of data answering these questions will require. Input was solicited\nthrough a variety of forums and the report draft was shared with the exoplanet\ncommunity continuously during the period of the report development (Nov 2015 --\nMay 2017). The report benefitted from the input of over 50 exoplanet scientists\nand from multiple open-forum discussions at exoplanet and astrobiology\nmeetings. The SAG15 team has identified three group of high-level questions,\nthose that focus on the properties of planetary systems (Questions A1--A2),\nthose that focus on the properties of individual planets (Questions B1--B4),\nand questions that relate to planetary processes (Questions C1--C4). The\nquestions in categories A, B, and C require different target samples and often\ndifferent observational approaches. For each questions we summarize the current\nbody of knowledge, the available and future observational approaches that can\ndirectly or indirectly contribute to answering the question, and provide\nexamples and general considerations for the target sample required.\n", "  We present very-high-energy $\\gamma$-ray observations of the BL Lac object\n1ES 2344+514 taken by the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array\nSystem (VERITAS) between 2007 and 2015. 1ES 2344+514 is detected with a\nstatistical significance above background of $20.8\\sigma$ in $47.2$ hours\n(livetime) of observations, making this the most comprehensive very-high-energy\nstudy of 1ES 2344+514 to date. Using these observations the temporal properties\nof 1ES 2344+514 are studied on short and long times scales. We fit a constant\nflux model to nightly- and seasonally-binned light curves and apply a\nfractional variability test, to determine the stability of the source on\ndifferent timescales. We reject the constant-flux model for the 2007-2008 and\n2014-2015 nightly-binned light curves and for the long-term seasonally-binned\nlight curve at the $> 3\\sigma$ level. The spectra of the time-averaged emission\nbefore and after correction for attenuation by the extragalactic background\nlight are obtained. The observed time-averaged spectrum above 200 GeV is\nsatisfactorily fitted (${\\chi^2/NDF = 7.89/6}$) by a power-law function with\nindex $\\Gamma = 2.46 \\pm 0.06_{stat} \\pm 0.20_{sys} $ and extends to at least 8\nTeV. The extragalactic-background-light-deabsorbed spectrum is adequately fit\n(${\\chi^2/NDF = 6.73/6}$) by a power-law function with index $\\Gamma = 2.15 \\pm\n0.06_{stat} \\pm 0.20_{sys} $ while an F-test indicates that the power-law with\nexponential cutoff function provides a marginally-better fit ($\\chi^2/NDF $ =\n$2.56 / 5 $) at the 2.1$\\sigma$ level. The source location is found to be\nconsistent with the published radio location and its spatial extent is\nconsistent with a point source.\n", "  We report high spatial resolution observations of the HI 21cm line in the\nCarina Nebula and the Gum 31 region obtained with the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array. The observations covered $\\sim$ 12 deg$^2$ centred on $l=\n287.5\\deg,b = -1\\deg$, achieving an angular resolution of $\\sim $ 35\narcseconds. The HI map revealed complex filamentary structures across a wide\nrange of velocities. Several \"bubbles\" are clearly identified in the Carina\nNebula Complex, produced by the impact of the massive star clusters located in\nthis region. An HI absorption profile obtained towards the strong extragalactic\nradio source PMN J1032--5917 showed the distribution of the cold component of\nthe atomic gas along the Galactic disk, with the Sagittarius-Carina and Perseus\nspiral arms clearly distinguishable. Preliminary calculations of the optical\ndepth and spin temperatures of the cold atomic gas show that the HI line is\nopaque ($\\tau \\gtrsim$ 2) at several velocities in the Sagittarius-Carina\nspiral arm. The spin temperature is $\\sim100$ K in the regions with the highest\noptical depth, although this value might be lower for the saturated components.\nThe atomic mass budget of Gum 31 is $\\sim35 \\%$ of the total gas mass. HI self\nabsorption features have molecular counterparts and good spatial correlation\nwith the regions of cold dust as traced by the infrared maps. We suggest that\nin Gum 31 regions of cold temperature and high density are where the atomic to\nmolecular gas phase transition is likely to be occurring.\n", "  The recent development of Liquid Phase Exfoliation (LPE) of 2D materials has\nenabled the formulation of inks with rheological properties adapted to numerous\nliquid deposition methods. This has allowed the fabrication of various types of\nprinted devices with unique features stemming from the nano-structure of the\nprinted 2D layers. In this short communication, we demonstrate that the\npreferred crystalline orientation of printed MoS2 flakes depends drastically\nupon the printing method employed to deposit the layers. Using angle resolved\nX-Ray Diffraction (XRD) to measure Pole Figure and subsequently calculate\nOrientation Distribution Functions (ODF), we show that the spin-coating method\nyields the best basal fiber texture, most likely because of the shear force at\nwork on the flakes during the deposition process. This interim report thereby\npaves the way to further investigations and fine control of the preferred\ncrystalline orientation of printed 2D flakes for the development of dedicated\ndevices.\n", "  New chaos-based communication schemes for transmission of analog and digital\ninformation are suggested. The carrier signal is produced by chaotic generator\nhaving well-defined oscillation phases at least on short time intervals. For\ndata extraction, a special procedure of phase detection for chaotic signals is\ndeveloped. An efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated by examples of coupled\ngenerators of structurally stable (robust) chaos with hyperbolic attractors of\nSmale-Williams and Arnold's \"cat map\" types. Robustness of the transmitter and\nthe receiver makes it possible to transmit information in presence of parameter\nmismatch or additive noise in the communication channel.\n", "  Research from a variety of fields including psychology and linguistics have\nfound correlations and patterns in personal attributes and behavior, but\nefforts to understand the broader heterogeneity in human behavior have not yet\nintegrated these approaches and perspectives with a cohesive methodology. Here\nwe extract patterns in behavior and relate those patterns together in a\nhigh-dimensional picture. We use dimension reduction to analyze word usage in\ntext data from the online discussion platform Reddit. We find that pronouns can\nbe used to characterize the space of the two most prominent dimensions that\ncapture the greatest differences in word usage, even though pronouns were not\nincluded in the determination of those dimensions. These patterns overlap with\npatterns of topics of discussion to reveal relationships between pronouns and\ntopics that can describe the user population. This analysis corroborates\nfindings from past research that have identified word use differences across\npopulations and synthesizes them relative to one another. We believe this is a\nstep toward understanding how differences between people are related to each\nother.\n", "  We review the results on the bottomonium system from the CMS experiment at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. Measurements have been carried out at different\ncenter-of-mass energies in proton collisions and in collisions involving heavy\nions. These include precision measurements of cross sections and polarizations,\nshedding light on hadroproduction mechanisms, and the observation of quarkonium\nsequential suppression, a notable indication of quark-gluon plasma formation.\nThe observation of the production of bottomonium pairs is also reported along\nwith searches for new states. We close with a brief outlook of the future\nphysics program.\n", "  Understanding magnetic field strength and morphology is very important for\nstudying astrophysical jets. Polarization signatures have been a standard way\nto probe the jet magnetic field. Radio and optical polarization monitoring\nprograms have been very successful in studying the space- and time-dependent\njet polarization behaviors. A new era is now arriving with high-energy\npolarimetry. X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray polarimetry can probe the most active jet\nregions with the most efficient particle acceleration. This new opportunity\nwill make a strong impact on our current understanding of jet systems. This\npaper summarizes the scientific potential and current model predictions for\nX-ray and $\\gamma$-ray polarization of astrophysical jets. In particular, we\ndiscuss the advantages of using high-energy polarimetry to constrain several\nimportant problems in the jet physics, including the jet radiation mechanisms,\nparticle acceleration mechanisms, and jet kinetic and magnetic energy\ncomposition. Here we take blazars as a study case, but the general approach can\nbe similarly applied to other astrophysical jets. We conclude that by comparing\ncombined magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), particle transport, and\npolarization-dependent radiation transfer simulations with multi-wavelength\ntime-dependent radiation and polarization observations, we will obtain the\nstrongest constraints and the best knowledge of jet physics.\n", "  In this work, we are developing the theoretical prototype and improving the\ntechnique for installing the Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) set up in\nautomobiles. We have considered a linear curve fit from a zigzag curve of\nreported mass flow rate and temperature variation at the hot gas inlet.\nAccordingly, the temperature of the coolant is also varied linearly at the\ninlet from 300 K to 320 K and corresponding the mass flow rate of coolant.\nCircular fin is installed around each circular layer of Thermoelectric\nMaterials (TEM) after the water jacket. The heat loss through each fin is\ncalculated as 24 W. Energy balance is done at each and every TEM and\ncorrespondingly calculated the amount of power transferred through each segment\nof TEG as 32 W. We have calculated the length of TEM sample for attaining the\nrespective temperature range for the hybrid of $Bi_2Te_3$ and $TiO_{1.1}$. This\ncalculation is done by considering the compatibility factor derived as $s\n=\\frac{\\sqrt{1+ ZT}-1}{\\alpha T}$ which is a ratio of current density to\nconduction heat flux. The length obtained for this particular combination is\n$\\sim$8 mm. To this end, we have reported the efficiency with respect to mass\nflow rate of hot flue gas from the automobile for different layers of TEG for\nthe above-mentioned combination. Here, we have explored the possibility of\ninstalling a number of different layers TEG module which can be installed\nthroughout the lateral surface area of exhaust chamber. Thermal mismatching\ncriteria are also discussed at the adjoining surface of TEM because of high\ntemperature. To maintain the thermal expansion or contraction of TEM, spring\nand bolt arrangement is provided, which is fixed over the aluminium oxide\nceramic substrate. For automobile, if temperature of source is considered as\n800 K, so for the temperature range of 300 K to 800 K the ideal power output is\nobtained as 58 W.\n", "  Asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes are quantum codes defined over\nbiased quantum channels: qubit-flip and phase-shift errors may have equal or\ndifferent probabilities. The code construction is the Calderbank-Shor-Steane\nconstruction based on two linear codes.\n  We present families of toric surfaces, toric codes and associated asymmetric\nquantum error-correcting codes.\n", "  We explore the use of orbital-angular-momentum (OAM)-multiplexing to increase\nthe capacity of free-space data transmission to moving platforms, with an added\npotential benefit of decreasing the probability of data intercept.\nSpecifically, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize the performance of\nan OAM-multiplexed, free-space optical (FSO) communications link between a\nground station and a moving unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV). We achieve a total\ncapacity of 80 Gbit/s up to 100-m-roundtrip link by multiplexing 2 OAM beams,\neach carrying a 40-Gbit/s quadrature-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) signal.\nMoreover, we investigate for static, hovering, and moving conditions the\neffects of channel impairments, including: tracking errors, propeller-induced\nairflows, power loss, intermodal crosstalk, and system bit error rate (BER). We\nfind the following: (a) when the UAV hovers in the air, the power on the\ndesired mode fluctuates by 2.1 dB, while the crosstalk to the other mode is -19\ndB below the power on the desired mode; and (b) when the UAV moves in the air,\nthe power fluctuation on the desired mode increases to 4.3 dB and the crosstalk\nto the other mode increases to -10 dB. Furthermore, the channel crosstalk\ndecreases with an increase in OAM mode spacing.\n", "  Electron-spin relaxation at different surfaces of p-doped GaAs is\ninvestigated by means of spin, time and energy resolved 2-photon photoemission.\nThese results are contrasted with bulk results obtained by time-resolved\nFaraday rotation measurements as well as calculations of the Bir-Aronov-Pikus\nspin-flip mechanism. Due to the reduced hole density in the band bending region\nat the (100) surface the spin-relaxation time increases over two orders of\nmagnitude towards lower energies. At the flat-band (011) surface a constant\nspin relaxation time in agreement with our measurements and calculations for\nbulk GaAs is obtained.\n", "  A procedure based on the semiclassical approximation for high energy levels\nis developed to yield solutions to the classical equation of charge motion and\nto the Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi spin equation. To this end, exact solutions to\nthe Klein-Gordon and the Dirac-Pauli equations are used. The essence of the\nprocedure under review is that the quantum state of a charged particle in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field is represented as a superposition of states\ncorresponding to the neighboring energy levels. As a consequence, the behavior\nof the expectation values of the momentum and spin operators with respect to\nthe resulting nonstationary wave function (packet) strictly obey the classical\nequations of charge motion and spin precession.\n", "  The structural composition and the properties of the first quantum\nspin-orientation-dependent correction to synchrotron radiation power are\ndiscussed. On the basis of spin mass renormalization it is shown that, in the\nconventional sence, the Thomas precession is not a source of relativistic\nradiation. This conclusion is in agreement with well-known statements on the\nspin dependence of mass and purely kinematic origin of Thomas precession.\n"]}
