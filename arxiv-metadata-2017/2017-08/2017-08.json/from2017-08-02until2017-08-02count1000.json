quantum\nsystem can be when the subspace contains only highly entangled states. This is\nmotivated in part by results of Hayden et al., which show that in large d x\nd--dimensional systems there exist random subspaces of dimension almost d^2,\nall of whose states have entropy of entanglement at least log d - O(1). It is\nalso related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely\nentangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of\nunextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt\nrank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r,\nthe largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of\nSchmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the\nbest bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also\ndetermine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound\non the Schmidt rank. Finally, we discuss the question of subspaces containing\nonly states with Schmidt equal to r.\n", "  Supernova remnant (SNR) blast shells can reach the flow speed $v_s = 0.1 c$\nand shocks form at its front. Instabilities driven by shock-reflected ion beams\nheat the plasma in the foreshock, which may inject particles into diffusive\nacceleration. The ion beams can have the speed $v_b \\approx v_s$. For $v_b \\ll\nv_s$ the Buneman or upper-hybrid instabilities dominate, while for $v_b \\gg\nv_s$ the filamentation and mixed modes grow faster. Here the relevant waves for\n$v_b \\approx v_s$ are examined and how they interact nonlinearly with the\nparticles. The collision of two plasma clouds at the speed $v_s$ is modelled\nwith particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, which convect with them magnetic\nfields oriented perpendicular to their flow velocity vector. One simulation\nmodels equally dense clouds and the other one uses a density ratio of 2. Both\nsimulations show upper-hybrid waves that are planar over large spatial\nintervals and that accelerate electrons to $\\sim$ 10 keV. The symmetric\ncollision yields only short oscillatory wave pulses, while the asymmetric\ncollision also produces large-scale electric fields, probably through a\nmagnetic pressure gradient. The large-scale fields destroy the electron phase\nspace holes and they accelerate the ions, which facilitates the formation of a\nprecursor shock.\n", "  We discuss the connection between the chemistry of dense interstellar clouds\nand those characteristics of cometary matter that could be remnants of it. The\nchemical evolution observed to occur in molecular clouds is summarized and a\nmodel for dense core collapse that can plausibly account for the isotopic\nfractionation of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and carbon measured in primitive\nsolar system materials is presented.\n", "  Solar cycle 23 witnessed the observation of hundreds of halo coronal mass\nejections (CMEs), thanks to the high dynamic range and extended field of view\nof the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. More than two thirds of halo CMEs\noriginating on the front side of the Sun have been found to be geoeffective\n(Dst =< -50 nT). The delay time between the onset of halo CMEs and the peak of\nensuing geomagnetic storms has been found to depend on the solar source\nlocation (Gopalswamy et al., 2007). In particular, limb halo CMEs (source\nlongitude > 45deg) have a 20% shorter delay time on the average. It was\nsuggested that the geomagnetic storms due to limb halos must be due to the\nsheath portion of the interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) so that the shorter delay\ntime can be accounted for. We confirm this suggestion by examining the sheath\nand ejecta portions of ICMEs from Wind and ACE data that correspond to the limb\nhalos. Detailed examination showed that three pairs of limb halos were\ninteracting events. Geomagnetic storms following five limb halos were actually\nproduced by other disk halos. The storms followed by four isolated limb halos\nand the ones associated with interacting limb halos, were all due to the sheath\nportions of ICMEs.\n", "  We review relationships between coronal mass ejections (CMEs), EIT post\neruption arcades, and the coronal neutral line associated with global magnetic\nfield and magnetic clouds near the Earth. Our previous findings indicate that\nthe orientation of a halo CME elongation may correspond to the orientation of\nthe underlyig flux rope. Here we revisit these preliminary reports by comparing\norientation angles of elongated LASCO CMEs, both full and partial halos, to the\npost eruption arcades. Based on 100 analysed events, it was found that the\noverwhelming majority of halo CMEs are elongated in the direction of the axial\nfield of the post eruptio arcades. Moreover, this conclusion also holds for\npartial halo CMEs as well as for events that originate further from the disk\ncenter. This suggests that the projection effect does not drastically change\nthe appearance of full and partial halos and their imagesstill bear reliable\ninformation about the underlying magnetic fields. We also compared orientations\nof the erupted fields near the Sun and in the interplanetary space and found\nthat the local tiltof the coronal neutral line at 2.5 solar radii is well\ncorrelated with the magnetic cloud axis measured near the Earth. We suggest\nthat the heliospheric magnetic fields significantly affect the propagating\nejecta. Sometimes, the ejecta may even rotate so that its axis locally aligns\nitself with the heliospheric current sheet.\n", "  On the basis of the exact relations the general formula for the static\ndielectric permittivity for Coulomb system is found in the region of small wave\nvectors. The obtained formula describes the dielectric function of the Coulomb\nsystem in both limits: in the \"metallic\" state and in the \"dielectric\" one. On\nthis basis the determinations of the \"apparent\" dielectric and the \"apparent\"\nradius of screening are introduced. In the random phase approximation (RPA) the\nexact relations for the function dielectric function of the electron gas in the\nlong-wavelength region of the wave vectors are found for an arbitrary\ndegeneration of the particles.\n", "  Undulatory locomotion, as seen in the nematode \\emph{Caenorhabditis elegans},\nis a common swimming gait of organisms in the low Reynolds number regime, where\nviscous forces are dominant. While the nematode's motility is expected to be a\nstrong function of its material properties, measurements remain scarce. Here,\nthe swimming behavior of \\emph{C.} \\emph{elegans} are investigated in\nexperiments and in a simple model. Experiments reveal that nematodes swim in a\nperiodic fashion and generate traveling waves which decay from head to tail.\nThe model is able to capture the experiments' main features and is used to\nestimate the nematode's Young's modulus $E$ and tissue viscosity $\\eta$. For\nwild-type \\emph{C. elegans}, we find $E\\approx 3.77$ kPa and $\\eta \\approx-860$\nPa$\\cdot$s; values of $\\eta$ for live \\emph{C. elegans} are negative because\nthe tissue is generating rather than dissipating energy. Results show that\nmaterial properties are sensitive to changes in muscle functional properties,\nand are useful quantitative tools with which to more accurately describe new\nand existing muscle mutants.\n", "  The solar transition region (TR), in which above the photosphere the tempera-\nture increases rapidly and the density drops dramatically, is believed to play\nan important role in coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. Long-lasting\nup-flows are present in the upper TR and interpreted as signatures of mass\nsupply to large coronal loops in the quiet Sun. Coronal bright points (BPs) are\nlocal heating phenomena and we found a different Doppler-shift pattern at TR\nand coronal temperatures in one BP, which might be related to the twisted loop\nsystem. The dominant energy loss in the lower TR is the Ly-alpha emission. It\nhas been found that most Ly-alpha radiance profiles are stronger in the blue\npeak, an asymmetry opposite to higher order Lyman lines. This asymmetry is\nstronger when the downflow in the middle TR is stronger, indicating that the TR\nflows play an important role in the line formation process. The peak separation\nof Ly-alpha is found to be larger in coronal holes than in the quiet Sun,\nreflecting the different magnetic structures and radiation fields between the\ntwo regions. The Lyman line profiles are found to be not reversed in sunspot\nplume and umbra regions, while they are obviously reversed in the surrounding\nplage region. At TR temperatures, the densities of the sunspot plume and umbra\nare a factor of 10 lower than of the plage, indicating that the sunspot plasma\nemitting at TR temperatures is higher and possibly more extended above sunspots\nthan above the plage region.\n", "  We deduce on hourly basis the spatial gradient of the cosmic ray density in\nthree dimensions from the directional anisotropy of high-energy (~50 GeV)\ngalactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity observed with a global network of muon\ndetectors on the Earth's surface. By analyzing the average features of the\ngradient in the corotational interaction regions (CIRs) recorded in successive\ntwo solar activity minimum periods, we find that the observed latitudinal\ngradient (Gz) changes its sign from negative to positive on the Earth's\nheliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing from the northern to the southern\nhemisphere in A<0 epoch, while it changes from positive to negative in A>0\nepoch. This is in accordance with the drift prediction. We also find a negative\nenhancement in Gx after the HCS crossing in both A<0 and A>0 epochs, but not in\nGy. This asymmetrical feature of Gx and Gy indicates significant contributions\nfrom the parallel and perpendicular diffusions to the the gradient in CIRs in\naddition to the contribution from the drift effect.\n", "  A recently proposed method of constructing seismic networks from 'record\nbreaking events' from the earthquake catalog of California (Phy. Rev. E, 77\n6,066104, 2008) was successfull in establishing causal features to seismicity\nand arrive at estimates for rupture length and its scaling with magnitude. The\nresults of our implementation of this procedure on the earthquake catalog of\nJapan establishes the robustness of the procedure. Additionally, we find that\nthe temporal distributions are able to detect heterogeneties in the seismicity\nof the region.\n", "  The origin of the atmosphere of the largest moon of Saturn, Titan, is poorly\nunderstood and its chemistry is rather complicated. Ground-based\nmillimeter/sub-millimeter heterodyne spectroscopy resolves line shapes\nsufficiently to determine information in Titan's atmospheric composition (on\nvertical profiles and isotopic ratios). We test the capabilities of the Swedish\nHeterodyne Facility Instrument (SHFI), Receiver APEX-1, together with the\nAtacama Pathfinder EXperiment APEX 12-m telescope for Titan's atmospheric\nobservations. In particular we present sub-millimeter observations of the\nCO(2-1) and HCN(3-2) lines of the Titan stratosphere with APEX, and with SHFI\ntaken during the Science Verification (SV) instrument phase on March and June\n2008. With the help of appropriate radiative transfer calculations we\ninvestigate the possibility to constrain the chemical concentrations and\noptimize the performance of the APEX-1 instrument for inferring vertical\nprofiles of molecular components of the atmosphere of Titan.\n", "  Intense solar energetic particle (SEP) events data, associated with ground\nlevel enhancements (GLEs), occurred during 1989 to 2006 have been obtained from\nthe spectrometers on board GOES spacecraft in the energy range 10-100 MeV. The\ninterplanetary effects of these events and their associated coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) have been provided by the LASCO/SOHO coronagraph images in the\nfield of view of 2-30 {\\rsun} and the interplanetary scintillation images from\nthe Ooty Radio Telescope in the heliocentric distance range of $\\sim$40-250\nR$_\\odot$. The comparison between the radial evolution of the CME and its\nassociated particle spectrum shows that the spectrum is soft at the onset of\nthe particle event. A flat spectrum is observed at the peak of the particle\nevent and the spectrum becomes steeper as the CME moves farther out into the\ninner heliosphere. However, the magnitude of change in spectral slopes differs\nfrom one CME to the other, suggesting the difference in energy available within\nthe CME to drive the shock. The spectral index evolution as a function of\ninitial speed of the CME at different parts of the particle profile has also\nbeen compared. The result shows that the change in particle flux with time is\nrather quick for the high-energy portion of the spectrum than that of the\nlow-energy part, which makes the steepening of the energy spectrum with\ntime/distance from the Sun. It indicates that the acceleration of particles by\na CME-driven shock may be efficient at low energies ($\\leq$30 MeV) and the\nefficiency of the shock decreases gradually towards the high-energy side of the\nspectrum.\n", "  Magnetic twist of the active region has been measured over a decade using\nphotospheric vector field data, chromospheric H_alpha data, and coronal loop\ndata. The twist and tilt of the active regions have been measured at the\nphotospheric level with the vector magnetic field measurements. The active\nregion NOAA 10930 is a highly twisted emerging region. The same active region\nproduced several flares and has been extensively observed by Hinode. In this\npaper, we will show the evolution of twist and tilt in this active region\nleading up to the two X-class flares. We find that the twist initially\nincreases with time for a few days with a simultaneous decrease in the tilt\nuntil before the X3.4 class flare on December 13, 2006. The total twist\nacquired by the active region is larger than one complete winding before the\nX3.4 class flare and it decreases in later part of observations. The injected\nhelicity into the corona is negative and it is in excess of 10^43 Mx^2 before\nthe flares.\n", "  SARA experiment aboard the first Indian lunar mission Chandrayaan-1 had the\nobjective to explore the solar wind-lunar interaction using energetic neutral\natoms (ENA) from the lunar surface as diagnostic tool. SARA consisted of an ENA\nimaging mass analyzer CENA (Chandrayaan-1 Energetic Neutral Analyzer) and an\nion mass analyser SWIM (Solar Wind Monitor), along with a digital processing\nunit (DPU) which commands and controls the sensors and provides the interface\nto the spacecraft. Both sensors have provided excellent observational data.\nCENA has observed ENAs from the lunar surface and found that ~20% of the\nincident solar wind ions get backscattered as ENAs from the lunar surface. This\nis contrary to the previous assumptions of almost complete absorption of solar\nwind by the lunar surface. The observation is relevant for other airless bodies\nin the solar system.\n", "  The Radiation Monitor (RADOM) payload is a miniature dosimeter-spectrometer\nonboard Chandrayaan-1 mission for monitoring the local radiation environment in\nnear-Earth space and in lunar space. RADOM measured the total absorbed dose and\nspectrum of the deposited energy from high energy particles in near-Earth\nspace, en-route and in lunar orbit. RADOM was the first experiment to be\nswitched on soon after the launch of Chandrayaan-1 and was operational till the\nend of the mission. This paper summarizes the observations carried out by RADOM\nduring the entire life time of the Chandrayaan-1 mission and some the salient\nresults.\n", "  We study the active region NOAA 10960, which produces two flare events (B5.0,\nM8.9) on 04 June 2007. We find the observational signature of right handed\nhelical twists in the loop system associated with this active region. The first\nB5.0 flare starts with the activation of helical twist showing ~3 turns.\nHowever, after ~20 minutes another helical twist (with ~2 turns) appears, which\ntriggers M8.9 flare. Both helical structures were closely associated with a\nsmall positive polarity sunspot in the AR. We interpret these observations as\nevidence of kink instability, which triggers the recurrent solar flares.\n", "  Using data from observations made with XMM-Newton, we present an X-ray\nanalysis of two flares observed in $\\xi$ Boo. The flare loop parameters are\nderived using various loop models including state-of-the-art hydrodynamic flare\nmodel. The loop lengths derived for the flaring loop structure are found to be\nless than the stellar radius. The exponential decay of the X-ray light curves,\nand time evolution of the plasma temperature and emission measure are similar\nto those observed in compact solar flares. The X-ray light curve of post flare\nphase is investigated with wavelet analysis. Wavelet analysis clearly show\noscillations of the period of 1019 s. Using the observationally estimated loop\nlength, density and magnetic field, the theoretically derived oscillation\nperiod for fast-kink mode approximately matches with the observationally\nestimated period. This is the first likely observational evidence of\nfundamental fast-kink mode of magnetoacoustic waves in the stellar loops during\nthe post-flare phase of heightened emission.\n", "  The possibility of the precise measurement of the electron beam energy using\nabsorption of radiation by electrons in a static and homogeneous magnetic field\nin a range up to a few hundred GeV energies, was considered in [1]. With the\npurpose of experimental checking of this method in a range of several tens MeV\nenergies, the possibility of measurement of absolute energy of the electron\nbeam energy with relative accuracy up to 10^{-4} is examined in details.\n", "  We show how the generator of local supersymmetry transformations can be found\nfrom Fermionic first class constraints. This is done by adapting the approaches\nof Henneaux, Teit- elboim and Zanelli and of Castellani that has been used to\nfind the generator of gauge trans- formations from Bosonic first class\nconstraints. We illustrate how a supersymmetric gauge generator can be found by\nconsidering the spinning particle. The invariances that we find are not those\npresented in the original discussion of the spinning particle.\n", "  The exact Dirac equation for the energy-dependent Coulomb (EDC) potential\nincluding a Coulomb-like tensor (CLT) potential has been studied in the\npresence of spin and pseudospin (p-spin) symmetries with arbitrary spin-orbit\nquantum number The energy eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions are\nobtained in the framework of asymptotic iteration method (AIM). Some numerical\nresults are obtained in the presence and absence of EDC and CLT potentials.\n", "  System of the quantum Langevin equations for two quantum coupling oscillators\nwithin independent heat baths of quantum oscillators are obtained using a model\nHamiltonian and corresponding Heisenberg equations of motion. Expressions for\nmean energy of coupled oscillators and their mean energy of interaction are\nderived and analyzed. Nonmonotonic dependence of the interaction energy versus\na coupling constant is demonstrated and explained. Nontrivial dependence of the\nquantities as a consequence of the difference in temperatures of heat baths is\nshown.\n", "  For nearly a half century the dominant orthodoxy has been that the only\neffect of the Cooper pairing is the state with zero resistivity at finite\ntemperatures, superconductivity. In this work we demonstrate that by the\nsymmetry of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relating the amplitude and\nphase of the superconducting order parameter, Cooper pairing can generate the\ndual state with zero conductivity in the finite temperature range,\nsuperinsulation. We show that this duality realizes in the planar Josephson\njunction arrays (JJA) via the duality between the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the vortex-antivortex\nplasma, resulting in phase-coherent superconductivity below the transition\ntemperature, and the charge-BKT transition occurring in the insulating state of\nJJA and marking formation of the low-temperature charge-BKT state,\nsuperinsulation. We find that in disordered superconducting films that are on\nthe brink of superconductor-insulator transition the Coulomb forces between the\ncharges acquire two-dimensional character, i.e. the corresponding interaction\nenergy depends logarithmically upon charge separation, bringing the same\nvortex-charge-BKT transition duality, and realization of superinsulation in\ndisordered films as the low-temperature charge-BKT state. Finally, we discuss\npossible applications and utilizations of superconductivity-superinsulation\nduality.\n", "  The correspondence principle offered a unique opportunity to test the\nHorowitz and Maldacena mechanism at correspondence point \"the centre of mass\nenergies around $(M_{s}/(g_{s})^{2})$\". First by using Horowitz and Maldacena\nproposal, the black hole final state for closed strings is studied and the\nentropy of these states is calculated.Then, to consider the closed string\nstates, a copy of the original Hilbert space is constructed with a set of\noperators of creation/anihilation that have the same commutation properties as\nthe original ones. The total Hilbert space is the tensor product of the two\nspaces $H_{right}\\otimes H_{left}$, where in this case $H_{left/right}$ denotes\nthe physical quantum states space of the closed string .It is shown that closed\nstring states can be represented by a maximally entangled two-mode squeezed\nstate of the left and right spaces of closed string. Also, the entropy for\nthese string states is calculated.It is found that black hole entropy matches\nthe closed string entropy at transition point.This means that our result is\nconsistent with correspondence principle and thus HM mechanism in string theory\nworks . Consequently the unitarity of the black hole in string theory can be\nreconciled.However Gottesman and Preskill point out that, in this scenario,\ndepartures from unitarity can arise due to interactions between the collapsing\nbody and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon and\ninformation can be lost. By extending the Gottesman and Preskill method to\nstring theory, the amount of information transformation from the matter to the\nstate of outgoing Hagedorn radiation for closed strings is obtained.It is\nobserved that information is lost for closed strings.\n", "  In this paper, we present the Dirac equation for the Mobius-square-Yukawa\npotentials including the tensor interaction term within the framework of\npseudospin and spin symmetry limit with arbitrary spin-orbit quantum number .\nWe obtained the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions using\nthe supersymmetry method. The limiting cases of this potential model reduce to\nthe Deng-Fan, Yukawa and Coulomb potentials, respectively\n", "  We define the total energy-momenta for (4+1)-dimensional asymptotically\nanti-de Sitter spacetimes, and prove the positive energy theorem for such\nspacetimes.\n", "  We present a new, fully anisotropic, criterion for formation of trapped\nsurfaces in vacuum. More precisely we provide conditions on null data,\nconcentrated in a neighborhood of a short null geodesic segment (possibly flat\neverywhere else) whose future development contains a trapped surface. This\nextends considerably the previous result of Christodoulou \\cite{Chr:book} which\nrequired instead a uniform condition along all null geodesic generators. To\nobtain our result we combine Christodoulou's mechanism for the formation of a\ntrapped surface with a new deformation process which takes place along incoming\nnull hypersurfaces.\n", "  We propose a phenomenological approach for the equation of state of a unitary\nFermi gas. The universal equation of state is parametrised in terms of\nFermi-Dirac integrals. This reproduces the experimental data over the\naccessible range of fugacity and normalised temperature, but cannot describe\nthe superfluid phase transition found in the MIT experiment \\cite{ku}. The most\nsensitive data for compressibility and specific heat at phase transition can,\nhowever, befitted by introducing into the grand partition function a pair of\ncomplex conjugate zeros lying in the complex fugacity plane slightly off the\nreal axis.\n", "  We review the current status of point contact spectroscopy on the iron based\nsuperconductors, focusing on their normal state. Point contact spectroscopy is\ngenerally used to study superconductors via Andreev reflection, but in recent\nyears it has also proved to be a useful bulk probe of strongly correlated\nelectron systems. Point contact spectroscopy picks up a conductance enhancement\nin the normal state, above the structural phase transition, of certain iron\nbased compounds. These include Co doped $\\rm{BaFe_2As_2}$, $\\rm{SrFe_2As_2}$,\n$\\rm{Fe_{1+y}Te}$ and F doped $\\rm{SmFeAsO}$ and $\\rm{LaFeAsO}$. Two materials\nwhich do not show this conductance enhancement are $\\rm{CaFe_2As_2}$ and K\ndoped $\\rm{BaFe_2As_2}$. This conductance enhancement is thought to be tied to\norbital fluctuations. Orbital fluctuations in the normal state of these\ncompounds increases the single particle density of states at the Fermi level,\nindicating that PCS is sensitive to this excess density of states. The\nenhancement is only observed at those temperatures and dopings where an\nin-plane resisitve anisotropy in the detwinned compounds is known to occur.\nThus point contact spectroscopy provides strong indications of electronic\nnematicity in such materials. We also present diagnostics on how to judge if a\njunction is impacted by joule heating or not. We conclude with the outstanding\nchallenges in the field and the new experiments that need to be carried out.\n", "  Exploratory synthesis efforts for iron-based superconductors (FeSC) have been\ndriven by hopes of improving superconducting critical temperatures (TCs),\nproviding high-quality samples for in-depth studies of intrinsic properties,\nand exploring potential superconductivity in similar families of materials.\nThis manuscript summarizes the synthesis routes that are used for producing\nFeSC and their undoped parents, in single crystal and polycrystalline forms. A\nfew of the materials challenges are summarized.\n", "  Hydrogen is the simplest bipolar element and its valence state can be\ncontrolled from +1 to -1. We synthesized the 1111-type CaFeAsH and LnFeAsO1-xHx\n(Ln = lanthanide) with the ZrCuSiAs type structure by a high-pressure synthesis\nmethod. The position and valence state of the substituted H were determined by\nneutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The close\nsimilarity in the structural and electrical properties of CaFeAsH and CaFeAsF\nindicated the formation of the hydride ion (H-), which is isovalent with the\nfluoride ion (F-), in the 1111-type iron arsenides. When some of the O2- ions\nin LnFeAsO are replaced by H-, superconductivity is induced by electron doping\nto the FeAs-layer to maintain charge neutrality. Since the substitution limit\nof hydrogen in LnFeAsO (x~0.5) is much higher than that of fluorine (x~0.2),\nthe hydrogen substitution technique provides an effective pathway for\nhigh-density electron-doping, making it possible to draw the complete\nelectronic phase diagram of LnFeAsO. The x-T diagrams of LnFeAsO1-xHx (Ln = La,\nCe, Sm, Gd) have a wide superconducting (SC) region spanning the range x = 0.04\nto 0.4, which is far from the parent antiferromagnetic region near x = 0.0. For\nLn=La, another SC dome region was found in the range x = ~ 0.2 to ~0.5 with a\nmaximum Tc = 36 K, in addition to a conventional SC dome located at x ~0.08\nwith maximum Tc = 29 K. Density functional theory calculations performed for\nLaFeAsO1-xHx indicated that the newly observed Tc is correlated with the\nappearance of degeneration of the Fe 3d bands (dxy, dyz and dzx), which is\ncaused not only by regularization of the tetrahedral shape of FeAs4 due to\nchemical pressure effects but also by selective band occupation with doped\nelectrons. In this article, we review the recent progress of superconductivity\nin iron (oxy)arsenides and related compounds induced by hydrogen substitution.\n", "  We have studied the production of single isolated prompt photons in high\nenergy proton-proton collisions at the RHIC ($\\sqrt{s}$= 200 GeV) and the LHC\n($\\sqrt{s}$= 7 TeV) energies within the frame work of perturbative QCD upto\nnext-to leading order of strong coupling ($\\alpha_s$). We have used five\ndifferent parameterizations of parton distribution function (PDF) starting from\nthe old CTEQ4M to the new CT10 distributions and compared our results with the\nrecent single prompt photon data from the PHENIX and the CMS collaborations.\nThe prompt photon cross-section is found to be described equally well by all\nthe PDF's within the experimental errors at the RHIC and the LHC energies. The\ndeviation in the prompt photon yield for different PDF sets is within $\\pm$ 20%\nwhen compared to CTEQ4M. The diphoton measurement could be a potential\ncandidate to constrain the gluon distribution inside the proton.\n", "  We study coherent quantum control strategy which is robust with respect to\ncoupling with an external environment. We model this interaction by appending\nan additional subsystem to the initial system and we choose the strength of the\ncoupling to be proportional to the magnitude of the control pulses. Therefore,\nto minimize the interaction we impose $L_1$ norm restrictions on the control\npulses. In order to efficiently solve this optimization problem we employ the\nBFGS algorithm. We use three different functions as the derivative of the $L1$\nnorm of control pulses: the signum function, a fractional derivative\n$\\frac{\\dd^\\alpha |x|}{\\dd x^\\alpha}$, where $0<\\alpha<1$, and the Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution. We show that our method allows to efficiently obtain the control\npulses which neglect the coupling with an external environment.\n", "  With the advent of the ability to create and study antihydrogen, we think it\nis appropriate to consider the possibility that antiphotons might not be\nidentical to photons. First of all, we will look at the experimental evidence\nconcerning multiple neutral pions and multiple photons. Because of its internal\nstructure, the neutral kaon is not identical to its antiparticle. We will\nconsider internal structures for the neutral pion and photon for which the\nantiparticle differs from the particle. Interestingly, the antiphoton thus\ncreated from neutrinos does not interact with electrons because its neutrinos\nhave the wrong helicity.\n", "  We implement an efficient strong-disorder renormalization-group (SDRG)\nprocedure to study disordered tight-binding models in any dimension and on the\nErdos-Renyi random graphs, which represent an appropriate infinite dimensional\nlimit. Our SDRG algorithm is based on a judicious elimination of most\n(irrelevant) new bonds generated under RG. It yields excellent agreement with\nexact numerical results for universal properties at the critical point without\nsignificant increase of computer time, and confirm that, for Anderson\nlocalization, the upper critical dimension duc = infinite. We find excellent\nconvergence of the relevant 1/d expansion down to d=2, in contrast to the\nconventional 2+epsilon expansion, which has little to say about what happens in\nany d>3. We show that the mysterious mirror symmetry of the conductance scaling\nfunction is a genuine strong-coupling effect, as speculated in early work. This\nopens an efficient avenue to explore the critical properties of Anderson\ntransition in the strong-coupling limit in high dimensions.\n", "  Mutual information is the reciprocal information that is common to or shared\nby two or more parties. Quantum mutual information for bipartite quantum\nsystems is non-negative, and bears the interpretation of total correlation\nbetween the two subsystems. This may, however, no longer be true for three or\nmore party quantum systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative definition\nof multipartite information taking into account the shared information between\ntwo and more parties. It is non-negative, observes monotonicity under partial\ntrace as well as completely positive maps, and equals multipartite information\nmeasure in literature for pure states. We then define multiparty quantum\ndiscord, and give some examples. Interestingly, we observe that quantum discord\nincreases when measurement is performed on a large number of subsystems.\nConsequently, the symmetric quantum discord, which involves measurement on all\nparties, reveals the maximal quantumness. This raises question on the\ninterpretation of measured mutual information as classical correlation.\n", "  The electronic and magnetic properties of Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$ containing\nIr-Ir dimers are investigated using the GGA and GGA+SOC calculations. We found\nthat strong suppression of the magnetic moment in this compound recently found\nin [J. Terzic {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 91}, 235147 (2015)] is not due to\ncharge-ordering, but is related to the joint effect of the spin-orbit\ninteraction and strong covalency, resulting in the formation of metal-metal\nbonds. They conspire and act against the intra-atomic Hund's rule exchange\ninteraction to reduce total magnetic moment of the dimer. We argue that the\nsame mechanism could be relevant for other $4d$ and $5d$ dimerized transition\nmetal compounds.\n", "  Plasmonic antennas integrated on silicon devices have large and yet\nunexplored potential for controlling and routing light signals. Here, we\npresent theoretical calculations of a hybrid silicon-metallic system in which a\nsingle gold nanoantenna embedded in a single-mode silicon waveguide acts as a\nresonance-driven filter. As a consequence of scattering and interference, when\nthe resonance condition of the antenna is met, the transmission drops by 85% in\nthe resonant frequency band. Firstly, we study analytically the interaction\nbetween the propagating mode and the antenna by including radiative corrections\nto the scattering process and the polarization of the waveguide walls.\nSecondly, we find the configuration of maximum interaction and numerically\nsimulate a realistic nanoantenna in a silicon waveguide. The numerical\ncalculations show a large suppression of transmission and three times more\nscattering than absorption, consequent with the analytical model. The system we\npropose can be easily fabricated by standard silicon and plasmonic lithographic\nmethods, making it promising as real component in future optoelectronic\ncircuits.\n", "  The recent advance in the assembly of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) has\nenabled sophisticated engineering of unprecedented light-matter interaction at\nthe optical domain. In this work, I expand the design flexibility of NP optical\nmetamaterial to push the upper limit of accessible refractive index to the\nunnaturally high regime. The precise control over the geometrical parameters of\nNP superlattice monolayer conferred the dramatic increase in electric resonance\nand related effective permittivity far beyond the naturally accessible regime.\nSimultaneously, effective permeability, another key factor to achieving high\nrefractive index, was effectively suppressed by reducing the thickness of NPs.\nBy establishing this design rule, I have achieved unnaturally high refractive\nindex (15.7 at the electric resonance and 7.3 at the quasi-static limit) at\nbroadband optical frequencies (100 THz ~ 300 THz). I also combined this NP\nmetamaterial with graphene to electrically control the high refractive index\nover the broad optical frequencies.\n", "  It is very controversial whether radio--X-ray correlation as defined in LH\nstate of XRBs can extend to quiescent state (e.g., X-ray luminosity less than a\ncritical value of $L_{\\rm X,c} \\sim10^{-5.5}L_{\\rm Edd}$) or not. In this work,\nwe collect a sample of XRBs and low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs)\nwith wide distribution of Eddington ratios to reexplore the fundamental plane\nbetween 5 GHz radio luminosity, $L_{\\rm R}$, 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity, $L_{\\rm\nX}$, and black hole (BH) mass, $M_{\\rm BH}$, namely $\\log L_{\\rm R}=\\xi_{\\rm X}\n\\log L_{\\rm X}+\\xi_{\\rm M}\\log M_{\\rm BH}+\\rm constant$. For the whole sample,\nwe confirm the former fundamental plane of Merloni et al. and Falcke et al.\nthat $\\xi_{\\rm X}\\sim 0.6$ and $\\xi_{\\rm M}\\sim 0.8$ even after including more\nquiescent BHs. The quiescent BHs follow the fundamental plane very well, and,\nhowever, FR I radio galaxies follow a steeper track comparing other BH sources.\nAfter excluding FR Is, we investigate the fundamental plane for BHs in\nquiescent state with $L_{\\rm X}< L_{\\rm X,c}$ and sub-Eddington BHs with\n$L_{\\rm X}> L_{\\rm X,c}$ respectively, and both subsamples have a similar\nslope, $\\xi_{\\rm X}\\sim0.6$, which support that quiescent BHs may behave\nsimilar to those in low-hard state. We further select two subsamples of AGNs\nwith BH mass in a narrow range (FR Is with $M_{\\rm BH}=10^{8.8\\pm0.4}$ and\nother LLAGNs with $M_{\\rm BH}=10^{8.0\\pm0.4}$) to simulate the behavior of a\nsingle supermassive BH evolving from sub-Eddington to quiescent state. We find\nthat the highly sub-Eddington sources with $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm\nEdd}\\sim10^{-6}-10^{-9}$ still roughly stay on the extension of radio--X-ray\ncorrelation as defined by other sub-Eddington BHs. Our results are consistent\nwith several recent observations in XRBs that the radio--X-ray correlation as\ndefined in low-hard state can extend to highly sub-Eddington quiescent state.\n", "  We use the linear sigma model coupled to quarks, together with a plausible\nlocation of the critical end point (CEP), to study the chiral symmetry\ntransition in the QCD phase diagram. We compute the effective potential at\nfinite temperature and density up to the contribution of the ring diagrams,\nboth in the low and high temperature limits, and use it to compute the pressure\nand the position of the CEP. In the high temperature regime, by comparing to\nresults from extrapolated lattice data, we determine the model coupling\nconstants. Demanding that the CEP remains in the same location when described\nin the high temperature limit, we determine again the couplings and the\npressure for the low temperature regime. We show that this procedure gives an\naverage description of the lattice QCD results for the pressure and that the\nchange from the low to the high temperature domains in this quantity can be\nattributed to the change in the coupling constants which in turn we link to the\nchange in the effective degrees of freedom.\n", "  The ArgoNeuT collaboration reports the first measurement of neutral current\n$\\pi^{0}$ production in $\\nu_{\\mu}$-argon and $\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$-argon\nscattering. This measurement was performed using the ArgoNeuT liquid argon time\nprojection chamber deployed at Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beam with an exposure\ncorresponding to 1.2$\\times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target from the Fermilab Main\nInjector and a mean energy for $\\nu_{\\mu}$ of 9.6~GeV and for $\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$\nof 3.6~GeV. We compare the measured cross section and kinematic distributions\nto predictions from the GENIE and NuWro neutrino interaction event generators.\n", "  The hallmark of a 2 dimensional topologically ordered phase is the existence\nof deconfined `anyon' excitations that have exotic braiding and exchange\nstatistics, different from those of ordinary bosons or fermions. As opposed to\nconventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson phases, which are classified on the basis\nof the spontaneous breaking of an underlying symmetry, topologically ordered\nphases, such as those occurring in the fractional quantum Hall effect, are\nabsolutely stable, not requiring any such symmetry. Recently, though, it has\nbeen realized that symmetries, which may still be present in such systems, can\ngive rise to a host of new, distinct, many-body phases, all of which share the\nsame underlying topological order. A useful approach to classifying SETs is to\ndetermine all possible such symmetry actions on the anyons that are\nalgebraically consistent with the anyons' statistics. Remarkably, however,\nthere exist symmetry actions that, despite being algebraically consistent,\ncannot be realized in any physical system, and hence do not lead to valid 2d\nSETs. One class of such `anomalous' SETs, characterized by certain disallowed\nsymmetry fractionalization patters, finds a physical interpretation as an\nallowed surface state of certain 3d short-range entangled phases, but another,\ncharacterized by some seemingly valid but anomalous permutation actions of the\nsymmetry on the anyons, has so far eluded a physical interpretation. In this\nwork, we find a physical realization for these anomalously permuting SETs as\nsurface theories of certain 3d long-range entangled phases, completing our\nunderstanding of general anomalous SETs in 2 dimensions.\n", "  Strong coupling between the electronic states of monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDC) such as MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, or WSe$_2$, and a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) photonic cavity gives rise to several exotic effects. The\nDirac type Hamiltonian for a 2D gapped semiconductor with large spin-orbit\ncoupling facilitates pure Jaynes-Cummings type coupling in the presence of a\nsingle mode electric field. The presence of an additional circularly polarized\nbeam of light gives rise to valley and spin dependent cavity-QED properties.\nThe cavity causes the TMDC monolayer to act as an on-chip coherent light source\nand a spontaneous spin-oscillator. In addition, a TMDC monolayer in a cavity is\na sensitive magnetic field sensor for an in-plane magnetic field.\n", "  We consider the quantum information metric of a family of CFTs perturbed by\nan exactly marginal operator, which has the dual description of the Euclidean\nJanus geometries. We first clarify its two dimensional case dual to the three\ndimensional Janus geometry, which recently appeared in arXiv:1507.07555. We\ngeneralize this correspondence to higher dimensions and get a precise agreement\nbetween the both sides. We also show that the mixed-state information metric of\nthe same family of CFTs has a dual description in the Euclidean version of the\nJanus time-dependent black hole geometry.\n", "  We analyze the entanglement measure $C_4$ for mixed states in general and for\nthe transverse XY model. We come to the conclusion that it cannot serve alone\nfor guaranteeing an entanglement of $GHZ_4$-type. The genuine negativity\ncalculated in Ref.~\\cite{Hofmann14} isn't sufficient for that either and some\nadditional measure of entanglement must be considered. In particular we study\nthe transverse XY-model and find a non-zero $C_4$ measure which is of the same\norder of magnitude than the genuine negativity. Furthermore, we observe a\nfeature in the $C_4$ values that resembles a destructive interference with the\nunderlying concurrence.\n", "  The $(4+4)$-dimensional $\\kappa$-deformed quantum phase space as well as its\n$(10+10)$-dimensional covariant extension by the Lorentz sector can be\ndescribed as Heisenberg doubles: the $(10+10)$-dimensional quantum phase space\nis the double of $D=4$ $\\kappa$-deformed Poincar\\'e Hopf algebra $\\mathbb{H}$\nand the standard $(4+4)$-dimensional space is its subalgebra generated by\n$\\kappa$-Minkowski coordinates $\\hat{x}_\\mu$ and corresponding commuting\nmomenta $\\hat{p}_\\mu$. Every Heisenberg double appears as the total algebra of\na Hopf algebroid over a base algebra which is in our case the coordinate\nsector. We exhibit the details of this structure, namely the corresponding\nright bialgebroid and the antipode map. We rely on algebraic methods of\ncalculation in Majid-Ruegg bicrossproduct basis. The target map is derived from\na formula by J-H. Lu. The coproduct takes values in the bimodule tensor product\nover a base, what is expressed as the presence of coproduct gauge freedom.\n", "  We derive and study stochastic dissipative dynamics on coadjoint orbits by\nincorporating noise and dissipation into mechanical systems arising from the\ntheory of reduction by symmetry, including a semidirect-product extension.\nRandom attractors are found for this general class of systems when the Lie\nalgebra is semi- simple, provided the top Lyapunov exponent is positive. We\nstudy two canonical examples, the free rigid body and the heavy top, whose\nstochastic integrable reductions are found and numerical simulations of their\nrandom attractors are shown.\n", "  We report our recent effort for the extraction of resonance parameters\n(complex pole mass and residues etc.) associated with Lambda* and Sigma*\nhyperons. This was accomplished via a comprehensive partial-wave analysis of\nthe data for K^- p --> barK N, pi Sigma, pi Lambda, eta Lambda, K Xi reactions\nfrom the thresholds up to W=2.1 GeV within a dynamical coupled-channels\napproach. The results suggest a possible existence of new narrow J^P=3/2^+\n\\Lambda resonance with pole mass 1671^{+2}_{-8} -i(5^{+11}_{-2}) MeV, located\nclose to the eta Lambda threshold. This resonance is found to be responsible\nfor reproducing the data for K^-p --> eta Lambda differential cross sections\nnear the threshold, and thus the data seem favor its existence. The extracted\npoles for J^P=1/2^- Lambda resonances below the barK N threshold, including\nLambda(1405), are also presented.\n", "  We studied the nonequilibrium aging behavior of the Random Field Ising Model\nin three dimensions for various values of the disorder strength. This allowed\nus to investigate how the aging behavior changes across the\nferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition. We investigated a large system\nsize of $N=256^3$ spins and up to $10^8$ Monte Carlo sweeps. To reach these\nnecessary long simulation times we employed an implementation running on Intel\nXeon Phi coprocessors, reaching single spin flip times as short as 6 ps. We\nmeasured typical correlation functions in space and time to extract a growing\nlength scale and corresponding exponents.\n", "  In this work, we reported uniform layer-by-layer sublimation of black\nphosphorus under heating below 600 K. The uniformity and crystallinity of BP\nsamples after thermal thinning were confirmed by Raman spectra and 2D Raman\nimaging. A uniform and crystalline bilayer black phosphorus flake with an area\nof 180 um^2 was prepared with this method. No micron scale defects were\nobserved. The sublimation rate of BP was around 0.18 nm / min at 500 K and 1.5\nnm / min at 550 K. Both room and high temperature Raman peak intensity ratio\nSi/A2g vs. BP thickness relations were established for in-situ thickness\ndetermination. The sublimation thinning method was shown to be a controllable\nand scalable approach to prepare few-layer black phosphorus.\n", "  The electronic structure of Mn doped GaAs and GaN have been examined within a\nmultiband Hubbard model. By virtue of the positioning of the Mn d states, Mn\ndoped GaAs is found to belong to the p-d metal regime of the\nZaanen-Sawatzky-Allen phase diagram and its variants while Mn doping in GaN\nbelongs to the covalent insulator regime. Their location in the phase diagram\nalso determines how they would behave under quantum confinement which would\nincrease the charge transfer energy. The ferromagnetic stability of Mn doped\nGaAs, we find, increases with confinement therefore providing a route to higher\nferromagnetic transition temperatures.\n", "  We present a novel construction of the super-Pauli-Lubanski pseudo-vector for\n4D supersymmetry and show how it arises naturally from the spin-shell\nconstraints in the supertwistor formulation of superparticle dynamics. We\nillustrate this result in the context of a simple classical action for a\n\"superspinning particle\" of superspin 1/2. We then use an Sl(2;K)-spinor\nformalism for K=R,C,H to unify our 4D results with previous results for 3D and\n6D (super)Pauli-Lubanski tensors.\n", "  The so called \"hyperon puzzle\", i.e. the difficulty to reconcile the measured\nmasses of neutron stars (NSs) with the presence of hyperons in their interiors,\nis one of the hot topics in astrophysics which is stimulating copious\nexperimental and theoretical research in hypernuclear physics. After\nillustrating the origin of the hyperon puzzle, I discuss some of its possible\nsolutions, and particularly those related to the role of hyperonic two- and\nthree-body interactions on the equation of state of dense matter. Afterward, I\ndiscuss a possibility to circumvent the hyperon puzzle allowing for the\npresence of strangeness in NSs in the form of deconfined strange quark matter,\nand thus considering the so called quark stars, i.e. hybrid stars or strange\nstars. Finally I discuss the astrophysical consequences of the possible\nconversion process of an hadronic star to a quark star.\n", "  In this proceedings report, we discuss unique features of charmed, or in\ngeneral heavy, baryons with one heavy quark. A well and long-term known\nphenomena, the distinction of the two modes of the rho and lambda type of a\nthree-quark system is revisited. The difference of these modes may be tested in\nthe production and decay reactions of the baryons which may be tested in the\nfuture experiments at J-PARC.\n", "  We report achieving enhanced nuclear magnetization in a magnetic resonance\nforce microscope experiment at 0.6 tesla and 4.2 kelvin using the dynamic\nnuclear polarization (DNP) effect. In our experiments a microwire coplanar\nwaveguide delivered radiowaves to excite nuclear spins and microwaves to excite\nelectron spins in a 250 nm thick nitroxide-doped polystyrene sample. Both\nelectron and proton spin resonance were observed as a change in the mechanical\nresonance frequency of a nearby cantilever having a micron-scale nickel tip.\nNMR signal, not observable from Curie-law magnetization at 0.6 tesla, became\nobservable when microwave irradiation was applied to saturate the electron\nspins. The resulting NMR signal's size, buildup time, dependence on microwave\npower, and dependence on irradiation frequency was consistent with a transfer\nof magnetization from electron spins to nuclear spins. Due to the presence of\nan inhomogenous magnetic field introduced by the cantilever's magnetic tip, the\nelectron spins in the sample were saturated in a microwave-resonant slice 10's\nof nm thick. The spatial distribution of the nuclear polarization enhancement\nfactor $\\epsilon$ was mapped by varying the frequency of the applied\nradiowaves. The observed enhancement factor was zero for spins in the center of\nthe resonant slice, was $\\epsilon = +10$ to $+20$ for spins proximal to the\nmagnet, and was $\\epsilon = -10$ to $-20$ for spins distal to the magnet. We\nshow that this bipolar nuclear magnetization profile is consistent with\ncross-effect DNP in a $\\sim \\! 10^{5} \\: \\mathrm{T} \\: \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\nmagnetic field gradient. Potential challenges associated with generating and\nusing DNP-enhanced nuclear magnetization in a nanometer-resolution magnetic\nresonance imaging experiment are elucidated and discussed.\n", "  By representing a quantum state and its evolution with the majorana stars on\nthe Bloch sphere, the Majorana representation (MR) provide us an intuitive way\nto study a physical system with SU(2) symmetry. In this work, based on coherent\nstates, we propose a method to establish generalization of MR for a general\nsymmetry. By choosing a generalized coherent state as a reference state, we\ngive a more general MR for both finite and infinite systems and the\ncorresponding star equations are given. Using this method, we study the\nsqueezed vacuum states for three different symmetries, Heisenberg-Weyl, SU(2)\nand SU(1,1), and express the effect of squeezing parameter on the distribution\nof stars. Furthermore, we also study the dynamical evolution of stars for an\ninitial coherent state driven by a nonlinear Hamiltonian, and find that at a\nspecial time point, the stars are distributed on two orthogonal large circles.\n", "  A direct photon-phonon parametric effect of the quadratic coupling on the\nmean-field dynamics of an optomechanical resonator in the large-scale-movement\nregime is found and investigated. Under a weak pumping power, the mechanical\nresonator damps to steady state with a nonlinear static response sensitively\nmodified by the quadratic coupling. When the driving powerincreases beyond the\nstatic energy balance, the steady states lose their stabilities via Hopf\nbifurcations and the resonator produces stable self-sustained\noscillation(limit-circle behavior) of discrete energies with step-like\namplitudes due to the parametric effect of the quadratic coupling, which can be\nunderstood roughly by the power balance between gain and loss on the resonator.\nA further increase of the pumping power can induce chaotic dynamic of the\nresonator via a typical routine of period-doubling bifurcation but which can be\nstabilized by the parametric effect through an inversion bifurcation process\nback to limit-circle states. The bifurcation-to-inverse-bifurcation transitions\nare numerically verified by the maximal Lyapunov exponents of the dynamics and\nwhich indicate an efficient way to suppress the chaotic behavior of the\noptomechanical resonator by the quadratic coupling. Furthermore, the parametric\neffect of the quadratic coupling on the dynamic transitions of an\noptomechanical resonator can be conveniently detected or traced by the output\npower spectrum of the cavity field.\n", "  The X(3872) radiative decay is discussed by employing a two-meson\nmultichannel model with the charmonium components, which explains many of the\nother observed features of X(3872). We have found that the ratio of the\nbranching fractions of the X(3872) radiative decays, $R_\\gamma\n=\\text{Br}(X(3872)\\rightarrow\\psi(2S)\\gamma)$ / Br$(X(3872)\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\gamma)$, is 1.1 $\\sim$ 3.4 if one assumes that the decay occurs only\nfrom the charmonium components. The invariant mass spectra of\n$cc^{bar}$($2P$)$\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\gamma$ and $cc^{bar}$($2P$)$\\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S) \\gamma$ are also investigated. It is found that an enhancement appears\nat around $E\\sim 3960$ MeV in the $\\psi(2S) \\gamma$ spectrum but not in the\n$J/\\psi\\gamma$ spectrum. This corresponds to the missing $cc^{bar}$($2P$) pole\nwhich was predicted by the quark models but has not been observed due to the\ncoupling to the $DD^{bar}$ states. We argue that the fluctuation seen in the\nexperimental $\\psi(2S) \\gamma$ spectrum reported by LHCb may correspond to this\n$cc^{bar}$($2P$) pole.\n", "  Motivated by physical constructions of homological knot invariants, we study\ntheir analogs for closed 3-manifolds. We show that fivebrane compactifications\nprovide a universal description of various old and new homological invariants\nof 3-manifolds. In terms of 3d/3d correspondence, such invariants are given by\nthe Q-cohomology of the Hilbert space of partially topologically twisted 3d N=2\ntheory T[M_3] on a Riemann surface with defects. We demonstrate this by\nconcrete and explicit calculations in the case of monopole/Heegaard Floer\nhomology and a 3-manifold analog of Khovanov-Rozansky link homology. The latter\ngives a categorification of Chern-Simons partition function. Some of the new\nkey elements include the explicit form of the S-transform and a novel\nconnection between categorification and a previously mysterious role of Eichler\nintegrals in Chern-Simons theory.\n", "  In the context of chaotic dynamical systems with exponential divergence of\nnearby trajectories in phase space, hyperchaos is defined as a state where\nthere is divergence or stretching in at least two directions during the\nevolution of the system. Hence the detection and characterization of a\nhyperchaotic attractor is usually done using the spectrum of Lyapunov Exponents\n(LEs) that measure this rate of divergence along each direction. Though\nhyperchaos arise in different dynamical situations and find several practical\napplications, a proper understanding of the geometric structure of a\nhyperchaotic attractor still remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we\npresent strong numerical evidence to suggest that the geometric structure of a\nhyperchaotic attractor can be characterized using a multifractal spectrum with\ntwo superimposed components. In other words, apart from developing an extra\npositive LE, there is also a structural change as a chaotic attractor makes a\ntransition to the hyperchaotic phase and the attractor changes from a simple\nmultifractal to a dual multifractal, equivalent to two inter-mingled\nmultifractals. We argue that a cross-over behavior in the scaling region for\ncomputing the correlation dimension is a manifestation of such a structure. In\norder to support this claim, we present an illustrative example of a\nsynthetically generated set of points in the unit interval (a Cantor set with a\nvariable iteration scheme) displaying dual multifractal spectrum. Our results\nare also used to develop a general scheme to generate both hyperchaotic as well\nas high dimensional chaotic attractors by coupling two low dimensional chaotic\nattractors and tuning a time scale parameter.\n", "  Momentum anisotropy present during the hydrodynamic evolution of Quark-Gluon\nPlasma (QGP) in RHIC may lead to chromo-Weibel instability and turbulent\nchromo-fields.The dynamics of the quark and gluon momentum distributions in\nthis case is governed by an effective diffusive Vlasov equation (linearized).\nThe solution of this linearized transport equation for the modified momentum\ndistribution functions lead to the mathematical form of non-equilibrium\nmomentum distribution functions of quarks/antiquarks and gluons. The\nmodification to these distributions encode the physics of turbulent color\nfields and momentum anisotropy. In the present manuscript, we employ these\ndistribution functions to to estimate thermal dilepton production rate in the\nQGP medium. The production rate is seen to have appreciable sensitivity to the\nstrength of the anisotropy.\n", "  Mechanical systems of Cosserat--Zhilin are introduced as the main object of\nNewtonian (non--relativistic) mechanics on the base of new notions of vector\ncalculus - sliders and screw measures (bi-measures). The differential equations\nof motion are derived for different types of Cosserat--Zhilin systems in the\ncase where Stocks theorem is applicable. The paper defines multiplicative\ngroups which represent the measure of stress as a (well-defined) linear\nisotropic map of {strain} tensor or tensor of {strain velocities} for classical\nand polar continua in 2- and 3-dimensional cases.\n", "  Graph labelling is one of the noticed contexts in combinatorics and graph\ntheory. Graceful labelling for a graph $G$ with $e$ edges, is to label the\nvertices of $G$ with $0, 1, \\cdots, e$ such that, if we specify to each edge\nthe difference value between its two ends, then any of $1, 2, \\cdots, e$\nappears exactly once as an edge label. For a given graph, there is still few\nefficient classical algorithms that determines either it is graceful or not,\neven for trees - as a well-known class of graphs. In this paper, we introduce\nan adiabatic quantum algorithm, which for a graceful graph $G$ finds a graceful\nlabelling. Also, this algorithm can determine if $G$ is not graceful. Numerical\nsimulations of the algorithm reveal that its time complexity has a polynomial\nbehaviour with the problem size up to the range of 15 qubits.\n", "  In the present work, we estimate the decays of the $X(5568)$ and $X(5616)$ in\na $B \\bar{K}$ and a $B^\\ast \\bar{K}$ $S$-wave hadronic molecule scenarios,\nrespectively, which may corresponding to the structure observed by D0\nCollaboration. Our estimation indicates both $B\\bar{K}$ and $B^\\ast \\bar{K}$\nhadronic molecule decay widths could explain the experimental data in a proper\nmodel parameter range.\n", "  The production of strangeness on the nucleon and hyperon and hypernuclear\nproduction in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies and in antiproton\nannihilation on nuclei is discussed. The reaction process is described by\ntransport theory with focus on $S=-2$ channels and a comparison of different\nmodel interactions. The interactions of hyperons in nuclear matter is\ninvestigated in a novel SU(3) approach. An outlook to the $S=-3$ sector and\n$\\Omega^-$ physics is given.\n", "  Within the context of Newton's theory of gravitation, restricted to\npoint-like test particles and central bodies, stable circular orbits in\nordinary space are related to stable circular paths on a massless, unmovable,\nundeformable vortex-like surface, under the action of a tidal gravitational\nfield along the symmetry axis. An interpretation is made in the light of a\nholographic principle, in the sense that motions in ordinary space are\nconnected with motions on a selected surface and vice versa. Then ordinary\nspace is conceived as a 3-hypersurface bounding a $n$-hypervolume where\ngravitation takes origin, within a $n$-hyperspace. The extension of the\nholographic principle to extra dimensions implies the existence of a minimum\ndistance where test particles may still be considered as distinct from the\ncentral body. Below that threshold, it is inferred test particles lose theirs\nindividuality and \"glue\" to the central body via unification of the four known\ninteractions and, in addition, (i) particles can no longer be conceived as\npoint-like but e.g., strings or membranes, and (ii) quantum effects are\ndominant and matter turns back to a pre-big bang state. A more detailed\nformulation including noncircular motions within the context of general\nrelativity, together with further knowledge on neutron stars, quark stars and\nblack holes, would provide further insight on the formulation of quantum\ngravity.\n", "  Using a laser polarization gradient, we realize 3D Sisyphus cooling of\n$^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions confined in and near the Lamb-Dicke regime in a linear Paul\ntrap. The cooling rate and final mean motional energy of a single ion are\ncharacterized as a function of laser intensity and compared to semiclassical\nand quantum simulations. Sisyphus cooling is also applied to a linear string of\nfour ions to obtain a mean energy of 1-3 quanta for all vibrational modes, an\napproximately order-of-magnitude reduction below Doppler cooled energies. This\nis used to enable subsequent, efficient sideband laser cooling.\n", "  We present the E-field Parallel Imaging Calibration (EPICal) algorithm, which\naddresses the need for a fast calibration method for direct imaging radio\nastronomy correlators. Direct imaging involves a spatial fast Fourier transform\nof antenna signals, alleviating an $\\mathcal{O}(N_{\\mathrm{ant}}^2)$\ncomputational bottleneck typical in radio correlators, and yielding a more\ngentle $\\mathcal{O}(N_g \\log_2 N_g)$ scaling, where $N_{\\mathrm{ant}}$ is the\nnumber of antennas in the array and $N_g$ is the number of grid points in the\nimaging analysis. This can save orders of magnitude in computation cost for\nnext generation arrays consisting of hundreds or thousands of antennas.\nHowever, because antenna signals are mixed in the imaging correlator without\ncreating visibilities, gain correction must be applied prior to imaging, rather\nthan on visibilities post-correlation. We develop the EPICal algorithm to form\ngain solutions quickly and without ever forming visibilities. This method\nscales as the number of antennas, and produces results comparable to those from\nvisibilities. We use simulations to demonstrate the EPICal technique and study\nthe noise properties of our gain solutions, showing they are similar to\nvisibility based solutions in realistic situations. By applying EPICal to two\nseconds of Long Wavelength Array data we achieve a 65% dynamic range\nimprovement compared to uncalibrated images, showing this algorithm is a\npromising solution for next generation instruments.\n", "  The electronic state and transport properties of hot dense iron are of the\nutmost importance to geophysics. Combining the density functional and dynamical\nmean field theories we study the impact of electron correlations on electrical\nand thermal resistivity of hexagonal close-packed $\\epsilon$-Fe at Earth's core\nconditions. $\\epsilon$-Fe is found to behave as a nearly perfect Fermi liquid.\nThe quadratic dependence of the scattering rate in Fermi liquids leads to a\nmodification of the Wiedemann-Franz law with suppression of the thermal\nconductivity as compared to the electrical one. This significantly increases\nthe electron-electron thermal resistivity which is found to be of comparable\nmagnitude to the electron-phonon one. The implications of this effect on the\ndynamics of Earth's core is discussed.\n", "  We demonstrate a simple and robust geometry for optical trapping in vacuum of\na single nanoparticle based on a parabolic mirror and the optical gradient\nforce, and we demonstrate rapid parametric feedback cooling of all three\nmotional degrees of freedom from room temperature to a few mK. A single laser\nat 1550nm, and a single photodiode, are used for trapping, position detection,\nand cooling for all three dimensions. Particles with diameters from 26nm to\n160nm are trapped without feedback to 10$^{-5}$mbar and with feedback engaged\nthe pressure is reduced to 10$^{-6}$mbar. Modifications to the harmonic motion\nin the presence of noise and feedback are studied, and an experimental\nmechanical quality factor $>4\\times 10^7$ is estimated.\n", "  We consider Fock representations of the $Q$-deformed commutation relations\n$$\\partial_s\\partial^\\dag_t=Q(s,t)\\partial_t^\\dag\\partial_s+\\delta(s,t), \\quad\ns,t\\in T.$$ Here\n  $T:=\\mathbb R^d$ (or more generally $T$ is a locally compact Polish space),\nthe function $Q:T^2\\to \\mathbb C$ satisfies $|Q(s,t)|\\le1$ and\n$Q(s,t)=\\overline{Q(t,s)}$, and\n$$\\int_{T^2}h(s)g(t)\\delta(s,t)\\,\\sigma(ds)\\sigma(dt):=\\int_T\nh(t)g(t)\\,\\sigma(dt),$$\n  $\\sigma$ being a fixed reference measure on $T$. In the case where\n$|Q(s,t)|\\equiv 1$, the $Q$-deformed commutation relations describe a\ngeneralized statistics studied by Liguori and Mintchev (1995). These\ngeneralized statistics contain anyon statistics as a special case (with\n$T=\\mathbb R^2$ and a special choice of the function $Q$). The related\n$Q$-deformed Fock space $\\mathcal F(\\mathcal H)$ over $\\mathcal\nH:=L^2(T\\to\\mathbb C,\\sigma)$ is constructed. An explicit form of the\northogonal projection of $\\mathcal H^{\\otimes n}$ onto the $n$-particle space\n$\\mathcal F_n(\\mathcal H)$ is derived. A scalar product in $\\mathcal\nF_n(\\mathcal H)$ is given by an operator $\\mathcal P_n\\ge0$ in $\\mathcal\nH^{\\otimes n}$ which is strictly positive on $\\mathcal F_n(\\mathcal H)$. We\nrealize the smeared operators $\\partial_t^\\dag$ and $\\partial_t$ as creation\nand annihilation operators in $\\mathcal F(\\mathcal H)$, respectively.\nAdditional $Q$-commutation relations are obtained between the creation\noperators and between the annihilation operators. They are of the form\n$\\partial^\\dag_s\\partial^\\dag_t=Q(t,s)\\partial^\\dag_t\\partial^\\dag_s$,\n$\\partial_s\\partial_t=Q(t,s)\\partial_t\\partial_s$, valid for those $s,t\\in T$\nfor which $|Q(s,t)|=1$.\n", "  We show that calculation of a final fermion polarization (for a pure initial\nstate) is equivalent to the problem of looking for complete polarization axis\nof bispinor. This gives the method for calculation of polarization applicable\nboth for final and intermediate state fermions. We suggest to use fermion\npropagator (bare or dressed) in form of spectral representation, which gives\nthe orthogonal off-shell energy projectors. This representation leads to\ncovariant separation of particle and antiparticle contributions and gives a\nnatural definition for polarization of intermediate state fermion. The most\nevident application is related with consistent description of $t$-quark\npolarization.\n", "  In this paper I compare the Abraham and the Minkowski forms for the momentum\npertaining to an electromagnetic wave inside a dielectric or a magnetic\nmaterial. The discussion is based on a careful treatment of the surface charges\nand currents and of the forces acting on them. While in the dielectric case the\nAbraham momentum is certainly more appealing from the physical point of view,\nfor a magnetic material it suggests an interpretation in terms of magnetic\ncharges and re- lated magnetic currents. The Minkowski momentum for magnetic\nnon conducting materials, on the contrary, has a natural interpretation in\nterms of an amperian model, in which the dynamics is determined by the Lorentz\nforce acting on bulk and surface electric currents.\n", "  Recent topics on mesons in nuclei are discussed by especially emphasizing the\nrole of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear medium. The\nspontaneously broken chiral symmetry in vacuum is considered to be incompletely\nrestored in finite nuclear density systems with moderate reduction of the\nmagnitude of the quark condensate. On the partial restoration of chiral\nsymmetry, the wave function renormalization is important to be taken into\naccount for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We also discuss the possible change of\nthe meson properties in the nuclear medium and meson-nucleus systems for the\n$\\bar K$, $\\eta$, $K^{+}$ and $\\eta^{\\prime}$ mesons.\n", "  First principles density functional theory based calculations have been\ncarried out to predict the effects of Mn replacement by Fe and Cr on electronic\nas well as magnetic properties of Pt$_{2}$MnGa as well as Ni$_{2}$MnGa. All the\nmaterials studied here are predicted to have conventional Heusler alloy\nstructure in their ground state and they are found to be electronically stable\non the basis of their respective formation energy. The replacement of Mn by Fe\nleads to a ferromagnetic ground state whereas in case of Mn replacement by Cr\nan {\\it intra-sublattice} anti-ferromagnetic configuration has been observed to\nhave lower energy. We study the magnetic exchange interaction between the atoms\nfor the materials with ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic configurations to\nshow the effects of Fe and Cr substitution at Mn site on the magnetic\ninteractions of these systems. Detailed analysis of electronic structure in\nterms of density of states has been carried out to study the effect of\nsubstitution.\n", "  In the context of modified $f(R)$ gravity theory, we study time-dependent\nwormhole spacetimes in the radiation background. In this framework, we attempt\nto generalize the thermodynamic properties of time-dependent wormholes in\n$f(R)$ gravity. Finally, at event horizon, the rate of change of total entropy\nhas been discussed.\n", "  The influence of periodic edge vacancies and antidot arrays on the\nthermoelectric properties of zigzag graphene nanoribbons is investigated. Using\nthe Green's function method, the tight-binding approximation for the electron\nHamiltonian and the 4th nearest neighbor approximation for the phonon dynamical\nmatrix, we calculate the Seebeck coefficient and the thermoelectric figure of\nmerit. It is found that, at a certain periodic arrangement of vacancies on both\nedges of zigzag nanoribbon, a finite band gap opens and almost twofold\ndegenerate energy levels appear. As a result, a marked increase in the Seebeck\ncoefficient takes place. It is shown that an additional enhancement of the\nthermoelectric figure of merit can be achieved by a combination of periodic\nedge defects with an antidot array.\n", "  We investigate the QCD topological susceptibility $\\chi_t$ by using the\nnonlocal chiral quark model (NL$\\chi$QM). This model is based on the liquid\ninstanton QCD-vacuum configuration in which $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ flavor symmetry is\nexplicitly broken by the current quark mass $(m_{u,d},m_s)\\approx(5,135)$ MeV.\nTo compute $\\chi_t$, the local topological charge density operator $Q_t(x)$ is\nderived from the effective partition function of NL$\\chi$QM. We take into\naccount the contributions from the leading-order (LO) ones\n$\\sim\\mathcal{O}(N_c)$ in the $1/N_c$ expansion. We also verify that the\nanalytical expression of $\\chi_t$ in NL$\\chi$QM satisfy the Witten-Veneziano\n(WV) and the Leutwyler-Smilga (LS) formulae. Once the average instanton size\nand inter-instanton distance are fixed with $\\bar{\\rho}=1/3$ fm and $\\bar{R}=1$\nfm, respectively, all the associated model parameters are all determined\nself-consistently within the model, including the $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ weak decay\nconstants. We obtain the results such as $F_{\\eta}=96.77$ MeV and\n$F_{\\eta'}=102.53$ MeV for instance. Numerically we observe that\n$\\chi_{t}=(165.57\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^4$ in our full calculation. This value is\ncomparable with its empirical one $\\chi_t=(175\\pm5\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^4$. We also\nfind that our $\\chi^\\mathrm{WV}_t=\\chi^\\mathrm{QL}_t=(194.30,\\mathrm{MeV})^4$\nin the quenched limit and $\\chi^\\mathrm{LS}_t=(162.54\\,\\mathrm{MeV})^4$ in the\nchiral limit. Consequently, we conclude that $\\chi_{t}<\\chi^\\mathrm{QL}_t$. Our\nresult also implies that the $(10\\sim20)\\,\\%$ decrease with the dynamical quark\ncontributions.\n", "  The variability of Indo-Pacific SST on seasonal to multidecadal timescales is\ninvestigated using a recently introduced technique called nonlinear Laplacian\nspectral analysis (NLSA). Through this technique, drawbacks associated with ad\nhoc pre-filtering of the input data are avoided, enabling recovery of\nlow-frequency and intermittent modes not previously accessible via classical\napproaches. Here, a multiscale hierarchy of spatiotemporal modes is identified\nfor Indo-Pacific SST in millennial control runs of CCSM4 and CM3 and in HadISST\ndata. On interannual timescales, a mode with spatiotemporal patterns\ncorresponding to the fundamental component of ENSO emerges, along with\nENSO-modulated annual modes consistent with combination mode theory. The ENSO\ncombination modes also feature prominent activity in the Indian Ocean,\nexplaining significant fraction of the SST variance in regions associated with\nthe Indian Ocean dipole. A pattern resembling the tropospheric biennial\noscillation emerges in addition to ENSO and the associated combination modes.\nOn multidecadal timescales, the dominant NLSA mode in the model data is\npredominantly active in the western tropical Pacific. The interdecadal Pacific\noscillation also emerges as a distinct NLSA mode, though with smaller explained\nvariance than the western Pacific multidecadal mode. Analogous modes on\ninterannual and decadal timescales are also identified in HadISST data for the\nindustrial era, as well as in model data of comparable timespan, though decadal\nmodes are either absent or of degraded quality in these datasets.\n", "  Here we show that the distribution of internal gravity waves energy over a\npatch of seabed corrugations strongly depends on the \"distance\" of the patch to\nadjacent seafloor features. Specifically, we consider the energy distribution\nover a patch of seabed ripples neighbored to i. another patch of ripples, and\nii. a vertical wall. Seabed undulations with dominant wavenumber twice as large\nas overpassing internal waves reflect back part of the energy of the internal\nwaves (Bragg reflection), let the rest of the energy to transmit or to be\ntransferred to higher and lower modes. In the presence of a neighboring\ntopography on the downstream side, the transmitted energy from the patch may\nreflect back, e.g. partially if the downstream topography is another set of\nseabed ripples, or fully if it is a vertical wall. The reflected wave from\ndownstream topography is again reflected back by the patch of ripples through\nthe same mechanism. This consecutive reflection goes on indefinitely leading to\na complex interaction pattern including constructive and destructive\ninterference of multiply reflected waves as well as an interplay between higher\nmodes internal waves resonated over the topography. We show here that when\nsteady state is reached both the qualitative and quantitative behavior of\nenergy distribution over the patch is a strong function of the \"distance\"\nbetween the patch and the downstream topography. As a result, for instance, the\nlocal energy density in the water column can become an order of magnitude\nlarger in certain areas merely based on where the downstream topography is.\nThis may result in the formation of steep waves in specific areas of the ocean,\nleading to breaking and enhanced mixing. At a right distance, the wall or the\nsecond patch may also result in a complete disappearance of the trace of the\nseabed undulations on the upstream and the downstream wave field.\n", "  Environment-induced decoherence has long been recognised as being of crucial\nimportance in the study of chaos in quantum systems. In particular, the exact\nform and strength of the system-environment interaction play a major role in\nthe quantum-to-classical transition of chaotic systems. In this work we focus\non the effect of varying monitoring strategies, i.e. for a given decoherence\nmodel and a fixed environmental coupling, there is still freedom on how to\nmonitor a quantum system. We show here that there is a region between the deep\nquantum regime and the classical limit where the choice of the monitoring\nparameter allows one to control the complex behaviour of the system, leading to\neither the emergence or suppression of chaos. Our work shows that this is a\nresult from the interplay between quantum interference effects induced by the\nnonlinear dynamics and the effectiveness of the decoherence for different\nmeasurement schemes.\n", "  The impact of ion pressure dynamics on E x B mean flows is investigated.\nUsing a simplified, two-dimensional, drift ordered fluid model in the\nthin-layer approximation, three stresses in addition to the Reynolds stress are\nshown to modify the E x B mean flow. These additional terms in the stress\ntensor all require ion pressure fluctuations. Quasi-linear analysis show that\nthese additional stresses are as important as the Reynolds stress, and hence\nmust be taken into account in analysis of transport barriers in which sheared E\nx B mean flows are key ingredients.\n", "  This paper describes an adaptive preconditioner for numerical continuation of\nincompressible Navier--Stokes flows. The preconditioner maps the identity (no\npreconditioner) to the Stokes preconditioner (preconditioning by Laplacian)\nthrough a continuous parameter and is built on a first order Euler\ntime-discretization scheme. The preconditioner is tested onto two fluid\nconfigurations: three-dimensional doubly diffusive convection and a reduced\nmodel of shear flows. In the former case, Stokes preconditioning works but a\nmixed preconditioner is preferred. In the latter case, the system of equation\nis split and solved simultaneously using two different preconditioners, one of\nwhich is parameter dependent. Due to the nature of these applications, this\npreconditioner is expected to help a wide range of studies.\n", "  All-electrical and programmable manipulations of ferromagnetic bits are\nhighly pursued for the aim of high integration and low energy consumption in\nmodern information technology. Methods based on the spin-orbit torque switching\nin heavy metal/ferromagnet structures have been proposed with magnetic field,\nand recently are heading toward deterministic switching without external\nmagnetic field. Here we demonstrate that an in-plane effective magnetic field\ncan be induced by an electric field without breaking the symmetry of the\nstructure of the thin film, and realize the deterministic magnetization\nswitching in a hybrid ferromagnetic/ferroelectric structure with Pt/Co/Ni/Co/Pt\nlayers on PMN-PT substrate. The effective magnetic field can be reversed by\nchanging the direction of the applied electric field on the PMN-PT substrate,\nwhich fully replaces the controllability function of the external magnetic\nfield. The electric field is found to generate an additional spin-orbit torque\non the CoNiCo magnets, which is confirmed by macrospin calculations.\n", "  Advent of nematic liquid crystals flows have attracted renewed attention in\nview of microfluidic transport phenomena. Among various transport processes,\nelectroosmosis stands as one of the efficient flow actuation method through\nnarrow confinement. In the present study, we explore the electrically actuated\nflow of a nematic fluid with ionic inclusions taking into account the\ninfluences from surface induced elastic and electrical double layer phenomena.\nInfluence of surface effects on the flow characteristics is known to get\naugmented in micro-confined environment and must be properly addressed. Towards\nthis, we devise the coupled flow governing equations from fundamental free\nenergy analysis considering the contributions from first and second-order\nelastic, dielectric, flexoelectric, ionic and entropic energies. We have\nfurther considered weak anchoring surface conditions with second order\nelasticity which helps us to more accurately capture the director deformations\nalong the boundaries. The present study focuses on the influence of surface\ncharge and elasticity effects in the resulting linear electroosmosis through a\nslit-type microchannel whose surface are considered to be chemically treated in\norder to display a homeotropic-type weak anchoring state. An optical periodic\nstripe configuration of the nematic director has been observed especially for\nhigher electric fields wherein the Ericksen number for the dynamic study is\nrestricted to the order of unity.\n", "  We extend to the Toda lattice hierarchy the approach of [3, 4] to computation\nof logarithmic derivatives of tau-functions in terms of the so-called matrix\nresolvents of the corresponding differ- ence Lax operator. As a particular\napplication we obtain explicit generating series for connected GUE correlators.\nOn this basis an efficient recursive procedure for computing the correlators in\nfull genera is developed.\n", "  We describe an efficient algorithm to compute a large number of baryon-baryon\ninteractions from $NN$ to $\\Xi\\Xi$ by means of HAL QCD method, which lays the\ngroundwork for the nearly physical point lattice QCD calculation with volume\n$(96a)^4\\approx$($8.2$fm)$^4$. Preliminary results of $\\Lambda N$ potential\ncalculated with quark masses corresponding to\n($m_{\\pi}$,$m_{K}$)$\\approx$(146,525)MeV are presented.\n", "  We show that the emerging field of discrete differential geometry can be\nusefully brought to bear on crystallization problems. In particular, we give a\nsimplified proof of the Heitmann-Radin crystallization theorem (R. C. Heitmann,\nC. Radin, J. Stat. Phys. 22, 281-287, 1980), which concerns a system of $N$\nidentical atoms in two dimensions interacting via the idealized pair potential\n$V(r)=+\\infty$ if $r<1$, $-1$ if $r=1$, $0$ if $r>1$. This is done by endowing\nthe bond graph of a general particle configuration with a suitable notion of\n{\\it discrete curvature}, and appealing to a {\\it discrete Gauss-Bonnet\ntheorem} (O. Knill, Elem. Math. 67, 1-17, 2012) which, as its continuous\ncousins, relates the sum/integral of the curvature to topological invariants.\nThis leads to an exact geometric decomposition of the Heitmann-Radin energy\ninto (i) a combinatorial bulk term, (ii) a combinatorial perimeter, (iii) a\nmultiple of the Euler characteristic, and (iv) a natural topological energy\ncontribution due to defects. An analogous exact geometric decomposition is also\nestablished for soft potentials such as the Lennard-Jones potential\n$V(r)=r^{-6}-2r^{-12}$, where two additional contributions arise, (v) elastic\nenergy and (vi) energy due to non-bonded interactions.\n", "  The decoherence of a test particle interacting with an ideal gas is studied\nby the help of the effective Lagrangian, derived in the leading order of the\nperturbation expansion and in order $\\ord{\\partial^2_t}$. The stationary\ndecoherence time is found to be comparable to or longer than the diffusion\ntime. The decoherence time reaches its minimal value for classical, completely\ndecohered environment, suggesting that physical decoherence is slowed down as\ncompared with diffusion by the quantum coherence of the environment.\n", "  We interpret Janus as an interface in a conformal field theory and study its\nproperties. The Janus is created by an exactly marginal operator and we study\nits effect on the interface conformal field theory on the Janus. We do this by\nutilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence. We compute the interface free energy both\nfrom leading correction to the Euclidean action in the dual gravity description\nand from conformal perturbation theory in the conformal field theory. We find\nthat the two results agree each other and that the interface free energy scales\nprecisely as expected from the conformal invariance of the Janus interface.\n", "  Unique superconductivity at surfaces/interfaces, as exemplified by\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces, and the high transition temperature in ultrathin FeSe\nfilms, have triggered intense debates on how superconductivity is affected in\natomic and electronic reconstructions. The surface of superconducting cubic\nspinel oxide LiTi2O4 is another interesting system because its inherent surface\nelectronic and atomic reconstructions add complexity to superconducting\nproperties. Investigations of such surfaces are hampered by the lack of single\ncrystals or high-quality thin films. Here, using low-temperature scanning\ntunneling microscopy, we report an unexpected small superconducting energy gap\nand a long coherence length on the surface of LiTi2O4 (111) epitaxial thin\nfilms. Furthermore, we find that a pseudogap opening at the Fermi energy\nmodifies the surface superconductivity. Our results open an avenue, exploring\nanomalous superconductivity on the surface of cubic transition-metal oxides\nwhere the electronic states are spontaneously modulated with involving rich\nmany-body interactions.\n", "  Motivated by the recent breakthrough of the detection of Gravitational Waves\n(GW) from coalescent black holes by the aLIGO interferometers, we study the\npropagation of GW in the {\\sl D-material universe}, which we have recently\nshown to be compatible with large-scale structure and inflationary\nphenomenology. The medium of D-particles induces an effective mass for the\ngraviton, as a consequence of the formation of recoil-velocity field\ncondensates due to the underlying Born-Infeld dynamics. There is a competing\neffect, due to a super-luminal refractive index, as a result of the\ngravitational energy of D-particles acting as a dark matter component, with\nwhich propagating gravitons interact. We examine conditions for the condensate\nunder which the latter effect is sub-leading. We argue that if quantum\nfluctuations of the recoil velocity are relatively strong, which can happen in\nthe current era of the universe, then the condensate, and hence the induced\nmass of the graviton, can be several orders of magnitude larger than the\nmagnitude of the cosmological constant today. Hence, we constrain the graviton\nmass using aLIGO and pulsar timing observations (which give the most stringent\nbounds at present). In such a sub-luminal graviton case, there is also a\ngravitational Cherenkov effect for ordinary high energy cosmic matter, which is\nfurther constrained by means of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray observations.\nAssuming cosmic rays of extragalactic origin, the bounds on the quantum\ncondensate strength, based on the gravitational Cherenkov effect, are of the\nsame order as those from aLIGO measurements, in contrast to the case where a\ngalactic origin of the cosmic rays is assumed, in which case the corresponding\nbounds are much weaker.\n", "  We show that the equivalent linearization technique, when used properly,\nenables us to calculate frequency corrections of weakly nonlinear oscillators\nbeyond the first order in nonlinearity. We illustrate the method by applying it\nto the conservative anharmonic oscillators and the nonconservative van der Pol\noscillator that are respectively paradigmatic systems for modeling center-type\noscillatory states and limit cycle type oscillatory states. The choice of these\nsystems is also prompted by the fact that first order frequency corrections may\nvanish for both these types of oscillators, thereby rendering the calculation\nof the higher order corrections rather important. The method presented herein\nis very general in nature and, hence, in principle applicable to any arbitrary\nperiodic oscillator.\n", "  Given a random walk a method is presented to produce a matrix of transition\nprobabilities that is consistent with that random walk. The method is a kind of\nreverse application of the usual ergodicity and is tested by using a transition\nmatrix to produce a path and then using that path to create the estimate. The\ntwo matrices and their predictions are then compared. A variety of situations\ntest the method, random matrices, metastable configurations (for which\nergodicity often does not apply) and explicit violation of detailed balance.\n", "  We report the discovery of the exoplanet K2-110 b (previously EPIC212521166b)\nfrom K2 photometry orbiting in a 13.8637d period around an old, metal-poor K3\ndwarf star. With a V-band magnitude of 11.9, K2-110 is particularly amenable to\nRV follow-up. A joint analysis of K2 photometry and high-precision RVs from 28\nHARPS and HARPS-N spectra reveal it to have a radius of 2.6$\\pm 0.1 R_{\\oplus}$\nand a mass of 16.7$\\pm 3.2$~M$_{\\oplus}$, hence a density of $5.2\\pm1.2$\ng.cm$^{-3}$, making it one of the most massive planets yet to be found with a\nsub-Neptune radius. When accounting for compression, the resulting Earth-like\ndensity is best fitted by a 0.2 M$_{\\oplus}$ hydrogen atmosphere over an 16.5\nM$_{\\oplus}$ Earth-like interior, although the planet could also have\nsignificant water content. At 0.1~AU, even taking into account the old stellar\nage of $8 \\pm 3$ Gyr, the planet is unlikely to have been significantly\naffected by EUV evaporation. However the planet likely disc-migrated to its\ncurrent position making the lack of a thick H$_2$ atmosphere puzzling. This\nanalysis has made K2-110 b one of the best-characterised mini-Neptunes with\ndensity constrained to less than 30%.\n", "  We investigate the utility of the convex hull of many Lagrangian tracers to\nanalyze transport properties of turbulent flows with different anisotropy. In\ndirect numerical simulations of statistically homogeneous and stationary\nNavier-Stokes turbulence, neutral fluid Boussinesq convection, and MHD\nBoussinesq convection a comparison with Lagrangian pair dispersion shows that\nconvex hull statistics capture the asymptotic dispersive behavior of a large\ngroup of passive tracer particles. Moreover, convex hull analysis provides\nadditional information on the sub-ensemble of tracers that on average disperse\nmost efficiently in the form of extreme value statistics and flow anisotropy\nvia the geometric properties of the convex hulls. We use the convex hull\nsurface geometry to examine the anisotropy that occurs in turbulent convection.\nApplying extreme value theory, we show that the maximal square extensions of\nconvex hull vertices are well described by a classic extreme value\ndistribution, the Gumbel distribution. During turbulent convection,\nintermittent convective plumes grow and accelerate the dispersion of Lagrangian\ntracers. Convex hull analysis yields information that supplements standard\nLagrangian analysis of coherent turbulent structures and their influence on the\nglobal statistics of the flow.\n", "  Optomechanical cavities have proven to be an exceptional tool to explore\nfundamental and technological aspects of the interaction between mechanical and\noptical waves. Such interactions strongly benefit from cavities with large\noptomechanical coupling, high mechanical and optical quality factors, and\nmechanical frequencies larger than the optical mode linewidth, the so called\nresolved sideband limit. Here we demonstrate a novel optomechanical cavity\nbased on a disk with a radial mechanical bandgap. This design confines light\nand mechanical waves through distinct physical mechanisms which allows for\nindependent control of the mechanical and optical properties. Our device design\nis not limited by unique material properties and could be easily adapted to\nallow large optomechanical coupling and high mechanical quality factors with\nother promising materials. Finally, our demonstration is based on devices\nfabricated on a commercial silicon photonics facility, demonstrating that our\napproach can be easily scalable.\n", "  A general understanding of quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated\nmaterials is still lacking. By exploiting a cutting-edge quantum many-body\napproach, the dynamical vertex approximation, we make an important progress,\ndetermining the quantum critical properties of the antiferromagnetic transition\nin the fundamental model for correlated electrons, the Hubbard model in three\ndimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that -in contradiction to the\nconventional Hertz-Millis-Moriya theory- its quantum critical behavior is\ndriven by the Kohn anomalies of the Fermi surface, even when electronic\ncorrelations become strong.\n", "  The linear stability of three-dimensional (3D) vortices in rotating,\nstratified flows has been studied by analyzing the non-hydrostatic inviscid\nBoussinesq equations. We have focused on a widely-used model of geophysical and\nastrophysical vortices, which assumes an axisymmetric Gaussian structure for\npressure anomalies in the horizontal and vertical directions. For a range of\nRossby number ($-0.5 < Ro < 0.5$) and Burger number ($0.02 < Bu < 2.3$)\nrelevant to observed long-lived vortices, the growth rate and spatial structure\nof the most unstable eigenmodes have been numerically calculated and presented\nas a function of $Ro-Bu$. We have found neutrally-stable vortices only over a\nsmall region of the $Ro-Bu$ parameter space: cyclones with $Ro \\sim 0.02-0.05$\nand $Bu \\sim 0.85-0.95$. However, we have also found that anticyclones in\ngeneral have slower growth rates compared to cyclones. In particular, the\ngrowth rate of the most unstable eigenmode for anticyclones in a large region\nof the parameter space (e.g., $Ro<0$ and $0.5 \\lesssim Bu \\lesssim 1.3$) is\nslower than $50$ turn-around times of the vortex (which often corresponds to\nseveral years for ocean eddies). For cyclones, the region with such slow growth\nrates is confined to $0<Ro<0.1$ and $0.5 \\lesssim Bu \\lesssim 1.3$. While most\ncalculations have been done for $f/\\bar{N}=0.1$ (where $f$ and $\\bar{N}$ are\nthe Coriolis and background Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequencies), we have\nnumerically verified and explained analytically, using non-dimensionalized\nequations, the insensitivity of the results to reducing $f/\\bar{N}$ to the more\nocean-relevant value of $0.01$. The results of this paper provide a\nsteppingstone to study the more complicated problems of the stability of\ngeophysical (e.g., those in the atmospheres of giant planets) and astrophysical\nvortices (in accretion disks).\n", "  Soft solids with tunable mechanical response are at the core of new material\ntechnologies, but a crucial limit for applications is their progressive aging\nover time, which dramatically affects their functionalities. The generally\naccepted paradigm is that such aging is gradual and its origin is in slower\nthan exponential microscopic dynamics, akin to the ones in supercooled liquids\nor glasses. Nevertheless, time- and space-resolved measurements have provided\ncontrasting evidence: dynamics faster than exponential, intermittency, and\nabrupt structural changes. Here we use 3D computer simulations of a microscopic\nmodel to reveal that the timescales governing stress relaxation respectively\nthrough thermal fluctuations and elastic recovery are key for the aging\ndynamics. When thermal fluctuations are too weak, stress heterogeneities\nfrozen-in upon solidification can still partially relax through elastically\ndriven fluctuations. Such fluctuations are intermittent, because of strong\ncorrelations that persist over the timescale of experiments or simulations,\nleading to faster than exponential dynamics.\n", "  We study the effect of the Fermi surface anisotropy on the odd-frequency\nspin-triplet pairing component of the induced pair potential. We consider a\nsuperconductor/ ferromagnetic insulator (S/FI) hybrid structure formed on the\n3D topological insulator (TI) surface. In this case three ingredients insure\nthe possibility of the odd-frequency pairing: 1) the topological surface\nstates, 2) the induced pair potential, and 3) the magnetic moment of a nearby\nferromagnetic insulator. We take into account the strong anisotropy of the\nDirac cone in topological insulators when the chemical potential lies well\nabove the Dirac cone and its constant energy contour has a snowflake shape.\nWithin this model, we propose that the S/FI boundary should be properly aligned\nwith respect to the snowflake constant energy contour to have an odd-frequency\nsymmetry of the corresponding pairing component and to insure the Majorana\nbound state at the S/FI boundary. For arbitrary orientation of the boundary the\nMajorana bound state is absent. This provides a selection rule to the\nrealization of Majorana modes in S/FI hybrid structures, formed on the\ntopological insulator surface.\n", "  The structure of Bethe vectors for generalised models associated with the\nXXX- and XXZ-type R-matrix is investigated. The Bethe vectors in terms of\ntwo--component and multi--component models are described. Consequently, their\nstructure in terms of local variables and operators is provided. This, as a\nconsequence, proves the equivalence of coordinate and algebraic Bethe ansatzes\nfor the Heisenberg XXX and XXZ spin chains.\n", "  Understanding how correlations can be used for quantum communication\nprotocols is a central goal of quantum information science. While many authors\nhave linked global measures of correlations such as entanglement or discord to\nthe performance of specific protocols, in general the latter may require only\ncorrelations between specific observables. In this work, we first introduce a\ngeneral measure of correlations for two-qubit states based on the classical\nmutual information between local observables. We then discuss the role of the\nsymmetry in the state's correlations distribution and accordingly provide a\nclassification of maximally mixed marginals states (MMMS). We discuss the\ncomplementarity relation between correlations and coherence. By focusing on a\nsimple yet paradigmatic example, i.e., the remote state preparation protocol,\nwe introduce a method to systematically define proper protocol-tailored\nmeasures of correlations. The method is based on the identification of those\ncorrelations that are relevant (useful) for the protocol. The approach allows\non one hand to discuss the role of the symmetry of the correlations\ndistribution in determining the efficiency of the protocol, both for MMMS and\ngeneral two-qubit quantum states, and on the other hand to devise an optimized\nprotocol for non-MMMS that can have a better efficiency with respect to the\nstandard one. The scheme we propose can be extended to other communication\nprotocols and more general bipartite settings. Overall our findings clarify how\nthe key resources in simple communication protocols are the purity of the state\nused and the symmetry of correlations distribution.\n", "  We consider a system of infinitely many interacting Brownian motions that\nmodels the height of a one-dimensional interface between two bulk phases. We\nprove that the large scale fluctuations of the system are well approximated by\nthe solution to the KPZ equation provided the microscopic interaction is weakly\nasymmetric. The proof is based on the martingale solutions of Goncalves and\nJara and the corresponding uniqueness result of Gubinelli and Perkowski.\n", "  In the context of dilaton coupled Einstein gravity with a negative\ncosmological constant and a Born-Infeld field, we study heat engines where\ncharged black hole is the working substance. Using the existence of a notion of\nthermodynamic mass and volume (which depend on the dilaton coupling), the\nmechanical work takes place via the pdV terms present in the first law of\nextended gravitational thermodynamics. Efficiency is analyzed as a function of\ndilaton and Born-Infeld couplings, and results are compared with analogous\ncomputations in the related conformal solutions in the Brans-Dicke Born-Infeld\ntheory and black holes in Anti de Sitter space-time.\n", "  Direct detection of gravitational waves is opening a new window onto our\nuniverse. Here, we study the sensitivity to continuous-wave strain fields of a\nkg-scale optomechanical system formed by the acoustic motion of superfluid\nhelium-4 parametrically coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. This\nnarrowband detection scheme can operate at very high $Q$-factors, while the\nresonant frequency is tunable through pressurization of the helium in the\n0.1-1.5 kHz range. The detector can therefore be tuned to a variety of\nastrophysical sources and can remain sensitive to a particular source over a\nlong period of time. For reasonable experimental parameters, we find that\nstrain fields on the order of $h\\sim 10^{-23} /\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ are detectable.\nWe show that the proposed system can significantly improve the limits on\ngravitational wave strain from nearby pulsars within a few months of\nintegration time.\n", "  Mirror curves to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds can be quantized and lead to\ntrace class operators on the real line. The eigenvalues of these operators are\nencoded in the BPS invariants of the underlying threefold, but much less is\nknown about their eigenfunctions. In this paper we first develop methods in\nspectral theory to compute these eigenfunctions. We also provide a matrix\nintegral representation which allows to study them in a 't Hooft limit, where\nthey are described by standard topological open string amplitudes. Based on\nthese results, we propose a conjecture for the exact eigenfunctions which\ninvolves both the WKB wavefunction and the standard topological string\nwavefunction. This conjecture can be made completely explicit in the maximally\nsupersymmetric, or self-dual case, which we work out in detail for local P1xP1.\nIn this case, our conjectural eigenfunctions turn out to be closely related to\nBaker-Akhiezer functions on the mirror curve, and they are in full agreement\nwith first-principle calculations in spectral theory.\n", "  Multiple field models of inflation exhibit new features than single field\nmodels. In this work, we study the hierarchy of parameters based on Hubble\nexpansion rate in curved field space and derive the system of flow equations\nthat describe their evolution. Then we focus on obtaining derivatives of number\nof $e$-folds with respect to scalar fields during inflation and at hypersurface\nof the end of inflation.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions out of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase\nin (1+1) dimensions into an adjacent, topologically distinct SPT phase\nprotected by the same symmetry or a trivial gapped phase, are typically\ndescribed by a conformal field theory (CFT). At the same time, the low-lying\nentanglement spectrum of a gapped phase close to such a quantum critical point\nis known(Cho et al., arXiv:1603.04016), very generally, to be universal and\ndescribed by (gapless) boundary conformal field theory. Using this connection\nwe show that symmetry properties of the boundary conditions in boundary CFT can\nbe used to characterize the symmetry-protected degeneracies of the entanglement\nspectrum, a hallmark of non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases.\nSpecifically, we show that the relevant boundary CFT is the orbifold of the\nquantum critical point with respect to the symmetry group defining the SPT, and\nthat the boundary states of this orbifold carry a quantum anomaly that\ndetermines the topological class of the SPT. We illustrate this connection\nusing various characteristic examples such as the time-reversal breaking\n\"Kitaev chain\" superconductor (symmetry class D), the Haldane phase, and the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of interacting topological superconductors in\nsymmetry class BDI in (1+1) dimensions.\n", "  Observations of globular clusters show that they have universal lognormal\nmass functions with a characteristic peak at $\\sim 2\\times 10^{5}\\,\n{\\rm{M_{\\odot}}}$, but the origin of this peaked distribution is highly\ndebated. Here we investigate the formation and evolution of star clusters in\ninteracting galaxies using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed\nwith two different codes in order to mitigate numerical artifacts. We find that\nmassive star clusters in the range of $\\sim 10^{5.5} - 10^{7.5}\\,\n{\\rm{M_{\\odot}}}$ form preferentially in the highly-shocked regions produced by\ngalaxy interactions. The nascent cluster-forming clouds have high gas pressures\nin the range of $P/k \\sim 10^8 - 10^{12}\\, \\rm{K}\\,\\rm{cm^{-3}}$, which is\n$\\sim 10^4 - 10^8$ times higher than the typical pressure of the interstellar\nmedium but consistent with recent observations of a pre-super star cluster\ncloud in the Antennae Galaxies. Furthermore, these massive star clusters have\nquasi-lognormal initial mass functions with a peak around $\\sim 10^{6}\\,\n{\\rm{M_{\\odot}}}$. The number of clusters declines with time due to destructive\nprocesses, but the shape and the peak of the mass functions do not change\nsignificantly during the course of galaxy collisions. Our results suggest that\ngas-rich galaxy mergers may provide a favorable environment for the formation\nof massive star clusters such as globular clusters, and that the lognormal mass\nfunctions and the unique peak may originate from the extreme high-pressure\nconditions of the birth clouds and may survive the dynamical evolution.\n", "  A novel FPGA based online tracking algorithm for helix track reconstruction\nin a solenoidal field, developed for the PANDA spectrometer, is described.\nEmploying the Straw Tube Tracker detector with 4636 straw tubes, the algorithm\nincludes a complex track finder, and a track fitter. Implemented in VHDL, the\nalgorithm is tested on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX60 FPGA chip with different types of\nevents, at different event rates. A processing time of 7 $\\mu$s per event for\nan average of 6 charged tracks is obtained. The momentum resolution is about\n3\\% (4\\%) for $p_t$ ($p_z$) at 1 GeV/c. Comparing to the algorithm running on a\nCPU chip (single core Intel Xeon E5520 at 2.26 GHz), an improvement of 3 orders\nof magnitude in processing time is obtained. The algorithm can handle severe\noverlapping of events which are typical for interaction rates above 10 MHz.\n", "  This work presents the differential charmonia production cross sections in\nhigh energy p+p collisions calculated using NRQCD formalism. The NRQCD\nformalism, factorizes the quarkonia production cross sections in terms of short\ndistance QCD cross sections and long distance matrix elements (LDMEs). The\nshort distance cross sections are calculated in terms of perturbative QCD and\nLDMEs are obtained by fitting the experimental data. Measured transverse\nmomentum distributions of $\\chi_{\\rm c}$, $\\psi$(2S) and J/$\\psi$ in p +{$\\bar\n{\\rm p}$} collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 1.8, 1.96 TeV and in p+p collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=$ 7, 8 and 13 TeV are used to constrain LDMEs. The feed-down\ncontribution to each state from the higher states are taken into account. The\nformalism provides a very good description of the data in a wide energy range.\nThe values of LDMEs are used to predict the charmonia cross sections in p+p\ncollisions at 13 and 5 TeV in kinematic bins relevant for the LHC detectors.\n", "  Valley, as a degree of freedom, has been exploited to realize\nvalley-selective Hall transport and circular dichroism in two-dimensional\nlayered materials. On the other hand, orbital angular momentum of light with\nhelical phase distribution has attracted great attention for its unprecedented\nopportunity to optical communicagtions, atom trapping, and even nontrivial\ntopology engineering. Here, we reveal valley-contrasting orbital angular\nmomentum in all-dielectric photonic valley crystals. Selective excitation of\nvalley chiral bulk states is realized by sources carrying orbital angular\nmomentum with proper chirality. Valley dependent edge states, predictable by\nnonzero valley Chern number, enable to suppress the inter-valley scattering\nalong zigzag boundary, leading to broadband robust transmission in Z-shape bend\nwithout corner morphological optimization. Our work may open up a new door\ntowards the discovery of novel quantum states and the manipulation of\nspin-orbit interaction of light in nanophotonics.\n", "  We consider the four-point correlator of the stress tensor multiplet in\n${\\cal N}=4$ SYM in the limit of large central charge $c \\sim N^2$. For finite\nvalues of $g^2N$ single-trace intermediate operators arise at order $1/c$ and\nthis leads to specific poles in the Mellin representation of the correlator.\nThe sign of the residue at these poles is fixed by unitarity. We consider\nsolutions consistent with crossing symmetry and this pole structure. We show\nthat in a certain regime all solutions result in a negative contribution to the\nanomalous dimension of twist four operators. The reason behind this is a\npositivity property of Mack polynomials that leads to a positivity condition\nfor the Mellin amplitude. This positivity condition can also be proven by\nassuming the correct Regge behaviour for the Mellin amplitude. For large $g^2N$\nwe recover a tower of solutions in one to one correspondence with local\ninteractions in a effective field theory in the $AdS$ bulk, with the\nappropriate suppression factors, and with definite overall signs. These signs\nagree with the signs that would follow from causality constraints on the\neffective field theory. The positivity constraints arising from CFT for the\nMellin amplitude take a very similar form to the causality constraint for the\nforward limit of the S-matrix.\n", "  We study entropy production (EP) in processes involving repeated quantum\nmeasurements of finite quantum systems. Adopting a dynamical system approach,\nwe develop a thermodynamic formalism for the EP and study fine aspects of\nirreversibility related to the hypothesis testing of the arrow of time. Under a\nsuitable chaoticity assumption, we establish a Large Deviation Principle and a\nFluctuation Theorem for the EP.\n", "  Galaxies located in the environment or on the line of sight towards\ngravitational lenses can significantly affect lensing observables, and can lead\nto systematic errors on the measurement of $H_0$ from the time-delay technique.\nWe present the results of a systematic spectroscopic identification of the\ngalaxies in the field of view of the lensed quasar HE0435-1223, using the W. M.\nKeck, Gemini and ESO-Very Large telescopes. Our new catalog triples the number\nof known galaxy redshifts in the vicinity of the lens, expanding to 102 the\nnumber of measured redshifts for galaxies separated by less than 3 arcmin from\nthe lens. We complement our catalog with literature data to gather redshifts up\nto 15 arcmin from the lens, and search for galaxy groups or clusters projected\ntowards HE0435-1223. We confirm that the lens is a member of a small group that\nincludes at least 12 galaxies, and find 8 other group candidates near the line\nof sight of the lens. The flexion shift, namely the shift of lensed images\nproduced by high order perturbation of the lens potential, is calculated for\neach galaxy/group and used to identify which objects produce the largest\nperturbation of the lens potential. This analysis demonstrates that i) at most\nthree of the five brightest galaxies projected within 12 arcsec of the lens\nneed to be explicitly used in the lens models, and ii) the groups can be\ntreated in the lens model as an external tidal field (shear) contribution.\n", "  We describe a novel search for MeV-to-GeV-mass dark matter, in which the dark\nmatter scatters off electrons in a scintillating target. The excitation and\nsubsequent de-excitation of the electron produces one or more photons, which\ncould be detected with an array of cryogenic low-noise photodetectors, such as\ntransition edge sensors (TES) or microwave kinetic inductance devices (MKID).\nScintillators may have distinct advantages over other experiments searching for\na low ionization signal from sub-GeV DM. First, the detection of one or a few\nphotons may be technologically easier. Second, since no electric field is\nrequired to detect the photons, there may be far fewer dark counts mimicking a\nDM signal. We discuss various target choices, but focus on calculating the\nexpected dark matter-electron scattering rates in three scintillating crystals,\nsodium iodide (NaI), cesium iodide (CsI), and gallium arsenide (GaAs). Among\nthese, GaAs has the lowest band gap (1.52 eV) compared to NaI (5.9 eV) or CsI\n(6.4 eV), allowing it to probe dark matter masses possibly as low as ~0.5 MeV,\ncompared to ~1.5 MeV with NaI or CsI. We compare these scattering rates with\nthose expected in silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge). The proposed experimental\nconcept presents an important complementary path to existing efforts, and its\npotential advantages may make it the most sensitive direct-detection probe of\nDM down to MeV masses.\n", "  By using a Non-linear Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian, including the Higgs,\ncoupled to heavy quarks, and the Equivalence Theorem, we compute (in the regime\n$M_t^2/v^2\\ll\\sqrt{s}M_t/v^2\\ll s/v^2$) the one-loop amplitudes $W^+W^-\\to\nt\\bar t$, $ZZ\\to t\\bar t$ and $hh\\to t\\bar t$ (to NLO in the effective theory).\nWe calculate the scalar partial-wave helicity amplitudes which allow us to\ncheck unitarity at the perturbative level in both $M_t/v$ and $s/v$. As with\ngrowing energy perturbative unitarity deteriorates, we also introduce a new\nunitarization method with the right analytical behavior on the complex\n$s$-plane and that can support poles on the second Riemann sheet to describe\nresonances in terms of the Lagrangian couplings. Thus we have achieved a\nconsistent phenomenological description of any resonant $t\\bar t$ production\nthat may be enhanced by a possible strongly interacting Electroweak Symmetry\nBreaking Sector.\n", "  We discuss in a systematic way the gauge theory for a continuous spin\nparticle proposed by Schuster and Toro. We show that it is naturally formulated\nin a cotangent bundle over Minkowski spacetime where the gauge field depends on\nthe spacetime coordinate ${x^\\mu}$ and on a covector $\\eta_\\mu$. We discuss how\nfields can be expanded in $\\eta_\\mu$ in different ways and how these expansions\nare related to each other. The field equation has a derivative of a Dirac delta\nfunction with support on the $\\eta$-hyperboloid $\\eta^2+1=0$ and we show how it\nrestricts the dynamics of the gauge field to the $\\eta$-hyperboloid. We then\nshow that on-shell the field carries one single irreducible unitary\nrepresentation of the Poincar\\'e group for a continuous spin particle. We also\nshow how the field can be used to build a set of covariant equations found by\nWigner describing the wave function of one-particle states for a continuous\nspin particle. Finally we show that it is not possible to couple minimally a\ncontinuous spin particle to a background abelian gauge field, and make some\ncomments about the coupling to gravity.\n", "  The theory of quasi-neutral equilibrium states of charges above liquid\ndielectric surface is built. This theory is based on first principles of\nquantum statistics for systems, comprising many identical particles. The\nproposed approach is concerned with applying the variation principle, modified\nfor the considered systems, and the Thomas-Fermi model. In terms of the\ndeveloped theory a self-consistency equations are obtained. These equations\nprovide the relation between the main parameters, describing the system: the\npotential of static electric field, the distribution function of charges and\nthe surface profile of liquid dielectric. The equations are used to study the\nphase transition in the system to a spatially periodic state. The proposed\nmethod can be applied to analyzing the properties of the phase transition in\nthe system to a spatially periodic states of wave type. Using the analytical\nand numerical methods, we make a detailed research of the dependence of\ncritical parameters of such phase transition on the thickness of liquid\ndielectric film. Some stability criteria of the new asymmetric phase of the\nstudied system are discussed.\n", "  The critical properties of the phase transition from a normal gas to a BEC\n(superfluid) of a harmonically confined Bose gas are addressed with the\nknowledge of an equation of state of the underlying homogeneous Bose fluid. It\nis shown that while the presence of the confinement trap arrests the usual\ndivergences of the isothermal compressibility and heat capacities, the critical\nbehavior manifests itself now in the divergence of derivatives of the mentioned\nsusceptibilities. This result is illustrated with a mean-field like model of an\nequation of state for the homogeneous particle density as a function of the\nchemical potential and temperature of the gas. The model assumes the form of an\nideal Bose gas in the normal fluid while in the superfluid state a function is\nproposed such that, both, asymptotically reaches the Thomas-Fermi solution of a\nweakly interacting Bose gas at large densities and low temperatures and, at the\ntransition, matches the critical properties of the ideal Bose gas. With this\nmodel we obtain the {\\it global} thermodynamics of the harmonically confined\ngas, from which we analyze its critical properties. We discuss how these\nproperties can be experimentally tested.\n", "  The effect of spontaneous breaking of initial SO(3) symmetry is shown to be\npossible for an H-like atom in the ground state, when it is confined in a\nspherical box under general boundary conditions of \"not going out\" through the\nbox surface (i.e. third kind or Robin's ones), for a wide range of physically\nreasonable values of system parameters. The reason is that such boundary\nconditions could yield a large magnitude of electronic wavefunction in some\nsector of the box boundary, what in turn promotes atomic displacement from the\nbox center towards this part of the boundary, and so the underlying SO(3)\nsymmetry spontaneously breaks. The emerging Goldstone modes, coinciding with\nrotations around the box center, restore the symmetry by spreading the atom\nover a spherical shell localized at some distances from the box center. Atomic\nconfinement inside the cavity proceeds dynamically -- due to the boundary\ncondition the deformation of electronic wavefunction near the boundary works as\na spring, that returns the atomic nuclei back into the box volume.\n", "  A generalization of the mode stability result of Whiting (1989) for the\nTeukolsky equation is proved for the case of real frequencies. The main result\nof the paper states that a separated solution of the Teukolsky equation\ngoverning massless test fields on the Kerr spacetime, which is purely outgoing\nat infinity, and purely ingoing at the horizon, must vanish. This has the\nconsequence, that for real frequencies, there are linearly independent\nfundamental solutions of the radial Teukolsky equation which are purely ingoing\nat the horizon, and purely outgoing at infinity, respectively. This fact yields\na representation formula for solutions of the inhomogenous Teukolsky equation.\n", "  We calculate the q q correlation function associated to transverse target\nlepton-nucleon inclusive deep-inelastic scattering by direct evaluation of the\ncorresponding matrix element. We use the electromagnetic impact parameter\npotential for a transversely polarized nucleon to define the q q correlation\nfunction for each avor in terms of the field components of that avor. The\nresults are compared with the two existing models for the q q correlator. Using\nthe calculated q q correlation function, we estimated the transverse target SSA\nin IDIS process.\n", "  We study aspects of Heterotic/F-theory duality for compactifications with\nAbelian discrete gauge symmetries. We consider F-theory compactifications on\ngenus-one fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds with n-sections, associated with the\nTate-Shafarevich group Z_n. Such models are obtained by studying first a\nspecific toric set-up whose associated Heterotic vector bundle has structure\ngroup Z_n. By employing a conjectured Heterotic/F-theory mirror symmetry we\nconstruct dual geometries of these original toric models, where in the stable\ndegeneration limit we obtain a discrete gauge symmetry of order two and three,\nfor compactifications to six dimensions. We provide explicit constructions of\nmirror-pairs for symmetric examples with Z_2 and Z_3, in six dimensions. The\nHeterotic models with symmetric discrete symmetries are related in field theory\nto a Higgsing of Heterotic models with two symmetric abelian U(1) gauge\nfactors, where due to the Stuckelberg mechanism only a diagonal U(1) factor\nremains massless, and thus after Higgsing only a diagonal discrete symmetry of\norder n is present in the Heterotic models and detected via Heterotic/F-theory\nduality. These constructions also provide further evidence for the conjectured\nmirror symmetry in Heterotic/F-theory at the level of fibrations with torsional\nsections and those with multi-sections.\n", "  We show that the $\\Xi (1690)$ resonance can be dynamically generated in the\n$s$-wave $\\bar{K} \\Sigma$-$\\bar{K} \\Lambda$-$\\pi \\Xi$-$\\eta \\Xi$\ncoupled-channels chiral unitary approach. In our model, the $\\Xi (1690)$\nresonance appears near the $\\bar{K} \\Sigma$ threshold as a $\\bar{K} \\Sigma$\nmolecular state and the experimental data are reproduced well. We discuss\nproperties of the dynamically generated $\\Xi (1690)$.\n", "  The H-dibaryon is the exotic multiquark state with baryon number 2 and\nstrangeness $-2$. The existence of the deeply bound H-dibaryon is excluded by\nthe observation of the double hypernuclei. However the recent Lattice QCD\nsimulations have found the bound state below the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ threshold\nwith large quark masses by HALQCD and NPLQCD collaborations. In this talk, the\nquark mass dependence of the H-dibaryon mass is discussed using the pionless\neffective field theory (EFT) where a bare H-dibaryon field is coupled with\ntwo-baryon states. We determine the parameters in this theory by fitting the\nrecent Lattice QCD results in the SU(3) limit. As a result, we obtain the\nattractive scattering length at the physical point where the H-dibaryon is\nunbound.\n", "  We study the synchronization physics of 1D and 2D oscillator lattices subject\nto noise and predict a dynamical transition that leads to a sudden drastic\nincrease of phase diffusion. Our analysis is based on the widely applicable\nKuramoto-Sakaguchi model, with local couplings between oscillators. For smooth\nphase fields, the time evolution can initially be described by a surface growth\nmodel, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) theory. We delineate the regime in which\none can indeed observe the universal KPZ scaling in 1D lattices. For larger\ncouplings, both in 1D and 2D, we observe a stochastic dynamical instability\nthat is linked to an apparent finite-time singularity in a related KPZ lattice\nmodel. This has direct consequences for the frequency stability of coupled\noscillator lattices, and it precludes the observation of non-Gaussian\nKPZ-scaling in 2D lattices.\n", "  I argue that a version of the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds\nin any quantum error-correcting code. I present this result as a series of\ntheorems of increasing generality, with the final statement expressed in the\nlanguage of operator-algebra quantum error correction. In AdS/CFT this gives a\n\"purely boundary\" interpretation of the formula. I also extend a recent\ntheorem, which established entanglement-wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT, when\ninterpreted as a subsystem code, to the more general, and I argue more\nphysical, case of subalgebra codes. For completeness, I include a\nself-contained presentation of the theory of von Neumann algebras on\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as well as the algebraic definition of\nentropy. The results confirm a close relationship between bulk gauge\ntransformations, edge-modes/soft-hair on black holes, and the Ryu-Takayanagi\nformula. They also suggest a new perspective on the homology constraint, which\nbasically is to get rid of it in a way that preserves the validity of the\nformula, but which removes any tension with the linearity of quantum mechanics.\nMoreover they suggest a boundary interpretation of the \"bit threads\" recently\nintroduced by Freedman and Headrick.\n", "  There has been an increased focus on the integration of practices into\nphysics curricula, with a particular emphasis on integrating computation into\nthe undergraduate curriculum of scientists and engineers. In this paper, we\npresent a university-level, introductory physics course for science and\nengineering majors at Michigan State University (MSU) called ${\\rm P}^3$\n(Projects and Practices in Physics) that is centered around providing\nintroductory physics students with the opportunity to appropriate various\nscience and engineering practices. The ${\\rm P}^3$ design integrates\ncomputation with analytical problem solving and is built upon a curriculum\nfoundation of problem-based learning, the principles of constructive alignment\nand the theoretical framework of community of practice. The design includes an\ninnovative approach to computational physics instruction, instructional\nscaffolds, and a unique approach to assessment that enables instructors to\nguide students in the development of the practices of a physicist. We present\nthe very positive student related outcomes of the design gathered via\nattitudinal and conceptual inventories and research interviews of students'\nreflecting on their experiences in the ${\\rm P}^3$ classroom.\n", "  Using high-resolution simulations with explicit treatment of stellar feedback\nphysics based on the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments) project, we\nstudy how galaxy formation and the interstellar medium (ISM) are affected by\nmagnetic fields, anisotropic Spitzer-Braginskii conduction and viscosity, and\nsub-grid metal diffusion from unresolved turbulence. We consider controlled\nsimulations of isolated (non-cosmological) galaxies but also a limited set of\ncosmological \"zoom-in\" simulations. Although simulations have shown significant\neffects from these physics with weak or absent stellar feedback, the effects\nare much weaker than those of stellar feedback when the latter is modeled\nexplicitly. The additional physics have no systematic effect on galactic star\nformation rates (SFRs) . In contrast, removing stellar feedback leads to SFRs\nbeing over-predicted by factors of $\\sim 10 -100$. Without feedback, neither\ngalactic winds nor volume filling hot-phase gas exist, and discs tend to\nrunaway collapse to ultra-thin scale-heights with unphysically dense clumps\ncongregating at the galactic center. With stellar feedback, a multi-phase,\nturbulent medium with galactic fountains and winds is established. At currently\nachievable resolutions and for the investigated halo mass range\n$10^{10}-10^{13} M_{\\odot}$, the additional physics investigated here (MHD,\nconduction, viscosity, metal diffusion) have only weak ($\\sim10\\%$-level)\neffects on regulating SFR and altering the balance of phases, outflows, or the\nenergy in ISM turbulence, consistent with simple equipartition arguments. We\nconclude that galactic star formation and the ISM are primarily governed by a\ncombination of turbulence, gravitational instabilities, and feedback. We add\nthe caveat that AGN feedback is not included in the present work.\n", "  The surface code is a many-body quantum system, and simulating it in generic\nconditions is computationally hard. While the surface code is believed to have\na high threshold, the numerical simulations used to establish this threshold\nare based on simplified noise models. We present a tensor-network algorithm for\nsimulating error correction with the surface code under arbitrary local noise.\nWe use this algorithm to study the threshold and the subthreshold behavior of\nthe amplitude-damping and systematic rotation channels. We also compare these\nresults to those obtained by making standard approximations to the noise\nmodels.\n", "  The grand unified group $E_6$~is a predictive scheme for physics beyond the\nstandard model (SM). It offers the possibility of extra $Z$ bosons, new\nvector-like fermions, sterile neutrinos, and neutral scalars in addition to the\nSM Higgs boson. Some previous discussions of these features are updated and\nextended. Their relevance to present searches at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\nand in patterns of neutrino masses is noted. Addition of a small set of scalar\nbosons at the TeV scale permits gauge unification near a scale of $10^{16}$\nGeV, and leads to bounds on masses of particles beyond those in the standard\nmodel.\n", "  Effects of short-range electronic interactions in a three-dimensional\nline-node semimetal that supports linearly dispersing quasiparticles around an\nisolated loop in the Brillouin zone are discussed. Due to vanishing density of\nstates ($\\varrho(E) \\sim |E|$) various orderings in the bulk of the system,\nsuch as the antiferromagnet and charge-density-wave, set in for sufficiently\nstrong onsite ($U$) and nearest-neighbor ($V$) repulsions, respectively. While\nonset of these two orderings from the semimetallic phase takes place through\ncontinuous quantum phase transitions, a first-order transition separates two\nordered phases. By contrast, topologically protected drumhead shaped surface\nstates can undergo charge or spin orderings, depending on relative strength of\n$U$ and $V$, even when they are sufficiently weak. Such surface orderings as\nwell as weak long-range Coulomb interaction can be conducive to spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking in the bulk for weaker interactions. We numerically establish\nsuch proximity effect driven spontaneous symmetry breaking in the bulk for\nsubcritical strength of interactions due to flat surface band and also discuss\npossible superconducting orders in this system.\n", "  We experimentally explore the dynamic optical hysteresis of a semiconductor\nmicrocavity as a function of the sweep time. The hysteresis area exhibits a\ndouble power law decay due to the shot noise of the driving laser, which\ntriggers switching between metastable states. Upon increasing the average\nphoton number and approaching the thermodynamic limit, the double power law\nevolves into a single power law. This algebraic behavior characterizes a\ndissipative phase transition. Our findings are in good agreement with\ntheoretical predictions, and the present experimental approach is promising for\nthe exploration of critical phenomena in photonic lattices.\n", "  We derive the inclusive breakup cross section of a three-fragment projectile\nnuclei, $a = b +x_1 + x_2$, in the spectator model. The resulting four-body\ncross section for observing $b$, is composed of the elastic breakup cross\nsection which contains information about the correlation between the two\nparticipant fragments, and the inclusive non-elastic breakup cross section.\nThis latter cross section is found to be a non-trivial four-body generalization\nof the Austern formula \\cite{Austern1987}, which is proportional to a matrix\nelement of the form, $\\langle\\hat{\\rho}_{{x_1},{x_2}}\\left|\\left[W_{{x_1}} +\nW_{{x_2}} + W_{3B}\\right]\\right|\\hat{\\rho}_{{x_1}, {x_2}}\\rangle$. The new\nfeature here is the three-body absorption, represented by the imaginary\npotential, $W_{3B}$. We analyze this type of absorption and supply ideas of how\nto calculate its contribution.\n", "  We classify the weakly interacting fixed points of general gauge theories\ncoupled to matter and explain how the competition between gauge and matter\nfluctuations gives rise to a rich spectrum of high- and low-energy fixed\npoints. The pivotal role played by Yukawa couplings is emphasized. Necessary\nand sufficient conditions for asymptotic safety of gauge theories are also\nderived, in conjunction with strict no go theorems. Implications for phase\ndiagrams of gauge theories and physics beyond the Standard Model are indicated.\n", "  We consider a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS) posed on a graph or\nnetwork composed of a generic compact part to which a finite number of\nhalf-lines are attached. We call this structure a starlike graph. At the\nvertices of the graph interactions of $\\delta$-type can be present and an\noverall external potential is admitted. Under general assumptions on the\npotential, we prove that the NLS is globally well-posed in the energy domain.\nWe are interested in minimizing the energy of the system on the manifold of\nconstant mass ($L^2$-norm). When existing, the minimizer is called ground state\nand it is the profile of an orbitally stable standing wave for the NLS\nevolution. We prove that a ground state exists for sufficiently small masses\nwhenever the quadratic part of the energy admits a simple isolated eigenvalue\nat the bottom of the spectrum (the linear ground state). This is a wide\ngeneralization of a result previously obtained for a star graph with a single\nvertex. The main part of the proof is devoted to prove the concentration\ncompactness principle for starlike structures; this is non trivial due to the\nlack of translation invariance of the domain. Then we show that a minimizing\nbounded $H^1$ sequence for the constrained NLS energy with external linear\npotentials is in fact convergent if its mass is small enough. Examples are\nprovided with discussion of hypotheses on the linear part.\n", "  We apply the Darboux integrability method to determine first integrals and\nHamiltonian formulations of three dimensional polynomial systems; namely the\nreduced three-wave interaction problem, the Rabinovich system, the\nHindmarsh-Rose model, and the oregonator model. Additionally, we investigate\ntheir Hamiltonian, Nambu-Poisson and metriplectic characters.\n", "  In this paper we derive the tree-level S-matrix of the effective theory of\nGoldstone bosons known as the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) from string theory.\nThis novel connection relies on a recent realization of tree-level\nopen-superstring S-matrix predictions as a double copy of super-Yang-Mills\ntheory with Z-theory --- the collection of putative scalar effective field\ntheories encoding all the alpha'-dependence of the open superstring. Here we\nidentify the color-ordered amplitudes of the NLSM as the low-energy limit of\nabelian Z-theory. This realization also provides natural higher-derivative\ncorrections to the NLSM amplitudes arising from higher powers of alpha' in the\nabelian Z-theory amplitudes, and through double copy also to Born-Infeld and\nVolkov-Akulov theories. The Kleiss-Kuijf and Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations\nobeyed by Z-theory amplitudes thereby apply to all alpha'-corrections of the\nNLSM. As such we naturally obtain a cubic-graph parameterization for the\nabelian Z-theory predictions whose kinematic numerators obey the duality\nbetween color and kinematics to all orders in alpha'.\n", "  The paper reports analysis of momentum fractions carried by quarks and gluons\nin models of Proton structure functions at small $x$. First, we analyze the\nmodel proposed by Lastovicka based on self-similarity sometime back. We then\nmake a similar analysis for a second model based on the same notion which is\nalso free from singularity in $x$ : $0<x<1$. The predictions of both the models\nare then compared with a recent QCD based Froissart bound compatible model of\nproton structure function at small $x$, suggested by Block, Durand, Ha and\nMcKay. The results are then compared with the corresponding study in\nperturbative and Lattice QCD.\n", "  Stationary solution of one-dimensional Sine-Gordon system is embedded in a\nmultidimensional theory with explicitly finite domain in the added spatial\ndimensions. Semiclassical corrections to energy are calculated for static kink\nsolution with emphasis on the impact of scale of the domain as well as the\nchoice of boundary conditions on the results for rectangular cross-section.\n", "  Recent experiments with droplets impacting a macro-textured superhydrophobic\nsurfaces revealed new regimes of bouncing with a remarkable reduction of the\ncontact time. We present here a comprehensive numerical study that reveals the\nphysics behind these new bouncing regimes and quantify the role played by\nvarious external and internal forces that effect the dynamics of a drop\nimpacting a complex surface. For the first time, three-dimensional simulations\ninvolving macro-textured surfaces are performed. Aside from demonstrating that\nsimulations reproduce experiments in a quantitative manner, the study is\nfocused on analyzing the flow situations beyond current experiments. We show\nthat the experimentally observed reduction of contact time extends to higher\nWeber numbers, and analyze the role played by the texture density. Moreover, we\nreport a non-linear behavior of the contact time with the increase of the Weber\nnumber for application relevant imperfectly coated textures, and also study the\nimpact on tilted surfaces in a wide range of Weber numbers. Finally, we present\nnovel energy analysis techniques that elaborate and quantify the interplay\nbetween the kinetic and surface energy, and the role played by the dissipation\nfor various Weber numbers.\n", "  Conformal field theory (CFT) in two dimensions provide a rich source of\nsubfactors. The fact that there are so many subfactors coming from CFT have led\npeople to conjecture that perhaps all finite depth subfactors are related to\nCFT. In this paper we examine classes of subfactors from known CFT. In\nparticular we identify the so called $3^{\\Z_2\\times \\Z_2}$ subfactor with an\nintermediate subfactor from conformal inclusion, and construct new subfactors\nfrom recent work on holomorphic CFT with central charge $24$.\n", "  The effect of vacancies on the robustness of zero-energy edge electronic\nstates in zigzag-type graphene layer is studied at different concentrations and\ndistributions of defects. All calculations are performed by using the Green's\nfunction method and the tight-binding approximation. It is found that the\narrangement of defects plays a crucial role in the destruction of the edge\nstates. We have specified a critical distance between edge vacancies when their\nmutual influence becomes significant and affects markedly the density of\nelectronic states at graphene edge.\n", "  Leading twist light cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are key ingredients\nin calculating various hadronic amplitudes using light cone QCD sum rules. This\nwork concentrates on calculating the leading twist LCDAs of P-wave heavy\nquarkonia. Quark model wavefunctions for the ground, first and second excited\nstates of P-wave charmonia and bottomonia have been calculated, and are used\nfor calculating the relevant LCDAs and leptonic decay constants.\n", "  Chaos has revolutionized the field of nonlinear science and stimulated\nfoundational studies from neural networks, extreme event statistics, to physics\nof electron transport. Recent studies in cavity optomechanics provide a new\nplatform to uncover quintessential architectures of chaos generation and the\nunderlying physics. Here we report the generation of dynamical chaos in\nsilicon-based monolithic optomechanical oscillators, enabled by the strong and\ncoupled nonlinearities of two-photon-absorption induced Drude electron-hole\nplasma. Deterministic chaotic oscillation is achieved, and statistical and\nentropic characterization quantifies the chaos complexity at 60 fJ intracavity\nenergies. The correlation dimension D2 is determined at 1.67 for the chaotic\nattractor, along with maximal Lyapunov exponent rate about 2.94 the fundamental\noptomechanical oscillation for fast adjacent trajectory divergence. Nonlinear\ndynamical maps demonstrate the subharmonics, bifurcations, and stable regimes,\nalong with distinct transitional routes into chaos. This provides a\nCMOS-compatible and scalable architecture for understanding complex dynamics on\nthe mesoscopic scale.\n", "  We study massless scalar theory with the quartic self-interacting term far\naway from and near to evaporating and spherically symmetric black hole. We\npropose a principle of how to define the physical notion of particle in curved\nspace-time. Employing this definition, we compute one-loop correction to the\nself-energy and coupling constant of the scalar field near the horizon in the\nfreely-falling frame. We find that the coupling constant becomes slightly\nstronger near to the horizon. We also find that the term in the 2-point\nfunction that is (partially) responsible for the black-hole evaporation\ncorresponds to the sub-leading correction to the Feynman propagator whose pole\nstructure is of the leading order.\n", "  The Gaussian entire function is a random entire function, characterised by a\ncertain invariance with respect to isometries of the plane. We study the\nfluctuations of the increment of the argument of the Gaussian entire function\nalong planar curves. We introduce an inner product on finite formal linear\ncombinations of curves (with real coefficients), that we call the signed\nlength, which describes the limiting covariance of the increment. We also\nestablish asymptotic normality of fluctuations.\n", "  Onsager's phenomenological equations successfully describe irreversible\nthermodynamic processes. They assume a symmetric coupling matrix between\nthermodynamic fluxes and forces. It is easily shown that the antisymmetric part\nof a coupling matrix does not contribute to dissipation. Therefore, entropy\nproduction is exclusively governed by the symmetric matrix even in the presence\nof antisymmetric terms. In this work we focus on the antisymmetric\ncontributions which describe isentropic oscillations and well-defined equations\nof motion. The formalism contains variables that are equivalent to momenta, and\ncoefficients that are analogous to an inertial mass. We apply this formalism to\nsimple problems such as an oscillating piston and the oscillation in an\nelectrical LC-circuit. We show that isentropic oscillations are possible even\nclose to equilibrium in the linear limit and one does not require far-from\nequilibrium situations. One can extend this formalism to other pairs of\nvariables, including chemical systems with oscillations. In isentropic\nthermodynamic systems all extensive and intensive variables including\ntemperature can display oscillations reminiscent of adiabatic waves.\n", "  We investigate the physical properties of a purely kinetic k-essence model\nwith an equation of state motivated in superconducting membranes. We compute\nthe equation of state parameter $w$ and discuss its physical evolution via a\nnonlinear equation of state. Using the adiabatic speed of sound and energy\ndensity, we restrict the range of parameters of the model in order to have an\nacceptable physical behavior. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of the\nluminosity distance $d_{L}$ with redshift $z$ by comparing (normalizing) it\nwith the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Since the equation of state parameter is\n$z$-dependent the evolution of the luminosity distance is also analyzed using\nthe Alcock-Paczy\\'{n}ski test.\n", "  The FemtoDAQ is a low-cost two channel data acquisition system which we have\nused to investigate the signal characteristics of silicon photomultipliers\n(SiPMs) coupled to fast scintillators. The FemtoDAQ system can also be used to\ninstrument low cost moderate performance passive detectors, and is suitable for\nuse in harsh environments (e.g., high altitude). The FemtoDAQ is being used as\na SiPM test bench for the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, a\nTeV gamma ray detector located 4100 m above sea level. Planned upgrades to the\nHAWC array can benefit greatly from SiPMs, a robust, low-voltage, low-cost\nalternative to traditional vacuum photomultipliers. The FemtoDAQ is used to\npower the SiPM detector front end, bias the SiPM, and digitize the photosensor\noutput in a single compact unit.\n", "  The Friedrichs model with one discrete state coupled to more than one\ncontinuum is studied. The exact eigenstates for the full Hamiltonian can be\nsolved explicitly. The discrete state is found to generate more than one\nvirtual state pole or more than one pair of resonance poles in different\nRiemann sheets in different situations. The form factors could also generate\nnew states on different sheets. All these states can appear in the generalized\ncompleteness relation.\n", "  Active control of light-matter interactions in semiconductors is critical for\nrealizing next generation optoelectronic devices, with tunable control of the\nsystems optical properties via external fields. The ability to manipulate\noptical interactions in active materials coupled to cavities via geometrical\nparameters, which are fixed along with dynamic control with applied fields\nopens up possibilities of controlling exciton lifetimes, oscillator strengths\nand their relaxation properties. Here, we demonstrate electrical control of\nexciton-plasmon polariton coupling strength of a two-dimensional semiconductor\nintegrated with plasmonic nanoresonators assembled in a field-effect transistor\ndevice between strong and weak coupling limits by electrostatic doping. As a\nresult, the exciton-plasmon polarion dispersion can be altered dynamically with\napplied electric field by modulating the excitonic properties of monolayer MoS2\narising from many-body effects with carrier concentration. In addition, strong\ncoupling between charged excitons plasmons was also observed upon increased\ncarrier injection. The ability to dynamically control the optical properties of\nan ultra-thin semiconductor with plasmonic nanoresonators and electric fields\ndemonstrates the versatility of the coupled system and offers a new platform\nfor the design of optoelectronic devices with precisely tailored responses.\n", "  Characterizing how entanglement grows with time in a many-body system, for\nexample after a quantum quench, is a key problem in non-equilibrium quantum\nphysics. We study this problem for the case of random unitary dynamics,\nrepresenting either Hamiltonian evolution with time--dependent noise or\nevolution by a random quantum circuit. Our results reveal a universal structure\nbehind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for\nthe `entanglement tsunami' in Hamiltonian systems without noise. In 1D, we show\nthat noise causes the entanglement entropy across a cut to grow according to\nthe celebrated Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation. The mean entanglement\ngrows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like $(\\text{time})^{1/3}$ and\nare spatially correlated over a distance $\\propto (\\text{time})^{2/3}$. We\nderive KPZ universal behaviour in three complementary ways, by mapping random\nentanglement growth to: (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface; (ii) a\n`minimal cut' picture, reminiscent of the Ryu--Takayanagi formula in\nholography; and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading\nof operators. We demonstrate KPZ universality in 1D numerically using\nsimulations of random unitary circuits. Importantly, the leading order time\ndependence of the entropy is deterministic even in the presence of noise,\nallowing us to propose a simple `minimal cut' picture for the entanglement\ngrowth of generic Hamiltonians, even without noise, in arbitrary\ndimensionality. We clarify the meaning of the `velocity' of entanglement growth\nin the 1D `entanglement tsunami'. We show that in higher dimensions, noisy\nentanglement evolution maps to the well-studied problem of pinning of a\nmembrane or domain wall by disorder.\n", "  We introduce a nonreciprocal nongyrotropic magnetless metasurface. In\ncontrast to previous nonreciprocal structures, this metasurface does not\nrequire a biasing magnet, and is therefore lightweight and amenable to\nintegrated circuit fabrication. Moreover, it does not induce Faraday rotation,\nand hence does not alter the polarization of waves, which is a desirable\nfeature in many nonreciprocal devices. The metasurface is designed according to\na Surface-Circuit-Surface (SCS) architecture and leverages the inherent\nunidirectionality of transistors for breaking time reversal symmetry.\nInteresting features include transmission gain as well as broad operating\nbandwidth and angular sector operation. It is finally shown that the\nmetasurface is bianisotropic in nature, with nonreciprocity due to the\nelectric-magnetic coupling parameters, and structurally equivalent to a moving\nuniaxial metasurface.\n", "  We revisit a water glass experiment often used to demonstrate a rainbow. On a\ncloser look, it also turns out to be a rather close analogy of a different kind\nof atmospheric optics phenomenon altogether: The geometry may be used to\nfaithfully reproduce the circumzenithal and the circumhorizontal halos,\nproviding a missing practical demonstration experiment for those beautiful and\ncommon natural ice halo displays.\n", "  Under the assumption of the Abelian dominance in QCD, we show that chiral\ncondensate is locally present around a QCD monopole. The appearance of the\nchiral condensate around a GUT monopole was shown in the previous analysis of\nthe Rubakov effect. We apply a similar analysis to the QCD monopole. It follows\nthat the condensation of the monopole carrying the chiral condensate leads to\nthe chiral symmetry breaking as well as quark confinement. To realize the\nresult explicitly, we present a phenomenological linear sigma model coupled\nwith the monopoles, in which the monopole condensation causes the chiral\nsymmetry breaking as well as confinement. The monopoles are assumed to be\ndescribed by a model of dual superconductor. Because the monopoles couple with\nmesons, we point out the presence of an observable color singlet monopole\ncoupled with the mesons.\n", "  Recent works in automated radiotherapy treatment planning have used machine\nlearning based on historical treatment plans to infer the spatial dose\ndistribution for a novel patient directly from the planning image. We present\nan atlas-based approach which learns a dose prediction model for each patient\n(atlas) in a training database, and then learns to match novel patients to the\nmost relevant atlases. The method creates a spatial dose objective, which\nspecifies the desired dose-per-voxel, and therefore replaces any requirement\nfor specifying dose-volume objectives for conveying the goals of treatment\nplanning. A probabilistic dose distribution is inferred from the most relevant\natlases, and is scalarized using a conditional random field to determine the\nmost likely spatial distribution of dose to yield a specific dose prior\n(histogram) for relevant regions of interest. Voxel-based dose mimicking then\nconverts the predicted dose distribution to a deliverable treatment plan dose\ndistribution. In this study, we investigated automated planning for right-sided\noropharaynx head and neck patients treated with IMRT and VMAT. We compare four\nversions of our dose prediction pipeline using a database of 54 training and 12\nindependent testing patients. Our preliminary results are promising; automated\nplanning achieved a higher number of dose evaluation criteria in 7 patients and\nan equal number in 4 patients compared with clinical. Overall, the relative\nnumber of criteria achieved was higher for automated planning versus clinical\n(17 vs 8) and automated planning demonstrated increased sparing for organs at\nrisk (52 vs 44) and better target coverage/uniformity (41 vs 31).\n", "  In nonrelatistic quantum mechanics, Born's principle of localistion is as\nfollows: For a single particle, if a wave function $\\psi_K$ vanishes outside a\nspatial region $K$, it is said to be localised in $K$. In particular if a\nspatial region $K'$ is disjoint from $K$, a wave function $\\psi_{K'}$ localised\nin $K'$ is orthogonal to $\\psi_K$.\n  Such a principle of localisation does not exist compatibly with relativity\nand causality in quantum field theory (Newton and Wigner) or interacting point\nparticles (Currie,Jordan and Sudarshan).It is replaced by symplectic\nlocalisation of observables as shown by Brunetti, Guido and Longo, Schroer and\nothers. This localisation gives a simple derivation of the spin-statistics\ntheorem and the Unruh effect, and shows how to construct quantum fields for\nanyons and for massless particles with `continuous' spin.\n  This review outlines the basic principles underlying symplectic localisation\nand shows or mentions its deep implications. In particular, it has the\npotential to affect relativistic quantum information theory and black hole\nphysics.\n", "  Whether Jordan's and Einstein's frame descriptions of F(R) theory of gravity\nare physically equivalent, is a long standing debate. However, practically none\nquestioned on true mathematical equivalence, since classical field equations\nmay be translated from one frame to the other following a transformation\nrelation. Here we show that neither Noether symmetries, Noether equations, nor\nmay quantum equations be translated from one to the other. The reason being, -\nconformal transformation results in a completely different system, with a\ndifferent Lagrangian. Field equations match only due to the presence of\ndiffeomorphic invariance. Unless a symmetry generator is found which involves\nHamiltonian constraint equation, the mathematical equivalence between the two\nframes appears to be vulnerable. In any case, in quantum domain Mathematical\nand therefore physical equivalence can't be established.\n", "  Stored antiprotons beams in the GeV range represent a unparalleled factory\nfor hyperon-antihyperon pairs. Their outstanding large production probability\nin antiproton collisions will open the floodgates for a series of new studies\nof strange hadronic systems with unprecedented precision. The behavior of\nhyperons and -- for the first time -- of antihyperons in nuclear systems can be\nstudied under well controlled conditions. The exclusive production of\n$\\Lambda\\bar{\\Lambda}$ and $\\Sigma^-\\bar{\\Lambda}$ pairs in antiproton-nucleus\ninteractions probe the neutron and proton distribution in the nuclear periphery\nand will help to sample the neutron skin. For the first time, high resolution\n$\\gamma$-spectroscopy of doubly strange nuclei will be performed, thus\ncomplementing measurements of ground state decays of double hypernuclei with\nmesons beams at J-PARC or possible decays of particle unstable hypernuclei in\nheavy ion reactions. High resolution spectroscopy of multistrange $\\Xi$-atoms\nare feasible and even the production of $\\Omega^-$-atoms will be within reach.\nThe latter might open the door to the $|s|$=3 world in strangeness nuclear\nphysics, by the study of the hadronic $\\Omega^-$-nucleus interaction and the\nvery first measurement of a spectroscopic quadrupole moment of a baryon which\nwill be a benchmark test for our understanding of hadron structure.\n", "  We present experimental evidence for the different mechanisms driving the\nfluctuations of the local density of states (LDOS) in disordered photonic\nsystems. We establish a clear link between the microscopic structure of the\nmaterial and the frequency correlation function of LDOS accessed by a\nnear-field hyperspectral imaging technique. We show, in particular, that short-\nand long-range frequency correlations of LDOS are controlled by different\nphysical processes (multiple or single scattering processes, respectively) that\ncan be---to some extent---manipulated independently. We also demonstrate that\nthe single scattering contribution to LDOS fluctuations is sensitive to\nsubwavelength features of the material and, in particular, to the correlation\nlength of its dielectric function. Our work paves a way towards a complete\ncontrol of statistical properties of disordered photonic systems, allowing for\ndesigning materials with predefined correlations of LDOS.\n", "  We perform a refined count of BPS states in the compactification of M-theory\non $K3 \\times T^2$, keeping track of the information provided by both the\n$SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$ angular momenta in the $SO(4)$ little group.\nMathematically, this four variable counting function may be expressed via the\nmotivic Donaldson-Thomas counts of $K3 \\times T^2$, simultaneously refining\nKatz, Klemm, and Pandharipande's motivic Donaldson-Thomas counts on $K3$ and\nOberdieck-Pandharipande's Gromov-Witten counts on $K3 \\times T^2$. This\nprovides the first full answer for motivic curve counts of a compact Calabi-Yau\nthreefold. Along the way, we develop a Hodge-elliptic genus for Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds -- a new counting function for BPS states that interpolates between\nthe Hodge polynomial and the elliptic genus of a Calabi-Yau.\n", "  We investigate the constraints of crossing symmetry on CFT correlation\nfunctions. Four point conformal blocks are naturally viewed as functions on the\nupper-half plane, on which crossing symmetry acts by PSL(2,Z) modular\ntransformations. This allows us to construct a unique, crossing symmetric\nfunction out of a given conformal block by averaging over PSL(2,Z). In some two\ndimensional CFTs the correlation functions are precisely equal to the modular\naverage of the contributions of a finite number of light states. For example,\nin the two dimensional Ising and tri-critical Ising model CFTs, the correlation\nfunctions of identical operators are equal to the PSL(2,Z) average of the\nVirasoro vacuum block; this determines the 3 point function coefficients\nuniquely in terms of the central charge. The sum over PSL(2,Z) in CFT2 has a\nnatural AdS3 interpretation as a sum over semi-classical saddle points, which\ndescribe particles propagating along rational tangles in the bulk. We\ndemonstrate this explicitly for the correlation function of certain heavy\noperators, where we compute holographically the semi-classical conformal block\nwith a heavy internal operator.\n", "  The Coleman-Mandula (CM) theorem states that the Poincar\\'e and internal\nsymmetries of a Minkowski spacetime quantum field theory cannot combine\nnontrivially in an extended symmetry group. We establish an analogous result\nfor quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, assuming local covariance, the\ntimeslice property, a local dynamical form of Lorentz invariance, and\nadditivity. Unlike the CM theorem, our result is valid in dimensions $n\\ge 2$\nand for free or interacting theories. It is formulated for theories defined on\na category of all globally hyperbolic spacetimes equipped with a global\ncoframe, on which the restricted Lorentz group acts, and makes use of a general\nanalysis of symmetries induced by the action of a group $G$ on the category of\nspacetimes. Such symmetries are shown to be canonically associated with a\ncohomology class in the second degree nonabelian cohomology of $G$ with\ncoefficients in the global gauge group of the theory. Our main result proves\nthat the cohomology class is trivial if $G$ is the universal cover $\\cal S$ of\nthe restricted Lorentz group. Among other consequences, it follows that the\nextended symmetry group is a direct product of the global gauge group and $\\cal\nS$, all fields transform in multiplets of $\\cal S$, fields of different spin do\nnot mix under the extended group, and the occurrence of noninteger spin is\ncontrolled by the centre of the global gauge group. The general analysis is\nalso applied to rigid scale covariance.\n", "  The gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field enclosed with a\nperfectly reflecting wall in a spacetime with a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$\nis investigated. The mass scaling for the gapped collapse $ M_{AH}-M_g \\propto\n(\\epsilon_c-\\epsilon)^\\xi$ is confirmed and a new time scaling for the gapped\ncollapse $T_{AH}-T_g\\propto(\\epsilon_c-\\epsilon)^\\zeta$ is found. We find that\nboth of these two critical exponents depend on the combination $\\Lambda R^2$,\nwhere $R$ is the radial position of the reflecting wall. Especially, we find an\nevolution of the critical exponent $\\xi$ from $0.37$ in the confined asymptotic\ndS case with $\\Lambda R^2=1.5$ to $0.7$ in asymptotic AdS case ($\\Lambda\nR^2\\rightarrow-\\infty$), while the critical exponent $\\zeta$ varies from $0.10$\nto $0.26$, which shows the new critical behavior for the gapped collapse is\nessentially different from the one in the Choptuik's case.\n", "  We present the first estimate of the Ly{\\alpha} luminosity function using\nblind spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, MUSE, in the\nHubble Deep Field South. Using automatic source-detection software, we assemble\na homogeneously-detected sample of 59 Ly{\\alpha} emitters covering a flux range\nof -18.0 < log10 (F) < -16.3 (erg s^-1 cm^-2), corresponding to luminosities of\n41.4 < log10 (L) < 42.8 (erg s^-1). As recent studies have shown, Ly{\\alpha}\nfluxes can be underestimated by a factor of two or more via traditional\nmethods, and so we undertake a careful assessment of each object's Ly{\\alpha}\nflux using a curve-of-growth analysis to account for extended emission. We\ndescribe our self-consistent method for determining the completeness of the\nsample, and present an estimate of the global Ly{\\alpha} luminosity function\nbetween redshifts 2.91 < z < 6.64 using the 1/Vmax estimator. We find the\nluminosity function is higher than many number densities reported in the\nliterature by a factor of 2 - 3, although our result is consistent at the\n1{\\sigma} level with most of these studies. Our observed luminosity function is\nalso in good agreement with predictions from semi-analytic models, and shows no\nevidence for strong evolution between the high- and low-redshift halves of the\ndata. We demonstrate that one's approach to Ly{\\alpha} flux estimation does\nalter the observed luminosity function, and caution that accurate flux\nassessments will be crucial in measurements of the faint end slope. This is a\npilot study for the Ly{\\alpha} luminosity function in the MUSE deep-fields, to\nbe built on with data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field which will increase the\nsize of our sample by almost a factor of 10.\n", "  We consider waves radiated by a disturbance of oscillating strength moving at\nconstant velocity along the free surface of a shear flow which, when\nundisturbed, has uniform horizontal vorticity of magnitude $S$. When no current\nis present the problem is a classical one and much studied, and in deep water a\nresonance is known to occur when $\\tau=|\\boldsymbol{V}|\\omega_0/g$ equals the\ncritical value $1/4$ ($\\boldsymbol{V}$: velocity of disturbance, $\\omega_0$:\noscillation frequency, $g$: gravitational acceleration). We show that the\npresence of the sub-surface shear current can change this picture radically.\nNot only does the resonant value of $\\tau$ depend strongly on the angle between\n$\\boldsymbol{V}$ and the current's direction and the \"shear-Froude number\"\n$\\mathrm{Frs}=|\\boldsymbol{V}|S/g$; when $\\mathrm{Frs}>1/3$, multiple resonant\nvalues --- as many as $4$ --- can occur for some directions of motion. At\nsufficiently large values of $\\mathrm{Frs}$, the smallest resonance frequency\ntends to zero, representing the phenomenon of critical velocity for ship waves.\nWe provide a detailed analysis of the dispersion relation for the moving,\noscillating disturbance, in both finite and infinite water depth, including for\nthe latter case an overview of the different far-field waves which exist in\ndifferent sectors of wave vector space under different conditions. Owing to the\nlarge number of parameters, a detailed discussion of the structure of\nresonances is provided for infinite depth only, where analytical results are\navailable.\n", "  We study theoretically and numerically a new kind of spatial correlation for\nwaves in disordered media. We define $C_{\\Gamma}$ as the correlation function\nof the fluorescent decay rate of an emitter at two different positions inside\nthe medium. We show that the amplitude and the width of $C_{\\Gamma}$ provide\ndecoupled information on the structural correlation of the disordered medium\nand on the local environment of the emitter. This result may stimulate the\nemergence of new imaging and sensing modalities in complex media.\n", "  The production of beauty hadrons was measured via semi-leptonic decays at\nmid-rapidity with the ALICE detector at the LHC in the transverse momentum\ninterval $1<p_{\\rm T}<8$ GeV/$c$ in minimum-bias p-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV and in $1.3<p_{\\rm T}<8$ GeV/$c$ in the 20% most\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The pp reference\nspectra at $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV, needed for the\ncalculation of the nuclear modification factors $R_{\\rm pPb}$ and $R_{\\rm\nPbPb}$, were obtained by a pQCD-driven scaling of the cross section of\nelectrons from beauty-hadron decays measured at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV. In the\n$p_{\\rm T}$ interval $3<p_{\\rm T}<8$ GeV/$c$ a suppression of the yield of\nelectrons from beauty-hadron decays is observed in Pb-Pb compared to pp\ncollisions. Towards lower $p_{\\rm T}$, the $R_{\\rm PbPb}$ values increase with\nlarge systematic uncertainties. The $R_{\\rm pPb}$ is consistent with unity\nwithin systematic uncertainties and is well described by theoretical\ncalculations that include cold nuclear matter effects in p-Pb collisions. The\nmeasured $R_{\\rm pPb}$ and these calculations indicate that cold nuclear matter\neffects are small at high transverse momentum also in Pb-Pb collisions.\nTherefore, the observed reduction of $R_{\\rm PbPb}$ below unity at high $p_{\\rm\nT}$ may be ascribed to an effect of the hot and dense medium formed in Pb-Pb\ncollisions.\n", "  Quantum Hall edge modes are chiral while quantum spin Hall edge modes are\nhelical. However, unlike chiral edge modes which always occur in topological\nsystems, quasi-helical edge modes may arise in a trivial insulator too. These\ntrivial quasi-helical edge modes are not topologically protected and therefore\nneed to be distinguished from helical edge modes arising due to topological\nreasons. Earlier conductance measurements were used to identify these helical\nstates, in this work we report on the advantage of using the non local shot\nnoise as a probe for the helical nature of these states as also their\ntopological or otherwise origin and compare them with chiral quantum Hall\nstates. We see that in similar set-ups affected by same degree of disorder and\ninelastic scattering, non local shot noise \"HBT\" correlations can be positive\nfor helical edge modes but are always negative for the chiral quantum Hall edge\nmodes. Further, while trivial quasi-helical edge modes exhibit negative\nnon-local \"HBT\" charge correlations, topological helical edge modes can show\npositive non-local \"HBT\" charge correlation. We also study the non-local spin\ncorrelations and Fano factor for clues as regards both the distinction between\nchirality/helicity as well as the topological/trivial dichotomy for helical\nedge modes.\n", "  A new frontier in the search for dark matter (DM) is based on the idea of\ndetecting the decoherence caused by DM scattering against a mesoscopic\nsuperposition of normal matter. Such superpositions are uniquely sensitive to\nvery small momentum transfers from new particles and forces, especially DM with\na mass below 100 MeV. Here we investigate what sorts of dark sectors are\ninaccessible with existing methods but would induce noticeable decoherence in\nthe next generation of matter interferometers. We show that very soft, but\nmedium range (0.1 nm - 1 $\\mu$m) elastic interactions between nuclei and DM are\nparticularly suitable. We construct toy models for such interactions, discuss\nexisting constraints, and delineate the expected sensitivity of forthcoming\nexperiments. The first hints of DM in these devices would appear as small\nvariations in the anomalous decoherence rate with a period of one sidereal day.\nThis is a generic signature of interstellar sources of decoherence, clearly\ndistinguishing it from terrestrial backgrounds. The OTIMA experiment under\ndevelopment in Vienna will begin to probe Earth-thermalizing DM once sidereal\nvariations in the background decoherence rate are pushed below one part in a\nhundred for superposed 5-nm gold nanoparticles. The proposals by Bateman et al.\nand Geraci et al. could be similarly sensitive, although they would require at\nleast a month of data taking. DM that is absorbed or elastically reflected by\nthe Earth, and so avoids a greenhouse density enhancement, would not be\ndetectable by those three experiments. On the other hand, the aggressive\nproposals of the MAQRO collaboration and Pino et al. would immediately open up\nmany orders of magnitude in DM mass, interaction range, and coupling strength,\nregardless of how DM behaves in bulk matter.\n", "  The story told in this autobiographical perspective begins fifty years ago at\nthe 1967 Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Liquids. It\ntraces developments in liquid-state science from that time, including\ncontributions from the author, and especially in the study of liquid water. It\nemphasizes the importance of fluctuations, and the challenges of\nfar-from-equilibrium phenomena.\n", "  In the present paper and the companion paper [9] a probabilistic\n(statistical-mechanical) approach to the construction of canonical metrics on a\ncomplex algebraic varieties X is introduced, by sampling \"temperature deformed\"\ndeterminantal point processes. The main new ingredient is a large deviation\nprinciple for Gibbs measures with singular Hamiltonians, which is proved in the\npresent paper. As an application we show that the unique Kahler-Einstein metric\nwith negative Ricci curvature on a canonically polarized algebraic manifold X\nemerges in the many particle limit of the canonical point processes on X. In\nthe companion paper [9] the extension to algebraic varieties X with positive\nKodaira dimension is given and a conjectural picture relating negative\ntemperature states to the existence problem for Kahler-Einstein metrics with\npositive Ricci curvature is developed.\n", "  Global temperature is a fundamental climate metric highly correlated with sea\nlevel, which implies that keeping shorelines near their present location\nrequires keeping global temperature within or close to its preindustrial\nHolocene range. However, global temperature excluding short-term variability\nnow exceeds +1degC relative to the 1880-1920 mean and annual 2016 global\ntemperature was almost +1.3degC. We show that global temperature has risen well\nout of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as during the prior\ninterglacial, when sea level reached 6-9 meters higher than today. Further,\nEarth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying\nmore warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse\ngas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity\nof ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to\npredict but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. Targets for limiting\nglobal warming should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at Eemian or\nhigher levels for centuries. Such targets require \"negative emissions\",\nextraction of CO2 from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins\nsoon, improved agricultural and forestry practices may provide much of the\nextraction, and the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion\nabove the natural range of the current interglacial could be limited and\nirreversible impacts minimized. In contrast, continued high emissions place a\nburden on young people to undertake massive technological CO2 extraction to\nlimit climate change and its consequences. Proposed methods of extraction have\nminimal estimated costs of 89-535 trillion dollars this century and have large\nrisks and uncertain feasibility. Continued high emissions unarguably sentences\nyoung people to a massive, implausible cleanup, growing deleterious climate\nimpacts or both.\n", "  Currently only a small number of Milky Way (MW) stars are known to exist\nbeyond 100 kpc from the Galactic center. Though the distribution of these stars\nin the outer halo is believed to be sparse, they can provide evidence of more\nrecent accretion events than in the inner halo and help map out the MW's dark\nmatter halo to its virial radius. We have re-examined the outermost regions of\n11 existing stellar halo models with two synthetic surveys: one mimicking\npresent-day searches for distant M giants and another mimicking RR Lyrae (RRLe)\nprojections for LSST. Our models suggest that color and proper motion cuts\ncurrently used to select M giant candidates for follow-up successfully remove\nnearly all halo dwarf self-contamination and are useful for focusing\nobservations on distant M giants, of which there are thousands to tens of\nthousands beyond 100 kpc in our models. We likewise expect that LSST will\nidentify comparable numbers of RRLe at these distances. We demonstrate that\nseveral observable properties of both tracers, such as proximity of neighboring\nstars, proper motions, and distances (for RRLe) could help us separate\ndifferent accreted structures from one another. We also discuss prospects for\nusing ratios of M giants to RRLe as a proxy for accretion time, which in the\nfuture could provide new constraints on the recent accretion history of our\nGalaxy.\n", "  In this Letter we construct the noncommutative (NC) gravity model on the\n$\\theta$-constant NC space-time. We start from the NC $SO(2,3)_\\star$ gauge\ntheory and use the enveloping algebra approach and the Seiberg-Witten map to\nconstruct the effective NC gravity action. The action and the equations of\nmotion are expanded up to second order in the deformation parameter. The\nequations of motion show that the noncommutativity plays a role of a source for\nthe curvature and/or torsion. Finally, we calculate the NC corrections to the\nMinkowski space-time and we show that in the presence of noncommutativity\nMinkowski space-time becomes curved, but remains torsion-free. The breaking of\ndiffeomorphism invariance is understood in terms of the preferred coordinate\nsystem. We show that the coordinates we are using are the Fermi normal\ncoordinates. This suggests that the natural coordinate system in which one\nshould study NC gravity is given by the Fermi normal coordinates.\n", "  We report on a device that integrates eight superconducting transmon qubits\nin lambda/4 superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators fed from a common\nfeedline. Using this multiplexing architecture, each resonator and qubit can be\naddressed individually thus reducing the required hardware resources and\nallowing their individual characterisation by spectroscopic methods. The\nmeasured device parameters agree with the designed values and the resonators\nand qubits exhibit excellent coherence properties and strong coupling, with the\nqubit relaxation rate dominated by the Purcell effect when brought in resonance\nwith the resonator. Our analysis shows that the circuit is suitable for\ngeneration of single microwave photons on demand with an efficiency exceeding\n80%.\n", "  This article introduces the notion of Generalized Poisson-Kac (GPK) processes\nwhich generalize the class of \"telegrapher's noise dynamics\" introduced by Marc\nKac in 1974, usingPoissonian stochastic perturbations. In GPK processes the\nstochastic perturbation acts as a switching amongst a set of stochastic\nvelocity vectors controlled by a Markov-chain dynamics. GPK processes possess\ntrajectory regularity (almost everywhere) and asymptotic Kac limit, namely the\nconvergence towards Brownian motion (and to stochastic dynamics driven by\nWiener perturbations), which characterizes also the long-term/long-distance\nproperties of these processes. In this article we introduce the structural\nproperties of GPK processes, leaving all the physical implications to part II\nand part III.\n", "  In this second part, we analyze the dissipation properties of Generalized\nPoisson-Kac (GPK) processes, considering the decay of suitable $L^2$-norms and\nthe definition of entropy functions. In both cases, consistent energy\ndissipation and entropy functions depend on the whole system of primitive\nstatistical variables, the partial probability density functions $\\{\np_\\alpha({\\bf x},t) \\}_{\\alpha=1}^N$, while the corresponding energy\ndissipation and entropy functions based on the overall probability density\n$p({\\bf x},t)$ do not satisfy monotonicity requirements as a function of time.\nExamples from chaotic advection (standard map coupled to stochastic GPK\nprocesses) illustrate this phenomenon. Some complementary physical issues are\nalso addressed: the ergodicity breaking in the presence of attractive\npotentials, and the use of GPK perturbations to mollify stochastic field\nequations.\n", "  This third part extends the theory of Generalized Poisson-Kac (GPK) processes\nto nonlinear stochastic models and to a continuum of states. Nonlinearity is\ntreated in two ways: (i) as a dependence of the parameters (intensity of the\nstochastic velocity, transition rates) of the stochastic perturbation on the\nstate variable, similarly to the case of nonlinear Langevin equations, and (ii)\nas the dependence of the stochastic microdynamic equations of motion on the\nstatistical description of the process itself (nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kac\nmodels). Several numerical and physical examples illustrate the theory.\nGathering nonlinearity and a continuum of states, GPK theory provides a\nstochastic derivation of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation, furnishing a\npositive answer to the Kac's program in kinetic theory. The transition from\nstochastic microdynamics to transport theory within the framework of the GPK\nparadigm is also addressed.\n", "  We study various semiclassical observables in the duality proposed by\nGuarino, Jafferis and Varela, between a warped $AdS_4\\times$ squashed $S^6$\ngravitational solution and a 3 dimensional ${\\cal N}=2$ SYM-CS$_k$ conformal\ngauge theory, deformed from the maximal $SU(N)$ ${\\cal N}=8$ SYM. Baryon\nvertices corresponding to particle-like branes have unusual behaviour with $N$\nand $k$ and present strong evidence for a certain level-rank duality. Wilson\nloops and the anomalous dimensions of operators of high spin scale like\n$(N/k)^{3/2}$. The entanglement entropy behaves like in a usual CFT. Giant\nmagnon operators obey the same law as in 4 dimensional ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM, and\ngiant gravitons are also sub-determinant operators.\n", "  We review the current (as of Fall 2016) status of the studies on the emergent\nintegrability in many-body localized models. We start by explaining how the\nphenomenology of fully many-body localized systems can be recovered if one\nassumes the existence of a complete set of (quasi)local operators which commute\nwith the Hamiltonian (local integrals of motion, or LIOMs). We describe the\nevolution of this idea from the initial conjecture, to the perturbative\nconstructions, to the mathematical proof given for a disordered spin chain. We\ndiscuss the proposed numerical algorithms for the construction of LIOMs and the\nstatus of the debate on the existence and nature of such operators in systems\nwith a many-body mobility edge, and in dimensions larger than one.\n", "  In strong laser fields, sub-femtosecond control of chemical reactions with\nthe carrier-envelope phase (CEP) becomes feasible. We have studied the control\nof reaction dynamics of acetylene and allene in intense few-cycle laser pulses\nat 750 nm, where ionic fragments are recorded with a reaction microscope. We\nfind that by varying the CEP and intensity of the laser pulses it is possible\nto steer the motion of protons in the molecular dications, enabling control\nover deprotonation and isomerization reactions. The experimental results are\ncompared to predictions from a quantum dynamical model, where the control is\nbased on the manipulation of the phases of a vibrational wave packet by the\nlaser waveform. The measured intensity dependence in the CEP-controlled\ndeprotonation of acetylene is well captured by the model. In the case of the\nisomerization of acetylene, however, we find differences in the intensity\ndependence between experiment and theory. For the isomerization of allene, an\ninversion of the CEP-dependent asymmetry is observed when the intensity is\nvaried, which we discuss in light of the quantum dynamical model. The inversion\nof the asymmetry is found to be consistent with a transition from\nnon-sequential to sequential double ionization.\n", "  The resource theories of quantum coherence attract a lot of attention in\nrecent years. Especially, the monotonicity property plays a crucial role here.\nIn this paper we investigate the monotonicity property for the coherence\nmeasures induced by the R\\'{e}nyi $\\alpha$-relative entropy which present in\n[Phys. Rev. A 94, 052336, 2016]. We show that the R\\'{e}nyi $\\alpha$-relative\nentropy of coherence does not in general satisfy the monotonicity requirement\nunder the subselection of measurements condition and it also does not satisfy\nthe extension of monotonicity requirement which presents in [Phys. Rev. A 93,\n032136, 2016]. Due to the R\\'{e}nyi $\\alpha$-relative entropy of coherence can\nact as a coherence monotone quantifier, we examine the trade-off relations\nbetween coherence and mixedness. Finally, some properties for the single qubit\nof R\\'{e}nyi $2$-relative entropy of coherence are derived.\n", "  The high-mobility 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between certain insulating\nperovskite oxides have been known to be a novel playground of exotic physical\norders like, superconductivity and ferromagnetism and their inter-coupling.\nThere have been efforts to accomplish even more exotic properties at such\ninterfaces of oxide heterostructures through nano-structuring of the surface.\nIn this paper we report writing and erasing charge domains on such an oxide\nheterostructure LaVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ using a conductive AFM cantilever. We have\npatterned these domains in a periodic fashion in order to create artificial\nlattices on the surface. Through kelvin probe microscopy, electrostatic force\nmicroscopy and conductivity mapping of such artificial lattices we found that\nthe domains not only trap charge carriers but also develop a controllable\npotential landscape on the surface which coincides with a modulation of local\nelectrical conductivity. The ability to pattern such nanostructures reversibly\noffers unprecedented opportunities of realizing ultra-high storage density\ndevices in high mobility oxide heterostructures.\n", "  In this paper, we embed the model of flipped GUT sneutrino inflation -in a\nflipped SU(5) or SO(10) set up- developed by Ellis et al. in a supergravity\nframework. The GUT symmetry is broken by a waterfall which could happen at\nearly or late stage of the inflationary period. The full field dynamics is thus\nstudied in detail and these two main inflationary configurations are exposed,\nwhose cosmological predictions are both in agreement with recent astrophysical\nmeasurements. The model has an interesting feature where the inflaton has\nnatural decay channels to the MSSM particles allowed by the GUT gauge symmetry.\nHence it can account for the reheating after the inflationary epoch.\n", "  In the absence of external excitation, light trapped within a dielectric\nmedium generally decays by leaking out (and also by getting absorbed within the\nmedium). We analyze the leaky modes of a parallel-plate slab, a solid glass\nsphere, and a solid glass cylinder, by examining those solutions of Maxwell's\nequations (for dispersive as well as non-dispersive media) which admit of a\ncomplex-valued oscillation frequency. Under certain circumstances, these leaky\nmodes constitute a complete set into which an arbitrary distribution of the\nelectromagnetic field residing inside a dielectric body can be expanded. We\nprovide completeness proofs, and also present results of numerical calculations\nthat illustrate the relationship between the leaky modes and the resonances of\ndielectric cavities formed by a simple parallel-plate slab, a glass sphere, and\na glass cylinder.\n", "  Metals from Population III (Pop III) supernovae led to the formation of less\nmassive Pop II stars in the early universe, altering the course of evolution of\nprimeval galaxies and cosmological reionization. There are a variety of\nscenarios in which heavy elements from the first supernovae were taken up into\nsecond-generation stars, but cosmological simulations only model them on the\nlargest scales. We present small-scale, high-resolution simulations of the\nchemical enrichment of a primordial halo by a nearby supernova after partial\nevaporation by the progenitor star. We find that ejecta from the explosion\ncrash into and mix violently with ablative flows driven off the halo by the\nstar, creating dense, enriched clumps capable of collapsing into Pop II stars.\nMetals may mix less efficiently with the partially exposed core of the halo, so\nit might form either Pop III or Pop II stars. Both Pop II and III stars may\nthus form after the collision if the ejecta do not strip all the gas from the\nhalo. The partial evaporation of the halo prior to the explosion is crucial to\nits later enrichment by the supernova.\n", "  What is nuclear symmetry energy? Why is it important? What do we know about\nit? Why is it so uncertain especially at high densities? Can the total symmetry\nenergy or its kinetic part be negative? What are the effects of three-body\nand/or tensor force on symmetry energy? How can we probe the density dependence\nof nuclear symmetry energy with terrestrial nuclear experiments? What\nobservables of heavy-ion reactions are sensitive to the high-density behavior\nof nuclear symmetry energy? How does the symmetry energy affect properties of\nneutron stars, gravitational waves and our understanding about the nature of\nstrong-field gravity? In this lecture, we try to answer these questions as best\nas we can based on some of our recent work and/or understanding of research\ndone by others. This note summarizes the main points of the lecture.\n", "  Offshore wind energy development is underway in the U.S., with proposed sites\nlocated in hurricane-prone regions. Turbine design criteria outlined by the\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission do not encompass the extreme wind\nspeeds and directional shifts of hurricanes stronger than a Category 2. We\nexamine the most turbulent portion of a hurricane (the eyewall) using\nlarge-eddy simulations with Cloud Model 1 (CM1). Gusts and mean wind speeds\nnear the eyewall exceed the current design threshold of 50 m s-1 mean wind and\n70 m s-1 gusts for Class I turbines. Gust factors are greatest at the\neye-eyewall interface. Further, shifts in wind direction at wind turbine hub\nheight suggest turbines must rotate into the wind faster than current practice.\nAlthough current design standards omit mention of wind direction change across\nthe rotor layer, large values (15-50 deg) suggest that veer should be\nconsidered in design standards.\n", "  The analytical solution of a many-body localization problem in a quantum\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model in a random longitudinal field is\nproposed matching the problem with a model of Anderson localization in a Bethe\nlattice. The localization transition is dramatically sensitive to the\nrelationship between interspin interaction and random field revealing different\nregimes in which the interaction can either suppress or enhance the\ndelocalization. The localization is enhanced by decreasing the temperature and\nthe localization transition shows a remarkable universality in a spin glass\nphase. The observed trends should be qualitatively relevant for other systems\nshowing many-body localization.\n", "  A storage scheme based on racetrack memory, where the information can be\ncoded in a domain or a skyrmion, seems to be an alternative to conventional\nhard disk drive for high density storage. Here, we perform a full micromagnetic\nstudy of the performance of synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) racetrack memory\nin terms of velocity and sensitivity to defects by using experimental\nparameters. We find that to stabilize a SAF skyrmion, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nInteraction in the top and the bottom ferromagnet should have an opposite sign.\nThe velocity of SAF skyrmion and SAF Neel domain wall are of the same order and\ncan reach values larger than 1200 m/s if a spin-orbit torque from the spin-Hall\neffect with opposite sign is applied to both ferromagnets.\n", "  Monogamy is an intrinsic feature of quantum correlations that gives rise to\nseveral interesting quantum characteristics which are not amenable to classical\nexplanations. The monogamy property imposes physical restrictions on\nunconditional sharability of quantum correlations between the different parts\nof a multipartite quantum system, and thus has a direct bearing on the\ncooperative properties of states of multiparty systems, including large\nmany-body systems. On the contrary, a certain party can be maximally classical\ncorrelated with an arbitrary number of parties in a multiparty system. In\nrecent years, the monogamy property of quantum correlations has been applied to\nunderstand several key aspects of quantum physics, including distribution of\nquantum resources, security in quantum communication, critical phenomena, and\nquantum biology. In this chapter, we look at some of the salient developments\nand applications in quantum physics that have been closely associated with the\nmonogamy of quantum discord, and \"discord-like\" quantum correlation measures.\n", "  Usually, Monte Carlo models are validated against experimental data. However,\nmodels of multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) in the Gaussian approximation are\nexceptional in that we have theories which are probably more accurate than the\nexperiments which have, so far, been done to test them. In problems directly\nsensitive to the distribution of angles leaving the target, the relevant theory\nis the Moliere/Fano/Hanson variant of Moliere theory. For transverse spreading\nof the beam in the target itself, the theory of Preston and Koehler holds.\n  Therefore, in this paper we compare Geant4 simulations, using the Urban and\nWentzel models of MCS, with theory rather than experiment, revealing trends\nwhich would otherwise be obscured by experimental scatter. For medium-energy\n(radiotherapy) protons, and low-Z (water-like) target materials, Wentzel\nappears to be better than Urban in simulating the distribution of outgoing\nangles. For beam spreading in the target itself, the two models are essentially\nequal.\n", "  Localization in interacting systems caused by disorder, known as many-body\nlocalization (MBL), has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Most\nsystems studied in this context also show single-particle localization, and the\nquestion of MBL is whether the phenomena survives the effects of interactions.\nIt is intriguing to consider a system with no single-particle localization but\nwhich does localize in the presence of many particles. The localization\nphenomena occurs \"due to\" rather than \"in spite of\" interactions in such\nsystems. We consider a simple bosonic system and show that interactions enhance\nthe effects of very weak disorder and result in localization when many\nparticles are present. We provide physical insights into the mechanism involved\nand support our results with analytical and numerical calculations.\n", "  We use gauge-gravity duality to compute entanglement entropy in a\nnon-conformal background with an energy scale $\\Lambda$. At zero temperature,\nwe observe that entanglement entropy decreases by raising $\\Lambda$. However,\nat finite temperature, we realize that both $\\frac{\\Lambda}{T}$ and\nentanglement entropy rise together. Comparing entanglement entropy of the\nnon-conformal theory, $S_{A(N)}$, and of its conformal theory at the $UV$\nlimit, $ S_{A(C)}$, reveals that $S_{A(N)}$ can be larger or smaller than\n$S_{A(C)}$, depending on the value of $\\frac{\\Lambda}{T}$.\n", "  Based on our Faddeev-Yakubowsky calculations of four-body kaonic nuclear\nsystems it was revealed that the structure of K-K-pp is well approximated by\ntwo Lambda*=K-p's with strong mutual attraction. It is vitally important to\nstudy this nucleus, as it is an essential gateway toward multi-Lambda* nuclei.\nTwo experimental proposals are presented: i) production of K-K-pp by p+p\nreactions at T_p = 7 GeV, and ii) search for K-K-pp from the invariant mass of\nM(Lambda-Lambda) around 2.6 GeV/c2 in high-energy HI reactions.\n", "  Artificial Neural Networks are computational network models inspired by\nsignal processing in the brain. These models have dramatically improved the\nperformance of many learning tasks, including speech and object recognition.\nHowever, today's computing hardware is inefficient at implementing neural\nnetworks, in large part because much of it was designed for von Neumann\ncomputing schemes. Significant effort has been made to develop electronic\narchitectures tuned to implement artificial neural networks that improve upon\nboth computational speed and energy efficiency. Here, we propose a new\narchitecture for a fully-optical neural network that, using unique advantages\nof optics, promises a computational speed enhancement of at least two orders of\nmagnitude over the state-of-the-art and three orders of magnitude in power\nefficiency for conventional learning tasks. We experimentally demonstrate\nessential parts of our architecture using a programmable nanophotonic\nprocessor.\n", "  It is shown that conserved charges associated with a specific subclass of\ngauge symmetries of Maxwell electrodynamics are proportional to the well known\nelectric multipole moments. The symmetries are residual gauge transformations\nsurviving after fixing the Lorenz gauge, and have nontrivial charge. These\n\"Multipole charges\" receive contributions both from the charged matter and\nelectromagnetic fields. The former is nothing but the electric multipole moment\nof the source. In a stationary configuration, there is a novel equipartition\nrelation between the two contributions. The multipole charge, while conserved,\ncan freely interpolate between the source and the electromagnetic field, and\ntherefore can be propagated with the radiation. Using the multipole charge\nconservation, we obtain infinite number of constraints over the radiation\nproduced by the dynamics of charged matter.\n", "  The Verma modules over the quantum groups $\\mathrm U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}_{l +\n1})$ for arbitrary values of $l$ are analysed. The explicit expressions for the\naction of the generators on the elements of the natural basis are obtained. The\ncorresponding representations of the quantum loop algebras $\\mathrm\nU_q(\\mathcal L(\\mathfrak{sl}_{l + 1}))$ are constructed via Jimbo's\nhomomorphism. This allows us to find certain representations of the positive\nBorel subalgebras of $\\mathrm U_q(\\mathcal L(\\mathfrak{sl}_{l + 1}))$ as\ndegenerations of the shifted representations. The latter are the\nrepresentations used in the construction of the so-called $Q$-operators in the\ntheory of quantum integrable systems. The interpretation of the corresponding\nsimple quotient modules in terms of representations of the $q$-deformed\noscillator algebra is given.\n", "  We provide a comprehensive comparison of W/Z vector boson production data in\nproton-lead and lead-lead collisions at the LHC with predictions obtained using\nthe nCTEQ15 PDFs. We identify the measurements which have the largest potential\nimpact on the PDFs, and estimate the effect of including these data using a\nMonte Carlo reweighting method. We find this data set can provide information\nabout both the nuclear corrections and the heavy flavor (strange) PDF\ncomponents. As the proton flavor determination is dependent on nuclear\ncorrections (from heavy target DIS, for example), this information can also\nhelp improve the proton PDFs.\n", "  In BV formalism we can consider a Lagrangian submanifold as a gauge\ncondition. Starting with the BV action functional we construct a closed form on\nthe space of Lagrangian submanifolds. If the action functional is invariant\nwith respect to some group $H$ and $\\Lambda$ is an $H$-invariant family of\nLagrangian submanifold then under certain conditions we construct a form on\n$\\Lambda$ that descends to a closed form on $\\Lambda/H.$ Integrating the latter\nform over a cycle in $\\Lambda/H$ we obtain numbers that can have interesting\nphysical meaning. We show that one can get string amplitudes this way. Applying\nthis construction to topological quantum field theories one obtains topological\ninvariants.\n", "  We show how a novel fine-tuning problem present in the Standard Model can be\nsolved through the introduction of a single flavour symmetry G, together with\nthree $Q = - 1/3$ quarks, three $Q = 2/3$ quarks, as well as a complex singlet\nscalar. The symmetry G is extended to the additional fields and it is an exact\nsymmetry of the Lagrangian, only spontaneously broken by the vacuum. Specific\nexamples are given and a phenomenological analysis of the main features of the\nmodel is presented. It is shown that even for vector-like quarks with masses\naccessible at the LHC, one can have realistic quark masses and mixing, while\nrespecting the strict constraints on process arising from flavour changing\nneutral currents (FCNC). The vector-like quark decay channels are also\ndescribed.\n", "  Vibrational spectra and wavefunctions of polyatomic molecules can be\ncalculated at low memory cost using low-rank sum-of-product (SOP)\ndecompositions to represent basis functions generated using an iterative\neigensolver. Using a SOP tensor format does not determine the iterative\neigensolver. The choice of the interative eigensolver is limited by the need to\nrestrict the rank of the SOP basis functions at every stage of the calculation.\nWe have adapted, implemented and compared different reduced-rank algorithms\nbased on standard iterative methods (block-Davidson algorithm, Chebyshev\niteration) to calculate vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions of the\n12-dimensional acetonitrile molecule. The effect of using low-rank SOP basis\nfunctions on the different methods is analyzed and the numerical results are\ncompared with those obtained with the reduced rank block power method\nintroduced in J. Chem. Phys. 140, 174111 (2014). Relative merits of the\ndifferent algorithms are presented, showing that the advantage of using a more\nsophisticated method, although mitigated by the use of reduced-rank\nsum-of-product functions, is noticeable in terms of CPU time.\n", "  The production of p K+ {\\Lambda} in elementary p + p collision was\ninvestigated using the Bonn Gatchina Partial Wave Analysis framework. This\napproach allows the determination of possible participating production wave\ndepending on the quantum numbers of the system. For the analysis seven data\nsamples, measured at different detectors and beam energies, were used.For the\nextraction of the p{\\Lambda} scattering length a cross check with established\nmethods is required. Furthermore the total cross section of the production\nprocess is needed to be determined to extra cross section for the separate\nwaves. Both methods are described in this work.\n", "  We provide an analysis of the x-dependence of the bare unpolarized, helicity\nand transversity iso-vector parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice\ncalculations employing (maximally) twisted mass fermions. The x-dependence of\nthe calculated PDFs resembles the one of the phenomenological\nparameterizations, a feature that makes this approach very promising.\nFurthermore, we apply momentum smearing for the relevant matrix elements to\ncompute the lattice PDFs and find a large improvement factor when compared to\nconventional Gaussian smearing. This allows us to extend the lattice\ncomputation of the distributions to higher values of the nucleon momentum,\nwhich is essential for the prospects of a reliable extraction of the PDFs in\nthe future.\n", "  Raman interactions in alkali vapours are used in applications such as atomic\nclocks, optical signal processing, generation of squeezed light and Raman\nquantum memories for temporal multiplexing. To achieve a strong interaction the\nalkali ensemble needs both a large optical depth and a high level of\nspin-polarisation. We implement a technique known as quenching using a\nmolecular buffer gas which allows near-perfect spin-polarisation of over\n$99.5\\%$ in caesium vapour at high optical depths of up to $\\sim 2 \\times\n10^5$; a factor of 4 higher than can be achieved without quenching. We use this\nsystem to explore efficient light storage with high gain in a GHz bandwidth\nRaman memory.\n", "  The band offsets between crystalline and hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n(a-Si:H) are key parameters governing the charge transport in modern silicon\nhetrojunction solar cells. They are an important input for macroscopic\nsimulators that are used to further optimize the solar cell. Past experimental\nstudies, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and capacitance-voltage\nmeasurements, have yielded conflicting results on the band offset. Here we\npresent a computational study on the band offsets. It is based on atomistic\nmodels and density-functional theory (DFT). The amorphous part of the interface\nis obtained by relatively long DFT first-principles molecular-dynamics (MD)\nruns at an elevated temperature on 30 statistically independent samples. In\norder to obtain a realistic conduction band position the electronic structure\nof the interface is calculated with a hybrid functional. We find a slight\nasymmetry in the band offsets, where the offset in the valence band (0.30 eV)\nis larger than in the conduction band (0.17 eV). Our results are in agreement\nwith the latest XPS measurements that report a valence band offset of 0.3 eV\n[M. Liebhaber et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 106, 031601 (2015)].\n", "  We study dispersion properties of linear surface gravity waves propagating in\nan arbitrary direction atop a current profile of depth-varying magnitude using\na piecewise linear approximation, and develop a robust numerical framework for\npractical calculation. The method has been much used in the past for the case\nof waves propagating along the same axis as the background current, and we\nherein extend and apply it to problems with an arbitrary angle between the wave\npropagation and current directions. Being valid for all wavelengths without\nloss of accuracy, the scheme is particularly well suited to solve problems\ninvolving a broad range of wave vectors, such as ship waves and Cauchy-Poisson\ninitial value problems for example. We examine the group and phase velocities\nover different wavelength regimes and current profiles, highlighting\ncharacteristics due to the depth-variable vorticity. We show an example\napplication to ship waves on an arbitrary current profile, and demonstrate\nqualitative differences in the wake patterns between concave down and concave\nup profiles when compared to a constant shear profile with equal depth-averaged\nvorticity. We also discuss the nature of additional solutions to the dispersion\nrelation when using the piecewise-linear model. These are vorticity waves,\ndrifting vortical structures which are artifacts of the piecewise model. They\nare absent for a smooth profile and are spurious in the present context.\n", "  We report an implementation of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding\n($\\sigma$), isotope-independent indirect spin-spin coupling ($K$) and the\nmagnetizability ($\\xi$) tensors in the frozen density embedding (FDE) scheme\nusing the four-component (4c) relativistic Dirac--Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian and\nthe non-collinear spin density functional theory (SDFT). The formalism takes\ninto account the magnetic balance between the large and the small components of\nmolecular spinors and assures the gauge-origin independence of NMR shielding\nand magnetizability results. This implementation has been applied to\nhydrogen-bonded HXH$\\cdots$OH$_2$ complexes (X = Se, Te, Po) and compared with\nthe supermolecular calculations and with the approach based on the integration\nof the magnetically induced current density vector. A comparison with the\napproximate Zeroth-Order Regular Approximation (ZORA) Hamiltonian indicates\nnon-negligible differences in $\\sigma$ and $K$ in the HPoH$\\cdots$OH$_2$\ncomplex, and calls for a thourough comparison of ZORA and DC in the description\nof environment effects on NMR parameters for molecular systems with heavy\nelements.\n", "  We present numerical evidence for the occurrence of coherent backscattering\nin the Fock space of a small disordered Bose-Hubbard system consisting of four\nsites and containing five particles. This many-body interference phenomenon can\nmost conveniently be seen in time evolution processes that start from a Fock\nstate of the Bose-Hubbard system. It manifests itself in an enhanced detection\nprobability of this initial state as compared to other Fock states with\ncomparable total energy. We argue that coherent backscattering in Fock space\ncan be experimentally measured with ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices\nusing state-of-the-art single-site detection techniques. A synthetic gauge\nfield can be induced in order to break time-reversal symmetry within the\nlattice and thereby destroy coherent backscattering. While this many-body\ninterference effect is most prominently visible in the presence of eigenstate\nthermalization, we briefly discuss its significance in the opposite regime of\nmany-body localization.\n", "  Two-species condensing zero range processes (ZRPs) are interacting particle\nsystems with two species of particles and zero range interaction exhibiting\nphase separation outside a domain of sub-critical densities. We prove the\nhydrodynamic limit of nearest neighbour mean zero two-species condensing zero\nrange processes with bounded local jump rate for sub-critical initial profiles,\ni.e., for initial profiles whose image is contained in the region of\nsub-critical densities. The proof is based on H. T. Yau's relative entropy\nmethod, which relies on the existence of sufficiently regular solutions to the\nhydrodynamic equation. In the particular case of the species-blind ZRP, we\nprove that the solutions of the hydrodynamic equation exist globally in time\nand thus the hydrodynamic limit is valid for all times.\n", "  The impact of surface reflection upon transmission through and energy\ndistributions within random media has generally been described in terms of the\nboundary extrapolation lengths $z_b, z_b'$ at the input and output end of an\nopen sample, which are the distance beyond the sample surfaces at which the\nenergy density within the sample extrapolates to zeroThe importance of\nreflection at the sample boundaries plays a key role in the scaling of\ntransmission. Here we consider the impact of surface reflection on the\npropagation of diffusive waves in terms of the modification of the distribution\nof transmission eigenvalues (DTE). We review our finding of a transition in the\nanalytical form of the DTE at the point that the sample length equals\n$|z_b-z_b'|$. The highest transmission eigenvalue for stronger asymmetry in\nboundary reflection is strictly smaller than unity. The average transmission\nand profiles of energy density inside the sample can still be described in\nterms of the sample length, $L$, and the boundary extrapolation lengths on both\nsides of the sample, $z_b, z_b'$. For localized waves, we find the energy\ndensity profile within the sample is a segment of the distribution that would\nbe found in a longer sample with length $L+z_b+z_b'$. These results suggest new\nways of controlling wave interference in both diffusive and localized systems\nby varying boundary reflectivity.\n", "  In this contribution we make a short review of recent progress on topics of\ncurrent interest in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics. In particular, we\ndiscuss a re-analysis of the extraction of the dipole response of the pigmy\nresonance in $^{68}$Ni based on a continuum discretized coupled-channels\ncalculation in relativistic Coulomb excitation experiments. We also discuss the\nforthcoming progresses made by our group on the Alt-Sandhas-Grassberber\napproach to (d,p) reactions and future expectations. The role of separable\npotentials in solving such equations with a test case based on applications of\nsuch potentials to phase-shift analysis is also presented.\n", "  We present the first detailed three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic implicit\nlarge eddy simulations of turbulent convection of carbon burning in massive\nstars. Simulations begin with radial profiles mapped from a carbon burning\nshell within a 15$\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$ one-dimensional stellar evolution model.\nWe consider models with $128^3$, $256^3$, $512^3$ and $1024^3$ zones. The\nturbulent flow properties of these carbon burning simulations are very similar\nto the oxygen burning case. We performed a mean field analysis of the kinetic\nenergy budgets within the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes framework. For the\nupper convective boundary region, we find that the numerical dissipation is\ninsensitive to resolution for linear mesh resolutions above 512 grid points.\nFor the stiffer, more stratified lower boundary, our highest resolution model\nstill shows signs of decreasing sub-grid dissipation suggesting it is not yet\nnumerically converged. We find that the widths of the upper and lower\nboundaries are roughly 30% and 10% of the local pressure scale heights,\nrespectively. The shape of the boundaries is significantly different from those\nused in stellar evolution models. As in past oxygen-shell burning simulations,\nwe observe entrainment at both boundaries in our carbon-shell burning\nsimulations. In the large P\\'eclet number regime found in the advanced phases,\nthe entrainment rate is roughly inversely proportional to the bulk Richardson\nnumber, Ri$_{\\rm B}$ ($\\propto $Ri${\\rm_B}^{-\\alpha}$, $0.5\\lesssim \\alpha\n\\lesssim 1.0$). We thus suggest the use of Ri$_{\\rm B}$ as a means to take into\naccount the results of 3D hydrodynamics simulations in new 1D prescriptions of\nconvective boundary mixing.\n", "  Unitary, Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories in flat spacetime obey\nmicrocausality: commutators vanish at spacelike separation. For interacting\ntheories in more than two dimensions, we show that this implies that the\naveraged null energy, $\\int du T_{uu}$, must be positive. This non-local\noperator appears in the operator product expansion of local operators in the\nlightcone limit, and therefore contributes to $n$-point functions. We derive a\nsum rule that isolates this contribution and is manifestly positive. The\nargument also applies to certain higher spin operators other than the stress\ntensor, generating an infinite family of new constraints of the form $\\int du\nX_{uuu\\cdots u} \\geq 0$. These lead to new inequalities for the coupling\nconstants of spinning operators in conformal field theory, which include as\nspecial cases (but are generally stronger than) the existing constraints from\nthe lightcone bootstrap, deep inelastic scattering, conformal collider methods,\nand relative entropy. We also comment on the relation to the recent derivation\nof the averaged null energy condition from relative entropy, and suggest a more\ngeneral connection between causality and information-theoretic inequalities in\nQFT.\n", "  Eulerian simulations of the Vlasov-Poisson equations have been employed to\nanalyze the excitation of slow electrostatic fluctuations (with phase speed\nclose to the electron thermal speed), due to a beam-plasma interaction, and\ntheir propagation in linear and nonlinear regime. In 1968, O'Neil and Malmberg\n[Phys. Fluids {\\bf 11}, 1754 (1968)] dubbed these waves \"beam modes\". In the\npresent paper, it is shown that, in the presence of a cold and low density\nelectron beam, these beam modes can become unstable and then survive Landau\ndamping unlike the Langmuir waves. When an electron beam is launched in a\nplasma of Maxwellian electrons and motionless protons and this initial\nequilibrium is perturbed by a monochromatic density disturbance, the electric\nfield amplitude grows exponentially in time and then undergoes nonlinear\nsaturation, associated with the kinetic effects of particle trapping and phase\nspace vortex generation. Moreover, if the initial density perturbation is setup\nin the form of a low amplitude random phase noise, once the most unstable mode\nhas reached its nonlinear saturation amplitude after the linear growth, the\nwhole Fourier spectrum of wavenumbers is excited. As a result, the electric\nfield profile appears as a train of isolated pulses, each of them being\nassociated with a phase space vortex in the electron distribution function. At\nlater times, these vortical structures tend to merge and, correspondingly, the\nelectric pulses collapse, showing the tendency towards a time asymptotic\nconfiguration with a single phase space structure associated to an electric\nsoliton-like pulse. This dynamical evolution is driven by purely kinetic\nprocesses, possibly at work in many space and laboratory plasma environments.\n", "  Accurately quantifying sediment transport rates in rivers remains an\nimportant goal for geomorphologists, hydraulic engineers, and environmental\nscientists. However, current techniques for measuring transport rates are\nlaborious, and formulae to predict transport are notoriously inaccurate. Here,\nwe attempt to estimate sediment transport rates using luminescence, a property\nof common sedimentary minerals that is used by the geoscience community for\ngeochronology. This method is advantageous because of the ease of measurement\non ubiquitous quartz and feldspar sand. We develop a model based on\nconservation of energy and sediment mass to explain the patterns of\nluminescence in river channel sediment from a first-principles perspective. We\nshow that the model can accurately reproduce the luminescence observed in\npreviously published field measurements from two rivers with very different\nsediment transport styles. The parameters from the model can then be used to\nestimate the time-averaged virtual velocity, characteristic transport\nlengthscales, storage timescales, and floodplain exchange rates of fine\nsand-sized sediment in a fluvial system. The values obtained from the\nluminescence method appear to fall within expected ranges based on published\ncompilations. However, caution is warranted when applying the model as the\ncomplex nature of sediment transport can sometimes invalidate underlying\nsimplifications.\n", "  Electromagnetic field interactions in a dielectric medium represent a\nlongstanding field of investigation, both at the classical level and at the\nquantum one. We propose a 1+1 dimensional toy-model which consists of an\nhalf-line filling dielectric medium, with the aim to set up a simplified\nsituation where technicalities related to gauge invariance and, as a\nconsequence, physics of constrained systems are avoided, and still interesting\nfeatures appear. In particular, we simulate the electromagnetic field and the\npolarization field by means of two coupled scalar fields $\\phi$,$\\psi$\nrespectively, in a Hopfield-like model. We find that, in order to obtain a\nphysically meaningful behaviour for the model, one has to introduce spectral\nboundary conditions depending on the particle spectrum one is dealing with.\nThis is the first interesting achievement of our analysis. The second relevant\nachievement is that, by introducing a nonlinear contribution in the\npolarization field $\\psi$, with the aim of mimicking a third order nonlinearity\nin a nonlinear dielectric, we obtain solitonic solutions in the Hopfield model\nframework, whose classical behaviour is analyzed too.\n", "  Antihydrogen, the lightest atom consisting purely of antimatter, is an ideal\nlaboratory to study the CPT symmetry by comparison to hydrogen. With respect to\nabsolute precision, transitions within the ground-state hyperfine structure\n(GS-HFS) are most appealing by virtue of their small energy separation. ASACUSA\nproposed employing a beam of cold antihydrogen atoms in a Rabi-type experiment\nto determine the GS-HFS in a field-free region. Here we present a measurement\nof the zero-field hydrogen GS-HFS using the spectroscopy apparatus of ASACUSA's\nantihydrogen experiment. The measured value of\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{HF}$=$1~420~405~748.4(3.4)(1.6)~\\textrm{Hz}$ with a relative\nprecision of $\\Delta$$\\nu_\\mathrm{HF}$/$\\nu_\\mathrm{HF}$=$2.7\\times10^{-9}$\nconstitutes the most precise determination of this quantity in a beam and\nverifies the developed spectroscopy methods for the antihydrogen HFS experiment\nto the ppb level. Together with the recently presented observation of\nantihydrogen atoms $2.7~\\textrm{m}$ downstream of the production region, the\nprerequisites for a measurement with antihydrogen are now available within the\nASACUSA collaboration.\n", "  Iceberg drift and decay and the associated freshwater release are\nincreasingly seen as important processes in Earth's climate system, yet a\ndetailed understanding of their dynamics has remained elusive. Here, an\nidealized model of iceberg drift is presented. The model is designed to include\nthe most salient physical processes that determine iceberg motion while\nremaining sufficiently simple to facilitate physical insight into iceberg drift\ndynamics. We derive an analytical solution of the model, which helps build\nunderstanding and also enables the rapid computation of large numbers of\niceberg trajectories. The long-standing empirical rule of thumb that icebergs\ndrift at 2% of the wind velocity, relative to the ocean current, is derived\nhere from physical first principles, and it is shown that this relation only\nholds in the limit of strong winds or small icebergs, which approximately\napplies for typical icebergs in the Arctic. It is demonstrated that the\nopposite limit of weak winds or large icebergs approximately applies for\ntypical Antarctic tabular icebergs, and that in this case the icebergs simply\nmove with the ocean surface current. It is furthermore found that when winds\nare strong, wind drag drives icebergs in the direction the wind blows, whereas\nweak winds drive icebergs at a 90 degree angle to the wind direction.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the collective behavior of a wet granular\nmonolayer under vertical vibrations. The spherical particles are partially wet\nsuch that there are short-ranged attractive interactions between adjacent\nparticles. As the vibration strength increases, clustering, reorganizing and\nmelting regimes are identified subsequently through a characterization with the\nbond-orientational order parameters and the mean kinetic energy of the\nparticles. The melting transition is found to be a continuous process starting\nfrom the defects inside the crystal.\n", "  In this work, we theoretically study the quantum correlations present in an\noptomechanical system by invoking an additional cross-Kerr coupling between the\noptical and mechanical mode. Under experimentally achievable conditions, we\nfirst show that a significant enhancement of the steady-state entanglement\ncould be achieved at a considerably lower driving power, which is also\nextremely robust with respect to system parameters and environmental\ntemperature. Then, we employ Gaussian quantum discord as a witness of the\ngenuine quantumness of the correlation present in the system and discuss its\ndependence on the cross-Kerr nonlinearity.\n", "  Quantum coherence is a fundamental manifestation of the quantum superposition\nprinciple. Recently, Baumgratz \\emph{et al}. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{113},\n140401 (2014)] presented a rigorous framework to quantify coherence from the\nview of theory of physical resource. Here we propose a new valid quantum\ncoherence measure which is a convex roof measure, for a quantum system of\narbitrary dimension, essentially using the generalized Gell-Mann matrices.\nRigorous proof shows that the proposed coherence measure fulfills all the\nrequirements dictated by the resource theory of quantum coherence measures.\nMoreover, strong links between the resource frameworks of coherence concurrence\nand entanglement concurrence is derived, which shows that any degree of\ncoherence with respect to some reference basis can be converted to entanglement\nvia incoherent operations. Our work provides a clear quantitative and\noperational connection between coherence and entanglement based on two kinds of\nconcurrence. This new coherence measure, coherence concurrence, may be\nbeneficial to the study of quantum coherence.\n", "  The influence of confinement on the topological phases of superfluid 3He is\nstudied using the torsional pendulum method. We focus on the phase transition\nbetween the chiral A-phase and the time-reversal-invariant B-phase, motivated\nby the prediction of a spatiallymodulated (stripe) phase at the A-B phase\nboundary. We confine superfluid 3He to a single 1.08 {\\mu}m thick nanofluidic\ncavity incorporated into a high-precision torsion pendulum, and map the phase\ndiagram between 0.1 and 5.6 bar. We observe only small supercooling of the\nA-phase, in comparison to bulk or when confined in aerogel. This has a\nnon-monotonic pressure dependence, suggesting that a new intrinsic B-phase\nnucleation mechanism operates under confinement, mediated by the putative\nstripe phase. Both the phase diagram and the relative superfluid fraction of\nthe A and B phases, show that strong coupling is present at all pressures, with\nimplications for the stability of the stripe phase.\n", "  We consider the nonrelativistic model of coupling bare discrete states with\ncontinuum states in which the continuum states can have interactions among\nthemselves. By partial-wave decomposition and constraint to the conserved\nangular momentum eigenstates, the model can be reduced to Friedrichs-like model\nwith additional interactions between the continua. If a kind of factorizable\nform factor is chosen, the model can be exactly solvable, that is, the\ngeneralized discrete eigenstates including bound states, virtual states, and\nresonances, can all be represented using the original bare states, and so do\nthe in-state and out-state. The exact $S$ matrix is thus obtained. We then\ndiscuss the behaviors of the dynamically generated $S$-wave and $P$-wave\ndiscrete states as the coupling is varying when there is only one\nself-interacting bare continuum state. We find that even when the potential is\nrepulsive there could also be resonances and virtual states. In the $P$-wave\ncases with attractive interaction, we find that when there is a near-threshold\nbound state, there will always be an accompanying virtual state and we also\ngive a more general argument of this effect.\n", "  Quantum entanglement is a stunning consequence of the superposition\nprinciple. This universal property of quantum systems has been intensively\nexplored with photons, atoms, ions and electrons. Collective excitations such\nas surface plasmons exhibit quantum behaviors. For the first time, we report an\nexperimental evidence of non-local control of single plasmon interferences\nthrough entanglement of a single plasmon with a single photon. We achieved\nphoton-plasmon entanglement by converting one photon of an entangled photon\npair into a surface plasmon. The plasmon is tested onto a plasmonic platform in\na Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A projective measurement on the polarization of\nthe photon allows the non-local control of the interference state of the\nplasmon. Entanglement between particles of various natures paves the way to the\ndesign of hybrid systems in quantum information networks.\n", "  We investigate the nonlinear mechanics of a bimetallic, optically absorbing\nSiN-Nb nanowire in the presence of incident laser light and a reflecting Si\nmirror. Situated in a standing wave of optical intensity and subject to\nphotothermal forces, the nanowire undergoes self-induced oscillations at low\nincident light thresholds of $<1\\, \\rm{\\mu W}$ due to engineered strong\ntemperature-position ($T$-$z$) coupling. Along with inducing self-oscillation,\nlaser light causes large changes to the mechanical resonant frequency\n$\\omega_0$ and equilibrium position $z_0$ that cannot be neglected. We present\nexperimental results and a theoretical model for the motion under laser\nillumination. In the model, we solve the governing nonlinear differential\nequations by perturbative means to show that self-oscillation amplitude is set\nby the competing effects of direct $T$-$z$ coupling and $2\\omega_0$ parametric\nexcitation due to $T$-$\\omega_0$ coupling. We then study the linearized\nequations of motion to show that the optimal thermal time constant $\\tau$ for\nphotothermal feedback is $\\tau \\to \\infty$ rather than the widely reported\n$\\omega_0 \\tau = 1$. Lastly, we demonstrate photothermal quality factor ($Q$)\nenhancement of driven motion as a means to counteract air damping.\nUnderstanding photothermal effects on micromechanical devices, as well as\nnonlinear aspects of optics-based motion detection, can enable new device\napplications as oscillators or other electronic elements with smaller device\nfootprints and less stringent ambient vacuum requirements.\n", "  A two-dimensional topological insulator (2DTI) is guaranteed to have a\nhelical 1D edge mode in which spin is locked to momentum, producing the quantum\nspin Hall effect and prohibiting elastic backscattering at zero magnetic field.\nNo monolayer material has yet been shown to be a 2DTI, but recently the Weyl\nsemimetal WTe2 was predicted to become a 2DTI in monolayer form if a bulk gap\nopens. Here, we report that at temperatures below about 100 K monolayer WTe2\ndoes become insulating in its interior, while the edges still conduct. The edge\nconduction is strongly suppressed by in-plane magnetic field and is independent\nof gate voltage, save for mesoscopic fluctuations that grow on cooling due to a\nzero-bias anomaly which reduces the linear-response conductance. Bilayer WTe2\nalso becomes insulating at low temperatures but does not show edge conduction.\nMany of these observations are consistent with monolayer WTe2 being a 2DTI.\nHowever, the low temperature edge conductance, for contacts spacings down to\n150 nm, is below the quantized value,\n", "  Experimental data on proton-proton interactions in high energy collisions\nshow quite a special and unexpected behaviour of the proportion of elastic\nscattering compared to inelastic processes with increasing energy. It decreases\nat the beginning (at comparatively low energies) but then starts increasing.\nFrom Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) energies of 23.5 - 62.5 GeV up to higher\nenergies 7 - 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) it increases by a factor\nmore than 1.5! According to intuitive classical ideas we would expect a stable\ntendency with increasing proportion of the break-down of protons compared to\ntheir survival probability. One can assume that either the asymptotic freedom\nor the extremely short time of flight of high energy protons through each other\nare in charge of such a surprising effect. The unquestionable principle of\nunitarity combined with the available experimental data on elastic scattering\nis used to get new conclusions about the shape of the interaction region of\ncolliding protons. Its evolution at present energies is considered. Some\npredictions about its behaviour at even higher energies are described with\ndifferent assumptions on relative roles of elastic scattering and inelastic\nprocesses. The shape can transform rather drastically if the proportion of\nelastic processes keeps rising. This unexpected property leads to an unexpected\ncorollary. The possible origin of the effect and its interrelation to the\nstrong interaction dynamics are speculated.\n", "  We use cosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic\nEnvironments) project to study the baryon cycle and galaxy mass assembly for\ncentral galaxies in the halo mass range $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{10} - 10^{13}\nM_{\\odot}$. By tracing cosmic inflows, galactic outflows, gas recycling, and\nmerger histories, we quantify the contribution of physically distinct sources\nof material to galaxy growth. We show that in situ star formation fueled by\nfresh accretion dominates the early growth of galaxies of all masses, while the\nre-accretion of gas previously ejected in galactic winds often dominates the\ngas supply for a large portion of every galaxy's evolution. Externally\nprocessed material contributes increasingly to the growth of central galaxies\nat lower redshifts. This includes stars formed ex situ and gas delivered by\nmergers, as well as smooth intergalactic transfer of gas from other galaxies,\nan important but previously under-appreciated growth mode. By $z=0$, wind\ntransfer, i.e. the exchange of gas between galaxies via winds, can dominate gas\naccretion onto $\\sim L^{*}$ galaxies over fresh accretion and standard wind\nrecycling. Galaxies of all masses re-accrete >50% of the gas ejected in winds\nand recurrent recycling is common. The total mass deposited in the\nintergalactic medium per unit stellar mass formed increases in lower mass\ngalaxies. Re-accretion of wind ejecta occurs over a broad range of timescales,\nwith median recycling times ($\\sim 100-350$ Myr) shorter than previously found.\nWind recycling typically occurs at the scale radius of the halo, independent of\nhalo mass and redshift, suggesting a characteristic recycling zone around\ngalaxies that scales with the size of the inner halo and the galaxy's stellar\ncomponent.\n", "  We present the first molecular dynamics study to probe the mechanisms of\nanomalous diffusion in cationic surfactant micelles in the presence of explicit\nsalt and solvent-mediated interactions. Simulations show that when the counter\nion density increases, saddle-shaped interfaces manifest leading to the\nformation of branched structures. In experiments, branched structures exhibit\nlower viscosity as compared to linear and wormlike micelles, presumably due to\nstress relaxation arising from the sliding motion of branches along the main\nchain. Our simulations provide conclusive evidence and a mechanism of branch\nmotion and stress relaxation in micellar fluids. Further, depending upon the\nsurfactant and salt concentrations, which in turn determine the microstructure,\nwe observe normal, subdiffusive and superdiffusive motion of surfactants.\nSpecifically, superdiffusive behavior is associated with branch sliding,\nbreakage and recombination of micelle fragments as well as constraint release\nin entangled systems.\n", "  Using a sum rule, we derive new bounds on Herglotz functions that generalize\nthose given in (Gustafson and Sj\\\"oberg 2010) and (Bernland, Luger and\nGustafson 2011). These bounds apply to a wide class of linear passive systems\nsuch as electromagnetic passive materials. Among these bounds, we describe the\noptimal ones and also discuss their meaning in various physical situations like\nin the case of a transparency window, where we exhibit sharp bounds. Then, we\napply these bounds in the context of broadband passive cloaking in the\nquasi-static regime to negatively answer the following challenging question: is\nit possible to construct a passive cloaking device that cloaks an object over a\nwhole frequency band? Our rigorous approach, although limited to quasi-statics,\ngives quantitative limitations on the cloaking effect over a finite frequency\nrange by providing inequalities on the polarizabilty tensor associated with the\ncloaking device. We emphasize that our results hold for a cloak or object of\nany geometrical shape.\n", "  We study two models of scalar dark matter from \"large\" electroweak multiplets\nwith isospin 5/2 (n=6 members) and 7/2 (n=8), whose scalar potentials preserve\na $Z_2$ symmetry. Because of large annihilation cross sections due to\nelectroweak interactions, these scalars can constitute all the dark matter only\nfor masses in the multi-TeV range. For such high masses, Sommerfeld enhancement\nand co-annihilations play important roles in the dark matter relic abundance\ncalculation, reducing the upper bound on the large multiplet's mass by almost a\nfactor of two. We determine the allowed parameter ranges including both of\nthese effects and show that these models are as yet unconstrained by dark\nmatter direct detection experiments, but will be probed by currently-running\nand proposed future experiments. We also show that a Landau pole appears in\nthese models at energy scales below $10^9$ GeV, indicating the presence of\nadditional new physics below that scale.\n", "  We consider 4d N=1 SCFTs, topologically twisted on compact constant curvature\nRiemann surfaces, giving rise to 2d N=(0,2) SCFTs. The exact R-current of these\n2d SCFT extremizes the central charge c_{2d}, similarly to the 4d picture,\nwhere the exact R-current maximizes the central charge a_{4d}. There are global\ncurrents that do not mix with the R-current in 4d but their mixing becomes non\ntrivial in 2d. In this paper we study the holographic dual of this process by\nanalyzing a 5d N=2 truncation of T^{1,1} with one Betti vector multiplet, dual\nto the baryonic current on the CFT side. The holographic realization of the\nflow across dimensions connects AdS_5 to AdS_3 vacua in the supergravity\npicture. We verify the existence of the flow to AdS_3 solutions and we retrieve\nthe field theory results for the mixing of the Betti vector with the\ngraviphoton. Moreover, we extract the central charge from the Brown-Henneaux\nformula, matching with the results obtained in field theory. We develop a\ngeneral formalism to obtain the central charge of a 2d SCFT from 5d N=2 gauged\nsupergravity with a generic number of vector multiplets, showing that its\nextremization corresponds to an attractor mechanism for the scalars in the\nsupergravity picture.\n", "  Recent developments in attosecond spectroscopy yield access to the correlated\nmotion of electrons on their intrinsic time scales. Spin-flip dynamics is\nusually considered in the context of valence electronic states, where\nspin-orbit coupling is weak and processes related to the electron spin are\nusually driven by nuclear motion. However, for core-excited states, where the\ncore hole has a nonzero angular momentum, spin-orbit coupling is strong enough\nto drive spin-flips on a much shorter time scale. Using density matrix based\ntime-dependent restricted active space configuration interaction including\nspin-orbit coupling, we address an unprecedentedly short spin-crossover for the\nexample of L-edge (2p$\\rightarrow$3d) excited states of a prototypical Fe(II)\ncomplex. This process occurs on a time scale, which is faster than that of\nAuger decay ($\\sim$4\\,fs) treated here explicitly. Modest variations of carrier\nfrequency and pulse duration can lead to substantial changes in the spin-state\nyield, suggesting its control by soft X-ray light.\n", "  The effects of nonlocal and reflecting connectivity are investigated in\ncoupled Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) elements, which assimilate the exchange\nof electrical signals between neurons. Earlier investigations have demonstrated\nthat non-local and hierarchical network connectivity often induces complex\nsynchronization patterns and chimera states in systems of coupled oscillators.\nIn the LIF system we show that if the elements are non-locally linked with\npositive diffusive coupling in a ring architecture the system splits into a\nnumber of alternating domains. Half of these domains contain elements, whose\npotential stays near the threshold, while they are interrupted by active\ndomains, where the elements perform regular LIF oscillations. The active\ndomains move around the ring with constant velocity, depending on the system\nparameters. The idea of introducing reflecting non-local coupling in LIF\nnetworks originates from signal exchange between neurons residing in the two\nhemispheres in the brain. We show evidence that this connectivity induces novel\ncomplex spatial and temporal structures: for relatively extensive ranges of\nparameter values the system splits in two coexisting domains, one domain where\nall elements stay near-threshold and one where incoherent states develop with\nmultileveled mean phase velocity distribution.\n", "  Maintained by environmental fluxes, biological systems are thermodynamic\nprocesses that operate far from equilibrium without detailed-balance dynamics.\nYet, they often exhibit well defined nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs). More\nimportantly, critical thermodynamic functionality arises directly from\ntransitions among their NESSs, driven by environmental switching. Here, we\nidentify constraints on excess thermodynamic quantities that ride above the\nNESS housekeeping background. We do this by extending the Crooks fluctuation\ntheorem to transitions among NESSs, without invoking an unphysical dual\ndynamics. This and corresponding integral fluctuation theorems determine how\nmuch work must be expended when controlling systems maintained far from\nequilibrium. This generalizes feedback control theory, showing that Maxwellian\nDemons can leverage mesoscopic-state information to take advantage of the\nexcess energetics in NESS transitions. Altogether, these point to universal\nthermodynamic laws that are immediately applicable to the accessible degrees of\nfreedom within the effective dynamic at any emergent level of hierarchical\norganization. By way of illustration, this readily allows analyzing a\nvoltage-gated sodium ion channel whose molecular conformational dynamics play a\ncritical functional role in propagating action potentials in mammalian neuronal\nmembranes.\n", "  A measurement of the time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry in the Cabibbo-suppressed\ndecay $D^0\\rightarrow K^-K^+$ is performed using pp collision data,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3fb$^{-1}$, collected with the\nLHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The flavour of the\ncharm meson at production is determined from the charge of the pion in\n$D^{*+}\\rightarrow D^0 \\pi^+$ and $D^{*-}\\rightarrow \\bar{D^0} \\pi^-$ decays.\nThe time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry $A_{CP}(K^-K^+)$ is obtained assuming\nnegligible $CP$ violation in charm mixing and in Cabibbo-favoured\n$D^0\\rightarrow K^-\\pi^+$, $D^+\\rightarrow K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ and $D^+\\rightarrow\n\\bar{K^0}\\pi^+$ decays used as calibration channels. It is found to be\n$A_{CP}(K^-K^+)=(0.14\\pm0.15(stat)\\pm0.10(syst))\\%$. A combination of this\nresult with previous LHCb measurements yields\n$A_{CP}(K^-K^+)=(0.04\\pm0.12(stat)\\pm0.10(syst))\\%$,\n$A_{CP}(\\pi^-\\pi^+)=(0.07\\pm0.14(stat)\\pm0.11(syst))\\%$. These are the most\nprecise measurements from a single experiment. The result for $A_{CP}(K^-K^+)$\nis the most precise determination of a time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry in the\ncharm sector to date, and neither measurement shows evidence of CP asymmetry.\n", "  Non Born-Oppenheimer quantum dynamics of H$_{2}^{+}$ excited by shaped\none-cycle laser pulses linearly polarized along the molecular axis have been\nstudied by the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwithin a %three-body three-dimensional model, including the internuclear\nseparation, $R$, and the electron coordinates $z$ and $\\rho$. Laser carrier\nfrequencies corresponding to the wavelengths $\\lambda_{l}=25$~nm through\n$\\lambda_{l}=400$~nm were used and the amplitudes of the pulses were chosen\nsuch that the energy of H$_{2}^{+}$ was close to its dissociation threshold at\nthe end of any laser pulse applied. It is shown that there exists a\ncharacteristic oscillation frequency $\\omega_{\\rm osc} \\simeq 0.2265$~au\n(corresponding to the period of $\\tau_{\\rm osc} \\simeq 0.671$~fs and the\nwavelength of $\\lambda_{\\rm osc} \\simeq 200$~nm) that manifests itself as a\n\"carrier\" frequency of temporally shaped oscillations of the time-dependent\nexpectation values $\\langle z \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\partial V/\\partial z\n\\rangle$ that emerge at the ends of the laser pulses and exist on a timescale\nof at least 50~fs. Time-dependent expectation values $\\langle \\rho \\rangle$ and\n$\\langle \\partial V/\\partial \\rho \\rangle$ of the optically-passive degree of\nfreedom, $\\rho$, demonstrate post-laser-field oscillations at two basic\nfrequencies $\\omega^{\\rho}_{1} \\approx \\omega_{\\rm osc}$ and $\\omega^{\\rho}_{2}\n\\approx 2\\omega_{\\rm osc}$. Power spectra associated with the electronic motion\nshow higher- and lower-order harmonics with respect to the driving field.\n", "  We present a general and useful method to predict the existence, frequency,\nand spatial properties of gap states in photonic (and other) structures with a\ngapped spectrum. This method is established using the scattering approach. It\noffers a viewpoint based on a geometrical Fabry-Perot model. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of this model by predicting the behaviour of topological edge\nstates in quasi-periodic structures. A proposition to use this model in Casimir\nphysics is presented.\n", "  Capillary rise plays a crucial role in the construction of road embankments\nin flood zones, where hydrophobic compounds are added to the soil to suppress\nthe rising of water and avoid possible damage of the pavement. Water rises\nthrough liquid bridges, menisci and trimers, whose width and connectivity\ndepends on the maximal half-length {\\lambda} of the capillary bridges among\ngrains. Low {\\lambda} generate a disconnect structure, with small clusters\neverywhere. On the contrary, for high {\\lambda}, create a percolating cluster\nof trimers and enclosed volumes that form a natural path for capillary rise.\nHereby, we study the percolation transition of this geometric structure as a\nfunction of {\\lambda} on a granular media of monodisperse spheres in a random\nclose packing. We determine both the percolating threshold {\\lambda}_{c} =\n(0.049 \\pm 0.004)R (with R the radius of the granular spheres), and the\ncritical exponent of the correlation length {\\nu} = (0.830 \\pm 0.051),\nsuggesting that the percolation transition falls into the universality class of\nordinary percolation.\n", "  A charged compact star models have been determined for anisotropic fluid\ndistribution. We have solved the Einstein's- Maxwell field equations to\nconstruct the charged compact star models by using radial pressure, metric\nfunction $e^{\\lambda}$ and electric charge function. The generic charged\nanisotropic solution is verified by exploring different physical conditions\nlike, causality condition, mass-radius relation and stability of the solution\n(via. adiabatic index, TOV equations and Herrera cracking concept). It is\nobserved that the present charged anisotropic compact star is compatible with\nthe star PSR 1937+21. However we also presented the EOS $\\rho=f(p)$ for present\ncharged compact star model.\n", "  We clarify the differences between the usual Kaloper-Sorbo description of\naxion monodromy and the effective axionic potential in terms of Minkowski\n4-forms derived in string compactifications. The fact that the metric of the\n3-form fields coming from string theory is field dependent (unlike in\nKaloper-Sorbo) leads to the backreaction issues recently studied in axion\nmonodromy models within string theory. We reanalyse these problems in terms of\nthe 4-forms focusing on the case in which the non-periodic scalars backreact on\nthe Kahler metric of the inflaton reducing the physical field range. In the\nclosed string sector of Type II Calabi-Yau compactifications with fluxes the\nmetric becomes field dependent precisely when $\\Delta\\phi\\sim M_p$,\nindependently of the choice of fluxes. We propose, however, some\ncounter-examples to this universal behaviour by including open string fields.\n", "  Quantum discord has been studied extensively as a measure of non-classical\ncorrelations which includes entanglement as a subset. Although it is well known\nthat non-zero discord can exist without entanglement, the origin of quantum\ndiscord is not well understood as compared to entanglement, which manifests\nitself more simply as inseparable higher dimensional quantum superposition. In\nthis paper we establish the discordlike correlation of bipartite coherence and\nthen compare it to quantum discord. Consequently, we show that the minimum of\nthe discordlike correlation of coherence coincides with the original quantum\ndiscord. This demonstrates quantum discord as the irreducible correlated\nbipartite coherence. In addition, the discordlike correlated coherence is shown\nto admit the postulates of the quantum resource theory (QRT), although the\noriginal quantum discord is not a \"good\" candidate under the QRT. We also find\nthat the relative entropy measure induced from the discordlike coherence is a\nwell-defined coherence measure for bipartite states.\n", "  In this paper, we apply the polaron master equation, which offers the\npossibilities to interpolate between weak and strong system-bath coupling, to\nstudy how system-bath couplings affect charge transfer processes in Photosystem\nII reaction center (PSII RC) inspired quantum heat engine (QHE) model in a wide\nparameter range. The effects of bath correlation and temperature, together with\nthe combined effects of these factors are also discussed in details. The\nresults show a variety of dynamical behaviours. We interpret these results in\nterms of noise-assisted transport effect and dynamical localization which\ncorrespond to two mechanisms underpinning the transfer process in\nphotosynthetic complexes: One is resonance energy transfer and the other is\ndynamical localization effect captured by the polaron master equation. The\neffects of system-bath coupling and bath correlation are incorporated in the\neffective system-bath coupling strength determining whether noise-assisted\ntransport effect or dynamical localization dominates the dynamics and\ntemperature modulates the balance of the two mechanisms. Furthermore, these two\nmechanisms can be attributed to one physical origin: bath-induced fluctuations.\nThe two mechanisms is manifestations of dual role played by bath-induced\nfluctuations within respective parameter range. In addition, we find that the\neffec- tive voltage of QHE exhibits superior robustness with respect to the\nbath noise as long as the system-coupling strength is not too large.\n", "  We present 190 galaxy cluster candidates (most at high redshift) based on\ngalaxy overdensity measurements in the \\spitzer/IRAC imaging of the fields\nsurrounding 646 bent, double-lobed radio sources drawn from the Clusters\nOccupied by Bent Radio AGN (COBRA) Survey. The COBRA sources were chosen as\nobjects in the VLA FIRST survey that lack optical counterparts in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) to a limit of $m_r=22$, making them likely to lie at\nhigh redshift. This is confirmed by our observations: the redshift distribution\nof COBRA sources with estimated redshifts peaks near $z=1$, and extends out to\n$z\\approx3$. Cluster candidates were identified by comparing our target fields\nto a background field and searching for statistically significant\n($\\ge2\\sigma$) excesses in the galaxy number counts surrounding the radio\nsources; 190 fields satisfy the $\\ge2\\sigma$ limit. We find that 530 fields\n(82.0\\%) have a net positive excess of galaxies surrounding the radio source.\nMany of the fields with positive excesses but below the $2\\sigma$ cutoff are\nlikely to be galaxy groups. Forty-one COBRA sources are quasars with known\nspectroscopic redshifts, which may be tracers of some of the most distant\nclusters known.\n", "  Interacting spinning fermions with strong quasi-random disorder are analyzed\nvia rigorous Renormalization Group (RG) methods combined with KAM techniques.\nThe correlations are written in terms of an expansion whose convergence follows\nfrom number-theoretical properties of the frequency and cancellations due to\nPauli principle. A striking difference appears between spinless and spinning\nfermions; in the first case there are no relevant effective interactions while\nin presence of spin an additional relevant quartic term is present in the RG\nflow. The large distance exponential decay of the correlations present in the\nnon interacting case, consequence of the single particle localization, is shown\nto persist in the spinning case only for temperatures greater than a power of\nthe many body interaction, while in the spinless case this happens up to zero\ntemperature.\n", "  In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of mesoscopic fluctuations for\nthe thinned Circular Unitary Ensemble. The effect of thinning is that the\neigenvalues start to decorrelate. The decorrelation is stronger on the larger\nscales than on the smaller scales. We investigate this behavior by studying\nmesoscopic linear statistics. There are two regimes depending on the scale\nparameter and the thinning parameter. In one regime we obtain a CLT of a\nclassical type and in the other regime we retrieve the CLT for CUE. The two\nregimes are separated by a critical line. On the critical line the limiting\nfluctuations are no longer Gaussian, but described by infinitely divisible\nlaws. We argue that this transition phenomenon is universal by showing that the\nsame transition and their laws appear for fluctuations of the thinned sine\nprocess in a growing box. The proofs are based on a Riemann-Hilbert problem for\nintegrable operators.\n", "  A number of candidate multiquark hadrons, i.e., particle resonances with\nsubstructures that are more complex than the quark-antiquark mesons and\nthree-quark baryons that are prescribed in the textbooks, have recently been\nobserved. In this talk I present: some recent preliminary BESIII results on the\nnear-threshold behavior of sigma(e+e- --> Lambda Lambda-bar) that may or may\nnot be related to multiquark mesons in the light- and strange-quark sectors;\nresults from Belle and LHCb on the electrically charged, charmoniumlike\nZ(4430)^+ --> pi^+ psi ' resonance that necessarily has a four-quark\nsubstructure; and the recent LHCb discovery of the P_c(4380) and P_c(4450)\nhidden-charm resonances seen as a complex structure in the J/psi p invariant\nmass distribution for Lambda_b --> K^-J/psi p decays and necessarily have a\nfive-quark substructure and are, therefore, prominent candidates for pentaquark\nbaryons.\n", "  The authors of arXiv:1610.01533 have recently proposed a stronger version of\nthe weak gravity conjecture (WGC), based on which they concluded that all those\nnon-supersymmetric AdS vacua that can be embedded within a constistent theory\nof quantum gravity necessarily develop instabilities. In this paper we further\nelaborate on this proposal by arguing that the aforementioned instabilities\nhave a perturbative nature and arise from the crucial interplay between the\nclosed and the open string sectors of the theory.\n", "  Neutron star$-$black hole (NS$-$BH) coalescences are widely believed to be\npromising gravitational wave sources in the era of advanced detectors of\nLIGO/Virgo but such binaries have never been directly detected yet. Evidence\nfor NS$-$BH coalescences have been suggested in short and hybrid GRB\nobservations, which are examined critically. Based on the suggested connection\nbetween the observed macronovae/kilonovae events and NS$-$BH coalescences, we\nget a fiducial lower limit of NS$-$BH coalescence rate density ${\\cal R}_{\\rm\nnsbh} \\approx 18.8^{+12.5}_{-8.6} ~{\\rm Gpc^{-3}~ yr^{-1}~ (\\theta_j/0.1~{\\rm\nrad})^{-2}}$, where $\\theta_{\\rm j}$ is the typical half-opening angle of the\nGRB ejecta. The real value of ${\\cal R}_{\\rm nsbh}$ is likely at least $\\sim\n{\\rm a~few}$ times larger, depending upon the equation of state of NS material\nand the properties of the NS$-$BH system, such as the mass and spin\ndistribution of the black hole. If the link between macronovae/kilonovae and\nNS$-$BH coalescence is valid, one can expect that at design sensitivity the\naLIGO/AdVirgo network will detect NS$-$BH coalescence signals at a rate of at\nleast a dozen per year, and to consequently place constraints on certain\nphysical properties of NS$-$BH systems.\n", "  Precise knowledge of an optical device's frequency response is crucial for it\nto be useful in most applications. Traditional methods for determining the\nfrequency response of an optical system (e.g. optical cavity or waveguide\nmodulator) usually rely on calibrated broadband photo-detectors or complicated\nRF mixdown operations. As the bandwidths of these devices continue to increase,\nthere is a growing need for a characterization method that does not have\nbandwidth limitations, or require a previously calibrated device. We\ndemonstrate a new calibration technique on an optical system (consisting of an\noptical cavity and a high-speed waveguide modulator) that is free from\nlimitations imposed by detector bandwidth, and does not require a calibrated\nphoto-detector or modulator. We use a low-frequency (DC) photo-detector to\nmonitor the cavity's optical response as a function of modulation frequency,\nwhich is also used to determine the modulator's frequency response. Knowledge\nof the frequency-dependent modulation depth allows us to more precisely\ndetermine the cavity's characteristics (free spectral range and linewidth). The\nprecision and repeatability of our technique is demonstrated by measuring the\ndifferent resonant frequencies of orthogonal polarization cavity modes caused\nby the presence of a non-linear crystal. Once the modulator has been\ncharacterized using this simple method, the frequency response of any passive\noptical element can be determined.\n", "  We analyze the photoelectron angular distribution in two-pathway interference\nbetween non\\-resonant one-photon and resonant two-photon ionization of neon. We\nconsider a bichromatic femtosecond XUV pulse whose fundamental frequency is\ntuned near the $2p^5 3s$ atomic states of neon. The time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is solved and the results are employed to compute the\nangular distribution and the associated anisotropy parameters at the main\nphotoelectron line. We also employ a time-dependent perturbative approach,\nwhich allows obtaining information on the process for a large range of pulse\nparameters, including the steady-state case of continuous radiation, i.e., an\ninfinitely long pulse. The results from the two methods are in relatively good\nagreement over the domain of applicability of perturbation theory.\n", "  Using a modification of the Shapiro approach, we introduce the two-parameter\nfamily of conductance distributions W(g), defined by simple differential\nequations, which are in the one-to-one correspondence with conductance\ndistributions for quasi-one-dimensional systems of size L^{d-1}\\times L_z,\ncharacterizing by parameters L/\\xi and L_z/L (\\xi is the correlation length, d\nis the dimension of space). This family contains the Gaussian and log-normal\ndistributions, typical for the metallic and localized phases. For a certain\nchoice of parameters, we reproduce the results for the cumulants of conductance\nin the space dimension d=2+\\epsilon obtained in the framework of the\n\\sigma-model approach. The universal property of distributions is existence of\ntwo asymptotic regimes, log-normal for small g and exponential for large g. In\nthe metallic phase they refer to remote tails, in the critical region they\ndetermine practically all distribution, in the localized phase the former\nasymptotics forces out the latter. A singularity at g=1, discovered in\nnumerical experiments, is admissible in the framework of their calculational\nscheme, but related with a deficient definition of conductance. Apart of this\nsingularity, the critical distribution for d=3 is well described by the present\ntheory. One-parameter scaling for the whole distribution takes place under\ncondition, that two independent parameters characterizing this distribution are\nfunctions of the ratio L/\\xi.\n", "  There is a significant ongoing effort in realizing quantum annealing with\ndifferent physical platforms. The challenge is to achieve a fully programmable\nquantum device featuring coherent adiabatic quantum dynamics. Here we show that\ncombining the well-developed quantum simulation toolbox for Rydberg atoms with\nthe recently proposed Lechner-Hauke-Zoller~(LHZ) architecture allows one to\nbuild a prototype for a coherent adiabatic quantum computer with all-to-all\nIsing interactions and, therefore, a novel platform for quantum annealing. In\nLHZ a infinite-range spin-glass is mapped onto the low energy subspace of a\nspin-1/2 lattice gauge model with quasi-local 4-body parity constraints. This\nspin model can be emulated in a natural way with Rubidium and Cesium atoms in a\nbipartite optical lattice involving laser-dressed Rydberg-Rydberg interactions,\nwhich are several orders of magnitude larger than the relevant decoherence\nrates. This makes the exploration of coherent quantum enhanced optimization\nprotocols accessible with state-of-the-art atomic physics experiments.\n", "  We reveal a novel topological property of the exceptional points in a\ntwo-level parity-time symmetric system and then propose a scheme to detect the\ntopological exceptional points in the system, which is embedded in a larger\nHilbert space constructed by a four-level cold atomic system. We show that a\ntunable parameter in the presented system for simulating the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian can be tuned to swept the eigenstates through the exceptional\npoints in parameter space. The non-trivial Berry phases of the eigenstates\nobtained in this loop from the exceptional points can be measured by the atomic\ninterferometry. Since the proposed operations and detection are experimentally\nfeasible, our scheme may pave a promising way to explore the novel properties\nof non-Hermitian systems.\n", "  We analyse the multiscale properties of energy-conserving upwind-stabilised\nfinite element discretisations of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler\nequations. We focus our attention on two particular methods: the Lie derivative\ndiscretisation introduced in Natale and Cotter (2016a) and the Streamline\nUpwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) discretisation of the vorticity advection\nequation. Such discretisations provide control on enstrophy by modelling\ndifferent types of scale interactions. We quantify the performance of the\nschemes in reproducing the non-local energy backscatter that characterises\ntwo-dimensional turbulent flows.\n", "  In this article, we considered the bulk viscous fluid in the formalism of\nmodified gravity in which the general form of a gravitational action is $f(R,\nT)$ function, where $R$ is the curvature scalar and $T$ is the trace of the\nenergy momentum tensor within the frame of flat FRW space time. The\ncosmological model dominated by bulk viscous matter with total bulk viscous\ncoefficient expressed as a linear combination of the velocity and acceleration\nof the expansion of the universe in such a way that\n$\\xi=\\xi_0+\\xi_1\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}+\\xi_2\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{\\dot{a}}$, where\n$\\xi_0$, $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ are constants. We take $p=(\\gamma-1)\\rho$, where\n$0\\le\\gamma\\le2$ as an equation of state for perfect fluid. The exact solutions\nto the corresponding field equations are obtained by assuming a particular\nmodel of the form of $f(R, T)=R+2f(T)$, where $f(T)=\\lambda T$, $\\lambda$ is\nconstant. We studied the four possible scenarios for different values of\n$\\gamma$, such as $\\gamma=0$, $\\gamma=\\frac{2}{3}$, $\\gamma=1$ and\n$\\gamma=\\frac{4}{3}$ with the possible positive and negative ranges of\n$\\lambda$ to observe the accelerated expansion history of the universe.\nFinally, a big-rip singularity is observed.\n", "  Hyperfine structures of the triplet $n^3S-$states in the four-electron\nBe-atom(s) and Be-like ions are considered. It is shown that to determine the\nhyperfine structure splitting in such atomic systems one needs to know the\ntriplet electron density at the central atomic nucleus $\\rho_T(0)$. We have\ndeveloped the procedure which allows allows one to determine such an electron\ndensity $\\rho_T(0)$ for arbitrary four-electron atoms and ions.\n", "  Rheological properties of dense flows of hard particles are singular as one\napproaches the jamming threshold where flow ceases, both for granular flows\ndominated by inertia, and for over-damped suspensions. Concomitantly, the\nlengthscale characterizing velocity correlations appears to diverge at jamming.\nHere we review a theoretical framework that gives a scaling description of\nstationary flows of frictionless particles. Our analysis applies both to\nsuspensions and inertial flows of hard particles. We report numerical results\nin support of the theory, and show the phase diagram that results when friction\nis added, delineating the regime of validity of the frictionless theory.\n", "  We construct perturbative classical solutions of the Yang-Mills equations\ncoupled to dynamical point particles carrying color charge. By applying a set\nof color to kinematics replacement rules first introduced by Bern, Carrasco and\nJohansson (BCJ), these are shown to generate solutions of d-dimensional dilaton\ngravity, which we also explicitly construct. Agreement between the gravity\nresult and the gauge theory double copy implies a correspondence between\nnon-Abelian particles and gravitating sources with dilaton charge. When the\ncolor sources are highly relativistic, dilaton exchange decouples, and the\nsolutions we obtain match those of pure gravity. We comment on possible\nimplications of our findings to the calculation of gravitational waveforms in\nastrophysical black hole collisions, directly from computationally simpler\ngluon radiation in Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  Stimulated Brillouin interactions mediate nonlinear coupling between photons\nand acoustic phonons through an optomechanical three-wave interaction. Though\nthese nonlinearities were previously very weak in silicon photonic systems, the\nrecent emergence of new optomechanical waveguide structures have transformed\nBrillouin processes into one of the strongest and most tailorable on-chip\nnonlinear interactions. New technologies based on Brillouin couplings have\nformed a basis for amplification, filtering, and nonreciprocal signal\nprocessing techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate strong guided-wave\nBrillouin scattering between light fields guided in distinct spatial modes of a\nsilicon waveguide for the first time. This inter-modal coupling creates\ndispersive symmetry breaking between Stokes and anti-Stokes processes,\npermitting single-sideband amplification and wave dynamics that permit\nnear-unity power conversion. Combining these physics with integrated\nmode-multiplexers enables novel device topologies and eliminates the need for\noptical circulators or narrowband spectral filtering to separate pump and\nsignal waves as in traditional Brillouin processes. We demonstrate 3.5 dB of\noptical gain, over 2.3 dB of net amplification, and 50% single-sideband energy\ntransfer between two optical modes in a pure silicon waveguide, expanding the\ndesign space for flexible on-chip light sources, amplifiers, nonreciprocal\ndevices, and signal processing technologies.\n", "  An inkjet printer head, which is capable of depositing liquid droplets with a\nresolution of $22$ picoliters and high repeatability, is employed to\ninvestigate the wetting dynamics of drops printed on a horizontal plane as well\nas on a granular monolayer. For a sessile drop on a horizontal plane, we\ncharacterize the contact angle hysteresis, drop volume and contact line\ndynamics from side view images. We show that the evaporation rate scales with\nthe dimension of the contact line instead of the surface area of the drop. We\ndemonstrate that the system evolves into a closed cycle upon repeating the\ndepositing-evaporating process, owing to the high repeatability of the printing\nfacility. Finally, we extend the investigation to a granular monolayer in order\nto explore the interplay between liquid deposition and granular particles.\n", "  In the context of the relaxation time approximation to Boltzmann transport\ntheory, we examine the behavior of the Hall number, $n_H$, of a metal in the\nneighborhood of a Lifshitz transition from a closed Fermi surface to open\nsheets. We find a universal non-analytic dependence of $n_H$ on the electron\ndensity in the high field limit, but a non-singular dependence at low fields.\nThe existence of an assumed nematic transition produces a doping dependent\n$n_H$ similar to that observed in recent experiments in the high temperature\nsuperconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$.\n", "  Two-dimensional granular discharge flow driven by gravity under the influence\nof an obstacle is experimentally investigated. A horizontal exit of width $W$\nis opened at the bottom of vertical Hele-Shaw cell filled with stainless-steel\nparticles to start the discharge flow. In this experiment, a circular obstacle\nis placed in front of the exit. Thus, the distance between the exit and\nobstacle $L$ is also an important parameter. During the discharge,\ngranular-flow state is acquired by a high-speed camera. The bulk discharge-flow\nrate is also measured by load cell sensors. The obtained high-speed-image data\nare analyzed to clarify the particle-level granular-flow dynamics. Using the\nmeasured data, we find that the obstacle above the exit affects the\ngranular-flow field. Specifically, the existence of obstacle results in large\nhorizontal granular temperature and small packing fraction. This tendency\nbecomes significant when $L$ is smaller than approximately 6$D_g$ when $W\n\\simeq 4 D_g$, where $D_g$ is diameter of particles.\n", "  We show that the \"geometric models of matter\" approach proposed by the first\nauthor can be used to construct models of anyon quasiparticles with fractional\nquantum numbers, using 4-dimensional edge-cone orbifold geometries with\norbifold singularities along embedded 2-dimensional surfaces. The anyon states\narise through the braid representation of surface braids wrapped around the\norbifold singularities, coming from multisections of the orbifold normal bundle\nof the embedded surface. We show that the resulting braid representations can\ngive rise to a universal quantum computer.\n", "  Direct definition of the Cauchy-Jost (known also as Cauchy-Baker-Akhiezer)\nfunction in the case of pure solitonic solution is given and properties of this\nfunction are discussed in detail using the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equation\nas example. This enables formulation of the Darboux transformations in terms of\nthe Cauchy-Jost function and classification of these transformations. Action of\nDarboux transformations on Grassmanians-i.e., on the space of soliton\nparameters-is derived and relation of the Darboux transformations with property\nof total nonnegativity of elements of corresponding Grassmanians is discussed.\n", "  HSZ Double Field Theory is a higher-derivative theory of gravity with exact\nand manifest T-duality symmetry. The first order corrections in the massless\nsector were shown to be governed solely by Chern-Simons deformations of the\nthree-form field strength. We compute the full action with up to six\nderivatives ${\\cal O} (\\alpha'{}^2)$ for the universal sector containing the\nmetric, two-form and dilaton fields. The Green-Schwarz transformation of the\ntwo-form field remains uncorrected to second order. In addition to the expected\nChern-Simons-squared and Riemann-cubed terms the theory contains a cubic\nGauss-Bonnet interaction, plus other six-derivative unambiguous terms involving\nthe three-form field strength whose presence indicates that the theory must\ncontain further higher-derivative corrections.\n", "  Quantum revival is described as the time-periodic reconstruction of a wave\npacket initially localized in space and time. This effect is expected in\nfinite-size systems which exhibits commensurable discrete spectrum such as the\ninfinite quantum well. Here, we report on the experimental observation of full\nand fractional quantum revival for classical waves in a two dimensional cavity.\nWe consider flexural waves propagating in thin plates, as their quadratic\ndispersion at low frequencies mimics the dispersion relation of quantum systems\ngoverned by Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. Time-dependent excitation and measurement\nare performed at ultrasonic frequencies and reveal a periodic reconstruction of\nthe initial elastic wave packet.\n", "  Laser control of Open Quantum Systems (OQS) is a challenging issue as\ncompared to its counterpart in isolated small size molecules, basically due to\nvery large numbers of degrees of freedom to be accounted for. Such a control\naims at appropriately optimizing decoherence processes of a central two-level\nsystem (a given vibrational mode, for instance) towards its environmental bath\n(including, for instance, all other normal modes). A variety of applications\ncould potentially be envisioned, either to preserve the central system from\ndecaying (long duration molecular alignment or orientation, qubit decoherence\nprotection) or, to speed up the information flow towards the bath (efficient\ncharge or proton transfers in long chain organic compounds). Achieving such\ncontrols require some quantitative measures of decoherence in relation with\nmemory effects in the bath response, actually given by the degree of\nnon-Markovianity. Characteristic decoherence rates of a Spin-Boson model are\ncalculated using a Nakajima-Zwanzig type master equation with converged HEOM\nexpansion for the memory kernel. It is shown that, by adequately tuning the\ntwo-level transition frequency through a controlled Stark shift produced by an\nexternal laser field, non-Markovianity can be enhanced in a continuous way\nleading to a first attempt towards the control of OQS.\n", "  We discuss the fine-tuning issue within the MSSM framework. Following the\nidea that the fine-tuning can measure effects of some missing mechanism, we\nimpose non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scalem and explore the low scale\nimplications. We realize that the fine-tuning parametrized with Delta_EW can be\nas low as zero. We consider the stop mass with a special importance and focus\non the mass scales as m_stop <=700 GeV, which are excluded by current\nexperiments when the stop decays into a neutralino along with a top quark or a\nchargino along with a b quark. We find that the stop mass can be as low as\nabout 200 GeV with Delta_EW ~ 50. We find that the solutions in this region can\nbe exluded only up to 60% when stop decays into a neutralino-top quark, and 50%\nwhen it decays into a chargino-b quark pair. Setting 65% CL to be potential\nexclusion and 95% to be pure exclusion limit such solutions will be tested in\nnear future experiments, which are conducted with higher luminosity. In\naddition to stop, the region with low fine-tuning and light stops predicts\nmasses for the other supersymmetric particles such as m_sbottom >~ 600 GeV,\nm_stau >~ 1 TeV, m_chargino >~ 120 GeV. The details for the mass scales and\ndecay rates are also provided by tables of benchmark points.\n", "  We present a differential equation for the flow rate of granular materials\nduring the discharge of a silo. This is based in the energy balance of the\nvariable mass system in contrast with the traditional derivations based on\nheuristic postulates such as the free fall arch. We show that this new equation\nis consistent with the well known Beverloo rule, providing an independent\nestimate for the universal Beverloo prefactor. We also find an analytic\nexpression for the pressure under discharging conditions.\n", "  We show that, in a many-body system, all particles can be strongly confined\nto the initially occupied sites for a time that scales as a high power of the\nratio of the bandwidth of site energies to the hopping amplitude. Such\ntime-domain formulation is complementary to the formulation of the many-body\nlocalization of all stationary states with a large localization length. The\nlong localization lifetime is achieved by constructing a periodic sequence of\nsite energies with a large period in a one-dimensional chain. The scaling of\nthe localization lifetime is independent of the number of particles for a broad\nrange of the coupling strength. The analytical results are confirmed by\nnumerical calculations.\n", "  Requiring that the contributions of supersymmetric particles to the Higgs\nmass are not highly tuned places upper limits on the masses of superpartners --\nin particular the higgsino, stop, and gluino. We revisit the details of the\ntuning calculation and introduce a number of improvements, including RGE\nresummation, two-loop effects, a proper treatment of UV vs. IR masses, and\nthreshold corrections. This improved calculation more accurately connects the\ntuning measure with the physical masses of the superpartners at LHC-accessible\nenergies. After these refinements, the tuning bound on the stop is now also\nsensitive to the masses of the 1st and 2nd generation squarks, which limits how\nfar these can be decoupled in Effective SUSY scenarios. We find that, for a\nfixed level of tuning, our bounds can allow for heavier gluinos and stops than\npreviously considered. Despite this, the natural region of supersymmetry is\nunder pressure from the LHC constraints, with high messenger scales\nparticularly disfavored.\n", "  We show that many-body localization, which exists in tight-binding models, is\nunstable in a continuum. Irrespective of the dimensionality of the system,\nmany-body localization does not survive the unbounded growth of the\nsingle-particle localization length with increasing energy that is\ncharacteristic of the continuum limit. The system remains delocalized down to\narbitrarily small temperature $T$, although its dynamics slows down as $T$\ndecreases. Remarkably, the conductivity vanishes with decreasing $T$ faster\nthan in the Arrhenius law. The system can be characterized by an effective\n$T$-dependent single-particle mobility edge which diverges in the limit of\n$T\\to 0$. Delocalization is driven by interactions between hot electrons above\nthe mobility edge and the \"bath\" of thermal electrons in the vicinity of the\nFermi level.\n", "  We extend a recent theory for the rheology of frictionless granular materials\n[K. Suzuki and H. Hayakawa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2015, 115, 098001] to the case of\nfrictional disks in two dimensions. Employing a frictional contact model for\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we derive difference equations of the shear\nstress, the granular temperature, and the spin temperature from the generalized\nGreen-Kubo formula, where all the terms are given by microscopic expressions.\nThe numerical solutions of the difference equations not only describe the flow\ncurve, but also reproduce the hysteresis of shear stress, which can be the\nsignature of discontinuous shear thickening of frictional disks.\n", "  New results from MAST are presented that focus on validating models in order\nto extrapolate to future devices. Measurements during start-up experiments have\nshown how the bulk ion temperature rise scales with the square of the\nreconnecting field. During the current ramp up models are not able to correctly\npredict the current diffusion. Experiments have been performed looking at edge\nand core turbulence. At the edge detailed studies have revealed how filament\ncharacteristic are responsible for determining the near and far SOL density\nprofiles. In the core the intrinsic rotation and electron scale turbulence have\nbeen measured. The role that the fast ion gradient has on redistributing fast\nions through fishbone modes has led to a redesign of the neutral beam injector\non MAST Upgrade. In H-mode the turbulence at the pedestal top has been shown to\nbe consistent with being due to electron temperature gradient modes. A\nreconnection process appears to occur during ELMs and the number of filaments\nreleased determines the power profile at the divertor. Resonant magnetic\nperturbations can mitigate ELMs provided the edge peeling response is maximised\nand the core kink response minimised. The mitigation of intrinsic error fields\nwith toroidal mode number n>1 has been shown to be important for plasma\nperformance.\n", "  Sensors are the first element of the pathways that control the response of\ncells to their environment. After chemical, the next most important cue is\nmechanical, and protein complexes that produce or enable a chemical signal in\nresponse to a mechanical stimulus are called mechanosensors. There is a sharp\ndistinction between sensing an external force or pressure/tension applied to\nthe cell, and sensing the mechanical stiffness of the environment. We call the\nfirst mechanosensitivity of the 1st kind, and the latter mechanosensitivity of\nthe 2nd kind. There are two variants of protein complexes that act as\nmechanosensors of the 2nd kind: producing either a one-off or a reversible\naction. The latent complex of TGF-$\\beta$ is an example of the one-off action:\non the release of active TGF-$\\beta$ signal, the complex is discarded and needs\nto be replaced. In contrast, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in a complex with\nintegrin is a reversible mechanosensor, which initiates the chemical signal in\nits active phosphorylated conformation, but can spontaneously return to its\nclosed folded conformation. Here we study the physical mechanism of the\nreversible mechanosensor of the 2nd kind, using FAK as a practical example. We\nfind how the rates of conformation changes depend on the substrate stiffness\nand the pulling force applied from the cell cytoskeleton. The results compare\nwell with the phenotype observations of cells on different substrates.\n", "  The High Luminosity Upgrade of the LHC will require the replacement of the\nInner Detector of ATLAS with the Inner Tracker (ITk) in order to cope with\nhigher radiation levels and higher track densities. Prototype silicon strip\ndetector modules are currently developed and their performance is studied in\nboth particle test beams and X-ray beams. In previous test beam studies of\nprototype modules, silicon sensor strips were found to respond in regions\nvarying from the strip pitch of 74.5 {\\upmu}m. The variations have been linked\nto local features of the sensor architecture. This paper presents results of\ndetailed sensor measurements in both X-ray and particle beams investigating the\nimpact of sensor features (metal pads and p-stops) on the responding area of a\nsensor strip.\n", "  We will investigate the scenario in which the Standard Model (SM) Higgs\nsector and its 2-doublet extension (called the Two Higgs Doublet Model or 2HDM)\nare the \"portal\" for the interactions between the Standard Model and a\nfermionic Dark Matter (DM) candidate. The latter is the lightest stable neutral\nparticle of a family of vector-like leptons (VLLs). We will provide an\nextensive overview of this scenario combining the constraints purely coming\nfrom DM phenomenology with more general constraints like Electro-weak Precision\nTests (EWPT) as well as with collider searches. In the case that the new\nfermionic sector interacts with the SM Higgs sector, constraints from DM\nphenomenology force the new states to lie above the TeV scale. This requirement\nis relaxed in the case of 2HDM. Nevertheless, strong constraints coming from\nElectroweak Precision Tests (EWPT) and the Renormalization Group Equations\n(RGEs) limit the impact of VLFs on collider phenomenology.\n", "  The antiferromagnetic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice is one\nof the most paradigmatic models in the context of spin liquids, yet the precise\nnature of its ground state is not understood. We use large scale density matrix\nnormalization group simulations (DMRG) on infinitely long cylinders and find\nindications for the formation of a gapless Dirac spin liquid. First, we use\nadiabatic flux insertion to demonstrate that the spin gap is much smaller than\nestimated from previous DMRG simulation. Second, we find that the momentum\ndependent excitation spectrum, as extracted from the DMRG transfer matrix,\nexhibits Dirac cones that match those of a $\\pi$-flux free fermion model (the\nparton mean-field ansatz of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid)\n", "  Conventional optical zoom system is bulky, expensive and complicated for real\ntime adjustment. Recent progress in the metasurface research has provided a new\nsolution to achieve innovative compact optical systems. In this paper, we\npropose a highly integrated zoom lens with dual field-of-view (FOV) based on\ndouble sided metasurfaces. With silicon nanobrick arrays of spatially varying\norientations sitting on both side of a transparent substrate, this ultrathin\nzoom metalens can be designed to focus an incident circular polarized beam with\nspin-dependent FOVs without varying the focal plane, which is important for\npractical applications. The proposed dual FOV zoom metalens, with the\nadvantages such as ultracompactness, flexibility and replicability, can find\napplications in fields which require ultracompact zoom imaging and beam\nfocusing.\n", "  This paper starts from the far-field behaviours of velocity field in\nexternally-unbounded flow. We find that the well-known algebraic decay of\ndisturbance velocity as derived kinematically is too conservative. Once the\nkinetics is taken into account by working on the fundamental solutions of\nfar-field linearized Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that the furthest\nfar-field zone adjacent to the uniform fluid at infinity must be unsteady,\nviscous and compressible, where all disturbances degenerate to sound waves that\ndecay exponentially. But this optimal rate does not exist in some commonly used\nsimplified flow models, such as steady flow, incompressible flow and inviscid\nflow, because they actually work in true subspaces of the unbounded free space,\nwhich are surrounded by further far fields of different nature. This finding\nnaturally leads to a zonal structure of externally-unbounded flow field. The\nsignificance of the zonal structure is demonstrated by its close relevance to\nexisting theories of aerodynamic force and moment in external flows, including\nthe removal of the difficulties or paradoxes inherent in the simplified models.\n", "  We study and derive the energy conditions in generalized non-local gravity,\nwhich is the modified theory of general relativity (GR) obtained by adding a\nterm $m^{2n-2}R\\Box^{-n}R$ to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Moreover, in order\nto get some insight on the meaning of the energy conditions, we illustrate the\nevolutions of four energy conditions with the model parameter $\\varepsilon$ for\ndifferent $n$. By analysis we give the constraints on the model parameters\n$\\varepsilon$.\n", "  The dual-fermion approach provides a formally exact prescription for\ncalculating properties of a correlated electron system in terms of a\ndiagrammatic expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Most\npractical implementations, however, neglect higher-order interaction vertices\nbeyond two-particle scattering in the dual effective action and further\ntruncate the diagrammatic expansion in the two-particle scattering vertex to a\nleading-order or ladder-type approximation. In this work we compute the\ndual-fermion expansion for the two-dimensional Hubbard model including all\ndiagram topologies with two-particle interactions to high orders by means of a\nstochastic diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. We benchmark the obtained\nself-energy against numerically exact Diagrammatic Determinant Monte Carlo\nsimulations to systematically assess convergence of the dual-fermion series and\nthe validity of these approximations. We observe that, from high temperatures\ndown to the vicinity of the DMFT N\\'eel transition, the dual-fermion series\nconverges very quickly to the exact solution in the whole range of Hubbard\ninteractions considered ($4 \\leq U/t \\leq 12$), implying that contributions\nfrom higher-order vertices are small. As the temperature is lowered further, we\nobserve slower series convergence, convergence to incorrect solutions, and\nultimately divergence. This happens in a regime where magnetic correlations\nbecome significant. We find however that the self-consistent particle-hole\nladder approximation yields reasonable and often even highly accurate results\nin this regime.\n", "  We consider the full 3D dynamics of a thin falling liquid film on a flat\nplate inclined at some non-zero angle to the horizontal. In addition to\ngravitational effects, the flow is driven by an electric field, which is normal\nto the substrate far from the flow. We study both the cases of overlying and\nhanging films, where the liquid rests above and below the substrate\nrespectively. Starting with the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with\nelectrostatics, a fully nonlinear 2D Benney equation for the interfacial\ndynamics is derived valid for waves that are long compared to the film\nthickness. The weakly nonlinear evolution is governed by a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\nequation with a non-local term due to the electric field effect. The electric\nfield term is linearly destabilising and produces growth rates proportional to\nthe cube of the size of the wavenumber vector of the perturbations. It is found\nthat transverse gravitational instabilities are always present for hanging\nfilms and lead to unboundedness of solutions even in the absence of electric\nfields. For overlying films and a restriction on the strength of the electric\nfield, the equation possesses bounded solutions. This 2D equation is studied\nnumerically for the case of periodic boundary conditions in order to assess the\neffects of inertia, electric field strength the dimensions of the periodic\ndomain. Rich dynamical behaviours are observed and classified in various\nparameter windows. For subcritical Reynolds number flows, a sufficiently strong\nelectric field can promote non-trivial dynamics for some choices of domain\ndimensions, leading to fully 2D evolutions for the interface. These dynamics\nare also found to produce spatiotemporal chaos on sufficiently large domains.\nFor supercritical flows, such 2D chaotic dynamics emerge in the absence of a\nfield, and its presence enhances the amplitude of the fluctuations and broadens\ntheir spectrum.\n", "  Single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction as a function of temperature and\npressure has revealed a complex biphase mixture in superconducting FeSe. Based\non our experimental results we construct a phase diagram where structural\nbehavior and superconducting properties of FeSe are found to be correlated. We\nshow that below 6 GPa, where pressure promotes the superconducting critical\ntemperature, the FeSe structure is composed of 2D layers of edge-shared FeSe4\ntetrahedra, while above 6 GPa the superconductivity is strongly suppressed on\nformation of a new orthorhombic polymorph characterized by a 3D network of face\nsharing FeSe6 octahedra. Therefore changes in topology and connectivity of the\nFeSe structure are found to be detrimental for superconductivity to exist. This\npreviously controversial crystal structure of the high pressure polymorph of\nFeSe was also unambiguously determined. High pressure FeSe adopts an\northorhombic MnP-type structure (Pnma) which corresponds to a slightly\ndistorted hexagonal NiAs-type arrangement (P63/mmc). The structural\ntransformation from the low- to high-pressure FeSe polymorph is first order in\nnature and is manifested as antiparallel displacements within the Fe and Se\nsublattices.\n", "  We explore a simple solution to the cosmological challenges of the original\nMirror Twin Higgs (MTH) model that leads to interesting implications for\nexperiment. We consider theories in which both the standard model and mirror\nneutrinos acquire masses through the familiar seesaw mechanism, but with a low\nright-handed neutrino mass scale of order a few GeV. In these $\\nu$MTH models,\nthe right-handed neutrinos leave the thermal bath while still relativistic. As\nthe universe expands, these particles eventually become nonrelativistic, and\ncome to dominate the energy density of the universe before decaying. Decays to\nstandard model states are preferred, with the result that the visible sector is\nleft at a higher temperature than the twin sector. Consequently the\ncontribution of the twin sector to the radiation density in the early universe\nis suppressed, allowing the current bounds on this scenario to be satisfied.\nHowever, the energy density in twin radiation remains large enough to be\ndiscovered in future cosmic microwave background experiments. In addition, the\ntwin neutrinos are significantly heavier than their standard model\ncounterparts, resulting in a sizable contribution to the overall mass density\nin neutrinos that can be detected in upcoming experiments designed to probe the\nlarge scale structure of the universe.\n", "  The group of rigid motions is considered to guide the search for a natural\nsystem of space-time coordinates in General Relativity. This search leads us to\na natural extension of the space-times that support Painlev\\'{e}--Gullstrand\nsynchronization. As an interesting example, here we describe a system of rigid\ncoordinates for the cross mode of gravitational linear plane waves.\n", "  In a recent Letter, Zhao et al. [1] reported the origin of\nquasi-one-dimensional metal-insulator (MI) transitions in compound\nsemiconductor surfaces. Based on a density-functional theory (DFT) calculation\nwithin the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), they claimed that\none-atom-wide metallic structures formed by a selective bonding of H or Li\natoms to GaN(10-10) and ZnO(10-10) undergo the Peierls-type MI transitions,\nleading to a charge-density-wave (CDW) formation with periodic lattice\ndistortion. However, we here demonstrate that such a CDW phase is due to the\nartifact of the GGA, while the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state is\npredicted by the hybrid DFT calculation and the exact-exchange plus correlation\nin the random-phase approximation (EX + cRPA).\n  [1] J. Z. Zhao, W. Fan, M. J. Verstraete, Z. Zanolli, J. Fan, X. B. Yang, H.\nXu, and S. Y. Tong, Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 116101 (2016).\n", "  Entanglement entropy has proven invaluable to our understanding of quantum\ncriticality. It is natural to try to extend the concept to non-unitary quantum\nmechanics, which has seen growing interest from areas as diverse as open\nquantum systems, non-interacting electronic disordered systems, or non-unitary\nconformal field theory (CFT). We propose and investigate such an extension\nhere, by focussing on the case of one-dimensional quantum group symmetric or\nsupergroup symmetric spin chains. We show that the consideration of left and\nright eigenstates combined with appropriate definitions of the trace leads to a\nnatural definition of R\\'enyi entropies in a large variety of models. We\ninterpret this definition geometrically in terms of related loop models and\ncalculate the corresponding scaling in the conformal case. This allows us to\ndistinguish the role of the central charge and effective central charge in\nrational minimal models of CFT, and to define an effective central charge in\nother, less well understood cases. The example of the $sl(2|1)$ alternating\nspin chain for percolation is discussed in detail.\n", "  First-order statistics of scattered light is described using the\nrepresentation of probability density cloud which visualizes a two-dimensional\ndistribution for complex amplitude. The geometric parameters of the cloud are\nstudied in detail and are connected to the statistical properties of phase. The\nmoment-generating function for intensity is obtained in a closed form through\nthese parameters. An example of exponentially modified normal distribution is\nprovided to illustrate the functioning of this geometrical approach.\n", "  We have extended the semi-classical theory to include a general account of\nmatrix valued Hamiltonians, i.e. those that describe quantum systems with\ninternal degrees of freedoms, based on a generalization of the Gutzwiller trace\nformula for a $n\\times n$ dimensional Hamiltonian $H(\\hat{\\boldsymbol\np},\\hat{\\boldsymbol q})$. The classical dynamics is governed by $n$\nHamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations, that act in a phase space endowed with a\nclassical Berry curvature encoding anholonomy in the parallel transport of the\neigenvectors of $H(\\hat{\\boldsymbol p}\\to\\boldsymbol p,\\hat{\\boldsymbol\nq}\\to\\boldsymbol q)$, which describe the internal structure of the\nsemi-classical particles. This Berry curvature is a fully classical object and\nis, in that sense, as fundamental to the semi-classical theory of matrix\nHamiltonians as the Hamilton-Jacobi equations. At the $\\mathcal{O}(\\hbar^1)$\nlevel, it results in an additional semi-classical phase composed of (i) a Berry\nphase and (ii) a dynamical phase resulting from the classical particles \"moving\nthrough the Berry curvature\". We show that the dynamical part of this\nsemi-classical phase will, generally, only be zero only for the case in which\nthe Berry phase is topological (i.e. depends only on the winding number). We\nillustrate the method by calculating the Landau spectrum for monolayer\ngraphene, the four-band model of AB bilayer graphene, and for a more\ncomplicated matrix Hamiltonian describing the silicene band structure. Finally\nwe apply our method to an inhomogeneous system consisting of a strain\nengineered one dimensional moir\\'e in bilayer graphene, finding localized\nstates near the Dirac point that arise from electron trapping in a\nsemi-classical moir\\'e potential. The semi-classical density of states of these\nlocalized states we show to be in perfect agreement with an exact quantum\nmechanical calculation of the density of states.\n", "  The subtle interplay between local and global charges for topological\nsemimetals exactly parallels that for singular vector fields. Part of this\nstory is the relationship between cohomological semimetal invariants, Euler\nstructures, and ambiguities in the torsion of manifolds. Dually, a topological\nsemimetal can be represented by Euler chains from which its surface Fermi arc\nconnectivity can be deduced. These dual pictures, and the link to topological\ninvariants of insulators, are organised using geometric exact sequences. We go\nbeyond Dirac-type Hamiltonians and introduce new classes of semimetals whose\nlocal charges are subtle Atiyah-Dupont-Thomas invariants globally constrained\nby the Kervaire semicharacteristic, leading to the prediction of torsion Fermi\narcs.\n", "  Growing evidence reveals universal hardening on various cosmic ray spectra,\ne.g. proton, positron, as well as antiproton fraction. Such universality may\nindicate they have a common origin. In this paper, we argue that these\nwidespread excesses can be accounted for by a nearby supernova remnant\nsurrounded by a giant molecular cloud. Secondary cosmic rays ($\\rm p$, $\\rm\ne^+$) are produced through the collisions between the primary cosmic ray nuclei\nfrom this supernova remnant and the molecular gas. Different from the\nbackground, which is produced by the ensemble of large amount of sources in the\nMilky Way, the local injected spectrum can be harder. The time-dependent\ntransport of particles would make the propagated spectrum even harder. Under\nthis scenario, the anomalies of both primary ($\\rm p$, $\\rm e^-$) and secondary\n($\\rm e^+$, $\\rm \\bar{p}/p$) cosmic rays can be properly interpreted. We\nfurther show that the TeV to sub-PeV anisotropy of proton is consistent with\nthe observations if the local source is relatively young and lying at the\nanti-Galactic center direction.\n", "  We report on a novel pseudothermal light source based on laser light coupled\ninto an optical multimode fiber. The setup is simple, of low cost, exhibits\ninherently high directional light emission and allows for a flexible\narrangement. By measuring the photon statistics and spatial two point intensity\ncorrelations in the far field we show that the setup exhibits all\ncharacteristics of a gaussian random source.\n", "  We study holographic isotropization of an anisotropic homogeneous non-Abelian\nstrongly coupled plasma in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet corrections. It was\nverified before that one can linearize Einstein's equations around the final\nblack hole background and simplify the complicated setup. Using this approach,\nwe study the expectation value of the boundary stress tensor. Although we\nconsider small values of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, it is found that\nfinite coupling leads to significant increasing of the thermalization time. By\nincluding higher order corrections in linearization, we extend the results to\nstudy the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the entropy production on the\nevent horizon.\n", "  The installation of forward detectors in CMS and ATLAS turn the LHC to an\neffective photon-photon collider. The elastic scattering of the beam-protons\nvia the emission of photons, which can be identified by tagging the intact\nprotons in the forward detectors, provides a powerful diagnostic of the central\nproduction of new particles through photon-photon annihilation. In this letter\nwe study the central production of dark matter particles and the potential of\nLHC to constrain the cross section of this process. By virtue of the crossing\nsymmetry, this limit can immediately be used to constrain the production of\nmonochromatic gamma-rays in dark matter annihilation, a smoking gun signal\nunder investigation in indirect dark matter searches. We show that with the\nintegrated luminosity $\\mathcal{L}=30~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ in LHC at center-of-mass\nenergy $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV, for dark matter masses $\\sim (50-600)$ GeV, a\nmodel-independent constraint on the cross section of dark matter annihilation\nto monochromatic gamma-rays at the same order of magnitude as the current\nFermi-LAT and the future limits from CTA, can be obtained.\n", "  Gustafson's integrals are multidimensional generalizations of the classical\nMellin-Barnes integrals. We show that some of these integrals arise from\nrelations between matrix elements in Sklyanin's representation of Separated\nVariables in spin chain models. We also present several new integrals.\n", "  The employment of magneto-optical materials to fabricate photonic crystals\ngives the unique opportunity to achieve optical tuning by applying a magnetic\nfield. In this study we have simulated the transmission spectrum of a\nmicrocavity in which the Bragg reflectors are made with silica (SiO2) and\nyttria (Y2O3) and the defect layer is made with TGG (Tb3Ga5O12). We show that\nthe application of an external magnetic field results in a tuning of the defect\nmode of the microcavity. In the simulations we have considered the wavelength\ndependence of the refractive indexes and the Verdet constants of the materials.\nA tuning of the defect mode of about 22 nm with a magnetic field of 5 T, at low\ntemperature (8 K), is demonstrated. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility to\ntune a microcavity with disordered photonic structures as reflectors. In the\npresence of the magnetic field such microcavity shows a shift of resonances in\na broad range of wavelengths. This study presents a method of contactless\noptical tuning.\n", "  We apply a Gaussian variational approximation to model reduction in large\nbiochemical networks of unary and binary reactions. We focus on a small subset\nof variables (subnetwork) of interest, e.g. because they are accessible\nexperimentally, embedded in a larger network (bulk). The key goal is to write\ndynamical equations reduced to the subnetwork but still retaining the effects\nof the bulk. As a result, the subnetwork-reduced dynamics contains a memory\nterm and an extrinsic noise term with non-trivial temporal correlations. We\nfirst derive expressions for this memory and noise in the linearized (Gaussian)\ndynamics and then use a perturbative power expansion to obtain first order\nnonlinear corrections. For the case of vanishing intrinsic noise, our\ndescription is explicitly shown to be equivalent to projection methods up to\nquadratic terms, but it is applicable also in the presence of stochastic\nfluctuations in the original dynamics. An example from the Epidermal Growth\nFactor Receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway is provided to probe the increased\nprediction accuracy and computational efficiency of our method.\n", "  We report results of the calculation of the low-lying levels of neutral Si\nusing a combination of the configuration interaction and many-body perturbation\ntheory (CI+MBPT method). We treat Si I as an atom with four valence electrons\nand use two different starting approximations, namely $V^{N-2}$ and $V^{N-4}$.\nWe conclude that both approximations provide comparable accuracy, on the level\nof 1%.\n", "  Mechanical metamaterials are those structures designed to convey force and\nmotion in novel and desirable ways. Recently, Kane and Lubensky showed that\nlattices at the point of marginal mechanical stability (Maxwell lattices)\npossess a topological invariant that describes the distribution of floppy,\nzero-energy edge modes. Here, we show that applying force at a point in the\nbulk of these lattices generates a directional mechanical response, in which\nstress or strain is induced only on one side of the force. This provides both a\nbulk metric for mechanical polarization and a design principle to convey\nstresses and strains towards or away from parts of the structure. We also\ncharacterize the effects of removing bonds on the material's structure and\nfloppy modes, establishing a relationship between edge modes and bulk response.\n", "  The coding space in quantum communication could be expanded to\nhigh-dimensional space by using orbital angular momentum (OAM) states of\nphotons, as both the capacity of the channel and security are enhanced. Here we\npresent a novel approach to realize high-capacity quantum key distribution\n(QKD) by exploiting OAM states. The innovation of the proposed approach relies\non a unique type of entangledphoton source which produces entangled photons\nwith OAM randomly distributed among high order Fiboncci-like numbers and a new\nphysical mechanism for efficiently sharing keys. This combination of\nentanglement with mathematical properties of high order Fibonacci sequences\nprovides the QKD protocol which is immune to photon-number-splitting attacks\nand allows secure generation of long keys from few photons. Unlike other\nprotocols, reference frame alignment and active modulation of production and\ndetection bases are unnecessary.\n", "  A hierarchy of statistics of increasing sophistication and accuracy is\nproposed, to exploit an interesting and fundamental arithmetic structure in the\nphoton bunching noise of incoherent light of large photon occupation number,\nwith the purpose of suppressing the noise and rendering a more reliable and\nunbiased measurement of the light intensity. The method does not require any\nnew hardware, rather it operates at the software level, with the help of high\nprecision computers, to reprocess the intensity time series of the incident\nlight to create a new series with smaller bunching noise coherence length. The\nultimate accuracy improvement of this method of flux measurement is limited by\nthe timing resolution of the detector and the photon occupation number of the\nbeam (the higher the photon number the better the performance). The principal\napplication is accuracy improvement in the bolometric flux measurement of a\nradio source.\n", "  It was observed recently that the multidimensional Mellin--Barnes integrals\n(Gustafson's integrals) arise naturally in studies of the $SL(2,R)$ spin chain\nmodels. We extend this analysis to the noncompact $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ spin\nmagnets and obtain integrals which generalize Gustafson's integrals to the\ncomplex case.\n", "  We improve the Monte-Carlo based QCD sum rules by introducing the rigorous\nH\\\"older-inequality-determined sum rule window and a Breit-Wigner type\nparametrization for the phenomenological spectral function. In this improved\nsum rule analysis methodology, the sum rule analysis window can be determined\nwithout any assumptions on OPE convergence or the QCD continuum.Therefore an\nunbiased prediction can be obtained for the phenomenological parameters (the\nhadronic mass and width etc.). We test the new approach in the $\\rho$ meson\nchannel with re-examination and inclusion of $\\alpha_s$ corrections to\ndimension-4 condensates in the OPE. We obtain results highly consistent with\nexperimental values. We also discuss the possible extension of this method to\nsome other channels.\n", "  Solutions of the linearized Einstein equations are found that describe a\ntransversely confined beam of circularly polarized gravitational waves on a\nMinkowski backdrop. By evaluating the cycle-averaged stress-energy-momentum\npseudotensor of Landau & Lifshitz it is found that the angular momentum density\nis concentrated in the 'skin' at the edge of the beam where the intensity\nfalls, and that the ratio of angular momentum to energy per unit length of the\nbeam is $2/\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the wave frequency, as expected for a\nbeam of spin-$2$ gravitons. For sharply-defined, uniform, axisymmetric beams,\nthe induced background metric is shown to produce the gravomagnetic field and\nframe-dragging effects of a gravitational solenoid, whilst the angular momentum\ncurrent additionally twists the contained space helically.\n", "  We review the physics of many-body localization in models with incommensurate\npotentials. In particular, we consider one-dimensional quasiperiodic models\nwith single-particle mobility edges. Although a conventional perspective\nsuggests that delocalized states act as a thermalizing bath for the localized\nstates in the presence of of interactions, there is evidence that such systems\ncan display non-ergodicity. This is in part due to the fact that the\ndelocalized states do not have any kind of protection due to symmetry or\ntopology and are thus susceptible to localization. A study of non-interacting\nincommensurate models shows that they admit extended, partially extended, and\nfully localized many-body states. These models cannot thermalize dynamically\nand remain localized upon the introduction of interactions. In particular, for\na certain range of energy, the system can host a non-ergodic extended (i.e.\nmetallic) phase in which the energy eigenstates violate the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH) but the entanglement entropy obeys volume-law\nscaling. The level statistics and entanglement growth also indicate the lack of\nergodicity in these models. The phenomenon of localization and non-ergodicity\nin a system with interactions despite the presence of single-particle\ndelocalized states is closely related to the so-called \"many-body proximity\neffect\" and can also be observed in models with disorder coupled to systems\nwith delocalized degrees of freedom. Many-body localization in systems with\nincommensurate potentials (without single-particle mobility edges) have been\nrealized experimentally, and we show how this can be modified to study the the\neffects of such mobility edges. Demonstrating the failure of thermalization in\nthe presence of a single-particle mobility edge in the thermodynamic limit\nwould indicate a more robust violation of the ETH.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the eigenvalue statistics of exponentially\nweighted ensembles of full binary trees and $p$-branching star graphs. We show\nthat spectral densities of corresponding adjacency matrices demonstrate\npeculiar ultrametric structure inherent to sparse systems. In particular, the\ntails of the distribution for binary trees share the \"Lifshitz singularity\"\nemerging in the one-dimensional localization, while the spectral statistics of\n$p$-branching star-like graphs is less universal, being strongly dependent on\n$p$. The hierarchical structure of spectra of adjacency matrices is interpreted\nas sets of resonance frequencies, that emerge in ensembles of fully branched\ntree-like systems, known as dendrimers. However, the relaxational spectrum is\nnot determined by the cluster topology, but has rather the number-theoretic\norigin, reflecting the peculiarities of the rare-event statistics typical for\none-dimensional systems with a quenched structural disorder. The similarity of\nspectral densities of an individual dendrimer and of ensemble of linear chains\nwith exponential distribution in lengths, demonstrates that dendrimers could be\nserved as simple disorder-less toy models of one-dimensional systems with\nquenched disorder.\n", "  We show that electrons recolliding with the ionic core upon tunnel ionization\nof noble gas atoms driven by a strong circularly polarized laser field in\ncombination with a counter-rotating second harmonic are spin polarized and that\ntheir degree of polarization depends strongly on the recollision time. Spin\npolarization arises as a consequence of (1) entanglement between the\nrecolliding electron and the ion, and (2) sensitivity of ionization to the\nsense of electron rotation in the initial state. We demonstrate that one can\nengineer the degree of spin polarization as a function of time by tuning the\nrelative intensities of the counter-rotating fields, opening the door for\nattosecond control of spin-resolved dynamics.\n", "  When a Dirac semimetal is subject to a circularly polarized laser, it is\npredicted that the Dirac cone splits into two Weyl nodes and a nonequilibrium\ntransient state called the Floquet Weyl semimetal is realized. We focus on the\npreviously unexplored low-frequency regime, where the upper and lower Dirac\nbands resonantly couple with each other through multi-photon processes, which\nis a realistic situation in solid state ultrafast pump-probe experiments. We\nfind a series of new Weyl nodes emerging in pairs when the Floquet replica\nbands hybridize with each other. The nature of the Floquet Weyl semimetal with\nregard to the number, locations, and monopole charges of these Weyl nodes is\nhighly tunable with the amplitude and frequency of the light. We derive an\neffective low energy theory using Brillouin-Wigner expansion and further\nregularize the theory on a cubic lattice. The monopole charges obtained from\nthe low-energy Hamiltonian can be reconciled with the number of Fermi arcs on\nthe lattice which we find numerically.\n", "  In this paper we construct the ambitwistor superstring in the Green-Schwarz\nformulation. The model is obtained from the related pure spinor version. We\nshow that the spectrum contains only ten dimensional supergravity and that\nkappa symmetry in a curved background implies some of the standard constraints.\n", "  In this work we consider the non-equilibrium dynamics of two tunnel coupled\nbosonic gases which are created from the coherent splitting of a\none-dimensional gas. The consequences of the tunneling both in the\nnon-stationary regime as well as at large time are investigated and compared\nwith equilibrium results. In particular, within a semiclassical approximation,\nwe compute correlation functions for the relative phase which are\nexperimentally measurable and we observe a transient regime displaying\noscillations as a function of the distance. The steady regime is very well\napproximated by a thermal state with a temperature independent of the tunneling\nstrength.\n", "  A new technique for contrast separation in wide-field magneto-optical Kerr\nmicroscopy is introduced. Utilizing the light from eight light emitting diodes,\nguided to the microscope by glass fibers and being switched synchronously with\nthe camera exposure, domain images with orthogonal in-plane sensitivity can be\ndisplayed simultaneously at real-time and images with pure in-plane or polar\ncontrast can be obtained. The benefit of this new method of contrast separation\nis demonstrated for permalloy films, a NdFeB sinter magnet, and a cobalt\ncrystal. Moreover, the new technique is shown to strongly enhance the\nsensitivity of Kerr microscopy by eliminating parasitic contrast contributions\noccurring in conventional setups. A doubling of the in-plane domain contrast\nand a sensitivity to Kerr rotations as low as 0.6~mdeg is demonstrated\n", "  We present the conformal behavior of the shear viscosity-to-entropy density\nratio and the fermion-number diffusion coefficient within the perturbative\nregime of the conformal window for gauge-fermion theories.\n", "  The importance of considering near-field effects on photon recycling and\nspontaneous emission in a thermophotovoltaic device is investigated.\nFluctuational electrodynamics is used to calculate external luminescence from a\nphotovoltaic cell as a function of emitter type, vacuum gap thickness between\nemitter and cell, and cell thickness. The observed changes in external\nluminescence suggest strong modifications of photon recycling caused by the\npresence of the emitter. Photon recycling for propagating modes is affected by\nreflection at the vacuum-emitter interface and is substantially decreased by\nthe leakage towards the emitter through tunneling of frustrated modes. In\naddition, spontaneous emission by the cell can be strongly enhanced by the\npresence of an emitter supporting surface polariton modes. It follows that\nusing a radiative recombination model with a spatially uniform radiative\nlifetime, even corrected by a photon recycling factor, is inappropriate.\nApplying the principles of detailed balance, and accounting for non-radiative\nrecombination mechanisms, the impact of external luminescence enhancement in\nthe near field on thermophotovoltaic performance is investigated. It is shown\nthat unlike isolated cells, the external luminescence efficiency is not solely\ndependent on cell quality, but significantly increases as the vacuum gap\nthickness decreases below 400 nm for the case of an intrinsic silicon emitter.\nIn turn, the open-circuit voltage and power density benefit from this enhanced\nexternal luminescence toward the emitter. This benefit is larger as cell\nquality, characterized by the contribution of non-radiative recombination,\ndecreases.\n", "  We propose a simple geometric algorithm for determining the complete set of\nbranch points of amplitudes in planar N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory directly from\nthe amplituhedron, without resorting to any particular representation in terms\nof local Feynman integrals. This represents a step towards translating\nintegrands directly into integrals. In particular, the algorithm provides\ninformation about the symbol alphabets of general amplitudes. We illustrate the\nalgorithm applied to the one- and two-loop MHV amplitudes.\n", "  Voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) is an efficient way to\nmanipulate the magnetization states in nanomagnets, promising for low-power\nspintronic applications. The underlying physical mechanism for VCMA is known to\ninvolve a change in the d-orbital occupation on the transition metal interface\natoms with an applied electric field. However, a simple qualitative picture of\nhow this occupation controls the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and even\nwhy in certain cases the MCA has opposite sign still remains elusive. In this\npaper, we exploit a simple model of orbital populations to elucidate a number\nof features typical for the interface MCA and the effect of electric field on\nit, for 3d transition metal thin films used in magnetic tunnel junctions. We\nfind that in all considered cases including the Fe (001) surface, clean\nFe1-xCox(001)/MgO interface and oxidized Fe(001)/MgO interface, the effects of\nalloying and electric field enhance the MCA energy with electron depletion\nwhich is largely explained by the occupancy of the minority-spin dxz,yz\norbitals. On the other hand, the hole doped Fe(001) exhibits an inverse VCMA,\nwhere the MCA enhancement is achieved when electrons are accumulated at the Fe\n(001)/MgO interface with applied electric field. In this regime we predict a\nsignificantly enhanced VCMA which exceeds 1pJ/Vm. Realizing this regime\nexperimentally may be favorable for a practical purpose of voltage driven\nmagnetization reversal.\n", "  The direct muon transfer from protium to neon at low collision energies is\nconsidered. The question is discussed how the energy dependence of the transfer\nrate can be extracted from available experimental data. A model is suggested\nwhich is based on two assumptions. First, the muon transfer occurs within an\ninteraction sphere out of which the entrance and transfer channels are not\ncoupled. Secondly, for the s- and p-waves at low collision energies, the\ncomplex logarithmic derivatives of the radial wave functions of the entrance\nchannel on the interaction sphere are energy-independent. With only the s-wave\ntaken into account, two values of the logarithmic derivative were found, which\nagree with the transfer rates measured at the temperatures of 20 and 300 K.\nWithin this temperature interval, the rates evaluated for these two values\ndiffer only slightly. Noticeable differences arise at temperatures of a few\nkelvins. The choice of the preferred value of the logarithmic derivative was\nmade by the comparison of the energy dependence of the S-matrix with results of\nprevious calculations. Thereby, the proposed procedure may be a way to correct\ncalculations at low collision energies.\n", "  In this paper I propose a new model for representing the formation energies\nof multicomponent crystalline alloys as a function of atom types. In the cases\nwhen displacements of atoms from their equilibrium positions are not large, the\nproposed method has a similar accuracy as the state-of-the-art cluster\nexpansion method, and a better accuracy when the fitting dataset size is small.\nThe proposed model has only two tunable parameters - one for the interaction\nrange and one for the interaction complexity.\n", "  We introduce a new numerical technique -- bosonic auxiliary-field Monte Carlo\n(bAFMC) -- which allows to calculate the thermal properties of large\nlattice-boson systems within a systematically improvable semiclassical\napproach, and which is virtually applicable to any bosonic model. Our method\namounts to a decomposition of the lattice into clusters, and to an Ansatz for\nthe density matrix of the system in the form of a cluster-separable state --\nwith non-entangled, yet classically correlated clusters. This approximation\neliminates any sign problem, and can be systematically improved upon by using\nclusters of growing size. Extrapolation in the cluster size allows to reproduce\nnumerically exact results for the superfluid transition of hardcore bosons on\nthe square lattice, and to provide a solid quantitative prediction for the\nsuperfluid and chiral transition of hardcore bosons on the frustrated\ntriangular lattice.\n", "  We develop the exact renormalization group approach as a way to evaluate the\neffective speed of propagation of a scalar wave in a medium with random\ninhomogeneities. We use the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism to translate the\nproblem into a non equilibrium field theory one, and then consider a sequence\nof models with a progressively lower infrared cutoff; in the limit where the\ncutoff is removed we recover the problem of interest. As a test of the\nformalism, we compute the effective dielectric constant of an homogeneous\nmedium interspersed with randomly located, interpenetrating bubbles. Already a\nsimple approximation to the renormalization group equations turns out to be\nequivalent to a self-consistent two-loops evaluation of the effective\ndielectric constant.\n", "  We extend a previously developed ultrafast ultrasonic technique [Gallot et\nal., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 84, 045107 (2013)] to concentration field measurements\nin non-Brownian particle suspensions under shear. The technique provides access\nto time-resolved concentration maps within the gap of a Taylor-Couette cell\nsimultaneously to local velocity measurements and standard rheological\ncharacterization. Benchmark experiments in homogeneous particle suspensions are\nused to calibrate the system. We then image heterogeneous concentration fields\nthat result from centrifugation effects, from the classical Taylor-Couette\ninstability and from sedimentation or shear-induced resuspension.\n", "  The effects of non-axisymmetric resonant magnetic perturbation fields (RMPs)\non saturated drift-wave turbulence and on ballooning mode bursts in the edge\npedestal of tokamak plasmas are investigated by numerical simulations with a\nnonlinear six-moment electromagnetic gyrofluid model including zonal profile\nevolution. The vacuum RMP fields are screened by plasma response currents, so\nthat magnetic transport by perturbed parallel motion is not significantly\nchanged. Radial transport of both particles and heat is dominated by turbulent\nconvection even for large RMP amplitudes, where formation of stationary\nconvective structures leads to edge profile degradation. Modelling of ideal\nballooning mode unstable edge profiles for single bursts including RMP fields\ncauses resonant mode locking and destabilization.\n", "  We study in this paper magnetic properties of a system of quantum Heisenberg\nspins interacting with each other via a ferromagnetic exchange interaction J\nand an in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction D. The non-collinear ground\nstate due to the competition between J and D is determined. We employ a\nself-consistent Green'function theory to calculate the spin-wave spectrum and\nthe layer magnetizations at finite T in two and three dimensions as well as in\na thin film with surface effects. Analytical details and the validity of the\nmethod are shown and discussed.\n", "  Structure-preserving geometric algorithm for the Vlasov-Maxwell (VM)\nequations is currently an active research topic. We show that\nspatially-discretized Hamiltonian systems for the VM equations admit a local\nenergy conservation law in space-time. This is accomplished by proving that for\na general spatially-discretized system, a global conservation law always\nimplies a discrete local conservation law in space-time when the algorithm is\nlocal. This general result demonstrates that Hamiltonian discretizations can\npreserve local conservation laws, in addition to the symplectic structure, both\nof which are the intrinsic physical properties of infinite dimensional\nHamiltonian systems in physics.\n", "  Ultrashort pulsed mode-locked lasers enable research at new time-scales and\nrevolutionary technologies from bioimaging to materials processing. In general,\nthe performance of these lasers is determined by the degree to which the pulses\nof a particular resonator can be scaled in energy and pulse duration before\ndestabilizing. To date, milestones have come from the application of more\ntolerant pulse solutions, drawing on nonlinear concepts like soliton formation\nand self-similarity. Despite these advances, lasers have not reached the\npredicted performance limits anticipated by these new solutions. In this\nletter, towards resolving this discrepancy, we demonstrate that the route by\nwhich the laser arrives at the solution presents a limit to performance which,\nmoreover, is reached before the solution itself becomes unstable. In contrast\nto known self-starting limitations stemming from suboptimal saturable\nabsorption, we show that this limit persists even with an ideal saturable\nabsorber. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this limit can be completely\nsurmounted with an iteratively seeded technique for mode-locking. Iteratively\nseeded mode-locking is numerically explored and compared to traditional static\nseeding, initially achieving a five-fold increase in energy. This approach is\nbroadly applicable to mode-locked lasers and can be readily implemented into\nexisting experimental architectures.\n", "  Tree-level scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills are known to\nbe Yangian-invariant. It has been shown that integrability allows to obtain a\ngeneral, explicit method to find such invariants. The uplifting of this result\nto the amplituhedron construction has been an important open problem. In this\npaper, with the help of methods proper to integrable theories, we successfully\nfill this gap and clarify the meaning of Yangian invariance for the tree-level\namplituhedron. In particular, we construct amplituhedron volume forms from an\nunderlying spin chain. As a by-product of this construction, we also propose a\nnovel on-shell diagrammatics for the amplituhedron.\n", "  Optical phase shifters and switches play an important role for various\noptical applications including optical signal processing, sensing and\ncommunication. In this paper, we demonstrate a fiber all optical phase shifter\nusing few-layer 2D material tungsten disulfide (WS2) deposited on a tapered\nfiber. WS2 absorbs injected 980 nm pump (control light) and generates heat\nwhich changes the refractive index of the tapered fiber due to thermo-optic\neffect and achieves a maximum phase shift of 6.1{\\pi} near 1550 nm. The device\nhas a loss of 3.7 dB. By constructing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with WS2\nbased phase shifter in one arm, an all optical switch is also obtained with an\nextinction ratio of 15 dB and a rise time of 7.3 ms. This all fiber low-cost\nand compact optical phase shifter and switch demonstrates the potential of 2D\ntransition metal dichalcogenides for all optical signal processing devices.\n", "  Four light-mass nuclei are considered by an effective two-body clusterisation\nmethod; $^6$Li as $^2$H$+^4$He, $^7$Li as $^3$H$+^4$He, $^7$Be as\n$^3$He$+^4$He, and $^8$Be as $^4$He$+^4$He. The low-energy spectrum of each is\ndetermined from single-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equations, as are low-energy\nelastic scattering cross sections for the $^2$H$+^4$He system. These are\npresented at many angles and energies for which there are data. While some of\nthese systems may be more fully described by many-body theories, this work\nestablishes that a large amount of data may be explained by these two-body\nclusterisations.\n", "  Techniques for performing model-independent searches for direct CP violation\nin three and four-body decays are discussed. Comments on the performance and\nthe optimisation of a binned chisquare approach and an unbinned approach, known\nas the energy test, are made. The use of the energy test in the presence of\nbackground is also studied. The selection and treatment of the coordinates used\nto describe the phase-space of the decay are discussed. The conventional\nmodel-independent techniques, which test for P-even CP violation, are modified\nto create a new approach for testing for P-odd CP violation. An implementation\nof the energy test using GPUs is described.\n", "  The complete classification of the nilpotent orbits of ${\\rm SO}(2,2)^2$ in\nthe representation ${\\bf (2,2,2,2)}$, achieved in \\cite{Dietrich:2016ojx}, is\napplied to the study of multi-center, asymptotically flat, extremal black hole\nsolutions to the STU model. These real orbits provide an intrinsic\ncharacterization of regular single-center solutions, which is invariant with\nrespect to the action of the global symmetry group ${\\rm SO}(4,4)$, underlying\nthe stationary solutions of the model, and provide stringent regularity\nconstraints on multi-centered solutions. The known \\emph{almost-BPS} and\n\\emph{composite non-BPS} solutions are revisited in this setting. We\nsystematically provide, for the relevant ${\\rm SO}(2,2)^2$-nilpotent orbits of\nthe global Noether charge matrix, regular representatives thereof. This\nanalysis unveils a composition law of the orbits according to which those\ncontaining regular multi-centered solutions can be obtained as combinations of\nspecific single-center orbits defining the constituent black holes. Some of the\n${\\rm SO}(2,2)^2$-orbits of the total Noether charge matrix are characterized\nas \"intrinsically singular\" in that they cannot contain any regular solution.\n", "  We analyze intersecting surface defects inserted in interacting\nfour-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric quantum field theories. We employ the\nrealization of a class of such systems as the infrared fixed points of\nrenormalization group flows from larger theories, triggered by perturbed\nSeiberg-Witten monopole-like configurations, to compute their partition\nfunctions. These results are cast into the form of a partition function of\n4d/2d/0d coupled systems. Our computations provide concrete expressions for the\ninstanton partition function in the presence of intersecting defects and we\nstudy the corresponding ADHM model.\n", "  Slow-roll inflation can become eternal if the quantum variance of the\ninflaton field around its slowly rolling classical trajectory is converted into\na distribution of classical spacetimes inflating at different rates, and if the\nvariance is large enough compared to the rate of classical rolling that the\nprobability of an increased rate of expansion is sufficiently high. Both of\nthese criteria depend sensitively on whether and how perturbation modes of the\ninflaton interact and decohere. Decoherence is inevitable as a result of\ngravitationally-sourced interactions whose strength are proportional to the\nslow-roll parameters. However, the weakness of these interactions means that\ndecoherence is typically delayed until several Hubble times after modes grow\nbeyond the Hubble scale. We present perturbative evidence that decoherence of\nlong-wavelength inflaton modes indeed leads to an ensemble of classical\nspacetimes with differing cosmological evolutions. We introduce the notion of\nper-branch observables---expectation values with respect to the different\ndecohered branches of the wave function---and show that the evolution of modes\non individual branches varies from branch to branch. Thus single-field\nslow-roll inflation fulfills the quantum-mechanical criteria required for the\nvalidity of the standard picture of eternal inflation. For a given potential,\nthe delayed decoherence can lead to slight quantitative adjustments to the\nregime in which the inflaton undergoes eternal inflation.\n", "  We study transient charges formed in methane clusters following ionization by\nintense near-infrared laser pulses. Cluster ionization by 400 fs ($I=1 \\times\n10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$) pulses is highly efficient, resulting in the observation of\na dominant C$^{3+}$ ion contribution. The C$^{4+}$ ion yield is very small, but\nis strongly enhanced by applying a time-delayed weak near-infrared pulse. We\nconclude that most of the valence electrons are removed from their atoms during\nthe laser-cluster interaction, and that electrons from the nanoplasma recombine\nwith ions and populate Rydberg states when the cluster expands, leading to a\n\\textit{decrease} of the average charge state of individual ions. Furthermore,\nwe find clear bound-state signatures in the electron kinetic energy spectrum,\nwhich we attribute to Auger decay taking place in expanding clusters. Such\nnonradiative processes lead to an \\textit{increase} of the final average ion\ncharge state that is measured in experiments. Our results suggest that it is\ncrucial to include both recombination and nonradiative decay processes for the\nunderstanding of recorded ion charge spectra.\n", "  We develop a generalized pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group\n(PFFRG) approach that can be applied to arbitrary Heisenberg models with spins\nranging from the quantum case $S=1/2$ to the classical limit\n$S\\rightarrow\\infty$. Within this framework, spins of magnitude $S$ are\nrealized by implementing $M=2S$ copies of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom on each\nlattice site. We confirm that even without explicitly projecting onto the\nhighest spin sector of the Hilbert space, ground states tend to select the\nlargest possible local spin magnitude. This justifies the average treatment of\nthe pseudo fermion constraint in previous spin-1/2 PFFRG studies. We apply this\nmethod to the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb Heisenberg model with\nnearest neighbor $J_1>0$ and second neighbor $J_2>0$ interactions. Mapping out\nthe phase diagram in the $J_2/J_1$-$S$ plane we find that upon increasing $S$\nquantum fluctuations are rapidly decreasing. In particular, already at $S=1$ we\nfind no indication for a magnetically disordered phase. In the limit\n$S\\rightarrow\\infty$, the known phase diagram of the classical system is\nexactly reproduced. More generally, we prove that for $S\\rightarrow\\infty$ the\nPFFRG approach is identical to the Luttinger-Tisza method.\n", "  We present a simple trick that allows to consider the sum of all connected\nFeynman diagrams at fixed position of interaction vertices for general\nfermionic models. With our approach one achieves superior performance compared\nto Diagrammatic Monte Carlo, while rendering the algorithmic part dramatically\nsimpler. As we consider the sum of all connected diagrams at once, we allow for\ncancellations between diagrams with different signs, alleviating the sign\nproblem. Moreover, the complexity of the calculation grows exponentially with\nthe order of the expansion, which should be constrasted with the factorial\ngrowth of the standard diagrammatic technique. We illustrate the efficiency of\nthe technique for the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model.\n", "  In the AdS/CFT correspondence, bulk information appears to be encoded in the\nCFT in a redundant way. A local bulk field corresponds to many different\nnon-local CFT operators (precursors). We recast this ambiguity in the language\nof BRST symmetry, and propose that in the large $N$ limit, the difference\nbetween two precursors is a BRST exact and ghost-free term. Using the BRST\nformalism and working in a simple model with global symmetries, we re-derive a\nprecursor ambiguity appearing in earlier work. Finally, we show within this\nmodel that this BRST ambiguity has the right number of parameters to explain\nthe freedom to localize precursors within the boundary of an entanglement wedge\norder by order in the large $N$ expansion.\n", "  The HI in disk galaxies frequently extends beyond the optical image, and can\ntrace the dark matter there. I briefly highlight the history of high spatial\nresolution HI imaging, the contribution it made to the dark matter problem, and\nthe current tension between several dynamical methods to break the disk-halo\ndegeneracy. I then turn to the flaring problem, which could in principle probe\nthe shape of the dark halo. Instead, however, a lot of attention is now devoted\nto understanding the role of gas accretion via galactic fountains. The current\n$\\rm \\Lambda$ cold dark matter theory has problems on galactic scales, such as\nthe core-cusp problem, which can be addressed with HI observations of dwarf\ngalaxies. For a similar range in rotation velocities, galaxies of type Sd have\nthin disks, while those of type Im are much thicker. After a few comments on\nmodified Newtonian dynamics and on irregular galaxies, I close with statistics\non the HI extent of galaxies.\n", "  The analysis of the chemical composition of galaxies provides fundamental\ninsights into their evolution. This holds true also in the case of the outer\nregions of spiral galaxies. This Chapter presents the observational data,\naccumulated in the past few years mostly from the analysis of HII region\nspectra, concerning the metallicity of the outer disks of spirals that are\ncharacterized by extended HI envelopes and low star formation rates. I present\nevidence from the literature that the metal radial distribution flattens at\nlarge galactocentric distances, with levels of enrichment that exceed those\nexpected given the large gas mass fractions and the weak star formation\nactivity. The interpretation of these results leads to speculations regarding\nmechanisms of metal mixing in galactic disks and the possibility that\nmetal-enriched gas infall plays a role in determining the chemical evolution of\nthe outskirts of spirals.\n", "  QSO absorption spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of both the neutral\nmedium and diffuse ionized gas in the distant Universe. It extends 21cm maps of\ngaseous structures around low-redshift galaxies both to lower gas column\ndensities and to higher redshifts. Combining galaxy surveys with\nabsorption-line observations of gas around galaxies enables comprehensive\nstudies of baryon cycles in galaxy outskirts over cosmic time. This Chapter\npresents a review of the empirical understanding of the cosmic neutral gas\nreservoir from studies of damped Lya absorbers (DLAs). It describes the\nconstraints on the star formation relation and chemical enrichment history in\nthe outskirts of distant galaxies from DLA studies. A brief discussion of\navailable constraints on the ionized circumgalactic gas from studies of lower\ncolumn density Lya absorbers and associated ionic absorption transitions is\npresented at the end.\n", "  Directed networks such as gene regulation networks and neural networks are\nconnected by arcs (directed links). The nodes in a directed network are often\nstrongly interwound by a huge number of directed cycles, which lead to complex\ninformation-processing dynamics in the network and make it highly challenging\nto infer the intrinsic direction of information flow. In this theoretical\npaper, based on the principle of minimum-feedback, we explore the node\nhierarchy of directed networks and distinguish feedforward and feedback arcs.\nNearly optimal node hierarchy solutions, which minimize the number of feedback\narcs from lower-level nodes to higher-level nodes, are constructed by\nbelief-propagation and simulated-annealing methods. For real-world networks, we\nquantify the extent of feedback scarcity by comparison with the ensemble of\ndirection-randomized networks and identify the most important feedback arcs.\nOur methods are also useful for visualizing directed networks.\n", "  We study the configuration of efficient nonlinear Cerenkov diffraction\ngenerated from a one-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal surface, which\nunderlies the incorporation of both quasi-phase-matching and total internal\nreflection by the crystal surface. Multidirectional radiation spots with\ndifferent Cerenkov angles are demonstrated experimentally, which results from\ndifferent orders of reciprocal vectors. At specific angles, the incident light\nand total internal reflect light associating with quasi-phase-matching format\ncompletely phase-matching scheme, leading to great enhancement of harmonic\nefficiency.\n", "  Deep imaging is a fundamental tool in the study of the outermost structures\nof galaxies. We review recent developments in ultra-deep imaging of galaxy\ndisks and haloes, highlighting the technical advances as well as the\nchallenges, and summarizing observational results in the context of modern\ntheory and simulations. The deepest modern galaxy imaging comes from three main\nsources: (1) surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Stripe 82 project,\n(2) very long exposures on small telescopes, including by amateurs, and (3)\nlong exposures on the largest professional telescopes. The technical challenges\nfaced are common in all these approaches, and include the treatment of light\nscattered by atmosphere and telescope/instrument, correct flat fielding, and\nthe subtraction of non-galaxy light in the images. We review scientific results\non galaxy disks and haloes obtained with deep imaging, including the detection\nand characterization of stellar haloes, tidal features and stellar streams,\ndisk truncations, and thick disks. The area of ultra-deep imaging is still very\nmuch unexplored territory, and future work in this area promises significant\nadvances in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.\n", "  Galaxy haloes contain fundamental clues about the galaxy formation and\nevolution process: hierarchical cosmological models predict haloes to be\nubiquitous, and to be (at least in part) the product of past merger and/or\naccretion events. The advent of wide-field surveys in the last two decades has\nrevolutionized our view of our own Galaxy and its closest \"sister\", Andromeda,\nrevealing copious tidal streams from past and ongoing accretion episodes, as\nwell as doubling the number of their known faint satellites. The focus shall\nnow be shifted to galaxy haloes beyond the Local Group: resolving individual\nstars over significant areas of galaxy haloes will enable estimates of their\nages, metallicities and gradients. The valuable information collected for\ngalaxies with a range of masses, morphologies and within diverse environments\nwill ultimately test and quantitatively inform theoretical models of galaxy\nformation, and shed light onto the many challenges faced by simulations on\ngalactic scales.\n", "  The properties and star formation processes in the far-outer disks of nearby\nspiral and dwarf irregular galaxies are reviewed. The origin and structure of\nthe generally exponential profiles in stellar disks is considered to result\nfrom cosmological infall combined with a non-linear star formation law and a\nhistory of stellar migration and scattering from spirals, bars, and random\ncollisions with interstellar clouds. In both spirals and dwarfs, the far-outer\ndisks tend to be older, redder and thicker than the inner disks, with the\noverall radial profiles suggesting inside-out star formation plus stellar\nscattering in spirals, and outside-in star formation with a possible\ncontribution from scattering in dwarfs. Dwarf irregulars and the far-outer\nparts of spirals both tend to be gas dominated, and the gas radial profile is\noften non-exponential although still decreasing with radius. The ratio of\nH-alpha to far-UV flux tends to decrease with lower surface brightness in these\nregions, suggesting either a change in the initial stellar mass function or the\nsampling of that function, or a possible loss of H-alpha photons.\n", "  We present measurements of the growth rate of cosmological structure from the\nmodelling of the anisotropic galaxy clustering measured in the final data\nrelease of the VIPERS survey. The analysis is carried out in configuration\nspace and based on measurements of the first two even multipole moments of the\nanisotropic galaxy auto-correlation function, in two redshift bins spanning the\nrange $0.5 < z < 1.2$. We provide robust and cosmology-independent corrections\nfor the VIPERS angular selection function, allowing recovery of the underlying\nclustering amplitude at the percent level down to the Mpc scale. We discuss\nseveral improvements on the non-linear modelling of redshift-space distortions\n(RSD) and perform detailed tests of a variety of approaches against a set of\nrealistic VIPERS-like mock realisations. This includes using novel fitting\nfunctions to describe the velocity divergence and density power spectra\n$P_{\\theta\\theta}$ and $P_{\\delta\\theta}$ that appear in RSD models. These\ntests show that we are able to measure the growth rate with negligible bias\ndown to separations of $5h^{-1}Mpc$. Interestingly, the application to real\ndata shows a weaker sensitivity to the details of non-linear RSD corrections\ncompared to mock results. We obtain consistent values for the growth rate times\nthe matter power spectrum normalisation parameter of $f\\sigma_8=0.55\\pm 0.12$\nand $0.40\\pm0.11$ at effective redshifts of $z = 0.6$ and $z=0.86$\nrespectively. These results are in agreement with standard cosmology\npredictions assuming Einstein gravity in a $\\Lambda \\rm{CDM}$ background.\n", "  We study the physics of turbulent/non-turbulent interface of an isolated\nturbulent region in dilute polymer solutions and Newtonian fluid. The\nperformance of a FENE-P model with a localized homogeneous forcing is verified\nusing the specially designed experimental setup of a turbulent patch growing in\nwater/dilute polymer solution, without mean shear and far from the walls. The\nresults of the small scale dynamics of vorticity and strain help to reveal the\nkey mechanism of polymer action in turbulent flows without mean shear. Modified\ndegrees of alignment between vorticity, the polymer conformation and the\nrate-of-strain tensors found especially near the interface explain the reduced\nvorticity stretching and increased vorticity compression terms. These small\nscale alignments in the non-Newtonian turbulent flow thus lead to a reduced\nproduction of enstrophy and consequently to a reduced entrainment (seen as\npropagation or dispersion).\n", "  We investigate the effect of non-trivial spatial correlations between proton\nconstituents, considered in this work to be gluonic hot spots, on the initial\nconditions of proton-proton collisions from ISR to LHC energies, i.e. $\\sqrt\ns\\!=\\!52.6,7000,13000$ GeV. The inclusion of these correlations is motivated by\ntheir fundamental role in the description of a recently observed new feature of\n$pp$ scattering at $\\sqrt s\\!=\\!7$ TeV, the hollowness effect. Our analysis\nrelies on a Monte-Carlo Glauber approach including fluctuations in the hot spot\npositions and their entropy deposition in the transverse plane. We explore both\nthe energy dependence and the effect of spatial correlations on the number of\nwounded hot spots, their spatial distribution and the eccentricities,\n$\\varepsilon_n$, of the initial state geometry of the collision. In minimum\nbias collisions we find that the inclusion of short range repulsive\ncorrelations between the hot spots reduces the value of the eccentricity\n($\\varepsilon_2$) and the triangularity ($\\varepsilon_3$). In turn, upon\nconsidering only the events with the highest entropy deposition i.e. the\nultra-central ones, the probability of having larger $\\varepsilon_{2,3}$\nincreases significantly in the correlated scenario. Finally, the eccentricities\nshow a quite mild energy dependence.\n", "  The Universe is almost totally unexplored at low surface brightness levels.\nIn spite of great progress in the construction of large telescopes and\nimprovements in the sensitivity of detectors, the limiting surface brightness\nof imaging observations has remained static for about forty years. Recent\ntechnical advances have at last begun to erode the barriers preventing\nprogress. In this Chapter we describe the technical challenges to low surface\nbrightness imaging, describe some solutions, and highlight some relevant\nobservations that have been undertaken recently with both large and small\ntelescopes. Our main focus will be on discoveries made with the Dragonfly\nTelephoto Array (Dragonfly), which is a new telescope concept designed to probe\nthe Universe down to hitherto unprecedented low surface brightness levels. We\nconclude by arguing that these discoveries are probably only scratching the\nsurface of interesting phenomena that are observable when the Universe is\nexplored at low surface brightness levels.\n", "  A number of irreducible master integrals for L-loop sunrise-type and bubble\nFeynman diagrams with generic values of masses and external momenta are\nexplicitly evaluated via Mellin-Barnes representation.\n", "  We study non-analytic behavior in the static charge susceptibility in finite\ndensity states of the ABJM theory using its holographic dual. Emphasis is\nplaced on a particular state characterized by vanishing entropy density at zero\ntemperature, and Fermi surface-like singularities in various fermionic\ncorrelation functions. The susceptibility exhibits branch points in the complex\nmomentum plane, with a real part quantitatively very similar to the location of\nthe Fermi surface singularities.\n", "  The main purpose of this paper is to extend results, which have been obtained\npreviously to describe the classical scattering of solitons with integrable\ndefects of type I, to include the much larger and intricate collection of\nfinite-gap solutions defined in terms of generalised theta functions. In this\ncontext, it is generally not feasible to adopt a direct approach, via ansatze\nfor the fields to either side of the defect tuned to satisfy the defect sewing\nconditions. Rather, essential use is made of the fact that the defect sewing\nconditions themselves are intimately related to Backlund transformations in\norder to set up a strategy to enable the calculation of the field on one side\nby suitably transforming the field on the other side. The method is implemented\nusing Darboux transformations and illustrated in detail for the sine-Gordon and\nKdV models. An exception, treatable by both methods, indirect and direct, is\nprovided by the genus 1 solutions. These can be expressed in terms of Jacobi\nelliptic functions, which satisfy a number of useful identities of relevance to\nthis problem. There are new features to the solutions obtained in the\nfinite-gap context but, in all cases, if a (multi)soliton limit is taken within\nthe finite-gap solutions previously known results are recovered.\n", "  We investigate the long-wavelength dispersion of longitudinal and transverse\noptical phonon modes in polar two-dimensional materials, multilayers, and their\nheterostructures. Using analytical models and density-functional perturbation\ntheory in a two-dimensional framework, we show that, at variance with the\nthree-dimensional case, these modes are degenerate at the zone center but the\nmacroscopic electric field associated with the longitudinal-optical modes gives\nrise to a finite slope at the zone center in their corresponding phonon\ndispersions. This slope increases linearly with the number of layers and it is\ndetermined solely by the Born effective charges of the material and the\ndielectric properties of the surrounding media. Screening from the environment\ncan greatly reduce the slope splitting between the longitudinal and transverse\noptical modes and can be seen in the experimentally relevant case of boron\nnitride-graphene heterostructures. As the phonon momentum increases, the\nintrinsic screening properties of the two-dimensional material dictate the\ntransition to a momentum-independent splitting similar to that of\nthree-dimensional materials. These considerations are essential to understand\nelectrical transport and optical coupling in two-dimensional systems.\n", "  We study the truncated Kramers-Kronig (KK) medium to reveal the effects of\nnonreciprocity in reflection on the scattering and the wave guiding properties.\nWe focus on the simplest possible spatial profile mimicking the dielectric\nresponse. We show that a finite slab of KK medium can support only one sided\nnull scattering under bidirectional identical illumination. However, for a\nphase lag between the two incident beams it is possible to have null scattering\non the other side. This is shown to be a consequence of the nonreciprocity in\nreflection due to the inherent asymmetry of the KK medium. We further look at\nthe possibility of surface modes for unidirectional illumination. For specific\nrange of parameters, we show the existence of TM polarized surface plasmons\nonly for illumination from one side. The origin of such modes is traced to the\ninhomogeneous metal like layer with negative real part of the permittivity in\nthe KK medium.\n", "  We apply point-particle effective field theory (PPEFT) to compute the leading\nshifts due to finite-size source effects in the Coulomb bound energy levels of\na relativistic spinless charged particle. This is the analogue for spinless\nelectrons of the contribution of the charge-radius of the source to these\nlevels, and we disagree with standard calculations in several ways. Most\nnotably we find there are two effective interactions with the same dimension\nthat contribute to leading order in the nuclear size. One is the standard\ncharge-radius contribution, while the other is a contact interaction whose\nleading contribution to $\\delta E$ arises linearly in the small length scale,\n$\\epsilon$, characterizing the finite-size effects, and is suppressed by\n$(Z\\alpha)^5$. We argue that standard calculations miss the contributions of\nthis second operator because they err in their choice of boundary conditions at\nthe source for the wave-function of the orbiting particle. PPEFT predicts how\nthis boundary condition depends on the source's charge radius, as well as on\nthe orbiting particle's mass. Its contribution turns out to be crucial if the\ncharge radius satisfies $\\epsilon \\lesssim (Z\\alpha)^2 a_B$, with $a_B$ the\nBohr radius, since then relativistic effects become important. We show how the\nproblem is equivalent to solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation with competing\nCoulomb, inverse-square and delta-function potentials, which we solve\nexplicitly. A similar enhancement is not predicted for the hyperfine structure,\ndue to its spin-dependence. We show how the charge-radius effectively runs due\nto classical renormalization effects, and why the resulting RG flow is central\nto predicting the size of the energy shifts. We discuss how this flow is\nrelevant to systems having much larger-than-geometric cross sections, and the\npossible relevance to catalysis of reactions through scattering with monopoles.\n", "  Time reversal invariant topological superconducting (TRITOPS) wires are known\nto host a fractional spin hbar/4 at their ends. We investigate how this\nfractional spin affects the Josephson current in a TRITOPS-quantum dot-TRITOPS\nJosephson junction, describing the wire in a model which can be tuned between a\ntopological and a nontopological phase. We compute the equilibrium Josephson\ncurrent of the full model by continuous-time Monte Carlo simulations and\ninterpret the results within an effective low-energy theory. We show that in\nthe topological phase, the 0-to-pi transition is quenched via formation of a\nspin singlet from the quantum dot spin and the fractional spins associated with\nthe two adjacent topological superconductors.\n", "  Lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes via four-Fermi contact interactions\nat future International Linear Collider (ILC) are studied. The effective\nLagrangian is composed of six-operators, and the LFV effects on both $e^+ e^-\n\\to e^+ \\ell^-$ and $e^- e^- \\to e^- \\ell^-$ ($\\ell=\\mu$ or $\\tau$) processes\ncan be parametrized by three parameters. Taking account of previous\nexperimental results of LFV processes $\\mu\\to 3e$ and $\\tau \\to 3e$, we find\nthat the upper limits on the LFV parameters for $\\ell=\\tau$ could be improved\nat the ILC experiment using the polarized electron beam. The improvement of the\nupper limits is more than an order of magnitude smaller than previous ones.\n", "  In this work, we report the pressure dependence of the effective Coulomb\ninteraction parameters (Hubbard U) in paramagnetic NiO within the constrained\nrandom phase approximation (cRPA). We consider five different low energy models\nstarting from the most expensive one that treats both Ni-d and O-p states as\ncorrelated orbitals (dp-dp model) to the smallest possible two-orbital model\ncomprising the eg states only (eg-eg model). We find that in all the considered\nmodels, the bare interactions are not very sensitive to the compression.\nHowever the partially screened interaction parameters show an almost linear\nincrement as a function of compression, resulting from the substantial\nweakening of screening effects upon compression. This counterintuitive trend is\nexplained from the specific characteristic changes of the basic electronic\nstructure of this system. We further calculate the nearest neighbor inter-site\nd-d interaction terms which also show substantial enhancement due to\ncompression. Our results for both the experimental and highly compressed\nstructures reveal that the frequency dependence of the partially screened\ninteractions can not be ignored in a realistic modeling of NiO. We also find\nthat the computed interaction parameters for the antiferromagnetic NiO are\nalmost identical to their paramagnetic counter parts.\n", "  We study the relative contribution of cusps and pseudocusps, on cosmic\n(super)strings, to the emitted bursts of gravitational waves. The gravitational\nwave emission in the vicinity of highly relativistic points on the string\nfollows, for a high enough frequency, a logarithmic decrease. The slope has\nbeen analytically found to be $^{-4}/_3$ for points reaching exactly the speed\nof light in the limit $c=1$. We investigate the variations of this high\nfrequency behaviour with respect to the velocity of the points considered, for\nstrings formed through a numerical simulation, and we then compute numerically\nthe gravitational waves emitted. We find that for string points moving with\nvelocities as far as $10^{-3}$ from the theoretical (relativistic) limit $c=1$,\ngravitational wave emission follows a behaviour consistent with that of cusps,\neffectively increasing the number of cusps on a string. Indeed, depending on\nthe velocity threshold chosen for such behaviour, we show the emitting part of\nthe string worldsheet is enhanced by a factor ${\\cal O}(10^3)$ with respect to\nthe emission of cusps only.\n", "  We propose a mechanism whereby the intense, sheet-like structures naturally\nformed by dynamically aligning Alfv\\'enic turbulence are destroyed by magnetic\nreconnection at a scale $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm D}$, larger than the dissipation\nscale predicted by models of intermittent, dynamically aligning turbulence. The\nreconnection process proceeds in several stages: first, a linear tearing mode\nwith $N$ magnetic islands grows and saturates, and then the $X$-points between\nthese islands collapse into secondary current sheets, which then reconnect\nuntil the original structure is destroyed. This effectively imposes an upper\nlimit on the anisotropy of the structures within the perpendicular plane, which\nmeans that at scale $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm D}$ the turbulent dynamics change: at\nscales larger than $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm D}$, the turbulence exhibits\nscale-dependent dynamic alignment and a spectral index approximately equal to\n$-3/2$, while at scales smaller than $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm D}$, the turbulent\nstructures undergo a succession of disruptions due to reconnection, limiting\ndynamic alignment, steepening the effective spectral index and changing the\nfinal dissipation scale. The scaling of $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm D}$ with the\nLundquist (magnetic Reynolds) number $S_{L_\\perp}$ depends on the order of the\nstatistics being considered, and on the specific model of intermittency; the\ntransition between the two regimes in the energy spectrum is predicted at\napproximately $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm D} \\sim S_{L_\\perp}^{-0.6}$. The spectral\nindex below $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\rm D}$ is bounded between $-5/3$ and $-2.3$. The\nfinal dissipation scale is at $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\eta,\\infty}\\sim\nS_{L_\\perp}^{-3/4}$, the same as the Kolmogorov scale arising in theories of\nturbulence that do not involve scale-dependent dynamic alignment.\n", "  To remedy the failure of minimal coupling method in describing the quantum\ndynamics of two localized Brownian oscillators interacting with a common\nmedium, a scheme is introduced to modeling the medium by a continuum of complex\nscalar fields or equivalently two independent real scalar fields. The starting\npoint is a Lagrangian of the total system and quantization is achieved in the\nframework of canonical quantization. The equations of motion, memory or\nresponse functions and fluctuation-dissipation relations are obtained. An\ninduced force between oscillators is obtained originating from the fluctuations\nof the medium. Ohmic regime and Drude regularization is discussed and the\npositions of oscillators are obtained approximately in large time limit and\nweak coupling regime.\n", "  We study the small scale distribution of the $L^2$-mass of eigenfunctions of\nthe Laplacian on the the two-dimensional flat torus. Given an orthonormal basis\nof eigenfunctions, Lester and Rudnick showed the existence of a density one\nsubsequence whose $L^2$-mass equidistributes more-or-less down to the Planck\nscale. We give a more precise version of their result showing equidistribution\nholds down to a small power of log above Planck scale, and also showing that\nthe $L^2$-mass fails to equidistribute at a slightly smaller power of log above\nthe Planck scale.\n  This article rests on a number of results about the proximity of lattice\npoints on circles, much of it based on foundational work of Javier Cilleruelo.\n", "  Time reversal symmetry is a fundamental property of many quantum mechanical\nsystems. The relation between statistical physics and time reversal is subtle\nand not all statistical theories conserve this particular symmetry, most\nnotably hydrodynamic equations and kinetic equations such as the Boltzmann\nequation. In this article it is shown analytically that quantum kinetic\ngeneralizations of the Boltzmann equation that are derived using the\nnonequilibrium Green functions formalism as well as all approximations that\nstem from $\\Phi$-derivable selfenergies are time reversal invariant.\n", "  Over the last decade a number of important observational results have been\nreported using data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. We shall review some of\nthe recent key findings that have significantly advanced our understanding of\nultra-high energy cosmic rays and that have called into question the\n`classical' interpretation of the flux-suppression above 5x10^{19} eV as being\ncaused (solely) by the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin effect. Instead, the data\nsuggest seeing mostly the maximum energy of extragalactic cosmic ray\naccelerators. This has a number of implications, ranging from reduced prospects\nof doing particle physics with cosmogenic neutrinos to reduced chances of\nseeing the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays at all. To address these\nemerging and pressing scientific questions, the Pierre Auger Observatory is\npresently being upgraded to AugerPrime. It will enable composition measurements\ninto the flux-suppression region and also improve the particle physics\ncapabilities. An Engineering Array has been deployed and is taking data. Full\nconstruction will start late 2017.\n", "  We introduce a near-threshold parameterization that is more general than the\neffective-range expansion up to and including the effective-range because it\ncan also handle with a near-threshold zero in the $D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ $S$-wave.\nIn terms of it we analyze the CDF data on inclusive $p\\bar{p}$ scattering to\n$J/\\psi \\pi^+\\pi^-$, and the Belle and BaBar data on $B$ decays to $K\\, J/\\psi\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $K D\\bar{D}^{*0}$ around the $D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ threshold. It is\nshown that data can be reproduced with similar quality for the $X(3872)$ being\na bound {\\it and/or} a virtual state. We also find that the $X(3872)$ might be\na higher-order virtual-state pole (double or triplet pole), in the limit in\nwhich the small $D^{*0}$ width vanishes. Once the latter is restored the\ncorrections to the pole position are non-analytic and much bigger than the\n$D^{*0}$ width itself. The $X(3872)$ compositeness coefficient in\n$D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}$ ranges from nearly 0 up to 1 in the different scenarios.\n", "  Plasmon resonances are known to amplify the electromagnetic fields near\nmetallic nanostructures. Therefore, they are considered to provide a promising\nscheme to generate extreme-ultraviolet harmonics, using low power drivings.\nDuring high-order harmonic generation (HHG), the driving and harmonic fields\naccumulate a phase difference as they propagate through the target. In a\ntypical set-up -a laser focused into a gas jet or cell- the propagation\ndistances amount to several wavelengths, and the cumulative phase-mismatch\naffects strongly the efficiency and properties of the harmonic emission. In\ncontrast, HHG in metallic nanostructures is considered to overcome this\nlimitations, as the common sources of phase mismatch -optical density and\nfocusing geometry- are negligible for subwavelength propagation distances.\nNevertheless, in this letter we demonstrate that phase matching still plays a\nrelevant role in HHG from nanostructures. Our computations attribute this to\nthe non-perturbative character of HHG, that links the phase of the harmonics to\nthe intensity distribution of the driving field. We also show that widely used\napplications of phase matching control, such as quantum path selection and the\nincrease of contrast in attosecond pulse generation, are also feasible at the\nnanoscale.\n", "  The (heterotic) double field theories and the exceptional field theories are\nrecently developed for manifestly duality covariant formulation of various\nsupergravity theories, describing low-energy limit of various (heterotic)\nsuperstring and M-theory compactifications. These field theories are known to\nbe reduced to the standard descriptions by introducing appropriately\nparameterized generalized metric and by applying suitably chosen section\nconditions. We generalize this development to non-geometric backgrounds by\nutilizing dual fields pertinent to non-geometric fluxes. We introduce different\nparameterizations for the generalized metric, in terms of the conventional\nsupergravity fields or the dual fields. Under certain simplifying assumptions,\nwe construct new effective action for non-geometric backgrounds. We then obtain\nthe non-geometric backgrounds sourced by exotic branes. From them, we construct\ntheir $U$-duality monodromy matrices. The charge of exotic branes obtained from\nthese monodromy matrices agrees perfectly with the charge obtained from the\nnon-geometric flux integral.\n", "  A high-energy muon collider scenario require a \"final cooling\" system that\nreduces transverse emittance by a factor of ~10 while allowing longitudinal\nemittance increase. The baseline approach has low-energy transverse cooling\nwithin high-field solenoids, with strong longitudinal heating. This approach\nand its recent simulation are discussed. Alternative approaches which more\nexplicitly include emittance exchange are also presented. Round-to-flat beam\ntransform, transverse slicing, and longitudinal bunch coalescence are possible\ncomponents of an alternative approach. Wedge-based emittance exchange could\nprovide much of the required transverse cooling with longitudinal heating.\nLi-lens and quadrupole focusing systems could also provide much of the required\nfinal cooling.\n", "  To obtain fermionic quasinormal modes, the Dirac equation for two types of\nblack holes is investigated. For the first type of black hole, the quasinormal\nmodes have continuous spectrum with negative imaginary part that provides the\nstability of black hole geometry. For the second type of the black hole, the\nquasinormal modes have discrete spectrum and are completely imaginary. This\ntype of the black hole appears to be stable for arbitrary masses of fermion\nfield perturbations.\n", "  We present an in-depth study of masses and decays of excited scalar and\npseudoscalar $\\bar{q}q$ states in the Extended Linear Sigma Model (eLSM). The\nmodel also contains ground-state scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector\nmesons. The main objective is to study the consequences of the hypothesis that\nthe $f_0(1790)$ resonance, observed a decade ago by the BES Collaboration and\nrecently by LHCb, represents an excited scalar quarkonium. In addition we also\nanalyse the possibility that the new $a_0(1950)$ resonance, observed recently\nby BABAR, may also be an excited scalar state. Both hypotheses receive\njustification in our approach although there appears to be some tension between\nthe simultaneous interpretation of $f_0(1790)$/$a_0(1950)$ and pseudoscalar\nmesons $\\eta(1295)$, $\\pi(1300)$, $\\eta(1440)$ and $K(1460)$ as excited\n$\\bar{q}q$ states.\n", "  We formulate a Euclidean theory of edge length dynamics based on a notion of\nRicci curvature on graphs with variable edge lengths. In order to write an\nexplicit form for the discrete analog of the Einstein-Hilbert action, we\nrequire that the graph should either be a tree or that all its cycles should be\nsufficiently long. The infinite regular tree with all edge lengths equal is an\nexample of a graph with constant negative curvature, providing a connection\nwith $p$-adic AdS/CFT, where such a tree takes the place of anti-de Sitter\nspace. We compute simple correlators of the operator holographically dual to\nedge length fluctuations. This operator has dimension equal to the dimension of\nthe boundary, and it has some features in common with the stress tensor.\n", "  Transport surrounding is full of all kinds of fields, like particle\npotential, external potential. Under these conditions, how elements work and\nhow position and momentum redistribute in the diffusion? For enriching the Fick\nlaw in ordinary, nonequilibrium statistics physics need to be used to\ndisintegrate the complex process. This study attempts to discuss the particle\ntransport in the one-dimensional channel under external potential fields. Two\ntype of potentials, potential well and barrier do not change the potential in\ntotal, are built during the diffusion process. There are quite distinct\nphenomena because of different one-dimensional periodic potentials. We\nmeticulously explore reasons about why external potential field impacts\ntransport by the subsection and statistics method. Besides, one of the\nevidences of Maxwell velocity distribution is confirmed in assumption of local\nequilibrium. In addition, we have also investigated the influence of\ntemperature and concentration to the collective diffusion coefficient, by a\nvariety of external force, attaching thermodynamics analyze to these opposite\nphenomena. So simply is this model that the most valuable point may be an idea,\nwhich relating flux to sectional statistics of position and momentum could be\nreferenced in similar transport problems.\n", "  The B\\\"acklund transformation (BT) for the \"good\" Boussinesq equation and its\nsuperposition principles are presented and applied. Unlike many other standard\nintegrable equations, the Boussinesq equation does not have a strictly\nalgebraic superposition principle for 2 BTs, but it does for 3. We present\nassociated lattice systems. Applying the BT to the trivial solution generates\nstandard solitons but also what we call \"merging solitons\" --- solutions in\nwhich two solitary waves (with related speeds) merge into a single one. We use\nthe superposition principles to generate a variety of interesting solutions,\nincluding superpositions of a merging soliton with $1$ or $2$ regular solitons,\nand solutions that develop a singularity in finite time which then disappears\nat some later finite time. We prove a Wronskian formula for the solutions\nobtained by applying a general sequence of BTs on the trivial solution.\nFinally, we show how to obtain the standard conserved quantities of the\nBoussinesq equation from the BT, and how the hierarchy of local symmetries\nfollows in a simple manner from the superposition principle for 3 BTs.\n", "  Faraday tomography allows astronomers to probe the distribution of magnetic\nfield along the line of sight (LOS), but that can be achieved only after\nFaraday spectrum is interpreted. However, the interpretation is not\nstraightforward, mainly because Faraday spectrum is complicated due to\nturbulent magnetic field; it ruins the one-to-one relation between the Faraday\ndepth and the physical depth, and appears as many small-scale features in\nFaraday spectrum. In this paper, employing \"simple toy models\" for the magnetic\nfield, we describe numerically as well as analytically the characteristic\nproperties of Faraday spectrum. We show that Faraday spectrum along \"multiple\nloss\" can be used to extract the global properties of magnetic field.\nSpecifically, considering face-on spiral galaxies and modeling turbulent\nmagnetic field as a random field with single coherence length, we numerically\ncalculate Faraday spectrum along a number of LOSs and its shape-characterizing\nparameters, that is, the moments. When multiple LOSs cover a region of $\\gtrsim\n(10\\ {\\rm coherence\\ length)^2}$, the shape of Faraday spectrum becomes smooth\nand the shape-characterizing parameters are well specified. With the Faraday\nspectrum constructed as a sum of Gaussian functions with different means and\nvariances, we analytically show that the parameters are expressed in terms of\nthe regular and turbulent components of LOS magnetic field and the coherence\nlength. We also consider the turbulent magnetic field modeled with power-law\nspectrum, and study how the magnetic field is revealed in Faraday spectrum. Our\nwork suggests a way toward obtaining the information of magnetic field from\nFaraday tomography study.\n", "  With the start of the Gaia era, the time has come to address the major\nchallenge of deriving the star formation history and evolution of the disk of\nour MilkyWay. Here we review our present knowledge of the outer regions of the\nMilky Way disk population. Its stellar content, its structure and its dynamical\nand chemical evolution are summarized, focussing on our lack of understanding\nboth from an observational and a theoretical viewpoint. We describe the\nunprecedented data that Gaia and the upcoming ground-based spectroscopic\nsurveys will provide in the next decade. More in detail, we quantify the expect\naccuracy in position, velocity and astrophysical parameters of some of the key\ntracers of the stellar populations in the outer Galactic disk. Some insights on\nthe future capability of these surveys to answer crucial and fundamental issues\nare discussed, such as the mechanisms driving the spiral arms and the warp\nformation. Our Galaxy, theMilkyWay, is our cosmological laboratory for\nunderstanding the process of formation and evolution of disk galaxies. What we\nlearn in the next decades will be naturally transferred to the extragalactic\ndomain.\n", "  We show that in certain one-dimensional spin chains with open boundary\nconditions, the edge spins retain memory of their initial state for very long\ntimes. The long coherence times do not require disorder, only an ordered phase.\nIn the integrable Ising and XYZ chains, the presence of a strong zero mode\nmeans the coherence time is infinite, even at infinite temperature. When Ising\nis perturbed by interactions breaking the integrability, the coherence time\nremains exponentially long in the perturbing couplings. We show that this is a\nconsequence of an edge \"almost\" strong zero mode that almost commutes with the\nHamiltonian. We compute this operator explicitly, allowing us to estimate\naccurately the plateau value of edge spin autocorrelator.\n", "  We formulate the $N$ soliton solution of the Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa equation\nthat is determined by purely algebraic equations. Derivation is based on the\nmatrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. We give examples of one soliton solution that\ninclude smooth soliton, bursting soliton, and loop type soliton. In addition,\nwe give an explicit example for two soliton solution that blows up in a finite\ntime.\n", "  We present the results of combined deep Keck/NIRC2, HST/WFC3 near-infrared\nand Herschel far infrared observations of an extremely star forming dusty\nlensed galaxy identified from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area\nSurvey (H-ATLAS J133542.9+300401). The galaxy is gravitationally lensed by a\nmassive WISE identified galaxy cluster at $z\\sim1$. The lensed galaxy is\nspectroscopically confirmed at $z=2.685$ from detection of $\\rm {CO (1\n\\rightarrow 0)}$ by GBT and from detection of $\\rm {CO (3 \\rightarrow 2)}$\nobtained with CARMA. We use the combined spectroscopic and imaging observations\nto construct a detailed lens model of the background dusty star-forming galaxy\n(DSFG) which allows us to study the source plane properties of the target. The\nbest-fit lens model provide magnification of $\\mu_{\\rm star}=2.10\\pm0.11$ and\n$\\mu_{\\rm dust}=2.02\\pm0.06$ for the stellar and dust components respectively.\nMulti-band data yields a magnification corrected star formation rate of\n$1900(\\pm200)\\,M_{\\odot}{\\rm yr^{-1}}$ and stellar mass of\n$6.8_{-2.7}^{+0.9}\\times10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$ consistent with a main sequence of\nstar formation at $z\\sim2.6$. The CO observations yield a molecular gas mass of\n$8.3(\\pm1.0)\\times10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$, similar to the most massive star-forming\ngalaxies, which together with the high star-formation efficiency are\nresponsible for the intense observed star formation rates. The lensed DSFG has\na very short gas depletion time scale of $\\sim40$ Myr. The high stellar mass\nand small gas fractions observed indicate that the lensed DSFG likely has\nalready formed most of its stellar mass and could be a progenitor of the most\nmassive elliptical galaxies found in the local Universe.\n", "  Recent findings suggest Mars may have been a clement environment for the\nemergence of life, and may even have compared favorably to Earth in this\nregard. These findings have revived interest in the hypothesis that\nprebiotically important molecules or even nascent life may have formed on Mars\nand been transferred to Earth. UV light plays a key role in prebiotic\nchemistry. Characterizing the early Martian surface UV environment is key to\nunderstanding how Mars compares to Earth as a venue for prebiotic chemistry.\n  Here, we present two-stream multi-layer calculations of the UV surface\nradiance on Mars at 3.9 Ga, to constrain the surface UV environment as a\nfunction of atmospheric state. We explore a wide range of atmospheric\npressures, temperatures and compositions, corresponding to the diversity of\nMartian atmospheric states consistent with available constraints. We include\nthe effects of clouds and dust. We calculate dose rates to quantify the effect\nof different atmospheric states on UV-sensitive prebiotic chemistry.\n  We find that for normative clear-sky CO2-H2O atmospheres, the UV environment\non young Mars is comparable to young Earth. This similarity is robust to\nmoderate cloud cover: thick clouds ($\\tau$>100) are required to significantly\naffect the Martian UV environment, because cloud absorption is degenerate with\natmospheric CO2. On the other hand, absorption from SO2, H2S, and dust is\nnondegenerate with CO2, meaning if they can build up to high levels, surface UV\nfluence will be suppressed. These absorbers have spectrally variable\nabsorption, meaning that their presence affects prebiotic pathways in different\nways. In particular, high SO2 environments may admit UV fluence that favors\npathways conducive to abiogenesis over pathways unfavorable to it. However,\nbetter measurements of the spectral quantum yields of these pathways are\nrequired to evaluate this hypothesis definitively.\n", "  We propose a marginally stable optical resonator suitable for atom\ninterferometry. The resonator geometry is based on two flat mirrors at the\nfocal planes of a lens that produces the large beam waist required to\ncoherently manipulate cold atomic ensembles. Optical gains of about 100 are\nachievable using optics with part-per-thousand losses. The resulting power\nbuild-up will allow for enhanced coherent manipulation of the atomic\nwavepackets such as large separation beamsplitters. We study the effect of\nlongitudinal misalignments and assess the robustness of the resonator in terms\nof intensity and phase profiles of the intra-cavity field. We also study how to\nimplement atom interferometry based on Large Momentum Transfer Bragg\ndiffraction in such a cavity.\n", "  Considering the zero 't Hooft coupling limit of ${\\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills\ntheory, the exact spectrum of all single-trace operators can be accessed in\nterms of the underlying $so(2,4)$ character. This makes it possible in turn to\ncompute the one-loop free energy of the tensionless type IIB string theory in\nAdS$_5\\times$S$^5$ background, with help of the recently developed method of\ncharacter integral representation of zeta function (CIRZ). We calculate first\nthe one-loop free energy of the string states in the $(p-1)$-th Regge\ntrajectory and find the result to be $p$ times the free energy of a single\n${\\cal N}=4$ Maxwell multiplet. The full one-loop free energy is hence\nproportional to the divergent series $\\sum_{p=2}^\\infty p\\,$. The divergence\narises as a result of interrupting the regularization procedure in an\nintermediate stage. With a reorganization of states, we extract the finite part\nof free energy after summing over the Regge trajectories. This way gives us a\nfinite result which is minus of the free energy of the ${\\cal N}=4$ multiplet.\nHence, this bulk one-loop result matches the -1 term in the $N^2-1$ factor of\nthe boundary result.\n", "  The spatial distribution of charge and magnetization within the nucleon\n(proton and neutron) is encoded in the elastic electromagnetic form factors\n$G_E^{(p,n)}$ and $G_M^{(p,n)}$. These form factors have been precisely\nmeasured utilizing elastic electron scattering, and the combination of proton\nand neutron form factors allows for the separation of the up- and down-quark\ncontributions to the nucleon form factors. We expand on our original analyses\nand extract the up- and down-quark contributions to the nucleon electromagnetic\nform factors from worldwide data with an emphasis on precise new data covering\nthe low-momentum region, which is sensitive to the large-scale structure of the\nnucleon. From these, we construct the flavor-separated Dirac and Pauli form\nfactors and their ratios, and compare the results to recent extractions and\ntheoretical calculations and models.\n", "  We investigate a cavity quantum electrodynamic effect, where the alignment of\ntwo-dimensional freely rotating optical dipoles is driven by their collective\ncoupling to the cavity field. By exploiting the formal equivalence of a set of\nrotating dipoles with a polymer we calculate the partition function of the\ncoupled light-matter system and demonstrate it exhibits a second order phase\ntransition between a bunched state of isotropic orientations and a stretched\none with all the dipoles aligned. Such a transition manifests itself as an\nintensity-dependent shift of the polariton mode resonance. Our work, lying at\nthe crossroad between cavity quantum electrodynamics and quantum optomechanics,\nis a step forward in the on-going quest to understand how strong coupling can\nbe exploited to influence matter internal degrees of freedom.\n", "  We report Chandra X-ray observations and optical weak-lensing measurements\nfrom Subaru/Suprime-Cam images of the double galaxy cluster Abell 2465\n(z=0.245). The X-ray brightness data are fit to a beta-model to obtain the\nradial gas density profiles of the northeast (NE) and southwest (SW)\nsub-components, which are seen to differ in structure. We determine core radii,\ncentral temperatures, the gas masses within $r_{500c}$, and the total masses\nfor the broader NE and sharper SW components assuming hydrostatic equilibrium.\nThe central entropy of the NE clump is about two times higher than the SW.\nAlong with its structural properties, this suggests that it has undergone\nmerging on its own. The weak-lensing analysis gives virial masses for each\nsubstructure, which compare well with earlier dynamical results. The derived\nouter mass contours of the SW sub-component from weak lensing are more\nirregular and extended than those of the NE. Although there is a weak\nenhancement and small offsets between X-ray gas and mass centers from weak\nlensing, the lack of large amounts of gas between the two sub-clusters\nindicates that Abell 2465 is in a pre-merger state. A dynamical model that is\nconsistent with the observed cluster data, based on the FLASH program and the\nradial infall model, is constructed, where the subclusters currently separated\nby ~1.2Mpc are approaching each other at ~2000km/s and will meet in ~0.4Gyr.\n", "  This contribution presents a novel bunch current measurement system based on\nan ultra-fast photodetector and a high-speed digitizer at Hefei Light Source II\n(HLS II). In order to achieve bunch-by-bunch resolution, the sampling rate of\nthe system is nearly 225 GS/s via a dedicated equivalent sampling algorithm.\nAccording to preliminary tests of daily operation mode and single-bunch mode,\nthe root-mean-square (rms) of current relative error distribution is 1.03%,\nwhich illustrates the new system satisfies requirements for high-precision\nbunch current measurement. In addition, experiment results of \"HLS\" Morse code\nfill pattern mode demonstrate this system also could be a convenient and robust\ntool for beam top-up mode in the future.\n", "  A search is presented for supersymmetry in all-hadronic events with missing\ntransverse momentum and tagged top quarks. The data sample was collected by the\nCMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\ninverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV. Search regions are defined using the properties of reconstructed jets, the\nmultiplicity of bottom and top quark candidates, and an imbalance in transverse\nmomentum. With no statistically significant excess of events observed beyond\nthe expected contributions from the standard model, we set exclusion limits at\n95% confidence level on the masses of new particles in the context of\nsimplified models of direct and gluino-mediated top squark production. For\ndirect top squark production with decays to a top quark and a neutralino, top\nsquark masses up to 740 GeV and neutralino masses up to 240 GeV are excluded.\nGluino masses up to 1550 GeV and neutralino masses up to 900 GeV are excluded\nfor a gluino-mediated production case, where each of the pair-produced gluinos\ndecays to a top-antitop quark pair and a neutralino.\n", "  Binary neutron star mergers are plausible progenitor candidates for short\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs); however, a detailed explanation of their central\nengine is still lacking. The annihilation of neutrino pairs has been proposed\nas one of the possible powering mechanisms. We present calculations of the\nenergy and momentum deposition operated by neutrino pair annihilation above\nmerger remnants. Starting from the results of a detailed, three-dimensional\nsimulation of the aftermath of a binary neutron star merger, we compute the\ndeposition rates over a time scale comparable to the life time of the disk ($t\n\\approx 0.4$ s), assuming a long-lived massive neutron star (MNS). We model\nneutrino emission using a spectral leakage scheme and compute the neutrino\nannihilation rates using a ray-tracing algorithm. We find that the presence of\nthe MNS increases the energy deposition rate by a factor $\\sim 2$, mainly due\nto the annihilation of radiation coming from the MNS with radiation coming from\nthe disk. We compute the impact of relativistic effects and discover that,\ndespite they can significantly change the local rate intensity, the\nvolume-integrated results are only marginally decreased. The cumulative\ndeposited energy, extrapolated to 1 sec, is $\\approx 2.2 \\times 10^{49} \\, {\\rm\nerg}$. A comparison with the inferred short GRB energetics reveals that in most\ncases this energy is not large enough, even assuming small jet opening angles\nand a long-lived MNS. Significantly more intense neutrino luminosities (a\nfactor ~5-10 larger) are required to explain most of the observed short GRB. We\nconclude that it is unlikely that neutrino pair annihilation can explain the\ncentral engine of short GRBs alone.\n", "  The edge diffraction of a homogeneously polarized light beam is studied\ntheoretically based on the paraxial optics and Fresnel-Kirchhoff approximation,\nand the dependence of the diffracted beam pattern of the incident beam\npolarization is predicted. If the incident beam is circularly polarized, the\ntrajectory of the diffracted beam centre of gravity experiences a small angular\ndeviation from the geometrically expected direction. The deviation is parallel\nto the screen edge and reverses the sign with the polarization handedness; it\nis explicitly calculated for the case of a Gaussian incident beam with plane\nwavefront. This effect is a manifestation of the spin-orbit interaction of\nlight and can be interpreted as a revelation of the internal spin energy flow\nimmanent in circularly polarized beams. It also exposes the vortex character of\nthe weak longitudinal field component associated with the circularly polarized\nincident beam.\n", "  Beam tracking software for accelerators typically falls into two categories:\nfast envelope simulations limited to linear beam optics, and slower\nmultiparticle simulations that can model nonlinear effects. To find a middle\nground between these approaches, we introduce virtual coordinates in position\nand momentum which have a cross-dependency (i.e. p=f(x) where x is an initial\nposition and p* is a virtual projection of momentum onto the position axis).\nThis technique approximates multiparticle simulations with a significant\nreduction in calculation cost.\n", "  We demonstrate an easy to manufacture, 25 mm long ultra-stable optical\nreference cavity for transportable photonic microwave generation systems.\nEmploying a rigid holding geometry that is first-order insensitive to the\nsqueezing force and a cavity geometry that improves the thermal noise limit at\nroom temperature, we observe a laser phase noise that is nearly thermal noise\nlimited for three frequency decades (1 Hz to 1 kHz offset) and supports 10 GHz\ngeneration with phase noise near -100 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset and <-173 dBc/Hz\nfor all offsets >600 Hz. The fractional frequency stability reaches\n$2\\times10^{-15}$ at 0.1 s of averaging.\n", "  A statistical experiment on a von Neumann algebra is a parametrized family of\nnormal states on the algebra. This paper introduces the concept of minimal\nsufficiency for statistical experiments in such operator algebraic situations.\nWe define equivalence relations of statistical experiments indexed by a common\nparameter set by completely positive or Schwarz coarse-graining and show that\nany statistical experiment is equivalent to a minimal sufficient statistical\nexperiment unique up to normal isomorphism of outcome algebras. We also\nestablish the relationship between the minimal sufficiency condition for\nstatistical experiment in this paper and those for subalgebra. These concepts\nand results are applied to the concatenation relation for completely positive\nchannels with general input and outcome von Neumann algebras. In the case of\nthe quantum-classical channel corresponding to the positive-operator valued\nmeasure (POVM), we prove the equivalence of the minimal sufficient condition\npreviously proposed by the author and that in this paper. We also give a\ncharacterization of the discreteness of a POVM up to postprocessing equivalence\nin terms of the corresponding quantum-classical channel.\n", "  In this letter, we consider dark matter annihilation in the gravitational\nfield of noncommutative black holes. At final stage of evaporation, we\nhypothesize the existence of a thermal equilibrium state composed of a burning\nblack hole relics fueled by dark matter accretion.\n", "  We calculate the Josephson current between two one-dimensional (1D) nanowires\noriented along $x$ with proximity induced $s$-wave superconducting pairing and\nseparated by a narrow dielectric barrier in the presence of both Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction (SOI) characterized by strength $\\alpha$ and Zeeman\nfields ($h$ along $\\hat z$ and ${\\bf B}$ in the $x-y$ plane). We formulate a\ngeneral method for computing the Andreev bound states energy which allows us to\nobtain analytical expressions for the energy of these states in several\nasymptotic cases. We find that in the absence of the magnetic fields the energy\ngap between the Andreev bound states decreases with increasing Rashba SOI\nconstant leading eventually to touching of the levels. In the absence of Rashba\nSOI, the Andreev bound states depend on the magnetic fields and display\noscillatory behavior with orientational angle of B leading to magneto-Josephson\neffect. We also present analytic expressions for the dc Josephson current\ncharting out their dependence on ${\\bf B}$, $h$, and $\\alpha$. We demonstrate\nthe existence of finite spin-Josephson current in these junctions in the\npresence of external magnetic fields and provide analytic expressions for its\ndependence on $\\alpha$, $\\bf B$ and $h$. Finally, we study the AC Josephson\neffect in the presence of the SOI (for $|{\\bf B}|=h=0$) and an external\nradiation and show that the width of the resulting Shapiro steps in such a\nsystem can be tuned by varying $\\alpha$. We discuss experiments which can test\nour theoretical results.\n", "  Fractal scale-free networks are empirically known to exhibit disassortative\ndegree mixing. It is, however, not obvious whether a negative degree\ncorrelation between nearest neighbor nodes makes a scale-free network fractal.\nHere we examine the possibility that disassortativity in complex networks is\nthe origin of fractality. To this end, maximally disassortative (MD) networks\nare prepared by rewiring edges while keeping the degree sequence of an initial\nuncorrelated scale-free network that is guaranteed to become fractal by\nrewiring edges. Our results show that most of MD networks with different\ntopologies are not fractal, which demonstrates that disassortativity does not\ncause the fractal property of networks. In addition, we suggest that fractality\nof scale-free networks requires a long-range repulsive correlation in similar\ndegrees.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the charging effects in single and double\nlayer black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) with lateral sizes of 2 nm and 3\nnm. We demonstrate that the charging of BPQDs are able to store up to an\n$N_{max}$ electron (that depends on the lateral size and number of layers in\nthe QD), after which structural instabilities arises. For example, 3 nm wide\nhydrogen-passivated single layer BPQDs can hold a maximum of 16 electrons, and\nan additional electron causes the expelling of hydrogen atoms from the QD\nborders. We also calculated the additional energy ($E_A$) spectrum. For single\nlayer QDs with 2 and 3 nm of lateral sizes, the average $E_A$ is around 0.4 eV\nand 0.3 eV, respectively. For double layer QDs with the same sizes, the average\n$E_A$ is around 0.25 eV and 0.2 eV, respectively.\n", "  Due to the exponential complexity of the resources required by quantum state\ntomography (QST), people are interested in approaches towards identifying\nquantum states which require less effort and time. In this paper, we provide a\ntailored and efficient method for reconstructing mixed quantum states up to\n$12$ (or even more) qubits from an incomplete set of observables subject to\nnoises. Our method is applicable to any pure or nearly pure state $\\rho$, and\ncan be extended to many states of interest in quantum information processing,\nsuch as multi-particle entangled $W$ state, GHZ state and cluster states that\nare matrix product operators of low dimensions. The method applies the quantum\ndensity matrix constraints to a quantum compressive sensing optimization\nproblem, and exploits a modified Quantum Alternating Direction Multiplier\nMethod (Quantum-ADMM) to accelerate the convergence. Our algorithm takes $8,35$\nand $226$ seconds respectively to reconstruct superposition state density\nmatrices of $10,11,12$ qubits with acceptable fidelity, using less than $1 \\%$\nof measurements of expectation. To our knowledge it is the fastest realization\nthat people can achieve using a normal desktop. We further discuss applications\nof this method using experimental data of mixed states obtained in an ion trap\nexperiment of up to $8$ qubits.\n", "  Mesonic and nucleon fluctuation effects are investigated in medium. We couple\nthe nucleon field to the $2+1$ flavor meson model and investigate the finite\ntemperature and density behavior of the system, in particular, the axial\nanomaly function. Somewhat contrary to earlier expectations we find that it\ntends to strengthen at finite density. At lower temperatures nucleon density\nfluctuations can cause a relative difference in the $U_A(1)$ axial anomaly of\nabout $20\\%$. This has important consequences on the mesonic spectra,\nespecially on the $\\eta-\\eta'$ system, as we observe no drop in the $\\eta'$\nmass as a function of the baryochemical potential, irrespective of the\ntemperature. Based on the details of chiral symmetry restoration, it is argued\nthat there has to be a competition between underlying QCD effects of the\nanomaly and fluctuations of the low energy hadronic degrees of freedom, and the\nfate of the $U_A(1)$ coefficient should be decided by taking into account both\neffects simultaneously.\n", "  We use quantum energy teleportation in the light-matter interaction as an\noperational means to create quantum field states that violate energy conditions\nand have negative local stress-energy densities. We show that the protocol is\noptimal in the sense that it scales in a way that saturates the quantum\ninterest conjecture.\n", "  We apply Monte Carlo projection to the radial velocity data set that Anglada\nEscude et al. (2016) use for the discovery of Proxima b. They find an upper\nlimit to the orbital eccentricity of 0.35. To investigate the eccentricity\nissue further, we calculate a suite of monovariate and bivariate densities o\neccentricity. After discarding apparent artifacts at eccentricity = 0 and = 1,\nwe find that eccentricity has a trimodal sampling distribution: three chimeras\nor types of orbit compatible with the RV data set. The three modes or peaks in\nthe density of eccentricity are located at eccentricity = 0.25, 0.75, and 0.95,\nwith relative weights 0.79, 0.10, and 0.11. Future RV observations will clarify\nwhich of the three chimeras represents the true eccentricity of Proxima b. The\nmost-likely estimate is eccentricity = 0.25, and our lower limit is\neccentricity = 0.025. Our strategic, long-term goal is to elevate the orbital\nanalyses of exoplanets to meet the challenges of sometimes complex probability\ndensity distributions.\n", "  In previous papers, [M1, M2], [M3], we proved the existence as well as\nregularity of a finite range decomposition for the resolvent $G_{\\alpha}\n(x-y,m^2) = ((-\\Delta)^{\\alpha\\over 2} + m^{2})^{-1} (x-y) $, for $0<\\alpha <2$\nand all real $m$, in the lattice ${\\bf Z}^{d}$ for dimension $d\\ge 2$. In this\npaper, which is a continuation of the previous one, we extend those results by\nproving the existence as well as regularity of a finite range decomposition for\nthe same resolvent but now on the lattice torus ${\\bf Z}^{d}/L^{N+1}{\\bf Z}^{d}\n$ for $d\\ge 2$ provided $m\\neq 0$ and $0<\\alpha <2$. We also prove\ndifferentiability and uniform continuity properties with respect to the\nresolvent parameter $m^{2}$. Here $L$ is any odd positive integer and $N\\ge 2$\nis any positive integer.\n", "  We present a practical classification scheme for the four-partite entangled\nstates under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC).\nBy transforming a four-partite state into a triple-state set composed of two\ntripartite and one bipartite states, the entanglement classification is reduced\nto the classification of tripartite and bipartite entanglements. This reduction\nmethod has the merit of involving only the linear constrains, and meanwhile\nproviding an insight into the entanglement character of the subsystems.\n", "  Dense suspensions can exhibit an abrupt change in their viscosity in response\nto increasing shear rate. The origin of this discontinuous shear thickening\n(DST) has been ascribed to the transformation of lubricated contacts to\nfrictional, particle-on-particle contacts. Recent research on the flowing and\njamming behavior of dense suspensions has explored the intersection of ideas\nfrom granular physics and Stokesian fluid dynamics to better understand this\ntransition from lubricated to frictional rheology. DST is reminiscent of\nclassical phase transitions, and a key question is how interactions between the\nmicroscopic constituents give rise to a macroscopic transition. In this paper,\nwe extend a formalism that has proven to be successful in understanding shear\njamming of dry grains to dense suspensions. Quantitative analysis of the\ncollective evolution of the contact-force network accompanying the DST\ntransition demonstrates clear changes in the distribution of microscopic\nvariables, and leads to the identification of an \"order parameter\"\ncharacterizing DST.\n", "  Topology changes in multi-phase fluid flows are difficult to model within a\ntraditional sharp interface theory. Diffuse interface models turn out to be an\nattractive alternative to model two-phase flows. Based on a\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model introduced by Abels, Garcke and Gr\\\"{u}n\n(Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 2012), which uses a volume averaged velocity,\nwe derive a diffuse interface model in a Hele-Shaw geometry, which in the case\nof non-matched densities, simplifies an earlier model of Lee, Lowengrub and\nGoodman (Phys. Fluids 2002). We recover the classical Hele-Shaw model as a\nsharp interface limit of the diffuse interface model. Furthermore, we show the\nexistence of weak solutions and present several numerical computations\nincluding situations with rising bubbles and fingering instabilities.\n", "  We have studied the scaling properties of the electromagnetic response\nfunctions of $^4$He and $^{12}$C nuclei computed by the Green's Function Monte\nCarlo approach, retaining only the one-body current contribution. Longitudinal\nand transverse scaling functions have been obtained in the relativistic and non\nrelativistic cases and compared to experiment for various kinematics. The\ncharacteristic asymmetric shape of the scaling function exhibited by data\nemerges in the calculations in spite of the non relativistic nature of the\nmodel. The results are consistent with scaling of zeroth, first and second\nkinds. Our analysis reveals a direct correspondence between the scaling and the\nnucleon-density response functions.\n", "  We present an interferometric technique for measuring ultra-small tilts. The\ninformation of a tilt in one of the mirrors of a modified Sagnac interferometer\nis carried by the phase difference between the counter propagating laser beams.\nUsing a small misalignment of the interferometer, orthogonal to the plane of\nthe tilt, a bimodal (or two-fringe) pattern is induced in the beam's transverse\npower distribution. By tracking the mean of such a distribution, using a split\ndetector, a sensitive measurement of the phase is performed. With 1.2 mW of\ncontinuous-wave laser power, the technique has a shot noise limited sensitivity\nof 56 frad/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$, and a measured noise floor of 200\nfrad/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$ for tilt frequencies above 2 Hz. A tilt of 200 frad\ncorresponds to a differential displacement of 4.0 fm in our setup. The novelty\nof the protocol relies on signal amplification due to the misalignment, and on\ngood performance at low frequencies. A noise floor of about 70\nprad/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$ is observed between 2 and 100 mHz.\n", "  Competition to bind microRNAs induces an effective positive crosstalk between\ntheir targets, therefore known as `competing endogenous RNAs' or ceRNAs. While\nsuch an effect is known to play a significant role in specific conditions,\nestimating its strength from data and, experimentally, in physiological\nconditions appears to be far from simple. Here we show that the susceptibility\nof ceRNAs to different types of perturbations affecting their competitors (and\nhence their tendency to crosstalk) can be encoded in quantities as intuitive\nand as simple to measure as correlation functions. We confirm this scenario by\nextensive numerical simulations and validate it by re-analyzing PTEN's\ncrosstalk pattern from TCGA breast cancer dataset. These results clarify the\nlinks between different quantities used to estimate the intensity of ceRNA\ncrosstalk and provide new keys to analyze transcriptional datasets and\neffectively probe ceRNA networks in silico.\n", "  According to the dS/CFT correspondence, correlators of fields generated\nduring a primordial de Sitter phase are constrained by three-dimensional\nconformal invariance. Using the properties of radially quantized conformal\nfield theories and the operator-state correspondence, we glean information on\nsome points. The Higuchi bound on the masses of spin-s states in de Sitter is a\ndirect consequence of reflection positivity in radially quantized CFT$_3$ and\nthe fact that scaling dimensions of operators are energies of states. The\npartial massless states appearing in de Sitter correspond from the boundary\nCFT$_3$ perspective to boundary states with highest weight for the conformal\ngroup. We discuss inflationary consistency relations and the role of asymptotic\nsymmetries which transform asymptotic vacua to new physically inequivalent\nvacua by generating long perturbation modes. We show that on the CFT$_3$ side,\nasymptotic symmetries have a nice quantum mechanics interpretation. For\ninstance, acting with the asymptotic dilation symmetry corresponds to evolving\nstates forward (or backward) in \"time\" and the charge generating the asymptotic\nsymmetry transformation is the Hamiltonian itself. Finally, we investigate the\nsymmetries of anisotropic inflation and show that correlators of\nfour-dimensional free scalar fields can be reproduced in the dual picture by\nconsidering an isotropic three-dimensional boundary enjoying dilation symmetry,\nbut with a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the boundary stress-energy\nmomentum tensor.\n", "  We study the sensitivity to sub-GeV dark sectors of high energy ($ \\geq100$\nGeV) proton fixed target experiments such as the Main Injector and the future\nLong-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF). We focus on off-axis detectors since\nthey have been shown to be the ideal location to reduce the neutrino\nbackground. We consider MiniBooNE as an off-axis detector for the NuMI facility\nand a hypotetical detector for LBNF located 200 m away from the target and 6.5\ndegrees off-axis. We find that with the existing data, MiniBoone can explore\nnew regions of the parameter space for leptophobic dark forces in the 100 MeV-\nfew GeV mass range. The dedicated MiniBooNE run in beam dump mode would further\nimprove the reach for even lighter masses. Therefore, MiniBooNE has the\npotential to be one of the most sensitive probe of leptophobic dark forces for\nmasses between 1 MeV-10 GeV.\n", "  The volume inside a Ryu-Takayanagi surface has been conjectured to be related\nto the complexity of subregions of the boundary field theory. Here, we study\nthe behaviour of this volume analytically, when the entangling surface has a\nstrip geometry. We perform systematic expansions in the low and high\ntemperature regimes for AdS-Schwarzschild and RN-AdS black holes. In the latter\nregime, we point out spurious divergences that might occur due to the\nlimitations of a near horizon expansion. A similar analysis is performed for\nextremal black holes, and at large charge, we find that there might be some new\nfeatures of the volume as compared to the area. Finally, we numerically study a\nfour dimensional RN-AdS black hole in global AdS, the entangling surface being\na sphere. We find that the holographic complexity captures essentially the same\ninformation as the entanglement entropy, as far as phase transitions are\nconcerned.\n", "  We exploit recently developed topology-optimization techniques to design\ncomplex, wavelength-scale resonators for enhancing various nonlinear\n$\\chi^{(2)}$ and $\\chi^{(3)}$ frequency conversion processes. In particular, we\ndemonstrate aperiodic, multi-track ring resonators and 2D slab microcavities\nexhibiting long lifetimes $Q \\gtrsim 10^4$, small modal volumes $V \\gtrsim\n(\\lambda/2n)^3$, and among the largest nonlinear overlaps (a generalization of\nphase matching in large-etalon waveguides) possible, paving the way for\nefficient, compact, and wide-bandwdith integrated nonlinear devices.\n", "  We review possible mechanisms for energy transfer based on 'rare' or\n'non-perturbative' effects, in physical systems that present a many-body\nlocalized phenomenology. The main focus is on classical systems, with or\nwithout quenched disorder. For non-quantum systems, the breakdown of\nlocalization is usually not regarded as an issue, and we thus aim at\nidentifying the fastest channels for transport. Next, we contemplate the\npossibility of applying the same mechanisms in quantum systems, including\ndisorder free systems (e.g. Bose-Hubbard chain), disordered many-body localized\nsystems with mobility edges at energies below the edge, and strongly disordered\nlattice systems in $d>1$. For quantum mechanical systems, the relevance of\nthese considerations for transport is currently a matter of debate.\n", "  We consider the analytic calculation of a two-loop non-planar three-point\nfunction which contributes to the two-loop amplitudes for $t \\bar{t}$\nproduction and $\\gamma \\gamma$ production in gluon fusion through a massive\ntop-quark loop. All subtopology integrals can be written in terms of multiple\npolylogarithms over an irrational alphabet and we employ a new method for the\nintegration of the differential equations which does not rely on the\nrationalization of the latter. The top topology integrals, instead, in spite of\nthe absence of a massive three-particle cut, cannot be evaluated in terms of\nmultiple polylogarithms and require the introduction of integrals over complete\nelliptic integrals and polylogarithms. We provide one-fold integral\nrepresentations for the solutions and continue them analytically to all\nrelevant regions of the phase space in terms of real function, extracting all\nimaginary parts explicitly. The numerical evaluation of our expressions becomes\nstraightforward in this way.\n", "  We investigate the heat transport through a rare earth multilayer system\ncomposed of Yttrium (Y), Dysprosium (Dy) and Niobium (Nb) by ultrafast X-ray\ndiffraction. This is an example of a complex heat flow problem on the\nnanoscale, where several different quasi-particles carry the heat. The Bragg\npeak positions of each layer represent layer-specific thermometers that measure\nthe energy flow through the sample after excitation of the Y top-layer with\nfs-laser pulses. In an experiment-based analytic solution to the nonequilibrium\nheat transport problem, we derive the individual contributions of the spins and\nthe coupled electron-lattice system to the heat conduction. The full\ncharacterization of the spatiotemporal energy flow at different starting\ntemperatures reveals that the spin excitations of antiferromagnetic Dy speed up\nthe heat transport into the Dy layer at low temperatures, whereas the heat\ntransport through this layer and further into the Y and Nb layers underneath is\nslowed down. The experimental findings are compared to the solution of the heat\nequation using macroscopic temperature-dependent material parameters without\nseparation of spin- and phonon contributions to the heat. We explain, why the\nsimulated energy density matches our experiment-based derivation of the heat\ntransport, although the simulated thermoelastic strain in this simulation is\nnot even in qualitative agreement.\n", "  Since penicillin was discovered about 90 years ago, we have become used to\nusing drugs to eradicate unwanted pathogenic cells. However, using drugs to\nkill bacteria, viruses or cancer cells has the serious side effect of selecting\nfor mutant types that survive the drug attack. A key question therefore is how\none could eradicate as many cells as possible for a given acceptable risk of\ndrug resistance evolution. We address this general question in a model of drug\nresistance evolution in spatial drug gradients, which recent experiments and\ntheories have suggested as key drivers of drug resistance. Importantly, our\nmodel takes into account the influence of convection, resulting for instance\nfrom blood flow. Using stochastic simulations, we study the fates of individual\nresistance mutations and quantify the trade-off between the killing of\nwild-type cells and the rise of resistance mutations: shallow gradients and\nconvection into the antibiotic region promote wild-type death, at the cost of\nincreasing the establishment probability of resistance mutations. We can\nexplain these observed trends by modeling the adaptation process as a branching\nrandom walk. Our analysis reveals that the trade-off between death and\nadaptation depends on the relative length scales of the spatial drug gradient\nand random dispersal, and the strength of convection. Our results show that\nconvection can have a momentous effect on the rate of establishment of new\nmutations, and may heavily impact the efficiency of antibiotic treatment.\n", "  Time delay in general leads to instability in some systems, while a specific\nfeedback with delay can control fluctuated motion in nonlinear deterministic\nsystems to a stable state. In this paper, we consider a non-stationary\nstochastic process, i.e., a random walk and observe its diffusion phenomenon\nwith time delayed feedback. Surprisingly, the diffusion coefficient decreases\nwith increasing the delay time. We analytically illustrate this suppression of\ndiffusion by using stochastic delay differential equations and justify the\nfeasibility of this suppression by applying the time-delay feedback to a\nmolecular dynamics model.\n", "  The concept of a controlled flow of a dynamical system, especially when the\ncontrolling process feeds information back about the system, is of central\nimportance in control engineering. In this paper we build on the ideas\npresented by Bouten and van Handel (L. Bouten, R. van Handel, \"On the\nseparation principle of quantum control\", in Quantum Stochastics and\nInformation: Statistics, Filtering and Control, World Scientific, 2008) and\ndevelop a general theory of quantum feedback. We elucidate the relationship\nbetween the controlling processes $Z$ and the measured process $Y$, and to this\nend make a distinction between what we call the input picture and the output\npicture. We should that the input-output relations for the noise fields have\nadditional terms not present in the standard theory, but that the relationship\nbetween the control processes and measured processes themselves are internally\nconsistent - we do this for the two main cases of quadrature measurement and\nphoton-counting measurement. The theory is general enough to include a\nmodulating filter which processes the measurement readout $Y$ before returning\nto the system. This opens up the prospect of applying very general engineering\nfeedback control techniques to open quantum systems in a systematic manner, and\nwe consider a number of specific modulating filter problems. Finally, we give a\nbrief argument as to why most of the rules for making instantaneous feedback\nconnections (J. Gough, M.R. James, \"Quantum Feedback Networks: Hamiltonian\nFormulation\", Commun. Math. Phys., 287, 1109, 2009) ought to apply for\ncontrolled dynamical networks as well.\n", "  When a horizontal resistive wire is heated up to the boiling point in a\nsubcooled liquid bath, some vapor bubbles nucleate on its surface. Traditional\nnucleate boiling theory predicts that bubbles generated from active nucleate\nsites, grow up and depart from the heating surface due to buoyancy and inertia.\nHowever, we observed here a different behavior: the bubbles slide along the\nheated wire. In this situation, unexpected regimes are observed; from the\nsimple sliding motion to bubble clustering. We noticed that bubbles could\nrapidly change their moving direction and may also interact. Finally, we\npropose an interpretation for both the attraction between the bubbles and the\nwire and for the motion of the bubbles on the wire in term of Marangoni\neffects.\n", "  We present measurements of the Electronic Spin Resonance (ESR) of Nitrogen\nVacancy (NV) centers in diamonds that are levitating in a ring Paul trap under\nvacuum. We observe ESR spectra of NV centers embedded in micron-sized diamonds\nat vacuum pressures down to $2\\times 10^{-1}$ mbar, limited by the green laser\nheating of the diamond. We also observe the NV photoluminescence at vacuum\npressures down to $10^{-2}$ mbar and discuss the steps required to control the\nNV spin under ultra-high vacuum.\n", "  Future galaxy surveys require realistic mock catalogues to understand and\nquantify systematics in order to make precise cosmological measurements. We\npresent a halo lightcone catalogue and halo occupation distribution (HOD)\ngalaxy catalogue built using the Millennium-XXL (MXXL) simulation. The halo\ncatalogue covers the full sky, extending to z = 2 with a mass resolution of\n~1e11 Msun/h . We use this to build a galaxy catalogue, which has an r-band\nmagnitude limit of r < 20.0, with a median redshift of z~0.2. A Monte Carlo HOD\nmethod is used to assign galaxies to the halo lightcone catalogue, and we\nevolve the HODs to reproduce a target luminosity function; by construction, the\nluminosity function of galaxies in the mock is in agreement with the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) at low redshifts and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly\n(GAMA) survey at high redshifts. A Monte Carlo method is used to assign a\n0.1(g-r) colour to each galaxy, and the colour distribution of galaxies at\ndifferent redshifts agrees with measurements from GAMA. The clustering of\ngalaxies in the mock for galaxies in different magnitude and redshift bins is\nin good agreement with measurements from SDSS and GAMA, and the\ncolour-dependent clustering is in reasonable agreement. We show that the baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) can be measured in the mock catalogue, and the\nredshift space distortions (RSDs) are in agreement with measurements from SDSS,\nillustrating that this catalogue will be useful for upcoming surveys.\n", "  The relative phase of the order parameters in the collision of two\ncondensates can influence the outcome of their collision in the case of weak\ncoupling. With increasing interaction strength however, the initially\nindependent phases of the two order parameters in the colliding partners\nquickly become phase locked, as the strong coupling favors an overall phase\nrigidity of the entire condensate, and upon their separation the emerging\nsuperfluid fragments become entangled.\n", "  We study the semi-discrete directed polymer model introduced by O'Connell-Yor\nin its stationary regime, based on our previous work on the stationary\n$q$-totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ($q$-TASEP) using a two-sided\n$q$-Whittaker process. We give a formula for the free energy distribution of\nthe polymer model in terms of Fredholm determinant and show that the universal\nKPZ stationary distribution appears in the long time limit. We also consider\nthe limit to the stationary KPZ equation and discuss the connections with\npreviously found formulas.\n", "  In this paper, we design, fabricate and experimentally characterize a\nbroadband acoustic right-angle bend device in air. Perforated panels with\nvarious hole-sizes are used to construct the bend structure. Both the simulated\nand the experimental results verify that acoustic beam can be rotated\neffectively through the acoustic bend in a wide frequency range. This model may\nhave potential applications in some areas such as sound absorption and acoustic\ndetection in pipeline.\n", "  We present a historical review of Einstein's 1917 paper 'Cosmological\nConsiderations in the General Theory of Relativity' to mark the centenary of a\nkey work that set the foundations of modern cosmology. We find that the paper\nfollowed as a natural next step after Einstein's development of the general\ntheory of relativity and that the work offers many insights into his thoughts\non relativity, astronomy and cosmology. Our review includes a description of\nthe observational and theoretical background to the paper; a\nparagraph-by-paragraph guided tour of the work; a discussion of Einstein's\nviews of issues such as the relativity of inertia, the curvature of space and\nthe cosmological constant. Particular attention is paid to little-known aspects\nof the paper such as Einstein's failure to test his model against observation,\nhis failure to consider the stability of the model and a mathematical oversight\nconcerning his interpretation of the role of the cosmological constant. We\nrecall the response of theorists and astronomers to Einstein's cosmology in the\ncontext of the alternate models of the universe proposed by Willem de Sitter,\nAlexander Friedman and Georges Lemaitre. Finally, we describe the relevance of\nthe Einstein World in today's 'emergent' cosmologies.\n", "  We report generation of an ultrafast supercontinuum extending into the mid-\ninfrared in gas-filled single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (SR-PCF)\npumped by 1.7 $\\mu$m light from an optical parametric amplifier. The simple\nfiber structure offers shallow dispersion and flat transmission in the near and\nmid-infrared, enabling the generation of broadband spectra extending from 300\nnm to 3.1 $\\mu$m, with a total energy of a few $\\mu$J. In addition, we report\nthe emission of ultraviolet dispersive waves whose frequency can be tuned\nsimply by adjusting the pump wavelength. SR-PCF also provides an effective\nmeans of compressing and delivering tunable ultrafast pulses in the near and\nmid-infrared spectral regions.\n", "  For a family of Horndeski theories, formulated in terms of a generalized\nGalileon model, we study the integrability of the field equations in a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We are interested in point\ntransformations which leave invariant the field equations. Noether's theorem is\napplied to determine the conservation laws for a family of models that belong\nto the same general class. The cosmological scenarios with or without an extra\nperfect fluid with constant equation of state parameter are the two important\ncases of our study. \\ The De Sitter universe and ideal gas solutions are\nderived by using the invariant functions of the symmetry generators as a\ndemonstration of our result. Furthermore, we discuss the connection of the\ndifferent models under conformal transformations while we show that when the\nHorndeski theory reduces to a canonical field the same holds for the conformal\nequivalent theory. Finally we discuss how singular solutions provides\nnonsingular universes in a different frame and vice versa.\n", "  We study the role of finite size effects on a metallic critical behavior near\na q = 0 critical point and compare the results with the recent extensive\nquantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) study [Y. Schattner et al, PRX 6, 0231028]. This\nstudy found several features in both bosonic and fermionic responses, in\ndisagreement with the expected critical behavior with dynamical exponent z = 3.\nWe show that finite size effects are particularly strong for z = 3 criticality\nand give rise to a behavior different from that of an infinite system, over a\nwide range of momenta and frequencies. We argue that by taking finite size\neffects into account, the QMC results can be explained within z = 3 theory. Our\nresults also have implications for small interacting fermionic systems, such as\nmagnetic nanoparticles.\n", "  We study the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in\ncontinuous systems, in the sense of the convergence of the corresponding Gibbs\nmeasures. This is obtained by proving a local central limit theorem and a local\nlarge deviations principle. As an application we prove a formula due to\nLebowitz-Percus-Verlet. It gives mean square fluctuations of an extensive\nobservable, like the kinetic energy, in a classical micro canonical ensemble at\nfixed energy.\n", "  Photonic quantum technologies are on the verge of finding applications in\neveryday life with quantum cryptography and the quantum internet on the\nhorizon. Extensive research has been carried out to determine suitable quantum\nemitters and single epitaxial quantum dots are emerging as near-optimal sources\nof bright, on-demand, highly indistinguishable single photons and entangled\nphoton pairs. In order to build up quantum networks, it is now essential to\ninterface remote quantum emitters. However, this is still an outstanding\nchallenge, as the quantum states of dissimilar 'artificial atoms' have to be\nprepared on-demand with high fidelity, and the generated photons have to be\nmade indistinguishable in all possible degrees of freedom. Here, we overcome\nthis major obstacle and show an unprecedented two-photon interference\n(visibility of 51+/-5%) from remote strain-tunable GaAs quantum dots, emitting\non-demand photon-pairs. We achieve this result by exploiting for the first time\nthe full potential of the novel phonon-assisted two-photon excitation scheme,\nwhich allows for the generation of highly indistinguishable (visibility of\n71+/-9%) entangled photon-pairs (fidelity of 90+/-2%), it enables push-to\nbutton biexciton state preparation (fidelity of 80+/-2%) and it outperforms\nconventional resonant two-photon excitation schemes in terms of robustness\nagainst environmental decoherence. Our results mark an important milestone for\nthe practical realization of quantum repeaters and complex multi-photon\nentanglement experiments involving dissimilar artificial atoms.\n", "  The $SU(3)$ equation of state ($P(T),\\,s(T),\\,I(T)$) are calculated within\nthe Field Correlator Method both in the confined and the deconfined phases. The\nbasic dynamics in our approach is contained in the vacuum correlators, both of\nthe colorelectric (CE) and colormagnetic (CM) types, which ensure CE and CM\nconfinement below $T_c$ and CM confinement and Polyakov loops above $T_c$. The\nresulting values of $T_c$ and $P(T),\\,I(T)$, $s(T)$ are in good agreement with\nlattice measurements.\n", "  This paper studies the concept of power dissipation in infinite graphs and\nfractals associated with passive linear networks consisting of non-dissipative\nelements. In particular, we analyze the so-called Feynman-Sierpinski ladder, a\nfractal AC circuit motivated by Feynman's infinite ladder, that exhibits power\ndissipation and wave propagation for some frequencies. Power dissipation in\nthis circuit is obtained as a limit of quadratic forms, and the corresponding\npower dissipation measure associated with harmonic potentials is constructed.\nThe latter measure is proved to be continuous and singular with respect to an\nappropriate Hausdorff measure defined on the fractal dust of nodes of the\nnetwork.\n", "  Optical properties of the photonic crystal covered with a perforated metal\nfilm were investigated and the existence of the Fano-type resonances was shown.\nThe Fano resonances originate from the interaction between the optical Tamm\nstate and the waveguide modes of the photonic crystal. It manifests itself as a\nnarrow dip in a broad peak in the transmission spectrum related to the optical\nTamm state. The design of a sensor based on this Fano resonance that is\nsensitive to the change of the environment refractive index is suggested.\n", "  A domain wall in a magnet with easy-axis anisotropy is shown to harbor spin\nsuperfluid associated with its spontaneous breaking of the U(1) spin-rotational\nsymmetry. The spin superfluid is shown to have several topological properties,\nwhich are absent in conventional superfluids. First, the associated phase slips\ncreate and destroy skyrmions to obey the conservation of the total skyrmion\ncharge, which allows us to use a domain wall as a generator and detector of\nskyrmions. Secondly, the domain wall engenders the emergent magnetic flux for\nmagnons along its length, which are proportional to the spin supercurrent\nflowing through it, and thereby provides a way to manipulate magnons. Thirdly,\nthe spin supercurrent can be driven by the magnon current traveling across it\nowing to the spin transfer between the domain wall and magnons, leading to the\nmagnonic manipulation of the spin superfluid. The theory for superfluid spin\ntransport within the domain wall is confirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  We demonstrate viability of the one-loop neutrino mass mechanism within the\nframework of grand unification when the loop particles comprise scalar\nleptoquarks (LQs) and quarks of the matching electric charge. This mechanism\ncan be implemented in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models and\nrequires the presence of at least one LQ pair. The appropriate pairs for the\nneutrino mass generation via the up-type and down-type quark loops are\n$S_3$-$R_2$ and $S_{1,\\,3}$-$\\tilde{R}_2$, respectively. We consider two\nphenomenologically distinct regimes for the LQ masses in our analysis. First\nregime calls for very heavy LQs in the loop. It can be naturally realised with\nthe $S_{1,\\,3}$-$\\tilde{R}_2$ scenarios when the LQ masses are roughly between\n$10^{12}$ GeV and $5 \\times 10^{13}$ GeV. These lower and upper bounds\noriginate from experimental limits on partial proton decay lifetimes and\nperturbativity constraints, respectively. Second regime corresponds to the\ncollider accessible LQs in the neutrino mass loop. That option is viable for\nthe $S_3$-$\\tilde{R}_2$ scenario in the models of unification that we discuss.\nIf one furthermore assumes the presence of the type II see-saw mechanism there\nis an additional contribution from the $S_3$-$R_2$ scenario that needs to be\ntaken into account beside the type II see-saw contribution itself. We provide a\ncomplete list of renormalizable operators that yield necessary mixing of all\naforementioned LQ pairs using the language of $SU(5)$. We furthermore discuss\nseveral possible embeddings of this mechanism in $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ gauge\ngroups.\n", "  Achieving the highest precision for theoretical predictions at the LHC\nrequires the calculation of hard-scattering cross-sections that include\nperturbative QCD corrections up to (N)NNLO and electroweak (EW) corrections up\nto NLO. Parton distribution functions (PDFs) need to be provided with matching\naccuracy, which in the case of QED effects involves introducing the photon\nparton distribution of the proton, $x\\gamma(x,Q^2)$. In this work a\ndetermination of the photon PDF from fits to recent ATLAS measurements of\nhigh-mass Drell-Yan dilepton production at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV is presented. This\nanalysis is based on the xFitter framework, and has required improvements both\nin the APFEL program, to account for NLO QED effects, and in the aMCfast\ninterface to account for the photon-initiated contributions in the EW\ncalculations within MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The results are compared with other\nrecent QED fits and determinations of the photon PDF, consistent results are\nfound.\n", "  The discrete polymer model with random Boltzmann weights with homogeneous\ninverse gamma distribution, introduced by Sepp\\\"al\\\"ainen, is studied in the\ncase of a polymer with one fixed and one free end. The model with two fixed\nends has been integrated by Thiery and Le Doussal, using coordinate Bethe\nAnsatz techniques and an analytic-continuation prescription. The probability\ndistribution of the free energy has been obtained through the replica method,\neven though the moments of the partition sum do not exist at all orders due to\nthe fat tail in the distribution of Boltzmann weights. To extend this approach\nto the polymer with one free end, we argue that the contribution to the\npartition sums in the thermodynamic limit is localised on parity-invariant\nstring states. This situation is analogous to the case of the continuum polymer\nwith one free end, related to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation with flat\nboundary conditions and solved by Le Doussal and Calabrese. The expansion of\nthe generating function of the partition sum in terms of numbers of strings can\nalso be transposed to the log-gamma polymer model, with the induced Fredholm\ndeterminant structure. We derive the large-time limit of the rescaled\ncumulative distribution function, and relate it to the GOE Tracy--Widom\ndistribution. The derivation is conjectural in the sense that it assumes\ncompleteness of a family of string states (and expressions of their norms\nalready used in the fixed-end problem) and extends heuristically the order of\nmoments of the partition sum to the complex plane.\n", "  The regularity of earthquakes, their destructive power, and the nuisance of\nground vibration in urban environments, all motivate designs of defence\nstructures to lessen the impact of seismic and ground vibration waves on\nbuildings. Low frequency waves, in the range $1$ to $10$ Hz for earthquakes and\nup to a few tens of Hz for vibrations generated by human activities, cause a\nlarge amount of damage, or inconvenience, depending on the geological\nconditions they can travel considerable distances and may match the resonant\nfundamental frequency of buildings. The ultimate aim of any seismic\nmetamaterial, or any other seismic shield, is to protect over this entire range\nof frequencies, the long wavelengths involved, and low frequency, have meant\nthis has been unachievable to date.\n  Elastic flexural waves, applicable in the mechanical vibrations of thin\nelastic plates, can be designed to have a broad zero-frequency stop-band using\na periodic array of very small clamped circles. Inspired by this experimental\nand theoretical observation, all be it in a situation far removed from seismic\nwaves, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve elastic surface (Rayleigh)\nand body (pressure P and shear S) wave reflectors at very large wavelengths in\nstructured soils modelled as a fully elastic layer periodically clamped to\nbedrock.\n  We identify zero frequency stop-bands that only exist in the limit of columns\nof concrete clamped at their base to the bedrock. In a realistic configuration\nof a sedimentary basin 15 meters deep we observe a zero frequency stop-band\ncovering a broad frequency range of $0$ to $30$ Hz.\n", "  We develop a new perturbation theory (PT) treatment that can describe\ngravitational dynamics of large-scale structure after shell-crossing in the\none-dimensional cosmological case. Starting with cold initial conditions, the\nmotion of matter distribution follows at early stages the single-stream regime,\nwhich can, in one dimension, be described exactly by the first-order Lagrangian\nperturbation, i.e. the Zel'dovich solution. However, the single-stream flow no\nlonger holds after shell-crossing and a proper account of the multi-stream flow\nis essential for post-collapse dynamics. In this paper, extending previous work\nby Colombi (2015, MNRAS 446, 2902), we present a perturbative description for\nthe multi-stream flow after shell-crossing in a cosmological setup. In\naddition, we introduce an adaptive smoothing scheme to deal with the bulk\nproperties of phase-space structures. The filtering scales in this scheme are\nlinked to the next-crossing time in the post-collapse region, estimated from\nour PT calculations. Our PT treatment combined with adaptive smoothing is\nillustrated in several cases. Predictions are compared to simulations and we\nfind that post-collapse PT with adaptive smoothing reproduces the power\nspectrum and phase-space structures remarkably well even at small scales, where\nZel'dovich solution substantially deviates from simulations.\n", "  Starting from an anisotropic (in all directions including the time direction\nof the brane) non-susy D2 brane solution of type IIA string theory we construct\nan anisotropic space-like D2 brane (or SD2 brane, for short) solution by the\nstandard trick of double Wick rotation. This solution is characterized by five\nindependent parameters. We show that upon compactification on six dimensional\nhyperbolic space (H$_6$) of time dependent volume of this SD2 brane solution\nleads to accelerating cosmologies (for some time $t\\sim\\,t_0$, with $t_0$ some\ncharacteristic time) where both the expansions and the accelerations are\ndifferent in three spatial directions of the resultant four dimensional\nuniverse. On the other hand at early times ($t \\ll t_0$) this four dimensional\nspace, under certain situations, leads to four dimensional Kasner-like\ncosmology, with two additional scalars, namely, the dilaton and a volume scalar\nof H$_6$. Unlike in the standard four dimensional Kasner cosmology here all\nthree Kasner exponents could be positive definite, leading to expansions in all\nthree directions.\n", "  We investigate a non-Abelian generalization of the Kuramoto model proposed by\nLohe and given by $N$ quantum oscillators (\"nodes\") connected by a quantum\nnetwork where the wavefunction at each node is distributed over quantum\nchannels to all other connected nodes. It leads to a system of Schr\\\"odinger\nequations coupled by nonlinear self-interacting potentials given by their\ncorrelations. We give a complete picture of synchronization results, given on\nthe relative size of the natural frequency and the coupling constant, for two\nnon-identical oscillators and show complete phase synchronization for arbitrary\n$N>2$ identical oscillators. Our results are mainly based on the analysis of\nthe ODE system satisfied by the correlations and on the introduction of a\nquantum order parameter, which is analogous to the one defined by Kuramoto in\nthe classical model. As a consequence of the previous results, we obtain the\nsynchronization of the probability and the current densities defined via the\nMadelung transformations.\n", "  We present a quantum framework based on a density matrix of a dimer system to\ninvestigate the quantum dynamics of excitation energy transfer (EET) in the\npresence of the evanescent field from the metal and the phonon bath. Due to the\nspatial correlation of the electric field in the vicinity of the metal, the\nspectral density of the evanescent field is similar to that of a shared phonon\nbath. However, the EET dynamics under the influence of the evanescent field is\nan open and a new problem. Here we use a thin metallic film to investigate the\neffect of the evanescent field on the excitation energy transfer in a dimer\nsystem based on a density matrix approach. Our results indicate that a thin\nmetallic film enhances the energy transfer rate at the expense of absorbing\nenergy during the process. Since the spectral density of the evanescent field\nis affected by the geometry of the medium and the distance of a dimer system\nfrom the medium, our results demonstrate the possibility to tune EET based on\nmaterial geometry and distances. Our model also serves as an expansion to\nquantum heat engine model and provides a framework to investigate the EET in\nlight harvesting molecular networks under the influence of the evanescent\nfield.\n", "  The numerical conformal bootstrap is used to study mixed correlators in\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in $d=4$ spacetime\ndimensions. Systems of four-point functions involving scalar chiral and real\noperators are analyzed, including the case where the scalar real operator is\nthe zero component of a global conserved current multiplet. New results on\nsuperconformal blocks as well as universal constraints on the space of 4D\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs with chiral operators are presented. At the level of\nprecision used, the conditions under which the putative \"minimal\" 4D\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT may be isolated into a disconnected allowed region remain\nelusive. Nevertheless, new features of the bounds are found that provide\nfurther evidence for the presence of a special solution to crossing symmetry\ncorresponding to the \"minimal\" 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT.\n", "  We present a self-consistent kinetic theory for the electronic response of a\nplasma-facing dielectric solid. Based on the Poisson equation and two sets of\nspatially separated Boltzmann equations, one for electrons and ions in the\nplasma and one for conduction band electrons and valence band holes in the\ndielectric, the approach gives the quasi-stationary density and potential\nprofiles of the electric double layer forming at the interface due to the\npermanent influx of electrons and ions from the plasma. The two sets of\nBoltzmann equations are connected by quantum-mechanical matching conditions for\nthe electron distribution functions and a semi-empirical model for hole\ninjection mimicking the neutralization of ions at the surface. Essential for\nthe kinetic modeling is the ambipolarity inside the wall, leading to an\nelectron-hole recombination condition, and the merging of the double layer with\nthe quasi-neutral, field-free regions deep inside the wall and the plasma. To\nindicate the feasibility as well as the potential of the approach we apply it\nto a collisionless, perfectly absorbing interface using intrinsic and extrinsic\nsilicon dioxide and silicon surfaces in contact with a two-temperature hydrogen\nplasma as an example.\n", "  We have measured the ionization efficiency of silicon nuclear recoils with\nkinetic energy between 1.8 and 20 keV. We bombarded a silicon-drift diode with\na neutron beam to perform an elastic-scattering experiment. A broad-energy\nneutron spectrum was used and the nuclear recoil energy was reconstructed using\na measurement of the time of flight and scattering angle of the scattered\nneutron. The overall trend of the results of this work is well described by the\ntheory of Lindhard et al. above 4 keV of recoil energy. Below this energy, the\npresented data shows a deviation from the model. The data indicates a faster\ndrop than the theory prediction at low energies.\n", "  One of the most studied approaches in phenomenology to introduce the breaking\nof Lorentz symmetry is the generic approach. This consist on the modification\nof the free particle dispersion relation by the addition of an extra power law\nterm of order $n$ on energy or momentum. Using this approach in the photon\nsector, we have calculated the generic rates for vacuum Cherenkov radiation and\nphoton decay, for any order $n$, at leading order. Explicit results for the\ndecay and emission rates for the lowest values of $n$ are also presented.\n", "  One essential feature in MRAM cells is the spin torque efficiency, which\ndescribes the ratio of the critical switching current to the energy barrier.\nWithin this paper it is reported that the spin torque efficiency can be\nimproved by a factor of 3.2 by the use a of dual free layer device, which\nconsists of one layer with perpendicular crystalline anisotropy and a second\nlayer with in-plane crystalline anisotropy. Detailed simulations solving the\nspin transport equations simultaneously with the micromagnetics equation were\nperformed in order to understand the origin of the switching current reduction\nby a factor of 4 for the dual layer structure compared to a single layer\nstructure. The main reason could be attributed to an increased spin\naccumulation within the free layer due to the dynamical tilting of the\nmagnetization within the in-plane region of the dual free layer.\n", "  Tunneling hetero-junctions (THJs) usually induce confined states at the\nregions close to the tunnel junction which significantly affect their transport\nproperties. Accurate numerical modeling of such effects requires combining the\nnon-equilibrium coherent quantum transport through tunnel junction, as well as\nthe quasi-equilibrium statistics arising from the strong scattering in the\ninduced quantum wells. In this work, a novel atomistic model is proposed to\ninclude both effects: the strong scattering in the regions around THJ and the\ncoherent tunneling. The new model matches reasonably well with experimental\nmeasurements of Nitride THJ and provides an efficient engineering tool for\nperformance prediction and design of THJ based devices.\n", "  An important aspect in understanding the dynamics in the context of\ndeparametrized models of LQG is to obtain a sufficient control on the quantum\nevolution generated by a given Hamiltonian operator. More specifically, we need\nto be able to compute the evolution of relevant physical states and observables\nwith a relatively good precision. In this article, we introduce an\napproximation method to deal with the physical Hamiltonian operators in\ndeparametrized LQG models, and apply it to models in which a free Klein-Gordon\nscalar field or a non-rotational dust field is taken as the physical time\nvariable. This method is based on using standard time-independent perturbation\ntheory of quantum mechanics to define a perturbative expansion of the\nHamiltonian operator, the small perturbation parameter being determined by the\nBarbero-Immirzi parameter $\\beta$. This method allows us to define an\napproximate spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian operators and hence to\ncompute the evolution over a certain time interval. As a specific example, we\nanalyze the evolution of expectation values of the volume and curvature\noperators starting with certain physical initial states, using both the\nperturbative method and a straightforward expansion of the expectation value in\npowers of the time variable. This work represents a first step towards\nachieving the goal of understanding and controlling the new dynamics developed\nin [25, 26].\n", "  We revisit the D0 bound state problems, of the M/IIA duality, with the\nOrientifolds. The cases of O4 and O8 have been studied recently, from the\nperspective of five-dimensional theories, while the case of O0 has been much\nneglected. The computation we perform for D0-O0 states boils down to the Witten\nindices for $\\mathcal N=16$ $O(m)$ and $Sp(n)$ quantum mechanics, where we\nadapt and extend previous analysis by the authors. The twisted partition\nfunction $\\Omega$, obtained via localization, proves to be rational, and we\nestablish a precise relation between $\\Omega$ and the integral Witten index\n$\\mathcal I$, by identifying continuum contributions sector by sector. The\nresulting Witten index shows surprisingly large numbers of threshold bound\nstates but in a manner consistent with M-theory. We close with an exploration\non how the ubiquitous rational invariants of the wall-crossing physics would\ngeneralize to theories with Orientifolds.\n", "  In this contribution, we present the open-flavor strong decays of light\nbaryons computed within the framework of quark model. The transition amplitudes\nare computed using a modified $^3P_0$ operator, where a mechanism strange\nsuppression is taken into account. Also we discus the strange suppression\nwithin an extension of the quark model.\n", "  We use the cosmo-OWLS and BAHAMAS suites of cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations to explore the separate and combined effects of baryon physics\n(particularly feedback from active galactic nuclei, AGN) and free-streaming of\nmassive neutrinos on large-scale structure. We focus on five diagnostics: i)\nthe halo mass function; ii) halo mass density profiles; iii) the halo\nmass-concentration relation; iv) the clustering of haloes; and v) the\nclustering of matter; and we explore the extent to which the effects of baryon\nphysics and neutrino free-streaming can be treated independently. Consistent\nwith previous studies, we find that both AGN feedback and neutrino\nfree-streaming suppress the total matter power spectrum, although their scale\nand redshift dependencies differ significantly. The inclusion of AGN feedback\ncan significantly reduce the masses of groups and clusters, and increase their\nscale radii. These effects lead to a decrease in the amplitude of the\nmass-concentration relation and an increase in the halo autocorrelation\nfunction at fixed mass. Neutrinos also lower the masses of groups and clusters\nwhile having no significant effect on the shape of their density profiles (thus\nalso affecting the mass-concentration relation and halo clustering in a\nqualitatively similar way to feedback). We show that, with only a small number\nof exceptions, the combined effects of baryon physics and neutrino\nfree-streaming on all five diagnostics can be estimated to typically better\nthan a few percent accuracy by treating these processes independently (i.e., by\nmultiplying their separate effects).\n", "  Results for the antinucleon-nucleon ($\\bar NN$) interaction obtained at\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory (EFT)\nare reported. A new local regularization scheme is used for the pion-exchange\ncontributions that has been recently suggested and applied in a pertinent study\nof the $NN$ force within chiral EFT. Furthermore, an alternative strategy for\nestimating the uncertainty is utilized that no longer depends on a variation of\nthe cutoffs. The low-energy constants associated with the arising contact terms\nare fixed by a fit to the phase shifts and inelasticities provided by a\nphase-shift analysis of $\\bar pp$ scattering data. An excellent description of\nthe $\\bar NN$ amplitudes is achieved at the highest order considered. Moreover,\nbecause of the quantitative reproduction of partial waves up to $J=3$, there is\nalso a nice agreement on the level of $\\bar pp$ observables. Specifically,\ntotal and integrated elastic and charge-exchange cross sections agree well with\nthe results from the partial-wave analysis up to laboratory energies of $300$\nMeV, while differential cross sections and analyzing powers are described\nquantitatively up to $200$-$250$ MeV. The low-energy structure of the $\\bar NN$\namplitudes is also considered and compared to data from antiprotonic hydrogen.\n", "  We show that (3+1)-dimensional topological phases of matter generically\nsupport loop excitations with topological degeneracy. The loops carry \"Cheshire\ncharge\": topological charge that is not the integral of a locally-defined\ntopological charge density. Cheshire charge has previously been discussed in\nnon-Abelian gauge theories, but we show that it is a generic feature of all\n(3+1)-D topological phases (even those constructed from an Abelian gauge\ngroup). Indeed, Cheshire charge is closely related to non-trivial three-loop\nbraiding. We use a dimensional reduction argument to compute the topological\ndegeneracy of loop excitations in the (3+1)-dimensional topological phases\nassociated with Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories. We explicitly construct\nmembrane operators associated with such excitations in soluble microscopic\nlattice models in ${\\mathbb{Z}_2}\\times{\\mathbb{Z}_2}$ Dijkgraaf-Witten phases\nand generalize this construction to arbitrary membrane-net models. We explain\nwhy these loop excitations are the objects in the braided fusion 2-category\n$Z(\\mathbf{2Vect}_G^{\\omega})$, thereby supporting the hypothesis that\n2-categories are the correct mathematical framework for (3+1)-dimensional\ntopological phases.\n", "  The well-known problem of the unknown power corrections within QCD improved\nfactorisation leaves the interpretation of the so-called LHCb anomalies in the\nangular observables of B-->K* mu+ mu- as an open problem. In order to\ncontribute to the question whether they represent a first sign for new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model or a consequence of underestimated hadronic power\ncorrections, we present a direct comparison of two global fits to the data\nbased on the two different assumptions. In addition, we summarise the possible\noptions to resolve this puzzle in the future.\n", "  Low-loss crystals with defects due to paramagnetic or rare earth impurity\nions is a major area of investigation for quantum hybrid systems at both\noptical and microwave frequencies. In this work we examine the single crystal\nyttrium aluminium perovskite, YAlO$_3$ using the Whispering Gallery Mode\nTechnique. Multiple resonant microwave modes were measured from room\ntemperature to 20 mK allowing precise characterization of the permittivity\ntensor at microwave frequencies. We show that it is biaxial and characterize\nthe tensor as a function of temperature with estimated uncertainties below\n0.26%. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy was also performed at 20 mK, with\nnew transitions identified with Zero-Field splittings of 16.72 and 9.92 GHz.\nSpin-photon couplings of order 4.2 and 8.4 MHz were observed for residual\nlevels of concentration, which are stronger than the photon cavity linewidths\nof 116 kHz but the same order of the linewidths of the discovered spin\ntransitions.\n", "  There is no known obstructions, but we have not been aware of any concrete\nexamples, either. The Wess-Zumino consistency condition for the conformal\nanomaly says that $a$ cannot change but does not say anything about $c$. In\nsupersymmetric models, both $a$ and $c$ are determined from the triangle\nt'Hooft anomalies and the unitarity demands that both must be fixed, so the\nunitary supersymmetric conformal field theories do not admit such a\npossibility. Given this field theory situation, we construct an effective\nAdS/CFT model without supersymmetry in which $c$ changes under exactly marginal\ndeformations. So, yes, we can.\n", "  We study the loss of quantumness caused by time dilation [1] for a\nSchr\\\"odinger cat state. We give a holistic view of the quantum to classical\ntransition by comparing the dynamics of several nonclassicality indicators,\nsuch as the Wigner function interference fringe, the negativity of the Wigner\nfunction, the nonclassical depth, the Vogel criterion and the Klyshko\ncriterion. Our results show that only two of these indicators depend critically\non the size of the cat, namely on how macroscopic the superposition is. Finally\nwe compare the gravitation-induced decoherence times to the typical decoherence\ntimes due to classical noise originating from the unavoidable statistical\nfluctuations in the characteristic parameters of the system [21]. We show that\nthe experimental observation of decoherence due to time dilation imposes severe\nlimitations on the allowed levels of classical noise in the experiments.\n", "  We evaluate both chirally even and odd generalized parton distributions(GPDs)\nin the leading twist in a recently proposed quark-diquark model for the proton\nwhere the light front wavefunctions are constructed from the soft-wall AdS/QCD\nprediction. The GPDs in transverse impact parameter space give the spin\ndensities for different quark and proton polarizations. For longitudinally\npolarized proton only chiral even GPDs contribute but for transversely\npolarized proton both chiral even and chiral odd GPDs contribute to the spin\ndensities. We present a detail study of the spin densities in this model.\n", "  Context: A substantial fraction of protoplanetary disks forms around stellar\nbinaries. The binary system generates a time-dependent non-axisymmetric\ngravitational potential, inducing strong tidal forces on the circumbinary disk.\nThis leads to a change in basic physical properties of the circumbinary disk,\nwhich should in turn result in unique structures that are potentially\nobservable with the current generation of instruments.\n  Aims: The goal of this study is to identify these characteristic structures,\nto constrain the physical conditions that cause them, and to evaluate the\nfeasibility to observe them in circumbinary disks.\n  Methods: To achieve this, at first two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations\nare performed. The resulting density distributions are post-processed with a 3D\nradiative transfer code to generate re-emission and scattered light maps. Based\non these, we study the influence of various parameters, such as the mass of the\nstellar components, the mass of the disk and the binary separation on\nobservable features in circumbinary disks.\n  Results: We find that the Atacama Large (sub-)Millimetre Array (ALMA) as well\nas the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) are capable of tracing\nasymmetries in the inner region of circumbinary disks which are affected most\nby the binary-disk interaction. Observations at submillimetre/millimetre\nwavelengths will allow the detection of the density waves at the inner rim of\nthe disk and the inner cavity. With the E-ELT one can partially resolve the\ninnermost parts of the disk in the infrared wavelength range, including the\ndisk's rim, accretion arms and potentially the expected circumstellar disks\naround each of the binary components.\n", "  We present a versatile laser system which provides more than 1.5W of\nnarrowband light, tunable in the range from 455-463 nm. It consists of a\ncommercial Titanium-Sapphire laser which is frequency doubled using resonant\ncavity second harmonic generation and stabilized to an external reference\ncavity. We demonstrate a wide wavelength tuning range combined with a narrow\nlinewidth and low intensity noise. This laser system is ideally suited for\natomic physics experiments such as two-photon excitation of Rydberg states of\npotassium atoms with principal quantum numbers n > 18. To demonstrate this we\nperform two-photon spectroscopy on ultracold potassium gases in which we\nobserve an electromagnetically induced transparency resonance corresponding to\nthe 35s1/2 state and verify the long-term stability of the laser system.\nAdditionally, by performing spectroscopy in a magneto-optical trap we observe\nstrong loss features corresponding to the excitation of s, p, d and higher-l\nstates accessible due to a small electric Field.\n", "  We investigate a strongly correlated system of light and matter in\ntwo-dimensional cavity arrays. We formulate a Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian for\ntwo-level atoms coupled to cavity modes and driven by an external laser field\nwhich reduces to an effective spin Hamiltonian in the dispersive regime. In one\ndimension we provide exact analytical solution. In two dimensions, we perform\nmean-field study and large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of both the\nJaynes-Cummings and the effective spin models. We discuss the phase diagram and\nthe parameter regime which gives rise to frustrated interactions between the\nspins. We provide quantitative description of the phase transitions and\ncorrelation properties featured by the system and we discuss graph-theoretical\nproperties of the ground states in terms of graph colorings using P\\'{o}lya's\nenumeration theorem.\n", "  Solar flares are complicated physical phenomena that are observable in a\nbroad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radiowaves to $\\gamma$-rays.\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of flares, it is necessary to perform a\ncombined multi-wavelength analysis using observations from many satellites and\nground-based observatories. For efficient data search, integration of different\nflare lists and representation of observational data, we have developed an\nInteractive Multi-Instrument Database of Solar Flares\n(https://solarflare.njit.edu/). The web accessible database is fully functional\nand allows the user to search for uniquely-identified flare events based on\ntheir physical descriptors and availability of observations by a particular set\nof instruments. Currently, the data from three primary flare lists (GOES,\nRHESSI and HEK) and a variety of other event catalogs (Hinode, Fermi GBM,\nKonus-Wind, OVSA flare catalogs, CACTus CME catalog, Filament eruption catalog)\nand observing logs (IRIS and Nobeyama coverage) are integrated, and an\nadditional set of physical descriptors (temperature and emission measure) is\nprovided along with an observing summary, data links, and multi-wavelength\nlight curves for each flare event since January, 2002. We envision that this\nnew tool will allow researchers to significantly speed up the search of events\nof interest for statistical and case studies.\n", "  3D2V continuum gyrokinetic simulations of electrostatic plasma turbulence in\na straight, open-field-line geometry have been performed using the full-$f$\ndiscontinuous-Galerkin code Gkeyll. These simulations include the basic\nelements of a fusion-device scrape-off layer: localized sources to model plasma\noutflow from the core, cross-field turbulent transport, parallel flow along\nmagnetic field lines, and parallel losses at the limiter or divertor with\nsheath model boundary conditions. The set of sheath boundary conditions used in\nthe model allows currents to flow through the walls. In addition to details of\nthe numerical approach, results from numerical simulations of turbulence in the\nLarge Plasma Device (LAPD), a linear device featuring straight magnetic field\nlines, are presented.\n", "  The electronic structure of a crystalline solid is largely determined by its\nlattice structure. Recent advances in van der Waals solids, artificial crystals\nwith controlled stacking of two-dimensional (2D) atomic films, have enabled the\ncreation of materials with novel electronic structures. In particular, stacking\ngraphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) introduces moir\\'e superlattice that\nfundamentally modifies graphene's band structure and gives rise to secondary\nDirac points (SDPs). Here we find that the formation of a moir\\'e superlattice\nin graphene on hBN yields new, unexpected consequences: a set of tertiary Dirac\npoints (TDPs) emerge, which give rise to additional sets of Landau levels when\nthe sample is subjected to an external magnetic field. Our observations hint at\nthe formation of a hidden Kekul\\'e superstructure on top of the moir\\'e\nsuperlattice under appropriate carrier doping and magnetic fields.\n", "  We quantify the relative weight of inverse spin Hall and spin rectification\neffects occurring in RF-sputtered polycrystalline permalloy, molecular beam\nepitaxy-grown epitaxial iron and liquid phase epitaxy-grown yttrium-iron-garnet\nbilayer systems with different capping materials. To distinguish the spin\nrectification signal from the inverse spin Hall voltage the external magnetic\nfield is rotated in-plane to take advantage of the different angular\ndependencies of the prevailing effects. We prove that in permalloy anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance is the dominant source for spin rectification while in\nepitaxial iron the anomalous Hall effect has an also comparable strength. The\nrectification in yttrium-iron-garnet/platinum bilayers reveals an angular\ndependence imitating the one seen for anisotropic magnetoresistance caused by\nspin Hall magnetoresistance.\n", "  Using the multivariate residue calculus of Leray, we give a precise\ndefinition of the notion of a cut Feynman integral in dimensional\nregularization, as a residue evaluated on the variety where some of the\npropagators are put on shell. These are naturally associated to Landau\nsingularities of the first type. Focusing on the one-loop case, we give an\nexplicit parametrization to compute such cut integrals, with which we study\nsome of their properties and list explicit results for maximal and\nnext-to-maximal cuts. By analyzing homology groups, we show that cut integrals\nassociated to Landau singularities of the second type are specific combinations\nof the usual cut integrals, and we obtain linear relations among different cuts\nof the same integral. We also show that all one-loop Feynman integrals and\ntheir cuts belong to the same class of functions, which can be written as\nparametric integrals.\n", "  Supercontinuum generation using chip-integrated photonic waveguides is a\npowerful approach for spectrally broadening pulsed laser sources with very low\npulse energies and compact form factors. When pumped with a mode-locked laser\nfrequency comb, these waveguides can coherently expand the comb spectrum to\nmore than an octave in bandwidth to enable self-referenced stabilization.\nHowever, for applications in frequency metrology and precision spectroscopy, it\nis desirable to not only support self-referencing, but also to generate\nlow-noise combs with customizable broadband spectra. In this work, we\ndemonstrate dispersion-engineered waveguides based on silicon nitride that are\ndesigned to meet these goals and enable precision optical metrology experiments\nacross large wavelength spans. We perform a clock comparison measurement and\nreport a clock-limited relative frequency instability of $3.8\\times10^{-15}$ at\n$\\tau = 2$ seconds between a 1550 nm cavity-stabilized reference laser and\nNIST's calcium atomic clock laser at 657 nm using a two-octave\nwaveguide-supercontinuum comb.\n", "  Computational ghost imaging is a robust and compact system that has drawn\nwide attentions over the last two decades. Multispectral imaging possesses\nspatial and spectral resolving abilities, is very useful for surveying scenes\nand extracting detailed information. Existing multispectral imagers mostly\nutilize narrow band filters or dispersive optical devices to separate lights of\ndifferent wavelengths, and then use multiple bucket detectors or an array\ndetector to record them separately. Here, we propose a novel multispectral\nghost imaging method that uses one single bucket detector with multiplexed\nillumination to produce colored image. The multiplexed illumination patterns\nare produced by three binary encoded matrices (corresponding to red, green,\nblue colored information, respectively) and random patterns. The results of\nsimulation and experiment have verified that our method can be effective to\nrecover the colored object. Our method has two major advantages: one is that\nthe binary encoded matrices as cipher keys can protect the security of private\ncontents; the other is that multispectral images are produced simultaneously by\none single-pixel detector, which significantly reduces the amount of the data\nacquisition.\n", "  Quantum interference lies at the heart of several surprising equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium phenomena in many-body Physics. Here we discuss two recently\nexplored non-equilibrium scenarios where external periodic drive applied to\nclosed (i.e., not attached to any external bath) quantum many-body systems have\napparently opposite effects in respective cases. In one case it\nfreezes/localizes a disorder free system dynamically, while in the other it\ndelocalizes a disordered many-body localized system, and quantum interference\nis responsible for both the effects. We review these in the perspective of more\ngeneral questions of ergodicity, energy absorption, asymptotic behavior, and\nfinally the essential role of quantum mechanics in understanding these issues\nin periodically driven closed many-body systems. In this article we intend to\ndeliver a non-technical account of some recent developments in this field in a\nmanner accessible to a broad readership.\n", "  In this study, we propose a mechanical model of a plurality election based on\na mean field voter model. We assume that there are three candidates in each\nelectoral district, i.e., one from the ruling party, one from the main\nopposition party, and one from other political parties. The voters are\nclassified as fixed supporters and herding (floating) voters with ratios of\n$1-p$ and $p$, respectively. Fixed supporters make decisions based on their\ninformation and herding voters make the same choice as another randomly\nselected voter. The equilibrium vote-share probability density of herding\nvoters follows a Dirichlet distribution. We estimate the composition of fixed\nsupporters in each electoral district and $p$ using data from elections to the\nHouse of Representatives in Japan (43rd to 47th). The spatial inhomogeneity of\nfixed supporters explains the long-range spatial and temporal correlations. The\nestimated values of $p$ are close to the estimates obtained from a survey.\n", "  We introduce a hybrid approach to applying the density matrix renormalization\ngroup (DMRG) to continuous systems, combining a grid approximation along one\ndirection with a finite Gaussian basis set along the remaining two directions.\nThis approach is especially useful for chain-like molecules, where the grid is\nused in the long direction, and we demonstrate the approach with results for\nhydrogen chains. The computational time for this system scales approximately\nlinearly with the length of the chain, as we demonstrate with minimal basis set\ncalculations with up to 1000 atoms, which are near-exact within the basis. The\nlinear scaling comes from the combination of localization of the basis and a\ncompression method with controlled accuracy for the long-ranged Coulomb terms\nin the Hamiltonian.\n", "  Magnetic materials hosting correlated electrons play an important role for\ninformation technology and signal processing. The currently used ferro-, ferri-\nand antiferromagnetic materials provide microscopic moments (spins) that are\nmainly collinear. Recently more complex spin structures such as spin helices\nand cycloids have regained a lot of interest. The interest has been initiated\nby the discovery of the skyrmion lattice phase in non-centrosymmetric helical\nmagnets. In this review we address how spin helices and skyrmion lattices\nenrich the microwave characteristics of magnetic materials. When discussing\nperspectives for microwave electronics and magnonics we focus particularly on\ninsulating materials as they avoid eddy current losses, offer low spin-wave\ndamping, and might allow for electric field control of collective spin\nexcitations. Thereby, they further fuel the vision of magnonics operated at low\nenergy consumption.\n", "  We demonstrate reconfigurable phase-only computer-generated metasurface\nholograms with one, two, or three image planes operating in the visible regime\non a stretchable polydimethylsiloxane substrate. Stretching the substrate\nenlarges the hologram image and changes the location of the image plane. Upon\nstretching, these devices can switch the displayed holographic image between\nmultiple distinct images. This work opens up the possibilities for stretchable\nmetasurface holograms as flat devices for dynamically reconfigurable optical\ncommunication and display. It also confirms that metasurfaces on stretchable\nsubstrates can serve as platform for a variety of reconfigurable optical\ndevices.\n", "  The problem of characterizing classical and quantum correlations in networks\nis considered. Contrary to the usual Bell scenario, where distant observers\nshare a physical system emitted by one common source, a network features\nseveral independent sources, each distributing a physical system to a subset of\nobservers. In the quantum setting, the observers can perform joint measurements\non initially independent systems, which may lead to strong correlations across\nthe whole network. In this work, we introduce a technique to systematically map\na Bell inequality to a family of Bell-type inequalities bounding classical\ncorrelations on networks in a star-configuration. Also, we show that whenever a\ngiven Bell inequality can be violated by some entangled state $\\rho$, then all\nthe corresponding network inequalities can be violated by considering many\ncopies of $\\rho$ distributed in the star network. The relevance of these ideas\nis illustrated by applying our method to a specific multi-setting Bell\ninequality. We derive the corresponding network inequalities, and study their\nquantum violations.\n", "  Zero field cooled (ZFC)/Field Cooled (FC) magnetization curves of a bulk MnO\nsingle crystal show a peculiar peak at low temperatures (~40K) similar to the\nlow temperature peak observed in MnO nanoparticles. In order to investigate the\norigin of this peak, the spin structure of a MnO single crystal has been\nstudied and compared with a single phase powder sample using magnetometry and\npolarized neutron scattering. Both magnetometry and polarized neutron\ndiffraction results confirm the antiferromagnetic (AF) phase transition at the\nN\\'eel temperature T_N of 118K, in both powder and single crystal form.\nHowever, the low temperature peak in the ZFC/FC magnetization curves is not\nobserved in single phase MnO powder. To better understand the observed\nbehavior, ac susceptibility measurements have been employed. We conclude that\nthe clear peak in the magnetic signal from the single crystal originates from a\nsmall amount of ferrimagnetic (FiM) Mn2O3 or Mn3O4 impurities, which is grown\nat the interfaces between MnO crystal twins.\n", "  We present Herschel PACS observations of the [CII] 158 micron emission line\nin a sample of 24 intermediate mass (9<logM$_\\ast$/M$_\\odot$<10) and low\nmetallicity (0.4< Z/Z$_\\odot$<1.0) galaxies from the xCOLD GASS survey.\nCombining them with IRAM CO(1-0) measurements, we establish scaling relations\nbetween integrated and molecular region [CII]/CO(1-0) luminosity ratios as a\nfunction of integrated galaxy properties. A Bayesian analysis reveals that only\ntwo parameters, metallicity and offset from the star formation main sequence,\n$\\Delta$MS, are needed to quantify variations in the luminosity ratio;\nmetallicity describes the total dust content available to shield CO from UV\nradiation, while $\\Delta$MS describes the strength of this radiation field. We\nconnect the [CII]/CO luminosity ratio to the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and\nfind a multivariate conversion function $\\alpha_{CO}$, which can be used up to\nz~2.5. This function depends primarily on metallicity, with a second order\ndependence on $\\Delta$MS. We apply this to the full xCOLD GASS and PHIBSS1\nsurveys and investigate molecular gas scaling relations. We find a flattening\nof the relation between gas mass fraction and stellar mass at\nlogM$_\\ast$/M$_\\odot$<10. While the molecular gas depletion time varies with\nsSFR, it is mostly independent of mass, indicating that the low L$_{CO}$/SFR\nratios long observed in low mass galaxies are entirely due to photodissociation\nof CO, and not to an enhanced star formation efficiency.\n", "  The interfacial thermal resistance determines condensation-evaporation\nprocesses and thermal transport across material-fluid interfaces. Despite its\nimportance in transport processes, the interfacial structure responsible for\nthe thermal resistance is still unknown. By combining non-equilibrium molecular\ndynamics simulations and interfacial analyses that remove the interfacial\nthermal fluctuations we show that the thermal resistance of liquid-vapor\ninterfaces is connected to a low density fluid layer that is adsorbed at the\nliquid surface. This thermal resistance layer (TRL) defines the boundary where\nthe thermal transport mechanism changes from that of gases (ballistic) to that\ncharacteristic of dense liquids, dominated by frequent particle collisions\ninvolving very short mean free paths. We show that the thermal conductance is\nproportional to the number of atoms adsorbed in the TRL, and hence we explain\nthe structural origin of the thermal resistance in liquid-vapor interfaces.\n", "  We consider an isolated electroweak monopole solution within the Standard\nModel with a non-linear Born-Infeld extension of the hypercharge gauge field.\nMonopole (and dyon) solutions in such an extension are regular and their masses\nare predicted to be proportional to the Born-Infeld mass parameter. We argue\nthat cosmological production of electroweak monopoles may delay the electroweak\nphase transition and make it more strongly first order for monopole masses\n$M\\gtrsim 9.3\\cdot 10^3$ TeV, while the nucleosynthesis constraints on the\nabundance of relic monopoles impose the bound $M\\lesssim 2.3\\cdot 10^4$ TeV.\nThe monopoles with a mass in this shallow range may be responsible for the\ndynamical generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry during the electroweak\nphase transition.\n", "  Osteocytes and their cell processes reside in a large, interconnected network\nof voids pervading the mineralized bone matrix of most vertebrates. This\nosteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN) is believed to play important roles\nin mechanosensing, mineral homeostasis, and for the mechanical properties of\nbone. While the extracellular matrix structure of bone is extensively studied\non ultrastructural and macroscopic scales, there is a lack of quantitative\nknowledge on how the cellular network is organized. Using a recently introduced\nimaging and quantification approach, we analyze the OLCN in different bone\ntypes from mouse and sheep that exhibit different degrees of structural\norganization not only of the cell network but also of the fibrous matrix\ndeposited by the cells. We define a number of robust, quantitative measures\nthat are derived from the theory of complex networks. These measures enable us\nto gain insights into how efficient the network is organized with regard to\nintercellular transport and communication. Our analysis shows that the cell\nnetwork in regularly organized, slow-growing bone tissue from sheep is less\nconnected, but more efficiently organized compared to irregular and\nfast-growing bone tissue from mice. On the level of statistical topological\nproperties (edges per node, edge length and degree distribution), both network\ntypes are indistinguishable, highlighting that despite pronounced differences\nat the tissue level, the topological architecture of the osteocyte canalicular\nnetwork at the subcellular level may be independent of species and bone type.\nOur results suggest a universal mechanism underlying the self-organization of\nindividual cells into a large, interconnected network during bone formation and\nmineralization.\n", "  The most important part of a railgun launch package is the armature where the\nelectromagnetic force is generated leading to the acceleration of the launch\npackage. In case of metal armatures, the most commonly used armature types are\nthe C-shape and the multi-fiber brush technology. However, rarely both armature\ntypes were systematically compared under similar experimental conditions. That\nis why we constructed launch packages based on the C-shaped and brush armature\ntechnology with comparable armature and payload mass. With these launch\npackages a series of experiments were performed in an energy range between 0.8\nMJ and 1.13 MJ corresponding to a speed range between 950 m/s and 1400 m/s. The\nresults of the experiments were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.\nOn the one hand our results show that the total losses are higher for the\nC-shaped armature technology than for the brush aramture technology. On the\nother hand our results show that launch packages based on the C-shaped\ntechnology convert better electrical energy into kinetic energy.\n", "  Few inventions have shaped the world like the incandescent bulb. While Edison\nused thermal radiation from ohmically heated conductors, some noble metals\nexhibit \"cold\" electroluminescence (EL) in percolation films, tunnel diodes,\nelectromigrated nanoparticle aggregates, optical antennae, or\nscanning-tunnelling microscopy (STM). The origin of this radiation, which is\nspectrally broad and depends on applied bias, is controversial given the low\nradiative yields of electronic transitions. Nanoparticle EL is particularly\nintriguing since it involves localized surface-plasmon resonances with large\ndipole moments. Such plasmons enable very efficient non-radiative fluorescence\nresonance energy transfer (FRET) coupling to proximal resonant dipole\ntransitions. We demonstrate nanoscopic FRET-LEDs which exploit the opposite\nprocess, energy transfer from silver nanoparticles to exfoliated monolayers of\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). In diffraction-limited hotspots\nshowing pronounced photon bunching, broadband silver EL is focused into the\nnarrow excitonic resonance of the atomically thin overlayer. Such devices may\noffer alternatives to conventional nano-LEDs in on-chip optical interconnects.\n", "  We develop an effective-field-theory (EFT) framework to analyze the spectra\nemerging from lattice simulations of a large class of confining gauge theories.\nSimulations of these theories, for which the light-fermion count is not far\nbelow the critical value for transition to infrared conformal behavior, have\nindicated the presence of a remarkably light singlet scalar particle. We\nincorporate this particle by including a scalar field in the EFT along with the\nNambu-Goldstone bosons (NGB's), and discuss the application of this EFT to\nlattice data. We highlight the feature that data on the NGB's alone can tightly\nrestrict the form of the scalar interactions. As an example, we apply the\nframework to lattice data for an SU(3) gauge theory with eight fermion flavors,\nconcluding that the EFT can describe the data well.\n", "  A method for constructing the Lax pairs for nonlinear integrable models is\nsuggested. First we look for a nonlinear invariant manifold to the\nlinearization of the given equation. Examples show that such invariant manifold\ndoes exist and can effectively be found. Actually it is defined by a quadratic\nform. As a result we get a nonlinear Lax pair consisting of the linearized\nequation and the invariant manifold. Our second step consists of finding an\nappropriate change of the variables to linearize the found nonlinear Lax pair.\nThe desired change of the variables is again defined by a quadratic form. The\nmethod is illustrated by the well-known KdV equation and the modified Volterra\nchain. New Lax pairs are found. The formal asymptotic expansions for their\neigenfunctions are constructed around the singular values of the spectral\nparameter. By applying the method of the formal diagonalization to these Lax\npairs the infinite series of the local conservation laws are obtained for the\ncorresponding nonlinear models.\n", "  We employ {\\it ab-initio} fully-relativistic electronic structure\ncalculations to study the stability of the Weyl points in the momentum space\nwithin the class of the half-metallic ferromagnetic full Heusler materials, by\nfocusing on Co$_2$TiAl as a well-established prototype compound. Here we show\nthat both the number of the Weyl points together with their $k$-space\ncoordinates can be controlled by the orientation of the magnetization. This\nalternative degree of freedom, which is absent in other topological materials\n(e.g. in Weyl semimetals), introduces novel functionalities, specific for the\nclass of half-metallic ferromagnets. Of special interest are Weyl points which\nare preserved irrespectively of any arbitrary rotation of the magnetization\naxis.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce an alternative representation of the\nelectromagnetic field scattered from a homogeneous sphere coated with a\nhomogeneous layer of uniform thickness. Specifically, we expand the scattered\nfield using a set of modes that are independent of the permittivity of the\ncoating, while the expansion coefficients are simple rational functions of the\npermittivity. The theory we develop represents both a framework for the\nanalysis of plasmonic and photonic modes and a straightforward methodology to\ndesign the permittivity of the coating to pursue a prescribed tailoring of the\nscattered field. To illustrate the practical implications of this method, we\ndesign the permittivity of the coating to zero either the backscattering or a\nprescribed multipolar order of the scattered field, and to maximize an electric\nfield component in a given point of space.\n", "  We consider the planar magnonic waveguide with a periodic sequence of\nantidots forming zig-zag pattern, where two neighboring antidots are shifted\ntowards the opposite edges of the waveguide. This system has a complex base\nwith two antidots in one unit cell. The Brillouin zone is here two-times\nnarrower than the Brillouin zone for the waveguide without displacement of\nantidots. We have shown that for dispersion relation folded into narrower\nBrillouin zone, new frequency gap can be opened and their width can be\ncontrolled by the shift of the antidots. We found that, the different strength\nof spin wave pinning at the edges of the periodic waveguide (and their\nantidots)determines the dependence of the width of gap on the shift of\nantidots. For the systems with completely free or ideally pinned magnetization,\nthese dependencies are qualitatively different. We have found an optimum shift\nof antidot for maximzing the width of the gap for the system with pinned\nmagnetization. More interestingly, we notice that for this kind of geometry of\nthe structure, majority of the modes are doubly degenerate at the edge of\nBrillouin zone and have a finite group velocity at the very close vicinity of\nthe edge of Brillouin zone, for larger values of antidot shift. This empowers\nus to design magnonic waveguide to steer the spin waves.\n", "  Magnons, the spin-wave quanta, are disturbances that embody a wave\npropagating through a background medium formed by ordered magnetic moments. In\nan isotropic Heisenberg system, these disturbances vary in a continuous manner\naround an ordered spin structure, thus requiring infinitesimal energy as a\nwavevector approaches a magnetic zone centre. However, competing anisotropic\ninteractions arising from broken symmetry can favour a distinct static and\ndynamic spin state causing a shift of the minimum point of the magnon\ndispersion to a nonreciprocal wavevector. Here we report the first direct\nevidence of these nonreciprocal magnons in an antiferromagnet. In the\nantiferromagnet we investigated, namely, noncentrosymmetric\n$\\alpha$-Cu$_2$V$_2$O$_7$, they are caused by the incompatibility between\nanisotropic exchange and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions\nresulting in competing collinear and helical spin structures, respectively. The\nnonreciprocity introduces the difference in the phase velocity of the\ncounter-rotating modes, causing the opposite spontaneous magnonic Faraday\nrotation of the left- and right-propagating spin-waves. The breaking of spatial\ninversion and time reversal symmetry is revealed as a magnetic-field-induced\nasymmetric energy shift, which provides a test for the detailed balance\nrelation.\n", "  Long-lived and ultra-confined plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) electron\nsystems may provide a sub-wavelength diagnostic tool to investigate localized\ndielectric, electromagnetic, and pseudo-electromagnetic perturbations. In this\nArticle, we present a general theoretical framework to study the scattering of\n2D plasmons against such perturbations in the non-retarded limit. We discuss\nboth parabolic-band and massless Dirac fermion 2D electron systems. Our theory\nstarts from a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the screened potential in an\ninhomogeneous 2D electron system and utilizes as inputs analytical\nlong-wavelength expressions for the density-density response function, going\nbeyond the local approximation. We present illustrative results for the\nscattering of 2D plasmons against a point-like charged impurity and a\none-dimensional electrostatic barrier due to a line of charges. Exact numerical\nresults obtained from the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation are\ncompared with approximate results based on the Born and eikonal approximations.\nThe importance of nonlocal effects is finally emphasized.\n", "  Pixel sensors using 8\" CMOS processing technology have been designed and\ncharacterized offering the benefits of industrial sensor fabrication, including\nlarge wafers, high throughput and yield, as well as low cost. The pixel sensors\nare produced using a 150 nm CMOS technology offered by LFoundry in Avezzano.\nThe technology provides multiple metal and polysilicon layers, as well as\nmetal-insulator-metal capacitors that can be employed for AC-coupling and\nredistribution layers. Several prototypes were fabricated and are characterized\nwith minimum ionizing particles before and after irradiation to fluences up to\n1.1 $\\times$ 10$^{15}$ n$_{\\rm eq}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CMOS-fabricated sensors\nperform equally well as standard pixel sensors in terms of noise and hit\ndetection efficiency. AC-coupled sensors even reach 100% hit efficiency in a\n3.2 GeV electron beam before irradiation.\n", "  Cooling the qubit into a pure initial state is crucial for realizing\nfault-tolerant quantum information processing. Here we envisage a star-topology\narrangement of reset and computation qubits for this purpose. The reset qubits\ncool or purify the computation qubit by transferring its entropy to a heat-bath\nwith the help of a heat-bath algorithmic cooling procedure. By combining\nstandard NMR methods with powerful quantum control techniques, we cool central\nqubits of two large star topology systems, with 13 and 37 spins respectively.\nWe obtain polarization enhancements by a factor of over 24, and an associated\nreduction in the spin temperature from 298 K down to 12 K. Exploiting the\nenhanced polarization of computation qubit, we prepare combination-coherences\nof orders up to 15. By benchmarking the decay of these coherences we\ninvestigate the underlying noise process. Further, we also cool a pair of\ncomputation qubits and subsequently prepare them in an effective pure-state.\n", "  Existing designs of transformation acoustic cloaks are not easy to implement\nin many practical situations because of their large dimensions, while\nscattering cancellation cloaks do not protect the inner cloak volume. Here we\nreport implementation of an acoustic metamaterial exhibiting cylindrical\ndispersion in an ultra-thin (~1mm) and ultra-lightweight (~3g) acoustic cloak\ndesign intended to protect a human-head-size object in air, which combines\nscattering cancellation in the far-field with efficient sound proofing of the\ninner cloak volume.\n", "  Despite its attractive features, Congruent-melted Lithium Niobate (CLN)\nsuffers from Photo-Refractive Damage (PRD). This light-induced refractive-index\nchange hampers the use of CLN when high-power densities are in play, a typical\nregime in integrated optics. The resistance to PRD can be largely improved by\ndoping the lithium-niobate substrates with magnesium oxide. However, the\nfabrication of waveguides on MgO-doped substrates is not as effective as for\nCLN: either the resistance to PRD is strongly reduced by the waveguide\nfabrication process (as it happens in Ti-indiffused waveguides) or the\nnonlinear conversion efficiency is lowered (as it occurs in annealed-proton\nexchange). Here we fabricate, for the first time, waveguides starting from\nMgO-doped substrates using the Soft-Proton Exchange (SPE) technique and we show\nthat this third way represents a promising alternative. We demonstrate that SPE\nallows to produce refractive-index profiles almost identical to those produced\non CLN without reducing the nonlinearity in the substrate. We also prove that\nthe SPE does not affect substantially the resistance to PRD. Since the\nfabrication recipe is identical between CLN and MgO-doped substrates, we\nbelieve that SPE might outperform standard techniques to fabricate robust and\nefficient waveguides for high-intensity-beam confinement.\n", "  The magnetization process of single crystals of the metallic kagom\\'e\nferromagnet Co3Sn2S2 was carefully measured via magnetization and AC\nsusceptibility. Field-dependent anomalous transitions in the magnetization\nindicate a low-field unconventionally ordered phase stabilized just below TC.\nThe magnetic phase diagrams in applied fields along different crystallographic\ndirections were determined. The magnetic relaxation process studied in\nfrequencies covering five orders of magnitude from 0.01 to 1000 Hz indicates\ncharacteristic relaxation times of several seconds at the boarders of the\nanomalous phase. Our results arise a lot of questions about the nature of\nCo3Sn2S2 magnetic states.\n", "  We show that the combination of X-ray scattering with a nanofocused beam and\nX-ray cross correlation analysis is an efficient means for the full structural\ncharacterization of mesocrystalline nanoparticle assemblies with a single\nexperiment. We analyze several hundred diffraction patterns of individual\nsample locations, i.e. individual grains, to obtain a meaningful statistical\ndistribution of the superlattice and atomic lattice ordering. Simultaneous\nsmall- and wide-angle X-ray scattering of the same sample location allows us to\ndetermine the structure and orientation of the superlattice as well as the\nangular correlation of the first two Bragg peaks of the atomic lattices, their\norientation with respect to the superlattice, and the average orientational\nmisfit due to local structural disorder. This experiment is particularly\nadvantageous for synthetic mesocrystals made by the simultaneous self-assembly\nof colloidal nanocrystals and surface-functionalization with conductive\nligands. While the structural characterization of such materials has been\nchallenging so far, the present method now allows correlating mesocrystalline\nstructure with optoelectronic properties.\n", "  As an emerging single elemental layered material with a low symmetry in-plane\ncrystal lattice, black phosphorus (BP) has attracted significant research\ninterest owing to its unique electronic and optoelectronic properties,\nincluding its widely tunable bandgap, polarization dependent photoresponse and\nhighly anisotropic in-plane charge transport. Despite extensive study of the\nsteady-state charge transport in BP, there has not been direct characterization\nand visualization of the hot carriers dynamics in BP immediately after\nphotoexcitation, which is crucial to understanding the performance of BP-based\noptoelectronic devices. Here we use the newly developed scanning ultrafast\nelectron microscopy (SUEM) to directly visualize the motion of photo-excited\nhot carriers on the surface of BP in both space and time. We observe highly\nanisotropic in-plane diffusion of hot holes, with a 15-times higher diffusivity\nalong the armchair (x-) direction than that along the zigzag (y-) direction.\nOur results provide direct evidence of anisotropic hot carrier transport in BP\nand demonstrate the capability of SUEM to resolve ultrafast hot carrier\ndynamics in layered two-dimensional materials.\n", "  For a physical field theory, the tree-level amplitudes should possess only\nsingle poles. However, when computing amplitudes with Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY)\nformulation, individual terms in the intermediate steps will contribute\nhigher-order poles. In this paper, we investigate the cancelation of\nhigher-order poles in CHY formula with Pfaffian as the building block. We\ndevelop a diagrammatic rule for expanding the reduced Pfaffian. Then by\norganizing diagrams in appropriate groups and applying the cross-ratio\nidentities, we show that all potential contributions to higher-order poles in\nthe reduced Pfaffian are canceled out, i.e., only single poles survive in\nYang-Mills theory and gravity. Furthermore, we show the cancelations of\nhigher-order poles in other field theories by introducing appropriate\ntruncations, based on the single pole structure of Pfaffian.\n", "  We revisit a one-parameter family of three-dimensional gauge theories with\nknown supergravity duals. We show that three infrared behaviors are possible.\nFor generic values of the parameter, the theories exhibit a mass gap but no\nconfinement, meaning no linear quark-antiquark potential; for one limiting\nvalue of the parameter the theory flows to an infrared fixed point; and for\nanother limiting value it exhibits both a mass gap and confinement. Theories\nclose to these limiting values exhibit quasi-conformal and quasi-confining\ndynamics, respectively. Eleven-dimensional supergravity provides a simple,\ngeometric explanation of these features.\n", "  The article reports on light enhancement by structural resonances in linear\nperiodic arrays of identical dielectric elements. As the basic elements both\nspheres and rods with circular cross section have been considered. In either\ncase, it has been demonstrated that high-$Q$ structural resonant modes\noriginated from bound states in the continuum enable near-field amplitude\nenhancement by factor of $10$--$25$ in the red-to-near infrared range in lossy\nsilicon. The asymptotic behavior of the $Q$-factor with the number of elements\nin the array is explained theoretically by analyzing quasi-bound states\npropagation bands.\n", "  In the light of the 125 GeV Higgs ($h$) discovery at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC), one of the primary goals of the LHC and possible future\ncolliders is to understand its interactions more precisely. Here we have\nstudied the $h$-$b$-$\\bar b$-$\\gamma$ effective interaction terms arising out\nof gauge invariant dimension six operators in a model independent setting, as a\npotential source of new physics. Their role in some detectable final states\nhave been compared with those coming from anomalous $h$-$b$-$\\bar b$\ninteractions. We have considered the bounds coming from the existing collider\nand other low energy experimental data in order to derive constraints on the\npotential new physics couplings and predict possible collider signals for the\ntwo different new physics scenarios in the context of 14 TeV LHC and and a\nfuture $e^+e^-$ machine. We conclude that the anomalous $h$-$b$-$\\bar\nb$-$\\gamma$ coupling can be probed at the LHC at 14 TeV at the 3$\\sigma$ level\nwith an integrated luminosity of $\\sim 2000~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$, which an $e^+e^-$\ncollider can probe at the 3$\\sigma$ level with $\\sim 12(7)~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ at\n$\\sqrt{s}=250(500)~{\\rm GeV}$. It is also found that anomalous $h$-$b$-$\\bar b$\ninteractions, subject to the existing LHC constraints, can not compete with the\nrates driven by $h$-$b$-$\\bar b$-$\\gamma$ effective interactions.\n", "  We give a systematic procedure to evaluate conformal partial waves involving\nsymmetric tensors for an arbitrary CFT$_d$ using geodesic Witten diagrams in\nAdS$_{d+1}$. Using this procedure we discuss how to draw a line between the\ntensor structures in the CFT and cubic interactions in AdS. We contrast this\nmap to known results using three-point Witten diagrams: the maps obtained via\nvolume versus geodesic integrals differ. Despite these differences, we show how\nto decompose four-point exchange Witten diagrams in terms of geodesic diagrams,\nand we discuss the product expansion of local bulk fields in AdS.\n", "  A ~545 mW single-frequency tunable 520 nm green laser has been demonstrated\nusing a periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) bulk crystal\nbased on single-pass third-harmonic generation (THG) of a 1560 nm laser via\nsingle-pass second-harmonic generation (SHG) followed by single-pass\nsum-frequency generation (SFG). In single-pass SHG, two cascaded\nperiodically-poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate (PPMgO:LN) crystals\nwere used, and ~3.5 W 780.25 nm doubled laser output is produced, corresponding\nto maximum doubling efficiency of 26.8%. The system can provide a pump source\n(520 nm) for an optical parametric oscillator for two-color entangled\ncontinuous-variable optical field generation at 1560 and 780 nm and two-color\nlocal oscillators for homodyne detection.\n", "  In the domain of quantum degenerate atomic gases, much interest has been\nraised recently by the use of Lanthanide atoms with large magnetic moments, in\nparticular Dysprosium and Erbium. These species have been successfully brought\nto quantum degeneracy and are now excellent candidates for quantum simulations\nof physical phenom- ena due to long-range interactions. In this short article,\nwe report on the progresses in the construction of a new experiment on\nBose-Einstein condensation of Dysprosium atoms. After completing the vacuum and\nthe laser setups, a magneto-optical trap on the narrow 626nm 162Dy transition\nhas been realized and characterized. The prospects for future experiments are\nbrie y discussed.\n", "  Interfacial charge separation and recombination at heterojunctions of\nmonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are of interest to two\ndimensional optoelectronic technologies. These processes can involve large\nchanges in parallel momentum vector due to the confinement of electrons and\nholes to the K-valleys in each layer. Since these high-momentum valleys are\nusually not aligned across the interface of two TMDC monolayers, how parallel\nmomentum is conserved in the charge separation or recombination process becomes\na key question. Here we probe this question using the model system of a type-II\nheterojunction formed by MoS2 and WSe2 monolayers and the experimental\ntechnical of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. Upon photo-excitation\nspecifically of WSe2 at the heterojunction, we observe ultrafast (<40 fs)\nelectron transfer from WSe2 to MoS2, independent of the angular alignment and,\nthus, momentum mismatch between the two TMDCs. The resulting interlayer charge\ntransfer exciton decays via nonradiatively recombination, with rates varying by\nup to three-orders of magnitude from sample to sample, but with no correlation\nwith inter-layer angular alignment. We suggest that the initial interfacial\ncharge separation and the subsequent interfacial charge recombination processes\ncircumvent momentum mismatch via excess electronic energy and via\ndefect-mediated recombination, respectively.\n", "  The leptonic widths of high $\\psi$-resonances are calculated in a\ncoupled-channel model with unitary inelasticity, where analytical expressions\nfor mixing angles between $(n+1)\\,^3S_1$ and $n\\,^3D_1$ states and\nprobabilities $Z_i$ of the $c\\bar c$ component are derived. Since these factors\ndepend on energy (mass), different values of mixing angles\n$\\theta(\\psi(4040))=27.7^\\circ$ and $\\theta(\\psi(4160))=29.5^\\circ$,\n$Z_1\\,(\\psi(4040))=0.76$, and $Z_2\\,(\\psi(4160))=0.62$ are obtained. It gives\nthe leptonic widths $\\Gamma_{ee}(\\psi(4040))=Z_1\\, 1.17=0.89$~keV,\n$\\Gamma_{ee}(\\psi(4160))=Z_2\\, 0.76=0.47$~keV in good agreement with\nexperiment. For $\\psi(4415)$ the leptonic width\n$\\Gamma_{ee}(\\psi(4415))=~0.55$~keV is calculated, while for the missing\nresonance $\\psi(4510)$ we predict $M(\\psi(4500))=(4515\\pm 5)$~MeV and\n$\\Gamma_{ee}(\\psi(4510)) \\cong 0.50$~keV.\n", "  We use a recently proposed holographic Kondo model as a well-understood\nexample of AdS/boundary CFT (BCFT) duality, and show explicitly that in this\nmodel the bulk volume decreases along the RG flow. We then obtain a proof that\nthis volume loss is indeed a generic feature of AdS/BCFT models of the type\nproposed by Takayanagi in 2011. According to recent proposals holographically\nrelating bulk volume to such quantities as complexity or fidelity\nsusceptibility in the dual field theory, this suggests the existence of a\ncomplexity or fidelity susceptibility analogue of the Affleck-Ludwig g-theorem,\nwhich famously states the decrease of boundary entropy along the RG flow of a\nBCFT. We comment on this possibility.\n", "  The Darboux transformation between ordinary differential equations is a 19th\ncentury technique that has seen wide use in quantum theory for producing\nexactly solvable potentials for the Schr\\\"odinger equation with specific\nspectral properties. In this paper we show that the same transformation appears\nin black hole theory, relating, for instance, the Zerilli and Regge-Wheeler\nequations for axial and polar Schwarzschild perturbations. The transformation\nreveals these two equations to be isospectral, a well known result whose method\nhas been repeatedly reintroduced under different names. We highlight the key\nrole that the so-called algebraically special solutions play in the black hole\nDarboux theory and show that a similar relation exists between the\nChandrasekhar-Detweiler equations for Kerr perturbations. Finally, we discuss\nthe limitations of the method when dealing with long-range potentials and\nexplore the possibilities offered by a generalised Darboux transformation.\n", "  Channeling properties and radiation spectra are studied on the grounds of\nnumerical simulations for the 855 MeV electrons in a periodically bent diamond\ncrystal. The bent crystalline profiles are shown to enhance the re-channeling\nof the projectiles and to produce distinct lines in the radiation spectra. The\nresults obtained are analyzed and contrasted to the properties of the planar\nchanneling and of the channeling in uniformly bent crystals.\n", "  Double parton scattering in proton-proton collisions includes kinematic\nregions in which two partons inside a proton originate from the perturbative\nsplitting of a single parton. This leads to a double counting problem between\nsingle and double hard scattering. We present a solution to this problem, which\nallows for the definition of double parton distributions as operator matrix\nelements in a proton, and which can be used at higher orders in perturbation\ntheory. We show how the evaluation of double hard scattering in this framework\ncan provide a rough estimate for the size of the higher-order contributions to\nsingle hard scattering that are affected by double counting. In a numeric\nstudy, we identify situations in which these higher-order contributions must be\nexplicitly calculated and included if one wants to attain an accuracy at which\ndouble hard scattering becomes relevant, and other situations where such\ncontributions may be neglected.\n", "  We discuss a new technique to evaluate integrals of QCD Green's functions in\nthe Euclidean based on their Mellin-Barnes representation. We present as a\nfirst application the evaluation of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum\nPolarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\n$\\frac{1}{2}(g_{\\mu}-2)_{\\rm\\tiny HVP}\\equiv a_{\\mu}^{\\rm HVP}$. It is shown\nthat with a precise determination of the slope and curvature of the HVP\nfunction at the origin from lattice QCD (LQCD), one can already obtain a result\nfor $a_{\\mu}^{\\rm HVP}$ which may serve as a test of the determinations based\non experimental measurements of the $e^+ e^-$ annihilation cross-section into\nhadrons.\n", "  Cholesteric liquid crystals experience geometric frustration when they are\nconfined between surfaces with anchoring conditions that are incompatible with\nthe cholesteric twist. Because of this frustration, they develop complex\ntopological defect structures, which may be helicoids or skyrmions. We develop\na theory for these structures, which extends previous theoretical research by\nderiving exact solutions for helicoids with the assumption of constant azimuth,\ncalculating numerical solutions for helicoids and skyrmions with varying\nazimuth, and interpreting the results in terms of competition between terms in\nthe free energy.\n", "  We study the focus-focus type of monodromy in an integrable version of the\nDicke model. Classical orbits forming a pinched torus represent analogues of\nthe dynamic superradiance under conditions of a closed system. Quantum\nsignatures of monodromy appear in lattices of expectation values of various\nquantities in the Hamiltonian eigenstates and are related to an excited-state\nquantum phase transition. We demonstrate the breakdown of these structures with\nan increasing strength of non-integrable perturbation.\n", "  We analyse the recent hints of Lepton Flavor Universality violations in\nsemi-leptonic $B$ decays within a general EFT based on a $U(2)^n$ flavor\nsymmetry acting on the light generations of SM fermions. We analyse in\nparticular the consistency of these anomalies with the tight constraints on\nvarious low-energy observables in $B$ and $\\tau$ physics. We show that, with a\nmoderate fine-tuning, a consistent picture for all low-energy observables can\nbe obtained under the additional dynamical assumption that the NP sector is\ncoupled preferentially to third generation SM fermions. We discuss how this\ndynamical assumption can be implemented in general terms within the EFT, and we\nidentify a series of observables in $\\tau$ decays which could provide further\nevidences of this NP framework.\n", "  We propose a new prescription for computing the Nekrasov partition functions\nof five-dimensional theories with eight supercharges realized by gauging\nnon-perturbative flavor symmetries of three five-dimensional superconformal\nfield theories. The topological vertex formalism gives a way to compute the\npartition functions of the matter theories with flavor instanton backgrounds,\nand the gauging is achieved by summing over Young diagrams. We apply the\nprescription to calculate the Nekrasov partition functions of various\nfive-dimensional gauge theories such as $\\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ gauge theories with\nor without hypermultiplets in the vector representation and also pure $E_6,\nE_7, E_8$ gauge theories. Furthermore, the technique can be applied to\ncomputations of the Nekrasov partition functions of five-dimensional theories\nwhich arise from circle compactifications of six-dimensional minimal\nsuperconformal field theories characterized by the gauge groups\n$\\mathrm{SU}(3), \\mathrm{SO}(8), E_6, E_7, E_8$. We exemplify our method by\ncomparing some of the obtained partition functions with known results and find\nperfect agreement. We also present a prescription of extending the gluing rule\nto the refined topological vertex.\n", "  Vector boson-tagged jet production in collisions of heavy nuclei opens new\nopportunities to study parton shower formation and propagation in strongly\ninteracting matter. It has been argued to provide a golden channel that can\nconstrain the energy loss of jets in the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy\nion reactions. We present theoretical results for isolated photon-tagged and\n$Z^0$ boson-tagged jet production in Pb+Pb collisions with $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =\n5.02$ TeV at the LHC. Specifically, we evaluate the transverse momentum\nimbalance ${\\rm x_{JV}}$ distribution and nuclear modification factor ${\\rm\nI_{AA}}$ of tagged jets and compare our theoretical calculations to recent\nexperimental measurements by ATLAS and CMS collaborations. Our analysis, which\nincludes both collisional and radiative energy losses, sheds light on their\nrelative importance versus the strength of jet-medium interactions and helps\nquantify the amount of out-of-cone radiation of predominantly prompt\nquark-initiated jets.\n", "  We study a heretofore ignored class of spiral patterns for oscillatory media\nas characterized by the complex Landau-Ginzburg model. These spirals emerge\nfrom modulating the growth rate as a function of $r$, thereby turning off the\ninstability. These spirals are uniquely determined by matching to those outer\nconditions, lifting a degeneracy in the set of steady-state solutions of the\noriginal equations. Unlike the well-studied spiral which acts a wave source,\nhas a simple core structure and is insensitive to the details of the boundary\non which no-flux conditions are imposed, these new spirals are wave sinks, have\nnon-monotonic wavefront curvature near the core, and can be patterned by the\nform of the spatial boundary. We predict that these anomalous spirals could be\nproduced in nonlinear optics experiments via spatially modulating the gain of\nthe medium.\n", "  Black holes, initially thought of as very interesting geometric constructions\nof nature, over time, have learnt to (often) come up with surprises and\nchallenges. From the era of being described as merely some interesting and\nexotic solutions of \\gr, they have, in modern times, really started to test our\nconfidence in everything else, we thought we know about the nature. They have\nin this process, also earned a dreadsome reputation in some corners of\ntheoretical physics. The most serious charge on the black holes is that they\neat up information, never to release and subsequently erase it. This goes\nabsolutely against the sacred principles of all other branches of fundamental\nsciences. This realization has shaken the very base of foundational concepts,\nboth in quantum theory and gravity, which we always took for granted. Attempts\nto exorcise black holes of this charge, have led us to crossroads with\nconcepts, hold dearly in quantum theory. The sphere of black hole's tussle with\nquantum theory has readily and steadily grown, from the advent of the Hawking\nradiation some four decades back, into domain of quantum information theory in\nmodern times, most aptly, recently put in the form of the firewall puzzle. Do\nblack holes really indicate something sinister about their existence or do they\nreally take the lid off our comfort with ignoring the fundamental issues, our\nmodern theories are seemingly plagued with? In this review, we focus on issues\npertaining to black hole evaporation, the development of the information loss\nparadox, its recent formulation, the leading debates and promising directions\nin the community.\n", "  Recent work has established the existence of stable quantum phases of matter\ndescribed by symmetric tensor gauge fields, which naturally couple to particles\nof restricted mobility, such as fractons. We focus on a minimal toy model of a\nrank 2 tensor gauge field, consisting of fractons coupled to an emergent\ngraviton (massless spin-2 excitation). We show how to reconcile the immobility\nof fractons with the expected gravitational behavior of the model. First, we\nreformulate the fracton phenomenon in terms of an emergent center of mass\nquantum number, and we show how an effective attraction arises from the\nprinciples of locality and conservation of center of mass. This interaction\nbetween fractons is always attractive and can be recast in geometric language,\nwith a geodesic-like formulation, thereby satisfying the expected properties of\na gravitational force. This force will generically be short-ranged, but we\ndiscuss how the power-law behavior of Newtonian gravity can arise under certain\nconditions. We then show that, while an isolated fracton is immobile, fractons\nare endowed with finite inertia by the presence of a large-scale distribution\nof other fractons, in a concrete manifestation of Mach's principle. Our\nformalism provides suggestive hints that matter plays a fundamental role, not\nonly in perturbing, but in creating the background space in which it\npropagates.\n", "  We study the generation of atom vortex beams in the case where an atomic\nwave-packet, moving in free space, is diffracted from a properly tailored light\nmask with a spiral transverse profile. We show how such a diffraction scheme\ncould lead to the production of an atomic Ferris wheel beam.\n", "  The alpha-particle energy deposition mechanism modifies the ignition\nconditions of the thermonuclear Deuterium-Tritium fusion reactions, and\nconstitutes a key issue in achieving high gain in Inertial Confinement Fusion\nimplosions. One-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations have been performed with\nthe code Multi-IFE [R. Ramis and J. Meyer-ter-Vehn, Comp. Phys. Comm. 203, 226\n(2016)] to simulate the implosion of a capsule directly irradiated by a laser\nbeam. The diffusion approximation for the alpha energy deposition has been used\nto optimize three laser profiles corresponding to different implosion\nvelocities. A Monte-Carlo package has been included in Multi-IFE to calculate\nthe alpha energy transport, and in this case the energy deposition uses both\nthe LP [C.K. Li and R.D. Petrasso, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 3059 (1993)] and the\nBPS [L.S. Brown, D.L. Preston, and R.L. Singleton Jr., Phys. Rep. 410, 237\n(2005)] stopping power models. Homothetic transformations that maintain a\nconstant implosion velocity have been used to map out the transition region\nbetween marginally-igniting and high-gain configurations. The results provided\nby the two models have been compared and it is found that - close to the\nignition threshold - in order to produce the same fusion energy, the\ncalculations performed with the BPS model require about 10% more invested\nenergy with respect to the LP model.\n", "  Surface defects created and probed with scanning tunneling microscopes are a\npromising platform for atomic-scale electronics and quantum information\ntechnology applications. Using first-principles calculations we demonstrate how\nto engineer dangling bond (DB) defects on hydrogenated Si(100) surfaces, which\ngive rise to isolated impurity states that can be used in atomic-scale devices.\nIn particular we show that sample thickness and biaxial strain can serve as\ncontrol parameters to design the electronic properties of DB defects. While in\nthick Si samples the neutral DB state is resonant with bulk valence bands,\nultrathin samples (1-2 nm) lead to an isolated impurity state in the gap;\nsimilar behavior is seen for DB pairs and DB wires. Strain further isolates the\nDB from the valence band, with the response to strain heavily dependent on\nsample thickness. These findings suggest new methods for tuning the properties\nof defects on surfaces for electronic and quantum information applications.\nFinally, we present a consistent and unifying interpretation of many results\npresented in the literature for DB defects on hydrogenated silicon surfaces,\nrationalizing apparent discrepancies between different experiments and\nsimulations.\n", "  As of today, more than 2500 pulsars have been found, nearly all in the Milky\nWay, with the exception of ~28 pulsars in the Small and Large Magellanic\nClouds. However, there have been few published attempts to search for pulsars\ndeeper in our Galactic neighborhood. Two of the more promising Local Group\ngalaxies are IC 10 and NGC 6822 (also known as Barnard's Galaxy) due to their\nrelatively high star formation rate and their proximity to our galaxy. IC 10 in\nparticular, holds promise as it is the closest starburst galaxy to us and\nharbors an unusually high number of Wolf-Rayet stars, implying the presence of\nmany neutron stars. We observed IC 10 and NGC 6822 at 820 MHz with the Green\nBank Telescope for ~15 and 5 hours respectively, and put a strong upper limit\nof 0.1 mJy on pulsars in either of the two galaxies. We also performed single\npulse searches of both galaxies with no firm detections.\n", "  We demonstrate a new technique for detecting components of arbitrarily-shaped\nradio-frequency waveforms based on stroboscopic back-action evading\nmeasurements. We combine quantum non-demolition measurements and stroboscopic\nprobing to detect waveform components with magnetic sensitivity beyond the\nstandard quantum limit. Using an ensemble of $1.5\\times 10^6$ cold rubidium\natoms, we demonstrate entanglement-enhanced sensing of sinusoidal and linearly\nchirped waveforms, with 1.0(2)dB and 0.8(3)dB metrologically relevant noise\nreduction, respectively. We achieve volume-adjusted sensitivity of\n$\\delta\\rm{B}\\sqrt{V}\\approx 11.20~\\rm{fT\\sqrt{cm^3/Hz}}$, comparable to the\nbest RF~magnetometers.\n", "  Polarized neutrons are a powerful probe to investigate magnetism in condensed\nmatter on length scales from single atomic distances to micrometers. With the\nongoing advancement of neutron optics, that allow to transport beams with\nincreased divergence, the demands on neutron polarizes and analyzers have grown\nas well. The situation becomes especially challenging for new instruments at\npulsed sources, where a large wavelength band needs to be polarized to make\nefficient use of the time structure of the beam.\n  Here we present a polarization analysis concept for highly focused neutron\nbeams that is based on transmission supermirrors that are bend in the shape of\nequiangular spirals. The method allows polarizations above 95\\% and good\ntransmission, without negative impact on other beam characteristics. An example\nof a compact polarizing device already tested on the AMOR reflectometer is\npresented as well as the concept for the next generation implementation of the\ntechnique that will be installed on the Estia instrument being build for the\nEuropean Spallation Source.\n", "  Efficient allocation of limited medical resources is crucial for controlling\nepidemic spreading on networks. Based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible\nmodel, we solve an optimization problem as how best to allocate the limited\nresources so as to minimize the prevalence, providing that the curing rate of\neach node is positively correlated to its medical resource. By quenched\nmean-field theory and heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theory, we prove that\nepidemic outbreak will be suppressed to the greatest extent if the curing rate\nof each node is directly proportional to its degree, under which the effective\ninfection rate $\\lambda$ has a maximal threshold\n$\\lambda_c^{opt}=1/\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle$ where $\\left\\langle k\n\\right\\rangle$ is average degree of the underlying network. For weak infection\nregion ($\\lambda\\gtrsim\\lambda_c^{opt}$), we combine a perturbation theory with\nLagrange multiplier method (LMM) to derive the analytical expression of optimal\nallocation of the curing rates and the corresponding minimized prevalence. For\ngeneral infection region ($\\lambda>\\lambda_c^{opt}$), the high-dimensional\noptimization problem is converted into numerically solving low-dimensional\nnonlinear equations by the HMF theory and LMM. Counterintuitively, in the\nstrong infection region the low-degree nodes should be allocated more medical\nresources than the high-degree nodes to minimize the prevalence. Finally, we\nuse simulated annealing to validate the theoretical results.\n", "  We consider transition to strong turbulence in an infinite fluid stirred by a\ngaussian random force. The transition is {\\bf defined} as a first appearance of\nanomalous scaling of normalized moments of velocity derivatives (dissipation\nrates) emerging from the low-Reynolds-number Gaussian background. It is shown\nthat due to multi-scaling, strongly intermittent rare events can be\nquantitatively described in terms of an infinite number of different \"Reynolds\nnumbers\" reflecting multitude of anomalous scaling exponents. The theoretically\npredicted transition disappears at $R_{\\lambda}\\leq 3$. The developed theory,\nis in a quantitative agreement with the outcome of large-scale numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  We investigate theoretically an interacting metallic wire with a strong\nmagnetic field directed along its length and show that it is a new and highly\ntunable one-dimensional system. By considering a suitable change in spatial\ngeometry, we map the problem in the zeroth Landau level with Landau level\ndegeneracy $N$ to one-dimensional fermions with an $N$-component pseudospin\ndegree of freedom and $SU(2)$-symmetric interactions. This mapping allows us to\nestablish the phase diagram as a function of the interactions for small $N$\n(and make conjectures for large $N$) using renormalization group and\nbosonization techniques. We find pseudospin-charge separation with a gapless\n$U(1)$ charge sector and several possible strong-coupling phases in the\npseudospin sector. For odd $N$, we find a fluctuating pseudospin-singlet charge\ndensity wave phase and a fluctuating pseudospin-singlet superconducting phase\nwhich are topologically distinct. For even $N>2$, similar phases exist,\nalthough they are not topologically distinct, and an additional, novel\npseudospin-gapless phase appears. We discuss experimental conditions for\nobserving our proposals.\n", "  We develop a systematic framework to compute the conformal partial wave\nexpansions (CPWEs) of tree-level four-point Witten diagrams with totally\nsymmetric external fields of arbitrary mass and integer spin in AdS$_{d+1}$.\nEmploying this framework, we determine the CPWE of a generic exchange Witten\ndiagram with spinning exchanged field. As an intermediate step, we diagonalise\nthe linear map between spinning three-point conformal structures and spinning\ncubic couplings in AdS. As a concrete application, we compute all exchange\ndiagrams in the type A higher-spin gauge theory on AdS$_{d+1}$, which is\nconjectured to be dual to the free scalar $O\\left(N\\right)$ model. Given a\nCFT$_d$, our results provide the complete holographic reconstruction of all\ncubic couplings involving totally symmetric fields in the putative dual theory\non AdS$_{d+1}$.\n", "  We theoretically study the transmission properties of a stack of metallic\nmetamaterials and show that is able to achieve a perfect transmission\nselectively exhibiting broadband ($Q<10$) or extremely narrowband ($Q>10^5$)\npolarization rotation. We especially highlight how the arrangement of the\nstacked structure, as well as the metamaterial unit cell geometry, can highly\ninfluence the transmission in the spectral domain. For this purpose, we use an\nextended analytical Jones formalism that allows us to get a rigorous and\nanalytical expression of the transmission. Such versatile structures could find\npotential applications in polarimetry or in the control of the light\npolarization for THz waves.\n", "  Multi-messenger astronomy can help to investigate the sources of the\nhigh-energy neutrinos observed by the high-energy neutrino telescope IceCube.\nWe consider the hypothesis that the highest energy neutrinos are produced by BL\nLacs, arguing that this is not contradicted severely by any known fact. We\ncheck the BL Lac hypothesis by searching for correlations between the\nthrough-going muon events of IceCube and the BL Lacs of the second catalog of\nFermi-LAT (2FHL). We expect 10.2 $\\pm$ 2.4 correlated events but we find that\njust 1 event has a BL Lac as counterpart. We also assess the probability of\nobserving one multiplet from the same source, finding that the present null\nresult is not yet of critical significance. We conclude that the hypothesis\nthat the BL Lacs are the main emitters of the highest-energy neutrinos observed\nby IceCube is disfavored at 3.7{\\sigma}. We discuss implications and possible\nways out; for example, this could work if the angular resolution was 4{\\deg},\nwhich is much more than expected.\n", "  Spatial patterns arising spontaneously due to internal processes are\nubiquitous in nature, varying from regular patterns of dryland vegetation to\ncomplex structures of bacterial colonies. Many of these patterns can be\nexplained in the context of a Turing instability, where patterns emerge due to\ntwo locally interacting components that diffuse with different speeds in the\nmedium. Turing patterns are multistable, such that many different patterns with\ndifferent wavelengths are possible for the same set of parameters, but in a\ngiven region typically only one such wavelength is dominant. In the Turing\ninstability region, random initial conditions will mostly lead to a wavelength\nthat is similar to that of the leading eigenvector that arises from the linear\nstability analysis, but when venturing beyond, little is known about the\npattern that will emerge. Using dryland vegetation as a case study, we use\ndifferent models of drylands ecosystems to study the wavelength pattern that is\nselected in various scenarios beyond the Turing instability region, focusing\nthe phenomena of localized states and repeated local disturbances.\n", "  An optical etalon illuminated by a white light source provides a broadband\ncomb-like spectrum that can be employed as a calibration source for\nastronomical spectrographs in radial velocity (RV) surveys for extrasolar\nplanets. For this application the frequency stability of the etalon is\ncritical, as its transmission spectrum is susceptible to frequency fluctuations\ndue to changes in cavity temperature, optical power and input polarization. In\nthis paper we present a laser frequency comb measurement technique to\ncharacterize the frequency stability of a custom-designed fiber Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer (FFP). Simultaneously probing the stability of two etalon\nresonance modes, we assess both the absolute stability of the etalon and the\nlong-term stability of the cavity dispersion. We measure mode positions with\nMHz precision, which corresponds to splitting the FFP resonances by a part in\n500 and to RV precision of ~1 m/s. We address limiting systematic effects,\nincluding the presence of parasitic etalons, that need to be overcome to push\nthe metrology of this system to the equivalent RV precision of 10 cm/s. Our\nresults demonstrate a means to characterize environmentally-driven\nperturbations of etalon resonance modes across broad spectral bandwidths, as\nwell as motivate the benefits and challenges of FFPs as spectrograph\ncalibrators.\n", "  Numerical results, based on a lattice method for computational general\nrelativity, will be presented for Cauchy evolution of initial data for the\nBrill, Teukolsky and polarised Gowdy space-times. The simple objective of this\npaper is to demonstrate that the lattice method can, at least for these\nspace-times, match results obtained from contemporary methods. Some of the\nissues addressed in this paper include the handling of axisymmetric\ninstabilities (in the Brill space-time) and an implementation of a Sommerfeld\nradiation condition for the Brill and Teukolsky space-times. It will be shown\nthat the lattice method performs particularly well in regard to the passage of\nthe waves through the outer boundary. Questions concerning multiple\nblack-holes, mesh refinement and long term stability will not be discussed here\nbut may form the basis of future work.\n", "  We present results about photons production in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions. The main novelty of our study is the calculation of the\ncontribution of the early stage photons to the photon spectrum. The initial\nstage is modeled by an ensemble of classical gluon fields which decay to a\nquark-gluon plasma via the Schwinger mechanism, and the evolution of the system\nis studied by coupling classical field equations to relativistic kinetic\ntheory; photons production is then computed by including the pertinent\ncollision processes into the collision integral. We find that the contribution\nof the early stage photons to the direct photon spectrum is substantial for\n$p_T \\approx 2$ GeV and higher, the exact value depending on the collision\nenergy; therefore we identify this part of the photon spectrum as the sign of\nthe early stage. Moreover, the amount of photons produced during the early\nstage is not negligible with respect to those produced by a thermalized\nquark-gluon plasma: we support the idea that there is no dark age in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We study analytically and numerically the optical analogue of the\nJackiw-Rebbi states in quantum field theory. These solutions exist at the\ninterface of two binary waveguide arrays which are described by two Dirac\nequations with opposite sign masses. We show that these special states are\ntopologically robust not only in the linear regime, but also in nonlinear\nregimes (with both focusing and de-focusing nonlinearity). We also reveal that\none can generate the Jackiw-Rebbi states starting from Dirac solitons.\n", "  We study properties of 2+1-flavor QCD in the imaginary chemical potential\nregion by using two approaches. One is a theoretical approach based on QCD\npartition function, and the other is a qualitative one based on the\nPolyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. In the theoretical\napproach, we clarify conditions imposed on the imaginary chemical potentials\n$\\mu_{f}=i\\theta_{f}T$ to realize the Roberge-Weiss (RW) periodicity. We also\nshow that the RW periodicity is broken if anyone of $\\theta_{f}$ is fixed to a\nconstant value. In order to visualize the condition, we use the PNJL model as a\nmodel possessing the RW periodicity, and draw the phase diagram as a function\nof $\\theta_{u}=\\theta_{d}\\equiv \\theta_{l}$ for two conditions of\n$\\theta_{s}=\\theta_{l}$ and $\\theta_{s}=0$. We also consider two cases,\n$(\\mu_{u},\\mu_{d},\\mu_{s}) =(i\\theta_{u}T,iC_{1}T,0)$ and\n$(\\mu_{u},\\mu_{d},\\mu_{s})=(iC_{2}T,iC_{2}T,i\\theta_{s}T)$; here $C_{1}$ and\n$C_{2}$ are dimensionless constants, whereas $\\theta_{u}$ and $\\theta_{s}$ are\ntreated as variables. For some choice of $C_{1}$ ($C_{2}$), the number density\nof up (strange) quark becomes smooth in the entire region of $\\theta_{u}$\n($\\theta_{s}$) even in high $T$ region.\n", "  We compare two approaches in modeling repulsive interactions among hadrons:\nthe excluded volume approximation and the S-matrix formalism. These are applied\nto study the thermodynamics of the $\\pi N \\Delta$ system. It is shown that the\nintroduction of an extraneous repulsion between pions and nucleons via the\nexcluded volume approach, in addition to the interaction that generates the\n$\\Delta$-resonance, is incompatible with the analysis based on the physical\nphase shift of pion-nucleon scattering in the $P_{33}$ channel. This finding\nsuggests that the repulsive force between hadrons is interaction-channel\ndependent and is hence unlikely to be captured by a single phenomenological\nparameter. The S-matrix approach employed here can be used, however, to provide\nuseful estimates of the magnitude of the effective eigenvolume.\n", "  We investigate the cooling produced by a loss process non selective in energy\non a one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with repulsive contact interactions in the\nquasi-condensate regime. By performing nonlinear classical field calculations\nfor a homogeneous system, we show that the gas reaches a non-thermal state\nwhere different modes have acquired different temperatures. After losses have\nbeen turned off, this state is robust with respect to the nonlinear dynamics,\ndescribed by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We argue that the integrability of\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation is linked to the existence of such long-lived\nnon-thermal states, and illustrate this by showing that such states are not\nsupported within a non-integrable model of two coupled 1D gases of different\nmasses. We go beyond a classical field analysis, taking into account the\nquantum noise introduced by the discreteness of losses, and show that the\nnon-thermal state is still produced and its non-thermal character is even\nenhanced. Finally, we extend the discussion to gases trapped in a harmonic\npotential and present experimental observations of a long-lived non-thermal\nstate within a trapped 1D quasi-condensate following an atom loss process.\n", "  Macroscopic magnetic dipoles are considered as cosmic dark matter. Permanent\nmagnetism in relativistic field structures can involve some form of\nsuperconductivity, one example being current-carrying string loops (`springs')\nwith vanishing net tension. We derive the cross section for free classical\ndipoles to collide, finding it depends weakly on orientation when mutual\nprecession is rapid. The collision rate of `spring' loops with tension ${\\cal\nT} \\sim 10^{-8}c^4/G$ in galactic halos approaches the measured rate of fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) if the loops comprise most of the dark matter. A large\nsuperconducting dipole (LSD) with mass $\\sim 10^{20}$ g and size $\\sim 1$ mm\nwill form a $\\sim 100$ km magnetosphere moving through interstellar plasma.\nAlthough hydromagnetic drag is generally weak, it is strong enough to capture\nsome LSDs into long-lived rings orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that\nform by the direct collapse of massive gas clouds. Repeated collisions near\nyoung SMBHs could dominate the global collision rate, thereby broadening the\ndipole mass spectrum. Colliding LSDs produce tiny, hot electromagnetic\nexplosions. The accompanying paper shows that these explosions couple\neffectively to propagating low-frequency electromagnetic modes, with output\npeaking at 0.01-1 THz. We describe several constraints on, and predictions of,\nLSDs as cosmic dark matter. The shock formed by an infalling LSD triggers\nself-sustained thermonuclear burning in a C/O (ONeMg) white dwarf (WD) of mass\n$\\gtrsim 1\\,M_\\odot$ ($1.3\\,M_\\odot$). The spark is generally located well off\nthe center of the WD. The rate of LSD-induced explosions matches the observed\nrate of Type Ia supernovae.\n", "  PANDORA, Plasmas for Astrophysics, Nuclear Decays Observation and Radiation\nfor Archaeometry, is planned as a new facility based on a state-of-the-art\nplasma trap confining energetic plasma for performing interdisciplinary\nresearch in the fields of Nuclear Astrophysics, Astrophysics, Plasma Physics\nand Applications in Material Science and Archaeometry: the plasmas become the\nenvironment for measuring nuclear decays rates in stellar-like condition (such\nas 7Be decay and beta-decay involved in s-process nucleosynthesis), especially\nas a function of the ionization state of the plasma ions. These studies are of\nparamount importance for addressing several astrophysical issues in both\nstellar and primordial nucleosynthesis environment (e.g. determination of solar\nneutrino flux and 7Li Cosmological Problem), moreover the confined energetic\nplasma will be a unique light source for high performance stellar spectroscopy\nmeasurements in the visible, UV and X-ray domains, offering advancements in\nobservational astronomy. As to magnetic fields, the experimental validation of\ntheoretical first and second order Land\\'e factors will drive the layout of\nnext generation polarimetric units for the high resolution spectrograph of the\nfuture giant telescopes. In PANDORA new plasma heating methods will be\nexplored, that will push forward the ion beam output, in terms of extracted\nintensity and charge states. More, advanced and optimized injection methods of\nions in an ECR plasma will be experimented, with the aim at optimizing its\ncapture efficiency. This will be applied to the ECR-based Charge Breeding\ntechnique, that will improve the performances of the SPES ISOL-facility\ncurrently installed at Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro-INFN. Finally, PANDORA\nwill be suitable for energy conversion, making the plasma as a source of\nelectromagnetic radiation, for applications in Material Science and\nArchaeometry.\n", "  We study charge transport through a floating mesoscopic superconductor\ncoupled to counterpropagating fractional quantum Hall edges at filling fraction\n$\\nu=2/3$. We consider a superconducting island with finite charging energy and\ninvestigate its effect on transport through the device. We calculate\nconductance through such a system as a function of temperature and gate voltage\napplied to the superconducting island. We show that transport is strongly\naffected by the presence of parafermionic zero modes, leading at zero\ntemperature to a zero-bias conductance quantized in units of $\\nu e^2/h$\nindependent of the applied gate voltage.\n", "  A pedagogical introduction to the theory of a gaussian scalar field which\nshows firstly, how the whole theory is encapsulated in the Wightman function\n$W(x,y)=\\langle\\phi(x)\\phi(y)\\rangle$ regarded abstractly as a two-index tensor\non the vector space of (spacetime) field configurations, and secondly how one\ncan arrive at $W(x,y)$ starting from nothing but the retarded Green function\n$G(x,y)$. Conceiving the theory in this manner seems well suited to curved\nspacetimes and to causal sets. It makes it possible to provide a general\nspacetime region with a distinguished \"vacuum\" or \"ground state\", and to\nrecognize some interesting formal relationships, including a general condition\non $W(x,y)$ expressing zero-entropy or \"purity\".\n", "  We propose a new expression for the response of a quadrant detector using\nconvolution integrals. This expression is easier to evaluate by hand,\nexploiting the properties of the convolution. Computationally, it is also\npracticable to use since a large number of computer programs can right away\nevaluate convolutions. We use the new expression to obtain an analytical form\nof the response of a quadrant detector to a Gaussian beam and to\nHermite-Gaussian beams in general. We compare this analytic expression for the\nresponse for the Gaussian beam with the approximations from previous studies\nand with a response obtained through simulations. From the response, we also\nobtained an analytical form for the sensitivity of the quadrant detector to a\nGaussian beam. Lastly, we demonstrate the computational ease of using our new\nexpression for the response calculating the sensitivity of the quadrant\ndetector to the Bessel beam.\n", "  We present the results of an updated fit of short-baseline neutrino\noscillation data in the framework of 3+1 active-sterile neutrino mixing. We\nfirst consider $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$ disappearance in the light of the\nGallium and reactor anomalies. We discuss the implications of the recent\nmeasurement of the reactor $\\bar\\nu_e$ spectrum in the NEOS experiment, which\nshifts the allowed regions of the parameter space towards smaller values of\n$|U_{e4}|^2$. The beta-decay constraints allow us to limit the oscillation\nlength between about 2 cm and 7 m at $3\\sigma$ for neutrinos with an energy of\n1 MeV. We then consider the global fit of the data in the light of the LSND\nanomaly, taking into account the constraints from $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$\ndisappearance experiments, including the recent data of the MINOS and IceCube\nexperiments. The combination of the NEOS constraints on $|U_{e4}|^2$ and the\nMINOS and IceCube constraints on $|U_{\\mu4}|^2$ lead to an unacceptable\nappearance-disappearance tension which becomes tolerable only in a pragmatic\nfit which neglects the MiniBooNE low-energy anomaly. The minimization of the\nglobal $\\chi^2$ in the space of the four mixing parameters $\\Delta{m}^2_{41}$,\n$|U_{e4}|^2$, $|U_{\\mu4}|^2$, and $|U_{\\tau4}|^2$ leads to three allowed\nregions with narrow $\\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}$ widths at $ \\Delta m^2_{41} \\approx\n1.7 $ (best-fit), 1.3 (at $2\\sigma$), 2.4 (at $3\\sigma$) eV$^2$. The\nrestrictions of the allowed regions of the mixing parameters with respect to\nour previous global fits are mainly due to the NEOS constraints. We present a\ncomparison of the allowed regions of the mixing parameters with the\nsensitivities of ongoing experiments, which show that it is likely that these\nexperiments will determine in a definitive way if the reactor, Gallium and LSND\nanomalies are due to active-sterile neutrino oscillations or not.\n", "  In this paper, we consider two four-dimensional Horndeski-type gravity\ntheories with scalar fields that give rise to solutions with momentum\ndissipation in the dual boundary theories. Firstly, we study Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory with a Horndeski axion term and two additional free axions which are\nresponsible for momentum dissipation. We construct static electrically charged\nAdS planar black hole solutions in this theory and calculate analytically the\nholographic DC conductivity of the dual field theory. We then generalize the\nresults to include magnetic charge in the black hole solution. Secondly, we\nanalyze Einstein-Maxwell theory with two Horndeski axions which are used for\nmomentum dissipation. We obtain AdS planar black hole solutions in the theory\nand we calculate the holographic DC conductivity of the dual field theory. The\ntheory has a critical point $\\alpha + \\gamma \\Lambda = 0$, beyond which the\nkinetic terms of the Horndeski axions become ghost-like. The conductivity as a\nfunction of temperature behaves qualitatively like that of a conductor below\nthe critical point, becoming semiconductor-like at the critical point. Beyond\nthe critical point, the ghost-like nature of the Horndeski fields is associated\nwith the onset of unphysical singular or negative conductivities. Some further\ngeneralisations of the above theories are considered also.\n", "  The use of multifunctional composite materials adopting piezo-electric\nperiodic cellular lattice structures with auxetic elastic behavior is a recent\nand promising solution in the design of piezoelectric sensors. In the present\nwork, periodic anti-tetrachiral auxetic lattice structures, characterized by\ndifferent geometries, are taken into account and the mechanical and\npiezoelectrical response are investigated. The equivalent piezoelectric\nproperties are obtained adopting a first order computational homogenization\napproach, generalized to the case of electro-mechanical coupling, and various\npolarization directions are adopted. Two examples of in-plane and out-of-plane\nstrain sensors are proposed as design concepts. Moreover, a\npiezo-elasto-dynamic dispersion analysis adopting the Floquet-Bloch\ndecomposition is performed. The acoustic behavior of the periodic piezoelectric\nmaterial with auxetic topology is studied and possible band gaps are detected.\n", "  We report on the observation and numerical calculation of ionization spectra\nof highly Stark-shifted Rydberg states of rubidium beyond the classical\nionization threshold. In the numerical calculations, a complex absorbing\npotential (CAP) allows us to predict the energy levels and ionization rates of\nRydberg states in this regime. Our approach of adjusting the CAP to the\nexternal electric field reduces the number of free parameters from one per\nresonance to a single one. Furthermore, we have measured the ionization spectra\nof magneto-optically trapped rubidium atoms which are excited to principal\nquantum numbers of 43 and 70 at various electric fields. The emerging ions are\ndetected using an ion optics. We find good agreement between the numerically\nand experimentally obtained spectra.\n", "  Based on the recent proposal for the tetraquarks with the mixing scheme, we\ninvestigate fall-apart decays of $a_0(980), a_0(1450)$ into two lowest-lying\nmesons. This mixing scheme suggests that $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1450)$ are the\ntetraquarks with the mixtures of two spin configurations of diquark and\nantidiquark. Due to the relative sign differences in the mixtures, the\ncouplings of fall-apart decays into two mesons are strongly enhanced for\n$a_0(980)$ but suppressed for $a_0(1450)$. We report that this expectation is\nsupported by their experimental decays. In particular, the ratios of the\nassociated partial decay widths, which depend on some kinematical factors and\nthe couplings, are found to be around $\\Gamma [a_0(980)\\rightarrow \\pi\n\\eta]/\\Gamma [a_0(1450)\\rightarrow \\pi \\eta] = 2.51-2.54$, $\\Gamma\n[a_0(980)\\rightarrow K\\bar{K}]/\\Gamma [a_0(1450)\\rightarrow K\\bar{K}] =\n0.52-0.89$, which seems to agree with the experimental ratios reasonably well.\nThis agreement can be interpreted as the tetraquark signatures for $a_0(980),\na_0(1450)$.\n", "  Recent precision measurements of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR)\narrival directions, spectrum and parameters related to the mass of the primary\nparticle have been done by the HiRes, Pierre Auger and Telescope Array (TA)\nObservatories. In this paper, distributions of arrival directions of events in\nthe nearby Universe are assumed to correlate with sources in the 2MASS Redshift\nSurvey (2MRS), IRAS 1.2 Jy Survey, Palermo Swift-BAT and Swift-BAT catalogs,\nand the effect of the latitude of the observatory on the measurement of the\nenergy spectrum and on the capability of measuring anisotropy is studied. The\ndifferences between given latitudes on the northern and southern hemispheres\nare quantified. It is shown that the latitude of the observatory: a) has an\ninfluence on the total flux measured and b) imposes an important limitation on\nthe capability of measuring an anisotropic sky.\n", "  Nonlinear self-interaction of finite amplitude energetic particle induced\ngeodesic acoustic mode (EGAM) is investigated using nonlinear gyrokinetic\ntheory. It is found that both zero frequency zonal flow(ZFZF) and second\nharmonic can be driven by finite amplitude EGAM, with energetic particles (EPs)\nplaying a dominant role in the nonlinear couplings through finite orbit width\neffects. For ZFZF, the effects of EPs on EGAM nonlinear self-coupling dominate\nthat of the thermal plasmas which are also present; while the second harmonic\ngeneration is only possible via finite amplitude coupling though EPs. Our\nfindings may improve the understanding of stabilizing zonal modes, and\nconsequently, drift wave turbulence.\n", "  We revisit the numerical computation of the baryon asymmetry from Cold\nElectroweak Baryogenesis given the physical Higgs mass. We investigate the\ndependence of the asymmetry on the speed at which electroweak symmetry breaking\ntakes place. The maximum asymmetry does not occur for arbitrarily fast\nquenches, but at quench times of about $\\tau_q\\simeq 16\\, m_H^{-1}$, with no\nasymmetry created for quenches slower than $\\tau_q>30\\, m_H^{-1}$. Curiously,\nwe also find that the overall sign of the asymmetry depends on the quench time.\n", "  Molecules with C_N or C_Nh symmetry can absorb quanta of optical angular\nmomentum to generate twisted excitons with well-defined quasi-angular momenta\nof their own. Angular momentum is conserved in such interactions at the level\nof a paraxial approximation for the light beam. A sequence of absorption events\ncan thus be used to create a range of excitonic angular momenta. Subsequent\ndecay can produce radiation with a single angular momentum equal to that\naccumulated. Such molecules can thus be viewed as mediators for changing the\nangular momentum of light. This sidesteps the need to exploit nonlinear\nlight-matter interactions based on higher-order susceptibilities. A\ntight-binding paradigm is used to verify angular momentum conservation and\ndemonstrate how it can be exploited to change the angular momentum of light.\nThe approach is then extended to a time-dependent density functional theory\nsetting where the key results are shown to hold in a many-body, multi-level\nsetting.\n", "  We use the generalized Lugiato-Lefever model to investigate the phenomenon of\nKerr optical frequency comb generation when group-velocity dispersion is null.\nIn that case, the first dispersion term that plays a leading role is\nthird-order dispersion. We show that this term is sufficient to allow for the\nexistence of both bright and dark solitons. We identify the areas in the\nparameter space where both kind of solitons can be excited inside the\nresonator. We also unveil a phenomenon of hysteretic switching between these\ntwo types of solitons when the power of the pump laser is cyclically varied.\n", "  We study theoretically a chain of precessing classical magnetic impurities in\nan $s$-wave superconductor. Utilizing a rotating wave description, we derive an\neffective Hamiltonian that describes the emergent Shiba band. We find that this\nHamiltonian shows non-trivial topological properties, and we obtain the\ncorresponding topological phase diagrams both numerically and analytically. We\nshow that changing the precession frequency offers a control over topological\nphase transitions and the emergence of Majorana bound states. We propose\ndriving the magnetic impurities or magnetic texture into precession by means of\nspin-transfer torque in a spin-Hall setup, and manipulate it using spin\nsuperfluidity in the case of planar magnetic order.\n", "  We have developed ultra-low-background NaI(Tl) crystals to reproduce the DAMA\nresults with the ultimate goal of achieving purity levels that are comparable\nto or better than those of the DAMA/LIBRA crystals. Even though the achieved\nbackground level does not approach that of DAMA/LIBRA, it is crucial to have a\nquantitative understanding of the backgrounds. We have studied background\nsimulations toward a deeper understanding of the backgrounds and developed\nbackground models for a 9.16-kg NaI(Tl) crystal used in the test arrangement.\nIn this paper we describe the contributions of background sources\nquantitatively by performing Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations that are fitted to\nthe measured data to quantify the unknown fractions of the background\ncompositions. In the fitted results, the overall simulated background spectrum\nwell describes the measured data with a 9.16-kg NaI(Tl) crystal and shows that\nthe background sources are dominated by surface $^{210}$Pb and internal\n$^{40}$K in the 2 to 6-keV energy interval, which produce 2.4 counts/day/keV/kg\n(dru) and 0.5 dru, respectively.\n", "  In this work we use the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) to infer the mass of\nan axion which interacts to photons and neutrinos in an effective low energy\ntheory. The Shannon entropy function to be maximized is suitably defined in\nterms of the axion branching ratios. We show that MEP strongly constrains the\naxion mass taking into account the current experimental bounds on the neutrinos\nmasses. Assuming that the axion is massive enough to decay into all the three\nneutrinos and that MEP fixes all the free parameters of the model, the inferred\naxion mass is in the interval $0.1\\ $eV$\\ <m_{A}<0.2$ eV, which can be tested\nby forthcoming experiments such as IAXO. However, even in the case where MEP\nfixes just the axion mass and no other parameter, we found that $0.1$ eV $< m_A\n< 6.3$ eV in the DFSZ model with right-handed neutrinos. Moreover, a light\naxion, allowed to decay to photons and the lightest neutrino only, is\ndetermined by MEP as a viable dark matter candidate.\n", "  CdTe is increasingly being used as the x-ray sensing material in imaging\npixel array detectors for x-rays, generally above 20 keV, where silicon sensors\nbecome unacceptably transparent. Unfortunately CdTe suffers from polarization,\nwhich can alter the response of the material over time and with accumulated\ndose. Most prior studies used long integration times or CdTe that was not of\nthe hole-collecting Schottky type. We investigated the temporal response of\nhole-collecting Schottky type CdTe sensors on timescales ranging from tens of\nnanoseconds to several seconds. We found that the material shows signal\npersistence on the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds attributed to the\ndetrapping of a shallow trap, and additional persistence on sub-microsecond\ntimescales after polarization. The results show that this type of CdTe can be\nused for time resolved studies down to approximately 100 ns. However\nquantitative interpretation of the signal requires careful attention to bias\nvoltages, polarization and exposure history.\n", "  The complete gravitational collapse of a body in general relativity will\nresult in the formation of a black hole. Although the black hole is classically\nstable, quantum particle creation processes will result in the emission of\nHawking radiation to infinity and corresponding mass loss of the black hole,\neventually resulting in the complete evaporation of the black hole.\nSemiclassical arguments strongly suggest that, in the process of black hole\nformation and evaporation, a pure quantum state will evolve to a mixed state,\ni.e., there will be \"information loss.\" There has been considerable controversy\nover this issue for more than 40 years. In this review, we present the\narguments in favor of information loss, and analyze some of the\ncounter-arguments and alternative possibilities.\n", "  We give a brief overview of the black hole information problem emphasizing\nfundamental issues and recent proposals for its resolution. The focus is on\nbroad perspective and providing a guide to current literature rather than\npresenting full details. We concentrate on resolutions restoring naive\nunitarity.\n", "  We investigate atom-based electric-field calibration and polarization\nmeasurement of a 100-MHz linearly polarized radio-frequency (RF) field using\ncesium Rydberg-atom electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in a\nroom-temperature vapor cell. The calibration method is based on matching\nexperimental data with the results of a theoretical Floquet model. The utilized\n60$D_J$ fine structure Floquet levels exhibit $J$- and $m_j$-dependent AC Stark\nshifts and splittings, and develop even-order RF-modulation sidebands. The\nFloquet map of cesium 60$D_J$ fine structure states exhibits a series of exact\ncrossings between states of different $m_j$, which are not RF-coupled. These\nexact level crossings are employed to perform a rapid and precise ($\\pm 0.5\\%$)\ncalibration of the RF electric field. We also map out three series of narrow\navoided crossings between fine structure Floquet levels of equal $m_j$ and\ndifferent $J$, which are weakly coupled by the RF field via a Raman process.\nThe coupling leads to narrow avoided crossings that can also be applied as\nspectroscopic markers for RF field calibration. We further find that the\nline-strength ratio of intersecting Floquet levels with different $m_j$\nprovides a fast and robust measurement of the RF field's polarization.\n", "  Quantum illumination (QI) provides entanglement-based target detection---in\nan entanglement-breaking environment---whose performance is significantly\nbetter than that of optimum classical-illumination target detection. QI's\nperformance advantage was established in a Bayesian setting with the target\npresumed equally likely to be absent or present and error probability employed\nas the performance metric. Radar theory, however, eschews that Bayesian\napproach, preferring the Neyman-Pearson performance criterion to avoid the\ndifficulties of accurately assigning prior probabilities to target absence and\npresence and appropriate costs to false-alarm and miss errors. We have recently\nreported an architecture---based on sum-frequency generation (SFG) and\nfeedforward (FF) processing---for minimum error-probability QI target detection\nwith arbitrary prior probabilities for target absence and presence. In this\npaper, we use our results for FF-SFG reception to determine the receiver\noperating characteristic---detection probability versus false-alarm\nprobability---for optimum QI target detection under the Neyman-Pearson\ncriterion.\n", "  We present a kinetic description of Bose-Einstein condensation for particle\nsystems being out of thermal equilibrium, which may happen for gluons produced\nin the early stage of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The dynamics of\nbosons towards equilibrium is described by a Boltzmann equation including Bose\nfactors. To solve the Boltzmann equation with the presence of a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate we make further developments of the kinetic transport model BAMPS\n(Boltzmann Approach of MultiParton Scatterings). In this work we demonstrate\nthe correct numerical implementations by comparing the final numerical results\nto the expected solutions at thermal equilibrium for systems with and without\nthe presence of Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition, the onset of the\ncondensation in an over-populated gluon system is studied in more details. We\nfind that both expected power-law scalings denoted by the particle and energy\ncascade are observed in the calculated gluon distribution function at infrared\nand intermediate momentum regions, respectively. Also, the time evolution of\nthe hard scale exhibits a power-law scaling in a time window, which indicates\nthat the distribution function is approximately self-similar during that time.\n", "  We detect 20 $z=7.0$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidates to $L({\\rm\nLy}\\alpha) \\geq 2 \\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ or $0.3$ $L^*_{z=7}$ and in\n$6.1\\times 10^5$ Mpc$^3$ volume in the Subaru Deep Field and the\nSubaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey field by 82 and 37 hours of Subaru Suprime-Cam\nnarrowband NB973 and reddest optical $y$-band imaging. We compare their\nLy$\\alpha$ and UV luminosity functions (LFs) and densities and Ly$\\alpha$\nequivalent widths (EWs) to those of $z=5.7$, 6.6 and 7.3 LAEs from previous\nSuprime-Cam surveys. The Ly$\\alpha$ LF (density) rapidly declines by a factor\nof $\\times$1.5 (1.9) in $L({\\rm Ly}\\alpha)$ at $z=5.7-6.6$ (160 Myr),\n$\\times$1.5 (1.6) at $z=6.6-7.0$ (60 Myr) at the faint end and $\\times$2.0\n(3.8) at $z=7.0-7.3$ (40 Myr). Also, in addition to the systematic decrease in\nEW at $z=5.7-6.6$ previously found, 2/3 of the $z=7.0$ LAEs detected in the UV\ncontinuum exhibit lower EWs than the $z=6.6$ ones. Moreover, while the UV LF\nand density do not evolve at $z=5.7-6.6$, they modestly decline at $z=6.6-7.0$,\nimplying galaxy evolution contributing to the decline of the Ly$\\alpha$ LF.\nComparison of the $z=7.0$ Ly$\\alpha$ LF to the one predicted by an LAE\nevolution model further reveals that galaxy evolution alone cannot explain all\nthe decline of Ly$\\alpha$ LF. If we attribute the discrepancy to Ly$\\alpha$\nattenuation by neutral hydrogen, the intergalactic medium transmission of\nLy$\\alpha$ photons at $z=7.0$ would be $T_{{\\rm Ly}\\alpha}^{\\rm IGM} \\leq\n0.6-0.7$. It is lower (higher) than $T_{{\\rm Ly}\\alpha}^{\\rm IGM}$ at $z=6.6$\n(7.3) derived by previous studies, suggesting rapid increase in neutral\nfraction at $z > 6$.\n", "  The propagation of a beneficial mutation in a spatially extended population\nis usually studied using the phenomenological stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov\n(SFKPP) equation. We derive here an individual based, stochastic model founded\non the spatial Moran process where fluctuations are treated exactly. At high\nselection pressure, the results of this model are different from the classical\nFKPP. At small selection pressure, the front behavior can be mapped into a\nBrownian motion with drift, the properties of which can be derived from\nmicroscopic parameters of the Moran model. Finally, we show that the diffusion\ncoefficient and the noise amplitude of SFKPP are not independent parameters but\nare both determined by the dispersal kernel of individuals.\n", "  Chimera states are an example of intriguing partial synchronization patterns\nemerging in networks of identical oscillators. They consist of spatially\ncoexisting domains of coherent (synchronized) and incoherent (desynchronized)\ndynamics. We analyze chimera states in networks of Van der Pol oscillators with\nhierarchical connectivities, and elaborate the role of time delay introduced in\nthe coupling term. In the parameter plane of coupling strength and delay time\nwe find tongue-like regions of existence of chimera states alternating with\nregions of existence of coherent travelling waves. We demonstrate that by\nvarying the time delay one can deliberately stabilize desired spatio-temporal\npatterns in the system.\n", "  Geometrically frustrated solids with non-Euclidean reference metric are\nubiquitous in biology and are becoming increasingly relevant in technological\napplications. Often they acquire a targeted con- figuration of incompatibility\nthrough surface accretion of mass as in tree growth or dam construction. We use\nthe mechanics of incompatible surface growth to show that geometrical\nfrustration develop- ing during deposition can be fine-tuned to ensure a\nparticular behavior of the system in physiological (or working) conditions. As\nan illustration, we obtain an explicit 3D printing protocol for arteries, which\nguarantees stress uniformity under inhomogeneous loading, and for explosive\nplants, allowing a complete release of residual elastic energy with a single\ncut. Interestingly, in both cases reaching the physiological target requires\nthe incompatibility to have a topological (global) component.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamics of a floating lipid bilayer\nmembrane coupled with a two-dimensional cytoskeleton network, taking into\nexplicitly account the intermonolayer friction, the discrete lattice structure\nof the cytoskeleton, and its prestress. The lattice structure breaks lateral\ncontinuous translational symmetry and couples Fourier modes with different\nwavevectors. It is shown that within a short time interval a long-wavelength\ndeformation excites a collection of modes with wavelengths shorter than the\nlattice spacing. These modes relax slowly with a common renormalized rate\noriginating from the long-wavelength mode. As a result, and because of the\nprestress, the slowest relaxation is governed by the intermonolayer friction.\nReversely, and most interestingly, forces applied at the scale of the\ncytoskeleton for a sufficiently long time can cooperatively excite large-scale\nmodes.\n", "  Power exhaust is one of the major challenges for a future fusion device.\nApplying a non-axisymmetric external magnetic perturbation is one technique\nthat is studied in order to mitigate or suppress large edge localized modes\nwhich accompany the high confinement regime in tokamaks. The external magnetic\nperturbation brakes the axisymmetry of a tokamak and leads to a 2D heat flux\npattern on the divertor target. The 2D heat flux pattern at the outer divertor\ntarget is studied on ASDEX Upgrade in stationary L-Mode discharges. The\namplitude of the 2D characteristic of the heat flux depends on the alignment\nbetween the field lines at the edge and the vacuum response of the applied\nmagnetic perturbation spectrum. The 2D characteristic reduces with increasing\ndensity. The increasing divertor broadening $S$ with increasing density is\nproposed as the main actuator. This is supported by a generic model using field\nline tracing and the vacuum field approach that is in quantitative agreement\nwith the measured heat flux. The perturbed heat flux, averaged over a full\ntoroidal rotation of the magnetic perturbation, is identical to the\nnon-perturbed heat flux without magnetic perturbation. The transport\nqualifiers, power fall-off length $\\lambda_q$ and divertor broadening $S$, are\nthe same within the uncertainty compared to the unperturbed reference. No\nadditional cross field transport is observed.\n", "  We study K\\\"ahler moduli stabilizations in semi-realistic magnetized D-brane\nmodels based on $ Z_2\\times Z_2'$ toroidal orbifolds. In type IIB\ncompactifications, 3-form fluxes can stabilize the dilaton and complex\nstructure moduli fields, but there remain some massless closed string moduli\nfields, K\\\"ahler moduli. The magnetic fluxes generate Fayet-Iliopoulos terms,\nwhich can fix ratios of K\\\"ahler moduli. On top of that, we consider D-brane\ninstanton effects to stabilize them in concrete D-brane models and investigate\nthe brane configurations to confirm that the moduli fields can be stabilized\nsuccessfully. In this paper, we treat two types of D-brane models. One is based\non D9-brane systems respecting the Pati-Salam model. The other is realized in a\nD7-brane system breaking the Pati-Salam gauge group. We find suitable\nconfigurations where the D-brane instantons can stabilize the moduli fields\nwithin both types of D-brane models, explaining an origin of a small constant\nterm of the superpotential which is a key ingredient for successful moduli\nstabilizations.\n", "  Entanglement is usually quantified by von Neumann entropy, but its properties\nare much more complex than what can be expressed with a single number. We show\nthat the three distinct dynamical phases known as thermalization, Anderson\nlocalization, and many-body localization are marked by different patterns of\nthe spectrum of the reduced density matrix for a state evolved after a quantum\nquench. While the entanglement spectrum displays Poisson statistics for the\ncase of Anderson localization, it displays universal Wigner-Dyson statistics\nfor both the cases of many-body localization and thermalization, albeit the\nuniversal distribution is asymptotically reached within very different time\nscales in these two cases. We further show that the complexity of entanglement,\nrevealed by the possibility of disentangling the state through a\nMetropolis-like algorithm, is signaled by whether the entanglement spectrum\nlevel spacing is Poisson or Wigner-Dyson distributed.\n", "  The well known elliptic discrete Painlev\\'e equation of Sakai is constructed\nby a standard translation on the $E_8^{(1)}$ lattice, given by nearest neighbor\nvectors. In this paper, we give a new elliptic discrete Painlev\\'e equation\nobtained by translations along next-nearest-neighbor vectors. This equation is\na generic (8-parameter) version of a 2-parameter elliptic difference equation\nfound by reduction from Adler's partial difference equation, the so-called Q4\nequation. We also provide a projective reduction of the well known equation of\nSakai.\n", "  Isotropic turbulence is typically studied numerically through the direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS). The DNS flows are described by the Navier-Stokes\nequation in a 'box', defined through periodic boundary conditions. The DNS\nflows live in a compact space and they are not isotropic in their large scales.\nThe investigation of important phenomena of isotropic turbulence, such as\nanomalous scaling, through the DNS is affected by large scale effects. In this\nwork we put isotropic turbulence - or better, the associated formal theory - in\na 'box', through imposing periodicity at the level of the correlations\nfunctions. We offer a framework where one may investigate isotropic\ntheories/models through the data of DNS in a formally consistent manner. We\nwork at the level of the Karman-Howarth equation. Unlike the Navier-Stokes\nequation, infinitely smooth periodicity is obstructed in this theory, a fact\nexpressed by a sequence of relations obeyed by the normal modes of the\nKarman-Howarth equation. Similar relations are imparted to the two-point\nfunctions under the condition that the energy spectrum and energy transfer\nfunction are realizable. Naturally constructed closures scheme for the\nKarman-Howarth equation do not conform to such relations, thereby destroying\nrealizability. A closure can be made to conform to a finite number of them by\nadding corrective terms, in a procedure which possesses certain analogies with\nthe renormalization of quantum field theory. The spectrum becomes unphysical\n(through sign-changing oscillations) for infinitely large wavenumbers, but we\ncan controllably extend the regime where the spectrum remains physical deep\nenough in the dissipation range so that to be realistically adequate. We show\nthat one or two such 'regularity relations' are needed at most for comparisons\nof the predictions of the theory with the current resolution level results of\nthe DNS.\n", "  Superconducting transmon qubits comprise one of the most promising platforms\nfor quantum information processing due to their long coherence times and to\ntheir scalability into larger qubit networks. However, their weakly anharmonic\nspectrum leads to spectral crowding in multiqubit systems, making it\nchallenging to implement fast, high-fidelity gates while avoiding leakage\nerrors. To address this challenge, we use a protocol known as SWIPHT [Phys.\nRev. B 91, 161405(R) (2015)], which yields smooth, simple microwave pulses\ndesigned to suppress leakage without sacrificing gate speed through spectral\nselectivity. Here, we determine the parameter regimes in which SWIPHT is\neffective and demonstrate that in these regimes it systematically produces\ntwo-qubit gate fidelities for cavity-coupled transmons in the range 99.6%-99.9%\nwith gate times as fast as 23 ns. Our results are obtained from full numerical\nsimulations that include current experimental levels of relaxation and\ndephasing. These high fidelities persist over a wide range of system parameters\nthat encompass many current experimental setups and are insensitive to small\nparameter variations and pulse imperfections.\n", "  In this work thin magnetite films were deposited on SrTiO$_3$ via reactive\nmolecular beam epitaxy at different substrate temperatures. The growth process\nwas monitored in-situ during deposition by means of x-ray diffraction. While\nthe magnetite film grown at 400$^\\circ$C shows a fully relaxed vertical lattice\nconstant already in the early growth stages, the film deposited at 270$^\\circ$C\nexhibits a strong vertical compressive strain and relaxes towards the bulk\nvalue with increasing film thickness. Furthermore, a lateral tensile strain was\nobserved under these growth conditions although the inverse behavior is\nexpected due to the lattice mismatch of -7.5%. Additionally, the occupancy of\nthe A and B sublattices of magnetite with tetrahedral and octahedral sites was\ninvestigated showing a lower occupancy of the A sites compared to an ideal\ninverse spinel structure. The occupation of A sites decreases for a higher\ngrowth temperature. Thus, we assume a relocation of the iron ions from\ntetrahedral sites to octahedral vacancies forming a deficient rock salt\nlattice.\n", "  We apply the recent wavepacket formalism developed by Ossadnik to describe\nthe origin of the short range ordered pseudogap state as the hole doping is\nlowered through a critical density in cuprates. We argue that the energy gain\nthat drives this precursor state to Mott localization, follows from maximizing\numklapp scattering near the Fermi energy. To this end we show how energy gaps\ndriven by umklapp scattering can open on an appropriately chosen surface, as\nproposed earlier by Yang, Rice and Zhang. The key feature is that the pairing\ninstability includes umklapp scattering, leading to an energy gap not only in\nthe single particle spectrum but also in the pair spectrum. As a result the\nsuperconducting gap at overdoping is turned into an insulating pseudogap, in\nthe antinodal parts of the Fermi surface.\n", "  We outline the case for heavy-ion-physics studies using the multi-TeV lead\nLHC beams in the fixed-target mode. After a brief contextual reminder, we\ndetail the possible contributions of AFTER@LHC to heavy-ion physics with a\nspecific emphasis on quarkonia. We then present performance simulations for a\nselection of observables. These show that $\\Upsilon(nS)$, $J/\\psi$ and\n$\\psi(2S)$ production in heavy-ion collisions can be studied in new energy and\nrapidity domains with the LHCb and ALICE detectors. We also discuss the\nrelevance to analyse the Drell-Yan pair production in asymmetric\nnucleus-nucleus collisions to study the factorisation of the nuclear\nmodification of partonic densities and of further quarkonia to restore their\nstatus of golden probes of the quark-gluon plasma formation.\n", "  We study operator insertions into the $1/2$ BPS Wilson loop in ${\\cal N}=4$\nSYM theory and determine their two-point coefficients, anomalous dimensions and\nstructure constants. The calculation is done for the first few lowest dimension\ninsertions and relies on known results for the expectation value of a smooth\nWilson loop. In addition to the particular coefficients that we calculate, our\nstudy elucidates the connection between deformations of the line and operator\ninsertions and between the vacuum expectation value of the line and the CFT\ndata of the insertions.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of a supersymmetric extension of the Standard\nModel with an $R$-symmetry under which $R$-charges correspond to the baryon\nnumber. This identification allows for the presence in the superpotential of\nthe $R$-parity violating term $\\lambda''U^c D^c D^c$ without breaking baryon\nnumber, which loosens several bounds on this operator while changing\nconsiderably the phenomenology. However, the $R$-symmetry cannot remain exact\nas it is at least broken by anomaly mediation. Under these conditions, we\ninvestigate the constraints coming from baryon number violating processes and\nflavour physics and find that, in general, they are lessened. Additionally, we\nexamine recent ATLAS and CMS experimental searches and use these to place\nlimits on the parameter space of the model. This is done for both stop\nproduction, which now features both pair and resonant production, and pair\nproduction of the first two generations of squarks. Finally, we study the\nimplications this model has on baryogenesis. We find that successful\nbaryogenesis can potentially be achieved, but only at the cost of breaking the\n$R$-symmetry by a significant amount.\n", "  This document describes the early stage of the reconstruction chain that was\ndeveloped for the ArgoNeuT and MicroBooNE experiments at Fermilab. These\nexperiments study accelerator neutrino interactions that occur in a Liquid\nArgon Time Projection Chamber. Reconstructing the properties of particles\nproduced in these interactions requires knowledge of the micro-physics\nprocesses that affect the creation and transport of ionization electrons to the\nreadout system. A wire signal deconvolution technique was developed to convert\nwire signals to a standard form for hit reconstruction, to remove artifacts in\nthe electronics chain and to remove coherent noise.\n", "  Both scalar fields and (generalized) Chaplygin gases have been widely used\nseparately to characterize the dark sector of the Universe. Here we investigate\nthe cosmological background dynamics for a mixture of both these components and\nquantify the fractional abundances that are admitted by observational data from\nsupernovae of type Ia and from the evolution of the Hubble rate. Moreover, we\nstudy how the growth rate of (baryonic) matter perturbations is affected by the\ndark-sector perturbations.\n", "  We use holographic renormalization of minimal $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged\nsupergravity in order to derive the general form of the quantum Ward identities\nfor 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ and 4d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal theories on\ngeneral curved backgrounds, including an arbitrary fermionic source for the\nsupercurrent. The Ward identities for 4d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ theories contain both\nbosonic and fermionic global anomalies, which we determine explicitly up to\nquadratic order in the supercurrent source. The Ward identities we derive apply\nto any superconformal theory, independently of whether it admits a holographic\ndual, except for the specific values of the $a$ and $c$ anomaly coefficients,\nwhich are equal due to our starting point of a two-derivative bulk supergravity\ntheory. We show that the fermionic anomalies lead to an anomalous\ntransformation of the supercurrent under rigid supersymmetry on backgrounds\nadmitting Killing spinors, even if all superconformal anomalies are numerically\nzero on such backgrounds. The anomalous transformation of the supercurrent\nunder rigid supersymmetry leads to an obstruction to the $Q$-exactness of the\nstress tensor in supersymmetric vacua, and may have implications for the\napplicability of localization techniques. We use this obstruction to the\n$Q$-exactness of the stress tensor, together with the Ward identities, in order\nto determine the general form of the stress tensor and $R$-current one-point\nfunctions in supersymmetric vacua, which allows us to obtain general\nexpressions for the supersymmetric Casimir charges and partition function.\n", "  LSPM J1314+1320 (=NLTT 33370) is a binary star system consisting of two\nnearly identical pre-main sequence stars of spectral type M7. The system is\nremarkable among ultracool dwarfs for being the most luminous radio emitter\nover the widest frequency range. Masses and luminosities are at first sight\nconsistent with the system being coeval at age ~80 Myr according to standard\n(non-magnetic) evolutionary models. However, these models predict an average\neffective temperature, 2950 +/- 5 K, which is 180 K hotter than the empirical\nvalue. Thus, the empirical radii are oversized relative to the standard models\nby ~13%. We demonstrate that magnetic stellar models can account quantitatively\nfor the oversizing. As a check on our models, we note that the radio emission\nlimits the surface magnetic field strengths: the limits depend on identifying\nthe radio emission mechanism. We find that the field strengths required by our\nmagnetic models are too strong to be consistent with gyrosynchrotron emission,\nbut are consistent with electron cyclotron maser emission.\n", "  The inverse problem of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is often\nsolved in an effort to benchmark and design approximate exchange-correlation\npotentials. The forward and inverse problems of DFT rely on the same equations\nbut the numerical methods for solving each problem are substantially different.\nWe examine both problems in this tutorial with a special emphasis on the\nalgorithms and error analysis needed for solving the inverse problem. Two\ninversion methods based on partial differential equation constrained\noptimization and constrained variational ideas are introduced. We compare and\ncontrast several different inversion methods applied to one-dimensional finite\nand periodic model systems.\n", "  We report an experimental investigation of the two-dimensional ${J}_{\\rm\neff}$ = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Mott insulator by varying the interlayer exchange\ncoupling in [(SrIrO$_3$)$_1$, (SrTiO$_3$)$_m$] ($m$ = 1, 2 and 3)\nsuperlattices. Although all samples exhibited an insulating ground state with\nlong-range magnetic order, temperature-dependent resistivity measurements\nshowed a stronger insulating behavior in the $m$ = 2 and $m$ = 3 samples than\nthe $m$ = 1 sample which displayed a clear kink at the magnetic transition.\nThis difference indicates that the blocking effect of the excessive SrTiO$_3$\nlayer enhances the effective electron-electron correlation and strengthens the\nMott phase. The significant reduction of the Neel temperature from 150 K for\n$m$ = 1 to 40 K for $m$ = 2 demonstrates that the long-range order stability in\nthe former is boosted by a substantial interlayer exchange coupling. Resonant\nx-ray magnetic scattering revealed that the interlayer exchange coupling has a\nswitchable sign, depending on the SrTiO$_3$ layer number $m$, for maintaining\ncanting-induced weak ferromagnetism. The nearly unaltered transition\ntemperature between the $m$ = 2 and the $m$ = 3 demonstrated that we have\nrealized a two-dimensional antiferromagnet at finite temperatures with\ndiminishing interlayer exchange coupling.\n", "  Quantum field theories at finite matter densities generically possess a\npartition function that is exponentially suppressed with the volume compared to\nthat of the phase quenched analogue. The smallness arises from an almost\nuniform distribution for the phase of the fermion determinant. Large\ncancellations upon integration is the origin of a poor signal to noise ratio.\nWe study three alternatives for this integration: the Gaussian approximation,\nthe \"telegraphic\" approximation, and a novel expansion in terms of\ntheory-dependent moments and universal coefficients. We have tested the methods\nfor QCD at finite densities of heavy quarks. We find that for two of the\napproximations the results are extremely close - if not identical - to the full\nanswer in the strong sign problem regime.\n", "  Singlet fission (SF) process, where a singlet exciton decays into a pair of\nspin one exciton states which are in the total spin singlet state, is one of\nthe possible channels for multiple exciton generation (MEG). In chiral\nsingle-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) efficient SF is present within the solar\nspectrum energy range which is shown by the many-body perturbation theory\n(MBPT) calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) simulations.\nWe calculate SF exciton-to-biexction decay rates ${\\rm R}_{1\\to 2}$ and\nbiexciton-to-exction rates ${\\rm R}_{2\\to1}$ in the (6,2), (6,5), (10,5)\nSWCNTs, and in (6,2) SWCNT functionalized with Cl atoms. Within the solar\nenergy range, we predict ${\\rm R}_{1\\to2}\\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}~s^{-1}$, while\nbiexciton-to-exction recombination is weak with ${\\rm R}_{2\\to 1}/{\\rm R}_{1\\to\n2}\\leq 10^{-2}.$ SF MEG strength in pristine SWCNTs varies strongly with the\nexcitation energy, which is due to highly non-uniform density of states at low\nenergy. However, our results for (6,2) SWCNT with chlorine atoms adsorbed to\nthe surface suggest that MEG in the chiral SWCNTs can be enhanced by altering\nthe low-energy electronic states via surface functionalization.\n", "  We present a universal expression for the electronic friction as felt by a\nset of classical nuclear degrees of freedom (DoF's) coupled to a manifold of\nquantum electronic DoF's; no assumptions are made regarding the nature of the\nelectronic Hamiltonian and electron-electron repulsions are allowed. Our\nderivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the\ncoupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation\nwhereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear\nmovement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce\nto previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.\nHamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is\nsymmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, we\nstudy electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a proper\ntreatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondo\nresonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate.\n", "  We study non-relativistic supersymmetric field theories in diverse\ndimensions. The theories consist of scalars and fermions and possess two, four\nor eight real supercharges. We analyze their spontaneous supersymmetry breaking\nstructure and calculate the gapless spectrum. We calculate the perturbative\nquantum corrections at the supersymmetric vacua and show that while\nsupersymmetry is preserved, scale invariance is broken and the theories are IR\nfree.\n", "  We consider the D1D5 CFT near the orbifold point and develop methods for\ncomputing the mixing of untwisted operators to first order by using the OPE on\nthe covering surface. We argue that the OPE on the cover encodes both the\nstructure constants for the orbifold CFT and the explicit form of the mixing\noperators. We show this explicitly for some example operators. We start by\nconsidering a family of operators dual to supergravity modes, and show that the\nOPE implies that there is no shift in the anomalous dimension to first order,\nas expected. We specialize to the operator dual to the dilaton, and show that\nthe leading order singularity in the OPE reproduces the correct structure\nconstant. Finally, we consider an unprotected operator of conformal dimension\n(2,2), and show that the leading order singularity and one of the subleading\nsingularies both reproduce the correct structure constant. We check that the\noperator produced at subleading order using the OPE method is correct by\ncalculating a number of three point functions using a Mathematica package we\ndeveloped. Further development of this OPE technique should lead to more\nefficient calculations for the D1D5 CFT perturbed away from the orbifold point.\n", "  In the new approach to study the optical response of periodic structures,\nsuccessfully applied to study the optical properties of blue-emitting InGaN/GaN\nsuperlattices, the spontaneous charge polarization was neglected. To search the\neffect of this quantum confined Stark phenomenon we study the optical response,\nassuming parabolic band edge modulations in the conduction and valence bands.\nWe discuss the consequences on the eigenfunction symmetries and the ensuing\noptical transition selection rules. Using the new approach in the WKB\napproximation of the finite periodic systems theory, we determine the energy\neigenvalues, their corresponding eigenfunctions and the subband structures in\nthe conduction and valence bands. We calculate the photoluminescence as a\nfunction of the charge localization strength, and compare with the experimental\nresult. We show that for subbands close to the barrier edge the optical\nresponse and the surface states are sensitive to charge polarization strength.\n", "  Manganese metallocenes larger than the experimentally produced sandwiched\nMnBz$_2$ compound are studied using several density functional theory methods.\nFirst, we show that the lowest energy structures have Mn clusters surrounded by\nbenzene molecules, in so-called rice-ball structures. We then find a strikingly\nshort bond length of 1.8 {\\AA} between pairs of Mn atoms, accompanied by\nmagnetism depletion. The ultrashort bond lengths are related to Bz molecules\ncaging a pair of Mn atoms, leading to a Mn-Mn triple bond. This effect is also\nfound when replacing benzenes by other molecules such as borazine or\ncyclopentadiene. The stability of the Mn-Mn bond for Mn$_2$Bz$_2$ is further\ninvestigated using dissociation energy curves. For each spin configuration, the\nenergy versus distance plot shows different spin minima with barriers, which\nmust be overcome to synthesize larger Mn-Bz complexes.\n", "  Wide-angle Compton scattering (WACS) is discussed within the handbag approach\nin which the amplitudes are given by products of hard subprocess amplitudes and\nform factors, specific to Compton scattering, which represent 1/x-moments of\ngeneralized parton distributions (GPDs). The quality of our present knowledge\nof these form factors and of the underlying GPDs is examined. As will be\ndiscussed in some detail the form factor R_A and the underlying GPD H-tilde are\npoorly known. It is argued that future data on the spin correlations A_{LL}\nand/or K_{LL} will allow for an extraction of R_A which can be used to\nconstrain the large -t behavior of H-tilde.\n", "  Many phenomena taking place in the solar photosphere are controlled by plasma\nmotions. Although the line-of-sight component of the velocity can be estimated\nusing the Doppler effect, we do not have direct spectroscopic access to the\ncomponents that are perpendicular to the line-of-sight. These components are\ntypically estimated using methods based on local correlation tracking. We have\ndesigned DeepVel, an end-to-end deep neural network that produces an estimation\nof the velocity at every single pixel and at every time step and at three\ndifferent heights in the atmosphere from just two consecutive continuum images.\nWe confront DeepVel with local correlation tracking, pointing out that they\ngive very similar results in the time- and spatially-averaged cases. We use the\nnetwork to study the evolution in height of the horizontal velocity field in\nfragmenting granules, supporting the buoyancy-braking mechanism for the\nformation of integranular lanes in these granules. We also show that DeepVel\ncan capture very small vortices, so that we can potentially expand the scaling\ncascade of vortices to very small sizes and durations.\n", "  Restricted Boltzmann Machines are key tools in Machine Learning and are\ndescribed by the energy function of bipartite spin-glasses. From a statistical\nmechanical perspective, they share the same Gibbs measure of Hopfield networks\nfor associative memory. In this equivalence, weights in the former play as\npatterns in the latter. As Boltzmann machines usually require real weights to\nbe trained with gradient descent like methods, while Hopfield networks\ntypically store binary patterns to be able to retrieve, the investigation of a\nmixed Hebbian network, equipped with both real (e.g., Gaussian) and discrete\n(e.g., Boolean) patterns naturally arises. We prove that, in the challenging\nregime of a high storage of real patterns, where retrieval is forbidden, an\nextra load of Boolean patterns can still be retrieved, as long as the ratio\namong the overall load and the network size does not exceed a critical\nthreshold, that turns out to be the same of the standard\nAmit-Gutfreund-Sompolinsky theory. Assuming replica symmetry, we study the case\nof a low load of Boolean patterns combining the stochastic stability and\nHamilton-Jacobi interpolating techniques. The result can be extended to the\nhigh load by a non rigorous but standard replica computation argument.\n", "  A simulation study of energy resolution, position resolution, and\n$\\pi^0$-$\\gamma$ separation using multivariate methods of a sampling\ncalorimeter is presented. As a realistic example, the geometry of the\ncalorimeter is taken from the design geometry of the Shashlik calorimeter which\nwas considered as a candidate for CMS endcap for the phase II of LHC running.\nThe methods proposed in this paper can be easily adapted to various geometrical\nlayouts of a sampling calorimeter. Energy resolution is studied for different\nlayouts and different absorber-scintillator combinations of the Shashlik\ndetector. It is shown that a boosted decision tree using fine grained\ninformation of the calorimeter can perform three times better than a cut-based\nmethod for separation of $\\pi^0$ from $\\gamma$ over a large energy range of 20\nGeV-200 GeV.\n", "  We study the quantum transport and the nonequilibrium vibrational states of a\nquantum dot embedded between a normal and a superconducting lead with the\ncharge on the quantum dot linearly coupled to a harmonic oscillator of\nfrequency $\\omega$. To the leading order in the charge-vibration interaction,\nwe calculate the current and the nonequilibrium phonon occupation by the\nKeldsyh Green's function technique. We analyze the inelastic,\nvibration-assisted tunneling processes in the regime $\\omega <\\Delta$, with the\nsuperconducting energy gap $\\Delta$, and for sharp resonant transmission\nthrough the dot. When the energy $\\varepsilon_0$ of the dot's level is close to\nthe Fermi energy $\\mu$, i.e. $|\\varepsilon_0-\\mu|\\ll \\Delta$, inelastic Andreev\nreflections dominate up to voltage $eV\\gtrsim\\Delta$. The inelastic\nquasiparticle tunneling becomes the leading process when the dot's level is\nclose to the gap $|\\varepsilon_0-\\mu|\\sim \\Delta \\pm \\omega$. In both cases,\nthe inelastic tunneling processes appear as sharp and prominent peaks - not\nbroadened by temperature - in the $I$-$V$ characteristic and pave the way for\ninelastic spectroscopy of vibrational modes even at temperatures $T \\gg\n\\omega$. We also found that inelastic Andreev reflections as well as\nquasiparticle tunneling induce a strong nonequilibrium state of the oscillator.\nIn different ranges on the dot's level, we found that the current produces: (i)\nground-state cooling of the oscillator with phonon occupation $n\\ll 1$, (ii)\naccumulation of energy in the oscillator with $n\\gg 1$ and (iii) a mechanical\ninstability which is a precursor of self-sustained oscillations. We show that\nground-state cooling is achieved simultaneously for several modes of different\nfrequencies. Finally, we discuss how the nonequilibrium vibrational state can\nbe detected by the asymmetric behavior of the inelastic current peaks respect\nto the gate voltage.\n", "  We investigate the sensitivity at current and future hadron colliders to a\nheavy electrically-charged particle with a proper decay length below a\ncentimetre, whose decay products are invisible due to below-threshold energies\nand/or small couplings to the Standard Model. A cosmologically-motivated\nexample of a framework that contains such a particle is the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model in the limit of pure Higgsinos. The current\nhadron-collider search strategy has no sensitivity to the upper range of pure\nHiggsino masses that are consistent with the thermal relic density, even at a\nfuture collider with 100 TeV centre-of-mass energy. We show that performing a\ndisappearing track search within the inner 10 cm of detector volume would\nimprove the reach in lifetime by a factor of 3 at the 14 TeV LHC and a further\nfactor of 5 at a 100 TeV collider, resulting in around 10 events for 1.1 TeV\nthermal Higgsinos. In order to include the particles with the largest boost in\nthe analysis, we furthermore propose a purely track-based search in both the\ncentral and forward regions, each of which would increase the number of events\nby another factor of 5, improving our reach at small lifetimes. This would\nallow us to definitively discover or exclude the experimentally-elusive\npure-Higgsino thermal relic at a 100 TeV collider.\n", "  Thanks to modern sky surveys, over twenty stellar streams and overdensity\nstructures have been discovered in the halo of the Milky Way. In this paper, we\npresent an analysis of spectroscopic observations of individual stars from one\nsuch structure, \"A13\", first identified as an overdensity using the M giant\ncatalog from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. Our spectroscopic observations show\nthat stars identified with A13 have a velocity dispersion of $\\lesssim$ 40\n$\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, implying that it is a genuine coherent structure rather\nthan a chance super-position of random halo stars. From its position on the\nsky, distance ($\\sim$15~kpc heliocentric), and kinematical properties, A13 is\nlikely to be an extension of another low Galactic latitude substructure -- the\nGalactic Anticenter Stellar Structure (also known as the Monoceros Ring) --\ntowards smaller Galactic longitude and farther distance. Furthermore, the\nkinematics of A13 also connect it with another structure in the southern\nGalactic hemisphere -- the Triangulum-Andromeda overdensity. We discuss these\nthree connected structures within the context of a previously proposed scenario\nthat one or all of these features originate from the disk of the Milky Way.\n", "  The sensitivity of molecular dynamics on changes in the potential energy\nfunction plays an important role in understanding the dynamics and function of\ncomplex molecules.We present a method to obtain path ensemble averages of a\nperturbed dynamics from a set of paths generated by a reference dynamics. It is\nbased on the concept of path probability measure and the Girsanov theorem, a\nresult from stochastic analysis to estimate a change of measure of a path\nensemble. Since Markov state models (MSM) of the molecular dynamics can be\nformulated as a combined phase-space and path ensemble average, the method can\nbe extended toreweight MSMs by combining it with a reweighting of the Boltzmann\ndistribution. We demonstrate how to efficiently implement the Girsanov\nreweighting in a molecular dynamics simulation program by calculating parts of\nthe reweighting factor \"on the fly\" during the simulation, and we benchmark the\nmethod on test systems ranging from a two-dimensional diffusion process to an\nartificial many-body system and alanine dipeptide and valine dipeptide in\nimplicit and explicit water. The method can be used to study the sensitivity of\nmolecular dynamics on external perturbations as well as to reweight\ntrajectories generated by enhanced sampling schemes to the original dynamics.\n", "  A symmetry witness is a suitable subset of the space of selfadjoint trace\nclass operators that allows one to determine whether a linear map is a symmetry\ntransformation, in the sense of Wigner. More precisely, such a set is invariant\nwith respect to an injective densely defined linear operator in the Banach\nspace of selfadjoint trace class operators (if and) only if this operator is a\nsymmetry transformation. According to a linear version of Wigner's theorem, the\nset of pure states, the rank-one projections, is a symmetry witness. We show\nthat an analogous result holds for the set of projections with a fixed rank\n(with some mild constraint on this rank, in the finite-dimensional case). It\nturns out that this result provides a complete classification of the set of\nprojections with a fixed rank that are symmetry witnesses. These particular\nsymmetry witnesses are projectable; i.e., reasoning in terms of quantum states,\nthe sets of uniform density operators of corresponding fixed rank are symmetry\nwitnesses too.\n", "  Silicon nitride is awell-established material for photonic devices and\nintegrated circuits. It displays a broad transparency window spanning from the\nvisible to the mid-IR and waveguides can be manufactured with low losses. An\nabsence of nonlinear multi-photon absorption in the erbium lightwave\ncommunications band has enabled various nonlinear optic applications in the\npast decade. Silicon nitride is a dielectric material whose optical and\nmechanical properties strongly depend on the deposition conditions. In\nparticular, the optical bandgap can be modified with the gas flow ratio during\nlow-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Here we show that this\nparameter can be controlled in a highly reproducible manner, providing an\napproach to synthesize the nonlinear Kerr coefficient of the material. This\nholistic empirical study provides relevant guidelines to optimize the\nproperties of LPCVD silicon nitride waveguides for nonlinear optics\napplications that rely on the Kerr effect.\n", "  We provide a comprehensive analysis of the power of including top\nquark-polarisation information to kinematically challenging $t\\bar t$ resonance\nsearches, for which ATLAS and CMS start losing sensitivity. Following the\ngeneral modeling and analysis strategies pursued by the experiments, we analyse\nthe semi-leptonic and the di-lepton $t\\bar t$ channels and show that including\npolarisation information can lead to large improvements in the limit setting\nprocedures with large data sets. This will allow us to set limits for parameter\nchoices where sensitivity from $m(t\\bar t)$ is not sufficient. This highlights\nthe importance of spin observables as part of a more comprehensive set of\nobservables to gain sensitivity to BSM resonance searches.\n", "  We explain how one-loop amplitudes with massive fermions can be computed\nusing only on-shell information. We first use the spinor-helicity formalism in\nsix dimensions to perform generalised unitarity cuts in $d$ dimensions. We then\nshow that divergent wavefunction cuts can be avoided, and the remaining\nambiguities in the renormalised amplitudes can be fixed, by matching to\nuniversal infrared poles in $4-2\\epsilon$ dimensions and ultraviolet poles in\n$6-2\\epsilon$ dimensions. In the latter case we construct an effective\nLagrangian in six dimensions and reduce the additional constraint to an\non-shell tree-level computation.\n", "  We present the first comparisons of experimental data with phenomenological\nresults from 3+1d quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydroQP). We\ncompare charged-hadron multiplicity, identified-particle spectra,\nidentified-particle average transverse momentum, charged-particle elliptic\nflow, and identified-particle elliptic flow produced in LHC 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb\ncollisions. The dynamical equations used for the hydrodynamic stage utilize\nnon-conformal aHydroQP. The resulting aHydroQP framework naturally includes\nboth shear and bulk viscous effects in addition to higher-order non-linear\ntransport coefficients. The 3+1d aHydroQP evolution obtained is\nself-consistently converted to hadrons using anisotropic Cooper-Frye freezeout\nperformed on a fixed-energy-density hypersurface. The final production and\ndecays of the primordial hadrons are modeled using a customized version of\nTHERMINATOR 2. In this first study, we utilized smooth Glauber-type initial\nconditions and a single effective freeze-out temperature T_FO = 130 MeV with\nall hadronic species in full chemical equilibrium. With this rather simple\nsetup, we find a very good description of many heavy-ion observables.\n", "  Yield ratios of identified hadrons observed in high multiplicity p+p and p+Pb\ncollisions at LHC show remarkable similarity with those in Pb+Pb collisions,\nindicating some important and universal underlying dynamics in hadron\nproduction for different quark gluon final states. We use the quark combination\nmodel to explain the data of yield ratios in these three collision systems. The\nobserved $p/\\pi$ and $\\Lambda/K_s^0$ can be reproduced simultaneously by quark\ncombination, and these two ratios reflect the rate of baryon production at\nhadronization which is the same in light sector and strange sector and is\nroughly constant in p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb collision systems over three orders of\nmagnitude in charged particle multiplicity.The data of $K_s^0/\\pi$,\n$\\Lambda/\\pi$, $\\Xi/\\pi$ and $\\Omega/\\pi$ show a hierarchy behavior relating to\nthe strangeness content, and are naturally explained by quark combination both\nin the saturate stage at high multiplicity and in the increase stage at\nmoderate multiplicity. Our results suggest that the dynamical characteristic of\nquark combination is necessary in describing the production of hadrons in small\nsystems created in p+p and p+Pb collisions.\n", "  The most general two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) includes potentially large\nsources of flavor changing neutral currents (FCNCs) that must be suppressed in\norder to achieve a phenomenologically viable model. The flavor alignment ansatz\npostulates that all Yukawa coupling matrices are diagonal when expressed in the\nbasis of mass-eigenstate fermion fields, in which case tree-level Higgs\nmediated FCNCs are eliminated. In this work, we explore models with the flavor\nalignment condition imposed at a very high energy scale, which results in the\ngeneration of Higgs-mediated FCNCs via renormalization group running from the\nhigh energy scale to the electroweak scale. Using the current experimental\nbounds on flavor changing observables, constraints are derived on the aligned\n2HDM parameter space. In the favored parameter region, we analyze the\nimplications for Higgs boson phenomenology.\n", "  We study the critical properties of net-baryon-number fluctuations at the\nchiral restoration transition in a medium at finite temperature and net baryon\ndensity. The chiral dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is modeled by the\nPolykov-loop extended Quark-Meson Lagrangian, that includes the coupling of\nquarks to vector meson and temporal gauge fields. The Functional\nRenormalization Group is employed to properly account for the $O(4)$\ncriticality at the phase boundary. We focus on the properties and systematics\nof ratios of the net-baryon-number cumulants $\\chi_B^n$, for ${1\\leq n\\leq 6}$,\nnear the phase boundary. The results are presented in the context of the recent\nexperimental data of the STAR Collaboration on fluctuations of the net proton\nnumber in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. We show that the model results for the\nenergy dependence of the cumulant ratios are in good overall agreement with the\ndata, with one exception. At center-of-mass energies below\n${19.6\\;\\mathrm{GeV}}$, we find that the measured fourth-order cumulant\ndeviates considerably from the model results, which incorporate the expected\n$O(4)$ and $Z(2)$ criticality. We assess the influence of model assumptions and\nin particular of repulsive vector-interactions, which are used to modify the\nlocation of the critical endpoint in the model, on the cumulants ratios.\nFinally, we discuss a possibility to test to what extent the fluctuations are\naffected by nonequilibrium dynamics by comparing certain ratios of cumulants.\n", "  Hadronic jets in deeply inelastic electron-proton collisions are produced by\nthe scattering of a parton from the proton with the virtual gauge boson\nmediating the interaction. The HERA experiments have performed precision\nmeasurements of inclusive single jet production and di-jet production in the\nBreit frame, which provide important constraints on the strong coupling\nconstant and on parton distributions in the proton. We describe the calculation\nof the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to these processes,\nand assess their size and impact. A detailed comparison with data from the H1\nand ZEUS experiments highlights that inclusive single jet production displays a\nbetter perturbative convergence than di-jet production. We also observe that\nthe event selection cuts in some of the di-jet measurements of both H1 and ZEUS\ninduce an infrared sensitivity that destabilises the perturbative stability of\nthe predictions. Our results open up new opportunities for QCD precision\nstudies with jet production observables in deep inelastic scattering.\n", "  The original Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group B is the common asymptotic\nsymmetry group of all asymptotically flat Lorentzian radiating 4-dim\nspace-times. As such, B is the best candidate for the universal symmetry group\nof General Relativity (G.R.). In 1973, with this motivation, P. J. McCarthy\nclassified all relativistic B-invariant-systems in terms of strongly continuous\nirreducible unitary repesentations (IRS) of B. Here we introduce the analogue\nB(2,1) of the BMS group B in 3 space-time dimensions. B(2,1) itself admits\nthirty-four analogues both real in all signatures and in complex space-times.\nIn order to find the IRS of both B(2,1) and its analogues we need to extend\nWigner-Mackey's theory of induced representations. The necessary extension is\ndescribed and is reduced to the solution of three problems. These problems are\nsolved in the case where B(2,1) and its analogues are equipped with the Hilbert\ntopology. The extended theory is necessary in order to construct the IRS of\nboth B and its analogues in any number d of space-time dimensions, d is greater\nor equal to 3, and also in order to construct the IRS of their supersymmetric\ncounterparts. We use the extended theory to obtain the necessary data in order\nto construct the IRS of B(2,1): The main results of the representation theory\nare: The IRS are induced from little groups which are compact. The finite\nlittle groups are cyclic groups of even order. The inducing construction is\nexhaustive notwithstanding the fact that B(2,1) is not locally compact in the\nemployed Hilbert topology.\n", "  Artificial molecular states of double quantum dots defined in bilayer\ngraphene are studied with the atomistic tight-binding and its low-energy\ncontinuum approximation. We indicate that the extended electron wave functions\nhave opposite parities on each of the sublattices at both graphene layers and\nthat the ground-state wave function components change from bonding to\nantibonding with the interdot distance. In the weak coupling limit -- the most\nrelevant for the quantum dots defined electrostatically -- the signatures of\nthe interdot coupling include -- for the two-electron ground state -- formation\nof states with symmetric or antisymmetric spatial wave functions split by the\nexchange energy. In the high energy part of the spectrum the states with both\nelectrons in the same dot are found with the splitting of energy levels\ncorresponding to simultaneous tunneling of the electron pair from one dot to\nthe other.\n", "  A particular population of galaxies have drawn much interest recently, which\nare as faint as typical dwarf galaxies but have the sizes as large as $L^*$\ngalaxies, the so called \"ultra-diffuse galaxie\" (UDGs). The lack of tidal\nfeatures of UDGs in dense environments suggests that their host halos are\nperhaps as massive as that of the Milky Way. On the other hand, galaxy\nformation efficiency should be much higher in the halos of such masses. Here we\nuse the model galaxy catalog generated by populating two large simulations: the\nMillennium-II cosmological simulation and Phoenix simulations of 9 big clusters\nwith the semi-analytic galaxy formation model. This model reproduces remarkably\nwell the observed properties of UDGs in the nearby clusters, including the\nabundance, profile, color, and morphology, etc. We search for UDG candidates\nusing the public data and find 2 UDG candidates in our Local Group and 23 in\nour Local Volume, in excellent agreement with the model predictions. We\ndemonstrate that UDGs are genuine dwarf galaxies, formed in the halos of $\\sim\n10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. It is the combination of the late formation time and\nhigh-spins of the host halos that results in the spatially extended feature of\nthis particular population. The lack of tidal disruption features of UDGs in\nclusters can also be explained by their late infall-time.\n", "  The effect of magnetic turbulence in shaping the current density in\naxisymmetric magnetized plasma is analyzed using a turbulent extension of Ohm's\nlaw derived from the self-consistent action-angle transport theory. Besides the\nwell-known hyper-resistive (helicity-conserving) contribution, the generalized\nOhm's law contains an anomalous resistivity term, and a turbulent\nbootstrap-like term proportional to the current density derivative. The\nnumerical solution of the equation for equilibrium and turbulence profiles\ncharacteristic of conventional and advanced scenarios shows that, trough\n\"turbulent bootstrap\" effect and anomalous resistivity turbulence can generate\npower and parallel current which are a sizable portion (about 20-25%) of the\ncorresponding effects associated with the neoclassical bootstrap effect. The\ndegree of alignment of the turbulence peak and the pressure gradient plays an\nimportant role in defining the steady-state regime. In fully bootstrapped\ntokamak, the hyper-resistivity is essential in overcoming the intrinsic\nlimitation of the hollow current profile.\n", "  The correlation holography reconstructs 3D objects as a distribution of\ntwo-point correlation of the random field detected by two dimensional detector\narrays. Here, we describe a hybrid method, a combination of optical and\ncomputational channels, to reconstruct the objects from only a single pixel\ndetector. An experimental arrangement is proposed and as a first step to\nrealize the technique, we have simulated the experimental model for both scalar\nand vectorial objects. Proposed technique affords background free imaging with\n3D capability.\n", "  A series of Ni0.6-x/2Zn0.4-x/2SnxFe2O4 (x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and\n0.3) (NZSFO) ferrite composites have been synthesized from nano powders using\nstandard solid state reaction technique. The spinel cubic structure of the\ninvestigated samples has been observed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD). The\nmagnetic properties such as saturation magnetization (Ms), remanent\nmagnetization (Mr), coercive field (Hc) and Bohr magneton (B) are calculated\nfrom the hysteresis loops. The value of Ms is found to decrease with increasing\nSn content in the samples. This change has been successfully explained by the\nvariation of A-B interaction strength due to Sn substitution in different\nsites. The compositional stability and quality of the prepared ferrite\ncomposites have also been endorsed by the fairly constant initial permeability\n(/) over a wide range of frequency region. The decreasing trend of / with\nincreasing Sn content has been observed. Curie temperature (TC) has found to\nincrease with the increase in Sn content. Wide spread frequency utility zone\nindicates that the NZSFO can be considered as a good candidate for use in\nbroadband pulse transformer and wide band read-write heads for video recording.\nThe abnormal behavior for x = 0.05 has been explained with existing theory.\n", "  In this letter, a matrix method is employed to study the scalar quasinormal\nmodes of Kerr as well as Kerr-Sen black holes. Discretization is applied to\ntransfer the scalar perturbation equation into a matrix form eigenvalue\nproblem, where the resulting radial and angular equations are derived by the\nmethod of separation of variables. The eigenvalues, quasinormal frequencies\n$\\omega$ and angular quantum numbers $\\lambda$, are then obtained by\nnumerically solving the resultant homogeneous matrix equation. This work shows\nthat the present approach is an accurate as well as efficient method for\ninvestigating quasinormal modes.\n", "  Two hybrid van der Waals density functionals (vdW-DFs) are constructed using\n25%, Fock exchange with i) the consistent-exchange vdW-DF-cx functional and ii)\nwith the vdW-DF2 functional. The ability to describe covalent and non-covalent\nbinding properties of molecules are assessed. For properties related to\ncovalent binding, atomization energies (G2-1 set), molecular reaction energies\n(G2RC set), as well as ionization energies (G21IP set) are benchmarked against\nexperimental reference values. We find that hybrid-vdW-DF-cx yields results\nthat are rather similar to those of the standard non-empirical hybrid PBE0 [JCP\n110, 6158 (1996)]. Hybrid vdW-DF2 follows somewhat different trends, showing on\naverage significantly larger deviations from the reference energies, with a MAD\nof 14.5 kcal/mol for the G2-1 set. Non-covalent binding properties of molecules\nare assessed using the S22 benchmark set of non-covalently bonded dimers and\nthe X40 set of dimers of small halogenated molecules, using wavefunction-based\nquantum chemistry results for references. For the S22 set, hybrid-vdW-DF-cx\nperforms better than standard vdW-DF-cx for the mostly hydrogen-bonded systems.\nHybrid-vdW-DF2 offers a slight improvement over standard vdW-DF2. Similar\ntrends are found for the X40 set, with hybrid-vdW-DF-cx performing particularly\nwell for binding involving the strongly polar hydrogen halides, but poorly for\nsystems with tiny binding energies. Our study of the X40 set reveals both the\npotential of mixing Fock exchange with vdW-DF, but also highlights shortcomings\nof the hybrids constructed here. The solid performance of hybrid-vdW-DF-cx for\ncovalent-bonded systems, as well as the strengths and issues uncovered for\nnon-covalently bonded systems, makes this study a good starting point for\ndeveloping even more precise hybrid vdW-DFs.\n", "  We show that bulk quantities localized on a minimal surface homologous to a\nboundary region correspond in the CFT to operators that commute with the\nmodular Hamiltonian associated with the boundary region. If two such minimal\nsurfaces intersect at a point in the bulk then CFT operators which commute with\nboth extended modular Hamiltonians must be localized at the intersection point.\nWe use this to construct local bulk operators purely from CFT considerations,\nwithout knowing the bulk metric, using intersecting modular Hamiltonians. For\nconformal field theories at zero and finite temperature the appropriate modular\nHamiltonians are known explicitly and we recover known expressions for local\nbulk observables.\n", "  We study the excess of (Renyi) entanglement entropy in various free field\ntheories for the locally excited states defined by acting with local operators\non the ground state. It is defined by subtracting the entropy for the ground\nstate from the one for the excited state. Here the spacetime dimension is\ngreater than or equal to 4. We find a correspondence between entanglement and a\nprobability. The probability with which a quasi-particle exists in a subregion\ngives the excess of the entropy. We also propose a toy model which reproduces\nthe excess in the replica method. In this model, a quasi-particle created by a\nlocal operator propagates freely and its probability distribution gives the\nexcess.\n", "  The lambda model is a one parameter deformation of the principal chiral model\nthat arises when regularizing the non-compactness of a non-abelian T dual in\nstring theory. It is a current-current deformation of a WZW model that is known\nto be integrable at the classical and quantum level. The standard techniques of\nthe quantum inverse scattering method cannot be applied because the Poisson\nbracket is non ultra-local. Inspired by an approach of Faddeev and Reshetikhin,\nwe show that in this class of models, there is a way to deform the symplectic\nstructure of the theory leading to a much simpler theory that is ultra-local\nand can be quantized on the lattice whilst preserving integrability. This\nlattice theory takes the form of a generalized spin chain that can be solved by\nstandard algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques. We then argue that the IR limit of\nthe lattice theory lies in the universality class of the lambda model implying\nthat the spin chain provides a way to apply the quantum inverse scattering\nmethod to this non ultra-local theory. This points to a way of applying the\nsame ideas to other lambda models and potentially the string world-sheet theory\nin the gauge-gravity correspondence.\n", "  A quasi-relativistic two-component approach for an efficient calculation of\n$\\mathcal{P,T}$-odd interactions caused by a permanent electric dipole moment\nof the electron (eEDM) is presented. The approach uses a (two-component)\ncomplex generalized Hartree-Fock (cGHF) and a complex generalized Kohn-Sham\n(cGKS) scheme within the zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA). In\napplications to select heavy-elemental polar diatomic molecular radicals, which\nare promising candidates for an eEDM experiment, the method is compared to\nrelativistic four-component electron-correlation calculations and confirms\nvalues for the effective electrical field acting on the unpaired electron for\nRaF, BaF, YbF and HgF. The calculations show that purely relativistic effects,\ninvolving only the lower component of the Dirac bi-spinor, are well described\nby treating only the upper component explicitly.\n", "  We present results and suggestions on how to confirm the existence and\nresonant nature of the $Pc(4450)$ detected at LHCb through photoproduction\nexperiments. We find that this narrow structure might have escaped detection in\npast experiments and use those to give a constraint for the upper limit of the\nbranching ratio/coupling to the $J/\\psi p$ channel.\n", "  First principles molecular dynamics simulation protocol is established using\nrevised functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (revPBE) in conjunction with\nGrimme's third generation of dispersion (D3) correction to describe properties\nof water at ambient conditions. This study also demonstrates the consistency of\nthe structure of water across both isobaric (NpT) and isothermal (NVT)\nensembles. Going beyond the standard structural benchmarks for liquid water, we\ncompute properties that are connected to both local structure and mass density\nuctuations that are related to concepts of solvation and hydrophobicity. We\ndirectly compare our revPBE results to the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) plus\nGrimme dispersion corrections (D2) and both the empirical fixed charged model\n(SPC/E) and many body interaction potential model (MB-pol) to further our\nunderstanding of how the computed properties herein depend on the form of the\ninteraction potential.\n", "  Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond allow for coherent spin state\nmanipulation at room temperature, which could bring dramatic advances to\nnanoscale sensing and quantum information technology. We introduce a novel\nmethod for the optical measurement of the spin contrast in dense\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles. This method brings a new insight into the\ninterplay between the spin contrast and fluorescence lifetime. We show that for\nimproving the spin readout sensitivity in NV ensembles, one should aim at\nmodifying the far field radiation pattern rather than enhancing the emission\nrate.\n", "  We propose a theoretical framework that captures the geometric vector\npotential emerging from the non-adiabatic spin dynamics of itinerant carriers\nsubject to arbitrary magnetic textures. Our approach results in a series of\nconstraints on the geometric potential and the non-adiabatic geometric phase\nassociated with it. These constraints play a decisive role when studying the\ngeometric spin phase gathered by conducting electrons in ring interferometers\nunder the action of in-plane magnetic textures, allowing a simple\ncharacterization of the topological transition recently reported by Saarikoski\net al. [Phys. Rev. B 91, 241406(R) (2015)] in Ref. 1.\n", "  We present the structural and dynamical studies of layered vanadium\npentaoxide (V2O5). The temperature dependent X-ray diffraction measurements\nreveal highly anisotropic and anomalous thermal expansion from 12 K to 853 K.\nThe results do not show any evidence of structural phase transition or\ndecomposition of {\\alpha}-V2O5, contrary to the previous transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments. The\ninelastic neutron scattering measurements performed up to 673 K corroborate the\nresult of our X-ray diffraction measurements. The analysis of the experimental\ndata is carried out using ab-initio lattice dynamics calculation. The important\nrole of van der-Waals dispersion and Hubbard interactions on the structure and\ndynamics is revealed through the ab-initio calculations. The calculated\nanisotropic thermal expansion behavior agrees well with temperature dependent\nX- ray diffraction. The mechanism of anisotropic thermal expansion and\nanisotropic linear compressibility is discussed in terms of calculated\nanisotropy in Gr\\\"uneisen parameters and elastic coefficients. The calculated\nGibbs free energy in various phases of V2O5 is used to understand the high\npressure and temperature phase diagram of the compound. Softening of elastic\nconstant (C66) with pressure suggests a possibility of shear mechanism for\n{\\alpha} to \\b{eta} phase transformation under pressure.\n", "  The multi-quantum well (MQW) organic-inorganic perovskite offer an approach\nof tuning the exciton binding energy based on the well-barrier dielectric\nmismatch effect, which called the image charge effect. The exfoliation from MQW\norganic-inorganic perovskite forms a twodimensional (2D) nano-sheet. As with\nother 2D materials, like graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),\nthe ultra-thin perovskites layers are highly sensitive to the dielectric\nenvironment. We investigate the ultrathin crystalline 2D van-der-Waals (vdW)\nlayers of organic-inorganic perovskite crystals close to a surface of the\nsubstrate. We show that binding exciton energy is strongly influenced by the\nsurrounding dielectric environment. We find that the Keldysh model somehow\nestimates the strong dependence of the exciton binding energies on\nenvironmental screening. We compare our binding energies results with\nexperimental results in the (C6H13NH3)2PbI4 perovskite, and we estimate the\nbinding energy values of (C4H9NH3)2PbBr4.\n", "  Cosmic Rays (CR) are particles which come to the earth from Universe. Their\norigin and production mechanisms are still unknown. The Pierre Auger\nObservatory is located in Mendoza, Argentina. It is dedicated to the study of\nCR. When CR arrive to the earth's atmosphere they produce a shower of secondary\nparticles called \\textit{air shower}. The surface detector (SD) of the Pierre\nAuger Observatory consists of tanks full of pure water, where CR produce\n\\textit{Cherenkov radiation}, when going through them. This light is detected\nby three photomultiplier tubes (PMT) located on the top of each tank. Depending\nof the angle of arrival direction of the primary CR, each PMT is able to\nregister different signal than the other. The goal of this study is to look at\nthese effects of direct light on the PMT's to explore if they change in time.\nThe obtained results may give information about the physical status of the\ntanks in order to monitor the work of the SD, and to estimate possible\nsystematic effects on the measurements. The current results of this study are\nshown.\n", "  Cosmic Rays (CR) are high energy particles which come from the universe. When\none of those particles enters to the atmosphere of the earth it produces an air\nshower, conformed by secondary particles in which the initial energy is\ndistributed. The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in Argentina, is dedicated\nto the study of those events. One of the main goals is to find out where those\nCR are coming from and which kind of chemical composition do they have. In this\nwork we show the status of a study of the risetime as a function of the\ndistance to the shower core (near to the air axis of the shower) for different\nzenith angles and energies, obtaining a new variable that will be compared with\nother variables used by the Observatory. The main objective of this study is to\nbetter understand risetime as a mass composition sensitive parameter of CR.\n", "  We show that a recently conjectured form for perturbative supersymmetric\npartition functions on spheres of general dimension $d$ is consistent with the\nflat space limit of 6-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills. We also\nshow that the partition functions for $\\mathcal{N}=1$ 8- and 9-dimensional\ntheories are consistent with their known flat space limits.\n", "  We employ two-dimensional (2D) coherent, nonlinear spectroscopy to\ninvestigate couplings within individual InAs quantum dots (QD) and QD\nmolecules. Swapping pulse ordering in a two-beam sequence permits to\ndistinguish between rephasing and non-rephasing four-wave mixing (FWM)\nconfigurations. We emphasize the non-rephasing case, allowing to monitor\ntwo-photon coherence dynamics. Respective Fourier transform yields a double\nquantum 2D FWM map, which is corroborated with its single quantum counterpart,\noriginating from the rephasing sequence. We introduce referencing of the FWM\nphase with the one carried by the driving pulses, overcoming the necessity of\nits active-stabilization, as required in 2D spectroscopy. Combining single and\ndouble quantum 2D FWM, provides a pertinent tool in detecting and ascertaining\ncoherent coupling mechanisms between individual quantum systems, as exemplified\nexperimentally.\n", "  The Regge trajectory of an elastic resonance can be calculated from\ndispersion theory, instead of fitted phenomenologically, using only its pole\nparameters as input. This also provides a correct treatment of resonance widths\nin Regge trajectories, essential for very wide resonances. In this work we\nfirst calculate the K*0(1430) Regge trajectory, finding the ordinary almost\nreal and linear behavior, typical of quark-antiquark resonances. In contrast,\nfor the K*0(800) meson, the resulting Regge trajectory is non-linear and has a\nmuch smaller slope than ordinary resonances, being remarkably similar to that\nof the f0(500) or sigma meson. The slope of these unusual Regge trajectories\nseems to scale with the meson masses rather than with scales typical of quark\ndegrees of freedom. We also calculate the range of the interaction responsible\nfor the formation of these resonances. Our results strongly support a\nnon-ordinary, predominantly meson-meson-like, interpretation for the lightest\nstrange and non-strange resonances.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been performed\nto study the jamming and percolation behavior of linear $k$-mers (also known as\nrods or needles) on the two-dimensional triangular lattice, considering an\nisotropic RSA process on a lattice of linear dimension $L$ and periodic\nboundary conditions. Extensive numerical work has been done to extend previous\nstudies to larger system sizes and longer $k$-mers, which enables the\nconfirmation of a nonmonotonic size dependence of the percolation threshold and\nthe estimation of a maximum value of $k$ from which percolation would no longer\noccurs. Finally, a complete analysis of critical exponents and universality\nhave been done, showing that the percolation phase transition involved in the\nsystem is not affected, having the same universality class of the ordinary\nrandom percolation.\n", "  The formalism of the reduced density matrix is pursued in both length and\nvelocity gauges of the perturbation to the crystal Hamiltonian. The covariant\nderivative is introduced as a convenient representation of the position\noperator. This allow us to write compact expressions for the reduced density\nmatrix in any order of the perturbation which simplifies the calculations of\nnonlinear optical responses; as an example, we compute the first and third\norder contributions of the monolayer graphene. Expressions obtained in both\ngauges share the same formal structure, allowing a comparison of the effects of\ntruncation to a finite set of bands. This truncation breaks the equivalence\nbetween the two approaches: its proper implementation can be done directly in\nthe expressions derived in the length gauge, but require a revision of the\nequations of motion of the reduced density matrix in the velocity gauge.\n", "  We introduce a modified molecular dynamics algorithm that allows one to\nfreeze the dynamics of parts of a physical system, and thus concentrate the\nsimulation effort on selected, central degrees of freedom. This freezing, in\ncontrast to other multi-scale methods, introduces no approximations in the\nthermodynamic behaviour of the non-central variables while conserving the\nNewtonian dynamics of the region of physical interest.\n", "  Long waves in shallow water propagating over a background shear flow towards\na sloping beach are being investigated. The classical shallow-water equations\nare extended to incorporate both a background shear flow and a linear beach\nprofile, resulting in a non-reducible hyperbolic system. Nevertheless, it is\nshown how several changes of variables based on the hodograph transform may be\nused to transform the system into a linear equation which may be solved exactly\nusing the method of separation of variables. This method can be used to\ninvestigate the run-up of a long wave on a planar beach including the\ndevelopment of the shoreline.\n", "  Spherical shell dynamo models based on rotating convection show that the flow\nwithin the tangent cylinder is dominated by an off-axis plume that extends from\nthe inner core boundary to high latitudes and drifts westward. Earlier studies\nexplained the formation of such a plume in terms of the effect of a uniform\naxial magnetic field that significantly increases the lengthscale of convection\nin a rotating plane layer. However, rapidly rotating dynamo simulations show\nthat the magnetic field within the tangent cylinder has severe lateral\ninhomogeneities that may influence the onset of an isolated plume. Increasing\nthe rotation rate in our dynamo simulations (by decreasing the Ekman number\n$E$) produces progressively thinner plumes that appear to seek out the location\nwhere the field is strongest. Motivated by this result, we examine the linear\nonset of convection in a rapidly rotating fluid layer subject to a laterally\nvarying axial magnetic field. A cartesian geometry is chosen where the finite\ndimensions $(x,z)$ mimic $(\\phi,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates. The lateral\ninhomogeneity of the field gives rise to a unique mode of instability where\nconvection is entirely confined to the peak-field region. The localization of\nthe flow by the magnetic field occurs even when the field strength (measured by\nthe Elsasser number $\\varLambda$) is small and viscosity controls the smallest\nlengthscale of convection. The lowest Rayleigh number at which an isolated\nplume appears within the tangent cylinder in spherical shell dynamo simulations\nagrees closely with the viscous-mode Rayleigh number in the plane layer linear\nmagnetoconvection model. The localized excitation of viscous-mode convection by\na laterally varying magnetic field provides a mechanism for the formation of\nisolated plumes within Earth's tangent cylinder.\n", "  We study the ground-state entanglement Hamiltonian for an interval of $N$\nsites in a free-fermion chain with arbitrary filling. By relating it to a\ncommuting operator, we find explicit expressions for its matrix elements in the\nlarge-$N$ limit. The results agree with numerical calculations and show that\ndeviations from the conformal prediction persist even for large systems.\n", "  We study the question of whether oscillations between non-relativistic\nneutrinos or between relativistic and non-relativistic neutrinos are possible.\nThe issues of neutrino production and propagation coherence and their impact on\nthe above question are discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that no neutrino\noscillations can occur when neutrinos that are non-relativistic in the\nlaboratory frame are involved, except in a strongly mass-degenerate case. We\nalso discuss how this analysis depends on the choice of the Lorentz frame. Our\nresults are for the most part in agreement with Hinchliffe's rule.\n", "  We show that it is possible to realize quantum superpositions of switched-on\nand -off strong light-matter interaction in a single quantum dot- semiconductor\nmicrocavity system. Such superpositions enable the observation of\ncounterintuitive quantum conditional dynamics effects. Situations are possible\nwhere cavity photons as well as the emitter luminescence display exponential\ndecay but their joint detection probability exhibits vacuum Rabi oscillations.\nRemarkably, these quantum correlations are also present in the nonequilibrium\nsteady state spectra of such coherently driven dissipative quantum systems.\n", "  The present work reports the formation and the characterization of\nantipleptic and symplectic metachronal waves in 3D cilia arrays immersed in a\ntwo-fluid environment, with a viscosity ratio of 20. A coupled\nlattice-Boltzmann-Immersed-Boundary solver is used. The periciliary layer is\nconfined between the epithelial surface and the mucus. Its thickness is chosen\nsuch that the tips of the cilia can penetrate the mucus. A purely\nhydrodynamical feedback of the fluid is taken into account and a coupling\nparameter $\\alpha$ is introduced allowing the tuning of both the direction of\nthe wave propagation, and the strength of the fluid feedback. A comparative\nstudy of both antipleptic and symplectic waves, mapping a cilia inter-spacing\nranging from 1.67 up to 5 cilia length, is performed by imposing the\nmetachrony. Antipleptic waves are found to systematically outperform sympletic\nwaves. They are shown to be more efficient for transporting and mixing the\nfluids, while spending less energy than symplectic, random, or synchronized\nmotions.\n", "  We consider the phenomenon of \"tunnelling of the 3rd kind\", whereby a\nmagnetic field may traverse a classically impenetrable barrier by pair creation\nof unimpeded quantum fermions. These propagate through the barrier and generate\na magnetic field on the other side. We study this numerically using quantum\nfermions coupled to a classical Higgs-gauge system, where we set up a magnetic\nfield outside a box shielded by two superconducting barriers. We examine the\nmagnitude of the internal magnetic field, and find agreement with existing\nperturbative results within a factor of two.\n", "  We report on SPT-CLJ2011-5228, a giant system of arcs created by a cluster at\n$z=1.06$. The arc system is notable for the presence of a bright central image.\nThe source is a Lyman Break galaxy at $z_s=2.39$ and the mass enclosed within\nthe 14 arc second radius Einstein ring is $10^{14.2}$ solar masses. We perform\na full light profile reconstruction of the lensed images to precisely infer the\nparameters of the mass distribution. The brightness of the central image\ndemands that the central total density profile of the lens be shallow. By\nfitting the dark matter as a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White profile---with a\nfree parameter for the inner density slope---we find that the break radius is\n$270^{+48}_{-76}$ kpc, and that the inner density falls with radius to the\npower $-0.38\\pm0.04$ at 68 percent confidence. Such a shallow profile is in\nstrong tension with our understanding of relaxed cold dark matter halos; dark\nmatter only simulations predict the inner density should fall as $r^{-1}$. The\ntension can be alleviated if this cluster is in fact a merger; a two halo model\ncan also reconstruct the data, with both clumps (density going as $r^{-0.8}$\nand $r^{-1.0}$) much more consistent with predictions from dark matter only\nsimulations. At the resolution of our Dark Energy Survey imaging, we are unable\nto choose between these two models, but we make predictions for forthcoming\nHubble Space Telescope imaging that will decisively distinguish between them.\n", "  We explore the idea of asymptotic silence in causal set theory and find that\ncausal sets approximated by continuum spacetimes exhibit behaviour akin to\nasymptotic silence. We make use of an intrinsic definition of spatial distance\nbetween causal set elements in the discrete analogue of a spatial hypersurface.\nUsing numerical simulations for causal sets approximated by D=2,3 and 4\ndimensional Minkowski spacetime, we show that while the discrete distance\nrapidly converges to the continuum distance at a scale roughly an order of\nmagnitude larger than the discreteness scale, it is significantly larger on\nsmall scales. This allows us to define an effective dimension which exhibits\ndimensional reduction in the ultraviolet, while monotonically increasing to the\ncontinuum dimension with increasing continuum distance. We interpret these\nfindings as manifestations of asymptotic silence in causal set theory.\n", "  The prototypical Hydrogen bond in water dimer and Hydrogen bonds in the\nprotonated water dimer, in other small molecules, in water cyclic clusters, and\nin ice, covering a wide range of bond strengths, are theoretically investigated\nby first-principles calculations based on the Density Functional Theory,\nconsidering a standard Generalized Gradient Approximation functional but also,\nfor the water dimer, hybrid and van-der-Waals corrected functionals. We compute\nstructural, energetic, and electrostatic (induced molecular dipole moments)\nproperties. In particular, Hydrogen bonds are characterized in terms of\ndifferential electron densities distributions and profiles, and of the shifts\nof the centres of Maximally localized Wannier Functions. The information from\nthe latter quantities can be conveyed into a single geometric bonding parameter\nthat appears to be correlated to the Mayer bond order parameter and can be\ntaken as an estimate of the covalent contribution to the Hydrogen bond. By\nconsidering the cyclic water hexamer and the hexagonal phase of ice we also\nelucidate the importance of cooperative/anticooperative effects in\nHydrogen-bonding formation.\n", "  Using a combination of magnetometry and magnetotransport techniques, we\nstudied temperature and magnetic field behavior of magnetization in Py/Gd\nheterostructures. It was shown quantitatively that proximity with Py enhances\nmagnetic order of Gd. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that a spin-flop\ntransition observed in a Py/Gd bilayer is due to exchange-spring rotation of\nmagnetization in the Gd layer. Transport measurements show that the\nmagnetoresistance of a [Py(2 nm)/Gd(2 nm)]25 multilayer changes sign at the\ncompensation temperature and below 20 K. The positive magnetoresistance above\nthe compensation temperature can be attributed to an in-plane domain-wall,\nwhich appears because of the structural inhomogeneity of the film over its\nthickness. By measuring the angular dependence of resistance we are able to\ndetermine the angle between magnetizations in the multilayer and the magnetic\nfield at different temperatures. The measurement reveals that due to a change\nof the chemical thickness profile, a non-collinear magnetization configuration\nis only stable in magnetic fields above 10 kOe.\n", "  We investigate the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure of a blowout jet\noriginated in the west edge of NOAA Active Region (AR) 11513 on 02 July 2012 by\nmeans of recently developed forced field extrapolation (FFE) model. The results\nshow that the blowout jet was caused by the eruption of the magnetic flux rope\n(MFR) consisting of twisted field lines. We further calculate the twist number\n$\\mathcal{T}_{w}$ and squashing factor Q of the reconstructed magnetic field\nand find that (1) the MFR corresponds well to the high $\\mathcal{T}_{w}$ region\n(2) the MFR outer boundary corresponds well to the high Q region, probably\ninterpreting the bright structure at the base of the jet. The twist number of\nthe MFR is estimated to be $\\mathcal{T}_{w}=-1.54\\pm 0.67$. Thus, the kink\ninstability is regarded as the initiation mechanism of the blowout jet as\n$\\mathcal{T}_{w}$ reaching or even exceeding the threshold value of the kink\ninstability. Our results also indicate that the bright point at the decaying\nphase is actually comprised of some small loops that are heated by the\nreconnection occurred above. In summary, the blowout jet is mostly consistent\nwith the scenario proposed by \\citet{mcs10} except that the kink instability is\nfound to be a possible trigger.\n", "  Using 2.93~fb$^{-1}$ of data taken at 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector\noperated at the BEPCII collider, we study the semileptonic decays $D^+ \\to \\bar\nK^0e^+\\nu_e$ and $D^+ \\to \\pi^0 e^+\\nu_e$. We measure the absolute decay\nbranching fractions $\\mathcal B(D^+ \\to \\bar K^0e^+\\nu_e)=(8.60\\pm0.06\\pm\n0.15)\\times10^{-2}$ and $\\mathcal B(D^+ \\to\n\\pi^0e^+\\nu_e)=(3.63\\pm0.08\\pm0.05)\\times10^{-3}$, where the first\nuncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. We also measure the\ndifferential decay rates and study the form factors of these two decays. With\nthe values of $|V_{cs}|$ and $|V_{cd}|$ from Particle Data Group fits assuming\nCKM unitarity, we obtain the values of the form factors at $q^2=0$, $f^K_+(0) =\n0.725\\pm0.004\\pm 0.012$ and $f^{\\pi}_+(0) = 0.622\\pm0.012\\pm 0.003$. Taking\ninput from recent lattice QCD calculations of these form factors, we determine\nvalues of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{cs}|=0.944 \\pm 0.005 \\pm 0.015 \\pm\n0.024$ and $|V_{cd}|=0.210 \\pm 0.004 \\pm 0.001 \\pm 0.009$, where the third\nuncertainties are theoretical.\n", "  We present a single domain Galerkin-Collocation method to calculate puncture\ninitial data sets for single and binary, either in the trumpet or wormhole\ngeometries. The combination of aspects belonging to the Galerkin and the\nCollocation methods together with the adoption of spherical coordinates in all\ncases show to be very effective. We have proposed a unified expression for the\nconformal factor to describe trumpet and spinning black holes. In particular,\nfor the spinning trumpet black holes, we have exhibited the deformation of the\nlimit surface due to the spin from a sphere to an oblate spheroid. We have also\nrevisited the energy content in the trumpet and wormhole puncture data sets.\nThe algorithm can be extended to describe binary black holes.\n", "  We present an experiment in which a horizontal quasi-2D granular system with\na fixed neighbor network is cyclically compressed and decompressed over 1000\ncycles. We remove basal friction by floating the particles on a thin air\ncushion, so that particles only interact in-plane. As expected for a granular\nsystem, the applied load is not distributed uniformly, but is instead\nconcentrated in force chains which form a network throughout the system. To\nvisualize the structure of these networks, we use particles made from\nphotoelastic material. The experimental setup and a new data-processing\npipeline allow us to map out the evolution subject to the cyclic compressions.\nWe characterize several statistical properties of the packing, including the\nprobability density function of the contact force, and compare them with\ntheoretical and numerical predictions from the force network ensemble theory.\n", "  Optical phase-space functions describe spatial and angular information\nsimultaneously; examples include light fields in ray optics and Wigner\nfunctions in wave optics. Measurement of phase-space enables digital\nrefocusing, aberration removal and 3D reconstruction. High-resolution capture\nof 4D phase-space datasets is, however, challenging. Previous scanning\napproaches are slow, light inefficient and do not achieve diffraction-limited\nresolution. Here, we propose a multiplexed method that solves these problems.\nWe use a spatial light modulator (SLM) in the pupil plane of a microscope in\norder to sequentially pattern multiplexed coded apertures while capturing\nimages in real space. Then, we reconstruct the 3D fluorescence distribution of\nour sample by solving an inverse problem via regularized least squares with a\nproximal accelerated gradient descent solver. We experimentally reconstruct a\n101-Megavoxel 3D volume ($1010\\times510\\times500\\mu$m with NA 0.4),\ndemonstrating improved acquisition time, light throughput and resolution\ncompared to scanning aperture methods. Our flexible patterning scheme further\nallows sparsity in the sample to be exploited for reduced data capture.\n", "  Jets from supermassive black holes in the centres of galaxy clusters are a\npotential candidate for moderating gas cooling and subsequent star formation\nthrough depositing energy in the intra-cluster gas. In this work, we simulate\nthe jet-intra-cluster medium interaction using the moving-mesh\nmagnetohydrodynamics code Arepo. Our model injects supersonic, low density,\ncollimated and magnetised outflows in cluster centres, which are then stopped\nby the surrounding gas, thermalise and inflate low-density cavities filled with\ncosmic-rays. We perform high-resolution, non-radiative simulations of the lobe\ncreation, expansion and disruption, and find that its dynamical evolution is in\nqualitative agreement with simulations of idealised low-density cavities that\nare dominated by a large-scale Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The buoyant rising\nof the lobe does not create energetically significant small-scale chaotic\nmotion in a volume-filling fashion, but rather a systematic upward motion in\nthe wake of the lobe and a corresponding back-flow perpendicular to it. We find\nthat, overall, 50 per cent of the injected energy ends up in material which is\nnot part of the lobe, and about 25 per cent remains in the inner 100 kpc. We\nconclude that jet-inflated, buoyantly rising cavities drive systematic gas\nmotions which play an important role in heating the central regions, while\nmixing of lobe material is sub-dominant. Encouragingly, the main mechanisms\nresponsible for this energy deposition can be modelled already at resolutions\nwithin reach in future, high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy\nclusters.\n", "  Photonic crystal topological insulators host protected states at their edges.\nIn the band structure these edge states appear as continuous bands crossing the\nphotonic band gap. They allow light to propagate unidirectionally and without\nscattering. In practice it is essential to make devices relying on these\neffects as miniature as possible. Here we study all-dielectric photonic\ntopological insulator particles (finite crystals) which do not require a\nmagnetic field. In such particles the edge states' frequencies are discrete.\nNevertheless, the discrete states support pseudospin-dependent unidirectional\npropagation. They allow light to bend around sharp corners similarly to the\ncontinuous edge states and act as topologically protected whispering gallery\nmodes which can store and filter light as well as manipulate its angular\nmomentum. In addition, they explain multiple experimental observations of\ndiscrete transmission peaks in photonic topological insulators.\n", "  A series of atomistic finite temperature simulations on a model of an FCC\nlattice of maghemite nanoparticles using the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\n(sLLG) equation are presented. The model exhibits a ferromagnetic transition\nthat is in good agreement with theoretical expectations. The simulations also\nreveal an orientational disorder in the orientational order parameter for $T <\n0.5 T_c$ due to pinning of the surface domain walls of the nanoparticles by\nsurface vacancies. The extent of the competition between surface pinning and\ndipolar interactions provides support for the conjecture that recent\nmeasurements on systems of FCC superlattices of iron-oxide nanoparticles\nprovide evidence for dipolar ferromagnetism is discussed.\n", "  In this manuscript we report on a near-feld study of two-dimensional\nplasmonic gold nano-wedges using electron energy loss spectroscopy in\ncombination with scanning transmission electron microscopy, as well as\ndiscontinuous Galerkin time-domain computations. With increasing nano-wedge\nsize, we observe a transition from localized surface plasmons on small\nnano-wedges to non-resonant propagating surface plasmon polaritons on large\nnano-wedges. Furthermore we demonstrate that nano-wedges with a groove cut can\nsupport localized as well as propagating plasmons in the same energy range.\n", "  By using an analogy with axionic like systems, we study light propagation in\nperiodic photonic topological insulator (PTI). The main result of this paper is\nan explicit expression for the PTI band structure. More specifically, it was\nfound that for nonzero values of the topological phase difference\n$\\gamma=\\theta_2-\\theta_1$ a finite gap $\\delta \\propto\\gamma^2$ opens in the\nspectrum which is equivalent to appearance of nonzero effective photon mass\n$m^{*}(\\delta)\\propto \\frac{\\sqrt{\\delta}}{\\delta +2}$.\n", "  The magnitude of the pH of the surface of water continues to be a contentious\ntopic in the physical chemistry of aqueous interfaces. Recent theoretical\nstudies have shown little or no preference for the proton to be at the surface\ncompared to the bulk\\cite{baer2014toward}. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics\nsimulations, we revisit the propensity of the excess proton for the air-water\ninterface with a particular focus on the role of instantaneous liquid\ninterfaces. We find a much a stronger propensity of the proton for the surface\nof water. The enhanced water structuring around the proton results in the\npresence of proton wires that run parallel to the surface as well as a\nhydrophobic environment made up of under-coordinated topological defect water\nmolecules, both of which create favorable conditions for proton confinement at\nthe surface. The Grotthuss mechanism within the structured water layer involves\na mixture of both concerted and closely spaced stepwise proton hops. The proton\nmakes excursions within the first solvation layer either in proximity to or\nalong the instantaneous interface.\n", "  In this paper, we address the inverse problem, or the statistical machine\nlearning problem, in Markov random fields with a non-parametric pair-wise\nenergy function with continuous variables. The inverse problem is formulated by\nmaximum likelihood estimation. The exact treatment of maximum likelihood\nestimation is intractable because of two problems: (1) it includes the\nevaluation of the partition function and (2) it is formulated in the form of\nfunctional optimization. We avoid Problem (1) by using Bethe approximation.\nBethe approximation is an approximation technique equivalent to the loopy\nbelief propagation. Problem (2) can be solved by using orthonormal function\nexpansion. Orthonormal function expansion can reduce a functional optimization\nproblem to a function optimization problem. Our method can provide an analytic\nform of the solution of the inverse problem within the framework of Bethe\napproximation.\n", "  The presence of a thermodynamic phase of a three-stranded DNA, namely, a\nmixed phase of bubbles of two bound strands and a single one, is established\nfor large dimensions ($d\\geq 5$) by using exact real space renormalization\ngroup (RG) transformations and exact computations of specific heat for finite\nlength chains. Similar exact computations for the fractal Sierpinski gasket of\ndimension $d<2$ establish the stability of the phase in presence of repulsive\nthree chain interaction. In contrast to the Efimov DNA, where three strands are\nbound though no two are bound, the mixed phase appears on the bound side of the\ntwo chain melting temperature. Both the Efimov-DNA and the mixed phase are\nformed due to strand exchange mechanism.\n", "  We study the quantum stability of the dynamics of ions in a Paul trap. We\nrevisit the results of Wang et al. [Phys. Rev. A 52, 1419 (1995)], which showed\nthat quantum trajectories did not have the same region of stability as their\nclassical counterpart, contrary to what is obtained from a Floquet analysis of\nthe motion in the periodic trapping field. Using numerical simulations of the\nfull wave-packet dynamics, we confirm that the classical trapping criterion are\nfully applicable to quantum motion, when considering both the expectation value\nof the position of the wave packet and its width.\n", "  We study a three-wave truncation of the high-order nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for deepwater waves (HONLS, also named Dysthe equation). We validate\nour approach by comparing it to numerical simulation, distinguish the impact of\nthe different fourth-order terms and classify the solutions according to their\ntopology. This allows us to properly define the temporary spectral upshift\noccurring in the nonlinear stage of Benjamin-Feir instability and provides a\ntool for studying further generalizations of this model.\n", "  Mixing transformations for a uniformly accelerated observer (Rindler\nobserver) are analyzed within the quantum field theory framework as a basis for\ninvestigating gravitational effects on flavor oscillations. In particular, the\ncase of two charged boson fields with different masses is discussed. In spite\nof such a minimal setting, the standard Unruh radiation is found to loose its\ncharacteristic thermal interpretation due to the interplay between the\nBogolubov transformation hiding in field mixing and the one arising from the\nRindler spacetime structure. The modified spectrum detected by the Rindler\nobserver is explicitly calculated in the limit of small mass difference.\n", "  Optical emission spectroscopy applied to non-equilibrium plasmas in molecular\ngases can give important information on basic plasma parameters, including the\nrotational, vibrational temperatures and densities of the investigated\nradiative states. In order to precisely understand the non-equilibrium of\nrotational-vibrational state distribution from investigated spectra without\nlimiting presumptions, a state-by- state temperature-independent fitting\nprocedure is the ideal approach. In this paper we present a novel software tool\ndeveloped for this purpose, freely available for scientific community. The\nintroduced tool offers a convenient way to construct Boltzmann plots even from\npartially overlapping spectra, in user-friendly environment. We apply the novel\nsoftware to the challenging case of OH spectra in surface streamer discharges\ngenerated from the triple-line of argon/water/dielectrics interface. After the\nbarrier discharge is characterised by ICCD and electrical measurements, the\nspatially and phase resolved rotational temperatures from N$_2$ (C-B) and\nOH(A-X) spectra are measured, analysed and compared. The precise analysis shows\nthat OH(A) states with quantum numbers (v' = 0, 9 $\\leq$ N' $\\leq$ 13) are\noverpopulated with respect to the found two-Boltzmann distribution. We\nhypothesise that fast vibrational-energy transfer is responsible for this\nphenomenon observed here for the first time. Finally, the vibrational\ntemperature of the plasma and the relative populations of hot and cold OH(A)\nstates are quantified spatially and phase resolved.\n", "  The differential event rate in Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP)\ndirect detection experiments depends on the local dark matter density and\nvelocity distribution. Accurate modelling of the local dark matter distribution\nis therefore required to obtain reliable constraints on the WIMP particle\nphysics properties. Data analyses typically use a simple Standard Halo Model\nwhich might not be a good approximation to the real Milky Way (MW) halo. We\nreview observational determinations of the local dark matter density, circular\nspeed and escape speed and also studies of the local dark matter distribution\nin simulated MW-like galaxies. We discuss the effects of the uncertainties in\nthese quantities on the energy spectrum and its time and direction dependence.\nFinally we conclude with an overview of various methods for handling these\nastrophysical uncertainties.\n", "  We present an extraction of unpolarized partonic transverse momentum\ndistributions (TMDs) from a simultaneous fit of available data measured in\nsemi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan and Z-boson production. To\nconnect data at different scales, we use TMD evolution at next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy. The analysis is restricted to the low-transverse-momentum\nregion, with no matching to fixed-order calculations at high transverse\nmomentum. We introduce specific choices to deal with TMD evolution at low\nscales, of the order of 1 GeV$^2$. This could be considered as a first attempt\nat a global fit of TMDs.\n", "  We construct rotating extremal black hole and attractor solutions in gravity\ntheories by solving a Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the\nBreitenlohner-Maison linear system. By employing a vectorial Riemann-Hilbert\nfactorization method we explicitly factorize the corresponding monodromy\nmatrices, which have second order poles in the spectral parameter. In the\nunderrotating case we identify elements of the Geroch group which implement\nHarrison-type transformations which map the attractor geometries to\ninterpolating rotating black hole solutions. The factorization method we use\nyields an explicit solution to the linear system, from which we do not only\nobtain the spacetime solution, but also an explicit expression for the master\npotential encoding the potentials of the infinitely many conserved currents\nwhich make this sector of gravity integrable.\n", "  Growth in computational resources has lead to the application of real space\ndiffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) to increasingly heavy elements. Although\ngenerally assumed to be small, we find that when using standard techniques the\npseudopotential localization error can be large, on the order of an electron\nvolt for an isolated cerium atom. We formally show that localization error can\nbe reduced to zero with improvements to the Jastrow factor alone and we define\na metric of Jastrow sensitivity that may be useful in the design of\npseudopotentials. We employ an extrapolation scheme to extract the bare fixed\nnode energy and estimate the localization error in both the locality\napproximation and the T-moves schemes for the Ce atom in charge states 3+ and\n4+. The locality approximation exhibits the lowest Jastrow sensitivity and\ngenerally smaller localization errors than T-moves, although the locality\napproximation energy approaches the localization free limit from above/below\nfor the 3+/4+ charge state. We find that energy minimized Jastrow factors\nincluding three-body electron-electron-ion terms are the most effective at\nreducing localization error for both the locality approximation and T-moves.\nLess complex or variance minimized Jastrows are generally less effective. Our\nresults suggest that further improvements to Jastrow factors and trial\nwavefunction forms will be necessary to reduce localization errors to chemical\naccuracy in calculations of heavy elements.\n", "  We study the time evolution of a thin liquid film coating the outer surface\nof a sphere in the presence of gravity, surface tension and thermal gradients.\nWe derive the fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation that models\nthe thin film dynamics, including Marangoni terms arising from the dependence\nof surface tension on temperature. We consider two different imposed\ntemperature distributions with axial or radial thermal gradients. We analyze\nthe stability of a uniform coating under small perturbations and carry out\nnumerical simulations in COMSOL for a range of parameter values. In the case of\nan axial temperature gradient, we find steady states with either uniform film\nthickness, or with the fluid accumulating at the bottom or near the top of the\nsphere, depending on the total volume of liquid in the film, dictating whether\ngravity or Marangoni effects dominate. In the case of a radial temperature\ngradient, a stability analysis reveals the most unstable non-axisymmetric modes\non an initially uniform coating film.\n", "  Thermodynamic properties as well as low-energy magnon excitations of $S=1$\nhoneycomb-layered Na$_3$Ni$_2$SbO$_6$ have been investigated by high-resolution\ndilatometry, static magnetisation, and high-frequency electron spin resonance\nstudies in magnetic fields up to 16 T. At $T_{\\rm N}$ = 16.5 K, there is a\ntricritical point separating two distinct antiferromagnetic phases AF1 and AF2\nfrom the paramagnetic regime. In addition, our data imply short-range\nantiferromagnetic correlations at least up to $\\sim 5\\cdot T_{\\rm N}$. Well\nbelow $T_{\\rm N}$, the magnetic field $B_{\\rm C1}\\approx$ 9.5 T is needed to\nstabilize AF2 against AF1. The thermal expansion and magnetostriction anomalies\nat $T_{\\rm N}$ and $B_{\\rm C1}$ imply significant magnetoelastic coupling, both\nof which associated with a sign change of $\\partial L/\\partial B$. The\ntransition at $B_{\\rm C1}$ is associated with softening of the\nantiferromagnetic resonance modes observed in the electron spin resonance\nspectra. The anisotropy gap $\\Delta = 360$ GHz implies considerable uniaxial\nanisotropy. We conclude the crucial role of axial anisotropy favoring the AF1\nspin structure over the AF2 one. While the magnetostriction data disprove a\nsimple spin-flop scenario at $B_{\\rm C1}$, the nature of a second transition at\n$B_{\\rm C2}\\approx$ 13 T remains unclear. Both the sign of the magnetostriction\nand Gr\\\"uneisen analysis suggest the short-range correlations at high\ntemperatures to be of AF2-type.\n", "  The bilayers of Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) are often modified with\nadditional normal-metal features such as bars or dots. Previous device\nmeasurements suggest that these features improve performance, reducing\nelectrical noise and altering response times. However, there is currently no\nnumerical model to predict and quantify these effects. Here we extend existing\ntechniques based on Usadel's equations to describe TESs with normal-metal\nfeatures. We show their influence on the principal TES characteristics, such as\nthe small-signal electrothermal parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and the\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$. Additionally, we examine the\neffects of an applied magnetic field on the device performance. Our model\npredicts a decrease in $T_{c}$, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as the number of lateral\nmetal structures is increased. We also obtain a relationship between the length\n$L$ of a TES and its critical temperature, $T_{c} \\propto L^{-0.7}$ for a\nbilayer with normal-metal bars. We predict a periodic magnetic flux dependence\nof $\\alpha, \\beta$ and $I_{c}$. Our results demonstrate good agreement with\npublished experimental data, which also show the reduction of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$\nand $T_{c}$ with increasing number of bars. The observed Fraunhofer dependence\nof critical current on magnetic flux is also anticipated by our model. The\nsuccess of this model in predicting the effects of additional structures\nsuggests that in the future numerical methods can be used to better inform the\ndesign of TESs, prior to device processing.\n", "  Universal characteristics of road networks and traffic patterns can help to\nforecast and control traffic congestion. The antipersistence of traffic flow\ntime series has been found for many data sets, but its relevance for congestion\nhas been overseen. Based on empirical data from motorways in Germany, we study\nhow antipersistence of traffic flow time-series impacts the duration of traffic\ncongestion on a wide range of time scales. We find a large number of short\nlasting traffic jams, which implies a large risk for rear-end collisions.\n", "  We study the approach towards equilibrium in a dynamic Ising model, the Q2R\ncellular automaton, with microscopic reversibility and conserved energy for an\ninfinite one-dimensional system. Starting from a low-entropy state with\npositive magnetisation, we investigate how the system approaches equilibrium\ncharacteristics given by statistical mechanics. We show that the magnetisation\nconverges to zero exponentially. The reversibility of the dynamics implies that\nthe entropy density of the microstates is conserved in the time evolution.\nStill, it appears as if equilibrium, with a higher entropy density is\napproached. In order to understand this process, we solve the dynamics by\nformally proving how the information-theoretic characteristics of the\nmicrostates develop over time. With this approach we can show that an estimate\nof the entropy density based on finite length statistics within microstates\nconverges to the equilibrium entropy density. The process behind this apparent\nentropy increase is a dissipation of correlation information over increasing\ndistances. It is shown that the average information-theoretic correlation\nlength increases linearly in time, being equivalent to a corresponding increase\nin excess entropy.\n", "  We construct an updated and extended compilation of growth rate data\nconsisting of 34 points and including corrections for model dependence. In\norder to maximize the independence of the datapoints we also construct a\nsubsample of this compilation (`Gold' growth dataset) which consists of 18\ndatapoints. We test the consistency of this dataset with the best fit\nPlanck15/$\\Lambda$CDM parameters in the context of General Relativity (GR)\nusing the evolution equation for the growth factor $\\delta(a)$ with a $w$CDM\nbackground. We find tension at the $\\sim 3 \\sigma$ level between the best fit\nparameters $w$ (the dark energy equation of state), $\\Omega_{0m}$ (the matter\ndensity parameter) and $\\sigma_8$ (the matter power spectrum normalization on\nscales $8h^{-1}$Mpc) and the corresponding Planck15/$\\Lambda$CDM parameters. We\nshow that the tension disappears if we allow for evolution of the effective\nNewton's constant, parametrized as $G_{eff}(a)/G_N = 1 +\ng_a(1-a)^n-g_a(1-a)^{2n}$ with $n\\ge2$ where $g_a$, $n$ are parameters of the\nmodel, $a$ is the scale factor and $z = 1/a-1$ is the redshift. This\nparametrization satisfies three criteria: a. $G_{eff} > 0$, b. Consistency with\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis ($G_{eff}(a\\ll 1)/G_N=1$), c. Consistency with solar\nsystem tests ($G_{eff}(a=1)/G_N=1$ and $G_{eff}'(a=1)/G_N=0$). We show that the\nbest fit form of $G_{eff}(z)$ obtained from the growth data corresponds to\nweakening gravity at recent redshifts (decreasing function of $z$) and we\ndemonstrate that this behavior is not consistent with any scalar-tensor\nLagrangian with a real scalar field. Finally, we use MGCAMB to find the best\nfit $G_{eff}(z)$ obtained from the Planck CMB power spectrum on large angular\nscales and show that it is a mildly increasing function of $z$, in $3\\sigma$\ntension with the corresponding decreasing best fit $G_{eff}(z)$ obtained from\nthe growth data.\n", "  We compute the isospin susceptibility in an effective O($n$) scalar field\ntheory (in $d=4$ dimensions), to third order in chiral perturbation theory\n($\\chi$PT) in the delta--regime using the quantum mechanical rotator picture.\nThis is done in the presence of an additional coupling, involving a parameter\n$\\eta$, describing the effect of a small explicit symmetry breaking term (quark\nmass). For the chiral limit $\\eta=0$ we demonstrate consistency with our\nprevious $\\chi$PT computations of the finite-volume mass gap and isospin\nsusceptibility. For the massive case by computing the leading mass effect in\nthe susceptibility using $\\chi$PT with dimensional regularization, we determine\nthe $\\chi$PT expansion for $\\eta$ to third order. The behavior of the shape\ncoefficients for long tube geometry obtained here might be of broader interest.\nThe susceptibility calculated from the rotator approximation differs from the\n$\\chi$PT result in terms vanishing like $1/\\ell$ for $\\ell=L_t/L_s\\to\\infty$.\nWe show that this deviation can be described by a correction to the rotator\nspectrum proportional to the square of the quadratic Casimir invariant.\n", "  We introduce the Hydrangea simulations, a suite of 24 cosmological\nhydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of massive galaxy clusters (M_200c =\n10^14-10^15 M_Sun) with baryon particle masses of ~10^6 M_Sun. Designed to\nstudy the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key\npart of the `Cluster-EAGLE' project (Barnes et al. 2017). They use a galaxy\nformation model developed for the EAGLE project, which has been shown to yield\nboth realistic field galaxies and hot gas fractions of galaxy groups consistent\nwith observations. The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters\nagrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up\nto 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at\nstellar masses Mstar > 10^10 M_Sun this environmental effect is quantitatively\nconsistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function\nmatches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are\nfewer low-mass (Mstar < 10^10 M_Sun) galaxies within the virial radius of\nclusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching.\nConversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in\nclusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts (>\n5r_200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of\n(sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to ~0.3 dex even well beyond\nr_200c. Haloes near clusters are also more concentrated than equally massive\nfield haloes, but these two effects are largely uncorrelated.\n", "  We developed a new nonlinear fluid laser-plasma-instability code (FLAME)\nusing a multi-fluid plasma model combined with full electromagnetic wave\nequations. The completed one-dimensional (1D) version of FLAME was used to\nstudy laser-plasma instabilities in shock ignition. The simulations results\nshowed that absolute SRS modes growing near the quarter-critical surface were\nsaturated by Langmuir-wave Decay Instabilities (LDI) and pump depletion. The\nion-acoustic waves from LDI acted as seeds of stimulated Brillouin Scattering\n(SBS), which displayed a bursting pattern and caused strong pump depletion.\nRe-scattering of SRS at the 1/16th-critical surface was also observed in a high\ntemperature case. These results largely agreed with corresponding\nParticle-in-Cell simulations.\n", "  Nano-mechanical oscillators as well as Rydberg-atomic waveguides hosted on\nmicro-fabricated chip surfaces hold promise to become pillars of future quantum\ntechnologies. In a hybrid platform with both, we show that beams of Rydberg\natoms in waveguides can quantum-coherently interrogate and manipulate\nnanomechanical elements, allowing full quantum state tomography. Central to the\ntomography are quantum non-demolition measurements using the Rydberg atoms as\nprobes. Quantum coherent displacement of the oscillator is also made possible,\nby driving the atoms with external fields while they interact with the\noscillator. We numerically demonstrate the feasibility of this fully integrated\non-chip control and read-out suite for quantum nano-mechanics, taking into\naccount noise and error sources.\n", "  A bird-feather-inspired herringbone riblet texture was investigated for\nturbulent drag reduction. The texture consists of blade riblets in a\nconverging/diverging or herringbone pattern with spanwise wavelength\n$\\Lambda_f$. The aim is to quantify the drag change for this texture as\ncompared to a smooth wall and to study the underlying mechanisms. To that\npurpose, Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flow in a channel with\nheight $L_z$ were performed. The FIK-identity for drag decomposition was\nextended to textured walls and was used to study the drag change mechanisms.\nFor $\\Lambda_f/L_z \\gtrsim O(10)$, the herringbone texture behaves similarly to\na conventional parallel-riblet texture in yaw: the suppression of turbulent\nadvective transport results in a slight drag reduction of 2%. For\n$\\Lambda_f/L_z \\lesssim O(1)$, the drag increases strongly with a maximum of\n73%. This is attributed to enhanced mean and turbulent advection, which results\nfrom the strong secondary flow that forms over regions of riblet\nconvergence/divergence. Hence, the employment of convergent/divergent riblets\nin the texture seems to be detrimental to turbulent drag reduction.\n", "  We present a new technique to measure pulsed magnetic fields based on the use\nof Rubidium in gas phase as a metrological standard. We have therefore\ndeveloped an instrument based on laser inducing transitions at about 780~nm (D2\nline) in a Rubidium gas contained in a mini-cell of 3~mm~x~3~mm cross section.\nTo be able to insert such a cell in a standard high field pulsed magnet we have\nrealized a fibred probe kept at a fixed temperature. Transition frequencies for\nboth the $\\pi$ (light polarization parallel to the magnetic field) and $\\sigma$\n(light polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field) configurations are\nmeasured by a commercial wavemeter. One innovation of our sensor is that in\naddition of monitoring the light transmitted by the Rb cell, which is usual, we\nalso monitor the fluorescence emission of the gas sample from a very small\nvolume with the advantage of reducing the impact of the field inhomogeneity on\nthe field measurement. Our sensor has been tested up to about 58~T.\n", "  We take advantage of the statistical power of the large-volume\ndark-matter-only Millennium simulation, combined with a sophisticated\nsemi-analytic galaxy formation model, to explore whether the recently reported\n$z=3.7$ quiescent galaxy ZF-COSMOS-20115 (ZF; Glazebrook et al. 2017) can be\naccommodated in current galaxy formation models. In our model, a population of\nquiescent galaxies (QGs) with stellar masses and star formation rates\ncomparable to those of ZF naturally emerges at redshifts $z<4$. There are two\nand five ZF analogues at the redshift $3.86$ and $3.58$ in the Millennium\nsimulation volume, respectively. We demonstrate that, while the $z>3.5$ massive\nQGs are rare (about 2\\% of the galaxies with the similar stellar masses), the\nexisting AGN feedback model implemented in the semi-analytic galaxy formation\nmodel can successfully explain the formation of the high-redshift QGs as it\ndoes on their lower redshift counterparts.\n", "  We present the latest results of studies within the MMHT PDF framework. We\ndiscuss the impact of the most recent ATLAS 7 TeV jet data, demonstrating that\nwhile a good fit can be achieved for individual jet rapidity bins, it is not\npossible to achieve a good description of the data when all bins are fitted. We\nexamine the role that the experimental correlated systematic uncertainties play\nin this, and demonstrate that by simply decorrelating no more than two sources\nof error between rapidity bins a remarkably improved description of the data\ncan be achieved. We then study the impact of NNLO corrections, showing that a\nmild decrease in the fit quality is produced. We also present the results of\nincluding new LHC $W$, $Z$, $W+c$ and $t\\overline{t}$ data on the MMHT14 PDF\nset, showing that a marked decrease in the $s+\\overline{s}$ uncertainty is in\nparticular achieved. Finally, some discussion of the latest work towards the\ninclusion of the photon PDF within the MMHT framework is presented.\n", "  We study the charmed and bottomed doubly strange baryons within the\nheavy-quark-light-diquark framework. The two strange quarks are assumed to lie\nin $S$ wave and thus their total spin is 1. We calculate the mass spectra of\nthe $S$ and $P$ wave orbitally excited states and find the $\\Omega_c^0 (2695)$\nand $\\Omega_c^0 (2770)$ fit well as the $S$ wave states of charmed doubly\nstrange baryons. The five newly $\\Omega_c^0(X)$ resonances observed by the LHCb\nCollaboration, i.e. $\\Omega_c^0(3000)$, $\\Omega_c^0(3050)$, $\\Omega_c^0(3066)$,\n$\\Omega_c^0(3090)$, and $\\Omega_c^0(3119)$, can be interpreted as the $P$ wave\norbitally excited states. In heavy quark effective theory, we analyze their\ndecays into the $\\Xi^+_c K^-$ and $\\Xi_c'^+ K^-$, and point out that decays of\nthe five P-wave $\\Omega_c^0$ states into the $\\Xi_c^+ K^-$ and $\\Xi_c'^+K^-$\nare suppressed by either heavy quark symmetry or phase space. The narrowness of\nthe five newly observed $\\Omega_c^0(X)$ states can then be naturally\ninterpreted with heavy quark symmetry.\n", "  The effect of jet mass fluctuations on the fragmentation process is examined\nin the framework of a statistical hadronisation model. In this model, the\nfragmentation scale Q is taken to be the virtuality of the leading parton, and\njet mass fluctuations are accounted for through this quantity. The scale\nevolution of the model is treated in the phi^3 theory with leading-order\nsplitting function and one-loop coupling.\n", "  We present the ground and excited state spectra of $\\Omega^{0}_{c}$ baryons\nwith spin up to 7/2 from lattice quantum chromodynamics with dynamical quark\nfields. Based on our lattice results, we predict the quantum numbers of five\n$\\Omega^{0}_{c}$ baryons, which have recently been observed by the LHCb\nCollaboration. Our results strongly indicate that the observed states\n$\\Omega_c(3000)^0$ and $\\Omega_c(3050)^0$ have spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^{-}$, the\nstates $\\Omega_c(3066)^0$ and $\\Omega_c(3090)^0$ have $J^P = 3/2^{-}$, whereas\n$\\Omega_c(3119)^0$ is possibly a $5/2^{-}$ state.\n", "  The processes of dielectron production in deuteron-proton collisions at\nintermediate incident deuteron beam energies are analyzed in the spectator\nmodel within the one-pion exchange reggeized approach. We focus mainly on the\nmomentum and angle distributions of the proton-spectator and the proton emitted\nin quasi-free $NN$ processes at small angles in the laboratory frame. It is\nshown that the inclusion of many channels in quasi-free $NN$ interaction allows\nus to describe the HADES data quite satisfactorily at incident deuteron kinetic\nenergies of about 2.5 GeV.\n", "  We study convexity or concavity of certain trace functions for the deformed\nlogarithmic and exponential functions, and obtain in this way new trace\ninequalities for deformed exponentials that may be considered as\ngeneralizations of Peierls-Bogolyubov's inequality. We use these results to\nimprove previously known lower bounds for the Tsallis relative entropy.\n", "  We discuss experimental signatures relevant for the LHC domain of energies\nallowing to discriminate possible asymptotic modes of hadron interactions.\n", "  We discuss some different new aspects of $J/\\psi$ meson production in\nexclusive, semi-exclusive and inclusive processes. We finish with a short\ndiscussion of double $J/\\psi$ production. We point out some new results\nobtained recently by our group and discuss some open issues.\n", "  We present a preliminary strategy for modeling multidimensional distributions\nthrough neural networks. We study the efficiency of the proposed strategy by\nconsidering as input data the two-dimensional next-to-next leading order (NNLO)\njet k-factors distribution for the ATLAS 7 TeV 2011 data. We then validate the\nneural network model in terms of interpolation and prediction quality by\ncomparing its results to alternative models.\n", "  We consider a rotor made of two camphor disks glued below the ends of a\nplastic stripe. The disks are floating on a water surface and the plastic\nstripe does not touch the surface. The system can rotate around a vertical axis\nlocated at the center of the stripe. The disks dissipate camphor molecules. The\ndriving momentum comes from the nonuniformity of surface tension resulting from\ninhomogeneous surface concentration of camphor molecules around the disks. We\ninvestigate the stationary angular velocity as a function of rotor radius\n$\\ell$. For large $\\ell$ the angular velocity decreases for increasing $\\ell$.\nAt a specific value of $\\ell$ the angular velocity reaches its maximum and, for\nshort $\\ell$ it rapidly decreases. Such behaviour is confirmed by a simple\nnumerical model. The model also predicts that there is a critical rotor size\nbelow which it does not rotate. Within the introduced model we analyze the type\nof this bifurcation.\n", "  We present an asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric, static, globally\nregular and horizonless solution of SU$(2)$-gauged $\\mathcal{N}=1,d=5$\nsupergravity. The SU$(2)$ gauge field is that of the BPST instanton. We argue\nthat this solution, analogous to the global monopoles found in $d=4$\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ gauged supergravities, describes the field\nof a single string-theory object which does not contribute to the entropy of\nblack holes when we add it to them and show that it is, indeed, the dimensional\nreduction on T$^{5}$ of the gauge 5-brane. We investigate how the energy of the\nsolution is concentrated as a function of the instanton's scale showing that it\nnever violates the hoop conjecture although the curvature grows unboundedly in\nthe zero scale limit.\n", "  The \\b{eta}-decay of 100 Tc has been studied using the Total Absorption\n{\\gamma}-Ray Spectroscopy technique at IGISOL. In this work the new DTAS\nspectrometer in coincidence with a cylindrical plastic \\b{eta} detector has\nbeen employed. The \\b{eta}-intensity to the ground state obtained from the\nanalysis is in good agreement with previous high-resolution measurements.\nHowever, differences in the feeding to the first excited state as well as weak\nfeeding to a new level at high excitation energy have been deduced from this\nexperiment. Theoretical calculations performed in the quasiparticle random-\nphase approximation (QRPA) framework are also reported. Comparison of these\ncalculations with our measurement serves as a benchmark for calculations of the\ndouble \\b{eta}-decay of 100 Mo.\n", "  Strain engineering is a very effective method to continuously tune the\nelectronic, topological, optical and thermoelectric properties of materials. In\nthis work, strain-dependent phonon transport of recently-fabricated antimonene\n(Sb monolayer) under biaxial strain is investigated from a combination of\nfirst-principles calculations and the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation. It\nis found that the ZA dispersion of antimonene with strain less than -1\\% gives\nimaginary frequencies, which suggests that compressive strain can induce\nstructural instability. Experimentally, it is possible to enhance structural\nstability by tensile strain. Calculated results show that lattice thermal\nconductivity increases with strain changing from -1\\% to 6\\%, and lattice\nthermal conductivity at 6\\% strain is 5.6 times larger than that at -1\\% strain\nat room temperature. It is interesting that lattice thermal conductivity is in\ninverse proportion to buckling parameter $h$ in considered strain range. Such a\nstrain dependence of lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to enhanced\nphonon lifetimes caused by increased strain, while group velocities have a\ndecreased effect on lattice thermal conductivity with increasing strain. It is\nfound that acoustic branches dominate the lattice thermal conductivity over the\nfull strain range. The cumulative room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity\nat -1\\% strain converges to maximum with phonon mean free path (MFP) at 50 nm,\nwhile one at 6\\% strain becomes as large as 44 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$, which suggests\nthat strain can give rise to very strong size effects on lattice thermal\nconductivity in antimonene. These results may provide guidance on fabrication\ntechniques of antimonene, and offer perspectives on tuning lattice thermal\nconductivity by size and strain for applications of thermal management and\nthermoelectricity.\n", "  Secret contact interactions among eV sterile neutrinos, mediated by a massive\ngauge boson $X$ (with $M_X \\ll M_W$), and characterized by a gauge coupling\n$g_X$, have been proposed as a mean to reconcile cosmological observations and\nshort-baseline laboratory anomalies. We constrain this scenario using the\nlatest Planck data on Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies, and\nmeasurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We consistently include the\neffect of secret interactions on cosmological perturbations, namely the\nincreased density and pressure fluctuations in the neutrino fluid, and still\nfind a severe tension between the secret interaction framework and cosmology.\nIn fact, taking into account neutrino scattering via secret interactions, we\nderive our own mass bound on sterile neutrinos and find (at 95% CL) $m_s <\n0.82$ eV or $m_s < 0.29$ eV from Planck alone or in combination with BAO,\nrespectively. These limits confirm the discrepancy with the laboratory\nanomalies. Moreover, we constrain, in the limit of contact interaction, the\neffective strength $G_X$ to be $ < 2.8 (2.0) \\times 10^{10}\\,G_F$ from Planck\n(Planck+BAO). This result, together with the mass bound, strongly disfavours\nthe region with $M_X \\sim 0.1$ MeV and relatively large coupling $g_X\\sim\n10^{-1}$, previously indicated as a possible solution to the small scale dark\nmatter problem.\n", "  The goal of nuSTORM is to provide well-defined neutrino beams for precise\nmeasurements of neutrino cross-sections and oscillations. The nuSTORM decay\nring is a compact racetrack storage ring with a circumference of ~480 m that\nincorporates large aperture (60 cm diameter) magnets. There are many challenges\nin the design. In order to incorporate the Orbit Combination Section (OCS),\nused for injecting the pion beam into the ring, a dispersion suppressor is\nneeded adjacent to the OCS. Concurrently, in order to maximize the number of\nuseful muon decays, strong bending dipoles are needed in the arcs to minimize\nthe arc length. These dipoles create strong chromatic effects, which need to be\ncorrected by nonlinear sextupole elements in the ring. In this paper, a FODO\nracetrack ring design and its optimization using sextupolar fields via both a\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) and a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm will be\ndiscussed.\n", "  We conjecture that every three dimensional canonical singularity defines a\nfive dimensional N=1 SCFT. Flavor symmetry can be found from singularity\nstructure: non-abelian flavor symmetry is read from the singularity type over\none dimensional singular locus. The dimension of Coulomb branch is given by the\nnumber of compact crepant divisors from a crepant resolution of singularity.\nThe detailed structure of Coulomb branch is described as follows: a): A chamber\nof Coulomb branch is described by a crepant resolution, and this chamber is\ngiven by its Nef cone and the prepotential is computed from triple intersection\nnumbers; b): Crepant resolution is not unique and different resolutions are\nrelated by flops; Nef cones from crepant resolutions form a fan which is\nclaimed to be the full Coulomb branch.\n", "  Low-dissipation model and the endoreversible model of heat engines are two of\nthe most commonly studied models of machines in finite-time thermodynamics. In\nthis paper, we compare the performance characteristics of these two models\nunder optimal power output. We point out a basic equivalence between them, in\nthe linear response regime.\n", "  We present a new model for soft interactions in the Monte Carlo\nevent-generator Herwig. The soft diffractive final states are modeled on the\nbasis of the cluster hadronization model and interactions between soft\nparticles are modeled as multiple particle production with multiperipheral\nkinematics. We further present much improved results of mininum-bias\nmeasurements at different energies.\n", "  We study the single jet inclusive cross section up to next-to-next-to leading\norder in perturbative QCD, implemented in the parton-level event generator\nNNLOJET . Our results are fully differential in the jet transverse momentum and\nrapidity and we apply fiducial cuts for comparison with the available ATLAS 7\nTeV 4.5 fb$^{-1}$ data for jet radius $R=0.4$. For the theoretical calculation\nwe employ the antenna subtraction method to reliably cancel all infrared\ndivergences present at intermediate stages of the calculation. We present all\nresults using the individual jet transverse momentum $\\mu_{R}=\\mu_{F}\\sim\np_{T}$ as the renormalization and factorization scale for each jet's\ncontribution to the single jet inclusive cross section. Finally, we consider\nthe differences between our predictions using this scale choice to those for\nthe leading jet transverse momentum scale choice, $\\mu_{R}=\\mu_{F}\\sim\np_{T_{1}}$, used in [14], with reference to the ATLAS data.\n", "  We continue a comprehensive numerical study of semilocal string networks and\ntheir cosmological evolution. These can be thought of as hybrid networks\ncomprised of (non-topological) string segments, whose core structure is similar\nto that of Abelian Higgs vortices, and whose ends have long--range interactions\nand behaviour similar to that of global monopoles. Our study provides further\nevidence of a linear scaling regime, already reported in previous studies, for\nthe typical length scale and velocity of the network. We introduce a new\nalgorithm to identify the position of the segment cores. This allows us to\ndetermine the length and velocity of each individual segment and follow their\nevolution in time. We study the statistical distribution of segment lengths and\nvelocities for radiation- and matter-dominated evolution in the regime where\nthe strings are stable. Our segment detection algorithm gives higher length\nvalues than previous studies based on indirect detection methods. The\nstatistical distribution shows no evidence of (anti)correlation between the\nspeed and the length of the segments.\n", "  We find general deformations of BTZ spacetime and identify the corresponding\nthermofield initial states of the dual CFT. We deform the geometry by\nintroducing bulk fields dual to primary operators and find the back-reacted\ngravity solutions to the quadratic order of the deformation parameter. The dual\nthermofield initial states can be deformed by inserting arbitrary linear\ncombination of operators at the mid-point of the Euclidean time evolution that\nappears in the construction of the thermofield initial states. The deformed\ngeometries are dual to thermofield states without deforming the boundary\nHamiltonians in the CFT side. We explicitly demonstrate that the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence is not a linear correspondence in the sense that the linear\nstructure of Hilbert space of the underlying CFT is realized nonlinearly in the\ngravity side. We also find that their Penrose diagrams are no longer a square\nbut elongated horizontally due to deformation. These geometries describe a\nrelaxation of generic initial perturbation of thermal system while fixing the\ntotal energy of the system. The coarse-grained entropy grows and the relaxation\ntime scale is of order $\\beta/2\\pi$. We clarify that the gravity description\ninvolves coarse-graining inevitably missing some information of nonperurbative\ndegrees.\n", "  Thermal corrections in classically conformal models typically induce a strong\nfirst-order electroweak phase transition, thereby resulting in a stochastic\ngravitational wave background that could be detectable at gravitational wave\nobservatories. After reviewing the basics of classically conformal scenarios,\nin this paper we investigate the phase transition dynamics in a thermal\nenvironment and the related gravitational wave phenomenology within the\nframework of scalar conformal extensions of the Standard Model. We find that\nminimal extensions involving only one additional scalar field struggle to\nreproduce the correct phase transition dynamics once thermal corrections are\naccounted for. Next-to-minimal models, instead, yield the desired electroweak\nsymmetry breaking and typically result in a very strong gravitational wave\nsignal.\n", "  We examine the kinematic morphology of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in eight\ngalaxy clusters in the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph\n(SAMI) Galaxy Survey. The clusters cover a mass range of\n14.2<log(M_200/M_odot)<15.2 and we measure spatially-resolved stellar\nkinematics for 315 member galaxies with stellar masses\n10.0<log(M_*/M_odot)<11.7 within 1R_200 of the cluster centers. We calculate\nthe spin parameter, lambda_R and use that to classify the kinematic morphology\nof the galaxies as fast or slow rotators. The total fraction of slow rotators\nin the early-type galaxy population, F_SR=0.14+/-0.02 and does not depend on\nhost cluster mass. Across the eight clusters, the fraction of slow rotators\nincreases with increasing local overdensity. We also find that the slow-rotator\nfraction increases at small clustercentric radii (R_cl<0.3R_200), and note that\nthere is also an increase in slow-rotator fraction at R_cl~0.6R_200. The slow\nrotators at these larger radii reside in cluster substructure. We find the\nstrongest increase in slow-rotator fraction occurs with increasing stellar\nmass. After accounting for the strong correlation with stellar mass, we find no\nsignificant relationship between spin parameter and local overdensity in the\ncluster environment. We conclude that the primary driver for the kinematic\nmorphology--density relationship in galaxy clusters is the changing\ndistribution of galaxy stellar mass with local environment. The presence of\nslow rotators in substructure suggests that the cluster kinematic\nmorphology--density relationship is a result of mass segregation of\nslow-rotating galaxies forming in groups that later merge with clusters and\nsink to the cluster center via dynamical friction.\n", "  When a rigid body collides with a liquid surface with sufficient velocity, it\ncreates a splash curtain above the surface and entrains air behind the sphere,\ncreating a cavity below the surface. While cavity dynamics have been studied\nfor over a century, this work focuses on the water entry characteristics of\ndeformable elastomeric spheres, which has not been studied. Upon free surface\nimpact, elastomeric sphere deform significantly, resulting in large-scale\nmaterial oscillations within the sphere, resulting in unique nested cavities.\nWe study these phenomena experimentally with high speed imaging and image\nprocessing techniques. The water entry behavior of deformable spheres differs\nfrom rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as\nwell as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this\ndeformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact\nconditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an\neffective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for\ntime to cavity pinch-off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres.\nOur results also show that velocity change over the first oscillation period\nscales with a dimensionless ratio of material shear modulus to impact\nhydrodynamic pressure. Therefore we are able to describe the water entry\ncharacteristics of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and\nimpact conditions.\n", "  The collective decay of excitons from initial Bose-Einstein condensate state\nis investigated theoretically. As practically more interesting case we consider\nexcitons of the yellow series in the semiconductor cuprous oxide where we have\ncollective photon and phonon assisted decay of excitons. It is shown that\nbecause of intrinsic instability of recoilless two-boson decay of Bose-Einstein\ncondensate, the spontaneously emitted bosonic pairs are amplified leading to an\nexponential buildup of a macroscopic population into the certain modes. The\ncollective decay rate has a nonlinear dependence on the excitonic density being\ncomparable or larger than Auger recombination loss rate up to the high\ndensities, which makes obtainable its observation. The considering phenomenon\ncan also be applied for the realization of phonon laser.\n", "  We study irreversible processes for nonlinear oscillators networks described\nby complex-valued Langevin equations that account for coupling to different\nthermo-chemical baths. Dissipation is introduced via non-Hermitian terms in the\nHamiltonian of the model. We apply the stochastic thermodynamics formalism to\ncompute explicit expressions for the entropy production rates. We discuss in\nparticular the non-equilibrium steady states of the network characterised by a\nconstant production rate of entropy and flows of energy and particle currents.\nFor two specific examples, a one-dimensional chain and a dimer, numerical\ncalculations are presented. The role of asymmetric coupling among the\noscillators on the entropy production is illustrated.\n", "  We investigate the structure of the three-qubit magic Veldkamp line (MVL).\nThis mathematical notion has recently shown up as a tool for understanding the\nstructures of the set of Mermin pentagrams, objects that are used to rule out\ncertain classes of hidden variable theories. Here we show that this object also\nprovides a unifying finite geometric underpinning for understanding the\nstructure of functionals used in form theories of gravity and black hole\nentropy. We clarify the representation theoretic, finite geometric and physical\nmeaning of the different parts of our MVL. The upshot of our considerations is\nthat the basic finite geometric objects enabling such a diversity of physical\napplications of the MVL are the unique generalized quadrangles with lines of\nsize three, their one point extensions as well as their other extensions\nisomorphic to affine polar spaces of rank three and order two. In a previous\nwork we have already connected generalized quadrangles to the structure of\ncubic Jordan algebras related to entropy fomulas of black holes and strings in\nfive dimensions. In some respect the present paper can be regarded as a\ngeneralization of that analysis for also providing a finite geometric\nunderstanding of four-dimensional black hole entropy formulas. However, we find\nmany more structures whose physical meaning is yet to be explored. As a\nfamiliar special case our work provides a finite geometric representation of\nthe algebraic extension from cubic Jordan algebras to Freudenthal systems based\non such algebras.\n", "  The planar non-relativistic quantum dynamics of a neutral massive fermion\nwith an anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) in the presence of the electric field\nof infinitely long and thin thread with a charge density distributed uniformly\nalong it (an Aharonov--Casher field) is examined. The relevant Hamiltonian is\nsingular and requires additional specification of a one-parameter self-adjoint\nextension, which can be given in terms of physically acceptable (self-adjoint)\nboundary conditions. We find all possible self-adjoint Hamiltonians with an\nAharonov--Casher field (ACF) by constructing the corresponding Hilbert space of\nsquare-integrable functions, including the $r = 0$ region, for all their\nHamiltoniahs. We determine the most relevant physical quantities, such as\nenergy spectrum and wave functions and discuss their correspondence with those\nobtained by the physical regularization procedure. We show that energy levels\nof bound states are simple poles of the scattering amplitude. Expressions for\nthe scattering amplitude and cross section depending on the fermion spin are\nreexamined.\n", "  In the consistent histories (CH) approach to quantum theory probabilities are\nassigned to histories subject to a consistency condition of negligible\ninterference. The approach has the feature that a given physical situation\nadmits multiple sets of consistent histories that cannot in general be united\ninto a single consistent set, leading to a number of counter-intuitive or\ncontrary properties if propositions from different consistent sets are combined\nindiscriminately. An alternative viewpoint is proposed in which multiple\nconsistent sets are classified according to whether or not there exists any\nunifying probability for combinations of incompatible sets which replicates the\nconsistent histories result when restricted to a single consistent set. A\nnumber of examples are exhibited in which this classification can be made, in\nsome cases with the assistance of the Bell, CHSH or Leggett-Garg inequalities\ntogether with Fine's theorem. When a unifying probability exists logical\ndeductions in different consistent sets can in fact be combined, an extension\nof the \"single framework rule\". It is argued that this classification coincides\nwith intuitive notions of the boundary between classical and quantum regimes\nand in particular, the absence of a unifying probability for certain\ncombinations of consistent sets is regarded as a measure of the \"quantumness\"\nof the system. The proposed approach and results are closely related to recent\nwork on the classification of quasi-probabilities and this connection is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Laser cooling of relativistic heavy ion beams of Li-like C$^{3+}$ and\nO$^{4+}$ is being in preparation at the experimental Cooler Storage Ring\n(CSRe). Recently, a preparatory experiment to test important prerequisites for\nlaser cooling of relativistic $^{12}$C$^{3+}$ ion beams using a pulsed laser\nsystem has been performed at the CSRe. Unfortunately, the interaction between\nthe ions and the pulsed laser cannot be detected. In order to study the laser\ncooling process and find the optimized parameters for future laser cooling\nexperiment, a multi-particle tracking method was developed to simulate the\ndetailed longitudinal dynamics of laser-cooled ion beams at the CSRe. The\nsimulations of laser cooling of the $^{12}$C$^{3+}$ ion beams by scanning the\nfrequency of RF-buncher or continuous wave (CW) laser wavelength were\nperformed. The simulation results indicated that a large momentum spread ion\nbeams could be laser-cooled by the combination of only one CW laser and the\nRF-buncher and shown the requirements of a successful laser cooling experiment.\nThe optimized parameters for scanning the RF-buncher frequency or laser\nfrequency were obtained. Furthermore, the heating effects were estimated for\nlaser cooling at the CSRe. The Schottky noise spectra of longitudinally\nmodulated and laser-cooled ion beams was simulated to fully explain and\nanticipate the experimental results. The combination of Schottky spectra from\nthe highly sensitive resonant Schottky pick-up and the simulation methods\ndeveloped in this paper will be helpful to investigate the longitudinal\ndynamics of RF-bunched and ultra-cold ion beams in the upcoming laser cooling\nexperiments at the CSRe.\n", "  The contribution of one loop milli-charged fermion vacuum polarization in\ncosmic magnetic field to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization is\nconsidered. Exact and perturbative solution of the density matrix equations of\nmotion in terms of the Stokes parameters are presented. For linearly polarized\nCMB at decoupling time, it is shown that propagation of CMB photons in cosmic\nmagnetic field would generate elliptic polarization (circular and linear) of\nthe CMB due to milli-charged fermion vacuum polarization. Analytic expressions\nfor the degree of circular polarization and rotation angle of polarization\nplane of the CMB are presented. Depending on the ratio of milli-charged fermion\nrelative charge to mass, $\\epsilon/m_\\epsilon$, and CMB observation frequency,\nit is shown that the acquired CMB degree of circular polarization could be of\nthe order of magnitude $P_C(T_0)\\sim 10^{-10}- 10^{-6}$ in the best scenario.\nThe effect studied generates CMB polarization even in the case when the CMB is\ninitially in thermal equilibrium. Limits on the magnetic field amplitude due to\nprior decoupling CMB polarization are presented.\n", "  The beta decays of $^{86}$Br and $^{91}$Rb have been studied using the total\nabsorption spectroscopy technique. The radioactive nuclei were produced at the\nIGISOL facility in Jyv\\\"askyl\\\"a and further purified using the JYFLTRAP.\n$^{86}$Br and $^{91}$Rb are considered to be major contributors to the decay\nheat in reactors. In addition $^{91}$Rb was used as a normalization point in\ndirect measurements of mean gamma energies released in the beta decay of\nfission products by Rudstam {\\it et al.} assuming that this decay was well\nknown from high-resolution measurements. Our results show that both decays were\nsuffering from the {\\it Pandemonium} effect and that the results of Rudstam\n{\\it et al.} should be renormalized. The relative impact of the studied decays\nin the prediction of the decay heat and antineutrino spectrum from reactors has\nbeen evaluated.\n", "  Motivated by a local $3.2-3.4$ sigma resonance in $WH$ and $ZH$ in the ATLAS\nRun 2 data, we attempt to interpret the excess in terms of a $W'$ boson in a\n$SU(2)_1 \\times SU(2)_2 \\times U(1)_X$ model. We stretch the deviation from the\nalignment limit of the Equivalence Theorem, so as to maximize $WH$ production\nwhile keeping the $WZ$ production rate below the experimental limit. We found a\nviable though small region of parameter space that satisfies all existing\nconstraints on $W' \\to jj, t \\bar b, WZ$, as well as the precision Higgs data.\nThe cross section of $W' \\to WH$ that we obtain is about $5-6$ fb.\n", "  We propose a generalized Langevin formalism to describe transport in combs\nand similar ramified structures. Our approach consists of a Langevin equation\nwithout drift for the motion along the backbone. The motion along the secondary\nbranches may be described either by a Langevin equation or by other types of\nrandom processes. The mean square displacement (MSD) along the backbone\ncharacterizes the transport through the ramified structure. We derive a general\nanalytical expression for this observable in terms of the probability\ndistribution function of the motion along the secondary branches. We apply our\nresult to various types of motion along the secondary branches of finite or\ninfinite length, such as subdiffusion, superdiffusion, and Langevin dynamics\nwith colored Gaussian noise and with non-Gaussian white noise. Monte Carlo\nsimulations show excellent agreement with the analytical results. The MSD for\nthe case of Gaussian noise is shown to be independent of the noise color. We\nconclude by generalizing our analytical expression for the MSD to the case\nwhere each secondary branch is $n$ dimensional.\n", "  We present quantum-mechanical theory of impact ionization in semiconductors\nwith the direct band gap in \\$\\Gamma\\$-point. It is shown that energy\ndependence of the impact ionization rate \\$\\mathcal{W}(E)\\$ near a threshold\n\\$E_{th}\\$ is given by superposition of the two terms, one of which is strongly\nanisotropic and quadratic in \\$E-E_{th}\\$, while another one is isotropic and\ncubic in \\$E-E_{th}\\$. Explicit form of the coefficients in such representation\nis derived in the framework of the 14-band \\${\\bf k\\cdot p}\\$ model, and we\nclaim the room temperature domination of the cubic contribution for most of the\ndirect-gap materials with \\$E_g\\$ up to 1.5 eV.\n", "  During the last several years remarkable progress has been made in numerical\ncalculations of dimensionally regulated multi-loop Feynman diagrams using\nMellin-Barnes (MB) representations. The bottlenecks were non-planar diagrams\nand Minkowskian kinematics. The method has been proved to work in highly\nnon-trivial physical application (two-loop electroweak bosonic corrections to\nthe $Z \\to b \\bar{{b}}$ decay), and cross-checked with the sector decomposition\n(SD) approach. In fact, both approaches have their pros and cons. In\ncalculation of multidimensional integrals, depending on masses and scales\ninvolved, they are complementary. A powerful top-bottom approach to the\nnumerical integration of multidimensional MB integrals is automatized in the\nMB-suite AMBRE/MB/ MBtools/MBnumerics/CUBA. Key elements are a dedicated use of\nthe Cheng-Wu theorem for non-planar topologies and of shifts and deformations\nof the integration contours. An alternative bottom-up approach starting with\ncomplex 1-dimensional MB-integrals, based on the exploration of steepest\ndescent integration contours in Minkowskian kinematics, is also discussed.\nShort and long term prospects of the MB-method for multi-loop applications to\nLHC- and LC-physics are discussed.\n", "  If no new physics signals are found, in the coming years, at the Large Hadron\nCollider Run-2, an increase in precision of the Higgs couplings measurements\nwill shift the dicussion to the effects of higher order corrections. In Beyond\nthe Standard Model (BSM) theories this may become the only tool to probe new\nphysics. Extensions of the Standard Model (SM) with several scalar singlets may\naddress several of its problems, namely to explain dark matter, the\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry, or to improve the stability of the SM up to the\nPlanck scale. In this work we propose a general framework to calculate one\nloop-corrections in BSM models with an arbitrary number of scalar singlets. We\nthen apply our method to a real and to a complex scalar singlet models. We\nassess the importance of the one-loop radiative corrections first by computing\nthem for a tree level mixing sum constraint, and then for the main Higgs\nproduction process $gg \\to H$. We conclude that, for the currently allowed\nparameter space of these models, the corrections can be at most a few percent.\nNotably, a non-zero correction can survive when dark matter is present, in the\nSM-like limit of the Higgs couplings to other SM particles.\n", "  Circuit theory has been tremendously successful in translating physical\nequations into circuit elements in organized form for further analysis and\nproposing creative designs for applications. With the advent of new materials\nand phenomena in the field of spintronics and nanomagnetics, it is imperative\nto construct the spin circuit representations for different materials and\nphenomena. Spin pumping is a phenomenon by which a pure spin current can be\ninjected into the adjacent layers. If the adjacent layer is a material with a\nhigh spin orbit coupling, a considerable amount of charge voltage can be\ngenerated via inverse spin Hall effect, allowing spin detection. Here we\ndevelop the spin circuit representation of spin pumping. We then combine it\nwith the spin circuit representation for the materials having spin Hall effect\nto show that it reproduces the standard results in literature. We further show\nhow complex multilayers can be analyzed by simply writing a netlist.\n", "  When dense granular systems are exposed to external forcing, they evolve on\nthe time scale that is typically related to the externally imposed one (shear\nor compression rate, for example). This evolution could be characterized by\nobserving temporal evolution of contact networks. However, it is not\nimmediately clear whether the force networks, defined on contact networks by\nconsidering force interactions between the particles, evolve on a similar time\nscale. To analyze the evolution of these networks, we carry out discrete\nelement simulations of a system of soft frictional disks exposed to compression\nthat leads to jamming. By using the tools of computational topology, we show\nthat close to jamming transition, the force networks evolve on the time scale\nwhich is much faster than the externally imposed one. The presentation will\ndiscuss the factors that determine this fast time scale.\n", "  Scalar-tensor theories of gravity generally violate the strong equivalence\nprinciple, namely compact objects have a suppressed coupling to the scalar\nforce, causing them to fall slower. A black hole is the extreme example where\nsuch a coupling vanishes, i.e. black hole has no scalar hair. Following earlier\nwork, we explore observational scenarios for detecting strong equivalence\nprinciple violation, focusing on galileon gravity as an example. For galaxies\nin-falling towards galaxy clusters, the supermassive black hole can be offset\nfrom the galaxy center away from the direction of the cluster. Hence, well\nresolved images of galaxies around nearby clusters can be used to identify the\ndisplaced black hole via the star cluster bound to it. We show that this signal\nis accessible with imaging surveys, both ongoing ones such as the Dark Energy\nSurvey, and future ground and space based surveys. Already, the observation of\nthe central black hole in M~87 places new constraints on the galileon\nparameters, which we present here. $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ matter couplings are\ndisfavored for a large region of the parameter space. We also find a novel\nphenomenon whereby the black hole can escape the galaxy completely in less than\none billion years.\n", "  We compute photon production at early times in semi-central relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions from non-equilibrium gluon fusion induced by a magnetic\nfield. The calculation accounts for the main features of the collision at these\nearly times, namely, the intense magnetic field and the high gluon occupation\nnumber. The gluon fusion channel is made possible by the magnetic field and\nwould otherwise be forbidden due to charge conjugation invariance. Thus, the\nphoton yield from this process is an excess over calculations without magnetic\nfield effects. We compare this excess to the difference between PHENIX data and\nrecent hydrodynamic calculations for the photon transverse momentum\ndistribution and elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$. We show that with reasonable\nvalues for the saturation scale and magnetic field strength, the calculation\nhelps to better describe the experimental results obtained at RHIC energies for\nthe lowest part of the transverse photon momentum.\n", "  The characters of parafermionic conformal field theories are given by the\nstring functions of affine algebras, which are either twisted or untwisted\nalgebras. Expressions for these characters as generalized Rogers Ramanujan\nalgebras have been established for the untwisted affine algebras. However, we\nstudy the identities for the string functions of twisted affine Lie algebras.\nConjectures for the string functions was proposed by Hatayama et al., for the\nunit fields, which expresses the string functions as Rogers Ramanujan type\nsums. Here we propose to check the Hatayama et al. conjecture, using Lie\nalgebraic theoretic methods. We use Freudenthal's formula, which we\ncomputerized, to verify the identities for all the algebras at low rank and low\nlevel. We find complete agreement with the conjecture.\n", "  We review numerical studies of quantum turbulence. Quantum turbulence is\ncurrently one of the most important problems in low temperature physics and is\nactively studied for superfluid helium and atomic Bose--Einstein condensates. A\nkey aspect of quantum turbulence is the dynamics of condensates and quantized\nvortices. The dynamics of quantized vortices in superfluid helium are described\nby the vortex filament model, while the dynamics of condensates are described\nby the Gross--Pitaevskii model. Both of these models are nonlinear, and the\nquantum turbulent states of interest are far from equilibrium. Hence, numerical\nstudies have been indispensable for studying quantum turbulence. In fact,\nnumerical studies have contributed in revealing the various problems of quantum\nturbulence. This article reviews the recent developments in numerical studies\nof quantum turbulence. We start with the motivation and the basics of quantum\nturbulence and invite readers to the frontier of this research. Though there\nare many important topics in the quantum turbulence of superfluid helium, this\narticle focuses on inhomogeneous quantum turbulence in a channel, which has\nbeen motivated by recent visualization experiments. Atomic Bose--Einstein\ncondensates are a modern issue in quantum turbulence, and this article reviews\na variety of topics in the quantum turbulence of condensates e.g.\ntwo-dimensional quantum turbulence, weak wave turbulence, turbulence in a\nspinor condensate, $etc.$, some of which has not been addressed in superfluid\nhelium and paves the novel way for quantum turbulence researches. Finally we\ndiscuss open problems.\n", "  We study the abundances of Na, Mg, and K in the atmospheres of 32 RGB stars\nin the Galactic globular cluster (GGC) 47 Tuc, with the goal to investigate the\npossible existence of Na-K and Mg-K correlations/anti-correlations, similar to\nthose that were recently discovered in two other GGCs, NGC 2419 and 2808. The\nabundances of K, Na, and Mg were determined using high-resolution 2df spectra\nobtained with the AAT. The 1D NLTE abundance estimates were obtained using 1D\nhydrostatic ATLAS9 model atmospheres and spectral line profiles synthesized\nwith the MULTI package. We also used 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD and 1D\nhydrostatic LHD model atmospheres to compute 3D-1D LTE abundance corrections,\n$\\Delta_{\\rm 3D-1D~LTE}$, for the spectral lines of Na, Mg, and K used in our\nstudy. These abundance corrections were used to understand the role of\nconvection in the formation of spectral lines, as well as to estimate the\ndifferences in the abundances obtained with the 3D hydrodynamical and 1D\nhydrostatic model atmospheres. The average element-to-iron abundance ratios and\ntheir RMS variations due to star-to-star abundance spreads determined in our\nsample of RGB stars were $\\langle{\\rm [Na/Fe]}\\rangle^{\\rm\n1D~NLTE}=0.42\\pm0.13$, $\\langle{\\rm [Mg/Fe]}\\rangle^{\\rm 1D~NLTE}=0.41\\pm0.11$,\nand $\\langle{\\rm [K/Fe]}\\rangle^{\\rm 1D~NLTE}=0.05\\pm0.14$. We found no\nstatistically significant relations between the abundances of the three\nelements studied here. Also, there were no abundance trends with the distance\nfrom the cluster center, nor any statistically significant relations between\nthe abundance/abundance ratios and absolute radial velocities of individual\nstars. All these facts suggest the similarity of K abundance in stars that\nbelong to different generations in 47 Tuc which, in turn, may hint that\nevolution of K in this particular cluster was unrelated to the nucleosynthesis\nof Na and/or Mg.\n", "  In this letter, we report a method of symmetry-breaking in an artificial\nMie-based metamolecule. A Fano resonance with a Q factor of 96 is observed at\nmicrowave frequencies in a structure combining a split ring resonator (SRR) and\na high-permittivity dielectric cube. Calculations indicate resonant frequency\ntunability will result from altering the cube's permittivity. The asymmetric\nspectrum is attributed to both constructive and destructive near-field\ninteractions between the two distinct resonators. Experimental data and\nsimulation results are in good agreement. The underlying physics is seen in\nfield distribution and dipole analysis. This work substantiates an approach for\nthe manipulation of Mie resonances which can potentially be utilized in light\nmodulating and sensing.\n", "  We systematically analyzed magnetodielectric resonances of Se colloids for\nthe first time to exploit the possibility for use as building blocks of\nall-dielectric optical metafluids. By taking synergistic advantages of Se\ncolloids, including (i) high-refractive-index at optical frequencies, (ii)\nunprecedented structural uniformity, and (iii) versatile access to copious\nquantities, the Kerker-type directional light scattering resulting from\nefficient coupling between strong electric and magnetic resonances were\nobserved directly from Se colloidal suspension. Thus, the use of Se colloid as\na generic magnetodielectric building block highlights an opportunity for the\nfluidic low-loss optical antenna, which can be processed via spin-coating and\npainting.\n", "  In this talk, I show the automated Monte Carlo simulations at next-to-leading\norder in QCD as well as its matching to parton showers are already feasible\nwithin the framework of \\MG5aMC. I briefly overview the recent activities and\ntake the colored particle production at the LHC as examples. The tools and the\nmodels are ready for using by both phenomenologists and experimentalists.\n", "  Recent experiments on spin torque oscillators have revealed interactions\nbetween multiple magnetodynamic modes, including mode-coexistence,\nmode-hopping, and temperature-driven cross-over between modes. Initial\nmultimode theory has indicated that a linear coupling between several dominant\nmodes, arising from the interaction of the subdynamic system with a magnon\nbath, plays an essential role in the generation of various multimode behaviors,\nsuch as mode hopping and mode coexistence. In this work, we derive a set of\nrate equations to describe the dynamics of coupled magnetodynamic modes in a\nnano-contact spin torque oscillator. Expressions for both linear and nonlinear\ncoupling terms are obtained, which allow us to analyze the dependence of the\ncoupled dynamic behaviors of modes on external experimental conditions as well\nas intrinsic magnetic properties. For a minimal two-mode system, we further map\nthe energy and phase difference of the two modes onto a two-dimensional phase\nspace, and demonstrate in the phase portraits, how the manifolds of periodic\norbits and fixed points vary with external magnetic field as well as with\ntemperature.\n", "  This note proposes a simple and general framework of dynamic mode\ndecomposition (DMD) and a mode selection for large datasets. The proposed\nframework explicitly introduces a preconditioning step using an incremental\nproper orthogonal decomposition to DMD and mode selection algorithms. By\nperforming the preconditioning step, the DMD and the mode selection can be\nperformed with low memory consumption and small computational complexity and\ncan be applied to large datasets. In addition, a simple mode selection\nalgorithm based on a greedy method is proposed. The proposed framework is\napplied to the analysis of a three-dimensional flows around a circular\ncylinder.\n", "  A phenomenological study of the final combined HERA data on inclusive deep\ninelastic scattering (DIS) has been performed. The data are presented and\ninvestigated for a kinematic range extending from values of the four-momentum\ntransfer, $Q^2$, above 10$^4$ GeV$^2$ down to the lowest values observable at\nHERA of $Q^2$ = 0.045 GeV$^2$ and Bjorken $x$, $x_{\\rm Bj}$ = 6 $\\cdot$\n10$^{-7}$. The data are well described by fits based on perturbative quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) using collinear factorisation and evolution of the parton\ndensities encompassed in the DGLAP formalism from the highest $Q^2$ down to\n$Q^2$ of a few GeV$^2$. The Regge formalism can describe the data up to $Q^2\n\\approx$ 0.65 GeV$^2$. The complete data set can be described by a new fit\nusing the ALLM parameterisation. The region between the Regge and the\nperturbative QCD regimes is of particular interest.\n", "  We study ${\\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories with gauge group\n$U_{k_1}(1)\\times U_{k_2}(1)$. We find that, when $k_1+k_2=0$, the partition\nfunction computed by localization dramatically simplifies and collapses to a\nsingle term. We show that the same condition prevents the theory from having\nsupersymmetric vortex configurations. The theories include mass-deformed ABJM\ntheory with $U(1)_{k}\\times U_{-k}(1)$ gauge group as a particular case.\nSimilar features are shared by a class of CS-matter theories with gauge group\n$U_{k_1}(1)\\times \\cdots \\times U_{k_N}(1)$.\n", "  It is argued that the hollowness effect (depletion in the absorptive part of\nthe scattering cross section at small values of the impact parameter) in the\nproton-proton scattering at the the LHC energies finds its origin in the\nquantum nature of the process, resulting in large values of the real part of\nthe eikonal phase. The effect cannot be reconciled with an incoherent\nsuperposition of the absorption from the proton constituents, thus suggests the\nchange of this basic paradigm of high-energy scattering.\n", "  We present an approach which allows the consistent treatment of bound states\nin the context of the dc conductivity in dense partially ionized noble gas\nplasmas. Besides electron-ion and electron-electron collisions, further\ncollision mechanisms owing to neutral constituents are taken into account.\nEspecially at low temperatures $T\\approx 1 {\\rm eV}$, electron-atom collisions\ngive a substantial contribution to the relevant correlation functions. We\nsuggest an optical potential for the description of the electron-atom\nscattering which is applicable for all noble gases. The electron-atom\nmomentum-transfer cross section is in agreement with experimental scattering\ndata. In addition the influence of the medium is analysed, the optical\npotential is advanced including screening effects. The position of the Ramsauer\nminimum is influenced by the plasma. Alternative approaches for the\nelectron-atom potential are discussed. Calculations of the electrical\nconductivity are compared with experimental data.\n", "  An addition to the Standard Model of a real, gauge-singlet scalar field,\ncoupled via a Higgs portal interaction, can reopen the possibility of a\nstrongly first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) and successful\nelectroweak baryogenesis (EWBG). If a discrete symmetry that forbids\ndoublet-singlet mixing is present, this model is notoriously difficult to test\nat the Large Hadron Collider. As a result, it emerged as a useful benchmark for\nevaluating the capabilities of proposed future colliders to conclusively test\nEWPT and EWBG. In this paper, we evaluate the bubble nucleation temperature\nthroughout the parameter space of this model where a first-order transition is\nexpected. We find that in large parts of this parameter space, bubbles in fact\ndo not nucleate at any finite temperature, eliminating these models as viable\nEWBG scenarios. This constraint eliminates most of the region where a\n\"two-step\" phase transition is naively predicted, while the \"one-step\"\ntransition region is largely unaffected. In addition, expanding bubble walls\nmust not reach relativistic speeds during the transition for baryon asymmetry\nto be generated. We show that this condition further reduces the parameter\nspace with viable EWBG.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate four-wave-mixing spectroscopy using frequency\ncombs. The experiment uses a geometry where excitation pulses and\nfour-wave-mixing signals generated by a sample co-propagate. We separate them\nin the radio frequency domain by heterodyne detection with a local oscillator\ncomb that has a different repetition frequency.\n", "  We use a variant of the $D4$-$D8$ construction that includes two chiral and\none heavy meson, to describe heavy-light baryons and their exotics as heavy\nmesons bound to a flavor instanton in bulk. At strong coupling, the heavy meson\nis shown to {\\it always bind} in the form of a flavor instanton zero mode in\nthe fundamental representation. The ensuing instanton moduli for the heavy\nbaryons exhibits both chiral and heavy quark symmetry. We detail how to\nquantize it, and derive model independent mass relations for heavy bayons with\na single-heavy quark in leading order, in overall agreement with the reported\nbaryonic spectra with one charm or bottom. We also discuss the low-lying masses\nand quantum assignments for the even and odd parity states, some of which are\nyet to be observed. We extend our analysis to double-heavy pentaquarks with\nhidden charm and bottom. In leading order, we find a pair of doube-heavy\niso-doublets with $IJ^\\pi=\\frac 12 {\\frac 12}^-, \\frac 12 {\\frac 32}^-$\nassignments for all heavy flavor combinations. We also find five new Delta-like\npentaquark states with $IJ^\\pi=\\frac 32 {\\frac 12}^-, \\frac 32 {\\frac 32}^-,\n\\frac 32 {\\frac 52}^-$ assignments for both charm and bottom.\n", "  It has long been known that no static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically\nflat Klein-Gordon scalar field configuration surrounding a nonrotating black\nhole can exist in general relativity. In a series of previous papers we proved\nthat, at the effective level, this no-hair theorem can be circumvented by\nrelaxing the staticity assumption: for appropriate model parameters there are\nquasi-bound scalar field configurations living on a fixed Schwarzschild\nbackground which, although not being strictly static, have a larger lifetime\nthan the age of the universe. This situation arises when the mass of the scalar\nfield distribution is much smaller than the black hole mass, and following the\nanalogies with the hair in the literature we dubbed these long-lived field\nconfigurations wigs. Here we extend our previous work to include the\ngravitational backreaction produced by the scalar wigs. We derive new\napproximate solutions of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Klein-Gordon system\nwhich represent self-gravitating scalar wigs surrounding black holes. These\nconfigurations interpolate between boson star configurations and Schwarzschild\nblack holes dressed with the long-lived scalar test field distributions\ndiscussed in previous papers. Nonlinear numerical evolutions of initial data\nsets extracted from our approximate solutions support the validity of our\napproach. Arbitrarily large lifetimes are still possible, although for the\nparameter space that we analyze in this paper they seem to decay faster than\nthe quasi-bound states. Finally, we speculate about the possibility that these\nconfigurations could describe the innermost regions of dark matter halos.\n", "  Protected by an approximate shift symmetry, axions are well motivated\ncandidates for driving cosmic inflation. Their generic coupling to the\nChern-Simons term of any gauge theory gives rise to a wide range of potentially\nobservable signatures, including equilateral non-Gaussianites in the CMB,\nchiral gravitational waves in the range of direct gravitational wave detectors\nand primordial black holes (PBHs). In this paper we revisit these predictions\nfor axion inflation models non-minimally coupled to gravity. Contrary to the\ncase of minimally coupled models which typically predict scale-invariant mass\ndistributions for the generated PBHs at small scales, we demonstrate how\nbroadly peaked PBH spectra naturally arises in this setup. For specific\nparameter values, all of dark matter can be accounted for by PBHs.\n", "  The fundamental shear horizontal (SH0) wave in plates is of great importance\nin the field of nondestructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring\n(SHM) since it is the unique non-dispersive guided wave mode. For practical\napplications, a phased array system based on omnidirectional SH0 wave\ntransducers is most useful as it can cover a wide range of a plate. However, so\nfar very few omnidirectional SH wave transducers have been developed. In this\nwork, we proposed an omnidirectional SH piezoelectric transducer (OSH-PT) based\non a thickness poled piezoelectric ring. The ring is equally divided into\ntwelve sectors and the electric field is circumferentially applied, resulting\nin a new thickness-shear (d15) mode. Finite element analysis shows that the\nproposed OSH-PT can excite single-mode SH0 wave and receive the SH0 wave only.\nExperiments were then conducted to examine the performance of the proposed\nOSH-PT. Results indicated that it can generate and receive single-mode SH0 wave\nin a wide frequency range with nearly uniform sensitivities along all\ndirections. Considering its quite simple configuration, compact size and low\ncost, the proposed OSH-PT is expected to greatly promote the applications of SH\nwaves in the field of NDT and SHM.\n", "  We consider optimization of linear stability of synchronized states between a\npair of weakly coupled limit-cycle oscillators with cross coupling, where\ndifferent components of state variables of the oscillators are allowed to\ninteract. On the basis of the phase reduction theory, the coupling matrix\nbetween different components of the oscillator states that maximizes the linear\nstability of the synchronized state under given constraints on overall coupling\nintensity and on stationary phase difference is derived. The improvement in the\nlinear stability is illustrated by using several types of limit-cycle\noscillators as examples.\n", "  Optimization of the stability of synchronized states between a pair of\nsymmetrically coupled reaction-diffusion systems exhibiting rhythmic\nspatiotemporal patterns is studied in the framework of the phase reduction\ntheory. The optimal linear filter that maximizes the linear stability of the\nin-phase synchronized state is derived for the case where the two systems are\nlinearly coupled. The nonlinear optimal interaction function that theoretically\ngives the largest linear stability of the in-phase synchronized state is also\nderived. The theory is illustrated by using typical rhythmic patterns in\nFitzHugh-Nagumo systems as examples.\n", "  We analyze the effects of noncommutativity in conformal quantum mechanics\n(CQM) using the $\\kappa$-deformed space-time as a prototype. Upto the first\norder in the deformation parameter, the symmetry structure of the CQM algebra\nis preserved but the coupling in a canonical model of the CQM gets deformed. We\nshow that the boundary conditions that ensure a unitary time evolution in the\nnoncommutative CQM can break the scale invariance, leading to a quantum\nmechanical scaling anomaly. We calculate the scaling dimensions of the two and\nthree point functions in the noncommutative CQM which are shown to be deformed.\nThe $AdS_2/CFT_1$ duality for the CQM suggests that the corresponding\ncorrelation functions in the holographic duals are modified. In addition, the\nBreitenlohner-Freedman bound also picks up a noncommutative correction. The\nstrongly attractive regime of a canonical model of the CQM exhibit quantum\ninstability. We show that the noncommutativity softens this singular behaviour\nand its implications for the corresponding holographic duals are discussed.\n", "  In this work, we study the universal behaviors in the mutual information of\ntwo disjoint spheres in a conformal field theory(CFT). By using the operator\nproduct expansion of the spherical twist operator in terms of the conformal\nfamily, we show that the large distance expansion of the mutual information can\nbe cast in terms of the conformal blocks. We develop the $1/n$ prescription to\ncompute the coefficients before the conformal blocks. For a single conformal\nfamily, the leading nonvanishing contribution to the mutual information comes\nfrom the bilinear operators. We show that the coefficients of these operators\ntake universal forms and such universal behavior persists in the bilinear\noperators with derivatives as well. Consequently the first few leading order\ncontributions to the mutual information in CFT take universal forms. To\nillustrate our framework, we discuss the free scalars and free fermions in\nvarious dimensions. For the free scalars, we compute the mutual information to\nthe next-to-leading order and find good agreement with the improved numerical\nlattice result. For the free fermion, we compute the leading order result,\nwhich is of universal form, and find the good match with the numerical study.\nOur formalism could be applied to any CFT potentially.\n", "  If one removes any \\emph{ad hoc} symmetry assumptions, the general two Higgs\ndoublet model should have additional Yukawa interactions independent from\nfermion mass generation, in general involving flavor changing neutral Higgs\ncouplings. These extra couplings can affect the discovered Higgs boson $h$\nthrough fermion loop contributions. We calculate the renormalized $hZZ$\ncoupling at one-loop level %by on-shell and minimal subtraction scheme, and\nevaluate the dependence on heavy Higgs boson mass and extra Yukawa coupling\n$\\rho_{tt}$. Precision measurements at future colliders can explore the\nparameter space, and can give stronger bound on $\\rho_{tt}$ than the current\nbound from flavor experiments. As a side result, we find that if\n$\\rho_{tt}\\cos\\gamma < 0$, where $\\cos\\gamma$ is the exotic Higgs component of\n$h$, the $\\rho_{tt}$-induced top loop contribution cancels against bosonic loop\ncontributions, and one may have alignment without decoupling, namely\n$\\sin(-\\gamma) \\simeq 1$, but exotic scalar bosons could have masses at several\nhundred GeV.\n", "  The apparent gas permeability of the porous medium is an important parameter\nin the prediction of unconventional gas production, which was first\ninvestigated systematically by Klinkenberg in 1941 and found to increase with\nthe reciprocal mean gas pressure (or equivalently, the Knudsen number).\nAlthough the underlying rarefaction effects are well-known, the reason that the\ncorrection factor in Klinkenberg's famous equation decreases when the Knudsen\nnumber increases has not been fully understood. Most of the studies idealize\nthe porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according\nto the gas kinetic theory, this only results in an increase of the correction\nfactor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's\nexperimental observations. Here, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation\nin simplified (but not simple) porous media, we identify, for the first time,\ntwo key factors that can explain Klinkenberg's experimental results: the\ntortuous flow path and the non-unitary tangential momentum accommodation\ncoefficient for the gas-surface interaction. Moreover, we find that\nKlinkenberg's results can only be observed when the ratio between the apparent\nand intrinsic permeabilities is $\\lesssim30$; at large ratios (or Knudsen\nnumbers) the correction factor increases with the Knudsen number. Our numerical\nresults could also serve as benchmarking cases to assess the accuracy of\nmacroscopic models and/or numerical schemes for the modeling/simulation of\nrarefied gas flows in complex geometries over a wide range of gas rarefaction.\n", "  Using aluminum-nitride photonic-chip waveguides, we generate\noptical-frequency-comb supercontinuum spanning from 500 nm to 4000 nm with a\n0.8 nJ seed pulse, and show that the spectrum can be tailored by changing the\nwaveguide geometry. Since aluminum nitride exhibits both quadratic and cubic\nnonlinearities, the spectra feature simultaneous contributions from numerous\nnonlinear mechanisms: supercontinuum generation, difference-frequency\ngeneration, second-harmonic generation, and third-harmonic generation. As one\napplication of integrating multiple nonlinear processes, we measure and\nstabilize the carrier-envelope-offset frequency of a laser comb by direct\nphotodetection of the output light. Additionally, we generate ~0.3 mW in the\n3000 nm to 4000 nm region, which is potentially useful for molecular\nspectroscopy. The combination of broadband light generation from the visible\nthrough the mid-infrared, combined with simplified self-referencing, provides a\npath towards robust comb systems for spectroscopy and metrology in the field.\n", "  It has been known that noise can suppress multistability by dynamically\nconnecting coexisting attractors in the system which are otherwise in separate\nbasins of attraction. The purpose of this mini-review is to argue that\nquasiperiodic driving can play a similar role in suppressing multistability. A\nconcrete physical example is provided where quasiperiodic driving was\ndemonstrated to eliminate multistability completely to generate robust chaos in\na semiconductor superlattice system.\n", "  According to the Ideal Walking Technicolor paradigm large mass anomalous\ndimensions arise in gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models when the\nfour-fermion coupling is sufficiently strong to induce spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking in an otherwise conformal gauge theory. We therefore study the $SU(2)$\ngauged NJL model with two adjoint fermions using lattice simulations. The model\nis in an infrared conformal phase at small NJL coupling while it displays a\nchirally broken phase at large NJL couplings. In the infrared conformal phase\nwe find that the mass anomalous dimension varies with the NJL coupling reaching\n$\\gamma_m \\sim 1$ close to the chiral symmetry breaking transition, de facto\nmaking the present model the first explicit realization of the Ideal Walking\nscenario.\n", "  Soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars are thought to be magnetars,\nneutron stars with strong magnetic fields of order $\\mathord{\\sim}\n10^{13}$--$10^{15} \\, \\mathrm{gauss}$. These objects emit intermittent bursts\nof hard X-rays and soft gamma rays. Quasiperiodic oscillations in the X-ray\ntails of giant flares imply the existence of neutron star oscillation modes\nwhich could emit gravitational waves powered by the magnetar's magnetic energy\nreservoir. We describe a method to search for transient gravitational-wave\nsignals associated with magnetar bursts with durations of 10s to 1000s of\nseconds. The sensitivity of this method is estimated by adding simulated\nwaveforms to data from the sixth science run of Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). We find a search sensitivity in terms of\nthe root sum square strain amplitude of $h_{\\mathrm{rss}} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-21}\n\\, \\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ for a half sine-Gaussian waveform with a central\nfrequency $f_0 = 150 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$ and a characteristic time $\\tau = 400 \\,\n\\mathrm{s}$. This corresponds to a gravitational wave energy of\n$E_{\\mathrm{GW}} = 4.3 \\times 10^{46} \\, \\mathrm{erg}$, the same order of\nmagnitude as the 2004 giant flare which had an estimated electromagnetic energy\nof $E_{\\mathrm{EM}} = \\mathord{\\sim} 1.7 \\times 10^{46} (d/ 8.7 \\,\n\\mathrm{kpc})^2 \\, \\mathrm{erg}$, where $d$ is the distance to SGR 1806-20. We\npresent an extrapolation of these results to Advanced LIGO, estimating a\nsensitivity to a gravitational wave energy of $E_{\\mathrm{GW}} = 3.2 \\times\n10^{43} \\, \\mathrm{erg}$ for a magnetar at a distance of $1.6 \\, \\mathrm{kpc}$.\nThese results suggest this search method can probe significantly below the\nenergy budgets for magnetar burst emission mechanisms such as crust cracking\nand hydrodynamic deformation.\n", "  Ultrafast Electron Microscopy (UEM) has been demonstrated to be an effective\ntable-top technique for imaging the temporally-evolving dynamics of matter with\nsubparticle spatial resolution on the time scale of atomic motion. However,\nimaging the faster motion of electron dynamics in real time has remained beyond\nreach. Here, we demonstrate more than an order of magnitude (16 times)\nenhancement in the typical temporal resolution of UEM by generating isolated 30\nfs electron pulses, accelerated at 200 keV, via the optical-gating approach,\nwith sufficient intensity for efficiently probing the electronic dynamics of\nmatter. Moreover, we investigate the feasibility of attosecond optical gating\nto generate isolated subfemtosecond electron pulses, attaining the desired\ntemporal resolution in electron microscopy for establishing the Attomicroscopy\nto allow the imaging of electron motion in the act.\n", "  We seek to accelerate and increase the size of simulations for\nfluid-structure interactions (FSI) by using multiple resolutions in the spatial\ndiscretization of the equations governing the time evolution of systems\ndisplaying two-way fluid-solid coupling. To this end, we propose a\nmulti-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach in which\nsubdomains of different resolutions are directly coupled without any overlap\nregion. The second-order consistent discretization of spatial differential\noperators is employed to ensure the accuracy of the proposed method. As SPH\nparticles advect with the flow, a dynamic SPH particle refinement/coarsening is\nemployed via splitting/merging to maintain a predefined multi-resolution\nconfiguration. Particle regularity is enforced via a particle-shifting\ntechnique to ensure accuracy and stability of the Lagrangian particle-based\nmethod embraced. The convergence, accuracy, and efficiency attributes of the\nnew method are assessed by simulating four different flows. In this process,\nthe numerical results are compared to the analytical, finite element, and\nconsistent SPH single-resolution solutions. We anticipate that the proposed\nmulti-resolution method will enlarge the class of SPH-tractable FSI\napplications.\n", "  TPC is a promising technology for the future electron positron colliders.\nHowever, its application might be limited at high event rate and high hit\noccupancies. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using TPC at the\ncircular electron positron collider (CEPC) at $Z$ pole using full simulated $Z\n\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}$ samples. By evaluating the local charge density and voxel\noccupancy at different TPC parameters. Our study shows that the TPC could be\napplied to the CEPC $Z$ pole operation if back flow ion is controlled to per\nmille level. We also suggest the applicable TPC parameters for FCC-ee $Z$ pole\noperations, whose instant luminosity is $2\\times 10^{36}\n\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}$, 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of CEPC.\n", "  In this paper, from the algebraic reductions from the Lie algebra\n$gl(n,\\mathbb C)$ to its commutative subalgebra $Z_n$, we construct the general\n$Z_n$-Sine-Gordon and $Z_n$-Sinh-Gordon systems which contain many\nmulti-component Sine-Gordon type and Sinh-Gordon type equations. Meanwhile, we\ngive the B\\\"acklund transformations of the $Z_n$-Sine-Gordon and\n$Z_n$-Sinh-Gordon equations which can generate new solutions from seed\nsolutions. To see the $Z_n$-systems clearly, we consider the $Z_2$-Sine-Gordon\nand $Z_3$-Sine-Gordon equations explicitly including their B\\\"acklund\ntransformations, the nonlinear superposition formula and Lax pairs.\n", "  Gauge symmetry enhancing, at specific points of the compactification space,\nis a distinguished feature of string theory. In this work we discuss the\nbreaking of such symmetries with tools provided by Double Field Theory (DFT).\nAs a main guiding example we discuss the bosonic string compactified on a\ncircle where, at the self dual radio the generic $U(1)\\times U(1)$ gauge\nsymmetry becomes enhanced to $SU(2)\\times SU(2)$. We show that the\nenhancing-breaking of the gauge symmetry can be understood through a dependence\nof gauge structure constants (fluxes in DFT) on moduli. This dependence, in DFT\ndescription, is encoded in the generalized tangent frame of the double space.\nActually, the explicit T-duality invariant formulation provided by DFT proves\nto be a helpful ingredient. The link with string theory results is discussed\nand generalizations to generic tori compactifications are addressed.\n", "  Recent experiments have revealed that the diffusivity of exothermic and fast\nenzymes is enhanced when they are catalytically active, and different physical\nmechanisms have been explored and quantified to account for this observation.\nWe perform measurements on the endothermic and relatively slow enzyme aldolase,\nwhich also shows substrate-induced enhanced diffusion. We propose a new\nphysical paradigm, which reveals that the diffusion coefficient of a model\nenzyme hydrodynamically coupled to its environment increases significantly when\nundergoing changes in conformational fluctuations in a substrate-dependent\nmanner, and is independent of the overall turnover rate of the underlying\nenzymatic reaction. Our results show that substrate-induced enhanced diffusion\nof enzyme molecules can be explained within an equilibrium picture, and that\nthe exothermicity of the catalyzed reaction is not a necessary condition for\nthe observation of this phenomenon.\n", "  When the coupling between light and matter becomes comparable to the energy\ngap between different excited states they hybridize, leading to the appearance\nof a rich and complex phenomenology which attracted remarkable interest in\nrecent years. While the mixing between states with different number of\nexcitations, so-called ultrastrong coupling regime, has been observed in\nvarious implementations, the effect of the hybridization between different\nsingle excitation states, referred to as very strong coupling regime, has\nremained elusive. In semiconductor quantum wells such a regime is predicted to\nmanifest as a photon-mediated electron-hole coupling leading to different\nexcitonic wavefunctions for the two polaritonic branches when the ratio of the\ncoupling strength to exciton binding energy approaches unity. Here, we verify\nexperimentally the existence of this regime in magneto-optical measurements on\na microcavity with 28 GaAs quantum wells, showing that the average\nelectron-hole separation of the upper polariton is significantly increased\ncompared to the bare quantum well exciton Bohr radius. This manifests in a\ndiamagnetic shift around zero detuning that exceeds the shift of the lower\npolariton by one order of magnitude and the bare quantum well exciton\ndiamagnetic shift by a factor of two. The lower polariton exhibits a\ndiamagnetic shift smaller than expected from the coupling of a rigid exciton to\nthe cavity mode which suggests more tightly bound electron-hole pairs than in\nthe bare quantum well.\n", "  In this article, we consider the reconstruction of $\\rho(t)$ in the\n(time-fractional) diffusion equation\n$(\\partial_t^\\alpha-\\triangle)u(x,t)=\\rho(t)g(x)$ ($0<\\alpha \\le 1$) by the\nobservation at a single point $x_0$. We are mainly concerned with the situation\nof $x_0 \\notin$ supp g, which is practically important but has not been well\ninvestigated in literature. Assuming the finite sign changes of $\\rho$ and an\nextra observation interval, we establish the multiple logarithmic stability for\nthe problem based on a reverse convolution inequality and a lower estimate for\npositive solutions. Meanwhile, we develop a fixed point iteration for the\nnumerical reconstruction and prove its convergence. The performance of the\nproposed method is illustrated by several numerical examples.\n", "  We present techniques that allow for $\\alpha$-cluster channels with realistic\n$\\alpha$-particle wave functions from No Core Shell Model calculations to be\nconstructed. We compare results of several clustering calculations with\nrealistic $\\alpha$ wave functions to those assuming a trivial $(0s)^4$\nstructure.\n", "  The long-standing challenge to describing charged particle dynamics in strong\nclassical electromagnetic fields is how to incorporate classical radiation,\nclassical radiation reaction and quantized photon emission into a consistent\nunified framework. The current, semiclassical methods to describe dynamics of\nquantum particles in strong classical fields also provide the theoretical\nframework for fundamental questions in gravity and hadron-hadron collisions,\nincluding Hawking radiation, cosmological particle production and\nthermalization of particles created in heavy-ion collisions. However, as we\nshow, these methods break down for highly relativistic particles propagating in\nstrong fields. They must therefore be improved and adapted for the description\nof laser-plasma experiments that typically involve the acceleration of\nelectrons. Theory developed from quantum electrodynamics, together with\ndedicated experimental efforts, offer the best-controllable context to\nestablish a robust, experimentally-validated foundation for the fundamental\ntheory of quantum effects in strong classical potentials.\n", "  We performed simultaneous observations at 326.5 MHz with the Ooty Radio\nTelescope and at 326, 610 and 1308 MHz with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope\nfor a sample of 12 pulsars, where frequency dependent single pulse behaviour\nwas reported. The single pulse sequences were analysed with fluctuation\nanalysis, sensitive to both the average fluctuation properties (using longitude\nresolved fluctuation spectrum and two-dimensional fluctuation spectrum) as well\nas temporal changes in these (using sliding two-dimensional fluctuation\nspectrum ) to establish concurrent changes in subpulse drifting over the\nmultiple frequencies employed. We report subpulse drifting in PSR J0934$-$5249\nfor the first time. We also report pulse nulling measurements in PSRs\nJ0934$-$5249, B1508+55, J1822$-$2256, B1845$-$19 and J1901$-$0906 for the first\ntime. Our measurements of subpulse drifting and pulse nulling for the rest of\nthe pulsars are consistent with previously reported values. Contrary to\nprevious belief, we find no evidence for a frequency dependent drift pattern in\nPSR B2016+28 implied by non-simultaneous observations by Oster et al. (1977).\nIn PSRs B1237+25, J1822$-$2256, J1901$-$0906 and B2045$-$16, our longer and\nmore sensitive observations reveal multiple drift rates with distinct P3. We\nincrease the sample of pulsars showing concurrent nulling across multiple\nfrequencies by more than 100 percent, adding 4 more pulsars to this sample. Our\nresults confirm and further strengthen the understanding that the subpulse\ndrifting and pulse nulling are broadband consistent with previous studies\n(Gajjar et al. 2014a; Rankin 1986; Weltevrede et al. 2007) and are closely tied\nto physics of polar gap.\n", "  The entanglement entropy (EE) of quantum systems is often used as a test of\nlow-energy descriptions by conformal field theory (CFT). Here we point out that\nthis is not a reliable indicator, as the EE often shows the same behavior even\nwhen a CFT description is not correct (as long as the system is asymptotically\nscale-invariant). We use constraints on the scaling dimension given by the CFT\nwith SU(2) symmetry to provide alternative tests with two- and four-point\ncorrelation functions, showing examples for quantum spin models in 1+1\ndimensions. In the case of a critical amplitude-product state expressed in the\nvalence-bond basis (where the amplitudes decay as a power law of the bond\nlength and the wave function is the product of all bond amplitudes), we show\nthat even though the EE exhibits the expected CFT behavior, there is no CFT\ndescription of this state. We provide numerical tests of the behavior predicted\nby CFT for the correlation functions in the critical transverse-field Ising\nchain and the $J$-$Q$ spin chain, where the conformal structure is well\nunderstood. That behavior is not reproduced in the amplitude-product state.\n", "  Coulomb branch chiral rings of $\\mathcal N=2$ SCFTs are conjectured to be\nfreely generated. While no counter-example is known, no direct evidence for the\nconjecture is known either. We initiate a systematic study of SCFTs with\nCoulomb branch chiral rings satisfying non-trivial relations, restricting our\nanalysis to rank 1. The main result of our study is that (rank-1) SCFTs with\nnon-freely generated CB chiral rings when deformed by relevant deformations,\nalways flow to theories with non-freely generated CB rings. This implies that\nif they exist, they must thus form a distinct subset under RG flows. We also\nfind many interesting characteristic properties that these putative theories\nsatisfy which may behelpful in proving or disproving their existence using\nother methods.\n", "  Within holography the DC conductivity can be obtained by solving a system of\nStokes equations for an auxiliary fluid living on the black hole horizon. We\nshow that these equations can be derived from a novel variational principle\ninvolving a functional that depends on the fluid variables of interest as well\nas the time reversed quantities. This leads to simple derivation of the Onsager\nrelations for the conductivity. We also obtain the relevant Stokes equations\nfor bulk theories of gravity in four dimensions including a $\\vartheta F\\wedge\nF$ term in the Lagrangian, where $\\vartheta$ is a function of dynamical scalar\nfields. We discuss various realisations of the anomalous Hall conductivity that\nthis term induces and also solve the Stokes equations for holographic lattices\nwhich break translations in one spatial dimension.\n", "  We study various aspects of wormholes that are made traversable by an\ninteraction beween the two asymptotic boundaries. We concentrate on the case of\nnearly-$AdS_2$ gravity and discuss a very simple mechanical picture for the\ngravitational dynamics. We derive a formula for the two sided correlators that\nincludes the effect of gravitational backreaction, which limits the amount of\ninformation we can send through the wormhole. We emphasize that the process can\nbe viewed as a teleportation protocol where the teleportee feels nothing\nspecial as he/she goes through the wormhole. We discuss some applications to\nthe cloning paradox for old black holes. We point out that the same formula we\nderived for $AdS_2$ gravity is also valid for the simple SYK quantum mechanical\ntheory, around the thermofield double state. We present a heuristic picture for\nthis phenomenon in terms of an operator growth model. Finally, we show that a\nsimilar effect is present in a completely classical chaotic system with a large\nnumber of degrees of freedom.\n", "  We introduce a broad class of fractal jet observables that recursively probe\nthe collective properties of hadrons produced in jet fragmentation. To describe\nthese collinear-unsafe observables, we generalize the formalism of\nfragmentation functions, which are important objects in QCD for calculating\ncross sections involving identified final-state hadrons. Fragmentation\nfunctions are fundamentally nonperturbative, but have a calculable\nrenormalization group evolution. Unlike ordinary fragmentation functions,\ngeneralized fragmentation functions exhibit nonlinear evolution, since fractal\nobservables involve correlated subsets of hadrons within a jet. Some special\ncases of generalized fragmentation functions are reviewed, including jet charge\nand track functions. We then consider fractal jet observables that are based on\nhierarchical clustering trees, where the nonlinear evolution equations also\nexhibit tree-like structure at leading order. We develop a numeric code for\nperforming this evolution and study its phenomenological implications. As an\napplication, we present examples of fractal jet observables that are useful in\ndiscriminating quark jets from gluon jets.\n", "  It is performed a detailed dynamical analysis for a bulk viscosity model in\nthe full Israel-Stewart formalism for a spatially flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe. In our study we have considered the total\ncosmic fluid constituted by radiation, dark matter and dark energy. The dark\nmatter fluid is treated as an imperfect fluid which has a bulk viscosity that\ndepends on its energy density in the usual form $\\xi(\\rho_{m})=\\xi_{0}\n\\rho_{m}^{1/2}$, whereas the other components are assumed to behave as perfect\nfluids with constant EoS parameter. We show that the thermal history of the\nUniverse is reproduced provided that the viscous coefficient satisfies the\ncondition $\\xi_{0}\\ll 1$, either for a zero or a suitable nonzero coupling\nbetween dark energy and viscous dark matter. In this case, the final attractor\nis a dark-energy-dominated, accelerating Universe, with effective EoS parameter\nin the quintessence-like, cosmological constant-like or phantom-like regime, in\nagreement with observations. As our main result, we show that in order to\nobtain a viable cosmological evolution and at the same time alleviating the\ncosmological coincidence problem via the mechanism of scaling solution, an\nexplicit interaction between dark energy and viscous dark matter seems\ninevitable. This result is consistent with the well-known fact that models\nwhere dark matter and dark energy interact with each other have been proposed\nto solve the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by insisting in above, we show\nthat in the present context a phantom nature of this interacting dark energy\nfluid is also favored.\n", "  We are concerned with the dynamical description of the motion of a stochastic\nmicro-swimmer with constant speed and fluctuating orientation in the long time\nlimit by adiabatic elimination of the orientational variable. Starting with the\ncorresponding full set of Langevin equations, we eliminate the memory in the\nstochastic orientation and obtain a stochastic equation for the position alone\nin the overdamped limit. An equivalent procedure based on the Fokker-Planck\nequation is presented as well.\n", "  Linear, suspended chains of magnetic atoms proximity coupled to an s-wave\nsuperconductor are predicted to host Majorana zero modes at the chain ends in\nthe presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. Specifically, iron (Fe) chains on\nPb(110) have been explored as a possible system to exhibit topological\nsuperconductivity and host Majorana zero-modes [Nadj-Perge, et al., Science\n346, 602 (2014)]. Here, we study chains of the transition metal cobalt (Co) on\nPb(110) and check for topological signatures. Using spin-polarized scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy, we resolve ferromagnetic order in the $d$ bands of the\nchains. Interestingly, also the subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands carry a\nspin polarization as was predicted decades ago. Superconducting tips allow us\nto resolve further details of the YSR bands and in particular resonances at\nzero energy. We map the spatial distribution of the zero-energy signal and find\nit delocalized along the chain. Hence, despite of the ferromagnetic coupling\nwithin the chains and the strong-spin orbit coupling in the superconductor, we\ndo not find clear evidence of Majorana modes. Simple tight-binding calculations\nsuggest that the spin-orbit-split bands may cross the Fermi level four times\nwhich suppresses the zero-energy modes.\n", "  The formation of framework vacancies in Si- and Ge-based type-I clathrates is\nstudied as function of filling the cages with K and Ba atoms using\ndensity-functional theory. Our analysis reveals the relevance of structural\ndisorder, geometric relaxation, electronic saturation, as well as vibrational\nand configurational entropy. In the Si clathrates we find that vacancies are\nunstable, but very differently, in Ge clathrates up to three vacancies per unit\ncell can be stabilized. This contrasting behavior is largely driven by the\ndifferent energy gain on populating the electronic vacancy states, which\noriginates from the different degree of localization of the valence orbitals of\nSi and Ge. This also actuates a qualitatively different atomic relaxation of\nthe framework.\n", "  Exotic compact objects, horizonless spacetimes with reflective properties,\nhave intriguingly been suggested by some quantum-gravity models as alternatives\nto classical black-hole spacetimes. A remarkable feature of spinning\nhorizonless compact objects with reflective boundary conditions is the\nexistence of a {\\it discrete} set of critical surface radii,\n$\\{r_{\\text{c}}({\\bar a};n)\\}^{n=\\infty}_{n=1}$, which can support spatially\nregular static ({\\it marginally-stable}) scalar field configurations (here\n${\\bar a}\\equiv J/M^2$ is the dimensionless angular momentum of the exotic\ncompact object). Interestingly, the outermost critical radius\n$r^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c}}\\equiv \\text{max}_n\\{r_{\\text{c}}({\\bar a};n)\\}$\nmarks the boundary between stable and unstable exotic compact objects: spinning\nobjects whose reflecting surfaces are situated in the region\n$r_{\\text{c}}>r^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c}}({\\bar a})$ are stable, whereas spinning\nobjects whose reflecting surfaces are situated in the region\n$r_{\\text{c}}<r^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c}}({\\bar a})$ are superradiantly unstable\nto scalar perturbation modes. In the present paper we use analytical techniques\nin order to explore the physical properties of the critical (marginally-stable)\nspinning exotic compact objects. In particular, we derive a remarkably compact\n{\\it analytical} formula for the discrete spectrum\n$\\{r^{\\text{max}}_{\\text{c}}({\\bar a})\\}$ of critical radii which characterize\nthe marginally-stable exotic compact objects. We explicitly demonstrate that\nthe analytically derived resonance spectrum agrees remarkably well with\nnumerical results that recently appeared in the physics literature.\n", "  We study the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the magnetised\ncosmic web. We focus on the particular case of highly magnetised voids ($B \\sim\n\\text{nG}$), using the upper bounds from the Planck satellite. The cosmic web\nwas obtained from purely magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulations of\nstructure formation considering different power spectra for the seed magnetic\nfield in order to account for theoretical uncertainties. We investigate the\nimpact of these uncertainties on the propagation of cosmic rays, showing that\nthey can affect the measured spectrum and composition by up to $\\simeq 80\\%$\nand $\\simeq 5\\%$, respectivelly. In our scenarios, even if magnetic fields in\nvoids are strong, deflections of 50 EeV protons from sources closer than\n$\\sim\\;$50 Mpc are less than $15^\\circ$ in approximately 10-50% of the sky,\ndepending on the distribution of sources and magnetic power spectrum.\nTherefore, UHECR astronomy might be possible in a significant portion of the\nsky depending on the primordial magnetic power spectrum, provided that protons\nconstitute a sizeable fraction of the observed UHECR flux.\n", "  The application of local periodic heating for controlling a spatially\ndeveloping shear layer downstream of a finite-thickness splitter plate is\nexamined by numerically solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. At\nthe trailing edge of the plate, oscillatory heat flux boundary condition is\nprescribed as the thermal forcing input to the shear layer. The thermal forcing\nintroduces low level of oscillatory surface vorticity flux and baroclinic\nvorticity at the actuation frequency in the vicinity of the trailing edge. The\nproduced vortical perturbations can independently excite the fundamental\ninstability that accounts for shear layer roll-up as well as the subharmonic\ninstability that encourages the vortex pairing process farther downstream. We\ndemonstrate that the nonlinear dynamics of a spatially developing shear layer\ncan be modified by local oscillatory heat flux as a control input. We believe\nthat this study provides a basic foundation for flow control using\nthermal-energy-deposition-based actuators such as thermophones and plasma\nactuators.\n", "  We complement studies of the neutral pion transition form factor pi^0 -->\ngamma^(*) gamma^(*) with calculations for the electromagnetic decay widths of\nthe processes pi^0 --> e^+ e^-, pi^0 --> e^+ e^- gamma and pi^0 --> e^+ e^- e^+\ne^-. Their common feature is that the singly- or doubly-virtual transition form\nfactor serves as a vital input that is tested in the non-perturbative\nlow-momentum region of QCD. We determine this form factor from a\nwell-established and symmetry-preserving truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger\nequations. Our results for the three- and four-body decays match results of\nprevious theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. For the rare\ndecay we employ a numerical method to calculate the process directly by\ndeforming integration contours, which in principle can be generalized to\narbitrary integrals as long as the analytic structure of the integrands are\nknown. Our result for the rare decay is in agreement with dispersive\ncalculations but still leaves a 2 sigma discrepancy between theory and\nexperiment.\n", "  The dynamics of unimolecular photo-triggered reactions can be strongly\naffected by the surrounding medium. An accurate description of these reactions\nrequires knowing the free energy surface (FES) and the friction felt by the\nreactants. Most of theories start from the Langevin equation to derive the\ndynamics, but there are few examples comparing it with experiments. Here we\nexplore the applicability of a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) with an\narbitrary potential and a non-markovian friction. To this end we have performed\nbroadband fluorescence measurements with sub-picosecond time resolution of a\ncovalently linked organic electron donor-acceptor system in solvents of\nchanging viscosity and dielectric permittivity. In order to establish the FES\nof the reaction we resort to stationary electronic spectroscopy. On the other\nhand, the dynamics of a non-reacting substance, Coumarin 153, provide the\ncalibrating tool for the friction over the FES, which is assumed to be solute\nindependent. A simpler and computationally faster approach uses the Generalized\nSmoluchowski Equation (GSE), which can be derived from the GLE for pure\nharmonic potentials. Both approaches reproduce the measurements in most of the\nsolvents reasonably well. At long times, some differences arise from the errors\ninherited from the analysis of the stationary solvatochromism and at short\ntimes from the excess excitation energy. However, whenever the dynamics become\nslow the GSE shows larger deviations than the GLE, the results of which always\nagree qualitatively with the measured dynamics, regardless of the solvent\nviscosity or dielectric properties. The here applied method can be used to\npredict the dynamics of any other reacting system, given the FES parameters and\nsolvent dynamics are provided. Thus no fitting parameters enter the GLE\nsimulations, within the applicability limits found for the model in this work.\n", "  We investigate how external screening shapes excitons in two-dimensional (2d)\nsemiconductors embedded in laterally structured dielectric environments. An\natomic scale view of these elementary excitations is developed using models\nwhich apply to a variety of materials including transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs). We find that structured dielectrics imprint a peculiar\npotential energy landscape on excitons in these systems: While the ground-state\nexciton is least influenced, higher excitations are attracted towards regions\nwith high dielectric constant of the environment. This landscape is \"inverted\"\nin the sense that low energy excitons are less strongly affected than their\nhigher energy counterparts. Corresponding energy variations emerge on length\nscales of the order of a few unit cells. This opens the prospect of trapping\nand guiding of higher excitons by means of tailor-made dielectric substrates on\nultimately small spatial scales.\n", "  We present a precise lattice computation of pseudoscalar and vector\nheavy-light meson masses for heavy-quark masses ranging from the physical charm\nmass up to $\\simeq 4$ times the physical b-quark mass. We employ the gauge\nconfigurations generated by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with\n$N_f = 2+1+1$ dynamical quarks at three values of the lattice spacing ($a\n\\simeq 0.062, 0.082, 0.089$ fm) with pion masses in the range $M_\\pi \\simeq 210\n- 450$ MeV. The heavy-quark mass is simulated directly on the lattice up to\n$\\simeq 3$ times the physical charm mass. The interpolation to the physical\n$b$-quark mass is performed using the ETMC ratio method, based on ratios of the\nmeson masses computed at nearby heavy-quark masses, and adopting the kinetic\nmass scheme. The extrapolation to the physical pion mass and to the continuum\nlimit yields $m_b^{\\rm kin}(1~\\mbox{GeV}) = 4.61 (20)$ GeV, which corresponds\nto $\\overline{m}_b(\\overline{m}_b) = 4.26 (18)$ GeV in the $\\overline{MS}$\nscheme. The lattice data are analyzed in terms of the Heavy Quark Expansion\n(HQE) and the matrix elements of dimension-4 and dimension-5 operators are\nextracted with a good precision, namely: $\\overline{\\Lambda} = 0.552 (26)$ GeV,\n$\\mu_\\pi^2 = 0.321 (32)$ GeV$^2$ and $\\mu_G^2(m_b) = 0.253 (25)$ GeV$^2$. The\ndata also allow for a rough estimate of the dimension-6 operator matrix\nelements. As the HQE parameters play a crucial role in the inclusive\ndetermination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements $V_{ub}$ and\n$V_{cb}$, their precise determination on the lattice may eventually validate\nand improve the analyses based on fits to the semileptonic moments.\n", "  In the paper we present results for final state emissions of lepton pairs in\ndecays of heavy intermediate states principally of Z boson, but of some\nimportance for the W decays as well. The presented semi-analytical calculation\nand PHOTOS MC program are in numerical agreement to better than $5\\%$ of pair\neffects. Suggestions for the future works are given.\n", "  We consider quantum lifetime derived from low-field Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations as a metric of quality of the two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs\nquantum wells that expresses large excitation gaps in the fractional quantum\nHall states of the N=1 Landau level. Analysis indicates two salient features:\n1) small density inhomogeneities dramatically impact the amplitude of\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations such that the canonical method (cf. Coleridge,\nPhys. Rev. B \\textbf{44}, 3793) for determination of quantum lifetime\nsubstantially underestimates $\\tau_q$ unless density inhomogeneity is\nexplicitly considered; 2) $\\tau_q$ does not correlate well with quality as\nmeasured by $\\Delta_{5/2}$, the excitation gap of the fractional quantum Hall\nstate at 5/2 filling.\n", "  We explore the implications of the Borexino experiment's real time\nmeasurements of the lowest energy part of the neutrino spectrum from the\nprimary pp fusion process up to 0.420 MeV through the 7^Be decay at 0.862 MeV\nto the pep reaction at 1.44 MeV. We exploit the fact that at such low energies,\nthe large mixing angle solution to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein matter\neffects in the sun are small for 7^Be and pep and negligible for pp.\nConsequently, the neutrinos produced in the sun change their flavor almost\nentirely through vacuum oscillations during propagation from the sun's surface\nand through possible nonstandard interactions acting at the solar source and\nBorexino detector. We combine the different NSI effects at source and detector\nin a single framework and use the current Borexino data to bound NSI\nnon-universal and flavor- changing parameters at energies below the reach of\nreactor neutrino experiments. We also study the implication of the current data\nfor the weak- mixing angle at this \"low-energy frontier\" data from the Borexino\nexperiment, where it is expected to be slightly larger than its value at the Z\nmass. We find $\\sin^2(\\theta)w=0.224+-0.016$, the lowest energy-scale estimate\nto date. Looking to the future, we use projected sensitivities to solar\nneutrinos in next generation dedicated solar experiments and direct dark matter\ndetection experiments and find a potential factor five improvement in\ndetermination of the weak-mixing angle and up to an order of magnitude\nimprovement in probing the NSI parameters space.\n", "  The treatment of mixing processes is still one of the major uncertainties in\n1D stellar evolution models. This is mostly due to the need to parametrize and\napproximate aspects of hydrodynamics in hydrostatic codes. In particular, the\neffect of hydrodynamic instabilities in rotating stars, for example, dynamical\nshear instability, evades consistent description. We intend to study the\naccuracy of the diffusion approximation to dynamical shear in hydrostatic\nstellar evolution models by comparing 1D models to a first-principle\nhydrodynamics simulation starting from the same initial conditions. We chose an\ninitial model calculated with the stellar evolution code GENEC that is just at\nthe onset of a dynamical shear instability but does not show any other\ninstabilities (e.g., convection). This was mapped to the hydrodynamics code SLH\nto perform a 2D simulation in the equatorial plane. We compare the resulting\nprofiles in the two codes and compute an effective diffusion coefficient for\nthe hydro simulation. Shear instabilities develop in the 2D simulation in the\nregions predicted by linear theory to become unstable in the 1D model. Angular\nvelocity and chemical composition is redistributed in the unstable region,\nthereby creating new unstable regions. Eventually the 2D simulation settles in\na symmetric, steady state, which is Richardson stable everywhere, whereas the\ninstability remains for longer in the 1D model due to current limitations in\nthe 1D code. A spatially resolved diffusion coefficient is extracted by\ncomparing the initial and final profiles of mean atomic mass. The presented\nsimulation gives a first insight on hydrodynamics of shear instabilities in a\nreal stellar environment and even allows us to directly extract an effective\ndiffusion coefficient. We see evidence for a critical Richardson number of 0.25\nas regions above this value remain stable for the course of the simulation.\n", "  The recent detection of two faint and extended star clusters in the central\nregions of two Local Group dwarf galaxies, Eridanus II and Andromeda XXV,\nraises the question of whether clusters with such low densities can survive the\ntidal field of cold dark matter haloes with central density cusps. Using both\nanalytic arguments and a suite of collisionless N-body simulations, I show that\nthese clusters are extremely fragile and quickly disrupted in the presence of\ncentral cusps $\\rho\\sim r^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha\\gtrsim 0.2$. Furthermore, the\nscenario in which the clusters where originally more massive and sank to the\ncenter of the halo requires extreme fine tuning and does not naturally\nreproduce the observed systems. In turn, these clusters are long lived in cored\nhaloes, whose central regions are safe shelters for $\\alpha\\lesssim 0.2$. The\nonly viable scenario for hosts that have preserved their primoridal cusp to the\npresent time is that the clusters formed at rest at the bottom of the\npotential, which is easily tested by measurement of the clusters proper\nvelocity within the host. This offers means to readily probe the central\ndensity profile of two dwarf galaxies as faint as $L_V\\sim5\\times 10^5 L_\\odot$\nand $L_V\\sim6\\times10^4 L_\\odot$, in which stellar feedback is unlikely to be\neffective.\n", "  We study physical properties of constant curvature black holes (CCBHs) in\nEinstein anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity. These objects, which are locally AdS\nthroughout the space, are constructed from identifications of global AdS\nspacetime, in a similar fashion as Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole\nin three dimensions. We find that, in dimensions equal or greater than four,\nCCBHs have zero mass and angular momentum. Only in odd dimensions we are able\nto associate a nonvanishing conserved quantity to these solutions, which\ncorresponds to the vacuum (Casimir) energy of the spacetime.\n", "  Current three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical model atmospheres together with\nNLTE spectrum synthesis, permit to derive reliable atomic and isotopic chemical\nabundances from high-resolution stellar spectra. Not much is known about the\npresence of the fragile 6Li isotope in evolved solar-metallicity RGB stars, not\nto mention its production in magnetically active targets like HD123351. From\nfits of the observed CFHT spectrum with synthetic line profiles based on 1D and\n3D model atmospheres, we seek to estimate the abundance of the 6Li isotope and\nto place constraints on its origin. We derive A(Li) and the 6Li/7Li isotopic\nratio by fitting different synthetic spectra to the Li-line region of a\nhigh-resolution CFHT spectrum (R=120 000, S/R=400). The synthetic spectra are\ncomputed with four different line lists, using in parallel 3D hydrodynamical\nCO5BOLD and 1D LHD model atmospheres and treating the line formation of the\nlithium components in non-LTE (NLTE). We find A(Li)=1.69+/-0.11 dex and\n6Li/7Li=8.0+/-4.4 % in 3D-NLTE, using the line list of Mel\\'endez et al.\n(2012), updated with new atomic data for V I, which results in the best fit of\nthe lithium line profile of HD123351. Two other line lists lead to similar\nresults but with inferior fit qualities. Our 2-sigma detection of the 6Li\nisotope is the result of a careful statistical analysis and the visual\ninspection of each achieved fit. Since the presence of a significant amount of\n6Li in the atmosphere of a cool evolved star is not expected in the framework\nof standard stellar evolution theory, non-standard, external lithium production\nmechanisms, possibly related to stellar activity or a recent accretion of rocky\nmaterial, need to be invoked to explain the detection of 6Li in HD123351.\n", "  Nanophotonics has become a key enabling technology in biomedicine with great\npromises in early diagnosis and less invasive therapies. In this context, the\nunique capability of plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles to concentrate light\non the nanometer scale has widely contributed to biosensing and enhanced\nspectroscopy. Recently, high-refractive index dielectric nanostructures\nfeaturing low loss resonances have been proposed as a promising alternative to\nnanoplasmonics, potentially offering better sensing performances along with\nfull compatibility with the microelectronics industry. In this letter we report\nthe first demonstration of biosensing with silicon nanoresonators integrated in\nstate-of-the-art microfluidics. Our lab-on-a-chip platform enables detecting\nProstate Specific Antigen (PSA) cancer marker in human serum with a sensitivity\nthat meets clinical needs. These performances are directly compared with its\nplasmonic counterpart based on gold nanorods. Our work opens new opportunities\nin the development of future point-of-care devices towards a more personalized\nhealthcare.\n", "  Attosecond transient-absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) is an established method\nfor exploring electron dynamics on the subfemtosecond time-scale. ATAS spectra\ncontain certain ubiquitous features, such as oscillating fringes, light-induced\nstructures and hyperbolic sidebands, representing physical processes. We derive\nclosed analytical expressions describing these features, based on a three-level\nsystem responding adiabatically to the influence of an infrared field in\nconjunction with an extreme ultraviolet pulse, and use He to illustrate the\ntheory. The validity of the formulas is substantiated by comparing their\npredictions with spectra calculated numerically by the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The closed analytical forms and the details of their\nderivation resolve the origins of the features.\n", "  Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) constitute an ideal astrophysical environment to\ntest our current understanding of relativistic plasma processes. It is well\nknown that magnetic fields play a crucial role in their dynamics and emission\nproperties. At present, one of the main issues concerns the level of magnetic\nturbulence present in these systems, which in the absence of space resolved\nX-ray polarization measures cannot be directly constrained. In this work we\ninvestigate, for the first time using simulated synchrotron maps, the effect of\na small scale fluctuating component of the magnetic field on the emission\nproperties in X-ray. We illustrate how to include the effects of a turbulent\ncomponent in standard emission models for PWNe, and which consequences are\nexpected in terms of net emissivity and depolarization, showing that the X-ray\nsurface brightness maps can provide already some rough constraints. We then\napply our analysis to the Crab and Vela nebulae and, by comparing our model\nwith Chandra and Vela data, we found that the typical energies in the turbulent\ncomponent of the magnetic field are about 1.5 to 3 times the one in the ordered\nfield.\n", "  One of the challenging issues in additive manufacturing (AM) oriented\ntopology optimization is how to design structures that are self-supportive in a\nmanufacture process without introducing additional supporting materials. In the\npresent contribution, it is intended to resolve this problem under an explicit\ntopology optimization framework where optimal structural topology can be found\nby optimizing a set of explicit geometry parameters. Two solution approaches\nestablished based on the Moving Morphable Components (MMC) and Moving Morphable\nVoids (MMV) frameworks, respectively, are proposed and some theoretical issues\nassociated with AM oriented topology optimization are also analyzed. Numerical\nexamples provided demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n", "  A rattleback is a rigid, semi-elliptic toy which exhibits unintuitive\nbehavior; when it is spun in one direction, it soon begins pitching and stops\nspinning, then it starts to spin in the opposite direction, but in the other\ndirection, it seems to spin just steadily. This puzzling behavior results from\nthe slight misalignment between the principal axes for the inertia and those\nfor the curvature; the misalignment couples the spinning with the pitching and\nthe rolling oscillations. It has been shown that under the no-slip condition\nand without dissipation the spin can reverse in both directions, and Garcia and\nHubbard obtained the formula for the time required for the spin reversal $t_r$\n[Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 418, 165-197 (1988) ]. In this work, we reformulate the\nrattleback dynamics in a physically transparent way and reduce it to a\nthree-variable dynamics for spinning, pitching, and rolling. We obtain an\nexpression of the Garcia-Hubbard formula for $t_r$ by a simple product of four\nfactors: (1) the misalignment angle, (2) the difference in the inverses of\ninertia moment for the two oscillations, (3) that in the radii for the two\nprincipal curvatures, and (4) the squared frequency of the oscillation. We\nperform extensive numerical simulations to examine validity and limitation of\nthe formula, and find that (1) the Garcia-Hubbard formula is good for both\nspinning directions in the small spin and small oscillation regime, but (2) in\nthe fast spin regime especially for the steady direction, the rattleback may\nnot reverse and shows a rich variety of dynamics including steady spinning,\nspin wobbling, and chaotic behavior reminiscent of chaos in a dissipative\nsystem.\n", "  A polymer chain confined in nano-scale geometry has been used to investigate\nthe underlying mechanism of Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), where transport of\ncargoes is directional. It was shown here that depending on the solvent quality\n(good or poor) across the channel, a polymer chain can be either inside or\noutside the channel or both. Exact results based on the short chain revealed\nthat a slight variation in the solvent quality can drag polymer chain inside\nthe pore and {\\it vice versa} similar to one seen in NPC. Furthermore, we also\nreport the absence of crystalline (highly dense) state when the pore-size is\nless than the certain value, which may have potential application in packaging\nof DNA inside the preformed viral proheads.\n", "  A recently proposed exact algorithm for the maximum independent set problem\nis analyzed. The typical running time is improved exponentially in some\nparameter regions compared to simple binary search. The algorithm also\novercomes the core transition point, where the conventional leaf removal\nalgorithm fails, and works up to the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) transition\npoint. This suggests that a leaf removal core itself is not enough for typical\nhardness in the random maximum independent set problem, providing further\nevidence for RSB being the obstacle for algorithms in general.\n", "  The electron microscope has been a powerful, highly versatile workhorse in\nthe fields of material and surface science, micro and nanotechnology, biology\nand geology, for nearly 80 years. The advent of two-dimensional materials opens\nnew possibilities for realising an analogy to electron microscopy in the solid\nstate. Here we provide a perspective view on how a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac\nfermion-based microscope can be realistically implemented and operated, using\ngraphene as a vacuum chamber for ballistic electrons. We use semiclassical\nsimulations to propose concrete architectures and design rules of 2D electron\nguns, deflectors, tunable lenses and various detectors. The simulations show\nhow simple objects can be imaged with well-controlled and collimated in-plane\nbeams consisting of relativistic charge carriers. Finally, we discuss the\npotential of such microscopes for investigating edges, terminations and\ndefects, as well as interfaces, including external nanoscale structures such as\nadsorbed molecules, nanoparticles or quantum dots.\n", "  Polariton lasing is the coherent emission arising from a macroscopic\npolariton condensate first proposed in 1996. Over the past two decades,\npolariton lasing has been demonstrated in a few inorganic and organic\nsemiconductors in both low and room temperatures. Polariton lasing in inorganic\nmaterials significantly relies on sophisticated epitaxial growth of crystalline\ngain medium layers sandwiched by two distributed Bragg reflectors in which\ncombating the built-in strain and mismatched thermal properties is nontrivial.\nOn the other hand, organic active media usually suffer from large threshold\ndensity and weak nonlinearity due to the Frenkel exciton nature. Further\ndevelopment of polariton lasing towards technologically significant\napplications demand more accessible materials, ease of device fabrication and\nbroadly tunable emission at room temperature. Herein, we report the\nexperimental realization of room-temperature polariton lasing based on an\nepitaxy-free all-inorganic cesium lead chloride perovskite microcavity.\nPolariton lasing is unambiguously evidenced by a superlinear power dependence,\nmacroscopic ground state occupation, blueshift of ground state emission,\nnarrowing of the linewidth and the build-up of long-range spatial coherence.\nOur work suggests considerable promise of lead halide perovskites towards\nlarge-area, low-cost, high performance room temperature polariton devices and\ncoherent light sources extending from the ultraviolet to near infrared range.\n", "  Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) has been demonstrated in silicon\nwaveguides in recent years. However, due to the weak interaction between\nphotons and acoustic phonons in these waveguides, long interaction length is\ntypically necessary. Here, we experimentally show that forward stimulated\nBrillouin scattering in a short interaction length of a 20 um radius silicon\nmicroring resonator could give 1.2 dB peak gain at only 10mW coupled pump\npower. The experimental results demonstrate that both optical and acoustic\nmodes can have efficient interaction in a short interaction length. The\nobserved Brillouin gain varies with coupled pump power in good agreement with\ntheoretical prediction. The work shows the potential of SBS in silicon for\nmoving the demonstrated fiber SBS applications to the integrated silicon\nphotonics platform.\n", "  Theoretical models of self-interacting dark matter represent a promising\nanswer to a series of open problems within the so-called collisionless cold\ndark matter (CCDM) paradigm. In case of asymmetric dark matter,\nself-interactions might facilitate gravitational collapse and potentially lead\nto formation of compact objects predominantly made of dark matter. Considering\nboth fermionic and bosonic equations of state, we construct the equilibrium\nstructure of rotating dark stars, focusing on their bulk properties, and\ncomparing them with baryonic neutron stars. We also show that these dark\nobjects admit the $I$-Love-$Q$ universal relations, which link their moments of\ninertia, tidal deformabilities, and quadrupole moments. Finally, we prove that\nstars built with a dark matter equation of state are not compact enough to\nmimic black holes in general relativity, thus making them distinguishable in\npotential events of gravitational interferometers.\n", "  In order to model a spiral spin state in a thin film, we study a classical\nHeisenberg model with open boundary conditions. With magnetic field applied in\nthe plane of the film, the spin state becomes ferromagnetic above a critical\nfield that increases with thickness $N$. For a given $N$, the spiral passes\nthrough states with $n= n_0$ up to 0 complete periods in steps of 1. These\nnumerical results agree with earlier analytic results in the continuum limit\nand help explain the susceptibility jumps observed in thin films.\n", "  We solve renormalization group equations that govern infrared divergences of\nmassless and massive form factors. By comparing to recent results for planar\nmassive three-loop and massless four-loop form factors in QCD, we give\npredictions for the high-energy limit of massive form factors at the four- and\nfor the massless form factor at five-loop order. Furthermore, we discuss the\nrelation which connects infrared divergences regularized dimensionally and via\na small quark mass and extend results present in the literature to higher\norder.\n", "  We measure the Planck cluster mass bias using dynamical mass measurements\nbased on velocity dispersions of a subsample of 17 Planck-detected clusters.\nThe velocity dispersions were calculated using redshifts determined from\nspectra obtained at Gemini observatory with the GMOS multi-object spectrograph.\nWe correct our estimates for effects due to finite aperture, Eddington bias and\ncorrelated scatter between velocity dispersion and the Planck mass proxy. The\nresult for the mass bias parameter, $(1-b)$, depends on the value of the galaxy\nvelocity bias $b_v$ adopted from simulations: $(1-b)=(0.51\\pm0.09) b_v^3$.\nUsing a velocity bias of $b_v=1.08$ from Munari et al., we obtain\n$(1-b)=0.64\\pm 0.11$, i.e, an error of 17% on the mass bias measurement with 17\nclusters. This mass bias value is consistent with most previous weak lensing\ndeterminations. It lies within $1\\sigma$ of the value needed to reconcile the\nPlanck cluster counts with the Planck primary CMB constraints. We emphasize\nthat uncertainty in the velocity bias severely hampers precision measurements\nof the mass bias using velocity dispersions. On the other hand, when we fix the\nPlanck mass bias using the constraints from Penna-Lima et al., based on weak\nlensing measurements, we obtain a positive velocity bias $b_v \\gtrsim 0.9$ at\n$3\\sigma$.\n", "  Heavy quark form factors are calculated at $\\beta_0 \\alpha_s \\sim 1$ to all\norders in $\\alpha_s$ at the first order in $1/\\beta_0$. The $n_f^2 \\alpha_s^3$\nterms in the recent results [arXiv:1611.07535] for the vector form factors are\nconfirmed, and $n_f^{L-1} \\alpha_s^L$ terms for higher $L$ are predicted.\n", "  We perform Hamiltonian analysis of non-relativistic non-BPS Dp-brane. We find\nthe constraint structure of this theory and determine corresponding equations\nof motion. We further discuss property of this theory at the tachyon vacuum.\n", "  To properly describe heating in weakly collisional turbulent plasmas such as\nthe solar wind, inter-particle collisions should be taken into account.\nCollisions can convert ordered energy into heat by means of irreversible\nrelaxation towards the thermal equilibrium. Recently, Pezzi et al. (Phys. Rev.\nLett., vol. 116, 2016, p. 145001) showed that the plasma collisionality is\nenhanced by the presence of fine structures in velocity space. Here, the\nanalysis is extended by directly comparing the effects of the fully nonlinear\nLandau operator and a linearized Landau operator. By focusing on the relaxation\ntowards the equilibrium of an out of equilibrium distribution function in a\nhomogeneous force-free plasma, here it is pointed out that it is significant to\nretain nonlinearities in the collisional operator to quantify the importance of\ncollisional effects. Although the presence of several characteristic times\nassociated with the dissipation of different phase space structures is\nrecovered in both the cases of the nonlinear and the linearized operators, the\ninfluence of these times is different in the two cases. In the linearized\noperator case, the recovered characteristic times are systematically larger\nthan in the fully nonlinear operator case, this suggesting that fine velocity\nstructures are dissipated slower if nonlinearities are neglected in the\ncollisional operator.\n", "  Background\n  The nuclear structure of the cluster bands in $^{20}$Ne presents a challenge\nfor different theoretical approaches. It is especially difficult to explain the\nbroad 0$^+$, 2$^+$ states at 9 MeV excitation energy. Simultaneously, it is\nimportant to obtain more reliable experimental data for these levels in order\nto quantitatively assess the theoretical framework.\n  Purpose\n  To obtain new data on $^{20}$Ne $\\alpha$ cluster structure. Method Thick\ntarget inverse kinematics technique was used to study the $^{16}$O+$\\alpha$\nresonance elastic scattering and the data were analyzed using an \\textit{R}\nmatrix approach. The $^{20}$Ne spectrum, the cluster and nucleon spectroscopic\nfactors were calculated using cluster-nucleon configuration interaction model\n(CNCIM).\n  Results\n  We determined the parameters of the broad resonances in\n\\textsuperscript{20}Ne: 0$^+$ level at 8.77 $\\pm$ 0.150 MeV with a width of 750\n(+500/-220) keV; 2$^+$ level at 8.75 $\\pm$ 0.100 MeV with the width of 695\n$\\pm$ 120 keV; the width of 9.48 MeV level of 65 $\\pm$ 20 keV and showed that\n9.19 MeV, 2$^+$ level (if exists) should have width $\\leq$ 10 keV. The detailed\ncomparison of the theoretical CNCIM predictions with the experimental data on\ncluster states was made.\n  Conclusions\n  Our experimental results by the TTIK method generally confirm the adopted\ndata on $\\alpha$ cluster levels in $^{20}$Ne. The CNCIM gives a good\ndescription of the $^{20}$Ne positive parity states up to an excitation energy\nof $\\sim$ 7 MeV, predicting reasonably well the excitation energy of the states\nand their cluster and single particle properties. At higher excitations, the\nqualitative disagreement with the experimentally observed structure is evident,\nespecially for broad resonances.\n", "  Motivated by the recent observations of small Fermi energies and\ncomparatively large superconducting gaps, present also on bands not crossing\nthe Fermi energy (incipient bands) in iron-based superconductors, we analyse\nthe doping evolution of superconductivity in a four-band model across the\nLifshitz transition including BCS-BEC crossover effects on the shallow bands.\nSimilar to the BCS case we find that with hole doping the phase difference\nbetween superconducting order parameters of the hole bands changes from $0$ to\n$\\pi$ through an intermediate $s+is$ state breaking time-reversal symmetry. The\ntransition however occurs in the region where electron bands are incipient and\nchemical potential renormalization in the superconducting state leads to a\nsignificant broadening of the $s+is$ region. We further present the qualitative\nfeatures of the $s+is$ state that can be observed in scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy (STM) experiments also taking incipient bands into account.\n", "  We present an analytic computation of the Higgs production cross section in\nthe gluon fusion channel, which is differential in the components of the Higgs\nmomentum and inclusive in the associated partonic radiation through NNLO in\nperturbative QCD. Our computation includes the necessary higher order terms in\nthe dimensional regulator beyond the finite part that are required for\nrenormalisation and collinear factorisation at N$^3$LO. We outline in detail\nthe computational methods which we employ. We present numerical predictions for\nrealistic final state observables, specifically distributions for the decay\nproducts of the Higgs boson in the $\\gamma\\gamma$ decay channel.\n", "  In granular physics experiments, it is a persistent challenge to obtain the\nboundary stress measurements necessary to provide full a rheological\ncharacterization of the dynamics. Here, we describe a new technique by which\nthe outer boundary of a 2D Couette cell both confines the granular material and\nprovides spatially- and temporally- resolved stress measurements. This key\nadvance is enabled by desktop laser-cutting technology, which allows us to\ndesign and cut linearly-deformable walls with a specified spring constant. By\ntracking the position of each segment of the wall, we measure both the normal\nand tangential stress throughout the experiment. This permits us to calculate\nthe amount of shear stress provided by basal friction, and thereby determine\naccurate values of $\\mu(I)$.\n", "  We have employed RMF+BCS (relativistic mean-field plus BCS) approach to study\nbehaviour of pf shell with the help of ground state properties of even-even\nnuclei. Our present investigations include separation energies , deformations,\nsingle particle energies, wavefunction, potential as well etc density\ndistribution. As per recent experiments showing neutron magicity at N = 32 for\nCa isotopes, our results with mass dependent pairing indicate a shell closure\nat N = 32 in Ca isotopes and a more strong shell closure at N = 34 in proton\ndeficient 48Si because of reorganization of neutron pf shell. In a similar\nmanner, proton pf shell structure is more likely to produce shell closure at Z\n= 34 with a doubly magic character for 84,116Se. We have also included N = 40\nisotones and Z = 40 isotopes for our study and predicted 60Ca and 68Ni as\ndoubly magic nuclei out of which 60Ca is found near dripline of Ca and a\npotential candidate for future studies in the chain of Ca isotopes next to\ndoubly magic 52Ca.\n", "  In N=1 supergravity the tree-level scalar potential of the hidden sector may\nhave a minimum with broken local supersymmetry (SUSY) as well as a\nsupersymmetric Minkowski vacuum. These vacua can be degenerate, allowing for a\nconsistent implementation of the multiple point principle. The first minimum\nwhere SUSY is broken can be identified with the physical phase in which we\nlive. In the second supersymmetric phase, in flat Minkowski space, SUSY may be\nbroken dynamically either in the observable or in the hidden sectors inducing a\ntiny vacuum energy density. We argue that the exact degeneracy of these phases\nmay shed light on the smallness of the cosmological constant. Other possible\nphenomenological implications are also discussed. In particular, we point out\nthat the presence of such degenerate vacua may lead to small values of the\nquartic Higgs coupling and its beta function at the Planck scale in the\nphysical phase.\n", "  The early reionization (ERE) is supposed to be a physical process which\nhappens after recombination, but before the instantaneous reionization caused\nby the first generation of stars. We investigate the effect of the ERE on the\ntemperature and polarization power spectra of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB), and adopt principal components analysis (PCA) to model-independently\nreconstruct the ionization history during the ERE. In addition, we also discuss\nhow the ERE affects the cosmological parameter estimates, and find that the ERE\ndoes not impose any significant influences on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$\nand the neutrino mass at the sensitivities of current experiments. The better\nCMB polarization data can be used to give a tighter constraint on the ERE and\nmight be important for more precisely constraining cosmological parameters in\nthe future.\n", "  We compare two different approaches for quantization of the Bianchi I model:\na reduced phase space quantization, in which the isotropic Misner variables is\ntaken as time, and the Vilenkin proposal, in which a semiclassical\napproximation is performed for the same variable. We outline the technical and\ninterpretative issues of these two methods and we demonstrate that they provide\nequivalent results only if the dynamics is essentially dictated by the\nisotropic matter contribution.\n", "  We present an argument which purports to show that the use of the standard\nLegendre transform in non-additive Statistical Mechanics is not appropriate.\nFor concreteness, we use as paradigm, the case of systems which are\nconjecturally described by the (non-additive) Tsallis entropy. We point out the\nform of the modified Legendre transform that should be used, instead, in the\nnon-additive thermodynamics induced by the Tsallis entropy. We comment on more\ngeneral implications of this proposal for the thermodynamics of \"complex\nsystems\".\n", "  We investigate the optical properties of InAs quantum dots grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy on GaAs(110) using Bi as a surfactant. The quantum dots are\nsynthesized on planar GaAs(110) substrates as well as on the {110} sidewall\nfacets of GaAs nanowires. At 10 K, neutral excitons confined in these quantum\ndots give rise to photoluminescence lines between 1.1 and 1.4 eV.\nMagneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals that for small quantum dots\nemitting between 1.3 and 1.4 eV, the electron-hole coherence length in and\nperpendicular to the (110) plane is on the order of 5 and 2 nm, respectively.\nThe quantum dot photoluminescence is linearly polarized, and both binding and\nantibinding biexcitons are observed, two findings that we associate with the\nstrain in the (110) plane This strain leads to piezoelectric fields and to a\nstrong mixing between heavy and light hole states, and offers the possibility\nto tune the degree of linear polarization of the exciton photoluminescence as\nwell as the sign of the binding energy of biexcitons.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of the bosonic string on AdS3 with H-flux at\nstringy scales, looking in particular for a `tensionless' limit in which there\nare massless higher spin gauge fields. We do this by revisiting the physical\nspectrum of the sl(2,R)$_k$ WZW model and considering the limit in which k\nbecomes small. At k=3 we find that there is an infinite stringy tower of\nmassless higher spin fields which are part of a continuum of light states. This\ncan be viewed as a novel tensionless limit, which appears to be distinct from\nthat inferred from the symmetric orbifold description of superstring AdS3\nvacua.\n", "  Following merger, a neutron star (NS) binary can produce roughly one of three\ndifferent outcomes: (1) a stable NS, (2) a black hole (BH), or (3) a\nsupra-massive, rotationally-supported NS, which then collapses to a BH\nfollowing angular momentum losses. Which of these fates occur and in what\nproportion has important implications for the electromagnetic transient\nassociated with the mergers and the expected gravitational wave signatures,\nwhich in turn depend on the high density equation of state (EOS). Here we\ncombine relativistic calculations of NS masses using realistic EOSs with Monte\nCarlo population synthesis based on the mass distribution of NS binaries in our\nGalaxy to predict the distribution of fates expected. For many EOSs, a\nsignificant fraction of the remnants are NSs or supra-massive NSs. This lends\nsupport to scenarios where a quickly spinning, highly magnetized NS may be\npowering an electromagnetic transient. This also indicates that it will be\nimportant for future gravitational wave (GW) observatories to focus on high\nfrequencies to study the post merger GW emission. Even in cases where\nindividual GW events are too low in signal to noise to study the post merger\nsignature in detail, the statistics of how many mergers produce NSs versus BHs\ncan be compared with our work to constrain the EOS. To match short gamma-ray\nburst (SGRB) X-ray afterglow statistics, we find that the stiffest EOSs are\nruled out. Furthermore, many popular EOSs require ~60-70% of SGRBs to be from\nNS-BH mergers rather than just binary NSs.\n", "  We compute the $\\mathcal S^p \\to \\mathcal S^p$ norm of a general Gaussian\ngauge-covariant multi-mode channel for any $1\\leq p<\\infty$, where $\\mathcal\nS^p$ is a Schatten space. As a consequence, we verify the Gaussian optimizer\nconjecture and the multiplicativity conjecture in these cases.\n", "  A Standard Model extension with two Majorana neutrinos can explain the\nmeasured neutrino masses and mixings, and also account for the\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry in a region of parameter space that could be\ntestable in future experiments. The testability of the model relies to some\nextent on its minimality. In this paper we address the possibility that the\nmodel might be extended by extra generic new physics which we parametrize in\nterms of a low-energy effective theory. We consider the effects of the\noperators of the lowest dimensionality, $d=5$, and evaluate the upper bounds on\nthe coefficients so that the predictions of the minimal model are robust. One\nof the operators gives a new production mechanism for the heavy neutrinos at\nLHC via higgs decays. The higgs can decay to a pair of such neutrinos that,\nbeing long-lived, leave a powerful signal of two displaced vertices. We\nestimate the LHC reach to this process.\n", "  We demonstrate a new approach to calibrating the spectral-spatial response of\na wide-field spectrograph using a fibre etalon comb. Conventional wide-field\ninstruments employed on front-line telescopes are mapped with a grid of\ndiffraction-limited holes cut into a focal plane mask. The aberrated grid\npattern in the image plane typically reveals n-symmetric (e.g. pincushion)\ndistortion patterns over the field arising from the optical train. This\napproach is impractical in the presence of a dispersing element because the\ndiffraction-limited spots in the focal plane are imaged as an array of\noverlapping spectra. Instead we propose a compact solution that builds on\nrecent developments in fibre-based Fabry-Perot etalons. We introduce a novel\napproach to near-field illumination that exploits a 25cm commercial telescope\nand the propagation of skew rays in a multimode fibre. The mapping of the\noptical transfer function across the full field is represented accurately\n(<0.5% rms residual) by an orthonormal set of Chebyshev moments. Thus we are\nable to reconstruct the full 4Kx4K CCD image of the dispersed output from the\noptical fibres using this mapping, as we demonstrate. Our method removes one of\nthe largest sources of systematic error in multi-object spectroscopy.\n", "  The flux flow properties of epitaxial niobium films with different pinning\nstrengths are investigated by dc electrical resistance measurements and mapped\nto results derived within the framework of a theoretical model. Investigated\nare the cases of weak random pinning in as-grown films, strong random pinning\nin Ga ion-irradiated films, and strong periodic pinning induced by a nanogroove\narray milled by focused ion beam. The generic feature of the current-voltage\ncurves of the films consists in instability jumps to the normal state at some\ninstability current density $j^\\ast$ as the vortex lattice reaches its critical\nvelocity $v^\\ast$. While $v^\\ast(B)$ monotonically decreases for as-grown\nfilms, the irradiated films exhibit a non-monotonic dependence $v^\\ast(B)$\nattaining a maximum in the low-field range. In the case of nanopatterned films,\nthis broad maximum is accompanied by a much sharper maximum in both,\n$v^\\ast(B)$ and $j^\\ast(B)$, which we attribute to the commensurability effect\nwhen the spacing between the vortex rows coincides with the location of the\ngrooves. We argue that the observed behavior of $v^\\ast(B)$ can be explained by\nthe pinning effect on the vortex flow instability and support our claims by\nfitting the experimental data to theoretical expressions derived within a model\naccounting for the field dependence of the depinning current density.\n", "  We investigate inflationary correlation functions in single field inflation\nmodels. We adopt a BRST formalism where locality and covariance at the\nsub-horizon scale are manifest. The scalar and tensor perturbations are\nidentified with those in the comoving gauge which become constant outside the\ncosmological horizon. Our construction reproduces the identical non-Gaussianity\nwith the standard comoving gauge. The accumulation of almost scale invariant\nfluctuations could give rise to IR logarithmic corrections at the loop level.\nWe investigate the influence of this effect on the sub-horizon dynamics. Since\nsuch an effect must respect covariance, our BRST gauge has an advantage over\nthe standard comoving gauge. We estimate IR logarithmic effects to the\nslow-roll parameters at the one-loop level. We show that $\\epsilon$ receives IR\nlogarithmic corrections, while this is not the case for $\\eta$. We point out\nthat IR logarithmic effects provide the shift symmetry breaking mechanism. This\nscenario may lead to an inflation model with a linear potential.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of Cold Electroweak Baryogenesis, including\nfor the first time in the Bosonic sector the full electroweak gauge group\nSU(2)$\\times$U(1) and CP-violation. We find that the maximum generated baryon\nasymmetry is reduced by a factor of three relative to the SU(2)-only model, but\nthat the quench time dependence is very similar. In addition, we compute the\nmagnitude of the helical magnetic fields, and find that it is proportional to\nthe strength of CP-violation and dependent on quench time, but is not\nproportional to the magnitude of the baryon asymmetry as proposed in the\nliterature. Astrophysical signatures of primordial magnetic helicity can\ntherefore not in general be used as evidence that electroweak baryogenesis has\ntaken place.\n", "  We optimize the pulse shape and polarization of time-dependent electric\nfields to maximize the production of electron-positron pairs via strong field\nquantum electrodynamics processes. The pulse is parametrized in Fourier space\nby a B-spline polynomial basis, which results in a relatively low-dimensional\nparameter space while still allowing for a large number of electric field\nmodes. The optimization is performed by using a parallel implementation of the\ndifferential evolution, one of the most efficient metaheuristic algorithms. The\ncomputational performance of the numerical method and the results on pair\nproduction are compared with a local multistart optimization algorithm. These\ntechniques allow us to determine the pulse shape and field polarization that\nmaximize the number of produced pairs in computationally accessible regimes.\n", "  We compute in the density-matrix formalism the baryon asymmetry generated by\nthe decay of the Higgs doublet into a right-handed (RH) neutrino and a Standard\nModel lepton. The emphasis is put on the baryon asymmetry produced by the total\nlepton-number violating decay. From the derivation of the corresponding\nevolution equations, and from their integration, we find that this contribution\nis fully relevant for large parts of the parameter space. This confirms the\nresults found recently in the CP-violating decay formalism with thermal\ncorrections and shows in particular that the lepton-number violating processes\nare important not only for high-scale leptogenesis but also when the\nRH-neutrino masses are in the GeV range. For large values of the Yukawa\ncouplings, we also find that the strong washout is generically much milder for\nthis total lepton-number violating part than for the usual RH-neutrino\noscillation flavour part.\n", "  AG Peg is known as the slowest symbiotic nova, which experienced its\nnova-like outburst around 1850. After 165 years, during June of 2015, it\nerupted again showing characteristics of the Z And-type outburst. The primary\nobjective is to determine basic characteristics, the nature and type of the\n2015 outburst of AG Peg. We achieved this aim by modelling the spectral energy\ndistribution using low-resolution spectroscopy (330-750 nm), medium-resolution\nspectroscopy (420-720 nm; R=11000), and $UBVR_{\\rm C}I_{\\rm C}$ photometry\ncovering the 2015 outburst with a high cadence. Optical observations were\ncomplemented with the archival HST and FUSE spectra from the preceding\nquiescence. During the outburst, the luminosity of the hot component was in the\nrange of 2-11$\\times 10^{37}(d/0.8{\\rm kpc})^2$ erg/s. To generate the maximum\nluminosity the white dwarf (WD) had to accrete at $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-7}$\nM$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$, which exceeds the stable-burning limit and thus led to\nblowing optically thick wind from the WD. We determined its mass-loss rate to a\nfew $\\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$. At the high temperature of the\nionising source, $1.5-2.3\\times 10^5$ K, the wind converted a fraction of the\nWD's photospheric radiation into the nebular emission that dominated the\noptical. A one order of magnitude increase of the emission measure, from a few\n$\\times 10^{59}(d/0.8 {\\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during quiescence, to a few\n$\\times 10^{60}(d/0.8\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during the outburst, caused a 2\nmag brightening in the LC, which is classified as the Z And-type of the\noutburst. The very high nebular emission and the presence of a disk-like HI\nregion encompassing the WD, as indicated by a significant broadening and high\nflux of the Raman-scattered OVI 6825 \\AA\\ line during the outburst, is\nconsistent with the ionisation structure of hot components in symbiotic stars\nduring active phases.\n", "  Condensed-matter analogs of the Higgs boson in particle physics allow\ninsights into its behavior in different symmetries and dimensionalities.\nEvidence for the Higgs mode has been reported in a number of different\nsettings, including ultracold atomic gases, disordered superconductors, and\ndimerized quantum magnets. However, decay processes of the Higgs mode (which\nare eminently important in particle physics) have not yet been studied in\ncondensed matter due to the lack of a suitable material system coupled to a\ndirect experimental probe. A quantitative understanding of these processes is\nparticularly important for low-dimensional systems where the Higgs mode decays\nrapidly and has remained elusive to most experimental probes. Here, we discover\nand study the Higgs mode in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet using\nspin-polarized inelastic neutron scattering. Our spin-wave spectra of\nCa$_2$RuO$_4$ directly reveal a well-defined, dispersive Higgs mode, which\nquickly decays into transverse Goldstone modes at the antiferromagnetic\nordering wavevector. Through a complete mapping of the transverse modes in the\nreciprocal space, we uniquely specify the minimal model Hamiltonian and\ndescribe the decay process. We thus establish a novel condensed matter platform\nfor research on the dynamics of the Higgs mode.\n", "  The LUX experiment has recently set very strong constraints on\nspin-independent interactions of WIMP with nuclei. These null results can be\naccommodated in NMSSM provided that the effective spin-independent coupling of\nthe LSP to nucleons is suppressed. We investigate thermal relic abundance of\nsinglino-higgsino LSP in these so-called spin-independent blind spots and\nderive current constraints and prospects for direct detection of spin-dependent\ninteractions of the LSP with nuclei providing strong constraints on parameter\nspace. We show that if the Higgs boson is the only light scalar the new LUX\nconstraints set a lower bound on the LSP mass of about 300 GeV except for a\nsmall range around the half of $Z^0$ boson masses where resonant annihilation\nvia $Z^0$ exchange dominates. XENON1T will probe entire range of LSP masses\nexcept for a tiny $Z^0$-resonant region that may be tested by the LZ\nexperiment. These conclusions apply to general singlet-doublet dark matter\nannihilating dominantly to $t\\bar{t}$. Presence of light singlet\n(pseudo)scalars generically relaxes the constraints because new LSP (resonant\nand non-resonant) annihilation channels become important. Even away from\nresonant regions, the lower limit on the LSP mass from LUX is relaxed to about\n250 GeV while XENON1T may not be sensitive to the LSP masses above about 400\nGeV.\n", "  We present a microscopic calculation of alpha-cluster formation in heavy\nnuclei by using the quartetting wave function approach. The interaction of the\nquartet with the core nucleus is taken in local density approximation. The\nalpha-cluster formation is found to be particularly sensitive to the interplay\nof the mean field felt by the alpha-cluster and the Pauli blocking as a\nconsequence of antisymmetrization. The striking feature of alpha-cluster\nformation probability across the major shell closures of 82 protons and 126\nneutrons is reproduced. The shell (or subshell) effects on the alpha-cluster\nformation in superheavy nuclei are also analyzed.\n", "  We study the time-dependent fluorescence of an initially hot, multi-level,\nsingle atomic ion trapped in a radio-frequency Paul trap during Doppler\ncooling. We have developed an analytical model that describes the fluorescence\ndynamics during Doppler cooling which is used to extract the initial energy of\nthe ion. While previous models of Doppler cooling thermometry were limited to\natoms with a two-level energy structure and neglected the effect of the trap\noscillating electric fields, our model applies to atoms with multi-level energy\nstructure and takes into account the influence of micromotion on the cooling\ndynamics. This thermometry applies to any initial energy distribution. We\nexperimentally test our model with an ion prepared in a coherent, thermal and\nTsallis energy distributions.\n", "  We present an analysis of the properties of neutral hydrogen (HI) in 248\nnearby (0.02<z<0.25) radio galaxies with $S_{\\rm 1.4\\, GHz}>30$ mJy and for\nwhich optical spectroscopy is available. The observations were carried out with\nthe Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope as the last large project before the\nupgrade of the telescope with phased array feed receivers (Apertif). The sample\ncovers almost four orders of magnitude in radio power from $\\log\\,P_{\\rm 1.4\n\\,GHz}=22.5$ W Hz$^{-1}$ and $26.2$ W Hz$^{-1}$. We detect HI in absorption in\n$27\\% \\pm 5.5\\%$ of the objects. The distribution and kinematics of the\nabsorbing HI gas appear to depend on radio power, the properties of the radio\ncontinuum emission, and the dust content of the sources. Among the sources\nwhere HI is detected, gas with kinematics deviating from regular rotation is\nmore likely found as the radio power increases. In these cases, the HI profile\nis often asymmetric with a significant blue-shifted component. This is\nparticularly common for sources with $\\log\\,P_{\\rm 1.4 \\, GHz}>24$ W Hz$^{-1}$,\nwhere the radio emission is small, possibly because these radio sources are\nyoung. The same is found for sources that are bright in the mid-infrared, i.e.\nsources rich in heated dust. In these sources, the HI is outflowing likely\nunder the effect of the interaction with the radio emission. Conversely, in\ndust-poor galaxies, and in sources with extended radio emission, at all radio\npowers we only detect HI distributed in a rotating disk. Stacking experiments\nshow that in sources for which we do not detect HI in absorption directly, the\nHI has a column density that is lower than $3.5\\times 10^{17} (T_{ \\rm\nspin}/c_f)$ cm$^{-2}$. We use our results to predict the number and type of HI\nabsorption lines that will be detected by the upcoming surveys of the Square\nKilometre Array precursors and pathfinders (Apertif, MeerKAT, and ASKAP).\n", "  Understanding the nature of bulges in disc galaxies can provide important\ninsights into the formation and evolution of galaxies. For instance, the\npresence of a classical bulge suggests a relatively violent history, in\ncontrast, the presence of simply an inner disc (also referred to as a\n\"pseudobulge\") indicates the occurrence of secular evolution processes in the\nmain disc. However, we still lack criteria to effectively categorise bulges,\nlimiting our ability to study their impact on the evolution of the host\ngalaxies. Here we present a recipe to separate inner discs from classical\nbulges by combining four different parameters from photometric and kinematic\nanalyses: The bulge S\\'ersic index $n_\\mathrm{b}$, the concentration index\n$C_{20,50}$, the Kormendy (1977) relation and the inner slope of the radial\nvelocity dispersion profile $\\nabla\\sigma$. With that recipe we provide a\ndetailed bulge classification for a sample of 45 galaxies from the\nintegral-field spectroscopic survey CALIFA. To aid in categorising bulges\nwithin these galaxies, we perform 2D image decomposition to determine bulge\nS\\'ersic index, bulge-to-total light ratio, surface brightness and effective\nradius of the bulge and use growth curve analysis to derive a new concentration\nindex, $C_{20,50}$. We further extract the stellar kinematics from CALIFA data\ncubes and analyse the radial velocity dispersion profile. The results of the\ndifferent approaches are in good agreement and allow a safe classification for\napproximately $95\\%$ of the galaxies. In particular, we show that our new\n\"inner\" concentration index performs considerably better than the traditionally\nused $C_{50,90}$ when yielding the nature of bulges. We also found that a\ncombined use of this index and the Kormendy (1977) relation gives a very robust\nindication of the physical nature of the bulge.\n", "  When a main sequence star undergoes Roche lobe overflow onto a supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH) in a circular extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI), a phase of\nsteady mass transfer ensues. Over millions of years, the binary evolves to a\nperiod minimum before reversing course and migrating outwards. Because the time\ninterval between consecutive EMRIs is comparable to the mass-transfer\ntimescale, the semi-major axes of two consecutive mass-transferring EMRIs will\ncross on a radial scale < few AU. We show that such EMRI crossing events are\ninevitably accompanied by a series of mildly relativistic, grazing physical\ncollisions between the stars. Each collision strips a small quantity of mass,\nprimarily from the more massive star, which generally increases their radial\nseparation to set up the next collision after a delay of decades to centuries\n(or longer) set by further gravitational radiation. Depending on the mass of\nthe SMBH, this interaction can result in N ~ 1-1e4 gas production events of\nmass Msun/N, thus powering a quasi-periodic sequence of SMBH accretion-powered\nflares over a total duration of thousands of years or longer. Although the EMRI\nrate is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of tidal disruption events\n(TDE), the ability of a single interacting EMRI pair to produce a large number\nof luminous flares - and to make more judicious use of the available stellar\nfuel - could make their observed rate competitive with the TDE rate, enabling\nthem to masquerade as \"TDE Imposters.\" We predict flares with luminosities that\ndecay both as power laws shallower than t^(-5/3) or as decaying exponentials.\nViscous spreading of the gas disks produced by the accumulation of previous\nmass-stripping events places substantial mass on radial scales > 10-100 AU,\nproviding a reprocessing source required to explain the unexpectedly high\noptical luminosities of some flares.\n", "  A trapped ion transported along a periodic potential is studied as a\nparadigmatic nanocontact frictional interface. The combination of the periodic\ncorrugation potential and a harmonic trapping potential creates a\none-dimensional energy landscape with multiple local minima, corresponding to\nmultistable stick-slip friction. We measure the probabilities of slipping to\nthe various minima for various corrugations and transport velocities. The\nobserved probabilities show that the multislip regime can be reached\ndynamically at smaller corrugations than would be possible statically, and can\nbe described by an equilibrium Boltzmann model. While a clear microscopic\nsignature of multislip behavior is observed for the ion motion, the frictional\nforce and dissipation are only weakly affected by the transition to multistable\npotentials.\n", "  It is shown that the closure of the infinitesimal symmetry transformations\nunderlying classical ${\\cal W}$ algebras give rise to L$_\\infty$ algebras with\nin general field dependent gauge parameters. Therefore, the class of well\nunderstood ${\\cal W}$ algebras provides highly non-trivial examples of such\nstrong homotopy Lie-algebras. We develop the general formalism for this\ncorrespondence and apply it explicitly to the classical ${\\cal W}_3$ algebra.\n", "  We have studied neutrinoless double beta decay and charged lepton flavour\nviolation in broken $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetric neutrino masses in a generic\nleft-right symmetric model (LRSM). The leading order $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetric mass\nmatrix originates from the type I (II) seesaw mechanism, whereas the\nperturbations to $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry in order for generation of non-zero\nreactor mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$, as required by latest neutrino oscillation\ndata, originates from the type II (I) seesaw mechanism. In our work, we\nconsidered four different realizations of $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry, viz.\nTribimaximal Mixing (TBM), Bimaximal Mixing (BM), Hexagonal Mixing (HM) and\nGolden Ratio Mixing (GRM). We then studied the new physics contributions to\nneutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD) ignoring the left-right gauge boson\nmixing and the heavy-light neutrino mixing within the framework of LRSM. We\nhave considered the mass of the gauge bosons and scalars to be around TeV and\nstudied the effects of the new physics contributions on the effective mass and\nthe NDBD half life and compared with the current experimental limit imposed by\nKamLAND-Zen. We further extended our analysis by correlating the lepton flavour\nviolation of the decay processes, $\\left(\\mu\\rightarrow 3e\\right)$ and\n$\\left(\\mu\\rightarrow e\\gamma\\right)$ with the lightest neutrino mass and\natmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ respectively.\n", "  We experimentally realized an optical nanofiber-based cavity by combining a\n1-D photonic crystal and Bragg grating structures. The cavity morphology\ncomprises a periodic, triplex air-cube introduced at the waist of the\nnanofiber. The cavity has been theoretically characterized using FDTD\nsimulations to obtain the reflection and transmission spectra. We have also\nexperimentally measured the transmission spectra and a Q-factor of ~784(87) for\na very short periodic structure has been observed. The structure provides\nstrong confinement of the cavity field and its potential for optical network\nintegration makes it an ideal candidate for use in nanophotonic and quantum\ninformation systems.\n", "  Non-Markovian effects arising in open quantum systems evolution have been a\nsubject of increasing interest over the past decade. One of the most appealing\nfeatures of non-Markovianity (NM) is that it captures scenarios where loss of\ninformation and coherence are reversible, and thus a temporary backflow of\ninformation from the environment to the system is possible. In this work we\nstudy the interplay between the degree of non-Markovianity and the action of\ntime-dependent control fields in an open two-level quantum system. We find that\nperiodical modulation of a field acting solely on the system can greatly\nenhance the degree of non-Markovianity with respect to the undriven case. We\nshow that this effect is present only when the coupling between system and\nenvironment is weak. Remarkably, the enhancement disappears at strong coupling,\nwhich is usually the regime where non-Markovian effects are expected to be more\npronounced.\n", "  Many cells exploit the bending or rotation of flagellar filaments in order to\nself-propel in viscous fluids. While appropriate theoretical modelling is\navailable to capture flagella locomotion in simple, Newtonian fluids,\nformidable computations are required to address theoretically their locomotion\nin complex, nonlinear fluids, e.g.~mucus. Based on experimental measurements\nfor the motion of rigid rods in non-Newtonian fluids and on the classical\nCarreau fluid model, we propose empirical extensions of the classical Newtonian\nresistive-force theory to model the waving of slender filaments in\nnon-Newtonian fluids. By assuming the flow near the flagellum to be locally\nNewtonian, we propose a self-consistent way to estimate the typical shear-rate\nin the fluid, which we then use to construct correction factors to the\nNewtonian local drag coefficients. The resulting non-Newtonian resistive-force\ntheory, while empirical, is consistent with the Newtonian limit, and with the\nexperiments. We then use our models to address waving locomotion in\nnon-Newtonian fluids, and show that the resulting swimming speeds are\nsystematically lowered -- a result which we are able to capture asymptotically\nand to interpret physically. An application of the models to recent\nexperimental results on the locomotion of Caenorhabditis elegans in polymeric\nsolutions shows reasonable agreement and thus captures the main physics of\nswimming in shear-thinning fluids.\n", "  The uncertainty relations, pioneered by Werner Heisenberg nearly 90 years\nago, set a fundamental limitation on the joint measurability of complementary\nobservables. This limitation has long been a subject of debate, which has been\nreignited recently due to new proposed forms of measurement uncertainty\nrelations. The present work is associated with a new error trade-off relation\nfor compatible observables approximating two incompatible observables, in\nkeeping with the spirit of Heisenberg's original ideas of 1927. We report the\nfirst \\textsl{direct} test and confirmation of the tight bounds prescribed by\nsuch an error trade-off relation, based on an experimental realisation of\noptimal joint measurements of complementary observables using a single\nultracold $^{40}Ca^{+}$ ion trapped in a harmonic potential. Our work provides\na prototypical determination of ultimate joint measurement error bounds with\npotential applications in quantum information science for high-precision\nmeasurement and information security.\n", "  The gain of free energy upon unmixing is determined via application of Markov\nstate modeling (MSM), using an Ising model with a fixed number of up- and\ndown-spins. MSM yields reasonable estimates of the free energies. However, a\ncloser look reveals significant differences which point to residual\nnon-Markovian effects. These non-Markovian effects are rather unexpected since\nthe typical criteria to study the quality of Markovianity indicate complete\nMarkovian behavior. We identify the sparse connectivity between different\nMarkov states as a likely reason for the observed bias. By studying a simple\nfive state model system we can analytically elucidate different sources of the\nbias and thus explain the different deviations that were observed for the Ising\nmodel. Based on this insight we can modify the determination of the count\nmatrix in the MSM approach. In this way, the estimation of the free energy is\nsignificantly improved.\n", "  We investigate a new type of a two-Higgs-doublet model as a solution of the\nmuon $g-2$ anomaly. We impose a softly-broken $Z_4$ symmetry to forbid tree\nlevel flavor changing neutral currents in a natural way. This $Z_4$ symmetry\nrestricts the structure of Yukawa couplings. As a result, extra Higgs boson\ncouplings to muons are enhanced by a factor of $\\tan\\beta$, while their\ncouplings to all the other standard model fermions are suppressed by\n$\\cot\\beta$. Thanks to this coupling property, we can avoid the constraint from\nleptonic $\\tau$ decays in contrast to the lepton specific two-Higgs-doublet\nmodel, which can explain the muon $g-2$ within the 2$\\sigma$ level but cannot\nwithin the $1\\sigma$ level due to this constraint. We find that the model can\nexplain the muon $g-2$ within the 1$\\sigma$ level satisfying constraints from\nperturbative unitarity, vacuum stability, electroweak precision measurements,\nand current LHC data.\n", "  We discuss the generation of small neutrino masses from d=7 1-loop diagrams.\nWe first systematically analyze all possible d=7 1-loop topologies. There is a\ntotal of 48 topologies, but only 8 of these can lead to \"genuine\" d=7 neutrino\nmasses. Here, we define genuine models to be models in which neither d=5 nor\nd=7 tree-level masses nor a d=5 1-loop mass appear, such that the d=7 1-loop is\nthe leading order contribution to the neutrino masses. All genuine models can\nthen be organized w.r.t. their particle content. We find there is only one\ndiagram with no representation larger than triplet, while there are 22 diagrams\nwith quadruplets. We briefly discuss three minimal example models of this kind.\n", "  In this work we propose a non-perturbative approximation to the electronic\nstopping power based on the central screened potential of a projectile moving\nin a free electron gas, by Nagy and Apagyi. We used this model to evaluate the\nenergy loss of protons and antiprotons in ten solid targets: Cr, C, Ni, Be, Ti,\nSi, Al, Ge, Pb, Li and Rb. They were chosen as canonicals because they have\nreliable values of the Seitz radio, rS=1.48-5.31 a.u., which cover most of the\npossible metallic solids. Present low velocity results agree well with the\nexperimental data for both proton and antiproton impact. Our formalism\ndescribes the binary collision of the projectile and one electron of the free\nelectron gas. It does not include the collective or plasmon excitations, which\nare important in the intermediate to high velocity regime. The distinguishing\nfeature of this contribution is that by using the present model for low to\nintermediate energies (below the appearance of plasmon excitations), the\nLindhard dielectric formalism (including plasmons) for intermediate to high\nenergies, and the shellwise local plasma approximation to account for the inner\nshell contribution, then a good full-theoretical description of the available\nexperimental data is obtained in an extensive energy range, covering the low,\nintermediate and high energy region.\n", "  The methodology of the heterotic mini-landscape attempts to zero in on\nphenomenologically viable corners of the string landscape where the effective\nlow energy theory is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with localized\ngrand unification. The gaugino mass pattern is that of mirage-mediation. The\nmagnitudes of various SM Yukawa couplings point to a picture where scalar soft\nSUSY breaking terms are related to the geography of fields in the compactified\ndimensions. Higgs fields and third generation scalars extend to the bulk and\noccur in split multiplets with TeV scale soft masses. First and second\ngeneration scalars, localized at orbifold fixed points or tori with enhanced\nsymmetry, occur in complete GUT multiplets and have much larger masses. This\npicture can be matched onto the parameter space of generalized mirage\nmediation. Naturalness considerations, the requirement of the observed\nelectroweak symmetry breaking pattern, and LHC bounds on m(gluino) together\nlimit the gravitino mass to the m_{3/2}~ 5-60 TeV range. The mirage unification\nscale is bounded from below with the limit depending on the ratio of squark to\ngravitino masses. We show that while natural SUSY in this realization may\nescape detection even at the high luminosity LHC, the high energy LHC with\n\\sqrt{s}=33 TeV could unequivocally confirm or exclude this scenario. It should\nbe possible to detect the expected light higgsinos at the ILC if these are\nkinematically accessible, and possibly also discriminate the expected\ncompression of gaugino masses in the natural mini-landscape picture from the\nmass pattern expected in models with gaugino mass unification. The thermal WIMP\nsignal should be accessible via direct detection searches at the multi-ton\nnoble liquid detectors such as Xenon-nT or LZ.\n", "  We describe a new Large Program in progress on the Gemini North and South\ntelescopes: Gemini Observations of Galaxies in Rich Early Environments\n(GOGREEN). This is an imaging and deep spectroscopic survey of 21 galaxy\nsystems at $1<z<1.5$, selected to span a factor $>10$ in halo mass. The\nscientific objectives include measuring the role of environment in the\nevolution of low-mass galaxies, and measuring the dynamics and stellar contents\nof their host haloes. The targets are selected from the SpARCS, SPT, COSMOS and\nSXDS surveys, to be the evolutionary counterparts of today's clusters and\ngroups. The new red-sensitive Hamamatsu detectors on GMOS, coupled with the\nnod-and-shuffle sky subtraction, allow simultaneous wavelength coverage over\n$\\lambda\\sim 0.6$--$1.05\\mu$m, and this enables a homogeneous and statistically\ncomplete redshift survey of galaxies of all types. The spectroscopic sample\ntargets galaxies with AB magnitudes $z^{\\prime}<24.25$ and [3.6]$\\mu$m$<22.5$,\nand is therefore statistically complete for stellar masses\n$M_\\ast\\gtrsim10^{10.3}M_\\odot$, for all galaxy types and over the entire\nredshift range. Deep, multiwavelength imaging has been acquired over larger\nfields for most systems, spanning $u$ through $K$, in addition to deep IRAC\nimaging at 3.6$\\mu$m. The spectroscopy is $\\sim 50$ per cent complete as of\nsemester 17A, and we anticipate a final sample of $\\sim 500$ new cluster\nmembers. Combined with existing spectroscopy on the brighter galaxies from\nGCLASS, SPT and other sources, GOGREEN will be a large legacy cluster and field\ngalaxy sample at this redshift that spectroscopically covers a wide range in\nstellar mass, halo mass, and clustercentric radius.\n", "  Present-day clusters are massive halos containing mostly quiescent galaxies,\nwhile distant protoclusters are extended structures containing numerous\nstar-forming galaxies. We investigate the implications of this fundamental\nchange in a cosmological context using a set of N-body simulations and\nsemi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied\nby all (proto)clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z=0\nto z=7. We show that (proto)cluster galaxies are an important, and even\ndominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the\ncosmic star-formation rate density rises (from 1% at z=0) to 20% at z=2 and 50%\nat z=10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic\nionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology\nof cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation\ncan be described by three distinct phases: at z~10-5, galaxy growth in\nprotoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos\nthat are among the most active regions in the Universe; at z~5-1.5, rapid star\nformation occurred within the entire 10-20 Mpc structures, forming most of\ntheir present-day stellar mass; at z<~1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove\nthese stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details\nof cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results\nmotivate observations of distant protoclusters in order to understand the\nrapid, extended stellar growth during Cosmic Noon, and their connection to\nreionization during Cosmic Dawn.\n", "  We report on new JVLA observations performed at 3 GHz and 5.5 GHz of Abell\n2626. The cluster has been the object of several studies in the recent years\ndue to its peculiar radio emission, which shows a complex system of symmetric\nradio arcs characterized by a steep spectrum. The origin of these radio sources\nis still unclear. Due to their mirror symmetry toward the center, it has been\nproposed that they may be created by pairs of precessing jets powered by the\ninner AGN. The new JVLA observations were requested with the specific aim of\ndetecting extended emission on frequencies higher than 1.4 GHz, in order to\nconstrain the jet-precession model by analyzing the spectral index and\nradiative age patterns alongs the arcs. We performed a standard data reduction\nof the JVLA datasets with the software CASA. By combining the new 3 GHz data\nwith the archival 1.4 GHz VLA dataset we produced a spectral index maps of the\nextended emission, and then we estimated the radiative age of the arcs by\nassuming that the plasma was accelerated in moving hot-spots tracing the arcs.\nThanks to the high sensitivity of the JVLA, we achieve the detection of the\narcs at 3 GHz and extended emission at 5.5 GHz. We measure a mean spectral\nindex <-2.5 for the arcs up to 3 GHz. No clear spectral index, or radiative\nage, trend is detected across the arcs which may challenge the interpretation\nbased on precession or put strong constraints on the jet-precession period. In\nparticular, by analyzing the radiative age distribution along the arcs, we were\nable to provide for the first time a time-scale < 26 Myr of the jet-precession\nperiod.\n", "  We propose a modification of the Skyrme model that supports a self-dual\nsector possessing exact non-trivial finite energy solutions. The action of such\na theory possesses the usual quadratic and quartic terms in field derivatives,\nbut the couplings of the components of the Maurer-Cartan form of the Skyrme\nmodel is made by a non-constant symmetric matrix, instead of the usual Killing\nform of the SU(2) Lie algebra. The introduction of such a matrix make the\nself-duality equations conformally invariant in three space dimensions, even\nthough it may break the global internal symmetries of the original Skyrme\nmodel. For the case where that matrix is proportional to the identity we show\nthat the theory possesses exact self-dual Skyrmions of unity topological\ncharges.\n", "  We consider 5-dimensional gauged supergravity coupled to Abelian vector\nmultiplets, and we look for supersymmetric solutions for which the\n4-dimensional K\\\"ahler base space admits a holomorphic isometry. Taking\nadvantage of this isometry, we are able to find several supersymmetric\nsolutions for the ST$[2,n_v+1]$ special geometric model with arbitrarily many\nvector multiplets. Among these there are three families of solutions with\n$n_v+2$ independent parameters, which for one of the families can be seen to\ncorrespond to $n_v+1$ electric charges and one angular momentum. These\nsolutions generalize the ones recently found for minimal gauged supergravity in\nJHEP 1704 (2017) 017 and include in particular the general supersymmetric\nasymptotically-AdS$_5$ black holes of Gutowski and Reall, analogous black hole\nsolutions with non-compact horizon, the three near horizon geometries\nthemselves, and the singular static solutions of Behrndt, Chamseddine and\nSabra.\n", "  We calculate the higher-twist corrections to the QCD light-cone sum rule for\nthe $B \\to \\pi$ transition form factor. The light-cone expansion of the massive\nquark propagator in the external gluonic field is extended to include new terms\ncontaining the derivatives of gluon-field strength. The resulting analytical\nexpressions for the twist-5 and twist-6 contributions to the correlation\nfunction are obtained in a factorized approximation, expressed via the product\nof the lower-twist pion distribution amplitudes and the quark-condensate\ndensity. The numerical analysis reveals that new higher-twist effects for the\n$B \\to \\pi$ form factor are strongly suppressed. This result justifies the\nconventional truncation of the operator product expansion in the light-cone sum\nrules up to twist-4 terms.\n", "  Carotenoids can play multiple roles in biological photoreceptors thanks to\ntheir rich photophysics. In the present work, we have investigated six of the\nmost common carbonyl containing carotenoids: Echinenone, Canthaxanthin,\nAstaxanthin, Fucoxanthin, Capsanthin and Capsorubin. Their excitation\nproperties are investigated by means of a hybrid density functional theory\n(DFT) and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach to elucidate\nthe role of the carbonyl group: the bright transition is of {\\pi}{\\pi}*\ncharacter, as expected, but the presence of a C=O moiety reduces the energy of\nn{\\pi}* transitions which may become closer to the {\\pi}{\\pi}* transition, in\nparticular as the conjugation chain decreases. This can be related to the\npresence of a low-lying charge transfer state typical of short carbonyl-\ncontaining carotenoids. The DFT/MRCI results are finally used to benchmark\nsingle- reference time-dependent DFT-based methods: among the investigated\nfunctionals, the meta- GGA (and in particular M11L and MN12L) functionals show\nto perform the best for all six investigated systems.\n", "  The close interplay between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in\nseveral quantum materials can lead to the appearance of an unusual\nthermodynamic state in which both orders coexist microscopically, despite their\ncompeting nature. A hallmark of this coexistence state is the emergence of a\nspin-triplet superconducting gap component, called $\\pi$-triplet, which is\nspatially modulated by the antiferromagnetic wave-vector, reminiscent of a\npair-density wave. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these\n$\\pi$-triplet degrees of freedom on the phase diagram of a system with\ncompeting antiferromagnetic and superconducting orders. Although we focus on a\nmicroscopic two-band model that has been widely employed in studies of iron\npnictides, most of our results follow from a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, and as\nsuch should be applicable to other systems of interest, such as cuprates and\nheavy fermions. The Ginzburg-Landau functional reveals not only that the\n$\\pi$-triplet gap amplitude couples tri-linearly with the singlet gap amplitude\nand the staggered magnetization magnitude, but also that the $\\pi$-triplet\n$d$-vector couples linearly with the magnetization direction. While in the mean\nfield level this coupling forces the $d$-vector to align parallel or\nanti-parallel to the magnetization, in the fluctuation regime it promotes two\nadditional collective modes - a Goldstone mode related to the precession of the\n$d$-vector around the magnetization and a massive mode, related to the relative\nangle between the two vectors, which is nearly degenerate with a Leggett-like\nmode associated with the phase difference between the singlet and triplet gaps.\nWe also investigate the impact of magnetic fluctuations on the\nsuperconducting-antiferromagnetic phase diagram, showing that due to their\ncoupling with the $\\pi$-triplet order parameter, the coexistence region is\nenhanced.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing gives access to the total mass distribution of\ngalaxies. It can unveil a great deal of information about the lenses dark\nmatter content when combined with the study of the lenses light profile.\nHowever, gravitational lensing galaxies, by definition, appear surrounded by\npoint-like and diffuse lensed signal that is irrelevant to the lens flux.\nTherefore, the observer is most often restricted to studying the innermost\nportions of the galaxy, where classical fitting methods show some\ninstabilities. We aim at subtracting that lensed signal and at characterising\nsome lenses light profile by computing their shape parameters. Our objective is\nto evaluate the total integrated flux in an aperture the size of the Einstein\nring in order to obtain a robust estimate of the quantity of ordinary matter in\neach system. We are expanding the work we started in a previous paper that\nconsisted in subtracting point-like lensed images and in independently\nmeasuring each shape parameter. We improve it by designing a subtraction of the\ndiffuse lensed signal, based only on one simple hypothesis of symmetry. This\nextra step improves our study of the shape parameters and we refine it even\nmore by upgrading our half-light radius measurement. We also calculate the\nimpact of our specific image processing on the error bars. The diffuse lensed\nsignal subtraction makes it possible to study a larger portion of relevant\ngalactic flux, as the radius of the fitting region increases by on average\n17\\%. We retrieve new half-light radii values that are on average 11\\% smaller\nthan in our previous work, although the uncertainties overlap in most cases.\nThis shows that not taking the diffuse lensed signal into account may lead to a\nsignificant overestimate of the half-light radius. We are also able to measure\nthe flux within the Einstein radius and to compute secure error bars to all of\nour results.\n", "  Potentially-habitable planets orbiting M-dwarfs are of intense\nastrobiological interest because they are the only rocky worlds accessible to\nbiosignature search over the next 10+ years due to a confluence of\nobservational effects. Simultaneously, recent experimental and theoretical work\nsuggests that UV light may have played a key role in the origin of life on\nEarth, and especially the origin of RNA. Characterizing the UV environment on\nM-dwarfs planets is important to understanding whether life as we know it could\nemerge on such worlds. In this work, we couple radiative transfer models to\nobserved M-dwarf spectra to determine the UV environment on prebiotic\nEarth-analog planets orbiting M-dwarfs. We calculate dose rates to quantify the\nimpact of different host stars on prebiotically-important photoprocesses. We\nfind that M-dwarf planets have access to 100-1000 times less bioactive UV\nfluence than the young Earth. It is unclear whether UV-sensitive prebiotic\nchemistry that may have been important to abiogenesis, such as the only known\nprebiotically plausible pathways for pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis, could\nfunction on M-dwarf planets. This uncertainty affects objects like the\nrecently-discovered habitable-zone planets orbiting Proxima Centauri,\nTRAPPIST-1, and LHS 1140. Laboratory studies of the sensitivity of putative\nprebiotic pathways to irradiation level are required to resolve this\nuncertainty. If steady-state M-dwarf UV output is insufficient to power these\npathways, transient elevated UV irradiation due to flares may suffice;\nlaboratory studies can constrain this possibility as well.\n", "  We consider the pressure in the steady-state regime of three stochastic\nmodels characterized by self-propulsion and persistent motion and widely\nemployed to describe the behavior of active particles, namely the Active\nBrownian particle (ABP) model, the Gaussian colored noise (GCN) model and the\nunified colored noise model (UCNA). Whereas in the limit of short but finite\npersistence time the pressure in the UCNA model can be obtained by different\nmethods which have an analog in equilibrium systems, in the remaining two\nmodels only the virial route is, in general, possible.\n  According to this method, notwithstanding each model obeys its own specific\nmicroscopic law of evolution, the pressure displays a certain universal\nbehavior. For generic interparticle and confining potentials, we derive a\nformula which establishes a correspondence between the GCN and the UCNA\npressures. In order to provide explicit formulas and examples, we specialize\nthe discussion to the case of an assembly of elastic dumbbells confined to a\nparabolic well. By employing the UCNA we find that, for this model, the\npressure determined by the thermodynamic method coincides with the pressures\nobtained by the virial and mechanical methods. The three methods when applied\nto the GCN give a pressure identical to that obtained via the UCNA. Finally, we\nfind that the ABP virial pressure exactly agrees with the UCNA and GCN result.\n", "  We consider supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with a\nvector-like doublet $(T \\, B)$ of quarks with charge $2/3$ and $-1/3$,\nrespectively. Compared to non-supersymmetric models, there is a variety of new\ndecay modes for the vector-like quarks, involving the extra scalars present in\nsupersymmetry. The importance of these new modes, yielding multi-top,\nmulti-bottom and also multi-Higgs signals, is highlighted by the analysis of\nseveral benchmark scenarios. We show how the triangles commonly used to\nrepresent the branching ratios of the `standard' decay modes of the vector-like\nquarks involving $W$, $Z$ or Higgs bosons can be generalised to include\nadditional channels. We give an example by recasting the limits of a recent\nheavy quark search for this more general case.\n", "  Motivated by $\\alpha$-attractor models, in this paper we consider a\nGauss-Bonnet inflation with E-model type of potential. We consider the\nGauss-Bonnet coupling function to be the same as the E-model potential. In the\nsmall $\\alpha$ limit we obtain an attractor at $r=0$ as expected, and in the\nlarge $\\alpha$ limit we recover the Gauss-Bonnet model with potential and\ncoupling function of the form $\\phi^{2n}$. We study perturbations and\nnon-Gaussianity in this setup and we find some constraints on the model's\nparameters in comparison with PLANCK datasets. We study also the reheating\nepoch after inflation in this setup. For this purpose, we seek the number of\ne-folds and temperature during reheating epoch. These quantities depend on the\nmodel's parameter and the effective equation of state of the dominating energy\ndensity in the reheating era. We find some observational constraints on these\nparameters.\n", "  We present HST WFC3 F160W imaging and infrared spectral energy distributions\nfor twelve extremely luminous, obscured AGN at $1.8<z<2.7$, selected via \"Hot,\nDust Obscured\" mid-infrared colors. Their infrared luminosities span\n$2-15\\times10^{13}$L$_{\\odot}$, making them among the most luminous objects in\nthe Universe at $z\\sim2$. In all cases the infrared emission is consistent with\narising at least in most part from AGN activity. The AGN fractional\nluminosities are higher than those in either sub-millimeter galaxies, or AGN\nselected via other mid-infrared criteria. Adopting the $G$, M$_{20}$ and $A$\nmorphological parameters, together with traditional classification boundaries,\ninfers that three quarters of the sample as mergers. Our sample do not,\nhowever, show any correlation between the considered morphological parameters\nand either infrared luminosity or AGN fractional luminosity. Moreover, their\nasymmetries and effective radii are distributed identically to those of massive\ngalaxies at $z\\sim2$. We conclude that our sample is not preferentially\nassociated with mergers, though a significant merger fraction is still\nplausible. Instead, we propose that our sample are examples of the massive\ngalaxy population at $z\\sim2$ that harbor a briefly luminous, \"flickering\" AGN,\nand in which the $G$ and M$_{20}$ values have been perturbed, due to either the\nAGN, and/or the earliest formation stages of a bulge in an inside-out manner.\nFurthermore, we find that the mass assembly of the central black holes in our\nsample leads the mass assembly of any bulge component. Finally, we speculate\nthat our sample represent a small fraction of the immediate antecedents of\ncompact star-forming galaxies at $z\\sim2$.\n", "  The two-fluid Maxwell system couples frictionless electron and ion fluids via\nMaxwell's equations. When the frequencies of light waves, Langmuir waves, and\nsingle-particle cyclotron motion are scaled to be asymptotically large, the\ntwo-fluid Maxwell system becomes a fast-slow dynamical system. This fast-slow\nsystem admits a formally-exact single-fluid closure that may be computed\nsystematically with any desired order of accuracy through the use of a\nfunctional partial differential equation. In the leading order approximation,\nthe closure reproduces magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Higher order truncations of\nthe closure give an infinite hierarchy of extended MHD models that allow for\narbitrary mass ratio, as well as perturbative deviations from charge\nneutrality. The closure is interpreted geometrically as an invariant slow\nmanifold in the infinite-dimensional two-fluid phase space, on which two-fluid\nmotions are free of high-frequency oscillations. This perspective shows that\nthe full closure inherits a Hamiltonian structure from two-fluid theory. By\nemploying infinite-dimensional Lie transforms, the Poisson bracket for the\nall-orders closure may be obtained in closed form. Thus, conservative\ntruncations of the single-fluid closure may be obtained by simply truncating\nthe single-fluid Hamiltonian. Moreover, the closed-form expression for the\nall-orders bracket gives explicit expressions for a number of the full\nclosure's conservation laws. Notably, the full closure, as well as any of its\nHamiltonian truncations, admits a pair of independent circulation invariants.\n", "  We present experimental results demonstrating controllable dispersion in a\nring laser by monitoring the lasing-frequency response to cavity-length\nvariations. Pumping on an N-type level configuration in ${}^{87}$Rb, we tailor\nthe intra-cavity dispersion slope by varying experimental parameters such as\npump-laser frequency, atomic density, and pump power. As a result, we can tune\nthe pulling factor (PF), i.e. the ratio of the laser frequency shift to the\nempty cavity frequency shift, of our laser by more than an order of magnitude.\n", "  Transition metal oxides (TMOs) host a wealth of exotic phenomena ranging from\ncharge, orbital, and magnetic order to nontrivial topological phases and\nsuperconductivity. In order to translate these unique materials properties into\nnovel device functionalities, TMOs must be doped. However, the nature of\ncarriers in doped oxides and their conduction mechanism at the atomic scale\nremain unclear. Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)\ninvestigations provided new insight into these questions, revealing that the\ncarriers of prototypical metal oxides undergo a transition from a polaronic\nliquid to a Fermi liquid regime with increasing doping. Here, by performing\n\\textit{ab initio} many-body calculations of the ARPES spectra of TiO$_2$, we\nshow that this transition originates from non-adiabatic polar electron-phonon\ncoupling, and occurs when the frequency of plasma oscillations exceeds that of\nlongitudinal-optical phonons. This finding suggests that a universal mechanism\nmay underlie polaron formation in TMOs, and provides a new paradigm for\nengineering emergent properties in quantum matter.\n", "  Periodograms are used as a key significance assessment and visualisation tool\nto display the significant periodicities in unevenly sampled time series. We\nintroduce a framework of periodograms, called \"Agatha\", to disentangle periodic\nsignals from correlated noise and to solve the 2-dimensional model selection\nproblem: signal dimension and noise model dimension. These periodograms are\ncalculated by applying likelihood maximization and marginalization and combined\nin a self-consistent way. We compare Agatha with other periodograms for the\ndetection of Keplerian signals in synthetic radial velocity data produced for\nthe Radial Velocity Challenge as well as in radial velocity datasets of several\nSun-like stars. In our tests we find Agatha is able to recover signals to the\nadopted detection limit of the radial velocity challenge. Applied to real\nradial velocity, we use Agatha to confirm previous analysis of CoRoT-7 and to\nfind two new planet candidates with minimum masses of 15.1 $M_\\oplus$ and 7.08\n$M_\\oplus$ orbiting HD177565 and HD41248, with periods of 44.5 d and 13.4 d,\nrespectively. We find that Agatha outperforms other periodograms in terms of\nremoving correlated noise and assessing the significances of signals with more\nrobust metrics. Moreover, it can be used to select the optimal noise model and\nto test the consistency of signals in time. Agatha is intended to be flexible\nenough to be applied to time series analyses in other astronomical and\nscientific disciplines. Agatha is available at http://www.agatha.herts.ac.uk.\n", "  A three-dimensional color-fluid lattice Boltzmann model for immiscible\ntwo-phase flows is developed in the framework of a three-dimensional\n27-velocity (D3Q27) lattice. The collision operator comprises the D3Q27\nversions of three sub-operators: a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision\noperator, a generalized Liu--Valocchi--Kang perturbation operator, and a\nLatva-Kokko--Rothman recoloring operator. A D3Q27 version of an enhanced\nequilibrium distribution function is also incorporated into this model to\nimprove the Galilean invariance. Three types of numerical tests, namely, a\nstatic droplet, an oscillating droplet, and the Rayleigh--Taylor instability,\nshow a good agreement with analytical solutions and numerical simulations.\nFollowing these numerical tests, this model is applied to liquid-jet-breakup\nsimulations. The simulation conditions are matched to the conditions of the\nprevious experiments. In this case, numerical stability is maintained\nthroughout the simulation, although the kinematic viscosity for the continuous\nphase is set as low as $1.8\\times10^{-4}$, in which case the corresponding\nReynolds number is $3.4\\times10^{3}$; the developed lattice Boltzmann model\nbased on the D3Q27 lattice enables us to perform the simulation with parameters\ndirectly matched to the experiments. The jet's liquid column transitions from\nan asymmetrical to an axisymmetrical shape, and entrainment occurs from the\nside of the jet. The measured time history of the jet's leading-edge position\nshows a good agreement with the experiments. Finally, the reproducibility of\nthe regime map for liquid-liquid systems is assessed. The present lattice\nBoltzmann simulations well reproduce the characteristics of predicted regimes,\nincluding varicose breakup, sinuous breakup, and atomization.\n", "  We theoretically show that an externally driven dipole placed inside a\ncylindrical hollow waveguide can generate a train of ultrashort and\nultrafocused electromagnetic pulses. The waveguide encloses vacuum with perfect\nelectric conducting walls. A dipole driven by a single short pulse, which is\nproperly engineered to exploit the linear spectral filtering of the cylindrical\nhollow waveguide, excites longitudinal waveguide modes that are coherently\nre-focused at some particular instances of time. A dipole driven by a pulse\nwith a lower-bounded temporal width can thus generate, in principle, a finite\ntrain of arbitrarily short and focused electromagnetic pulses. We numerically\nshow that such ultrafocused pulses persist outside the cylindrical waveguide at\ndistances comparable to its radius.\n", "  Chiral magnets with topologically nontrivial spin order such as Skyrmions\nhave generated enormous interest in both fundamental and applied sciences. We\nreport broadband microwave spectroscopy performed on the insulating chiral\nferrimagnet Cu$_{2}$OSeO$_{3}$. For the damping of magnetization dynamics we\nfind a remarkably small Gilbert damping parameter of about $1\\times10^{-4}$ at\n5 K. This value is only a factor of 4 larger than the one reported for the best\ninsulating ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet. We detect a series of sharp\nresonances and attribute them to confined spin waves in the mm-sized samples.\nConsidering the small damping, insulating chiral magnets turn out to be\npromising candidates when exploring non-collinear spin structures for high\nfrequency applications.\n", "  The ultraviolet (UV) light from a host star influences a planet's atmospheric\nphotochemistry and will affect interpretations of exoplanetary spectra from\nfuture missions like the James Webb Space Telescope. These effects will be\nparticularly critical in the study of planetary atmospheres around M dwarfs,\nincluding Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. Given the higher activity\nlevels of M dwarfs compared to Sun-like stars, time resolved UV data are needed\nfor more accurate input conditions for exoplanet atmospheric modeling. The\nGalaxy Evolution Explorer (\\emph{GALEX}) provides multi-epoch photometric\nobservations in two UV bands: near-ultraviolet (NUV; 1771 -- 2831 \\AA) and\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV; 1344 -- 1786 \\AA). Within 30 pc of Earth, there are 357\nand 303 M dwarfs in the NUV and FUV bands, respectively, with multiple\\GALEX\nobservations. Simultaneous NUV and FUV detections exist for 145 stars in\nboth\\GALEX bands. Our analyses of these data show that low-mass stars are\ntypically more variable in the FUV than the NUV. Median variability increases\nwith later spectral types in the NUV with no clear trend in the FUV. We find\nevidence that flares increase the FUV flux density far more than the NUV flux\ndensity, leading to variable FUV to NUV flux density ratios in the \\GALEX\\\nbandpasses.The ratio of FUV to NUV flux is important for interpreting the\npresence of atmospheric molecules in planetary atmospheres such as oxygen and\nmethane as a high FUV to NUV ratio may cause false-positive biosignature\ndetections. This ratio of flux density in the\\GALEX\\ bands spans three orders\nof magnitude in our sample, from 0.008 to 4.6, and is 1 to 2 orders of\nmagnitude higher than for G dwarfs like the Sun. These results characterize the\nUV behavior for the largest set of low-mass stars to date.\n", "  We investigate the optical properties in a minimal model of spin-orbit\ncoupled systems on honeycomb lattice at half-filling. The absorption of the\ncircularly polarized light in the charge and antiferromagnetic ordered states\nis particularly studied, and the spin-valley selective excitation depending on\nthe handedness of the light is found. It is shown that the optical selection\nrules plainly differ with the type of broken symmetries and topological\nproperties of the electronic states. Consequently, the abrupt change of\nspin-valley selectivity in the optical absorption occurs at the topological\ntransition caused by changing the magnitude of the order parameters.\n", "  We study the impact of Rydberg molecule formation on the storage and\nretrieval of Rydberg polaritons in an ultracold atomic medium. We observe\ncoherent revivals appearing in the retrieval efficiency of stored photons that\noriginate from simultaneous excitation of Rydberg atoms and Rydberg molecules\nin the system with subsequent interference between the possible storage paths.\nWe show that over a large range of principal quantum numbers the observed\nresults can be described by a two-state model including only the atomic Rydberg\nstate and the Rydberg dimer molecule state. At higher principal quantum numbers\nthe influence of polyatomic molecules becomes relevant and the dynamics of the\nsystem undergoes a transition from coherent evolution of a few-state system to\nan effective dephasing into a continuum of molecular states.\n", "  A number of micro-scale biological flows are characterized by spatio-temporal\nchaos. These include dense suspensions of swimming bacteria, microtubule\nbundles driven by motor proteins, and dividing and migrating confluent layers\nof cells. A characteristic common to all of these systems is that they are\nladen with active matter, which transforms free energy in the fluid into\nkinetic energy. Because of collective effects, the active matter induces\nmulti-scale flow motions that bear strong visual resemblance to turbulence. In\nthis study, multi-scale statistical tools are employed to analyze direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of periodic two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)\nactive flows and compare them to classic turbulent flows. Statistical\ndescriptions of the flows and their variations with activity levels are\nprovided in physical and spectral spaces. A scale-dependent intermittency\nanalysis is performed using wavelets. The results demonstrate fundamental\ndifferences between active and high-Reynolds number turbulence; for instance,\nthe intermittency is smaller and less energetic in active flows, and the work\nof the active stress is spectrally exerted near the integral scales and\ndissipated mostly locally by viscosity, with convection playing a minor role in\nmomentum transport across scales.\n", "  We propose a new semi-Lagrangian Vlasov-Poisson solver. It employs elements\nof metric to follow locally the flow and its deformation, allowing one to find\nquickly and accurately the initial phase-space position $Q(P)$ of any test\nparticle $P$, by expanding at second order the geometry of the motion in the\nvicinity of the closest element. It is thus possible to reconstruct accurately\nthe phase-space distribution function at any time $t$ and position $P$ by\nproper interpolation of initial conditions, following Liouville theorem. When\ndistorsion of the elements of metric becomes too large, it is necessary to\ncreate new initial conditions along with isotropic elements and repeat the\nprocedure again until next resampling. To speed up the process, interpolation\nof the phase-space distribution is performed at second order during the\ntransport phase, while third order splines are used at the moments of\nremapping. We also show how to compute accurately the region of influence of\neach element of metric with the proper percolation scheme. The algorithm is\ntested here in the framework of one-dimensional gravitational dynamics but is\nimplemented in such a way that it can be extended easily to four or\nsix-dimensional phase-space. It can also be trivially generalised to plasmas.\n", "  We present new observations of the GOODS-N field obtained at 5.5 GHz with the\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The central region of the field was\nimaged to a median r.m.s. of 3 microJy/beam with a resolution of 0.5 arcsec.\nFrom a 14-arcmin diameter region we extracted a sample of 94 radio sources with\nsignal-to-noise ratio greater than 5. Near-IR identifications are available for\nabout 88 percent of the radio sources. We used different multi-band diagnostics\nto separate active galactic nuclei (AGN), both radiatively efficient and\ninefficient, from star-forming galaxies. From our analysis, we find that about\n80 percent of our radio-selected sample is AGN-dominated, with the fraction\nraising to 92 percent when considering only the radio sources with redshift\n>1.5. This large fraction of AGN-dominated radio sources at very low flux\ndensities (the median flux density at 5.5 GHz is 42 microJy), where\nstar-forming galaxies are expected to dominate, is somewhat surprising and at\nodds with other results. Our interpretation is that both the frequency and\nangular resolution of our radio observations strongly select against radio\nsources whose brightness distribution is diffuse on scale of several kpc.\nIndeed, we find that the median angular sizes of the AGN-dominated sources is\naround 0.2-0.3 arcsec against 0.8 arcsec for star-forming galaxies. This\nhighlights the key role that high frequency radio observations can play in\npinpointing AGN-driven radio emission at microJy levels. This work is part of\nthe eMERGE legacy project.\n", "  We perform a high precision measurement of the static $q\\bar{q}$ potential in\nthree-dimensional SU($N$) gauge theory with $N=2,3$ and compare the results to\nthe potential obtained from the effective string theory. In particular, we show\nthat the exponent of the leading order correction in $1/R$ is 4, as predicted,\nand obtain accurate results for the continuum limits of the string tension and\nthe non-universal boundary coefficient $\\bar{b}_2$, including an extensive\nanalysis of all types of systematic uncertainties. We find that the magnitude\nof $\\bar{b}_2$ decreases with increasing $N$, leading to the possibility of a\nvanishing $\\bar{b}_2$ in the large $N$ limit. In the standard form of the\neffective string theory possible massive modes and the presence of a rigidity\nterm are usually not considered, even though they might give a contribution to\nthe energy levels. To investigate the effect of these terms, we perform a\nsecond analysis, including these contributions. We find that the associated\nexpression for the potential also provides a good description of the data. The\nresulting continuum values for $\\bar{b}_2$ are about a factor of 2 smaller than\nin the standard analysis, due to contaminations from an additional $1/R^4$\nterm. However, $\\bar{b}_2$ shows a similar decrease in magnitude with\nincreasing $N$. In the course of this extended analysis we also obtain\ncontinuum results for the masses appearing in the additional terms and we find\nthat they are around twice as large as the square root of the string tension in\nthe continuum and compatible between SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theory. In the\nfollow up papers we will extend our investigations to the large $N$ limit and\nexcited states of the open flux tube.\n", "  The density of states of a three dimensional Dirac equation with a random\npotential as well as in other problems of quantum motion in a random potential\nplaced in sufficiently high spatial dimensionality appears to be singular at a\ncertain critical disorder strength. This was seen numerically in a variety of\nstudies as well as supported by detailed renormalization group calculations. At\nthe same time it was suggested by a number of arguments accompanied by detailed\nnumerical simulations that this singularity is rounded off by the rare region\nfluctuations of random potential, and that tuning the disorder past its\ncritical value is not a genuine phase transition but rather a crossover. Here\nwe develop an analytic theory which explains how rare region effects indeed\nlead to rounding off of the singularity and to the crossover replacing the\ntransition.\n", "  We present the MOA Collaboration light curve data for planetary microlensing\nevent OGLE-2015-BLG-0954, which was previously announced in a paper by the\nKMTNet and OGLE Collaborations. The MOA data cover the caustic exit, which was\nnot covered by the KMTNet or OGLE data, and they provide a more reliable\nmeasurement of the finite source effect. The MOA data also provide a new source\ncolor measurement that reveals a lens-source relative proper motion of\n$\\mu_{\\rm rel} = 11.8\\pm 0.8\\,$mas/yr, which compares to the value of $\\mu_{\\rm\nrel} = 18.4\\pm 1.7\\,$mas/yr reported in the KMTNet-OGLE paper. This new MOA\nvalue for $\\mu_{\\rm rel}$ has an a priori probability that is a factor of $\\sim\n100$ times larger than the previous value, and it does not require a lens\nsystem distance of $D_L < 1\\,$kpc. Based on the corrected source color, we find\nthat the lens system consists of a planet of mass $3.4^{+3.7}_{-1.6} M_{\\rm\nJup}$ orbiting a $0.30^{+0.34}_{-0.14}M_\\odot$ star at an orbital separation of\n$2.1^{+2.2}_{-1.0}\\,$AU and a distance of $1.2^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\,$kpc.\n", "  We relate the large time asymptotics of the energy statistics in open\nharmonic networks to the variance-gamma distribution and prove a full Large\nDeviation Principle. We consider both Hamiltonian and stochastic dynamics, the\nlater case including electronic RC networks. We compare our theoretical\npredictions with the experimental data obtained by Ciliberto et al. [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 110, 180601 (2013)].\n", "  We describe a calculation of the spectrum of flavour-SU(3) octet and decuplet\nbaryons, their parity partners, and the radial excitations of these systems,\nmade using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector-vector contact\ninteraction as the foundation for the relevant few-body equations. Dynamical\nchiral symmetry breaking generates nonpointlike diquarks within these baryons\nand hence, using the contact interaction, flavour-antitriplet scalar,\npseudoscalar and vector, and flavour-sextet axial-vector quark-quark\ncorrelations can all play an active role. The model yields reasonable masses\nfor all systems studied, and Faddeev amplitudes for ground states and\nassociated parity partners that sketch a realistic picture of their internal\nstructure: ground-state, even parity baryons are constituted, almost\nexclusively, from like-parity diquark correlations; but orbital angular\nmomentum plays an important role in the rest-frame wave functions of odd-parity\nbaryons, whose Faddeev amplitudes are dominated by odd-parity diquarks.\n", "  The phenomenon of spontaneously growing metal whiskers (MW) raises\nsignificant reliability concerns due to its related arcing and shorting in\nelectric equipment. The growth kinetics of MW remains poorly predictable. Here\nwe present a theory describing the earlier observed intermittent growth of MW\nas caused by local energy barriers related to variations in the random electric\nfields generated by surface imperfections. We find the probabilistic\ndistribution of MW stopping times, during which MW growth halts, which is\nimportant for reliability projections.\n", "  Utilizing an ansatz developed by Maurya and co-workers we present a class of\nexact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations describing a\nspherically symmetric compact object. A detailed physical analysis of these\nsolutions in terms of stability, compactness and regularity indicate that these\nsolutions may be used to model strange star candidates. In particular, we model\nthe strange star candidate Her X-1 and show that our solution conforms to\nobservational data to an excellent degree of accuracy. An interesting and novel\nphenomenon which arises in this model is the fact that the relative difference\nbetween the electromagnetic force and the force due to pressure anisotropy\nchanges sign within the stellar interior. This may be a an additional mechanism\nrequired for stability against cracking of the stellar object.\n", "  We analyze the interactions of particle detectors with coherent states of a\nfree scalar field. We find that the eigenvalues of the post-interaction density\nmatrices of i) a single detector, ii) two detectors, and iii) the partial\ntranspose of the latter, are all independent of which coherent state the field\nwas in. A consequence of these results is that a detector pair can harvest the\nsame amount of entanglement from any coherent field state as from the vacuum.\n", "  Quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in the medium surrounding\ntwo discharged macroscopic polarizable bodies induce a force between the two\nbodies, the so called Casimir force. In the last two decades many experiments\nhave accurately measured this force, and significant efforts are made to\nharness it in the actuation of micro and nano machines. The inherent many body\ncharacter of the Casimir force makes its computation very difficult in\nnon-planar geometries, like the standard experimental sphere-plate\nconfiguration. Here we derive an approximate semi-analytic formula for the\nsphere-plate Casimir force, which is both easy to compute numerically and very\naccurate at all distances. By a comparison with the fully converged exact\nscattering formula, we show that the error made by the approximate formula is\nindeed much smaller than the uncertainty of present and foreseeable Casimir\nexperiments.\n", "  Method: In an accompanying paper (arXiv: 1705.00886) we determined luminosity\nand effective temperature for the 335 T2Cs and ACs in the LMC and SMC\ndiscovered in the OGLE-III survey, by constructing the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) and fitting this with model atmospheres and a dust radiative\ntransfer model (in the case of dust excess). Building on these results we study\nthe PL and PR relations.\n  Using existing pulsation models for RR Lyrae and classical Cepheids we derive\nthe period-luminosity-mass-temperature-metallicity relations, and then estimate\nthe pulsation mass.\n  Results: The PL relation for the T2Cs does not appear to depend on\nmetallicity, and, excluding the dusty RV Tau stars, is $M_{\\rm bol}= +0.12\n-1.78 \\log P$ (for $P < 50$ days). Relations for fundamental and first overtone\nLMC ACs are also presented. The PR relation for T2C also shows little or no\ndependence on metallicity or period. Our preferred relation combines SMC and\nLMC stars and all T2C subclasses, and is $\\log R = 0.846 + 0.521 \\log P$.\nRelations for fundamental and first overtone LMC ACs are also presented. The\npulsation masses from the RR Lyrae and classical Cepheid pulsation models agree\nwell for the short period T2Cs, the BL Her subtype, and ACs, and are consistent\nwith estimates in the literature, i.e. $M_{\\rm BLH} \\sim 0.49$ \\msol\\ and\n$M_{\\rm AC} ~\\sim 1.3$ \\msol, respectively. The masses of the W Vir appear\nsimilar to the BL Her. The situation for the pWVir and RV Tau stars is less\nclear. For many RV Tau the masses are in conflict with the standard picture of\n(single-star) post-AGB evolution, the masses being either too large ($\\gtrsim$\n1 \\msol) or too small ($\\lesssim$ 0.4 \\msol).\n", "  Polarizability expressions are commonly used in optics and photonics to model\nthe light scattering by small particles. Models based on Taylor series of the\nscattering coefficients of the particles fail to predict the morphologic\nresonances hosted by dielectric particles. Here, we propose to use the\nfactorization of the special functions appearing in the expression of the Mie\nscattering coefficients to derive point-like models. These models can be\napplied to reproduce both Mie resonances of dielectric particles and plasmonic\nresonances of metallic particles. They provide simple but robust tools to\npredict accurately the electric and magnetic Mie resonances in dielectric\nparticles.\n", "  We monitor the Landau-Zener dynamics of a single-ion magnet in a\nspin-transistor geometry. For increasing field-sweep rates, the spin reversal\nprobability shows increasing deviations from that of a closed system. In the\nlow-conductance limit, such deviations are shown to result from a dephasing\nprocess. In particular, the observed behaviors are succesfully simulated by\nmeans of an adiabatic master equation, with time averaged dephasing (Lindblad)\noperators. The time average is tentatively interpeted in terms of the finite\ntime resolution of the continuous measurement.\n", "  It is shown that conformally invariant theories can be obtained within the\nframework of the coset space construction. The corresponding technique is\napplicable for the construction of representations of the unbroken conformal\ngroup, as well as of a spontaneously broken one. A special role of the\n\"Nambu-Goldstone fields\" for special conformal transformations is clarified -\nthey ensure self-consistency of a theory by guaranteeing that discrete\nsymmetries are indeed symmetries of the theory. A generalization of the\ndeveloped construction to a special class of symmetry groups with a non-linear\nrealization of its discrete elements is given. Based on these results, the\nusage of the inverse Higgs constraints for the conformal group undergoing\nspontaneous symmetry breaking is questioned.\n", "  We present the H$\\alpha$ intensity map of the host galaxy of the repeating\nfast radio burst FRB 121102 at a redshift of z=0.193 obtained with the\nAO-assisted Kyoto 3DII optical integral-field unit mounted on the 8.2-m Subaru\nTelescope. We detected a compact H$\\alpha$-emitting (i.e., star-forming) region\nin the galaxy, which has a much smaller angular size [$< 0\".57$ (1.9 kpc) at\nfull width at half maximum (FWHM)] than the extended stellar continuum emission\nregion determined by the Gemini/GMOS z'-band image [$\\simeq 1\".4$ (4.6 kpc) at\nFWHM with ellipticity b/a=0.45]. The spatial offset between the centroid of the\nH$\\alpha$ emission region and the position of the radio bursts is $0\".08 \\pm\n0\".02$ ($0.26 \\pm 0.07$ kpc), indicating that FRB 121102 is located within the\nstar-forming region. This close spatial association of FRB 121102 with the\nstar-forming region is consistent with expectations from young pulsar/magnetar\nmodels for FRB 121102, and it also suggests that the observed H$\\alpha$\nemission region can make a major dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the\nhost galaxy DM component of FRB 121102. Nevertheless, the largest possible\nvalue of the DM contribution from the H$\\alpha$ emission region inferred from\nour observations still requires a significant amount of ionized baryons in\nintergalactic medium (the so-called `missing' baryons) as the DM source of FRB\n121102, and we obtain a 90\\% confidence level lower limit on the cosmic baryon\ndensity in the intergalactic medium in the low-redshift universe as\n$\\Omega_{IGM} > 0.012$.\n", "  We present a comparison of parallaxes and radii from asteroseismology and\nGaia DR1 (TGAS) for 2200 Kepler stars spanning from the main sequence to the\nred giant branch. We show that previously identified offsets between TGAS\nparallaxes and distances derived from asteroseismology and eclipsing binaries\nhave likely been overestimated for parallaxes <~ 5-10 mas (~ 90-98% of the TGAS\nsample). The observed differences in our sample can furthermore be partially\ncompensated by adopting a hotter Teff scale (such as the infrared flux method)\ninstead of spectroscopic temperatures for dwarfs and subgiants. Residual\nsystematic differences are at the ~ 2% level in parallax across three orders of\nmagnitude. We use TGAS parallaxes to empirically demonstrate that asteroseismic\nradii are accurate to ~ 5% or better for stars between ~ 0.8-8 Rsun. We find no\nsignificant offset for main-sequence (<~ 1.5 Rsun) and low-luminosity RGB stars\n(~ 3-8 Rsun), but seismic radii appear to be systematically underestimated by\n~5% for subgiants (~ 1.5-3 Rsun). We find no systematic errors as a function of\nmetallicity between [Fe/H] ~ -0.8 to +0.4 dex, and show tentative evidence that\ncorrections to the scaling relation for the large frequency separation (Dnu)\nimprove the agreement with TGAS for RGB stars. Finally, we demonstrate that\nbeyond ~ 3 kpc asteroseismology will provide more precise distances than\nend-of-mission Gaia data, highlighting the synergy and complementary nature of\nGaia and asteroseismology for studying galactic stellar populations.\n", "  The energy spectrum of the valence band in HgTe/Cd$_x$Hg$_{1-x}$Te quantum\nwells with a width $(8-20)$~nm has been studied experimentally by\nmagnetotransport effects and theoretically in framework $4$-bands $kP$-method.\nComparison of the Hall density with the density found from period of the\nShubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations clearly shows that the degeneracy of\nstates of the top of the valence band is equal to 2 at the hole density $p<\n5.5\\times 10^{11}$~cm$^{-2}$. Such degeneracy does not agree with the\ncalculations of the spectrum performed within the framework of the $4$-bands\n$kP$-method for symmetric quantum wells. These calculations show that the top\nof the valence band consists of four spin-degenerate extremes located at $k\\neq\n0$ (valleys) which gives the total degeneracy $K=8$. It is shown that taking\ninto account the \"mixing of states\" at the interfaces leads to the removal of\nthe spin degeneracy that reduces the degeneracy to $K=4$. Accounting for any\nadditional asymmetry, for example, due to the difference in the mixing\nparameters at the interfaces, the different broadening of the boundaries of the\nwell, etc, leads to reduction of the valleys degeneracy, making $K=2$. It is\nnoteworthy that for our case two-fold degeneracy occurs due to degeneracy of\ntwo single-spin valleys. The hole effective mass ($m_h$) determined from\nanalysis of the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the SdH oscillations\nshow that $m_h$ is equal to $(0.25\\pm0.02)\\,m_0$ and weakly increases with the\nhole density. Such a value of $m_h$ and its dependence on the hole density are\nin a good agreement with the calculated effective mass.\n", "  We report magnetic behavior of two intermetallics-based kagome lattices,\nTb3Ru4Al12 and Er3Ru4Al12, crystallizing in the Gd3Ru4Al12-type hexagonal\ncrystal structure, by measurements in the range 1.8-300 K with bulk\nexperimental techniques (ac and dc magnetization, heat-capacity and\nmagnetoresistance). The main finding is that the Tb compound, known to order\nantiferromagnetically below (T_N=) 22 K, shows glassy characteristics at lower\ntemperatures (<15K), thus characterizing this compound as a re-entrant\nspin-glass. The data reveal that glassy phase is quite complex and is of a\ncluster type. Since the glassy behavior was not seen for the Gd analogue in the\npast literature, this finding for the Tb compound emphasizes that this kagome\nfamily could provide an opportunity to explore the role of higher order (such\nas quadrupole) in bringing out magnetic frustration. Additional findings\nreported here for this compound are: (i) The temperature dependence of magnetic\nsusceptibility and electrical resistivity in the range 12 - 20 K are found to\nbe hysteretic leading to a magnetic phase in this temperature range, mimicking\ndisorder-induced first-order magnetic phase-transition. (ii) Features\nattributable to an interesting magnetic phase co-existence phenomenon in the\nmagnetoresistance in zero field, after cycling across metamagnetic transition\nfields, are observed. With respect to the Er compound, we do not find any\nevidence for long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K, but this appears to be\non the verge of magnetic order at 2 K.\n", "  We investigate positron scattering upon endohedrals and compare it with\nelectron-endohedral scattering. We show that the polarization of the fullerene\nshell considerably alters the polarization potential of an atom, stuffed inside\na fullerene. This essentially affects both the positron and electron elastic\nscattering phases as well as corresponding cross-sections. Of great importance\nis also the interaction between the incoming positron and the target electrons\nthat leads to formation the virtual positronium. We illustrate the general\ntrend by concrete examples of positron and electron scattering upon endohedrals\nHe@C60 and Ar@C60, and compare it to scattering upon fullerene C60. To obtain\nthe presented results, we have employed new simplified approaches that permit\nto incorporate the effect of fullerenes polarizability into the He@C60 and\nAr@C60 polarization potential and to take into account the virtual positronium\nformation. Using these approaches, we obtained numeric results that show strong\nvariations in shape and magnitudes of scattering phases and cross-sections due\nto effect of endohedral polarization and virtual positronium formation.\n", "  The NA62 experiment at CERN SPS is aimed to measure the branching ratio of\nthe ultra-rare decay $K^+\\rightarrow\\pi^+ \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ with 10\\% accuracy.\nThe experiment operates with a 75 GeV/c high intensity (750 MHz) secondary\nbeam. A new detector, named Charged Particle Hodoscope (CHOD), designed to\nproduce an input signal to the L0 trigger processor for events with charged\nparticles produced in kaon decays, has been assembled, installed, integrated in\nNA62 Data Acquisition System (DAQ) and commissioned in 2016. During the whole\n2016 run the detector has been in continuous operation. Design and performance\nfeatures of the detector are presented.\n", "  We wish to study the extent and subparsec scale spatial structure of\nintervening quasar absorbers, mainly those involving neutral and molecular gas.\nWe have selected quasar absorption systems with high spectral resolution and\ngood S/N data, with some of their lines falling on quasar emission features. By\ninvestigating the consistency of absorption profiles seen for lines formed\neither against the quasar continuum source or on the much more extended\nemission line region (ELR), we can probe the extent and structure of the\nforeground absorber over the extent of the ELR (0.3-1 pc). The spatial covering\nanalysis provides constraints on the transverse size of the absorber and thus\nis complementary to variability or photoionisation modelling studies. The\nmethods we used to identify spatial covering or structure effects involve line\nprofile fitting and curve of growth analysis.We have detected three absorbers\nwith unambiguous non uniformity effects in neutral gas. For one extreme case,\nthe FeI absorber at z_abs=0.45206 towards HE 0001-2340, we derive a coverage\nfactor of the ELR of at most 0.10 and possibly very close to zero; this implies\nan absorber overall size no larger than 0.06 pc. For the z_abs=2.41837 CI\nabsorber towards QSO J1439+1117, absorption is significantly stronger towards\nthe ELR than towards the continuum source in several CI and CI* velocity\ncomponents pointing to factors of about two spatial variations of their column\ndensities and the presence of structures at the 100 au - 0.1 pc scale. The\nother systems with firm or possible effects can be described in terms of\npartial covering of the ELR, with coverage factors in the range 0.7 - 1. The\noverall results for cold, neutral absorbers imply a transverse extent of about\nfive times or less the ELR size, which is consistent with other known\nconstraints.\n", "  We report on the Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy of the nitrous oxide\n(N$_2$O) overtone transition at 1.28~$\\mu$m. This measurement is performed by\nthe noise-immune cavity-enhanced optical heterodyne molecular spectroscopy\n(NICE-OHMS) technique based on the quantum-dot (QD) laser. A high intra-cavity\npower, up to 10~W, reaches the saturation limit of the overtone line using an\noptical cavity with a high finesse of 113,500. At a pressure of several mTorr,\nthe saturation dip is observed with a full width at half-maximum of about 2~MHz\nand a signal-to-noise ratio of 71. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst saturation spectroscopy of molecular overtone transitions in 1.3~$\\mu$m\nregion. The QD laser is then locked to this dispersion signal with a stability\nof 15 kHz at 1 sec integration time. We demonstrate the potential of the N$_2$O\nas markers because of its particularly rich spectrum at the vicinity of\n1.28-1.30 $\\mu$m where lies several important forbidden transitions of atomic\nparity violation measurements and the 1.3 $\\mu$m O-band of optical\ncommunication.\n", "  CO2 chemisorption on SrTiO3(001) surfaces is studied using ab initio\ncalculations in order to establish new chemical sensing mechanisms. We find\nthat CO2 adsorption opens the material band gap, however, while the adsorption\non the TiO2-terminated surface neutralizes surface states at the valence band\n(VB) maximum, CO2 on the SrO-terminated surfaces suppresses the conduction band\n(CB) minimum. For the TiO2-terminated surface, the effect is explained by the\npassivation of dangling bonds, whereas for the SrO-terminated surface, the\nsuppression is caused by the surface relaxation. Modulation of the VB states\nimplies a more direct change in charge distribution, and thus the induced\nchange in band gap is more prominent at the TiO2 termination. Further, we show\nthat both CO2 adsorption energy and surface band gap are strongly dependent on\nCO2 coverage, suggesting that the observed effect can be utilized for sensing\napplication in a wide range of CO2 concentrations.\n", "  We demonstrate a 16-pixel array of radio-frequency superconducting nanowire\nsingle-photon detectors with an integrated and scalable frequency-division\nmultiplexing architecture, reducing the required bias and readout lines to a\nsingle microwave feed line. The electrical behavior of the photon-sensitive\nnanowires, embedded in a resonant circuit, as well as the optical performance\nand timing jitter of the single detectors is discussed. Besides the single\npixel measurements we also demonstrate the operation of the 16-pixel array with\na temporal, spatial and photon-number resolution.\n", "  Using methods of statistical physics, we analyse the error of learning\ncouplings in large Ising models from independent data (the inverse Ising\nproblem). We concentrate on learning based on local cost functions, such as the\npseudo-likelihood method for which the couplings are inferred independently for\neach spin. Assuming that the data are generated from a true Ising model, we\ncompute the reconstruction error of the couplings using a combination of the\nreplica method with the cavity approach for densely connected systems. We show\nthat an explicit estimator based on a quadratic cost function achieves minimal\nreconstruction error, but requires the length of the true coupling vector as\nprior knowledge. A simple mean field estimator of the couplings which does not\nneed such knowledge is asymptotically optimal, i.e. when the number of\nobservations is much large than the number of spins. Comparison of the theory\nwith numerical simulations shows excellent agreement for data generated from\ntwo models with random couplings in the high temperature region: a model with\nindependent couplings (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model), and a model where the\nmatrix of couplings has a Wishart distribution.\n", "  How does nature hold together protons and neutrons to form the wide variety\nof complex nuclei in the universe? Describing many-nucleon systems from the\nfundamental theory of quantum chromodynamics has been the greatest challenge in\nanswering this question. The chiral effective field theory description of the\nnuclear force now makes this possible but requires certain parameters that are\nnot uniquely determined. Defining the nuclear force needs identification of\nobservables sensitive to the different parametrizations. From a measurement of\nproton elastic scattering on $^{10}$C at TRIUMF and ab initio nuclear reaction\ncalculations we show that the shape and magnitude of the measured differential\ncross section is strongly sensitive to the nuclear force prescription.\n", "  We present the VISTA-CFHT Stripe 82 (VICS82) survey: a near-infrared (J+Ks)\nsurvey covering 150 square degrees of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nequatorial Stripe 82 to an average depth of J=21.9 AB mag and Ks=21.4 AB mag\n(80% completeness limits; 5-sigma point source depths are approximately 0.5 mag\nbrighter). VICS82 contributes to the growing legacy of multi-wavelength data in\nthe Stripe 82 footprint. The addition of near-infrared photometry to the\nexisting SDSS Stripe 82 coadd ugriz photometry reduces the scatter in stellar\nmass estimates to delta log(M_stellar)~0.3 dex for galaxies with\nM_stellar>10^9M_sun at z~0.5, and offers improvement compared to optical-only\nestimates out to z~1, with stellar masses constrained within a factor of\napproximately 2.5. When combined with other multi-wavelength imaging of the\nStripe, including moderate-to-deep ultraviolet (GALEX), optical and\nmid-infrared (Spitzer IRAC) coverage, as well as tens of thousands of\nspectroscopic redshifts, VICS82 gives access to approximately 0.5 Gpc^3 of\ncomoving volume. Some of the main science drivers of VICS82 include (a)\nmeasuring the stellar mass function of L^star galaxies out to z~1; (b)\ndetecting intermediate redshift quasars at 2<z<3.5; (c) measuring the stellar\nmass function and baryon census of clusters of galaxies, and (d) performing\noptical/near-infrared-cosmic microwave background lensing cross-correlation\nexperiments linking stellar mass to large-scale dark matter structure. Here we\ndefine and describe the survey, highlight some early science results and\npresent the first public data release, which includes an SDSS-matched catalogue\nas well as the calibrated pixel data itself.\n", "  We consider a $D$-dimensional gravitational model with a Gauss-Bonnet term\nand the cosmological term $\\Lambda$. We restrict the metrics to diagonal\ncosmological ones and find for certain $\\Lambda$ a class of solutions with\nexponential time dependence of three scale factors, governed by three\nnon-coinciding Hubble-like parameters $H >0$, $h_1$ and $h_2$, corresponding to\nfactor spaces of dimensions $m > 2$, $k_1 > 1$ and $k_2 > 1$, respectively,\nwith $k_1 \\neq k_2$ and $D = 1 + m + k_1 + k_2$. Any of these solutions\ndescribes an exponential expansion of $3d$ subspace with Hubble parameter $H$\nand zero variation of the effective gravitational constant $G$. We prove the\nstability of these solutions in a class of cosmological solutions with diagonal\nmetrics.\n", "  The standard Black Holes (BHs) in General Relativity, as well as other\nultra-compact objects (with or without an event horizon) admit planar circular\nphoton orbits. These light rings (LRs) determine several spacetime properties.\nFor instance, stable LRs trigger instabilities and, in spherical symmetry,\n(unstable) LRs completely determine BH shadows. In generic stationary,\naxi-symmetric spacetimes, non-planar bound photon orbits may also exist,\nregardless of the integrability properties of the photon motion. We suggest a\nclassification of these fundamental photon orbits (FPOs) and, using Poincar\\'e\nmaps, determine a criterion for their stability. For the Kerr BH, all FPOs are\nunstable (similarly to its LRs) and completely determine the Kerr shadow. But\nin non-Kerr spacetimes, stable FPOs may also exist, even when all LRs are\nunstable, triggering new instabilities. We illustrate this for the case of Kerr\nBHs with Proca hair, wherein, moreover, qualitatively novel shadows with a\ncuspy edge exist, a feature that can be understood from the interplay between\nstable and unstable FPOs. FPOs are the natural generalisation of LRs beyond\nspherical symmetry and should generalise the LRs key role in different\nspacetime properties.\n", "  We present an extensive numerical comparison of a family of balance models\nappropriate to the semi-geostrophic limit of the rotating shallow water\nequations, and derived by variational asymptotics in Oliver (2006) for small\nRossby numbers ${\\mathrm{Ro}}$. This family of generalized large-scale\nsemi-geostrophic (GLSG) models contains the $L_1$-model introduced by Salmon\n(1983) as a special case. We use these models to produce balanced initial\nstates for the full shallow water equations. We then numerically investigate\nhow well these models capture the dynamics of an initially balanced shallow\nwater flow. It is shown that, whereas the $L_1$-member of the GLSG family is\nable to reproduce the balanced dynamics of the full shallow water equations on\ntime scales of ${\\mathcal{O}}(1/{\\mathrm{Ro}})$ very well, all other members\ndevelop significant unphysical high wavenumber contributions in the\nageostrophic vorticity which spoil the dynamics.\n", "  The radio-quiet quasar Q2059-360 at redshift $z=3.08$ is known to be close to\na small Lyman $\\alpha$ blob (LAB) and to be absorbed by a proximate damped\nLy$\\alpha$ (PDLA) system.\n  Here, we present the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field\nspectroscopy follow-up of this quasi-stellar object (QSO). Our primary goal is\nto characterize this LAB in detail by mapping it both spatially and spectrally\nusing the Ly$\\alpha$ line, and by looking for high-ionization lines to\nconstrain the emission mechanism.\n  Combining the high sensitivity of the MUSE integral field spectrograph\nmounted on the Yepun telescope at ESO-VLT with the natural coronagraph provided\nby the PDLA, we map the LAB down to the QSO position, after robust subtraction\nof QSO light in the spectral domain.\n  In addition to confirming earlier results for the small bright component of\nthe LAB, we unveil a faint filamentary emission protruding to the south over\nabout 80 pkpc (physical kpc); this results in a total size of about 120 pkpc.\nWe derive the velocity field of the LAB (assuming no transfer effects) and map\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ line width. Upper limits are set to the flux of the N V $\\lambda\n1238-1242$, C IV $\\lambda 1548-1551$, He II $\\lambda 1640$, and C III] $\\lambda\n1548-1551$ lines. We have discovered two probable Ly$\\alpha$ emitters at the\nsame redshift as the LAB and at projected distances of 265 kpc and 207 kpc from\nthe QSO; their Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities might well be enhanced by the QSO\nradiation. We also find an emission line galaxy at $z=0.33$ near the line of\nsight to the QSO.\n  This LAB shares the same general characteristics as the 17 others surrounding\nradio-quiet QSOs presented previously. However, there are indications that it\nmay be centered on the PDLA galaxy rather than on the QSO.\n", "  Recent re-calibration of the Type Ia supernova (SNe~Ia) magnitude-redshift\nrelation combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) data have provided excellent constraints on the standard\ncosmological model. Here, we examine particular classes of alternative\ncosmologies, motivated by various physical mechanisms, e.g. scalar fields,\nmodified gravity and phase transitions to test their consistency with\nobservations of SNe~Ia and the ratio of the angular diameter distances from the\nCMB and BAO. Using a model selection criterion for a relative comparison of the\nmodels (the Bayes Factor), we find moderate to strong evidence that the data\nprefer flat $\\Lambda$ CDM over models invoking a thawing behaviour of the\nquintessence scalar field. However, some exotic models like the growing\nneutrino mass cosmology and vacuum metamorphosis still present acceptable\nevidence values. The bimetric gravity model with only the linear interaction\nterm can be ruled out by the combination of SNe~Ia and CMB/BAO datasets whereas\nthe model with linear and quadratic interaction terms has a comparable evidence\nvalue to standard $\\Lambda$ CDM. Thawing models are found to have significantly\npoorer evidence compared to flat $\\Lambda$ CDM cosmology under the assumption\nthat the CMB compressed likelihood provides an adequate description for these\nnon-standard cosmologies. We also present estimates for constraints from future\ndata and find that geometric probes from oncoming surveys can put severe limits\non non-standard cosmological models.\n", "  Crowded environments modify the diffusion of macromolecules, generally\nslowing their movement and inducing transient anomalous subdiffusion. The\npresence of obstacles also modifies the kinetics and equilibrium behavior of\ntracers. While previous theoretical studies of particle diffusion have\ntypically assumed either impenetrable obstacles or binding interactions that\nimmobilize the particle, in many cellular contexts bound particles remain\nmobile. Examples include membrane proteins or lipids with some entry and\ndiffusion within lipid domains and proteins that can enter into membraneless\norganelles or compartments such as the nucleolus. Using a lattice model, we\nstudied the diffusive movement of tracer particles which bind to soft\nobstacles, allowing tracers and obstacles to occupy the same lattice site. For\nsticky obstacles, bound tracer particles are immobile, while for slippery\nobstacles, bound tracers can hop without penalty to adjacent obstacles. In both\nmodels, binding significantly alters tracer motion. The type and degree of\nmotion while bound is a key determinant of the tracer mobility: slippery\nobstacles can allow nearly unhindered diffusion, even at high obstacle filling\nfraction. To mimic compartmentalization in a cell, we examined how obstacle\nsize and a range of bound diffusion coefficients affect tracer dynamics. The\nbehavior of the model is similar in two and three spatial dimensions. Our work\nhas implications for protein movement and interactions within cells.\n", "  Cosmological perturbations of massive higher-spin fields are generated during\ninflation, but they decay on scales larger than the Hubble radius as a\nconsequence of the Higuchi bound. By introducing suitable couplings to the\ninflaton field, we show that one can obtain statistical correlators of massive\nhigher-spin fields which remain constant or decay very slowly outside the\nHubble radius. This opens up the possibility of new observational signatures\nfrom inflation.\n", "  We propose a set of general coupling conditions to select a coupling profile\n(a set of coupling matrices) from the linear flow matrix (LFM) of dynamical\nsystems for realizing global stability of complete synchronization (CS) in\nidentical systems and robustness to parameter perturbation. The coupling\nmatrices define the coupling links between any two oscillators in a network\nthat consists of a conventional diffusive coupling link (self-coupling link) as\nwell as a cross-coupling link. The addition of a selective cross-coupling link\nin particular plays constructive roles that ensure the global stability of\nsynchrony and furthermore enables robustness of synchrony against small to\nnon-small parameter perturbation. We elaborate the general conditions for the\nselection of coupling profiles for two coupled systems, three- and four-node\nnetwork motifs analytically as well as numerically using benchmark models, the\nLorenz system, the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, the Shimizu-Morioka laser\nmodel, the R\\\"ossler system and a Sprott system. The role of the cross-coupling\nlink is, particularly, exemplified with an example of a larger network where it\nsaves the network from a breakdown of synchrony against large parameter\nperturbation in any node. The perturbed node in the network transits from CS to\ngeneralized synchronization (GS) when all the other nodes remain in CS. The GS\nis manifested by an amplified response of the perturbed node in a coherent\nstate.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental realization of the Haldane model by\nultracold fermions in an optical lattice, we investigate phase diagrams of the\nhard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice. This model is closely\nrelated with a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum spin model.\nNearest-neighbor (NN) hopping amplitude is positive and it prefers an AF\nconfigurations of phases of Bose-Einstein condensates. On the other hand, an\namplitude of the next-NN hopping depends on an angle variable as in the Haldane\nmodel. Phase diagrams are obtained by means of an extended path-integral\nMonte-Carlo simulations. Besides the AF state, a 120$^o$-order state, there\nappear other phases including a Bose metal in which no long-range orders exist.\n", "  We explore stability regions for solitons in the nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation with a spatially confined region carrying a combination of\nself-focusing cubic and septimal terms, with a quintic one of either focusing\nor defocusing sign. This setting can be implemented in optical waveguides based\non colloids of nanoparticles. The solitons stability is identified by solving\nlinearized equations for small perturbations, and is found to fully comply with\nthe Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. In the limit case of tight confinement of the\nnonlinearity, results are obtained in an analytical form, approximating the\nconfinement profile by a delta-function. It is found that the confinement\ngreatly increases the largest total power of stable solitons, in the case when\nthe quintic term is defocusing, which suggests a possibility to create tightly\nconfined high-power light beams guided by the spatial modulation of the local\nnonlinearity strength.\n", "  We present the computer code RECOLA2 along with the first NLO electroweak\ncorrections to Higgs production in vector-boson fusion and updated results for\nHiggs strahlung in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and Higgs-Singlet extension of\nthe Standard Model. A fully automated procedure for the generation of\ntree-level and one-loop matrix elements in general models, including\nrenormalization, is presented. We discuss the application of the\nBackground-Field Method to the extended models. Numerical results for NLO\nelectroweak cross sections are presented for different renormalization schemes\nin the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and the Higgs-Singlet extension of the Standard\nModel. Finally, we present distributions for the production of a heavy Higgs\nboson.\n", "  $La_xCa_{1-x}MnO_3$ (LCMO) has been studied in the framework of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) using Hubbard-U correction. We show that the formation\nof spin-polarons of different configurations is possible in the G-type\nantiferromagentic phase. We also show that the spin-polaron (SP) solutions are\nstabilized due to an interplay of magnetic and lattice effects at lower La\nconcentrations and mostly due to the lattice contribution at larger\nconcentrations. Our results indicate that the development of SPs is unfavorable\nin the C- and A-type antiferromagnetic phases. The theoretically obtained\nmagnetic state diagram is in good agreement with previously reported\nexperimental results\n", "  The repulsive short distance core is one of the main paradigms of nuclear\nphysics which even seems confirmed by QCD lattice calculations. On the other\nhand nuclear potentials at short distances are motivated by high energy\nbehavior where inelasticities play an important role. We analyze NN\ninteractions up to 3 GeV in terms of simple coarse grained complex and energy\ndependent interactions. We discuss two possible and conflicting scenarios which\nshare the common feature of a vanishing wave function at the core location in\nthe particular case of S- waves. We find that the optical potential with a\nrepulsive core exhibits a strong energy dependence whereas the optical\npotential with the structural core is characterized by a rather adiabatic\nenergy dependence which allows to treat inelasticity perturbatively. We discuss\nthe possible implications for nuclear structure calculations of both\nalternatives.\n", "  Employing a simplified version of the Israel-Stewart formalism of\ngeneral-relativistic shear-viscous hydrodynamics, we explore the evolution of a\nremnant massive neutron star of binary neutron star merger and pay special\nattention to the resulting gravitational waveforms. We find that for the\nplausible values of the so-called viscous alpha parameter of the order\n$10^{-2}$, the degree of the differential rotation in the remnant massive\nneutron star is significantly reduced in the viscous timescale, $\\alt 5$\\,ms.\nAssociated with this, the degree of non-axisymmetric deformation is also\nreduced quickly, and as a consequence, the amplitude of quasi-periodic\ngravitational waves emitted also decays in the viscous timescale. Our results\nindicate that for modeling the evolution of the merger remnants of binary\nneutron stars, we would have to take into account magnetohydrodynamics effects,\nwhich in nature could provide the viscous effects.\n", "  We investigate the Lorentz symmetry breaking effects (LSBE) on the deflection\nof light by a rotating cosmic string spacetime in the weak limit approximation.\nWe first calculate the deflection angle by a static cosmic string for a fixed\nspacelike 4-vector case (FSL) with the corresponding effective-string optical\nmetric using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). Then, we focus on a more general\nscenario, namely we calculate the deflection angle by a rotating cosmic string\napplying the GBT to Randers effective-string metric. We obtain a significant\nmodification in the deflection angle because of the LSBE parameter. We find a\nfirst and second order correction terms due to the global effective topology\nwhich are proportional to the cosmic string and LSBE parameter, respectively.\nFinally, for a fixed time-like 4-vector (FTL) case, we show that the deflection\nangle is not affetced by LSBE parameter.\n", "  We consider a model of non-Markovian Quantum Brownian motion that consists of\nan harmonic oscillator bilinearly coupled to a thermal bath, both via its\nposition and momentum operators. We derive the master equation for such a model\nand we solve the equations of motion for a generic Gaussian system state. We\nthen investigate the resulting evolution of the first and second moments for\nboth an Ohmic and a super-Ohmic spectral density. In particular, we show that,\nirrespective of the specific form of the spectral density, the coupling with\nthe momentum enhances the dissipation experienced by the system, accelerating\nits relaxation to the equilibrium, as well as modifying the asymptotic state of\nthe dynamics. Eventually, we characterize explicitly the non-Markovianity of\nthe evolution, using a general criterion which relies on the positivity of the\nmaster equation coefficients.\n", "  We propose a Pati-Salam extension of the standard model incorporating a\nflavor symmetry based on the $\\Delta \\left( 27\\right)$ group. The theory\nrealizes a realistic Froggatt-Nielsen picture of quark mixing and a predictive\npattern of neutrino oscillations. We find that, for normal neutrino mass\nordering, the atmospheric angle must lie in the higher octant, CP must be\nviolated in oscillations, and there is a lower bound for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay rate. For the case of inverted mass ordering, we find that the lower\natmospheric octant is preferred, and that CP can be conserved in oscillations.\nNeutrino masses arise from a low-scale seesaw mechanism, whose messengers can\nbe produced by a $Z^{\\prime }$ portal at the LHC.\n", "  Determining the physical mechanisms that extract energy from turbulent\nfluctuations in weakly collisional magnetized plasmas is necessary for a more\ncomplete characterization of the behavior of a variety of space and\nastrophysical plasmas. Such a determination is complicated by the complex\nnature of the turbulence as well as observational constraints, chiefly that in\nsitu measurements of such plasmas are typically only available at a single\npoint in space. Recent work has shown that correlations between electric fields\nand particle velocity distributions constructed from single-point measurements\nproduce a velocity-dependent signature of the collisionless damping mechanism.\nWe extend this work by constructing field-particle correlations using data sets\ndrawn from single points in strongly driven, turbulent, electromagnetic\ngyrokinetic simulations to demonstrate that this technique can identify the\ncollisionless mechanisms operating in such systems. The correlation's\nvelocity-space structure agrees with expectations of resonant mechanisms\ntransferring energy collisionlessly in turbulent systems. This work motivates\nthe eventual application of field-particle correlations to spacecraft\nmeasurements in the solar wind, with the ultimate goal to determine the\nphysical mechanisms that dissipate magnetized plasma turbulence.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to understand the formation of the OI line at 7772\n\\AA\\ in the solar chromosphere. We used SST/CRISP observations to observe OI\n7772 \\AA\\ in several places around the solar limb. We compared the observations\nwith synthetic spectra calculated with the RH code in the one-dimension\nspherical geometry mode. New accurate hydrogen collisional rates were included\nfor the RH calculations. The observations reveal a dark gap in the lower\nchromosphere, which is caused by variations in the line opacity as shown by our\nmodels. The lower level of the 7772 \\AA\\ transition is populated by a downward\ncascade from the continuum. We study the effect of Lyman-$\\beta$ pumping and\nhydrogen collisions between the triplet and quintet system in OI. Both have a\nsmall but non-negligible influence on the line intensity.\n", "  We employ the generic three-wave system, with the $\\chi ^{(2)}$ interaction\nbetween two components of the fundamental-frequency (FF) wave and\nsecond-harmonic (SH) one, to consider collisions of truncated Airy waves (TAWs)\nand three-wave solitons in a setting which is not available in other nonlinear\nsystems. The advantage is that the single-wave TAWs, carried by either one of\nthe FF component, are not distorted by the nonlinearity and are stable,\nthree-wave solitons being stable too in the same system. The collision between\nmutually symmetric TAWs, carried by the different FF components, transforms\nthem into a set of solitons, the number of which decreases with the increase of\nthe total power. The TAW absorbs an incident small-power soliton, and a\nhigh-power soliton absorbs the TAW. Between these limits, the collision with an\nincident soliton converts the TAW into two solitons, with a remnant of the TAW\nattached to one of them, or leads to formation of a complex TAW-soliton bound\nstate. At large velocities, the collisions become quasi-elastic.\n", "  It is known that the expectation value of Wilson loops in the\nGross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) unitary matrix model can be computed exactly at finite\n$N$ for arbitrary representations. We study the perturbative and\nnon-perturbative corrections of Wilson loops in the $1/N$ expansion, either\nanalytically or numerically using the exact result at finite $N$. As a\nby-product of the exact result of Wilson loops, we propose a large $N$ master\nfield of GWW model. This master field has an interesting eigenvalue\ndistribution. We also study the Wilson loops in large representations, called\nGiant Wilson loops, and comment on the Hagedorn/deconfinement transition of a\nunitary matrix model with a double trace interaction.\n", "  The linear properties of the geodesic acoustic modes (GAM) in tokamaks are\ninvestigated by means of the comparison of analytical theory and gyrokinetic\nnumerical simulations. The dependence on the value of the safety factor,\nfinite-orbit-width of the ions in relation to the radial mode width,\nmagnetic-flux-surface shaping, and electron/ion mass ratio are considered.\nNonuniformities in the plasma profiles (such as density, temperature, or safety\nfactor), electro-magnetic effects, collisions and presence of minority species\nare neglected. Also, only linear simulations are considered, focusing on the\nlocal dynamics. We use three different gyrokinetic codes: the lagrangian\n(particle-in-cell) code ORB5, the eulerian code GENE and semi-lagrangian code\nGYSELA. One of the main aims of this paper is to provide a detailed comparison\nof the numerical results and analytical theory, in the regimes where this is\npossible. This helps understanding better the behavior of the linear GAM\ndynamics in these different regimes, the behavior of the codes, which is\ncrucial in the view of a future work where more physics is present, and the\nregimes of validity of each specific analytical dispersion relation.\n", "  Capacitively coupled radio-frequency (CCRF) CF_4 plasmas have been found to\nexhibit a self-organized striated structure at operating conditions, where the\nplasma is strongly electronegative and the ion-ion plasma in the bulk region\n(largely composed of CF_3^+ and F^- ions) resonates with the excitation\nfrequency. In this work we explore the effects of the gas pressure, the RF\nvoltage, and the electrode gap on this striated structure by Phase Resolved\nOptical Emission Spectroscopy and Particle-In-Cell/Monte Carlo Collisions\nsimulations. The measured electronic excitation patterns at different external\nparameters show a good general agreement with the spatio-temporal plots of the\nionization rate obtained from the simulations. For a fixed driving frequency\nthe minima of the CF_3^+ and F^- ion densities (between the density peaks in\nthe bulk) are comparable and independent of other external parameters. However,\nthe ion density maxima generally increase as a function of the pressure or RF\nvoltage, leading to the enhanced spatial modulation of plasma parameters. The\nstriation gap (defined as the distance between two ion density peaks) is\napproximately inversely proportional to the pressure, while it exhibits a weak\ndependence on the RF voltage and the electrode gap. A transition between the\nstriated and non-striated modes can be observed by changing either the pressure\nor the RF voltage; for 13.56 MHz and 18 MHz driving frequencies we present a\nphase diagram as a function of the pressure and voltage amplitude parameters.\n", "  We compare predictions of nCTEQ15 nuclear parton distribution functions with\nproton-lead vector boson production data from the LHC. We select data sets that\nare most sensitive to nuclear PDFs and have potential to constrain them. We\nidentify the kinematic regions and flavours where these data can bring new\ninformation and will have largest impact on the nuclear PDFs. Finally, we\nestimate the effect of including these data in a global analysis using a\nreweighting method.\n", "  We present a new analysis of the PG quasar sample based on Spitzer and\nHerschel observations. (I) Assuming PAH-based star formation luminosities\n(L_SF) similar to Symeonidis et al. (2016, S16), we find mean and median\nintrinsic AGN spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These, in the FIR, appear\nhotter and significantly less luminous than the S16 mean intrinsic AGN SED. The\ndifferences are mostly due to our normalization of the individual SEDs, that\nproperly accounts for a small number of very FIR-luminous quasars. Our median,\nPAH-based SED represents ~ 6% increase on the 1-243 micron luminosity of the\nextended Mor & Netzer (2012, EM12) torus SED, while S16 find a significantly\nlarger difference. It requires large-scale dust with T ~ 20 -- 30 K which, if\noptically thin and heated by the AGN, would be outside the host galaxy. (II) We\nalso explore the black hole and stellar mass growths, using L_SF estimates from\nfitting Herschel/PACS observations after subtracting the EM12 torus\ncontribution. We use rough estimates of stellar mass, based on scaling\nrelations, to divide our sample into groups: on, below and above the star\nformation main sequence (SFMS). Objects on the SFMS show a strong correlation\nbetween star formation luminosity and AGN bolometric luminosity, with a\nlogarithmic slope of ~ 0.7. Finally we derive the relative duty cycles of this\nand another sample of very luminous AGN at z = 2 -- 3.5. Large differences in\nthis quantity indicate different evolutionary pathways for these two\npopulations characterised by significantly different black hole masses.\n", "  By considering the realization of the emergent universe scenario in\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, we study the stability of the\nEinstein static universe filled with perfect fluid in EiBI theory against both\nthe homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar perturbations in this work. We find\nthat in both the spatially flat and closed cases, the emergent universe\nscenario is no longer viable, since the Einstein static universe cannot be\nstable against both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar perturbations\nsimultaneously. However, the emergent universe scenario survives in the\nspatially open case, while the Einstein static universe can be stable under\nsome conditions.\n", "  Recent diffraction experiments on metallic glasses have unveiled an\nunexpected non-cubic scaling law between density and average interatomic\ndistance, which lead to the speculations on the presence of fractal glass\norder. Using X-ray tomography we identify here a similar non-cubic scaling law\nin disordered granular packing of spherical particles. We find that the scaling\nlaw is directly related to the contact neighbors within first nearest neighbor\nshell, and therefore is closely connected to the phenomenon of jamming. The\nseemingly universal scaling exponent around 2.5 arises due to the isostatic\ncondition with contact number around 6, and we argue that the exponent should\nnot be universal.\n", "  The far-field pattern of a simple one-dimensional laser array of emitters\nradiating into free space is considered. In the path of investigating the\ninverse problem for their near fields leading to a target beam form,\nsurprisingly we found that the result is successful when the matrix of the\ncorresponding linear system is not well-scaled. The essence of our numerical\nobservations is captured by an elegant inequality defining the functional range\nof the optical distance between two neighboring emitters. Our finding can\nrestrict substantially the parametric space of integrated photonic systems and\nsimplify significantly the subsequent optimizations.\n", "  We construct several towers of scalar quantum field theories with an $O(N)$\nsymmetry which have higher derivative kinetic terms. The Lagrangians in each\ntower are connected by lying in the same universality class at the\n$d$-dimensional Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Moreover the universal theory is\nstudied using the large $N$ expansion and we determine $d$-dimensional critical\nexponents to $O(1/N^2)$. We show that these new universality classes emerge\nnaturally as solutions to the linear relation of the dimensions of the fields\ndeduced from the underlying force-matter interaction of the universal critical\ntheory. To substantiate the equivalence of the Lagrangians in each tower we\nrenormalize each to several loop orders and show that the renormalization group\nfunctions are consistent with the large $N$ critical exponents. While we focus\non the first two new towers of theories and renormalize the respective\nLagrangians to $16$ and $18$ dimensions there are an infinite number of such\ntowers. We also briefly discuss the conformal windows and the extension of the\nideas to theories with spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ and spin-$1$ fields as well as the\nidea of lower dimension completeness.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the Standard Model (SM) with one family of\nvector-like (VL) leptons, which couple to all three families of the SM leptons.\nWe study the constraints on this model coming from the heavy charged lepton\nmass bound, electroweak precision data, the muon anomalous magnetic moment,\nlepton flavor violation, Higgs decay constraints and a recently measured lepton\nnon-universality observable, $R_{K^{*0}}$. We find that the strongest\nconstraints are coming from the muon $g-2, \\\nR_{\\mu\\mu}=\\Gamma(h\\to\\mu\\mu)/\\Gamma(h\\to\\mu\\mu)_\\text{SM}, \\ R_{\\gamma\\gamma}$\nand $\\text{BR}(\\mu\\to e\\gamma)$. Although VL leptons couple to all three\nfamilies of the SM leptons, the ratio of electron-VL to muon-VL coupling is\nconstrained to be $\\langle\\lambda_e/\\lambda_\\mu\\rangle\\lesssim10^{-4}$. We also\nfind that our model cannot fit the observed value of $R_{K^{*0}}$.\n", "  Utilizing concepts from dynamical systems theory, we demonstrate how the\nexistence of light rings, or fixed points, in a spacetime will give rise to\nfamilies of periodic orbits and invariant manifolds in phase space. It is shown\nthat these structures define the shape of the black hole shadow as well as a\nnumber of salient features of the spacetime lensing. We illustrate this through\nthe analysis of lensing by a hairy black hole.\n", "  A no-hair theorem for spherical black holes in scalar-tensor gravity is\npresented. Contrary to the existing theorems, which are proved in the Einstein\nconformal frame, this proof is performed entirely in the Jordan frame. The\ntheorem is limited to spherical symmetry (instead of axisymmetry) but holds for\nnon-constant Brans-Dicke couplings.\n", "  We have searched for proton decays into a charged antilepton ($e^+$, $\\mu^+$)\nplus a meson ($\\eta$, $\\rho^0$, $\\omega$) and neutron decays into a charged\nantilepton ($e^+$, $\\mu^+$) plus a meson ($\\pi^-$, $\\rho^-$) using\nSuper-Kamiokande (SK) I-IV data, corresponding to 0.316 megaton$\\cdot$years of\nexposure. This measurement updates the previous published result by using 2.26\ntimes more data and improved analysis methods. No significant evidence for\nnucleon decay has been observed and lower limits on the partial lifetime of the\nnucleon are obtained. The limits range from 3$\\times$10$^{31}$ to\n1$\\times$10$^{34}$ years at 90% confidence level, depending on the decay mode.\n", "  We consider a helical spin liquid system which shows majorana fermion modes\nat the edge. The interaction between the quasiparticles in this system induces\nphase transition, Majorana-Ising transition. We comply the density matrix\nrenormalization group method to study this phase transition for the entire\nregime of the parameter space. We observe the presence of topological quantum\nphase transition for repulsive interaction, however this phase is more stable\nfor the attractive interaction. The length scale dependent study shows many new\nand important results and we show explicitly that the major contribution to the\nexcitation comes from the edge of the system when the system is in the\ntopological state. We also show the dependence of Majorana localization length\nfor various values of chemical potential.\n", "  Recent simulations and observations have shown large scale filaments in the\ncosmic web connecting nodes, with accreting materials (baryonic and dark\nmatter) flowing through them. Current high sensitivity observations also show\nthat the propagation of shocks through filaments can heat them up, and make\nfilaments visible between two or more galaxy clusters or around massive\nclusters, based on optical and/or X-ray observations. We are reporting here the\nspecial case of the cluster A3017 associated with a hot filament. The\ntemperature of the filament is 3.4$^{-0.77}_{+1.30}$ ~keV and its length is\n$\\sim$ 1 Mpc. We have analysed its archival {\\it Chandra} data and report\nvarious properties. We also analysed GMRT 235/610 MHz radio data. Radio\nobservations have revealed symmetric two-sided lobes which fill cavities in the\nA3017 cluster core region, associated with central AGN. In the radio map, we\nalso noticed a peculiar linear vertical radio structure in the X-ray filament\nregion which might be associated with a cosmic filament shock. This radio\nstructure could be a radio phoenix or old plasma where an old relativistic\npopulation is re-accelerated by shock propagation. Finally we put an upper\nlimit on the radio luminosity of the filament region.\n", "  We use the sensitive response to electric fields of Rydberg atoms to\ncharacterize all three vector components of the local electric field close to\nan atom-chip surface. We measured Stark-Zeeman maps of $S$ and $D$ Rydberg\nstates using an elongated cloud of ultracold Rubidium atoms ($T\\sim2.5$ $\\mu$K)\ntrapped magnetically $100$ $\\mu$m from the chip surface. The spectroscopy of\n$S$ states yields a calibration for the generated local electric field at the\nposition of the atoms. The values for different components of the field are\nextracted from the more complex response of $D$ states to the combined electric\nand magnetic fields. From the analysis we find residual fields in the two\nuncompensated directions of $0.0\\pm0.2$ V/cm and $1.98\\pm0.09$ V/cm\nrespectively. This method also allows us to extract a value for the relevant\nfield gradient along the long axis of the cloud. The manipulation of electric\nfields and the magnetic trapping are both done using on-chip wires, making this\nsetup a promising candidate to observe Rydberg-mediated interactions on a chip.\n", "  We show that, contrary to what is usually claimed in the literature, the zero\nmass limit of Kerr spacetime is not flat Minkowski space but a spacetime whose\ngeometry is only locally flat. This limiting spacetime, as the Kerr spacetime\nitself, contains two asymptotic regions and hence cannot be topologically\ntrivial. It also contains a curvature singularity, because the power-law\nsingularity of the Weyl tensor vanishes in the limit but there remains a\ndistributional contribution of the Ricci tensor. This spacetime can be\ninterpreted as a wormhole sourced by a negative tension ring. We also extend\nthe discussion to similarly interpret the zero mass limit of the Kerr-(anti)-de\nSitter spacetime.\n", "  We study spin-orbit torques (SOT) in non-degenerate multiband electron\nsystems in the weak disorder limit. In order to have better physical\ntransparency a semiclassical Boltzmann approach equivalent to the Kubo\ndiagrammatic approach in the non-crossing approximation is formulated. This\nsemiclassical framework accounts for the interband- coherence effects induced\nby both the electric field and static impurity scattering. Using the\ntwo-dimensional Rashba ferromagnet as a model system, we show that the\nantidamping-like SOT arising from disorder-induced interband-coherence effects\nis very sensitive to the spin structure of disorder and may have the same sign\nas the intrinsic SOT in the presence of spin-dependent disorder. While the\ncancellation of this SOT and the intrinsic one occurs only in the case of\nspin-independent short-range disorder.\n", "  We study the matrix elements of few-body observables, focusing on the\noff-diagonal ones, in the eigenstates of the two-dimensional transverse field\nIsing model. By resolving all symmetries, we relate the onset of quantum chaos\nto the structure of the matrix elements. In particular, we show that a general\nresult of the theory of random matrices, namely, the value 2 of the ratio of\nvariances (diagonal to off-diagonal) of the matrix elements of Hermitian\noperators, occurs in the quantum chaotic regime. Furthermore, we explore the\nbehavior of the off-diagonal matrix elements of observables as a function of\nthe eigenstate energy differences, and show that it is in accordance with the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis ansatz.\n", "  Assuming that the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal from a $^{13}$C\nisotope enriched layer of graphene can be made sufficiently intense to be\nmeasured, we compute the NMR\\ lineshape of the different crystals ground states\nthat are expected to occur in graphene in a strong magnetic field. We first\nshow that in nonuniform states, there is, in addition to the frequency shift\ndue to the spin hyperfine interaction, a second contribution of equal\nimportance from the coupling between the orbital motion of the electrons and\nthe nuclei. We then show that, if the linewidth of the bare signal can be made\nsufficiently small, the Wigner and bubble crystals have line shapes that differ\nqualitatively from that of the uniform state at the same density while crystal\nstates that have spin or valley pseudospin textures do not. Finally, we find\nthat a relatively small value of the bare linewidth is sufficient to wash out\nthe distinctive signature of the crystal states in the NMR line shape.\n", "  We report the serendipitous discovery of the first gravitationally lensed\nquasar candidate from Pan-STARRS. The grizy images reveal four point-like\nimages with magnitudes between 14.9 mag and 18.1 mag. The colors of the point\nsources are similar, and they are more consistent with quasars than with stars\nor galaxies. The lensing galaxy is detected in the izy bands, with an inferred\nphotometric redshift of ~0.6, lower than that of the point sources. We\nsuccessfully model the system with a singular isothermal ellipsoid with shear,\nusing the relative positions of the five objects as constraints. While the\nbrightness ranking of the point sources is consistent with that of the model,\nwe find discrepancies between the model-predicted and observed fluxes, likely\ndue to microlensing by stars and millilensing due to the dark matter\nsubstructure. In order to fully confirm the gravitational lens nature of this\nsystem and add it to the small but growing number of the powerful probes of\ncosmology and astrophysics represented by quadruply lensed quasars, we require\nfurther spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging.\n", "  We report on the first integration of an antiferromagnetic Heusler compound\nacting as a pinning layer into magnetic tunneling junctions. The\nantiferromagnet Ru$_2$MnGe is used to pin the magnetization direction of a\nferromagnetic Fe layer in MgO based thin film tunnelling magnetoresistance\nstacks. The samples were prepared using magnetron co-sputtering. We investigate\nthe structural properties by X-ray diffraction and reflection, as well as\natomic force and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We find an\nexcellent crystal growth quality with low interface roughnesses of 1-3 \\r{A},\nwhich is crucial for the preparation of working tunnelling barriers. Using Fe\nas a ferromagnetic electrode material we prepared magnetic tunneling junctions\nand measured the magnetoresistance. We find a sizeable maximum\nmagnetoresistance value of 135%, which is comparable to other common Fe based\nMTJ systems.\n", "  Supernova explosions are inherently asymmetric and can accelerate new-born\nneutron stars (NSs) to hundreds of km/s. Two prevailing theories to explain NS\nkicks are ejecta asymmetries (e.g., conservation of momentum between NS and\nejecta) and anisotropic neutrino emission. Observations of supernova remnants\n(SNRs) can give us insights into the mechanism that generates these NS kicks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the relationship between NS kick velocities and\nthe X-ray morphologies of 18 SNRs observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory\nand the Rontgen Satellite (ROSAT). We measure SNR asymmetries using the\npower-ratio method (a multipole expansion technique), focusing on the dipole,\nquadrupole, and octupole power-ratios. Our results show no correlation between\nthe magnitude of the power-ratios and NS kick velocities, but we find that for\nCas A and G292.0+1.8, whose emission traces the ejecta distribution, their NSs\nare preferentially moving opposite to the bulk of the X-ray emission. In\naddition, we find a similar result for PKS 1209-51, CTB 109, and Puppis A;\nhowever their emission is dominated by circumstellar/interstellar material, so\ntheir asymmetries may not reflect their ejecta distributions. Our results are\nconsistent with the theory that NS kicks are a consequence of ejecta\nasymmetries as opposed to anisotropic neutrino emission. In the future,\nadditional observations to measure NS proper motions within ejecta-dominated\nSNRs are necessary to constrain robustly the NS kick mechanism.\n", "  We study the existence of the maximal quantum Fisher information matrix in\nmulti-parameter quantum estimation, which bounds the ultimate precision limit.\nWe show that when the maximal quantum Fisher information matrix exists, it can\nbe directly obtained from the underlying dynamics. Examples are then provided\nto demonstrate the usefulness of the maximal quantum Fisher information matrix\nby deriving various tradeoff relations in multi-parameter quantum estimation\nand obtaining the bounds for the scalings of the precision limit.\n", "  In this work, expanded solutions of force-free magnetospheres on general Kerr\nblack holes are derived through a radial distance expansion method. From the\nregular conditions both at the horizon and at spatial infinity, two previously\nknown asymptotical solutions (one of them is actually an exact solution) are\nidentified as the only solutions that satisfy the same conditions at the two\nboundaries. Taking them as initial conditions at the boundaries, expanded\nsolutions up to the first few orders are derived by solving the stream equation\norder by order. It is shown that our extension of the exact solution can\n(partially) cure the problems of the solution: it leads to magnetic domination\nand a mostly timelike current for restricted parameters.\n", "  Radiation hardness is an important requirement for solid state readout\ndevices operating in high radiation environments common in particle physics\nexperiments. The MEGII experiment, at PSI, Switzerland, investigates the\nforbidden decay $\\mu^+ \\to \\mathrm{e}^+ \\gamma$. Exploiting the most intense\nmuon beam of the world. A significant flux of non-thermal neutrons (kinetic\nenergy $E_k\\geq 0.5 ~MeV$) is present in the experimental hall produced along\nthe beamline and in the hall itself. We present the effects of neutron fluxes\ncomparable to the MEGII expected doses on several Silicon PhotoMulitpliers\n(SiPMs). The tested models are: AdvanSiD ASD-NUV3S-P50 (used in MEGII\nexperiment), AdvanSiD ASD-NUV3S-P40, AdvanSiD ASD-RGB3S-P40, Hamamatsu and\nExcelitas C30742-33-050-X. The neutron source is the thermal Sub-critical\nMultiplication complex (SM1) moderated with water, located at the University of\nPavia (Italy). We report the change of SiPMs most important electric\nparameters: dark current, dark pulse frequency, gain, direct bias resistance,\nas a function of the integrated neutron fluency.\n", "  We report the results of a first experimental search for lepton number\nviolation by four units in the neutrinoless quadruple-$\\beta$ decay of\n$^{150}$Nd using a total exposure of $0.19$ kg$\\cdot$y recorded with the NEMO-3\ndetector at the Modane Underground Laboratory (LSM). We find no evidence of\nthis decay and set lower limits on the half-life in the range\n$T_{1/2}>(1.1-3.2)\\times10^{21}$ y at the $90\\%$ CL, depending on the model\nused for the kinematic distributions of the emitted electrons.\n", "  We use a Kubo formalism to calculate both A.C. conductivity and D.C.\ntransport properties of a dirty nodal loop semimetal. The optical conductivity\nas a function of photon energy $\\Omega $, exhibits an extended flat background\n$\\sigma^{BG}$ as in graphene provided the scattering rate $\\Gamma$ is small as\ncompared to the radius of the nodal ring $b$ (in energy units). Modifications\nto the constant background arise for $\\Omega\\le \\Gamma $ and the minimum D.C.\nconductivity $\\sigma^{DC} $ which is approached as $\\Omega^2/\\Gamma^2$ as\n$\\Omega\\rightarrow0$, is found to be proportional to\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{\\Gamma^2+b^2}}{v_{F}}$ with $v_{F}$ the Fermi velocity. For $b=0$\nwe recover the known three-dimensional point node Dirac result $\\sigma^{DC}\\sim\n\\frac{\\Gamma}{v_{F}}$ while for $b>\\Gamma$, $\\sigma^{DC}$ becomes independent\nof $\\Gamma$ (universal) and the ratio\n$\\frac{\\sigma^{DC}}{\\sigma^{BG}}=\\frac{8}{\\pi^2}$ where all reference to\nmaterial parameters has dropped out. As $b$ is reduced and becomes of the order\n$\\Gamma$, the flat background is lost as the optical response evolves towards\nthat of a three-dimensional point node Dirac semimetal which is linear in\n$\\Omega$ for the clean limit. For finite $\\Gamma$ there are modifications from\nlinearity in the photon region $\\Omega\\le \\Gamma$. When the chemical potential\n$\\mu$ (temperature $T$) is nonzero the D.C. conductivity increases as\n$\\mu^2/\\Gamma^2$($T^2/\\Gamma^2$) for $\\mu/\\Gamma$ $(T/\\Gamma)\\le 1$. For larger\nvalues of $\\mu>\\Gamma$ away from the nodal region the conductivity shows a\nDrude like contribution about $\\Omega\\approxeq 0$ which is followed by a dip in\nthe Pauli blocked region $\\Omega \\le 2\\mu$ after which it increases to merge\nwith the flat background (two-dimensional graphene like) for $\\mu< b$ and to\nthe quasilinear (three-dimensional point node Dirac) law for $\\mu> b$.\n", "  Vector-like fermions charged under both the Standard Model and a new dark\ngauge group arise in many theories of new physics. If these fermions include an\nelectroweak doublet and singlet with equal dark charges, they can potentially\nconnect to the Higgs field through a Yukawa coupling in analogy to the standard\nneutrino portal. With such a coupling, fermion loops generate exotic decays of\nthe Higgs boson to one or more dark vector bosons. In this work we study a\nminimal realization of this scenario with an Abelian dark group. We investigate\nthe potential new Higgs decays modes, we compute their rates, and we study the\nprospects for observing them at the Large Hadron Collider and beyond given the\nother experimental constraints on the theory. We also discuss extensions of the\ntheory to non-Abelian dark groups.\n", "  Electrical currents in a magnetic insulator/heavy metal heterostructure can\ninduce two simultaneous effects, namely, spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) on\nthe heavy metal side and spin-orbit torques (SOTs) on the magnetic insulator\nside. Within the framework of the pure spin current model based on the bulk\nspin Hall effect (SHE), the ratio of the spin Hall-induced anomalous Hall\neffect (SH-AHE) to SMR should be equal to the ratio of the field-like torque\n(FLT) to damping-like torque (DLT). We perform a quantitative study of SMR,\nSH-AHE, and SOTs in a series of thulium iron garnet/platinum or Tm3Fe5O12/Pt\nheterostructures with different Tm3Fe5O12 thicknesses, where Tm3Fe5O12 is a\nferrimagnetic insulator with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We find the\nratio between measured effective fields of FLT and DLT is at least 2 times\nlarger than the ratio of the SH-AHE to SMR. In addition, the bulk SHE model\ngrossly underestimates the spin torque efficiency of FLT. Our results reveal\ndeficiencies of the bulk SHE model and also address the importance of\ninterfacial effects such as the Rashba and magnetic proximity effects in\nmagnetic insulator/heavy metal heterostructures.\n", "  The scalar potential of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) may have more than\none local minimum and the usually considered vacuum could be located at one of\nthem that could decay to another. This paper studies the condition that the\nusually considered vacuum is the global minimum which, combined with the\nbounded-from-below condition, will stabilize the vacuum at tree-level. We\nfurther apply these conditions to a specific 2HDM and obtain new constraints\nwhich could be important in phenomenological studies.\n", "  Fabrication of sub-micron Josephson junctions is demonstrated using standard\nprocessing techniques for high-coherence, superconducting qubits. These\njunctions are made in two separate lithography steps with normal-angle\nevaporation. Most significantly, this work demonstrates that it is possible to\nachieve high coherence with junctions formed on aluminum surfaces cleaned in\nsitu with Ar milling before the junction oxidation. This method eliminates the\nangle-dependent shadow masks typically used for small junctions. Therefore,\nthis is conducive to the implementation of typical methods for improving\nmargins and yield using conventional CMOS processing. The current method uses\nelectron-beam lithography and an additive process to define the top and bottom\nelectrodes. Extension of this work to optical lithography and subtractive\nprocesses is discussed.\n", "  Ring resonators provide a means of filtering specific wavelengths from a\nwaveguide, and optionally dropping the filtered wavelengths into a second\nwaveguide. Both of these features are potentially useful for astronomical\ninstruments.\n  In this paper we focus on their use as notch filters to remove the signal\nfrom atmospheric OH emission lines from astronomical spectra, however we also\nbriefly discuss their use as frequency combs for wavelength calibration and as\ndrop filters for Doppler planet searches.\n  We derive the design requirements for ring resonators for OH suppression from\ntheory and finite difference time domain simulations. We find that rings with\nsmall radii (<10 microns) are required to provide an adequate free spectral\nrange, leading to high index contrast materials such as Si and Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$.\nCritically coupled rings with high self-coupling coefficients should provide\nthe necessary Q factors, suppression depth, and throughput for efficient OH\nsuppression.\n  We report on our progress in fabricating both Si and Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ rings\nfor OH suppression, and give results from preliminary laboratory tests. Our\nearly devices show good control over the free spectral range and wavelength\nseparation of multi-ring devices. The self-coupling coefficients are high\n(>0.9), but further optimisation is required to achieve higher Q and deeper\nnotches, with current devices having $Q \\approx 4000$ and $\\approx 10$ dB\nsuppression. The overall prospects for the use of ring resonators in\nastronomical instruments is promising, provided efficient fibre-chip coupling\ncan be achieved.\n", "  We have used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to resolve the\nspatial variation of the density of states of twisted graphene layers on top of\na highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrate. Owing to the twist a moire\npattern develops with a periodicity that is substantially larger than the\nperiodicity of a single layer graphene. The twisted graphene layer has\nelectronic properties that are distinctly different from that of a single layer\ngraphene due to the nonzero interlayer coupling. For small twist angles (about\n1-3.5 degree) the integrated differential conductivity spectrum exhibits two\nwell-defined Van Hove singularities. Spatial maps of the differential\nconductivity that are recorded at energies near the Fermi level exhibit a\nhoneycomb structure that is comprised of two inequivalent hexagonal\nsub-lattices. For energies |E-E_F|>0.3 eV the hexagonal structure in the\ndifferential conductivity maps vanishes. We have performed tight-binding\ncalculations of the twisted graphene system using the propagation method, in\nwhich a third graphene layer is added to mimic the substrate. This third layer\nlowers the symmetry and explains the development of the two hexagonal\nsub-lattices in the moire pattern. Our experimental results are in excellent\nagreement with the tight-binding calculations.\n", "  We report results of systematic analysis of various modes in the flatband\nlattice, based on the diamond-chain model with the on-site cubic nonlinearity,\nand its double version with the linear on-site mixing between the two lattice\nfields. In the single-chain system, a full analysis is presented, first, for\nthe single nonlinear cell, making it possible to find all stationary states,\nviz., antisymmetric, symmetric, and asymmetric ones, including an exactly\ninvestigated symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the subcritical type. In the\nnonlinear infinite single-component chain, compact localized states (CLSs) are\nfound in an exact form too, as an extension of known compact eigenstates of the\nlinear diamond chain. Their stability is studied by means of analytical and\nnumerical methods, revealing a nontrivial stability boundary. In addition to\nthe CLSs, various species of extended states and exponentially localized\nlattice solitons of symmetric and asymmetric types are studied too, by means of\nnumerical calculations and variational approximation. As a result, existence\nand stability areas are identified for these modes. Finally, the linear version\nof the double diamond chain is solved in an exact form, producing two split\nflatbands in the system's spectrum.\n", "  This article is a brief introduction to the rapidly evolving field of\nmany-body localization. Rather than giving an in-depth review of the subject,\nour aspiration here is simply to introduce the problem and its general context,\noutlining a few directions where notable progress has been achieved in recent\nyears. We hope that this will prepare the readers for the more specialized\narticles appearing in the forthcoming dedicated volume of Annalen der Physik,\nwhere these developments are discussed in more detail.\n", "  The absence of a true thermodynamical equilibrium for an observer located in\nthe causal area of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime has repeatedly raised\nthe question of the correct definition of its temperature. In this work, we\nconsider five different temperatures for a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-de\nSitter black hole: the bare $T_0$, the normalised $T_{BH}$ and three effective\nones given in terms of both the black hole and cosmological horizon\ntemperatures. We find that these five temperatures exhibit similarities but\nalso significant differences in their behaviour as the number of extra\ndimensions and the value of the cosmological constant are varied. We then\ninvestigate their effect on the energy emission spectra of Hawking radiation.\nWe demonstrate that the radiation spectra for the normalised temperature\n$T_{BH}$ -- proposed by Bousso and Hawking over twenty years ago -- leads to\nthe dominant emission curve while the other temperatures either support a\nsignificant emission rate only at a specific $\\Lambda$ regime or they have\ntheir emission rates globally suppressed. Finally, we compute the\nbulk-over-brane emissivity ratio and show that the use of different\ntemperatures may lead to different conclusions regarding the brane or bulk\ndominance.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the RF linewidth and timing jitter over a wide\nrange of delay tuning in a self-mode-locked two-section quantum dash lasers\nemitting at ~ 1.55 micron and operating at ~ 21 GHz repetition rate subject to\nsingle and dual optical feedback into gain section. Various feedback conditions\nare investigated and optimum levels determined for narrowest linewidth and\nreduced timing jitter for both single and dual loop configurations. We\ndemonstrate that dual loop feedback, with the shorter feedback cavity tuned to\nbe fully resonant, followed by fine tuning of the phase of the longer feedback\ncavity, gives stable narrow RF spectra across the widest delay range, unlike\nsingle loop feedback. In addition, for dual loop configurations, under fully\nresonant conditions, integrated timing jitter is reduced from 3.9 ps to 295 fs\n[10 kHz-100 MHz], the RF linewidth narrows from 100 kHz to < 1 kHz, with more\nthan 30 dB fundamental side-mode suppression. We show that dual loop optical\nfeedback with separate fine tuning of both external cavities is far superior to\nsingle loop feedback, with increased system tolerance against phase delay\nmismatch, making it a robust and cost-effective technique for developing\npractical, reliable and low-noise mode-locked lasers, optoelectronic\noscillators and pulsed photonic circuits.\n", "  In this work we have used the recent cosmic chronometers data along with the\nlatest estimation of the local Hubble parameter value, $H_0$ at 2.4\\% precision\nas well as the standard dark energy probes, such as the Supernovae Type Ia,\nbaryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, and cosmic microwave\nbackground measurements (PlanckTT $+$ lowP) to constrain a dark energy model\nwhere the dark energy is allowed to interact with the dark matter. A general\nequation of state of dark energy parametrized by a dimensionless parameter\n`$\\beta$' is utilized. From our analysis, we find that the interaction is\ncompatible with zero within the 1$\\sigma$ confidence limit. We also show that\nthe same evolution history can be reproduced by a small pressure of the dark\nmatter.\n", "  As part of the Accretion Discs in H$\\alpha$ with OmegaCAM (ADHOC) survey, we\nimaged in r, i and H-alpha a region of 12x8 square degrees around the Orion\nNebula Cluster. Thanks to the high-quality photometry obtained, we discovered\nthree well-separated pre-main sequences in the color-magnitude diagram. The\npopulations are all concentrated towards the cluster's center. Although several\nexplanations can be invoked to explain these sequences we are left with two\ncompetitive, but intriguing, scenarios: a population of unresolved binaries\nwith an exotic mass ratio distribution or three populations with different\nages. Independent high-resolution spectroscopy supports the presence of\ndiscrete episodes of star formation, each separated by about a million years.\nThe stars from the two putative youngest populations rotate faster than the\nolder ones, in agreement with the evolution of stellar rotation observed in\npre-main sequence stars younger than 4 Myr in several star forming regions.\nWhatever the final explanation, our results prompt for a revised look at the\nformation mode and early evolution of stars in clusters.\n", "  The impact of neutral impurity scattering of electrons on the charge drift\nmobility in high purity n-type germanium crystals at 77 Kelvin is investigated.\nWe calculated the contributions from ionized impurity scattering, lattice\nscattering, and neutral impurity scattering to the total charge drift mobility\nusing theoretical models. The experimental data such as charge carrier\nconcentration, mobility and resistivity are measured by Hall Effect system at\n77 Kelvin. The neutral impurity concentration is derived from the Matthiessen's\nrule using the measured Hall mobility and ionized impurity concentration. The\nradial distribution of the neutral impurity concentration in the self-grown\ncrystals is determined. Consequently, we demonstrated that neutral impurity\nscattering is a significant contribution to the charge drift mobility, which\nhas a dependence on the concentration of neutral impurities in high purity\nn-type germanium crystal.\n", "  The strong gravitational field around a proto-neutron star can modify the\nneutrino flavor transformations that occur above the neutrinosphere via three\nGeneral Relativistic (GR) effects: time dilation, energy redshift, and\ntrajectory bending. Depending on the compactness of the central object, the\nneutrino self-interaction potential is up to three times as large as that\nwithout GR principally due to trajectory bending which increases the\nintersection angles between different neutrino trajectories, and time dilation\nwhich changes the fluxes. We determine whether GR effects are important for\nflavor transformation during the different epochs of a supernova by using\nmulti-angle flavor transformation calculations and consider a density profile\nand neutrino spectra representative of both the accretion and cooling phases.\nWe find the GR effects are smaller during the accretion phase due to low\ncompactness of the proto-neutron star and merely delay the decoherence; the\nneutrino bipolar oscillations during the cooling phase are also delayed due to\nthe GR effects but the delay may be more important because the delay occurs at\nradii where it might alter the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind.\n", "  Electronic friction and the ensuing nonadiabatic energy loss play an\nimportant role in chemical reaction dynamics at metal surfaces. Using molecular\ndynamics with electronic friction evaluated on-the-fly from Density Functional\nTheory, we find strong mode dependence and a dominance of nonadiabatic energy\nloss along the bond stretch coordinate for scattering and dissociative\nchemisorption of H$_2$ on the Ag(111) surface. Exemplary trajectories with\nvarying initial conditions indicate that this mode-specificity translates into\nmodulated energy loss during a dissociative chemisorption event. Despite minor\nnonadiabatic energy loss of about 5\\%, the directionality of friction forces\ninduces dynamical steering that affects individual reaction outcomes,\nspecifically for low-incidence energies and vibrationally excited molecules.\nMode-specific friction induces enhanced loss of rovibrational rather than\ntranslational energy and will be most visible in its effect on final energy\ndistributions in molecular scattering experiments.\n", "  Bound states in the continuum (BICs) in photonic crystal slabs represent the\nresonances with an infinite quality(Q)-factor, occurring above the light line\nfor an infinitely periodic structure. We show that a set of BICs can turn into\nquasi-BICs with a very high Q-factor even for two or three unit cell\nstructures. They are explained by a viewpoint of BICs originating from the\ntight binding of individual resonances of each unit cell as in semiconductors.\nCombined with a reciprocal-space matching technique, the microcavities based on\nquasi-BICs can achieve a Q-factor as high as defect-based PhC microcavities.\nThese results may enable experimental studies of BICs in a compact platform as\nwell as realizing a new concept of high-Q mirrorless microcavities.\n", "  We report that the refractive index of transition metal dichacolgenide (TMDC)\nmonolayers, such as MoS2, WS2, and WSe2, can be substantially tuned by > 60% in\nthe imaginary part and > 20% in the real part around exciton resonances using\nCMOS-compatible electrical gating. This giant tunablility is rooted in the\ndominance of excitonic effects in the refractive index of the monolayers and\nthe strong susceptibility of the excitons to the influence of injected charge\ncarriers. The tunability mainly results from the effects of injected charge\ncarriers to broaden the spectral width of excitonic interband transitions and\nto facilitate the interconversion of neutral and charged excitons. The other\neffects of the injected charge carriers, such as renormalizing bandgap and\nchanging exciton binding energy, only play negligible roles. We also\ndemonstrate that the atomically thin monolayers, when combined with photonic\nstructures, can enable the efficiencies of optical absorption (reflection)\ntuned from 40% (60%) to 80% (20%) due to the giant tunability of refractive\nindex. This work may pave the way towards the development of field-effect\nphotonics in which the optical functionality can be controlled with CMOS\ncircuits.\n", "  We study the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of the CoFeB/MgO\nbilayers in contact with W, Ta, IrMn and Ti which has been suggested as the\nspin-orbit-torque-related underlayers. The saturation magnetization of the\nCoFeB depends on the underlayer materials due to formation of a dead-layer,\naffecting PMA strength of each film. The x-ray magnetic circular dichroism\nmeasurement reveals that the interfacial intermixing suppresses only the\nperpendicular orbital moment of Fe, while the intermixing simultaneously\nsuppresses both the perpendicular and in-plane orbital moments of Co.\n", "  In this paper we establish a connection between the onset temperature of\nglassy dynamics with the change in the entropy for a wide range of model\nsystems.\n  We identify the crossing temperature of pair and excess entropies as the\nonset temperature. Below the onset temperature, the residual multiparticle\nentropy(RMPE), the difference between excess and pair entropies, becomes\npositive. The positive entropy can be viewed as equivalent to the larger phase\nspace exploration of the system. The new method of onset temperature prediction\nfrom entropy is less ambiguous, as it does not depend on any fitting parameter\nlike the existing methods. Our study also reveals the connection between\nfragility and the degree of breakdown of the Stokes Einstein (SE) relation.\n", "  Transport measurements on the two dimensional electron system in Al2O3 SrTiO3\nheterostructures indicate significant noncrystalline anisotropic behavior below\nT = 30 K. Lattice dislocations in SrTiO3 and interfacial steps are suggested to\nbe the main sources for electronic anisotropy. Anisotropic defect scattering\nlikewise alters magnetoresistance at low temperature remarkably and influences\nspin-orbit coupling significantly by the Elliot Yafet mechanism of spin\nrelaxation resulting in anisotropic weak localization. Applying a magnetic\nfield parallel to the interface results in an additional field induced\nanisotropy of the conductance, which can be attributed to Rashba spin orbit\ninteraction. Compared to LaAlO3 SrTiO3, Rashba coupling seems to be reduced\nindicating a weaker polarity in Al2O3 SrTiO3 heterostructures.\n", "  We present a report of the MEG II experiment, the upgrade of MEG, whose goal\nis to search for the forbidden decay \\megc\\ with increased precision. After\nhaving briefly reviewed the motivation for such a search and the current limit\ndue to MEG, we present the conceptual design of the detector detailing for each\nsubdetector the motivations and the extent of the upgrade and the expected\nresolution improvements. Novel subdetectors and calibration hardware are\nintroduced. We conclude with the expected sensitivity of the MEGII experiment.\n", "  T2K (Tokai-to-Kamioka) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment in Japan\ndesigned to study various parameters of neutrino oscillations. A near detector\ncomplex (ND280) is located 280~m downstream of the production target and\nmeasures neutrino beam parameters before any oscillations occur. ND280's\nmeasurements are used to predict the number and spectra of neutrinos in the\nSuper-Kamiokande detector at the distance of 295~km. The difference in the\ntarget material between the far (water) and near (scintillator, hydrocarbon)\ndetectors leads to the main non-cancelling systematic uncertainty for the\noscillation analysis. In order to reduce this uncertainty a new\nWAter-Grid-And-SCintillator detector (WAGASCI) has been developed. A magnetized\niron neutrino detector (Baby MIND) will be used to measure momentum and charge\nidentification of the outgoing muons from charged current interactions. The\nBaby MIND modules are composed of magnetized iron plates and long plastic\nscintillator bars read out at the both ends with wavelength shifting fibers and\nsilicon photomultipliers. The front-end electronics board has been developed to\nperform the readout and digitization of the signals from the scintillator bars.\nDetector elements were tested with cosmic rays and in the PS beam at CERN. The\nobtained results are presented in this paper.\n", "  In this work, the lepton-number-violating processes in $|\\Delta L|=2$ decays\nof $\\Lambda_b^0$ baryon, $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to p \\pi^+\\mu^- \\mu^-$ and $\\Lambda_b^0\n\\to \\Lambda_c^+ \\pi^+\\mu^- \\mu^-$, are investigated for the first time, via an\nintermediate on-shell Majorana neutrino $N$ with a mass in the GeV scale. We\nexplore the experimental sensitivity of these dimuon channels at the LHCb and\nCMS experiments, in which heavy neutrino lifetimes in the accessible ranges of\n$\\tau_N = [1, 100, 1000]$ ps are considered. For a integrated luminosity\ncollected of 10 and 50 fb${}^{-1}$ at the LHCb and 30, 300 and 3000 fb${}^{-1}$\nat the CMS, we found significant sensitivity on branching fractions of the\norder ${\\rm BR}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to p \\pi^+\\mu^- \\mu^-) \\lesssim\n\\mathcal{O}(10^{-9} - 10^{-8})$ and ${\\rm BR}(\\Lambda_b^0 \\to \\Lambda_c^+\n\\pi^+\\mu^- \\mu^-) \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-8} - 10^{-7})$. Exclusion regions\non the parameter space ($m_N,|V_{\\mu N}|^{2}$) associated with the heavy\nneutrino are presented and compared with those from $K^- \\to \\pi^+\\mu^-\\mu^-$\n(NA48/2) and $B^- \\to \\pi^+\\mu^-\\mu^-$ (LHCb) as well as by different search\nstrategies such as NA3, CHARMII, NuTeV, Belle, and DELPHI.\n", "  Context. Monte Carlo methods have enabled nuclear reaction rates from\nuncertain inputs to be presented in a statistically meaningful manner. However,\nthese uncertainties are currently computed assuming no correlations between the\nphysical quantities that enter those calculations. This is not always an\nappropriate assumption. Astrophysically important reactions are often dominated\nby resonances, whose properties are usually normalized to a well-known\nreference resonance. This insight provides a basis from which to develop a\nflexible framework for including correlations in Monte Carlo reaction rate\ncalculations. Aims. The aim of this work is to develop and test a method for\nincluding correlations in Monte Carlo reaction rate calculations when the input\nhas been normalized to a common reference. Methods. A mathematical framework is\ndeveloped for including correlations between input parameters in Monte Carlo\nreaction rate calculations. The magnitude of those correlations is calculated\nfrom the uncertainties typically reported in experimental papers, where full\ncorrelation information is not available. The method is applied to four\nillustrative examples: a fictional 3-resonance reaction,\n$^{27}$Al(p,$\\gamma$)$^{28}$Si, $^{23}$Na(p,$\\alpha$)$^{20}$Ne, and\n$^{23}$Na($\\alpha$,p)$^{26}$Al. Results. Reaction rates at low temperatures\nthat are dominated by a few isolated resonances are found to minimally impacted\nby correlation effects. However, reaction rates determined from many\noverlapping resonances can be significantly affected. Uncertainties in the\n$^{23}$Na($\\alpha$,p)$^{26}$Al reaction, for example, increase by up to a\nfactor of 5. This highlights the need to take correlation effects into account\nin reaction rate calculations, and provide insight into which cases are\nexpected to be most affected by them. The impact of correlation effects on\nnucleosynthesis is also investigated.\n", "  We consider a coarse-grained (CG) model with pairwise interactions, suitable\nto describe low-density solutions of star-branched polymers of functionality\n$f$. Each macromolecule is represented by a CG molecule with $(f+1)$\ninteraction sites, which captures the star topology. Potentials are obtained by\nrequiring the CG model to reproduce a set of distribution functions computed in\nthe microscopic model in the zero-density limit. Explicit results are given for\n$f=6,12$ and $40$. We use the CG model to compute the osmotic equation of state\nof the solution for concentrations $c$ such that $\\Phi_p = c/c^* \\lesssim 1$,\nwhere $c^*$ is the overlap concentration. We also investigate in detail the\nphase diagram for f=40, identifying the boundaries of the solid intermediate\nphase. Finally, we investigate how the polymer size changes with $c$. For\n$\\Phi_p\\lesssim 0.3$ polymers become harder as $f$ increases at fixed reduced\nconcentration $c/c^*$. On the other hand, for $\\Phi_p\\gtrsim 0.3$, polymers\nshow the opposite behavior: At fixed $\\Phi_p$, the larger the value of $f$, the\nlarger their size reduction is.\n", "  For many technological applications of superconductors the performance of a\nmaterial is determined by the highest current it can carry losslessly - the\ncritical current. In turn, the critical current can be controlled by adding\nnon-superconducting defects in the superconductor matrix. Here we report on\nsystematic comparison of different local and global optimization strategies to\npredict optimal structures of pinning centers leading to the highest possible\ncritical currents. We demonstrate performance of these methods for a\nsuperconductor with randomly placed spherical, elliptical, and columnar\ndefects.\n", "  A magnetic Skyrmion is a stable two-dimensional nanoparticle describing a\nlocalized winding of the magnetization in certain magnetic materials. Skyrmions\nare the subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigation and have\npotential technological spintronic applications. Here we show that numerical\ncomputations of frustrated magnets predict that Skyrmions can be tied into\nknots to form new stable three-dimensional nanoparticles. These stable\nequilibria of twisted loops of Skyrmion strings have an integer-valued\ntopological charge, known as the Hopf charge, that counts the number of\nparticles. Rings are formed for low values of this charge, but for higher\nvalues it is energetically favourable to form links and then knots. This\ncomputational study provides a novel impetus for future experimental work on\nthese nanoknots and an exploration of the potential technological applications\nof three-dimensional nanoparticles encoding knotted magnetization.\n", "  Superconducting behavior even under harsh ambient conditions is expected to\noccur in La@C(60) if it could be isolated from the primary metallofullerene\nsoot when functionalized by CF(3) radicals. We use ab initio density functional\ntheory calculations to compare the stability and electronic structure of C(60)\nand the La@C(60) endohedral metallofullerene to their counterparts\nfunctionalized by CF(3). We found that CF(3) radicals favor binding to C(60)\nand La@C(60), and have identified the most stable isomers. Structures with an\neven number m of radicals are energetically preferred for C(60) and structures\nwith odd m for La@C(60) due to the extra charge on the fullerene. This is\nconsistent with a wide HOMO-LUMO gap in La@C(60)(CF(3))(m) with odd m, causing\nextra stabilization in the closed-shell electronic configuration. CF(3)\nradicals are both stabilizing agents and molecular separators in a metallic\ncrystal, which could increase the critical temperature for superconductivity.\n", "  We compare the two main techniques used for estimating the state of a\nphysical system from unknown measurements: standard detector tomography and\ndata-pattern tomography. Adopting linear inversion as a fair benchmark, we show\nthat the difference between these two protocols can be traced back to the\nnonexistence of the reverse-order law for pseudoinverses. We capitalize on this\nfact to identify regimes where the data-pattern approach outperforms the\nstandard one and vice versa. We corroborate these conclusions with numerical\nsimulations of relevant examples of quantum state tomography.\n", "  A leading explanation for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays is acceleration\nat high-Mach number shock waves in the collisionless plasma surrounding young\nsupernova remnants. Evidence for this is provided by multi-wavelength\nnon-thermal emission thought to be associated with ultrarelativistic electrons\nat these shocks. However, the dependence of the electron acceleration process\non the orientation of the upstream magnetic field with respect to the local\nnormal to the shock front (quasi-parallel/quasi-perpendicular) is debated.\nCassini spacecraft observations at Saturn's bow shock has revealed examples of\nelectron acceleration under quasi-perpendicular conditions, and the first in\nsitu evidence of electron acceleration at a quasi-parallel shock. Here we use\nCassini data to make the first comparison between energy spectra of locally\naccelerated electrons under these differing upstream magnetic field regimes. We\npresent data taken during a quasi-perpendicular shock crossing on 2008 March 8\nand during a quasi-parallel shock crossing on 2007 February 3, highlighting\nthat both were associated with electron acceleration to at least MeV energies.\nThe magnetic signature of the quasi-perpendicular crossing has a relatively\nsharp upstream-downstream transition, and energetic electrons were detected\nclose to the transition and immediately downstream. The magnetic transition at\nthe quasi-parallel crossing is less clear, energetic electrons were encountered\nupstream and downstream, and the electron energy spectrum is harder above ~100\nkeV. We discuss whether the acceleration is consistent with diffusive shock\nacceleration theory in each case, and suggest that the quasi-parallel spectral\nbreak is due to an energy-dependent interaction between the electrons and\nshort, large-amplitude magnetic structures.\n", "  The antiperovskite-related nitride Cr$_3$GeN forms a tetragonal structure\nwith the space group $P\\bar{4}2_1m$ at room temperature. It shows a tetragonal\n($P\\bar{4}2_1m$) to tetragonal ($I4/mcm$) structural transition with a large\nhysteresis at 300--400 K. The magnetic susceptibility of Cr$_3$GeN shows\nCurie-Weiss type temperature dependence at high temperature, but is almost\ntemperature-independent below room temperature. We carried out $\\mu$SR and\n$^{14}$N-NMR microscopy measurements to reveal the magnetic ground state of\nCr$_3$GeN. Gradual muon spin relaxation, which is nearly\ntemperature-independent below room temperature, was observed, indicating that\nCr$_3$GeN is magnetically inactive. In the $^{14}$N-NMR measurement, a\nquadrupole-split spectrum was obtained at around $^{14}K = 0$. The temperature\ndependence of $^{14}(1/T_1)$ satisfies the Korringa relation. These\nexperimental results indicate that the ground state of Cr$_3$GeN is Pauli\nparamagnetic, without antiferromagnetic long-range order.\n", "  Photonic crystal cavities enable the realization of high Q-factor and low\nmode-volume resonators, with typical architectures consisting of a thin\nsuspended periodically-patterned layer to maximize confinement of light by\nstrong index guiding. We investigate a heterostructure-based approach\ncomprising a high refractive index core and lower refractive index cladding\nlayers. Whilst confinement typically decreases with decreasing index contrast\nbetween the core and cladding layers, we show that, counter-intuitively, due to\nthe confinement provided by the photonic band structure in the cladding layers,\nit becomes possible to achieve Q-factors $>10^4$ with only a small refractive\nindex contrast. This opens up new opportunities for implementing high Q-factor\ncavities in conventional semiconductor heterostructures, with direct\napplications to the design of electrically-pumped nano-cavity lasers using\nconventional fabrication approaches.\n", "  We extend a well-known D-brane construction of the AdS/dCFT correspondence to\nnon-abelian defects. We focus on the bulk side of the correspondence and show\nthat there exists a regime of parameters in which the low-energy description\nconsists of two approximately decoupled sectors. The two sectors are gravity in\nthe ambient spacetime, and a six-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.\nThe Yang-Mills theory is defined on a rigid AdS_4 x S^2 background and admits\nsixteen supersymmetries. We also consider a one-parameter deformation that\ngives rise to a family of Yang-Mills theories on asymptotically AdS_4 x S^2\nspacetimes, which are invariant under eight supersymmetries. With future\nholographic applications in mind, we analyze the vacuum structure and\nperturbative spectrum of the Yang-Mills theory on AdS_4 x S^2, as well as\nsystems of BPS equations for finite-energy solitons. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat the classical Yang-Mills theory has a consistent truncation on the\ntwo-sphere, resulting in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills on AdS_4.\n", "  The problem of output-only parameter identification for nonlinear oscillators\nforced by colored noise is considered. In this context, it is often assumed\nthat the forcing noise is white, since its actual spectral content is unknown.\nThe impact of this white noise forcing assumption upon parameter identification\nis quantitatively analyzed. First, a Van der Pol oscillator forced by an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process is considered. Second, the practical case of\nthermoacoustic limit cycles in combustion chambers with turbulence-induced\nforcing is investigated. It is shown that in both cases, the system parameters\nare accurately identified if time signals are appropriately band-pass filtered\naround the oscillator eigenfrequency.\n", "  We combine extensive precision measurements of the optically detected spin\ndynamics and magneto-transport measurements in a contiguous set of n-doped bulk\nGaAs structures in order to unambiguously unravel the intriguing but complex\ncontributions to the spin relaxation at the metal-to-insulator transition\n(MIT). Just below the MIT, the interplay between hopping induced loss of spin\ncoherence and hyperfine interaction yields a maximum spin lifetime exceeding\n800~ns. At slightly higher doping concentrations, however, the spin relaxation\ndeviates from the expected Dyakonov-Perel mechanism which is consistently\nexplained by a reduction of the effective motional narrowing with increasing\ndoping concentration. The reduction is attributed to the change of the dominant\nmomentum scattering mechanism in the metallic impurity band where scattering by\nlocal conductivity domain boundaries due to the intrinsic random distribution\nof donors becomes significant. Here, we fully identify and model all intricate\ncontributions of the relevant microscopic scattering mechanisms which allows\nthe complete quantitative modeling of the electron spin relaxation in the\nentire regime from weakly interacting up to fully delocalized electrons.\n", "  Instability of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been studied as\nfunction of electric current and temperature in ferromagnetic topological\ninsulator thin films. We find that a characteristic current for the breakdown\nof the QAH effect is roughly proportional to the Hall-bar width, indicating\nthat Hall electric field is relevant to the breakdown. We also find that\nelectron transport is dominated by variable range hopping (VRH) at low\ntemperatures. Combining the current and temperature dependences of the\nconductivity in the VRH regime, the localization length of the QAH state is\nevaluated to be about 5 $\\mu$m. The long localization length suggests a\nmarginally insulating nature of the QAH state due to a large number of in-gap\nstates.\n", "  We have compared the magnetic, transport, galvanomagnetic and specific heat\nproperties of CeNiC$_2$, PrNiC$_2$ and NdNiC$_2$ to study the interplay between\ncharge density waves and magnetism in these compounds. The negative\nmagnetoresistance in NdNiC$_2$ is discussed in terms of the partial destruction\nof charge density waves and an irreversible phase transition stabilized by the\nfield induced ferromagnetic transformation is reported. For PrNiC$_2$ we\ndemonstrate that the magnetic field initially weakens the CDW state, due to the\nZeeman splitting of conduction bands. However, the Fermi surface nesting is\nenhanced at a temperature related to the magnetic anomaly.\n", "  Statistics of the angle \\Phi between orbital angular momenta in hierarchical\ntriple systems with known inner visual or astrometric orbits are studied.\nCorrelation between apparent revolution directions proves partial orbit\nalignment known from earlier works. The alignment is strong in triples with\nouter projected separation less than ~50 AU, where the average \\Phi is about 20\ndegrees. In contrast, outer orbits wider than 1000 AU are not aligned with the\ninner orbits. It is established that the orbit alignment decreases with\nincreasing mass of the primary component. Average eccentricity of inner orbits\nin well-aligned triples is smaller than in randomly aligned ones. These\nfindings highlight the role of dissipative interactions with gas in defining\nthe orbital architecture of low-mass triple systems. On the other hand, chaotic\ndynamics apparently played a role in shaping more massive hierarchies. Analysis\nof projected configurations and triples with known inner and outer orbits\nindicates that the distribution of \\Phi is likely bimodal, where 80% of triples\nhave \\Phi<70 degrees and the remaining ones are randomly aligned.\n", "  An important problem in statistical physics concerns the fascinating\nconnections between partition functions of lattice models studied in\nequilibrium statistical mechanics on the one hand and graph theoretical\nenumeration problems on the other hand. We investigate the nature of the\nrelationship between the number of spanning trees and the partition function of\nthe Ising model on the square lattice. The spanning tree generating function\n$T(z)$ gives the spanning tree constant when evaluated at $z=1$, while giving\nhe lattice green function when differentiated. It is known that for the\ninfinite square lattice the partition function $Z(K)$ of the Ising model\nevaluated at the critical temperature $K=K_c$ is related to $T(1)$. Here we\nshow that this idea in fact generalizes to all real temperatures. We prove that\n$ ( Z(K) {\\rm sech~} 2K ~\\!)^2 = k \\exp\\big[ T(k) \\big] $, where $k= 2\n\\tanh(2K) {\\rm sech}(2K)$. The identical Mahler measure connects the two\nseemingly disparate quantities $T(z)$ and $Z(K)$. In turn, the Mahler measure\nis determined by the random walk structure function. Finally, we show that the\nthe above correspondence does not generalize in a straightforward anner to\nnon-planar lattices.\n", "  We study the dynamics of strings with non-zero winding number around\nT-duality defects. We deduce that the physics near the core of such\nnon-geometric objects involves winding modes that are not captured by the\nsupergravity approximation, and we argue that such corrections are T-dual to\nthe modes responsible for quantum corrections of semi-flat elliptic metrics. We\nfurthermore construct a solution of double field theory that captures part of\nsuch near-core physics.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic and superconducting properties in electron-doped\nLi$_x$HfNCl. HfNCl is a band insulator that undergoes an insulator to\nsuperconductor transition upon doping at $x\\approx0.13$. The persistence of the\ninsulating state for $x<0.13$ is due to an Anderson transition probably related\nto Li disorder. In the metallic and superconducting phase, Li$_x$HfNCl is a\nprototype two-dimensional two-valley electron gas with parabolic bands. By\nperforming a model random phase approximation approach as well as\nfirst-principles range-separated Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) calculations,\nwe find that the spin susceptibility $\\chi_s$ is strongly enhanced in the low\ndoping regime by the electron-electron interaction. Furthermore, in the low\ndoping limit, the exchange interaction renormalizes the intervalley\nelectron-phonon coupling and results in a strong increase of the\nsuperconducting critical temperature for $x<0.15$. On the contrary, for\n$x>0.15$, $T_c$ is approximately constant, in agreement with experiments. At\n$x=0.055$ we found that $T_c$ can be as large as 40 K, suggesting that the\nsynthesis of cleaner samples of Li$_x$HfNCl could remove the Anderson\ninsulating state competing with superconductivity and generate a high-$T_c$\nsuperconductor.\n", "  Josephson junctions form the essential non-linearity for almost all\nsuperconducting qubits. The junction is formed when two superconducting\nelectrodes come within $\\sim$1 nm of each other. Although the capacitance of\nthese electrodes is a small fraction of the total qubit capacitance, the nearby\nelectric fields are more concentrated in dielectric surfaces and can contribute\nsubstantially to the total dissipation. We have developed a technique to\nexperimentally investigate the effect of these electrodes on the quality of\nsuperconducting devices. We use $\\lambda$/4 coplanar waveguide resonators to\nemulate lumped qubit capacitors. We add a variable number of these electrodes\nto the capacitive end of these resonators and measure how the additional loss\nscales with number of electrodes. We then reduce this loss with fabrication\ntechniques that limit the amount of lossy dielectrics. We then apply these\ntechniques to the fabrication of Xmon qubits on a silicon substrate to improve\ntheir energy relaxation times by a factor of 5.\n", "  We study the leptonic and semileptonic $D$-meson decays (${{\\mathit D} \\to}\n{{\\mathit \\ell}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{{{\\mathit \\ell}}}}}$ and ${\\mathit{D} \\to}\n{{\\mathit K}^{(*)}}{{\\mathit \\ell}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{{{\\mathit \\ell}}}}}$)\nin the framework of covariant quark model with built-in infrared confinement.\nWe compute the required form factors in the entire kinematical momentum\ntransfer region. The calculated form factors are used to evaluate the branching\nfractions of these transitions. We determine the following ratios of the\npartial widths: $\\Gamma ({{\\mathit D}^{0}} \\rightarrow {{\\mathit\nK}^{-}}{{\\mathit e}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{e}}})/\\Gamma({{\\mathit D}^{+}}\n\\rightarrow {{\\overline{\\mathit K}}^{0}}{{\\mathit e}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{e}}})\n= 1.02$, $\\Gamma({{\\mathit D}^{0}} \\rightarrow {{\\mathit K}^{-}}{{\\mathit\n\\mu}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{\\mu}}})/\\Gamma({{\\mathit D}^{+}} \\rightarrow\n{{\\overline{\\mathit K}}^{0}}{{\\mathit \\mu}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{\\mu}}}) = 0.99$\nand $\\Gamma({{\\mathit D}^{+}} \\rightarrow {{\\overline{\\mathit K}}^{0}}{{\\mathit\n\\mu}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{\\mu}}}) / \\Gamma({{\\mathit D}^{+}} \\rightarrow\n{{\\overline{\\mathit K}}^{0}}{{\\mathit e}^{+}}{{\\mathit \\nu}_{{e}}}) = 0.97$\nwhich are in close resemblance with the iso-spin invariance and experimental\nresults.\n", "  Optical lightcurves can be used for the shape and spin reconstruction of\nasteroids. Due to unknown albedo, these models are scale-free. When thermal\ninfrared data are available, they can be used for scaling the shape models and\nfor deriving thermophysical properties of the surface by applying a\nthermophysical model. We introduce a new method of simultaneous inversion of\noptical and thermal infrared data that allows the size of an asteroid to be\nderived along with its shape and spin state. The method optimizes all relevant\nparameters (shape and its size, spin state, light-scattering properties,\nthermal inertia, surface roughness) by gradient-based optimization. The thermal\nemission is computed by solving the 1-D heat diffusion equation. Calibrated\noptical photometry and thermal fluxes at different wavelengths are needed as\ninput data. We demonstrate the reliability and test the accuracy of the method\non selected targets with different amount and quality of data. Our results in\ngeneral agree with those obtained by independent methods. Combining optical and\nthermal data into one inversion method opens a new possibility for processing\nphotometry from large optical sky surveys with the data from WISE. It also\nprovides more realistic estimates of errors of thermophysical parameters.\n", "  We study the effect of non-magnetic Zn$^{2+}$ (spin-$0$) and magnetic\nNi$^{2+}$ (spin-$1$) impurities on the ground state and low-lying excitations\nof the quasi-one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet\nSr$_{2}$CuO$_{3}$ using inelastic neutron scattering, specific heat and bulk\nmagnetization measurements. We show that 1 \\% Ni$^{2+}$ doping in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$\nresults in a sizable spin gap in the spinon excitations, analogous to the case\nof Ni-doped SrCuO$_2$ previously reported [ref. 1]. However, a similar level of\nZn$^{2+}$ doping in SrCuO$_2$, investigated here for comparison, did not reveal\nany signs of a spin gap. Magnetic ordering temperature was found to be\nsuppressed in the presence of both Zn$^{2+}$ and Ni$^{2+}$ impurities, however,\nthe rate of suppression due to Ni$^{2+}$ was found to be much more pronounced\nthan for Zn$^{2+}$. Effect of magnetic field on the ordering temperature is\ninvestigated. We found that with increasing magnetic field, not only the\nmagnetic ordering temperature gradually increases but the size of specific heat\nanomaly associated with the magnetic ordering also progressively enhances,\nwhich can be qualitatively understood as due to the field induced suppression\nof quantum fluctuations.\n", "  We report the detection of CO(2-1) emission coincident with the brightest\ncluster galaxy (BCG) of the high-redshift galaxy cluster SpARCS1049+56, with\nthe Redshift Search Receiver (RSR) on the Large Millimetre Telescope (LMT). We\nconfirm a spectroscopic redshift for the gas of z = 1.7091+/-0.0004, which is\nconsistent with the systemic redshift of the cluster galaxies of z = 1.709. The\nline is well-fit by a single component Gaussian with a RSR resolution-corrected\nFWHM of 569+/-63 km/s. We see no evidence for multiple velocity components in\nthe gas, as might be expected from the multiple image components seen in\nnear-infrared imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope. We measure the\nintegrated flux of the line to be 3.6+/-0.3 Jy km/s and, using alpha_CO = 0.8\nMsun (K km s^-1 pc^2)^-1 we estimate a total molecular gas mass of\n1.1+/-0.1x10^11 Msun and a M_H2/M_star ~ 0.4. This is the largest gas reservoir\ndetected in a BCG above z > 1 to date. Given the infrared-estimated star\nformation rate of 860+/-130 Msun/yr, this corresponds to a gas depletion\ntimescale of ~0.1Gyr. We discuss several possible mechanisms for depositing\nsuch a large gas reservoir to the cluster center -- e.g., a cooling flow, a\nmajor galaxy-galaxy merger or the stripping of gas from several galaxies -- but\nconclude that these LMT data are not sufficient to differentiate between them.\n", "  An efficient quantum storage is highly desired for quantum information\nprocessing. As indicated by certain applications, a universal quantum storage\nis required to have a storage efficiency above 50% to beat the no-cloning\nlimit. Although significant progress has been achieved in improving various\nquantum storage, the best storage efficiency of single photons is still below\nthis criteria. By integrating a highly controllable single photon source with\nan optimized quantum storage, here we demonstrate an optical storage of single\nphotons with storage efficiency of 65% in a cold atomic ensemble based on\nelectromagnetically induced transparency. Meanwhile, the nonclassical\ncharacteristics of our storage are verified through the well-maintained\nnonclassical and single photon nature of the retrieved single photons.\n", "  The gas kinetic temperature ($T_K$) of various interstellar environments is\noften inferred from observations that can deduce level populations of atoms,\nions, or molecules using spectral line observations; H I 21 cm is perhaps the\nmost widely used with a long history. Usually the H I 21 cm line is assumed to\nbe in thermal equilibrium and the populations are given by the Boltzmann\ndistribution. A variety of processes, many involving Lyman alpha ($Ly\\alpha$),\ncan affect the 21 cm line. Here we show how this is treated in the spectral\nsimulation code Cloudy, and present numerical simulations of environments where\nthis temperature indicator is used, with a detailed treatment of the physical\nprocesses that determine level populations within $H^0$. We discuss situations\nwhere this temperature indicator traces $T_K$, cases where they fail, as well\nas the effects of $Ly\\alpha$ pumping on the 21 cm spin temperature. We also\nshow that the $Ly\\alpha$ excitation temperature rarely traces the gas kinetic\ntemperature.\n", "  Next generation radio telescope arrays are being designed and commissioned to\naccurately measure polarized intensity and rotation measures across the entire\nsky through deep, wide-field radio interferometric surveys. Radio\ninterferometer dish antenna arrays are affected by direction-dependent (DD)\ngains due to both instrumental and atmospheric effects. In this paper we\ndemonstrate the effect of DD errors for parabolic dish antenna array on the\nmeasured polarized intensities of radio sources in interferometric images. We\ncharacterize the extent of polarimetric image degradation due to the DD gains\nthrough wide-band VLA simulations of representative point source simulations of\nthe radio sky at L-Band(1-2GHz). We show that at the 0.5 gain level of the\nprimary beam (PB) there is significant flux leakage from Stokes $I$ to $Q$, $U$\namounting to 10\\% of the total intensity. We further demonstrate that while the\ninstrumental response averages down for observations over large parallactic\nangle intervals, full-polarization DD correction is required to remove the\neffects of DD leakage. We also explore the effect of the DD beam on the\nRotation Measure(RM) signals and show that while the instrumental effect is\nprimarily centered around 0 rad-m$^{-2}$, the effect is significant over a\nbroad range of RM requiring full polarization DD correction to accurately\nreconstruct RM synthesis signal.\n", "  Suzaku measurements of a homogeneous metal distribution of $Z\\sim0.3$ Solar\nin the outskirts of the nearby Perseus cluster suggest that chemical elements\nwere deposited and mixed into the intergalactic medium before clusters formed,\nlikely over 10 billion years ago. A key prediction of this early enrichment\nscenario is that the intracluster medium in all massive clusters should be\nuniformly enriched to a similar level. Here, we confirm this prediction by\ndetermining the iron abundances in the outskirts ($r>0.25r_{200}$) of a sample\nof ten other nearby galaxy clusters observed with Suzaku for which robust\nmeasurements based on the Fe-K lines can be made. Across our sample the iron\nabundances are consistent with a constant value, $Z_{\\rm Fe}=0.316\\pm0.012$\nSolar ($\\chi^2=28.85$ for 25 degrees of freedom). This is remarkably similar to\nthe measurements for the Perseus cluster of $Z_{\\rm Fe}=0.314\\pm0.012$ Solar,\nusing the Solar abundance scale of Asplund et al. (2009).\n", "  Cassini discovered a plethora of neutral and ionised molecules in Titan's\nionosphere including, surprisingly, anions and negatively charged molecules\nextending up to 13,800 u/q. In this letter we forward model the Cassini\nelectron spectrometer response function to this unexpected ionospheric\ncomponent to achieve an increased mass resolving capability for negatively\ncharged species observed at Titan altitudes of 950-1300 km. We report on\ndetections consistently centered between 25.8-26.0 u/q and between 49.0-50.1\nu/q which are identified as belonging to the carbon chain anions,\nCN$^-$/C$_3$N$^-$ and/or C$_2$H$^-$/C$_4$H$^-$, in agreement with chemical\nmodel predictions. At higher ionospheric altitudes, detections at 73-74 u/q\ncould be attributed to the further carbon chain anions C$_5$N$^-$/C$_6$H$^-$\nbut at lower altitudes and during further encounters, extend over a higher\nmass/charge range. This, as well as further intermediary anions detected at\n$>$100 u, provide the first evidence for efficient anion chemistry in space\ninvolving structures other than linear chains. Furthermore, at altitudes below\n$\\sim$1100 km, the low mass anions ($<$150 u/q) were found to deplete at a rate\nproportional to the growth of the larger molecules, a correlation that\nindicates the anions are tightly coupled to the growth process. This study adds\nTitan to an increasing list of astrophysical environments where chain anions\nhave been observed and shows that anion chemistry plays a role in the formation\nof complex organics within a planetary atmosphere as well as in the\ninterstellar medium.\n", "  We discuss the CoLoRFulNNLO method for computing higher order radiative\ncorrections to jet cross sections in perturbative QCD. We apply our method to\nthe calculation of event shapes and jet rates in three-jet production in\nelectron-positron annihilation. We validate our code by comparing our\npredictions to previous results in the literature and present the jet cone\nenergy fraction distribution at NNLO accuracy. We also present preliminary NNLO\nresults for the three-jet rate using the Durham jet clustering algorithm\nmatched to resummed predictions at NLL accuracy, and a comparison to LEP data.\n", "  We formulate a model that describes the escape dynamics in a leaky chaotic\nsystem in which the size of the leak depends on the number of the in-falling\nparticles. The basic motivation of this work is the astrophysical process which\ndescribes the planetary accretion. In order to study the dynamics generally,\nthe standard map is investigated in two cases when the dynamics is fully\nhyperbolic and in the presence of KAM islands. In addition to the numerical\ncalculations, an analytic solution to the temporal behavior of the model is\nalso derived. We show that in the early phase of the leak expansion, as long as\nthere are enough particles in the system, the number of survivors deviates from\nthe well-known exponential decay. Furthermore, the analytic solution returns\nthe classical result in the limiting case when the number of particles does not\naffect the leak size.\n", "  We use the number density distributions of K and M dwarf stars with vertical\nheight from the Galactic disk, determined using observations from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey, to probe the structure of the Milky Way disk across the\nsurvey's footprint. Using photometric parallax as a distance estimator we\nanalyze a sample of several million disk stars in matching footprints above and\nbelow the Galactic plane, and we determine the location and extent of vertical\nasymmetries in the number counts in a variety of thin- and thick-disk\nsubsamples in regions of some 200 square degrees within 2 kpc in vertical\ndistance from the Galactic disk. These disk asymmetries present wave-like\nfeatures as previously observed on other scales and at other distances from the\nSun. We additionally explore the scale height of the disk and the implied\noffset of the Sun from the Galactic plane at different locations, noting that\nthe scale height of the disk can differ significantly when measured using stars\nonly above or only below the plane. Moreover, we compare the shape of the\nnumber density distribution in the north for different latitude ranges with a\nfixed range in longitude and find the shape to be sensitive to the selected\nlatitude window. We explain why this may be indicative of a change in stellar\npopulations in the latitude regions compared, possibly allowing access to the\nsystematic metallicity difference between thin- and thick-disk populations\nthrough photometry.\n", "  In this work we seek evidence for global torsional oscillations in alpha\nsunspots. We have used long time series of continuum intensity and magnetic\nfield vector maps from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument on\nboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. The time series analysed\nhere span the total disk passage of 25 isolated sunspots. We found no evidence\nof global long-term periodic oscillations in the azimuthal angle of the sunspot\nmagnetic field within $\\sim$ 1 degree. This study could help us to understand\nthe sunspot dynamics and its internal structure.\n", "  We present new SDSS and Washington photometry of the young, outer-halo\nstellar system, Segue 3. Combined with archival VI-observations, our most\nconsistent results yield: $Z=0.006$, $\\log(Age)=9.42$, $(m-M)_0=17.35$,\n$E(B-V)=0.09$, with a high binary fraction of $0.39\\pm 0.05$, using the Padova\nmodels. We confirm that mass segregation has occurred, supporting the\nhypothesis that this cluster is being tidally disrupted. A 3-parameter King\nmodel yields a cluster radius of $r_{cl}=0.017^\\circ$, a core radius of\n$r_{c}=0.003^\\circ$, and a tidal radius of $r_t=0.04^\\circ \\pm 0.02^\\circ$. A\ncomparison of Padova and Dartmouth model-grids indicates that the cluster is\nnot significantly $\\alpha$-enhanced, with a mean [Fe/H]$=-0.55^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$\ndex, and a population age of only $2.6\\pm 0.4$ Gyr. We rule out a\nstatistically-significant age spread at the main sequence turnoff because of a\nnarrow subgiant branch, and discuss the role of stellar rotation and cluster\nage, using Dartmouth and Geneva models: approximately 70% of the Seg 3 stars at\nor below the main sequence turnoff have enhanced rotation. Our results for\nSegue 3 indicate that it is younger and more metal-rich than all previous\nstudies have reported to-date. From colors involving Washington-C and SDSS-u\nfilters, we identify several giants and a possible blue-straggler for future\nfollow-up spectroscopic studies, and we produce spectral energy distributions\nof previously known members and potential Segue 3 sources with Washington\n($CT_1$), Sloan (ugri), and VI-filters. Segue 3 shares the characteristics of\nunusual stellar systems which have likely been stripped from external dwarf\ngalaxies as they are being accreted by the Milky Way, or that have been formed\nduring such an event. Its youth, metallicity, and location are all inconsistent\nwith Segue 3 being a cluster native to the Milky Way.\n", "  High-multiplicity Kepler systems (referred to as Kepler multis) are often\ntightly packed and may be on the verge of instability. Many systems of this\ntype could have experienced past instabilities, where the compact orbits and\noften low densities make physical collisions likely outcomes. We use numerical\nsimulations to study the dynamical instabilities and planet-planet interactions\nin a synthetically generated sample of closely-packed, high-multiplicity\nsystems. We focus specifically on systems resembling Kepler-11, a Kepler multi\nwith six planets, and run a suite of dynamical integrations, sampling the\ninitial orbital parameters around the nominal values reported in Lissauer et\nal. (2011a), finding that most of the realizations are unstable, resulting in\norbit crossings and, eventually, collisions and mergers. We study in detail the\ndependence of stability on the orbital parameters of the planets and\nplanet-pair characteristics to identify possible precursors to instability,\ncompare the systems that emerge from dynamical instabilities to the observed\nKepler sample (after applying observational corrections), and propose possible\nobservable signatures of these instabilities. We examine the characteristics of\neach planet-planet collision, categorizing collisions by the degree of contact\nand collision energy, and find that grazing collisions are more common than\ndirect impacts. Since the structure of many planets found in Kepler multis is\nsuch that the mass is dominated by a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by\na low-density gaseous envelope, the sticky-sphere approximation may not be\nvalid, and we present hydrodynamic calculations of planet-planet collisions\nclearly deviating from this approximation. Finally, we rerun a subset of our\ndynamical calculations using instead a modified prescription to handle\ncollisions, finding, in general, higher multiplicity remnant systems.\n"]}
