We say\nthat $\\rho$ is PPT if its partial transpose $1 \\otimes T (\\rho)$ is positive\nsemidefinite, and otherwise $\\rho$ is NPT. The well-known Werner states are\ndivided into three types: (a) the separable states (the same as the PPT\nstates); (b) the one-distillable states (necessarily NPT); and (c) the NPT\nstates which are not one-distillable. We give several different formulations\nand provide further evidence for validity of the conjecture that the Werner\nstates of type (c) are not two-distillable.\n", "  We present a formula for the calculation of K-edge resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering on transition metal compounds, based on a local interaction between\nthe valence shell electrons and the $1s$ core hole. Extending a previous\nresult, we include explicit momentum dependence and a basis with multiple\ncore-hole sites. We apply this formula to a single-layered charge, orbital and\nspin ordered manganite, La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$, and obtain good agreement\nwith experimental data, in particular with regards to the large variation of\nthe intensity with momentum. We find that the screening in\nLa$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ is highly localized around the core-hole site and\ndemonstrate the potential of K-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a\nprobe of screening dynamics in materials.\n", "  Binary pulsars are ideal to test the foundations of General Relativity, such\nas Lorentz symmetry, which requires that experiments produce the same results\nin all free-falling (i.e.inertial) frames. We here break this symmetry in the\ngravitational sector by specifying a preferred time direction, and thus a\npreferred frame, at each spacetime point. We then examine the consequences of\nthis gravitational Lorentz symmetry breaking in the orbital evolution of binary\npulsars, focusing on the dissipative effects. We find that Lorentz symmetry\nbreaking modifies these effects, and thus the orbital dynamics, in two\ndifferent ways. First, it generically causes the emission of dipolar radiation,\nwhich makes the orbital separation decrease faster than in General Relativity.\nSecond, the quadrupole component of the emission is also modified. The orbital\nevolution depends critically on the sensitivities of the stars, which measure\nhow their binding energies depend on the motion relative to the preferred\nframe. We calculate the sensitivities numerically and compute the predicted\norbital decay rate of binary pulsars in Lorentz-violating gravity. By testing\nthese predictions against observations, we place very stringent constraints on\ngravitational Lorentz violation.\n", "  DK Cyg (P = 0.4707) is a W Ursae Majoris type eclipsing binary system that\nundergoes complete eclipses. All the published photoelectric data have been\ncollected and utilized to re-examine and update the period behavior of the\nsystem. A significant period increase with rate of 12.590x10-11 day/cycle was\ncalculated. New period and ephemeris has been calculated for the system. A long\nterm photometric solution study was performed and a light curve elements were\ncalculated. We investigated the evolutionary status of the system using\ntheoretical evolutionary models.\n", "  It is shown that a realistic, controlled bidirectional remote state\npreparation is possible using a large class of entangled quantum states having\na particular structure. Existing protocols of probabilistic, deterministic and\njoint remote state preparation are generalized to obtain the corresponding\nprotocols of controlled bidirectional remote state preparation (CBRSP). A\ngeneral way of incorporating the effects of two well known noise processes, the\namplitude-damping and phase-damping noise, on the probabilistic CBRSP process\nis studied in detail by considering that noise only affects the travel qubits\nof the quantum channel used for the probabilistic CBRSP process. Also indicated\nis how to account for the effect of these noise channels on deterministic and\njoint remote state CBRSP protocols.\n", "  We study massive and massless conical defects in Minkowski and de Sitter\nspaces in various spacetime dimensions. The energy-momentum of a defect,\nconsidered as an (extended) relativistic object, is completely characterized by\nthe holonomy of the connection associated with its spacetime metric. The\npossible holonomies are given by Lorentz group elements, which are rotations\nand null rotations for massive and massless defects respectively. In\nparticular, if we fix the direction of propagation of a massless defect in\nn+1-dimensional Minkowski space, then its space of holonomies is a maximal\nabelian subgroup of the AN(n-1) group, which corresponds to the well known\nmomentum space associated with the n-dimensional $\\kappa$-Minkowski\nnoncommutative spacetime and $\\kappa$-deformed Poincar\\'{e} algebra. We also\nconjecture that massless defects in n-dimensional de Sitter space can be\nanalogously characterized by holonomies belonging to the same subgroup. This\nshows how group-valued momenta related to four-dimensional deformations of\nrelativistic symmetries can arise in the description of motion of spacetime\ndefects.\n", "  In de Sitter ambient space formalism, the linear gravity can be written in\nterms of a minimally coupled scalar field and a polarization tensor. In this\nformalism, the massless minimally coupled scalar field can be quantized on\nBunch-Davies vacuum state, that preserves the de Sitter invariance, the\nanalyticity and removes the infrared divergence. The de Sitter quantum linear\ngravity is then constructed on Bunch-Davies vacuum state, which is also\ncovariant, analytic and free of any infrared divergences. We will conclude that\nthe unique Bunch-Davies vacuum state can be used adequately to constructing the\nquantum field theory in de Sitter universe.\n", "  A 1-5 MeV proton beamline is being built by the Turkish Atomic Energy\nAuthority in collaboration with a number of graduate students from different\nuniversities. The primary goal of the project, is to acquire the design ability\nand manufacturing capability of all the components locally. SPP will be an\naccelerator and beam diagnostics test facility and it will also serve the\ndetector development community with its low beam current. This paper discusses\nthe design and construction of the RF power supply and the RF transmission line\ncomponents such as its waveguide converters and its circulator. Additionally\nlow and high power RF test results are presented to compare the performances of\nthe locally produced components to the commercially available ones.\n", "  We present the results of the covariant spectator quark model applied to the\nnucleon structure function $f(x)$ measured in unpolarized deep inelastic\nscattering, and the structure functions $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$ measured in deep\ninelastic scattering using polarized beams and targets ($x$ is the Bjorken\nscaling variable). The nucleon is modeled by a valence quark-diquark structure\nwith $S,P$ and $D$ components. The shape of the wave functions and the relative\nstrength of each component are fixed by making fits to the deep inelastic\nscattering data for the structure functions $f(x)$ and $g_1(x)$. The model is\nthen used to make predictions on the function $g_2(x)$ for the proton and\nneutron.\n", "  Thermalization in the D1D5 CFT should occur via interactions caused by the\ntwist operator, which deforms the theory off its free orbifold point. Earlier\nstudies investigating this deformation at first order did not show any definite\nevidence of thermalization. In this paper we study the deformation to second\norder, where we do expect to see the effects that should give thermalization.\nWe compute the effect of two twist operators on an initial vacuum state, which\ngenerates a squeezed state analogous to the case for a single twist. We obtain\nexpressions for the Bogoliubov coefficients in this 2-twist case.\n", "  Natural gas hydrates are considered a potential resource for gas production\non industrial scales. Gas hydrates contribute to the strength and stiffness of\nthe hydrate-bearing sediments. During gas production, the geomechanical\nstability of the sediment is compromised. Due to the potential geotechnical\nrisks and process management issues, the mechanical behavior of the gas\nhydrate-bearing sediments needs to be carefully considered. In this study, we\ndescribe a coupling concept that simplifies the mathematical description of the\ncomplex interactions occuring during gas production by isolating the effects of\nsediment deformation and hydrate phase changes. Central to this coupling\nconcept is the assumption that the soil grains form the load-bearing solid\nskeleton, while the gas hydrate enhances the mechanical properties of this\nskeleton. We focus on testing this coupling concept in capturing the overall\nimpact of geomechanics on gas production behavior though numerical simulation\nof a high-pressure isotropic compression experiment combined with methane\nhydrate formation and dissociation. We consider a linear-elastic stress-strain\nrelationship because it is uniquely defined and easy to calibrate. Since, in\nreality, the geomechanical response of the hydrate bearing sediment is\ntypically inelastic and is characterized by a significant shear-volumetric\ncoupling, we control the experiment very carefully in order to keep the sample\ndeformations small and well within the assumptions of poro-elasticity. The\nclosely co-ordinated experimental and numerical procedures enable us to\nvalidate the proposed simplified geomechanics-to-flow coupling, and set an\nimportant precursor towards enhancing our coupled hydro-geomechanical hydrate\nreservoir simulator with more suitable elasto-plastic constitutive models.\n", "  This paper describes the results of the most recent measurement of the\npermanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of neutral $^{199}$Hg atoms. Fused\nsilica vapor cells containing enriched $^{199}$Hg are arranged in a stack in a\ncommon magnetic field. Optical pumping is used to spin-polarize the atoms\northogonal to the applied magnetic field, and the Faraday rotation of\nnear-resonant light is observed to determine an electric-field-induced\nperturbation to the Larmor precession frequency. Our results for this frequency\nshift are consistent with zero; we find the corresponding $^{199}$Hg EDM\n$d_{Hg} = (2.20 \\pm 2.75_{stat} \\pm 1.48_{syst}) \\times 10^{-30} e\\cdot\n\\text{cm}$. We use this result to place a new upper limit on the $^{199}$Hg EDM\n$|d_{Hg}| < 7.4\\times 10^{-30} e\\cdot \\text{cm}$ (95\\% C.L.), improving our\nprevious limit by a factor of 4. We also discuss the implications of this\nresult for various $CP$-violating observables as they relate to theories of\nphysics beyond the standard model.\n", "  The atomically-precise controlled synthesis of graphene stripes embedded in\nhexagonal boron nitride opens up new possibilities for the construction of\nnanodevices with applications in sensing. Here, we explore properties related\nto electronic structure and quantum transport of a graphene nanoroad embedded\nin hexagonal boron nitride, using a combination of density functional theory\nand the non-equilibrium Green's functions method to calculate the electric\nconductance. We find that the graphene nanoribbon signature is preserved in the\ntransmission spectra and that the local current is mainly confined to the\ngraphene domain. When a properly sized nanopore is created in the graphene part\nof the system, the electronic current becomes restricted to a carbon chain\nrunning along the border with hexagonal boron nitride. This circumstance could\nallow the hypothetical nanodevice to become highly sensitive to the electronic\nnature of molecules passing through the nanopore, thus opening up ways for the\ndetection of gas molecules, amino acids, or even DNA sequences based on a\nmeasurement of the real-time conductance modulation in the graphene nanoroad.\n", "  The effect of noise on various protocols of secure quantum communication has\nbeen studied. Specifically, we have investigated the effect of amplitude\ndamping, phase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude damping, Pauli type as\nwell as various collective noise models on the protocols of quantum key\ndistribution, quantum key agreement,quantum secure direct quantum communication\nand quantum dialogue. From each type of protocol of secure quantum\ncommunication, we have chosen two protocols for our comparative study; one\nbased on single qubit states and the other one on entangled states. The\ncomparative study reported here has revealed that single-qubit-based schemes\nare generally found to perform better in the presence of amplitude damping,\nphase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude damping noises, while\nentanglement-based protocols turn out to be preferable in the presence of\ncollective noises. It is also observed that the effect of noise entirely\ndepends upon the number of rounds of quantum communication involved in a scheme\nof quantum communication. Further, it is observed that squeezing, a completely\nquantum mechanical resource present in the squeezed generalized amplitude\nchannel, can be used in a beneficial way as it may yield higher fidelity\ncompared to the corresponding zero squeezing case.\n", "  The prospect of quantum simulating lattice gauge theories opens exciting\npossibilities for understanding fundamental forms of matter. Here, we show that\ntrapped ions represent a promising platform in this context when simultaneously\nexploiting internal pseudo-spins and external phonon vibrations. We illustrate\nour ideas with two complementary proposals for simulating lattice-regularized\nquantum electrodynamics (QED) in (1+1) space-time dimensions. The first scheme\nreplaces the gauge fields by local vibrations with a high occupation number. By\nnumerical finite-size scaling, we demonstrate that this model recovers Wilson's\nlattice gauge theory in a controlled way. Its implementation can be scaled up\nto tens of ions in an array of micro-traps. The second scheme represents the\ngauge fields by spins 1/2, and thus simulates a quantum link model. As we show,\nthis allows the fermionic matter to be replaced by bosonic degrees of freedom,\npermitting small-scale implementations in a linear Paul trap. Both schemes work\non energy scales significantly larger than typical decoherence rates in\nexperiments, thus enabling the investigation of phenomena such as string\nbreaking, Coleman's quantum phase transition, and false-vacuum decay. The\nunderlying ideas of the proposed analog simulation schemes may also be adapted\nto other platforms, such as superconducting qubits.\n", "  In many real life situations, it is observed that the first digits (i.e.,\n$1,2,\\ldots,9$) of a numerical data-set, which is expressed using decimal\nsystem, do not follow a random distribution. Instead, smaller numbers are\nfavoured by nature in accordance with a logarithmic distribution law, which is\nreferred to as Benford's law. The existence and applicability of this empirical\nlaw have been extensively studied by physicists, accountants, computer\nscientists, mathematicians, statisticians, etc., and it has been observed that\na large number of data-sets related to diverse problems follow this\ndistribution. However, applicability of Benford's law has been hardly tested\nfor extrasolar objects. Motivated by this fact, this paper investigates the\nexistence of Benford's distribution in the extrasolar world using Kepler data\nfor exoplanets. The investigation has revealed the presence of Benford's\ndistribution in various physical properties of these exoplanets. Further,\nBenford goodness parameters are computed to provide a quantitative measure of\ncoincidence of real data with the ideal values obtained from Benford's\ndistribution. The quantitative analysis and the plots have revealed that\nseveral physical parameters associated with the exoplanets (e.g., mass, volume,\ndensity, orbital semi-major axis, orbital period, and radial velocity) nicely\nfollow Benford's distribution, whereas some physical parameters (e.g., total\nproper motion, stellar age and stellar distance) moderately follow the\ndistribution, and some others (e.g., longitude, radius, and effective\ntemperature) do not follow Benford's distribution. Further, some specific\ncomments have been made on the possible generalizations of the obtained result,\nits potential applications in analyzing data-set of candidate exoplanets, and\nhow interested readers can perform similar investigations on other interesting\ndata-sets.\n", "  The angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the superconductor\n(Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)Fe$_2$As$_2$ have been investigated both experimentally and\ntheoretically. Our results explain the previously obscured origins of all\nsalient features of the ARPES response of this paradigm pnictide compound and\nreveal the origin of the Lifshitz transition. Comparison of calculated ARPES\nspectra with the underlying DMFT band structure shows an important impact of\nfinal state effects, which results for three-dimensional states in a deviation\nof the ARPES spectra from the true spectral function. In particular, the\napparent effective mass enhancement seen in the ARPES response is not an\nentirely intrinsic property of the quasiparticle valence bands but may have a\nsignificant extrinsic contribution from the photoemission process and thus\ndiffer from its true value. Because this effect is more pronounced for low\nphotoexcitation energies, soft-X-ray ARPES delivers more accurate values of the\nmass enhancement due to a sharp definition of the 3D electron momentum.\n", "  A new method for calculating the critical point parameters (density,\ntemperature, pressure and electrical conductivity) and binodal of vapor-liquid\n(dielectric-metal) phase transition is proposed. It is based on the assumption\nthat cohesion, which determines the main properties of solid state, also\ndetermines the properties in the vicinity of the critical point. Comparison\nwith experimental and theoretical data available for transition metals is made.\n", "  Controlling size and shape of semiconducting nanocrystals advances\nnanoelectronics and photonics. Quantum confined, inexpensive, solution derived\nmetal halide perovskites offer narrow band, color-pure emitters as integral\nparts of next-generation displays and optoelectronic devices. We use nanoporous\nsilicon and alumina thin films as templates for the growth of perovskite\nnanocrystallites directly within device-relevant architectures without the use\nof colloidal stabilization. We find significantly blue shifted\nphotoluminescence emission by reducing the pore size; normally\ninfrared-emitting materials become visibly red, green-emitting materials cyan\nand blue. Confining perovskite nanocrystals within porous oxide thin films\ndrastically increases photoluminescence stability as the templates auspiciously\nserve as encapsulation. We quantify the template-induced size of the perovskite\ncrystals in nanoporous silicon with microfocus high-energy X-ray depth\nprofiling in transmission geometry, verifying the growth of perovskite\nnanocrystals throughout the entire thickness of the nanoporous films.\nLow-voltage electroluminescent diodes with narrow, blue-shifted emission\nfabricated from nanocrystalline perovskites grown in embedded nanoporous\nalumina thin films substantiate our general concept for next generation\nphotonic devices.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range may constitute the galactic dark\nmatter. Various proposed direct detection and laboratory searches are reviewed.\nThe most promising method in the near future is complete energy-momentum\nreconstruction of individual beta-decay or K-capture events, using atoms\nsuspended in a magneto-optical trap. A survey of suitable isotopes is\npresented, together with the measurement precision required in a typical\nexperimental configuration. It is concluded that among the most promising are\nthe K-capture isotopes 131Cs, which requires measurement of an X-ray and\nseveral Auger electrons in addition to the atomic recoil, and 7Be which has\nonly a single decay product but needs development work to achieve a trapped\nsource. A number of background effects are discussed. It is concluded that\nsterile neutrinos with masses down to the 5-10 keV region would be detectable,\ntogether with relative couplings down to the level 10-10-10-11 in a 1-2 year\nrunning time.\n", "  The proper application of the virial theorem to the origin of osmotic\npressure provides a simple, vivid and complete explanation of the physical\nprocesses involved; osmosis is driven by differential solvent pressures. This\nsimple and intuitive notion is widely disregarded, but the virial theorem\nallows an exact formulation and unifies a number of different treatments. It is\nclosely related to a kinetic treatment devised by Ehrenfest over 100 years ago.\n", "  Entanglement and entropy are key concepts standing at the foundations of\nquantum and statistical mechanics, respectively. In the last decade the study\nof quantum quenches revealed that these two concepts are intricately\nintertwined. Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial\nstate maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the\nquench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble\nwith non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the\nentanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the\npost-quench entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in\nisolated quantum systems. An exact computation of the entanglement dynamics has\nbeen provided only for non-interacting systems, and it was believed to be\nunfeasible for genuinely interacting models. Conversely, here we show that the\nstandard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with\nintegrability-based knowledge of the asymptotic state, leads to a complete\nanalytical understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space-time scaling\nlimit. Our framework requires only knowledge about the steady state, and the\nvelocities of the low-lying excitations around it. We provide a thorough check\nof our result focusing on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain, and considering\nquenches from several initial states. We compare our results with numerical\nsimulations using both tDMRG and iTEBD, finding always perfect agreement.\n", "  In this paper we numerically calculate the out-of-time-order correlation\nfunctions in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Our study is motivated by\nthe conjecture that a system with Lyapunov exponent saturating the upper bound\n$2\\pi/\\beta$ will have a holographic dual to a black hole at finite\ntemperature. We further conjecture that for a many-body quantum system with a\nquantum phase transition, the Lyapunov exponent will have a peak in the quantum\ncritical region where there exists an emergent conformal symmetry and is absent\nof well-defined quasi-particles. With the help of a relation between the\nR\\'enyi entropy and the out-of-time-order correlation function, we argue that\nthe out-of-time-order correlation function of the Bose-Hubbard model will also\nexhibit an exponential behavior at the scrambling time. By fitting the\nnumerical results with an exponential function, we extract the Lyapunov\nexponents in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model across the quantum critical\nregime at finite temperature. Our results on the Bose-Hubbard model support the\nconjecture. We also compute the butterfly velocity and propose how the echo\ntype measurement of this correlator in the cold atom realizations of the\nBose-Hubbard model without inverting the Hamiltonian.\n", "  We explore the relationship between approximate symmetries of a gapped\nHamiltonian and the structure of its ground space. We start by showing that\napproximate symmetry operators---unitary operators whose commutators with the\nHamiltonian have norms that are sufficiently small---which possess certain\nmutual commutation relations can be restricted to the ground space with low\ndistortion. We generalize the Stone-von Neumann theorem to matrices that\napproximately satisfy the canonical (Heisenberg-Weyl-type) commutation\nrelations, and use this to show that approximate symmetry operators can certify\nthe degeneracy of the ground space even though they only approximately form a\ngroup. Importantly, the notions of \"approximate\" and \"small\" are all\nindependent of the dimension of the ambient Hilbert space, and depend only on\nthe degeneracy in the ground space. Our analysis additionally holds for any\ngapped band of sufficiently small width in the excited spectrum of the\nHamiltonian, and we discuss applications of these ideas to topological quantum\nphases of matter and topological quantum error correcting codes. Finally, in\nour analysis we also provide an exponential improvement upon bounds concerning\nthe existence of shared approximate eigenvectors of approximately commuting\noperators which may be of independent interest.\n", "  A set of schemes for secure quantum communication are analyzed under the\ninfluence of non-Markovian channels. By comparing with the corresponding\nMarkovian cases, it is seen that the average fidelity in all these schemes can\nbe maintained for relatively longer periods of time. The effects of\nnon-Markovian noise on a number of facets of quantum cryptography, such as\nquantum secure direct communication, deterministic secure quantum communication\nand their controlled counterparts, quantum dialogue, quantum key distribution,\nquantum key agreement, etc., have been extensively investigated. Specifically,\na scheme for controlled quantum dialogue (CQD) is analyzed over damping,\ndephasing and depolarizing non-Markovian channels, and subsequently, the effect\nof these non-Markovian channels on the other schemes of secure quantum\ncommunication is deduced from the results obtained for CQD. The damped\nnon-Markovian channel causes, a periodic revival in the fidelity; while\nfidelity is observed to be sustained under the influence of the dephasing\nnon-Markovian channel. The depolarizing channel, as well as the other\nnon-Markovian channels discussed here, show that the obtained average fidelity\nsubjected to noisy environment depends on the strength of coupling between the\nquantum system with its surroundings and the number of rounds of quantum\ncommunication involved in a particular scheme.\n", "  We review recent developments on the thermodynamics of black holes in\nextended phase space, where the cosmological constant is interpreted as\nthermodynamic pressure and treated as a thermodynamic variable in its own\nright. In this approach, the mass of the black hole is no longer regarded as\ninternal energy, rather it is identified with the chemical enthalpy. This leads\nto an extended dictionary for black hole thermodynamic quantities, in\nparticular a notion of thermodynamic volume emerges for a given black hole\nspacetime. This volume is conjectured to satisfy the reverse isoperimetric\ninequality - an inequality imposing a bound on the amount of entropy black hole\ncan carry for a fixed thermodynamic volume. New thermodynamic phase transitions\nnaturally emerge from these identifications. Namely, we show that black holes\ncan be understood from the viewpoint of chemistry, in terms of concepts such as\nVan der Waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points. We also\nreview the recent attempts at extending the AdS/CFT dictionary in this setting,\ndiscuss the connections with horizon thermodynamics, applications to Lifshitz\nspacetimes, and outline possible future directions in this field.\n", "  In frustrated systems, some or many states are competed due to frustration of\nexchange interactions, and this competition often results in exotic states,\nsuch as spin liquid and chiral orders. We consider a pyrochlore oxide, a\nthree-dimensional frustrated system, and study its $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ effective\nmodel, consisting of the Heisenberg-type and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya-type\nsuperexchange interactions between the nearest-neighbor transition-metal ions.\nWe show that by using new multiorbital effects of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals on\ncoefficients of those interactions, we can change the effective dimensionality\nfrom three-dimensional to two-dimensional, and control the competition between\nchiral orders and spin liquid. We also show that the new multiorbital effects\nare vital to stabilize three-in-one-out chiral order, distorted\nfour-in-four-out chiral order, and distorted three-in-one-out chiral order, and\ncan be used to hold macroscopic degeneracy, resulting in the spin liquid, even\nwith the finite Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions. Those results open up new\nmultiorbital physics in spin systems, and make the essential step for the\nrealistic mechanism for the spin liquid in pyrochlore oxides.\n", "  The effect of non-orthogonality of an entangled non-orthogonal state based\nquantum channel is investigated in detail in the context of the teleportation\nof a qubit. Specifically, average fidelity, minimum fidelity and minimum\nassured fidelity (MASFI) are obtained for teleportation of a single qubit state\nusing all the Bell type entangled non-orthogonal states known as quasi Bell\nstates. Using Horodecki criterion, it is shown that the teleportation scheme\nobtained by replacing the quantum channel (Bell state) of the usual\nteleportation scheme by a quasi Bell state is optimal. Further, the performance\nof various quasi Bell states as teleportation channel is compared in an ideal\nsituation (i.e., in the absence of noise) and under different noise models\n(e.g., amplitude and phase damping channels). It is observed that the best\nchoice of the quasi Bell state depends on the amount non-orthogonality, both in\nnoisy and noiseless case. A specific quasi Bell state, which was found to be\nmaximally entangled in the ideal conditions, is shown to be less efficient as a\nteleportation channel compared to other quasi Bell states in particular cases\nwhen subjected to noisy channels. It has also been observed that usually the\nvalue of average fidelity falls with an increase in the number of qubits\nexposed to noisy channels (viz., Alice's, Bob's and to be teleported qubits),\nbut the converse may be observed in some particular cases.\n", "  The large curvature effects on micromagnetic energy of a thin ferromagnetic\nfilm with nonlocal dipolar energy are considered. We predict that the dipolar\ninteraction and surface curvature can produce perpendicular anisotropy which\ncan be controlled by engineering a special type of periodic surface shape\nstructure. Similar effects can be achieved by a significant surface roughness\nin the film. We show that in general the anisotropy can point in an arbitrary\ndirection depending on the surface curvature. We provide simple examples of\nthese periodic surface structures to demonstrate how to engineer particular\nanisotropies in the film.\n", "  When encountering novel objects, humans are able to infer a wide range of\nphysical properties such as mass, friction and deformability by interacting\nwith them in a goal driven way. This process of active interaction is in the\nsame spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts.\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can\nachieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and\ncomplex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival\nthe scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a\nbasic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and\ncohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can\nmanipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art\ndeep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments\nnecessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating\nthe problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing\nexperiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the\ncost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different\nsituations.\n", "  We find that singlet superconducting pairing can lead to Majorana fermions in\nthree dimensional Dirac superconductors (3DDS) if the pairing order parameter\nis a pseudo-scalar, i.e. it changes sign under mirror reflection. The\npseudo-scalar superconducting order parameter, $\\Delta_5$ can close and reopen\nthe spectral gap caused by the scalar Dirac mass $m$ in a three-dimensional\nDirac material (3DDM), giving rise to a two-dimensional Majorana sea (2DMS) at\nthe plane of the gap kink. By bringing the Hamiltonian into a canonical form\nwhich then gives the winding number, we show that this system belongs to the\nDIII class of topological superconductors. We calculate the transport signature\nof 2DMS, namely a perfect Andreev-Klein transmission that manifests in a robust\npeak in the differential conductance. Further, we find the $4\\pi$ periodicity\nin the $\\Delta_5|m|\\Delta_5$ Josephson junc- tions. Gauge transformed version\nof the present scenario implies that the interface of a conventional s-wave\nsuperconductor with a peculiar 3DDM whose mass is a pseudo-scalar, m5 also\nhosts a 2DMS.\n", "  Particle tagging is an efficient, but approximate, technique for using\ncosmological N-body simulations to model the phase-space evolution of the\nstellar populations predicted, for example, by a semi-analytic model of galaxy\nformation. We test the technique developed by Cooper et al. (which we call\nSTINGS here) by comparing particle tags with stars in a smooth particle\nhydrodynamic (SPH) simulation. We focus on the spherically averaged density\nprofile of stars accreted from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way (MW)-like\nsystem. The stellar profile in the SPH simulation can be recovered accurately\nby tagging dark matter (DM) particles in the same simulation according to a\nprescription based on the rank order of particle binding energy. Applying the\nsame prescription to an N-body version of this simulation produces a density\nprofile differing from that of the SPH simulation by <10 per cent on average\nbetween 1 and 200 kpc. This confirms that particle tagging can provide a\nfaithful and robust approximation to a self-consistent hydrodynamical\nsimulation in this regime (in contradiction to previous claims in the\nliterature). We find only one systematic effect, likely due to the\ncollisionless approximation, namely that massive satellites in the SPH\nsimulation are disrupted somewhat earlier than their collisionless\ncounterparts. In most cases this makes remarkably little difference to the\nspherically averaged distribution of their stellar debris. We conclude that,\nfor galaxy formation models that do not predict strong baryonic effects on the\npresent-day DM distribution of MW-like galaxies or their satellites,\ndifferences in stellar halo predictions associated with the treatment of star\nformation and feedback are much more important than those associated with the\ndynamical limitations of collisionless particle tagging.\n", "  We analyse and interpret the effects of breaking detailed balance on the\nconvergence to equilibrium of conservative interacting particle systems and\ntheir hydrodynamic scaling limits. For finite systems of interacting particles,\nwe review existing results showing that irreversible processes converge faster\nto their steady state than reversible ones. We show how this behaviour appears\nin the hydrodynamic limit of such processes, as described by macroscopic\nfluctuation theory, and we provide a quantitative expression for the\nacceleration of convergence in this setting. We give a geometrical\ninterpretation of this acceleration, in terms of currents that are\n\\emph{antisymmetric} under time-reversal and orthogonal to the free energy\ngradient, which act to drive the system away from states where (reversible)\ngradient-descent dynamics result in slow convergence to equilibrium.\n", "  We demonstrate an optical single qubit based on 6S1/2 to 5D5/2 quadrupole\ntransition of a single Ba+ ion operated by diode based lasers only. The\nresonance wavelength of the 6S1/2 to 5D5/2 quadrupole transition is about 1762\nnm which suitably falls close to the U-band of the telecommunication\nwavelength. Thus this qubit is a naturally attractive choice towards\nimplementation of quantum repeater or quantum networks using existing\ntelecommunication networks. We observe continuous bit-flip oscillations at a\nrate of about 250 kHz which is fast enough for the qubit operation as compared\nto the measured coherence time of over 3 ms. We also present a technique to\nquantify the bit-flip error in each qubit NOT gate operation.\n", "  Grover's unstructured search algorithm is one of the best examples to date\nfor the superiority of quantum algorithms over classical ones. Its\napplicability, however, has been questioned by many due to its oracular nature.\nWe propose a mechanism to carry out a quantum adiabatic variant of Grover's\nsearch algorithm using a single bosonic particle placed in an optical lattice.\nBy studying the scaling of the gap and relevant matrix element in various\nspatial dimensions, we show that a quantum speedup can already be gained in\nthree dimensions. We argue that the suggested scheme is realizable with\npresent-day experimental capabilities.\n", "  A relationship is derived between differences in electric polarization\nbetween bands and the \"shift vector\" that controls part of a material's bulk\nphotocurrent, then demonstrated in several models. Electric polarization has a\nquantized gauge ambiguity and is normally observed at surfaces via the surface\ncharge density, while shift current is a bulk property and is described by\nshift vector gauge invariant at each point in momentum space. They are\nconnected because the same optical transitions that are described in shift\ncurrents pick out a relative gauge between valence and conduction bands. We\nalso discuss subtleties arising when there are points at the Brillouin zone\nwhere optical transitions are absent. We conclude that two-dimensional\nmaterials with significant interband polarization differences should have high\nbulk photocurrent, meaning that the modern theory of polarization can be used\nas a straightforward way to search for bulk photovoltaic material candidates.\n", "  The hallmark of Weyl semimetals is the existence of open constant-energy\ncontours on their surface -- the so-called Fermi arcs -- connecting Weyl\npoints. Here, we show that for time-reversal symmetric realizations of Weyl\nsemimetals these Fermi arcs in many cases coexist with closed Fermi pockets\noriginating from surface Dirac cones pinned to time-reversal invariant momenta.\nThe existence of Fermi pockets is required for certain Fermi-arc connectivities\ndue to additional restrictions imposed by the six $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological\ninvariants characterizing a generic time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetal. We\nshow that a change of the Fermi-arc connectivity generally leads to a different\ntopology of the surface Fermi surface, and identify the half-Heusler compound\nLaPtBi under in-plane compressive strain as a material that realizes this\nsurface Lifshitz transition. We also discuss universal features of this\ncoexistence in quasi-particle interference spectra.\n", "  It has been proposed to investigate the equilibration properties of a small\nisolated quantum system by means of the matrix of asymptotic transition\nprobabilities in some preferential basis. The trace $T$ of this matrix measures\nthe degree of equilibration of the system prepared in a typical state of the\npreferential basis. This quantity may vary between unity (ideal equilibration)\nand the dimension $N$ of the Hilbert space (no equilibration at all). Here we\nanalyze several examples of simple systems where the behavior of $T$ can be\ninvestigated by analytical means. We first study the statistics of $T$ when the\nHamiltonian governing the dynamics is random and drawn from a distribution\ninvariant under the group U$(N)$ or O$(N)$. We then investigate a quantum spin\n$S$ in a tilted magnetic field making an arbitrary angle with the preferred\nquantization axis, as well as a tight-binding particle on a finite electrified\nchain. The last two cases provide examples of the interesting situation where\nvarying a system parameter -- such as the tilt angle or the electric field --\nthrough some scaling regime induces a continuous transition from good to bad\nequilibration properties.\n", "  Absolutely separable states $\\varrho$ remain separable under arbitrary\nunitary transformations $U \\varrho U^{\\dag}$. By example of a three qubit\nsystem we show that in multipartite scenario neither full separability implies\nbipartite absolute separability nor the reverse statement holds. The main goal\nof the paper is to analyze quantum maps resulting in absolutely separable\noutput states. Such absolutely separating maps affect the states in a way, when\nno Hamiltonian dynamics can make them entangled afterwards. We study general\nproperties of absolutely separating maps and channels with respect to\nbipartitions and multipartitions and show that absolutely separating maps are\nnot necessarily entanglement breaking. We examine stability of absolutely\nseparating maps under tensor product and show that $\\Phi^{\\otimes N}$ is\nabsolutely separating for any $N$ if and only if $\\Phi$ is the tracing map.\nParticular results are obtained for families of local unital multiqubit\nchannels, global generalized Pauli channels, and combination of identity,\ntransposition, and tracing maps acting on states of arbitrary dimension. We\nalso study the interplay between local and global noise components in\nabsolutely separating bipartite depolarizing maps and discuss the input states\nwith high resistance to absolute separability.\n", "  We consider scattering by star-shaped obstacles in hyperbolic space and show\nthat resonances satisfy a universal bound $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\lambda \\leq\n-\\frac{1}{2}$ which is optimal in dimension $2$. In odd dimensions we also show\nthat $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\lambda \\leq -\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}$ for a universal constant\n$\\mu$, where $\\rho$ is the radius of a ball containing the obstacle; this gives\nan improvement for small obstacles. In dimensions $3$ and higher the proofs\nfollow the classical vector field approach of Morawetz, while in dimension $2$\nwe obtain our bound by working with spaces coming from general relativity. We\nalso show that in odd dimensions resonances of small obstacles are close, in a\nsuitable sense, to Euclidean resonances.\n", "  Within the block spin renormalization group we are able to construct the\n\"exact\" phase diagram of the XYZ spin chain. First we identify the Ising order\nalong $\\hat x$ or $\\hat y$ as attractive renormalization group fixed points of\nthe Kitaev chain. Then in a global phase space composed of the anisotropy\n$\\lambda$ of the XY interaction and the coupling $\\Delta$ of the\n$\\Delta\\sigma^z\\sigma^z$ interaction we find that the above fixed points remain\nattractive in the two dimesional parameter space. We therefore classify the\ngapped phases of the XYZ spin chain as: (1) either attracted to the Ising limit\nof the Kitaev-chain which in turn is characterized by winding number $\\pm 1$\ndepending whether the Ising order parameter is along $\\hat x$ or $\\hat y$\ndirections; or (2) attracted to the Mott phases of the underlying Jordan-Wigner\nfermions which is characterized by zero winding number. We therefore establish\nthat the exact phase boundaries of the XYZ model in Baxter's solution indeed\ncorrespond to topological phase transitions. The topological nature of the\nphase transitions of the XYZ model justifies why our analytical solution of the\nthree-site problem which is at the core of the renormalization group treatment\nis able to produce the exact phase diagram of Baxter's solution. We argue that\nthe distribution of the winding numbers between the three Ising phases is a\nmatter of choice of the coordinate system, and therefore the Mott-Ising phase\nis entitled to host apprpriate form of zero modes. We further observe that the\nrenormalization group flow can be cast into a geometric progression of a\nproperly identified parameter. We show that this new parameter is actually the\nsize of the (Majorana) zero modes.\n", "  We study two dispersive regimes in the dynamics of $N$ two-level atoms\ninteracting with a bosonic mode for long interaction times. Firstly, we analyze\nthe dispersive multiqubit quantum Rabi model for the regime in which the qubit\nfrequencies are equal and smaller than the mode frequency, and for values of\nthe coupling strength similar or larger than the mode frequency, namely, the\ndeep strong coupling regime. Secondly, we address an interaction that is\ndependent on the photon number, where the coupling strength is comparable to\nthe geometric mean of the qubit and mode frequencies. We show that the\nassociated dynamics is analytically tractable and provide useful frameworks\nwith which to analyze the system behavior. In the deep strong coupling regime,\nwe unveil the structure of unexpected resonances for specific values of the\ncoupling, present for $N\\ge2$, and in the photon-number-dependent regime we\ndemonstrate that all the nontrivial dynamical behavior occurs in the atomic\ndegrees of freedom for a given Fock state. We verify these assertions with\nnumerical simulations of the qubit population and photon-statistic dynamics.\n", "  The $d$-dimensional long-range Ising model, defined by spin-spin interactions\ndecaying with the distance as the power $1/r^{d+s}$, admits a second order\nphase transition with continuously varying critical exponents. At $s = s_*$,\nthe phase transition crosses over to the usual short-range universality class.\nThe standard field-theoretic description of this family of models is strongly\ncoupled at the crossover. We find a new description, which is instead weakly\ncoupled near the crossover, and use it to compute critical exponents. The\nexistence of two complementary UV descriptions of the same long-range fixed\npoint provides a novel example of infrared duality.\n", "  Monolayer films of FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrates exhibit significantly\nhigher superconducting transition temperatures than those of bulk FeSe.\nInteraction of electrons in the FeSe layer with dipolar SrTiO$_3$ phonons has\nbeen suggested as the cause of the enhanced transition temperature. In this\npaper we systematically study the coupling of SrTiO$_3$ longitudinal optical\nphonons to the FeSe electron, including also electron-electron Coulomb\ninteractions at the random phase approximation level. We find that the\nelectron-phonon interaction between FeSe and SrTiO$_3$ substrate is almost\nentirely screened by the electronic fluctuations in the FeSe monolayer, so that\nthe net electron-phonon interaction is very weak and unlikely to lead to\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We demonstrate determination of the location of the distal-end of a\nfibre-optic device deep in tissue through the imaging of ballistic and snake\nphotons using a time resolved single-photon detector array. The fibre was\nimaged with centimetre resolution, within clinically relevant settings and\nmodels. This technique can overcome the limitations imposed by tissue\nscattering in optically determining the in vivo location of fibre-optic medical\ninstruments.\n", "  Matrix Product Vectors form the appropriate framework to study and classify\none-dimensional quantum systems. In this work, we develop the structure theory\nof Matrix Product Unitary operators (MPUs) which appear e.g. in the description\nof time evolutions of one-dimensional systems. We prove that all MPUs have a\nstrict causal cone, making them Quantum Cellular Automata (QCAs), and derive a\ncanonical form for MPUs which relates different MPU representations of the same\nunitary through a local gauge. We use this canonical form to prove an Index\nTheorem for MPUs which gives the precise conditions under which two MPUs are\nadiabatically connected, providing an alternative derivation to that of\n[Commun. Math. Phys. 310, 419 (2012), arXiv:0910.3675] for QCAs. We also\ndiscuss the effect of symmetries on the MPU classification. In particular, we\ncharacterize the tensors corresponding to MPU that are invariant under\nconjugation, time reversal, or transposition. In the first case, we give a full\ncharacterization of all equivalence classes. Finally, we give several examples\nof MPU possessing different symmetries.\n", "  In most semiconductors and insulators the presence of a small density of\ncharged impurities cannot be avoided, but their effect can be reduced by\ncompensation doping, i.e. by introducing defects of opposite charge. Screening\nin such a system leads to the formation of electron-hole puddles, which\ndominate bulk transport, as first recognized by Efros and Shklovskii. Metallic\nsurface states of topological insulators (TI) contribute extra screening\nchannels, suppressing puddles. We investigate the typical length $l_p$, which\ndetermines the distance between puddles and the suppression of puddle formation\nclose to metallic surfaces in the limit where the gap $\\Delta$ is much larger\nthan the typical Coulomb energy $E_c$ of neighboring dopants, $\\Delta \\gg E_c$.\nIn particular, this is relevant for three dimensional Bi-based topological\ninsulators, where $\\Delta/E_c \\sim 100$. Scaling arguments predict $l_p \\sim\n(\\Delta/E_c)^2$. In contrast, we find numerically that $l_p$ is much smaller\nand grows in an extended crossover regime approximately linearly with\n$\\Delta/E_c$ for numerically accessible values, $\\Delta/E_c \\lesssim 35$. We\nshow how a quantitative scaling argument can be used to extrapolate to larger\n$\\Delta/E_c$, where $l_p \\sim (\\Delta/E_c)^2/\\ln(\\Delta/E_c)$. Our results can\nbe used to predict a characteristic thickness of TI thin films, below which the\nsample quality is strongly enhanced.\n", "  We show that the parallel magnetic field-induced increase in the critical\nelectron density for the Anderson transition in a strongly interacting\ntwo-dimensional electron system is caused by the effects of exchange and\ncorrelations. If the transition occurs when electron spins are only partially\npolarized, additional increase in the magnetic field is necessary to achieve\nthe full spin polarization in the insulating state due to the exchange effects.\n", "  We study the probabilistic (conditional) teleportation protocol when the\nentanglement needed to its implementation is given by thermal entanglement,\ni.e., when the entangled resource connecting Alice and Bob is an entangled\nmixed state described by the canonical ensemble density matrix. Specifically,\nthe entangled resource we employ here is given by two interacting spin-1/2\nsystems (two qubits) in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature T.\nThe interaction between the qubits is described by a Heisenberg-like\nHamiltonian, encompassing the Ising, the XX, the XY, the XXX, and XXZ models,\nwith or without external fields. For all those models we show analytically that\nthe probabilistic protocol is exactly equal to the deterministic one whenever\nwe have no external field. However, when we turn on the field the probabilistic\nprotocol outperforms the deterministic one in several interesting ways. Under\ncertain scenarios, for example, the efficiency (average fidelity) of the\nprobabilistic protocol is greater than the deterministic one and increases with\nincreasing temperature, a counterintuitive behavior. We also show regimes in\nwhich the probabilistic protocol operates with relatively high success rates\nand, at the same time, with efficiency greater than the classical limit 2/3, a\nthreshold that cannot be surpassed by any protocol using only classical\nresources (no entanglement shared between Alice and Bob). The deterministic\nprotocol's efficiency under the same conditions is below 2/3, highlighting that\nthe probabilistic protocol is the only one yielding a genuine quantum\nteleportation. We also show that near the quantum critical points for almost\nall those models the qualitative and quantitative behaviors of the efficiency\nchange considerably, even at finite T.\n", "  The fundamental theory of energy networks in different energy forms is\nestablished following an in-depth analysis of the nature of energy for\ncomprehensive energy utilization. The definition of an energy network is given.\nCombining the generalized balance equation of energy in space and the Pfaffian\nequation, the generalized transfer equations of energy in lines (pipes) are\nproposed. The energy variation laws in the transfer processes are investigated.\nTo establish the equations of energy networks, the Kirchhoff's Law in electric\nnetworks is extended to energy networks, which is called the Generalized\nKirchhoff\"s Law. According to the linear phenomenological law, the generalized\nequivalent energy transfer equations with lumped parameters are derived in\nterms of the characteristic equations of energy transfer in lines(pipes).The\nequations are finally unified into a complete energy network equation system\nand its solvability is further discussed. Experiments are carried out on a\ncombined cooling, heating and power(CCHP) system in engineering, the energy\nnetwork theory proposed in this paper is used to model and analyze this system.\nBy comparing the theoretical results obtained by our modeling approach and the\ndata measured in experiments, the energy equations are validated.\n", "  Due to their wide band gaps, III-N materials can exhibit behaviors ranging\nfrom the semiconductor class to the dielectric class. Through an analogy\nbetween a Metal/AlGaN/AlN/GaN diode and a MOS contact, we make use of this dual\nnature and show a direct path to capture the energy band diagram of the nitride\nsystem. We then apply transparency calculations to describe the forward\nconduction regime of a III-N heterojunction diode and demonstrate it realizes a\ntunnel diode, in contrast to its regular Schottky Barrier Diode designation.\nThermionic emission is ruled out and instead, a coherent electron tunneling\nscenario allows to account for transport at room temperature and higher.\n", "  The implementation of the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the XXZ Heisenberg spin\nchain, of arbitrary spin-$s$, in the case, when both reflection matrices have\nthe upper-triangular form is analyzed. The general form of the Bethe vectors is\nstudied. In the particular form, Bethe vectors admit the recurrent procedure,\nwith an appropriate modification, used previously in the case of the XXX\nHeisenberg chain. As expected, these Bethe vectors yield the strikingly simple\nexpression for the off-shell action of the transfer matrix of the chain as well\nas the spectrum of the transfer matrix and the corresponding Bethe equations.\nAs in the XXX case, the so-called quasi-classical limit gives the off-shell\naction of the generating function of the corresponding trigonometric Gaudin\nHamiltonians with boundary terms.\n", "  In the post-Newtonian (PN) regime, the timescale on which the spins of binary\nblack holes precess is much shorter than the radiation-reaction timescale on\nwhich the black holes inspiral to smaller separations. On the precession\ntimescale, the angle between the total and orbital angular momenta oscillates\nwith nutation period $\\tau$, during which the orbital angular momentum\nprecesses about the total angular momentum by an angle $\\alpha$. This defines\ntwo distinct frequencies that vary on the radiation-reaction timescale: the\nnutation frequency $\\omega \\equiv 2\\pi/\\tau$ and the precession frequency\n$\\Omega \\equiv \\alpha/\\tau$. We use analytic solutions for generic spin\nprecession at 2PN order to derive Fourier series for the total and orbital\nangular momenta in which each term is a sinusoid with frequency $\\Omega -\nn\\omega$ for integer $n$. As black holes inspiral, they can pass through\nnutational resonances ($\\Omega = n\\omega$) at which the total angular momentum\ntilts. We derive an approximate expression for this tilt angle and show that it\nis usually less than $10^{-3}$ radians for nutational resonances at binary\nseparations $r > 10M$. The large tilts occurring during transitional precession\n(near zero total angular momentum) are a consequence of such states being\napproximate $n=0$ nutational resonances. Our new Fourier series for the total\nand orbital angular momenta converge rapidly with $n$ providing an intuitive\nand computationally efficient approach to understanding generic precession that\nmay facilitate future calculations of gravitational waveforms in the PN regime.\n", "  In this paper we perform a systematic study of spatially flat\n$[(3+D)+1]$-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmological models with\n$\\Lambda$-term. We consider models that topologically are the product of two\nflat isotropic subspaces with different scale factors. One of these subspaces\nis three-dimensional and represents our space and the other is $D$-dimensional\nand represents extra dimensions. We consider no {\\it ansatz} of the scale\nfactors, which makes our results quite general. With both Einstein-Hilbert and\nGauss-Bonnet contributions in play, $D=3$ and the general $D\\geqslant 4$ cases\nhave slightly different dynamics due to the different structure of the\nequations of motion. We analytically study equations of motion in both cases\nand describe all possible regimes with special interest on the realistic\nregimes. Our analysis suggests that the only realistic regime is the transition\nfrom high-energy (Gauss-Bonnet) Kasner regime, which is the standard\ncosmological singularity in that case, to the anisotropic exponential regime\nwith expanding three and contracting extra dimensions. Availability of this\nregime allows us to put constraint on the value of Gauss-Bonnet coupling\n$\\alpha$ and the $\\Lambda$-term -- this regime appears in two regions on\n$(\\alpha, \\Lambda)$ plane: $\\alpha < 0$, $\\Lambda > 0$, $\\alpha\\Lambda\n\\leqslant 1/2$ and $\\alpha > 0$, $\\alpha\\Lambda \\leqslant (3D^2 - 7D +\n6)/(4D(D-1))$, including entire $\\Lambda < 0$ region. The obtained bounds are\nconfronted with the restrictions on $\\alpha$ and $\\Lambda$ from other\nconsiderations, like causality, entropy-to-viscosity ratio in AdS/CFT and\nothers. Joint analysis constraints ($\\alpha$, $\\Lambda$) even further: $\\alpha\n> 0$, $D \\geqslant 2$ with $(3D^2 - 7D + 6)/(4D(D-1)) \\geqslant \\alpha \\Lambda\n\\geqslant - (D+2)(D+3)(D^2 + 5D + 12)/(8(D^2 + 3D + 6)^2)$.\n", "  We study the generation and evolution of magnetic field in the presence of\nchiral imbalance and gravitational anomaly which gives an additional\ncontribution to the vortical current. The contribution due to gravitational\nanomaly is proportional to $T^2$ which can generate a seed magnetic field\nirrespective of plasma being hirally charged or neutral. We estimate the order\nof magnitude of the magnetic field to be $10^{30}$~G at $T\\sim 10^9$ GeV, with\na typical length scale of the order of $10^{-18}$ cm, which is much smaller\nthan the Hubble radius at that temperature ($10^{-8}$ cm). Moreover, such a\nsystem possesses scaling symmetry. We show that the $T^2$ term in the vorticity\ncurrent along with scaling symmetry leads to more power transfer from lower to\nhigher length scale as compared to only chiral anomaly without scaling\nsymmetry.\n", "  The state of a continuously monitored qubit evolves stochastically,\nexhibiting competition between coherent Hamiltonian dynamics and diffusive\npartial collapse dynamics that follow the measurement record. We couple these\ndistinct types of dynamics together by linearly feeding the collected record\nfor dispersive energy measurements directly back into a coherent Rabi drive\namplitude. Such feedback turns the competition cooperative, and effectively\nstabilizes the qubit state near a target state. We derive the conditions for\nobtaining such dispersive state stabilization and verify the stabilization\nconditions numerically. We include common experimental nonidealities, such as\nenergy decay, environmental dephasing, detector efficiency, and feedback delay,\nand show that the feedback delay has the most significant negative effect on\nthe feedback protocol. Setting the measurement collapse timescale to be long\ncompared to the feedback delay yields the best stabilization.\n", "  We investigate local well-posedness of the initial value problem for Lovelock\nand Horndeski theories of gravity. A necessary condition for local\nwell-posedness is strong hyperbolicity of the equations of motion. Even weak\nhyperbolicity can fail for strong fields so we restrict to weak fields. The\nEinstein equation is known to be strongly hyperbolic in harmonic gauge so we\nstudy Lovelock theories in harmonic gauge. We show that the equation of motion\nis always weakly hyperbolic for weak fields but, in a generic weak-field\nbackground, it is not strongly hyperbolic. For Horndeski theories, we prove\nthat, for weak fields, the equation of motion is always weakly hyperbolic in\nany generalized harmonic gauge. For some Horndeski theories there exists a\ngeneralized harmonic gauge for which the equation of motion is strongly\nhyperbolic in a weak-field background. This includes \"k-essence\" like theories.\nHowever, for more general Horndeski theories, there is no generalized harmonic\ngauge for which the equation of motion is strongly hyperbolic in a generic\nweak-field background. Our results show that the standard method used to\nestablish local well-posedness of the Einstein equation does not extend to\nLovelock or general Horndeski theories. This raises the possibility that these\ntheories may not admit a well-posed initial value problem even for weak fields.\n", "  Testing general relativity in the non-linear, dynamical, strong-field regime\nof gravity is one of the major goals of gravitational wave astrophysics.\nPerforming precision tests of general relativity (GR) requires numerical\ninspiral, merger, and ringdown waveforms for binary black hole (BBH) systems in\ntheories beyond GR. Currently, GR and scalar-tensor gravity are the only\ntheories amenable to numerical simulations. In this article, we present a\nwell-posed perturbation scheme for numerically integrating beyond-GR theories\nthat have a continuous limit to GR. We demonstrate this scheme by simulating\nBBH mergers in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity (dCS), to linear order in the\nperturbation parameter. We present mode waveforms and energy fluxes of the dCS\npseudoscalar field from our numerical simulations. We find good agreement with\nanalytic predictions at early times, including the absence of pseudoscalar\ndipole radiation. We discover new phenomenology only accessible through\nnumerics: a burst of dipole radiation during merger. We also quantify the\nself-consistency of the perturbation scheme. Finally, we estimate bounds that\nGR-consistent LIGO detections could place on the new dCS length scale,\napproximately $\\ell \\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(10)~\\mathrm{km}$.\n", "  Anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) are commonly used in\ncrystallography, chemistry and related fields to describe and quantify thermal\nmotion of atoms. Within the very recent years, these ADPs have become\npredictable by lattice dynamics in combination with first-principles theory.\nHere, we study four very different molecular crystals, namely urea,\nbromomalonic aldehyde, pentachloropyridine, and naphthalene, by\nfirst-principles theory to assess the quality of ADPs calculated in the\nquasi-harmonic approximation. In addition, we predict both thermal expansion\nand thermal motion within the quasi-harmonic approximation and compare the\npredictions with experimental data. Very reliable ADPs are calculated within\nthe quasi-harmonic approximation for all four cases up to at least 200 K, and\nthey turn out to be in better agreement with experiment than the harmonic ones.\nIn one particular case, ADPs can even reliably be predicted up to room\ntemperature. Our results also hint at the importance of normal-mode\nanharmonicity in the calculation of ADPs.\n", "  Near-Eddington radiation from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has significant\ndynamical influence on the surrounding dusty gas, plausibly furnishing AGNs\nwith geometrically thick obscuration. We investigate this paradigm with\nradiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations. The simulations solve the\nmagnetohydrodynamics equations simultaneously with the infrared (IR) and\nultraviolet (UV) radiative transfer (RT) equations; no approximate closure is\nused for RT. We find that our torus, when given a suitable sub-Keplerian\nangular momentum profile, spontaneously evolves toward a state in which its\nopening angle, density distribution, and flow pattern change only slowly. This\n\"steady\" state lasts for as long as there is gas resupply toward the inner\nedge. The torus is best described as a mid-plane inflow and a high-latitude\noutflow. The outflow is launched from the torus inner edge by UV radiation and\nexpands in solid angle as it ascends; IR radiation continues to drive the\nwide-angle outflow outside the central hole. The dusty outflow obscures the\ncentral source in soft X-rays, the IR, and the UV over three quarters of solid\nangle, and each decade in column density covers roughly equal solid angle\naround the central source; these obscuration properties are similar to what\nobservations imply.\n", "  Edge structure of graphene has a significant influence on its electronic\nproperties. However, control over the edge structure of graphene domains on\ninsulating substrates is still challenging. Here we demonstrate edge control of\ngraphene domains on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by modifying ratio of\nworking-gases. Edge directions were determined with the help of both moir\\'e\npattern and atomic-resolution image obtained via atomic force microscopy\nmeasurement. It is believed that the variation on graphene edges mainly\nattributes to different growth rates of armchair and zigzag edges. This work\ndemonstrated here points out a potential approach to fabricate graphene ribbons\non h-BN.\n", "  Lensing of the CMB is an important effect, and is usually modelled by\nremapping the unlensed CMB fields by a lensing deflection. However the lensing\ndeflections also change the photon path so that the emission angle is no longer\northogonal to the background last-scattering surface. We give the first\ncalculation of the emission-angle corrections to the standard lensing\napproximation from dipole (Doppler) sources for temperature and quadrupole\nsources for temperature and polarization. We show that while the corrections\nare negligible for the temperature and E-mode polarization, additional\nlarge-scale B-modes are produced with a white spectrum that dominates those\nfrom post-Born field rotation (curl lensing). On large scales about one percent\nof the total lensing-induced B-mode amplitude is expected to be due to this\neffect. However, the photon emission angle does remain orthogonal to the\nperturbed last-scattering surface due to time delay, and half of the\nlarge-scale emission-angle B modes cancel with B modes from time delay to give\na total contribution of about half a percent. While not important for planned\nobservations, the signal could ultimately limit the ability of delensing to\nreveal low amplitudes of primordial gravitational waves.We also derive the\nrotation of polarization due to multiple deflections between emission and\nobservation. The rotation angle is of quadratic order in the deflection angle,\nand hence negligibly small: polarization typically rotates by less than an\narcsecond, orders of magnitude less than a small-scale image rotates due to\npost-Born field rotation (which is quadratic in the shear). The field-rotation\nB modes dominate the other effects on small scales.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experimental demonstration of a chiral edge mode in an\narray of spinning gyroscopes, we theoretically study the coupled gyration modes\nof topological magnetic solitons, vortices and magnetic bubbles, arranged as a\nhoneycomb lattice. The soliton lattice under suitable conditions is shown to\nsupport a chiral edge mode like its mechanical analogue, the existence of which\ncan be understood by mapping the system to the Haldane model for an electronic\nsystem. The direction of the chiral edge mode is associated with the\ntopological charge of the constituent solitons, which can be manipulated by an\nexternal field or by an electric-current pulse. The direction can also be\ncontrolled by distorting the honeycomb lattice. Our results indicate that the\nlattices of magnetic solitons can serve as reprogrammable topological\nmetamaterials.\n", "  At TeV energies and above gamma rays can induce electromagnetic cascades,\nwhose charged component is sensitive to intervening intergalactic magnetic\nfields (IGMFs). When interpreting gamma-ray measurements in the energy range\nbetween a few GeV and hundreds of TeV, one has to carefully account for effects\ndue to IGMFs, which depend on their strength and power spectrum. Therefore,\ngamma-ray-induced electromagnetic cascades can be used as probes of cosmic\nmagnetism, since their arrival distribution as well as spectral and temporal\nproperties can provide unique information about IGMFs, whose origin and\nproperties are currently poorly understood. In this contribution we present an\nefficient three-dimensional Monte Carlo code for simulations of gamma-ray\npropagation. We focus on the effects of different configurations of IGMFs, in\nparticular magnetic helicity and the power spectrum of stochastic fields, on\nthe morphology of the arrival directions of gamma rays, and discuss the\nprospects for detecting pair haloes around distant blazars.\n", "  Conformal blocks and their AGT relations to LMNS integrals and Nekrasov\nfunctions are best described by \"conformal\" (or Dotsenko-Fateev) matrix models,\nbut in non-Gaussian Dijkgraaf-Vafa phases, where different eigenvalues are\nintegrated along different contours. In such matrix models, the determinant\nrepresentations and integrability are restored only after a peculiar Fourier\ntransform in the numbers of integrations. From the point of view of conformal\nblocks, this is Fourier transform w.r.t. the intermediate dimensions and this\nexplains why such quantities are expressed through tau-functions in Miwa\nparametrization, with external dimensions playing the role of multiplicities.\nIn particular, these determinant representations provide solutions to the\nPainlev\\'e VI equation. We also explain how this pattern looks in the pure\ngauge limit, which is described by the Brezin-Gross-Witten matrix model.\n", "  In the last decades, noncommutative spacetimes and their deformed\nrelativistic symmetries have usually been studied in the context of field\ntheory, replacing the ordinary Minkowski background with an algebra of\nnoncommutative coordinates. However, spacetime noncommutativity can also be\nintroduced into single-particle covariant quantum mechanics, replacing the\ncommuting operators representing the particle's spacetime coordinates with\nnoncommuting ones. In this paper we provide a full characterization of a wide\nclass of physically sensible single-particle noncommutative spacetime models\nand the associated deformed relativistic symmetries. In particular, we prove\nthat they can all be obtained from the standard Minkowski model and the usual\nPoincar\\'e transformations via a suitable change of variables. Contrary to\nprevious studies, we find that spacetime noncommutativity does not affect the\ndispersion relation of a relativistic quantum particle, but only the\ntransformation properties of its spacetime coordinates under translations and\nLorentz transformations.\n", "  Spectrophotometric stability, which is crucial in the spectral\ncharacterization of transiting exoplanets, is affected by photometric\nvariations arising from field-stop loss in space telescopes with pointing\njitter or primary mirror deformation. This paper focuses on a new method for\nremoving slit-loss or field-stop-loss photometric variation through the use of\na pupil mask. Two types of pupil function are introduced: the first uses\nconventional (e.g., Gaussian or hyper-Gaussian) apodizing patterns; whereas the\nsecond, which we call a block-shaped mask, employs a new type of pupil mask\ndesigned for high photometric stability. A methodology for the optimization of\na pupil mask for transit observations is also developed. The block-shaped mask\ncan achieve a photometric stability of $10^{-5}$ for a nearly arbitrary\nfield-stop radius when the pointing jitter is smaller than approximately $0.7\n\\lambda/D $ and a photometric stability of $10^{-6}$ at a pointing jitter\nsmaller than approximately $0.5 \\lambda/D $. The impact of optical aberrations\nand mask imperfections upon mask performance is also discussed.\n", "  A scarcity of known chemical kinetic parameters leads to the use of many\nreaction rate estimates, which are not always sufficiently accurate, in the\nconstruction of detailed kinetic models. To reduce the reliance on these\nestimates and improve the accuracy of predictive kinetic models, we have\ndeveloped a high-throughput, fully automated, reaction rate calculation method,\nAutoTST. The algorithm integrates automated saddle-point geometry search\nmethods and a canonical transition state theory kinetics calculator. The\nautomatically calculated reaction rates compare favorably to existing estimated\nrates. Comparison against high level theoretical calculations show the new\nautomated method performs better than rate estimates when the estimate is made\nby a poor analogy. The method will improve by accounting for internal rotor\ncontributions and by improving methods to determine molecular symmetry.\n", "  Spoof plasmons mimic noble metal plasmons. The equivalent of the plasma\nfrequency is an energy scale imposed by the geometry of the metal grating upon\nwhich they propagate. In this paper we show that the dispersion of spoof\nplasmons in the THz can be controlled placing a doped graphene sheet on the\nproximity of a metallic grating, adding more versatility to this type of\nsystem. We develop a semi-analytical model, based on a perfect-metal\ndiffraction grating. This model allows to reproduce well FDTD calculations for\nthe same problem but with much less computer time. We discuss the optical\nproperties of the system covering a spectral range spanning the interval from\nthe THz to the mid-IR. It is shown that the system can be used as both a\nperfect absorber and a sensing device. For illustrating the latter property we\nhave chosen different alcohols as analytes. The frequency at which perfect\nabsorption appears can be controlled by the geometric parameters of the grating\nand by the value of the Fermi energy in graphene. The theoretical results\npredicted throughout this work can be verified experimentally in the future.\n", "  We have established the relations between the baryon-baryon scattering phase\nshifts and the two-particle energy spectrum in the elongated box. We have\nstudied the cases with both the periodic boundary condition and twisted\nboundary condition in the center of mass frame. The framework is also extended\nto the system of nonzero total momentum with periodic boundary condition in the\nmoving frame. This will be helpful to extract the phase shifts in the continuum\nfrom lattice QCD data using asymmetric volumes.\n", "  List of proceedings from the HAWC Collaboration presented at the 35th\nInternational Cosmic Ray Conference, 12 July - 20 July 2017, Bexco, Busan,\nKorea.\n", "  Scattering and absorption limit the penetration of optical fields into\ntissue, but wavefront correction, often used to compensate for these effects,\nis incompatible with wide field-of-view imaging and complex to implement. We\ndemonstrate a new approach for increased penetration in light-sheet imaging,\nnamely attenuation-compensation of the light field. This tailors an exponential\nintensity increase along the illuminating propagation-invariant field, enabling\nthe redistribution of intensity strategically within a sample. This powerful\nyet straightforward concept, combined with the self-healing of the\npropagation-invariant field, improves the signal-to-background ratio of Airy\nlight-sheet microscopy up to five-fold and the contrast-to-noise ratio up to\neight-fold in thick biological specimens across the field-of-view without any\naberration-correction. This improvement is not limited to Airy beam light-sheet\nmicroscopy, but can also significantly increase the imaging capabilities of\nBessel and lattice light-sheet microscopy techniques, paving the way for\nwidespread uptake by the biomedical community.\n", "  The rich and nearby Coma cluster of galaxies is known to have substructure.\nWe aim to create a more detailed picture of this substructure by searching\ndirectly for bound companions around individual giant members. We have used two\ncatalogs of Coma galaxies, one covering the cluster core for a detailed\nmorphological analysis, another covering the outskirts. The separation limit\nbetween possible companions (secondaries) and giants (primaries) is chosen as\nM_B = -19 and M_R = -20, respectively for the two catalogs. We have created\npseudo-clusters by shuffling positions or velocities of the primaries and\nsearch for significant over-densities of possible companions around giants by\ncomparison with the data. This method was developed and applied first to the\nVirgo cluster by Ferguson (1992). In a second approach we introduced a modified\nnearest neighbor analysis using several interaction parameters for all\ngalaxies. We find evidence for some excesses due to possible companions for\nboth catalogs. Satellites are typically found among the faintest dwarfs (M_B <\n-16) around high-luminosity primaries. The most significant excesses are found\naround very luminous late-type giants (spirals) in the outskirts, which is\nexpected in an infall scenario of cluster evolution. A rough estimate for an\nupper limit of bound galaxies within Coma is 2 - 4 percent, to be compared with\nca. 7 percent for Virgo. The results agree well with the expected low frequency\nof bound companions in a regular cluster such as Coma.\n", "  Non-Riemannian generalization of the standard Born-Infeld (BI) Lagrangian is\nintroduced and analized from a theory of gravitation with dynamical torsion\nfield. The field equations derived from the proposed action lead to a trace\nfree gravitational equation (non-riemannian analog to the trace free equation\n(TFE) from[1][2][3]) and the field equations for the torsion respectively. In\nthis theoretical context, the fundamental constants arise all from the same\ngeometry through geometrical invariant quantities (as from the curvature R).\nNew results involving generation of primordial magnetic fields and the link\nwith leptogenesis and baryogenesis are presented and possible explanations\ngiven. The physically admisible matter fields can be introduced in the model\nvia the torsion vector h. Such fields include some dark matter candidates such\nas axion, right neutrinos and Majorana and moreover, physical observables as\nvorticity can be included in the same way. From a new wormhole soluton in a\ncosmological spacetime with torsion we also show that the primordial cosmic\nmagnetic fields can originate from h? with the axion field (that is contained\nin h) the responsible to control the dynamics and stability of the cosmic\nmagnetic field but not the magnetogenesis itself. The analisys of Grand Unified\nTheories (GUT) in the context of this model indicates (as we have been pointed\nout before) that the group manifold candidates are based in SO(10), SU(5) or\nsome exceptional groups as E(6),E (7), etc.\n", "  In 1980 Binnig et al. reported tunneling measurements on Nb-doped SrTiO3, and\ninterpreted their results as indicating two-band superconductivity in the bulk\nof SrTiO3. However: (1) Effective masses determined from tunneling results in\nthe normal state by Sroubek in 1969 and 1970 are much smaller than those\ndetermined by most other methods. The much smaller masses were attributed to\nproperties of a surface layer by the present author in 1971; (2) The only other\nreports of two-band superconductivity in bulk SrTiO3 can be used to infer much\nsmaller values of band separations than found by Binnig et al.. In this paper\nwe give an alternative explanation of the results of Binnig et al. in terms of\nsuperconductivity in a surface layer. We obtain fair fits to the band gaps\nversus Fermi energy for the two bands in three samples where two surface\nsubbands are occupied and to the temperature dependence of the gaps in one\ncrystal, using a model with three adjustable interaction parameters, an\nadjustable energy for the phonons which dominate the pairing, and an adjustable\nratio for the mean-field Tc to the actual Tc. We show results for a combined\nfit to the low-temoerature band gaps and to the T-dependence in one crystal.\nThe phonon energy which gives the best fit is 21 meV. This is probably an\nappropriate average over the three longitudinal polar modes and acoustic modes\nin the material. A large value of about two is found for the ratio T_(cmf}/Tc,\nand we conjecture that this arises because a band with a small Fermi energy not\nseen in the tunneling results plays a part in increasing T_{cmf}/Tc.\n", "  We discuss the production of the exotic doubly-charmed tetraquark mesons\n${\\rm T}_{{\\rm c}{\\rm c}}({\\rm c}{\\rm c}\\bar{\\rm u}\\bar{\\rm d})$ from\nelectron-positron collisions. ${\\rm T}_{{\\rm c}{\\rm c}}({\\rm c}{\\rm c}\\bar{\\rm\nu}\\bar{\\rm d})$ is a compact exotic hadron whose binding energy is provided by\nthe diquark correlations. We evaluate the production cross section in the\nelectron-positron collisions using the nonrelativistic QCD framework, and\ninvestigate the difference of the production cross section for different color\nconfigurations in two charm quarks (antitriplet and sextet), where the mixing\nof different configurations is suppressed in the heavy quark limit. The total\ncross section is estimated by modeling the nonperturbative fragmentation\nprocess of the charm quark pair into the tetraquark by the wavefunction of the\ntetraquark and the probability of picking up the light quarks. We find that the\ninternal color configurations are distinguishable by the qualitative features\nof the differential cross sections which are independent of the nonperturbative\nmatrix elements.\n", "  We present a case study of a early-type galaxy (ETG) hosting a kinematically\ndistinct core (KDC) formed in a binary high resolution 1:1 spiral galaxy merger\nsimulation. The runtime of the simulation is pushed up to 10Gyr to follow the\ncomplete evolution of various physical properties. To investigate the origin of\nthe KDC, the stellar component residing within the KDC is dissected, revealing\nthat the rotational signal is purely generated by stars that belong to the KDC\nfor at least 0.5Gyr and are newly formed during the merging process. Following\nthe orientation of the total stellar angular momentum of the KDC, we show that\nit performs a motion comparable to the precession of a gyroscope in a\ngravitational potential. We draw the conclusion that the motion of the KDC is a\nsuperposition of an intrinsic rotation and a global precession that gets\ngradually damped over cosmic time. Finally, the stability of the KDC over the\ncomplete runtime of the simulation is investigated by tracing the evolution of\nthe widely used $\\lambda_{R}$ parameter and the misalignment angle\ndistribution. We find that the KDC is stable for about 3Gyr after the merger\nand subsequently disperses completely on a timescale of ~1.5Gyr.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the spectral properties of the moving hollow-core\nphotonic crystal waveguides (PCWs). We find that frequency combs could be\ngenerated in the hollow cores of the moving PCWs. Besides, amplitudes of the\nsidebands in the generated frequency combs are strongly dependent on the\nspatial field distribution of the core-guided modes of stationary PCWs.\nParticularly, we find that introduction of the periodic point defects to the\ninnermost rows of the PCW hollow core would significantly modify the spatial\nfield distributions of the guided modes, leading to appearance of the tightly\nlocalized defect modes. This, in turn, leads to the enhancement and\nequalization of the amplitudes of the side bands in the frequency combs\ngenerated by the moving PCWs.\n", "  Waves play an essential role in many aspects of plasma science, such as\nplasma manipulation and diagnostics. Due to the complexity of the governing\nequations, approximate models are often necessary to describe wave dynamics. In\nthis dissertation, waves are treated as geometric objects of a variational\ntheory rather than formal solutions of specific PDEs. This approach simplifies\ncalculations, highlights the underlying wave symmetries, and leads to improved\nmodeling of wave dynamics. This thesis presents two breakthroughs that were\nobtained in the general theory of waves. The first main contribution is an\nextension and reformulation of geometrical optics (GO) as a first-principle\nLagrangian theory that correctly describes polarization effects, such as\npolarization precession and the polarization-driven bending of ray\ntrajectories, which appear as leading-order corrections to GO. The theory was\napplied to several systems of interest, such as relativistic spin-1/2 particles\nand radio-frequency waves in magnetized plasma. The second main contribution of\nthis thesis is the development of a phase-space method to study basic\nproperties of nonlinear wave--wave interactions. Specifically, I show that\nwaves propagating in modulated media, both classical and quantum, can\nexperience time-averaged refraction caused by effective ponderomotive forces on\nwave rays. This phenomenon is analogous to the ponderomotive effect encountered\nby charged particles in high-frequency electromagnetic fields. I also show that\nphase-space methods can be useful to study problems in the field of wave\nturbulence, such as the nonlinear interaction of high-frequency waves with\nlarge-scale structures. Overall, the results obtained can serve as a basis for\nfuture studies on more complex nonlinear wave--wave interactions, such as\nmodulational instabilities in general wave ensembles or wave turbulence.\n", "  The effects of high pressure on the crystal structure of orthorhombic (Pnma)\nperovskite type cerium scandate have been studied in situ under high pressure\nby means of synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction, using a diamond anvil cell.\nWe have found that the perovskite type crystal structure remains stable up to\n40 GPa, the highest pressure reached in the experiments. The evolution of\nunit-cell parameters with pressure has indicated an anisotropic compression.\nThe room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state is obtained from the\nexperiments. From the evolution of microscopic structural parameters like bond\ndistances and coordination polyhedra of cerium and scandium, the macroscopic\nbehavior of CeScO3 under compression has been explained and reasoned for its\nlarge pressure stability. The reported results are discussed in comparison with\nhigh-pressure results from other perovskites.\n", "  Alastair Graham Walker Cameron was an astrophysicist and planetary scientist\nof broad interests and exceptional originality. A founder of the field of\nnuclear astrophysics, he developed the theoretical understanding of the\nchemical elements\u00e2\u0080\u0099 origins and made pioneering connections between the\nabundances of elements in meteorites to advance the theory that the Moon\noriginated from a giant impact with the young Earth by an object at least the\nsize of Mars. Cameron was an early and persistent exploiter of computer\ntechnology in the theoretical study of complex astronomical systems\u00e2\u0080\u0094including\nnuclear reactions in supernovae, the structure of neutron stars, and planetary\ncollisions.\n", "  We show experimentally how quantum interference can be produced using an\nintegrated quantum system comprising an arch-shaped short quantum wire (or\nquantum point contact, QPC) of 1D electrons and a reflector forming an\nelectronic cavity. On tuning the coupling between the QPC and the electronic\ncavity, fine oscillations are observed when the arch QPC is operated in the\nquasi-1D regime. These oscillations correspond to interference between the 1D\nstates and a state which is similar to the Fabry-Perot state and suppressed by\na small transverse magnetic field of 60mT. Tuning the reflector, we find a peak\nin resistance which follows the behavior expected for a Fano resonance. We\nsuggest that this is an interesting example of a Fano resonance in an open\nsystem which corresponds to interference at or near the Ohmic contacts due to a\ndirectly propagating, reflected discrete path and the continuum states of the\ncavity corresponding to multiple scattering. Remarkably, the Fano factor shows\nan oscillatory behavior taking peaks for each fine oscillation, thus,\nconfirming coupling between the discrete and continuum states. The results\nindicate that such a simple quantum device can be used as building blocks to\ncreate more complex integrated quantum circuits for possible applications\nranging from quantum-information processing to realizing the fundamentals of\ncomplex quantum systems.\n", "  We show that the carrier recombination rate of noncentrosymmetric materials\ncan be strongly modified by spin-orbit coupling. Our proposed mechanism\ninvolves the separation of conduction and valence bands into their respective\nspin components, which changes the transition dipole moments between them. The\nchange in the carrier recombination can be either positive or negative in sign,\nor vary depending on the location of carriers in the Brillouin zone. We have\nperformed a large scale DFT screening study to identify candidate materials\nthat display this effect. We have selected three materials, Pb$_4$SeBr$_6$,\nReTe$_3$Br$_5$, and CsCu(BiS$_2$)$_2$, which span the range of behaviors, and\ndiscuss their electronic band structure in greater detail. We find transition\ndipole moment enhancement factors of up to three orders of magnitude,\nreflecting the physical impact of spin-orbit coupling on the carrier lifetime.\nTherefore, further explorations of the spin-orbit coupling and lattice symmetry\ncould prove to be useful for manipulating the photophysics of materials.\n", "  Theory predicts that Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) in electron storage\nrings should appear in whispering gallery modes. In an idealized model these\nare resonances of the vacuum chamber that are characterized by their high\nfrequencies and concentration of the field near the outer wall of the chamber.\n  The resonant modes imply a series of sharp peaks in the frequency spectrum of\nCSR, and very long wake fields which lead to interbunch communication.\n  Theory and experimental evidence for this behavior will be reviewed.\n", "  The Galactic Diffuse X-ray Emission (GDXE) in the Milky Way Galaxy is\nspatially and spectrally decomposed into the Galactic Center X-ray Emission\n(GCXE), the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE) and the Galactic Bulge X-ray\nEmission (GBXE). The X-ray spectra of the GDXE are characterized by the strong\nK-shell lines of the highly ionized atoms, the brightest are the K-shell\ntransition (principal quantum number transition of $n=2\\rightarrow1$) of\nneutral iron (SXV-He$\\alpha$), He-like iron (FeXXV-He$\\alpha$) and He-like\nsulfur (SXV-He$\\alpha$) lines. Accordingly, the GDXE is composed of a\nhigh-temperature plasma of $\\sim$7 keV (HTP) and a low-temperature plasma of\n$\\sim$1 keV (LTP), which emit the FeXXV-He$\\alpha$ and SXV-He$\\alpha$ lines,\nrespectively. The FeI-K$\\alpha$ line is emitted from nearly neutral irons, and\nhence the third component of the GDXE is a Cool Gas (CG). The FeI-K$\\alpha$\ndistribution in the GCXE region is clumpy (FeI-K$\\alpha$ clump), associated\nwith giant molecular cloud (MC) complexes, Sagittarius A, B, C, D and E, in the\ncentral molecular zone. The origin of the FeI-K$\\alpha$ clumps is the\nfluorescence and Thomson scattering from the MCs irradiated by past big flares\nof the super massive black hole Sagittarius A$^*$. The scale heights and\nequivalent widths of the FeI-K$\\alpha$, FeXXV-He$\\alpha$, and FeXXVI-Ly$\\alpha$\n($n=2\\rightarrow1$ transition of H-like iron) lines are different among the\nGCXE, GBXE and GRXE. Therefore the structure and origin are separately\nexamined. This paper overviews the research history and the present\nunderstandings of the GDXE, in particular focus on the origin of the HTP and CG\nin the GCXE.\n", "  We study the Kepler metrics on Kepler manifolds from the point of view of\nSasakian geometry and Hessian geometry. This establishes a link between the\nproblem of classical gravity and the modern geometric methods in the study of\nAdS/CFT correspondence in string theory.\n", "  Optimal materials to induce bulk photovoltaic effects should lack inversion\nsymmetry and have an optical gap matching the energies of visible radiation.\nFerroelectric perovskite oxides such as BaTiO$_3$ and PbTiO$_3$ exhibit\nsubstantial polarization and stability, but have the disadvantage of\nexcessively large band gaps. We use both density functional theory and\ndynamical mean field theory calculations to design a new class of Mott\nmultiferroics--double perovskite oxides $A_2$VFeO$_6$ ($A$=Ba, Pb, etc). While\nneither perovskite $A$VO$_3$ nor $A$FeO$_3$ is ferroelectric, in the double\nperovskite $A_2$VFeO$_6$ a `complete' charge transfer from V to Fe leads to a\nnon-bulk-like charge configuration--an empty V-$d$ shell and a half-filled\nFe-$d$ shell, giving rise to a polarization comparable to that of ferroelectric\n$A$TiO$_3$. Different from nonmagnetic $A$TiO$_3$, the new double perovskite\noxides have an antiferromagnetic ground state and around room temperatures, are\nparamagnetic Mott insulators. Most importantly, the V $d^0$ state significantly\nreduces the band gap of $A_2$VFeO$_6$, making it smaller than that of\n$A$TiO$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$ and rendering the new multiferroics a promising\ncandidate to induce bulk photovoltaic effects.\n", "  Chiral magnets are magnetically ordered insulators having spin scalar\nchirality, and magnons of chiral magnets have been poorly understood. We study\nthe magnon dispersion and specific heat for four chiral magnets with Q=0 on the\npyrochlore lattice. This study is based on the linear-spin-wave approximation\nfor the S=1/2 effective Hamiltonian consisting of two kinds of Heisenberg\ninteraction and two kinds of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction. We show that the\nthree-in-one-out type chiral magnets possess an optical branch of the magnon\ndispersion near q=0, in addition to three quasiacoustic branches. This differs\nfrom the all-in/all-out type chiral magnets, which possess four quasiacoustic\nbranches. We also show that all four chiral magnets have a gapped magnon energy\nat q=0, indicating the absence of the Goldstone type gapless excitation. These\nresults are useful for experimentally identifying the three-in-one-out or\nall-in/all-out type chiral order. Then, we show that there is no qualitative\ndifference in the specific heat among the four magnets. This indicates that the\nspecific heat is not useful for distinguishing the kinds of chiral orders. We\nfinally compare our results with experiments and provide a proposal for the\nthree-in-one-out type chiral magnets.\n", "  In order to study N-locality without inputs in long lines and in\nconfigurations with loops, e.g. the triangle, we introduce a natural joint\nmeasurement on two qubits different from the usual Bell state measurement. The\nresulting quantum probability $p(a_1,a_2,...,a_N)$ has interesting features. In\nparticular the probability that all results are equal is that large, while\nrespecting full symmetry, that it seems highly implausible that one could\nreproduce it with any N-local model, though - unfortunately - I have not been\nunable to prove it.\n", "  OH radicals play a key role as an intermediate in the water formation\nchemistry of the interstellar medium. For example the reaction of OH radicals\nwith H$_2$ molecules is among the final steps in the astrochemical reaction\nnetwork starting from O, O$_2$, and O$_3$. Experimentally it was shown that\neven at 10 K this reaction occurs on ice surfaces. As the reaction has a high\nactivation energy only atom tunneling can explain such experimental findings.\n  In this study we calculated reaction rate constants for the title reaction on\na water-ice I$_h$ surface. To our knowledge, low-temperature rate constants on\na surface are not available in the literature. All surface calculations were\ndone using a QM/MM framework (BHLYP/TIP3P) after a thorough benchmark of\ndifferent density functionals and basis sets to highly accurate correlation\nmethods. Reaction rate constants are obtained using instanton theory which\ntakes atom tunneling into account inherently, with constants down to 110 K for\nthe Eley-Rideal mechanism and down to 60 K for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood\nmechanism. We found that the reaction is nearly temperature independent below\n80 K. We give kinetic isotope effects for all possible deuteration patterns for\nboth reaction mechanisms. For the implementation in astrochemical networks, we\nalso give fit parameters to a modified Arrhenius equation. Finally, several\ndifferent binding sites and binding energies of OH radicals on the I$_h$\nsurface are discussed and the corresponding rate constants are compared to the\ngas-phase case.\n", "  Quantized Hall conductance and de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation are\nstudied theoretically in the tight-binding model for (TMTSF)$_2$NO$_3$, in\nwhich there are small pockets of electron and hole due to the periodic\npotentials of anion ordering in the $a$-direction. The magnetic field is\ntreated by hoppings as complex numbers due to the phase caused by the vector\npotential, i.e. Peierls substitution. In realistic values of parameters and the\nmagnetic field, the energy as a function of a magnetic field (Hofstadter\nbutterfly diagram) is obtained. It is shown that energy levels are broadened\nand the gaps are closed or almost closed periodically as a function of the\ninverse magnetic field, which are not seen in a semi-classical theory of the\nmagnetic breakdown. Hall conductance is quantized with an integer obtained by\nDiophantine equation when the chemical potential lies in an energy gap. When\nelectrons or holes are doped in this system, Hall conductance is quantized in\nsome regions of a magnetic field but it is not quantized in other regions of a\nmagnetic field due to the broadening of the Landau levels. The amplitude of the\ndHvA oscillation at zero temperature decreases as the magnetic field increases,\nwhile it is constant in the semi-classical Lifshitz Kosevich formula.\n", "  In this work, we have examined how the multi-vacancy defects induced in the\nhorizontal direction change the energetics and the electronic structure of\nsemiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs). The electronic\nstructure of SWCNTs is computed for each deformed configuration by means of\nreal space, Order(N) Tight Binding Molecular Dynamic (O(N) TBMD) simulations.\nEnergy band gap is obtained in real space through the behavior of electronic\ndensity of states (eDOS) near the Fermi level. Vacancies can effectively change\nthe energetics and hence the electronic structure of SWCNTs. In this study, we\nchoose three different kinds of semiconducting zigzag SWCNTs and determine the\nband gap modifications. We have selected (12,0), (13,0) and (14,0) zigzag\nSWCNTs according to n (mod 3) = 0, n (mod 3) = 1 and n (mod 3) = 2\nclassification. (12,0) SWCNT is metallic in its pristine state. The application\nof vacancies opens the electronic band gap and it goes up to 0.13 eV for a di-\nvacancy defected tube. On the other hand (13,0) and (14,0) SWCNTs are\nsemiconductors with energy band gap values of 0.44 eV and 0.55 eV in their\npristine state, respectively. Their energy band gap values decrease to 0.07 eV\nand 0.09 eV when mono-vacancy defects are induced in their horizontal\ndirections. Then the di-vacancy defects open the band gap again. So in both\ncases, the semiconducting-metallic - semiconducting transitions occur. It is\nalso shown that the band gap modification exhibits irreversible\ncharacteristics, which means that band gap values of the nanotubes do not reach\ntheir pristine values with increasing number of vacancies.\n", "  Subluminous Type Ia supernovae, such as the Type Iax class prototype SN\n2002cx, are described by a variety of models such as the failed detonation and\npartial deflagration of an accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf star, or the\nexplosion of an accreting, hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon core. These models predict\nthat bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a\nhigh kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass\nwhite dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic\nescape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass\nelements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was\nejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the\nviability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.\n", "  We investigate insterstellar gas spheres by determining the metric functions,\nthe material distribution, and the features of particle orbits in terms of\nstability and geodesics. An exact solution of the Einstein's equations for\ninterstellar gas clouds is derived that is compatible with the results of\nrecent astronomical measurements. The solution determines the distribution of\npressure and density, and it is suitable to describe the energy, speed,\ntrajectory, and further relevant physical features of the cloud's particles. We\ndescribe the spacetime inside the nebula and give the density profile and the\ngeodesics of particles. We find that circular orbits are stable and the cloud\nrotates rigidly by an angular velocity that is inversely proportional to the\nradius.\n", "  We explore the anomalous behavior of the equatorial quasi-biennial\noscillation (QBO) in zonal wind which it exhibited, since February 2016. In\nmore detail, QBO interrupted its regular pattern and the eastward stratospheric\nwinds unexpectedly reversed to a westward direction. We focus on the temporal\nevolution of the equatorial zonal wind in the altitude region 70 - 10 hPa,\ninvestigating particularly whether this unprecedented event could be considered\nas a result of scaling effect in the equatorial zonal wind. Furthermore, the\nlink between the QBO abnormal behaviour in 2016 with the strong El Ni\\~no event\nis investigated.\n", "  The present paper uses the Galerkin Finite Element Method to numerically\nstudy the triple diffusive boundary layer flow of homogenous nanofluid over\npower-law stretching sheet with the effect of external magnetic field. The\nfluid is composed of nanoparticles along with dissolved solutal particles in\nthe base fluid. The chief mechanisms responsible for enhancement of convective\ntransport phenomenon in nanofluids - Brownian Motion, Diffusiophoresis and\nThermophoresis have been considered. The simulations performed in this study\nare based on the boundary layer approach. Recently proposed heat flux and\nnanoparticle mass flux boundary conditions have been imposed. Heat transfer,\nsolutal mass transfer and nanoparticle mass transfer are investigated for\ndifferent values of controlling parameters i.e. Brownian-motion parameter,\nThermophoresis parameter, magnetic influence parameter and stretching\nparameter. Multiple regression analysis has been performed to verify the\nrelationship among transfer rate parameters and controlling parameters. The\npresent study finds application in insulation of wires, manufacture of tetra\npacks, production of glass fibres, fabrication of various polymer and plastic\nproducts, rubber sheets etc. where the quality merit of desired product depends\non the rate of stretching, external magnetic field and composition of materials\nused.\n", "  This work reports an innovative humidity driven actuation concept based on\nBangham effect using simple nanoporous sol-gel silica thin films as humidity\nresponsive materials. Bilayer shaped actuators, consisting on a\nhumidity-sensitive active nanostructured silica film deposited on a polymeric\nsubstrate (Kapton) were demonstrated as an original mean to convert water\nmolecule adsorption and capillary condensation in useable mechanical work.\nReversible silica surface energy modifications by water adsorption and the\nenergy produced by the rigid silica film contraction, induced by water\ncapillary condensation in mesopores, were finely controlled and used as the\nenergy sources. The influence of the film nanostructure (microporosity,\nmesoporosity) and thickness, and of the polymeric support thickness, on the\nactuation force, on the movement speed, and on the amplitude of displacement\nare clearly evidenced and discussed. We show that the global mechanical\nresponse of such silica-based actuators can be easily adjusted to fabricate a\nhumidity variation triggered tailor-made actuation systems. This first insight\nin hard ceramic stimulus responsive materials may open the door toward new\ngeneration of surface chemistry driven actuation systems.\n", "  We consider the motion of a nonrelativistic electron in the field of two\nstrong monochromatic light waves propagating counter to each other. The wave\nfunction of the electron is obtained by using a quasiclassical approximation\nand perturbation theory.\n", "  In the iron-based superconductors, understanding the relation between\nsuperconductivity and electronic structure upon doping is crucial for exploring\nthe pairing mechanism. Recently it was found that in iron selenide (FeSe),\nenhanced superconductivity (Tc over 40K) can be achieved via electron doping,\nwith the Fermi surface only comprising M-centered electron pockets. Here by\nutilizing surface potassium dosing, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy\n(STM/STS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we studied the\nelectronic structure and superconductivity of (Li0.8Fe0.2OH)FeSe in the deep\nelectron-doped regime. We find that a {\\Gamma}-centered electron band, which\noriginally lies above the Fermi level (EF), can be continuously tuned to cross\nEF and contribute a new electron pocket at {\\Gamma}. When this Lifshitz\ntransition occurs, the superconductivity in the M-centered electron pocket is\nslightly suppressed; while a possible superconducting gap with small size (up\nto ~5 meV) and a dome-like doping dependence is observed on the new {\\Gamma}\nelectron pocket. Upon further K dosing, the system eventually evolves into an\ninsulating state. Our findings provide new clues to understand\nsuperconductivity versus Fermi surface topology and the correlation effect in\nFeSe-based superconductors.\n", "  The formation of a vortex ring from a piston/nozzle apparatus depends on the\nnozzle exit's shape. Here we study the formation mechanism and the evolution of\nasymmetrical rings from notched nozzles using direct numerical simulations.\nThree types of nozzle are used: i) V-notched; ii) A-notched and iii)W-notched\nnozzles. The results show that a distinct main vortex ring is formed following\nthe shape of nozzle exit at initial formation time. However entrainment from\nthe surrounding ambient fluid through the trough locations creates pairs of\nstreamwise structure after the piston stops. This structure connects to the\nleading vortex ring at the trough position and propagates toward the nozzle's\ncenterline. The special topology of the leading ring is augmented by the\ncircumferential flow, which is split into smaller portions around the\ncircumference. This flow drives the evolution of the ring at the later stage;\nexcite instability growth during the flow evolution. The streamwise vortex\ntubes finally collide at the centerline of the nozzle and induce vortex\nreconnection at the end of the formation. This formation process is consistent\nin all examined cases, which suggests that it might be applicable for more\ncomplex nozzle cases.\n", "  The EPEAD and HEPAD instruments on the GOES spacecraft have served over many\nyears as monitors of the solar particles intensities, surveying the Sun and\nmeasuring in situ its effect on the near-Earth solar-terrestrial environment.\nHowever, the reconstruction of the differential energy spectra is affected by\nlarge uncertainties related to the poor energy resolution, the small\ngeometrical factor and the high contamination by out-of-acceptance particles.\nIn this work, the high quality data set from the PAMELA space mission is used\nto calibrate the high energy (>80 MeV) proton channels of the EPEAD and the\nHEPAD sensors onboard the GOES-13 and -15, bringing the measured spectral\nintensities in-line with those registered by PAMELA. Suggested corrections\nsignificantly reduce the uncertainties on the response of GOES detectors, thus\nimproving the reliability of the spectroscopic observations of solar energetic\nparticle events.\n", "  Using a technique due to Dadhich, we derive an ellipsoidally symmetric\nrotating metric which reduces to the Yilmaz exponential metric when the\nrotation parameter is set to zero. Like the Kerr metric, this new metric has\nonly two free parameters, mass and angular momentum.\n", "  Cosmic ray intensities (CRIs) recorded by sixteen neutron monitors have been\nused to study its dependence on the tilt angles (TA) of the heliospheric\ncurrent sheet (HCS) during period 1976-2014, which covers three solar activity\ncycles 21, 22 and 23. The median primary rigidity covers the range 16-33 GV.\nOur results have indicated that the CRIs are directly sensitive to, and\norganized by, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and its neutral sheet\ninclinations. The observed differences in the sensitivity of cosmic ray\nintensity to changes in the neutral sheet tilt angles before and after the\nreversal of interplanetary magnetic field polarity have been studied. Much\nstronger intensity-tilt angle correlation was found when the solar magnetic\nfield in the North Polar Region was directed inward than it was outward. The\nrigidity dependence of sensitivities of cosmic rays differs according to the\nIMF polarity, for the periods 1981-1988 and 2001-2008 (qA < 0) it was R-1.00\nand R-1.48 respectively, while for the 1991-1998 epoch (qA > 0) it was R-1.35.\nHysteresis loops between TA and CRIs have been examined during three solar\nactivity cycles 21, 22 and 23. A consider differences in time lags during qA >\n0 and qA < 0 polarity states of the heliosphere have been observed. We also\nfound that the cosmic ray intensity decreases at much faster rate with increase\nof tilt angle during qA < 0 than qA > 0, indicating stronger response to the\ntilt angle changes during qA < 0. Our results are discussed in the light of 3D\nmodulation models including the gradient, curvature drifts and the tilt of the\nheliospheric current sheet.\n", "  Over the years, deep insights into string theory and supersymmetric gauge\ntheories have come from studying geometry emerging from matrix models. In this\nthesis, I study the N=1* and N=2* theories from which an elliptic curve is\nknown to emerge, alongside an elliptic function called the generalized\nresolvent into which the physics is encoded. This is indicative of the common\norigin of the two theories in N=4 SYM. The N=1* Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model is\nintrinsically holomorphic with parameter space corresponding to the upper-half\nplane. The Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model 't Hooft coupling S has been previously\nshown to be holomorphic on the upper-half plane and quasi-modular with respect\nto SL(2,Z). The allowed N=2* coupling is constrained to a Hermitian slice\nthrough the enlarged moduli space of the holomorphic N=1* model. After\nexplicitly constructing the map from the elliptic curve to the eigenvalue\nplane, I argue that the N=1* coupling S encodes data reminiscent of N=2*. A\ncollection of extrema (saddle-points) of S behave curiously like the quantum\ncritical points of N=2* theory. For the first critical point, the match is\nexact. This collection of points lie on the line of degeneration which behaves\nin a sense, like a boundary at infinity. I also show explicitly that the\nemergent elliptic curve along with the generalized resolvent allow one to\nrecover exact eigenvalue densities. At weak coupling, my method reproduces the\ninverse square root of N=2* as well as the Wigner semi-circle in N=1*. At\nstrong coupling in N=1*, I provide encouraging evidence of the parabolic\ndensity arising in the neighborhood of the line of degeneration. To my\nknowledge, the parabolic density has only been observed asymptotically. It is\ninteresting to see evidence that it may be exactly encoded in the other form of\nemergent geometry: the elliptic curve with the generalized resolvent.\n", "  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been conventionally bifurcated into two distinct\ncategories: ``short'' and ``long'' with durations less than and greater than\ntwo seconds respectively. However, there is a lot of literature (although with\nconflicting results) regarding the existence of a third intermediate class. To\ninvestigate this issue, we extend a recent study (arXiv:1612.08235) on\nclassification of GRBs to two dimensions by incorporating the GRB hardness in\naddition to the observed durations. We carry out this unified analysis on GRB\ndatasets from four detectors, viz. BATSE, RHESSI, Swift (observed and intrinsic\nframe), and Fermi-GBM. We consider the duration and hardness features in\nlog-scale for each of these datasets and determine the best-fit parameters\nusing Gaussian Mixture Model. This is followed by information theoretic\ncriterion (AIC and BIC) to determine if a three-component fit is favored\ncompared to a two-component one or vice-versa. For BATSE, we find that both AIC\nand BIC show preference for three components with decisive significance. For\nFermi and RHESSI, both AIC and BIC show preference for two components, although\nthe significance is marginal from AIC, but decisive using BIC. For Swift\ndataset in both the observed and rest frame, we find that three components are\nfavored according to AIC with decisive significance, and two are preferred with\nBIC with marginal to strong significance.\n", "  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) has a wide field-of-view\n(FOV, $\\sim$2sr) and a high duty cycle ($\\sim$95\\%), which make it a powerful\nsurvey and monitoring experiment for sources of TeV gamma rays. We present a\nsystematic survey of gamma-ray sources based on the Fermi 3FHL catalog. Sources\nare restricted to HAWC's FOV (Declination 19$^\\circ$ $\\pm$ 40$^\\circ$) and to\nextragalactic sources with redshift: 0.001 $<$ z $<$ 0.3. Extragalactic\ngamma-ray sources are dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) and TeV\ngamma-ray sources are mostly BL Lac-type blazars. The study of AGNs through\nhigh energy gamma rays has opened a new window into the extreme processes of\nparticle acceleration in the jets of these objects and provides a way to study\nthe photon propagation and extra-galactic background light. We have improved\nthe HAWC sensitivity at low energies (100 GeV to 1 TeV) based on the Crab\npulsar, which is an excellent calibration source for TeV gamma rays. We will\npresent the results of searching for and monitoring nearby AGNs with the\nimproved analysis.\n", "  We present measurements of the second order spatial coherence function of\nthermal light sources using Hanbury-Brown and Twiss interferometry with a\ndigital correlator. We demonstrate that intensity fluctuations between\northogonal polarizations, or at detector separations greater than the spatial\ncoherence length of the source, are uncorrelated but can be used to reduce\nsystematic noise. The work performed here can readily be applied to existing\nand future Imaging Air-Cherenkov Telescopes used as star light collectors for\nStellar Intensity Interferometry (SII) to measure spatial properties of\nastronomical objects.\n", "  We present a novel, continuous-feed nanocasting procedure for the synthesis\nof bismuth nanowire structures embedded in the pores of a mesoporous silica\ntemplate. The immobilization of a bismuth salt inside the silica template from\na diluted metal salt solution yields a sufficiently high loading to obtain\nelectrically conducting bulk nanowire composite samples after reduction and\nsintering the nanocomposite powders. Electrical resistivity measurements of\nsintered bismuth nanowires embedded in the silica template reveal\nsize-quantization effects.\n", "  Being able to quantify the corrosion of ferromagnetic water pipeline is a\ncritical task for avoiding pipe failures. This task is often performed with\nNon-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) technologies and solving the inverse modeling\nof the sensor is considered as the holy grail of most NDE studies. In this\npaper, we propose a method that partly solves the inverse problem for the\nRemote Field Eddy Current (RFEC) technology. We consider RFEC tools with two\ndifferent design, the first one is the classic design with a single exciter\ncoil and a single receiver coil, and the second design considers the\nreplacement of the receiver coil by an array of receivers distributed along the\ncircumference. The proposed algorithm is tested on both simulated and real\ndataset.\n"]}
