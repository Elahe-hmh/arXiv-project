moments in LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$ with the As\n$A_{1g}$ phonon is calculated. We present first principles calculations of the\natomic and electronic structure of LaFeAsO as a function of electron doping. We\nperform calculations using the virtual crystal approximation as well as\nsupercell calculations with F substitutional impurity atoms. The results\nvalidate the virtual crystal approximation for the electronic structure near\nthe Fermi level. Its is found that the electronic density of states at the\nFermi level is maximum for x=0.125, enhancing the electron-phonon interaction.\nAn additional increase of the electron-phonon parameter $\\lambda$ is obtained\nif the coupling between the $A_{1g}$ phonon and the Fe magnetic moment is\nincluded. It is found that the electron-phonon interaction can be one order of\nmagnitude larger than its value if no spin resolution is included in the\ncalculation. The implications of these results on the superconducting\ntransition are discussed\n", "  Methods of three-dimensional deconvolution with a point-spread function as\nfrequently employed in optical microscopy to reconstruct true three-dimensional\ndistribution of objects are extended to holographic reconstructions. Two such\nschemes have been developed and are discussed: an instant deconvolution using\nthe Wiener filter as well as an iterative deconvolution routine. The instant\n3d-deconvolution can be applied to restore the positions of volume-spread\nobjects such as small particles. The iterative deconvolution can be applied to\nrestore the distribution of complex and extended objects. Simulated and\nexperimental examples are presented and demonstrate artifact and noise free\nthree-dimensional reconstructions from a single two-dimensional holographic\nrecord. Keywords: digital holography, volumetric deconvolution,\nthree-dimensional volumetric deconvolution, particle tracking, holographic\nparticle tracking, resolution, PSF\n", "  Several possibilities exist to implement the propagation step of the lattice\nBoltzmann method. This paper describes common implementations which are\ncompared according to the number of memory transfer operations they require per\nlattice node update. A memory bandwidth based performance model is then used to\nobtain an estimation of the maximal reachable performance on different\nmachines. A subset of the discussed implementations of the propagation step\nwere benchmarked on different Intel and AMD-based compute nodes using the\nframework of an existing flow solver which is specially adapted to simulate\nflow in porous media. Finally the estimated performance is compared to the\nmeasured one. As expected, the number of memory transfers has a significant\nimpact on performance. Advanced approaches for the propagation step like \"AA\npattern\" or \"Esoteric Twist\" require more implementation effort but sustain\nsignificantly better performance than non-naive straight forward\nimplementations.\n", "  A Feynman formula is a representation of a solution of an initial (or\ninitial-boundary) value problem for an evolution equation (or, equivalently, a\nrepresentation of the semigroup resolving the problem) by a limit of $n$-fold\niterated integrals of some elementary functions as $n\\to\\infty$. In this note\nwe obtain some Feynman formulae for a class of semigroups associated with\nFeller processes. Finite dimensional integrals in the Feynman formulae give\napproximations for functional integrals in some Feynman--Kac formulae\ncorresponding to the underlying processes. Hence, these Feynman formulae give\nan effective tool to calculate functional integrals with respect to probability\nmeasures generated by these Feller processes and, in particular, to obtain\nsimulations of Feller processes.\n", "  In a multicellular organism different cell types express a gene in different\namounts. Samples from which gene expression levels can be measured typically\ncontain a mixture of different cell types, the resulting measurements thus give\nonly averages over the different cell types present. Based on fluctuations in\nthe mixture proportions from sample to sample it is in principle possible to\nreconstruct the underlying expression levels of each cell type: to deconvolute\nthe sample. We use a statistical mechanics approach to the problem of\ndeconvoluting such partial concentrations from mixed samples, give analytical\nresults for when and how well samples can be unmixed, and suggest an algorithm\nfor sample deconvolution.\n", "  Lepton flavor-violating processes offer interesting possibilities to probe\nnew physics at multi-TeV scale. We discuss those in the framework of effective\nfield theory, emphasizing the role of gluonic operators. Those operators are\nobtained by integrating out heavy quarks that are kinematically inaccessible at\nthe scale where low-energy experiments take place and make those experiments\nsensitive to the couplings of lepton flavor changing neutral currents to heavy\nquarks. We discuss constraints on the Wilson coefficients of those operators\nfrom the muon conversion $\\mu^- + (A,Z) \\to e^- + (A,Z)$ and from lepton\nflavor-violating tau decays with one or two hadrons in the final state, e.g.\n$\\tau \\to \\ell \\ \\eta^{(\\prime)}$ and $\\tau \\to \\ell \\ \\pi^+\\pi^-$ with $\\ell =\n\\mu, e$. To illustrate the results we discuss explicit examples of constraining\nparameters of leptoquark models.\n", "  Strong electron interactions in solids increase effective mass, and shrink\nthe electronic bands [1]. One of the most unique and robust experimental facts\nabout iron-based superconductors [2-4] is the renormalization of the conduction\nband by factor of 3 near the Fermi level [5-9]. Obviously related to\nsuperconductivity, this unusual behaviour remains unexplained. Here, by\nstudying the momentum-resolved spectrum of the whole valence band in a\nrepresentative material, we show that this phenomenon originates from\nelectronic interaction on a much larger energy scale. We observe an abrupt\ndepletion of the spectral weight in the middle of the Fe $3d$ band, which is\naccompanied by a drastic increase of the scattering rate. Remarkably, all\nspectral anomalies including the low-energy renormalization can be explained by\ncoupling to excitations, strongly peaked at about 0.5 eV. Such high-energy\ninteraction distinguishes all unconventional superconductors from common\nmetals.\n", "  In macroscopic systems behavior is usually reproducible and fluctuations,\nwhich are deviations from the typically observed mean values, are small. But\nalmost all inverse problems in the physical and biological sciences are\nill-posed and these fluctuations are highly 'amplified'. Using stochastic\nthermodynamics we describe a system in equilibrium kicked to a state far from\nequilibrium and the following dissipative process back to equilibrium. From the\nobserved value at a certain time after the kick the magnitude of the kick\nshould be estimated, which is such an ill-posed inverse problem and\nfluctuations get relevant. For the model system of a kicked Brownian particle\nthe time-dependent probability distribution, the information loss about the\nmagnitude of the kick described by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the\nentropy production derived from the observed mean values are given. The\nequality of information loss caused by fluctuations and mean entropy production\nis shown for general kicked dissipative processes from stochastic\nthermodynamics following the derivation of the Jarzynski and Crooks equalities.\nThe information-theoretical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence\n(Chernoff-Stein Lemma) allows us to describe the influence of the fluctuations\nwithout knowing their distributions just from the mean value equations and thus\nto derive very applicable results, e.g., by giving thermodynamic limits of\nspatial resolution for imaging.\n", "  We propose a reconfigurable bit comparator implemented with a nanowire spin\nvalve whose two contacts are magnetostrictive with bistable magnetization.\nReference and input bits are \"written\" into the magnetization states of the two\ncontacts with electrically generated strain and the spin-valve's resistance is\nlowered if they match. Multiple comparators can be interfaced in parallel with\na magneto-tunneling junction to determine if an N-bit input stream matches an\nN-bit reference stream bit by bit. The system is robust against thermal noise\nat room temperature and a 16-bit comparator can operate at roughly 416 MHz\nwhile dissipating at most 420 aJ per cycle.\n", "  The electronic band structure of twisted bilayer graphene develops van Hove\nsingularities whose energy depends on the twist angle between the two layers.\nUsing Raman spectroscopy, we monitor the evolution of the electronic band\nstructure upon doping using the G peak area which is enhanced when the laser\nphoton energy is resonant with the energy separation of the van Hove\nsingularities. Upon charge doping, the Raman G peak area initially increases\nfor twist angles larger than a critical angle and decreases for smaller angles.\nTo explain this behavior with twist angle, the energy of separation of the van\nHove singularities must decrease with increasing charge density demonstrating\nthe ability to modify the electronic and optical properties of twisted bilayer\ngraphene with doping.\n", "  We consider the nonlinear equation $-\\frac{1}{m}=z+Sm$ with a parameter $z$\nin the complex upper half plane $\\mathbb{H} $, where $S$ is a positivity\npreserving symmetric linear operator acting on bounded functions. The solution\nwith values in $ \\mathbb{H}$ is unique and its $z$-dependence is conveniently\ndescribed as the Stieltjes transforms of a family of measures $v$ on\n$\\mathbb{R}$. In~[AEK16b] we qualitatively identified the possible singular\nbehaviors of $v$: under suitable conditions on $S$ we showed that in the\ndensity of $v$ only algebraic singularities of degree two or three may occur.\nIn this paper we give a comprehensive analysis of these singularities with\nuniform quantitative controls. We also find a universal shape describing the\ntransition regime between the square root and cubic root singularities.\nFinally, motivated by random matrix applications in the companion paper~[AEKa],\nwe present a complete stability analysis of the equation for any $z\\in\n\\mathbb{H}$, including the vicinity of the singularities.\n", "  We address the issues related to the presence of the quantum potential term\nin a BEC on the observable Analogue Gravity systems. We show that the quantum\npotential term apparently gives rise to massive scalar excitations of length\nscales of the order $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\xi)$ in the lower dimensional space. Since,\nin 'analogue models', there is a window for experimental observations generally\nin (2 + 1) or even lower dimensional space, one has to take proper account of\nthe presence of these massive excitations to interpret the results.\n", "  The determination of the effective Coulomb interactions to be used in\nlow-energy Hamiltonians for materials with strong electronic correlations\nremains one of the bottlenecks for parameter-free electronic structure\ncalculations. We propose and benchmark a scheme for determining the effective\nlocal Coulomb interactions for charge-transfer oxides and related compounds.\nIntershell interactions between electrons in the correlated shell and ligand\norbitals are taken into account in an effective manner, leading to a reduction\nof the effective local interactions on the correlated shell. Our scheme\nresolves inconsistencies in the determination of effective interactions as\nobtained by standard methods for a wide range of materials, and allows for a\nconceptual understanding of the relation of cluster model and dynamical mean\nfield-based electronic structure calculations.\n", "  Projective measurement is used as a fundamental axiom in quantum mechanics,\neven though it is discontinuous and cannot predict which measured operator\neigenstate will be observed in which experimental run. The probabilistic Born\nrule gives it an ensemble interpretation, predicting proportions of various\noutcomes over many experimental runs. Understanding gradual weak measurements\nrequires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the\ncollapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs. We revisit the\nquantum trajectory framework that models quantum measurement as a continuous\nnonlinear stochastic process. We describe the ensemble of quantum trajectories\nas noise fluctuations on top of geodesics that attract the quantum state\ntowards the measured operator eigenstates. Investigation of the restrictions\nneeded on the ensemble of quantum trajectories, so as to reproduce projective\nmeasurement in the appropriate limit, shows that the Born rule follows when the\nmagnitudes of the noise and the attraction are precisely related, in a manner\nreminiscent of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. That implies that both the\nnoise and the attraction have a common origin in the measurement interaction\nbetween the system and the apparatus. We analyse the quantum trajectory\nensemble for the scenarios of quantum diffusion and binary quantum jump, and\nshow that the ensemble distribution is completely determined in terms of a\nsingle evolution parameter. This trajectory ensemble distribution can be tested\nin weak measurement experiments. We also comment on how the required noise may\narise in the measuring apparatus.\n", "  We observe spontaneous Hawking radiation, stimulated by quantum vacuum\nfluctuations, emanating from an analogue black hole in an atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. Correlations are observed between the Hawking particles outside the\nblack hole and the partner particles inside. These correlations indicate an\napproximately thermal distribution of Hawking radiation. We find that the high\nenergy pairs are entangled, while the low energy pairs are not, within the\nreasonable assumption that excitations with different frequencies are not\ncorrelated. The entanglement verifies the quantum nature of the Hawking\nradiation. The results are consistent with a driven oscillation experiment and\na numerical simulation.\n", "  Experimental measurements and calculations of STIRAP transfer efficiencies\nwere made on a sodium gas starting from the $3^2{\\rm S}_{1/2}$ electronic\nground state, passing through the $3^2{\\rm P}_{1/2}$ and/or the $3^2{\\rm\nP}_{3/2}$ to the $5^2{\\rm S}_{1/2}$ state. The lasers used in the experiments\nhad a pulse width of several picoseconds and were close to the Fourier\ntransform limit. Although the linewidth of the laser was much smaller than the\nspin orbit splitting between the $3^2{\\rm P}_{1/2}$ and $3^2{\\rm P}_{3/2}$\nstates, Experiments and calculations reveal that both 3p states play a role in\nthe transfer efficiency when the lasers are tuned to resonance through the\n$3^2{\\rm P}_{1/2}$ state, revealing evidence for quantum interference between\nthe competing pathways.\n", "  We propose a refined scheme of deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian\nfor materials with strong electronic Coulomb correlations beyond density\nfunctional theory (DFT). By tracing out the electronic states away from the\ntarget degrees of freedom in a controlled way by a perturbative scheme we\nconstruct an effective model for a restricted low-energy target space\nincorporating the effects of high-energy degrees of freedom in an effective\nmanner. The resulting effective model can afterwards be solved by accurate\nmany-body solvers. We improve this \"multi-scale ab initio scheme for correlated\nelectrons\" (MACE) primarily in two directions: (1) Double counting of\nelectronic correlations between the DFT and the low-energy solver is avoided by\nusing the constrained GW scheme. (2) The frequency dependence of the\ninteraction emerging from the partial trace summation is taken into account as\na renormalization to the low-energy dispersion. The scheme is successfully\ntested on the example of SrVO3. Our work opens unexplored ways to understanding\nthe electronic structure of strongly correlated systems beyond current DFT\nmethods.\n", "  We study how quantum systems that propagate in the spacetime of a rotating\nplanet are affected by the curved background. Spacetime curvature affects\nwavepackets of photons propagating from Earth to a satellite, and the changes\nin the wavepacket encode the parameters of the spacetime. This allows us to\nevaluate quantitatively how quantum communications are affected by the curved\nspacetime background of the Earth and to achieve precise measurements of\nEarth's Schwarzschild radius and equatorial angular velocity. We then provide a\ncomparison with the state of the art in parameter estimation obtained through\nclassical means. Satellite to satellite communications and future directions\nare also discussed.\n", "  Electric-field control of magnetization promises to substantially enhance the\nenergy efficiency of device applications ranging from data storage to\nsolid-state cooling. However, the intrinsic linear magnetoelectric effect is\ntypically small in bulk materials. In thin films electric-field tuning of\nspin-orbit interaction phenomena (e.g., magnetocrystalline anisotropy) has been\nreported to achieve a partial control of the magnetic state. Here we explore\nthe piezomagnetic effect (PME), driven by frustrated exchange interactions,\nwhich can induce a net magnetization in an antiferromagnet and reverse its\ndirection via elastic strain generated piezoelectrically. Our $ab~initio$ study\nof PME in Mn-antiperovskite nitrides identified an extraordinarily large PME in\nMn$_3$SnN available at room temperature. We explain the magnitude of PME based\non features of the electronic structure and show an inverse-proportionality\nbetween the simulated zero-temperature PME and the negative thermal expansion\nat the magnetic (N\\'eel) transition measured by Takenaka et al. in 9\nantiferromagnetic Mn$_3$AN systems.\n", "  Let $ S $ be a positivity preserving symmetric linear operator acting on\nbounded functions. The nonlinear equation $ -\\frac{1}{m}=z+Sm $ with a\nparameter $ z $ in the complex upper half-plane $ \\mathbb{H} $ has a unique\nsolution $ m $ with values in $ \\mathbb{H} $. We show that the $ z $-dependence\nof this solution can be represented as the Stieltjes transforms of a family of\nprobability measures $ v $ on $ \\mathbb{R} $. Under suitable conditions on $ S\n$, we show that $ v $ has a real analytic density apart from finitely many\nalgebraic singularities of degree at most three.\n  Our motivation comes from large random matrices. The solution $ m $\ndetermines the density of eigenvalues of two prominent matrix ensembles; (i)\nmatrices with centered independent entries whose variances are given by $ S $\nand (ii) matrices with correlated entries with a translation invariant\ncorrelation structure. Our analysis shows that the limiting eigenvalue density\nhas only square root singularities or a cubic root cusps; no other\nsingularities occur.\n", "  We present flexible photodetectors (PDs) for visible wavelengths fabricated\nby stacking centimetre-scale chemical vapour deposited (CVD) single layer\ngraphene (SLG) and single layer CVD MoS2, both wet transferred onto a flexible\npolyethylene terephthalate substrate. The operation mechanism relies on\ninjection of photoexcited electrons from MoS2 to the SLG channel. The external\nresponsivity is 45.5A/W and the internal 570A/W at 642nm. This is at least two\norders of magnitude higher than bulk-semiconductor flexible membranes and other\nflexible PDs based on graphene and layered materials. The photoconductive gain\nis up to 4x10^5. The photocurrent is in the 0.1-100 uA range. The devices are\nsemi-transparent, with just 8% absorption at 642nm and work stably upon bending\nto a curvature of 6cm. These capabilities and the low voltage operation (<1V)\nmake them attractive for wearable applications.\n", "  Quantum memories, capable of storing single photons or other quantum states\nof light, to be retrieved on-demand, offer a route to large-scale quantum\ninformation processing with light. A promising class of memories is based on\nfar-off-resonant Raman absorption in ensembles of $\\Lambda$-type atoms. However\nat room temperature these systems exhibit unwanted four-wave mixing, which is\nprohibitive for applications at the single-photon level. Here we show how this\nnoise can be suppressed by placing the storage medium inside a moderate-finesse\noptical cavity, thereby removing the main roadblock hindering this approach to\nquantum memory.\n", "  We recently derived a quantization condition for the energy of three\nrelativistic particles in a cubic box. Here we use this condition to study the\nenergy level closest to the three-particle threshold when the total\nthree-momentum vanishes. We expand this energy in powers of $1/L$, where $L$ is\nthe linear extent of the finite volume. The expansion begins at ${\\cal\nO}(1/L^3)$, and we determine the coefficients of the terms through ${\\cal\nO}(1/L^6)$. As is also the case for the two-particle threshold energy, the\n$1/L^3$, $1/L^4$ and $1/L^5$ coefficients depend only on the two-particle\nscattering length $a$. These can be compared to previous results obtained using\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics and we find complete agreement. The $1/L^6$\ncoefficients depend additionally on the two-particle effective range $r$ (just\nas in the two-particle case) and on a suitably defined threshold three-particle\nscattering amplitude (a new feature for three particles). A second new feature\nin the three-particle case is that logarithmic dependence on $L$ appears at\n$\\mathcal O(1/L^6)$. Relativistic effects enter at this order, and the only\ncomparison possible with the nonrelativistic result is for the coefficient of\nthe logarithm, where we again find agreement. For a more thorough check of the\n$1/L^6$ result, and thus of the quantization condition, we also compare to a\nperturbative calculation of the threshold energy in relativistic $\\lambda\n\\phi^4$ theory, which we have recently presented. Here all terms can be\ncompared and we find full agreement.\n", "  The structure of $d^*(2380)$ is re-studied with the single cluster structure\nin the chiral SU(3) quark model which has successfully been employed to explain\nthe scattering and binding behaviors of baryonic systems. The mass and width\nare explicitly calculated with two types of trial wave functions. The result\nshows that the $(0s)^6 [6]_{orb}$ configuration is easy to convert to the\nconfiguration with the same $[6]_{orb}$ symmetry but $2\\hbar \\omega$ excitation\nback and forth, however, it is seldom to turn into a two-cluster configuration\nwith a (1s) relative motion in between. The resultant mass and width are about\n$2394$MeV and $25$MeV, respectively, and the stable size is about $0.75fm$,\nwhich are consistent with both the results in the two-cluster configuration\ncalculation and the data measured by the COSY collaboration. It seems that the\nobserved $d^*$ is a six-quark dominated exotic state with a spherical shape and\nbreath mode in the coordinate space. Moreover, if $d^*$ does have $2\\hbar\n\\omega$ excitation, the $d^* \\to np\\pi\\pi\\pi$ decay mode might be a good place\nto distinguish the real structure of the observed phenomenon by COSY. The\nmasses of various isospin-spin states of six-light-quark systems are also\ncomputed. It is shown that by considering the coupling with the configurations\nwith $2\\hbar \\omega$ excitations, only the mirror state with $IS$=$30$ will be\nlower down to the place where whose mass is slightly higher than the value of\nthe $\\Delta\\Delta$ threshold.\n", "  Cosmic inflation, a period of accelerated expansion in the early universe,\ncan give rise to large amplitude ultra-large scale inhomogeneities on distance\nscales comparable to or larger than the observable universe. The cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) anisotropy on the largest angular scales is\nsensitive to such inhomogeneities and can be used to constrain the presence of\nultra-large scale structure (ULSS). We numerically evolve nonlinear\ninhomogeneities present at the beginning of inflation in full General\nRelativity to assess the CMB quadrupole constraint on the amplitude of the\ninitial fluctuations and the size of the observable universe relative to a\nlength scale characterizing the ULSS. To obtain a statistically significant\nnumber of simulations, we adopt a toy model in which inhomogeneities are\ninjected along a preferred direction. We compute the likelihood function for\nthe CMB quadrupole including both ULSS and the standard quantum fluctuations\nproduced during inflation. We compute the posterior given the observed CMB\nquadrupole, finding that when including gravitational nonlinearities, ULSS\ncurvature perturbations of order unity are allowed by the data, even on length\nscales not too much larger than the size of the observable universe. Our\nresults illustrate the utility and importance of numerical relativity for\nconstraining early universe cosmology.\n", "  We consider a vector-tensor gravitational model with terms quadratic in the\nMaxwell tensor derivatives, called the Bopp-Podolsky term. The gravitational\nfield equations of the model and the equations describing the evolution of the\nvector field are obtained and their Newtonian limit is investigated. The\ncosmological implications of a Bopp-Podolsky type dark energy term are\ninvestigated for a Bianchi type I homogeneous and anisotropic geometry for two\nmodels, corresponding to the absence and presence of the self-interacting\npotential of the field, respectively. The time evolutions of the Hubble\nfunction, of the matter energy density, of the shear scalar, of the mean\nanisotropy parameter, and of the deceleration parameter, respectively, as well\nas the field potentials are obtained for both cases by numerically integrating\nthe cosmological evolution equations. In the presence of the vector type dark\nenergy with quadratic terms in the Maxwell tensor derivatives, depending on the\nnumerical values of the model parameters, the Bianchi type I Universe\nexperiences a complex dynamical evolution, with the dust Universes ending in an\nisotropic phase. The presence of the self-interacting potential of the vector\nfield significantly shortens the time interval necessary for the full\nisotropization of the Universe.\n", "  Herschel has revolutionized our ability to measure column densities (N$_{\\rm\nH}$) and temperatures (T) of molecular clouds thanks to its far infrared\nmultiwavelength coverage. However, the lack of a well defined background\nintensity level in the Herschel data limits the accuracy of the N$_{\\rm H}$ and\nT maps. We provide a method that corrects the missing Herschel background\nintensity levels using the Planck model for foreground Galactic thermal dust\nemission. We present a Fourier method that combines the publicly available\nPlanck model on large angular scales with the Herschel images on smaller\nangular scales. We apply our method to two regions spanning a range of Galactic\nenvironments: Perseus and the Galactic plane region around $l = 11\\deg$\n(HiGal--11). We post-process the combined dust continuum emission images to\ngenerate column density and temperature maps. We compare these to previously\nadopted constant--offset corrections. We find significant differences\n($\\gtrsim$20\\%) over significant ($\\sim$15\\%) areas of the maps, at low column\ndensities ($N_{\\rm H}\\lesssim10^{22}$\\,cm$^{-2}$) and relatively high\ntemperatures ($T\\gtrsim20$\\,K). We also apply our method to synthetic\nobservations of a simulated molecular cloud to validate our method. Our method\nsuccessfully corrects the Herschel images, including both the constant--offset\nintensity level and the scale-dependent background variations measured by\nPlanck. Our method improves the previous constant--offset corrections, which\ndid not account for variations in the background emission levels.\n", "  Recent surveys have identified a seemingly ubiquitous population of galaxies\nwith elevated [OIII]/H$\\beta$ emission line ratios at $z > 1$, though the\nnature of this phenomenon continues to be debated. The [OIII]/H$\\beta$ line\nratio is of interest because it is a main component of the standard diagnostic\ntools used to differentiate between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nstar-forming galaxies, as well as the gas-phase metallicity indicators $O_{23}$\nand $R_{23}$. Here, we investigate the primary driver of increased\n[OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratios by median-stacking rest-frame optical spectra for a\nsample of star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey in the redshift range\n$z\\sim1.4-2.2$. Using $N = 4220$ star-forming galaxies, we stack the data in\nbins of mass and specific star formation rates (sSFR) respectively. After\naccounting for stellar Balmer absorption, we measure\n[OIII]$\\lambda5007$\\AA/H$\\beta$ down to $\\mathrm{M} \\sim 10^{9.2} \\\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and sSFR $\\sim 10^{-9.6} \\ \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, more than an\norder of magnitude lower than previous work at similar redshifts. We find an\noffset of $0.59\\pm0.05$ dex between the median ratios at $z\\sim2$ and $z\\sim0$\nat fixed stellar mass, in agreement with existing studies. However, with\nrespect to sSFR, the $z \\sim 2$ stacks all lie within 1$\\sigma$ of the median\nSDSS ratios, with an average offset of only $-0.06\\pm 0.05$. We find that the\nexcitation properties of galaxies are tightly correlated with their sSFR at\nboth $z\\sim2$ and $z\\sim0$, with a relation that appears to be roughly constant\nover the last 10 Gyr of cosmic time.\n", "  The {\\gamma}-ray data of Fermi-LAT on the giant lobes of Centaurus A are\nanalysed together with the high frequency radio data obtained with the Planck\nsatellite. The large {\\gamma}-ray photon statistics, accumulated during seven\nyears of observations, and the recently updated Fermi collaboration software\ntools allow substantial extension of the detected {\\gamma}-ray emission towards\nhigher energy, up to 30 GeV, and lower energy, down to 60 MeV. Moreover, the\nnew {\\gamma}-ray data allow us to explore the spatial features of {\\gamma}-ray\nemission of the lobes. For the north lobe, we confirm, with higher statistical\nsignificance, our earlier finding on the extension of {\\gamma}-ray emission\nbeyond the radio image. Moreover, the new analysis reveals significant spatial\nvariation of {\\gamma}-ray spectra from both lobes. On the other hand, the\nPlanck observations at microwave frequencies contain important information on\nspectra of synchrotron emission in the cutoff region, and thus allow\nmodel-independent derivation of the strength of the magnetic field and the\ndistribution of relativistic electrons based on the combined {\\gamma}-ray and\nradio data. The interpretation of multiwavelength spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of the lobes within a pure leptonic model requires strong enhancement of\nthe magnetic field at the edge of the south lobe. Alternatively, a more\ncomplex, leptonic-hadronic model of the {\\gamma}-ray emission, postulating a\nnon-negligible contribution of the {\\pi}^0 -decay component at highest\nenergies, can explain the {\\gamma}-ray data with a rather homogeneous\ndistribution of the magnetic field over the giant lobes.\n", "  We investigate the sliding of objects on an inclined granular surface close\nto the avalanche threshold. Our experiments show that the stability is driven\nby the surface deformations. Heavy objects generate footprint-like deformations\nwhich stabilize the objects on the slopes. Light objects do not disturb the\nsandy surfaces and are also stable. For intermediate weights, the deformations\nof the surface destabilize the objects and generate sliding. A characteristic\npressure for which the solid friction is minimal is evidenced. Applications to\nthe locomotion of devices and animals on sandy slopes as a function of their\nmass are proposed.\n", "  The regime of strong light-matter coupling is typically associated with weak\nexcitation. With current realizations of cavity-QED systems, strong coupling\nmay persevere even at elevated excitation levels sufficient to cross the\nthreshold to lasing. In the presence of stimulated emission, the vacuum-Rabi\ndoublet in the emission spectrum is modified and the established criterion for\nstrong coupling no longer applies. We provide a generalized criterion for\nstrong coupling and the corresponding emission spectrum, which includes the\ninfluence of higher Jaynes-Cummings states. The applicability is demonstrated\nin a theory-experiment comparison of a few-emitter quantum-dot--micropillar\nlaser as a particular realization of the driven dissipative Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel. Furthermore, we address the question if and for which parameters true\nsingle-emitter lasing can be achieved, and provide evidence for the coexistence\nof strong coupling and lasing in our system in the presence of background\nemitter contributions.\n", "  With the use of simulated supernova catalogs, we show that the statefinder\nparameters turn out to be poorly and biased estimated by standard cosmography.\nTo this end, we compute their standard deviations and several bias statistics\non cosmologies near the concordance model, demonstrating that these are very\nlarge, making standard cosmography unsuitable for future and wider compilations\nof data. To overcome this issue, we propose a new method that consists in\nintroducing the series of the Hubble function into the luminosity distance,\ninstead of considering the usual direct Taylor expansions of the luminosity\ndistance. Moreover, in order to speed up the numerical computations, we\nestimate the coefficients of our expansions in a hierarchical manner, in which\nthe order of the expansion depends on the redshift of every single piece of\ndata. In addition, we propose two hybrids methods that incorporates standard\ncosmography at low redshifts. The methods presented here perform better than\nthe standard approach of cosmography both in the errors and bias of the\nestimated statefinders. We further propose a one-parameter diagnostic to reject\nnon-viable methods in cosmography.\n", "  The Galactic Centre is a hotbed of astrophysical activity, with the injection\nof wind material from $\\sim$30 massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting within 12\narcsec of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) playing an important role.\nHydrodynamic simulations of such colliding and accreting winds produce a\ncomplex density and temperature structure of cold wind material shocking with\nthe ambient medium, creating a large reservoir of hot, X-ray-emitting gas. This\nwork aims to confront the 3 Ms of Chandra X-ray Visionary Program observations\nof this diffuse emission by computing the X-ray emission from these\nhydrodynamic simulations of the colliding WR winds, amid exploring a variety of\nSMBH feedback mechanisms. The major success of the model is that it reproduces\nthe spectral shape from the 2-5 arcsec ring around the SMBH, where most of the\nstellar wind material that is ultimately captured by Sgr A* is shock-heated and\nthermalised. This naturally explains that the hot gas comes from colliding WR\nwinds, and that the wind speeds of these stars are, in general, well\nconstrained. The flux level of these spectra, as well as 12 $\\times$\n12-arcsec$^2$ images of 4-9 keV, shows that the X-ray flux is tied to the SMBH\nfeedback strength; stronger feedback clears out more hot gas, thereby\ndecreasing the thermal X-ray emission. The model in which Sgr A* produced an\nintermediate-strength outflow during the last few centuries best matches the\nobservations to within about 10 per cent, showing that SMBH feedback is\nrequired to interpret the X-ray emission in this region.\n", "  In this work, we investigated the electroweak vacuum instability during or\nafter inflation. In the inflationary Universe, i.e., de Sitter space, the\nvacuum field fluctuations $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>$ enlarge in\nproportion to the Hubble scale $H^{2}$. Therefore, the large inflationary\nvacuum fluctuations of the Higgs field $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>$\nare potentially catastrophic to trigger the vacuum transition to the\nnegative-energy Planck-scale vacuum state and cause an immediate collapse of\nthe Universe. However, the vacuum field fluctuations $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2\n} \\right>$, i.e., the vacuum expectation values have an ultraviolet divergence,\nand therefore a renormalization is necessary to estimate the physical effects\nof the vacuum transition. Thus, in this paper, we revisit the electroweak\nvacuum instability from the perspective of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\nspace-time, and discuss the dynamical behavior of the homogeneous Higgs field\n$\\phi$ determined by the effective potential ${ V }_{\\rm eff}\\left( \\phi\n\\right)$ in curved space-time and the renormalized vacuum fluctuations $\\left<\n{\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>_{\\rm ren}$ via adiabatic regularization and\npoint-splitting regularization. We simply suppose that the Higgs field only\ncouples the gravity via the non-minimal Higgs-gravity coupling $\\xi(\\mu)$. In\nthis scenario, the electroweak vacuum stability is inevitably threatened by the\ndynamical behavior of the homogeneous Higgs field $\\phi$, or the formations of\nAdS domains or bubbles unless the Hubble scale is small enough $H< \\Lambda_{I}\n$.\n", "  The quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit for the\nmeasurement of classical signals with detectors operating in the quantum\nregime. Using linear-response theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty relation,\nwe derive a general condition for achieving such a fundamental limit. When\napplied to classical displacement measurements with a test mass, this condition\nleads to an explicit connection between the QCRB and the Standard Quantum Limit\nwhich arises from a tradeoff between the measurement imprecision and quantum\nbackaction; the QCRB can be viewed as an outcome of a quantum non-demolition\nmeasurement with the backaction evaded. Additionally, we show that the test\nmass is more a resource for improving measurement sensitivity than a victim of\nthe quantum backaction, which suggests a new approach to enhancing the\nsensitivity of a broad class of sensors. We illustrate these points with laser\ninterferometric gravitational wave detectors.\n", "  We report on a class of quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) in\nstrained-layer InAs/GaInSb quantum wells, in which the bulk gaps are enhanced\nby up to five folds as compared to the binary InAs/GaSb QSHI. Remarkably, with\nconsequently increasing edge velocity, the edge conductance at zero and applied\nmagnetic fields manifests time reversal symmetry (TRS) -protected properties\nconsistent with Z2 topological insulator. The InAs/GaInSb bilayers offer a much\nsought-after platform for future studies and applications of the QSHI.\n", "  Studies of strong field ionization have historically relied on the strong\nfield approximation, which neglects all spatial dependence in the forces\nexperienced by the electron after ionization. More recently, the small spatial\ninhomogeneity introduced by the long-range Coulomb potential has been linked to\na number of important features in the photoelectron spectrum, such as Coulomb\nasymmetry, Coulomb focusing, and the low energy structure (LES). Here, we\ndemonstrate by combined quantum and classical simulations that a small\ntime-varying spatial dependence in the laser electric field creates a prominent\nhigher energy peak at energies above the \"classical cut-off\" for direct\nelectrons. This higher energy structure (HES) originates from direct electrons\nionized near the peak of a single half-cycle of the laser pulse. The HES is\nseparated from all other ionization events (providing sub-cycle resolution) and\nis highly sensitive to the carrier envelope phase (CEP). The large accumulation\nof electrons with tuneable energy suggests a promising method for creating a\nlocalized source of electron pulses of attosecond duration using tabletop laser\ntechnology.\n", "  We consider the AdS/dS CFT correspondence and study the nature of the thermal\nbath of the de Sitter field theory using holography. Unlike the temperature of\na thermal field theory in flat spacetime, the temperature of a superconformal\nfield theory on de Sitter space is an integral part of the theory and leaves\nintact the conformal symmetry and supersymmetry. In the dual AdS side, there is\nno black hole. Instead we have cosmological expansion of the de Sitter factor.\nWe consider a number of different observables, such as the entanglement\nentropy, two point correlation function, Wilson loops corresponding to static\nand spinning mesons in the field theory, and study their thermal properties\nusing holography. The former two quantities have trivial temperature dependence\ndue to conformal symmetry. We compute the energy of the quark anti-quark bound\nstate for a static meson, as well as the energy and the angular momentum for a\nspinning meson. We find that there is a maximum distance, as well as a maximum\nspin for the latter case, beyond which the bound state become unstable. The\ntemperature behavior of the physical quantities in these meson systems are\nsimilar to that of the usual thermal field theory with holographic black hole\ndual. With these examples, we show clearly how the field theory observables get\ntheir thermal properties from the bulk despite the absence of a black hole,\nwith the role of the black hole horizon played by the cosmological expansion of\nthe de Sitter factor of the AdS metric.\n", "  We present measurements of the spatial mapping between (hot) baryons and the\ntotal matter in the Universe, via the cross-correlation between the thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) map from Planck and the weak gravitational lensing maps\nfrom the Red Sequence Cluster Survey (RCSLenS). The cross-correlations are\nperformed on the map level where all the sources (including diffuse\nintergalactic gas) contribute to the signal. We consider two\nconfiguration-space correlation function estimators, $\\xi^{ y-\\kappa}$ and\n$\\xi^ {y-\\gamma_{t}}$, and a Fourier space estimator, $C_{\\ell}^{y-\\kappa}$, in\nour analysis. We detect a significant correlation out to three degrees of\nangular separation on the sky. Based on statistical noise only, we can report\n13$\\sigma$ and 17$\\sigma$ detections of the cross-correlation using the\nconfiguration-space $y-\\kappa$ and $y-\\gamma_{t}$ estimators, respectively.\nIncluding a heuristic estimate of the sampling variance yields a detection\nsignificance of 6$\\sigma$ and 8$\\sigma$, respectively. A similar level of\ndetection is obtained from the Fourier-space estimator, $C_{\\ell}^{y-\\kappa}$.\nAs each estimator probes different dynamical ranges, their combination improves\nthe significance of the detection. We compare our measurements with predictions\nfrom the cosmo-OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where\ndifferent galactic feedback models are implemented. We find that a model with\nconsiderable AGN feedback that removes large quantities of hot gas from galaxy\ngroups and WMAP-7yr best-fit cosmological parameters provides the best match to\nthe measurements. All baryonic models in the context of a Planck cosmology\nover-predict the observed signal. Similar cosmological conclusions are drawn\nwhen we employ a halo model with the observed `universal' pressure profile.\n", "  The current-carrying steady-state that arises in the middle of a metallic\nwire connected to macroscopic leads is characterized regarding its response\nfunctions, correlations and entanglement entropy. The spectral function and the\ndynamical structure factor show clear non-equilibrium signatures accessible by\nstate-of-the-art techniques. In contrast with the equilibrium case, the\nentanglement entropy is extensive with logarithmic corrections at\nzero-temperature that depend on the wire-leads coupling and, in a non-analytic\nway, on voltage. This shows that some robust universal quantities found in\ngapless equilibrium phases do not persist away from equilibrium.\n", "  Blazars are high-energy engines providing us natural laboratories to study\nparticle acceleration, relativistic plasma processes, magnetic field dynamics,\nblack hole physics. Key informations are provided by observations at\nhigh-energy (in particular by Fermi/LAT) and very-high energy (by Cherenkov\ntelescopes). I give a short account of the current status of the field, with\nparticular emphasis on the theoretical challenges connected to the observed\nultra-fast variability events and to the emission of flat spectrum radio\nquasars in the very high energy band.\n", "  Achieving effectively adiabatic dynamics is a ubiquitous goal in almost all\nareas of quantum physics. Here, we study the speed with which a quantum system\ncan be driven when employing transitionless quantum driving. As a main result,\nwe establish a rigorous link between this speed, the quantum speed limit, and\nthe (energetic) cost of implementing such a shortcut to adiabaticity.\nInterestingly, this link elucidates a trade-off between speed and cost, namely\nthat instantaneous manipulation is impossible as it requires an infinite cost.\nThese findings are illustrated for two experimentally relevant systems - the\nparametric oscillator and the Landau-Zener model - which reveal that the\nspectral gap governs the quantum speed limit as well as the cost for realizing\nthe shortcut.\n", "  In February 2014, the SHARK-VIS (System for High contrast And coronography\nfrom R to K at VISual bands) Forerunner, a high contrast experimental imager\noperating at visible wavelengths, was installed at LBT (Large Binocular\nTelescope). Here we report on the first results obtained by recent on-sky\ntests. These results show the extremely good performance of the LBT ExAO\n(Extreme Adaptive Optics) system at visible wavelengths, both in terms of\nspatial resolution and contrast achieved. Similarly to what was done by (Amara\net al. 2012), we used the SHARK-VIS Forerunner data to quantitatively assess\nthe contrast enhancement. This is done by injecting several different synthetic\nfaint objects in the acquired data and applying the ADI (angular differential\nimaging) technique. A contrast of the order of $5 \\times 10^{-5}$ is obtained\nat 630 nm for angular separations from the star larger than 100 mas. These\nresults are discussed in light of the future development of SHARK-VIS and\ncompared to those obtained by other high contrast imagers operating at similar\nwavelengths.\n", "  The spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Universe contains a\nwealth of cosmological information. The 21 cm emission line can be used to map\nthe HI up to very high redshift and therefore reveal us something about the\nevolution of the large scale structures in the Universe. However little is\nknown about the abundance and clustering properties of the HI over cosmic time.\nMotivated by this, we build an analytic framework where the relevant parameters\nthat govern how the HI is distributed among dark matter halos can be fixed\nusing observations. At the same time we provide tools to study the column\ndensity distribution function of the HI absorbers together with their\nclustering properties. Our formalism is the first one able to account for all\nobservations at a single redshift, $z = 2.3$. The linear bias of the HI and the\nmean number density of HI sources, two main ingredients in the calculation of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of a cosmological survey, are then discussed in\ndetail, also extrapolating the results to low and high redshift. We find that\nHI bias is relatively higher than the value reported in similar studies, but\nthe shot noise level is always sub dominant, making the HI Power Spectrum\nalways a high signal-to-noise measurements up to $z\\simeq5$ in the limit of no\ninstrumental noise and foreground contamination.\n", "  Reichenbach's principle asserts that if two observed variables are found to\nbe correlated, then there should be a causal explanation of these correlations.\nFurthermore, if the explanation is in terms of a common cause, then the\nconditional probability distribution over the variables given the complete\ncommon cause should factorize. The principle is generalized by the formalism of\ncausal models, in which the causal relationships among variables constrain the\nform of their joint probability distribution. In the quantum case, however, the\nobserved correlations in Bell experiments cannot be explained in the manner\nReichenbach's principle would seem to demand. Motivated by this, we introduce a\nquantum counterpart to the principle. We demonstrate that under the assumption\nthat quantum dynamics is fundamentally unitary, if a quantum channel with input\nA and outputs B and C is compatible with A being a complete common cause of B\nand C, then it must factorize in a particular way. Finally, we show how to\ngeneralize our quantum version of Reichenbach's principle to a formalism for\nquantum causal models, and provide examples of how the formalism works.\n", "  Many physical systems are composed of polyhedral cells of varying sizes and\nshapes. These structures are simple in the sense that no more than three faces\nmeet at an edge and no more than four edges meet at a vertex. This means that\nindividual cells can usually be considered as simple, three-dimensional\npolyhedra. This paper is concerned with determining the distribution of\ncombinatorial types of such polyhedral cells. We introduce the terms\n\\emph{fundamental} and \\emph{vertex-truncated} types and apply these concepts\nto the grain growth microstructure as a testing ground. For these\nmicrostructures we demonstrate that most grains are of particular fundamental\ntypes, whereas the frequency of vertex-truncated types decreases exponentially\nwith the number of truncations. This can be explained by the evolutionary\nprocess through which grain growth structures are formed, and in which\nenergetically unfavorable surfaces are quickly eliminated. Furthermore, we\nobserve that these grain types are `round' in a combinatorial sense: there are\nno `short' separating cycles that partition the polyhedra into two parts of\nsimilar sizes. A particular microstructure derived from the Poisson--Voronoi\ninitial condition is identified as containing an unusually large proportion of\nround grains. This Round microstructure has an average of $14.036$ faces per\ngrain, and is conjectured to be more resistant to topological change than the\nsteady-state grain growth microstructure.\n", "  Blazar emission models are usually divided into two big families, leptonic\nand hadronic, according to the particles which are responsible for the\ngamma-ray component of their spectral energy distributions. Even though\nleptonic models have been successful in explaining the gamma-ray emission from\nmost blazars, hadronic models still present an intriguing alternative. They\nhave the unique advantage to link the emission of photons, neutrinos, and\ncosmic rays from the astrophysical source. We have developed a stationary\none-zone lepto-hadronic code to model the emission from blazars in both\nleptonic and hadronic scenarios. In this contribution we focus on hadronic\nmodeling of a few selected TeV blazars of the BL Lac type and the radio galaxy\nCentaurus A detected by Cherenkov telescopes. We study in particular their\nassociated neutrino emission, for different hadronic scenarios, and how it\ncompares to the sensitivity of current neutrino detectors.\n", "  Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount\nfor discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data.\nDepending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be\nclassified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and\nsometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity\nand magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on\nwhat one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts\nfor may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric\nrepresentation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these\npermutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical\nimplementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the\nsensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions.\nThis paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic\nsimulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We\ntake an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the\nnecessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical\nproperties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the\nresulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the\nelectromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part\nof the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SimPEG\n(http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through\ntwo synthetic examples and one field example.\n", "  Interstellar medium clouds in the W28 region are emitting gamma-rays and it\nis likely that the W28 supernova remnant is responsible, making W28 a prime\ncandidate for the study of cosmic-ray acceleration and diffusion. Understanding\nthe influence of both supernova remnant shocks and cosmic rays on local\nmolecular clouds can help to identify multi-wavelength signatures of probable\ncosmic-ray sources. To this goal, transitions of OH, SiO, NH3, HCO+ and CS have\ncomplemented CO in allowing a characterization of the chemically rich\nenvironment surrounding W28. This remnant has been an ideal test-bed for\ntechniques that will complement arcminute-scale studies of cosmic-ray source\ncandidates with future GeV-PeV gamma-ray observations.\n", "  We present calculations of the wide angle emission of short-duration\ngamma-ray bursts from compact binary merger progenitors. Such events are\nexpected to be localized by their gravitational wave emission, fairly\nirrespective of the orientation of the angular momentum vector of the system,\nalong which the gamma-ray burst outflow is expected to propagate. We show that\nboth the prompt and afterglow emission are dim and challenging to detect for\nobservers lying outside of the cone within which the relativistic outflow is\npropagating. If the jet initially propagates through a baryon contaminated\nregion surrounding the merger site, however, a hot cocoon forms around it. The\ncocoon subsequently expands quasi-isotropically producing its own prompt\nemission and external shock powered afterglow. We show that the cocoon prompt\nemission is detectable by Swift BAT and Fermi GBM, We also show that the cocoon\nafterglow peaks a few hours to a few days after the burst and is detectable for\nup to a few weeks at all wavelengths. The timing and brightness of the\ntransient are however uncertain due to their dependence on unknown quantities\nsuch as the density of the ambient medium surrounding the merger site, the\ncocoon energy, and the cocoon Lorentz factor. For a significant fraction of the\ngravitationally-detected neutron-star-binary mergers, the cocoon afterglow\ncould possibly be the only identifiable electromagnetic counterpart, at least\nat radio and X-ray frequencies.\n", "  The development and construction of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) opens\nup new opportunities for the study of very high energy (VHE, E>100 GeV)\nsources. As a part of CTA, the ASTRI project, led by INAF, has one of the main\ngoals to develop one of the mini-arrays of CTA pre-production telescopes,\nproposed to be installed at the CTA southern site. Thanks to the innovative\ndual-mirror optical design of its small-sized telescopes, the ASTRI mini-array\nwill be characterized by a large field of view, an excellent angular\nresolutioerrorn and a good sensitivity up to energies of several tens of TeV.\nPulsar wind nebulae, along with Supernova Remnants, are among the most abundant\nsources that will be identified and investigated, with the ultimate goal to\nmove significantly closer to an understanding of the origin of cosmic rays\n(CR). As part of the ongoing effort to investigate the scientific capabilities\nfor both CTA as a whole and the ASTRI mini-array, we performed simulations of\nthe Vela X region. We simulated its extended VHE gamma-ray emission using the\nresults of the detailed H.E.S.S. analysis of this source. We estimated the\nresolving capabilities of the diffuse emission and the detection significance\nof the pulsar with both CTA as a whole and the ASTRI mini-array. Moreover with\nthese instruments it will be possible to observe the high-energy end of SNRs\nspectrum, searching for particles with energies near the cosmic-rays \"knee\"\n(E~10^15 eV). We simulated a set of ASTRI mini-array observations for one young\nand an evolved SNRs in order to test the capabilities of this instrument to\ndiscover and study PeVatrons on the Galactic plane.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the future observatory for TeV\ngamma-ray astronomy. In order to increase the sensitivity and to extend the\nenergy coverage beyond the capabilities of current facilities, its design\nconcept features telescopes of three different size classes. Based on the\nexperience from H.E.S.S. phase II, the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics\nT\\\"ubingen (IAAT) develops actuators for the mirror control system of the CTA\nMedium Size Telescopes (MSTs). The goals of this effort are durability, high\nprecision, and mechanical stability under all environmental conditions. Up to\nnow, several revisions were developed and the corresponding prototypes were\nextensively tested. In this contribution our latest design revision proposed\nfor the CTA MSTs are presented.\n", "  The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is a candidate for the Small Size\nTelescopes (SSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Its purpose is to\nextend the sensitivity of CTA to gamma-ray energies reaching 300 TeV. Its\ndual-mirror optical design and curved focal plane enables the use of a compact\ncamera of 0.4 m diameter, while achieving a field of view of above 8 degrees.\nThrough the use of the digitising TARGET ASICs, the Cherenkov flash is sampled\nonce per nanosecond continuously and then digitised when triggering conditions\nare met within the analogue outputs of the photosensors. Entire waveforms\n(typically covering 96 ns) for all 2048 pixels are then stored for analysis,\nallowing for a broad spectrum of investigations to be performed on the data.\nTwo prototypes of the GCT camera are under development, with differing\nphotosensors: Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMs) and Silicon Photomultipliers\n(SiPMs). During November 2015, the GCT MAPM (GCT-M) prototype camera was\nintegrated onto the GCT structure at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon, where it\nobserved the first Cherenkov light detected by a prototype instrument for CTA.\n", "  We present a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) providing a\nconsistent picture of particle physics from the electroweak scale to the Planck\nscale and of cosmology from inflation until today. Three right-handed neutrinos\n$N_i$, a new color triplet $Q$ and a complex SM-singlet scalar $\\sigma$, whose\nvacuum expectation value $v_\\sigma \\sim 10^{11}$ GeV breaks lepton number and a\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry simultaneously, are added to the SM. At low energies, the\nmodel reduces to the SM, augmented by seesaw generated neutrino masses and\nmixing, plus the axion. The latter solves the strong CP problem and accounts\nfor the cold dark matter in the Universe. The inflaton is comprised by a\nmixture of $\\sigma$ and the SM Higgs, and reheating of the Universe after\ninflation proceeds via the Higgs portal. Baryogenesis occurs via thermal\nleptogenesis. Thus, five fundamental problems of particle physics and cosmology\nare solved at one stroke in this unified Standard Model - Axion - seesaw -\nHiggs portal inflation (SMASH) model. It can be probed decisively by upcoming\ncosmic microwave background and axion dark matter experiments.\n", "  The Small Size Telescope with Single Mirror (SST-1M) is one of the proposed\ntypes of Small Size Telescopes (SST) for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).\nAbout 70 SST telescopes will be part the CTA southern array which will also\ninclude Medium Sized Telescopes (MST) in its threshold configuration. Optimized\nfor the detection of gamma rays in the energy range from 5 TeV to 300 TeV, the\nSST-1M uses a Davies-Cotton optics with a 4 m dish diameter with a field of\nview of 9 degrees. The Cherenkov light resulting from the interaction of the\ngamma-rays in the atmosphere is focused onto a 88 cm side-to-side hexagonal\nphoto-detection plane. The latter is composed of 1296 hollow light guides\ncoupled to large area hexagonal silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). The SiPM\nreadout is fully digital readout as for the trigger system. The compact and\nlightweight design of the SST-1M camera offers very high performance ideal for\ngamma-ray observation requirement. In this contribution, the concept, design,\nperformance and status of the first telescope prototype are presented.\n", "  In gamma-ray astronomy, a variety of data formats and proprietary software\nhave been traditionally used, often developed for one specific mission or\nexperiment. Especially for ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes (IACTs), data and software are mostly private to the collaborations\noperating the telescopes. However, there is a general movement in science\ntowards the use of open data and software. In addition, the next-generation\nIACT instrument, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), will be operated as an\nopen observatory.\n  We have created a Github organisation at\nhttps://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro where we are developing high-level data\nformat specifications. A public mailing list was set up at\nhttps://lists.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/open-gamma-ray-astro and a first\nface-to-face meeting on the IACT high-level data model and formats took place\nin April 2016 in Meudon (France). This open multi-mission effort will help to\naccelerate the development of open data formats and open-source software for\ngamma-ray astronomy, leading to synergies in the development of analysis codes\nand eventually better scientific results (reproducible, multi-mission).\n  This write-up presents this effort for the first time, explaining the\nmotivation and context, the available resources and process we use, as well as\nthe status and planned next steps for the data format specifications. We hope\nthat it will stimulate feedback and future contributions from the gamma-ray\nastronomy community.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the future instrument in ground-based\ngamma-ray astronomy in the energy range from 20 GeV to 300 TeV. Its sensitivity\nwill surpass that of current generation experiments by a factor $\\sim$10,\nfacilitated by telescopes of three sizes. The performance in the core energy\nregime will be dominated by Medium Size Telescopes (MST) with a reflector of 12\nm diameter. A full-size mechanical prototype of the telescope structure has\nbeen constructed in Berlin. The performance of the prototype is being evaluated\nand optimisations, among others, facilitating the assembly procedure and mass\nproduction possibilities are being implemented. We present the current status\nof the developments from prototyping towards pre-production telescopes, which\nwill be deployed at the final site.\n", "  The direct measurement of topological invariants in both engineered and\nnaturally occurring quantum materials is a key step in classifying quantum\nphases of matter. Here we motivate a toolbox based on time-dependent quantum\nwalks as a method to digitally simulate single-particle topological band\nstructures. Using a superconducting qubit dispersively coupled to a microwave\ncavity, we implement two classes of split-step quantum walks and directly\nmeasure the topological invariant (winding number) associated with each. The\nmeasurement relies upon interference between two components of a cavity\nSchr\\\"odinger cat state and highlights a novel refocusing technique which\nallows for the direct implementation of a digital version of Bloch\noscillations. Our scheme can readily be extended to higher dimensions, whereby\nquantum walk-based simulations can probe topological phases ranging from the\nquantum spin Hall effect to the Hopf insulator.\n", "  Transient collimated plasma eruptions in the solar corona, commonly known as\ncoronal (or X-ray) jets, are among the most interesting manifestations of solar\nactivity. It has been suggested that these events contribute to the mass and\nenergy content of the corona and solar wind, but the extent of these\ncontributions remains uncertain. We have recently modeled the formation and\nevolution of coronal jets using a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) code with thermodynamics in a large spherical domain that includes the\nsolar wind. Our model is coupled to 3D MHD flux-emergence simulations, i.e, we\nuse boundary conditions provided by such simulations to drive a time-dependent\ncoronal evolution. The model includes parametric coronal heating, radiative\nlosses, and thermal conduction, which enables us to simulate the dynamics and\nplasma properties of coronal jets in a more realistic manner than done so far.\nHere we employ these simulations to calculate the amount of mass and energy\ntransported by coronal jets into the outer corona and inner heliosphere. Based\non observed jet-occurrence rates, we then estimate the total contribution of\ncoronal jets to the mass and energy content of the solar wind to (0.4-3.0) %\nand (0.3-1.0) %, respectively. Our results are largely consistent with the few\nprevious rough estimates obtained from observations, supporting the conjecture\nthat coronal jets provide only a small amount of mass and energy to the solar\nwind. We emphasize, however, that more advanced observations and simulations\nare needed to substantiate this conjecture.\n", "  In this contribution, CTAs potential role in detection of particle dark\nmatter in the context of other detection approaches is briefly discussed for an\naudience of gamma-ray astronomers. In particular searches for new particles at\nthe large hadron collider and detection of dark matter particles in deep\nunderground detectors are considered. We will focus on Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particles (WIMP). Approaches will be compared in terms of (a)\nrobustness of sensitivity predictions, (b) timeline and (c) reach. The estimate\nof the reach will be model-dependent. Given our ignorance about the nature of\ndark matter, and the complementarity of detection techniques even within a\ngiven framework (e.g. Supersymmetry), the trivial conclusion is that we might\nneed all approaches and the most sensitive experiments. Our discussion will be\nsomewhat more restrictive in order to be able to be more concrete. With the\ncaveat of incompleteness, under the assumption that the WIMP paradigm describes\nnature, CTA is more likely to discover multi-TeV WIMP dark matter, whereas for\nlower masses direct detection and LHC has significantly better prospects. We\nwill illustrate this conclusion with examples from foremost Supersymmetry, but\nmention effective field theory or simplified models. We will comment on a few\nmodels predicting high mass WIMPs, in particular 1 TeV higgsino and wino WIMPs,\nas well as Minimal Dark Matter and point out the relevance of updated\nmeasurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon for CTAs role in\nsearches for Supersymmetry.\n", "  The next generation instrument for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy will be\nthe Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), consisting of approximately 100 telescopes\nin three sizes, built on two sites with one each in the Northern and Southern\nHemi- spheres. Up to 40 of these will be Medium Size Telescopes (MSTs) which\nwill dominate sensitivity in the core energy range. Since 2012, a full size\nmechanical prototype for the modified 12 m Davies-Cotton design MST has been in\noperation in Berlin. This doc- ument describes the techniques which have been\nimplemented to calibrate and optimise the mechanical and optical performance of\nthe prototype, and gives the results of over three years of observations and\nmeasurements. Pointing calibration techniques will be discussed, along with the\ndevelopment of a bending model, and calibration of the CCD cameras used for\npointing measurements. Additionally alignment of mirror segments using the\nBokeh method is shown.\n", "  Surprisingly, the chronology of nearly 50 years of the pulsar magnetosphere\nand pulsar wind research is quite similar to the history of our civilization.\nUsing this analogy, I have tried to outline the main results obtained in this\nfield. In addition to my talk, the possibility of particle acceleration due to\ndifferent processes in the pulsar magnetosphere is discussed in more detail.\n", "  We initiate the study of intersecting surface operators/defects in\nfour-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). We characterize these defects\nby coupled 4d/2d/0d theories constructed by coupling the degrees of freedom\nlocalized at a point and on intersecting surfaces in spacetime to each other\nand to the four-dimensional QFT. We construct supersymmetric intersecting\nsurface defects preserving just two supercharges in N = 2 gauge theories. These\ndefects are amenable to exact analysis by localization of the partition\nfunction of the underlying 4d/2d/0d QFT. We identify the 4d/2d/0d QFTs that\ndescribe intersecting surface operators in N = 2 gauge theories realized by\nintersecting M2-branes ending on N M5-branes wrapping a Riemann surface. We\nconjecture and provide evidence for an explicit equivalence between the\nsquashed four-sphere partition function of these intersecting defects and\ncorrelation functions in Liouville/Toda CFT with the insertion of arbitrary\ndegenerate vertex operators, which are labeled by two highest weights of SU(N).\n", "  The gamma-ray binary HESSJ0632+057 (VERJ0633+057) has been observed at\nvery-high energies for a decade by all major systems of imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes. We present here new observations taken by the VERITAS\nobservatory during the season 2015-2016. The observations cover now all phases\nof the binary orbit (with its period of about 315 days), showing clearly\nenhancements around phases 0.35 and 0.75. The results are discussed along with\nsimultaneous observations with Swift's X-Ray Telescope.\n", "  Low thermal polarization of nuclear spins is a primary sensitivity limitation\nfor nuclear magnetic resonance. Here we demonstrate optically pumped\n(microwave-free) nuclear spin polarization of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and\n$^{15}\\mathrm{N}$ in $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$-doped diamond. $^{15}\\mathrm{N}$\npolarization enhancements up to $-2000$ above thermal equilibrium are observed\nin the paramagnetic system $\\mathrm{N_s}^{0}$. Nuclear spin polarization is\nshown to diffuse to bulk $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ with NMR enhancements of $-200$ at\nroom temperature and $-500$ at $\\mathrm{240~K}$, enabling a route to\nmicrowave-free high-sensitivity NMR study of biological samples in ambient\nconditions.\n", "  The VERITAS array of four 12-m imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes began\nfull-scale operations in 2007, and is one of the world's most sensitive\ndetectors of astrophysical very high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma rays.\nObservations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are a major focus of the VERITAS\nCollaboration, and more than 60 AGN, primarily blazars, are known to emit VHE\nphotons. Approximately 4000 hours have been devoted to the VERITAS AGN\nobservation program, resulting in 34 detections. Most of these detections are\naccompanied by contemporaneous, broadband observations, enabling a more\ndetailed study of the underlying jet-powered processes. Recent highlights of\nthe VERITAS AGN observation program are presented.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the planned next-generation instrument\nfor ground-based gamma-ray astronomy, currently under preparation by a\nworld-wide consortium. The FlashCam group is preparing a photomultiplier-based\ncamera for the Medium Size Telescopes of CTA, with a fully digital Readout\nSystem (ROS). For the forthcoming mass production of a substantial number of\ncameras, efficient test routines for all components are currently under\ndevelopment. We report here on a test facility for the ROS components. A test\nsetup and routines have been developed and an early version of that setup has\nsuccessfully been used to test a significant fraction of the ROS for the\nFlashCam camera prototype in January 2016. The test setup with its components\nand interface, as well as first results, are presented here.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory will be deployed over two\nsites in the two hemispheres. Both sites will be equipped with four Large Size\nTelescopes (LSTs), which are crucial to achieve the science goals of CTA in the\n20-200 GeV energy range. Each LST is equipped with a primary tessellated mirror\ndish of 23 m diameter, supported by a structure made mainly of carbon fibre\nreinforced plastic tubes and aluminum joints. This solution guarantees light\nweight (around 100 tons), essential for fast repositioning to any position in\nthe sky in <20 seconds. The camera is composed of 1855 photomultiplier tubes\nand embeds the control, readout and trigger electronics. The detailed design is\nnow complete and production of the first LST, which will serve as a prototype\nfor the remaining seven, is ongoing. The installation of the first LST at the\nRoque de los Muchachos Observatory on the Canary island of La Palma (Spain)\nstarted in July 2016. In this paper we will outline the technical solutions\nadopted to fulfill the design requirements, present results of element\nprototyping and describe the installation and operation plans.\n", "  The dynamics, energetics and evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and\nsupernova remnants (SNRs), are strongly affected by their magnetic field\nstrength and distribution. They are usually strong, extended, sources of\nnon-thermal X-ray radiation, producing intrinsically polarised radiation. The\nenergetic wind around pulsars produces a highly-magnetised, structured flow,\noften displaying a jet and a torus and different features (i.e. wisps, knots).\nThis magnetic-dominant wind evolves as it moves away from the pulsar\nmagnetosphere to the surrounding large-scale nebula, becoming kinetic-dominant.\nBasic aspects such how this conversion is produced, or how the jets and torus\nare formed, as well as the level of turbulence in the nebula are still unknown.\nLikewise, the processes ruling the acceleration of particles in shell-like SNRs\nup to 1e15 eV, including the amplification of the magnetic field, are not clear\nyet. Imaging polarimetry in this regard is crucial to localise the regions of\nshock acceleration and to measure the strength and the orientation of the\nmagnetic field at these emission sites. X-ray polarimetry with the X-ray\nImaging Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE) will allow the understanding of the\nmagnetic field structure and intensity on different regions in SNRs and PWNe,\nhelping to unveil long-standing questions such as i.e. acceleration of cosmic\nrays in SNRs or magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer. SNRs and PWNe also\nrepresent the largest population of Galactic very-high energy gamma-ray\nsources, therefore the study of their magnetic distribution with XIPE will\nprovide fundamental ingredients on the investigation of those sources at very\nhigh energies. We will discuss the physics case related to SNRs and PWNe and\nthe expectations of the XIPE observations of some of the most prominent SNRs\nand PWNe.\n", "  We solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently for the\n$d$-wave order parameter in nanoscale $d$-wave systems with [110] surfaces and\nshow that spontaneous time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking occurs at low\ntemperatures due to a spontaneously induced complex order parameter of extended\n$s$-wave symmetry. The Andreev surface bound states, which are protected by a\none-dimensional (1D) topological invariant in the presence of TRS, are gapped\nby the emergence of this new order parameter. The extended $s$-wave order\nparameter is localized within a narrow region near the surfaces, which is\nconsistent with the fact that topological protection of the gapless Andreev\nsurface states is characterized by the 1D topological invariant. In this\nTRS-breaking phase, not only is the complex order parameter induced, but also\nthe $d$-wave order parameter itself becomes complex. Furthermore, the\ndisappearance of topological protection brings about novel vortex phenomena\nnear the surfaces. We show that vortex-antivortex pairs are formed in the\nextended $s$-wave order parameter along the surfaces if the side length of a\nnanoisland or the width of an infinitely long nanoribbon is relatively large.\n", "  The very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) sky is dominated by blazars,\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei whose relativistic jet is closely aligned\nwith the line of sight. Blazars are characterized by rapid variability at all\nwavelengths and thus an important part of the H.E.S.S. blazar program is\ndevoted to target of opportunity (ToO) observations. H.E.S.S. triggers blazar\nToOs on the basis of publicly available blazar observations at longer\nwavelengths (optical, X-rays, and $\\gamma$-rays), from private optical\nobservations with the ATOM telescope, and from private communications by\n$\\gamma$-ray partners in the context of MoUs. In 2015, about 70 hours of\nH.E.S.S. data were taken in the form of blazar ToOs, which represents ~15$\\%$\nof all extragalactic observations. In this contribution, we present the\nH.E.S.S. blazar ToO status, and we focus on two major results from the 2015\nseason: the detection of VHE emission from 3C 279 during the June 2015 flare,\nand the discovery of PKS 0736+017 as a new VHE quasar.\n", "  HESS J1943+213 is a very high energy (VHE; 100 GeV) {\\gamma}-ray source in\nthe direction of the Galactic plane. 38 hours of deep VERITAS observations\ntaken over two seasons detect the source with ~20 {\\sigma} significance.\nMonitoring observations of HESS J1943+213 show a remarkably stable flux and\nspectrum in VHE {\\gamma}-rays. Studies exploring the classification of HESS\nJ1943+213 are converging towards accepting the source as an extreme synchrotron\nBL Lac object. Specifically, overall SED characteristics of the source, the\ndetection of a potential host galaxy in near-IR imaging, and VLBI observations\nof the HESS J1943+213 radio counterpart showing extended jet-like emission at\nmilliarcsecond scale and core flux density variability establish the source as\na blazar. Recent Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the source\n(shown here for the first time) confirm the extended structure found in the 1.6\nGHz band and detect the jet-like component in the 4.6 GHz and the 7.3 GHz\nbands. The spectral indices of the core and the jet-like components derived\nfrom the VLBA observations are in a range typical for blazars. HESS J1943+213\nfits the extreme HBL description; however, with variability detected only at\nmilliarcseconds scales in radio, it appears to be an abnormally stable VHE\n{\\gamma}-ray blazar.\n", "  Galactic cosmic rays are believed to be accelerated at supernova remnant\nshocks. Gamma-ray observations of both supernova remnants and associated\nmolecular clouds have been used in several occasions to test (so far quite\nsuccessfully) this popular hypothesis. Despite that, a conclusive solution to\nthe problem of cosmic ray origin is still missing, and further observational\nand theoretical efforts are needed. In this paper, the current status of these\ninvestigations is briefly reviewed.\n", "  Blazars are extremely variable objects emitting radiation across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum and showing variability on time scales from minutes to\nyears. For the understanding of the emission mechanisms, simultaneous\nmulti-wavelength observations are crucial. Various models for flares predict\nsimultaneous flux increases in the X-ray and gamma-ray band or more complex\nvariability patterns, depending on the dominant process responsible for the\ngamma-ray emission. Monitoring at TeV energies is providing important\ninformation to distinguish between different models. To study duty cycle and\nvariability time scales of an object, an unbiased data sample is essential, and\ngood sensitivity and continuous monitoring are needed to resolve smaller time\nscales. A dedicated long-term monitoring program at TeV energies has been\nstarted by the FACT project. Its success clearly illustrated that the usage of\nsilicon based photo sensors (SIPMs) is ideal for long-term monitoring. They\nprovide not only an excellent and stable detector performance, but also allow\nfor observations during bright ambient light minimizing observational gaps and\nincreasing the instrument's duty cycle. The observation time in a single\nlongitude is limited to 6 hours. To study typical variability time scales of\nfew hours to one day, the ultimate goal is 24/7 monitoring with a network of\nsmall telescopes around the globe (DWARF project). The installation of an\nImaging Air Cherenkov Telescope is planned in San Pedro Martir, Mexico. For the\nM@TE (Monitoring at TeV energies) telescope, a mount from a previous experiment\nis being refurbished to be equipped with a camera using the new generation of\nSiPMs. In the presentation, the status of the M@TE project will be reported\noutlining the scientific potential, including the possibility to extend\nmonitoring campaigns to 12 hours by coordinated observations together with\nFACT.\n", "  For studying variable sources like blazars, it is crucial to achieve unbiased\nmonitoring, either with dedicated telescopes in pointing mode or survey\ninstruments. At TeV energies, the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)\nobservatory monitors approximately two thirds of the sky every day. It uses the\nwater Cherenkov technique, which provides an excellent duty cycle independent\nof weather and season. The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) monitors a\nsmall sample of sources with better sensitivity, using the imaging air\nCherenkov technique. Thanks to its camera with silicon-based photosensors, FACT\nfeatures an excellent detector performance and stability and extends its\nobservations to times with strong moonlight, increasing the duty cycle compared\nto other imaging air Cherenkov telescopes. As FACT and HAWC have overlapping\nenergy ranges, a joint study can exploit the longer daily coverage given that\nthe observatories' locations are offset by 5.3 hours. Furthermore, the better\nsensitivity of FACT adds a finer resolution of features on hour-long time\nscales, while the continuous duty cycle of HAWC ensures evenly sampled\nlong-term coverage. Thus, the two instruments complement each other to provide\na more complete picture of blazar variability. In this presentation, the first\njoint study of light curves from the two instruments will be shown, correlating\nlong-term measurements with daily sampling between air and water Cherenkov\ntelescopes. The presented results focus on the study of the variability of the\nbright blazars Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 during the last two years featuring various\nflaring activities.\n", "  We propose the creation of a two-dimensional topological semimetal in a\nsemiconductor artificial lattice with triangular symmetry. An in-plane magnetic\nfield drives a quantum phase transition between the topological insulating and\ntopological semimetal phases. The topological semimetal is characterized by\nrobust band touching points which carry quantized Berry flux and edge states\nwhich terminate at the band touching points. The topological phase transition\nis predicted to occur at magnetic fields $\\sim 4\\text{T}$ in high mobility GaAs\nartificial lattices, and can be detected via the anomalous behaviour of the\nedge conductance.\n", "  We derive a many-particle inseparability criterion for mixed states using the\nrelation between single-mode and many-particle nonclassicalities. It works very\nwell not only in the vicinity of the Dicke states, but also for the\nsuperposition of them: superradiant ground state of finite/infinite number of\nparticles and time evolution of single-photon superradiance. We also obtain a\ncriterion for ensemble-field entanglement which works fine for such kind of\nstates. Even though the collective excitations of the many-particle system is\nsub-Poissonian --which results in entanglement-- the wave function displays\nbunching.\n", "  We carry out a systematical study of the spectral lag properties of 50\nsingle-pulsed Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by Fermi/GBM. By dividing the\nlight curves into multiple consecutive energy channels we provide a new\nmeasurement of the spectral lag which is independent on energy channel\nselections. We perform a detailed statistical study of our new measurements. We\nfind two similar power-law energy dependencies of both the pulse arrival time\nand pulse width. Our new results on the power-law indices would favor the\nrelativistic geometric effects for the origin of spectral lag. However, a\ncomplete theoretical framework that can fully account for the diverse energy\ndependencies of both arrival time and pulse width revealed in this work is\nstill missing. We also study the spectral evolution behaviors of the GRB\npulses. We find that the GRB pulse with negligible spectral lag would usually\nhave a shorter pulse duration and would appear to have a \"hardness-intensity\ntracking\" (HIT) behavior and the GRB pulse with a significant spectral lag\nwould usually have a longer pulse duration and would appear to have a\n\"hard-to-soft\" (HTS) behavior.\n", "  X-ray burst model predictions of light curves and final composition of the\nnuclear ashes are affected by uncertain nuclear masses. However, not all of\nthese masses are determined experimentally with sufficient accuracy. Here we\nidentify remaining nuclear mass uncertainties in X-ray burst models using a one\nzone model that takes into account the changes in temperature and density\nevolution caused by changes in the nuclear physics. Two types of bursts are\ninvestigated - a typical mixed H/He burst with a limited rp-process and an\nextreme mixed H/He burst with an extended rp-process. When allowing for a\n3$\\sigma$ variation only three remaining nuclear mass uncertainties affect the\nlight curve predictions of a typical H/He burst ($^{27}$P, $^{61}$Ga, and\n$^{65}$As), and only three additional masses affect the composition strongly\n($^{80}$Zr, $^{81}$Zr, and $^{82}$Nb). A larger number of mass uncertainties\nremains to be addressed for the extreme H/He burst with the most important\nbeing $^{58}$Zn, $^{61}$Ga, $^{62}$Ge, $^{65}$As, $^{66}$Se, $^{78}$Y,\n$^{79}$Y, $^{79}$Zr, $^{80}$Zr, $^{81}$Zr, $^{82}$Zr, $^{82}$Nb, $^{83}$Nb,\n$^{86}$Tc, $^{91}$Rh, $^{95}$Ag, $^{98}$Cd, $^{99}$In, $^{100}$In, and\n$^{101}$In. The smallest mass uncertainty that still impacts composition\nsignificantly when varied by 3$\\sigma$ is $^{85}$Mo with 16 keV uncertainty.\nFor one of the identified masses, $^{27}$P, we use the isobaric mass multiplet\nequation (IMME) to improve the mass uncertainty, obtaining an atomic mass\nexcess of -716(7) keV. The results provide a roadmap for future experiments at\nadvanced rare isotope beam facilities, where all the identified nuclides are\nexpected to be within reach for precision mass measurements.\n", "  High-energy photons (above the MeV) are a powerful probe for astrophysics and\nfor fundamental physics under extreme conditions. During the recent years, our\nknowledge of the high-energy gamma-ray sky has impressively progressed thanks\nto the advent of new detectors for cosmic gamma rays, at ground (H.E.S.S.,\nMAGIC, VERITAS, HAWC) and in space (AGILE, Fermi). This presentation reviews\nthe present status of the studies of fundamental physics problems with\nhigh-energy gamma rays, and discusses the expected experimental developments.\n", "  The role of the non-resonant firehose instability in conditions relevant to\nthe precursors of supernova remnant shocks is considered. Using a second order\ntensor expansion of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation we illustrate the\nnecessary conditions for the firehose to operate. It is found that for very\nfast shocks, the diffusion approximation predicts that the linear firehose\ngrowth rate is marginally faster than its resonant counterpart. Preliminary\nhybrid MHD-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck simulation results using young supernova\nrelevant parameters are presented.\n", "  The pulsar wind nebula (PWN) HESS~J1825-137, known to exhibit strong energy\ndependent morphology, was discovered by HESS in 2005. Powered by the pulsar\nPSR~B1823-13, the TeV gamma-ray emitting nebula is significantly offset from\nthe pulsar. The asymmetric shape and 21~kyr characteristic age of the pulsar\nsuggest that HESS~J1825-137 is in an evolved state, having possibly already\nundergone reverse shock interactions from the progenitor supernova. Given its\nlarge angular extent, despite its 4~kpc distance, it may have the largest\nintrinsic size of any TeV PWN so far detected. A rich dataset is currently\navailable with H.E.S.S., including H.E.S.S. II data with a low energy\nthreshold, enabling detailed studies of the source properties and environment.\nWe present new views of the changing nature of the PWN with energy, including\nmaps of the region and spectral studies.\n", "  The magnetospheres of magnetars are believed to be filled with\nelectron-positron plasma generated by electric discharge. We present a first\ndirect numerical experiment showing how the plasma is created in an\naxisymmetric closed magnetosphere. The $e^\\pm$ discharge occurs in response to\ntwisting of the magnetic field lines by a shear deformation of the magnetar\nsurface, which launches electric currents into the magnetosphere. The\nsimulation shows the formation of an electric \"gap\" with unscreened electric\nfield ($\\mathbf{E}\\cdot \\mathbf{B}\\neq 0$) that continually accelerates\nparticles along the magnetic field lines and sustains pair creation. The\naccelerating voltage is self-regulated to the threshold of the $e^\\pm$\ndischarge. It controls the rate of energy release and the lifetime of the\nmagnetic twist. The simulation follows the global evolution of the twisted\nmagnetosphere over a long time and demonstrates its gradual resistive\nuntwisting. A vacuum cavity forms near the star and expands, gradually erasing\nmagnetospheric electric currents $j$. The active j-bundle shrinks with time and\nits footprints form shrinking hot spots on the magnetar surface bombarded by\nthe created particles.\n", "  The rise of graphene marks the advent of two-dimensional atomic crystals,\nwhich have exhibited a cornucopia of intriguing properties, such as the integer\nand fractional quantum Hall effects, valley Hall effect, charge density waves\nand superconductivity, to name a few. Yet, magnetism, a property of extreme\nimportance in both science and technology, remains elusive. There is a\nparamount need for magnetic two-dimensional crystals. With the availability of\nmany magnetic materials consisting of van der Waals coupled two-dimensional\nlayers, it thus boils down to the question of how the magnetic order will\nevolve with reducing thickness. Here we investigate the effect of thickness on\nthe magnetic ordering in nanothick V$_5$S$_8$. We uncover an anomalous Hall\neffect, by which the magnetic ordering in V$_5$S$_8$ down to 3.2 nm is probed.\nWith decreasing thickness, a breakdown of antiferromagnetism is evident,\nfollowed by a spin-glass-like state. For thinnest samples, a weak ferromagnetic\nordering emerges. The results not only show an interesting effect of reducing\nthickness on the magnetic ordering in a potential candidate for magnetic\ntwo-dimensional crystals, but demonstrate the anomalous Hall effect as a useful\ncharacterization tool for magnetic orderings in two-dimensional systems.\n", "  Most modeling attempts of blazars use a small emission zone located close to\nthe central black hole in order to explain the broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution. Here we present a case where additionally to the small region a\n$>$kpc-scale jet is required to successfully reproduce the spectrum and\nespecially the TeV emission, namely the low-frequeny peaked BL Lac object AP\nLibrae detected in the TeV domain by the H.E.S.S. experiment. Given that other\nparts of the spectral energy distribution follow the characteristics implied by\nthe source classification, the inverse Compton component spans 10 orders of\nmagnitude, which cannot be reproduced by the one-zone model. Additionally,\nobservational constraints in both the synchrotron and inverse Compton\ncompoenent strongly constrain the parameters of a self-consistent model ruling\nout the possibility of TeV photon production in the vicinity of the galactic\ncenter. We discuss the possibility that the TeV radiation is emitted by highly\nenergetic particles in the extended, arcsec-scale jet, which has been detected\nat radio and X-ray energies. The slope of the jet X-ray spectrum indicates an\ninverse Compton origin, and an extrapolation to higher energies coincides with\na break feature in the $\\gamma$-ray band. Modeling the jet emission with\ninverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background results in an\nexcellent fit of the radio, X-ray and TeV emission. Implications will be\ndiscussed, such as properties of the jet, acceleration scenarios, and\nobservations to test the model. If confirmed, large scale jets are able to\nefficiently accelerate particles and to keep relativistic speeds up to\ndistances of several 100kpc.\n", "  We analyze and compare the structural, dynamical, and electronic properties\nof liquid water next to prototypical metals including Pt, graphite, and\ngraphene. Our results are built on Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD)\ngenerated using density functional theory (DFT) which explicitly include van\nder Waals (vdW) interactions within a first principles approach. All\ncalculations reported use large simulation cells, allowing for an accurate\ntreatment of the water-electrode interfaces. We have included vdW interactions\nthrough the use of the optB86b-vdW exchange correlation functional. Comparisons\nwith the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional are also\nshown. We find an initial peak, due to chemisorption, in the density profile of\nthe liquid water-Pt interface not seen in the liquid water-graphite interface,\nliquid water-graphene interface, nor interfaces studied previously. To further\ninvestigate this chemisorption peak, we also report differences in the\nelectronic structure of single water molecules on both Pt and graphite\nsurfaces. We find that a covalent bond forms between the single water molecule\nand the Pt surface, but not between the single water molecule and the graphite\nsurface. We also discuss the effects that defects and dopants in the graphite\nand graphene surfaces have on the structure and dynamics of liquid water.\n", "  We carry out investigations of inverted crossover resonances in $\\pi$-driven\nfour-level systems where $\\Delta F$ can be zero. Through the use of sub-Doppler\nfrequency modulation spectroscopy of the $(6s^{2})$ $^{1}S_{0}$ $-$ $(6s6p)$\n$^{3}P_{1}$ transition in $^{171}$Yb the resonance becomes manifest. The\ncentre-frequency is inherently insensitive to first-order Zeeman shifts and\nequates to the two-level resonance frequency in the absence of a magnetic\nfield. A rate equation model is used to help validate the nature of the\nresonance. Optical frequency measurements of the $F'=1/2$ hyperfine line\nrecorded over two months demonstrate a statistical uncertainty of\n$2\\times10^{-11}$. The inverted crossover resonance found with the $F'=3/2$\nline is used for 556 nm laser frequency stabilization, which is an alternative\nmeans when applied to magneto-optical trapping of $^{171}$Yb.\n", "  Effects on atmospheric prompt neutrino fluxes of present uncertainties\naffecting the nucleon composition are studied by using the PROSA fit to parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs). The PROSA fit extends the precision of the PDFs\nto low x, which is the kinematic region of relevance for high-energy neutrino\nproduction, by taking into account LHCb data on charm and bottom\nhadroproduction. In the range of neutrino energies explored by present Very\nLarge Volume Neutrino Telescopes, it is found that PDF uncertainties are far\nsmaller with respect to those due to renormalization and factorization scale\nvariation and to assumptions on the cosmic ray composition, which at present\ndominate and limit our knowledge of prompt neutrino fluxes. A discussion is\npresented on how these uncertainties affect the expected number of atmospheric\nprompt neutrino events in the analysis of high-energy events characterized by\ninteraction vertices fully contained within the instrumented volume of the\ndetector, performed by the IceCube collaboration.\n", "  The reaction ${\\gamma}N \\to {\\eta}N$ is studied in the high-energy regime\n(with photon lab energies $E_{\\gamma}^{\\textrm{lab}} > 4$ GeV) using\ninformation from the resonance region through the use of finite-energy sum\nrules (FESR). We illustrate how analyticity allows one to map the t-dependence\nof the unknown Regge residue functions. We provide predictions for the energy\ndependence of the beam asymmetry at high energies.\n", "  We demonstrate that current experiments using cold bosonic atoms trapped in\none-dimensional optical lattices and designed to measure the second-order Renyi\nentanglement entropy S_2, can be used to verify detailed predictions of\nconformal field theory (CFT) and estimate the central charge c. We discuss the\nadiabatic preparation of the ground state at half-filling where we expect a CFT\nwith c=1. This can be accomplished with a very small hoping parameter J, in\ncontrast to existing studies with density one where a much larger J is needed.\nWe provide two complementary methods to estimate and subtract the classical\nentropy generated by the experimental preparation and imaging processes. We\ncompare numerical calculations for the classical O(2) model with a chemical\npotential on a 1+1 dimensional lattice, and the quantum Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian implemented in the experiments. S_2 is very similar for the two\nmodels and follows closely the Calabrese-Cardy scaling, (c/8)\\ln(N_s), for N_s\nsites with open boundary conditions, provided that the large subleading\ncorrections are taken into account.\n", "  On 29 August 2014, the trigger and evolution of a cusp-shaped jet were\ncaptured in detail at 1330 {\\AA} by the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph.At first, two neighboring mini-prominences arose in turn from low\nsolar atmosphere and collided with a loop-like system over them. The collisions\nbetween the loop-like system and the mini-prominences lead to the blowout and\nthen a cusp-shaped jet formed with a spire and an arch-base.\n  In the spire, many brightening blobs originating from the junction between\nthe spire and the arch-base, moved upward in a rotating manner and then in a\nstraight line in the late phase of the jet. In the arch-base, dark and bright\nmaterial simultaneously tracked in a fan-like structure and the majority of the\nmaterial moved along the fan's threads.\n  At the later phase of the jet's evolution, bidirectional flows emptied the\narch-base, while down-flows emptied the spire, thus making the jet entirely\nvanish. The extremely detailed observations in this study shed new light on how\nmagnetic reconnection alters the inner topological structure of a jet, and\nprovide a beneficial complement for understanding current jet models.\n", "  We investigate the existence and propagation of solitons in a long-range\nextension of the quartic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) chain of anharmonic\noscillators. The coupling in the linear term decays as a power-law with an\nexponent greater than 1 and less than 3. We obtain an analytic perturbative\nexpression of traveling envelope solitons by introducing a Non Linear\nSchrodinger (NLS) equation for the slowly varying amplitude of short wavelength\nmodes. Due to the non analytic properties of the dispersion relation, it is\ncrucial to develop the theory using discrete difference operators. Those\nproperties are also the ultimate reason why kink-solitons may exist but are\nunstable, at variance with the short-range FPU model. We successfully compare\nthese approximate analytic results with numerical simulations.\n", "  We address the question of whether symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order\ncan persist at nonzero temperature, with a focus on understanding the thermal\nstability of several models studied in the theory of quantum computation. We\npresent three results in this direction. First, we prove that nontrivial SPT\norder protected by a global on-site symmetry cannot persist at nonzero\ntemperature, demonstrating that several quantum computational structures\nprotected by such on-site symmetries are not thermally stable. Second, we prove\nthat the 3D cluster state model used in the formulation of topological\nmeasurement-based quantum computation possesses a nontrivial SPT-ordered\nthermal phase when protected by a global generalized (1-form) symmetry. The SPT\norder in this model is detected by long-range localizable entanglement in the\nthermal state, which compares with related results characterizing SPT order at\nzero temperature in spin chains using localizable entanglement as an order\nparameter. Our third result is to demonstrate that the high error tolerance of\nthis 3D cluster state model for quantum computation, even without a protecting\nsymmetry, can be understood as an application of quantum error correction to\neffectively enforce a 1-form symmetry.\n", "  We present a novel approach to constrain accelerating cosmologies with galaxy\ncluster phase spaces. With the Fisher matrix formalism we forecast constraints\non the cosmological parameters that describe the cosmological expansion\nhistory. We find that our probe has the potential of providing constraints\ncomparable to, or even stronger than, those from other cosmological probes.\nMore specifically, with 1000 (100) clusters uniformly distributed in the\nredshift range $ 0 \\leq z \\leq 0.8$, after applying a conservative $80\\%$ mass\nscatter prior on each cluster and marginalizing over all other parameters, we\nforecast $1\\sigma$ constraints on the dark energy equation of state $w$ and\nmatter density parameter $\\Omega_M$ of $\\sigma_w = 0.138 (0.431)$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\Omega_M} = 0.007 (0.025)$ in a flat universe. Assuming 40\\% mass\nscatter and adding a prior on the Hubble constant we can achieve a constraint\non the CPL parametrization of the dark energy equation of state parameters\n$w_0$ and $w_a$ with 100 clusters in the same redshift range: $\\sigma_{w_0} =\n0.191 $ and $\\sigma_{w_a} = 2.712$. Dropping the assumption of flatness and\nassuming $w=-1$ we also attain competitive constraints on the matter and dark\nenergy density parameters: $\\sigma_{\\Omega_M} = 0.101$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\Omega_{\\Lambda}} = 0.197$ for 100 clusters uniformly distributed in\nthe range $ 0 \\leq z \\leq 0.8$ after applying a prior on the Hubble constant.\nWe also discuss various observational strategies for tightening constraints in\nboth the near and far future.\n", "  Although high-sensitivity surveys have revealed a number of highly dispersed\npulsars in the inner Galaxy, none have so far been found in the Galactic centre\n(GC) region, which we define to be within a projected distance of 1~pc from\nSgr~A*. This null result is surprising given that several independent lines of\nevidence predict a sizable population of neutron stars in the region. Here, we\npresent a detailed analysis of both the canonical and millisecond pulsar\npopulations in the GC and consider free-free absorption and multi-path\nscattering to be the two main sources of flux density mitigation. We\ndemonstrate that the sensitivity limits of previous surveys are not sufficient\nto detect GC pulsar population, and investigate the optimum observing frequency\nfor future surveys. Depending on the degree of scattering and free-free\nabsorption in the GC, current surveys constrain the size of the potentially\nobservable population (i.e.~those beaming towards us) to be up to 52 canonical\npulsars and 10000 millisecond pulsars. We find that the optimum frequency for\nfuture surveys is in the range of 9--13~GHz. We also predict that future deeper\nsurveys with the Square Kilometer array will probe a significant portion of the\nexisting radio pulsar population in the GC.\n", "  Hardware based image processing offers speed and convenience not found in\nsoftware-centric approaches. Here, we show theoretically that a two-dimensional\nperiodic array of dipole-coupled elliptical nanomagnets, delineated on a\npiezoelectric substrate, can act as a dynamical system for specific image\nprocessing functions. Each nanomagnet has two stable magnetization states that\nencode pixel color (black or white). An image containing black and white pixels\nis first converted to voltage states and then mapped into the magnetization\nstates of a nanomagnet array with magneto-tunneling junctions (MTJs). The same\nMTJs are employed to read out the processed pixel colors later. Dipole\ninteraction between the nanomagnets implements specific image processing tasks\nsuch as noise reduction and edge enhancement detection. These functions are\ntriggered by applying a global strain to the nanomagnets with a voltage dropped\nacross the piezoelectric substrate. An image containing an arbitrary number of\nblack and white pixels can be processed in few nanoseconds with very low energy\ncost.\n", "  We consider spin systems on the integer lattice graph $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with\nnearest-neighbor interactions. We develop a combinatorial framework for\nestablishing that exponential decay with distance of spin correlations,\nspecifically the strong spatial mixing condition (SSM), implies rapid mixing of\na large class of Markov chains. As a first application of our method we prove\nthat SSM implies $O(\\log n)$ mixing of systematic scan dynamics (under mild\nconditions) on an $n$-vertex $d$-dimensional cube of the integer lattice graph\n$\\mathbb{Z}^d$. Systematic scan dynamics are widely employed in practice but\nhave proved hard to analyze. A second application of our technology concerns\nthe Swendsen-Wang dynamics for the ferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. We\nshow that SSM implies an $O(1)$ bound for the relaxation time (i.e., the\ninverse spectral gap). As a by-product of this implication we observe that the\nrelaxation time of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics in square boxes of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$\nis $O(1)$ throughout the subcritical regime of the $q$-state Potts model, for\nall $q \\ge 2$. We also use our combinatorial framework to give a simple\ncoupling proof of the classical result that SSM entails optimal mixing time of\nthe Glauber dynamics. Although our results in the paper focus on\n$d$-dimensional cubes in $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, they generalize straightforwardly to\narbitrary regions of $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ and to graphs with subexponential growth.\n", "  We compute the binding energy and angular momentum of a test-particle at the\nlast stable circular orbit (LSO) on the equatorial plane around a general\nrelativistic, rotating neutron star (NS). We present simple, analytic, but\naccurate formulas for these quantities that fit the numerical results and which\ncan be used in several astrophysical applications. We demonstrate the accuracy\nof these formulas for three different equations of state (EOS) based on nuclear\nrelativistic mean-field theory models and argue that they should remain still\nvalid for any NS EOS that satisfy current astrophysical constraints. We compare\nand contrast our numerical results with the corresponding ones for the Kerr\nmetric characterized by the same mass and angular momentum.\n", "  We investigate the fundamental limits in precision allowed by quantum\nmechanics from Landau-Zener transitions, concerning Hamiltonian parameters.\nWhile the Landau-Zener transition probabilities depend sensitively on the\nsystem parameters, much more precision may be obtained using the acquired\nphase, quantified by the quantum Fisher information. This information scales\nwith a power of the elapsed time for the quantum case, whereas it is\ntime-independent if the transition probabilities alone are used. We add\ncoherent control to the system, and increase the permitted maximum precision in\nthis time-dependent quantum system. The case of multiple passes before\nmeasurement, \"Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg interferometry\", is considered, and we\ndemonstrate that proper quantum control can cause the quantum Fisher\ninformation about the oscillation frequency to scale as $T^4$, where $T$ is the\nelapsed time.\n", "  The Sun is a bright source of GeV gamma rays, due to cosmic rays interacting\nwith solar matter and photons. Key aspects of the underlying processes remain\nmysterious. The emission in the TeV range, for which there are neither\nobservational nor theoretical studies, could provide crucial clues. The new\nexperiments HAWC (running) and LHAASO (planned) can look at the Sun with\nunprecedented sensitivity. In this paper, we predict the very high-energy (up\nto 1000 TeV) gamma-ray flux from the solar disk and halo, due to cosmic-ray\nhadrons and electrons ($e^++e^-$), respectively. We neglect solar magnetic\neffects, which is valid at TeV energies; at lower energies, this gives a\ntheoretical lower bound on the disk flux and a theoretical upper bound on the\nhalo flux. We show that the solar-halo gamma-ray flux allows the first test of\nthe $\\sim 5$--70 TeV cosmic-ray electron spectrum. Further, we show that HAWC\ncan immediately make an even stronger test with nondirectional observations of\ncosmic-ray electrons. Together, these gamma-ray and electron studies will\nprovide new insights about the local density of cosmic rays and their\ninteractions with the Sun and its magnetic environment. These studies will also\nbe an important input to tests of new physics, including dark matter.\n", "  We investigate the full-counting statistics (FCS) of energy transport carried\nby electrons in molecular junctions for the Anderson-Holstein model in the\npolaronic regime. Using two-time quantum measurement scheme, generating\nfunction (GF) for the energy transport is derived and expressed as a Fredholm\ndeterminant in terms of Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function in the time\ndomain. Dressed tunneling approximation is used in decoupling the phonon cloud\noperator in the polaronic regime. This formalism enables us to analyze the time\nevolution of energy transport dynamics after a sudden switch-on of the coupling\nbetween the dot and the leads towards the stationary state. The steady state\nenergy current cumulant GF in the long time limit is obtained in the energy\ndomain as well. Universal relations for steady state energy current FCS are\nderived under finite temperature gradient with zero bias and this enables us to\nexpress the equilibrium energy current cumulant by a linear combination of\nlower order cumulants. Behaviors of energy current cumulants in steady state\nunder temperature gradient and external bias are numerically studied and\nexplained. Transient dynamics of energy current cumulants is numerically\ncalculated and analyzed. The universal scaling of normalized transient energy\ncumulants is found under both temperature gradient and external bias.\n", "  Context: At the low accretion-rates typical for BL Lac-objects,\nmagnetospheres of active galactic nuclei can develop vacuum gaps with strong\nelectric fields accelerating charged seed particles parallel to the magnetic\nfields up to ultra-relativistic energies. The seed particles sustain\nelectromagnetic cascades by inverse-Compton-scattering and subsequent\npair-production in soft background-radiation-fields from the accretion-disk\nand/or photo-ionised clouds, along the direction of the primary particle beams.\n  Method: The one-dimensional kinetic equation describing this linear\ninverse-Compton-Klein-Nishina-pair-cascade is inferred. We have developed a\nnovel code, that can numerically solve this kinetic equation for an ample\nvariety of input-parameters. By this, quasi-stationary particle- and\nphoton-spectra are obtained.\n  Application: We use the code to model the cascaded interaction of electrons,\nthat have been accelerated in a vacuum gap in the magnetosphere of Mrk 501,\nwith Lyman-alpha-photons. The resulting spectrum on top of a\nsynchrotron-self-Compton-background can cause a narrow TeV-bump in the spectrum\nof Mrk 501.\n", "  We prove that there is no finite-alphabet nonlocal box that generates exactly\nthose correlations that can be generated using a maximally entangled pair of\nqubits. More generally, we prove that if some finite-alphabet nonlocal box is\nstrong enough to simulate arbitrary local projective measurements of a\nmaximally entangled pair of qubits, then that nonlocal box cannot itself be\nsimulated using any finite amount of entanglement. We also give a quantitative\nversion of this theorem for approximate simulations, along with a corresponding\nupper bound.\n", "  We present the algorithm and main results of our semi-numerical simulation,\nislandFAST, which is developed from the 21cmFAST and designed for the late\nstage of reionization. The islandFAST predicts the evolution and size\ndistribution of the large scale under-dense neutral regions (neutral islands),\nand we find that the late Epoch of Reionization (EoR) proceeds very fast,\nshowing a characteristic scale of the neutral islands at each redshift. Using\nislandFAST, we compare the impact of two types of absorption systems, i.e. the\nlarge scale under-dense neutral islands versus small scale over-dense\nabsorbers, in regulating the reionization process. The neutral islands dominate\nthe morphology of the ionization field, while the small scale absorbers\ndominate the mean free path of ionizing photons, and also delay and prolong the\nreionization process. With our semi-numerical simulation, the evolution of the\nionizing background can be derived self-consistently given a model for the\nsmall absorbers. The hydrogen ionization rate of the ionizing background is\nreduced by an order of magnitude in the presence of dense absorbers.\n", "  We present a study of electric, thermal and thermoelectric response in\nnoncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_{3}$Sn, which hosts a large Anomalous Hall\nEffect (AHE). Berry curvature generates off-diagonal thermal(Righi-Leduc) and\nthermoelectric(Nernst) signals, which are detectable at room temperature and\ninvertible with a small magnetic field. The thermal and electrical Hall\nconductivities respect the Wiedemann-Franz law, implying that the transverse\ncurrents induced by Berry curvature are carried by Fermi surface\nquasi-particles. In contrast to conventional ferromagnets, the anomalous Lorenz\nnumber remains close to the Sommerfeld number over the whole temperature range\nof study, excluding any contribution by inelastic scattering and pointing to\nBerry curvature as the unique source of AHE. The anomalous off-diagonal\nthermo-electric and Hall conductivities are strongly temperature-dependent and\ntheir ratio is close to k$_{B}$/e.\n", "  We examine the origin of the mass discrepancy--radial acceleration relation\n(MDAR) of disk galaxies. This is a tight empirical correlation between the disk\ncentripetal acceleration and that expected from the baryonic component. The\nMDAR holds for most radii probed by disk kinematic tracers, regardless of\ngalaxy mass or surface brightness. The relation has two characteristic\naccelerations; $a_0$, above which all galaxies are baryon-dominated; and\n$a_{\\rm min}$, an effective minimum aceleration probed by kinematic tracers in\nisolated galaxies. We use a simple model to show that these trends arise\nnaturally in $\\Lambda$CDM. This is because: (i) disk galaxies in $\\Lambda$CDM\nform at the centre of dark matter haloes spanning a relatively narrow range of\nvirial mass; (ii) cold dark matter halo acceleration profiles are self-similar\nand have a broad maximum at the centre, reaching values bracketed precisely by\n$a_{\\rm min}$ and $a_0$ in that mass range; and (iii) halo mass and galaxy size\nscale relatively tightly with the baryonic mass of a galaxy in any successful\n$\\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation model. Explaining the MDAR in $\\Lambda$CDM does\nnot require modifications to the cuspy inner mass profiles of dark haloes,\nalthough these may help to understand the detailed rotation curves of some\ndwarf galaxies and the origin of extreme outliers from the main relation. The\nMDAR is just a reflection of the self-similar nature of cold dark matter haloes\nand of the physical scales introduced by the galaxy formation process.\n", "  The transient interplanetary disturbances evoke short time cosmic ray flux\ndecrease which is known as Forbush decrease. The traditional model and\nunderstanding of Forbush decrease suggest that the substructure of\ninterplanetary counterpart of coronal mass ejection (ICME) independently\ncontributes in cosmic ray flux decrease. These substructures, shock-sheath and\nmagnetic cloud (MC) manifest as classical two-step Forbush decrease. The recent\nwork by Raghav et. al. (2016a) has shown multi-step decreases and recoveries\nwithin shock-sheath. However, this can not be explained by ideal shock-sheath\nbarrier model. Further, they suggested that the local structures within the\nICME's sub-structure (MC and shock sheath) could explain this deviation of FD\nprofile from the classical FD. Therefore, present study attempts to investigate\nthe cause of multi-step cosmic ray flux decrease and their respective recovery\nwithin shock-sheath in detail. 3D-hodogram method has been utilized to get more\ndetails of the local structures within the shock-sheath. A 3D-hodogram method\nunambiguously suggests the formation of small scale local structures within the\nICME (shock-sheath and even in MC). Moreover, the method could differentiate\nthe turbulent and ordered Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) regions within\nthe substructures of ICME. The study explicitly suggests that the turbulent and\nordered IMF regions within shock-sheath do influence cosmic-ray variations\nuniquely.\n", "  The inherently nonlinear interaction between light and motion in cavity\noptomechanical systems has experimentally been studied in a linearized\ndescription in all except highly driven cases. Here we demonstrate a nanoscale\noptomechanical system, in which the interaction between light and motion is so\nlarge (single-photon cooperativity $C_0 \\approx 10^3$) that thermal motion\ninduces optical frequency fluctuations larger than the intrinsic optical\nlinewidth. The system thereby operates in a fully nonlinear regime, which\npronouncedly impacts the optical response, displacement measurement, and\nradiation pressure backaction. Experiments show that the apparent optical\nlinewidth is dominated by thermomechanically-induced frequency fluctuations\nover a wide temperature range. The nonlinearity induces breakdown of the\ntraditional cavity optomechanical descriptions of thermal displacement\nmeasurements. Moreover, we explore how radiation pressure backaction in this\nregime affects the mechanical fluctuation spectra. The strong nonlinearity\ncould serve as a resource to control the motional state of the resonator. We\ndemonstrate the use of highly nonlinear transduction to perform a quadratic\nmeasurement of position while suppressing linear transduction.\n", "  Coulomb interaction between two closely spaced parallel layers of electron\nsystem can generate the frictional drag effect by interlayer Coulomb\nscattering. Employing graphene double layers separated by few layer hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN), we investigate density tunable magneto- and Hall-drag\nunder strong magnetic fields. The observed large magneto-drag and Hall-drag\nsignals can be related with Laudau level (LL) filling status of the drive and\ndrag layers. We find that the sign and magnitude of the magneto- and Hall-drag\nresistivity tensor can be quantitatively correlated to the variation of\nmagneto-resistivity tensors in the drive and drag layers, confirming a\ntheoretical formula for magneto-drag in the quantum Hall regime. The observed\nweak temperature dependence and $\\sim B^2$ dependence of the magneto-drag are\nqualitatively explained by Coulomb scattering phase-space argument.\n", "  We study the electronic structure of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\\delta}$\n(Hg1223 ; T$_{c}$ = 134 K) using photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and x-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS). Resonant valence band PES across the O K-edge\nand Cu L-edge identify correlation satellites originating in O 2p and Cu 3d\ntwo-hole final states, respectively. Analyses using the experimental O 2p and\nCu 3d partial density of states show quantitatively different on-site Coulomb\nenergy for the Cu-site (U$_{dd}$ = 6.5$\\pm$0.5 eV) and O-site (U$_{pp}$ =\n1.0$\\pm$0.5 eV). Cu$_{2}$O$_{7}$-cluster calculations with non-local screening\nexplain the Cu 2p core level PES and Cu L-edge XAS spectra, confirm the\nU$_{dd}$ and U$_{pp}$ values, and provide evidence for the Zhang-Rice singlet\nstate in Hg1223. In contrast to other hole-doped cuprates and 3d-transition\nmetal oxides, the present results indicate weakly correlated oxygen holes in\nHg1223.\n", "  A density-matrix formalism within the length gauge is developed to calculate\nthe nonlinear response of both doped and undoped biased bilayer graphene (BBLG)\nat terahertz frequencies. Employing a tight-binding model, we derive an\neffective two-band Hamiltonian with which we calculate the conduction and\nvalence band dispersion, as well as their respective Bloch states. We then\nsolve for the dynamic equations of the density matrix elements, allowing for\nthe calculation of the intraband and interband current densities and the\ntransmitted and reflected terahertz fields. We find that for undoped BBLG with\na gap size of 4 meV, the reflected field exhibits a third harmonic amplitude\nthat is 45% of the fundamental in the reflected field (0.07% of the incident\nfield fundamental) for an incident 1 THz single-cycle pulse with a field\namplitude of 2.0 kV/cm. We find for doped BBLG, although the dispersion becomes\nhighly nonparabolic as a bias is applied, the third harmonic is a maximum of 8%\nof the fundamental in the reflected field (0.56% of the incident field\nfundamental) when there is no bias and diminishes with an increase in bias.\n", "  We generalize the Vicsek model to describe the collective behaviour of polar\ncircle swimmers with local alignment interactions. While the phase transition\nleading to collective motion in 2D (flocking) occurs at the same interaction to\nnoise ratio as for linear swimmers, as we show, circular motion enhances the\npolarization in the ordered phase (enhanced flocking) and induces secondary\ninstabilities leading to structure formation. Slow rotations result in phase\nseparation whereas fast rotations generate patterns which consist of phase\nsynchronized microflocks of controllable self-limited size. Our results defy\nthe viewpoint that monofrequent rotations form a rather trivial extension of\nthe Vicsek model and establish a generic route to pattern formation in chiral\nactive matter with possible applications to control coarsening and to design\nrotating microflocks.\n", "  In the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, magnetic field can drive a\nproximitized nanowire into a topological superconducting phase. We study\ntransport properties of such nanowires in the Coulomb blockade regime. The\nassociated with the topological superconductivity Majorana modes significantly\nmodify transport and lead to single-electron coherent transmission through the\nnanowire - a non-local signature of topological superconductivity. In this\nwork, we focus on the case of strong hybridization of the Majorana modes with\nthe normal leads. The induced by hybridization broadening of the Majorana\nzero-energy states competes with the charging energy, leading to a considerable\nmodification of the Coulomb blockade in a nanowire contacted by two normal\nleads. We evaluate the two-terminal conductance as a function of the gate\nvoltage, junctions transmission coefficients, the geometric capacitance of and\nthe induced superconducting gap in the nanowire.\n", "  We study the effect of unidirectional reflectivity in the bilayer optical\nmodel with the balanced loss/gain terms. It was found that if the impedances\ncharacterizing the scattering part are different from those describing the\nleads, a new effect of double-sided unidirectional reflectivity emerges. In\nthis case the vanishing of reflectivity occurs either for the left or right\nreflectivity, depending on the frequency of scattering wave. It is shown that\nthe alternation of the unidirectional reflectivity from the left to the right\ncan occur even if the corresponding Hamiltonian is non-PT-symmetric. Our\nanalytical results are demonstrated by numerical data.\n", "  Two integrable $U(1)$-invariant peakon equations are derived from the NLS\nhierarchy through the tri-Hamiltonian splitting method. A Lax pair, a recursion\noperator, a bi-Hamiltonian formulation, and a hierarchy of symmetries and\nconservation laws are obtained for both peakon equations. These equations are\nalso shown to arise as potential flows in the NLS hierarchy by applying the NLS\nrecursion operator to flows generated by space translations and $U(1)$-phase\nrotations on a potential variable. Solutions for both equations are derived\nusing a peakon ansatz combined with an oscillatory temporal phase. This yields\nthe first known example of a peakon breather. Spatially periodic counterparts\nof these solutions are also obtained.\n", "  In this paper, an enthalpy-based multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice\nBoltzmann (LB) method is developed for solid-liquid phase change heat transfer\nin metal foams under local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) condition. The\nenthalpy-based MRT-LB method consists of three different MRT-LB models: one for\nflow field based on the generalized non-Darcy model, and the other two for\nphase change material (PCM) and metal foam temperature fields described by the\nLTNE model. The moving solid-liquid phase interface is implicitly tracked\nthrough the liquid fraction, which is simultaneously obtained when the energy\nequations of PCM and metal foam are solved. The present method has several\ndistinctive features. First, as compared with previous studies, the present\nmethod avoids the iteration procedure, thus it retains the inherent merits of\nthe standard LB method and is superior over the iteration method in terms of\naccuracy and computational efficiency. Second, a volumetric LB scheme instead\nof the bounce-back scheme is employed to realize the no-slip velocity condition\nin the interface and solid phase regions, which is consistent with the actual\nsituation. Last but not least, the MRT collision model is employed, and with\nadditional degrees of freedom, it has the ability to reduce the numerical\ndiffusion across phase interface induced by solid-liquid phase change.\nNumerical tests demonstrate that the present method can be served as an\naccurate and efficient numerical tool for studying metal foam enhanced\nsolid-liquid phase change heat transfer in latent heat storage. Finally,\ncomparisons and discussions are made to offer useful information for practical\napplications of the present method.\n", "  The ever-growing datasets in observational astronomy have challenged\nscientists in many aspects, including an efficient and interactive data\nexploration and visualization. Many tools have been developed to confront this\nchallenge. However, they usually focus on displaying the actual images or focus\non visualizing patterns within catalogs in a predefined way. In this paper we\nintroduce Vizic, a Python visualization library that builds the connection\nbetween images and catalogs through an interactive map of the sky region. Vizic\nvisualizes catalog data over a custom background canvas using the shape, size\nand orientation of each object in the catalog. The displayed objects in the map\nare highly interactive and customizable comparing to those in the images. These\nobjects can be filtered by or colored by their properties, such as redshift and\nmagnitude. They also can be sub-selected using a lasso-like tool for further\nanalysis using standard Python functions from inside a Jupyter notebook.\nFurthermore, Vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of\nthe sky map. We have initially implemented several overlays, namely, Voronoi,\nDelaunay, Minimum Spanning Tree and HEALPix grid layers, which are helpful for\nvisualizing large-scale structure. All these overlays can be generated, added\nor removed interactively with one line of code. The catalog data is stored in a\nnon-relational database, and the interfaces were developed in JavaScript and\nPython to work within Jupyter Notebook, which allows to create custom widgets,\nuser generated scripts to analyze and plot the data selected/displayed in the\ninteractive map. This unique design makes Vizic a very powerful and flexible\ninteractive analysis tool. Vizic can be adopted in variety of exercises, for\nexample, data inspection, clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies,\noutlier identification or simply large-scale visualizations.\n", "  Two quasi local approaches to black holes are combined: Near Horizon\nGeometries (NHG) and stationary Black Hole Holographs (BHH). Necessary and\nsufficient conditions on BHH data for the emergence of NHGs as resulting vacuum\nsolutions to Einstein's equations are found.\n", "  We studied Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) escape in a statistical sample of 43\nGreen Peas with HST/COS Ly$\\alpha$ spectra. Green Peas are nearby star-forming\ngalaxies with strong [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 emission lines. Our sample is four\ntimes larger than the previous sample and covers a much more complete range of\nGreen Pea properties. We found that about 2/3 of Green Peas are strong\nLy$\\alpha$ line emitters with rest-frame Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent width $>20$ \\AA.\nThe Ly$\\alpha$ profiles of Green Peas are diverse. The Ly$\\alpha$ escape\nfraction, defined as the ratio of observed Ly$\\alpha$ flux to intrinsic\nLy$\\alpha$ flux, shows anti-correlations with a few Ly$\\alpha$ kinematic\nfeatures -- both the blue peak and red peak velocities, the peak separations,\nand FWHM of the red portion of the Ly$\\alpha$ profile. Using properties\nmeasured from SDSS optical spectra, we found many correlations -- Ly$\\alpha$\nescape fraction generally increases at lower dust reddening, lower metallicity,\nlower stellar mass, and higher [OIII]/[OII] ratio. We fit their Ly$\\alpha$\nprofiles with the HI shell radiative transfer model and found Ly$\\alpha$ escape\nfraction anti-correlates with the best-fit $N_{HI}$. Finally, we fit an\nempirical linear relation to predict Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction from the dust\nextinction and Ly$\\alpha$ red peak velocity. The standard deviation of this\nrelation is about 0.3 dex. This relation can be used to isolate the effect of\nIGM scatterings from Ly$\\alpha$ escape and to probe the IGM optical depth along\nthe line of sight of each $z>7$ Ly$\\alpha$ emission line galaxy in the JWST\nera.\n", "  In a classical world, simultaneous measurements of complementary properties\n(e.g. position and momentum) give a system's state. In quantum mechanics,\nmeasurement-induced disturbance is largest for complementary properties and,\nhence, limits the precision with which such properties can be determined\nsimultaneously. It is tempting to try to sidestep this disturbance by copying\nthe system and measuring each complementary property on a separate copy.\nHowever, perfect copying is physically impossible in quantum mechanics. Here,\nwe investigate using the closest quantum analog to this copying strategy,\noptimal cloning. The coherent portion of the generated clones' state\ncorresponds to \"twins\" of the input system. Like perfect copies, both twins\nfaithfully reproduce the properties of the input system. Unlike perfect copies,\nthe twins are entangled. As such, a measurement on both twins is equivalent to\na simultaneous measurement on the input system. For complementary observables,\nthis joint measurement gives the system's state, just as in the classical case.\nWe demonstrate this experimentally using polarized single photons.\n", "  The stellar winds of the massive stars in high-mass microquasars are thought\nto be inhomogeneous. The interaction of these inhomogeneities, or clumps, with\nthe jets of these objects may be a major factor in gamma-ray production. Our\ngoal is to characterize a typical scenario of clump-jet interaction, and\ncalculate the contribution of these interactions to the gamma-ray emission from\nthese systems. We use axisymmetric, RHD simulations to model the emitting flow\nin a typical clump-jet interaction. Using the simulation results we perform a\nnumerical calculation of the high-energy emission from one of these\ninteractions. The radiative calculations are done for relativistic electrons\nlocally accelerated at the jet shock, and the synchrotron and IC radiation\nspectra are computed for different stages of the shocked clump evolution. We\nalso explore different parameter values, such as viewing angle and magnetic\nfield strength. We generalize phenomenologically the results derived from one\nclump-jet interaction to multiple interactions under different wind models,\nestimating the clump-jet interaction rates, and the resulting luminosities in\nthe GeV range. If particles are efficiently accelerated in clump-jet\ninteractions, the apparent gamma-ray luminosity through IC scattering with the\nstellar photons can be significant even for rather strong magnetic fields and\nthus efficient synchrotron cooling. Moreover, despite the standing nature or\nslow motion of the jet shocks for most of the interaction stage, Doppler\nboosting in the postshock flow is relevant even for mildly relativistic jets.\nFor clump-to-average wind density contrasts $\\gtrsim 10$, clump-jet\ninteractions could be bright enough to match the observed GeV luminosity in\nCyg~X-1 and Cyg~X-3 when a jet is present in these sources, with required\nnon-thermal-to-total available power fractions $\\sim 0.01$ and $0.1$,\nrespectively.\n", "  Data processing pipelines represent an important slice of the astronomical\nsoftware library that include chains of processes that transform raw data into\nvaluable information via data reduction and analysis. In this work we present\nCorral, a Python framework for astronomical pipeline generation. Corral\nfeatures a Model-View-Controller design pattern on top of an SQL Relational\nDatabase capable of handling: custom data models; processing stages; and\ncommunication alerts, and also provides automatic quality and structural\nmetrics based on unit testing. The Model-View-Controller provides concept\nseparation between the user logic and the data models, delivering at the same\ntime multi-processing and distributed computing capabilities. Corral represents\nan improvement over commonly found data processing pipelines in Astronomy since\nthe design pattern eases the programmer from dealing with processing flow and\nparallelization issues, allowing them to focus on the specific algorithms\nneeded for the successive data transformations and at the same time provides a\nbroad measure of quality over the created pipeline. Corral and working examples\nof pipelines that use it are available to the community at\nhttps://github.com/toros-astro.\n", "  While interdependent systems have usually been associated with increased\nfragility, we show that strengthening the interdependence between dynamical\nprocesses on different networks can make them more robust. By coupling the\ndynamics of networks that in isolation exhibit catastrophic collapse with\nextinction of nodal activity, we demonstrate system-wide persistence of\nactivity for an optimal range of interdependence between the networks. This is\nrelated to the appearance of attractors of the global dynamics comprising\ndisjoint sets (\"islands\") of stable activity.\n", "  We consider a system of two one-dimensional nanowires coupled via an $s$-wave\nsuperconducting strip, a geometry that is capable of supporting Kramers pairs\nof Majorana fermions. By performing an exact analytical diagonalization of a\ntunneling Hamiltonian describing the proximity effect (via a Bogoliubov\ntransformation), we show that the excitation gap of the system varies\nperiodically on the scale of the Fermi wavelength in the limit where the\ninterwire separation is shorter than the superconducting coherence length.\nComparing with the excitation gaps in similar geometries containing only direct\npairing, where one wire is decoupled from the superconductor, or only crossed\nAndreev pairing, where each nanowire is considered as a spin-polarized edge of\na quantum Hall state, we find that the gap is always reduced, by orders of\nmagnitude in certain cases, when both types of pairing are present. Our\nanalytical results are further supported by numerical calculations on a\ntight-binding lattice. Finally, we show that treating the proximity effect by\nintegrating out the superconductor using the bulk Green's function does not\nreproduce the results of our exact diagonalization.\n", "  A computationally-efficient method for evaluating friction in molecular\nrotary bearings is presented. This method estimates drag from fluctuations in\nmolecular dynamics simulations via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This is\neffective even for simulation times short compared to a bearing's energy\ndamping time and for rotation speeds comparable to or below typical thermal\nvalues. We apply this method to two molecular rotary bearings of similar size\nat 300K: previously studied nested (9,9)/(14,14) double-walled carbon nanotubes\nand a hypothetical rotary joint consisting of single acetylenic bonds in a\nrigid diamondoid housing. The acetylenic joint has a rotational frictional drag\ncoefficient of $2 \\times 10^{-35}\\,\\mbox{kg m${}^2$/s}$. The friction for the\nnested nanotubes is 120 times larger, comparable to values reported by previous\nstudies. This fluctuation-based method could evaluate dissipation in a variety\nof molecular systems with similarly rigid and symmetric bearings.\n", "  We present a compact form of the leptonic currents for the computation of the\nprocesses involving an initial virtual boson (photon, $W^{\\pm}$ or $Z_0$). For\ndeeply inelastic scattering, once the azimuthal angle of the plane expanded by\nthe initial- and final-state leptons are integrated over in the boson-proton\nrest frame, the azimuthal-asymmetric terms vanish, which, however, is NOT true\nwhen some physical quantities (such as the transverse momentum of the observed\nparticle) are specified in laboratory frame. The abuse of the symmetry may lead\nto wrong results.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks undergo substantial mass-loss by photoevaporation, a\nmechanism which is crucial to their dynamical evolution. However, the processes\nregulating the gas energetics have not been well constrained by observations so\nfar. We aim at studying the processes involved in disk photoevaporation when it\nis driven by far-UV photons. We present a unique Herschel survey and new ALMA\nobservations of four externally-illuminated photoevaporating disks (a.k.a.\nproplyds). For the analysis of these data, we developed a 1D model of the\nphotodissociation region (PDR) of a proplyd, based on the Meudon PDR code and\ncomputed the far infrared line emission. We successfully reproduce most of the\nobservations and derive key physical parameters, i.e. densities at the disk\nsurface of about $10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$ and local gas temperatures of about 1000 K.\nOur modelling suggests that all studied disks are found in a transitional\nregime resulting from the interplay between several heating and cooling\nprocesses that we identify. These differ from those dominating in classical\nPDRs, i.e. grain photo-electric effect and cooling by [OI] and [CII] FIR lines.\nThis energetic regime is associated to an equilibrium dynamical point of the\nphotoevaporation flow: the mass-loss rate is self-regulated to set the envelope\ncolumn density at a value that maintains the temperature at the disk surface\naround 1000 K. From our best-fit models, we estimate mass-loss rates - of the\norder of $10^{-7}$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$/yr - that are in agreement with earlier\nspectroscopic observation of ionised gas tracers. This holds only if we assume\nan evaporation flow launched from the disk surface at sound speed\n(supercritical regime). We have identified the energetic regime regulating\nFUV-photoevaporation in proplyds. This regime could be implemented into models\nof the dynamical evolution of protoplanetary disks.\n", "  We review the relation between four-dimensional global conformal blocks and\nfield propagation in ${\\rm AdS_5}$. Following the standard argument that\nmarginal perturbations should backreact in the geometry, we turn to the study\nof scalar fields in the generic Kerr-${\\rm AdS_5}$ geometry. On one hand, the\nresult for scattering coefficients can be obtained exactly using the\nisomonodromy technique, giving exact expressions in terms of $c=1$ chiral\nconformal blocks. On the other hand, one can use the analogy between the scalar\nfield equations to the Level 2 null field Ward identity in two dimensional\nLiouville field theory to write approximate expressions for the same\ncoefficients in terms of semi-classical chiral Liouville conformal blocks.\nSurprisingly, the conformal block thus constructed has a well-behaved\ninterpretation in terms of Liouville vertex operators.\n", "  We formulate a generalisation of the blast-wave model which is suitable for\nthe description of higher order azimuthal anisotropies of the hadron\nproduction. The model includes anisotropy in the density profile as well as an\nanisotropy in the transverse expansion velocity field. We then study how these\ntwo kinds of anisotropies influence the single-particle distributions and the\ncorrelation radii of two-particle correlation functions. Particularly we focus\non the third-order anisotropy and consideration is given to the averaging over\ndifferent orientation of the event plane.\n", "  Among all transition metals, Palladium (Pd) has the highest density of states\nat the Fermi energy yet does not fulfill the Stoner criterion for\nferromagnetism. However, its close vicinity to magnetism renders it a nearly\nferromagnetic metal, which hosts paramagnons, strongly damped spin\nfluctuations. In this letter we compare the total and the differential\nconductance of mono-atomic Pd and Cobalt (Co) contacts between Pd electrodes.\nTransport measurements reveal a conductance for Co of 1 $G_0$ , while for Pd we\nobtain 2 $G_0$. The differential conductance of mono-atomic Pd contacts shows a\ndrop with increasing bias, which gives rise to a peculiar {$\\Lambda$}-shaped\nspectrum. Supported by theoretical calculations we correlate this finding with\nthe life time of hot quasi-particles in Pd which is strongly influenced by\nparamagnon scattering. In contrast to this, Co adatoms locally induce magnetic\norder and transport through single cobalt atoms remains unaffected by\nparamagnon scattering, consistent with theory.\n", "  We calculate the quantum heat generation, the interaction force and the\nfrictional torque for two rotating spherical nanoparticles with a radius $R$.\nIn contrast to the static case, when there is an upper limit in the radiative\nheat transfer between the particles, for two rotating nanoparticles the quantum\nheat generation rate diverges when the angular velocity becomes equal to the\npoles in the photon emission rate. These poles arise for the separation $d\n<d_0= R(3/\\varepsilon''(\\omega_0))^{1/3}$ (where $\\varepsilon''(\\omega_0)$ is\nthe imaginary part of the dielectric function for the particle material at the\nsurface phonon or plasmon polariton frequency $\\omega_0$ ) due to the anomalous\nDoppler effect and the mutual polarization of the particles and they exist even\nfor the particles with losses. Similar singularities exist also for the\ninteraction force and the frictional torque. The obtained results can be\nimportant for biomedical applications.\n", "  We investigate the topological protection of surface states in Weyl and\nnodal-line semimetals by characterizing them as evanescent states when the band\nstructure is extended to complex momenta. We find in this way a sequence of\nexceptional points -that is, branch points with zero energy in the complex\nspectrum- allowing us to identify the set of surface states with complex\nmomentum signaling the decay into the 3D semimetal. From this point of view,\nWeyl and nodal-line semimetals can be classified in two types depending on the\nway surface states decay. Type A semimetals have surface states with smaller\npenetration length and oscillating decay while type B semimetals have longer\nsimple exponential decays. The difference between both types reflects in the\nway the branch cuts in the spectrum accommodate in the complex plane. The\nstability of the surface states stems in this approach from the complex\nstructure that develops around the exceptional points, with a topological\nprotection which is based on the fact that the branch cuts cannot be closed by\nsmall perturbations. We check this property when nodal-line semimetals are\nplaced under circularly polarized light, where we observe that the exceptional\npoints survive the effect of such a perturbation, though appropriate boundary\nconditions for zero-energy surface states cannot be satisfied in general due to\nthe breakdown of time-reversal invariance by the radiation field.\n", "  Production of axionlike particles (ALPs) by primordial magnetic fields may\nhave significant impacts on cosmology. We discuss the production of ALPs in the\npresence of the primordial magnetic fields. We find a region of the ALP mass\nand photon coupling which realizes the observed properties of the dark matter\nwith appropriate initial conditions for the magnetic fields. This region may be\ninteresting in light of recent indications for the 3.5 keV lines from galaxy\nclusters. For a small axion mass, a region of previously allowed parameter\nspaces is excluded by overproduction of ALPs as a hot/warm dark matter\ncomponent. Since the abundance of ALPs strongly depends on the initial\nconditions of primordial magnetic fields, our results provide implications for\nscenarios of magnetogenesis.\n", "  Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) have the potential to achieve large drag\nreduction for internal and external flow applications. However, experiments\nhave shown inconsistent results, with many studies reporting significantly\nreduced performance. Recently, it has been proposed that surfactants,\nubiquitous in flow applications, could be responsible, by creating adverse\nMarangoni stresses. Yet, testing this hypothesis is challenging. Careful\nexperiments with purified water show large interfacial stresses and,\nparadoxically, adding surfactants yields barely measurable drag increases. This\nsuggests that other physical processes, such as thermal Marangoni stresses or\ninterface deflection, could explain the lower performance. To test the\nsurfactant hypothesis, we perform the first numerical simulations of flows over\na SHS inclusive of surfactant kinetics. These simulations reveal that\nsurfactant-induced stresses are significant at extremely low concentrations,\npotentially yielding a no-slip boundary condition on the air--water interface\n(the \"plastron\") for surfactant amounts below typical environmental values.\nThese stresses decrease as the streamwise distance between plastron stagnation\npoints increases. We perform microchannel experiments with thermally-controlled\nSHSs consisting of streamwise parallel gratings, which confirm this numerical\nprediction. We introduce a new, unsteady test of surfactant effects. When we\nrapidly remove the driving pressure following a loading phase, a backflow\ndevelops at the plastron, which can only be explained by surfactant gradients\nformed in the loading phase. This demonstrates the significance of surfactants\nin deteriorating drag reduction, and thus the importance of including\nsurfactant stresses in SHS models. Our time-dependent protocol can assess the\nimpact of surfactants in SHS testing and guide future mitigating designs.\n", "  Core-level spectra of liquids can be difficult to interpret due to the\npresence of a range of local environments. We present computational methods for\ninvestigating core-level spectra based on the idea that both local structural\nparameters and the X-ray spectra behave as functions of the local atomic\nconfiguration around the absorbing site. We identify correlations between\nstructural parameters and spectral intensities in defined regions of interest,\nusing the oxygen K-edge excitation spectrum of liquid water as a test case. Our\nresults show that this kind of analysis can find the main structure-spectral\nrelationships of ice, liquid water, and supercritical water.\n", "  We chart out the phase diagram of ultracold `spin-half' bosons in a\none-dimensional optical lattice in the presence of Aubry-Andr\\'e (AA) potential\nand with spin-orbit (SO) and Raman couplings investigating the transition from\nsuperfluid (SF) to localized phases and the existence of density wave phase for\nnearest-neighbor interaction (NNI). We show that the presence of SO coupling\nand AA potential leads to a novel spin-split momentum distribution of the\nbosons in the localized phase near the boundary with the SF phase, which can\nact as a signature of such a transition. We also obtain the level statistics of\nthe bosons in the superfluid phase with finite NNI and demonstrate its change\nfrom Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as a\nfunction of the Raman coupling. We discuss experiments which can test our\ntheory.\n", "  We present a sample of $\\sim 1000$ emission line galaxies at $z=0.4-4.7$ from\nthe $\\sim0.7$deg$^2$ High-$z$ Emission Line Survey (HiZELS) in the Bo\\\"otes\nfield identified with a suite of six narrow-band filters at $\\approx 0.4-2.1$\n$\\mu$m. These galaxies have been selected on their Ly$\\alpha$ (73), {\\sc [Oii]}\n(285), H$\\beta$/{\\sc [Oiii]} (387) or H$\\alpha$ (362) emission-line, and have\nbeen classified with optical to near-infrared colours. A subsample of 98\nsources have reliable redshifts from multiple narrow-band (e.g. [O{\\sc\nii}]-H$\\alpha$) detections and/or spectroscopy. In this survey paper, we\npresent the observations, selection and catalogs of emitters. We measure number\ndensities of Ly$\\alpha$, [O{\\sc ii}], H$\\beta$/{\\sc [Oiii]} and H$\\alpha$ and\nconfirm strong luminosity evolution in star-forming galaxies from $z\\sim0.4$ to\n$\\sim 5$, in agreement with previous results. To demonstrate the usefulness of\ndual-line emitters, we use the sample of dual [O{\\sc ii}]-H$\\alpha$ emitters to\nmeasure the observed [O{\\sc ii}]/H$\\alpha$ ratio at $z=1.47$. The observed\n[O{\\sc ii}]/H$\\alpha$ ratio increases significantly from 0.40$\\pm0.01$ at\n$z=0.1$ to 0.52$\\pm0.05$ at $z=1.47$, which we attribute to either decreasing\ndust attenuation with redshift, or due to a bias in the (typically)\nfiber-measurements in the local Universe which only measure the central kpc\nregions. At the bright end, we find that both the H$\\alpha$ and Ly$\\alpha$\nnumber densities at $z\\approx2.2$ deviate significantly from a Schechter form,\nfollowing a power-law. We show that this is driven entirely by an increasing\nX-ray/AGN fraction with line-luminosity, which reaches $\\approx 100$ \\% at\nline-luminosities $L\\gtrsim3\\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$.\n", "  The Finite Difference (FD) and the Spectral Boundary Integral (SBI) methods\nhave been used extensively to model spontaneously propagating shear cracks in a\nvariety of engineering and geophysical applications. In this paper, we propose\na new modeling approach, in which these two methods are combined through\nconsistent exchange of boundary tractions and displacements. Benefiting from\nthe flexibility of FD and the efficiency of spectral boundary integral (SBI)\nmethods, the proposed hybrid scheme will solve a wide range of problems in a\ncomputationally efficient way. We demonstrate the validity of the approach\nusing two examples for dynamic rupture propagation: one in the presence of a\nlow velocity layer and the other in which off-fault plasticity is permitted. We\ndiscuss possible potential uses of the hybrid scheme in earthquake cycle\nsimulations as well as an exact absorbing boundary condition\n", "  Integrable models support elementary excitations with infinite lifetimes. In\nthe spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain these are known as spinons. We consider the\nstability of spinons when a weak integrability breaking perturbation is added\nto the Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field. We focus on the case where the\nperturbation is a next nearest neighbour exchange interaction. We calculate the\nspinon decay rate in leading order in perturbation theory using methods of\nintegrability and identify the dominant decay channels. The decay rate is found\nto be small, which indicates that spinons remain well-defined excitations even\nthough integrability is broken.\n", "  We analyze the pressure-induced metal-insulator transition in a\ntwo-dimensional vertical stack of $H_2$ molecules in x-y plane, and show that\nit represents a striking example of the Mott-Hubbard-type transition. Our\ncombined exact diagonalization approach, formulated and solved in the second\nquantization formalism, includes also simultaneous ab initio readjustment of\nthe single-particle wave functions, contained in the model microscopic\nparameters. The system is studied as a function of applied side force\n(generalized pressure), both in the $H_2$-molecular and $H$-quasiatomic states.\nExtended Hubbard model is taken at the start, together with longer-range\nelectron-electron interactions incorporated into the scheme. The stacked\nmolecular plane transforms discontinuously into a (quasi)atomic state under the\napplied force via a two-step transition: the first between molecular insulating\nphases and the second from the molecular to the quasiatomic metallic phase. No\nquasiatomic insulating phase occurs. All the transitions are accompanied by an\nabrupt changes of the bond length and the intermolecular distance (lattice\nparameter), as well as by discontinuous changes of the principal electronic\nproperties, which are characteristic of the Mott-Hubbard transition here\nassociated with the jumps of the predetermined equilibrium lattice parameter\nand the effective bond length. The phase transition can be interpreted in terms\nof the solid hydrogen metallization under pressure exerted by e.g., the\nsubstrate covered with a monomolecular $H_2$ film of the vertically stacked\nmolecules. Both the Mott and Hubbard criteria at the insulator to metal\ntransition are discussed.\n", "  The quantum channel between two particle detectors provides a prototype\nframework for the study of wireless quantum communication via relativistic\nquantum fields. In this article we calculate the classical channel capacity\nbetween two Unruh-DeWitt detectors arising from couplings within the\nperturbative regime. To this end, we identify the detector states which achieve\nmaximal signal strength. We use these results to investigate the impact of\nrelativistic effects on signaling between detectors in inertial and uniformly\naccelerated motion which communicate via a massless field in Minkowski\nspacetime.\n", "  The effect of the Strouhal number on periodic forcing of the flow over a\nbackward-facing step (height, $H$) is investigated experimentally. Forcing is\napplied by a synthetic jet at the edge of the step at Strouhal numbers ranging\nfrom $0.21<St_H<1.98$ ($St_H = f H/U_\\infty$) at a Reynolds number of $Re_H =\nHU_\\infty/\\nu = 41000$. In the literature, the effect of Strouhal number on the\nreattachment length is often divided into low- and high frequency actuation,\nreferring to different frequency modes in the unforced flow. In the present\npaper, variations with Strouhal number are explained based on entrainment\nrather than frequency modes. The reattachment length is shown to decrease\nlinearly with entrainment. Entrainment is driven by vortices generated by the\nforcing and locally entrainment is shown to be qualitatively similar to\ncirculation for all cases considered. Total circulation (and therewith\nentrainment and the effect on the reattachment length) is shown to decrease\nwith Strouhal number whereas this is not predicted by models based on frequency\nmodes. An empirical model for the (decay of) circulation is derived by tracking\nvortices in phase-locked data. This model is used to decipher relevant scaling\nparameters that explain the variations in circulation, entrainment and\nreattachment length. A low-Strouhal-number regime is observed for which\nvortices are formed at a late stage relative to the recirculation region,\ncausing a decrease in effectiveness. For high Strouhal numbers vortices are\nbeing re-ingested into the actuator or are packed so close together that they\ncancel each other, both decreasing the effectiveness of forcing. In the\nintermediate regime a vortex train is formed of which the decay of circulation\nincreases for increasing Strouhal number. The scaling of this decay fully\nexplains the observed variation in reattachment length.\n", "  We analyze the quark-mass dependence of electromagnetic properties of two and\nthree-nucleon states. To that end, we apply the pionless effective field theory\nto experimental data and numerical lattice calculations which simulate QCD at\npion masses of 450~MeV and 806~MeV.\n  At the physical pion mass, we postdict the magnetic moment of helium-3,\n$\\mu_{^3He}=-2.13~$nNM, and the magnetic polarizability of deuterium,\n$\\beta_D=7.33~10^{-2}~$fm$^3$. Magnetic polarizabilities of helium-3,\n$\\beta_{^3He}=9.7~10^{-4}~$fm$^3$, and the triton,\n$\\beta_{^3H}=8.2~10^{-4}~$fm$^3$, are predictions.\n  Postdictions of the effective theory for the magnetic moments are found\nconsistent with QCD simulations at 806~MeV pion mass while our EFT result\n$\\beta_D=2.92~10^{-2}~$fm$^3$ was not extracted from the lattice. The deuteron\nwould thus be relatively pliable compared to a three-nucleon state for which we\npostdict $\\beta_{^3H}=3.9~10^{-5}~$fm$^3$. At $m_\\pi=450~$MeV, the magnetic\nmoment of the triton is predicted, $\\mu_{^3He}=-2.15(5)~$nNM, based on a\nconjecture of its binding energy, $B_{^3H}\\cong 30$~MeV.\n  For all three pion masses, we compare the point-charge radii of the two and\nthree-nucleon bound states. The sensitivity of the electromagnetic properties\nto the Coulomb interaction between protons is studied in anticipation of\nlattice calculations with dynamical QED.\n", "  We investigate work extraction from integrable quantum systems under unitary\noperations. As a model system, we consider non-interacting fermions in one\ndimension. Thanks to its integrability, this system does not thermalize after a\nperturbation, even though it does reach a steady state which can be described\nby a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE). Such a GGE has an excess free energy\ncompared to a thermal state and we propose to extract this energy by applying\nBragg pulses. We show how all the available work in the GGE can be extracted in\nthe adiabatic limit while some excess energy is left at finite times. The\nunextracted work reaches the adiabatic limit as a power law with exponent\n$z=-2$ for small systems and with $z=-1$ in the thermodynamic limit. Two\ndistinct protocols for combining the Bragg operations are compared, and in some\nsystems an extensive difference in efficiency arises. From the unextracted work\nand the entropy production, a notion of temperature is defined and compared to\nthe Boltzmann-Gibbs temperature of the system.\n", "  We observe multi-step condensation of sodium atoms with spin $F=1$, where the\ndifferent Zeeman components $m_F=0,\\pm 1$ condense sequentially as the\ntemperature decreases. The precise sequence changes drastically depending on\nthe magnetization $m_z$ and on the quadratic Zeeman energy $q$ (QZE) in an\napplied magnetic field. For large QZE, the overall structure of the phase\ndiagram is the same as for an ideal spin 1 gas, although the precise locations\nof the phase boundaries are significantly shifted by interactions. For small\nQZE, antiferromagnetic interactions qualitatively change the phase diagram with\nrespect to the ideal case, leading for instance to condensation in $m_F=\\pm 1$,\na phenomenon that cannot occur for an ideal gas with $q>0$.\n", "  We report a polarized Raman scattering study of non-symmorphic topological\ninsulator KHgSb with hourglass-like electronic dispersion. Supported by\ntheoretical calculations, we show that the lattice of the previously assigned\nspace group $P6_3/mmc$ (No. 194) is unstable in KHgSb. While we observe one of\ntwo calculated Raman active E$_{2g}$ phonons of space group $P6_3/mmc$ at room\ntemperature, an additional A$_{1g}$ peak appears at 99.5 ~cm$^{-1}$ upon\ncooling below $T^*$ = 150 K, which suggests a lattice distortion. Several weak\npeaks associated with two-phonon excitations emerge with this lattice\ninstability. We also show that the sample is very sensitive to high temperature\nand high laser power, conditions under which it quickly decomposes, leading to\nthe formation of Sb. Our first-principles calculations indicate that space\ngroup $P6_3mc$ (No. 186), corresponding to a vertical displacement of the Sb\natoms with respect to the Hg atoms that breaks the inversion symmetry, is lower\nin energy than the presumed $P6_3/mmc$ structure and preserves the glide plane\nsymmetry necessary to the formation of hourglass fermions.\n", "  We study HI and metal-line absorption around $z\\approx2$ star-forming\ngalaxies by comparing an analysis of data from the Keck Baryonic Structure\nSurvey to mock spectra generated from the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We extract sightlines from the simulations and compare the\nproperties of the absorption by HI, CIV and SiIV around simulated and observed\ngalaxies using pixel optical depths. We mimic the resolution, pixel size, and\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the observations, as well as the distributions of\nimpact parameters and galaxy redshift errors. We find that the EAGLE reference\nmodel is in excellent agreement with the observations. In particular, the\nsimulation reproduces the high metal-line optical depths found at small\ngalactocentric distances, the optical depth enhancements out to impact\nparameters of 2 proper Mpc, and the prominent redshift-space distortions which\nwe find are due to peculiar velocities rather than redshift errors. The\nagreement is best for halo masses $\\sim10^{12.0}$ M$_\\odot$, for which the\nobserved and simulated stellar masses also agree most closely. We examine the\nmedian ion mass-weighted radial gas velocities around the galaxies, and find\nthat most of the gas is infalling, with the infall velocity depending on halo\nrather than stellar mass. From this we conclude that the observed\nredshift-space distortions are predominantly caused by infall rather than\noutflows.\n", "  We propose a theory in which the Standard Model gauge symmetry is extended by\na new $SU(2)_\\ell$ group acting nontrivially on the lepton sector which is\nspontaneously broken at the TeV scale. Under this $SU(2)_\\ell$ the ordinary\nleptons form doublets along with new lepton partner fields. This construction\nnaturally contains a dark matter candidate, the partner of the right-handed\nneutrino, stabilized by a residual global $U(1)_\\chi$ symmetry. We show that\none can explain baryogenesis through an asymmetric dark matter scenario, in\nwhich generation of related asymmetries in the dark matter and baryon sectors\nis driven by the $SU(2)_\\ell$ instantons during a first order phase transition\nin the early universe.\n", "  This paper considers electromagnetic transients of a modest total energy\n(${\\cal E} \\gtrsim 10^{40}$ erg) and small initial size (${\\cal R} \\gtrsim\n10^{-1}$ cm). They could be produced during collisions between relativistic\nfield structures (e.g. macroscopic magnetic dipoles) that formed around, or\nbefore, cosmic electroweak symmetry breaking. The outflowing energy has a\ndominant electromagnetic component; a subdominant thermal component\n(temperature $> 1$ GeV) supplies inertia in the form of residual $e^\\pm$. A\nthin shell forms that expands subluminally, attaining a Lorentz factor $\\sim\n10^{6-7}$ before decelerating. Drag is supplied by the reflection of an ambient\nmagnetic field, and by deflection of ambient free electrons. Emission of\nlow-frequency (GHz-THz) superluminal waves takes place through three channels:\ni) reflection of the ambient magnetic field; ii) direct linear conversion of\nthe embedded magnetic field into a superluminal mode; and iii) excitation\noutside the shell by corrugation of its surface. The escaping electromagnetic\npulse is very narrow (a few wavelengths) and so the width of the detected\ntransient is dominated by propagation effects. GHz radio transients are emitted\nfrom i) the dark matter halos of galaxies and ii) the near-horizon regions of\nsupermassive black holes that formed by direct gas collapse and now accrete\nslowly. Brighter and much narrower 0.01-1 THz pulses are predicted at a rate at\nleast comparable to fast radio bursts, experiencing weaker scattering and\nabsorption. The same explosions also accelerate protons up to $\\sim 10^{19}$ eV\nand heavier nuclei up to $10^{20-21}$ eV.\n", "  When colloidal particles form a crystal phase on a spherical template, their\npacking is governed by the effective interaction between them and the elastic\nstrain of bending the growing crystal. For example, if growth commences under\nappropriate conditions, and the circular crystal that forms reaches a critical\nsize, growth continues by incorporation of defects to alleviate elastic strain.\nRecently it was found experimentally that, if defect formation is somehow not\npossible, the crystal instead continues growing in ribbons that protrude from\nthe original crystal. Here we report on computer simulations in which we\nobserve both the formation of ribbons at short interaction ranges and packings\nthat incorporate defects if the interaction is longer-ranged. The ribbons only\nform above some critical crystal size, below which the nucleus is roughly\nspherically shaped. We find that the scaling of the critical crystal size\ndiffers slightly from the one proposed by the Manoharan group, and reason this\nis because the actual process is a two-step heterogeneous nucleation of ribbons\non top of roughly circular crystals.\n", "  We show how a hyperbolic surface code could be used for overhead-efficient\nquantum storage. We give numerical evidence for a noise threshold of 1.3% for\nthe {4,5}-hyperbolic surface code in a phenomenological noise model (as\ncompared to 2.9% for the toric code). In this code family parity checks are of\nweight 4 and 5 while each qubit participates in 4 different parity checks. We\nintroduce a family of semi-hyperbolic codes which interpolate between the toric\ncode and the {4,5}-hyperbolic surface code in terms of encoding rate and\nthreshold. We show how these hyperbolic codes outperform the toric code in\nterms of qubit overhead for a target logical error probability. We show how\nDehn twists and lattice code surgery can be used to read and write individual\nqubits to this quantum storage medium.\n", "  We searched for the bound state of the neutron-rich $\\Lambda$-hypernucleus\n${}^{6}_{\\Lambda}$H, using the ${}^{6}$Li($\\pi^{-}, K^{+}$)X double\ncharge-exchange reaction at a $\\pi^{-}$ beam momentum of 1.2 GeV/c at J-PARC. A\ntotal of $1.4 \\times 10^{12}$ $\\pi^{-}$ was driven onto a ${}^{6}$Li target of\n3.5-g/$\\rm cm^2$ thickness. No event was observed below the bound threshold,\ni.e., the mass of ${}^{4}_{\\Lambda}$H + 2n, in the missing-mass spectrum of the\n${}^{6}$Li($\\pi^{-}, K^{+}$)X reaction in the $2^{\\circ}$ < $\\theta_{\\pi K}$ <\n$20^{\\circ}$ angular range. Furthermore, no event was found up to 2.8 MeV/$c^2$\nabove the bound threshold. We obtained the the double-differential cross\nsection spectra of the ${}^{6}$Li($\\pi^{-}, K^{+}$)X reaction in the angular\nrange of $2^{\\circ}$ < $\\theta_{\\pi K}$ < $14^{\\circ}$. An upper limit of 0.56\nnb/sr (90% C.L.) was obtained for the production cross section of the\n${}^{6}_{\\Lambda}$H hypernucleus bound state. In addition, not only the bound\nstate region, but also the $\\Lambda$ continuum region and part of the\n$\\Sigma^{-}$ quasi-free production region of the ${}^{6}$Li($\\pi^{-}, K^{+}$)X\nreaction, were obtained with high statistics. The present missing-mass spectrum\nwill facilitate the investigation of the $\\Sigma^{-}$-nucleus optical potential\nfor $\\Sigma^{-}$-${}^{5}$He through spectrum shape analysis.\n", "  The nonclassical modification of plasmon-assisted fluorescence enhancement is\ntheoretically explored by placing two-level dipole emitters at the narrow gaps\nencountered in canonical plasmonic architectures, namely dimers and trimers of\ndifferent metallic nanoparticles. Through detailed simulations, in comparison\nwith appropriate analytical modelling, it is shown that within classical\nelectrodynamics, and for the reduced separations explored here, fluorescence\nenhancement factors of the order of $10^{5}$ can be achieved, with a divergent\nbehaviour as the particle touching regime is approached. This remarkable\nprediction is mainly governed by the dramatic increase in excitation rate\ntriggered by the corresponding field enhancement inside the gaps. Nevertheless,\nonce nonclassical corrections are included, the amplification factors decrease\nby up to two orders of magnitude and a saturation regime for narrower gaps is\nreached. These nonclassical limitations are demonstrated by simulations based\non the generalised nonlocal optical response theory, which accounts in an\nefficient way not only for nonlocal screening, but also for the enhanced Landau\ndamping near the metal surface. A simple strategy to introduce nonlocal\ncorrections to the analytic solutions is also proposed. It is therefore shown\nthat the nonlocal optical response of the metal imposes more realistic, finite\nupper bounds to the enhancement feasible with ultrasmall plasmonic cavities,\nthus providing a theoretical description closer to state of the art\nexperiments.\n", "  We present a general parallelized and easy-to-use code to perform numerical\nsimulations of structure formation using the COLA (COmoving Lagrangian\nAcceleration) method for cosmological models that exhibit scale-dependent\ngrowth at the level of first and second order Lagrangian perturbation theory.\nFor modified gravity theories we also include screening using a fast\napproximate method that covers all the main examples of screening mechanisms in\nthe literature. We test the code by comparing it to full simulations of two\npopular modified gravity models, namely $f(R)$ gravity and nDGP, and find good\nagreement in the modified gravity boost-factors relative to $\\Lambda$CDM even\nwhen using a fairly small number of COLA time steps.\n", "  We explore reshaping of nematoelastic films upon imbibing an isotropic\nsolvent under conditions when isotropic and nematic phases coexist. The\nstructure of the interphase boundary is computed taken into account the optimal\nnematic orientation governed by interaction of gradients of the nematic order\nparameter and solvent concentration. This structure determines the effective\nline tension of the boundary. We further compute equilibrium shapes of deformed\nthin sheets and cylindrical and spherical shells with the rectilinear or\ncircular shape of the boundary between nematic and isotropic domains. A\ndifferential expansion or contraction near this boundary generates a folding\npattern spreading out into the bulk of both phases. The hierarchical ordering\nof this pattern is most pronounced on a cylindrical shell.\n", "  We consider two solutions of Einstein-$\\Lambda$ theory which admit the\nextremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit, odd-dimensional multi-spinning Kerr\nblack hole (in the presence of cosmological constant) and cosmological soliton.\nWe show that the near horizon EVH geometry of Kerr has a 3d maximally symmetric\nsubspace whose curvature depends on rotational parameters and the cosmological\nconstant. In the Kerr-dS case, this subspace interpolates between AdS$_3$, 3d\nflat and dS$_3$ by varying rotational parameters, while, the near horizon of\nthe EVH cosmological soliton always has a dS$_3$. The feature of the EVH\ncosmological soliton is that it is regular everywhere on the horizon. In the\nnear EVH case, these 3d parts turn into the corresponding locally maximally\nsymmetric spacetimes with a horizon: Kerr-dS$_3$, flat space cosmology or BTZ\nblack hole. We show that their thermodynamics match with the thermodynamics of\nthe original near EVH black holes. We also briefly discuss the holographic 2d\nCFT dual to the near horizon of EVH solutions.\n", "  We present a technique to control the spatial state of a small cloud of\ninteracting particles at low temperatures with almost perfect fidelity using\nspatial adiabatic passage. To achieve this, the resonant trap energies of the\nsystem are engineered in such a way that a single, well-defined eigenstate\nconnects the initial and desired states and is isolated from the rest of the\nspectrum. We apply this procedure to the task of separating a well-defined\nnumber of particles from an initial cloud and show that it can be implemented\nin radio-frequency traps using experimentally realistic parameters.\n", "  We discuss kinetic equations involving the anomalous terms responsible for\nthe chiral anomaly. The general chiral heat wave in cold Fermi liquid is\ndescribed and the modification of the anomalous zero sound at small temperature\nand vorticity is found.\n", "  We present the tomographic cross-correlation between galaxy lensing measured\nin the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-450) with overlapping lensing measurements of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB), as detected by Planck 2015. We compare\nour joint probe measurement to the theoretical expectation for a flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, assuming the best-fitting cosmological parameters from\nthe KiDS-450 cosmic shear and Planck CMB analyses. We find that our results are\nconsistent within $1\\sigma$ with the KiDS-450 cosmology, with an amplitude\nre-scaling parameter $A_{\\rm KiDS} = 0.86 \\pm 0.19$. Adopting a Planck\ncosmology, we find our results are consistent within $2\\sigma$, with $A_{\\it\nPlanck} = 0.68 \\pm 0.15$. We show that the agreement is improved in both cases\nwhen the contamination to the signal by intrinsic galaxy alignments is\naccounted for, increasing $A$ by $\\sim 0.1$. This is the first tomographic\nanalysis of the galaxy lensing -- CMB lensing cross-correlation signal, and is\nbased on five photometric redshift bins. We use this measurement as an\nindependent validation of the multiplicative shear calibration and of the\ncalibrated source redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that\nconstraints on these two quantities are strongly correlated when obtained from\nthis technique, which should therefore not be considered as a stand-alone\ncompetitive calibration tool.\n", "  The conventional tensor-network states employ real-space product states as\nreference wave functions. Here, we propose a many-variable variational Monte\nCarlo (mVMC) method combined with tensor networks by taking advantages of both\nto study fermionic models. The variational wave function is composed of a pair\nproduct wave function operated by real space correlation factors and tensor\nnetworks. Moreover, we can apply quantum number projections, such as spin,\nmomentum and lattice symmetry projections, to recover the symmetry of the wave\nfunction to further improve the accuracy. We benchmark our method for one- and\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard models, which show significant improvement over the\nresults obtained individually either by mVMC or by tensor network. We have\napplied the present method to hole doped Hubbard model on the square lattice,\nwhich indicates the stripe charge/spin order coexisting with a weak $d$-wave\nsuperconducting order in the ground state for the doping concentration less\nthan 0.3, where the stripe oscillation period gets longer with increasing hole\nconcentration. The charge homogeneous and highly superconducting state also\nexists as a metastable excited state for the doping concentration less than\n0.25.\n", "  We propose a method for increasing purity of interacting quantum systems that\ntakes advantage of correlations present due to the internal interaction. In\nparticular we show that by using the system's quantum correlations one can\nachieve cooling beyond established limits of previous conventional algorithmic\ncooling proposals which assume no interaction.\n", "  We provide an analytic propagator for non-Hermitian dimers showing linear\ngain or losses in the quantum regime. In particular, we focus on experimentally\nfeasible realizations of the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dimer and provide their\nmean photon number and second order two-point correlation. We study the\npropagation of vacuum, single photon spatially-separable, and two-photon\nspatially-entangled states. We show that each configuration produces a\nparticular signature that might signal their possible uses as photon switches,\nsemi-classical intensity-tunable sources, or spatially entangled sources to\nmention a few possible applications.\n", "  A cyclically working quantum mechanical engine that operates at a single\ntemperature is proposed. Its energy input is delivered by a quantum\nmeasurement. The functioning of the engine does not require any feedback\ncontrol. We analyze work, heat, and the efficiency of the engine for the case\nof a working substance that is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and\nthat can be adiabatically compressed and dilated. The obtained general\nexpressions are exemplified for a spin in an adiabatically changing magnetic\nfield and a particle moving in a potential with slowly changing shape.\n", "  Superconducting qubits with in-situ tunable properties are important for\nconstructing a quantum computer. Qubit tunability, however, often comes at the\nexpense of increased noise sensitivity. Here, we propose a flux-tunable\nsuperconducting qubit that minimizes the dephasing due to magnetic flux noise\nby engineering controllable flux \"sweet spots\" at frequencies of interest. This\nis realized by using a SQUID with asymmetric Josephson junctions shunted by a\nsuperinductor formed from an array of junctions. Taking into account correlated\nglobal and local noises, it is possible to improve dephasing time by several\norders of magnitude. The proposed qubit can be used to realize fast,\nhigh-fidelity two-qubit gates in large-scale quantum processors, a key\ningredient for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n", "  The antiferromagnetic spin-one chain is considerably one of the most\nfundamental quantum many-body systems, with symmetry protected topological\norder in the ground state. Here, we present results for its dynamical spin\nstructure factor at finite temperatures, based on a combination of exact\nnumerical diagonalization, matrix-product-state calculations and quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations. Open finite chains exhibit a sub-gap band in the thermal\nspectral functions, indicative of localized edge-states. Moreover, we observe\nthe thermal activation of a distinct low-energy continuum contribution to the\nspin spectral function with an enhanced spectral weight at low momenta and its\nupper threshold. This emerging thermal spectral feature of the Haldane spin-one\nchain is shown to result from intra-band magnon scattering due to the thermal\npopulation of the single-magnon branch, which features a large bandwidth-to-gap\nratio. These findings are discussed with respect to possible future studies on\nspin-one chain compounds based on inelastic neutron scattering.\n", "  We study the algebraic and analytic structure of Feynman integrals by\nproposing an operation that maps an integral into pairs of integrals obtained\nfrom a master integrand and a corresponding master contour. This operation is a\ncoaction. It reduces to the known coaction on multiple polylogarithms, but\napplies more generally, e.g. to hypergeometric functions. The coaction also\napplies to generic one-loop Feynman integrals with any configuration of\ninternal and external masses, and in dimensional regularization. In this case,\nwe demonstrate that it can be given a diagrammatic representation purely in\nterms of operations on graphs, namely contractions and cuts of edges. The\ncoaction gives direct access to (iterated) discontinuities of Feynman integrals\nand facilitates a straightforward derivation of the differential equations they\nadmit. In particular, the differential equations for any one-loop integral are\ndetermined by the diagrammatic coaction using limited information about their\nmaximal, next-to-maximal, and next-to-next-to-maximal cuts.\n", "  We present the full results of our decade-long astrometric monitoring\nprograms targeting 31 ultracool binaries with component spectral types M7-T5.\nJoint analysis of resolved imaging from Keck Observatory and Hubble Space\nTelescope and unresolved astrometry from CFHT/WIRCam yields parallactic\ndistances for all systems, robust orbit determinations for 23 systems, and\nphotocenter orbits for 19 systems. As a result, we measure 38 precise\nindividual masses spanning 30-115 $M_{\\rm Jup}$. We determine a\nmodel-independent substellar boundary that is $\\approx$70 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ in mass\n($\\approx$L4 in spectral type), and we validate Baraffe et al. (2015)\nevolutionary model predictions for the lithium-depletion boundary (60 $M_{\\rm\nJup}$ at field ages). Assuming each binary is coeval, we test models of the\nsubstellar mass-luminosity relation and find that in the L/T transition, only\nthe Saumon & Marley (2008) \"hybrid\" models accounting for cloud clearing match\nour data. We derive a precise, mass-calibrated spectral type-effective\ntemperature relation covering 1100-2800 K. Our masses enable a novel direct\ndetermination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs spanning L4-T5 and\n30-70 $M_{\\rm Jup}$. We determine a median age of 1.3 Gyr, and our population\nsynthesis modeling indicates our sample is consistent with a constant star\nformation history modulated by dynamical heating in the Galactic disk. We\ndiscover two triple-brown-dwarf systems, the first with directly measured\nmasses and eccentricities. We examine the eccentricity distribution, carefully\nconsidering biases and completeness, and find that low-eccentricity orbits are\nsignificantly more common among ultracool binaries than solar-type binaries,\npossibly indicating the early influence of long-lived dissipative gas disks.\nOverall, this work represents a major advance in the empirical view of very\nlow-mass stars and brown dwarfs.\n", "  We discuss the source of the apparent ambiguities arising in the calculation\nof the dynamics of binary black holes within the Post-Newtonian framework.\nDivergences appear in both the near and far zone calculations, and may be of\neither ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) nature. The effective field theory\n(EFT) formalism elucidates the origin of the singularities which may introduce\napparent ambiguities. In particular, the only (physical) 'ambiguity parameters'\nthat necessitate a matching calculation correspond to unknown finite size\neffects, which first appear at fifth Post-Newtonian (5PN) order for\nnon-spinning bodies. We demonstrate that the ambiguities linked to IR\ndivergences in the near zone, that plague the recent derivations of the binding\nenergy at 4PN order, both in the ADM and 'Fokker-action' approach, can be\nresolved by implementing the so-called 'zero-bin' subtraction in the EFT\nframework. The procedure yields ambiguity-free results without the need of\nadditional information beyond the PN expansion.\n", "  We show that the correction to the gravitational binding energy for binary\nblack holes due to the tail effect resembles the Lamb shift in the Hydrogen\natom. In both cases a 'conservative' effect arises from interactions with\n'radiation' modes, and moreover an explicit cancelation between near and far\nzone divergences is at work. In addition, regularization scheme-dependence may\nintroduce ambiguity parameters. This is remediated, within an effective field\ntheory approach, by the implementation of the zero-bin subtraction. We\nillustrate the procedure explicitly for the Lamb shift, by performing an\nambiguity-free derivation within the framework of non-relativistic\nelectrodynamics. We also derive the renormalization group equations from which\nwe reproduce Bethe logarithm (at order $\\alpha_e^5 \\log \\alpha_e$), and\nlikewise the contribution to the gravitational potential from the tail effect\n(proportional to $v^8 \\log v$).\n", "  In this paper we systematically construct simply transitive homogeneous\nspacetime solutions of the three-dimensional Minimal Massive Gravity (MMG)\nmodel. In addition to those that have analogs in Topologically Massive Gravity,\nsuch as warped AdS and pp-waves, there are several solutions genuine to MMG.\nAmong them, there is a stationary Lifshitz metric with the dynamical exponent\nz=-1 and an anisotropic Lifshitz solution where all coordinates scale\ndifferently. Moreover, we identify a homogeneous Kundt type solution at the\nchiral point of the theory. We also show that in a particular limit of the\nphysical parameters in which the Cotton tensor drops out from the MMG field\nequation, homogeneous solutions exist only at the merger point in the parameter\nspace if they are not conformally flat.\n", "  Globular clusters (GCs) are amongst the oldest objects in the Galaxy and play\na pivotal role in deciphering its early history. We present the first\nspectroscopic study of the GC ESO452-SC11 using the AAOmega spectrograph at\nmedium resolution. Given the sparsity of this object and high degree of\nforeground contamination due to its location toward the bulge, few details are\nknown for this cluster: there is no consensus of its age, metallicity, or its\nassociation with the disk or bulge. We identify 5 members based on radial\nvelocity, metallicity, and position within the GC. Using spectral synthesis,\naccurate abundances of Fe and several $\\alpha$-, Fe-peak, neutron-capture\nelements (Si,Ca,Ti,Cr,Co,Ni,Sr,Eu) were measured. Two of the 5 cluster\ncandidates are likely non-members, as they have deviant Fe abundances and\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios. The mean radial velocity is 19$\\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$ with a\nlow dispersion of 2.8$\\pm$3.4 km s$^{-1}$, in line with its low mass. The mean\nFe-abundance from spectral fitting is $-0.88\\pm0.03$, with a spread driven by\nobservational errors. The $\\alpha$-elements of the GC candidates are marginally\nlower than expected for the bulge at similar metallicities. As spectra of\nhundreds of stars were collected in a 2 degree field around ESO452-SC11,\ndetailed abundances in the surrounding field were measured. Most non-members\nhave higher [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios, typical of the nearby bulge population. Stars\nwith measured Fe-peak abundances show a large scatter around Solar values,\nthough with large uncertainties. Our study provides the first systematic\nmeasurement of Sr in a Galactic bulge GC. The Eu and Sr abundances of the GC\ncandidates are consistent with a disk or bulge association. Our calculations\nplace ESO452 on an elliptical orbit in the central 3 kpc of the bulge. We find\nno evidence of extratidal stars in our data. (Abridged)\n", "  The main goal of the paper is to develop an estimate for the conditional\nprobability function of random stationary ergodic symbolic sequences with\nelements belonging to a finite alphabet. We elaborate a decomposition procedure\nfor the conditional probability function of sequences considered as the\nhigh-order Markov chains. We represent the conditional probability function as\nthe sum of multi-linear memory function monomials of different orders (from\nzero up to the chain order). This allows us to construct artificial sequences\nby method of successive iterations taking into account at each step of\niterations increasingly more high correlations among random elements. At weak\ncorrelations, the memory functions are uniquely expressed in terms of the\nhigh-order symbolic correlation functions. The proposed method fills up the gap\nbetween two approaches: the likelihood estimation and the additive Markov\nchains. The obtained results might be used for sequential approximation of\nartificial neural networks training.\n", "  We study the global symmetries of naive lattices Dirac operators in QCD-like\ntheories in any dimension larger than two. In particular we investigate how the\nchosen number of lattice sites in each direction affects the global symmetries\nof the Dirac operator. These symmetries are important since they do not only\ndetermine the infra-red spectrum of the Dirac operator but also the symmetry\nbreaking pattern and, thus, the lightest pseudo-scalar mesons. We perform the\nsymmetry analysis and discuss the possible zero modes and the degree of\ndegeneracy of the lattice Dirac operators. Moreover we explicitly identify a\n\"reduced\" lattice Dirac operator which is the naive Dirac operator apart from\nthe degeneracy. We verify our predictions by comparing Monte Carlo simulations\nof QCD-like theories in the strong coupling limit with the corresponding random\nmatrix theories.\n", "  The SgrB2 molecular cloud contains several sites forming high-mass stars.\nSgrB2(N) is one of its main centers of activity. It hosts several compact and\nUCHII regions, as well as two known hot molecular cores (SgrB2(N1) and\nSgrB2(N2)), where complex organic molecules are detected. Our goal is to use\nthe high sensitivity of ALMA to characterize the hot core population in\nSgrB2(N) and shed a new light on the star formation process. We use a complete\n3 mm spectral line survey conducted with ALMA to search for faint hot cores in\nSgrB2(N). We report the discovery of three new hot cores that we call\nSgrB2(N3), SgrB2(N4), and SgrB2(N5). The three sources are associated with\nclass II methanol masers, well known tracers of high-mass star formation, and\nSgrB2(N5) also with a UCHII region. The chemical composition of the sources and\nthe column densities are derived by modelling the whole spectra under the\nassumption of LTE. The H2 column densities are computed from ALMA and SMA\ncontinuum emission maps. The H2 column densities of these new hot cores are\nfound to be 16 up to 36 times lower than the one of the main hot core Sgr\nB2(N1). Their spectra have spectral line densities of 11 up to 31 emission\nlines per GHz, assigned to 22-25 molecules. We derive rotational temperatures\naround 140-180 K for the three new hot cores and mean source sizes of 0.4 for\nSgrB2(N3) and 1.0 for SgrB2(N4) and SgrB2(N5). SgrB2(N3) and SgrB2(N5) show\nhigh velocity wing emission in typical outflow tracers, with a bipolar\nmorphology in their integrated intensity maps suggesting the presence of an\noutflow, like in SgrB2(N1). The associations of the hot cores with class II\nmethanol masers, outflows, and/or UCHII regions tentatively suggest the\nfollowing age sequence: SgrB2(N4), SgrB2(N3), SgrB2(N5), SgrB2(N1). The status\nof SgrB2(N2) is unclear. It may contain two distinct sources, a UCHII region\nand a very young hot core.\n", "  We investigated the estimation of an unknown Gaussian process (containing\ndisplacement, squeezing and phase-shift) applied to a matter system. The state\nof the matter system is not directly measured; instead, we measure an optical\nmode which interacts with the system. We propose an interferometric setup\nexploiting a beam-splitter-type of light-matter interaction with homodyne\ndetectors and two methods of estimation. We demonstrate the superiority of the\ninterferometric setup over alternative non-interferometric schemes.\nImportantly, we show that even limited coupling strength and a noisy matter\nsystem are sufficient for very good estimation. Our work opens the way to many\nfuture investigations of light-matter interferometry for experimental platforms\nin quantum metrology of matter systems.\n", "  In this paper we present a calculation of the $\\gamma+j$ process at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD and compare the resulting\npredictions to 8 TeV CMS data. We find good agreement with the shape of the\nphoton $p_T$ spectrum, particularly after the inclusion of additional\nelectroweak corrections, but there is a tension between the overall\nnormalization of the theoretical prediction and the measurement. We use our\nresults to compute the ratio of $Z(\\to \\ell^+\\ell^-)+j$ to $\\gamma+j$ events as\na function of the vector boson transverse momentum at NNLO, a quantity that is\nused to normalize $Z(\\rightarrow\\nu\\overline{\\nu}) +j$ backgrounds in searches\nfor dark matter and supersymmetry. Our NNLO calculation significantly reduces\nthe theoretical uncertainty on this ratio, thus boosting its power for future\nsearches of new physics.\n", "  We investigate the transport properties of a junction consisting of an\nelectron-hole bilayer in contact with normal and superconducting leads. The\nelectron-hole bilayer is considered as a semi-metal with two electronic bands.\nWe assume that in the region between the contacts the system hosts an exciton\ncondensate described by a BCS-like model with a gap $\\Gamma$ in the\nquasiparticle density of states. We first discuss how the subgap electronic\ntransport through the junction is mainly governed by the interplay between two\nkinds of reflection processes at the interfaces: The standard Andreev\nreflection at the interface between the superconductor and the exciton\ncondensate, and a coherent crossed reflection at the\nsemi-metal/exciton-condensate interface that converts electrons from one layer\ninto the other. We show that the differential conductance of the junction shows\na minimum at voltages of the order of $\\Gamma/e$. Such a minimum can be seen as\na direct hallmark of the existence of the gapped excitonic state.\n", "  One of the key goals of observing neutron stars is to infer the equation of\nstate (EoS) of the cold, ultradense matter in their interiors. We present here\na Bayesian statistical method of inferring the pressures at five fixed\ndensities, from a sample of mock neutron star masses and radii. We show that\nwhile five polytropic segments are needed for maximum flexibility in the\nabsence of any prior knowledge of the EoS, regularizers are also necessary to\nensure that simple underlying EoS are not over-parametrized. For ideal data\nwith small measurement uncertainties, we show that the pressure at roughly\ntwice the nuclear saturation density, rho_sat, can be inferred to within 0.3\ndex for many realizations of potential sources of uncertainties. The pressures\nof more complicated EoS with significant phase transitions can also be inferred\nto within ~30%. We also find that marginalizing the multi-dimensional parameter\nspace of pressure to infer a mass-radius relation can lead to biases of nearly\n1 km in radius, towards larger radii. Using the full, five-dimensional\nposterior likelihoods avoids this bias.\n", "  We present a test to quantify how well some approximate methods, designed to\nreproduce the mildly non-linear evolution of perturbations, are able to\nreproduce the clustering of DM halos once the grouping of particles into halos\nis defined and kept fixed. The following methods have been considered:\nLagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) up to third order, Truncated LPT,\nAugmented LPT, MUSCLE and COLA. The test runs as follows: halos are defined by\napplying a friends-of-friends (FoF) halo finder to the output of an N-body\nsimulation. The approximate methods are then applied to the same initial\nconditions of the simulation, producing for all particles displacements from\ntheir starting position and velocities. The position and velocity of each halo\nare computed by averaging over the particles that belong to that halo,\naccording to the FoF halo finder. This procedure allows us to perform a\nwell-posed test of how clustering of the matter density and halo density fields\nare recovered, without asking to the approximate method an accurate\nreconstruction of halos. We have considered the results at $z=0,0.5,1$, and we\nhave analysed power spectrum in real and redshift space, object-by-object\ndifference in position and velocity, density Probability Distribution Function\n(PDF) and its moments, phase difference of Fourier modes. We find that higher\nLPT orders are generally able to better reproduce the clustering of halos,\nwhile little or no improvement is found for the matter density field when going\nto 2LPT and 3LPT. Augmentation provides some improvement when coupled with\n2LPT, while its effect is limited when coupled with 3LPT. Little improvement is\nbrought by MUSCLE with respect to Augmentation. The more expensive\nparticle-mesh code COLA outperforms all LPT methods [abridged]\n", "  We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based\nquenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for\nline-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the\nobserved present-day red sequence reasonably well, including its slope,\namplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by\nthe steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees\nwith observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red\nsequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*>10^10.5 Mo.\nThe most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass\nvia dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold\ninflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red\nsequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming\ngalaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We\nthen examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite\ngalaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems\nshow good agreement with observations out to z~2, despite not including a rapid\nearly quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched\ngalaxies are far too numerous at z<1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly\nover-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise\na quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and\nkeeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench\nsatellites; Mufasa's current scheme fails at the latter.\n", "  In cheminformatics, compound-target binding profiles has been a main source\nof data for research. For data repositories that only provide positive\nprofiles, a popular assumption is that unreported profiles are all negative. In\nthis paper, we caution audience not to take this assumption for granted, and\npresent empirical evidence of its ineffectiveness from a machine learning\nperspective. Our examination is based on a setting where binding profiles are\nused as features to train predictive models; we show (1) prediction performance\ndegrades when the assumption fails and (2) explicit recovery of unreported\nprofiles improves prediction performance. In particular, we propose a framework\nthat jointly recovers profiles and learns predictive model, and show it\nachieves further performance improvement. The presented study not only suggests\napplying matrix recovery methods to recover unreported profiles, but also\ninitiates a new missing feature problem which we called Learning with Positive\nand Unknown Features.\n", "  We develop a perturbation theory of quantum (and classical) master equations\nwith slowly varying parameters, applicable to systems which are externally\ncontrolled on a time scale much longer than their characteristic relaxation\ntime. We apply this technique to the analysis of finite-time isothermal\nprocesses in which, differently from quasi-static transformations, the state of\nthe system is not able to continuously relax to the equilibrium ensemble. Our\napproach allows to formally evaluate perturbations up to arbitrary order to the\nwork and heat exchange associated to an arbitrary process. Within first order\nin the perturbation expansion, we identify a general formula for the efficiency\nat maximum power of a finite-time Carnot engine. We also clarify under which\nassumptions and in which limit one can recover previous phenomenological\nresults as, for example, the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.\n", "  Power grid frequency control is a demanding task requiring expensive idle\npower plants to adapt the supply to the fluctuating demand. An alternative\napproach is controlling the demand side in such a way that certain appliances\nmodify their operation to adapt to the power availability. This is specially\nimportant to achieve a high penetration of renewable energy sources. A number\nof methods to manage the demand side have been proposed. In this work we focus\non dynamic demand control (DDC), where smart appliances can delay their\nswitchings depending on the frequency of the system. We introduce a simple\nmodel to study the effects of DDC on the frequency of the power grid. The model\nincludes the power plant equations, a stochastic model for the demand that\nreproduces, adjusting a single parameter, the statistical properties of\nfrequency fluctuations measured experimentally, and a generic DDC protocol. We\nfind that DDC can reduce small and medium size fluctuations but it can also\nincrease the probability of observing large frequency peaks due to the\nnecessity of recovering pending task. We also conclude that a deployment of DDC\naround 30-40\\% already allows a significant reduction of the fluctuations while\nkeeping the number of pending tasks low.\n", "  Extending the Proca Lagrangian of a massive complex-valued vector field by\nself-interaction potential, we construct a large class of spherically symmetric\nsolutions in flat Minkowski background as well as in the self-gravitating case.\nOur solutions encompass Proca Q-balls and Proca stars known in the literature,\nbut present new features and go beyond the limited region of parameter space\ncharted so far. A special emphasis is set to the domain of existence of the\nsolutions in relation with the coupling constants of the potential and to the\ncritical phenomena limiting this domain.\n", "  We report that special care is needed when longitudinal magnetic\nsusceptibility is computed in a magnetically ordered phase, especially in\nmetals. We demonstrate this by studying static susceptibility in both a\nferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic state in the random phase approximation\nto the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice. In contrast to the\ncase in the disordered phase, a first derivative of the chemical potential (or\nthe density) with respect to a magnetic field does not vanish in a magnetically\nordered phase when the field is applied parallel to the magnetic moment. This\neffect is crucial and should be included when computing magnetic susceptibility\nin the ordered phase, otherwise an unphysical result would be obtained. In\naddition, consequently the magnetic susceptibility becomes different when\ncomputed at a fixed density and a fixed chemical potential in the ordered\nphase. In particular, we cannot employ magnetic susceptibility at a fixed\nchemical potential to describe a system with a fixed density even if the\nchemical potential is tuned to reproduce the correct density.\n", "  The central regions of galaxies are complex environments, rich in evolved\nand/or massive stars. For galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nwith jets, the interaction of the jets with the winds of the stars within can\nlead to particle acceleration, and to extended high-energy emitting regions. We\ncompute the non-thermal emission produced by the jet flow shocked by stellar\nwinds on the jet scale, far from the jet-star direct interaction region. First,\nprescriptions for the winds of the relevant stellar populations in different\ntypes of galaxies are obtained. The scenarios adopted include galaxies with\ntheir central regions dominated by old or young stellar populations, and with\njets of different power. Then, we estimate the available energy to accelerate\nparticles in the jet shock, and compute the transport and energy evolution of\nthe accelerated electrons, plus their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission,\nin the shocked flow along the jet. A significant fraction of the jet energy,\n$\\sim 0.1-10$\\%, can potentially be available for the particles accelerated in\njet-wind shocks in the studied cases. The non-thermal particles can produce\nmost of the high-energy radiation on jet scales, far from the jet shock region.\nThis high-energy emission will be strongly enhanced in jets aligned with the\nline of sight due to Doppler boosting effects. The interaction of relativistic\njets with stellar winds may contribute significantly to the persistent\nhigh-energy emission in some AGNs with jets. However, in the particular case of\nM87, this component seems too low to explain the observed gamma-ray fluxes.\n", "  The frontier orbital sequence of individual dicyanovinyl-substituted\noligothiophene molecules is studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy.\nOn NaCl/Cu(111) the molecules are neutral and the two lowest unoccupied\nmolecular states are observed in the expected order of increasing energy. On\nNaCl/Cu(311), where the molecules are negatively charged, the sequence of two\nobserved molecular orbitals is reversed, such that the one with one more nodal\nplane appears lower in energy. These experimental results, in open\ncontradiction with a single-particle interpretation, are explained by a\nmany-body theory predicting a strongly entangled doubly charged ground state.\n", "  The temperature of interstellar dust particles is of great importance to\nastronomers. It plays a crucial role in the thermodynamics of interstellar\nclouds, because of the gas-dust collisional coupling. It is also a key\nparameter in astrochemical studies that governs the rate at which molecules\nform on dust. In 3D (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations often a simple expression\nfor the dust temperature is adopted, because of computational constraints,\nwhile astrochemical modelers tend to keep the dust temperature constant over a\nlarge range of parameter space. Our aim is to provide an easy-to-use parametric\nexpression for the dust temperature as a function of visual extinction ($A_{\\rm\nV}$) and to shed light on the critical dependencies of the dust temperature on\nthe grain composition. We obtain an expression for the dust temperature by\nsemi-analytically solving the dust thermal balance for different types of\ngrains and compare to a collection of recent observational measurements. We\nalso explore the effect of ices on the dust temperature. Our results show that\na mixed carbonaceous-silicate type dust with a high carbon volume fraction\nmatches the observations best. We find that ice formation allows the dust to be\nwarmer by up to 15% at high optical depths ($A_{\\rm V}> 20$ mag) in the\ninterstellar medium. Our parametric expression for the dust temperature is\npresented as $T_{\\rm d} = \\left[ 11 + 5.7\\times \\tanh\\bigl( 0.61 -\n\\log_{10}(A_{\\rm V})\\bigr) \\right] \\, \\chi_{\\rm uv}^{1/5.9}$, where $\\chi_{\\rm\nuv}$ is in units of the Draine (1978) UV field\n", "  Exploiting certain robust topological inputs from the skyrmion description of\ncompressed baryonic matter with a scale-chiral symmetric Lagrangian, we predict\nthe equation of state that is consistent with the properties of nuclear matter\nat the equilibrium density, supports the maximum mass of massive compact star\n$\\sim 2 M_\\odot$ and surprisingly gives the sound velocity close to the\n\"conformal velocity\" $1/\\sqrt{3}$ at densities $\\gtrsim 3 n_0$. At the core of\nthis result is the observation that parity-doubling occurs in the nucleon\nstructure as density goes above $\\sim 2n_0$ with a chiral-singlet mass $m_0\n\\sim (0.6-0.9) m_N$, hinting at a possible up-to-date unsuspected source of\nproton mass and an emergence at high density of scale symmetry and flavor local\nsymmetry, both hidden in the QCD vacuum.\n", "  We explore an extended cosmological scenario where the dark matter is an\nadmixture of cold and additional non-cold species. The mass and temperature of\nthe non-cold dark matter particles are extracted from a number of cosmological\nmeasurements. Among others, we consider tomographic weak lensing data and Milky\nWay dwarf satellite galaxy counts. We also study the potential of these\nscenarios in alleviating the existing tensions between local measurements and\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) estimates of the $S_8$ parameter, with\n$S_8=\\sigma_8\\sqrt{\\Omega_m}$, and of the Hubble constant $H_0$. In principle,\na sub-dominant, non-cold dark matter particle with a mass $m_X\\sim$~keV, could\nachieve the goals above. However, the preferred ranges for its temperature and\nits mass are different when extracted from weak lensing observations and from\nMilky Way dwarf satellite galaxy counts, since these two measurements require\nsuppressions of the matter power spectrum at different scales. Therefore,\nsolving simultaneously the CMB-weak lensing tensions and the small scale crisis\nin the standard cold dark matter picture via only one non-cold dark matter\ncomponent seems to be challenging.\n", "  We consider the possibility that supersymmetry is broken above the\ninflationary mass scale and that the only \"low\" energy remnant of supersymmetry\nis the gravitino with mass of order the EeV scale. The gravitino in this class\nof models becomes a candidate for the dark matter of the Universe. To avoid the\nover-production of gravitinos from the decays of the next-to-lightest\nsupersymmetric particle we argue that the supersymmetric spectrum must lie\nabove the inflationary mass scale ($M_{\\rm SUSY} > 10^{-5} M_{\\rm P} \\sim\n10^{13}$ GeV). Since $m_{3/2} \\simeq M_{\\rm SUSY}^2/M_{\\rm P}$, we expect\n$m_{3/2} \\gtrsim 0.2$ EeV. Cosmological constraints then predict a relatively\nlarge reheating temperature between $10^{10}$ and $10^{12}$ GeV.\n", "  Conventional microwave imaging schemes, enabled by the ubiquity of coherent\nsources and detectors, have traditionally relied on frequency bandwidth to\nretrieve range information, while using mechanical or electronic beamsteering\nto obtain cross-range information. This approach has resulted in complex and\nexpensive hardware when extended to large-scale systems requiring ultrawide\nbandwidth. Relying on bandwidth can create difficulties in calibration,\nalignment, and imaging of dispersive objects. We present an alternative\napproach using an electrically-large, dynamically reconfigurable, metasurface\nantenna that generates spatially-distinct radiation patterns as a function of\ntuning state. The metasurface antenna comprises a waveguide feeding an array of\nmetamaterial radiators, each of whose properties can be modified by applying a\nvoltage to a diode integrated into the element. By deploying two of these\napertures, one as the transmitter and one as the receiver, we realize\nsufficient spatial diversity to alleviate the dependence on frequency bandwidth\nand obtain both range and cross-range information using measurements at a\nsingle frequency. We demonstrate the method experimentally, using\none-dimensional dynamic metasurface apertures and reconstructing various\ntwo-dimensional scenes (range and cross-range). Furthermore, we modify a\nconventional microwave imaging technique---the range migration algorithm---to\nbe compatible with such configurations, resulting in an imaging system that is\nfast and simple in both software and hardware. The imaging scheme presented in\nthis paper has broad application to radio frequency imaging, including security\nscreening, through-wall imaging, biomedical diagnostics, and synthetic aperture\nradar.\n", "  We study a superconducting transmission line (TL) formed by distributed LC\noscillators and excited by external magnetic fluxes which are aroused from\nrandom magnetization (A) placed in substrate or (B) distributed at interfaces\nof a two-wire TL. Low-frequency dynamics of a random magnetic field is\ndescribed based on the diffusion Langevin equation with a short-range source\ncaused by (a) random amplitude or (b) gradient of magnetization. For a TL\nmodeled as a two-port network with open and shorted ends, the effective\nmagnetic flux at the open end has non-local dependency on noise distribution\nalong the TL. The flux-flux correlation function is evaluated and analyzed for\nthe regimes (Aa), (Ab). (Ba), and (Bb). Essential frequency dispersion takes\nplace around the inverse diffusion time of random flux along the TL. Typically,\nnoise effect increases with size faster than the area of TL. The flux-flux\ncorrelator can be verified both via the population relaxation rate of the\nqubit, which is formed by the Josephson junction shunted by the TL with flux\nnoises, and via random voltage at the open end of the TL.\n", "  The early optical afterglow emission of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) shows\na high linear polarization degree (PD) of tens of percent, suggesting an\nordered magnetic field in the emission region. The light curves are consistent\nwith being of a reverse shock (RS) origin. However, the magnetization\nparameter, $\\sigma$, of the outflow is unknown. If $\\sigma$ is too small, an\nordered field in the RS may be quickly randomized due to turbulence driven by\nvarious perturbations so that the PD may not be as high as observed. Here we\nuse the \"Athena++\" relativistic MHD code to simulate a relativistic jet with an\nordered magnetic field propagating into a clumpy ambient medium, with a focus\non how density fluctuations may distort the ordered magnetic field and reduce\nPD in the RS emission for different $\\sigma$ values. For a given density\nfluctuation, we discover a clear power-law relationship between the relative PD\nreduction and the $\\sigma$ value of the outflow. Such a relation may be applied\nto estimate $\\sigma$ of the GRB outflows using the polarization data of early\nafterglows.\n", "  Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations we show that a spin-$1/2$\nXXZ model on a two-dimensional anisotropic Kagome lattice exhibits a tripartite\nentangled plaquette state that preserves all of the Hamiltonian symmetries. It\nis connected via phase boundaries to a ferromagnet and a valence-bond solid\nthat break U(1) and lattice translation symmetries, respectively. We study the\nphase diagram of the model in detail, in particular the transitions to the\ntripartite entangled plaquette state, which are consistent with conventional\norder-disorder transitions. Our results can be interpreted as a description of\nthe charge sector dynamics of a Hubbard model applied to the description of the\nspin liquid candidate ${\\mathrm{LiZn}}_{2}{\\mathrm{Mo}}_{3}{\\mathrm{O}}_{8}$,\nas well as a model of strongly correlated bosonic atoms loaded onto highly\ntunable {\\it trimerized} optical Kagome lattices.\n", "  Quantum entanglement of the Minkowski vacuum state between left and right\nRindler wedges generates thermal behavior in the right Rindler wedge, which is\nknown as the Unruh effect. In this letter, we show that there is another\nconsequence of this entanglement, namely entanglement-induced quantum radiation\nemanating from a uniformly accelerated object. We clarify why it is in\nagreement with our intuition that incoming and outgoing energy fluxes should\ncancel each other out in a thermalized state.\n", "  Although there are so many reports on the carrier effective mass (m*) of a\ntransparent oxide semiconductor BaSnO3, it is almost impossible to know the\nintrinsic m* value because the reported m* values are scattered from 0.06 to\n3.7 m0. Here we successfully clarified the intrinsic m* of BaSnO3, m*=0.40 0.01\nm0, by the thermopower modulation clarification method. We also found the\nthreshold of degenerate/non-degenerate semiconductor of BaSnO3; At the\nthreshold, the thermopower value of both La-doped BaSnO3 and BaSnO3 TFT\nstructure was 240 microvolt k-1, bulk carrier concentration was 1.4E19 cm-3,\nand two-dimensional sheet carrier concentration was 1.8E12 cm-2. When the EF\nlocates above the parabolic shaped conduction band bottom, rather high mobility\nwas observed. On the contrary, very low carrier mobility was observed when the\nEF lays below the threshold, most likely due to that the tail states suppress\nthe carrier mobility. The present results are useful for further development of\nBaSnO3 based oxide electronics.\n", "  By measuring the substructure of a jet, one can assign it a \"quark\" or\n\"gluon\" tag. In the eikonal (double-logarithmic) limit, quark/gluon\ndiscrimination is determined solely by the color factor of the initiating\nparton (C_F versus C_A). In this paper, we confront the challenges faced when\ngoing beyond this leading-order understanding, using both parton-shower\ngenerators and first-principles calculations to assess the impact of\nhigher-order perturbative and nonperturbative physics. Working in the idealized\ncontext of electron-positron collisions, where one can define a proxy for quark\nand gluon jets based on the Lorentz structure of the production vertex, we find\na fascinating interplay between perturbative shower effects and nonperturbative\nhadronization effects. Turning to proton-proton collisions, we highlight a core\nset of measurements that would constrain current uncertainties in quark/gluon\ntagging and improve the overall modeling of jets at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  It is generally believed that when a single metallic nanowire is sufficiently\nsmall, it scatters like a point electric dipole. We show theoretically when a\nmetallic nanowire is placed inside specially designed beams, the non-negligible\nmagnetic dipole contribution along with the electric dipole resonance can lead\nto unidirectional scattering in the far-field, fulfilling Kerker's condition.\nRemarkably, this far-field unidirectional scattering encodes information that\nis highly dependent on the nanowire's deflection at a scale much smaller than\nthe wavelength. The special role of small but non-negligible magnetic response\nand plasmonic resonance are highlighted for this extreme sensitivity as\ncompared with the dielectric counterpart. Effects such as scattering efficiency\nand shape of the nanowire's cross section are also discussed.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like objects with topologically-protected\nstability which can be set into motion with an applied current. Using a\nparticle-based model we simulate current-driven magnetic skyrmions interacting\nwith random quenched disorder and examine the skyrmion velocity fluctuations\nparallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion as a function of\nincreasing drive. We show that the Magnus force contribution to skyrmion\ndynamics combined with the random pinning produces an isotropic effective\nshaking temperature. As a result, the skyrmions form a moving crystal at large\ndrives instead of the moving smectic state observed in systems with a\nnegligible Magnus force where the effective shaking temperature is anisotropic.\nWe demonstrate that spectral analysis of the velocity noise fluctuations can be\nused to identify dynamical phase transitions and to extract information about\nthe different dynamic phases, and show how the velocity noise fluctuations are\ncorrelated with changes in the skyrmion Hall angle, transport features, and\nskyrmion lattice structure.\n", "  The application of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to the analysis\nof temporal data has attracted increasing attention, due to their ability to\ndescribe complex dynamics with physically interpretable equations. In this\npaper, we introduce a non-parametric method for estimating the drift and\ndiffusion terms of SDEs from a densely observed discrete time series. The use\nof Gaussian processes as priors permits working directly in a function-space\nview and thus the inference takes place directly in this space. To cope with\nthe computational complexity that requires the use of Gaussian processes, a\nsparse Gaussian process approximation is provided. This approximation permits\nthe efficient computation of predictions for the drift and diffusion terms by\nusing a distribution over a small subset of pseudo-samples. The proposed method\nhas been validated using both simulated data and real data from economy and\npaleoclimatology. The application of the method to real data demonstrates its\nability to capture the behaviour of complex systems.\n", "  We introduce a method to determine whether a given generalised quantum\nmeasurement is isolated or it belongs to a family of measurements having the\nsame prescribed symmetry. The technique proposed reduces to solving a linear\nsystem of equations in some relevant cases. As consequence, we provide a simple\nderivation of the maximal family of Symmetric Informationally Complete\nmeasurements (SIC)-POVM in dimension 3. Furthermore, we show that the following\nremarkable geometrical structures are isolated, so that free parameters cannot\nbe introduced: (a) maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases in prime power\ndimensions from 4 to 16, (b) SIC-POVM in dimensions from 4 to 16 and (c)\ncontextuality Kochen-Specker sets in dimension 3, 4 and 6, composed of 13, 18\nand 21 vectors, respectively.\n", "  In this paper, we proposed a stochastic model which describes two species of\nparticles moving in counterflow. The model generalizes the theoretical\nframework describing the transport in random systems since particles can work\nas mobile obstacles, whereas particles of one species move in opposite\ndirection to the particles of the other species, or they can work as fixed\nobstacles remaining in their places during the time evolution. We conducted a\ndetailed study about the statistics concerning the crossing time of particles,\nas well as the effects of the lateral transitions on the time required to the\nsystem reaches a state of complete geographic separation of species. The\nspatial effects of jamming were also studied by looking into the deformation of\nthe concentration of particles in the two-dimensional corridor. Finally, we\nobserved in our study the formation of patterns of lanes which reach the steady\nstate regardless the initial conditions used for the evolution. A similar\nresult is also observed in real experiments involving charged colloids motion\nand simulations of pedestrian dynamics based on Langevin equations, when\nperiodic boundary conditions are considered (particles counterflow in a ring\nsymmetry). The results obtained through Monte Carlo numerical simulations and\nnumerical integrations are in good agreement with each other. However,\ndifferently from previous studies, the dynamics considered in this work is not\nNewton-based, and therefore, even artificial situations of self-propelled\nobjects should be studied in this first-principle modeling.\n", "  We calculate the beam function for longitudinally-polarized quarks through\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD perturbation theory. This is the\nlast missing ingredient needed to apply the factorization theorem for the\n$N$-jettiness event-shape variable in polarized collisions through the NNLO\nlevel. We present all technical details of our derivation. As a by-product of\nour calculation we provide the first independent check of the\npreviously-obtained unpolarized quark beam function. We anticipate that our\nresult will have phenomenological applications in describing data from\npolarized collisions.\n", "  We investigate the polarization selection rules of sharp zero-phonon lines\n(ZPLs) from isolated defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and compare our\nfindings with the predictions of a configuration coordinate model involving two\nelectronic states. Our survey, which spans the spectral range ~550-740 nm,\nreveals that, in disagreement with a two-level model, the absorption and\nemission dipoles are often misaligned. We relate the dipole misalignment angle\n(${\\Delta}{\\theta}$) to the ZPL Stokes shift (${\\Delta}E$) and find that\n${\\Delta}{\\theta}\\sim 0{\\deg}$ when ${\\Delta}E$ corresponds to an allowed h-BN\nphonon frequency and that $0{\\deg}\\leq{\\Delta}{\\theta}\\leq 90{\\deg}$ when\n${\\Delta}E$ exceeds the maximum allowed h-BN phonon frequency. Consequently, a\ntwo-level configuration coordinate model succeeds at describing excitations\nmediated by the creation of one optical phonon but fails at describing\nexcitations that require the creation of multiple phonons. We propose that\ndirect excitations requiring the creation of multiple phonons are inefficient\ndue to the low Huang-Rhys factors in h-BN and that these ZPLs are instead\nexcited indirectly via an intermediate electronic state. This hypothesis is\ncorroborated by polarization measurements of an individual ZPL excited with two\ndistinct wavelengths that indicate a single ZPL may be excited by multiple\nmechanisms. These findings provide new insight on the nature of the optical\ncycle of novel defect-based single photon sources in h-BN.\n", "  The salt-induced microheterogeneity (MH) formation in binary liquid mixtures\nis studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and liquid state theory.\nPrevious experiments have shown that this phenomenon occurs for antagonistic\nsalts, whose cations and anions prefer different components of the solvent\nmixture. However, so far the precise mechanism leading to the characteristic\nlength scale of MHs remained unclear. Here, it is shown that MHs can be\ngenerated by the competition of short-ranged interactions and long-ranged\nmonopole-dipole interactions. The experimental SAXS patterns can be\nquantitatively reproduced by fitting to the derived correlation functions\nwithout assuming any specific model. The dependency of the MH structure with\nrespect to ionic strength and temperature is analyzed. Close to the demixing\nphase transition, critical-like behavior occurs with respect to the spinodal\nline in the phase diagram.\n", "  We investigate the relation between the Fermi sea (FS) of zero-field carriers\nin two-dimensional systems and the FS of the corresponding composite fermions\nwhich emerge in a high magnetic field at filling $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}$, as the\nkinetic energy dispersion is varied. We study cases both with and without\nrotational symmetry, and find that there is generally no straightforward\nrelation between the geometric shapes and topologies of the two FSs. In\nparticular, we show analytically that the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) is\ncompletely insensitive to a wide range of changes to the zero-field dispersion\nwhich preserve rotational symmetry, including ones that break the zero-field FS\ninto multiple disconnected pieces. In the absence of rotational symmetry, we\nshow that the notion of `valley pseudospin' in many-valley systems is\ngenerically not transferred to the CFL, in agreement with experimental\nobservations. We also discuss how a rotationally symmetric band structure can\ninduce a reordering of the Landau levels, opening interesting possibilities of\nobserving higher-Landau-level physics in the high-field regime.\n", "  We report measurements by the T2K experiment of the parameters $\\theta_{23}$\nand $\\Delta m^{2}_{32}$ governing the disappearance of muon neutrinos and\nantineutrinos in the three flavor neutrino oscillation model. Utilizing the\nability of the experiment to run with either a mainly neutrino or a mainly\nantineutrino beam, the parameters are measured separately for neutrinos and\nantineutrinos. Using $7.482 \\times 10^{20}$ POT in neutrino running mode and\n$7.471 \\times 10^{20}$ POT in antineutrino mode, T2K obtained,\n$\\sin^{2}(\\theta_{23})=0.51^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ and $\\Delta m^{2}_{32} =\n2.53^{+0.15}_{-0.13} \\times 10^{-3}$eV$^{2}$/c$^{4}$ for neutrinos, and\n$\\sin^{2}({\\overline{\\theta}}_{23})=0.42^{+0.25}_{-0.07}$ and\n${\\Delta\\overline{m}^2}_{32} = 2.55^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \\times\n10^{-3}$eV$^{2}$/c$^{4}$ for antineutrinos (assuming normal mass ordering). No\nsignificant differences between the values of the parameters describing the\ndisappearance of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos were observed.\n", "  The Usadel equation is the standard theoretical tool for the description of\nsuperconducting structures in the diffusive limit. Here I derive the Usadel\nequation for gyrotropic materials with a generic linear in momentum spin-orbit\ncoupling. It accounts for the spin-charge/singlet-triplet coupling and in the\nnormal state reduces to the system of spin-charge diffusion equations\ndescribing various magneto-electric effects, such as the spin Hall effect\n(SHE), the spin-galvanic effect (SGE) and their inverses. Therefore the derived\nUsadel equation establishes a direct connection of these effects to their\nsuperconducting counterparts. The working power of the present formalism is\nillustrated on the example of the bulk SGE.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of the excited state of an exciton-polariton in\na semiconductor microcavity. The strong coupling of the quantum well heavy-hole\nexciton in an excited 2s state to the cavity photon is observed in non-zero\nmagnetic field due to surprisingly fast increase of Rabi energy of the 2s\nexciton-polariton in magnetic field. This effect is explained by a strong\nmodification of the wave-function of the relative electron-hole motion for the\n2s exciton state.\n", "  We analyze the connection between Bell inequality violations and symmetric\nextendibility of quantum states. We prove that 2-qubit reduced states of\nmultiqubit symmetric pure states do not violate the Bell\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. We then prove the more general\nconverse that any 2-qubit state that violates the CHSH inequality cannot have a\nsymmetric extension. We extend our analysis to qudits and provide a test for\nsymmetric extendibility of 2-qudit states. We show that if a 2-qudit Bell\ninequality is monogamous, then any 2-qudit state that violates this inequality\ndoes not have a symmetric extension. For the specific case of 2-qutrit states,\nwe use numerical evidence to conjecture that the\nCollins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality is monogamous. Hence,\nthe violation of the CGLMP inequality by any 2-qutrit state could be a\nsufficient condition for the nonexistence of its symmetric extension.\n", "  We consider the cosmological implications of a gravitational theory\ncontaining two vector fields coupled minimally to gravity as well as a\ngeneralized Chern-Simons term that couples the two vector fields. One of the\nvector fields is the usual Maxwell field, while the other is a constrained\nvector field with constant norm included in the action via a Lagrange\nmultiplier. The theory admits a de Sitter type solution, with healthy\ncosmological perturbations. We will show that there is 6 degrees of freedom\npropagate on top of de Sitter space-time, two tensor polarizations and four\ndegrees of freedom related to two massless vector fields interacting with each\nother via Chern-Simons interaction term. We also investigate in detail the\nbehavior of the geometric and physical parameters of a homogeneous and\nanisotropic Bianchi type I Universe, by using both analytical and numerical\nmethods, by assuming that the matter content of the Universe can be described\nby the stiff causal and pressureless dust fluid equations of state. The time\nevolution of the Bianchi type I Universe strongly depends on the initial\nconditions of the physical and geometrical quantities, as well as on the\nnumerical values of the model parameters. Two important observational\nparameters, the mean anisotropy parameter, and the deceleration parameter, are\nalso studied in detail, and we show that independently of the matter equation\nof state the cosmological evolution of the Bianchi type I Universe always ends\nin an isotropic and exponentially accelerating, de Sitter type, phase.\n", "  Implementation of antiferromagnetic compounds as active elements in\nspintronics has been hindered by their insensitive nature against external\nperturbations which causes difficulties in switching among different\nantiferromagnetic spin configurations. Electrically-controllable strain\ngradient can become a key parameter to tune the antiferromagnetic states of\nmultiferroic materials. We have discovered a correlation between an\nelectrically-written straight-stripe mixed-phase boundary and an in-plane\nantiferromagnetic spin axis in highly-elongated La-5%-doped BiFeO$_{3}$ thin\nfilms by performing polarization-dependent photoemission electron microscopy in\nconjunction with cluster model calculations. Model Hamiltonian calculation for\nthe single-ion anisotropy including the spin-orbit interaction has been\nperformed to figure out the physical origin of the link between the strain\ngradient present in the mixed phase area and its antiferromagnetic spin axis.\nOur findings enable estimation of the strain-gradient-induced magnetic\nanisotropy energy per Fe ion at around 5$\\times$10$^{-12}$ eV m, and provide a\nnew pathway towards an electric-field-induced 90$^{\\circ}$ rotation of\nantiferromagnetic spin axis at room temperature by flexomagnetism.\n", "  We report the theoretical investigation of the suppression of magnetic\nsystematic effects in HfF$^+$ cation for the experiment to search for the\nelectron electric dipole moment. The g-factors for $J = 1$, $F=3/2$,\n$|M_F|=3/2$ hyperfine levels of the $^3\\Delta_1$ state are calculated as\nfunctions of the external electric field. The lowest value for the difference\nbetween the g-factors of $\\Omega$-doublet levels, $\\Delta g = 3 \\times\n10^{-6}$, is attained at the electric field 7 V/cm. The body-fixed g-factor,\n$G_{\\parallel}$, was obtained both within the electronic structure calculations\nand with our fit of the experimental data from [H. Loh, K. C. Cossel, M. C.\nGrau, K.-K. Ni, E. R. Meyer, J. L. Bohn, J. Ye, and E. A. Cornell, Science {\\bf\n342}, 1220 (2013)]. For the electronic structure calculations we used a\ncombined scheme to perform correlation calculations of HfF$^+$ which includes\nboth the direct 4-component all-electron and generalized relativistic effective\ncore potential approaches. The electron correlation effects were treated using\nthe coupled cluster methods. The calculated value $G_{\\parallel}=0.0115$ agrees\nvery well with the $G_{\\parallel}=0.0118$ obtained in the our fitting\nprocedure. The calculated value $D_{\\parallel}=-1.53$ a.u. of the molecule\nframe dipole moment (with the origin in the center of mass) is in agreement\nwith the experimental value $D_{\\parallel}=-1.54(1)$ a.u. [H. Loh, Ph.D.\nthesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2006)].\n", "  We present a theoretical study of correlated atomic wires deposited on\nsubstrates in two parts. In this first part, we propose lattice models for a\none-dimensional quantum wire on a three-dimensional substrate and map them onto\neffective two-dimensional lattices using the Lanczos algorithm. We then discuss\nthe approximation of these two-dimensional lattices by narrow ladder models\nthat can be investigated with well-established methods for one-dimensional\ncorrelated quantum systems, such as the density-matrix renormalization group or\nbosonization. The validity of this approach is studied first for noninteracting\nelectrons and then for a correlated wire with a Hubbard electron-electron\nrepulsion using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. While narrow ladders cannot be\nused to represent wires on metallic substrates, they capture the physics of\nwires on insulating substrates if at least three legs are used. In the second\npart [arXiv:1704.07359], we use this approach for a detailed numerical\ninvestigation of a wire with a Hubbard-type interaction on an insulating\nsubstrate.\n", "  In the first part of our theoretical study of correlated atomic wires on\nsubstrates, we introduced lattice models for a one-dimensional quantum wire on\na three-dimensional substrate and their approximation by quasi-one-dimensional\neffective ladder models [arXiv:1704.07350]. In this second part, we apply this\napproach to the case of a correlated wire with a Hubbard-type electron-electron\nrepulsion deposited on an insulating substrate. The ground-state and spectral\nproperties are investigated numerically using the density-matrix\nrenormalization group method and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. As a function\nof the model parameters, we observe various phases with quasi-one-dimensional\nlow-energy excitations localized in the wire, namely paramagnetic Mott\ninsulators, Luttinger liquids, and spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chains. The validity\nof the effective ladder models is assessed by studying the convergence with the\nnumber of legs and comparing to the full three-dimensional model. We find that\nnarrow ladder models accurately reproduce the quasi-one-dimensional excitations\nof the full three-dimensional model but predict only qualitatively whether\nexcitations are localized around the wire or delocalized in the\nthree-dimensional substrate.\n", "  In this work we demonstrate how different semi-classical methods can be\ncombined in a novel way to reconstruct the perturbation potential of ultra\ncompact stars. Besides rather general assumptions, the only specific\ninformation entering this approach is the spectrum of the $\\textit{trapped}$\naxial quasi-normal modes. In general it is not possible to find a unique\nsolution for the potential in the inverse problem, but instead a family of\npotentials producing the same spectrum. Nevertheless, this already determines\nimportant properties of the involved potential and can be used to rule out many\ncandidate models. A unique solution was found based on the additional natural\nassumption that the exterior part ($r \\gtrsim 3\\,M$) is described by the\nRegge-Wheeler potential. This is true in general relativity for any\nnon-rotating spherically symmetric object. This technique can be potentially\napplied for the study of deviations from general relativity. The methods we\ndemonstrate are easy to implement and rather general, therefore we expect them\nalso to be interesting for other fields where inverse spectrum problems are\nstudied, e.g. quantum physics and molecular spectroscopy.\n", "  Short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) with half-lives less than 100 Myr are known\nto have existed around the time of the formation of the solar system around 4.5\nbillion years ago. Understanding the production sources for SLRs is important\nfor improving our understanding of processes taking place just after solar\nsystem formation as well as their timescales. Early solar system models rely\nheavily on calculations from nuclear theory due to a lack of experimental data\nfor the nuclear reactions taking place. In 2013, Bowers et al. measured\n${}^{36}$Cl production cross sections via the ${}^{33}$S($\\alpha$,p) reaction\nand reported cross sections that were systematically higher than predicted by\nHauser-Feshbach codes. Soon after, a paper by Peter Mohr highlighted the\nchallenges the new data would pose to current nuclear theory if verified. The\n${}^{33}$S($\\alpha$,p)${}^{36}$Cl reaction was re-measured at 5 energies\nbetween 0.78 MeV/A and 1.52 MeV/A, in the same range as measured by Bowers et\nal., and found systematically lower cross sections than originally reported,\nwith the new results in good agreement with the Hauser-Feshbach code TALYS.\nLoss of Cl carrier in chemical extraction and errors in determination of\nreaction energy ranges are both possible explanations for artificially inflated\ncross sections measured in the previous work.\n", "  One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model is the inclusion of an\nadditional scalar multiplet, and we consider scalars in the $SU(2)_L$ singlet,\ntriplet, and quartet representations. We examine models with heavy neutral\nscalars, $m_H\\sim 1-2$ TeV, and the matching of the UV complete theories to the\nlow energy effective field theory. We demonstrate the agreement of the\nkinematic distributions obtained in the singlet models for the gluon fusion of\na Higgs pair with the predictions of the effective field theory. The\nrestrictions on the extended scalar sectors due to unitarity and precision\nelectroweak measurements are summarized and lead to highly restricted regions\nof viable parameter space for the triplet and quartet models.\n", "  We investigated the anisotropic magnetic properties of CePd$_2$As$_2$ by\nmagnetic, thermal and electrical transport studies. X-ray diffraction confirmed\nthe tetragonal ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure and the high-quality of the single\ncrystals. Magnetisation and magnetic susceptibility data taken along the\ndifferent crystallographic directions evidence a huge crystalline electric\nfield (CEF) induced Ising-type magneto-crystalline anisotropy with a large\n$c$-axis moment and a small in-plane moment at low temperature. A detailed CEF\nanalysis based on the magnetic susceptibility data indicates an almost pure\n$\\langle\\pm5/2 \\rvert$ CEF ground-state doublet with the dominantly\n$\\langle\\pm3/2 \\rvert$ and the $\\langle\\pm1/2 \\rvert$ doublets at 290 K and 330\nK, respectively. At low temperature, we observe a uniaxial antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) transition at $T_N=14.7$ K with the crystallographic $c$-direction being\nthe magnetic easy-axis. The magnetic entropy gain up to $T_N$ reaches almost\n$R\\ln2$ indicating localised $4f$-electron magnetism without significant\nKondo-type interactions. Below $T_N$, the application of a magnetic field along\nthe $c$-axis induces a metamagnetic transition from the AFM to a\nfield-polarised phase at $\\mu_0H_{c0}=0.95$ T, exhibiting a text-book example\nof a spin-flip transition as anticipated for an Ising-type AFM.\n", "  Hybrid systems of cold atoms and optical cavities are promising systems for\nincreasing the stability of laser oscillators used in quantum metrology and\natomic clocks. In this paper we map out the atom-cavity dynamics in such a\nsystem and demonstrate limitations as well as robustness of the approach. We\ninvestigate the phase response of an ensemble of cold strontium-88 atoms inside\nan optical cavity for use as an error signal in laser frequency stabilization.\nWith this system we realize a regime where the high atomic phase-shift limits\nthe dynamical locking range. The limitation is caused by the cavity transfer\nfunction relating input field to output field. However, the cavity dynamics is\nshown to have only little influence on the prospects for laser stabilization\nmaking the system robust towards cavity fluctuations and ideal for the\nimprovement of future narrow linewidth lasers.\n", "  We analyze the behavior of causal geodesics on a Kerr-de Sitter spacetime\nwith particular emphasis on their completeness property. We set up an initial\nvalue problem (IVP) whose solutions lead to a global understanding of causal\ngeodesics on these spacetime. Causal geodesics that avoid the rotation axis are\ncomplete except the ones that hit the ring-like curvature singularity and those\nthat encounter the ring singularity are necessary equatorial ones. We also show\nthe existence of geodesics that cross or lie on the rotation axis. The\nequations governing the latter family show the repulsive nature of the ring\nsingularity. The results of this work show, that as far as properties of causal\ngeodesics are concerned, Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes behave in a similar manner\nas the family of Kerr spacetimes.\n", "  We present the discovery of a rapidly evolving transient by the Korean\nMicrolensing Telescope Network Supernova Program (KSP). KSP is a novel\nhigh-cadence supernova survey that offers deep ($\\sim21.5$ mag in $BVI$ bands)\nnearly continuous wide-field monitoring for the discovery of early and/or fast\noptical transients. KSP-OT-201509a, reported here, was discovered on 2015\nSeptember 27 during the KSP commissioning run in the direction of the nearby\ngalaxy NGC~300, and stayed above detection limit for $\\sim$ 22 days. We use our\n$BVI$ light-curves to constrain the ascent rate, $-3.7(7)$ mag day$^{-1}$ in\n$V$, decay time scale, $t^{V}_{2}=1.7(6)$ days, and peak absolute magnitude,\n$-9.65\\leq M_{V}\\leq -9.25$ mag. We also find evidence for a short-lived\npre-maximum halt in all bands. The peak luminosity and lightcurve evolution\nmake KSP-OT-201509a consistent with a bright, rapidly decaying nova outburst.\nWe discuss constraints on the nature of the progenitor and its environment\nusing archival HST/ACS images and conclude with a broad discussion on the\nnature of the system.\n", "  In this paper, we reanalyze the $I=0$ scalar channel with the improved\nMonte-Carlo based QCD sum rules, which combines the rigorous\nH\\\"older-inequality-determined sum rule window and a two Breit-Wigner type\nresonances parametrization for the phenomenological spectral density that\nsatisfies the the low-energy theorem for the scalar form factor. Considering\nthe uncertainties of the QCD parameters and the experimental masses and widths\nof the scalar resonances $\\sigma$ and $f_0(980)$, we obtain a prediction for\nlight quark mass $m_q(2\\,\\textrm{GeV})$ = $\\frac{1}{2}(m_u(2\\,\\textrm{GeV})$ +\n$m_d(2\\,\\textrm{GeV}))$ = $4.7^{+0.8}_{-0.7}\\,\\textrm{MeV}$, which is\nconsistent with the PDG (Particle Data Group) value and QCD sum rule\ndeterminations in the pseudoscalar channel. This agreement provides a\nconsistent framework connecting QCD sum rules and low-energy hadronic physics.\nWe also obtain the decay constants of $\\sigma$ and $f_0(980)$ at 2 GeV, which\nare approximately $0.64-0.83$ GeV and $0.40-0.48$ GeV respectively.\n", "  We address the real-time dynamics of lattice quantum spin models coupled to\nsingle or multiple Markovian dissipative reservoirs using the method of closed\nhierarchies of correlation functions. This approach allows us to solve a number\nof quantum spin models exactly in arbitrary dimensions, which is illustrated\nexplicitly with two examples of driven-dissipative systems. We investigate\ntheir respective nonequilibrium steady states as well as the full real-time\nevolution on unprecedented system sizes. Characteristic time scales are derived\nanalytically, which allows us to understand the nontrivial finite-size scaling\nof the dissipative gap. The corresponding scaling exponents are confirmed by\nsolving numerically for the full real-time evolution of two-point correlation\nfunctions.\n", "  M87, the active galaxy at the center of the Virgo cluster, is ideal for\nstudying the interaction of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a hot,\ngas-rich environment. A deep Chandra observation of M87 exhibits an\napproximately circular shock front (13 kpc radius, in projection) driven by the\nexpansion of the central cavity (filled by the SMBH with relativistic\nradio-emitting plasma) with projected radius $\\sim$1.9 kpc. We combine\nconstraints from X-ray and radio observations of M87 with a shock model to\nderive the properties of the outburst that created the 13 kpc shock. Principal\nconstraints for the model are 1) the measured Mach number ($M$$\\sim$1.2), 2)\nthe radius of the 13 kpc shock, and 3) the observed size of the central\ncavity/bubble (the radio-bright cocoon) that serves as the piston to drive the\nshock. We find an outburst of $\\sim$5$\\times$$10^{57}$ ergs that began about 12\nMyr ago and lasted $\\sim$2 Myr matches all the constraints. In this model,\n$\\sim$22% of the energy is carried by the shock as it expands. The remaining\n$\\sim$80% of the outburst energy is available to heat the core gas. More than\nhalf the total outburst energy initially goes into the enthalpy of the central\nbubble, the radio cocoon. As the buoyant bubble rises, much of its energy is\ntransferred to the ambient thermal gas. For an outburst repetition rate of\nabout 12 Myrs (the age of the outburst), 80% of the outburst energy is\nsufficient to balance the radiative cooling.\n", "  An unbiased estimator for the ellipticity of an object in a noisy image is\ngiven in terms of the image moments. Three assumptions are made: i) the pixel\nnoise is normally distributed, although with arbitrary covariance matrix, ii)\nthe image moments are taken about a fixed centre, and iii) the point-spread\nfunction is known. The relevant combinations of image moments are then jointly\nnormal and their covariance matrix can be computed. A particular estimator for\nthe ratio of the means of jointly normal variates is constructed and used to\nprovide the unbiased estimator for the ellipticity. Furthermore, an unbiased\nestimate of the covariance of the new estimator is also given.\n", "  We present a full one-loop renormalisation of the Higgs sector of the\nNext-to-Minimal- Supersymmetric-Standard-Model (NMSSM) and its implementation\nwithin SloopS, a code for the automated computations of one-loop processes in\ntheories beyond the Stan- dard Model. The present work is the sequel to the\nstudy we performed on the renor- malisation of the sectors of the NMSSM\ncomprising neutralinos, charginos and sfermions thereby completing the full\none-loop renormalisation of the NMSSM. We have investi- gated several\nrenormalisation schemes based on alternative choices (on-shell or DR) of the\nphysical parameters. Special attention is paid to the issue of the mixing\nbetween physical fields. To weigh the impact of the different renormalisation\nschemes, the partial widths for the decays of the Higgs bosons into\nsupersymmetric particles are computed at one-loop. In many decays large\ndifferences between the schemes are found. We discuss the origin of these\ndifferences. In particular we study two contrasting scenarios. The first model\nis MSSM-like with a small value for the mixing between the doublet and sin-\nglet Higgs superfields while the second model has a moderate value for this\nmixing. We critically discuss the issue of the reconstruction of the underlying\nparameters and their counterterms in the case of a theory with a large number\nof parameters, such as the NMSSM, from a set of physical parameters. In the\npresent study this set corresponds to the minimum set of masses for the\nimplementation of the on-shell schemes.\n", "  We consider a wide-aperture surface-emitting laser with a saturable absorber\nsection subjected to time-delayed feedback. We adopt the mean-field approach\nassuming a single longitudinal mode operation of the solitary VCSEL. We\ninvestigate cavity soliton dynamics under the effect of time- delayed feedback\nin a self-imaging configuration where diffraction in the external cavity is\nnegligible. Using bifurcation analysis, direct numerical simulations and\nnumerical path continuation methods, we identify the possible bifurcations and\nmap them in a plane of feedback parameters. We show that for both the\nhomogeneous and localized stationary lasing solutions in one spatial dimension\nthe time-delayed feedback induces complex spatiotemporal dynamics, in\nparticular a period doubling route to chaos, quasiperiodic oscillations and\nmultistability of the stationary solutions.\n", "  Core-clad fibers on the basis of high-purity 1300 ppmw Pr(3+)-doped\nGa-Ge-As-Se and 2000 ppmw Pr(3+) -doped In-Ge-As-Se-I glasses have been\nprepared. The minimum optical losses of the fibers are at the level of 1 dB/m\nin the wavelength range, where there is no influence of the praseodymium\nabsorption. At present, it is the best result obtained for core-clad rare-\nearth-doped chalcogenide fibers with high dopant concentration. The fibers\nexhibit the broadband luminescence in the spectral range of 3.5-5.5 micron. The\nvalues of luminescence lifetime at the wavelength of 4.7 micron are within\n6.5-8.2 ms closed to those for the bulk glasses obtained previously. Simulation\nof laser properties for these core-clad fibers in the three-level cascade\nscheme was carried out. The low level of optical losses experimentally achieved\nin these fibers is one of main criteria for development of mid-IR fiber\nsystems.\n", "  We designed and developed tapered suspended-core fibers of high-purity\nAs39Se61 glass for supercontinuum generation in the mid-IR with a standard\nfiber laser pump source at 2 ${\\mu}$m. It was shown that microstructuring\nallows shifting a zero dispersion wavelength to the range shorter than 2\n${\\mu}$m in the fiber waist with a core diameter of about 1 ${\\mu}$m. In this\ncase, supercontinuum generation in the 1-10 ${\\mu}$m range was obtained\nnumerically with 150-fs 100-pJ pump pulses at 2 ${\\mu}$m. We also performed\nexperiments on wavelength conversion of ultrashort optical pulses at 1.57\n${\\mu}$m from Er: fiber laser system in the manufactured As-Se tapered fibers.\nThe measured broadening spectra were in a good agreement with the ones\nsimulated numerically.\n", "  The gauge dependence of the conformal anomaly for spin 3/2 and spin 2 fields\nin non-conformal supergravities has been a long standing puzzle. In this Letter\nwe argue that the `correct' gauge choice is the one that follows from requiring\nall terms that would imply a violation of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition\nto be absent in the counterterm, because otherwise the usual link between the\nanomaly and the one-loop divergence becomes invalid. Remarkably, the `good'\nchoice of gauge is the one that confirms our previous result that a complete\ncancellation of conformal anomalies in D=4 can only be achieved for N-extended\n(Poincar\\'e) supergravities with $N\\geq 5$.\n", "  Thermal inflation is a second epoch of exponential expansion at typical\nenergy scales $V^{1/4} \\sim 10^{6 \\sim 8} \\mathrm{GeV}$. If the usual\nprimordial inflation is followed by thermal inflation, the primordial power\nspectrum is only modestly redshifted on large scales, but strongly suppressed\non scales smaller than the horizon size at the beginning of thermal inflation,\n$k > k_{\\rm b} = a_{\\rm b} H_{\\rm b}$. We calculate the spectral distortion of\nthe cosmic microwave background generated by the dissipation of acoustic waves\nin this context. For $k_{\\rm b} \\ll 10^3 \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, thermal inflation\nresults in a large suppression of the $\\mu$-distortion amplitude, predicting\nthat it falls well below the standard value of $\\mu \\simeq 2\\times 10^{-8}$.\nThus, future spectral distortion experiments, similar to PIXIE, can place new\nlimits on the thermal inflation scenario, constraining $k_{\\rm b} \\gtrsim 10^3\n\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ if $\\mu \\simeq 2\\times 10^{-8}$ were found.\n", "  Two-dimensional flow past an infinitely long cylinder of nanoscopic radius in\nsuperfluid He-4 at zero temperature is studied by time-dependent density\nfunctional theory. The calculations reveal two distinct critical phenomena for\nthe onset of dissipation: 1) vortex-antivortex pair shedding from the periphery\nof the moving cylinder and 2) appearance of cavitation in the wake, which\npossesses similar geometry as observed experimentally for fast moving\nmicrometer-scale particles in superfluid He-4. Vortex pairs with the same\ncirculation are occasionally emitted in the form of dimers, which constitute\nthe building blocks for the Benard-von Karman vortex street structure observed\nin classical turbulent fluids and Bose-Einstein condensates. The cavitation\ninduced dissipation mechanism should be common to all superfluids that are\nself-bound and have a finite surface tension, which include the recently\ndiscovered self-bound droplets in ultracold Bose gases.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of a feature in the spectrum of inflationary\ngravitational waves sourced by a scalar field $\\chi$ whose vacuum fluctuations\nare amplified by a rapidly time dependent mass. Unlike previous work which has\nfocused on the case in which the mass of the field $\\chi$ vanishes only for an\ninstant before becoming massive again, we study a system where the scalar field\nbecomes and remains massless through the end of inflation as the consequence of\nthe restoration of a shift symmetry. After applying appropriate constraints to\nour parameters, we find, for future CMB experiments, a small contribution to\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio which can be at most of the order $r \\sim 10^{-5}$.\nAt smaller scales probed by gravitational interferometers, on the other hand,\nthe energy density in the gravitational waves produced this way might be above\nthe projected sensitivity of LISA, $\\Omega_{GW}\\,h^2 \\sim 10^{-13}$, in a\nnarrow region of parameter space. If there is more than one $\\chi$ species,\nthen these amplitudes are enhanced by a factor equal to the number of those\nspecies.\n", "  The dense environment of galaxy clusters strongly influences the nature of\ngalaxies. Here, we study the cause of the size distribution of a sample of 560\nspectroscopic members spanning a wide dynamical range down to 10^8.5 M_sol\n(log(M)-2) in the massive CLASH cluster MACSJ 1206.2-0847 at z~0.44. We use\nSubaru SuprimeCam imaging covering the highest-density core out to the infall\nregions (3 virial radii) to look for cluster-specific effects. We also compare\nour measurements to a compatible large field study in order to span extreme\nenvironmental densities. This paper presents the trends we identified for\ncluster galaxies divided by their colors into star-forming and quiescent\ngalaxies and into distinct morphological types (using S\\'ersic index and\nbulge/disk decompositions). We observed larger sizes for early type and smaller\nsizes for massive late type galaxies in clusters in comparison to the field. We\nattribute this to longer quenching timescales of more massive galaxies in the\ncluster. Our analysis further revealed an increasing importance of recently\nquenched transition objects (\"red disks\"). This is a virialized population\nfound at higher cluster-centric radii with sizes similar to the quiescent,\nspheroid-dominated population of the cluster center, but with disks still\nin-tact. The mass-size relation of cluster galaxies may therefore be understood\nas the consequence of a mix of progenitors formed at different quenching\nepochs. We also find that galaxy sizes smoothly decreasing as a function of\nbulge fraction. At same bulge-to-total ratio and same stellar mass, quiescent\ngalaxies are smaller than star-forming galaxies. This is likely because of a\nfading of the outskirts of the disk, which we saw in comparing sizes of their\ndisk-components. Ram-pressure stripping of the cold gas and other forms of more\ngradual gas starvation are likely responsible for this observation.\n", "  We present a combined strong and weak lensing analysis of the\nJ085007.6+360428 (J0850) field, which was selected by its high projected\nconcentration of luminous red galaxies and contains the massive cluster Zwicky\n1953. Using Subaru/Suprime-Cam $BVR_{c}I_{c}i^{\\prime}z^{\\prime}$ imaging and\nMMT/Hectospec spectroscopy, we first perform a weak lensing shear analysis to\nconstrain the mass distribution in this field, including the cluster at $z =\n0.3774$ and a smaller foreground halo at $z = 0.2713$. We then add a strong\nlensing constraint from a multiply-imaged galaxy in the imaging data with a\nphotometric redshift of $z \\approx 5.03$. Unlike previous cluster-scale lens\nanalyses, our technique accounts for the full three-dimensional mass structure\nin the beam, including galaxies along the line of sight. In contrast with past\ncluster analyses that use only lensed image positions as constraints, we use\nthe full surface brightness distribution of the images. This method predicts\nthat the source galaxy crosses a lensing caustic such that one image is a\nhighly-magnified \"fold arc\", which could be used to probe the source galaxy's\nstructure at ultra-high spatial resolution ($< 30$ pc). We calculate the mass\nof the primary cluster to be $\\mathrm{M_{vir}} = 2.93_{-0.65}^{+0.71} \\times\n10^{15}~\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ with a concentration of $\\mathrm{c_{vir}} =\n3.46_{-0.59}^{+0.70}$, consistent with the mass-concentration relation of\nmassive clusters at a similar redshift. The large mass of this cluster makes\nJ0850 an excellent field for leveraging lensing magnification to search for\nhigh-redshift galaxies, competitive with and complementary to that of\nwell-studied clusters such as the HST Frontier Fields.\n", "  Using Brownian motion in periodic potentials $V(x)$ tilted by a force $f$, we\nprovide physical insight into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, a\nrecently conjectured principle for statistical errors and irreversible heat\ndissipation in nonequilibrium steady states. According to the relation,\nnonequilibrium output generated from dissipative processes necessarily incurs\nan energetic cost or heat dissipation $q$, and in order to limit the output\nfluctuation within a relative uncertainty $\\epsilon$, at least\n$2k_BT/\\epsilon^2$ of heat must be dissipated. Our model shows that this bound\nis attained not only at near-equilibrium ($f\\ll V'(x)$) but also at\nfar-from-equilibrium $(f\\gg V'(x))$, more generally when the dissipated heat is\nnormally distributed. Furthermore, the energetic cost is maximized near the\ncritical force when the barrier separating the potential wells is about to\nvanish and the fluctuation of Brownian particle is maximized. These findings\nindicate that the deviation of heat distribution from Gaussianity gives rise to\nthe inequality of the uncertainty relation, further clarifying the meaning of\nthe uncertainty relation. Our derivation of the uncertainty relation also\nrecognizes a new bound of nonequilibrium fluctuations that the variance of\ndissipated heat ($\\sigma_q^2$) increases with its mean ($\\mu_q$) and cannot be\nsmaller than $2k_BT\\mu_q$.\n", "  Multi-particle cumulants and corresponding Fourier harmonics are measured for\nazimuthal angle distributions of charged particles in $pp$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 and 13 TeV and in $p$+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02\nTeV, and compared to the results obtained for low-multiplicity Pb+Pb collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. These measurements aim to assess the collective\nnature of particle production. The measurements of multi-particle cumulants\nconfirm the evidence for collective phenomena in $p$+Pb and low-multiplicity\nPb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, the $pp$ results for four-particle\ncumulants do not demonstrate collective behaviour, indicating that they may be\nbiased by contributions from non-flow correlations. A comparison of\nmulti-particle cumulants and derived Fourier harmonics across different\ncollision systems is presented as a function of the charged-particle\nmultiplicity. For a given multiplicity, the measured Fourier harmonics are\nlargest in Pb+Pb, smaller in $p$+Pb and smallest in $pp$ collisions. The $pp$\nresults show no dependence on the collision energy, nor on the multiplicity.\n", "  Multi-Weyl semimetals are a kind of topological phase of matter with discrete\nWeyl nodes characterized by multiple monopole charges, in which the chiral\nanomaly, the anomalous nonconservation of an axial current, occurs in the\npresence of electric and magnetic fields. Electronic transport properties\nrelated to the chiral anomaly in the presence of both electromagnetic fields\nand axial electromagnetic fields in multi-Weyl semimetals are systematically\nstudied. It has been found that the anomalous Hall conductivity has a\nmodification linear in the axial vector potential from inhomogeneous strains.\nThe axial electric field leads to an axial Hall current that is proportional to\nthe distance of Weyl nodes in momentum space. This axial current may generate\nchirality accumulation of Weyl fermions through delicately engineering the\naxial electromagnetic fields even in the absence of external electromagnetic\nfields. Therefore, this work provides a nonmagnetic mechanism of generation of\nchirality accumulation in Weyl semimetals and might shed new light on the\napplication of Weyl semimetals in the emerging field of valleytronics.\n", "  Gravitational waves from the binary black hole (BH) merger GW150914 may\nenlighten our understanding of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), as\nBHs>30Msun can reach luminosities>4x10^39 erg s^-1 without exceeding their\nEddington limit. It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. We\nexpect that upcoming X-ray observatories will test these predictions, which\ntogether with additional gravitational wave detections will provide strict\nconstraints on the origin of the most massive BHs that can be produced by\nstars.\n", "  We use a numerical solution of the deterministic TDGL equations to determine\nthe response induced by a probe field in a material quenched into a\nsuperconducting state. We characterize differences in response according to\nwhether the probe is applied before, during, or after the phase stiffness has\nbuilt up to its final steady state value.\n", "  The growth of structure in the Universe is tightly correlated with the\ncosmological parameters. Galaxy clusters as tracers of the large scale\nstructure are the ideal objects to witness this evolution. The X-ray bright,\nhot gas in the potential well of a galaxy cluster enables systematic X-ray\nstudies of samples of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmological parameters.\nHIFLUGCS consists of the 64 X-ray brightest clusters in the Universe, building\nup a local sample of galaxy clusters. Here we utilize this sample to determine,\nfor the first time, individual hydrostatic mass estimates for all the clusters\nof the sample and, by making use of the completeness of the sample, we quantify\nconstraints on the two interesting cosmological parameters, OmegaM and sigma8.\nIn paper I we describe the data analysis procedure and compared the individual\nmass estimates with other references. Now we apply the total hydrostatic and\ngas mass estimates from the X-ray analysis to a Bayesian cosmological\nlikelihood analysis and leave several parameters free to be constrained. We\nfind OmegaM = 0.30+-0.01 and sigma8 = 0.79+-0.03 (statistical uncertainties,\n68% credibility level) using our default analysis strategy combining both, a\nmass function analysis and the gas mass fraction results. The main sources of\nbiases that we also correct here are (1) the influence of galaxy groups, (2)\nthe hydrostatic mass bias, (3) the extrapolation of the total mass, (4) the\ntheoretical halo mass function and (5) other physical effects. We find that\ngalaxy groups introduce a strong bias, since their number density seems to be\nover predicted by the halo mass function. On the other hand, baryonic effects\nas incorporated by recent hydrodynamical simulations do not result in a\nsignificant change in the constraints. The total systematic uncertainties (20%)\nclearly dominate the statistical uncertainties on cosmological parameters.\n", "  We present the final data release of the APEX low-redshift legacy survey for\nmolecular gas (ALLSMOG), comprising CO(2-1) emission line observations of 88\nnearby, low-mass (10^8.5<M* [M_Sun]<10^10) star-forming galaxies carried out\nwith the 230 GHz APEX-1 receiver on the APEX telescope. The main goal of\nALLSMOG is to probe the molecular gas content of more typical and lower stellar\nmass galaxies than have been studied by previous CO surveys. We also present\nIRAM 30m observations of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission lines in nine\ngalaxies aimed at increasing the M*<10^9 M_Sun sample size. In this paper we\ndescribe the observations, data reduction and analysis methods and we present\nthe final CO spectra together with archival HI 21cm line observations for the\nentire sample of 97 galaxies. At the sensitivity limit of ALLSMOG, we register\na total CO detection rate of 47%. Galaxies with higher M*, SFR, nebular\nextinction (A_V), gas-phase metallicity (O/H), and HI gas mass have\nsystematically higher CO detection rates. In particular, the parameter\naccording to which CO detections and non-detections show the strongest\nstatistical differences is the gas-phase metallicity, for any of the five\nmetallicity calibrations examined in this work. We investigate scaling\nrelations between the CO(1-0) line luminosity and galaxy-averaged properties\nusing ALLSMOG and a sub-sample of COLD GASS for a total of 185 sources that\nprobe the local main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies and its +-0.3 dex\nintrinsic scatter from M* = 10^8.5 M_Sun to M* = 10^11 M_Sun. L'_{CO(1-0)} is\nmost strongly correlated with the SFR, but the correlation with M* is closer to\nlinear and almost comparably tight. The relation between L'_{CO(1-0)} and\nmetallicity is the steepest one, although deeper CO observations of galaxies\nwith A_V<0.5 mag may reveal an as much steep correlation with A_V. [abridged]\n", "  BosonSampling is a quantum mechanical task involving Fock basis state\npreparation and detection and evolution using only linear interactions. A\nclassical algorithm for producing samples from this quantum task cannot be\nefficient unless the polynomial hierarchy of complexity classes collapses, a\nsituation believe to be highly implausible. We present method for constructing\na device which uses Fock state preparations, linear interactions and Gaussian\ncontinuous-variable measurements for which one can show exact sampling would be\nhard for a classical algorithm in the same way as Boson Sampling. The detection\nevents used from this arrangement does not allow a similar conclusion for the\nclassical hardness of approximate sampling to be drawn. We discuss the details\nof this result outlining some specific properties that approximate sampling\nhardness requires.\n", "  The ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) population is known to contain neutron\nstars, but the relative number of these compared to black hole primaries is\nunknown. Assuming classical super-critical accretion and resultant geometrical\nbeaming, we show that the observed population ratio can be predicted from the\nmean masses of each family of compact objects and the relative spatial density\nof neutron stars to black holes. Conversely - and perhaps more importantly -\ngiven even a crude estimate for the spatial densities, an estimate of the\nfraction of the population containing neutron stars will begin to constrain the\nmean mass of black holes in ULXs.\n", "  Cometary dust provides a unique window on dust growth mechanisms during the\nonset of planet formation. Measurements by the Rosetta spacecraft show that the\ndust in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has a granular structure at\nsize scales from sub-um up to several hundreds of um, indicating hierarchical\ngrowth took place across these size scales. However, these dust particles may\nhave been modified during their collection by the spacecraft instruments. Here\nwe present the results of laboratory experiments that simulate the impact of\ndust on the collection surfaces of COSIMA and MIDAS, instruments onboard the\nRosetta spacecraft. We map the size and structure of the footprints left by the\ndust particles as a function of their initial size (up to several hundred um)\nand velocity (up to 6 m/s). We find that in most collisions, only part of the\ndust particle is left on the target; velocity is the main driver of the\nappearance of these deposits. A boundary between sticking/bouncing and\nfragmentation as an outcome of the particle-target collision is found at v ~ 2\nm/s. For velocities below this value, particles either stick and leave a single\ndeposit on the target plate, or bounce, leaving a shallow footprint of\nmonomers. At velocities > 2 m/s and sizes > 80 um, particles fragment upon\ncollision, transferring up to 50 per cent of their mass in a rubble-pile-like\ndeposit on the target plate. The amount of mass transferred increases with the\nimpact velocity. The morphologies of the deposits are qualitatively similar to\nthose found by the COSIMA instrument.\n", "  We analyze magnetometry using an optically levitated nanodiamond. We consider\na configuration where a magnetic field gradient couples the mechanical\noscillation of the diamond with its spin degree of freedom provided by a\nNitrogen vacancy center. First, we investigate measurement of the position\nspectrum of the mechanical oscillator. We find that conditions of ultrahigh\nvacuum and feedback cooling allow a magnetic field gradient sensitivity of 1\n$\\mu$Tm$^{-1}$/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$. At high pressure and room temperature, this\nsensitivity degrades and can attain a value of the order of 100\n$m$Tm$^{-1}$/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$. Subsequently, we characterize the magnetic\nfield gradient sensitivity obtainable by maneuvering the spin degrees of\nfreedom using Ramsey interferometry. We find that this technique can offer\nphoton-shot noise and spin-projection noise limited magnetic field gradient\nsensitivity of 100 $\\mu$Tm$^{-1}$/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$. We conclude that this\nhybrid levitated nanomechanical magnetometer provides a favorable and versatile\nplatform for sensing applications.\n", "  We present high S/N optical spectra of 10 BL Lac objects detected at GeV\nenergies by Fermi satellite (3FGL catalog), for which previous observations\nsuggested that they are at relatively high redshift. The new observations,\nobtained at the 10 m Gran Telescopio Canarias, allowed us to find the redshift\nfor J0814.5+2943 (z = 0.703) and we can set spectroscopic lower limit for\nJ0008.0+4713 (z>1.659) and J1107.7+0222 (z>1.0735) on the basis of Mg II\nintervening absorption features. In addition we confirm the redshifts for\nJ0505.5+0416 (z=0.423) and for J1450+5200 (z>2.470). Finally we contradict the\nprevious z estimates for five objects (J0049.7+0237, J0243.5+7119,\nJ0802.0+1005, J1109.4+2411, and J2116.1+3339).\n", "  We consider the contextual fraction as a quantitative measure of\ncontextuality of empirical models, i.e. tables of probabilities of measurement\noutcomes in an experimental scenario. It provides a general way to compare the\ndegree of contextuality across measurement scenarios; it bears a precise\nrelationship to violations of Bell inequalities; its value, and a witnessing\ninequality, can be computed using linear programming; it is monotone with\nrespect to the \"free\" operations of a resource theory for contextuality; and it\nmeasures quantifiable advantages in informatic tasks, such as games and a form\nof measurement based quantum computing.\n", "  We propose a new strategy for robust high-quality self-assembly of\nnon-trivial periodic structures out of patchy particles, and investigate it\nwith Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations. Its first element is the use of\nspecific patch-patch and shell-shell interactions between the particles, that\ncan be implemented through differential functionalization of patched and shell\nregions with specific DNA strands. The other key element of our approach is the\nuse of layer-by-layer protocol that allows to avoid a formations of undesired\nrandom aggregates. As an example, we design and self-assemble in silico a\nversion of a Double Diamond (DD) lattice in which four particle types are\narranged into BCC crystal made of four FCC sub-lattices. The lattice can be\nfurther converted to Cubic Diamond (CD) by selective removal of the particles\nof certain types. Our results demonstrate that by combining the directionality,\nselectivity of interactions and the layer-by-layer protocol, a high-quality\nrobust self-assembly can be achieved.\n", "  Established x-ray diffraction methods allow for high-resolution structure\ndetermination of crystals, crystallized protein structures or even single\nmolecules. While these techniques rely on coherent scattering, incoherent\nprocesses like Compton scattering or fluorescence emission -- often the\npredominant scattering mechanisms -- are generally considered detrimental for\nimaging applications. Here we show that intensity correlations of incoherently\nscattered x-ray radiation can be used to image the full 3D structure of the\nscattering atoms with significantly higher resolution compared to conventional\ncoherent diffraction imaging and crystallography, including additional\nthree-dimensional information in Fourier space for a single sample orientation.\nWe present a number of properties of incoherent diffractive imaging that are\nconceptually superior to those of coherent methods.\n", "  The recent discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in the ladder\ncompound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ has opened a new field of research in iron-based\nsuperconductors with focus on quasi one-dimensional geometries. In this\npublication, using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group technique, we study\na two-orbital Hubbard model defined in one dimensional chains. Our main result\nis the presence of hole binding tendencies at intermediate Hubbard $U$\nrepulsion and robust Hund coupling $J_H/U=0.25$. Binding does not occur neither\nin weak coupling nor at very strong coupling. The pair-pair correlations that\nare dominant near half-filling, or of similar strength as the charge and spin\ncorrelation channels, involve hole-pair operators that are spin singlets, use\nnearest-neighbor sites, and employ different orbitals for each hole. The Hund\ncoupling strength, presence of robust magnetic moments, and antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations among them are important for the binding tendencies found here.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 870um\nobservations of 29 bright Herschel sources near high-redshift QSOs. The\nobservations confirm that 20 of the Herschel sources are submillimeter-bright\ngalaxies (SMGs) and identify 16 new SMG-QSO pairs that are useful to studies of\nthe circumgalactic medium (CGM) of SMGs. Eight out of the 20 SMGs are blends of\nmultiple 870um sources. The angular separations for six of the Herschel-QSO\npairs are less than 10\", comparable to the sizes of the Herschel beam and the\nALMA primary beam. We find that four of these six \"pairs\" are actually QSOs\nhosted by SMGs. No additional submillimeter companions are detected around\nthese QSOs and the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of the QSOs show no evidence\nof significant reddening. Black hole accretion and star formation contribute\nalmost equally in bolometric luminosity in these galaxies. The SMGs hosting\nQSOs show similar source sizes, dust surface densities, and SFR surface\ndensities as other SMGs in the sample. We find that the black holes are growing\n$\\sim$3$\\times$ faster than the galaxies when compared to the present-day\nblack-hole-galaxy mass ratio, suggesting a QSO duty cycle of $\\lesssim$30% in\nSMGs at z ~ 3. The remaining two Herschel-detected QSOs are undetected at 870um\nbut each has an SMG \"companion\" only 9\" and 12\" away (71 and 95 kpc at z = 3).\nThey could be either merging or projected pairs. If the former, they would\nrepresent a rare class of \"wet-dry\" mergers. If the latter, the QSOs would, for\nthe first time, probe the CGM of SMGs at impact parameters below 100 kpc.\n", "  Fractionalization is a hallmark of spin-liquid behavior; it typically leads\nto response functions consisting of continua instead of sharp modes. However,\nmicroscopic processes can enable the formation of short-distance bound states\nof fractionalized excitations, despite asymptotic deconfinement. Here we study\nsuch bound-state formation for the $Z_2$ spin liquid realized in Kitaev's\nhoneycomb compass model, supplemented by a kekule distortion of the lattice.\nBound states between flux pairs and Majorana fermions form in the Majorana band\ngaps. We calculate the dynamic spin susceptibility and show that bound states\nlead to sharp modes in the magnetic response of the spin liquid, with the\nmomentum dependence of the corresponding spectral weight encoding internal\nsymmetry of the bound state. As a byproduct, we also show that isolated fluxes\nmay produce Majorana bound states at exactly zero energy. Generalizations and\nimplications of the results are discussed.\n", "  We present an analysis of the height distributions of the different types of\nsupernovae (SNe) from the plane of their host galaxies. We use a well-defined\nsample of 102 nearby SNe appeared inside high-inclined (i > 85 deg),\nmorphologically non-disturbed S0-Sd host galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. For the first time, we show that in all the subsamples of spirals, the\nvertical distribution of core-collapse (CC) SNe is about twice closer to the\nplane of host disc than the distribution of SNe Ia. In Sb-Sc hosts, the\nexponential scale height of CC SNe is consistent with those of the younger\nstellar population in the Milky Way (MW) thin disc, while the scale height of\nSNe Ia is consistent with those of the old population in the MW thick disc. We\nshow that the ratio of scale lengths to scale heights of the distribution of CC\nSNe is consistent with those of the resolved young stars with ages from ~ 10\nMyr up to ~ 100 Myr in nearby edge-on galaxies and the unresolved stellar\npopulation of extragalactic thin discs. The corresponding ratio for SNe Ia is\nconsistent with the same ratios of the two populations of resolved stars with\nages from a few 100 Myr up to a few Gyr and from a few Gyr up to ~ 10 Gyr, as\nwell as with the unresolved population of the thick disc. These results can be\nexplained considering the age-scale height relation of the distribution of\nstellar population and the mean age difference between Type Ia and CC SNe\nprogenitors.\n", "  The Adam-Gibbs (AG) relation connects the dynamics of a glass-forming liquid\nto its the thermodynamics via. the configurational entropy, and is of\nfundamental importance in descriptions of glassy behaviour. The breakdown of\nthe Stokes-Einstein (SEB) relation between the diffusion coefficient and the\nviscosity (or structural relaxation times) in glass formers raises the question\nas to which dynamical quantity the AG relation describes. By performing\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we show that the AG relation is valid over the\nwidest temperature range for the diffusion coefficient and not for the\nviscosity or relaxation times. Studying relaxation times defined at a given\nwavelength, we find that SEB and the deviation from the AG relation occur below\na temperature at which the correlation length of dynamical heterogeneity equals\nthe wavelength probed.\n", "  Context. The high-angular-resolution capability of the new-generation\nground-based adaptive-optics camera SPHERE at ESO VLT allows us to assess, for\nthe very first time, the cratering record of medium-sized (D~100-200 km)\nasteroids from the ground, opening the prospect of a new era of investigation\nof the asteroid belt's collisional history. Aims. We investigate here the\ncollisional history of asteroid (6) Hebe and challenge the idea that Hebe may\nbe the parent body of ordinary H chondrites, the most common type of meteorites\nfound on Earth (~34% of the falls). Methods. We observed Hebe with SPHERE as\npart of the science verification of the instrument. Combined with earlier\nadaptive-optics images and optical light curves, we model the spin and\nthree-dimensional (3D) shape of Hebe and check the consistency of the derived\nmodel against available stellar occultations and thermal measurements. Results.\nOur 3D shape model fits the images with sub-pixel residuals and the light\ncurves to 0.02 mag. The rotation period (7.274 47 h), spin (343 deg,+47 deg),\nand volume-equivalent diameter (193 +/- 6km) are consistent with previous\ndeterminations and thermophysical modeling. Hebe's inferred density is 3.48 +/-\n0.64 g.cm-3 , in agreement with an intact interior based on its H-chondrite\ncomposition. Using the 3D shape model to derive the volume of the largest\ndepression (likely impact crater), it appears that the latter is significantly\nsmaller than the total volume of close-by S-type H-chondrite-like asteroid\nfamilies. Conclusions. Our results imply that (6) Hebe is not the most likely\nsource of H chondrites. Over the coming years, our team will collect similar\nhigh-precision shape measurements with VLT/SPHERE for ~40 asteroids covering\nthe main compositional classes, thus providing an unprecedented dataset to\ninvestigate the origin and collisional evolution of the asteroid belt.\n", "  Collisions of two fermionic dimers near the unitary limit are studied using\nexact four-particle equations for transition operators in momentum space.\nUniversal properties of dimer-dimer phase shifts and effective range expansion\n(ERE) parameters are determined. The inclusion of the fourth-order momentum\nterm in the ERE significantly extends its validity to higher collision\nenergies. The dimer-dimer scattering length and effective range are determined\nin the unitary limit as well as their corrections arising due to the finite\nrange of the two-fermion interaction. These results are of considerably higher\naccuracy as compared to previous works, but confirm most of the previous\nresults except for the lattice effective field theory calculations.\n", "  We investigate low-temperature transport through single InAs quantum wells\nand broken-gap InAs/GaSb double quantum wells. Non-local measurements in the\nregime beyond bulk pinch-off confirm the presence of edge conduction in InAs\nquantum wells. The edge resistivity of 1-2 $\\mathrm{k\\Omega/\\mu m}$ is of the\nsame order of magnitude as edge resistivities measured in the InAs/GaSb double\nquantum well system. Measurements in tilted magnetic field suggests an\nanisotropy of the conducting regions at the edges with a larger extent in the\nplane of the sample than normal to it. Finger gate samples on both material\nsystems shine light on the length dependence of the edge resistance with the\nintent to unravel the nature of edge conduction in InAs/GaSb coupled quantum\nwells.\n", "  We measure the spin-resolved transport of dipolar excitons in a biased GaAs\ndouble quantum well structure. From these measurements we extract both spin\nlifetime and mobility of the excitons. We find that below a temperature of\n$4.8$K, there is a sharp increase in the spin lifetime of the excitons,\ntogether with a sharp reduction in their mobility. Below a critical power the\nspin lifetime increases with increasing mobility and density, while above the\ncritical power the opposite trend is observed. We interpret this transition as\nan evidence of the interplay between two different spin dephasing mechanisms:\nat low mobility the dephasing is dominated by the hyperfine interaction with\nthe lattice nuclei spins, while at higher mobility the spin-orbit interaction\ndominates, and a Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation takes over. The excitation\npower and temperature regime where the hyperfine interaction induced spin\ndephasing is observed correlates with the regime where a dark dipolar quantum\nliquid was reported recently on a similar sample.\n", "  We propose to generate the multiphoton subradiant states and investigate\ntheir fluorescences in an array of two-level atoms. These multiphoton states\nare created initially from the timed-Dicke states. Then we can use either a\nZeeman or Stark field gradient pulse to imprint linearly increasing phases on\nthe atoms, and this phase-imprinting process unitarily evolves the system to\nthe multiphoton subradiant states. The fluorescence engages a long-range\ndipole-dipole interaction which originates from a system-reservoir coupling in\nthe dissipation. We locate some of the subradiant multiphoton states from the\neigenmodes, and show that an optically thick atomic array is best for the\npreparation of the state with the most reduced decay rate. This\nphase-imprinting process enables quantum state engineering of the multiphoton\nsubradiant states, and realizes a potential quantum storage of the photonic\nqubits in the two-level atoms.\n", "  The magnetic structure of the in-plane skyrmions in epitaxial MnSi/Si(111)\nthin films is probed in three dimensions by the combination of polarized\nneutron reflectometry (PNR) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). We\ndemonstrate that skyrmions exist in a region of the phase diagram above at\ntemperature of 10 K. PNR shows the skyrmions are confined to the middle of the\nfilm due to the potential well formed by the surface twists. However, SANS\nshows that there is considerable disorder within the plane indicating that the\nmagnetic structure is a 2D skyrmion glass.\n", "  We report the discovery of KELT J041621-620046, a moderately bright\n(J$\\sim$10.2) M dwarf eclipsing binary system at a distance of 39$\\pm$3 pc.\nKELT J041621-620046 was first identified as an eclipsing binary using\nobservations from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey. The\nsystem has a short orbital period of $\\sim$1.11 days and consists of components\nwith M$_1$ = $0.447^{-0.047}_{+0.052}\\,M_\\odot$ and M$_2$ =\n$0.399^{-0.042}_{+0.046}\\,M_\\odot$ in nearly circular orbits. The radii of the\ntwo stars are R$_1$ = $0.540^{-0.032}_{+0.034}\\,R_\\odot$ and R$_2$ =\n$0.453\\pm0.017\\,R_\\odot$. Full system and orbital properties were determined\n(to $\\sim$10% error) by conducting an EBOP global modeling of the high\nprecision photometric and spectroscopic observations obtained by the KELT\nFollow-up Network. Each star is larger by 17-28% and cooler by 4-10% than\npredicted by standard (non-magnetic) stellar models. Strong H$\\alpha$ emission\nindicates chromospheric activity in both stars. The observed radii and\ntemperature discrepancies for both components are more consistent with those\npredicted by empirical relations that account for convective suppression due to\nmagnetic activity.\n", "  Using trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers associated with\nmassive young stars, the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy (BeSSeL) survey has\nreported the most accurate values of the Galactic parameters so far. The\ndetermination of these parameters with high accuracy has a widespread impact on\nGalactic and extragalactic measurements. This research is aimed at establishing\nthe confidence with which such parameters can be determined. This is relevant\nfor the data published in the context of the BeSSeL survey collaboration, but\nalso for future observations, in particular from the Southern Hemisphere. In\naddition, some astrophysical properties of the masers can be constrained,\nnotably the luminosity function. We have simulated the population of\nmaser-bearing young stars associated with Galactic spiral structure, generating\nseveral samples and comparing them with the observed samples used in the BeSSeL\nsurvey. Consequently, we checked the determination of Galactic parameters for\nobservational biases introduced by the sample selection. Galactic parameters\nobtained by the BeSSeL survey do not seem to be biased by the sample selection\nused. In fact, the published error estimates appear to be conservative for most\nof the parameters. We show that future BeSSeL data and future observations with\nSouthern arrays will improve the Galactic parameters estimates and smoothly\nreduce their mutual correlation. Moreover, by modeling future parallax data\nwith larger distance and, thus, greater relative uncertainties for a larger\nnumbers of sources, we found that parallax-distance biasing is an important\nissue. Hence, using fractional parallax uncertainty in the weighting of the\nmotion data is imperative. Finally, the luminosity function for 6.7 GHz\nmethanol masers was determined, allowing us to estimate the number of Galactic\nmethanol masers.\n", "  We present the detection of a large population of ultra diffuse galaxies\n(UDGs) in two massive galaxy clusters, Abell S1063 at $z=0.348$ and Abell 2744\nat $z=0.308$, based on F814W and F105W images in the Hubble Frontier Fields\nProgram. We find 47 and 40 UDGs in Abell S1063 and Abell 2744, respectively.\nColor-magnitude diagrams of the UDGs show that they are mostly located at the\nfaint end of the red sequence. From the comparison with simple stellar\npopulation models, we estimate their stellar mass to range from $10^8$ to $10^9\nM_\\odot$. Radial number density profiles of the UDGs show a turnover or a\nflattening in the central region at $r<100$ kpc. We estimate the total masses\nof the UDGs using the galaxy scaling relations. A majority of the UDGs have\ntotal masses, $M_{200} = 10^{10}$ to $10^{11}~M_\\odot$, and only a few of them\nhave total masses, $M_{200} = 10^{11}$ to $10^{12}~M_\\odot$. The total number\nof UDGs within the virial radius is estimated to be N(UDG)$=770\\pm114$ for\nAbell S1063, and N(UDG)$=814\\pm122$ for Abell 2744. Combining these results\nwith data in the literature, we fit the relation between the total numbers of\nUDGs and the masses of their host systems for $M_{200}>10^{13} M_\\odot$ with a\npower law, N(UDG) $= M_{200}^{1.05\\pm0.09}$. These results suggest that a\nmajority of the UDGs have a dwarf galaxy origin, while only a small number of\nthe UDGs are massive $L_*$ galaxies that failed to form a normal population of\nstars.\n", "  Simulations are expected to be the powerful tool to investigate the baryon\neffects on dark matter (DM) halos. Recent high resolution, cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations (\\citealt{Cintio14}, DC14) predict that the inner\ndensity profiles of DM halos depend systematically on the ratio of stellar to\nDM mass ($M_{\\ast}/M_{\\rm halo}$) which is thought to be able to provide good\nfits to the observed rotation curves of galaxies. The DC14 profile is fitted\nfrom the simulations which are confined to $M_{\\rm halo}\\le 10^{12}M_{\\sun}$,\nin order to investigate the physical processes that may affect all halos, we\nextrapolate it to much larger halo mass, including that of galaxy clusters. The\ninner slope of DC14 profile is flat for low halo mass, it approaches 1 when the\nhalo mass increases towards $10^{12}M_{\\sun}$ and decreases rapidly after that\nmass. We use DC14 profile for lenses and find that it predicts too few lenses\ncompared with the most recent strong lensing observations SQLS\n(\\citealt{Inada12}). We also calculate the strong lensing probabilities for a\nsimulated density profile which continues the halo mass from the mass end of\nDC14 ($\\sim 10^{12}M_{\\sun}$) to the mass that covers the galaxy clusters\n(\\citealt{Schaller15}, Schaller15), and find that this Schaller15 model predict\ntoo many lenses compared with other models and SQLS observations.\nInterestingly, Schaller15 profile has no core, however, like DC14, the rotation\ncurves of the simulated halos are in excellent agreement with observational\ndata. Furthermore, we show that the standard two-population model SIS+NFW\ncannot match the most recent SQLS observations for large image separations.\n", "  We review the presence and signatures of the non-equilibrium processes, both\nnon-Maxwellian distributions and non-equilibrium ionization, in the solar\ntransition region, corona, solar wind, and flares. Basic properties of the\nnon-Maxwellian distributions are described together with their influence on the\nheat flux as well as on the rates of individual collisional processes and the\nresulting optically thin synthetic spectra. Constraints on the presence of\nhigh-energy electrons from observations are reviewed, including positive\ndetection of non-Maxwellian distributions in the solar corona, transition\nregion, flares, and wind. Occurrence of non-equilibrium ionization is reviewed\nas well, especially in connection to hydrodynamic and generalized\ncollisional-radiative modelling. Predicted spectroscopic signatures of\nnon-equilibrium ionization depending on the assumed plasma conditions are\nsummarized. Finally, we discuss the future remote-sensing instrumentation that\ncan be used for detection of these non-equilibrium phenomena in various\nspectral ranges.\n", "  We report new dynamical masses for 5 pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in the\nL1495 region of the Taurus star-forming region (SFR) and 6 in the L1688 region\nof the Ophiuchus SFR. Since these regions have VLBA parallaxes these are\nabsolute measurements of the stars' masses and are independent of their\neffective temperatures and luminosities. Seven of the stars have masses $<0.6$\nsolar masses, thus providing data in a mass range with little data, and of\nthese, 6 are measured to precision $< 5 \\%$. We find 8 stars with masses in the\nrange 0.09 to 1.1 solar mass that agree well with the current generation of PMS\nevolutionary models. The ages of the stars we measured in the Taurus SFR are in\nthe range 1-3 MY, and $<1$ MY for those in L1688. We also measured the\ndynamical masses of 14 stars in the ALMA archival data for Akeson~\\&~Jensen's\nCycle 0 project on binaries in the Taurus SFR. We find that the masses of 7 of\nthe targets are so large that they cannot be reconciled with reported values of\ntheir luminosity and effective temperature. We suggest that these targets are\nthemselves binaries or triples.\n", "  A search for direct top squark pair production resulting in events with\neither a same-flavour opposite-sign dilepton pair with invariant mass\ncompatible with a $Z$ boson or a pair of jets compatible with a Standard Model\n(SM) Higgs boson ($h$) is presented. Requirements on additional leptons, jets,\njets identified as originating from $b$-quarks, and missing transverse momentum\nare imposed to target the other decay products of the top squark pair. The\nanalysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV\ncollected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015--2016, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$. No excess is observed in the data with\nrespect to the SM predictions. The results are interpreted in two sets of\nmodels. In the first set, direct production of pairs of lighter top squarks\n($\\tilde{t}_1$) with long decay chains involving $Z$ or Higgs bosons is\nconsidered. The second set includes direct pair production of the heavier top\nsquark pairs ($\\tilde{t}_2$) decaying via $\\tilde{t}_2 \\rightarrow Z\n\\tilde{t}_1 $ or $\\tilde{t}_2 \\rightarrow h \\tilde{t}_1$. The results exclude\nat 95\\% confidence level $\\tilde{t}_2$ and $\\tilde{t}_1$ masses up to about 800\nGeV, extending the exclusion region of supersymmetric parameter space covered\nby previous LHC searches.\n", "  We study the entanglement between two identical two-level atoms located near\nan ideal model of invisibility cloaks, by monitoring the the time evolution of\nthe concurrence measure. We obtain the reduced density operator of the atomic\nsubsystem based on a canonical quantization scheme presented for the\nelectromagnetic field interacting with atomic systems in the presence of an\nanisotropic, inhomogeneous and absorbing magnetodielectric medium. It is shown\nthat two atoms, which are prepared initially in an unentangled state, are\ncorrelated in weak coupling regime via the spontaneous emission and the\ndipole-dipole interaction of two atoms mediated by the invisibility cloak. We\ntherefore find that the invisibility cloak, independent of the hidden object,\nworks fairly well at frequencies far from the resonance frequency of the object\nand the cloak, whereas near the resonance frequency, the hidden object becoming\ndetectable due to a sharp reduction of the concurrence.\n", "  We report the discovery of 11 very faint (r< 23), low surface brightness\n({\\mu}_r< 27 mag/arcsec^2) dwarf galaxies in one deep field in the Virgo\ncluster, obtained by the prime focus cameras (LBC) at the Large Binocular\nTelescope (LBT). These extend our previous sample to reach a total number of 27\ngalaxies in a field of just of 0.17 deg^2 located at a median distance of 390\nkpc from the cluster center. Their association with the Virgo cluster is\nsupported by their separate position in the central surface brightness - total\nmagnitude plane with respect to the background galaxies of similar total\nmagnitude. For a significant fraction (26\\%) of the sample the association to\nthe cluster is confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up. We show that the mere\nabundance of satellite galaxies corresponding to our observed number in the\ntarget field provides extremely tight constraints on Dark Matter models with\nsuppressed power spectrum compared to the Cold Dark Matter case, independently\nof the galaxy luminosity distribution. In particular, requiring the observed\nnumber of satellite galaxies not to exceed the predicted abundance of Dark\nMatter sub-halos yields a limit m_X >3 keV at 1-{\\sigma} and m_X > 2.3 keV at\n2-{\\sigma} confidence level for the mass of thermal Warm Dark Matter particles.\nSuch a limit is competitive with other limits set by the abundance of\nultra-faint satellite galaxies in the Milky Way, is completely independent of\nbaryon physics involved in galaxy formation, and has the potentiality for\nappreciable improvements with next observations. We extend our analysis to Dark\nMatter models based on sterile neutrinos, showing that our observations set\ntight constraints on the combination of sterile neutrino mass m_{\\nu} and\nmixing parameter sin^2(2{\\theta}). We discuss the robustness of our results\nwith respect to systematics.\n", "  The rotation of octahedra (octahedral tilting) is common in ABO3 perovskites\nand relevant to many physical phenomena, ranging from electronic and magnetic\nproperties, metal-insulator transitions to improper ferroelectricity.\nHydrostatic pressure is an efficient way to tune and control octahedral\ntiltings. However, the pressure behavior of such tiltings can dramatically\ndiffer from one material to another, with the origins of such differences\nremaining controversial. In this work, we discover several new mechanisms and\nformulate a set of simple rules that allow to understand how pressure affects\noxygen octahedral tiltings, via the use and analysis of first-principles\nresults for a variety of compounds. Besides the known A-O interactions, we\nreveal that the interactions between specific B-ions and oxygen ions contribute\nto the tilting instability. We explain the previously reported trend that the\nderivative of the oxygen octahedral tilting with respect to pressure (dR/dP)\nusually decreases with both the tolerance factor and the ionization state of\nthe A-ion, by illustrating the key role of A-O interactions and their change\nunder pressure. Furthermore, three new mechanisms/rules are discovered. We\nfurther predict that the polarization associated with the so-called hybrid\nimproper ferroelectricity could be manipulated by hydrostatic pressure, by\nindirectly controlling the amplitude of octahedral rotations.\n", "  This writeup is a review of current hot topics on solar neutrinos. It is\nbased on a talk at the conference \"Neutrinos: the quest for a new physics\nscale\", held at the CERN on March 2017, where the Organizers entrusted me with\na discussion of the provocative question \"whether solar neutrino physics is\nover\". Rather than providing a straight (negative) answer, in view of an\naudience consisting mostly of colleagues working in theoretical particle\nphysics, I deemed it more useful providing a description of what is the current\nactivity of the physicists working in solar neutrinos, leaving the listener\nfree of forming his/her own opinion apropos.\n", "  The magnetic fields of the quiet Sun cover at any time more than 90\\% of its\nsurface and their magnetic energy budget is crucial to explain the thermal\nstructure of the solar atmosphere. One of the possible origins of these fields\nis due to the action of local dynamo in the upper convection zone of the Sun.\nExisting simulations of the local solar dynamo require an initial seed field,\nand sufficiently high spatial resolution, in order to achieve the amplification\nof the seed field to the observed values in the quiet Sun. Here we report an\nalternative model of seeding based on the action of the Bierman battery effect.\nThis effect generates a magnetic field due to the local imbalances in electron\npressure in the partially ionized solar plasma. We show that the battery effect\nself-consistently creates from zero an initial seed field of a strength of the\norder of micro G, and together with dynamo amplification, allows the generation\nof quiet Sun magnetic fields of a similar strength to those from solar\nobservations.\n", "  We present a timing analysis of the 2015 outburst of the accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, using non-simultaneous XMM-Newton\nand NuStar observations. We estimate the pulsar spin frequency and update the\nsystem orbital solution. Combining the average spin frequency from the previous\nobserved, we confirm the long-term spin down at an average rate\n$\\dot{\\nu}_{\\text{SD}}=1.5(2)\\times 10^{-15}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. We also discuss\npossible corrections to the spin down rate accounting for mass accretion onto\nthe compact object when the system is X-ray active. Finally, combining the\nupdated ephemerides with those of the previous outbursts, we find a long-term\norbital evolution compatible with a binary expansion at a mean rate\n$\\dot{P}_{orb}=3.6(4)\\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$, in agreement with previously\nreported values. This fast evolution is incompatible with an evolution driven\nby angular momentum losses caused by gravitational radiation under the\nhypothesis of conservative mass transfer. We discuss the observed orbital\nexpansion in terms of non-conservative mass transfer and gravitational\nquadrupole coupling mechanism. We find that the latter can explain, under\ncertain conditions, small fluctuations (of the order of few seconds) of the\norbital period around a global parabolic trend. At the same time, a\nnon-conservative mass transfer is required to explain the observed fast orbital\nevolution, which likely reflects ejection of a large fraction of mass from the\ninner Lagrangian point caused by the irradiation of the donor by the\nmagneto-dipole rotator during quiescence (radio-ejection model). This strong\noutflow may power tidal dissipation in the companion star and be responsible of\nthe gravitational quadrupole change oscillations.\n", "  The spatial distribution of dust in galaxies affects the global attenuation,\nand hence inferred properties, of galaxies. We trace the spatial distribution\nof dust in five fields (at 0.6-0.9 kpc scale) of M31 by comparing optical\nattenuation with the total dust mass distribution. We measure the attenuation\nfrom the Balmer decrement using Integral Field Spectroscopy and the dust mass\nfrom Herschel far-IR observations. Our results show that M31's dust attenuation\nclosely follows a foreground screen model, contrary to what was previously\nfound in other nearby galaxies. By smoothing the M31 data we find that spatial\nresolution is not the cause for this difference. Based on the emission line\nratios and two simple models, we conclude that previous models of dust/gas\ngeometry need to include a weakly or non-attenuated diffuse ionized gas (DIG)\ncomponent. Due to the variation of dust and DIG scale heights with galactic\nradius, we conclude that different locations in galaxies will have different\nvertical distributions of gas and dust and therefore different measured\nattenuation. The difference between our result in M31 with that found in other\nnearby galaxies can be explained by our fields in M31 lying at larger galactic\nradii than the previous studies that focused on the centres of galaxies.\n", "  We describe new efforts to model radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a\ncosmological context using the SAGE semi-analytic galaxy model. Our new method\ntracks the physical properties of radio jets in massive galaxies, including the\nevolution of radio lobes and their impact on the surrounding gas. This model\nalso self consistently follows the gas cooling-heating cycle that significantly\nshapes star formation and the life and death of many galaxy types. Adding jet\nphysics to SAGE adds new physical properties to the model output, which in turn\nallows us to make more detailed predictions for the radio AGN population. After\ncalibrating the model to a set of core observations we analyse predictions for\njet power, radio cocoon size, radio luminosity, and stellar mass. We find that\nthe model is able to match the stellar mass--radio luminosity relation at\n$z\\sim0$, and the radio luminosity function out to $z\\sim1$. This updated model\nwill make possible the construction of customised AGN-focused mock survey\ncatalogues to be used for large-scale observing programs.\n", "  We use a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to examine the effects of\nmisaligned binary companions on Be star discs. We systematically vary the\ndegree of misalignment between the disc and the binary orbit, as well as the\ndisc viscosity and orbital period to study their effects on the density in the\ninner and outer parts of the disc. We find that varying the degree of\nmisalignment, the viscosity, and the orbital period affects both the truncation\nradius and the density structure of the outer disc, while the inner disc\nremains mostly unaffected. We also investigate the tilting of the disc in the\ninnermost part of the disc and find the tilt increases with radius until\nreaching a maximum around 5 stellar radii. The direction of the line of nodes,\nwith respect to the equator of the central star, is found to be offset compared\nto the orbital line of nodes, and to vary periodically in time, with a period\nof half a orbital phase. We also compare the scale height of our discs with the\nanalytical scale height of an isothermal disc, which increases with radius as\n$r^{1.5}$. We find that this formula reproduces the scale height well for both\naligned and misaligned systems but underestimates the scale height in regions\nof the disc where density enhancements develop.\n", "  We analyse the stellar kinematics of the z=0.169 brightest cluster galaxy\n(BCG) in Abell 1201, using integral field observations with VLT/MUSE. This\ngalaxy has a gravitationally-lensed arc located at unusually small radius\n($\\sim$5 kpc), allowing us to constrain the mass distribution using lensing and\nstellar dynamical information over the same radial range. We measure a velocity\ndispersion profile which is nearly flat at $\\sigma$ $\\approx$ 285 km/s in the\ninner $\\sim$5 kpc, and then rises steadily to $\\sigma$ $\\approx$ 360 km/s at\n$\\sim$30 kpc. We analyse the kinematics using axisymmetric Jeans models,\nfinding that the data require both a significant dark matter halo (to fit the\nrising outer profile) and a compact central component, with mass $M_{\\rm cen}$\n$\\approx$ 2.5$\\times$10$^{10}$ $M_\\odot$ (to fit the flat {\\sigma} in the inner\nregions). The latter component could represent a super-massive black hole, in\nwhich case it would be among the largest known to date. Alternatively $M_{\\rm\ncen}$ could describe excess mass associated with a gradient in the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio. Imposing a standard NFW dark matter density profile, we\nrecover a stellar mass-to-light ratio $\\Upsilon$ which is consistent with a\nMilky-Way-like initial mass function (IMF). By anchoring the models using the\nlensing mass constraint, we break the degeneracy between $\\Upsilon$ and the\ninner slope $\\gamma$ of the dark matter profile, finding $\\gamma$=1.0$\\pm$0.1,\nconsistent with the NFW form. We show that our results are quite sensitive to\nthe treatment of the central mass in the models. Neglecting $M_{\\rm cen}$\nbiases the results towards both a heavier-than-Salpeter IMF and a\nshallower-than-NFW dark matter slope ($\\gamma$ $\\approx$ 0.5).\n", "  We take advantage of the exquisite quality of the Hubble Space Telescope\n26-filter astro-photometric catalog of the core of Omega Cen presented in the\nfirst paper of this series and the empirical differential-reddening correction\npresented in the second paper in order to distill the main sequence into its\nconstituent populations. To this end, we restrict ourselves to the five most\nuseful filters: the magic \"trio\" of F275W, F336W, and F438W, along with F606W\nand F814W. We develop a strategy for identifying color systems where different\npopulations stand out most distinctly, then we isolate those populations and\nexamine them in other filters where their sub-populations also come to light.\nIn this way, we have identified at least 15 sub-populations, each of which has\na distinctive fiducial curve through our 5-dimensional photometric space. We\nconfirm the MSa to be split into two subcomponents, and find that both the bMS\nand the rMS are split into three subcomponents. Moreover, we have discovered\ntwo additional MS groups: the MSd (which has three subcomponents) shares\nsimilar properties with the bMS, and the MSe (which has four subcomponents),\nhas properties more similar to those of the rMS. We examine the fiducial curves\ntogether and use synthetic spectra to infer relative heavy-element,\nlight-element, and Helium abundances for the populations. Our findings show\nthat the stellar populations and star formation history of Omega Cen are even\nmore complex than inferred previously. Finally, we provide as a supplement to\nthe original catalog a list that identifies for each star which population it\nmost likely is associated with.\n", "  GalICS 2.0 is a new semianalytic code to model the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies in a cosmological context. N-body simulations based on a Planck\ncosmology are used to construct halo merger trees, track subhaloes, compute\nspins and measure concentrations. The accretion of gas onto galaxies and the\nmorphological evolution of galaxies are modelled with prescriptions derived\nfrom hydrodynamic simulations. Star formation and stellar feedback are\ndescribed with phenomenological models (as in other semianalytic codes). GalICS\n2.0 computes rotation speeds from the gravitational potential of the dark\nmatter, the disc and the central bulge. As the rotation speed depends not only\non the virial velocity but also on the ratio of baryons to dark matter within a\ngalaxy, our calculation predicts a different Tully-Fisher relation from models\nin which the rotation speed is proportional to the virial velocity. This is why\nGalICS 2.0 is able to reproduce the galaxy stellar mass function and the\nTully-Fisher relation simultaneously. Our results are also in agreement with\nhalo masses from weak lensing and satellite kinematics, gas fractions, the\nrelation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass, the evolution of\nthe cosmic SFR density, bulge-to-disc ratios, disc sizes and the Faber-Jackson\nrelation.\n", "  Magnetic field fluctuations in MHD turbulence can be viewed as current sheets\nthat are progressively more anisotropic at smaller scales. As suggested by\nLoureiro & Boldyrev (2017) and Mallet et al (2017), below a certain critical\nthickness $\\lambda_c$ such current sheets become tearing-unstable. We propose\nthat the tearing instability changes the effective alignment of the magnetic\nfield lines in such a way as to balance the eddy turnover rate at all scales\nsmaller than $\\lambda_c$. As a result, turbulent fluctuations become\nprogressively less anisotropic at smaller scales, with the alignment angle\nincreasing as $\\theta \\sim (\\lambda/\\lambda_*)^{-4/5+\\beta}$, where\n$\\lambda_*\\sim L_0 S_0^{-3/4}$ is the resistive dissipation scale. Here $L_0$\nis the outer scale of the turbulence, $S_0$ is the corresponding Lundquist\nnumber, and {$0\\leq \\beta <4/5$} is a parameter. The resulting Fourier energy\nspectrum is $E(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-11/5+2\\beta/3}$, where $k_\\perp$ is\nthe wavenumber normal to the local mean magnetic field, and the critical scale\nis $\\lambda_c\\sim S_L^{-(4-5\\beta)/(7-{20\\beta/3})}$. The simplest model\ncorresponds to $\\beta=0$, in which case the predicted scaling formally agrees\nwith one of the solutions obtained in (Mallet et al 2017) from a discrete\nhierarchical model of abruptly collapsing current sheets, an approach different\nand complementary to ours. We also show that the reconnection-mediated interval\nis non-universal with respect to the dissipation mechanism. Hyper-resistivity\nof the form ${\\tilde \\eta}k^{2+2s}$ leads (in the simplest case of $\\beta=0$)\nto the different transition scale $\\lambda_c\\sim L_0{\\tilde S}_0^{-4/(7+9s)}$\nand the energy spectrum $E(k_\\perp)\\propto k_\\perp^{-(11+9s)/(5+3s)}$, where\n${\\tilde S}_0$ is the corresponding hyper-resistive Lundquist number.\n", "  The complete characterization of spatial coherence is difficult because the\nmutual coherence function is a complex-valued function of four independent\nvariables. This difficulty limits the ability of controlling and optimizing\nspatial coherence in a broad range of key applications. Here we propose a\nmethod for measuring the complete mutual coherence function, which does not\nrequire any prior knowledge and can be scaled to measure arbitrary coherence\nproperties for any wavelength. Our method can also be used to retrieve objects\nilluminated by partially coherent beam with unknown coherence properties. This\nstudy is particularly useful for coherent diffractive imaging of nanoscale\nstructures in the X-ray or electron regime. Our method is not limited by any\nassumption about the illumination and hence lays the foundation for a branch of\nnew diffractive imaging algorithms.\n", "  We analyze the chemical composition of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 5315,\nthrough high-resolution (R = 40000) optical spectroscopy with UVES at the Very\nLarge Telescope, and medium-resolution (R = 4800) near-infrared spectroscopy\nwith FIRE at Magellan Baade Telescope, covering a wide spectral range from 0.31\nto 2.50 micron. The main aim of this work is to investigate neutron (n)-capture\nelement abundances to study the operation of the slow n-capture (\"s-process\")\nin the AGB progenitor of NGC 5315. We detect more than 700 emission lines,\nincluding ions of the n-capture elements Se, Kr, Xe, and possibly Br. We\ncompute physical conditions from a large number of diagnostic line ratios, and\nderive ionic abundances for species with available atomic data. The total\nabundances are computed using recent ionization correction factors (ICFs) or by\nsumming ionic abundances. Total abundances of common elements are in good\nagreement with previous work on this object. Based on our abundance analysis of\nNGC 5315, including the lack of s-process enrichment, we speculate that the\nmost probable scenario is that the progenitor star is in a binary system as\nhinted at by radial velocity studies, and interactions with its companion\ntruncated the AGB before s-process enrichment could occur. However there are\nother two possible scenarios for its evolution, that cannot be ruled out: i)\nthe progenitor is a low-mass single star that did not undergo third dredge-up;\nii) the progenitor star of NGC 5315 had an initial mass of 4--6 solar masses,\nand any s-process enhancements were heavily diluted by the massive envelope\nduring the AGB phase.\n", "  Around 160 gamma-ray pulsars were discovered by the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) since 2008. The most energetic of them, 12 objects with\nemission above 25 GeV, are suitable candidates for the detection with the\ncurrent and future Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes above few tens of\nGeV. We perform an analysis of the Fermi-LAT data of these high-energy pulsars\nin order to determine if such objects can be detected with the Cherenkov\nTelescope Array (CTA). Our goal is to forecast the significance of their point\nsource detection with CTA. We analyze 5 years of the Fermi-LAT data fitting the\nspectra of each pulsar at energies E>10 GeV with a power-law function. Assuming\nno spectral cut-off, we extrapolate the resulting spectra to the very high\nenergy range (VHE, E>0.1 TeV) and simulate CTA observations of all 12 pulsars\nwith the ctools software package. Using different analysis tools, individual\nCTA sensitivity curves are independently calculated for each pulsar and\ncross-checked with the ctools results. Our simulations result in significant\nCTA detections of up to 8 pulsars in 50 h. Observations of the most energetic\nFermi pulsars with CTA will shed light on the nature of the high-energy\nemission of pulsars, clarifying whether the VHE emission detected in the Crab\npulsar spectrum is present also in other gamma-ray pulsars.\n", "  An increasing number of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the Magellanic\nClouds have been found to exhibit bimodal or extended main sequences (MSs) in\ntheir color--magnitude diagrams (CMDs). These features are usually interpreted\nin terms of a coeval stellar population with different stellar rotational\nrates, where the blue and red MS stars are populated by non- (or slowly) and\nrapidly rotating stellar populations, respectively. However, some studies have\nshown that an age spread of several million years is required to reproduce the\nobserved wide turn-off regions in some YMCs. Here we present the\nultraviolet--visual CMDs of four Large and Small Magellanic Cloud YMCs, NGC\n330, NGC 1805, NGC 1818, and NGC 2164, based on high-precision Hubble Space\nTelescope photometry. We show that they all exhibit extended main-sequence\nturn-offs (MSTOs). The importance of age spreads and stellar rotation in\nreproducing the observations is investigated. The observed extended MSTOs\ncannot be explained by stellar rotation alone. Adopting an age spread of 35--50\nMyr can alleviate this difficulty. We conclude that stars in these clusters are\ncharacterized by ranges in both their ages and rotation properties, but the\norigin of the age spread in these clusters remains unknown.\n", "  Adopting Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition technique, we construct a series\nof self-consistent galaxy models, embedded in the external field of galaxy\nclusters in the framework of Milgrom's MOdified Newtonian Dynamics. These\nmodels represent relatively massive ellipticals with a Hernquist radial profile\nat various distances from the cluster centre. Using $N$-body simulations, we\nperform a first analysis of these models and their evolution. We find that\nself-gravitating axisymmetric density models, even under a weak external field,\nlose their symmetry by instability and generally evolve to triaxial\nconfigurations. A kinematic analysis suggests that the instability originates\nfrom both box and non-classified orbits with low angular momentum. We also\nconsider a self-consistent isolated system which is then placed in a strong\nexternal field and allowed to evolve freely. This model, just as the\ncorresponding equilibrium model in the same external field, eventually settles\nto a triaxial equilibrium as well, but has a higher velocity radial anisotropy\nand is rounder. The presence of an external field in MOND universe generically\npredicts some lopsidedness of galaxy shapes.\n", "  We present a detailed multi-wavelength study of an unobscured, highly\nsuper-Eddington Type-1 QSO RX J0439.6-5311. We combine the latest XMM-Newton\nobservation with all archival data from infrared to hard X-rays. The optical\nspectrum is very similar to that of 1H 0707-495 in having extremely weak [O\n{\\sc iii}] and strong Fe {\\sc ii} emission lines, although the black hole mass\nis probably slightly higher at $5-10 \\times10^{6}~\\rm M_{\\odot}$. The broadband\nSED is uniquely well-defined due to the extremely low Galactic and intrinsic\nabsorption, so the bolometric luminosity is tightly constrained. The optical/UV\naccretion disc continuum is seen down to 900 \\AA, showing that there is a\nstandard thin disc structure down to $R \\ge$ 190-380 $R_{\\rm g}$ and\ndetermining the mass accretion rate through the outer disc. This predicts a\nmuch higher bolometric luminosity than observed, indicating that there must be\nstrong wind and/or advective energy losses from the inner disc, as expected for\na highly super-Eddington accretion flow. Significant outflows are detected in\nboth the NLR and BLR emission lines, confirming the presence of a wind. We\npropose a global picture for the structure of a super-Eddington accretion flow\nwhere the inner disc puffs up, shielding much of the potential NLR material,\nand show how inclination angle with respect to this and the wind can explain\nvery different X-ray properties of RX J0439.6-5311 and 1H 0707-495. Therefore,\nthis source provides strong supporting evidence that `simple' and `complex'\nsuper-Eddington NLS1s can be unified within the same accretion flow scenario\nbut with different inclination angles. We also propose that these extreme NLS1s\ncould be the low-redshift analogs of weak emission-line quasars (WLQs).\n", "  In a description of physical systems with Langevin equations, interacting\ndegrees of freedom are usually coupled through symmetric parameter matrices.\nThis coupling symmetry is a consequence of time-reversal symmetry of the\ninvolved conservative forces. If coupling parameters fluctuate randomly, the\nresulting noise is called multiplicative. For example, mechanical oscillators\ncan be coupled through a fluctuating, symmetric matrix of spring \"constants\".\nSuch systems exhibit well-studied instabilities. In this note, we study the\ncomplementary case of antisymmetric, time-reversal symmetry breaking coupling\nthat can be realized with Lorentz forces or various gyrators. We consider the\ncase that these antisymmetric couplings fluctuate. This type of multiplicative\nnoise does not lead to instabilities in the stationary state but renormalizes\nthe effective non-equilibrium friction. Fluctuating Lorentz-force-like\ncouplings also allow to control and rectify heat transfer. A noteworthy\nproperty of this mechanism of producing asymmetric heat flux is that the\ncontrolling couplings do not exchange energy with the system..\n", "  The characterization of dust properties in the interstellar medium (ISM) is\nkey for star formation. Mass estimates are crucial to determine gravitational\ncollapse conditions for the birth of new stellar objects in molecular clouds.\nHowever, most of these estimates rely on dust models that need further\nobservational constraints from clouds to prestellar and protostellar cores. We\npresent results of a study of dust emissivity changes based on mm-continuum\ndata obtained with the NIKA camera at the IRAM-30m telescope. Observing dust\nemission at 1.15 mm and 2 mm allows us to constrain the dust emissivity index\n($\\beta$) in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the dust spectral energy distribution\n(SED) far from its peak emission, where the contribution of other parameters\n(i.e. dust temperature) is important. Focusing on the Taurus molecular cloud, a\nlow-mass star-forming regions in the Gould Belt, we analyze the emission\nproperties of several distinct objects in the B213 filament: three prestellar\ncores, two Class-0/I protostellar cores and one Class-II object. By means of\nthe ratio of the two NIKA channel-maps, we show that in the Rayleigh-Jeans\napproximation the dust emissivity index varies among the objects. For one\nprestellar and two protostellar cores, we produce a robust study using Herschel\ndata to constrain the dust temperature of the sources. By using the Abel\ntransform inversion technique we get accurate radial $\\beta$ profiles. We find\nsystematic spatial variations of $\\beta$ in the protostellar cores that is not\nobserved in the prestellar core. While in the former case $\\beta$ decreases\ntoward the center, in the latter it remains constant. Moreover, $\\beta$ appears\nanticorrelated with the dust temperature. We discuss the implication of these\nresults in terms of dust grain evolution between pre- and protostellar cores.\n", "  We present the serendipitous discovery of an extended cold gas structure\nprojected close to the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the z=0.045 cluster\nAbell 3716, from archival integral field spectroscopy. The gas is revealed\nthrough narrow Na D line absorption, seen against the stellar light of the BCG,\nwhich can be traced for $\\sim$25 kpc, with a width of 2-4 kpc. The gas is\noffset to higher velocity than the BCG (by $\\sim$100 km/s), showing that it is\ninfalling rather than outflowing; the intrinsic linewidth is $\\sim$80 km/s\n(FWHM). Very weak H$\\alpha$ line emission is detected from the structure, and a\nweak dust absorption feature is suggested from optical imaging, but no stellar\ncounterpart has been identified. We discuss some possible interpretations for\nthe absorber: as a projected low-surface-brightness galaxy, as a stream of gas\nthat was stripped from an infalling cluster galaxy, or as a \"retired\" cool-core\nnebula filament.\n", "  We consider the long-term collisional and dynamical evolution of solid\nmaterial orbiting in a narrow annulus near the Roche limit of a white dwarf.\nWith orbital velocities of 300 km/sec, systems of solids with initial\neccentricity $e \\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ generate a collisional cascade where objects\nwith radii $r \\lesssim$ 100--300 km are ground to dust. This process converts\n1-100 km asteroids into 1 $\\mu$m particles in $10^2 - 10^6$ yr. Throughout this\nevolution, the swarm maintains an initially large vertical scale height $H$.\nAdding solids at a rate $\\dot{M}$ enables the system to find an equilibrium\nwhere the mass in solids is roughly constant. This equilibrium depends on\n$\\dot{M}$ and $r_0$, the radius of the largest solid added to the swarm. When\n$r_0 \\lesssim$ 10 km, this equilibrium is stable. For larger $r_0$, the mass\noscillates between high and low states; the fraction of time spent in high\nstates ranges from 100% for large $\\dot{M}$ to much less than 1% for small\n$\\dot{M}$. During high states, the stellar luminosity reprocessed by the solids\nis comparable to the excess infrared emission observed in many metallic line\nwhite dwarfs.\n", "  Although originally discovered as a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar, J1732-3131\nhas exhibited intriguing detections at decameter wavelengths. We report an\nextensive follow-up of the pulsar at 327 MHz with the Ooty radio telescope.\nUsing the previously observed radio characteristics, and with an effective\nintegration time of 60 hrs, we present a detection of the pulsar at a\nconfidence level of 99.82%. The 327 MHz mean flux density is estimated to be\n0.5-0.8 mJy, which establishes the pulsar to be a steep spectrum source and one\nof the least-luminous pulsars known to date. We also phase-aligned the radio\nand gamma-ray profiles of the pulsar, and measured the phase-offset between the\nmain peaks in the two profiles to be 0.24$\\pm$0.06. We discuss the observed\nphase-offset in the context of various trends exhibited by the radio-loud\ngamma-ray pulsar population, and suggest that the gamma-ray emission from\nJ1732-3131 is best explained by outer magnetosphere models. Details of our\nanalysis leading to the pulsar detection, and measurements of various\nparameters and their implications relevant to the pulsar's emission mechanism\nare presented.\n", "  We present 1500 cycles of hydrogen shell flashes on a 1.38 M_sun white dwarf\n(WD) for a mass accretion rate of 1.6 x 10^{-7} M_sun yr^{-1}, the mass\nejection of which is calculated consistently with the optically thick winds.\nThis model mimics the one-year-recurrence-period nova M31N 2008-12a. Through\nthese hydrogen flashes a helium ash layer grows in mass and eventually triggers\na helium nova outburst. Each hydrogen flash is almost identical and there is no\nprecursor for the forthcoming He flash either in the outburst or in the\nquiescent until the next He flash suddenly occurs. Thus, M31N 2008-12a is a\npromising candidate of He novae, outbursting in any time within a millennium\nyears. The prompt X-ray flash of He nova lasts as short as 15 min with the\nX-ray luminosity being about a half of the Eddington luminosity, making the\nobservation difficult. In the very early phase of a He flash, the uppermost\nH-rich layer is convectively mixed into the deep interior and most of hydrogen\nis consumed by nuclear burning. In comparison with hydrogen shell flashes of\nM31N 2008-12a, we expect the forthcoming He nova with a very short prompt X-ray\nflash (15 min), a very bright optical/NIR peak (~3.5 mag brighter than M31N\n2008-12a), a much longer nova duration (>2 years), and a longer supersoft X-ray\nsource phase (40-50 days or more).\n", "  PSR B1259-63/LS2883 is a binary system composed of a pulsar and a Be star.\nThe Be star has an equatorial circumstellar disk (CD). The {\\it Fermi}\nsatellite discovered unexpected gamma-ray flares around 30 days after the last\ntwo periastron passages. The origin of the flares remain puzzling. In this\nwork, we explore the possibility that, the GeV flares are consequences of\ninverse Compton-scattering of soft photons by the pulsar wind. The soft photons\nare from an accretion disk around the pulsar, which is composed by the matter\nfrom CD captured by the pulsar's gravity at disk-crossing before the\nperiastron. At the other disk-crossing after the periastron, the density of the\nCD is not high enough so that accretion is prevented by the pulsar wind shock.\nThis model can reproduce the observed SEDs and light curves satisfactorily.\n", "  We discuss common properties and reasons for integrability in the class of\nmultistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) models with all diabatic levels crossing at one\npoint. Exploring the Stokes phenomenon, we show that each previously solved\nmodel has a dual one, whose scattering matrix can be also obtained\nanalytically. For applications, we demonstrate how our results can be used to\nstudy conversion of molecular into atomic Bose condensates during passage\nthrough the Feshbach resonance, and provide purely algebraic solutions of the\nbowtie and special cases of the driven Tavis-Cummings model (DTCM).\n", "  The mass of the central black hole in a galaxy that hosted a tidal disruption\nevent (TDE) is an important parameter in understanding its energetics and\ndynamics. We present the first homogeneously measured black hole masses of a\ncomplete sample of 12 optically/UV selected TDE host galaxies (down to\n$g_{host}$$\\leq$22 mag and $z$=0.37) in the Northern sky. The mass estimates\nare based on velocity dispersion measurements, performed on late time optical\nspectroscopic observations. We find black hole masses in the range\n3$\\times$10$^5$ M$_{\\odot}$$\\leq$M$_{\\rm BH}$$\\leq$2$\\times$10$^7$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nThe TDE host galaxy sample is dominated by low mass black holes ($\\sim$10$^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$), as expected from theoretical predictions. The blackbody peak\nluminosity of TDEs with M$_{\\rm BH}$$\\leq$10$^{7.1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ is consistent\nwith the Eddington limit of the SMBH, whereas the two TDEs with M$_{\\rm\nBH}$$\\geq$10$^{7.1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ have peak luminosities below their SMBH\nEddington luminosity, in line with the theoretical expectation that the\nfallback rate for M$_{\\rm BH}$$\\geq$10$^{7.1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ is sub-Eddington. In\naddition, our observations suggest that TDEs around lower mass black holes\nevolve faster. These findings corroborate the standard TDE picture in 10$^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$ black holes. Our results imply an increased tension between\nobservational and theoretical TDE rates. By comparing the blackbody emission\nradius with theoretical predictions, we conclude that the optical/UV emission\nis produced in a region consistent with the stream self-intersection radius of\nshallow encounters, ruling out a compact accretion disk as the direct origin of\nthe blackbody radiation at peak brightness.\n", "  We studied the properties of the gas of the extended narrow line region\n(ENLR) of two Seyfert 2 galaxies: IC 5063 and NGC 7212. We analysed high\nresolution spectra to investigate how the main properties of this region depend\non the gas velocity. We divided the emission lines in velocity bins and we\ncalculated several line ratios. Diagnostic diagrams and SUMA composite models\n(photo-ionization + shocks), show that in both galaxies there might be evidence\nof shocks significantly contributing in the gas ionization at high |V|, even\nthough photo-ionization from the active nucleus remains the main ionization\nmechanism. In IC 5063 the ionization parameter depends on V and its trend might\nbe explained assuming an hollow bi-conical shape for the ENLR, with one of the\nedges aligned with the galaxy disk. On the other hand, NGC 7212 does not show\nany kind of dependence. The models show that solar O/H relative abundances\nreproduce the observed spectra in all the analysed regions. They also revealed\nan high fragmentation of the gas clouds, suggesting that the complex kinematics\nobserved in these two objects might be caused by interaction between the ISM\nand high velocity components, such as jets.\n", "  High-precision proper motions of the globular cluster 47 Tuc have allowed us\nto measure for the first time the cluster rotation in the plane of the sky and\nthe velocity anisotropy profile from the cluster core out to about 13'. These\nprofiles are coupled with prior measurements along the line of sight and the\nsurface-brightness profile, and fit all together with self-consistent models\nspecifically constructed to describe quasi-relaxed stellar systems with\nrealistic differential rotation, axisymmetry and pressure anisotropy. The\nbest-fit model provides an inclination angle i between the rotation axis and\nthe line-of-sight direction of 30 deg, and is able to simultaneously reproduce\nthe full three-dimensional kinematics and structure of the cluster, while\npreserving a good agreement with the projected morphology. Literature models\nbased solely on line-of-sight measurements imply a significantly different\ninclination angle (i=45 deg), demonstrating that proper motions play a key role\nin constraining the intrinsic structure of 47 Tuc. Our best-fit global\ndynamical model implies an internal rotation higher than previous studies have\nshown, and suggests a peak of the intrinsic V/sigma ratio of ~0.9 at around two\nhalf-light radii, with a non-monotonic intrinsic ellipticity profile reaching\nvalues up to 0.45. Our study unveils a new degree of dynamical complexity in 47\nTuc, which may be leveraged to provide new insights into the formation and\nevolution of globular clusters.\n", "  The total amount of dust (or \"metallicity\") and the dust distribution in\nprotoplanetary disks are crucial for planet formation. Dust grains radially\ndrift due to gas--dust friction, and the gas is affected by the feedback from\ndust grains. We investigate the effects of the feedback from dust grains on the\nviscous evolution of the gas, taking into account the vertical dust settling.\nThe feedback from the grains pushes the gas outward. When the grains are small\nand the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much smaller than unity, the radial drift\nvelocity is reduced by the feedback effect but the gas still drifts inward.\nWhen the grains are sufficiently large or piled-up, the feedback is so\neffective that forces the gas flows outward. Although the dust feedback is\naffected by dust settling, we found that the 2D approximation reasonably\nreproduces the vertical averaged flux of gas and dust. We also performed the 2D\ntwo-fluid hydrodynamic simulations to examine the effect of the feedback from\nthe grains on the evolution of the gas disk. We show that when the feedback is\neffective, the gas flows outward and the gas density at the region within $\\sim\n10\\ \\mbox{AU}$ is significantly depleted. As a result, the dust-to-gas mass\nratio at the inner radii may significantly excess unity, providing the\nenvironment where planetesimals are easily formed via, e.g., streaming\ninstability. We also show that a simplified 1D model well reproduces the\nresults of the 2D two-fluid simulations, which would be useful for future\nstudies.\n", "  We investigate the origin of ten solar quiet region pre-jet minifilaments,\nusing EUV images from SDO/AIA and magnetograms from SDO/HMI. We recently found\npanesar16b that quiet region coronal jets are driven by minifilament eruptions,\nwhere those eruptions result from flux cancelation at the magnetic neutral line\nunder the minifilament. Here, we study the longer-term origin of the pre-jet\nminifilaments themselves. We find that they result from flux cancelation\nbetween minority-polarity and majority-polarity flux patches. In each of ten\npre-jet regions, we find that opposite-polarity patches of magnetic flux\nconverge and cancel, with a flux reduction of 10--40% from before to after the\nminifilament appears. For our ten events, the minifilaments exist for periods\nranging from 1.5 hr to two days before erupting to make a jet. Apparently, the\nflux cancelation builds highly sheared field that runs above and traces the\nneutral line, and the cool-transition-region-plasma minifilament forms in this\nfield and is suspended in it. We infer that the convergence of the\nopposite-polarity patches results in reconnection in the low corona that builds\na magnetic arcade enveloping the minifilament in its core, and that the\ncontinuing flux cancelation at the neutral line finally destabilizes the\nminifilament field so that it erupts and drives the production of a coronal\njet. Thus our observations strongly support that quiet region magnetic flux\ncancelation results in both the formation of the pre-jet minifilament and its\njet-driving eruption.\n", "  We present evidence for a spatially-dependent systematic error in the first\ndata release of ${\\it Gaia}$ parallaxes based on comparisons to asteroseismic\nparallaxes in the ${\\it Kepler}$ field, and present a parametrized model of the\nangular dependence of these systematics. We report an error of\n$0.059^{+0.004}_{-0.004}$mas on scales of 0.3deg, which decreases for larger\nscales to become $0.011^{+0.006}_{-0.004}$mas at 8deg. This is consistent with\nthe $\\sim2\\%$ zeropoint offset for the whole sample discussed by Huber et al.,\nand is compatible with the effect predicted by the ${\\it Gaia}$ team. Our\nresults are robust to dust prescriptions and choices in temperature scales used\nto calculate asteroseismic parallaxes. We also do not find evidence for\nsignificant differences in the signal when using red clump versus red giant\nstars. Our approach allows us to quantify and map the correlations in an\nastrophysically interesting field, resulting in a parametrized model of the\nspatial systematics that can be used to construct a covariance matrix for any\nwork that relies upon TGAS parallaxes.\n", "  We obtained new optical observations of the X-ray source XMMU\nJ083850.38-282756.8, the previously proposed counterpart of the gamma-ray\nsource 3FGL J0838.8-2829. Time-series photometry in the $r'$ band reveals\nperiodic modulation of $\\approx1$ magnitude that is characteristic of the\nheating of the photosphere of a low-mass companion star by a compact object.\nThe measured orbital period is 5.14817$\\pm$0.00012 hr. The shape of the light\ncurve is variable, evidently due to the effects of flaring and asymmetric\nheating. Spectroscopy reveals a companion of type M1 or later, having a radial\nvelocity amplitude of 315$\\pm$17 km/s, with period and phasing consistent with\nthe heating interpretation. The mass function of the compact object is\n0.69$\\pm$0.11 $M_{\\odot}$, which allows a neutron star in a high-inclination\norbit. Variable, broad H$\\alpha$ emission is seen, which is probably associated\nwith a wind from the companion. These properties, as well as the X-ray and\ngamma-ray luminosities at the inferred distance of <1.7 kpc, are consistent\nwith a redback millisecond pulsar in its non-accreting state. A search for\nradio pulsations is needed to confirm this interpretation and derive complete\nsystem parameters for modeling, although absorption by the ionized wind could\nhinder such detection.\n", "  Daily differential emission measure (DEM) distributions of the solar corona\nare derived from spectra obtained by the Extreme-ultraviolet Variability\nExperiment (EVE) over a 4-year period starting in 2010 near solar minimum and\ncontinuing through the maximum of solar cycle 24. The DEMs are calculated using\nsix strong emission features dominated by Fe lines of charge states VIII, IX,\nXI, XII, XIV, and XVI that sample the non-flaring coronal temperature range\n0.3--5 MK. A proxy for the non-XVIII emission in the wavelength band around the\n93.9 \\AA\\ line is demonstrated. There is little variability in the cool\ncomponent of the corona (T $<$ 1.3 MK) over the four years, suggesting that the\nquiet-Sun corona does not respond strongly to the solar cycle, whereas the\nhotter component (T $>$ 2.0 MK) varies by more than an order of magnitude. A\ndiscontinuity in the behavior of coronal diagnostics in 2011 February--March,\naround the time of the first X-class flare of cycle 24, suggests fundamentally\ndifferent behavior in the corona under solar minimum and maximum conditions.\nThis global state transition occurs over a period of several months. The DEMs\nare used to estimate the thermal energy of the visible solar corona (of order\n$10^{31}$ erg), its radiative energy loss rate (2.5--8 $\\times 10^{27}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$), and the corresponding energy turnover timescale (about an hour). The\nuncertainties associated with the DEMs and these derived values are mostly due\nto the coronal Fe abundance and density and the CHIANTI atomic line database.\n", "  We derive relative proper motions of stars in the fields of the globular\nclusters M12, NGC 6362, M4, M55, M22, NGC 6752, NGC 3201, M30, M10, NGC 362,\nM5, and 47 Tucanae based on data collected between 1997 and 2015 with the 1-m\nSwope telescope of Las Campanas Observatory. We determine membership class and\nmembership probability for over 446 000 objects, and show that these are\nefficient methods for separating field stars from members of the cluster. In\nparticular, membership probabilities of variable stars and blue/yellow/red\nstragglers are determined. Finally, we find absolute proper motions for six\nglobular clusters from our sample: M55, NGC 3201, M10, NGC 362, M5, and 47 Tuc.\nAn electronic catalogue of the derived proper motions is publicly available via\nthe internet.\n", "  We report on the RXTE detection of a sudden increase in the absorption column\ndensity, $N_\\mathrm{H}$, during the 2011 May outburst of GX 304-1. The\n$N_\\mathrm{H}$ increased up to ${\\sim}16\\times 10^{22}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$, which\nis a factor of 3-4 larger than what is usually measured during the outbursts of\nGX 304-1 as covered by RXTE. Additionally, an increase in the variability of\nthe hardness ratio as calculated from the energy resolved RXTE-PCA light curves\nis measured during this time range. We interpret these facts as an occultation\nevent of the neutron star by material in the line of sight. Using a simple 3D\nmodel of an inclined and precessing Be disk around the Be type companion, we\nare able to qualitatively explain the $N_\\mathrm{H}$ evolution over time. We\nare able to constrain the Be-disk density to be on the order of $10^{-11}$ g\ncm$^{-3}$. Our model strengthens the idea of inclined Be disks as origin of\ndouble-peaked outbursts as the derived geometry allows accretion twice per\norbit under certain conditions.\n", "  Recent meteoritical analyses support an initial abundance of the short-lived\nradioisotope $^{60}$Fe that may be high enough to require nucleosynthesis in a\ncore collapse supernova, followed by rapid incorporation into primitive\nmeteoritical components, rather than a scenario where such isotopes were\ninherited from a well-mixed region of a giant molecular cloud polluted by a\nvariety of supernovae remnants and massive star winds. This paper continues to\nexplore the former scenario, by calculating three dimensional, adaptive mesh\nrefinement, hydrodynamical code (FLASH 2.5) models of the self-gravitational,\ndynamical collapse of a molecular cloud core that has been struck by a thin\nshock front with a speed of 40 km/sec, leading to the injection of shock front\nmatter into the collapsing cloud through the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor\nfingers at the shock-cloud intersection. These models extend the previous work\ninto the nonisothermal collapse regime using a polytropic approximation to\nrepresent compressional heating in the optically thick protostar. The models\nshow that the injection efficiencies of shock front material are enhanced\ncompared to previous models, which were not carried into the nonisothermal\nregime and so did not reach such high densities. The new models, combined with\nthe recent estimates of initial $^{60}$Fe abundances, imply that the supernova\ntriggering and injection scenario remains as a plausible explanation for the\norigin of the short-lived radioisotopes involved in the formation of our solar\nsystem.\n", "  The FUV continuum spectrum of many accreting pre-main sequence stars,\nClassical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs), does not continue smoothly from the\nwell-studied Balmer continuum emission in the NUV, suggesting that additional\nprocesses contribute to the short-wavelength emission in these objects. The\nmost notable spectral feature in the FUV continuum of some CTTSs is a broad\nemission approximately centered at 1600~\\AA, which has been referred to as the\n\"1600 A Bump\". The origin of this feature remains unclear. We have assembled\narchival FUV spectra of 37 disk-hosting systems observed by the {\\it Hubble\nSpace Telescope}. Clear 1600 A Bump emission is observed above the smooth,\nunderlying 1100-1800 A continuum spectrum in 19/37 Classical T Tauri disks in\nthe HST sample, with the detection rate in transition disks (8/8) being much\nhigher than in primordial or non-transition sources (11/29). We describe a\nspectral deconvolution analysis to separate the Bump (spanning 1490~--~1690 A)\nfrom the underlying FUV continuum, finding an average Bump luminosity,\n$L$(Bump7 x 10^{29} erg s^{-1}. We find that the 1600 A Bump is characterized\nby a peak wavelength of 1598.6 +/- 3.3 A.\n  Contrary to previous studies, we find that this feature is inconsistent with\nmodels of H2 excited by electron-impact. We show that this Bump emits roughly\n10-80% of the total fluorescent H2 luminosity for stars with well-defined Bump\nfeatures. Energetically, this suggests that the carrier of the 1600 A Bump\nemission is powered by Ly-a photons. We argue that the most likely mechanism is\nLy-a-driven dissociation of H2O in the inner disk, r < 2 AU. We demonstrate\nthat non-thermally populated H2O fragments can qualitatively account for the\nobserved emission (discrete and continuum), and find that the average\nLy-a-driven H2O dissociation rate is 1.7x 10^{42} water molecules s^{-1}.\n", "  This paper presents an observation of quasi-periodic rapidly-propagating\nwaves observed in the AIA 171/193 \\AA~ channels during the impulsive phase of\nan M1.9 flare occurred on 7 May 2012. The instant period was found to decrease\nfrom 240~s to 120~s, the speed of the wave fronts was in the range of ~664-1416\nkm/s. Almost simultaneously, quasi-periodic bursts with similar instant\nperiods, ~70~s and ~140~s, occur in the microwave emission and in decimetric\ntype IV, and type III radio bursts, and in the soft X-ray emission. The\nmagnetic field configuration of the flare site was consistent with a breakout\ntopology, i.e., a quadrupolar field along with a magnetic null point. The\nquasi-periodic rapidly-propagating wavefronts of the EUV emission are\ninterpreted as a fast magnetoacoustic wave train. The observations suggest that\nthe fast-mode waves are generated during the quasi-periodic magnetic\nreconnection in the cusp-region above the flare arcade loops. For the first\ntime, we provide the evidence of a tadpole wavelet signature at about 70--140~s\nin decimetric (245/610~MHz) radio bursts, along with the direct observation of\na coronal fast-mode wave train in EUV. In addition, at AIA 131/193 \\AA\\ we\nobserved quasi-periodic EUV disturbances with the periods of 95~s and 240~s\npropagating downward at the apparent speed of 172-273 km/s. The nature of these\ndownward propagating disturbances is not revealed, but they could be connected\nwith magnetoacoustic waves or periodically shrinking loops.\n", "  We studied X-ray reverberation lags in the BHXRB GX 339-4 at the end of the\n2014-2015 outburst. We analysed data from a XMM-Newton campaign covering the\nend of the transition from the soft to the hard state, and the decrease of\nluminosity in the hard state. During all the observations we detected, at high\nfrequencies, significant disc variability, responding to variations of the\npower law emission with an average time delay of $\\sim0.009\\pm 0.002$ s. These\nnew detections of disc thermal reverberation add to those previously obtained\nand suggest the lag to be always present in hard and hard-intermediate states.\nOur study reveals a net decrease of lag amplitude as a function of luminosity.\nWe ascribe this trend to variations of the inner flow geometry. A possible\nscenario implies a \\emph{decrease} of the inner disc truncation radius as the\nluminosity increases at the beginning of the outburst, followed by an\n\\emph{increase} of the inner disc truncation radius as the luminosity decreases\nat the end of the outburst. Finally, we found hints of FeK reverberation\n($\\sim3\\sigma$ significance) during the best quality observation of the XMM\nmonitoring. The lag at the FeK energy has similar amplitude as that of the\nthermally reprocessed component, as expected if the same irradiated region of\nthe disc is responsible for producing both the thermalized and reflected\ncomponent. This finding suggests FeK reverberation in BHXRBs to be at the reach\nof current detectors provided observations of sufficiently long exposure are\navailable.\n", "  In the past decade, gamma-ray observations and radio observations put strong\nconstraints on the parameters of dark matter annihilation. In this article, we\nsuggest another robust way to constrain the parameters of dark matter\nannihilation. We expect that the electrons and positrons produced from dark\nmatter annihilation would scatter with the cosmic microwave background photons\nand boost the photon energy to $\\sim$ keV order. Based on the x-ray data from\nthe Draco dwarf galaxy, the new constraints for some of the annihilation\nchannels are generally tighter than the constraints obtained from 6 years of\nFermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) gamma-ray observations of the Milky Way\ndwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. The lower limits of dark matter mass\nannihilating via $e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, $gg$, $u\\bar{u}$ and\n$b\\bar{b}$ channels are 40 GeV, 28 GeV, 30 GeV, 57 GeV, 58 GeV and 66 GeV\nrespectively with the canonical thermal relic cross section. This method is\nparticularly useful to constrain dark matter annihilating via $e^+e^-$,\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $gg$, $u\\bar{u}$ and $b\\bar{b}$ channels.\n", "  To date, blind quantum computing demonstrations require clients to have weak\nquantum devices. Here we implement a proof-of-principle experiment for\ncompletely classical clients. Via classically interacting with two quantum\nservers that share entanglement, the client accomplishes the task of having the\nnumber 15 factorized by servers who are denied information about the\ncomputation itself. This concealment is accompanied by a verification protocol\nthat tests servers' honesty and correctness. Our demonstration shows the\nfeasibility of completely classical clients and thus is a key milestone towards\nsecure cloud quantum computing.\n", "  The aim of the study is to investigate the reason for the low productivity of\nhigh-energy SEPs in the present solar cycle. We employ scaling laws derived\nfrom diffusive shock acceleration theory and simulation studies including\nproton-generated upstream Alfv\\'en waves to find out how the changes observed\nin the long-term average properties of the erupting and ambient coronal and/or\nsolar wind plasma would affect the ability of shocks to accelerate particles to\nthe highest energies. Provided that self-generated turbulence dominates\nparticle transport around coronal shocks, it is found that the most crucial\nfactors controlling the diffusive shock acceleration process are the number\ndensity of seed particles and the plasma density of the ambient medium.\nAssuming that suprathermal populations provide a fraction of the particles\ninjected to shock acceleration in the corona, we show that the lack of most\nenergetic particle events as well as the lack of low charge-to-mass ratio ion\nspecies in the present cycle can be understood as a result of the reduction of\naverage coronal plasma and suprathermal densities in the present cycle over the\nprevious one.\n", "  The ratio of the fluxes of secondary and primary nuclei in cosmic rays has\nlong been used as an indicator of the grammage traversed in the journey of\ncosmic ray particles throughout the Galaxy. The basic idea is that primary\nparticles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant\nshocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally\ninteracting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce\nsecondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically\n$\\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of\nthe main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\\delta}$, where $E_{k}$\nis the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and\n$\\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The\nsame shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the\nfirst place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided\nbeing above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by\nspallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get\naccelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of\ndebate. We compute the spectrum of secondary elements such as boron and lithium\ntaking into account shock reacceleration and compare our predictions with the\nrecent observations of the B/C ratio and preliminary measurements of the boron\nand lithium flux. Both these sets of data seem to confirm that reacceleration\nof secondary nuclei indeed plays an important role, thereby affecting the\nvalidity of those scaling rules that are often used in cosmic ray physics.\n", "  We have characterized the spectroscopic orbit of the TWA 3A binary and\nprovide preliminary families of probable solutions for the TWA 3A visual orbit\nas well as for the wide TWA 3A--B orbit. TWA 3 is a hierarchical triple located\nat 34 pc in the $\\sim$10 Myr old TW Hya association. The wide component\nseparation is 1.\"55; the close pair was first identified as a possible binary\nalmost 20 years ago. We initially identified the 35-day period orbital solution\nusing high-resolution infrared spectroscopy which angularly resolved the A and\nB components. We then refined the preliminary orbit by combining the infrared\ndata with a re-analysis of our high-resolution optical spectroscopy. The\norbital period from the combined spectroscopic solution is $\\sim$35 days, the\neccentricity is $\\sim$0.63, and the mass ratio is $\\sim$0.84; although this\nhigh mass ratio would suggest that optical spectroscopy alone should be\nsufficient to identify the orbital solution, the presence of the tertiary B\ncomponent likely introduced confusion in the blended optical spectra. Using\nmillimeter imaging from the literature, we also estimate the inclinations of\nthe stellar orbital planes with respect to the TWA 3A circumbinary disk\ninclination and find that all three planes are likely misaligned by at least\n$\\sim$30 degrees. The TWA 3A spectroscopic binary components have spectral\ntypes of M4.0 and M4.5; TWA 3B is an M3. We speculate that the system formed as\na triple, is bound, and that its properties were shaped by dynamical\ninteractions between the inclined orbits and disk.\n", "  Previous findings show that massive ($> 10^{10} M_{sun}$) star-forming (SF)\ngalaxies usually have an inside-out stellar mass assembly mode. In this paper,\nwe have for the first time selected a sample of 77 massive SF galaxies with an\noutside-in assembly mode (called targeted sample) from the Mapping Nearby\nGalaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. For comparison, two\ncontrol samples are constructed from MaNGA sample matched in stellar mass: a\nsample of 154 normal SF galaxies and a sample of 62 quiescent galaxies. In\ncontrast to normal SF galaxies, the targeted galaxies appear to be more\nsmooth-like and bulge-dominated, and have smaller size, higher concentration,\nhigher star formation rate and higher gas-phase metallicity as a whole.\nHowever, they have larger size and lower concentration than quiescent galaxies.\nUnlike normal SF sample, the targeted sample exhibits a slightly positive\ngradient of 4000 \\AA\\ break and a pronounced negative gradient of H${\\alpha}$\nequivalent width. Further more, their median surface mass density profile is\nbetween that of normal SF sample and quiescent sample, indicating that the gas\naccretion of quiescent galaxies is not likely to be the main approach for the\noutside-in assembly mode. Our results suggest that the targeted galaxies are\nlikely in the transitional phase from normal SF galaxies to quiescent galaxies,\nwith rapid on-going central stellar mass assembly (or bulge growth). We discuss\nseveral possible formation mechanisms for the outside-in mass assembly mode.\n", "  In studies on intermediate- and high-resolution spectra of Type Ia supernovae\n(SNe Ia), some objects exhibit narrow Na-I D absorptions often blueshifted with\nrespect to the rest wavelength within the host galaxy. The absence of these in\nother SNe Ia may reflect that the explosions have different progenitors:\nblueshifted Na-I D features might be explained by the outflows of\n'single-degenerate' systems (binaries of a white dwarf with a non-degenerate\ncompanion). In this work, we search for systematic differences among SNe Ia for\nwhich the Na-I D characteristics have been clearly established in previous\nstudies. We perform an analysis of the chemical abundances in the outer ejecta\nof 13 'spectroscopically normal' SNe Ia (five of which show blueshifted Na\nlines), modelling time series of photospheric spectra with a radiative-transfer\ncode. We find only moderate differences between 'blueshifted-Na',\n'redshifted-Na' and 'no-Na' SNe Ia, so that we can neither conclusively confirm\na 'one-scenario' nor a 'two-scenario' theory for normal SNe Ia. Yet, some of\nthe trends we see should be further studied using larger observed samples:\nModels for blueshifted-Na SNe tend to show higher photospheric velocities than\nno-Na SNe, corresponding to a higher opacity of the envelope. Consistently,\nblueshifted-Na SNe show hints of a somewhat larger iron-group content in the\nouter layers with respect to the no-Na subsample (and also to the redshifted-Na\nsubsample). This agrees with earlier work where it was found that the light\ncurves of no-Na SNe - often appearing in elliptical galaxies - are narrower,\ni.e. decline more rapidly.\n", "  We further study the unusual trend we found at statistically significant\nlevels in some globular clusters, including NGC 3201: a decreasing iron\nabundance in red giants towards the cluster centers. We first show that\nrecently published new estimates of iron abundance in the cluster reproduce\nthis trend, in spite of the authors' statement about no metallicity spread due\nto a low scatter achieved in the [FeII/H] ratio. The mean of [FeII/H] within $R\n\\sim 2'$ from the cluster center is lower, by $\\Delta$[FeII/H] = 0.05$\\pm$0.02\ndex, than in the outer region, in agreement with our original estimate for a\nmuch larger sample size within $R \\approx 9'$. We found that an older dataset\ntraces the trend to a much larger radial distance, comparable with the cluster\ntidal radius, at $\\Delta$[Fe/H]$\\sim$0.2 dex due to higher metallicity of\ndistant stars. We conclude the trend is reproduced by independent datasets and\nfind that it is accompanied with both a notable same-sign trend of oxygen\nabundance which can vary by up to $\\Delta$[O/Fe]$\\sim$0.3 dex within $R \\approx\n9'$, and opposite-sign trend of sodium abundance.\n", "  Low-mass population III (PopIII) stars of $\\lesssim 0.8 M_{\\odot}$ could\nsurvive up until the present. Non-detection of low-mass PopIII stars in our\nGalaxy has already put a stringent constraint on the initial mass function\n(IMF) of PopIII stars, suggesting that PopIII stars have a top-heavy IMF. On\nthe other hand, some claims that the lack of such stars stems from metal\nenrichment of their surface by accretion of heavy elements from interstellar\nmedium (ISM). We investigate effects of the stellar wind on the metal accretion\nonto low-mass PopIII stars because accretion of the local ISM onto the Sun is\nprevented by the solar wind even for neutrals. The stellar wind and radiation\nof low-mass PopIII stars are modeled based on knowledge of nearby low-mass\nstellar systems including our Sun. We find that low-mass PopIII stars traveling\nacross the Galaxy forms the stellar magnetosphere in most of their life. Once\nthe magnetosphere is formed, most of neutral interstellar particles are\nphotoionized before reaching to the stellar surface and are blown away by the\nwind. Especially, the accretion abundance of iron will be reduced by a factor\nof $< 10^{-12}$ compared with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion. The metal\naccretion can enhance iron abundance [Fe/H] only up to $\\sim -14$. This\ndemonstrates that low-mass PopIII stars remain pristine and will be found as\nmetal free stars and that further searches for them are valuable to constrain\nthe IMF of PopIII stars.\n", "  The black-hole binary V404 Cyg entered the outburst phase in June 2015 after\n26 years of X-ray quiescence, and with its behaviour broke the outburst\nevolution pattern typical of most black-hole binaries. We observed the entire\noutburst with the Swift satellite and performed time-resolved spectroscopy of\nits most active phase, obtaining over a thousand spectra with exposures from\ntens to hundreds of seconds. All the spectra can be fitted with an absorbed\npower law model, which most of the time required the presence of a partial\ncovering. A blue-shifted iron-Kalpha line appears in 10% of the spectra\ntogether with the signature of high column densities, and about 20% of the\nspectra seem to show signatures of reflection. None of the spectra showed the\nunambiguous presence of soft disk-blackbody emission, while the observed\nbolometric flux exceeded the Eddington value in 3% of the spectra. Our results\ncan be explained assuming that the inner part of the accretion flow is inflated\ninto a slim disk that both hides the innermost (and brightest) regions of the\nflow, and produces a cold, clumpy, high-density outflow that introduces the\nhigh-absorption and fast spectral variability observed. We argue that the black\nhole in V404 Cyg might have been accreting erratically or even continuously at\nEddington/Super-Eddington rates - thus sustaining a surrounding slim disk -\nwhile being partly or completely obscured by the inflated disk and its outflow.\nHence, the largest flares produced by the source might not be accretion-driven\nevents, but instead the effects of the unveiling of the extremely bright source\nhidden within the system.\n", "  Protostellar discs play an important role in star formation, acting as the\nprimary mass reservoir for accretion onto young stars and regulating the extent\nto which angular momentum and gas is released back into stellar nurseries\nthrough the launching of powerful disc winds. In this study, we explore how\ndisc structure relates to the properties of the wind-launching region, mapping\nout the regions of protostellar discs where wind launching could be viable. We\ncombine a series of 1.5D semi-analytic, steady-state, vertical disc-wind\nsolutions into a radially extended 1+1.5D model, incorporating all three\ndiffusion mechanisms (Ohm, Hall and ambipolar). We observe that the majority of\nmass outflow via disc winds occurs over a radial width of a fraction of an\nastronomical unit, with outflow rates attenuating rapidly on either side. We\nalso find that the mass accretion rate, magnetic field strength and surface\ndensity profile each have significant effects on both the location of the\nwind-launching region and the ejection/accretion ratio $\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nout}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm in}$. Increasing either the accretion rate or the magnetic\nfield strength corresponds to a shift of the wind-launching region to smaller\nradii and a decrease in $\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm in}$, while increasing\nthe surface density corresponds to launching regions at larger radii with\nincreased $\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm in}$. Finally, we discover a class of\ndisc winds containing an ineffective launching configuration at intermediate\nradii, leading to two radially separated regions of wind launching and\ndiminished $\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm in}$. We find that the wind\nlocations and ejection/accretion ratio are consistent with current\nobservational and theoretical estimates.\n", "  We present a relationship between the black hole mass, stellar mass, and star\nformation rate of a diverse group of 91 galaxies with dynamically-measured\nblack hole masses. For our sample of galaxies with a variety of morphologies\nand other galactic properties, we find that the specific star formation rate is\na smoothly decreasing function of the ratio between black hole mass and stellar\nmass, or what we call the specific black hole mass. In order to explain this\nrelation, we propose a physical framework where the gradual suppression of a\ngalaxy's star formation activity results from the adjustment to an increase in\nspecific black hole mass and, accordingly, an increase in the amount of\nheating. From this framework, it follows that at least some galaxies with\nintermediate specific black hole masses are in a steady state of partial\nquiescence with intermediate specific star formation rates, implying that both\ntransitioning and steady-state galaxies live within this region known as the\n\"green valley.\" With respect to galaxy formation models, our results present an\nimportant diagnostic with which to test various prescriptions of black hole\nfeedback and its effects on star formation activity.\n", "  We present results from high resolution optical spectra toward 66 young stars\nin the Orion B molecular cloud to study their kinematics and other properties.\nObservations of the H$\\alpha$ and Li I 6707 {\\AA} lines are used to check\nmembership and accretion properties. While the stellar radial velocities of in\nNGC 2068 and L1622 show good agreement with that of the molecular gas, many of\nthe stars in NGC 2024 show a considerable offset. This could be a signature of\neither expansion of the cluster, high degree of the ejection of the stars from\nthe cluster through the dynamical interaction, or the acceleration of the gas\ndue to stellar feedback.\n", "  Neutron stars may sustain a non-axisymmetric deformation due to magnetic\ndistortion and are potential sources of continuous gravitational waves (GWs)\nfor ground-based interferometric detectors. With decades of searches using\navailable GW detectors, no evidence of a GW signal from any pulsar has been\nobserved. Progressively stringent upper limits of ellipticity have been placed\non Galactic pulsars. In this work, we use the ellipticity inferred from the\nputative millisecond magnetars in short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) to estimate\ntheir detectability by current and future GW detectors. For $\\sim 1$ ms\nmagnetars inferred from the SGRB data, the detection horizon is $\\sim 30$ Mpc\nand $\\sim 600$ Mpc for advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET),\nrespectively. Using the ellipticity of SGRB millisecond magnetars as\ncalibration, we estimate the ellipticity and gravitational wave strain of\nGalactic pulsars and magnetars assuming that the ellipticity is\nmagnetic-distortion-induced. We find that the results are consistent with the\nnull detection results of Galactic pulsars and magnetars with the aLIGO O1. We\nfurther predict that the GW signals from these pulsars/magnetars may not be\ndetectable by the currently designed aLIGO detector. The ET detector may be\nable to detect some relatively low frequency signals ($<50$ Hz) from some of\nthese pulsars. Limited by its design sensitivity, the eLISA detector seems not\nsuitable for detecting the signals from Galactic pulsars and magnetars.\n", "  We explore the energetics of the titular reaction, which current\nastrochemical databases consider open at typical dense molecular (i.e., dark)\ncloud conditions. As is common for reactions involving the transfer of light\nparticles, we assume that there are no intersystem crossings of the potential\nenergy surfaces involved. In the absence of any such crossings, we find that\nthis reaction is endoergic and will be suppressed at dark cloud temperatures.\nUpdating accordingly a generic astrochemical model for dark clouds changes the\npredicted gas-phase abundances of 224 species by greater than a factor of 2. Of\nthese species, 43 have been observed in the interstellar medium. Our findings\ndemonstrate the astrochemical importance of determining the role of intersystem\ncrossings, if any, in the titular reaction.\n", "  We report on 3.5 years of Chandra monitoring of the Galactic Centre magnetar\nSGR J1745-2900 since its outburst onset in April 2013. The magnetar spin-down\nhas shown at least two episodes of period derivative increases so far, and it\nhas slowed down regularly in the past year or so. We observed a slightly\nincreasing trend in the time evolution of the pulsed fraction, up to about 55\nper cent in the most recent observations. SGR J1745-2900 has not reached the\nquiescent level yet, and so far the overall outburst evolution can be\ninterpreted in terms of a cooling hot region on the star surface. We discuss\npossible scenarios, showing in particular how the presence of a shrinking hot\nspot in this source is hardly reconcilable with internal crustal cooling and\nfavors the untwisting bundle model for this outburst. Moreover, we also show\nhow the emission from a single uniform hot spot is incompatible with the\nobserved pulsed fraction evolution for any pair of viewing angles, suggesting\nan anisotropic emission pattern.\n", "  The upsilon Andromedae system was the first multi-planet system discovered\norbiting a main sequence star. We describe the detection of water vapor in the\natmosphere of the innermost non-transiting gas giant ups~And~b by treating the\nstar-planet system as a spectroscopic binary with high-resolution, ground-based\nspectroscopy. We resolve the signal of the planet's motion and break the\nmass-inclination degeneracy for this non-transiting planet via deep combined\nflux observations of the star and the planet. In total, seven epochs of Keck\nNIRSPEC $L$ band observations, three epochs of Keck NIRSPEC short wavelength\n$K$ band observations, and three epochs of Keck NIRSPEC long wavelength $K$\nband observations of the ups~And~system were obtained. We perform a multi-epoch\ncross correlation of the full data set with an atmospheric model. We measure\nthe radial projection of the Keplerian velocity ($K_P$ = 55 $\\pm$ 9 km/s), true\nmass ($M_b$ = 1.7 $^{+0.33}_{-0.24}$ $M_J$), and orbital inclination \\big($i_b$\n= 24 $\\pm$ 4$^{\\circ}$\\big), and determine that the planet's opacity structure\nis dominated by water vapor at the probed wavelengths. Dynamical simulations of\nthe planets in the ups~And~system with these orbital elements for ups~And~b\nshow that stable, long-term (100 Myr) orbital configurations exist. These\nmeasurements will inform future studies of the stability and evolution of the\nups~And~system, as well as the atmospheric structure and composition of the hot\nJupiter.\n", "  We present the first four years of BVRI photometry from an on-going survey to\nannually monitor the photometric behavior of evolved luminous stars in M31 and\nM33. Photometry was measured for 199 stars at multiple epochs, including 9\nclassic Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), 22 LBV candidates, 10 post-RGB A/F type\nhypergiants, and 18 B[e] supergiants. At all epochs the brightness is measured\nin V and at least one other band to a precision of 0.04 -- 0.10 magnitudes down\nto a limiting magnitude of 19.0 -- 19.5. Thirty three (33) stars in our survey\nexhibit significant variability, including at least two classic LBVs caught in\nS Doradus type outbursts. A hyper-linked version of the photometry catalog is\nat: http://go.uis.edu/m31m33photcat/.\n", "  We study the chaoticity and the predictability of a turbulent flow on the\nbasis of high-resolution direct numerical simulations at different Reynolds\nnumbers. We find that the Lyapunov exponent of turbulence, which measures the\nexponential separation of two initially close solution of the Navier-Stokes\nequations, grows with the Reynolds number of the flow, with an anomalous\nscaling exponent, larger than the one obtained on dimensional grounds. For\nlarge perturbations, the error is transferred to larger, slower scales where it\ngrows algebraically generating an \"inverse cascade\" of perturbations in the\ninertial range. In this regime our simulations confirm the classical\npredictions based on closure models of turbulence. We show how to link\nchaoticity and predictability of a turbulent flow in terms of a finite size\nextension of the Lyapunov exponent.\n", "  We present a new Bayesian algorithm making use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nsampling that allows us to simultaneously estimate the unknown continuum level\nof each quasar in an ensemble of high-resolution spectra, as well as their\ncommon probability distribution function (PDF) for the transmitted Ly$\\alpha$\nforest flux. This fully automated PDF regulated continuum fitting method models\nthe unknown quasar continuum with a linear Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nbasis, with the PCA coefficients treated as nuisance parameters. The method\nallows one to estimate parameters governing the thermal state of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), such as the slope of the temperature-density\nrelation $\\gamma-1$, while marginalizing out continuum uncertainties in a fully\nBayesian way. Using realistic mock quasar spectra created from a simplified\nsemi-numerical model of the IGM, we show that this method recovers the\nunderlying quasar continua to a precision of $\\simeq7\\%$ and $\\simeq10\\%$ at\n$z=3$ and $z=5$, respectively. Given the number of principal component spectra,\nthis is comparable to the underlying accuracy of the PCA model itself. Most\nimportantly, we show that we can achieve a nearly unbiased estimate of the\nslope $\\gamma-1$ of the IGM temperature-density relation with a precision of\n$\\pm8.6\\%$ at $z=3$, $\\pm6.1\\%$ at $z=5$, for an ensemble of ten mock\nhigh-resolution quasar spectra. Applying this method to real quasar spectra and\ncomparing to a more realistic IGM model from hydrodynamical simulations would\nenable precise measurements of the thermal and cosmological parameters\ngoverning the IGM, albeit with somewhat larger uncertainties given the\nincreased flexibility of the model.\n", "  In this paper, the third in the series, we continue our study of\ncombinatorics in chaotic Newtonian dynamics. We study the chaotic four-body\nproblem in Newtonian gravity assuming finite-sized particles, and we focus on\ninteractions that produce direct collisions between any two stars. Our\nlong-term goal is to construct an equation that gives the probability of a\ngiven collision event occurring over the course of the interaction, as a\nfunction of the total encounter energy and angular momentum as well as the\nnumbers and properties of the particles. In previous papers, we varied the\nnumber of interacting particles and the distribution of particle radii, for all\nequal mass particles. Here, we focus on the effects of different combinations\nof particle masses.\n  We develop an analytic formalism for calculating the time-scales for\ndifferent collision scenarios to occur. Our analytic time-scales reproduce the\nsimulated time-scales when gravitational focusing is included. We present a\nmethod for calculating the relative rates for different types of collisions to\noccur, assuming two different limits for the particle orbits; radial and\ntangential. These limits yield relative collision probabilities that bracket\nthe probabilities we obtain directly from numerical scattering experiments, and\nare designed to reveal important information about the (time-averaged)\ntrajectories of the particles as a function of the interaction parameters.\nFinally, we present a Collision Rate Diagram (CRD), which directly compares the\npredictions of our analytic rates to the simulations and quantifies the quality\nof the agreement. The CRD will facilitate refining our analytic collision rates\nin future work, as we expand in to the remaining parameter space.\n", "  We present a systematic comparison between guided modes supported by slab\nwaveguides and Bloch Surface Waves (BSWs) propagating at the surface of\ntruncated periodic multilayers. We show that, contrary to common belief, the\nbest surface field enhancement achievable for guided modes in a slab waveguide\nis comparable to that observed for BSWs. At the same time, we demonstrate that,\nif one is interested in maximizing the electromagnetic energy density at a\ngeneric point of a dielectric planar structure, BSWs are often preferable to\nmodes in which light is confined uniquely by total internal reflection. Since\nthese results are wavelength independent and have been obtained by considering\na very wide range of refractive indices of the structure constituent materials,\nwe believe they can prove helpful in the design of future structures for the\ncontrol and the enhancement of the light-matter interaction.\n", "  In modern cosmology, determining the Hubble constant (H0) using distance\nladder to percent level and comparing with the results from Planck satellite\ncan shed light on the nature of the dark energy, the physics of neutrino, and\nthe curvature of the universe. Thanks to the endeavor of the SH0ES team, the\nuncertainty of the H0 has be dramatically reduced from 10% to 2.4%, with the\npromise to reach even 1% in the near future. In this regard, it is\nfundamentally important to beat and investigate the systematics. This is best\nbe done with other independent good distance indicators. One of the promising\nmethod is the flux-weighted gravity luminosity relation (FGLR) of the blue\nsupergiants. As the blue supergiants are the brightest objects in the galaxies,\nthey can probe distance up to 10 Mpc, with negligible blending effects. While\nthe FGLR method delivered distance in good agreement with other distance\nindicators, it has been shown that this method delivers larger distance in the\ncase of M33 and NGC 55. Here we investigate whether the M33 distance estimate\nof FGLR suffers systematics from stellar variability. Using CFHT M33 monitoring\ndata, we found 9 out of 22 BSGs showed variability during the course of 500\ndays, however with amplitudes as small as 0.05 magnitudes. This suggests that\nstellar variability plays negligible role in the FGLR distance determination.\n", "  We present axisymmetric numerical simulations of radiatively inefficient\naccretion flows onto black holes combining general relativity,\nmagnetohydrodynamics, self-consistent electron thermodynamics, and\nfrequency-dependent radiation transport. We investigate a range of accretion\nrates up to $10^{-5} \\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$ onto a $10^8 M_{\\odot}$ black hole\nwith spin $a_{\\star} = 0.5$. We report on averaged flow thermodynamics as a\nfunction of accretion rate. We present the spectra of outgoing radiation and\nfind that it varies strongly with accretion rate, from synchrotron-dominated in\nthe radio at low $\\dot{M}$ to inverse Compton-dominated at our highest\n$\\dot{M}$. In contrast to canonical analytic models, we find that by $\\dot{M}\n\\approx 10^{-5} \\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$, the flow approaches $\\sim 1\\%$\nradiative efficiency, with much of the radiation due to inverse Compton\nscattering off Coulomb-heated electrons far from the black hole. These results\nhave broad implications for modeling of accreting black holes across a large\nfraction of the accretion rates realized in observed systems.\n", "  We investigate in more detail the origin of chromospheric Alfven waves that\ngive rise to the separation of ions and neutrals, the First Ionization\nPotential Effect (FIP), through the action of the ponderomotive force. In open\nfield regions, we model the dependence of fractionation on the plasma upflow\nvelocity through the chromosphere for both shear (or planar) and torsional\nAlfven waves of photospheric origin. These differ mainly through their\nparametric coupling to slow mode waves. Shear Alfven waves appear to reproduce\nobserved fractionations for a wider range of model parameters, and present less\nof a \"fine-tuning\" problem than do torsional waves. In closed field regions, we\nstudy the fractionations produced by Alfven waves with photospheric and coronal\norigins. Waves with a coronal origin, at or close to resonance with the coronal\nloop, offer a significantly better match to observed abundances than do\nphotospheric waves, with shear and torsional waves in such a case giving\nessentially indistinguishable fractionations. Such coronal waves are likely the\nresult of a nanoflare coronal heating mechanism, that as well as heating\ncoronal plasmas releases Alfven waves that can travel down to loop footpoints\nand cause FIP fractionation through the ponderomotive force as they reflect\nfrom the chromosphere back into the corona.\n", "  Eos family was created during a catastrophic impact about 1.3 Gyr ago.\nRotation states of individual family members contain information about the\nhistory of the whole population. We aim to increase the number of asteroid\nshape models and rotation states within the Eos collision family, as well as to\nrevise previously published shape models from the literature. Such results can\nbe used to constrain theoretical collisional and evolution models of the\nfamily, or to estimate other physical parameters by a thermophysical modeling\nof the thermal infrared data. We use all available disk-integrated optical data\n(i.e., classical dense-in-time photometry obtained from public databases and\nthrough a large collaboration network as well as sparse-in-time individual\nmeasurements from a few sky surveys) as input for the convex inversion method,\nand derive 3D shape models of asteroids together with their rotation periods\nand orientations of rotation axes. We present updated shape models for 15\nasteroids and new shape model determinations for 16 asteroids. Together with\nthe already published models from the publicly available DAMIT database, we\ncompiled a sample of 56 Eos family members with known shape models that we used\nin our analysis of physical properties within the family. Rotation states of\nasteroids smaller than ~20 km are heavily influenced by the YORP effect, whilst\nthe large objects more or less retained their rotation state properties since\nthe family creation. Moreover, we also present a shape model and bulk density\nof asteroid (423) Diotima, an interloper in the Eos family, based on the\ndisk-resolved data obtained by the Near InfraRed Camera (Nirc2) mounted on the\nW.M. Keck II telescope.\n", "  Observations of Gaia16apd revealed extremely luminous ultraviolet emission\namong superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). Using radiation hydrodynamics\nsimulations we perform a comparison of UV light curves, color temperatures and\nphotospheric velocities between the most popular SLSN models: pair-instability\nsupernova, magnetar and interaction with circumstellar medium. We find that the\ninteraction model is the most promising to explain the extreme UV luminosity of\nGaia16apd. The differences in late-time UV emission and in color evolution\nfound between the models can be used to link an observed SLSN event to the most\nappropriate model. Observations at UV wavelengths can be used to clarify the\nnature of SLSNe and more attention should be paid to them in future follow-up\nobservations.\n", "  We present new optical and near-infrared spectra of WD0137-349; a close white\ndwarf - brown dwarf non-interacting binary system with a period of $\\approx$114\nminutes. We have confirmed the presence of H$\\alpha$ emission and discovered\nHe, Na, Mg, Si, K, Ca, Ti, and Fe emission lines originating from the brown\ndwarf atmosphere. This is the first brown dwarf atmosphere to have been\nobserved to exhibit metal emission lines as a direct result of intense\nirradiation. The equivalent widths of many of these lines show a significant\ndifference between the day and night sides of the brown dwarf. This is likely\nan indication that efficient heat redistribution may not be happening on this\nobject, in agreement with models of hot Jupiter atmospheres. The H$\\alpha$ line\nstrength variation shows a strong phase dependency as does the width. We have\nsimulated the Ca II emission lines using a model that includes the brown dwarf\nRoche geometry and limb darkening and we estimate the mass ratio of the system\nto be 0.135$\\pm$0.004. We also apply a gas-phase equilibrium code using a\nprescribed drift-phoenix model to examine how the chemical composition of the\nbrown dwarf upper atmosphere would change given an outward temperature\nincrease, and discuss the possibility that this would induce a chromosphere\nabove the brown dwarf atmosphere.\n", "  We design a direct test of the local position invariance (LPI) in the\npost-Newtonian gravity, using the timing observation of the triple pulsar, PSR\nJ0337+1715. The test takes advantage of the large gravitational acceleration\nexerted by the outer white dwarf to the inner neutron star -- white dwarf\nbinary. Using machine-precision three-body simulations and dedicated\nMarkov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques with various sampling strategies and\nnoise realizations, we estimate that the Whitehead's parameter could have\nalready been limited to $|\\xi| \\lesssim 0.4$ (95\\% CL), with the published\ntiming data spanning from January 2012 to May 2013. The constraint is still\norders of magnitude looser than the best limit, yet it is able to independently\nfalsify Whitehead's gravity theory where $\\xi=1$. In addition, the new test is\nimmune to extra assumptions and involves full dynamics of a three-body system\nwith a strongly self-gravitating neutron star.\n", "  Suppressing phonon propagation in nanowires is an essential goal towards\nachieving efficient thermoelectric devices. Recent experiments have shown\nunambiguously that surface roughness is a key factor that can reduce the\nthermal conductivity well below the Casimir limit in thin crystalline silicon\nnanowires. We use insights gained from the experimental studies to construct a\nsimple analytically tractable model of the phonon-surface roughness interaction\nthat provides a better theoretical understanding of the effects of surface\nroughness on the thermal conductivity, which could potentially help in\ndesigning better thermoelectric devices.\n", "  Biaxial compression of centimetre-scale graphene, freely standing on the\nsurface of water is studied. Within this platform, we report full stress-strain\ncompression of graphene identifying elastic and plastic deformations. The\nYoung's modulus follows a scaling law and falls two orders of magnitude below\nthe commonly reported values with microscale graphene samples. Such results\nstrongly confirm that graphene - in its very natural form - lacks any intrinsic\nelastic parameters. Different functionalization/manipulation of graphene\nlattice affects the mechanics of graphene differently; particularly the effect\nof the sp3 hybridization and crystalline voids on the yield strength of\ngraphene is explored. Crumpling of graphene is accompanied by gradual\ngeneration and transformation of wrinkles which brings about viscoelasticity in\ngraphene, observed for the first time in this paper. Additionally, we report a\npeculiar correlation between the morphology and the distribution of the strain\nin graphene lattice.\n", "  The R&D mission of the Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment\n(ANNIE) is described in detail. ANNIE is: (1) an important measurement of\nneutrino-nucleus interactions focusing specifically on neutron production, and\n(2) an R&D effort focused on using new photodetector technology and chemical\nadditives to make advanced water-base neutrino detectors. The ANNIE experiment\nconsists of a small Water Cherenkov detector, instrumented with both\nconventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and Large Area Picosecond\nPhotodetectors (LAPPDs) deployed on the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at\nFermilab. The experiment is designed to proceed in two stages: a\npartially-instrumented test-beam run using only PMTs (Phase I) for the purpose\nof measuring critical neutron backgrounds to the experiment; and a physics run\nwith a fully-instrumented detector (Phase II). This paper gives preliminary\nresults of the first phase and described the detector design upgrades necessary\nfor the next phase.\n", "  The magnetic field of CPD -57 3509 was recently detected in the framework of\nthe BOB (B fields in OB stars) collaboration. We acquired low-resolution\nspectropolarimetric observations of CPD -57 3509 with FORS2 and high-resolution\nUVES observations randomly distributed over a few months to search for\nperiodicity, to study the magnetic field geometry, and to determine the surface\ndistribution of silicon and helium. We also obtained supplementary photometric\nobservations at a timeline similar to the spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric\nobservations. A period of 6.36d was detected in the measurements of the mean\nlongitudinal magnetic field. A sinusoidal fit to our measurements allowed us to\nconstrain the magnetic field geometry and estimate the dipole strength in the\nrange of 3.9-4.5kG. Our application of the Doppler imaging technique revealed\nthe presence of He I spots located around the magnetic poles, with a strong\nconcentration at the positive pole and a weaker one around the negative pole.\nIn contrast, high concentration Si III spots are located close to the magnetic\nequator. Further, our analysis of the spectral variability of CPD -57 3509 on\nshort time scales indicates distinct changes in shape and position of line\nprofiles possibly caused by the presence of beta Cep-like pulsations. A small\nperiodic variability in line with the changes of the magnetic field strength is\nclearly seen in the photometric data.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of $P-V$ criticality of the topological\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz(HL) black holes with a spherical horizon $(k=1)$ in the\nextended phase space. With the electric charge, we find that the critical\nbehaviors of the HL black hole are nearly the same as those of van der\nWaals(VdW) system. For the uncharged case, the HL black hole has a peculiar\n$P-V$ criticality. The critical behavior is completely controlled by a\nparameter $\\epsilon$, but not the temperature $T$. When $\\epsilon$ is larger\nthan a critical value $\\epsilon_c$, no matter what the temperature is, there\nwill be the first-order phase transition. Moreover, we find that there is an\ninfinite number of critical points which form a \"critical curve\". As far as we\nknow, this is the first time to find this kind of peculiar $P-V$ criticality.\n", "  We report photometric observations of the trans-Neptunian object\n2004~TT$_{357}$ obtained in 2015 and 2017 using the 4.3~m Lowell's Discovery\nChannel Telescope. We derive a rotational period of 7.79$\\pm$0.01~h and a\npeak-to-peak lightcurve amplitude of 0.76$\\pm$0.03~mag. 2004 TT$_{357}$\ndisplays a large variability that can be explained by a very elongated single\nobject or can be due to a contact/close binary. The most likely scenario is\nthat 2004 TT$_{357}$ is a contact binary. If it is in hydrostatic equilibrium,\nwe find that the lightcurve can be explained by a system with a mass ratio\nq$_{min}$=0.45$\\pm$0.05, and a density of $\\rho_{min}$=2g cm$^{-3}$, or less\nlikely a system with q$_{max}$=0.8$\\pm$0.05, and $\\rho_{max}$=5g cm$^{-3}$.\nConsidering a single triaxial ellipsoid in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a\nlower limit to the density of 0.78g cm$^{-3}$, and an elongation (a/b) of 2.01\nassuming an equatorial view. From Hubble Space Telescope data, we report no\nresolved companion orbiting 2004 TT$_{357}$. Despite an expected high fraction\nof contact binaries in the trans-Neptunian belt, 2001 QG$_{298}$ is the unique\nconfirmed contact binary in the trans-Neptunian belt, and 2004 TT$_{357}$ is\nonly the second candidate to this class of systems, with 2003 SQ$_{317}$.\n", "  Images and spectra recorded with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on\nGemini South are used to investigate the stellar content of the open cluster\nHaffner 16. The (i', g'-i') color-magnitude diagram (CMD) constructed from\nthese data samples the cluster main sequence (MS) and 5 magnitudes of the\npre-MS (PMS). The isochrones do not track the PMS on the CMD, in the sense that\nthe PMS has a shallower slope on the CMD than predicted by the models. Still, a\ndip in star counts that is associated with the relaxation of PMS stars onto the\nMS is identified near i' = 17. The depth and brightness of this feature - as\nwell as the morphology of the cluster MS on the CMD - are matched by models\nwith a slightly sub-solar metallicity that have an age ~ 20 Myr and a distance\nmodulus of 12.3 +/- 0.2. A light profile of Haffner 16 is constructed in the\nWISE W1 filter which suggests that the cluster is surrounded by a diffuse\nstellar halo. Spectra are presented of candidate cluster MS and PMS stars\nselected according to location on the CMD. The spectra show characteristics\nthat are suggestive of a sub-solar metallicity. Halpha emission is common among\nobjects on the PMS locus on the CMD near i' = 18. It is suggested that the\nlocation of the Haffner 16 PMS on the CMD is affected by large-scale cool spot\nactivity, likely induced by rapid stellar rotation.\n", "  The concept of randomness plays an important role in many disciplines. On one\nhand, the question of whether random processes exist is fundamental for our\nunderstanding of nature. On the other hand, randomness is a resource for\ncryptography, algorithms and simulations. Standard methods for generating\nrandomness rely on assumptions on the devices that are difficult to meet in\npractice. However, quantum technologies allow for new methods for generating\ncertified randomness. These methods are known as device-independent because do\nnot rely on any modeling of the devices. Here we review the efforts and\nchallenges to design device-independent randomness generators.\n", "  Possible thunderstorm - sporadic E (Es) layer coupling effects are\ninvestigated during two measurement periods, one in 2013 and one in 2014. The\nanalysis was based on ionospheric observations obtained from a Digisonde at\nPruhonice, the Czech Republic, an ionosonde at Nagycenk, Hungary, and a 3.59\nMHz five-point continuous HF Doppler system located in the western part of the\nCzech Republic. The latter is capable of detecting ionospheric wave-like\nvariations caused by neutral atmospheric waves generated by thunderstorms. The\npresent study searches for possible impacts on Es layers caused by the presence\nof two active thunderstorms: one passing across the Czech Republic on June 20,\n2013 (19:00 - 01:00 LT), and one through Hungary on July 30, 2014 (11:00 -\n01:00 LT). During these two time periods, presence and parameters of Es layer\nwere inferred from ionograms, recorded every minute at Pruhonice and every two\nminutes at Nagycenk, whereas concurrent lightning activity was monitored by the\nLINET detection network. In addition, transient luminous events (TLEs) were\nalso observed during both nights from Sopron, Hungary and from Nydek, the Czech\nRepublic. A noticeable fact was the reduction and disappearance of the ongoing\nEs layer activity during part of the time in both of the traversing\nthunderstorms. The analysis indicated that the critical frequency foEs dropped\nbelow ionosonde detection levels in both cases, possibly because of\nthunderstorm activity effects. This option, however, needs more case studies in\norder to be further substantiated.\n", "  The influence of hydrostatic pressure up to P=1.05 GPa on resistivity R,\nexcess conductivity ${\\sigma}'(T)$ and pseudogap ${\\Delta}*(T)$ is studied in\nslightly doped single crystals of YBa2Cu3O7-${\\delta} (Tc=49.2 K, {\\delta}~\n0.5)$. The critical temperature Tc is found to increase with increasing\npressure at a rate dTc/dP = 5.1 K/GPa, while R(300)K decreases at a rate d(ln\nR)/dP = 0.19% 1/GPa. Near Tc, independently on pressure, the ${\\sigma}'(T)$ is\nwell described by the Aslamasov-Larkin and Hikami-Larkin fluctuation theories,\ndemonstrating a 3D-2D crossover with increase of temperature. The crossover\ntemperature To determines the coherence length along the c-axis ${\\xi}c(0) \\sim\n3.43 A$ at P=0, which is found to decrease with increasing P. At the same time,\nboth, ${\\Delta}*$ and the BCS ratio $2{\\Delta}*/kTc$ increase with increasing\nhydrostatic pressure at a rate $d(ln {\\Delta}*)/dP= 0.36 1/GPa$, implying an\nincrease of the coupling strength with increasing P. At low temperatures below\nTp, the shape of the ${\\Delta}*(T)$ curve is found to be almost independent on\npressure. At high temperatures, the shape of the ${\\Delta}*(T)$ curve changes\nnoticeably with increasing P, suggesting a strong influence of pressure on the\nlattice dynamics. This unusual behavior is observed for the first time.\n", "  Since the pioneering works of Pethig, Grant and Wuthrich on protein hydration\nlayer, many studies have been devoted to find out if there are any general and\nuniversal characteristic features that can distinguish water molecules inside\nthe protein hydration layer from bulk. Given that the surface itself varies\nfrom protein to protein, and that each surface facing the water is\nheterogeneous, search for universal features has been elusive. Here, we perform\natomistic molecular dynamics simulation in order to propose and demonstrate\nthat such defining characteristics can emerge if we look not at average\nproperties but the distribution of relaxation times. We present results of\ncalculations of distributions of residence times and rotational relaxation\ntimes for four different protein-water systems, and compare them with the same\nquantities in the bulk. The distributions in the hydration layer is unusually\nbroad and log-normal in nature, due to the simultaneous presence of peptide\nbackbones that form weak hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic amino acid side chains\nthat form no hydrogen bond and charged polar groups that form strong hydrogen\nbond with the surrounding water molecules. The broad distribution is\nresponsible for the non-exponential dielectric response and also agrees with\nlarge specific heat of the hydration water. Our calculations reveal that while\nthe average time constant is just about 2-3 times larger than that of bulk\nwater, it provides a poor representation of the real behaviour. In particular,\nthe average leads to the erroneous conclusion that water in the hydration layer\nis bulk-like. However, the observed and calculated lower value of static\ndielectric constant of hydration layer remained difficult to reconcile with the\nbroad distribution observed in dynamical properties. We offer a plausible\nexplanation of these unique properties.\n", "  Infrared radiation emitted from a planet contains information about the\nchemical composition and vertical temperature profile of its atmosphere. If\nupper layers are cooler than lower layers, molecular gases will produce\nabsorption features in the planetary thermal spectrum. Conversely, if there is\na stratosphere - where temperature increases with altitude - these molecular\nfeatures will be observed in emission. It has been suggested that stratospheres\ncould form in highly irradiated exoplanets, but the extent to which this occurs\nis unresolved both theoretically and observationally. A previous claim for the\npresence of a stratosphere remains open to question, owing to the challenges\nposed by the highly variable host star and the low spectral resolution of the\nmeasurements. Here we report a near-infrared thermal spectrum for the ultrahot\ngas giant WASP-121b, which has an equilibrium temperature of approximately\n2,500 kelvin. Water is resolved in emission, providing a detection of an\nexoplanet stratosphere at 5-sigma confidence. These observations imply that a\nsubstantial fraction of incident stellar radiation is retained at high\naltitudes in the atmosphere, possibly by absorbing chemical species such as\ngaseous vanadium oxide and titanium oxide.\n", "  Diffusion of dopants in rutile is the fundamental process that determines the\nperformance of many devices in which rutile is used. The diffusion behavior is\nknown to be highly sample-dependent, but the reasons for this are less well\nunderstood. Here, rutile is studied by using first-principles calculations, in\norder to unravel the microscopic origins of the diverse diffusion behaviors for\ndifferent doping elements. Anomalous diffusion behavior in the open channel\nalong [001] direction is found: larger atoms include Sc and Zr have lower\nenergy barrier for diffusion via interstitial mechanism, apparently\ncontradicting their known slow diffusion rate. To resolve this, we present an\nalternate model for the overall diffusion rate of the large-size dopants in\nrutile, showing that parallel to the [001] channel, it is limited by the\nformation of the interstitial states, whereas in the direction perpendicular to\n[001], it proceeds via a kick-out mechanism. By contrast, Co and Ni, prefer to\nstay in the interstitial site of rutile, and have conventional diffusion with a\nvery small migration barrier in the [001] channel. This leads to highly\nanisotropic and fast diffusion. The diffusion mechanisms found in the present\nstudy can explain the diffusion data measured by experiments, and these\nfindings provide novel understanding for the classic diffusion topic.\n", "  We study well-posedness of a velocity-vorticity formulation of the\nNavier--Stokes equations, supplemented with no-slip velocity boundary\nconditions, a no-penetration vorticity boundary condition, along with a natural\nvorticity boundary condition depending on a pressure functional. In the\nstationary case we prove existence and uniqueness of a suitable weak solution\nto the system under a small data condition. The topic of the paper is driven by\nrecent developments of vorticity based numerical methods for the Navier--Stokes\nequations.\n", "  In this study we investigate 89 radio galaxies that are\nspectroscopically-confirmed to be members of five large scale structures in the\nredshift range of $0.65 \\le z \\le 0.96$. Based on a two-stage classification\nscheme, the radio galaxies are classified into three sub-classes: active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN), hybrid, and star-forming galaxy (SFG). We study the\nproperties of the three radio sub-classes and their global and local\nenvironmental preferences. We find AGN hosts are the most massive population\nand exhibit quiescence in their star-formation activity. The SFG population has\na comparable stellar mass to those hosting a radio AGN but are unequivocally\npowered by star formation. Hybrids, though selected as an intermediate\npopulation in our classification scheme, were found in almost all analyses to\nbe a unique type of radio galaxies rather than a mixture of AGN and SFGs. They\nare dominated by a high-excitation radio galaxy (HERG) population. We discuss\nenvironmental effects and scenarios for each sub-class. AGN tend to be\npreferentially located in locally dense environments and in the cores of\nclusters/groups, with these preferences persisting when comparing to galaxies\nof similar colour and stellar mass, suggesting that their activity may be\nignited in the cluster/group virialized core regions. Conversely, SFGs exhibit\na strong preference for intermediate-density global environments, suggesting\nthat dusty starbursting activity in LSSs is largely driven by galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions and merging.\n", "  Questions play a prominent role in social interactions, performing rhetorical\nfunctions that go beyond that of simple informational exchange. The surface\nform of a question can signal the intention and background of the person asking\nit, as well as the nature of their relation with the interlocutor. While the\ninformational nature of questions has been extensively examined in the context\nof question-answering applications, their rhetorical aspects have been largely\nunderstudied.\n  In this work we introduce an unsupervised methodology for extracting surface\nmotifs that recur in questions, and for grouping them according to their latent\nrhetorical role. By applying this framework to the setting of question sessions\nin the UK parliament, we show that the resulting typology encodes key aspects\nof the political discourse---such as the bifurcation in questioning behavior\nbetween government and opposition parties---and reveals new insights into the\neffects of a legislator's tenure and political career ambitions.\n", "  In the present paper, the material parameters of the isotropic relaxed\nmicromorphic model derived for a specific metamaterial in a previous\ncontribution are used to model its transmission properties. Specifically, the\nreflection and transmission coefficients at an interface between a homogeneous\nsolid and the chosen metamaterial are analyzed by using both the relaxed\nmicromorphic model and a direct FEM implementation of the detailed\nmicrostructure. The obtained results show an excellent agreement between the\ntransmission spectra derived via our enriched continuum model and those issued\nby the direct FEM simulation. Such excellent agreement validates the indirect\nmeasure of the material parameters and opens the way towards an efficient\nmeta-structural design.\n", "  We consider Berry's random planar wave model (1977) for a positive Laplace\neigenvalue $E>0$, both in the real and complex case, and prove limit theorems\nfor the nodal statistics associated with a smooth compact domain, in the\nhigh-energy limit ($E\\to \\infty$). Our main result is that both the nodal\nlength (real case) and the number of nodal intersections (complex case) verify\na Central Limit Theorem, which is in sharp contrast with the non-Gaussian\nbehaviour observed for real and complex arithmetic random waves on the flat\n$2$-torus, see Marinucci et al. (2016) and Dalmao et al. (2016). Our findings\ncan be naturally reformulated in terms of the nodal statistics of a single\nrandom wave restricted to a compact domain diverging to the whole plane. As\nsuch, they can be fruitfully combined with the recent results by Canzani and\nHanin (2016), in order to show that, at any point of isotropic scaling and for\nenergy levels diverging sufficently fast, the nodal length of any Gaussian\npullback monochromatic wave verifies a central limit theorem with the same\nscaling as Berry's model. As a remarkable byproduct of our analysis, we\nrigorously confirm the asymptotic behaviour for the variances of the nodal\nlength and of the number of nodal intersections of isotropic random waves, as\nderived in Berry (2002).\n", "  Direct comparison of areal and profile roughness measurement values is not\nadvisable due to fundamental differences in the measurement techniques. However\nresearchers may wish to compare between laboratories with differing equipment,\nor against literature values. This paper investigates how well the profile\narithmetic mean average roughness, $R_a$, approximates its areal equivalent\n$S_a$. Simulated rough surfaces and samples from the ETOPO1 global relief model\nwere used. The mean of up to 20 $R_a$ profiles from the surface were compared\nwith surface $S_a$ for 100 repeats. Differences between $\\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$\nfell as the number of $R_a$ values averaged increased. For simulated surfaces\nmean % difference between $\\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$ was in the range 16.06% to\n3.47% when only one $R_a$ profile was taken. By averaging 20 $R_a$ values mean\n% difference fell to 6.60% to 0.81%. By not considering $R_a$ profiles parallel\nto the main feature direction (identified visually), mean % difference was\nfurther reduced. For ETOPO1 global relief surfaces mean % difference was in the\nrange 52.09% to 22.60% when only one $R_a$ value was used, and was 33.22% to\n9.90% when 20 $R_a$ values were averaged. Where a surface feature direction\ncould be identified, accounting for reduced the difference between $\\bar{R_a}$\nand $S_a$ by approximately 5% points. The results suggest that taking the mean\nof between 3 and 5 $R_a$ values will give a good estimate of $S_a$ on regular\nor simple surfaces. However, for some complex real world surfaces discrepancy\nbetween $\\bar{R_a}$ and $S_a$ are high. Caveats including the use of filters\nfor areal and profile measurements, and profile alignment are discussed.\n", "  We have investigated the electronic structure of charged bilayer and trilayer\nphoshporene using first-principles, density-functional-theory calculations. We\nfind that the effective dielectric constant for an external electric field\napplied perpendicular to phosphorene layers increases with the charge density\nand is twice as large as in an undoped system if the electron density is around\n$5\\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$. It is known that if few-layer phosphorene is placed\nunder such an electric field, the electron band gap decreases and if the\nstrength of the electric field is further increased, the band gap closes. We\nshow that the electronic screening due to added charge carriers reduces the\namount of this reduction in the band gap and increases the critical strength of\nthe electric field for gap closure. If the electron density is around\n$4\\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$, for example, this critical field for trilayer\nphosphorene is 40\\% higher than that for a charge-neutral system. The results\nare directly relevant to experiments on few-layer phosphorene with top and\nbottom electrical gates and / or with chemical dopants.\n", "  In this paper we study new cosmological models involving new forms of\nnon-gravitational interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy. The\nmain purpose is to demonstrate the applicability of the forms of interaction to\nthe problem in modern cosmology known as accelerated expansion of the large\nscale universe. It is well known, that a non-gravitational interaction can\nimprove theoretical prediction, but a fundamental theory allowing to derive the\nform of the interaction is missing. Therefore, an active sought to find a\ncorrect form of the interaction from various phenomenological assumptions is\nstill one of the active branches of research in modern cosmology. Besides\ncosmographic analysis, we perform $Om$ analysis.\n", "  We have derived background corrected intensities of 3-50 MeV galactic\nelectrons observed by Voyager 1 as it passes through the heliosheath from 95 to\n122 AU. The overall intensity change of the background corrected data from the\ninner to the outer boundary of the heliosheath is a maximum of a factor ~100 at\n15 MeV. At lower energies this fractional change becomes less and the corrected\nelectron spectra in the heliosheath becomes progressively steeper, reaching\nvalues ~ -2.5 for the spectral index just outside of the termination shock. At\nhigher energies the spectra of electrons has an exponent changing from the\nnegative LIS spectral index of -1.3 to values approaching zero in the\nheliosheath as a result of the solar modulation of the galactic electron\ncomponent. The large modulation effects observed below ~100 MV are possible\nevidence for enhanced diffusion as part of the modulation process for electrons\nin the heliosheath.\n", "  To make the investigation of electronic structure of incommensurate\nheterostructures computationally tractable, effective alternatives to Bloch\ntheory must be developed. In Massatt2017, we developed and analyzed a real\nspace scheme that exploits spatial ergodicity and near-sightedness. In the\npresent work, we present an analogous scheme formulated in momentum space,\nwhich we prove have significant computational advantages in specific\nincommensurate systems of physical interest, e.g., bilayers of a specified\nclass of materials with small rotation angles. We use our theoretical analysis\nto obtain estimates for improved rates of convergence with respect to total CPU\ntime for our momentum space method that are confirmed in computational\nexperiments.\n", "  In this paper, a systematic synthesis approach is proposed for achieving\nnegative group delay responses using lossy coupling matrix. It is\nmathematically proved that, for a passive and reciprocal network, loss is the\nnecessary condition to realize a negative group delay. Also, the optimum\nstrategy is to place zeros and poles of the transfer function both on the left\ncomplex plane. A closed-form relation between the group delay and magnitude is\nthen derived based on this strategy, and followed by a complete synthesis\napproach using coupling matrix. Two numerical and one experimental examples are\nfinally given to illustrate the proposed synthesis method.\n", "  Using the Hubbard representation for $SU(2)$ we write the time-evolution\noperator of a two-level system in the disentangled form. This allows us to map\nthe corresponding dynamical law into a set of non-linear coupled equations. In\norder to find exact solutions, we use an inverse approach and find families of\ntime-dependent Hamiltonians whose off-diagonal elements are connected with the\nErmakov equation. The physical meaning of the so-obtained Hamiltonians is\ndiscussed in the context of the nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon\n", "  We report analytic results on quantum capacitance (C$_{q}$) measurements and\ntheir optical tuning in dual-gated device with potassium-doped multi-layered\nblack phosphorous (BP) as the channel material. The two-dimensional (2D)\nlayered BP is highly anisotropic with a semi-Dirac dispersion marked by linear\nand quadratic contributions. The C$_{q}$ calculations mirror this asymmetric\narrangement. A further increase to the asymmetry and consequently C$_{q}$ is\npredicted by photon-dressing the BP dispersion. To achieve this and tune\nC$_{q}$ in a field-effect transistor (FET), we suggest a configuration wherein\na pair of electrostatic (top) and optical (back) gates clamp a BP channel. The\nback gate shines an optical pulse to rearrange the dispersion of the 2D BP.\nAnalytic calculations are done with Floquet Hamiltonians in the off-resonant\nregime. The value of such C$_{q}$ calculations, in addition, to its role in\nadjusting the current drive of an FET is discussed in context of\nmetal-insulator and topological phase transitions and enhancements to the\nthermoelectric figure of merit.\n", "  Literature on the modeling and simulation of complex adaptive systems (cas)\nhas primarily advanced vertically in different scientific domains with\nscientists developing a variety of domain-specific approaches and applications.\nHowever, while cas researchers are inher-ently interested in an\ninterdisciplinary comparison of models, to the best of our knowledge, there is\ncurrently no single unified framework for facilitating the development,\ncomparison, communication and validation of models across different scientific\ndomains. In this thesis, we propose first steps towards such a unified\nframework using a combination of agent-based and complex network-based modeling\napproaches and guidelines formulated in the form of a set of four levels of\nusage, which allow multidisciplinary researchers to adopt a suitable framework\nlevel on the basis of available data types, their research study objectives and\nexpected outcomes, thus allowing them to better plan and conduct their\nrespective re-search case studies.\n", "  By introducing a new mechanism based on purely imaginary conjugate\nmetamaterials (PICMs), we reveal that bidirectional negative refraction and\nplanar focusing can be obtained using a pair of PICMs, which is a breakthrough\nto the unidirectional limit in parity time (PT) symmetric systems. Compared\nwith PT symmetric systems that require two different kinds of materials, the\nproposed negative refraction can be realized with only two identical media. In\naddition, asymmetric excitation with bidirectional total transmission is\nobserved in our PICM system. Therefore, a new way to realize negative\nrefraction is presented, with more properties than those in PT symmetric\nsystems.\n", "  Agent Based Models are very popular in a number of different areas. For\nexample, they have been used in a range of domains ranging from modeling of\ntumor growth, immune systems, molecules to models of social networks, crowds\nand computer and mobile self-organizing networks. One reason for their success\nis their intuitiveness and similarity to human cognition. However, with this\npower of abstraction, in spite of being easily applicable to such a wide number\nof domains, it is hard to validate agent-based models. In addition, building\nvalid and credible simulations is not just a challenging task but also a\ncrucial exercise to ensure that what we are modeling is, at some level of\nabstraction, a model of our conceptual system; the system that we have in mind.\nIn this paper, we address this important area of validation of agent based\nmodels by presenting a novel technique which has broad applicability and can be\napplied to all kinds of agent-based models. We present a framework, where a\nvirtual overlay multi-agent system can be used to validate simulation models.\nIn addition, since agent-based models have been typically growing, in parallel,\nin multiple domains, to cater for all of these, we present a new single\nvalidation technique applicable to all agent based models. Our technique, which\nallows for the validation of agent based simulations uses VOMAS: a Virtual\nOverlay Multi-agent System. This overlay multi-agent system can comprise\nvarious types of agents, which form an overlay on top of the agent based\nsimulation model that needs to be validated. Other than being able to watch and\nlog, each of these agents contains clearly defined constraints, which, if\nviolated, can be logged in real time. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show\nits broad applicability in a wide variety of simulation models ranging from\nsocial sciences to computer networks in spatial and non-spatial conceptual\nmodels.\n", "  We introduce a quantum thermodynamic system that can operate as a thermal\nclock in analogy with the thermal clock first introduced by Ernst Mach in which\nthe temperature difference between cooling bodies in contact can be used as a\nkind of relational time. Our model is based on an optomechanical system in\nwhich photons are transferred irreversibly between two cavities due to the\nmodulation of the cavity cooling rate by a mechanical system coupled to a heat\nbath. We contrast the ensemble average view with a single system view using the\ntheory of continuous measurement and we show that, by making a weak continuous\nmeasurement of the energy difference between the systems, a natural Mach\nthermal clock arises in an appropriate semiclassical limit. We investigate how\nquantum fluctuations modify this result.\n", "  The structural description for the intriguing link between the fast\nvibrational dynamics and slow diffusive dynamics in glass-forming systems is\none of the most challenging issues in physical science. Here, in a model of\nmetallic supercooled liquid, we find that local connectivity as an atomic-level\nstructural order parameter tunes the short-time vibrational excitations of the\nicosahedrally coordinated particles and meanwhile modulates their long-time\nrelaxation dynamics changing from stretched to compressed exponentials,\ndenoting a dynamic transition from subdiffusive to hyperdiffusive motions of\nsuch particles. Our result indicates that long-time dynamics has an\natomic-level structural origin which is related to the short-time dynamics,\nthus suggests a structural bridge to link the fast vibrational dynamics and the\nslow structural relaxation in glassy materials.\n", "  We report on the transition from magnetic edge to electric edge transport in\na split magnetic gate device which applies a notch magnetic field to a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas. The gate bias allows tuning the overlap of\nmagnetic and electric edge wavefunctions on the scale of the magnetic length.\nConduction at magnetic edges - in the 2D-bulk - is found to compete with\nconduction at electric edges until magnetic edges become depleted. Current\nlines then move to the electrostatic edges as in the conventional quantum Hall\npicture. The conductivity was modelled using the quantum Boltzmann equation in\nthe exact hybrid potential. The theory predicts the features of the bulk-edge\ncross-over in good agreement with experiment.\n", "  The effect of temperature on the evolution of the isovector dipole and\nisoscalar quadrupole excitations in $^{68}$Ni and $^{120}$Sn nuclei is studied\nwithin the fully self-consistent finite temperature quasiparticle random phase\napproximation framework, based on the Skyrme-type SLy5 energy density\nfunctional. The new low-energy excitations emerge due to the transitions from\nthermally occupied states to the discretized continuum at finite temperatures,\nwhereas the isovector giant dipole resonance is not strongly impacted by the\nincrease of temperature. The radiative dipole strength at low-energies is also\ninvestigated for the $^{122}$Sn nucleus, becoming compatible with the available\nexperimental data when the temperature is included. In addition, both the\nisoscalar giant quadrupole resonance and low-energy quadrupole states are\nsensitive to the temperature effect: while the centroid energies decrease in\nthe case of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance, the collectivity of the\nfirst $2^{+}$ state is quenched and the opening of new excitation channels\nfragments the low-energy strength at finite temperatures.\n", "  Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent convection in a large aspect-ratio\nbox are carried out in the range of Rayleigh number $7 \\times 10^4 \\le Ra \\le 2\n\\times 10^6$ at Prandtl number Pr=0.71. A strong correlation between the\nvertical velocity and temperature is observed in the turbulent regime at almost\nall the length scales. Frequency spectra of all the velocities and temperature\nshow a $-5/3$ law for a wide band of frequencies. The variances of horizontal\nvelocities at different points in the flow yield a single power-law.\nProbability density functions of velocities and temperature are close to\nGaussian only at higher Rayleigh numbers. The mean and variance of temperature\nclearly show boundary layers, surface layers and a near-homogeneous bulk\nregion. The boundary layer thickness decreases and bulk-homogeneity is enhanced\non increasing the Rayleigh numbers. The wave number spectra of the turbulent\nkinetic energy exhibit Kolmogorov like ($E(k)\\sim k^{-5/3}$) and\nBolginao-Obukhov like ($E(k)\\sim k^{-11/5}$) behaviour respectively in the\ncentral and near-wall regions of the container. An approximate balance between\nthe production due to buoyancy and the dissipation is found in the turbulent\nkinetic energy budget. Taylor's approximate equation of the production due to\nturbulent stretching and the dissipation of turbulent enstrophy is modified by\nthe inclusion of buoyancy production in the enstrophy budget. The present\nresults support the previously proposed $2/7$ power-law dependence of the\naverage Nusselt number on the Rayleigh number by yielding an exponent of 0.272,\nbut do not necessarily support the proposed classification of \"soft\" and \"hard\"\nturbulence on the basis of this exponent.\n", "  We investigated electronic structure and magnetic anisotropy in the Fe/MgO\ninterface of magnetic metal and dielectric insulator under the Cr layer of\nsmall electronegativity, by means of the first-principles density functional\napproach. The result indicates that the interface resonance state gets occupied\nunlike a typical rigid band picture as the number of Fe layers decreases,\nfinding large perpendicular anisotropies in the oscillating behavior for\nthickness dependence. We discuss scenarios of the two dimensional van Hove\nsingularity associated with flat band dispersions, and also the accuracies of\nanisotropy energy in comparison with the available experimental data.\n", "  It was recently realized that Planck-scale momentum-space curvature, which is\nexpected in some approaches to the quantum-gravity problem, can produce\ndual-curvature lensing, a feature which mainly affects the direction of\nobservation of particles emitted by very distant sources. Several gray areas\nremain in our understanding of dual-curvature lensing, including the\npossibility that it might be just a coordinate artifact and the possibility\nthat it might be in some sense a by product of the better studied\ndual-curvature redshift. We stress that data reported by the IceCube neutrino\ntelescope should motivate a more vigorous effort of investigation of\ndual-curvature lensing, and we observe that studies of the recently proposed\n\"$\\rho$-Minkowski noncommutative spacetime\" could be valuable from this\nperspective. Through a dedicated $\\rho$-Minkowski analysis, we show that\ndual-curvature lensing is not merely a coordinate artifact and that it can be\npresent even in theories without dual-curvature redshift.\n", "  Family members' life course tendencies to remain geographically close to each\nother or to migrate due to education or job opportunities have been studied\nrelatively little. Here we investigate migration patterns of parents and their\nchildren between 19 administrative regions of Finland from 1970 to 2012. Using\nthe FinnFamily register dataset of 60 000 index individuals and their family\nmembers, we investigate the patterns of regional migration and regional\nco-residence of parents and their children. Specifically, we analyse how likely\nit is for children to reside in the same region as their parents at any\nspecific age, whether parents and children who live in different regions are\nlikely to reunite, and whether siblings function as regional attractors to each\nother. Results show an intense regional migration of people to the capital\narea. The migration propensity of individuals is high in early childhood and\npeaks in early adulthood. About two thirds of Finnish children live in the same\nregion as their parents throughout their adult lives. Females show higher\npropensity to migrate than males, since daughters move away from their parents\nearlier and with a higher rate than sons do. The propensity for two full\nsibling brothers to be in the same region is higher than that for other types\nof sibling dyads. We conclude that family members serve as important\ngeographical attractors to each other through the life course and that family\nattraction is stronger for sons and brothers than for daughters and sisters in\ncontemporary Finland.\n", "  In the first part of the thesis we construct models, called integrable, in\nwhich we can perform exact computations of physical quantities. We introduce\nseveral new out-of-equilibrium models that are obtained by solving, in specific\ncases, the Yang-Baxter equation and the reflection equation. We provide new\nalgebraic structures which allow us to construct the solutions through a\nBaxterisation procedure. In the second part of the thesis we compute exactly\nthe stationary state of these models using a matrix ansatz. We shed light on\nthe connection between this technique and the integrability of the model by\npointing out two key relations: the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev relation and the\nGhoshal-Zamolodchikov relation. The integrability is also exploited, through\nthe quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, to compute the fluctuations of\nthe particles current, unrevealing connections with the theory of symmetric\npolynomials (the Koornwinder polynomials in particular). Finally the last part\nof the thesis deals with the hydrodynamic limit of the models, i.e when the\nlattice spacing tends to zero and the number of particles tends to infinity.\nThe exact results obtained for a finite size system allow us to check the\nvalidity of the predictions of the macroscopic fluctuations theory (concerning\nthe fluctuations of the current and the density profile in the stationary\nstate) and to extend the theory to systems with several species of particles.\n", "  Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) have\nmeasured the value of the Planck constant to be $h =6.626\\,069\\,934(89)\\times\n10^{-34}\\,$J$\\,$s (relative standard uncertainty $13\\times 10^{-9}$). The\nresult is based on over 10$\\,$000 weighings of masses with nominal values\nranging from 0.5$\\,$kg to 2$\\,$kg with the Kibble balance NIST-4. The\nuncertainty has been reduced by more than twofold relative to a previous\ndetermination because of three factors: (1) a much larger data set than\npreviously available, allowing a more realistic, and smaller, Type A\nevaluation; (2) a more comprehensive measurement of the back action of the\nweighing current on the magnet by weighing masses up to 2$\\,$kg, decreasing the\nuncertainty associated with magnet non-linearity; (3) a rigorous investigation\nof the dependence of the geometric factor on the coil velocity reducing the\nuncertainty assigned to time-dependent leakage of current in the coil.\n", "  It has been reported that a 5.7sigma directional muon excess coincident with\nthe 2000 July 14 solar flare was registered by the L3 precision muon\nspectrometer [Ruiguang Wang, Astroparticle Phys., 31(2009) 149]. Using a same\nanalysis method and similar criteria of event selection, we have analyzed the\nL3 precision muon spectrometer data during November 2000. The result shows that\na 4.7sigma muon excess appeared at a time coincident with the solar flare of 8\nof November 2000. This muon excess corresponds to above 40 GeV primary protons\nwhich came from a sky cell of solid angle 0.048 sr. The probability of being a\nbackground fluctuation is estimated to be about 0.1%. It has been convinced\nthat solar protons could be accelerated to tens of GeV in those Class X solar\nflares which usually arose solar cosmic ray ground level enhancement (GLE)\nevents. However, whether a Class M solar flare like the non-GLE event of 8\nNovember 2000 may also accelerate solar protons to such high energies? It is\ninteresting and noteworthy.\n", "  Elucidating the physics of a concentrated suspension of ring polymers, or of\nan ensemble of ring polymers in a complex environment, is an important\noutstanding question in polymer physics. Many of the characteristic features of\nthese systems arise due to topological interactions between polymers, or\nbetween the polymers and the environment, and it is often challenging to\ndescribe this quantitatively. Here we review recent research which suggests\nthat a key role is played by inter-ring threadings (or penetrations), which\nbecome more abundant as the ring size increases. As we discuss, the physical\nconsequences of such threadings are far-reaching: for instance, they lead to a\ntopologically-driven glassy behaviour of ring polymer melts under pinning\nperturbations, while they can also account for the shape of experimentally\nobserved patterns in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of DNA knots.\n", "  The radio detection method for cosmic rays relies on coherent emission from\nelectrons and positrons which is beamed in a narrow cone along the shower axis.\nCurrently the only mod- els to reproduce this emission with sufficient accuracy\nare Monte Carlo based simulations of the particle and radio emission physics,\nwhich require large investments of computation time. The work presented here\nfocuses on condensing the simulation results into a semi-analytical model. This\nrelies on building a framework based on theoretical predictions of radio\nemission, but instead of calculating the radio signal directly these models are\nused to map template simu- lations to the specifications of a given radio\nevent. Our current approach slices the radio signal based on atmospheric depth\nof origin and weights these slices based on a shower parameter such as electron\nnumber or an effective dipole moment. One significant gain over the existing\nMonte Carlo codes lies in the fact this makes the depth of the shower maximum a\ndirect input to the simulation where currently one has to pre-select showers\nbased on their random number seed. Such a model has great potential for heavily\nsimulation-based analysis methods, for example the LOFAR air shower\nreconstruction. These techniques are severely limited by the available\ncomputation time but have the lowest errors in real measurement applications.\n", "  The work is devoted to the investigation of properties of water vapor. The\nmain attention is focused on the physical nature of its effective\npolarizability and heat capacity at constant volume. We show that the specific\ntemperature dependencies of these characteristics are mainly caused by thermal\nvibration excitations of water dimers. In connection with this we determine\nnormal coordinates for the dimer vibrations. We investigate fluctuations of the\ndipole moments of dimers in details and consider their contributions to the\ndielectric permittivity of the water vapor. We also took into account the\ncontribution of the interparticle interactions on the heat capacity. Analyzing\nthe behavior of the effective polarizability and heat capacity we defined the\ntemperature dependence of the dimer concentration on the coexistence\nvapor-liquid curve. The noticeable dimerization in the saturated water vapor\ntakes place only for temperatures T/Tc > 0.8 (Tc is the critical temperature).\nIt is important to note that the successful reproduction of the effective\npolarizability and heat capacity can serve good test for the correct\ndescription of the dimer concentration in different approaches.\n", "  Complex vector light fields, classically entangled in polarization and phase,\nhave become ubiquitous in a wide variety of research fields. This has triggered\nthe demonstration of a wide variety of generation techniques. Of particular\nrelevance are those based on computer-controlled devices due to their great\nflexibility. More specifically, spatial light modulators have demonstrated that\nalmost any vector beam, with various spatial profiles and polarization\ndistributions can be generated. Crucially, none of these techniques has proven\ncapable to generate multiple vector beams simultaneously. Here, we put forward\na novel technique that exploits the superposition principle in optics to enable\nthe simultaneous generation of many vector beams using a single digital\nhologram. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrated the simultaneous generation of\ntwenty vector vortex beams with various polarization distributions and spatial\nshapes on a single SLM, each of which with their own spatial shape and\npolarization distribution.\n", "  We have investigated proton acceleration in the forward direction from a\nnear-critical density hydrogen gas jet target irradiated by a high intensity\n(10^18 W/cm^2), short-pulse (5 ps) laser with wavelength of 1.054 micron. We\nobserve the signature of shock acceleration driven by the laser pulse, leading\nto monoenergetic proton beams with small divergence in addition to the commonly\nused electron-sheath driven proton acceleration. The proton energies we\nobtained are modest (~MeV), but prospects for improvement are offered through\ntailoring the gas jet density profile. Also, we observe that this mechanism is\nvery robust in producing those beams and thus can be considered as a future\ncandidate in laser-driven ion sources driven by the upcoming next generation of\nmulti-PW near-infrared lasers.\n", "  A monolayer of transition metal trichalcogenides has received a lot of\nattention as potential two dimensional magnetic materials. The system has a\nhoneycomb structure of transition metal ions, where both spin-orbit coupling\nand electron correlation effect play an important role. Here, motivated by\nthese transition metal series with effective doping or mixed valence case, we\npropose the possible realization of magnetic Chern insulators at quarter filled\nhoneycomb lattice. We show that the interplay of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling\nand electron correlation opens a wide region of ferromagnetic Chern insulating\nphases in between metals and normal insulators. Within the mean field\napproximation, we present the phase diagram of a quarter filled Kane-Mele\nHubbard model and also discuss the effects of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and\nnearest neighbor interactions on it.\n", "  We present low-temperature measurements of low-loss superconducting\nnanowire-embedded resonators in the low-power limit relevant for quantum\ncircuits. The superconducting resonators are embedded with superconducting\nnanowires with widths down to 20nm using a neon focused ion beam. In the\nlow-power limit, we demonstrate an internal quality factor up to 3.9x10^5 at\n300mK [implying a two-level-system-limited quality factor up to 2x10^5 at 10\nmK], not only significantly higher than in similar devices but also matching\nthe state of the art of conventional Josephson-junction-embedded resonators. We\nalso show a high sensitivity of the nanowire to stray infrared photons, which\nis controllable by suitable precautions to minimize stray photons in the sample\nenvironment. Our results suggest that there are excellent prospects for\nsuperconducting-nanowire-based quantum circuits.\n", "  Semileptonic $b \\rightarrow s\\ell \\ell$ processes constitute a good probe for\nnew physics phenomena: new particles contributing to the loops could affect\nbranching fractions and angular distributions, and have different couplings to\ndifferent lepton families, thus violating lepton flavour universality.\n  Recent results from the LHCb experiment are reviewed.\n", "  These lectures give a basic introduction to $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and\nthe integrability of its planar spectral problem as seen from the perspective\nof a recent development, namely the application of integrability techniques in\nthe study of one-point functions in a defect version of the theory.\n", "  Accretion dynamics in the forming of young stars is still object of debate\nbecause of limitations in observations and modelling. Through scaled laboratory\nexperiments of collimated plasma accretion onto a solid in the presence of a\nmagnetic field, we open first window on this phenomenon by tracking, with\nspatial and temporal resolution, the dynamics of the system and simultaneously\nmeasuring multiband emissions. We observe in these experiments that matter,\nupon impact, is laterally ejected from the solid surface, then refocused by the\nmagnetic field toward the incoming stream. Such ejected matter forms a plasma\nshell that envelops the shocked core, reducing escaped X-ray emission. This\ndemonstrates one possible structure reconciling current discrepancies between\nmass accretion rates derived from X-ray and optical observations.\n", "  As novel topological phases in correlated electron systems, we have found two\nexamples of non-ferromagnetic states that exhibit a large anomalous Hall\neffect. One is the chiral spin liquid compound Pr$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$, which\nexhibits a spontaneous Hall effect in a spin liquid state due to spin ice\ncorrelation. The other is the chiral antiferromagnets Mn$_{3}$Sn and Mn$_{3}$Ge\nthat exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect at room temperature. The latter\nshows a sign change of the anomalous Hall effect by a small change in the\nmagnetic field by a few 100 G, which should be useful for various applications.\nWe will discuss that the magnetic Weyl metal states are the origin for such a\nlarge anomalous Hall effect observed in both the spin liquid and\nantiferromagnet that possess almost no magnetization.\n", "  A new type of proton acceleration stemming from large-scale gradients,\nlow-density targets, irradiated by an intense near-infrared laser is observed.\nThe produced protons are characterized by high-energies (with a broad\nspectrum), are emitted in a very directional manner, and the process is\nassociated to relaxed laser (no need for high-contrast) and target (no need for\nultra-thin or expensive targets) constraints. As such, this process appears\nquite effective compared to the standard and commonly used Target Normal Sheath\nAcceleration technique (TNSA), or more exploratory mechanisms like Radiation\nPressure Acceleration (RPA). The data are underpinned by 3D numerical\nsimulations which suggest that in these conditions Low Density Collisionless\nShock Acceleration (LDCSA) is at play, which combines an initial Collisionless\nShock Acceleration (CSA) to a boost procured by a TNSA-like sheath field in the\ndownward density ramp of the target, which leads to an overall broad spectrum.\nExperiments performed at 10^20 W/cm^2 laser intensity show that LDCSA can\naccelerate, from ~1% critical density, mm-scale targets, up to 5x10^9\nprotons/MeV/sr/J with energies up to 45(+/- 5) MeV in a collimated (~6$^\\circ$\nhalf-angle) manner.\n", "  I discuss two points concerning recent Brackett series spectra of SS 433. The\nfirst is that outbursts to red and blue episodic in the Balmer series are now\nshown to be episodic in the far infrared Brackett series. The second point is\nthat while in quiet times the Brackett profiles are characteristic of a disk\nrotating at ~ 200 km/s, such a disk is not the accretion disk and it should not\nbe claimed that these profiles require a compact object mass less than 2.2\nsolar masses.\n", "  Historically, noise in superconducting circuits has been considered an\nobstacle to be removed. A large fraction of the research effort in designing\nsuperconducting circuits has focused on noise reduction, with great success, as\ncoherence times have increased by four orders of magnitude in the past two\ndecades. However, noise and dissipation can never be fully eliminated, and\nfurther, a rapidly growing body of theoretical and experimental work has shown\nthat carefully tuned noise, in the form of engineered dissipation, can be a\nprofoundly useful tool in designing and operating quantum circuits. In this\narticle, I review important applications of engineered dissipation, including\nstate generation, state stabilization, and autonomous quantum error correction,\nwhere engineered dissipation can mitigate the effect of intrinsic noise,\nreducing logical error rates in quantum information processing. Further, I\nprovide a pedagogical review of the basic noise processes in superconducting\nqubits (photon loss and phase noise), and argue that any dissipative mechanism\nwhich can correct photon loss errors is very likely to automatically suppress\ndephasing. I also discuss applications for quantum simulation, and possible\nfuture research directions.\n", "  We present a recently developed projector quantum Monte Carlo method for\ncalculations of electronic structure in systems with spin-orbit interactions.\nThe method solves for many-body eigenstates in the presence of spin-orbit using\nthe fixed-phase approximation.The trial wave function is built from\ntwo-component spinors and explicit Jastrow correlation factors while the core\nelectrons are eliminated by relativistic effective core potentials with\nexplicit spin-orbit terms. We apply this method to WO and W$_2$ molecules that\nenable us to build multi-reference wave functions and analyze in detail the\nimpact of both electron correlations and of spin-orbit terms. These\ndevelopments open new opportunities for calculations of systems with\nsignificant spin-orbit effects by many-body quantum Monte Carlo methods.\n", "  In this paper we analytically study the recurrence equations of an Ising\nmodel with three competing interactions on a Cayley tree of order three. We\nexactly describe paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of the Ising model. We\nobtain some rigorous results: critical temperatures and curves, number of\nphases, partition function. Ganikhodjaev et al. [J. Concrete and Applicable\nMathematics, 9 (1), 26-34 (2011)] have numerically studied the Ising model on a\nsecond-order Cayley tree. We compare the numerical results to exact solutions\nof mentioned model.\n"]}
