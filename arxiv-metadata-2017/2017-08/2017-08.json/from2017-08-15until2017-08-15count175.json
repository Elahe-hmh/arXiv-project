The model\nrepresents the acoustic energy dissipated in terms of Rayleigh dissipation\nfunctional that depends on the local strain rate. We show that the nature of\nthe peel front exhibits rich spatiotemporal patterns ranging from smooth,\nrugged and stuck-peeled configurations that depend on three parameters, namely,\nthe ratio of inertial time scale of the tape mass to that of the roller, the\ndissipation coefficient and the pull velocity. The stuck-peeled configurations\nare reminiscent of fibrillar peel front patterns observed in experiments. We\nshow that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force\nfunction, the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature of the\npeel front and its dynamical evolution. Even though the acoustic energy is a\nfully dynamical quantity, it can be quite noisy for a certain set of parameter\nvalues suggesting the deterministic origin of acoustic emission in experiments.\nTo verify this suggestion, we have carried out a dynamical analysis of\nexperimental acoustic emission time series for a wide range of traction\nvelocities. Our analysis shows an unambiguous presence of chaotic dynamics\nwithin a subinterval of pull speeds within the intermittent regime. Time series\nanalysis of the model acoustic energy signals is also found to be chaotic\nwithin a subinterval of pull speeds.\n", "  In this article, we prove a joint large deviation principle in $n$ for the\n\\emph{empirical pair measure} and \\emph{ empirical offspring measure} of\ncritical multitype Galton-Watson trees conditioned to have exactly $n$ vertices\nin the weak topology. From this result we extend the large deviation principle\nfor the empirical pair measures of Markov chains on simply generated trees to\ncover offspring laws which are not treated by \\cite[Theorem~2.1]{DMS03}.\n  For the case where the offspring law of the tree is a geometric distribution\nwith parameter \\sfrac{1}{2}, we get an exact rate function. All our rate\nfunctions are expressed in terms of relative entropies.\n", "  For lattice systems of statistical mechanics satisfying a Lee-Yang property\n(i.e., for which the Lee-Yang circle theorem holds), we present a simple proof\nof analyticity of (connected) correlations as functions of an external magnetic\nfield h, for Re h > 0 or Re h < 0. A survey of models known to have the\nLee-Yang property is given. We conclude by describing various applications of\nthe aforementioned analyticity in h.\n", "  Depending on the value of the Higgs mass, the Standard Model acquires an\nunstable region at large Higgs field values due to RG running of couplings,\nwhich we evaluate at 2-loop order. For currently favored values of the Higgs\nmass, this renders the electroweak vacuum only meta-stable with a long\nlifetime. We argue on statistical grounds that the Higgs field would be highly\nunlikely to begin in the small field meta-stable region in the early universe,\nand thus some new physics should enter in the energy range of order, or lower\nthan, the instability scale to remove the large field unstable region. We\nassume that Peccei-Quinn (PQ) dynamics enters to solve the strong CP problem\nand, for a PQ-scale in this energy range, may also remove the unstable region.\nWe allow the PQ-scale to scan and argue, again on statistical grounds, that its\nvalue in our universe should be of order the instability scale, rather than\n(significantly) lower. Since the Higgs mass determines the instability scale,\nwhich is argued to set the PQ-scale, and since the PQ-scale determines the\naxion properties, including its dark matter abundance, we are led to a\ncorrelation between the Higgs mass and the abundance of dark matter. We find\nthe correlation to be in good agreement with current data.\n", "  Present data prefer a large but non-maximal 2-3 mixing in the lepton sector.\nWe argue that this value, in connection with $\\sin\\theta_{13}\\simeq 0.15$, is\nthe generic outcome of minimal flavour structures. We present a few different\nincarnations of this statement, in terms of lepton mass matrices depending on a\nsmall number of parameters, that can be justified by discrete flavour\nsymmetries. We also propose a general procedure to study the correlation\nbetween $\\theta_{23}$, the absolute scale and ordering of the neutrino masses,\nand the leptonic CP-violating phases.\n", "  We propose a formally completely integrable extension of heat hierarchy based\non the space of symmetries isomorphic to the Weyl algebra $\\mathcal{A}_1$. The\nextended heat hierarchy will be the basic model for the analysis of the\nextension of KP hierarchy, and other integrable equations.\n", "  We develop a theory of self-resonance after inflation. We study a large class\nof models involving multiple scalar fields with an internal symmetry. For\nillustration, we often specialize to dimension 4 potentials, but we derive\nresults for general potentials. This is the first part of a two part series of\npapers. Here in Part 1 we especially focus on the behavior of long wavelengths\nmodes, which are found to govern most of the important physics. Since the\ninflaton background spontaneously breaks the time translation symmetry and the\ninternal symmetry, we obtain Goldstone modes; these are the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes. We find general conditions on the potential for when a\nlarge instability band exists for these modes at long wavelengths. For the\nadiabatic mode, this is determined by a sound speed derived from the time\naveraged potential. While for the isocurvature mode, this is determined by a\nspeed derived from a time averaged auxiliary potential. Interestingly, we find\nthat this instability band usually exists for one of these classes of modes,\nrather than both simultaneously. We focus on backgrounds that evolve radially\nin field space, as setup by inflation, and also mention circular orbits, as\nrelevant to Q-balls. In Part 2 [1] we derive the central behavior from the\nunderlying description of many particle quantum mechanics, and introduce a weak\nbreaking of the symmetry to study corrections to particle-antiparticle\nproduction from preheating.\n", "  We further develop a theory of self-resonance after inflation in a large\nclass of models involving multiple scalar fields. We concentrate on inflaton\npotentials that carry an internal symmetry, but also analyze weak breaking of\nthis symmetry. This is the second part of a two part series of papers. Here in\nPart 2 we develop an understanding of the resonance structure from the\nunderlying many particle quantum mechanics. We begin by a small amplitude\nanalysis, which obtains the central resonant wave numbers, and relate it to\nperturbative processes. We show that the dominant resonance structure is\ndetermined by (i) the nonrelativistic scattering of many quantum particles and\n(ii) the application of Bose-Einstein statistics to the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, as introduced in Part 1 [1]. Other resonance structure is\nunderstood in terms of annihilations and decays. We setup Bunch-Davies vacuum\ninitial conditions during inflation and track the evolution of modes including\nHubble expansion. In the case of a complex inflaton carrying an internal U(1)\nsymmetry, we show that when the isocurvature instability is active, the\ninflaton fragments into separate regions of \\phi-particles and\nanti-\\phi-particles. We then introduce a weak breaking of the U(1) symmetry;\nthis can lead to baryogenesis, as shown by some of us recently [2,3]. Then\nusing our results, we compute corrections to the particle-antiparticle\nasymmetry from this preheating era.\n", "  We study the large-volume-$L$ limit of form factors of the longitudinal spin\noperators for the XXZ spin-$1/2$ chain in the massive regime. We find that the\nindividual form factors decay as $L^{-n}$, $n$ being an even integer counting\nthe number of physical excitations -- the holes -- that constitute the excited\nstate. Our expression allows us to derive the form-factor expansion of\ntwo-point spin-spin correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit\n$L\\rightarrow +\\infty$. The staggered magnetisation appears naturally as the\nfirst term in this expansion. We show that all other contributions to the\ntwo-point correlation function are exponentially small in the large-distance\nregime.\n", "  We present what is probably the simplest classical system featuring the echo\nphenomenon - a collection of randomly oriented free rotors with dispersed\nrotational velocities. Following excitation by a pair of time-delayed impulsive\nkicks, the mean orientation/alignment of the ensemble exhibits multiple echoes\nand fractional echoes. We elucidate the mechanism of the echo formation by\nkick-induced filamentation of phase space, and provide the first experimental\ndemonstration of classical alignment echoes in a thermal gas of CO_2 molecules\nexcited by a pair of femtosecond laser pulses.\n", "  Large liquid argon detectors have become widely used in low rate experiments,\nincluding dark matter and neutrino research. However, the optical properties of\nliquid argon are not well understood at the large scales relevant for current\nand near-future detectors.The index of refraction of liquid argon at the scin-\ntillation wavelength has not been measured, and current Rayleigh scattering\nlength calculations disagree with measurements. Furthermore, the Rayleigh\nscattering length and index of refraction of solid argon and solid xenon at\ntheir scintillation wavelengths have not been previously measured or\ncalculated. We introduce a new calculation using existing data in liquid and\nsolid argon and xenon to extrapolate the optical properties at the\nscintillation wavelengths using the Sellmeier dispersion relationship.\n", "  We consider the spectrum of correlation lengths of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ\nchain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime. These are given as ratios of\neigenvalues of the quantum transfer matrix of the model. The eigenvalues are\ndetermined by integrals over certain auxiliary functions and by their zeros.\nThe auxiliary functions satisfy nonlinear integral equations. We analyse these\nnonlinear integral equations in the low-temperature limit. In this limit we can\ndetermine the auxiliary functions and the expressions for the eigenvalues as\nfunctions of a finite number of parameters which satisfy finite sets of\nalgebraic equations, the so-called higher-level Bethe Ansatz equations. The\nbehaviour of these equations, if we send the temperature $T$ to zero, is\ndifferent for zero and non-zero magnetic field $h$. If $h$ is zero the\nsituation is much like in the case of the usual transfer matrix. Non-trivial\nhigher-level Bethe Ansatz equations remain which determine certain complex\nexcitation parameters as functions of hole parameters which are free on a line\nsegment in the complex plane. If $h$ is non-zero, on the other hand, a\nremarkable restructuring occurs, and all parameters which enter the description\nof the quantum transfer matrix eigenvalues can be interpreted entirely in terms\nof particles and holes which are freely located on two curves when $T$ goes to\nzero.\n", "  We investigate the phase transition in a non-planar correlated percolation\nmodel with long-range dependence, obtained by considering level sets of a\nGaussian free field with mass above a given height $h$. The dependence present\nin the model is a notorious impediment when trying to analyze the behavior near\ncriticality. Alongside the critical threshold $h_{*}$ for percolation, a second\nparameter $h_{**} \\geq h_{*}$ characterizes a strongly subcritical regime. We\nprove that the relevant crossing probabilities converge to $1$ polynomially\nfast below $h_{**}$, which (firmly) suggests that the phase transition is\nsharp. A key tool is the derivation of a suitable differential inequality for\nthe free field that enables the use of a (conditional) influence theorem.\n", "  In this work we present a security analysis for quantum key distribution,\nestablishing a rigorous tradeoff between various protocol and security\nparameters for a class of entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure protocols.\nThe goal of this paper is twofold: 1) to review and clarify the\nstate-of-the-art security analysis based on entropic uncertainty relations, and\n2) to provide an accessible resource for researchers interested in a security\nanalysis of quantum cryptographic protocols that takes into account finite\nresource effects. For this purpose we collect and clarify several arguments\nspread in the literature on the subject with the goal of making this treatment\nlargely self-contained.\n  More precisely, we focus on a class of prepare-and-measure protocols based on\nthe Bennett-Brassard (BB84) protocol as well as a class of entanglement-based\nprotocols similar to the Bennett-Brassard-Mermin (BBM92) protocol. We carefully\nformalize the different steps in these protocols, including randomization,\nmeasurement, parameter estimation, error correction and privacy amplification,\nallowing us to be mathematically precise throughout the security analysis. We\nstart from an operational definition of what it means for a quantum key\ndistribution protocol to be secure and derive simple conditions that serve as\nsufficient condition for secrecy and correctness. We then derive and eventually\ndiscuss tradeoff relations between the block length of the classical\ncomputation, the noise tolerance, the secret key length and the security\nparameters for our protocols. Our results significantly improve upon previously\nreported tradeoffs.\n", "  We study the behavior of a simple string bit model at finite temperature. We\nuse thermal perturbation theory to analyze the high temperature regime. But at\nlow temperatures we rely on the large $N$ limit of the dynamics, for which the\nexact energy spectrum is known. Since the lowest energy states at infinite $N$\nare free closed strings, the $N=\\infty$ partition function diverges above a\nfinite temperature $\\beta_H^{-1}$, the Hagedorn temperature. We argue that in\nthese models at finite $N$, which then have a finite number of degrees of\nfreedom, there can be neither an ultimate temperature nor any kind of phase\ntransition. We discuss how the discontinuous behavior seen at infinite $N$ can\nbe removed at finite $N$. In this resolution the fundamental string bit degrees\nof freedom become more active at temperatures near and above the Hagedorn\ntemperature.\n", "  In this paper, Kaluza-Klein theory is revisited and its implications are\nelaborated. We show that electromagnetic 4-potential can be considered as a\nshearing-like deformation of a 5-dimensional (5D) manifold along the fifth\n(5th) axis. The charge-to-mass ratio has a physical meaning of the ratio\nbetween the movement along the direction of the 5th axis and the movement in\nthe 4D space-time. In order to have a 5D matter which is consistent with the\nconstruction of the 5D manifold, a notion of particle-thread is suggested.\nExaminations on the compatibility of reference frames reveal a covariance\nbreaking of the 5th dimension. The field equations which extend Einstein's\nfield equations give the total energy-momentum tensor as a sum of that of\nmatter, electromagnetic field, and the interaction between electric current and\nelectromagnetic potential. Finally, the experimental implications are\ncalculated for the weak potential case.\n", "  We study the coupling between Majorana bound states (CMBS), which is mediated\nby a topologically trivial chain in the presence of pairing coupling and\nlong-range coupling. The results show that CMBS can be enhanced by the pairing\ncoupling and long-range coupling of the trivial chain. When driving the trivial\nchain by periodic driving field, we deduce the analytical expressions of CMBS\nin the high-frequency limit, and demonstrate that CMBS can be modulated by the\nfrequency and amplitude of driving field. Finally we exhibit the application of\ntunable CMBS in realizing quantum logic gates.\n", "  We analyze the long-time large-distance asymptotics of the longitudinal\ncorrelation functions of the Heisenberg-Ising chain in the easy-axis regime. We\nshow that in this regime the leading asymptotics of the dynamical two-point\nfunctions is entirely determined by the two-spinon contribution to their form\nfactor expansion. Its explicit form is obtained from a saddle-point analysis of\nthe corresponding double integral. It describes the propagation of a wave front\nwith velocity $v_{c_1}$ which is found to be the maximal possible group\nvelocity. Like in wave propagation in dispersive media the wave front is\npreceded by a precursor running ahead with velocity $v_{c_2}$. As a special\ncase we obtain the explicit form of the asymptotics of the auto-correlation\nfunction.\n", "  Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is commonly formulated in terms of\nwavefunctions (probability amplitudes) obeying the static and the\ntime-dependent Schroedinger equations (SE). Despite the success of this\nrepresentation of the quantum world a wave-particle duality concept is required\nto reconcile the theory with observations (experimental measurements). A first\nsolution to this dichotomy was introduced in the de Broglie-Bohm theory\naccording to which a pilot wave (solution of the SE) is guiding the evolution\nof particle trajectories. Here, I propose a geometrization of quantum mechanics\nthat describes the time evolution of particles as geodesic lines in a curved\nspace, whose curvature is induced by the quantum potential. This formulation\nallows therefore the incorporation of all quantum effects into the geometry of\nspace-time, as it is the case for gravitation in the general relativity.\n", "  Dirac particle dynamics is encoded as a unitary path summation rule and\nimplemented on a qubit array, where the qubit array represents both spacetime\nand the fermions contained therein. The unitary path summation rule gives a\nquantum algorithm to model a many-body system of Dirac particles in a gauge\nfield with Lorentz invariance down to the grid scale (Planck scale)--the\nlattice-based model neither suffers the Fermi-sign problem nor breaks Lorentz\ninvariance. Yet, for the Dirac Hamiltonian to generate the unitary evolution of\nthe 4-spinor field at the Planck scale, there is time dilation between the\nshortest observable time near a single space point and that time measured at\nlong-wavelength scales. We find gravitational time dilation where the model\nspace around each point (with an even number of qubits) is curved like the\nspace around a Schwarzschild black hole.\n", "  Long-lived optical quantum memories are of great importance for scalable\ndistribution of entanglement over remote networks (e.g. quantum repeaters).\nLong-lived storage generally relies on storing the optical states as spin\nexcitations since these often exhibit long coherence times. To extend the\nstorage time beyond the intrinsic spin dephasing time one can use dynamical\ndecoupling techniques. However, it has been shown that dynamical decoupling\nintroduces noise in optical quantum memories based on ensembles of atoms. In\nthis article a simple model is proposed to calculate the resulting\nsignal-to-noise ratio, based on intrinsic quantum memory parameters such as the\noptical depth of the ensemble. We also characterize several dynamical\ndecoupling sequences that are efficient in reducing this particular noise. Our\ncalculations indicate that it should be feasible to reach storage times well\nbeyond one second under reasonable experimental conditions.\n", "  Correlation functions of ferromagnetic spin systems satisfying a Lee-Yang\nproperty are studied. It is shown that, for classical systems in a\nnon-vanishing uniform external magnetic field $h$, the connected correlation\nfunctions decay exponentially in the distances between the spins, i.e., the\ninverse correlation length (\"mass gap\"), $m(h)$, is strictly positive. Our\nproof is very short and transparent and is valid for complex values of the\nexternal magnetic field $h$, provided that $\\text{Re} \\, h \\not= 0$. It implies\na mean-field lower bound on $m(h)$, as $h \\searrow 0$, first established by\nLebowitz and Penrose for the Ising model. Our arguments also apply to some\nquantum spin systems.\n", "  We present a systematic study of spin and lattice dynamics in the\nquasi-one-dimensional spiral magnet CuBr2, using Raman scattering in\nconjunction with infrared and neutron spectroscopy. Along with the development\nof spin correlations upon cooling, we observe a rich set of broad Raman bands\nat energies that correspond to phonon-dispersion energies near the\none-dimensional magnetic wave vector. The low-energy bands further exhibit a\ndistinct intensity maximum at the spiral magnetic ordering temperature. We\nattribute these unusual observations to two possible underlying mechanisms: (1)\nformation of hybrid spin-lattice excitations, and/or (2) \"quadrumerization\" of\nthe lattice caused by spin-singlet entanglement in competition with the spiral\nmagnetism.\n", "  We discuss the science drivers for ALMA Band 2 which spans the frequency\nrange from 67 to 90 GHz. The key science in this frequency range are the study\nof the deuterated molecules in cold, dense, quiescent gas and the study of\nredshifted emission from galaxies in CO and other species. However, Band 2 has\na range of other applications which are also presented. The science enabled by\na single receiver system which would combine ALMA Bands 2 and 3 covering the\nfrequency range 67 to 116 GHz, as well as the possible doubling of the IF\nbandwidth of ALMA to 16 GHz, are also considered.\n", "  We report the observation of fractional echoes in a double-pulse excited\nnonlinear system. Unlike standard echoes which appear periodically at delays\nwhich are integer multiple of the delay between the two exciting pulses, the\nfractional echoes appear at rational fractions of this delay. We discuss the\nmechanism leading to this phenomenon, and provide the first experimental\ndemonstration of fractional echoes by measuring third harmonic generation in a\nthermal gas of CO2 molecules excited by a pair of femtosecond laser pulses.\n", "  A fractional Fick's law and fractional hydrostatics for the one dimensional\nexclusion process with long jumps in contact with infinite reservoirs at\ndifferent densities on the left and on the right are derived.\n", "  In this work we find the minimal extension of the Standard Model's Higgs\nsector which can lead to a light Higgs boson via radiative symmetry breaking\nand is consistent with the phenomenological requirements for a low-energy\nrealization of a conformal theory. The model which turns out to be stable under\nrenormalization group translations is an extension of the Standard Model by two\nscalar fields, one of which acquires a finite vacuum expectation value and\ntherefore mixes into the physical Higgs. We find that the minimal model\npredicts a sizable amount of mixing which makes it testable at a collider. In\naddition to the physical Higgs, the theory's scalar spectrum contains one light\nand one heavy boson. The heavy scalar's properties render it a potential dark\nmatter candidate.\n", "  It is straightforward to give a sum-over-paths expression for the transition\namplitudes of a quantum circuit as long as the gates in the circuit are\nbalanced, where to be balanced is to have all nonzero transition amplitudes of\nequal magnitude. Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits,\nthe relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration\nspace can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for\ncontinuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum\ncircuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are\ncontinuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These\ntypes of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that\nserve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the\nphase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate\nin the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space\nand to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two\ncopies of the configuration space. For discrete systems, the latter association\nis achieved using tools from algebraic geometry. Finally, we show that if the\naction functional for a discrete-time path through a sequence of gates is\ndefined using the sum of the corresponding generating functions, then it yields\nthe correct relative phases for the path-sum expression. These results are\nlikely to be relevant for quantizing physical theories where time is\nfundamentally discrete, characterizing the classical limit of discrete-time\nquantum dynamics, and proving complexity results for quantum circuits.\n", "  The electromagnetic form factors and low-energy observables of deuteron are\nstudied with the help of the light-front approach, where the deuteron is\nregarded as a weekly bound state of a proton and a neutron. Both the $S-$ and\n$D-$wave interacting vertexes among deuteron, proton, and neutron are taken\ninto account. Moreover, the regularization functions are also introduced. In\nour calculations, the vertex and the regularization functions are employed to\nsimulate the momentum distribution inside the deuteron. Our numerical results\nshow that the light-front approach can roughly reproduce the deuteron\nelectromagnetic form factors, like charge $G_0$, magnetic $G_1$, and quadrupole\n$G_2$, in the low $Q^2$ region. The important role of the $D-$wave vertex on\n$G_2$ is also addressed.\n", "  Thermal recovery of irradiated uranium dioxide lattice have been investigated\nby experimental groups and defects related to each recovery stages are\nestimated based on the indirect observations like activation energies. In this\nstudy, thermal recovery mechanisms of both neutron and alpha-particle\nirradiated uranium dioxide lattice is investigated by atomistic simulation\nmethods. Isochronal and isothermal annealing have been applied to the\nirradiated samples. Following the same procedures of the experimental groups,\nactivation energies are calculated with molecular dynamics simulations and\ncompared with empirical data which show a good agreement. Migration energy\nbarrier and the recovery energies of the obstruction type defects are\ncalculated with molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory.\nRecovery stages of the irradiated crystals are discussed however unlike the\npredictions of the most experimental groups, it is shown that neutron and\nalpha-particle irradiated crystal structures do not thermally recover for the\nsame reason. All three recovery stages of neutron irradiated uranium dioxide\ncrystal is attributed to oxygen interstitials while the three recovery stages\nof the alpha-particle irradiated crystals is considered to the oxygen -\nuranium, uranium and uranium interstitial defects respectively. Finally, the\nreason and the main driving force of thermal recovery of irradiated crystals is\nthe obstruction type defects which give a lead to all other types of defects\nrecover with themselves in each lattice recovery stages.\n", "  The cross section for coherent J/psi photoproduction accompanied by at least\none neutron on one side of the interaction point and no neutron activity on the\nother side, X[n]0[n], is measured with the CMS experiment in ultra-peripheral\nPbPb collisions at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV. The analysis is based on a data\nsample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 159 inverse microbarns,\ncollected during the 2011 PbPb run. The J/psi mesons are reconstructed in the\ndimuon decay channel, while neutrons are detected using zero degree\ncalorimeters. The measured cross section is dsigma[coh,X[n]0[n]] / dy(J/psi) =\n0.36 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (syst) mb in the rapidity interval 1.8 < abs(y) <\n2.3. Using a model for the relative rate of coherent photoproduction processes,\nthis X[z,n,z] measurement gives a total coherent photoproduction cross section\nof dsigma[coh] / dy(J/psi) = 1.82 +/- 0.22 (stat) +/- 0.20 (syst) +/- 0.19\n(theo) mb. The data strongly disfavour the impulse approximation model\nprediction, indicating that nuclear effects are needed to describe coherent\nJ/psi photoproduction in gamma + Pb interactions. The data are found to be\nconsistent with the leading twist approximation, which includes nuclear gluon\nshadowing.\n", "  We investigate the role of inter-orbital fluctuations in the low energy\nphysics of a quasi-1D material - lithium molybdenum purple bronze (LMO). It is\nan exceptional material that may provide us a long sought realization of a\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) physics, but its behaviour at temperatures of\nthe order of $T^*\\approx 30$K remains puzzling despite numerous efforts. Here\nwe make a conjecture that the physics around $T^*$ is dominated by\nmulti-orbital excitations. Their properties can be captured using an excitonic\npicture. Using this relatively simple model we compute fermionic Green's\nfunction in the presence of excitons. We find that the spectral function is\nbroadened with a Gaussian and its temperature dependence acquires an extra\n$T^1$ factor. Both effects are in perfect agreement with experimental findings.\nWe also compute the resistivity for temperatures above and below critical\ntemperature $T_o$. We explain an upturn of the resistivity at 28K and interpret\nthe suppression of this extra component of resistivity when a magnetic field is\napplied along the conducting axis. Furthermore, in the framework of our model,\nwe qualitatively discuss and consistently explain other experimentally detected\npeculiarities of purple bronze: the breaking of Wiedmann-Franz law and the\nmagnetochromatic behaviour.\n", "  We present general conditions for quantum error suppression for\nHamiltonian-based quantum computation using subsystem codes. This involves\nencoding the Hamiltonian performing the computation using an error detecting\nsubsystem code and the addition of a penalty term that commutes with the\nencoded Hamiltonian. The scheme is general and includes the stabilizer\nformalism of both subspace and subsystem codes as special cases. We derive\nperformance bounds and show that complete error suppression results in the\nlarge penalty limit. To illustrate the power of subsystem-based error\nsuppression, we introduce fully 2-local constructions for protection of the\nswap gate of adiabatic gate teleportation and the Ising chain in a transverse\nfield.\n", "  Two-particle pseudorapidity correlations are measured in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$\n= 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV $p$+Pb, and $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13\nTeV $pp$ collisions at the LHC, with total integrated luminosities of\napproximately 7 $\\mu\\mathrm{b}^{-1}$, 28 $\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$, and 65\n$\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$, respectively. The correlation function $C_{\\rm\nN}(\\eta_1,\\eta_2)$ is measured as a function of event multiplicity using\ncharged particles in the pseudorapidity range $|\\eta|<2.4$. The correlation\nfunction contains a significant short-range component, which is estimated and\nsubtracted. After removal of the short-range component, the shape of the\ncorrelation function is described approximately by $1+\\langle{a_1^2}\\rangle\n\\eta_1\\eta_2$ in all collision systems over the full multiplicity range. The\nvalues of $\\sqrt{\\langle{a_1^2}\\rangle}$ are consistent between the\nopposite-charge pairs and same-charge pairs, and for the three collision\nsystems at similar multiplicity. The values of $\\sqrt{\\langle{a_1^2}\\rangle}$\nand the magnitude of the short-range component both follow a power-law\ndependence on the event multiplicity. The $\\eta$ distribution of the\nshort-range component, after symmetrizing the proton and lead directions in\n$p$+Pb collisions, is found to be smaller than that in $pp$ collisions with\ncomparable multiplicity.\n", "  We study the Felderhof free-fermion six-vertex model, whose wavefunction\nrecently turned out to possess rich combinatorial structure of the Schur\npolynomials. We investigate the dual version of the wavefunction in this paper,\nwhich seems to be a harder object to analyze. We evaluate the dual wavefunction\nin two ways. First, we give the exact correspondence between the dual\nwavefunction and the Schur polynomials, for which two proofs are given. Next,\nwe make a microscopic analysis and express the dual wavefunction in terms of\nstrict Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern. As a consequence of these two ways of\nevaluation of the dual wavefunction, we obtain a dual version of the Tokuyama\ncombinatorial formula for the Schur polynomials. We also give a generalization\nof the correspondence between the dual wavefunction of the Felderhof model and\nthe factorial Schur polynomials.\n", "  We present an efficient discontinuous Galerkin scheme for simulation of the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations including laminar and turbulent flow. We\nconsider a semi-explicit high-order velocity-correction method for time\nintegration as well as nodal equal-order discretizations for velocity and\npressure. The non-linear convective term is treated explicitly while a linear\nsystem is solved for the pressure Poisson equation and the viscous term. The\nkey feature of our solver is a consistent penalty term reducing the local\ndivergence error in order to overcome recently reported instabilities in\nspatially under-resolved high-Reynolds-number flows as well as small time\nsteps. This penalty method is similar to the grad-div stabilization widely used\nin continuous finite elements. We further review and compare our method to\nseveral other techniques recently proposed in literature to stabilize the\nmethod for such flow configurations. The solver is specifically designed for\nlarge-scale computations through matrix-free linear solvers including efficient\npreconditioning strategies and tensor-product elements, which have allowed us\nto scale this code up to 34.4 billion degrees of freedom and 147,456 CPU cores.\nWe validate our code and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with laminar\nflows present in a vortex problem and flow past a cylinder and show\napplicability of our solver to direct numerical simulation as well as implicit\nlarge-eddy simulation of turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\\tau}=180$ as well as\n$590$.\n", "  We study equilibria in domains with boundaries for a first-order aggregation\nmodel that includes social interactions and exogenous forces. Such equilibrium\nsolutions can be connected or disconnected, the latter consisting in a delta\nconcentration on the boundary and a free swarm component in the interior of the\ndomain. Equilibria are stationary points of an energy functional, and stable\nconfigurations are local minimizers of this functional. We find a one-parameter\nfamily of disconnected equilibrium configurations which are not energy\nminimizers; the only stable equilibria are the connected states. Nevertheless,\nwe demonstrate that in certain cases the dynamical evolution, along the\ngradient flow of the energy functional, tends to overwhelmingly favour the\nformation of (unstable) disconnected equilibria.\n", "  The Polyakov$-$Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model has been quite successful in\ndescribing various qualitative features of observables for strongly interacting\nmatter, that are measurable in heavy-ion collision experiments. The question\nstill remains on the quantitative uncertainties in the model results. Such an\nestimation is possible only by contrasting these results with those obtained\nfrom first principles using the lattice QCD framework. Recently a variety of\nlattice QCD data were reported in the realistic continuum limit. Here we make a\nfirst attempt at reparametrizing the model so as to reproduce these lattice\ndata. We find excellent quantitative agreement for the equation of state.\nCertain discrepancies in the charge and strangeness susceptibilities as well as\nbaryon-charge correlation still remain. We discuss their causes and outline\npossible directions to remove them.\n", "  We use the out-of-time-order (OTO) correlators to study the slow dynamics in\nthe many-body localized (MBL) phase. We investigate OTO correlators in the\neffective (\"l-bit\") model of the MBL phase, and show that their amplitudes\nafter disorder averaging approach their long-time limits as power-laws of time.\nThis power-law dynamics is due to dephasing caused by interactions between the\nlocalized operators that fall off exponentially with distance. The long-time\nlimits of the OTO correlators are determined by the overlaps of the local\noperators with the conserved l-bits. We demonstrate numerically our results in\nthe effective model and three other more \"realistic\" spin chain models.\nFurthermore, we extend our calculations to the thermal phase and find that for\na time-independent Hamiltonian, the OTO correlators also appear to vanish as a\npower law at long time, perhaps due to coupling to conserved densities. In\ncontrast, we find that in the thermal phase of a Floquet spin model with no\nconserved densities the OTO correlator decays exponentially at long times.\n", "  We study the nature of and approach to thermal equilibrium in isolated\nquantum systems. An individual isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure or\nmixed state is regarded as being in thermal equilibrium if all macroscopic\nobservables assume rather sharply the values obtained from thermodynamics. Of\nsuch a system (or state) we say that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium\n(MATE). A stronger requirement than MATE is that even microscopic observables\n(i.e., ones referring to a small subsystem) have a probability distribution in\nagreement with that obtained from the micro-canonical, or equivalently the\ncanonical, ensemble for the whole system. Of such a system we say that it is in\nmicroscopic thermal equilibrium (MITE). The distinction between MITE and MATE\nis particularly relevant for systems with many-body localization (MBL) for\nwhich the energy eigenfuctions fail to be in MITE while necessarily most of\nthem, but not all, are in MATE. However, if we consider superpositions of\nenergy eigenfunctions (i.e., typical wave functions $\\psi$) in an energy shell,\nthen for generic macroscopic systems, including those with MBL, most $\\psi$ are\nin both MATE and MITE. We explore here the properties of MATE and MITE and\ncompare the two notions, thereby elaborating on ideas introduced in [Goldstein\net al., Phys.Rev.Lett. 115: 100402 (2015)].\n", "  In the paper, we consider the $\\lambda$-model with spin values $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$\non the Cayley tree of order two. We first describe ground states of the model.\nMoreover, we also proved the existence of translation-invariant Gibb measures\nfor the $\\lambda$-model which yield the existence of the phase transition.\nLastly, we established the exitance of 2-periodic Gibbs measures for the model.\n", "  The information extracted from large galaxy surveys with the likes of DES,\nDESI, Euclid, LSST, SKA, and WFIRST will be greatly enhanced if the resultant\ngalaxy catalogues can be cross-correlated with one another. Predicting the\nnature of the information gain, and developing the tools to realise it, depends\non establishing a consistent model of how the galaxies detected by each survey\ntrace the same underlying matter distribution. Existing analytic methods, such\nas halo occupation distribution (HOD) modelling, are not well-suited for this\ntask, and can suffer from ambiguities and tuning issues when applied to\nmultiple tracers. In this paper, we take the first steps towards constructing\nan alternative that provides a common model for the connection between galaxies\nand dark matter halos across a wide range of wavelengths (and thus tracer\npopulations). This is based on a chain of parametrised statistical\ndistributions that model the connection between (a) halo mass and bulk physical\nproperties of galaxies, such as star-formation rate; and (b) those same\nphysical properties and a variety of emission processes. The result is a\nflexible parametric model that allows analytic halo model calculations of\n1-point functions to be carried out for multiple tracers, as well as providing\nsemi-realistic galaxy properties for fast mock catalogue generation.\n", "  Using localization techniques, we compute the path integral of $N=2$ SUSY\ngauge theory coupled to matter on the hemisphere $HS^4$, with either Dirichlet\nor Neumann supersymmetric boundary conditions. The resulting quantities are\nwave-functions of the theory depending on the boundary data. The one-loop\ndeterminant are computed using $SO(4)$ harmonics basis. We solve kernel and\nco-kernel equations for the relevant differential operators arising from gauge\nand matter localizing actions. The second method utilizes full $SO(5)$\nharmonics to reduce the computation to evaluating $Q_{SUSY}^2$ eigenvalues and\nits multiplicities. In the Dirichlet case, we show how to glue two\nwave-functions to get back the partition function of round $S^4$. We will also\ndescribe how to obtain the same results using $SO(5)$ harmonics basis.\n", "  Hybrid spin-mechanical systems have great potentials in sensing, macroscopic\nquantum mechanics, and quantum information science. In order to induce strong\ncoupling between an electron spin and the center-of-mass motion of a mechanical\noscillator, a large magnetic gradient is usually required, which is difficult\nto achieve. Here we show that strong coupling between the electron spin of a\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and the torsional vibration of an optically\nlevitated nanodiamond can be achieved in a uniform magnetic field. Thanks to\nthe uniform magnetic field, multiple spins can strongly couple to the torsional\nvibration at the same time. We propose to utilize this new coupling mechanism\nto realize the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model by an ensemble of NV centers in\na levitated nanodiamond. The quantum phase transition in the LMG model and\nfinite number effects can be observed with this system. We also propose to\ngenerate torsional superposition states and realize torsional matter-wave\ninterferometry with spin-torsional coupling.\n", "  We compare analytic predictions of supernova light curves with recent high\nquality data from SN2011fe (Ia), from KSN2011b (Ia), and the Palomar Transient\nFactory (PTF) and the La Silla-QUEST variability survey (LSQ) (Ia).\n  Because of the steady, fast cadence of observations, KSN2011b provides unique\nnew information on SNe Ia: the smoothness of the light curve, which is\nconsistent with significant large-scale mixing during the explosion, possibly\ndue to 3D effects (e.g., Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities), and provides support\nfor a slowly-varying leakage (mean opacity). For a more complex light curve\n(SN2008D, SNIb), we separate the luminosity due to multiple causes and indicate\nthe possibility of a radioactive plume. The early rise in luminosity is shown\nto be affected by the opacity (leakage rate) for thermal and non-thermal\nradiation. A general derivation of Arnett's rule again shows that it depends\nupon {\\em all} processes heating the plasma, not just radioactive ones, so that\nSNe Ia will differ from SNe Ibc if the latter have multiple heating processes.\n", "  We predict spontaneous generation of superfluid polariton currents in planar\nmicrocavities with lateral periodic modulation of both potential and decay\nrate. A spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry of a polariton\ncondensate emerges at a critical pumping, and the current direction is\nstochastically chosen. We analyse the stability of the current with respect to\nthe fluctuations of the condensate. A peculiar spatial current domain structure\nemerges, where the current direction is switched at the domain walls, and the\ncharacteristic domain size and lifetime scale with the pumping power.\n", "  Hamiltonian quantum computing, such as the adiabatic and holonomic models,\ncan be protected against decoherence using an encoding into stabilizer subspace\ncodes for error detection and the addition of energy penalty terms. This method\nhas been widely studied since it was first introduced by Jordan, Farhi, and\nShor (JFS) in the context of adiabatic quantum computing. Here we extend the\noriginal result to general Markovian environments, not necessarily in Lindblad\nform. We show that the main conclusion of the original JFS study holds under\nthese general circumstances: assuming a physically reasonable bath model, it is\npossible to suppress the initial decay out of the encoded ground state with an\nenergy penalty strength that grows only logarithmically in the system size, at\na fixed temperature.\n", "  We develop further our fibre bundle construct of non-commutative space-time\non a Minkowski base space. We assume space-time is non-commutative due to the\nexistence of additional non-commutative algebraic structure at each point x of\nspace-time, forming a quantum operator 'fibre algebra' A(x). This structure\nthen corresponds to the single fibre of a fibre bundle. A gauge group acts on\neach fibre algebra locally, while a 'section' through this bundle is then a\nquantum field of the form {A(x); x in M} with M the underlying space-time\nmanifold. In addition, we assume a local algebra O(D) corresponding to the\nalgebra of sections of such a principal fibre bundle with base space a finite\nand bounded subset of space-time, D. The algebraic operations of addition and\nmultiplication are assumed defined fibrewise for this algebra of sections. We\ncharacterise 'ergodic' extremal quantum states of the fibre algebra invariant\nunder the subgroup T of local translations of space-time of the Poincare group\nP in terms of a non-commutative extension of entropy applied to the subgroup T.\nWe also characterise the existence of T- invariant states by generalizing to\nthe non-commutative case Kakutani's work on wandering projections. This leads\non to a classification of the structure of the local algebra O(D) by using a\n'T-Twisted' equivalence relation, including a full analysis of the T-type III\ncase. In particular we show that O(D) is T-type III if and only if the crossed\nproduct algebra O(D)xT is type III in the sense of Murray-von Neumann.\n", "  A search for a long-lived scalar particle $\\chi$ is performed, looking for\nthe decay ${B^+ \\to K^+ \\chi}$ with ${\\chi \\to \\mu^+\\mu^-}$ in $pp$ collision\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3\\, {\\rm fb}^{-1}$,\ncollected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and\n8$\\,$TeV. This new scalar particle, predicted by Hidden Sector models, is\nassumed to have a narrow width. The signal would manifest itself as an excess\nin the dimuon invariant mass distribution over the Standard Model background.\nNo significant excess is observed in the accessible ranges of mass ${250 <\nm(\\chi) < 4700\\,\\rm MeV/c^2}$ and lifetime ${0.1 < \\tau(\\chi) < 1000\\,\\rm ps}$.\nUpper limits on the branching fraction $\\mathcal{B}(B^+ \\to K^+ \\chi\n(\\mu^+\\mu^-))$ at 95% confidence level are set as a function of $m(\\chi)$ and\n$\\tau(\\chi)$, varying between $2\\times10^{-10}$ and $10^{-7}$. These are the\nmost stringent limits to date. The limits are interpreted in the context of a\nmodel with a light inflaton particle.\n", "  Active particle tracking microrheometers have the potential to perform\naccurate broad-band measurements of viscoelasticity within microscopic systems.\nGenerally, their largest possible precision is limited by Brownian motion and\nlow frequency changes to the system. The signal to noise ratio is usually\nimproved by increasing the size of the driven motion compared to the Brownian\nas well as averaging over repeated measurements. New theory is presented here\nwhich gives the complex shear modulus when the motion of a spherical particle\nis driven by non-linear forces. In some scenarios error can be further reduced\nby applying a variable transformation which linearises the equation of motion.\nThis allows normalisation which eliminates low frequency drift in the\nparticle's equilibrium position. Using this method will easily increase the\nsignal strength enough to significantly reduce the measurement time for the\nsame error. Thus the method is more conducive to measuring viscoelasticity in\nslowly changing microscopic systems, such as a living cell.\n", "  Wiedemann-Franz law is a prediction of electronic theory of electric and\nthermal conductivity in metals, which states that a Lorenz ratio\n$L=\\kappa/(\\sigma T)$, where $\\kappa$ is a thermal conductivity, $\\sigma$ ---\nelectric conductivity and $T$ --- absolute temperature, is a universal constant\nin certain cases. We present here a simple experimental setup to verify this\nprediction in a teaching experiment.\n", "  Graphene/silicon (G/Si) heterojunction based devices have been demonstrated\nas high responsivity photodetectors that are potentially compatible with\nsemiconductor technology. Such G/Si Schottky junction diodes are typically in\nparallel with gated G/silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$)/Si areas, where the graphene is\ncontacted. Here, we utilize scanning photocurrent measurements to investigate\nthe spatial distribution and explain the physical origin of photocurrent\ngeneration in these devices. We observe distinctly higher photocurrents\nunderneath the isolating region of graphene on SiO$_2$ adjacent to the Schottky\njunction of G/Si. A certain threshold voltage (V$_T$) is required before this\ncan be observed, and its origins are similar to that of the threshold voltage\nin metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors. A physical model serves\nto explain the large photocurrents underneath SiO$_2$ by the formation of an\ninversion layer in Si. Our findings contribute to a basic understanding of\ngraphene / semiconductor hybrid devices which, in turn, can help in designing\nefficient optoelectronic devices and systems based on such 2D/3D\nheterojunctions.\n", "  Robust zero bias transport anomalies in semiconducting nanowires with\nproximity-induced superconductivity have been convincingly demonstrated in\nvarious experiments. While these are compatible with the existence of Majorana\nzero modes at the ends of the nanowire, a direct proof of their non-locality\nand topological protection is now needed. Here we show that a quantum dot at\nthe end of the nanowire may be used as a powerful spectroscopic tool to\nquantify the degree of Majorana non-locality through a local transport\nmeasurement. Moreover, the spin polarization of dot sub-gap states at\nsinglet-doublet transitions in the Coulomb blockade regime allows the dot to\ndirectly probe the spin structure of the Majorana wave function, and indirectly\nmeasure the spin-orbit coupling of the nanowire.\n", "  We show that standard approximations in nonlinear optics are violated for\nsituations involving a small value of the linear refractive index.\nConsequently, the conventional equation for the intensity-dependent refractive\nindex, $n(I) = n_0 + n_2 I$, becomes inapplicable in epsilon-near-zero and\nlow-index media, even in the presence of only third-order effects. For the\nparticular case of indium tin oxide, we find that the $\\chi^{(3)}$,\n$\\chi^{(5)}$ and $\\chi^{(7)}$ contributions to refraction eclipse the linear\nterm; thus, the nonlinear response can no longer be interpreted as a\nperturbation in these materials. Although the response is non-perturbative, we\nfind no evidence that the power series expansion of the material polarization\ndiverges.\n", "  The Vafa-Witten equations on an oriented Riemannian 4- manifold are first\norder, non-linear equations for a pair of connection on a principle SO(3)\nbundle over the 4-manifold and a self-dual 2-form with values in the associated\nLie algebra bundle. The main theorem in this paper characterizes in part the\nbehavior of sequences of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations which have no\nconvergent subsequence. The paper proves that a renormalization of a\nsubsequence of the self-dual 2-form components converges on the complement of a\nclosed set with Hausdorff dimension at most 2, with the limit being a harmonic\n2-form with values in a real line bundle.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of a collisional model in which both the system and\nenvironment are embodied by spin-$1/2$ particles. In order to include\nnon-Markovian features in our model we introduce interactions among the\nenvironmental qubits and investigate the effect that different models of such\ninteraction have on the degree of non-Markovianity of the system's dynamics. By\nextending that interaction beyond the nearest-neighbour, we enhance the degree\nof non-Markovianity in the system's dynamics. A further significant increase\ncan be observed if a collective interaction with the forthcoming environmental\nqubits is considered. However, the observed degree of non-Markovianity in this\ncase is non-monotonic with the increasing number of qubits included in the\ninteraction. Moreover, one can establish a connection between the degree of\nnon-Markovianity in the evolution of the system and the fading behaviour of\nquantum coherence in its state as the number of collisions grow. We complement\nour study with an investigation on system-environment correlations and present\nan example of their importance on a physical upper bound on the trace distance\nderivative.\n", "  We systematically study the large-$q_T$ (or small-$b$) matching of transverse\nmomentum dependent (TMD) distributions to the twist-2 integrated parton\ndistributions. Performing operator product expansion for a generic TMD operator\nat the next-to-leading order (NLO) we found the complete set of TMD\ndistributions that match twist-2. These are unpolarized, helicity,\ntransversity, pretzelosity and linearly polarized gluon distributions. The NLO\nmatching coefficients for these distributions are presented. The pretzelosity\nmatching coefficient is zero at the presented order, however, it is evident\nthat it is non-zero in the following orders. This result offers a natural\nexplanation of the small value of pretzelosity found in phenomenological fits.\nWe also demonstrate that the cancellation of rapidity divergences by the\nleading order soft factor imposes the necessary requirement on the Lorentz\nstructure of TMD operators, which is supported only by the TMD distributions of\nleading dynamical twist. Additionally, this requirement puts restrictions on\nthe $\\gamma_5$-definition in the dimensional regularization.\n", "  Conformal gravity can elegantly solve the problem of spacetime singularities\npresent in Einstein's gravity. For every physical spacetime, there is an\ninfinite family of conformally-equivalent singularity-free metrics. In the\nunbroken phase, every non-singular metric is equivalent and can be used to\ninfer the physical properties of the spacetime. In the broken phase, a\nHiggs-like mechanism should select a certain vacuum, which thus becomes the\nphysical one. However, in the absence of the complete theoretical framework we\ndo not know how to select the right vacuum. In this paper, we study the energy\nconditions of non-singular black hole spacetimes obtained in conformal gravity\nassuming they are solutions of Einstein's gravity with an effective\nenergy-momentum tensor. We check whether such conditions can be helpful to\nselect the vacuum of the broken phase.\n", "  Understanding the coexistence, competition and/or cooperation between\nsuperconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) in the transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) is an elusive goal which, when realized, promises to\nreveal fundamental information on this important class of materials. Here, we\nuse four-terminal current-voltage measurements to study the Van der Waals\ninterface between freshly exfoliated flakes of the high-$T_{c}$ superconductor,\nBi-2212, and the CDW-dominated TMD layered material, 1T-TaS$_{2}$. For highly\ntransparent barriers, there is a pronounced Andreev reflection feature\nproviding evidence for proximity-induced high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity in\n1T-TaS$_{2}$ with a surprisingly large energy gap ($\\sim 20\\thinspace $meV)\nequal to half that of intrinsic Bi-2212 ($\\sim 40\\thinspace $meV). Our\nsystematic study using conductance spectroscopy of junctions with different\ntransparencies also reveals the presence of two separate boson modes, each\nassociated with a \"dip-hump\" structure. We infer that the proximity-induced\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity in the 1T-TaS$_2$ is driven by coupling to the\nmetastable metallic phase coexisting within the Mott commensurate CDW (CCDW)\nphase and associated with a concomitant change of the CCDW order parameter in\nthe interfacial region.\n", "  We study the gravitational waves produced by the collision of the bubbles as\na probe for the cosmological first order QCD phase transition, considering\nheavy static quarks. Using AdS/QCD and the correspondence between a first order\nHawking-Page phase transition and confinement-deconfinement phase transition,\nwe find the spectrum and the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave within\nthe hard and soft wall models. We postulate the duration of the phase\ntransition corresponds to the evaporation time of the black hole in the five\ndimensional dual gravity space, and thereby obtain a bound on the string length\nin the space and correspondingly on the duration of the QCD phase transition.\nWe also show that IPTA and SKA detectors will be able to detect these\ngravitational waves, which can be an evidence for the first order deconfinement\ntransition.\n", "  We consider Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) models with a global\n$\\mathbb Z_N$ symmetry, which are constructed from $\\mathbb Z_N$-symmetric\ntensors and are thus $\\mathbb Z_N$-invariant wavefunctions, and study the\noccurence of long-range order and symmetry breaking in these systems. First, we\nshow that long-range order in those models is accompanied by a degeneracy in\nthe so-called transfer operator of the system. We subsequently use this\ndegeneracy to determine the nature of the symmetry broken states, i.e., those\nstable under arbitrary perturbations, and provide a succinct characterization\nin terms of the fixed points of the transfer operator (i.e.\\ the different\nboundary conditions) in the individual symmetry sectors. We verify our findings\nnumerically through the study of a $\\mathbb Z_3$-symmetric model, and show that\nthe entanglement Hamiltonian derived from the symmetry broken states is\nquasi-local (unlike the one derived from the symmetric state), reinforcing the\nlocality of the entanglement Hamiltonian for gapped phases.\n", "  In high energy experiments such as active beam dump searches for rare decays\nand missing energy events, the beam purity is a crucial parameter. In this\npaper we present a technique to reject heavy charged particle contamination in\nthe 100 GeV electron beam of the H4 beam line at CERN SPS. The method is based\non the detection with BGO scintillators of the synchrotron radiation emitted by\nthe electrons passing through a bending dipole magnet. A 100 GeV $\\pi^-$ beam\nis used to test the method in the NA64 experiment resulting in a suppression\nfactor of $10^{-5}$ while the efficiency for electron detection is $\\sim$95%.\nThe spectra and the rejection factors are in very good agreement with the Monte\nCarlo simulation. The reported suppression factors are significantly better\nthan previously achieved.\n", "  Scalable quantum technologies will require an unprecedented combination of\nprecision and complexity for designing stable structures of well-controllable\nquantum systems. It is a challenging task to find a suitable elementary\nbuilding block, of which a quantum network can be comprised in a scalable way.\nHere we present the working principle of such a basic unit, engineered using\nmolecular chemistry, whose control and readout are executed using a nitrogen\nvacancy (NV) center in diamond. The basic unit we investigate is a synthetic\npolyproline with electron spins localized on attached molecular sidegroups\nseparated by a few nanometers. We demonstrate the readout and coherent\nmanipulation of very few ($\\leq 6 $) of these $S=1/2$ electronic spin systems\nand access their direct dipolar coupling tensor. Our results show, that it is\nfeasible to use spin-labeled peptides as a resource for a molecular-qubit based\nnetwork, while at the same time providing simple optical readout of single\nquantum states through NV-magnetometry. This work lays the foundation for\nbuilding arbitrary quantum networks using well-established chemistry methods,\nwhich has many applications ranging from mapping distances in single molecules\nto quantum information processing.\n", "  Final measurements and analysis are reported from the first-generation\nHolometer, the first instrument capable of measuring correlated variations in\nspace-time position at strain noise power spectral densities smaller than a\nPlanck time. The apparatus consists of two co-located, but independent and\nisolated, 40 m power-recycled Michelson interferometers, whose outputs are\ncross-correlated to 25 MHz. The data are sensitive to correlations of\ndifferential position across the apparatus over a broad band of frequencies up\nto and exceeding the inverse light crossing time, 7.6 MHz. By measuring with\nPlanck precision the correlation of position variations at spacelike\nseparations, the Holometer searches for faint, irreducible correlated position\nnoise backgrounds predicted by some models of quantum space-time geometry. The\nfirst-generation optical layout is sensitive to quantum geometrical noise\ncorrelations with shear symmetry---those that can be interpreted as a\nfundamental noncommutativity of space-time position in orthogonal directions.\nGeneral experimental constraints are placed on parameters of a set of models of\nspatial shear noise correlations, with a sensitivity that exceeds the\nPlanck-scale holographic information bound on position states by a large\nfactor. This result significantly extends the upper limits placed on models of\ndirectional noncommutativity by currently operating gravitational wave\nobservatories.\n", "  The zero-bias peak (ZBP) is understood as the definite signature of a\nMajorana bound state (MBS) when attached to a semi-infinite Kitaev nanowire\n(KNW) nearby zero temperature. However, such characteristics concerning the\nrealization of the KNW constitute a profound experimental challenge. We explore\ntheoretically a QD connected to a topological KNW of finite size at non-zero\ntemperatures and show that overlapped MBSs of the wire edges can become\neffectively decoupled from each other and the characteristic ZBP can be fully\nrecovered if one tunes the system into the leaked Majorana fermion fixed point.\nAt very low temperatures, the MBSs become strongly coupled similarly to what\nhappens in the Kondo effect. We derive universal features of the conductance as\na function of the temperature and the relevant crossover temperatures. Our\nfindings offer additional guides to identify signatures of MBSs in solid state\nsetups.\n", "  This paper describes the implementation and performance of a particle flow\nalgorithm applied to 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of ATLAS data from 8 TeV proton-proton\ncollisions in Run 1 of the LHC. The algorithm removes calorimeter energy\ndeposits due to charged hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction,\ninstead using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This\nimproves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while retaining the\ncalorimeter measurements of neutral-particle energies. The paper places\nemphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of\ncharged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The\nperformance of particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the\ncalorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets reconstructed\nfrom calorimeter energy deposits alone, demonstrating improvements in\nresolution and pile-up stability.\n", "  We study the dynamics of overdamped Brownian particles diffusing in\nconservative force fields and undergoing stochastic resetting to a given\nlocation with a generic space-dependent rate of resetting. We present a\nsystematic approach involving path integrals and elements of renewal theory\nthat allows to derive analytical expressions for a variety of statistics of the\ndynamics such as (i) the propagator prior to first reset; (ii) the distribution\nof the first-reset time, and (iii) the spatial distribution of the particle at\nlong times. We apply our approach to several representative and hitherto\nunexplored examples of resetting dynamics. A particularly interesting example\nfor which we find analytical expressions for the statistics of resetting is\nthat of a Brownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential with a rate of\nresetting that depends on the instantaneous energy of the particle. We find\nthat using energy-dependent resetting processes is more effective in achieving\nspatial confinement of Brownian particles on a faster timescale than by\nperforming quenches of parameters of the harmonic potential.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the Ising-Vannimenus model on a Cayley tree for\norder two with competing nearest-neighbor and prolonged next-nearest neighbor\ninteractions. We stress that the mentioned model was investigated only\nnumerically, without rigorous (mathematical) proofs. One of the main points of\nthis paper is to propose a measure-theoretical approach for the considered\nmodel. We find certain conditions for the existence of Gibbs measures\ncorresponding to the model, which allowed to establish the existence of the\nphase transition. Moreover, the free energies and entropies, associated with\ntranslation invariant Gibbs measures, are calculated.\n", "  We review the main results on the generalization of the DGLAP evolution\nequations within the cut Mellin moments (CMM) approach, which allows one to\novercome the problem of kinematic constraints in Bjorken $x$. CMM obtained by\nmultiple integrations as well as multiple differentiations of the original\nparton distribution also satisfy the DGLAP equations with the simply\ntransformed evolution kernel. The CMM approach provides novel tools to test\nQCD; here we present one of them. Using appropriate classes of CMM, we\nconstruct the generalized Bjorken sum rule that allows us to determine the\nBjorken sum rule value from the experimental data in a restricted kinematic\nrange of $x$. We apply our analysis to COMPASS data on the spin structure\nfunction $g_1$.\n", "  Exclusive measurements of high energy $\\gamma$-rays are performed in $\\rm\n^{124}Ba$ and $\\rm ^{136}Ba$ at the same excitation energy ($\\sim$ 49 MeV), to\nstudy properties of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) over a wider $N/Z$ range.\nThe high energy $\\gamma$-rays are measured in coincidence with the multiplicity\nof low energy $\\gamma$-rays to disentangle the effect of temperature ($T$) and\nangular momentum ($J$). The GDR parameters are extracted employing a simulated\nMonte Carlo statistical model analysis. The observed $\\gamma$-ray spectra of\n$\\rm ^{124}Ba$ can be explained with prolate deformation, whereas a single\ncomponent Lorentzian function which corresponds to a spherical shape could\nexplain the $\\gamma$-ray spectra from $\\rm ^{136}Ba$. The observed GDR width in\n$\\rm ^{136}Ba$ is narrower compared to that of $\\rm ^{124}Ba$.\n  The statistical model best fit GDR cross sections are found to be in good\nagreement with the thermal shape fluctuation model (TSFM) calculations.\nFurther, it is shown that the variation of GDR width with $T$ is well\nreproduced by the TSFM calculations over the temperature range of 1.1--1.7MeV.\n", "  Linearity of the topological insulator edge state spectrum plays the crucial\nrole for various transport phenomena. The previous studies found that this\nlinearity exists near the spectrum crossing point, but did not determine how\nperfect the linearity is. The purpose of the present study is to answer this\nquestion in various edge states models. We examine Volkov and Pankratov (VP)\nmodel [1] for the Dirac Hamiltonian and the model of [2,3] (BHZ1) for the\nBernevig, Hughes and Zhang (BHZ) Hamiltonian [4] with zero boundary conditions.\nIt is found that both models yield ideally linear edge states. In the BHZ1\nmodel the linearity is conserved up to the spectrum ending points corresponding\nto the tangency of the edge spectrum with the boundary of 2D states. In\ncontrast, the model of[5] (BHZ2) with mixed boundary conditions for BHZ\nHamiltonian and the 2D tight-binding (TB) model from [4] yield weak\nnon-linearity.\n", "  We study the formation of massive black holes in the first star clusters. We\nfirst locate star-forming gas clouds in proto-galactic haloes of $\\gtrsim\n\\!10^7\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations and use them\nto generate the initial conditions for star clusters with masses of $\\sim\n\\!10^5\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. We then perform a series of direct-tree hybrid\n$N$-body simulations to follow runaway stellar collisions in the dense star\nclusters. In all the cluster models except one, runaway collisions occur within\na few million years, and the mass of the central, most massive star reaches\n$\\sim \\!400-1900\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. Such very massive stars collapse to leave\nintermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The diversity of the final masses may be\nattributed to the differences in a few basic properties of the host haloes such\nas mass, central gas velocity dispersion, and mean gas density of the central\ncore. Finally, we derive the IMBH mass to cluster mass ratios, and compare them\nwith the observed black hole to bulge mass ratios in the present-day Universe.\n", "  We consider radiative corrections to false vacuum decay within the framework\nof quantum mechanics for the general potential of the form 1/2 M q^2\n(q-A)(q-B), where M , A and B are arbitrary parameters. For this type of\npotential we provide analytical results for Green function in the background of\ncorresponding bounce solution together with one loop expression for false\nvacuum decay rate. Next, we discuss the computation of higher order corrections\nfor false vacuum decay rate and provide numerical expressions for two and three\nloop contributions.\n", "  The previously introduced class of two-parametric phenomenological\ninflationary models in General Relativity in which the slow-roll assumption is\nreplaced by the more general, constant-roll condition is generalized to the\ncase of $f(R)$ gravity. A simple constant-roll condition is defined in the\noriginal Jordan frame, and exact expressions for a scalaron potential in the\nEinstein frame, for a function $f(R)$ (in the parametric form) and for\ninflationary dynamics are obtained. The region of the model parameters\npermitted by the latest observational constraints on the scalar spectral index\nand the tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial metric perturbations generated\nduring inflation is determined.\n", "  Fermi Large Area Telescope data reveal an excess of GeV gamma rays from the\ndirection of the Galactic Center and bulge. Several explanations have been\nproposed for this excess including an unresolved population of millisecond\npulsars (MSPs) and self-annihilating dark matter. It has been claimed that a\nkey discriminant for or against the MSP explanation can be extracted from the\nproperties of the luminosity function describing this source population.\nSpecifically, is the luminosity function of the putative MSPs in the Galactic\nCenter consistent with that characterizing the resolved MSPs in the Galactic\ndisk? To investigate this we have used a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo to\nevaluate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the MSP luminosity\nfunction describing both resolved MSPs and the Galactic Center excess. At\nvariance with some other claims, our analysis reveals that, within current\nuncertainties, both data sets can be well fit with the same luminosity\nfunction.\n", "  Materials with correlated electrons often respond very strongly to external\nor internal influences, leading to instabilities and states of matter with\nbroken symmetry. This behavior can be studied theoretically either by\nevaluating the linear response characteristics, or by simulating the ordered\nphases of the materials under investigation. We developed the necessary tools\nwithin the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to search for electronic\ninstabilities in materials close to spin-state crossovers and to analyze the\nproperties of the corresponding ordered states. This investigation, motivated\nby the physics of LaCoO$_3$, led to a discovery of condensation of spinful\nexcitons in the two-orbital Hubbard model with a surprisingly rich phase\ndiagram. The results are reviewed in the first part of the article. Electronic\ncorrelations can also be the driving force behind structural transformations of\nmaterials. To be able to investigate correlation-induced phase instabilities we\ndeveloped and implemented a formalism for the computation of total energies and\nforces within a fully charge self-consistent combination of density functional\ntheory and DMFT. Applications of this scheme to the study of structural\ninstabilities of selected correlated electron materials such as Fe and FeSe are\nreviewed in the second part of the paper.\n", "  We consider the variational principle in the covariant formulation of\nmodified teleparallel theories with second order field equations. We vary the\naction with respect to the spin connection and obtain a consistency condition\nrelating the spin connection with the tetrad. We argue that since the spin\nconnection can be calculated using an additional reference tetrad, modified\nteleparallel theories can be interpreted as effectively bigravity theories. We\nconclude with discussion about the relation of our results and those obtained\nin the usual, non-covariant, formulation of teleparallel theories and present\nthe solution to the problem of choosing the tetrad in $f(T)$ gravity theories.\n", "  We show that the dimension of spacetime becomes complex-valued when its\nshort-scale geometry is invariant under a discrete scaling symmetry. This\ncharacteristic can generically arise in quantum gravities, for instance, in\nthose based on combinatorial or multifractal structures or as the partial\nbreaking of continuous dilation symmetry in any conformal-invariant theory.\nWith its infinite scale hierarchy, discrete scale invariance overlaps with the\ntraditional separation between ultraviolet and infrared physics and it can\nleave an all-range observable imprint, such as a pattern of log oscillations\nand sharp features in the cosmic microwave background primordial power\nspectrum.\n", "  Second-Harmonic Scatteringh (SHS) experiments provide a unique approach to\nprobe non-centrosymmetric environments in aqueous media, from bulk solutions to\ninterfaces, living cells and tissue. A central assumption made in analyzing SHS\nexperiments is that the each molecule scatters light according to a constant\nmolecular hyperpolarizability tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(2)}$. Here, we\ninvestigate the dependence of the molecular hyperpolarizability of water on its\nenvironment and internal geometric distortions, in order to test the hypothesis\nof constant $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(2)}$. We use quantum chemistry calculations\nof the hyperpolarizability of a molecule embedded in point-charge environments\nobtained from simulations of bulk water. We demonstrate that both the\nheterogeneity of the solvent configurations and the quantum mechanical\nfluctuations of the molecular geometry introduce large variations in the\nnon-linear optical response of water. This finding has the potential to change\nthe way SHS experiments are interpreted: in particular, isotopic differences\nbetween H$_2$O and D$_2$O could explain recent second-harmonic scattering\nobservations. Finally, we show that a simple machine-learning framework can\npredict accurately the fluctuations of the molecular hyperpolarizability. This\nmodel accounts for the microscopic inhomogeneity of the solvent and represents\na first step towards quantitative modelling of SHS experiments.\n", "  The photonic density of states (PDS) of eigen polarizations (EPs) in\ncholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) cells with a defect layer inside are\ncalculated. The dependences for the PDS and light intensity in the defect layer\non the parameters characterizing absorption and gain are obtained. We\ninvestigated the possibility of connections between the PDS and the density of\nthe light energy accumulated in the system. The influence of the defect layer\nand CLC layer on the PDS are investigated. It is shown that the PDS is maximum\nwhen the defect is in the centre of the system. We showed also that the subject\nsystem can work as a low threshold laser, a multiposition trigger, filter, etc.\n", "  Heavy vector-like quarks with electric charge $Q=2/3$ (also called\n\\textit{heavy tops}) appear naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model.\nAlthough these typically predict the existence of further particles below the\nTeV scale, direct searches for heavy tops have been performed assuming that\nthey decay only into SM particles. The aim of this paper is to overcome this\nsituation. We consider the most constraining experimental LHC searches for\nvector-like quarks, including analyses of the 36 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in\nthe latest run at 13 TeV of center of mass energy, as well as searches\nsensitive to heavy tops decaying into a new scalar, $S$. Combining all these,\nwe derive bounds for arbitrary values of the heavy top branching ratios. A\nsimple code that automatizes this process is also provided. At the physics\nlevel, we demonstrate that bounds on heavy tops are not inevitably weaker in\nthe presence of new light scalars. We find that heavy tops with masses below\n$\\sim 900$ GeV are excluded by direct searches, independently of whether they\ndecay into $Zt, Ht, Wb$ or $St$ (with $S$ giving either missing energy of\nbottom quarks) or into any combination of them.\n", "  We demonstrate non-volatile, n-type, back-gated, MoS$_{2}$ transistors,\nplaced directly on an epitaxial grown, single crystalline,\nPbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_{3}$ (PZT) ferroelectric. The transistors show decent\nON current (19 ${\\mu}A/{\\mu}$m), high on-off ratio (10$^{7}$), and a\nsubthreshold swing of (SS ~ 92 mV/dec) with a 100 nm thick PZT layer as the\nback gate oxide. Importantly, the ferroelectric polarization can directly\ncontrol the channel charge, showing a clear anti-clockwise hysteresis. We have\nselfconsistently confirmed the switching of the ferroelectric and corresponding\nchange in channel current from a direct time-dependent measurement. Our results\ndemonstrate that it is possible to obtain transistor operation directly on\npolar surfaces and therefore it should be possible to integrate 2D electronics\nwith single crystalline functional oxides.\n", "  We have carried out a large scale computational investigation to assess the\nutility of common small-molecule force fields for computational screening of\nlow energy conformers of typical organic molecules. Using statistical analyses\non the energies and relative rankings of up to 250 diverse conformers of 700\ndifferent molecular structures, we find that energies from widely-used\nclassical force fields (MMFF94, UFF, and GAFF) show unconditionally poor energy\nand rank correlation with semiempirical (PM7) and Kohn-Sham density functional\ntheory (DFT) energies calculated at PM7 and DFT optimized geometries. In\ncontrast, semiempirical PM7 calculations show significantly better correlation\nwith DFT calculations and generally better geometries. With these results, we\nmake recommendations to more reliably carry out conformer screening.\n", "  We theoretically study static and dynamic properties of short Josephson\njunctions (JJ) with singlet and triplet Josephson coupling. In singlet\nJosephson weak links, two singlet superconductors S are connected with each\nother by a normal film (N) or wire. Triplet JJs, which we denote\nS$_{\\text{m}}$/N(F)/S$_{\\text{m}}$, are formed by two singlet BCS\nsuperconductors covered by a thin layer of a weak ferromagnet F$_{\\text{w}}$.\nThese superconductors S$_{\\text{m}}$ are separated from the N (or F) layer by\nspin filters, which pass electrons with only one spin orientation. The triplet\nCooper pairs propagating from the left (right) superconductors S$_{\\text{m}}$\ndiffer from each other not only by polarizations, but also by chiralities. The\nlatter is determined by the magnetization orientation in weak ferromagnets\nF$_{\\text{w}}$. We obtain analytical formulas for the critical Josephson\ncurrent in both types of the JJs. If chiralities of the triplet Cooper pairs\npenetrating into the N film in S$_{\\text{m}}$/N(F)/S$_{\\text{m}}$ JJs from the\nleft and right S$_{\\text{m}}$ are different, the Josephson current is not zero\nin the absence of the phase difference (spontaneous Josephson current). We also\ncalculate the admittance $Y(\\Omega)$ for arbitrary frequencies $\\Omega$ in the\ncase of singlet JJs and for low frequencies in the case of triplet JJs. At low\ntemperatures $T$, the real part of the admittance $Y^{\\prime}(\\Omega)$ in\nsinglet JJs starts to increase from zero at ${\\hbar \\Omega \\geq\n\\Delta_{\\text{sg}}}$, but at ${T \\geq \\Delta_{\\text{sg}}}$, it has a peak at\nlow frequencies the magnitude of which is determined by inelastic processes.\nThe subgap $\\Delta_{\\text{sg}}$ depends on transparencies of the S/N interfaces\nand on the phase difference $2 \\chi_{0}$. The low-frequency peak in\n$Y^{\\prime}(\\Omega)$ in triplet JJs disappears.\n", "  The fractal characteristics of multi-particle final state are first studied\nin the $e^+e^-$ collision of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=250$GeV, with the MC simulation\ngenerator Jetset7.4 and Herwig5.9. The result is shown that this multi-particle\nfinal state is self-affine fractal, and exists a double-Hurst-exponent\nphenomenon. Their fractal indices and the effective fluctuation strength are\nalso predicted.\n", "  The project A2 of the LIMTECH Alliance aimed at a better understanding of\nthose magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that are relevant for the generation\nand the action of cosmic magnetic fields. These comprise the hydromagnetic\ndynamo effect and various magnetically triggered flow instabilities, such as\nthe magnetorotational instability and the Tayler instability. The project was\nintended to support the experimental capabilities to become available in the\nframework of the DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and thermohydraulic studies\n(DRESDYN). An associated starting grant was focused on the dimensioning of a\nliquid metal experiment on the newly found magnetic destabilization of rotating\nflows with positive shear. In this paper, the main results of these two\nprojects are summarized.\n", "  In this contribution, we review the results of the recent paper \"The photon\nPDF from high-mass Drell Yan data at the LHC\" (arXiv:1701.08553), where a\ndetermination of the photon PDF from fits to recent ATLAS measurements of\nhigh-mass Drell-Yan dilepton production at centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV is\npresented.\n", "  We study the energy spectrum and the electromagnetic response of Andreev\nbound states in short Josephson junctions made of semiconducting nanowires. We\nfocus on the joint effect of Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling on the Andreev\nlevel spectra. Our model incorporates the penetration of the magnetic field in\nthe proximitized wires, which substantially modifies the spectra. We pay\nspecial attention to the occurrence of fermion parity switches at increasing\nvalues of the field and to the magnetic field dependence of the absorption\nstrength of microwave-induced transitions. Our calculations can be used to\nextract quantitative information from microwave and tunneling spectroscopy\nexperiments, such as the recently reported measurements in Van Woerkom et al.,\narXiv:1609.00333.\n", "  We investigate the time dependence of correlation functions in the central\nspin model, which describes the electron or hole spin confined in a quantum\ndot, interacting with a bath of nuclear spins forming the Overhauser field. For\nlarge baths, a classical description of the model yields quantitatively correct\nresults. We develop and apply various algorithms in order to capture the\nlong-time limit of the central spin for bath sizes from 1000 to infinitely many\nbath spins. Representing the Overhauser field in terms of orthogonal\npolynomials, we show that a carefully reduced set of differential equations is\nsufficient to compute the spin correlations of the full problem up to very long\ntimes, for instance up to $10^5\\hbar/J_\\mathrm{Q}$ where $J_\\mathrm{Q}$ is the\nnatural energy unit of the system. This technical progress renders an analysis\nof the model with experimentally relevant parameters possible. We benchmark the\nresults of the algorithms with exact data for a small number of bath spins and\nwe predict how the long-time correlations behave for different effective\nnumbers of bath spins.\n", "  We propose a two-step experimental protocol to directly engineer\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states in a cold two-component Fermi\ngas loaded into a quasi-one-dimensional trap. First, one uses phase imprinting\nto create a train of domain walls in a superfluid with equal number of\n$\\uparrow$- and $\\downarrow$-spins. Second, one applies a radio-frequency sweep\nto selectively break Cooper pairs near the domain walls and transfer the\n$\\uparrow$-spins to a third spin state which does not interact with the\n$\\uparrow$- and $\\downarrow$-spins. The resulting FFLO state has exactly one\nunpaired $\\downarrow$-spin in each domain wall and is stable for all values of\ndomain-wall separation and interaction strength. We show that the protocol can\nbe implemented with high fidelity at sufficiently strong interactions for a\nwide range of parameters available in present-day experimental conditions.\n", "  We propose using smeared boundary states $e^{-\\tau H}|\\cal B\\rangle$ as\nvariational approximations to the ground state of a conformal field theory\ndeformed by relevant bulk operators. This is motivated by recent studies of\nquantum quenches in CFTs and of the entanglement spectrum in massive theories.\nIt gives a simple criterion for choosing which boundary state should correspond\nto which combination of bulk operators, and leads to a rudimentary phase\ndiagram of the theory in the vicinity of the RG fixed point corresponding to\nthe CFT, as well as rigorous upper bounds on the universal amplitude of the\nfree energy. In the case of the 2d minimal models explicit formulae are\navailable. As a side result we show that the matrix elements of bulk operators\nbetween smeared Ishibashi states are simply given by the fusion rules of the\nCFT.\n", "  It is now well established that superconductivity in cuprates competes with\ncharge modulations giving electronic phase separation at a nanoscale. More\nspecifically, superconducting electronic current takes root in the available\nfree space left by electronic charge ordered domains, called charge density\nwave (CDW) puddles. This means that CDW domain arrangement plays a fundamental\nrole in the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Here\nwe report about the possibility of controlling the population and spatial\norganization of the charge density wave puddles in a single crystal La2CuO4+y\nthrough X - ray illumination and thermal treatments. We apply a pump - probe\nmethod based on X - ray illumination as pump and X - ray diffraction as a probe\nsetting a writing and reading procedure of CDW puddles. Our findings are\nexpected to allow new routes for advanced design and manipulation of\nsuperconducting pathways in new electronics.\n", "  We present a multimodal non-linear optical (NLO) laser-scanning microscope,\nbased on a compact fiber-format excitation laser and integrating coherent\nanti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and\ntwo-photon-excitation fluorescence (TPEF) on a single platform. We demonstrate\nits capabilities in simultaneously acquiring CARS and SRS images of a blend of\n6-{\\mu}m poly(methyl methacrylate) beads and 3-{\\mu}m polystyrene beads. We\nthen apply it to visualize cell walls and chloroplast of an unprocessed fresh\nleaf of Elodea aquatic plant via SRS and TPEF modalities, respectively. The\npresented NLO microscope, developed in house using off-the-shelf components,\noffers full accessibility to the optical path and ensures its easy\nre-configurability and flexibility.\n", "  We investigate crystal-growth kinetics in the presence of strong shear flow\nin the liquid, using molecular-dynamics simulations of a binary-alloy model.\nClose to the equilibrium melting point, shear flow always suppresses the growth\nof the crystal-liquid interface. For lower temperatures, we find that the\ngrowth velocity of the crystal depends non-monotonically on the shear rate.\nSlow enough flow enhances the crystal growth, due to an increased particle\nmobility in the liquid. Stronger flow causes a growth regime that is nearly\ntemperature-independent, in striking contrast to what one expects from the\nthermodynamic and equilibrium kinetic properties of the system, which both\ndepend strongly on temperature. We rationalize these effects of flow on crystal\ngrowth as resulting from the nonlinear response of the fluid to strong shearing\nforces.\n", "  The focusing NLS equation is the simplest universal model describing the\nmodulation instability (MI) of quasi monochromatic waves in weakly nonlinear\nmedia, considered the main physical mechanism for the appearance of rogue\n(anomalous) waves (RWs) in Nature. In this paper we study, using the finite gap\nmethod, the NLS Cauchy problem for periodic initial perturbations of the\nunstable background solution of NLS exciting just one of the unstable modes. We\ndistinguish two cases. In the case in which only the corresponding unstable gap\nis theoretically open, the solution describes an exact deterministic alternate\nrecurrence of linear and nonlinear stages of MI, and the nonlinear RW stages\nare described by the 1-breather Akhmediev solution, whose parameters, different\nat each RW appearance, are always given in terms of the initial data through\nelementary functions. If the number of unstable modes is >1, this uniform in t\ndynamics is sensibly affected by perturbations due to numerics and/or real\nexperiments, provoking O(1) corrections to the result. In the second case in\nwhich more than one unstable gap is open, a detailed investigation of all these\ngaps is necessary to get a uniform in $t$ dynamics, and this study is postponed\nto a subsequent paper. It is however possible to obtain the elementary\ndescription of the first nonlinear stage of MI, given again by the Akhmediev\n1-breather solution, and how perturbations due to numerics and/or real\nexperiments can affect this result.\n", "  We have investigated the formation of a circumstellar wide-orbit gas giant\nplanet in a multiple stellar system. We consider a model of orbital\ncircularization for the core of a giant planet after it is scattered from an\ninner disk region by a more massive planet, which was proposed by Kikuchi et al\n(2014). We extend their model for single star systems to binary (multiple) star\nsystems, by taking into account tidal truncation of the protoplanetary gas disk\nby a binary companion. As an example, we consider a wide-orbit gas giant in a\nhierarchical triple system, HD131399Ab. The best-fit orbit of the planet is\nthat with semimajor axis $\\sim 80$ au and eccentricity $\\sim 0.35$. As the\nbinary separation is $\\sim 350$ au, it is very close to the stability limit,\nwhich is puzzling. With the original core location $\\sim 20$-30 au, the core\n(planet) mass $\\sim 50 M_{\\rm E}$ and the disk truncation radius $\\sim 150$ au,\nour model reproduces the best-fit orbit of HD131399Ab. We find that the orbit\nafter the circularization is usually close to the stability limit against the\nperturbations from the binary companion, because the scattered core accretes\ngas from the truncated disk. Our conclusion can also be applied to wider or\nmore compact binary systems if the separation is not too large and another\nplanet with $> \\sim$ 20-30 Earth masses that scattered the core existed in\ninner region of the system.\n", "  In this article, we study the thermodynamic behavior of anisotropic shape\n(rod and disk) nanoparticle within the block copolymer matrix by using\nself-consistent field theory (SCFT) simulation. In particular, we introduce\nvarious defect structures of block copolymers to precisely control the location\nof anisotropic particles. Different from the previous studies using spherical\nnanoparticles within the block copolymer model defects, anisotropic particles\nare aligned with preferred orientation near the defect center due to the\ncombined effects of stretching and interfacial energy of block copolymers. Our\nresults are important for precise controlling of anisotropic nanoparticle\narrays for designing various functional nano materials.\n", "  The mechanism for flow generation in dense degenerate stellar atmospheres is\nsuggested when the electron gas is degenerate and ions are assumed to be\nclassical. It is shown, that there is a catastrophe in such system -- fast\nflows are generated due to magneto-fluid coupling near the surface. Distance\nover which acceleration appears is determined by the strength of gravity and\ndegeneracy parameter. Application of this mechanism for White Dwarfs'\natmospheres is examined and appropriate physical parameter range for flow\ngeneration/acceleration is found; possibility of the super-Alfv\\'enic flow\ngeneration is shown; the simultaneous possibility of flow acceleration and\nmagnetic field amplification for specific boundary conditions is explored; in\nsome cases initial background flow can be accelerated 100 and more times\nleading to transient jet formation while the Magnetic field amplification is\nless strong.\n", "  In this paper we study the numerical instabilities of the NLS Akhmediev\nbreather, the simplest space periodic, one-mode perturbation of the unstable\nbackground, limiting our considerations to the simplest case of one unstable\nmode. In agreement with recent theoretical findings of the authors, in the\nsituation in which the round-off errors are negligible with respect to the\nperturbations due to the discrete scheme used in the numerical experiments, the\nsplit-step Fourier method (SSFM), the numerical output is well-described by a\nsuitable genus 2 finite-gap solution of NLS. This solution can be written in\nterms of different elementary functions in different time regions and,\nultimately, it shows an exact recurrence of rogue waves described, at each\nappearance, by the Akhmediev breather. We discover a remarkable empirical\nformula connecting the recurrence time with the number of time steps used in\nthe SSFM and, via our recent theoretical findings, we establish that the SSFM\nopens up a vertical unstable gap whose length can be computed with high\naccuracy, and is proportional to the inverse of the square of the number of\ntime steps used in the SSFM. This neat picture essentially changes when the\nround-off error is sufficiently large. Indeed experiments in standard double\nprecision show serious instabilities in both the periods and phases of the\nrecurrence. In contrast with it, as predicted by the theory, replacing the\nexact Akhmediev Cauchy datum by its first harmonic approximation, we only\nslightly modify the numerical output. Let us also remark, that the first rogue\nwave appearance is completely stable in all experiments and is in perfect\nagreement with the Akhmediev formula and with the theoretical prediction in\nterms of the Cauchy data.\n", "  Comments are due on a recent paper by McGruder III (2017) in which the author\ndeals with the concept of gravitational repulsion in the context of the\nSchwarzschild-Droste solution. Repulsion (deceleration) for ingoing particles\ninto a black hole is a concept proposed several times starting from Droste\nhimself in 1916. It is a coordinate effect appearing to an observer at a remote\ndistance from the black hole and when coordinate time is employed. Repulsion\nhas no bearing and relation to the local physics of the black hole, and\nmoreover it cannot be held responsible for accelerating outgoing particles.\nThereby, the energy boost of cosmic rays cannot be produced by repulsion.\n", "  Proximity-effect-induced superconductivity was studied in epitaxial\ntopological insulator Bi2Se3 thin films grown on superconducting NbSe2 single\ncrystals. A point contact spectroscopy (PCS) method was used at low\ntemperatures down to 40 mK. An induced superconducting gap in Bi2Se3 was\nobserved in the spectra, which decreased with increasing Bi2Se3 layer\nthickness, consistent with the proximity effect in the bulk states of Bi2Se3\ninduced by NbSe2. At very low temperatures, an extra point contact feature\nwhich may correspond to a second energy gap appeared in the spectrum. For a 16\nquintuple layer Bi2Se3 on NbSe2 sample, the bulk state gap value near the top\nsurface is ~ 159 {\\mu}eV, while the second gap value is ~ 120 {\\mu}eV at 40 mK.\nThe second gap value decreased with increasing Bi2Se3 layer thickness, but the\nratio between the second gap and the bulk state gap remained about the same for\ndifferent Bi2Se3 thicknesses. It is plausible that this is due to\nsuperconductivity in Bi2Se3 topological surface states induced through the bulk\nstates. The two induced gaps in the PCS measurement are consistent with the\nthree-dimensional bulk state and the two-dimensional surface state\nsuperconducting gaps observed in the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) measurement.\n", "  Superconducting single crystals of Rb-intercalated FeSe compounds\nRb$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ were prepared by using a starting material of Rb$_2$Se\nas a Rb source. The superconducting properties and the surface microstructures\nwere systematically controlled by varying the cooling rate in the quenching\nprocess. The higher cooling rate in the sample provided a higher\nsuperconducting transition temperature with highly connected superconducting\nmesh-like surface structure. Extremely slow-cooling process led to the complete\nisolation between the superconducting domains.\n", "  The simulation of pedestrian crowd that reflects reality is a major challenge\nfor researches. Several crowd simulation models have been proposed such as\ncellular automata model, agent-based model, fluid dynamic model, etc. It is\nimportant to note that agent-based model is able, over others approaches, to\nprovide a natural description of the system and then to capture complex human\nbehaviors. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent simulation model in which\npedestrian positions are updated at discrete time intervals. It takes into\naccount the major normal conditions of a simple pedestrian situated in a crowd\nsuch as preferences, realistic perception of environment, etc. Our objective is\nto simulate the pedestrian crowd realistically towards a simulation of\nbelievable pedestrian behaviors. Typical pedestrian phenomena, including the\nunidirectional and bidirectional movement in a corridor as well as the flow\nthrough bottleneck, are simulated. The conducted simulations show that our\nmodel is able to produce realistic pedestrian behaviors. The obtained\nfundamental diagram and flow rate at bottleneck agree very well with classic\nconclusions and empirical study results. It is hoped that the idea of this\nstudy may be helpful in promoting the modeling and simulation of pedestrian\ncrowd in a simple way.\n", "  The nonequilibrium Time-Reversible Baker Map provides simple illustrations of\nthe Fluctuation Theorem, the Central Limit Theorem, and the Biased Random Walk.\nThis is material in preparation for the Book form of Carol's and my 2016\nKharagpur Lectures.\n", "  We present results of a two-scale model of disordered cellular materials\nwhere we describe the microstructure in an idealized manner using a beam\nnetwork model and then make a transition to a Cosserat-type continuum model\ndescribing the same material on the macroscopic scale. In such scale\ntransitions, normally either bottom-up homogenization approaches or top-down\nreverse modelling strategies are used in order to match the macro-scale\nCosserat continuum to the micro-scale beam network. Here we use a different\napproach that is based on an energetically consistent continuization scheme\nthat uses data from the beam network model in order to determine continuous\nstress and strain variables in a set of control volumes defined on the scale of\nthe individual microstructure elements (cells) in such a manner that they form\na continuous tessellation of the material domain. Stresses and strains are\ndetermined independently in all control volumes, and constitutive parameters\nare obtained from the ensemble of control volume data using a least-square\nerror criterion. We show that this approach yields material parameters that are\nfor regular honeycomb structures in close agreement with analytical results.\nFor strongly disordered cellular structures, the thus parametrized Cosserat\ncontinuum produces results that reproduce the behavior of the micro-scale beam\nmodels both in view of the observed strain patterns and in view of the\nmacroscopic response, including its size dependence.\n", "  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) is a wide field-of-view gamma-ray\nobservatory sensitive to gamma-rays in the 300 GeV - 100 TeV energy range,\nlocated in Mexico at an altitude of 4,100 m above sea level. The detector\nconsists of 300 Water Cherenkov Detectors with a volume of 200,000 l each,\nhaving a footprint of 22,000 $m^2$, a duty cycle of >95% and a field of view\n(FoV) of 2sr. In this work we present a general data quality inspection of HAWC\ndata for the years between 2014 and 2017 and also for two specific data periods\nselected on the base that GRB 150416A and GRB 160301A detected by FERMI\noccurred within the HAWC FoV, allowing to search for them in the HAWC data.\n", "  This review is based on the lectures given by the author at the Les Houches\nSummer School 2016. It describes the recently developed Quantum Spectral Curve\n(QSC) for a non-perturbative planar spectrum of N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory in\na pedagogical way starting from the harmonic oscillator and avoiding a long\nhistorical path. We give many examples and provide exercises. At the end we\ngive a list of the recent and possible future applications of the QSC.\n", "  It has recently been proposed that transport of energetic deuterium-trition\nions (Knudsen layer), owing to their long mean free path, may deplete the tail\nof the velocity distribution in the vicinity of the Gamow peak and thus serve\nto greatly reduce the yield of an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) plasma\n[Molvig \\emph{et al.}, \\emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, 109:095001 (2012)]. Molecular\ndynamics simulations of the non-equilibrium response of a fusion plasma to ion\ndistribution tail loss show that equilibrium is re-established extremely\nrapidly, with ion tail replenishment complete in less than 1 ps for $\\rho r >\n0.01$. The exceedingly fast relaxation of the fusion plasma dynamics, relative\nto the Fokker-Planck collisional operator, can be understood in terms of a\nlarge entropic driving force that pushes the phase space distribution toward a\nMaxwellian, and is a characteristic of the Lyupanov instability for the Coulomb\nsystem. The thermal reactivity $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ for the\nD(t,n)$\\alpha$ fusion reaction is calculated as a function of progress toward\nequilibrium for a series of densities relevant to ICF hot spot ignition.\n", "  A novel plasma state has been found in the presence of a uniform applied\naxial magnetic field in periodic cylindrical geometry. This state is driven\nelectrostatically by helical electrodes, providing a driving field that depends\non radius and $m\\theta-n\\zeta$, where $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle and\n$\\zeta=z/R$ is the toroidal angle. We focus on $m=n=1$. The radial magnetic\nfield at the wall is taken to be zero. With weak driving, the resulting\ndistortion is very small, but for stronger driving the mean field of the state\nhas field line safety factor $q_0(r)$ just above the pitch of the electrodes\n$m/n=1$ except near the edge, where $q_0$ increases monotonically. This state\nis characterized as a single helicity Ohmic equilibrium with the helical\nsymmetry of the applied field. The plasma appears to be close to force-free in\nthe interior, but current density crosses the magnetic flux surfaces near the\nedge, where current must enter and exit through the helical electrodes. This\nperpendicular current density drives large helical plasma flows. Sensitivity of\nthis state to flow boundary conditions, plasma resistivity profile, strength of\nthe electrostatic driving, and parameters such as the loop voltage and the\nLundquist number is explored. The magnetic helicity is calculated for both the\ntransient period and time-asymptotic state. Possible applications to current\ndrive in toroidal confinement devices and to electrical transformers are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The microcanonical effective partition function, constructed from a\nFeynman-Hibbs potential, is derived using generalized ensemble theory. The form\nof the effective Hamiltonian is amenable to Monte Carlo simulation techniques\nand the relevant Metropolis function is presented. Using the derived expression\nfor the microcanonical effective partition function, the low-temperature\nentropy of a proton in an anharmonic potential is numerically evaluated and\ncompared with the exact quantum mechanical canonical result.\n", "  Slow-roll inflationary scenario is considered in non-canonical scalar field\nmodel supposing a power-law function for kinetic term, and using two\nformalisms. In the first approach, the potential is considered as a power-law\nfunction, that is the most common approach in studying inflation.\nHamilton-Jacobi approach is selected as the second formalism, so that the\nHubble parameter is introduced as a function of scalar field instead of the\npotential. Employing the last observational data, the free parameters of the\nmodel are constrained, and the predicted form of the potential and attractor\nbehavior of the model are considered in detail.\n", "  Picking out DBI scalar field as inflation, the slow-rolling inflationary\nscenario is studied by attributing an exponential time function to scale\nfactor; known as intermediate inflation. The perturbation parameters of the\nmodel are estimated numerically for two different cases and the final result is\ncompared with Planck data. The diagram of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ versus\nscalar spectra index $n_s$ is illustrated, and it is found out that they are in\nacceptable range, as suggested by Planck. In addition, the acquired values for\namplitude of scalar perturbation reveals the ability of the model for depicting\na good picture of the universe in one of the earliest stage. As a further\nargument, the non-Gaussianity is investigated displaying that the model\nprediction stands in $68\\%$ CL regime; according to latest Planck data.\n", "  An oscillating vertical displacement of the Milky Way, with a wavelength of\nabout 8 kpc and and amplitude of about 100 pc (increasing with distance from\nthe Galactic center) is observed towards the Galactic anticenter. These\noscillations are thought to be the result of disk perturbations from dwarf\nsatellites of the Milky Way. They explain the Monoceros Ring and could be\nrelated to Milky Way spiral structure.\n", "  The tasks of identifying separation structures and clusters in flow data are\nfundamental to flow visualization. Significant work has been devoted to these\ntasks in flow represented by vector fields, but there are unique challenges in\naddressing these tasks for time-varying particle data. The unstructured nature\nof particle data, nonuniform and sparse sampling, and the inability to access\narbitrary particles in space-time make it difficult to define separation and\nclustering for particle data. We observe that weaker notions of separation and\nclustering through continuous measures of these structures are meaningful when\ncoupled with user exploration. We achieve this goal by defining a measure of\nparticle similarity between pairs of particles. More specifically, separation\noccurs when spatially-localized particles are dissimilar, while clustering is\ncharacterized by sets of particles that are similar to one another. To be\nrobust to imperfections in sampling we use diffusion geometry to compute\nparticle similarity. Diffusion geometry is parameterized by a scale that allows\na user to explore separation and clustering in a continuous manner. We\nillustrate the benefits of our technique on a variety of 2D and 3D flow\ndatasets, from particles integrated in fluid simulations based on time-varying\nvector fields, to particle-based simulations in astrophysics.\n", "  We demonstrate a novel approach to producing coherent, directional\nsupercontinuum via cascaded dispersive wave generation. By pumping in the\nnormal group-velocity dispersion regime, pulse compression of the first\ndispersive wave results in the generation of a second dispersive wave,\nresulting in an octave-spanning supercontinuum generated primarily to one side\nof the pump spectrum. We theoretically investigate the dynamics and show that\nthe generated spectrum is highly coherent. We experimentally confirm this\ndynamical behavior and the coherence properties in silicon nitride waveguides\nby performing direct detection of the carrier-envelope-offset frequency of our\nfemtosecond pump source using an f-2f interferometer. Our technique offers a\npath towards a stabilized, high-power, integrated supercontinuum source with\nlow noise and high coherence, with applications including direct comb\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Compact binary systems can provide us with unique information on\nastrophysical particle acceleration and cosmic ray production. However, only\nfive binary systems have ever been observed in TeV $\\gamma$ rays. The High\nAltitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has high uptime (duty cycle\n$>95\\%$) and a wide field of view (2 sr), making it well-suited for observing\ntransient sources such as binaries. Using two years of data from HAWC, we have\nsearched for TeV emission from three known TeV binary systems in the field of\nview and twenty-eight TeV binary candidates. We have searched the HAWC data for\nevidence of orbital modulation or flares from these objects, and report\nestimates of their $\\gamma$-ray flux.\n", "  Cosmic rays in the inner solar system are subject to deflection by both the\ngeomagnetic and interplanetary magnetic fields, and simultaneously interact\nwith the Sun's photosphere resulting in the production of gamma rays. This\nphenomenon can be studied by observing the deficit (\"shadow\") in the cosmic ray\nflux from the direction of the Sun and searching for an excess photon signal\nabove the isotropic background. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)\nObservatory in Mexico has been taking data on the solar disk at TeV energies\nsince the end of 2014. We present our first efforts to estimate the luminosity\nof TeV gamma rays from the Sun which can be used to place limits on the\nproduction mechanisms, including astrophysical processes and beyond the\nstandard model predictions.\n", "  A simple and high-efficiency method for direct generation of all-solid-state\nsingle- and dual-vortex lasers operating at eye-safe wavelengths is reported in\na compact diode-end-pumped Nd:YAG laser cavity. By off-axis pumping of the\nNd:YAG in two orthogonal directions, the original cavity mode, fundamental\nGaussian mode (TEM00), is directly transformed into first-order\nLaguerre-Gaussian (LG01) mode with single- or dual-vortex structures depending\non the degree of the off-axis pumping. Moreover, the single- and dual-vortex\nlasers can be produced in simultaneous eye-safe dual-wavelength operation with\nthe aid of an intracavity etalon. At the same time, a novel method to determine\nthe handedness of achieved vortex lasers by using a plane-concave mirror with\nsuitable coating is also proposed. This method can be perfectly applied to\ngenerate vortex lasers at other emissions bands for various applications by\nusing different laser gain mediums. This work paves a general way to simple and\nefficient realization and determination of vortex lasers.\n", "  Glueballs, an old and firm prediction of various QCD approaches (lattice QCD,\nbag models, AdS/QCD, effective models, etc.), have not yet been experimentally\nconfirmed. While for glueballs below $2.6$ GeV some candidates exist, the\nsituation for heavy glueballs (above $2.6$ GeV) is cloudy. Here, after a brief\nreview of scalar, tensor, and pseudoscalar glueballs, we present predictions\nfor the decays of a putative pseudotensor glueball with a lattice predicted\nmass of $3.04$ GeV and a putative vector glueball with a lattice predicted mass\nof $3.81$ GeV. Moreover, we discuss in general the width of heavy glueballs by\nusing large-$N_{c}$ arguments: we obtain a rough estimate according to which\nthe width of a glueball (such as the vector one) is about $10$ MeV. Such a\nwidth would be narrow enough to enable measurement at the future PANDA\nexperiment.\n", "  Based on a dendrimer graph theory, we investigate the ground state phase\ndiagrams of a nanostructure formed by three spins: $\\sigma=1/2$, S=1 and q=3/2.\nThis nanostructure is built on a dendrimer with triangular core geometry. More\nprecisely, we evaluate the effect of different physical parameters including\nthe exchange interactions, the external magnetic and the crystal fields. By\nvarying these parameters, we analytically elaborate the ground state phase\ndiagrams. Concretely, we found that the existence of the crystal field\nincreases the number of stable phases. The total number of possible phases is\n24=2x3x4, which are: ($\\pm$1/2,$\\pm$1,$\\pm$3/2), ($\\pm$1/2,0,$\\pm$3/2),\n($\\pm$1/2,$\\pm$1,$\\pm$1/2) and ($\\pm$1/2,0,$\\pm$1/2). All these phases are\nfound to be stable, expect two special phases: (+1/2,0,-3/2) and (-1/2,0,+3/2),\nwhich are masked by the other phases in all the ground state phase diagrams.\n", "  We ran several series of two-dimensional numerical mantle convection\nsimulations representing in idealized form the thermochemical evolution of a\nMars-like planet. In order to study the importance of compositional buoyancy of\nmelting mantle, the models were set up in pairs of one including all thermal\nand compositional contributions to buoyancy and one accounting only for the\nthermal contributions. In several of the model pairs, single large impacts were\nintroduced as causes of additional strong local anomalies, and their evolution\nin the framework of the convecting mantle was tracked. The models confirm that\nthe additional buoyancy provided by the depletion of the mantle by regular\nmelting can establish a global stable stratification of the convecting mantle\nand throttle crust production. Furthermore, the compositional buoyancy is\nessential in the stabilization and preservation of local compositional\nanomalies directly beneath the lithosphere and offers a possible explanation\nfor the existence of distinct, long-lived reservoirs in the martian mantle. The\ndetection of such anomalies by geophysical means is probably difficult,\nhowever; they are expected to be detected by gravimetry rather than by seismic\nor heat flow measurements. The results further suggest that the crustal\nthickness can be locally overestimated by up to ~20 km if impact-induced\ndensity anomalies in the mantle are neglected.\n", "  One of the possible signs of life on distant habitable exoplanets is the\nred-edge, which is a rise in the reflectivity of planets between visible and\nnear-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Previous studies suggested the possibility\nthat the red-edge position for habitable exoplanets around M-dwarfs may be\nshifted to a longer wavelength than that for Earth. We investigated plausible\nred-edge position in terms of the light environment during the course of the\nevolution of phototrophs. We show that phototrophs on M-dwarf habitable\nexoplanets may use visible light when they first evolve in the ocean and when\nthey first colonize the land. The adaptive evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis\nmay eventually also use NIR radiation, by one of two photochemical reaction\ncenters, with the other center continuing to use visible light. These\n\"two-color\" reaction centers can absorb more photons, but they will encounter\ndifficulty in adapting to drastically changing light conditions at the boundary\nbetween land and water. NIR photosynthesis can be more productive on land,\nthough its evolution would be preceded by the Earth-type vegetation. Thus, the\nred-edge position caused by photosynthetic organisms on habitable M-dwarf\nexoplanets could initially be similar to that on Earth and later move to a\nlonger wavelength.\n", "  A convective model describing the nature and structure of the roton is\nproposed. According to the model, the roton is a cylindrical convective cell\nwith free horizontal boundaries. On the basis of the model, the characteristic\ngeometric dimensions of the roton are estimated, and the spatial distribution\nof the velocity of the helium atoms and the perturbed temperature inside are\ndescribed. It is assumed that the spatial distribution of rotons has a\nhorizontally multilayer periodic structure, from which follows the quantization\nof the energy spectrum of rotons. The noted quantization allows us to\nadequately describe the energy spectrum of rotons. The convective model is\nquantitatively confirmed by experimental data on the measurement of the density\nof the normal component of helium II, the scattering of neutrons and light by\nhelium II. The use of a convective model for describing the scattering of light\nby Helium II made it possible to estimate the dipole moment of the roton, as\nwell as the number of helium atoms participating in the formation of the roton.\n", "  We study multi-peak solitons \\textit{on a plane-wave background} in an\nerbium-doped fiber system with some higher-order effects, which is governed by\na coupled Hirota and Maxwel-Bloch (H-MB) model. The important characteristics\nof multi-peak solitons induced by the higher-order effects, such as the\nvelocity changes, localization or periodicity attenuation, and state\ntransitions, are revealed in detail. In particular, our results demonstrate\nexplicitly that a multi-peak soliton can be converted to an anti-dark soliton\nwhen the periodicity vanishes; on the other hand, a multi-peak soliton is\ntransformed to a periodic wave when the localization vanishes. Numerical\nsimulations are performed to confirm the propagation stability of multi-peak\nsolitons riding on a plane-wave background. Finally, we compare and discuss the\nsimilarity and difference of multi-peak solitons in special degenerate cases of\nthe H-MB system with general existence conditions.\n", "  The integration of MOCVD grown group III-A nitride device stacks on Si (111)\nsubstrates is critically dependent on the quality of the first AlN buffer layer\ngrown. A Si surface that is both oxide-free and smooth is a primary requirement\nfor nucleating such layers. A single parameter, the AlN layer growth stress, is\nshown to be an early (within 50 nm), clear (<0.5 GPa versus >1 GPa) and\nfail-safe indicator of the pre-growth surface, and the AlN quality required for\nsuccessful epitaxy. Grain coalescence model for stress generation is used to\ncorrelate growth stress, the AlN-Si interface and crystal quality.\n", "  We report on the interfacial electronic properties of HfO2 gate dielectrics\nboth, with GaN towards normally-OFF recessed HEMT architectures and the AlGaN\nbarrier for normally-ON AlGaN/GaN MISHEMTs for GaN device platforms on Si. A\nconduction band offset of 1.9 eV is extracted for HfO2/GaN along with a very\nlow density of fixed bulk and interfacial charges. Conductance measurements on\nHfO2/GaN MOSCAPs reveal an interface trap state continuum with a density of\n9.37x1012 eV-1cm-2 centered at 0.48 eV below EC. The forward and reverse\ncurrent densities are shown to be governed by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling and\nPoole-Frenkel emission respectively. Normally-ON HfO2/AlGaN/GaN MISHEMTs\nexhibit negligible shifts in threshold voltage, transconductances of 110mS/mm\nfor 3 {\\mu}m gate length devices, and three-terminal OFF-state gate leakage\ncurrents of 20 nA/mm at a VD of 100 V. Dynamic capacitance dispersion\nmeasurements show two peaks at the AlGaN/GaN interface corresponding to slow\nand fast interface traps with a peak Dit of 5.5x1013 eV-1cm-2 and 1.5x1013\neV-1cm-2 at trap levels 0.55 eV and 0.46 eV below EC respectively. The\nHfO2/AlGaN interface exhibits a peak Dit of 4.4x1013 eV-1cm- 2 at 0.45 eV below\nEC.\n", "  The non-ducted propagation characteristics of the VLF waves in the inner\nmagnetosphere were studied with respect to their frequency, source\nlocalization, and initial wave normal angle, between the wave-normal and the\nbackground magnetic field. The ray tracing software based on multi-components\ncold plasma approach was developed by use of the IGRF magnetic field model and\nthe GCPM model of plasma density. We described dynamics of the wave-normals\ndirection during its propagation and magnetospheric reflection. We showed that\nwhistler waves can be reflected when lower hybrid resonance frequency becomes\ngreater than the wave frequency: w_LH>w. It corresponds to the magnetic\nlatitude of ~50 degrees. The simulation results confirmed the inapplicability\nof the quasi-longitudinal approximation to describe the propagation of\nmagnetospheric whistlers. The simulation results of chorus emissions\npropagation, which used realistic distributions of waves on the initial\nparameters were presented. Particularly, we obtained distributions of chorus\nemission waves in dependence on the wave-normal directions for different\nmagnetic latitudes. It is required for studying diffusive processes in the\nradiation belts. The results were found to be in a good agreement with the\nCLUSTER STAFF-SA measurements.\n", "  In this work we address the ground state magnetization in graphene,\nconsidering the Zeeman effect and taking into account the conduction electrons\nin the long wavelength approximation. We obtain analytical expressions for the\nmagnetization at T=0 K, where the oscillations given by the de Haas van Alphen\n(dHvA) effect are present. We find that the Zeeman effect modifies the\nmagnetization by introducing new peaks associated with the spin splitting of\nthe Landau levels. These peaks are very small for typical carrier densities in\ngraphene, but become more important for higher densities. The obtained results\nprovide insight of the way in which the Zeeman effect modifies the\nmagnetization, which can be useful to control and manipulate the spin degrees\nof freedom.\n", "  The matrix Schr\\\"odinger equation is considered on the half line with the\ngeneral selfadjoint boundary condition at the origin described by two boundary\nmatrices satisfying certain appropriate conditions. It is assumed that the\nmatrix potential is integrable, is selfadjoint, and has a finite first moment.\nThe corresponding scattering data set is constructed, and such scattering data\nsets are characterized by providing a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions assuring the existence and uniqueness of the correspondence between\nthe scattering data set and the input data set containing the potential and\nboundary matrices. The work presented here provides a generalization of the\nclassical result by Agranovich and Marchenko from the Dirichlet boundary\ncondition to the general selfadjoint boundary condition. The theory presented\nis illustrated with various explicit examples.\n", "  Certain areas of scientific research flourish while others lose advocates and\nattention. We are interested in whether structural patterns within citation\nnetworks correspond to the growth or decline of the research areas to which\nthose networks belong. We focus on three topic areas within optical physics as\na set of cases; those areas have developed along different trajectories: one\ncontinues to expand rapidly; another is on the wane after an earlier peak; the\nfinal area has re-emerged after a short waning period. These three areas have\nsubstantial overlaps in the types of equipment they use and general\nmethodology; at the same time, their citation networks are largely independent\nof each other. For each of our three areas, we map the citation networks of the\ntop-100 most-cited papers, published pre-1999. In order to quantify the\nstructures of the selected articles' citation networks, we use a modified\nversion of weak tie theory in tandem with entropy measures. Although the\nfortunes of a given research area are most obviously the result of accumulated\ninnovations and impasses, our preliminary study provides evidence that these\ncitation networks' emergent structures reflect those developments and may shape\nevolving conversations in the scholarly literature.\n", "  We report on the integration of large area CVD grown single- and bilayer\ngraphene transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) on amorphous silicon\nmultispectral photodetectors. The broadband transmission of graphene results in\n440% enhancement of the detectors' spectral response in the ultraviolet (UV)\nregion at {\\lambda} = 320 nm compared to reference devices with conventional\naluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) electrodes. The maximum responsivity of the\nmultispectral photodetectors can be tuned in their wavelength from 320 nm to\n510 nm by an external bias voltage, allowing single pixel detection of UV to\nvisible light. Graphene electrodes further enable fully flexible diodes on\npolyimide substrates. Here, an upgrade from single to bilayer graphene boosts\nthe maximum photoresponsivity from 134 mA $W^{-1}$ to 239 mA $W^{-1}$.\nInterference patterns that are present in conventional TCE devices are\nsuppressed as a result of the atomically thin graphene electrodes. The proposed\ndetectors may be of interest in fields of UV/VIS spectroscopy or for biomedical\nand life science applications, where the extension to the UV range can be\nessential.\n", "  Graphene membranes act as highly sensitive transducers in\nnanoelectromechanical devices due to their ultimate thinness. Previously, the\npiezoresistive effect has been experimentally verified in graphene using\nuniaxial strain in graphene. Here we report experimental and theoretical data\non the uni- and biaxial piezoresistive properties of suspended graphene\nmembranes applied to piezoresistive pressure sensors. A detailed model that\nutilizes a linearized Boltzman transport equation describes accurately the\ncharge carrier density and mobility in strained graphene, and hence the gauge\nfactor. The gauge factor is found to be practically independent of the doping\nconcentration and crystallographic orientation of the graphene films. These\ninvestigations provide deeper insight into the piezoresistive behavior of\ngraphene membranes.\n", "  Despite the long history, so far there is no general theoretical framework\nfor calculating the acoustic emission spectrum accompanying any plastic\ndeformation. We set up a discrete wave equation with plastic strain rate as a\nsource term and include the Rayleigh-dissipation function to represent\ndissipation accompanying acoustic emission. We devise a method of bridging the\nwidely separated time scales of plastic deformation and elastic degrees of\nfreedom. The efficacy of the framework is illustrated by considering three\ndistinct cases of plastic deformation. The first one is the acoustic emission\nduring a typical continuous yield exhibiting a smooth stress-strain curve. We\nfirst construct an appropriate set of evolution equations for two types of\ndislocation densities and then show that the shape of the model stress-strain\ncurve and accompanying acoustic emission spectrum match very well with\nexperimental results. The second and the third are the more complex cases of\nthe Portevin-Le Chatelier bands and the L\\\"uders band. These two cases are\ndealt with in the context of the Ananthakrishna model since the model predicts\nthe three types of the Portevin-Le Chatelier bands and also L\\\"uders-like\nbands. Our results show that for the type-C bands where the serration amplitude\nis large, the acoustic emission spectrum consists of well-separated bursts of\nacoustic emission. At higher strain rates of hopping type-B bands, the\nburst-type acoustic emission spectrum tends to overlap, forming a nearly\ncontinuous background with some sharp acoustic emission bursts. The latter can\nbe identified with the nucleation of new bands. The acoustic emission spectrum\nassociated with the continuously propagating type-A band is continuous. These\npredictions are consistent with experimental results. The acoustic emission\nspectrum of the L\\\"uders-like band matches with recent experiments as well.\n", "  We derive the gravitational dynamics of the tensorial geometry which\nunderlies the most general linear theory of electrodynamics that features weak\nbirefringence in vacuo. This derivation is performed by way of gravitational\nclosure, which is a mechanism that employs the causal structure of any\ncanonically quantizable matter dynamics on some tensorial spacetime geometry in\norder to derive canonical dynamics for the latter. The resulting\neleven-parameter family of weak gravitational field equations allows to predict\nwhere vacuum birefringence will occur, if there is any.\n", "  These lectures are a brief introduction to scattering amplitudes. We begin\nwith a review of basic kinematical concepts like the spinor helicity formalism,\nfollowed by a tutorial on bootstrapping tree-level scattering amplitudes.\nAfterwards, we discuss on-shell recursion relations and soft theorems,\nemphasizing their broad applicability to gravity, gauge theory, and effective\nfield theories. Lastly, we report on some of the new field theoretic structures\nwhich have emerged from the on-shell picture, focusing primarily on\ncolor-kinematics duality.\n", "  In recent years, there has been significant debate and discussion about the\nglaring gender disparity in the physical sciences. To better understand and\naddress this within the Australian Space Research Community, in 2015 we began\nthe process of keeping a record of the gender balance at the annual Australian\nSpace Research Conference. In addition, we began holding an annual 'Women in\nSpace Research' lunch at that meeting, to discuss the situation, and search for\nroutes by which issues of equity can be addressed, and the situation improved.\nWe present an update based on the 16th Australian Space Research Conference,\nheld at RMIT, Melbourne, in September 2016. As in 2015, male attendees\noutnumbered female attendees approximately 3:1. However, there was a small\nshift (~2.3%) in the balance, with female delegates now making up 26.4% of the\ntotal, up from 24.1% in 2015. This shift was mirrored in the gender\ndistribution of talks, with 28.9% of all oral presentations being given by\nwomen (up from 25.2%). More striking, however, were the changes in the\ndistribution of plenary presentations (44.4% female, up from 22.2%), poster\npresentations (31.8% female, up from 7.7%), and student awards (33.3% female,\nup from 12.5%). These changes are encouraging, and will hopefully continue in\nyears to come. The conference organising committee again mirrored the gender\nbalance of the delegates as a whole (27.3 % female vs. 26.4% of delegates),\nthough the program committee was markedly more male-dominated this year than\nlast (82.4% male, against last year's 72.2%). At this year's 'Women in Space\nResearch' lunchtime event, a number of suggestions were made that could help to\nmake future conferences, and the wider community, a more equitable place... ---\nabstract abridged ---\n", "  We briefly review a class of four dimensional $\\mathcal N=3$ field theories\nconstructed by taking a quotient of $\\mathcal N=4$ SYM with gauge group $U(N)$.\nThe quotient involves a discrete symmetry that only exists for specific, order\none, values of the coupling constant, so the resulting theories are\nintrinsically strongly coupled. These theories admit a simple realization in\nstring theory as the worldvolume theory of a stack of D3 branes probing a\ngeneralized orientifold plane, or S-fold. Their holographic dual is given by a\nnon-trivial F-theory fibration over $AdS_5 \\times S^5/\\mathbb Z_k$ which is\nweakly curved but with the string coupling frozen at an order one value.\n", "  In this contribution we aim to study the stability boundaries of solutions at\nequilibria for a second-order oscillator networks with SN-symmetry, we look for\nnon-degenerate Hopf bifurcations as the time-delay between nodes increases. The\nremarkably simple stability criterion for synchronous solutions which, in the\ncase of first-order self-oscillators, states that stability depends only on the\nsign of the coupling function derivative, is extended to a generic coupling\nfunction for second-order oscillators. As an application example, the stability\nboundaries for a N-node Phase-Locked Loop network is analysed.\n", "  Hexagonal ferrites do not only have enormous commercial impact ({\\pounds}2\nbillion/year in sales) due to applications that include ultra-high density\nmemories, credit card stripes, magnetic bar codes, small motors and low-loss\nmicrowave devices, they also have fascinating magnetic and ferroelectric\nquantum properties at low temperatures. Here we report the results of tuning\nthe magnetic ordering temperature in PbFe$_{12-x}$Ga$_x$O$_{19}$ to zero by\nchemical substitution $x$. The phase transition boundary is found to vary as\n$T_N \\sim (1-x/x_c)^{2/3}$ with $x_c$ very close to the calculated spin\npercolation threshold which we determine by Monte Carlo simulations, indicating\nthat the zero-temperature phase transition is geometrically driven. We find\nthat this produces a form of compositionally-tuned, insulating, ferrimagnetic\nquantum criticality. Close to the zero temperature phase transition we observe\nthe emergence of an electric-dipole glass induced by magneto-electric coupling.\nThe strong frequency behaviour of the glass freezing temperature $T_m$ has a\nVogel-Fulcher dependence with $T_m$ finite, or suppressed below zero in the\nzero frequency limit, depending on composition $x$. These quantum-mechanical\nproperties, along with the multiplicity of low-lying modes near to the\nzero-temperature phase transition, are likely to greatly extend applications of\nhexaferrites into the realm of quantum and cryogenic technologies.\n", "  Materials science has adopted the term of auxetic behavior for structural\ndeformations where stretching in some direction entails lateral widening,\nrather than lateral shrinking. Most studies, in the last three decades, have\nexplored repetitive or cellular structures and used the notion of negative\nPoisson's ratio as the hallmark of auxetic behavior. However, no general\nauxetic principle has been established from this perspective. In the present\npaper, we show that a purely geometric approach to periodic auxetics is apt to\nidentify essential characteristics of frameworks with auxetic deformations and\ncan generate a systematic and endless series of periodic auxetic designs. The\ncritical features refer to convexity properties expressed through families of\nhomothetic ellipsoids.\n", "  Various lower- and higher-order nonclassical properties have been studied for\ntwo physical systems- (i) an optomechanical system composed of a Fabry-Perot\ncavity with one nonlinearly oscillating mirror and (ii) an optomechanical-like\nsystem formed using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped inside an optical\ncavity. The investigation is performed using a perturbation method that leads\nto closed form analytic expressions for the time evolution of the relevant\nbosonic operators. In the first system, it is observed that the radiation\npressure coupling leads to the emergence of lower- and higher-order squeezing,\nantibunching, entanglement and intermodal squeezing. The effects of the\ncoherent interaction of a nonlinear oscillating mirror with the cavity mode are\nstudied, and it is observed that the optomechanical system studied here becomes\nmore nonclassical (entangled) when the coupling strength is increased. It is\nalso observed that the possibility of observing entanglement depends on the\nphase of the movable mirror. The Hamiltonian of the trapped BEC system is\nobtained as a special case of the Hamiltonian of the first system, and the\nexistence of various nonclassicality in the trapped BEC system has been\nestablished, and variations of those with various physical parameters have been\nreported with an aim to understand the underlying physical process that leads\nto and controls the nonclassicality.\n", "  When pristine material surfaces are exposed to air, highly reactive broken\nbonds can promote the formation of surface oxides with structures and\nproperties differing greatly from bulk. Determination of the oxide structure,\nhowever, is often elusive through the use of indirect diffraction methods or\ntechniques that probe only the outer most layer. As a result, surface oxides\nforming on widely used materials, such as group III-nitrides, have not been\nunambiguously resolved, even though critical properties can depend sensitively\non their presence. In this work, aberration corrected scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy reveals directly, and with depth dependence, the structure\nof native two--dimensional oxides that form on AlN and GaN surfaces. Through\natomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy, we show that the oxide layers are\ncomprised of tetrahedra--octahedra cation--oxygen units, similar to bulk\n$\\theta$--Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\\beta$--Ga$_2$O$_3$. By applying density functional\ntheory, we show that the observed structures are more stable than previously\nproposed surface oxide models. We place the impact of these observations in the\ncontext of key III-nitride growth, device issues, and the recent discovery of\ntwo-dimnesional nitrides.\n", "  Obtaining the heat production (HP) in the lithosphere has always been a\nchallenge for the geotherms and evolution of continents. By transforming the\nnonlinear stable heat conduction equation into a linear Poisson's potential\none, we propose a method to infer the HP in the stable continental lithosphere.\nThis method estimates the HP through the inversion of the corresponding heat\nflow (HF) observations. Either the distribution of HP within the lithosphere or\ngeometry of HP interfaces (even the both) can be inverted. Herein we focus on\nthe inversion of the geometry of the HP interface. An analogical\nParker-Oldenburg formula, which is often used in the inversion of potential\nfield, is deduced for this purpose. This analogical formula is based on a\nrelationship between the Fourier transform of the corresponding HF observations\nand the sum of the Fourier transform for the powers of the interface geometry.\nWhen the mean depth of the HP interface and the HP contrast between the two\nmedia are given, one to three-dimensional geometry of the HP interface can be\niteratively calculated. As a case study, we construct a HP model for the\nlithosphere of the Ordos geological block and its adjacent area in China, in\nwhich three-dimensional geometry of the upper crustal HP interface is\nestimated. It is found that the geometry of this HP interface distribute uneven\nin a magnitude of dozens of km. With this HP model, the geotherms for the Ordos\ngeological block and its adjacent area is calculated further, which fit the\nconstraints from the studies on the xenolith and tectonics well.\n", "  Energy extraction from a rotating or charged black hole is one of fascinating\nissues in general relativity. The collisional Penrose process is one of such\nextraction mechanisms and has been reconsidered intensively since Banados, Silk\nand West pointed out the physical importance of very high energy collisions\naround a maximally rotating black hole. In order to get results analytically,\nthe test particle approximation has been adopted so far. Successive works based\non this approximation scheme have not yet revealed the upper bound on the\nefficiency of the energy extraction because of lack of the back reaction. In\nthe Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime, by fully taking into account the self-gravity\nof the shells, we find that there is an upper bound on the extracted energy,\nwhich is consistent with the area law of a black hole. We also show one\nparticular scenario in which the almost maximum energy extraction is achieved\neven without the Banados-Silk-West collision.\n", "  PicSat is a nanosatellite developed to observe the transit of the giant\nplanet beta Pictoris b, expected in late 2017. Its science objectives are: the\nobservation of the transit of the giant planet's Hill sphere, the detection of\nexocomets in the system, and the fine monitoring of the circumstellar disk\ninhomogeneities. To answer these objectives without exceeding the possibilities\nof a 3-unit Cubesat in terms of mass and power budget, a small but ambitious 2\nkg opto-mechanical payload was designed. The instrument, specifically made for\nhigh precision photometry, uses a 3.5 cm effective aperture telescope which\ninjects the light in a single-mode optical fiber linked to an avalanche\nphotodiode. To ensure the stability of the light injection in the fiber, a fine\npointing system based on a two-axis piezoelectric actuation system, is used.\nThis system will achieve a sub-arcsecond precision, and ensure that an overall\nphotometric precision of at least 200 ppm/hr can be reached.\n", "  Online social networks (OSNs) have become the main medium for connecting\npeople, sharing knowledge and information, and for communication. The social\nconnections between people using these OSNs are formed as virtual links (e.g.,\nfriendship and following connections) that connect people. These links are the\nheart of today's OSNs as they facilitate all of the activities that the members\nof a social network can do. However, many of these networks suffer from noisy\nlinks, i.e., links that do not reflect a real relationship or links that have a\nlow intensity, that change the structure of the network and prevent accurate\nanalysis of these networks. Hence, a process for assessing and ranking the\nlinks in a social network is crucial in order to sustain a healthy and real\nnetwork. Here, we define link assessment as the process of identifying noisy\nand non-noisy links in a network. In this paper, we address the problem of link\nassessment and link ranking in social networks using external interaction\nnetworks. In addition to a friendship social network, additional exogenous\ninteraction networks are utilized to make the assessment process more\nmeaningful. We employed machine learning classifiers for assessing and ranking\nthe links in the social network of interest using the data from exogenous\ninteraction networks. The method was tested with two different datasets, each\ncontaining the social network of interest, with the ground truth, along with\nthe exogenous interaction networks. The results show that it is possible to\neffectively assess the links of a social network using only the structure of a\nsingle network of the exogenous interaction networks, and also using the\nstructure of the whole set of exogenous interaction networks. The experiments\nshowed that some classifiers do better than others regarding both link\nclassification and link ranking.\n", "  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory consists of\n300 water Cherenkov detectors and has been fully operational since March 2015\nin central Mexico. It detects cosmic- and gamma-ray showers in the TeV energy\nrange. For multi-TeV energies, the shower reconstruction and hence the\nperformance of the detector is affected by the partial containment of the\nshowers within the array. To improve the sensitivity at the highest energies,\nHAWC is being upgraded with an outrigger array. It consists of 350 comparably\nmuch smaller water Cherenkov detectors, sparsely distributed around the HAWC\nmain array. It will increase the instrumented area by a factor of 4-5. In this\ncontribution, we will present the current status of the upgrade as well as\nsimulation results on anticipated improvements in the performance of the\nobservatory.\n", "  A new hydrodynamic framework for particles with spin 1/2, based solely on the\nconservation laws for charge, energy, momentum and angular momentum, is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was originally conceived as a volumetric\nimaging method. Quickly, OCT images went beyond structural data and started to\nprovide functional information about an object enabling for example\nvisualization of blood flow or tissue elasticity. Minimal or no need for system\nalterations make functional OCT techniques useful in performing multimodal\nimaging, where differently contrasted images are produced in a single\nexamination. We propose a method that further extends the current capabilities\nof OCT and requires no modifications to the system. Our algorithm provides\ninformation about the sample's Group Velocity Dispersion (GVD) and can be\neasily applied to any OCT dataset acquired with a Fourier domain system. GVD is\ncalculated from the difference in material's optical thickness measured from\ntwo images obtained for different spectral ranges. Instead of using two\nseparate light sources, we propose to apply a filter-based, numerical procedure\nthat synthesizes two spectra from one broadband spectrum. We discuss the\nlimitations of the method and present GVD values for BK7 and sapphire and\nocular media: cornea and aqueous humour of a rat eye. Results corroborate\nprevious measurements using two different light sources.\n", "  Gamma-ray binaries are variable sources of GeV-to-TeV photons with the peak\nin their spectral energy distributions above 100 MeV. There are only five\nGalactic gamma-ray binaries known and the processes which govern particle\nacceleration, non-thermal emission and the variability patterns are not well\nunderstood. We present here for the first time results of the VERITAS binary\ndiscovery program at VHE energies and a summary of eleven years of observations\nof the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057. VERITAS has acquired more than 220\nhours of observations on HESS J0632+057. The results are discussed in the\ncontext of contemporaneous observations with Swift XRT at X-ray energies.\n", "  Eventdisplay is a software package for the analysis and reconstruction of\ndata and Monte Carlo events from ground-based gamma-ray observatories such as\nVERITAS and CTA. It was originally developed as a display tool for data from\nthe VERITAS prototype telescope, but evolved into a full analysis package with\nroutines for calibration, FADC trace integration, image and stereo parameter\nanalysis, response function calculation, and high-level analysis steps.\nEventdisplay makes use of an image parameter analysis combined with\ngamma-hadron separation methods based on multivariate algorithms. An overview\nof the reconstruction methods and some selected results are presented in this\ncontribution.\n", "  Anomalous behavior of water in superooled region (namely decrease of density\nand sharp increase of response functions at atmospheric pressure) are manly\nassociated with either existence of liquid-liquid criticality or re-entering\nvapor-liquid spinodal into positive pressure. Despite different origin both\nscenarios introduce divergence of the response functions. We articulate in the\ncommunication that the criticality is behind water anomalies, water has normal\nvapor-liquid spinodal and that the re-entering feature was predicted because of\ncurved density surface as a consequence of existence of critical point. We can\nproof this by new two structure equation of state with criticality resulting\nfrom non-ideal mixing of two states and a background state being modeled by\nexactly the same equation of state which was deployed for predicting of\nvapor-liquid spinodal while formulating the re-entering scenario.\n", "  It is now a common practice to use local magnetic parameters such as magnetic\ndecay index for explaining solar eruptions from active regions, but there can\nbe an alternative view that the global properties of the source region should\nbe counted as a more important factor. We discuss this issue based on {\\it\nSolar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) observations of the three successive\neruptions within 1.5 hours from the NOAA active region 11444 and the magnetic\nparameters calculated using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model. Two\nviolent eruptions occurred in the regions with relatively high magnetic twist\nnumber (0.5--1.5) and high decay index (0.9--1.1) at the nominal height of the\nfilament (12$''$) and otherwise a mild eruption occurred, which supports the\nlocal parameter paradigm. Our main point is that the time sequence of the\neruptions did not go with these parameters. It is argued that an additional\nfactor, in the form of stabilizing force, should operate to determine the onset\nof the first eruption and temporal behaviors of subsequent eruptions. As\nsupporting evidence, we report that the heating and fast plasma flow continuing\nfor a timescale of an hour was the direct cause for the first eruption, and\nthat the unidirectional propagation of the disturbance determined the timing of\nsubsequent eruptions. Both of these factors are associated with the overall\nmagnetic structure rather than local magnetic properties of the active region.\n", "  How eruption can recur from a confined magnetic structure is discussed based\non the {\\it Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) observations of the NOAA active\nregion 11444, which produced three eruptions within 1.5 hours on March 27,\n2012. The active region had the positive polarity magnetic fields in the center\nsurrounded by the negative polarity fields around. Since such a distribution of\nmagnetic polarity tends to form a dome-like magnetic fan structure confined\nover the active region, the multiple eruptions was puzzling. Our investigation\nreveals that this event exhibits several properties distinct from other\neruptions associated with magnetic fan structures: (i) a long filament\nencircling the active region was present before the eruptions; (ii) expansion\nof the open-closed boundary of the field lines after each eruption suggestive\nof the growing fan-dome structure, and (iii) the ribbons inside the closed\nmagnetic polarity inversion line evolving in response to the expanding\nopen-closed boundary. It thus appears that in spite of multiple eruptions the\nfan-dome structure remained undamaged, and the closing back field lines after\neach eruption rather reinforced the fan-dome structure. We argue that the\nmultiple eruptions could occur in this active region in spite of its confined\nmagnetic structure because the filament encircling the active region was\nadequate for slipping through the magnetic separatrix to minimize the damage to\nits overlying fan-dome structure. The result of this study provides a new\ninsight into the productivity of eruptions from a confined magnetic structure.\n", "  Spectral graph wavelets introduce a notion of scale in networks, and are thus\nused to obtain a local view of the network from each node. By carefully\nconstructing a wavelet filter function for these wavelets, a multi-scale\ncommunity detection method for monoplex networks has already been developed.\nThis construction takes advantage of the partitioning properties of the network\nLaplacian. In this paper we elaborate on a novel method which uses spectral\ngraph wavelets to detect multi-scale communities in temporal networks. To do\nthis we extend the definition of spectral graph wavelets to temporal networks\nby adopting a multilayer framework. We use arguments from Perturbation Theory\nto investigate the spectral properties of the supra-Laplacian matrix for\nclustering purposes in temporal networks. Using these properties, we construct\na new wavelet filter function, which attenuates the influence of uninformative\neigenvalues and centres the filter around eigenvalues which contain information\non the coarsest description of prevalent community structures over time. We use\nthe spectral graph wavelets as feature vectors in a connectivity-constrained\nclustering procedure to detect multi-scale communities at different scales, and\nrefer to this method as Temporal Multi-Scale Community Detection (TMSCD). We\nvalidate the performance of TMSCD and a competing methodology on various\nbenchmarks. The advantage of TMSCD is the automated selection of relevant\nscales at which communities should be sought.\n", "  The heaviest of the transuranic elements known as superheavy elements (SHE)\nare produced in nuclear reactions in a few specialized laboratories located in\nGermany, the U.S., Russia, and Japan. The history of this branch of physical\nscience provides several case studies of interest to the philosophy and\nsociology of modern science. The story of SHE illuminates the crucial notion of\nwhat constitutes a chemical element, what the criteria are for discovering a\nnew element, and how an element is assigned a name. The story also cast light\non the sometimes uneasy relationship between physics and chemistry. It is far\nfrom obvious that elements with Z > 110 exist in the same sense as oxygen or\nsodium exists. The answers are not given by nature but by international\ncommissions responsible for the criteria and evaluation of discovery claims.\nThe works of these commissions and of SHE research in general have often been\ncontroversial.\n", "  Optimised stellarators and other magnetic-confinement devices having the\nproperty that the average magnetic curvature is favourable for all particle\norbits are called maximum-$J$ devices, and have recently been shown to be\nimmune to trapped-particle instabilities driven by the density gradient.\nGyrokinetic simulations reveal, however, that another instability can arise,\nwhich is also associated with particle trapping but causes less transport than\ntypical trapped-electron modes. The nature of this instability is clarified\nhere. It is shown to be similar to the \"ubiquitous mode\" in tokamaks, and is\ndriven by ion free energy but requires trapped electrons to exist.\n", "  Strain can be used as an effective tool to tune the crystal structure of\nmaterials and hence to modify their electronic structures, including\ntopological properties. Here, taking Na3Bi as a paradigmatic example, we\ndemonstrated with first-principles calculations and k$\\cdot$p models that the\ntopological phase transitions can be induced by various types of strains. For\ninstance, the Dirac semimetal phase of ambient Na3Bi can be tuned into a\ntopological insulator (TI) phase by uniaxial strain along the h100i axis.\nHydrostatic pressure can let the ambient structure transfer into a new\nthermodynamically stable phase with Fm-3m symmetry, coming with a perfect\nparabolic semimetal having a single contact point between the conduction and\nvalence bands, exactly at $\\Gamma$ point on the Fermi level like $\\alpha$-Sn.\nFurthermore, uniaxial strain in the <100> direction can tune the new parabolic\nsemimetal phase into a Dirac semimetal, while shear strains in both the <100>\nand <111> directions can take the new parabolic semimetal phase into a TI.\nk$\\cdot$p models are constructed to gain more insights into these quantum\ntopological phase transitions. At last, we calculated surface states of Fm-3m\nNa3Bi without and with strains to verify these topological transitions.\n", "  Germanium telluride features special spin-electric effects originating from\nspin-orbit coupling and symmetry breaking by the ferroelectric lattice\npolarization, which opens up many prospectives for electrically tunable and\nswitchable spin electronic devices. By Mn doping of the {\\alpha}-GeTe host\nlattice, the system becomes a multiferroic semiconductor possessing\nmagnetoelectric properties in which the electric polarization, magnetization\nand spin texture are coupled to each other. Employing spin- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy in bulk- and surface-sensitive energy ranges and by\nvarying dipole transition matrix elements, we disentangle the bulk, surface and\nsurface-resonance states of the electronic structure and determine the spin\ntextures for selected parameters. From our results, we derive a comprehensive\nmodel of the {\\alpha}-GeTe surface electronic structure which fits experimental\ndata and first principle theoretical predictions and we discuss the\nunconventional evolution of the Rashba-type spin splitting upon manipulation by\nexternal B- and E-fields.\n", "  We report on the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of the non-thermal\nshell-type supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 (G353.6-0.7). For the first time\nthe complete remnant shell has been covered in X-rays, which allowed direct\ncomparison with radio and TeV observations. We carried out a spatially resolved\nspectral analysis of XMM-Newton data and confirmed the previously reported\nnon-thermal power-law X-ray spectrum of the source with negligible variations\nof spectral index across the shell. On the other hand, the X-ray absorption\ncolumn is strongly variable and correlates with the CO emission thus confirming\nthat the absorbing material must be in the foreground and reinforcing the\npreviously suggested lower limit on distance. Finally, we find that the X-ray\nemission of the remnant is suppressed towards the Galactic plane, which points\nto lower shock velocities in this region, likely due to the interaction of the\nshock with the nearby molecular cloud.\n", "  A configuration space version of BPHZ renormalization is proved in the realm\nof perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. All arguments are formulated\nentirely in configuration space so that the range of application is extended to\nanalytic spacetimes. Further the relation to the momentum space method is\nestablished. In the course of that, it is necessary to study the limit of\nconstant coupling.\n", "  Chemiluminescence is the emission of light as a result of a nonadiabatic\nchemical reaction. The present work is concerned with understanding the yield\nof chemiluminescence, in particular how it dramatically increases upon\nmethylation of 1,2-dioxetane. Both ground-state and nonadiabatic dynamics\n(including singlet excited states) of the decomposition reaction of various\nmethyl-substituted dioxetanes have been simulated. Methyl-substitution leads to\na significant increase in the dissociation time scale. The rotation around the\nO-C-C-O dihedral angle is slowed; thus, the molecular system stays longer in\nthe \"entropic trap\" region. A simple kinetic model is proposed to explain how\nthis leads to a higher chemiluminescence yield. These results have important\nimplications for the design of efficient chemiluminescent systems in medical,\nenvironmental, and industrial applications.\n", "  We investigate the interrelation between the distribution of stochastic\nfluctuations of independent random variables in probability theory and the\ndistribution of time averages in deterministic Anosov C-systems. On the one\nhand, in probability theory, our interest dwells on three basic topics: the\nlaws of large numbers, the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated\nlogarithm for sequences of real-valued random variables. On the other hand we\nhave chaotic, uniformly hyperbolic Anosov C-systems defined on tori which have\nmixing of all orders and nonzero Kolmogorov entropy. These extraordinary\nergodic properties of deterministic Anosov C-systems ensure that the above\nclassical limit theorems for sums of independent random variables in\nprobability theory are fulfilled by the time averages for the sequences\ngenerated by the C-systems. The MIXMAX generator of pseudorandom numbers\nrepresents the C-system for which the classical limit theorems are fulfilled.\n", "  An oxidation process is simulated for a bundle of metal tubes in a\ncross-flow. A fluid flow is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations. To describe the transport of oxygen, the corresponding\nconvection-diffusion equation is applied. The key point of the model is related\nto the description of oxidation processes taking into account the growth of a\nthin oxide film in the quasi-stationary approximation. Mathematical modeling of\noxidant transport in a tube bundle is carried out in the 2D approximation. The\nnumerical algorithm employed in the work is based on the finite-element\ndiscretization in space and the fully implicit discretization in time. The tube\nrows of a bundle can be either in-line or staggered in the direction of the\nfluid flow velocity. The growth of the oxide film on tube walls is predicted\nfor various bundle structures using the developed oxidation model.\n", "  Coherent Raman scattering microscopy is a fast, label-free and chemically\nspecific imaging technique that has a high potential for future in-vivo optical\nhistology. However, its imaging depth into tissues is limited to the\nsub-millimeter range by absorption and scattering. Performing coherent Raman\nimaging in a fiber endoscope system is a crucial step to image deep inside\nliving tissues and provide the information inaccessible with current microscopy\ntools. However the development of coherent Raman endoscopy has been hampered by\nseveral issues in the fiber delivery of the excitation pulses and signal\ncollection. Here, we present a flexible, compact, and multimodal nonlinear\nendoscope (4.2 mm outer diameter, 71 mm rigid length) based on a resonantly\nscanned hollow-core Kagom\\'e-lattice double-clad fiber. The fiber design allows\ndistortion-less, background-free delivery of femtosecond excitation pulses and\nthe back-collection of nonlinear signals through the same fiber. Sub-micron\nspatial resolution together with large field of view is made possible by the\ncombination of a miniature objective lens together with a silica microsphere\nlens inserted into the fiber core. We demonstrate coherent anti-Stokes Raman\nscattering, 2-photon fluorescence and second harmonic generation imaging with\n0.8 {\\mu}m resolution over a field of view up to 320 {\\mu}m and at a rate of\n0.8 frames/s. These results pave the way for intra-operative label-free imaging\napplied to real-time histopathology diagnosis and surgery guidance.\n", "  The GAPS programme is an Italian project aiming to search and characterize\nextra-solar planetary systems around stars with different characteristics\n(mass, metallicity, environment). GAPS was born in 2012, when single research\ngroups joined in order to propose a long-term multi-purpose observing program\nfor the exploitation of the extraordinary performances of the HARPS-N\nspectrograph, mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Now this group is a\nconcerted community in which wide range of expertise and capabilities are\nshared in order to reach a more important role in the wider international\ncontext. We present the results achieved up to now from the GAPS radial\nvelocity survey: they were obtained in both the two main objectives of the\nproject, the planet detection and the characterization of already known\nexoplanetary systems. With GAPS we detected, for instance, the first confirmed\nbinary system in which both components host planets (Desidera et al. 2014), the\nfirst planetary system around a star in an open cluster (Malavolta et al.\n2016), a system of Super-Earths orbiting an M-dwarf star (Affer et al. 2016).\n", "  As a promising computational paradigm, occurrence of critical states in\nartificial and biological neural networks has attracted wide-spread attention.\nAn often-made explicit or implicit assumption is that one single critical state\nis responsible for two separate notions of criticality (avalanche criticality\nand dynamical edge of chaos criticality). Previously, we provided an isolated\ncounter-example for co-occurrence. Here, we reveal a persistent paradigm of\nstructural transitions that such networks undergo, as the overall connectivity\nstrength is varied over its biologically meaningful range. Among these\ntransitions, only one avalanche critical point emerges, with edge of chaos\nfailing to co-occur. Our observations are based on ensembles of networks\nobtained from variations of network configuration and their neurons. This\nsuggests that not only non-coincidence of criticality, but also the persistent\nparadigm of network structural changes in function of the overall connectivity\nstrength, could be generic features of a large class of biological neural\nnetworks.\n", "  We generalize the notion of unextendible maximally entangled basis from\nbipartite systems to multipartite quantum systems. It is proved that there do\nnot exist unextendible maximally entangled bases in three-qubit systems.\nMoreover,two types of unextendible maximally entangled bases are constructed in\ntripartite quantum systems and proved to be not mutually unbiased.\n", "  A plausible mechanism of self-regulation in technological chains of the kind\nwherein input resources are converted into common final product through\nsequences of processing links having uniform kinetic properties is discussed. A\nbottleneck principle is derived according to which output of the overall chain\nis completely determined by its slowest link, if all the links are featured by\nsatiation and weak outflow.\n", "  The resonant eigenmodes of a nitrogen-implanted iron {\\alpha}'-FeN\ncharacterized by weak stripe domains are investigated by Brillouin light\nscattering and broadband ferromagnetic resonance experiments, assisted by\nmicromagnetic simulations. The spectrum of the dynamic eigenmodes in the\npresence of the weak stripes is very rich and two different families of modes\ncan be selectively detected using different techniques or different\nexperimental configurations. Attention is paid to the evolution of the mode\nfrequencies and spatial profiles under the application of an external magnetic\nfield, of variable intensity, in the direction parallel or transverse to the\nstripes. The different evolution of the modes with the external magnetic field\nis accompanied by a distinctive spatial localization in specific regions, such\nas the closure domains at the surface of the stripes and the bulk domains\nlocalized in the inner part of the stripes. The complementarity of BLS and FMR\ntechniques, based on different selection rules, is found to be a fruitful tool\nfor the study of the wealth of localized mag-netic excitations generally found\nin nanostructures.\n", "  Nearly 30 years ago, J.P. Crutchfield and K. Young proposed in Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 63}, 105 (1989) some supposedly novel measures of time series\ncomplexity, and their relations to existing concepts in nonlinear dynamical\nsystems. At that time it seemed that the multiple faults of this paper would\nmake it obsolete soon. Since this has not happened, and these faults still\ninfest the literature on what is now called \"computational mechanics\", I want\nhere to rectify the situation.\n", "  We present systematic construction of probability and probability current\ndensities operators for one-band single particle Pauli equations starting from\nthe operators in Dirac electron model within Second Quantized Approach. These\noperators are of importance as in probability interpretation of experimental\ndata, so in establishing of boundary conditions. It is shown that derived\noperators differ significally from their convential Schrodinger-type\ncounterparts. The generalization of continuity equation for probability density\nunder external perturbations and physical meaning of additional source terms is\ndiscussed. The presented approach can be useful in analysis of carriers\ndynamics described within generic multicomponent $\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{p}$\nHamiltonians in Envelope Function Approximation (EFA).\n", "  In this investigation we treat a special configuration of two celestial\nbodies in 1:1 mean motion resonance namely the so-called exchange orbits. There\nexist -- at least -- theoretically -- two different types: the exchange-a\norbits and the exchange-e orbits. The first one is the following: two celestial\nbodies are in orbit around a central body with almost the same semi-major axes\non circular orbits. Because of the relatively small differences in semi-major\naxes they meet from time to time and exchange their semi-major axes. The inner\none then moves outside the other planet and vice versa. The second\nconfiguration one is the following: two planets are moving on nearly the same\norbit with respect to the semi-major axes, one on a circular orbit and the\nother one on an eccentric one. During their dynamical evolution they change the\ncharacteristics of the orbit, the circular one becomes an elliptic one whereas\nthe elliptic one changes its shape to a circle. This 'game' repeats\nperiodically. In this new study we extend the numerical computations for both\nof these exchange orbits to the three dimensional case and in another extension\ntreat also the problem when these orbits are perturbed from a fourth body. Our\nresults in form of graphs show quite well that for a large variety of initial\nconditions both configurations are stable and stay in this exchange orbits.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally the resonant excitation of plasma waves by\ntrains of laser pulses. We also take an important first step to achieving an\nenergy recovery plasma accelerator by showing that unused wakefield energy can\nbe removed by an out-of-resonance trailing laser pulse. The measured laser\nwakefields are found to be in excellent agreement with analytical and numerical\nmodels of wakefield excitation in the linear regime. Our results indicate a\npromising direction for achieving highly controlled, GeV-scale laser-plasma\naccelerators operating at multi-kilohertz repetition rates.
