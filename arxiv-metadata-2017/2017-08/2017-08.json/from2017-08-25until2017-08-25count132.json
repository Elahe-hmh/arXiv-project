Before their work, the origin of the radiation today\ncalled \"cosmic rays\" was strongly debated, as many scientists thought that\nthese particles came from the crust of the Earth.\n  The approach by Hess is well known: Hess measured the rate of discharge of an\nelectroscope that flew aboard an atmospheric balloon. Because the discharge\nrate increased as the balloon flew at higher altitude, he concluded in 1912\nthat the origin could not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded\nthe Nobel Prize in 1936, and his experiment became legendary.\n  Shortly before, in 1911, Pacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made\na series of measurements to determine the variation in the speed of discharge\nof an electroscope (and thus the intensity of the radiation) while the\nelectroscope was immersed in a box in a sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay\nof Livorno (the Italian Navy supported the research). The measures are\ndocumented in his work \"Penetrating radiation at the surface of and in water\".\nPacini discovered that the discharge of the oscilloscope was significantly\nslower than at the surface.\n  Documents testify that Pacini and Hess knew of each other's work. Pacini died\nin 1934, two years before the Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of\ncosmic rays. While Hess is remembered as the discoverer of cosmic rays, the\nsimultaneous discovery by Pacini is forgotten by most.\n", "  The Euler-Lagrange equations (EL) are very important in the theoretical\ndescription of several physical systems. In this work we have used a simplified\nform of EL to study one-dimensional motions under the action of a constant\nforce. From using the definition of partial derivative, we have proposed two\noperators, here called \\textit{mean delta operators}, which may be used to\nsolve the EL in a simplest way. We have applied this simplification to solve\nthree simple mechanical problems under the action of the gravitational field: a\nfree fall body, the Atwood's machine and the inclined plan. The proposed\nsimplification can be used to introducing the lagrangian formalism to teach\nclassical mechanics in introductory physics courses.\n", "  The magnetic structure of the mixed antiferromagnet\nNdMn$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_3$ was resolved. Neutron powder diffraction data\ndefinitively resolve the Mn-sublattice with a magnetic propagation vector ${\\bf\nk} = (000)$ and with the magnetic structure (A$_x$, F$_y$, G$_z$) for 1.6~K~$<\nT < T_N (\\approx 59$~K). The Nd-sublattice has a (0, f$_y$, 0) contribution in\nthe same temperature interval. The Mn sublattice undergoes spin-reorientation\ntransition at $T_1 \\approx 13$~K while the Nd magnetic moment keep ordered\nabruptly increases at this temperature. Powder X-ray diffraction shows a strong\nmagnetoelastic effect at $T_N$ but no additional structural phase transitions\nfrom 2~K to 300~K. Density functional theory calculations confirm the magnetic\nstructure of the undoped NdMnO$_3$ as part of our analysis. Taken together,\nthese results show the magnetic structure of Mn-sublattice in\nNdMn$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_3$ is a combination of the Mn and Fe parent compounds,\nbut the magnetic ordering of Nd sublattice spans over broader temperature\ninterval than in case of NdMnO$_3$ and NdFeO$_3$. This result is a consequence\nof the fact that the Nd ions do not order independently, but via polarization\nfrom Mn/Fe sublattice.\n", "  We explain the force balance in flowing marine ice sheets and the ice shelves\nthey often feed. Treating ice as a viscous shear-thinning power law fluid, we\ndevelop an asymptotic (late-time) theory in two cases $-$ the presence or\nabsence of contact with sidewalls. The solution without sidewalls is a simple\ngeneralisation of that found by Robison (JFM, 648, 363), allowing us to obtain\nthe equilibrium grounding line thickness using a simple computer model and to\nget an analytic approximation. For laterally confined shelves, we obtain an\nasymptotic theory valid for long shelves and define when this is. Our theory is\nbased on the velocity profile across the channel being a generalised version of\nPoiseuille flow, which works when lateral shear dominates the force balance.\n  We conducted experiments using a laboratory model for ice. This was an\naqueous suspension of $0.5\\%$ mass concentration xanthan, yielding $n \\approx\n3.8$ (similar to ice). Our theories agreed extremely well with our experiments\nfor all relevant parameters (front position, thickness profile, lateral\nvelocity profile, longitudinal velocity gradient and grounding line thickness).\nThis strongly suggests that we have understood the dominant force balance in\nboth types of ice shelf.\n  In the real world, ice tongues are unlikely to rapidly disintegrate but can\nbe shortened until they no longer exist, at which point the sheet becomes\nunstable and ultimately the grounding line should retreat above sea level.\nPrior to that point, the flow of ice into it should not be speeded up and the\ngrounding line should also not retreat, assuming that only oceanic conditions\nchange. However, laterally confined ice shelves experience significant\nbuttressing. If removed, this leads to a rapid speedup of the sheet and a much\nsmaller equilibrium grounding line thickness. Something similar may have\noccurred to the Larsen B ice shelf.\n", "  The left-right operator splitting method is studied for the efficient\ncalculation of acoustic fields scattered by arbitrary rough surfaces. Here the\ngoverning boundary integral is written as a sum of left- and right-going\ncomponents, and the solution expressed as an iterative series, expanding about\nthe predominant direction of propagation. Calculation of each term is\ncomputationally inexpensive both in time and memory, and the field is often\naccurately captured using one or two terms. The convergence and accuracy are\nexamined by comparison with exact solution for smaller problems, and a series\nof much larger problems are tackled. The method is also immediately applicable\nto other scatterers such as waveguides, of which examples are given.\n", "  The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will produce spectroscopic surveys of tens\nto hundreds of millions of HI galaxies, eventually covering 30,000 sq. deg. and\nreaching out to redshift z~2. The huge volumes probed by the SKA will allow for\nsome of the best constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity, based on\nmeasurements of the large-scale power spectrum. We investigate various\nobservational set-ups for HI galaxy redshift surveys, compatible with the SKA\nPhase 1 and Phase 2 (full SKA) configurations. We use the corresponding number\ncounts and bias for each survey from realistic simulations and derive the\nmagnification bias and the evolution of source counts directly from these. For\nthe first time, we produce forecasts that fully include the general\nrelativistic effects on the galaxy number counts. These corrections to the\nstandard analysis become important on very large scales, where the signal of\nprimordial non-Gaussianity grows strongest. Our results show that, for the full\nsurvey, the non-Gaussianity parameter fNL can be constrained down to an\naccuracy of 1.54. This improves the current limit set by the Planck satellite\nby a factor of five, using a completely different approach.\n", "  Based on the classical Pl\\\"ucker correspondence, we present algebraic and\ngeometric properties of discrete integrable line complexes in $CP^3$.\nAlgebraically, these are encoded in a discrete integrable system which appears\nin various guises in the theory of continuous and discrete integrable systems.\nGeometrically, the existence of these integrable line complexes is shown to be\nguaranteed by Desargues' classical theorem of projective geometry. A remarkable\ncharacterisation in terms of correlations of $CP^3$ is also recorded.\n", "  We present a comprehensive review of the physical behavior of yield stress\nmaterials in soft condensed matter, which encompass a broad range of materials\nfrom colloidal assemblies and gels to emulsions and non-Brownian suspensions.\nAll these disordered materials display a nonlinear flow behavior in response to\nexternal mechanical forces, due to the existence of a finite force threshold\nfor flow to occur: the yield stress. We discuss both the physical origin and\nrheological consequences associated with this nonlinear behavior, and give an\noverview of experimental techniques available to measure the yield stress. We\ndiscuss recent progress concerning a microscopic theoretical description of the\nflow dynamics of yield stress materials, emphasizing in particular the role\nplayed by relaxation time scales, the interplay between shear flow and aging\nbehavior, the existence of inhomogeneous shear flows and shear bands, wall\nslip, and non-local effects in confined geometries.\n", "  This paper attempts to establish the connection among classifications of\ngapped boundaries in topological phases of matter, bosonic symmetry-protected\ntopological (SPT) phases and fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates in\nquantum error-correcting codes. We begin by presenting constructions of gapped\nboundaries for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycles\nfunctions ($d\\geq 2$). We point out that the system supports $m$-dimensional\nexcitations ($m<d$), which we shall call fluctuating charges, that are\nsuperpositions of point-like electric charges characterized by $m$-dimensional\nbosonic SPT wavefunctions. There exist gapped boundaries where electric charges\nor magnetic fluxes may not condense by themselves, but may condense only when\naccompanied by fluctuating charges. Magnetic fluxes and codimension-$2$\nfluctuating charges exhibit non-trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics,\ninvolving more than two excitations. The statistical angle can be computed by\ntaking slant products of underlying cocycle functions sequentially. We find\nthat excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary can be characterized\nby trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, generalizing the notion of the\nLagrangian subgroup. As an application, we construct fault-tolerantly\nimplementable logical gates for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by\nusing $d$-cocycle functions. Namely, corresponding logical gates belong to the\n$d$th level of the Clifford hierarchy, but are outside of the $(d-1)$th level,\nif cocycle functions have non-trivial sequences of slant products.\n", "  In the spirit of Klein's Erlangen Program, we investigate the geometric and\nalgebraic structure of fundamental line complexes and the underlying privileged\ndiscrete integrable system for the minors of a matrix which constitute\nassociated Pl\\\"ucker coordinates. Particular emphasis is put on the restriction\nto Lie circle geometry which is intimately related to the master dCKP equation\nof discrete integrable systems theory. The geometric interpretation,\nconstruction and integrability of fundamental line complexes in M\\\"obius,\nLaguerre and hyperbolic geometry are discussed in detail. In the process, we\nencounter various avatars of classical and novel incidence theorems and\nassociated cross- and multi-ratio identities for particular hypercomplex\nnumbers. This leads to a discrete integrable equation which, in the context of\nM\\\"obius geometry, governs novel doubly hexagonal circle patterns.\n", "  Photonic crystal materials are based on a periodic modulation of the\ndielectric constant on length scales comparable to the wavelength of light.\nThese materials can exhibit photonic band gaps; frequency regions for which the\npropagation of electromagnetic radiation is forbidden due to the depletion of\nthe density of states. In order to exhibit a full band gap, 3D PCs must present\na threshold refractive index contrast that depends on the crystal structure. In\nthe case of the so-called woodpile photonic crystals this threshold is\ncomparably low, approximately 1.9 for the direct structure. Therefore direct or\ninverted woodpiles made of high refractive index materials like silicon,\ngermanium or titanium dioxide are sought after. Here we show that, by combining\nmultiphoton lithography and atomic layer deposition, we can achieve a direct\ninversion of polymer templates into TiO$_{2}$ based photonic crystals. The\nobtained structures show remarkable optical properties in the near-infrared\nregion with almost perfect specular reflectance, a transmission dip close to\nthe detection limit and a Bragg length comparable to the lattice constant.\n", "  Color/kinematics duality and the double-copy construction have proved to be\nsystematic tools for gaining new insight into gravitational theories. Extending\nour earlier work, in this paper we introduce new double-copy constructions for\nlarge classes of spontaneously-broken Yang-Mills-Einstein theories with adjoint\nHiggs fields. One gauge-theory copy entering the construction is a\nspontaneously-broken (super-)Yang-Mills theory, while the other copy is a\nbosonic Yang-Mills-scalar theory with trilinear scalar interactions that\ndisplay an explicitly-broken global symmetry. We show that the kinematic\nnumerators of these gauge theories can be made to obey color/kinematics duality\nby exhibiting particular additional Lie-algebraic relations. We discuss in\ndetail explicit examples with N=2 supersymmetry, focusing on\nYang-Mills-Einstein supergravity theories belonging to the generic Jordan\nfamily in four and five dimensions, and identify the map between the\nsupergravity and double-copy fields and parameters. We also briefly discuss the\napplication of our results to N=4 supergravity theories. The constructions are\nillustrated by explicit examples of tree-level and one-loop scattering\namplitudes.\n", "  Confocal quadrics lie at the heart of the system of confocal coordinates\n(also called elliptic coordinates, after Jacobi). We suggest a discretization\nwhich respects two crucial properties of confocal coordinates: separability and\nall two-dimensional coordinate subnets being isothermic surfaces (that is,\nallowing a conformal parametrization along curvature lines, or, equivalently,\nsupporting orthogonal Koenigs nets). Our construction is based on an integrable\ndiscretization of the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation and leads to discrete nets\nwith the separability property, with all two-dimensional subnets being Koenigs\nnets, and with an additional novel discrete analog of the orthogonality\nproperty. The coordinate functions of our discrete nets are given explicitly in\nterms of gamma functions.\n", "  The photovoltaic characteristics of an ultra-thin GaAs solar cell with gold\nback reflector are simulated using the standard semi-classical\ndrift-diffusion-Poisson model and an advanced microscopic quantum-kinetic\napproach based on the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. For the\nstandard assumption of flat band bulk absorption coefficient used in the\nsemi-classical model, substantial qualitative and quantitative discrepancies\nare identified between the results of the two approaches. The agreement is\nimproved by consideration of field dependent absorption and emission\ncoefficients in the semi-classical model, revealing the strong impact of the\nlarge built-in potential gradients in ultra-thin device architectures based on\nhigh-quality crystalline materials. The full quantum-kinetic simulation results\nfor the device characteristics can be reproduced by using the NEGF generation\nand recombination rates in the semi-classical model, pointing at an essentially\nbulk-like transport mechanism.\n", "  Hierarchical polymer structures such as pNIPAM microgels have been\nextensively studied for their ability to undergo significant structural and\nphysical transformations that can be controlled by external stimuli such as\ntemperature, pH or solvent composition. However, direct three-dimensional\nvisualization of individual particles in situ have so far been hindered by\ninsufficient resolution, with optical microscopy, or contrast, with electron\nmicroscopy. In recent years superresolution microscopy techniques have emerged\nthat in principle can provide nanoscopic optical resolution. Here we report on\nthe in-situ superresolution microscopy of dye-labeled submicron sized pNIPAM\nmicrogels revealing the internal microstructure during swelling and collapse of\nindividual particles. Using direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy\n(dSTORM) we demonstrate a lateral optical resolution of 30nm and an axial\nresolution of 60nm.\n", "  The first known magnetic mineral, magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$), has unusual\nproperties which have fascinated mankind for centuries; it undergoes the Verwey\ntransition at $T_{\\rm V}$ $\\sim$120 K with an abrupt change in structure and\nelectrical conductivity. The mechanism of the Verwey transition however remains\ncontentious. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) over a wide\ntemperature range across the Verwey transition to identify and separate out the\nmagnetic excitations derived from nominal Fe$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ states.\nComparison of the RIXS results with crystal-field multiplet calculations shows\nthat the spin-orbital $dd$ excitons of the Fe$^{2+}$ sites arise from a\ntetragonal Jahn-Teller active polaronic distortion of the Fe$^{2+}$O$_6$\noctahedra. These low-energy excitations, which get weakened for temperatures\nabove 350 K but persist at least up to 550 K, are distinct from optical\nexcitations and best explained as magnetic polarons.\n", "  Here we present a multiscale method to calculate the saddle point associated\nwith the effective dynamics arising from a stochastic system which couples slow\ndeterministic drift and fast stochastic dynamics. This problem is motivated by\nthe transition states on free energy surfaces in chemical physics. Our method\nis based on the gentlest ascent dynamics which couples the position variable\nand the direction variable and has the local convergence to saddle points. The\ndynamics of the direction vector is derived in terms of the covariance function\nwith respective to the equilibrium distribution of the fast stochastic process.\nWe apply the multiscale numerical methods to efficiently solve the obtained\nmultiscale gentlest ascent dynamics, {and discuss the acceleration techniques\nbased on the adaptive idea.} The examples of stochastic ordinary and partial\ndifferential equations are presented.\n", "  In this paper, we tackle a challenging problem inherent in a series of\napplications: tracking the influential nodes in dynamic networks. Specifically,\nwe model a dynamic network as a stream of edge weight updates. This general\nmodel embraces many practical scenarios as special cases, such as edge and node\ninsertions, deletions as well as evolving weighted graphs. Under the popularly\nadopted linear threshold model and independent cascade model, we consider two\nessential versions of the problem: finding the nodes whose influences passing a\nuser specified threshold and finding the top-$k$ most influential nodes. Our\nkey idea is to use the polling-based methods and maintain a sample of random RR\nsets so that we can approximate the influence of nodes with provable quality\nguarantees. We develop an efficient algorithm that incrementally updates the\nsample random RR sets against network changes. We also design methods to\ndetermine the proper sample sizes for the two versions of the problem so that\nwe can provide strong quality guarantees and, at the same time, be efficient in\nboth space and time. In addition to the thorough theoretical results, our\nexperimental results on $5$ real network data sets clearly demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.\n", "  I describe an approach which connects classical gravity with the quantum\nmicrostructure of spacetime. The field equations arise from maximizing the\ndensity of states of matter plus geometry. The former is identified using the\nthermodynamics of null surfaces while the latter arises due to the existence of\na zero-point length in the spacetime. The resulting field equations remain\ninvariant when a constant is added to the matter Lagrangian, which is a\nsymmetry of the matter sector. Therefore, the cosmological constant arises as\nan integration constant. A non-zero value $(\\Lambda)$ of the cosmological\nconstant renders the amount of cosmic information $(I_c)$ accessible to an\neternal observer finite and hence is directly related to it. This relation\nallows us to determine the numerical value of $(\\Lambda)$ from the quantum\nstructure of spacetime.\n", "  The secular thickening of a discrete self-gravitating galactic disc is\ninvestigated using the inhomogeneous multi-component Balescu-Lenard equation.\nThe thick WKB limit for the diffusion and drift coefficients is found using the\nepicyclic approximation, while assuming that only radially tightly wound\ntransient spirals are sustained by the disc. This yields a simple double\nquadrature for the drift and diffusion coefficients, providing a clear\nunderstanding of the positions of maximum vertical orbital diffusion within the\ndisc induced by the effects of a finite number of particles. When applied to a\ntepid stable tapered disc, the Balescu-Lenard formalism predicts the formation\nof ridges of resonant orbits towards larger vertical actions, as found in\ndirect numerical simulations, but over-estimates the timescale involved in\ntheir appearance. Swing amplication is likely needed to resolve this\ndiscrepancy, as demonstrated in the case of razor-thin discs. The joint\nevolution of a population of giant molecular clouds within the disc may\naccelerate the secular disc's thickening induced by finite${-N}$ effects, but\nthe observed number of clouds in the Milky Way does not seem to be sufficient\nto explain its thick disc.\n", "  We have measured the total kinetic energy (TKE) release for the\n$^{235}$U(n,f) reaction for $E_{n}$=2-100 MeV using the 2E method with an array\nof Si PIN diode detectors. The neutron energies were determined by time of\nflight measurements using the white spectrum neutron beam at the LANSCE\nfacility. To benchmark the TKE measurement, the TKE release for\n$^{235}$U(n$_{th}$,f) was also measured using a thermal neutron beam from the\nOregon State University TRIGA reactor, giving pre-neutron emission\n$E^*_{TKE}=170.7\\pm0.4$ MeV in good agreement with known values. Our\nmeasurements are thus absolute measurements. The TKE in $^{235}$U(n,f)\ndecreases non-linearly from 169 MeV to 161 MeV for $E_{n}$=2-100 MeV. The\nmulti-modal fission analysis of mass distributions and TKE indicates the origin\nof the TKE decrease with increasing neutron energy is a consequence of the fade\nout of asymmetric fission, which is associated with a higher TKE compared to\nsymmetric fission. The average TKE associated with the superlong, standard I\nand standard II modes for a given mass is independent of neutron energy. The\nwidths of the TKE distributions are constant from $E_{n}$=20-100 MeV and hence\nshow no dependence with excitation energy.\n", "  We discuss the effects of built-in fields and contact configuration on the\nphotovoltaic characteristics of ultrathin GaAs solar cells. The investigation\nis based on advanced quantum-kinetic simulations reaching beyond the standard\nsemi-classical bulk picture concerning the consideration of charge carrier\nstates and dynamics in complex potential profiles. The thickness dependence of\ndark and photocurrent in the ultra-scaled regime is related to the\ncorresponding variation of both, the built-in electric fields and associated\nmodification of the density of states, and the optical intensity in the films.\nLosses in open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current due to leakage of\nelectronically and optically injected carriers at minority carrier contacts are\ninvestigated for different contact configurations including electron and hole\nblocking barrier layers. The microscopic picture of leakage currents is\nconnected to the effect of finite surface recombination velocities in the\nsemi-classical description, and the impact of these non-classical contact\nregions on carrier generation and extraction is analyzed.\n", "  We show that the mutual information between two symbols, as a function of the\nnumber of symbols between the two, decays exponentially in any probabilistic\nregular grammar, but can decay like a power law for a context-free grammar.\nThis result about formal languages is closely related to a well-known result in\nclassical statistical mechanics that there are no phase transitions in\ndimensions fewer than two. It is also related to the emergence of power-law\ncorrelations in turbulence and cosmological inflation through recursive\ngenerative processes. We elucidate these physics connections and comment on\npotential applications of our results to machine learning tasks like training\nartificial recurrent neural networks. Along the way, we introduce a useful\nquantity which we dub the rational mutual information and discuss\ngeneralizations of our claims involving more complicated Bayesian networks.\n", "  We investigate angular momentum acquisition in Milky Way-sized galaxies by\ncomparing five high resolution zoom-in simulations, each implementing identical\ncosmological initial conditions, but utilizing different hydrodynamic codes:\nEnzo, Art, Ramses, Arepo, and Gizmo-PSPH. Each code implements a distinct set\nof feedback and star formation prescriptions. We find that while many galaxy\nand halo properties vary between the different codes (and feedback\nprescriptions), there is qualitative agreement on the process of angular\nmomentum acquisition in the galaxy's halo. In all simulations, cold filamentary\ngas accretion to the halo results in ~4 times more specific angular momentum in\ncold halo gas ($\\lambda_{cold} \\gtrsim 0.1$) than in the dark matter halo. At\nz>1, this inflow takes the form of inspiraling cold streams that are\nco-directional in the halo of the galaxy and are fueled, aligned, and\nkinematically connected to filamentary gas infall along the cosmic web. Due to\nthe qualitative agreement among disparate simulations, we conclude that the\nbuildup of high angular momentum halo gas and the presence of these inspiraling\ncold streams are robust predictions of Lambda Cold Dark Matter galaxy\nformation, though the detailed morphology of these streams is significantly\nless certain. A growing body of observational evidence suggests that this\nprocess is borne out in the real universe.\n", "  A two-dimensional electron system in the presence of a magnetic field and\nmicrowave irradiation can undergo a phase transition towards a zero-resistance\nstate. A widely used model predicts the zero-resistance state to be a domain\nstate, which responds to applied dc voltages or dc currents by slightly\nchanging the domain structure. Here we propose an alternative response\nscenario, according to which the domain pattern remains unchanged.\nSurprisingly, a fixed domain pattern does not destroy zero resistance, provided\nthat the resistance is direction independent. Otherwise, if the symmetry of the\ndomain pattern allows a direction dependence of the resistance, the domain\nstate can be dissipative. We give examples for both situations and simulate the\nresponse behavior numerically.\n", "  Hyperuniform disordered networks belong to a peculiar class of structured\nmaterials predicted to possess partial and complete photonic bandgaps for\nrelatively moderate refractive index contrasts. The practical realization of\nsuch photonic designer materials is challenging however, as it requires control\nover a multi-step fabcrication process on optical length scales. Here we report\nthe direct-laser writing of hyperuniform polymeric templates followed by a\nsilicon double inversion procedure leading to high quality network structures\nmade of polycrystalline silicon. We observe a pronounced gap in the shortwave\ninfrared centered at a wavelength of $\\lambda_{\\text{Gap}}\\simeq $ 2.5 $\\mu$m,\nin nearly quantitative agreement with numerical simulations. In the experiments\nthe typical structural length scale of the seed pattern can be varied between 2\n$\\mu$m and 1.54 $\\mu$m leading to a blue-shift of the gap accompanied by an\nincrease of the silicon volume filling fraction.\n", "  PyTransport constitutes a straightforward code written in C++ together with\nPython scripts which automatically edit, compile and run the C++ code as a\nPython module. It has been written for Unix-like systems (OS X and Linux).\nPrimarily the module employs the transport approach to inflationary cosmology\nto calculate the tree-level power-spectrum and bispectrum of user specified\nmodels of multi-field inflation, accounting for all sub and super-horizon\neffects. The transport method we utilise means only coupled differential\nequations need to be solved, and the implementation presented here combines the\nspeed of C++ with the functionality and convenience of Python. This document\ndetails the code and illustrates how to use it with a worked example. It has\nbeen updated to be a companion to the second version of the code, PyTransport\n2.0, which includes functionality to deal with models of inflation with a\ncurved field space metric.\n", "  We study a nonlinear wave for a system of balance laws in one space\ndimension, which describes combustion for two-phase (gas and liquid) flow in\nporous medium. The problem is formulated for a general $N$-component liquid for\nmodeling the strong multicomponent effects reported recently for an application\nto light oil recovery by air injection. Despite the immense complexity of the\nmodel, the problem allows analytic solution. The clue to this solution is a\nspecial form of a folding singularity, which occurs at an internal point of the\nwave profile. Analysis of this singularity provides a missing determining\nrelation for wave parameters. This result is not only interesting for the\napplication under consideration, but also motivates a deeper mathematical study\nof such singularities for general systems of balance laws.\n", "  The unification of quantum mechanics and gravity remains as one of the\nprimary challenges of present-day physics. Quantum-gravity-inspired\nphenomenological models offer a window to explore potential aspects of quantum\ngravity including qualitatively new behaviour that can be experimentally\ntested. One such phenomenological model is the generalized uncertainty\nprinciple (GUP), which predicts a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation and\na deformed canonical commutator. It was recently shown that optomechanical\nsystems offer significant promise to put stringent experimental bounds on such\nmodels. In this paper, we introduce a scheme to increase the sensitivity of\nthese experiments with an extended sequence of pulsed optomechanical\ninteractions. We also analyze the effects of optical phase noise and optical\nloss and present a strategy to mitigate such deleterious effects.\n", "  In order to optimize the optoelectronic properties of novel solar cell\narchitectures, such as the amorphous-crystalline interface in silicon\nheterojunction devices, we calculate and analyze the local microscopic\nstructure at this interface and in bulk a-Si:H, in particular with respect to\nthe impact of material inhomogeneities. The microscopic information is used to\nextract macroscopic material properties, and to identify localized defect\nstates, which govern the recombination properties encoded in quantities such as\ncapture cross sections used in the Shockley-Read-Hall theory. To this end,\natomic configurations for a-Si:H and a-Si:H/c-Si interfaces are generated using\nmolecular dynamics. Density functional theory calculations are then applied to\nthese configurations in order to obtain the electronic wave functions. These\nare analyzed and characterized with respect to their localization and their\ncontribution to the (local) density of states. GW calculations are performed\nfor the a-Si:H configuration in order to obtain a quasi-particle corrected\nabsorption spectrum. The results suggest that the quasi-particle corrections\ncan be approximated through a scissors shift of the Kohn-Sham energies.\n", "  Radiation reaction has been investigated traditionally in classical dynamics\nand recently in non-linear QED for high-intensity field physics by\nhigh-intensity lasers. The non-linearity of QED is predicted as the coupling\nbetween a highly energetic electron and its radiation. However, the applicable\nrange of external fields in the previous method of the Furry picture is just\nthe case of a plane wave. In this Volume II, we aim the generalization of this\napplicable range by using the stochastic scalar electron model introduced in\nVolume I. We discuss the formulation of radiation reaction acting on a\nstochastic scalar electron and show the origin of this non-linearity correction\nin general conditions.\n", "  Tracking a real trajectory of a quantum particle still has been treated as\nthe interpretation problem. It shall be expressed by a Brownian (stochastic)\nmotion suggested by E. Nelson, however, the well-defined mechanism of field\ngeneration from a stochastic particle hasn't been proposed yet. For the\nimprovement of this, I propose the extension of Nelson's quantum dynamics, for\ndescribing a relativistic scalar electron with its radiation equivalent to the\nKlein-Gordon particle and field system.\n", "  We study the symmetry properties in the dynamics of quantum correlations for\ntwo-qubit systems in one-sided noisy channels, with respect to a switch in the\nlocation of noise from one qubit to the other. We consider four different\nchannel types, namely depolarizing, amplitude damping, bit-flip, and\nbit-phase-flip channel, and identify the classes of initial states leading to\nsymmetric decay of entanglement, non-locality and discord. Our results show\nthat the symmetric decay of quantum correlations is not directly linked to the\npresence or absence of symmetry in the initial state, while it does depend on\nthe type of correlation considered as well as on the type noise. We prove that\nasymmetric decay can be used to infer, in certain cases, characteristic\nproperties of the channel. We also show that the location of noise may lead to\ndramatic changes in the persistence of phenomena such as entanglement sudden\ndeath and time-invariant discord.\n", "  This paper explores a large collection of about 377,000 observations,\nspanning more than 20 years with a frequency of 30 minutes, of the streamflow\nof the Paglia river, in central Italy. We analyze the long-term persistence\nproperties of the series by computing the Hurst exponent, not only in its\noriginal form but also under an evolutionary point of view by analyzing the\nHurst exponents over a rolling windows basis. The methodological tool adopted\nfor the persistence is the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is\nclassically known as suitable for our purpose. As an ancillary exploration, we\nimplement a control on the data validity by assessing if the data exhibit the\nregularity stated by Benford's law. Results are interesting under different\nviewpoints. First, we show that the Paglia river streamflow exhibits\nperiodicities which broadly suggest the existence of some common behaviour with\nEl Nino and the North Atlantic Oscillations: this specifically points to a (not\nnecessarily direct) effect of these oceanic phenomena on the hydrogeological\nequilibria of very far geographical zones: however, such an hypothesis needs\nfurther analyses to be validated. Second, the series of streamflows shows an\nantipersistent behaviour. Third, data are not consistent with Benford's law:\nthis suggests that the measurement criteria should be opportunely revised.\nFourth, the streamflow distribution is well approximated by a discrete\ngeneralized Beta distribution: this is well in accordance with the measured\nstreamflows being the outcome of a complex system.\n", "  Using the formalism of geometrothermodynamics to derive a fundamental\nthermodynamic equation, we construct a cosmological model in the framework of\nrelativistic cosmology. In a first step, we describe a system without\nthermodynamic interaction, and show it to be equivalent to the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The second step includes thermodynamic interaction and\nproduces a model consistent with the main features of inflation. With the\nproposed fundamental equation we are thus able to describe all the known epochs\nin the evolution of our Universe, starting from the inflationary phase.\n", "  In the framework of $k_T$-factorization approach, the production and\npolarization of prompt $J/\\psi$ mesons at the LHC energies is studied. Our\nconsideration is based on the non-relativistic QCD formalism for bound states\nand off-shell amplitudes for hard partonic subprocesses. Both the direct\nproduction mechanism and feed-down contributions from $\\chi_c$ and $\\psi(2S)$\ndecays are taken into account. The transverse momentum dependent (or\nunintegrated) gluon densities in a proton were derived from\nCiafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini evolution equation or, alternatively, were\nchosen in accordance with Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. The\nnon-perturbative color-octet matrix elements were first deduced from the fits\nto the latest CMS data on $J/\\psi$ transverse momentum distributions and then\napplied to describe the ATLAS and LHCb data on $J/\\psi$ production and\npolarization at $\\sqrt s = 7$, $8$ and $13$ TeV. We perform an estimation of\npolarization parameters $\\lambda_\\theta$, $\\lambda_\\phi$ and $\\lambda_{\\theta\n\\phi}$ which determine $J/\\psi$ spin density matrix and demonstrate that\ntreating the soft gluon emission as a series of explicit color-electric dipole\ntransitions within NRQCD leads to unpolarized $J/\\psi$ production at high\ntransverse momenta, that is in qualitative agreement with the LHC data.\n", "  In this chapter, we review the role of gas accretion to the acquisition of\nangular momentum, both in galaxies and in their gaseous halos. We begin by\ndiscussing angular momentum in dark matter halos, with a brief review of tidal\ntorque theory and the importance of mergers, followed by a discussion of the\ncanonical picture of galaxy formation within this framework, where halo gas is\npresumed to shock-heat to the virial temperature of the halo, following the\nsame spin distribution as the dark matter halo before cooling to the center of\nthe halo to form a galaxy there. In the context of recent observational\nevidence demonstrating the presence of high angular momentum gas in galaxy\nhalos, we review recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that have begun\nto emphasize the role of \"cold flow\" accretion---anisotropic gas accretion\nalong cosmic filaments that does not shock-heat before sinking to the central\ngalaxy. We discuss the implications of these simulations, reviewing a number of\nrecent developments in the literature, and suggest a revision to the canonical\nmodel as it relates to the expected angular momentum content of gaseous halos\naround galaxies.\n", "  In our previous investigations, we have developed the renormalization group\nmethod to $p$-adic models on Cayley trees, this method is closely related to\nthe investigation of $p$-adic dynamical systems associated with a given model.\nIn this paper, we study chaotic behavior of the Potts-Bethe mapping. We point\nout that a similar kind of result is not known in the case of real numbers\n(with rigorous proofs).\n", "  We propose a unitary procedure to reconstruct quantum secret for a quantum\nsecret sharing scheme constructed from stabilizer quantum error-correcting\ncodes. Erasure correcting procedures for stabilizer codes need to add missing\nshares for reconstruction of quantum secret while unitary reconstruction\nprocedures for certain class of quantum secret sharing are known to work\nwithout adding missing shares. The proposed procedure also works without adding\nmissing shares.\n", "  In Phase 2 of CRESST-II 18 detector modules were operated for about two years\n(July 2013 - August 2015). Together with this document we are publishing data\nfrom two detector modules which have been used for direct dark-matter searches.\nWith these data-sets we were able to set world-leading limits on the cross\nsection for spin-independent elastic scattering of dark matter particles off\nnuclei. We publish the energies of all events within the acceptance regions for\ndark-matter searches. In addition, we also publish the energies of the events\nwithin the electron-recoil band. This data set can be used to study\ninteractions with electrons of CaWO$_4$. In this document we describe how to\nuse these data sets. In particular, we explain the cut-survival probabilities\nrequired for comparisons of models with the data sets.\n", "  The suppressed decay $\\Lambda^{0}_{b}\\rightarrow p\\pi^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$,\nexcluding the $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)\\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ resonances, is\nobserved for the first time with a significance of 5.5 standard deviations. The\nanalysis is performed with proton-proton collision data corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of $3\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb\nexperiment. The $\\Lambda^{0}_{b}\\rightarrow p\\pi^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ branching\nfraction is measured relative to the $\\Lambda^{0}_{b}\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi(\\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-})p\\pi^{-}$ branching fraction giving\n\\begin{align} \\nonumber\n  \\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda^{0}_{b}\\rightarrow\np\\pi^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-})}{\\mathcal{B}({\\Lambda^{0}_{b}\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi(\\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-})p\\pi^{-}})} &= 0.044\\pm0.012\\pm0.007,\n\\end{align} where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is\nsystematic. This is the first observation of a $b\\rightarrow d$ transition in a\nbaryonic decay.\n", "  Community detection in graphs is the problem of finding groups of vertices\nwhich are more densely connected than they are to the rest of the graph. This\nproblem has a long history, but it is undergoing a resurgence of interest due\nto the need to analyze social and biological networks. While there are many\nways to formalize it, one of the most popular is as an inference problem, where\nthere is a \"ground truth\" community structure built into the graph somehow. The\ntask is then to recover the ground truth knowing only the graph.\n  Recently it was discovered, first heuristically in physics and then\nrigorously in probability and computer science, that this problem has a phase\ntransition at which it suddenly becomes impossible. Namely, if the graph is too\nsparse, or the probabilistic process that generates it is too noisy, then no\nalgorithm can find a partition that is correlated with the planted one---or\neven tell if there are communities, i.e., distinguish the graph from a purely\nrandom one with high probability. Above this information-theoretic threshold,\nthere is a second threshold beyond which polynomial-time algorithms are known\nto succeed; in between, there is a regime in which community detection is\npossible, but conjectured to require exponential time.\n  For computer scientists, this field offers a wealth of new ideas and open\nquestions, with connections to probability and combinatorics, message-passing\nalgorithms, and random matrix theory. Perhaps more importantly, it provides a\nwindow into the cultures of statistical physics and statistical inference, and\nhow those cultures think about distributions of instances, landscapes of\nsolutions, and hardness.\n", "  Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is a well-known process in quantum\nnonlinear optics in which a photon incident on a nonlinear crystal\nspontaneously splits into two photons. Here we propose an analogous physical\nprocess where one excited atom directly transfers its excitation to a pair of\nspatially-separated atoms with probability approaching one. The interaction is\nmediated by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons. This nonlinear\natomic process is coherent and reversible, so the pair of excited atoms can\ntransfer the excitation back to the first one: the atomic analogue of\nsum-frequency generation of light. The parameters used to investigate this\nprocess correspond to experimentally-demonstrated values in ultrastrong circuit\nquantum electrodynamics. This approach can be extended to realize other\nnonlinear inter-atomic processes, such as four-atom mixing, and is an\nattractive architecture for the realization of quantum devices on a chip. We\nshow that four-qubit mixing can efficiently implement quantum repetition codes\nand, thus, can be used for error-correction codes.\n", "  We establish the existence of bulk odd-frequency superconductivity in\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$ and show that an intrinsic Kerr effect is a direct evidence of\nthis state. We use both general two- and three-orbital models, as well as a\nrealistic tight-binding description of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to demonstrate that\nodd-frequency pairing arises due to finite hybridization between different\norbitals in the normal state, and is further enhanced by finite inter-orbital\npairing.\n", "  The peculiar emission properties of the $z \\sim 6.6$ Ly$\\alpha$ emitter CR7\nhave been initially interpreted with the presence of either a direct collapse\nblack hole (DCBH) or a substantial mass of Pop III stars. Instead, updated\nphotometric observations by Bowler et al. (2016) seem to suggest that CR7 is a\nmore standard system. Here we confirm that the original DCBH hypothesis is\nconsistent also with the new data. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we\nreproduce the new IR photometry with two models involving a Compton-thick DCBH\nof mass $\\approx 7 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ accreting (a) metal-free\n($Z=0$) gas with column density $N_H = 8 \\times 10^{25} \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$,\nor (b) low-metallicity gas ($Z = 5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{Z_{\\odot}}$) with\n$N_H = 3 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The best fit model reproduces the\nphotometric data to within $1 \\sigma$. Such metals can be produced by weak\nstar-forming activity occurring after the formation of the DCBH. The main\ncontribution to the Spitzer/IRAC $3.6 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ photometric band in\nboth models is due to HeI/HeII $\\lambda 4714, 4687$ emission lines, while the\ncontribution of [OIII] $\\lambda 4959, 5007$ emission lines, if present, is\nsub-dominant. Spectroscopic observations with JWST will be required to\nultimately clarify the nature of CR7.\n", "  To probe the $Wtb$ vertex structure, top-quark and $W$-boson polarisation\nobservables are measured from $t$-channel single-top-quark events produced in\nproton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The dataset\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb$^{-1}$, recorded with the\nATLAS detector at the LHC. Selected events contain one isolated electron or\nmuon, large missing transverse momentum and exactly two jets, with one of them\nidentified as likely to contain a $b$-hadron. Stringent selection requirements\nare applied to discriminate $t$-channel single-top-quark events from\nbackground. The polarisation observables are extracted from asymmetries in\nangular distributions measured with respect to spin quantisation axes\nappropriately chosen for the top quark and the $W$ boson. The asymmetry\nmeasurements are performed at parton level by correcting the observed angular\ndistributions for detector effects and hadronisation after subtracting the\nbackground contributions. The measured top-quark and $W$-boson polarisation\nvalues are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. Limits on the\nimaginary part of the anomalous coupling $g_{\\mathrm{R}}$ are also set from\nmodel-independent measurements.\n", "  Effective field theories such as Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) and Non\nRelativistic Quantum Chromo-(Electro-) dynamics NRQCD (NRQED) are indispensable\ntools in controlling the effects of the strong interaction. The increasing\nexperimental precision requires the knowledge of higher dimensional operators.\nWe present a general method that allows for an easy construction of HQET or\nNRQCD (NRQED) operators that contain two heavy quark or non-relativistic fields\nand any number of covariant derivatives. As an application of our method, we\nlist these terms in the $1/M^4$ NRQCD Lagrangian, where $M$ is the mass of of\nthe spin-half field.\n", "  Using the double-copy construction of Yang-Mills-Einstein theories formulated\nin our earlier work, we obtain compact presentations for single-trace\nYang-Mills-Einstein tree amplitudes with up to five external gravitons and an\narbitrary number of gluons. These are written as linear combinations of\ncolor-ordered Yang-Mills trees, where the coefficients are given by\ncolor/kinematics-satisfying numerators in a Yang-Mills+\\phi^3 theory. The\nconstruction outlined in this paper holds in general dimension and extends\nstraightforwardly to supergravity theories. For one, two, and three external\ngravitons, our expressions give identical or simpler presentations of\namplitudes already constructed through string-theory considerations or the\nscattering equations formalism. Our results are based on color/kinematics\nduality and gauge invariance, and strongly hint at a recursive structure\nunderlying the single-trace amplitudes with an arbitrary number of gravitons.\nFor the single-graviton case, we give amplitudes to any loop order and obtain,\nthrough gauge invariance, new loop-level amplitude relations for Yang-Mills\ntheory.\n", "  We present a novel derivation of the boundary term for the action in\nLanczos-Lovelock gravity, starting from the boundary contribution in the\nvariation of the Lanczos-Lovelock action. The derivation presented here is\nstraightforward, i.e., one starts from the Lanczos-Lovelock action principle\nand the action itself dictates the boundary structure and hence the boundary\nterm one needs to add to the action to make it well-posed. It also gives the\nfull structure of the contribution at the boundary of the complete action,\nenabling us to read off the degrees of freedom to be fixed at the boundary,\ntheir corresponding conjugate momenta and the total derivative contribution on\nthe boundary. We also provide a separate derivation of the Gauss-Bonnet case.\n", "  In strained heteroepitaxy, two-dimensional (2D) layers can exhibit a critical\nthickness at which three-dimensional (3D) islands self-assemble, relieving\nmisfit strain at the cost of an increased surface area. Here we show that such\na morphological phase transition can be induced on-demand using surfactants. We\nexplore Bi as a surfactant in the growth of InAs on GaAs(110), and find that\nthe presence of surface Bi induces Stranski-Krastanov growth of 3D islands,\nwhile growth without Bi always favors 2D layer formation. Exposing a static two\nmonolayer thick InAs layer to Bi rapidly transforms the layer into 3D islands.\nDensity functional theory calculations reveal that Bi reduces the energetic\ncost of 3D island formation by modifying surface energies. These 3D\nnanostructures behave as optically active quantum dots. This work illustrates\nhow surfactants can enable quantum dot self-assembly where it otherwise would\nnot occur.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of hydrodynamic overshooting convection in\nlocal Cartesian domains. We find that a substantial fraction of the lower part\nof the convection zone (CZ) is stably stratified according to the Schwarzschild\ncriterion while the enthalpy flux is outward directed. This occurs when the\nheat conduction profile at the bottom of the CZ is smoothly varying, based\neither on a Kramers-like opacity prescription as a function of temperature and\ndensity or a static profile of a similar shape. We show that the subadiabatic\nlayer arises due to nonlocal energy transport by buoyantly driven downflows in\nthe upper parts of the CZ. Analysis of the force balance of the upflows and\ndownflows confirms that convection is driven by cooling at the surface. We find\nthat the commonly used prescription for the convective enthalpy flux being\nproportional to the negative entropy gradient does not hold in the stably\nstratified layers where the flux is positive. We demonstrate the existence of a\nnon-gradient contribution to the enthalpy flux, which is estimated to be\nimportant throughout the convective layer. A quantitative analysis of downflows\nindicates a transition from a tree-like structure where smaller downdrafts\nmerge into larger ones in the upper parts to a structure in the deeper parts\nwhere a height-independent number of strong downdrafts persist. This change of\nflow topology occurs when a substantial subadiabatic layer is present in the\nlower part of the CZ.\n", "  Examples of \"enhanced ultraviolet cancellations\" with no known\nstandard-symmetry explanation have been found in a variety of supergravity\ntheories. By examining one- and two-loop examples in four- and five-dimensional\nhalf-maximal supergravity, we argue that enhanced cancellations in general\ncannot be exhibited prior to integration. In light of this, we explore\nreorganizations of integrands into parts that are manifestly finite and parts\nthat have poor power counting but integrate to zero due to integral identities.\nAt two loops we find that in the large loop-momentum limit the required\nintegral identities follow from Lorentz and SL(2) relabeling symmetry. We carry\nout a nontrivial check at four loops showing that the identities generated in\nthis way are a complete set. We propose that at $L$ loops the combination of\nLorentz and SL($L$) symmetry is sufficient for displaying enhanced\ncancellations when they happen, whenever the theory is known to be ultraviolet\nfinite up to $(L-1)$ loops.\n", "  In this report, a successful thermodynamical model was employed to understand\nthe structural transition in Er$_5$Si$_4$, able to explain the decoupling of\nthe magnetic and structural transition. This was achieved by the DFT\ncalculations which were used to determine the energy differences at 0 K, using\na LSDA+U approximation. It was found that the M structure as the stable phase\nat low temperatures as verified experimentally with a $\\Delta F_0 = -$0.262 eV.\nFinally, it was achieved a variation of Seebeck coefficient ($\\sim$ 6 $\\mu$V)\nat the structural transition which allow to conclude that the electronic\nentropy variation is negligible in the transition.\n", "  In this work we analyze a non-commutativity measure of quantum correlations\nrecently proposed by Y. Guo [Sci. Rep. 6, 25241 (2016)]. By recourse to a\nsystematic survey of a two-qubit system, we detected an undesirable behavior of\nsuch a measure related to its representation-dependence. In the case of pure\nstates, this dependence manifests as a non-satisfactory entanglement measure\nwhenever a representation other than the Schmidt's is used. In order to avoid\nthis dependence on the basis, we argue that a minimization procedure over the\nset of all possible representations of the quantum state is required. In the\ncase of pure states, this minimization can be analytically performed and the\noptimal basis turns out to be that of Schmidt's. In addition, the resulting\nmeasure inherits the main properties of Guo's measure and, unlike the latter,\nit reduces to a legitimate entanglement measure in the case of pure states.\nSome examples involving general mixed states are also analyzed considering such\na optimization. The results show that, in most cases of interest, the use of\nGuo's measure can result in a overestimation of quantum correlations. However,\nsince Guo's measure has the advantage of being easily computable, it might be\nused as a qualitative estimator of the presence of quantum correlations.\n", "  We study generation of non-local correlations by atomic interactions in a\npair of bi-modal Bose-Einstein Condensates in state-dependent potentials\nincluding spatial dynamics. The wave-functions of the four components are\ndescribed by combining a Fock state expansion with a time-dependent\nHartree-Fock Ansatz, so that both the spatial dynamics and the local and\nnon-local quantum correlations are accounted for. We find that despite the\nspatial dynamics, our protocole generates enough non-local entanglement to\nperform an EPR steering experiment with two spatially separated con-densates of\na few thousands of atoms.\n", "  We consider a dark matter (DM) model that arises from the interplay of two\nsimplified dark matter models, namely the doublet-triplet fermion model and the\ndoublet-triplet scalar model. Despite being excellent exponents of the WIMP\nparadigm, the physics related to DM in each of these models fails at the same\ntime to account for neutrino masses. It turns out that from the combination of\nthese two models it is possible to generate neutrino masses at one-loop level\nin the four topologies that are realizations of the Weinberg operator for\nneutrino masses at one-loop. In this work, we combine both models focusing\nmostly on fermionic dark matter lying at the electroweak scale. We analyze the\nimpact of the extra charged fields on the Higgs diphoton decay and find that,\nthanks to the presence of the charged scalars, it is possible to have a viable\nDM region at the electroweak scale.\n", "  We study the slow stochastic dynamics near the depinning threshold of an\nelastic interface in a random medium by solving a particularly suited model of\nhopping interacting particles that belongs to the quenched-Edwards-Wilkinson\ndepinning universality class. The model allows us to compare the cases of\nuniformly activated and Arrhenius activated hops. In the former case, the\nvelocity accurately follows a standard scaling law of the force and noise\nintensity with the analog of the thermal rounding exponent satisfying a\nmodified \"hyperscaling\" relation. For the Arrhenius activation, we find, both\nnumerically and analytically, that the standard scaling form fails for any\nvalue of the thermal rounding exponent. We propose an alternative scaling\nincorporating logarithmic corrections that appropriately fits the numerical\nresults. We argue that this anomalous scaling is related to the strong\ncorrelation between activated hops that, alternated with deterministic\ndepinning-like avalanches, occur below the depinning threshold. We rationalize\nthe spatiotemporal patterns by making an analogy of the present model in the\nnear-threshold creep regime with some well-known models with extremal dynamics,\nparticularly the Bak-Sneppen model.\n", "  Fast quantum spin manipulation is needed to design spin-based quantum logic\ngates and other quantum applications. Here, we construct exact evolution\noperator of the nitrogen-vacancy-center (NV) spin in diamond under external\nmagnetic fields and investigate the nonadiabatic geometric phases, both cyclic\nand non-cyclic, in these fast-manipulated NV spin systems. It is believed that\nthe nonadiabatic geometric phases can be measured in future experiments and\nthese fast quantum manipulations can be useful in designing spin-based quantum\napplications.\n", "  The nature of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) which is supposed to\nconstitute about 95% of the energy density of the universe is still a mystery.\nThere is no shortage of ideas regarding the nature of both. While some\ncandidates for DM are clearly ruled out, there is still a plethora of viable\nparticles that fit the bill. In the context of DE, while current observations\nfavour a cosmological constant picture, there are other competing models that\nare equally likely. This paper reviews the different possible candidates for DM\nincluding exotic candidates and their possible detection. This review also\ncovers the different models for DE and the possibility of unified models for DM\nand DE. Keeping in mind the negative results in some of the ongoing DM\ndetection experiments, here we also review the possible alternatives to both DM\nand DE (such as MOND and modifications of general relativity) and possible\nmeans of observationally distinguishing between the alternatives.\n", "  We interpret the recent discovery of a preferable VLBI/Gaia offset direction\nfor radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) along the parsec-scale radio jets\nas a manifestation of their optical structure on scales of 1 to 100\nmilliarcseconds. The extended jet structure affects the Gaia position stronger\nthan the VLBI position due to the difference in observing techniques. Gaia\ndetects total power while VLBI measures the correlated quantity, visibility,\nand therefore, sensitive to compact structures. The synergy of VLBI that is\nsensitive to the position of the most compact source component, usually\nassociated with the opaque radio core, and Gaia that is sensitive to the\ncentroid of optical emission, opens a window of opportunity to study optical\njets at milliarcsecond resolution, two orders of magnitude finer than the\nresolution of most existing optical instruments. We demonstrate that strong\nvariability of optical jets is able to cause a jitter comparable to the\nVLBI/Gaia offsets at a quiet state, i.e. several milliarcseconds. We show that\nthe VLBI/Gaia position jitter correlation with the AGN optical light curve may\nhelp to locate the region where the flare occurred, estimate its distance from\nthe super-massive black hole and the ratio of the flux density in the flaring\nregion to the total flux density.\n", "  White dwarfs have atmospheres that are expected to consist nearly entirely of\nhydrogen and helium, since heavier elements will sink out of sight on short\ntimescales. However, observations have revealed atmospheric pollution by\nheavier elements in about a quarter to a half of all white dwarfs. While most\nof the pollution can be accounted for with asteroidal or dwarf planetary\nmaterial, recent observations indicate that larger planetary bodies, as well as\nicy and volatile material from Kuiper belt analog objects, are also viable\nsources of pollution. The commonly accepted pollution mechanisms, namely\nscattering interactions between planetary bodies orbiting the white dwarfs, can\nhardly account for pollution by objects with large masses or long-period\norbits. Here we report on a mechanism that naturally leads to the emergence of\nmassive body and icy and volatile material pollution. This mechanism occurs in\nwide binary stellar systems, where the mass loss of the planets' host stars\nduring post main sequence stellar evolution can trigger the Eccentric\nKozai-Lidov mechanism. This mechanism leads to large eccentricity excitations,\nwhich can bring massive and long-period objects close enough to the white\ndwarfs to be accreted. We find that this mechanism readily explains and is\nconsistent with observations.\n", "  We explore theoretically the nonequilibrium photonic phases of an array of\ncoupled cavities in presence of incoherent driving and dissipation. In\nparticular, we consider a Hubbard model system where each site is a Kerr\nnonlinear resonator coupled to a two-level emitter, which is pumped\nincoherently. Within a Gutzwiller mean-field approach, we determine the\nsteady-state phase diagram of such a system. We find that, at a critical value\nof the inter-cavity photon hopping rate, a second-order nonequilibrium phase\ntransition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry\noccurs. The transition from an incompressible Mott-like photon fluid to a\ncoherent delocalized phase is driven by commensurability effects and not by the\ncompetition between photon hopping and optical nonlinearity. The essence of the\nmean-field predictions is corroborated by finite-size simulations obtained with\nmatrix product operators and corner-space renormalization methods.\n", "  Turbulence problem is often considered as \"the last unsolved problem of\nclassical physics\". It is due to strong interaction between velocity and/or\nvelocity gradient fluctuations, a high Reynolds number flow is a fascinating\nmixture of purely random, close to Gaussian, fields and coherent structures\nwhere substantial fraction of kinetic energy is dissipated into heat. To\nevaluate intensity of fluctuations, one usually studies different moments of\nvelocity increments and/or dissipation rate, characterized by scaling exponents\n$\\zeta_{n}$ and $d_{n}$, respectively. In high Reynolds number flows, the\nmoments of different orders with $n\\neq m$ cannot be simply related to each\nother, which is the signature of anomalous scaling, making this problem \"the\nlast unsolvable\". No perturbative treatment can lead to quantitative\ndescription of this feature. In this work the expressions for the moments of\ndissipation rate $e_{n}=\\overline{{\\cal E}^{n}}\\propto Re^{d_{n}}$ and those of\nvelocity derivatives $M_{2n}=\\overline{(\\partial_{x}u_{x})^{2n}}\\propto\n\\frac{v_{o}^{2n}}{L^{2n}}Re^{\\rho_{2n}}$ are derived for an infinite fluid\nstirred by a white-in-time Gaussian random force supported in the vicinity of\nthe wave number $k_{f}\\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{L}=O(1)$, where $v_{0}$ and $L$ are\ncharacteristic velocity and integral scale, respectively. A novel aspect of\nthis work is that unlike previous efforts which aimed at seeking solutions\naround the infinite Reynolds number limit, we concentrate on the vicinity of\ntransitional Reynolds numbers $Re^{tr}$ of the first emergence of anomalous\nscaling out of Low-Re Gaussian background. The obtained closed expressions for\nanomalous scaling exponents $d_{n}$ and $\\rho_{n}$ agree well with available in\nliterature experimental and numerical data and, when $n\\gg 1$, $d_{n}\\approx\n0.3n \\ln(n)$.\n", "  Superbosonization formula aims at rigorously calculating fermionic integrals\nvia employing supersymmetry. We derive such a supermatrix representation of\nsuperfield integrals and specify integration contours for the supermatrices.\nThe derivation is essentially based on the supersymmetric generalization of the\nItzikson-Zuber integral in the presence of anomalies in the Berezinian and\nshows how an integral over supervectors is eventually reduced to an integral\nover commuting variables. The approach is tested by calculating both one and\ntwo point correlation functions in a class of random matrix models. It is\nargued that the approach is capable of producing nonperturbative results in\nvarious systems with disorder, including physics of many-body localization, and\nother situations hosting localization phenomena.\n", "  We study the bulk viscosity of quark matter in the strong coupling regime\nwithin the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The dispersive effects that\nlead to non-zero bulk viscosity arise from quark-meson fluctuations above the\nMott transition temperature, where meson decay into two quarks is kinematically\nallowed. We adopt the Kubo-Zubarev formalism and compute the equilibrium\nimaginary-time correlation function for pressure in the $O(1/N_c)$ power\ncounting scheme. The bulk viscosity of matter is expressed in terms of the\nLorentz components of the quark spectral function and includes multi-loop\ncontributions which arise via re-summation of infinite geometrical series of\nloop diagrams. We show that the multi-loop contributions dominate the\nsingle-loop contribution close to the Mott line, whereas at high temperatures\nthe one-loop contribution is dominant. The multi-loop bulk viscosity dominates\nthe shear viscosity close to the Mott temperature by factors 5 to 20, but with\nincreasing temperature the shear viscosity becomes the dominant dissipation\nmechanism of stresses as the one-loop contribution becomes the main source of\nbulk viscosity.\n", "  We establish an abstract local ergodic theorem, under suitable space-time\nscaling, for the (boundary-driven) symmetric exclusion process on an increasing\nsequence of balls covering an infinite weighted graph. The proofs are based on\n1-block and 2-blocks estimates utilizing the resistance structure of the graph;\nthe moving particle lemma established recently by the author; and discrete\nharmonic analysis. Our ergodic theorem applies to any infinite weighted graph\nupon which random walk is strongly recurrent in the sense of Barlow, Delmotte,\nand Telcs; these include many trees, fractal graphs, and random graphs arising\nfrom percolation.\n  The main results of this paper are used to prove the joint density-current\nhydrodynamic limit of the boundary-driven exclusion process on the Sierpinski\ngasket, described in an upcoming paper with M. Hinz and A. Teplyaev.\n", "  Within the QCD light-cone sum rule (LCSR) approach, we investigate the\ntransition form factors of $D\\rightarrow a_0(980)$ up to the twist-3 light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the scalar meson $a_0(980)$ in the two-quark\npicture. Using these form factors, we calculate the differential decay widths\nand branching ratios of the $D\\rightarrow a_0(980) e^+ \\nu_e$ semileptonic\ndecays. We obtain ${\\mathcal B}(D^0\\rightarrow a_0^- (980) e^+\n\\nu_e)=(4.08^{+1.37}_{-1.22})\\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\\mathcal B}(D^+\\rightarrow\na_0^0 (980) e^+ \\nu_e)=(5.40^{+1.78}_{-1.59})\\times 10^{-4}$. The results are\nsensitive to the $a_0(980)$ inner structure. These decays can be searched for\nat BESIII experiment, and any experimental observations will be useful to\nidentify internal quark contents of the $a_0(980)$ meson, which will shed light\non understanding theoretical models.\n", "  We model the spectral quantum-mechanical purity of heralded single photons\nfrom a photon-pair source based on nondegenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing\ntaking the impact of distributed dispersion fluctuations into account. The\nconsidered photon-pair-generation scheme utilizes pump-pulse walk-off to\nproduce pure heralded photons and phase matching is achieved through the\ndispersion properties of distinct spatial modes in a few-mode silica step-index\nfiber. We show that fiber-core-radius fluctuations in general severely impact\nthe single-photon purity. Furthermore, by optimizing the fiber design we show\nthat generation of single photons with very high spectral purity is feasible\neven in the presence of large core-radius fluctuations. At the same time,\ncontamination from spontaneous Raman scattering is greatly mitigated by\nseparating the single-photon frequency by more than 32 THz from the pump\nfrequency.\n", "  The mass-imbalanced fermionic mixture is studied, where $N\\le5$ identical\nfermions interact resonantly with an impurity, a distinguishable atom. The\nshell structure is explored, and the physics of a dynamic light-impurity is\nshown to be different from that of the static heavy-impurity case. The energies\nin a harmonic trap at unitarity are calculated and extrapolated to the\nzero-range limit. In doing so, the scaling factor of the ground state, as well\nas of a few excited states, is calculated. In the $2 \\le N \\le 4$ systems, pure\n$(N+1)$ Efimov states exist for large enough mass ratio. However, no sign for a\nsix-body Efimov state in the $(5+1)$ system is found in the mass ratio\nexplored, $M/m \\le 12$.\n", "  We present an argon ion beam milling process to remove the native oxide layer\nforming on aluminum thin films due to their exposure to atmosphere in between\nlithographic steps. Our cleaning process is readily integrable with\nconventional fabrication of Josephson junction quantum circuits. From\nmeasurements of the internal quality factors of superconducting microwave\nresonators with and without contacts, we place an upper bound on the residual\nresistance of an ion beam milled contact of 50$\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\cdot \\mu\n\\mathrm{m}^2$ at a frequency of 4.5 GHz. Resonators for which only $6\\%$ of the\ntotal foot-print was exposed to the ion beam milling, in areas of low electric\nand high magnetic field, showed quality factors above $10^6$ in the single\nphoton regime, and no degradation compared to single layer samples. We believe\nthese results will enable the development of increasingly complex\nsuperconducting circuits for quantum information processing.\n", "  I suggest an extension of the SM by introducing a dark sector with the local\n$U(1)_{D}$ symmetry. The particles in the dark sector bring about the new\nphysics beyond the SM. In particular the global $B-L$ symmetry is violated just\nabove the electroweak scale, this becomes a common origin of the tiny neutrino\nmass, the cold dark mater and the baryon asymmetry. The model can not only\naccount for the tiny neutrino mass and the \"WIMP Miracle\", but also achieve the\nleptogenesis around the electroweak scale. Finally, it is very possible that\nthe model predictions are tested in near future experiments.\n", "  We revisit the relations between open and closed string scattering amplitudes\ndiscovered by Kawai, Lewellen, and Tye (KLT). We show that they emerge from the\nunderlying algebro-topological identities known as the twisted period\nrelations. In order to do so, we formulate tree-level string theory amplitudes\nin the language of twisted de Rham theory. There, open string amplitudes are\nunderstood as pairings between twisted cycles and cocycles. Similarly, closed\nstring amplitudes are given as a pairing between two twisted cocycles. Finally,\nobjects relating the two types of string amplitudes are the $\\alpha'$-corrected\nbi-adjoint scalar amplitudes recently defined by the author [arXiv:1610.04230].\nWe show that they naturally arise as intersection numbers of twisted cycles. In\nthis work we focus on the combinatorial and topological description of twisted\ncycles relevant for string theory amplitudes. In this setting, each twisted\ncycle is a polytope, known in combinatorics as the associahedron, together with\nan additional structure encoding monodromy properties of string integrals. In\nfact, this additional structure is given by higher-dimensional generalizations\nof the Pochhammer contour. An open string amplitude is then computed as an\nintegral of a logarithmic form over an associahedron. We show that the inverse\nof the KLT kernel can be calculated from the knowledge of how pairs of\nassociahedra intersect one another in the moduli space. In the field theory\nlimit, contributions from these intersections localize to vertices of the\nassociahedra, giving rise to the bi-adjoint scalar partial amplitudes.\n", "  The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by merging black holes\nhas recently opened up a new observational window into the Universe. The mass\nof the black holes in the first and third LIGO detections, ($36-29 \\,\n\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ and $32-19 \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$), suggests\nlow-metallicity stars as their most likely progenitors. Based on\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations, coupled with state-of-the-art metal\nenrichment models, we find that the remnants of Pop III stars are\npreferentially located within the cores of galaxies. The probability of a GW\nsignal to be generated by Pop III stars reaches $\\sim 90\\%$ at $\\sim 0.5 \\,\n\\mathrm{kpc}$ from the galaxy center, compared to a benchmark value of $\\sim\n5\\%$ outside the core. The predicted merger rates inside bulges is $\\sim 60\n\\times \\beta_{III} \\, \\mathrm{Gpc^{-3} \\, yr^{-1}}$ ($\\beta_{III}$ is the Pop\nIII binarity fraction). To match the $90\\%$ credible range of LIGO merger\nrates, we obtain: $0.03 < \\beta_{III} < 0.88$. Future advances in GW\nobservatories and the discovery of possible electromagnetic counterparts could\nallow the localization of such sources within their host galaxies. The\npreferential concentration of GW events within the bulge of galaxies would then\nprovide an indirect proof for the existence of Pop III stars.\n", "  The factorisation method commonly used in linear supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics is extended, such that it can be applied to nonlinear quantum\nmechanical systems. The new method is distinguishable from the linear\nformalism, as the superpotential is forced to become eigenfunction-dependent.\nAn example solution is given for the nonlinear Schroedinger equation and its\nsupersymmetric partner equation. This method allows new nonlinear evolution\nequations to be constructed from the solutions of known nonlinear equations,\nand has the potential to be a useful tool for mathematicians and physicists\nworking in the field of nonlinear systems, allowing the discovery of previously\nunknown `dualities' amongst soliton solutions and their respective equations.\n", "  We consider the space-time evolution of initial discontinuities of depth and\nflow velocity for an integrable version of the shallow water Boussinesq system\nintroduced by Kaup. We focus on a specific version of this \"Kaup-Boussinesq\nmodel\" for which a flat water surface is modulationally stable, we speak below\nof \"positive dispersion\" model. This model also appears as an approximation to\nthe equations governing the dynamics of polarisation waves in two-component\nBose-Einstein condensates. We describe its periodic solutions and the\ncorresponding Whitham modulation equations. The self-similar, one-phase wave\nstructures are composed of different building blocks which are studied in\ndetail. This makes it possible to establish a classification of all the\npossible wave configurations evolving from initial discontinuities. The\nanalytic results are confirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  In this article, we discuss a verification study of an operational solar\nflare forecast in the Regional Warning Center (RWC) Japan. The RWC Japan has\nbeen issuing four-categorical deterministic solar flare forecasts for a long\ntime. In this forecast verification study, we used solar flare forecast data\naccumulated over 16 years (from 2000 to 2015). We compiled the forecast data\ntogether with solar flare data obtained with the Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites (GOES). Using the compiled data sets, we estimated\nsome conventional scalar verification measures with 95% confidence intervals.\nWe also estimated a multi-categorical scalar verification measure. These scalar\nverification measures were compared with those obtained by the persistence\nmethod and recurrence method. As solar activity varied during the 16 years, we\nalso applied verification analyses to four subsets of forecast-observation pair\ndata with different solar activity levels. We cannot conclude definitely that\nthere are significant performance difference between the forecasts of RWC Japan\nand the persistence method, although a slightly significant difference is found\nfor some event definitions. We propose to use a scalar verification measure to\nassess the judgment skill of the operational solar flare forecast. Finally, we\npropose a verification strategy for deterministic operational solar flare\nforecasting.\n", "  Exoplanet Proxima b will be an important laboratory for the search for\nextraterrestrial life for the decades ahead. Here we discuss the prospects of\ndetecting carbon dioxide at 15 um using a spectral filtering technique with the\nMedium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) mode of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)\non the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). At superior conjunction, the planet\nis expected to show a contrast of up to 100 ppm with respect to the star. At a\nspectral resolving power of R=1790-2640, about 100 spectral CO2 features are\nvisible within the 13.2-15.8 um (3B) band, which can be combined to boost the\nplanet atmospheric signal by a factor 3-4, depending on the atmospheric\ntemperature structure and CO2 abundance. If atmospheric conditions are\nfavorable (assuming an Earth-like atmosphere), with this new application to the\ncross-correlation technique carbon dioxide can be detected within a few days of\nJWST observations. However, this can only be achieved if both the instrumental\nspectral response and the stellar spectrum can be determined to a relative\nprecision of <= 1e-4 between adjacent spectral channels. Absolute flux\ncalibration is not required, and the method is insensitive to the strong\nbroadband variability of the host star. Precise calibration of the spectral\nfeatures of the host star may only be attainable by obtaining deep observations\nof the system during inferior conjunction that serve as a reference. The\nhigh-pass filter spectroscopic technique with the MIRI MRS can be tested on\nwarm Jupiters, Neptunes, and super-Earths with significantly higher planet/star\ncontrast ratios than the Proxima system.\n", "  Showers of $\\gamma$-rays and positrons are produced when a high-energy\nelectron beam collides with a super-intense laser pulse. We present scaling\nlaws for the electron beam energy loss, the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum, and the\npositron yield and energy that are valid in the non-linear,\nradiation-reaction--dominated regime. As an application we demonstrate that by\nemploying the collision of a $>$GeV electron beam with a laser pulse of\nintensity $>5\\times10^{21}\\,\\text{Wcm}^{-2}$, today's high-intensity laser\nfacilities are capable of producing $O(10^4)$ positrons per shot via\nlight-by-light scattering.\n", "  The composition dependence of gravitational constant $G$ is measured at the\nmillimeter scale to test the weak equivalence principle, which may be violated\nat short range through new Yukawa interactions such as the dilaton exchange\nforce. A torsion balance on a turning table with two identical tungsten targets\nsurrounded by two different attractor materials (copper and aluminum) is used\nto measure gravitational torque by means of digital measurements of a position\nsensor. Values of the ratios $\\tilde{G}_{Al-W}/\\tilde{G}_{Cu-W} -1$ and\n$\\tilde{G}_{Cu-W}/G_{N} -1$ were $(0.9 \\pm 1.1_{\\mathrm{sta}} \\pm\n4.8_{\\mathrm{sys}}) \\times 10^{-2}$ and $ (0.2 \\pm 0.9_{\\mathrm{sta}} \\pm\n2.1_{\\mathrm{sys}}) \\times 10^{-2}$ , respectively; these were obtained at a\ncenter to center separation of 1.7 cm and surface to surface separation of 4.5\nmm between target and attractor, which is consistent with the universality of\n$G$. A weak equivalence principle (WEP) violation parameter of\n$\\eta_{Al-Cu}(r\\sim 1\\: \\mathrm{cm})=(0.9 \\pm 1.1_{\\mathrm{sta}} \\pm\n4.9_{\\mathrm{sys}}) \\times 10^{-2} $ at the shortest range of around 1 cm was\nalso obtained.\n", "  Relations between the nuclear symmetry energy coefficient and its density\nderivatives are derived. The relations hold for a class of interactions with\nquadratic momentum dependence and a power-law density dependence. The\nstructural connection between the different symmetry energy elements as\nobtained seems to be followed by almost all reasonable nuclear energy density\nfunctionals, both relativistic and non-relativistic, suggesting a universality\nin the correlation structure. This, coupled with known values of some\nwell-accepted constants related to nuclear matter, helps in constraining values\nof different density derivatives of the nuclear symmetry energy shedding light\non the isovector part of the nuclear interaction.\n", "  The equations governing the perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric satisfy\nthe Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-Moncrief system. Applying the technique introduced in\n[2], we prove an integrated local energy decay estimate for both the\nRegge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations. In these proofs, we use some constants\nthat are computed numerically. Furthermore, we make use of the $r^p$ hierarchy\nestimates [13, 32] to prove that both the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli variables\ndecay as $t^{-\\frac{3}{2}}$ in fixed regions of $r$.\n", "  The architectures of debris disks encode the history of planet formation in\nthese systems. Studies of debris disks via their spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) have found infrared excesses arising from cold dust, warm dust, or a\ncombination of the two. The cold outer belts of many systems have been imaged,\nfacilitating their study in great detail. Far less is known about the warm\ncomponents, including the origin of the dust. The regularity of the disk\ntemperatures indicates an underlying structure that may be linked to the water\nsnow line. If the dust is generated from collisions in an exo-asteroid belt,\nthe dust will likely trace the location of the water snow line in the\nprimordial protoplanetary disk where planetesimal growth was enhanced. If\ninstead the warm dust arises from the inward transport from a reservoir of icy\nmaterial farther out in the system, the dust location is expected to be set by\nthe current snow line. We analyze the SEDs of a large sample of debris disks\nwith warm components. We find that warm components in single-component systems\n(those without detectable cold components) follow the primordial snow line\nrather than the current snow line, so they likely arise from exo-asteroid\nbelts. While the locations of many warm components in two-component systems are\nalso consistent with the primordial snow line, there is more diversity among\nthese systems, suggesting additional effects play a role.\n", "  The evolution of the filamentary 3-Kelvin (3K) superconducting phase at the\ninterface between Sr2RuO4 and Ru-metal inclusions is discussed for\nPb-Ru-Sr2RuO4 contacts. Using the Ginzburg-Landau model, the influence of\nproximity-induced superconductivity in Ru on the topology of the 3K phase is\nanalyzed. Because the s-wave order parameter in Ru favors a 3K state of trivial\ntopology, the onset temperature of the phase with a non-trivial topology, which\nis compatible with the bulk phase of Sr2RuO4, is essentially reduced to the\nbulk transition temperature. Because the topology of the superconducting state\nin Sr2RuO4 is crucial for the Josephson effect through Pb-Ru-Sr2RuO4 contacts,\nthis model qualitatively reproduces the experimental observation of the\nanomalous temperature dependence on the critical current.\n", "  We present a general, numerically motivated approach to the construction of\nsymmetry adapted basis functions for solving ro-vibrational Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequations. The approach is based on the property of the Hamiltonian operator to\ncommute with the complete set of symmetry operators and hence to reflect the\nsymmetry of the system. The symmetry adapted ro-vibrational basis set is\nconstructed numerically by solving a set of reduced vibrational eigenvalue\nproblems. In order to assign the irreducible representations associated with\nthese eigenfunctions, their symmetry properties are probed on a grid of\nmolecular geometries with the corresponding symmetry operations. The\ntransformation matrices are re-constructed by solving over-determined systems\nof linear equations related to the transformation properties of the\ncorresponding wavefunctions on the grid. Our method is implemented in the\nvariational approach TROVE and has been successfully applied to a number of\nproblems covering the most important molecular symmetry groups. Several\nexamples are used to illustrate the procedure, which can be easily applied to\ndifferent types of coordinates, basis sets, and molecular systems.\n", "  In this manuscript, we present a general computational method for\ncharacterizing the molecular structure of liquid water interfaces as sampled\nfrom atomistic simulations. With this method, the interfacial structure is\nquantified based on the statistical analysis of the orientational\nconfigurations of interfacial water molecules. The method can be applied to\ngenerate position dependent maps of the hydration properties of heterogeneous\nsurfaces. We present an application to the characterization of surface\nhydrophobicity, which we use to analyze simulations of a hydrated protein. We\ndemonstrate that this approach is capable of revealing microscopic details of\nthe collective dynamics of a protein hydration shell.\n", "  Motivated by the study of directed polymer models with random weights on the\nsquare integer lattice, we define an integrability property shared by the\nlog-gamma, strict-weak, beta, and inverse-beta models. This integrability\nproperty encapsulates a preservation in distribution of ratios of partition\nfunctions which in turn implies the so called Burke property. We show that\nunder some regularity assumptions, up to trivial modifications, there exist no\nother models possessing this property.\n", "  The methods of quantum field theory are widely used in condensed matter\nphysics. In particular, the concept of an effective action was proven useful\nwhen studying low temperature and long distance behavior of condensed matter\nsystems. Often the degrees of freedom which appear due to spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking or an emergent gauge symmetry, have non-trivial topology. In those\ncases, the terms in the effective action describing low energy degrees of\nfreedom can be metric independent (topological). We consider a few examples of\ntopological terms of different types and discuss some of their consequences. We\nwill also discuss the origin of these terms and calculate effective actions for\nseveral fermionic models. In this approach, topological terms appear as phases\nof fermionic determinants and represent quantum anomalies of fermionic models.\nIn addition to the wide use of topological terms in high energy physics, they\nappeared to be useful in studies of charge and spin density waves, Quantum Hall\nEffect, spin chains, frustrated magnets, topological insulators and\nsuperconductors, and some models of high-temperature superconductivity.\n", "  We explore the range over which the elasticity of disordered spring networks\ncan be manipulated by the removal of selected bonds. By taking into account the\nlocal response of a bond, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of pruning can\nbe improved so that auxetic (i.e., negative Poisson's ratio) materials can be\ndesigned without the formation of cracks even while maintaining the global\nisotropy of the network. The bulk, $B$, and shear, $G$, moduli scale with the\nnumber of bonds removed and we estimate the exponents characterizing these\npower laws. We also find that there are spatial correlation lengths in the\nchange of $B$ and $G$ upon removing different bonds that diverge as the network\napproaches the isostatic limit where the excess coordination number $\\Delta\nZ\\rightarrow0$.\n", "  Astrochemistry plays a central role during the process of star formation,\nboth in the primordial regime as well as in the present-day Universe. We\nrevisit here the chemistry in both regimes, focusing first on the chemistry\nunder close to primordial conditions, as observed in the so-called Caffau star\nSDSS J102915+172927, and subsequently discuss deuteration processes in\npresent-day star-forming cores. In models of the high-redshift Universe, the\nchemistry is particularly relevant to determine the cooling, while it also\nserves as an important diagnostic in the case of present-day star formation.\n", "  The role of the small-norm amplitudes in extended RPA theories such as the\nparticle-particle and hole-hole components of one-body amplitudes and the\ntwo-body amplitudes other than two particle - two holes components are\ninvestigated for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using an extended RPA\nderived from the time-dependent density-matrix theory. It is found that these\namplitudes cannot be neglected in strongly interacting regions where the\neffects of ground-state correlations are significant.\n", "  Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) holds great promise for breast cancer\nscreening. Waveform inversion-based image reconstruction methods account for\nhigher order diffraction effects and can produce high-resolution USCT images,\nbut are computationally demanding. Recently, a source encoding technique was\ncombined with stochastic gradient descent to greatly reduce image\nreconstruction times. However, this method bundles the stochastic data fidelity\nterm with the deterministic regularization term. This limitation can be\novercome by replacing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a structured\noptimization method, such as the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that\nexploits knowledge of the composition of the cost function. In this work, the\ndual averaging method is combined with source encoding techniques to improve\nthe effectiveness of regularization while maintaining the reduced\nreconstruction times afforded by source encoding. It is demonstrated that each\niteration can be decomposed into a gradient descent step based on the data\nfidelity term and a proximal update step corresponding to the regularization\nterm. Furthermore, the regularization term is never explicitly differentiated,\nallowing non-smooth regularization penalties to be naturally incorporated. The\nwave equation is solved by use of a time-domain method. The effectiveness of\nthis approach is demonstrated through computer-simulation and experimental\nstudies. The results suggest that the dual averaging method can produce images\nwith less noise and comparable resolution to those obtained by use of\nstochastic gradient descent.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments, the isotropic-nematic phase transition in\nchromonic liquid crystals is studied. As temperature decreases, nematic nuclei\nnucleate, grow, and coalesce, giving rise to tactoid microstructures in an\nisotropic liquid. These tactoids produce topological defects at domain\njunctions (disclinations in the bulk or point defects on the surface). We\nsimulate such tactoid equilibria and their coarsening dynamics with a model\nusing degree of order, a variable length director, and an interfacial normal as\nstate descriptors. We adopt Ericksen's work and introduce an augmented\nOseen-Frank energy, with non-convexity in both interfacial energy and the\ndependence of the energy on the degree of order. A gradient flow dynamics of\nthis energy does not succeed in reproducing some simple expected feature of\ntactoid dynamics. Therefore, a strategy is devised based on continuum\nkinematics and thermodynamics to represent such features. The model is used to\npredict tactoid nucleation, expansion, and coalescence during the process of\nphase transition. We reproduce observed behaviors in experiments and perform an\nexperimentally testable parametric study of the effect of bulk elastic and\ntactoid interfacial energy parameters on the interaction of interfacial and\nbulk fields in the tactoids.\n", "  The properties of the boundary plasma in a tokamak are now recognized to play\na key role in determining the achievable fusion power and the lifetimes of\nplasma-facing components. Accurate quantitative modeling and improved\nqualitative understanding of the boundary plasma ultimately require\nfive-dimensional gyrokinetic turbulence simulations, which have been successful\nin predicting turbulence and transport in the core. The additional challenges\nof boundary-plasma simulation necessitate the development of new gyrokinetic\ncodes or major modifications to existing core gyrokinetic codes. In this\nthesis, we develop the first gyrokinetic continuum code capable of simulating\nplasma turbulence on open magnetic field lines, which is a key feature of a\ntokamak scrape-off layer. In contrast to prior attempts at this problem, we use\nan energy-conserving discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space. To model\nthe interaction between the plasma and the wall, we design conducting-sheath\nboundary conditions that permit local currents into and out of the wall. We\nstart by designing spatially one-dimensional kinetic models of parallel SOL\ndynamics and solve these systems using novel continuum algorithms. By\ngeneralizing these algorithms to higher dimensions and adding a model for\ncollisions, we present results from the first gyrokinetic continuum simulations\nof turbulence on two types of open-field-line systems. The first simulation\nfeatures uniform and straight field lines, such as found in some linear plasma\ndevices. The second simulation is of a hypothetical model we developed of the\nNSTX scrape-off layer featuring helical field lines. These developments\ncomprise a major step towards a gyrokinetic continuum code for quantitative\npredictions of turbulence and transport in the boundary plasma of magnetic\nfusion devices.\n", "  Characterizing criticality in quantum many-body systems of dimension $\\ge 2$\nis one of the most important challenges of the contemporary physics. In\nprinciple, there is no generally valid theoretical method that could solve this\nproblem. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to identify the\ncriticality of quantum systems in higher dimensions. Departing from the\nanalysis of the numerical renormalization group flows, we build a general\nequivalence between the higher-dimensional ground state and a one-dimensional\n(1D) quantum state defined in the imaginary time direction in terms of the\nso-called time matrix product state (tMPS). We show that the criticality of the\ntargeted model can be faithfully identified by the tMPS, using the mature\nscaling schemes of correlation length and entanglement entropy in 1D quantum\ntheories. We benchmark our proposal with the results obtained for the\nHeisenberg anti-ferromagnet on honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate critical\nscaling relation of the tMPS for the gapless case, and a trivial scaling for\nthe gapped case with spatial anisotropy. The critical scaling behaviors are\ninsensitive to the system size, suggesting the criticality can be identified in\nsmall systems. Our tMPS scheme for critical scaling shows clearly that the\nspin-1/2 kagom\\'e Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a gapless ground state. More\ngenerally, the present study indicates that the 1D conformal field theories in\nimaginary time provide a very useful tool to characterize the criticality of\nhigher dimensional quantum systems.\n", "  Super-rotations of the planetary atmosphere are reconsidered from the\ndynamical point of view. In particular, we emphasize that the super-rotation\nappears spontaneously without any explicit force. Although the super-rotation\nviolates the bilateral symmetry (east-west reflection symmetry) of the system,\nthis violation is spontaneous. Constructing a minimal model that derives the\nsuper-rotation, we clarify the condition for the super-rotation to appear. We\nfind that the flow is always determined autonomously so that the flow speed\nbecomes maximum or the temperature difference smallest. After constraining the\nparameters of the model from observations, we compare our model with the others\nmost of which demand the explicit symmetry violation due to the planetary\nrotation.\n", "  Prostate cancer is the most common disease in men and the second leading\ncause of death from cancer. Generic large imaging instruments used in cancer\ndiagnosis have sensitivity, spatial resolution, and contrast inadequate for the\ntask of imaging details of a small organ such as the prostate. In addition,\nmultimodality imaging can play a significant role merging anatomical and\nfunctional details coming from simultaneous PET and MRI. Indeed,\nmulti-parametric PET/MRI was demonstrated to improve diagnosis, but it suffers\nfrom too many false positives. In order to address the above limits of the\ncurrent techniques, we have proposed, built and tested, thanks to the TOPEM\nproject funded by Italian National Institute of Nuclear Phisics a prototype of\nan endorectal PET-TOF/MRI probe. In the applied magnification PET geometry,\nperformance is dominated by a high-resolution detector placed closer to the\nsource. The expected spatial resolution in the selected geometry is about 1.5\nmm FWHM and efficiency a factor of 2 with respect to what obtained with the\nconventional PET scanner. In our experimental studies, we have obtained timing\nresolution of ~ 320 ps FWHM and at the same time Depth of Interaction (DOI)\nresolution of under 1 mm. Tests also showed that mutual adverse PET-MR effects\nare minimal. In addition, the matching endorectal RF coil was designed, built\nand tested. In the next planned studies, we expect that benefiting from the\nfurther progress in scintillator crystal surface treatment, in SiPM technology\nand associated electronics would allow us to significantly improve TOF\nresolution\n", "  Several computer models exist to explain the observation of terrestrial\ngamma-ray flashes (TGFs). Some of these models estimate the electric field\nahead of lightning leaders and its effects on electron acceleration and\nmultiplication. In this paper, we derive a new set of constraints to do more\nrealistic modeling. We determine initial conditions based on in situ\nmeasurements of electric field and vertical separation between the main charge\nlayers of thunderclouds. A maximum electric field strength of 50 kV/cm at sea\nlevel is introduced as the upper constraint for the leader electric field. The\nthreshold for electron avalanches to develop of 2.86 kV/cm at sea level is\nintroduced as the lower value. With these constraints, we determine a region\nwhere acceleration and multiplication of electrons occur. The maximum potential\ndifference in this region is found to be $\\sim$52 MV, and the corresponding\nnumber of avalanche multiplication lengths is $\\sim$3.5. We then quantify the\neffect of the ambient electric field compared to the leader field at the upper\naltitude of the negative tip. Finally, we argue that only leaders with the\nhighest potential difference between its tips ($\\sim$600 MV) can be candidates\nfor the production of TGFs. However, with the assumptions we have used, these\ncannot explain the observed maximum energies of at least 40 MeV. Open questions\nwith regard to the temporal development of the streamer zone and its effect on\nthe shape of the electric field remain.\n", "  On 25 October 2012 the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager\n(RHESSI) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites passed\nover a thunderstorm on the coast of Sri Lanka. RHESSI observed a terrestrial\ngamma ray flash (TGF) originating from this thunderstorm. Optical measurements\nof the causative lightning stroke were made by the lightning imaging sensor\n(LIS) on board TRMM. The World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) detected\nthe very low frequency (VLF) radio emissions from the lightning stroke. The\ngeolocation from WWLLN, which we also assume is the TGF source location, was in\nthe convective core of the cloud. By using new information about both RHESSI\nand LIS timing accuracy, we find that the peak in the TGF light curve occurs\n230 $\\mu$s before the WWLLN time. Analysis of the optical signal from LIS shows\nthat within the uncertainties, we cannot conclude which comes first: the gamma\nemission or the optical emission. We have also applied the new information\nabout the LIS timing on a previously published event by {\\O}stgaard et al.\n(2012). Also for this event we are not able to conclude which signal comes\nfirst. More accurate instruments are needed in order to get the exact timing\nbetween the TGF and the optical signal.\n", "  We study the fate of interacting quantum systems which are periodically\ndriven by switching back and forth between two integrable Hamiltonians. This\nprovides an unconventional and tunable way of breaking integrability, in the\nsense that the stroboscopic time evolution will generally be described by a\nFloquet Hamiltonian which progressively becomes less integrable as the driving\nfrequency is reduced. Here, we exemplify this idea in spin chains subjected to\nperiodic switching between two integrable anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonians.\nWe distinguish the integrability-breaking effects of resonant interactions and\nperturbative (local) interactions, and illustrate these by contrasting\ndifferent measures of energy in Floquet states and through a study of level\nspacing statistics. This scenario is argued to be representative for general\ndriven interacting integrable systems.\n", "  Core-periphery networks are structures that present a set of central and\ndensely connected nodes, namely the core, and a set of non-central and sparsely\nconnected nodes, namely the periphery. The rich-club refers to a set in which\nthe highest degree nodes show a high density of connections. Thus, a network\nthat displays a rich-club can be interpreted as a core-periphery network in\nwhich the core is made up by a number of hubs. In this paper, we test the\nresilience of networks showing a progressively denser rich-club and we observe\nhow this structure is able to affect the network measures in terms of both\ncohesion and efficiency in information flow. Additionally, we consider the case\nin which, instead of making the core denser, we add links to the periphery.\nThese two procedures of core and periphery thickening delineate a decision\nprocess in the placement of new links and allow us to conduct a scenario\nanalysis that can be helpful in the comprehension and supervision of complex\nnetworks under the resilience perspective. The advantages of the two\nprocedures, as well as their implications, are discussed in relation to both\nnetwork effciency and node heterogeneity.\n", "  We propose and compare several projection methods applied to variational\nintegrators for degenerate Lagrangian systems, whose Lagrangian is of the form\n$L = \\vartheta(q) \\cdot \\dot{q} - H(q)$ and thus linear in velocities. While\nprevious methods for such systems only work reliably in the case of $\\vartheta$\nbeing a linear function of $q$, our methods are long-time stable also for\nsystems where $\\vartheta$ is a nonlinear function of $q$. We analyse the\nproperties of the resulting algorithms, in particular with respect to the\nconservation of energy, momentum maps and symplecticity. In numerical\nexperiments, we verify the favourable properties of the projected integrators\nand demonstrate their excellent long-time fidelity. In particular, we consider\na two-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system, planar point vortices with\nposition-dependent circulation and guiding centre dynamics.\n", "  A recent paper [X. Guo, A. Mandelis, J. Tolev and K. Tang, J. Appl. Phys.,\n121, 095101 (2017)] intends to demonstrate that from the photothermal\nradiometry signal obtained on a coated opaque sample in 1D transfer, one should\nbe able to identify separately the following three parameters of the coating:\nthermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and thickness. In this comment, it is\nshown that the three parameters are correlated in the considered experimental\narrangement, the identifiability criterion is in error and the thickness\ninferred therefrom is not trustable.\n", "  Deep galaxy surveys have revealed that the global star formation rate (SFR)\ndensity in the Universe peaks at 1 < z < 2 and sharply declines towards z = 0.\nBut a clear picture of the underlying processes, in particular the evolution of\ncold atomic (~100 K) and molecular gas phases, that drive such a strong\nevolution is yet to emerge. MALS is designed to use MeerKAT's L- and UHF-band\nreceivers to carry out the most sensitive (N(HI)>10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$)\ndust-unbiased search of intervening HI 21-cm and OH 18-cm absorption lines at 0\n< z < 2. This will provide reliable measurements of the evolution of cold\natomic and molecular gas cross-sections of galaxies, and unravel the processes\ndriving the steep evolution in the SFR density. The large sample of HI and OH\nabsorbers obtained from the survey will (i) lead to tightest constraints on the\nfundamental constants of physics, and (ii) be ideally suited to probe the\nevolution of magnetic fields in disks of galaxies via Zeeman Splitting or\nRotation Measure synthesis. The survey will also provide an unbiased census of\nHI and OH absorbers, i.e. cold gas associated with powerful AGNs (>10$^{24}$ W\nHz$^{-1}$) at 0 < z < 2, and will simultaneously deliver a blind HI and OH\nemission line survey, and radio continuum survey. Here, we describe the MALS\nsurvey design, observing plan and the science issues to be addressed under\nvarious science themes.\n", "  Cross-term spatiotemporal encoding (xSPEN) is a recently introduced imaging\napproach delivering single-scan 2D NMR images with unprecedented resilience to\nfield inhomogeneities. The method relies on performing a pre-acquisition\nencoding and a subsequent image read out while using the disturbing frequency\ninhomogeneities as part of the image formation processes, rather than as\nartifacts to be overwhelmed by the application of external gradients. This\nstudy introduces the use of this new single-shot MRI technique as a\ndiffusion-monitoring tool, for accessing regions that have hitherto been\nunapproachable by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods. In order to achieve\nthis, xSPEN MRIs intrinsic diffusion weighting effects are formulated using a\ncustomized, spatially-localized b-matrix analysis; with this, we devise a novel\ndiffusion-weighting scheme that both exploits and overcomes xSPENs strong\nintrinsic weighting effects. The ability to provide reliable and robust\ndiffusion maps in challenging head and brain regions, including the eyes and\nthe optic nerves, is thus demonstrated in humans at 3T; new avenues for imaging\nother body regions are also briefly discussed.\n", "  Boron carbide thin films of different thicknesses deposited by ion beam\nsputtering were studied. The deposited films were characterized by grazing\nincidence hard x-ray reflectivity (GIXR), resonant soft x-ray reflectivity\n(RSXR), x-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), resonant Rutherford\nbackscattering spectrometry (RRBS), and time of flight secondary ion mass\nspectrometry (TOF-SIMS). An in-depth profile of the chemical elements\nconstitute the films is reconstructed based on analysis of reflectivity curves\nmeasured in the vicinity of B K-edge. The composition of films is closely\ndependent on film thickness. Boron to Carbon (B/C) ratio reaches to ~4 as the\nthickness of deposited films increases. The B/C ratio estimated from RSXR\nmeasurements are in agreement with the RRBS measurements. TOF-SIMS data also\nsuggested that decrease in boron content with decrease in film thickness. XPS\nmeasurements confirm the presence of little amount of B atoms on the surface of\nlow thickness film.\n", "  The magnetic anisotropy (MA) of Mo/Au/Co0.9Fe0.1/Au/MgO(0.7 - 3\nnm)/Au/Co0.9Fe0.1/Au heterostructure has been investigated at room temperature\nas a function of MgO layer thickness (tMgO). Our studies show that while the MA\nof the top layer does not change its character upon variation of tMgO, the\nuniaxial out-of-plane MA of the bottom one undergoes a spin reorientation\ntransition at tMgO of about 0.8 nm, switching to the regime where the\ncoexistence of in- and out-of-plane magnetization alignments is observed. The\nmagnitudes of the magnetic anisotropy constants have been determined from\nferromagnetic resonance and dc-magnetometry measurements. The origin of MA\nevolution has been attributed to a presence of an interlayer exchange coupling\n(IEC) between Co0.9Fe0.1 layers through the thin MgO film.\n", "  We consider a charged black hole with a scalar field that is coupled to\ngravity in (2 + 1)-dimensions. We compute the logarithmic corrections to the\ncorresponding system using two approaches. In the first method we take\nadvantage of thermodynamic properties. In the second method we use the metric\nfunction that is suggested by conformal field theory. Finally, we compare the\nresults of the two approaches.\n", "  We study rigid surface operators in the $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheories with gauge groups $SO(n)$ and $Sp(2n)$. Using maps $X_S$ and $Y_S$\nbetween these two theories, Wyllard made explicit proposals for how the\n$S$-duality map should act on certain subclasses of surface operators. We study\nthe maps $X_S$ and $Y_S$ further and simplify the construction of symbol\ninvariant of rigid surface operators by a convenient trick. By consistency\nchecks, we recover and extend the $S$-duality maps proposed by Wyllard. We find\nnew subclasses of rigid surface operators related by $S$-duality. We try to\nexplain the exceptions of $S$-duality maps. We also discuss the extension of\nthe techniques used in the $B_n/C_n$ theories to the $D_n$ theories.\n", "  Short review of experimental and theoretical researches influence of inner\nboundaries at properties of composite materials. Reviewing articles that are\nmade at the last, approximately, thirty years, and which demonstrate role of\ninner boundaries in determining the properties of composite materials.\n", "  Existence, Uniqueness and monotonic behavior of the solution of classical\nflow distribution problem for hydraulic networks with pressure-dependent\nclosure relations was proved. Structure and properties of inverse Maxwell\nmatrix of the problem were investigated\n", "  We propose and implement a lattice scheme for coherently manipulating atomic\nspins. Using the vector light shift and a superlattice structure, we\ndemonstrate experimentally the capability on parallel spin addressing in\ndouble-wells and square plaquettes with subwavelength resolution. Quantum\ncoherence of spin manipulations is verified through measuring atom tunneling\nand spin exchange dynamics. Our experiment presents a building block for\nengineering many-body quantum states in optical lattices for realizing quantum\nsimulation and computation tasks.\n", "  In this essay we conjecture that quantum fields such as the Higgs field is\nrelated to a restricted Boltzmann machine for deep neural networks. An\naccelerating Rindler observer in a flat spacetime sees the quantum fields\nhaving a thermal distribution from the quantum entanglement, and a\nrenormalization group process for the thermal fields on a lattice is similar to\na deep learning algorithm.\n  This correspondence can be generalized for the KMS states of quantum fields\nin a curved spacetime like a black hole.\n", "  Taking advantage from a recent analog realization of certain automata via\nspectral encodings as permutation machines, we reach at an improved version of\nthe previously introduced remotely acting Maxwellian demon in arXiv:1408.3797.\nA number of alternative encodings for the processing substrate of similar\nagents is presented together with the new net work gain\n", "  We suggest a possibility that the photon can acquire a finite mass in a\nmedium when the external interaction and symmetry is broken on the basis of\nChern-Simons gauge theory.\n", "  While no regularization is consistent with the anomalous chiral symmetry\nwhich occurs for massless fermions, the artificial axion-induced symmetry for\nmassive fermions is shown here to be consistent with a standard regularization,\neven in curved spacetime, so that it can be said to have no anomaly in gauge or\ngravitational fields. Implications for theta terms are pointed out.\n", "  Topological insulators (TI's) are a new class of quantum matter with\nextraordinary surface electronic states, which bear great potential for\nspintronics and error-tolerant quantum computing. In order to put a TI into any\npractical use, these materials need to be fabricated into devices whose basic\nunits are often p-n junctions. Unique electronic properties of a 'topological'\np-n junction were proposed theoretically such as the junction electronic state\nand the spin rectification. However, the fabrication of a lateral topological\np-n junction has been challenging because of materials, process, and\nfundamental reasons. Here, we demonstrate an innovative approach to realize a\np-n junction of topological surface states (TSS's) of a three-dimensional (3D)\ntopological insulator (TI) with an atomically abrupt interface. When a\nultrathin Sb film is grown on a 3D TI of Bi2Se3 with a typical n-type TSS, the\nsurface develops a strongly p-type TSS through the substantial hybridization\nbetween the 2D Sb film and the Bi2Se3 surface. Thus, the Bi2Se3 surface covered\npartially with Sb films bifurcates into areas of n- and p-type TSS's as\nseparated by atomic step edges with a lateral electronic junction of as short\nas 2 nm. This approach opens a different avenue toward various electronic and\nspintronic devices based on well defined topological p-n junctions with the\nscalability down to atomic dimensions\n", "  In this paper we consider a quantum version of Pascal's triangle. Pascal's\ntriangle is a well-known triangular array of numbers and when these numbers are\nplotted modulo 2, a fractal known as the Sierpinski triangle appears. We first\nprove the appearance of more general fractals when Pascal's triangle is\nconsidered modulo prime powers. The numbers in Pascal's triangle can be\nobtained by scaling the probabilities of the simple symmetric random walk on\nthe line. In this paper we consider a quantum version of Pascal's triangle by\nreplacing the random walk by the quantum walk known as the Hadamard walk. We\nshow that when the amplitudes of the Hadamard walk are scaled to become\nintegers and plotted modulo three, a fractal known as the Sierpinski carpet\nemerges and we provide a proof of this using Lucas's theorem. We furthermore\ngive a general class of quantum walks for which this phenomenon occurs.\n", "  In the analysis of VERITAS and other IACT data, it is expected to get a\ndistribution of statistical significances in sky map bins with mean of zero and\nwidth of unity in the absence of a $\\gamma$-ray signal. However, it is not\nuncommon to see significance distributions of width greater than unity,\nindicating that the background is poorly estimated and the significances in the\nregion of interest are incorrect. This work explores the origins of these wider\nsignificance distributions and develop solutions to this issue and test these\nsolutions on samples of VERITAS data.\n", "  In the cosmological paradigm, cold dark matter (DM) dominates the mass\ncontent of the Universe and is present at every scale. Candidates for DM\ninclude many extensions of the Standard Model with weakly interacting massive\nparticles (WIMPs) in the mass range from ~10 GeV to greater than 10 TeV. The\nself-annihilation or decay of WIMPs in astrophysical regions of high DM density\ncan produce secondary particles including very-high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV)\ngamma rays. VERITAS, an array of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, sensitive to\nVHE gamma rays in the 85 GeV-30 TeV energy range, has been utilized for\nindirect DM searches. Astrophysical candidates for indirect DM detection by\nVERITAS are dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group and the\nGalactic Center, among others. This is a report on the current status of\nVERITAS observations of dark matter targets and the results of a combined\nsearch of four dSphs.\n", "  Experiments looking for rare events like the direct detection of dark matter\nparticles, neutrino interactions or the nuclear double beta decay are operated\ndeep underground to suppress the effect of cosmic rays. But the production of\nradioactive isotopes in materials due to previous exposure to cosmic rays is an\nhazard when ultra-low background conditions are required. In this context, the\ngeneration of long-lived products by cosmic nucleons has been studied for many\ndetector media and for other materials commonly used. Here, the main results\nobtained on the quantification of activation yields on the Earth's surface will\nbe summarized, considering both measurements and calculations following\ndifferent approaches. The isotope production cross sections and the cosmic ray\nspectrum are the two main ingredients when calculating this cosmogenic\nactivation; the different alternatives for implementing them will be discussed.\nActivation that can take place deep underground mainly due to cosmic muons will\nbe briefly commented too. Presently, the experimental results for the\ncosmogenic production of radioisotopes are scarce and discrepancies between\ndifferent calculations are important in many cases, but the increasing interest\non this background source which is becoming more and more relevant can help to\nchange this situation.\n", "  Axion monodromy models can always be described in terms of an axion coupled\nto 3-form gauge fields with non-canonical kinetic terms. The presence of the\nsaxions parametrising the kinetic metrics of the 3-form fields leads to\nbackreaction effects in the inflationary dynamics. We review the case in which\nsaxions backreact on the K\\\"ahler metric of the inflaton leading to a\nlogarithmic scaling of the proper field distance at large field. This behaviour\nis universal in Type II string flux compactifications and consistent with a\nrefinement of the Swampland Conjecture. The critical point at which this\nbehaviour appears depends on the mass hierarchy between the inflaton and the\nsaxions. However, in tractable compactifications, such a hierarchy cannot be\nrealised without leaving the regime of validity of the effective theory,\ndisfavouring transplanckian excursions in string theory.\n", "  {\\it Victory}, i.e. \\underline{vi}enna \\underline{c}omputational\n\\underline{to}ol deposito\\underline{ry}, is a collection of numerical tools for\nsolving the parquet equations for the Hubbard model and similar many body\nproblems. The parquet formalism is a self-consistent theory at both the single-\nand two-particle levels, and can thus describe individual fermions as well as\ntheir collective behavior on equal footing. This is essential for the\nunderstanding of various emergent phases and their transitions in many-body\nsystems, in particular for cases in which a single-particle description fails.\nOur implementation of {\\it victory} is in modern Fortran and it fully respects\nthe structure of various vertex functions in both momentum and Matsubara\nfrequency space. We found the latter to be crucial for the convergence of the\nparquet equations, as well as for the correct determination of various physical\nobservables. In this release, we thoroughly explain the program structure and\nthe controlled approximations to efficiently solve the parquet equations, i.e.\nthe two-level kernel approximation and the high-frequency regulation.\n", "  Magnesium oxide and sulfide spinels have recently attracted interest as\ncathode and electrolyte materials for energy-dense Mg batteries, but their\nobserved electrochemical performance depends strongly on synthesis conditions.\nUsing first principles calculations and percolation theory, we explore the\nextent to which spinel inversion influences Mg$^{2+}$ ionic mobility in\nMgMn$_2$O$_4$ as a prototypical cathode, and MgIn$_2$S$_4$ as a potential solid\nelectrolyte. We find that spinel inversion and the resulting changes of the\nlocal cation ordering give rise to both increased and decreased Mg$^{2+}$\nmigration barriers, along specific migration pathways, in the oxide as well as\nthe sulfide.\n  To quantify the impact of spinel inversion on macroscopic Mg$^{2+}$\ntransport, we determine the percolation thresholds in both MgMn$_2$O$_4$ and\nMgIn$_2$S$_4$. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of inversion on the\nelectrochemical properties of the MgMn$_2$O$_4$ cathode via changes in the\nphase behavior, average Mg insertion voltages and extractable capacities, at\nvarying degrees of inversion. Our results confirm that inversion is a major\nperformance limiting factor of Mg spinels and that synthesis techniques or\ncompositions that stabilize the well-ordered spinel structure are crucial for\nthe success of Mg spinels in multivalent batteries.\n", "  The most powerful tests of stellar models come from the brightest stars in\nthe sky, for which complementary techniques, such as astrometry,\nasteroseismology, spectroscopy, and interferometry can be combined. The K2\nMission is providing a unique opportunity to obtain high-precision photometric\ntime series for bright stars along the ecliptic. However, bright targets\nrequire a large number of pixels to capture the entirety of the stellar flux,\nand bandwidth restrictions limit the number and brightness of stars that can be\nobserved. To overcome this, we have developed a new photometric technique, that\nwe call halo photometry, to observe very bright stars using a limited number of\npixels. Halo photometry is simple, fast and does not require extensive pixel\nallocation, and will allow us to use K2 and other photometric missions, such as\nTESS, to observe very bright stars for asteroseismology and to search for\ntransiting exoplanets. We apply this method to the seven brightest stars in the\nPleiades open cluster. Each star exhibits variability; six of the stars show\nwhat are most-likely slowly pulsating B-star (SPB) pulsations, with amplitudes\nranging from 20 to 2000 ppm. For the star Maia, we demonstrate the utility of\ncombining K2 photometry with spectroscopy and interferometry to show that it is\nnot a 'Maia variable', and to establish that its variability is caused by\nrotational modulation of a large chemical spot on a 10 d time scale.\n", "  Previous studies on the rotation of Sun-like stars revealed that the\nrotational rates of young stars converge towards a well-defined evolution that\nfollows a power-law decay. It seems, however, that some binary stars do not\nobey this relation, often by displaying enhanced rotational rates and activity.\nIn the Solar Twin Planet Search program we observed several solar twin\nbinaries, and found a multiplicity fraction of $42\\% \\pm 6\\%$ in the whole\nsample; moreover, at least three of these binaries (HIP 19911, HIP 67620 and\nHIP 103983) clearly exhibit the aforementioned anomalies. We investigated the\nconfiguration of the binaries in the program, and discovered new companions for\nHIP 6407, HIP 54582, HIP 62039 and HIP 30037, of which the latter is orbited by\na $0.06$ M$_\\odot$ brown dwarf in a 1-month long orbit. We report the orbital\nparameters of the systems with well-sampled orbits and, in addition, the lower\nlimits of parameters for the companions that only display a curvature in their\nradial velocities. For the linear trend binaries, we report an estimate of the\nmasses of their companions when their observed separation is available, and a\nminimum mass otherwise. We conclude that solar twin binaries with low-mass\nstellar companions at moderate orbital periods do not display signs of a\ndistinct rotational evolution when compared to single stars. We confirm that\nthe three peculiar stars are double-lined binaries, and that their companions\nare polluting their spectra, which explains the observed anomalies.\n", "  In a previous work [Dillon and Nakanishi, Eur. Phys.J B {\\bf 87}, 286\n(2014)], we calculated the transmission coefficient of the two-dimensional\nquantum percolation model and found there to be three regimes, namely,\nexponentially localized, power-law localized, and delocalized. However, the\nexistence of these phase transitions remains controversial, with many other\nworks divided between those which claim that quantum percolation in 2D is\nalways localized, and those which assert there is a transition to a less\nlocalized or delocalized state. It stood out that many works based on highly\nanisotropic two-dimensional strips fall in the first group, whereas our\nprevious work and most others in the second group were based on an isotropic\nsquare geometry. To better understand the difference in our results and those\nbased on strip geometry, we apply our direct calculation of the transmission\ncoefficient to highly anisotropic strips of varying widths at three energies\nand a wide range of dilutions. We find that the localization length of the\nstrips does not converge at low dilution as the strip width increases toward\nthe isotropic limit, indicating the presence of a delocalized state for small\ndisorder. We additionally calculate the inverse participation ratio of the\nlattices and find that it too signals a phase transition from delocalized to\nlocalized near the same dilutions.\n", "  We study the environment-assisted enhancement of the excitation-transport\nefficiency across a network of interacting quantum particles or sites. Our\nstudy reveals a crucial influence of the network configuration - and especially\nits degree of connectivity - on the amount of environment-supported\nenhancement. In particular, we find a significant interplay of direct and\nindirect connections between excitation sending and receiving sites. On the\nother hand, the non-Markovianity induced by memory-bearing, finite sized\nenvironments does not seem to provide a critical resource for the enhanced\nexcitation-transport mechanism.\n", "  We review some of the basic concepts and the possible pore structures\nassociated with electroporation (EP) for times after electrical pulsing. We\npurposefully give only a short description of pore creation and subsequent\nevolution of pore populations, as these are adequately discussed in both\nreviews and original research reports. In contrast, post-pulse pore concepts\nhave changed dramatically. For perspective we note that pores are not directly\nobserved. Instead understanding of pores is based on inference from experiments\nand, increasingly, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the past decade\nconcepts for post-pulse pores have changed significantly: The idea of pure\nlipidic transient pores (TPs) that exist for milliseconds or longer post-pulse\nhas become inconsistent with MD results, which support TP lifetimes of only\n$\\sim$100 ns. A typical large TP number during cell EP pulsing is of order\n$10^6$. In twenty MD-based TP lifetimes (2 us total), the TP number plummets to\n$\\sim$0.001. In short, TPs vanish 2 us after a pulse ends, and cannot account\nfor post-pulse behavior such as large and relatively non-specific ionic and\nmolecular transport. Instead, an early conjecture of complex pores (CPs) with\nboth lipidic and other molecule should be taken seriously. Indeed, in the past\ndecade several experiments provide partial support for complex pores (CPs).\nPresently, CPs are \"dark\", in the sense that while some CP functions are known,\nlittle is known about their structure(s). There may be a wide range of\nlifetimes and permeabilities, not yet revealed by experiments. Like cosmology's\ndark matter, these unseen pores present us with an outstanding problem.\n", "  Quark nuggets are theoretical objects composed of approximately equal numbers\nof up, down, and strange quarks and are also called strangelets and\nnuclearites. They have been proposed as a candidate for dark matter, which\nconstitutes about 85% of the universe's mass and which has been a mystery for\ndecades. Previous efforts to detect quark nuggets assumed that the\nnuclear-density core interacts directly with the surrounding matter so the\nstopping power is minimal. Tatsumi found that quark nuggets could well exist as\na ferromagnetic liquid with an approximately 10 trillion Tesla magnetic field.\nWe find that the magnetic field produces a magnetopause with surrounding\nplasma, as the earth's magnetic field produces a magnetopause with the solar\nwind, and substantially increases their energy deposition rate in matter. We\nuse the magnetopause model to compute the energy deposition as a function of\nquark-nugget mass and to analyze testing the quark-nugget hypothesis for dark\nmatter by observations in the air, water, and land. We conclude the water\noption is most promising.\n", "  The evolution of inclination angle and precession damping of radio pulsars is\nconsidered. It is assumed that the neutron star consists of 3 \"freely\" rotating\ncomponents: the crust and two core components, one of which contains pinned\nsuperfluid vortices. We suppose that each component rotates as a rigid body.\nAlso the influence of the small-scale magnetic field on the star's braking\nprocess is examined. Within the framework of this model the star simultaneously\ncan have glitch-like events combined with long-period precession (with periods\n$10-10^{4}$ years). It is shown that the case of the small quantity of pinned\nsuperfluid vortices seems to be more consistent with observations.\n", "  A generic surface in Euclidean 3-space is determined uniquely by its metric\nand curvature. Classification of all special surfaces where this is not the\ncase, i.e. of surfaces possessing isometries which preserve the mean curvature,\nis known as the Bonnet problem. Regarding the Bonnet problem, we show how\nanalytic methods of the theory of integrable systems\n  -- such as finite-gap integration, isomonodromic deformation, and loop group\ndescription -- can be applied for studying global properties of special\nsurfaces.\n  This paper presents the contents of the lectures given at the School on\n  Differential Geometry on 12-30 April 1999 at the Abdus Salam International\n  Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste.\n", "  A discrete analogue of the holomorphic map z^a is studied. It is given by a\nSchramm's circle pattern with the combinatorics of the square grid. It is shown\nthat the corresponding immersed circle patterns lead to special separatrix\nsolutions of a discrete Painleve equation. Global properties of these\nsolutions, as well as of the discrete $z^a$ are established.\n"]}
