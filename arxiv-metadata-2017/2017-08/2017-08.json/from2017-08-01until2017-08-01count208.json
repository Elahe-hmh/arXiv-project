Our other\nmain results include a new proof of the lower bound of (d^2-1)^2+1 on the\nnumber of unitaries in a 2-design [Gross et al.], which lends itself to a\ngeneralization to approximate 2-design.\n  Furthermore, while in prime power dimension there is a unitary 2-design with\n=< d^5 elements, we show that there are always approximate 2-designs with\nO(epsilon^{-2} d^4 log d) elements.\n", "  The circumstances under which a system reaches thermal equilibrium, and how\nto derive this from basic dynamical laws, has been a major question from the\nvery beginning of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Despite\nconsiderable progress, it remains an open problem. Motivated by this issue, we\naddress the more general question of equilibration. We prove, with virtually\nfull generality, that reaching equilibrium is a universal property of quantum\nsystems: Almost any subsystem in interaction with a large enough bath will\nreach an equilibrium state and remain close to it for almost all times. We also\nprove several general results about other aspects of thermalisation besides\nequilibration, for example, that the equilibrium state does not depend on the\ndetailed micro-state of the bath.\n", "  Recently there has been considerable activity on the subject of additivity of\nvarious quantum channel capacities. Here, we construct a family of channels\nwith sharply bounded classical, hence private capacity. On the other hand,\ntheir quantum capacity when combined with a zero private (and zero quantum)\ncapacity erasure channel, becomes larger than the previous classical capacity.\n  As a consequence, we can conclude for the first time that the classical\nprivate capacity is non-additive. In fact, in our construction even the quantum\ncapacity of the tensor product of two channels can be greater than the sum of\ntheir individual classical private capacities.\n  We show that this violation occurs quite generically: every channel can be\nembedded into our construction, and a violation occurs whenever the given\nchannel has larger entanglement assisted quantum capacity than (unassisted)\nclassical capacity.\n", "  We study the speed of fluctuation of a quantum system around its\nthermodynamic equilibrium state, and show that the speed will be extremely\nsmall for almost all times in typical thermodynamic cases. The setting\nconsidered here is that of a quantum system couples to a bath, both jointly\ndescribed as a closed system. This setting, is the same as the one considered\nin [N. Linden et al., Phys. Rev. E 79:061103 (2009)] and the ``thermodynamic\nequilibrium state'' refers to a situation that includes the usual thermodynamic\nequilibrium case, as well as far more general situations.\n", "  In this article we study the phase transition phenomenon for the Ising model\nunder the action of a non-uniform external magnetic field. We show that the\nIsing model on the hypercubic lattice with a summable magnetic field has a\nfirst-order phase transition and, for any positive (resp. negative) and bounded\nmagnetic field, the model does not present the phase transition phenomenon\nwhenever $\\liminf h_i> 0$, where ${\\bf h} = (h_i)_{i \\in \\Z^d}$ is the external\nmagnetic field.\n", "  We discuss the potential and limitations of Gaussian cluster states for\nmeasurement-based quantum computing. Using a framework of Gaussian projected\nentangled pair states (GPEPS), we show that no matter what Gaussian local\nmeasurements are performed on systems distributed on a general graph, transport\nand processing of quantum information is not possible beyond a certain\ninfluence region, except for exponentially suppressed corrections. We also\ndemonstrate that even under arbitrary non-Gaussian local measurements, slabs of\nGaussian cluster states of a finite width cannot carry logical quantum\ninformation, even if sophisticated encodings of qubits in continuous-variable\n(CV) systems are allowed for. This is proven by suitably contracting tensor\nnetworks representing infinite-dimensional quantum systems. The result can be\nseen as sharpening the requirements for quantum error correction and fault\ntolerance for Gaussian cluster states, and points towards the necessity of\nnon-Gaussian resource states for measurement-based quantum computing. The\nresults can equally be viewed as referring to Gaussian quantum repeater\nnetworks.\n", "  A search for large extra spatial dimensions via virtual-graviton exchange in\nthe diphoton channel has been carried out with the CMS detector at the LHC. No\nexcess of events above the standard model expectations is found using a data\nsample collected in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 inverse picobarns. New lower\nlimits on the effective Planck scale in the range of 1.6-2.3 TeV at the 95%\nconfidence level are set, providing the most restrictive bounds to date on\nmodels with more than two large extra dimensions.\n", "  A first measurement of the polarization of W bosons with large transverse\nmomenta in pp collisions is presented. The measurement is based on 36 inverse\npicobarns of data recorded at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC.\nThe left-handed, right-handed and longitudinal polarization fractions (f_L,\nf_R, f_0) of W bosons with transverse momenta larger than 50 GeV are determined\nusing decays to both electrons and muons. The muon final state yields the most\nprecise measurement, (f_L - f_R) = 0.240 +/- 0.036 (stat.) +/- 0.031 (syst.)\nand f_0 = 0.183 +/- 0.087 (stat.) +/- 0.123 (syst.) for negatively charged W\nbosons, and (f_L - f_R) = 0.310 +/- 0.036 (stat.) +/- 0.017 (syst.) and f_0 =\n0.171 +/- 0.085 (stat.) +/- 0.099 (syst.) for positively charged W bosons. This\nestablishes, for the first time, that W bosons produced in pp collisions with\nlarge transverse momenta are predominantly left-handed, as expected in the\nstandard model.\n", "  Both e+e- and {\\mu}+{\\mu}- colliders have been proposed as possible\ncandidates for a lepton collider to complement and extend the reach of the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The physics program that could be pursued\nby a new lepton collider (e+e- or {\\mu}+{\\mu}-) with sufficient luminosity\nwould include understanding the mechanism behind mass generation and\nelectroweak symmetry breaking; searching for, and possibly discovering,\nsupersymmetric particles; and hunting for signs of extra spacetime dimensions\nand quantum gravity. However, the appropriate energy reach for such a collider\nis currently unknown, and will only be determined following initial physics\nresults at the LHC. It is entirely possible that such results will indicate\nthat a lepton collider with a collision energy well in excess of 1 TeV will be\nrequired to illuminate the physics uncovered at LHC. Such a requirement would\nrequire consideration of muons as the lepton of choice for such a collider.\n", "  These lectures are intended for graduate students who want to acquire a\nworking knowledge of path integral methods in a wide variety of fields in\nphysics. In general the presentation is elementary and path integrals are\ndeveloped in the usual heuristic, non-mathematical way for application in many\ndiverse problems in quantum physics. Three main parts deal with path integrals\nin non-relativistic quantum mechanics, many-body physics and field theory and\ncontain standard examples (quadratic Lagrangians, tunneling, description of\nbosons and fermions, quantization of gauge theories etc.) as well as\nspecialized topics (scattering, dissipative systems, spin \\& color in the path\nintegral, lattice methods etc.). In each part simple Fortran programs which can\nbe run on a PC, illustrate the numerical evaluation of (Euclidean) path\nintegrals by Monte-Carlo or variational methods. Also included are the set of\nproblems which accompanied the lectures and their solutions.\n", "  We study the polytropic gas scenario as the unification of dark matter and\ndark energy. We fit the model parameters by using the latest observational data\nincluding type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave\nbackground, and Hubble parameter data. At 68.3% and 95.4% confidence levels, we\nfind the best fit values of the model parameters as\n$\\tilde{K}=0.742_{-0.024}^{+0.024}(1\\sigma)_{-0.049}^{+0.048}(2\\sigma)$ and\n$n=-1.05_{-0.08}^{+0.08}(1\\sigma)_{-0.16}^{+0.15}(2\\sigma)$. Using the best fit\nvalues of the model, we obtain the evolutionary behaviors of the equation of\nstate parameters of the polytropic gas model and dark energy, the deceleration\nparameter of the universe as well as the dimensionless density parameters of\ndark matter and dark energy. We conclude that in this model, the universe\nstarts from the matter dominated epoch and approaches a de Sitter phase at late\ntimes, as expected. Also the universe begins to accelerate at redshift $z_{\\rm\nt}=0.74$. Furthermore in contrary to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, the cosmic\ncoincidence problem is solved naturally in the polytropic gas scenario.\n", "  In a previous paper \\cite{MTAY1} we have shown that Newton'n third law cannot\nstrictly hold in a distributed system of which the different parts are at a\nfinite distance from each other. This is due to the finite speed of signal\npropagation which cannot exceed the speed of light at vacuum, which in turn\nmeans that when summing the total force in the system the force does not add up\nto zero. This was demonstrated in a specific example of two current loops with\ntime dependent currents, the above analysis led to suggestion of a relativistic\nengine \\cite{MTAY3,AY1}. Since the system is effected by a total force for a\nfinite period of time this means that the system acquires mechanical momentum\nand energy, the question then arises if we need to abandon the law of momentum\nand energy conservation. The subject of momentum conversation was discussed in\n\\cite{MTAY4}. Here some preliminary aspects of the exchange of energy between\nthe mechanical part of the relativistic engine and the electromagnetic field\nare discussed. We also refer briefly to the material composition, structure and\nproperties of metals that should be used in a relativistic engine.\n", "  Novae, which are the sudden visual brightening triggered by runaway\nthermonuclear burning on the surface of an accreting white dwarf, are fairly\ncommon and bright events. Despite their astronomical significance as nearby\nlaboratories for the study of nuclear burning and accretion phenomena, many\naspects of these common stellar explosions are observationally not\nwell-constrained and remain poorly understood. Radio observations, modeling and\ninterpretation can potentially play a crucial role in addressing some of these\npuzzling issues. In this review on radio studies of novae, we focus on the\npossibility of testing and improving the nova models with radio observations,\nand present a current status report on the progress in both the observational\nfront and theoretical developments. We specifically address the issues of\naccurate estimation of ejecta mass, multi-phase and complex ejection phenomena,\nand the effect of a dense environment around novae. With highlights of new\nobservational results, we illustrate how radio observations can shed light on\nsome of these long-standing puzzles.\n", "  The Ashtekar and Ashtekar-Barbero connection variable formulations of Kerr\nisolated horizons are derived. Using a regular Kinnersley tetrad in\nhorizon-penetrating Kruskal-Szekeres-like coordinates, the spin coefficients of\nKerr geometry are determined by solving the first Maurer-Cartan equation of\nstructure. Isolated horizon conditions are imposed on the tetrad and the spin\ncoefficients. A transformation into an orthonormal tetrad frame that is fixed\nin the time gauge is applied and explicit calculations of the spin connection,\nthe Ashtekar and Ashtekar-Barbero connections, and the corresponding curvatures\non the horizon 2-spheres are performed. Since the resulting Ashtekar-Barbero\ncurvature does not comply with the simple form of the horizon boundary\ncondition of Schwarzschild isolated horizons, i.e., on the horizon 2-spheres,\nthe Ashtekar-Barbero curvature is not proportional to the Plebanski 2-form,\nwhich is required for an SU(2) Chern-Simons treatment of the gauge degrees of\nfreedom in the horizon boundary in the context of loop quantum gravity, a\ngeneral method to construct a new connection whose curvature satisfies such a\nrelation for Kerr isolated horizons is introduced. For the purpose of\nillustration, this method is employed in the framework of slowly rotating Kerr\nisolated horizons.\n", "  We apply the Wigner formalism of quantum optics to study the role of the\nzeropoint field fluctuations in entanglement swapping produced via parametric\ndown conversion. It is shown that the generation of mode entanglement between\ntwo initially non interacting photons is related to the quadruple correlation\nproperties of the electromagnetic field, through the stochastic properties of\nthe vacuum. The relationship between the process of transferring entanglement\nand the different zeropoint inputs at the nonlinear crystal and the Bell-state\nanalyser is emphasized.\n", "  The well-known issue with the absence of conservation of angular momentum in\nclassical particle systems with periodic boundary conditions is addressed. It\nis shown that conventional theory based on Noether's theorem fails to explain\nthe simplest possible example, notably jumps of angular momentum in the case of\nsingle particle moving in a periodic cell. It is suggested to consider the\nperiodic cell as an open system, exchanging mass, momentum, angular momentum,\nand energy with surrounding cells. Then the behavior of the cell is described\nby balance laws rather than conservation laws. It is shown using the law of\nangular momentum balance that the variation of the angular momentum in systems\nwith periodic boundary conditions is a consequence of (i) the non-zero flux of\nangular momentum through the boundaries and (ii) torque acting on the cell due\nto the interactions between particles in the cell with images in the\nneighboring cells. Two simple examples demonstrating both phenomena are\npresented.\n", "  We present a quantum algorithm for fitting a linear regression model to a\ngiven data set using the least squares approach. Different from previous\nalgorithms which yield a quantum state encoding the optimal parameters, our\nalgorithm outputs these numbers in the classical form. So by running it once,\none completely determines the fitted model and then can use it to make\npredictions on new data at little cost. Moreover, our algorithm works in the\nstandard oracle model, and can handle data sets with nonsparse design matrices.\nIt runs in time $\\operatorname{poly}(\\operatorname{log}(N), d, \\kappa,\n1/\\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the size of the data set, $d$ is the number of\nadjustable parameters, $\\kappa$ is the condition number of the design matrix,\nand $\\epsilon$ is the desired precision in the output. We also show that the\npolynomial dependence on $d$ and $\\kappa$ is necessary. Thus, our algorithm\ncannot be significantly improved. Furthermore, we also give a quantum algorithm\nthat estimates the quality of the least-squares fit (without computing its\nparameters explicitly). This algorithm runs faster than the one for finding\nthis fit, and can be used to check whether the given data set qualifies for\nlinear regression in the first place.\n", "  The question of which non-interacting Green's function \"best\" describes an\ninteracting many-body electronic system is both of fundamental interest as well\nas of practical importance in describing electronic properties of materials in\na realistic manner. Here, we study this question within the framework of\nBaym-Kadanoff theory, an approach where one locates the stationary point of a\ntotal energy functional of the one-particle Green's function in order to find\nthe total ground-state energy as well as all one-particle properties such as\nthe density matrix, chemical potential, or the quasiparticle energy spectrum\nand quasiparticle wave functions. For the case of the Klein functional, our\nbasic finding is that minimizing the length of the gradient of the total energy\nfunctional over non-interacting Green's functions yields a set of\nself-consistent equations for quasiparticles that is identical to those of the\nQuasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) [1] approach, thereby providing an a\npriori justification for such an approach to electronic structure calculations.\nIn fact, this result is general, applies to any self-energy operator, and is\nnot restricted to any particular approximation, e.g. the GW approximation for\nthe self-energy. The approach also shows that, when working in the basis of\nquasiparticle states, solving the diagonal part of the self-consistent Dyson\nequation is of primary importance while the off-diagonals are of secondary\nimportance, a common observation in the electronic structure literature of\nself-energy calculations. Finally, numerical tests and analytical arguments\nshow that when the Dyson equation produces multiple quasiparticle solutions\ncorresponding to a single non-interacting state, minimizing the length of the\ngradient translates into choosing the solution with largest quasiparticle\nweight.\n", "  Recent experiments reveal a significant increase in the graphene Fermi\nvelocity close to charge neutrality. This has widely been interpreted as a\nconfirmation of the logarithmic divergence of the graphene Fermi velocity\npredicted by a perturbative approach. In this work, we reconsider this problem\nusing functional bosonization techniques calculating the effects of electron\ninteractions on the density of states non-perturbatively. We find that the\nrenormalized velocity is {\\it finite} and independent of the high energy\ncut-off, and we argue that the experimental observations are better understood\nin terms of an anomalous dimension. Our results also represent a bosonized\nsolution for interacting Weyl fermions in (2+1) dimensions at half-filing.\n", "  The control of individual quantum systems is now a reality in a variety of\nphysical settings. Feedback control is an important class of control methods\nbecause of its ability to reduce the effects of noise. In this review we give\nan introductory overview of the various ways in which feedback may be\nimplemented in quantum systems, the theoretical methods that are currently used\nto treat it, the experiments in which it has been demonstrated to-date, and its\napplications. In the last few years there has been rapid experimental progress\nin the ability to realize quantum measurement and control of mesoscopic\nsystems. We expect that the next few years will see further rapid advances in\nthe precision and sophistication of feedback control protocols realized in the\nlaboratory.\n", "  This paper discusses how the transactional interpretation of quantum\nmechanics can provide for a natural account of the emergence of spacetime\nevents from a quantum substratum. In this account, spacetime is not a\nsubstantive manifold that becomes occupied with events; rather, spacetime\nitself exists only in virtue of specific actualized events. This implies that\nspacetime is discrete rather than continuous, and that properties attributed to\nspacetime based on the notion of a continuum are idealizations that do not\napply to the real physical world. It is further noted that the transactional\npicture of the emergence of spacetime can provide the quantum dynamics that\nunderlie the causal set approach as proposed by Sorkin and others.\n", "  A family of information theoretic models of communication was introduced more\nthan a decade ago to explain the origins of Zipf's law for word frequencies.\nThe family is a based on a combination of two information theoretic principles:\nmaximization of mutual information between forms and meanings and minimization\nof form entropy. The family also sheds light on the origins of three other\npatterns: the principle of contrast, a related vocabulary learning bias and the\nmeaning-frequency law. Here two important components of the family, namely the\ninformation theoretic principles and the energy function that combines them\nlinearly, are reviewed from the perspective of psycholinguistics, language\nlearning, information theory and synergetic linguistics. The minimization of\nthis linear function is linked to the problem of compression of standard\ninformation theory and might be tuned by self-organization.\n", "  It is shown that the initial conditions in the quasi-Heisenberg quantization\nscheme can be set at the initial cosmological singularity per se. This\npossibility is provided by finiteness of some quantities, namely momentums of\nthe dynamical variables, at a singularity, in spite of infinity of the\ndynamical variables themselves. The uncertainty principle allows avoiding a\nnecessity to set values of the dynamical variables at singularity, as a wave\npacket can be expressed through the finite momentums. Influence of the initial\ncondition set in the singularity in such a way to a number of gravitons under a\nvacuum state, arising during later evolution, is investigated. It is shown\nthat, even choosing of some special state at the singularity minimizing late\ntime expansion rate, some amount of gravitons still appear in the late time\nevolution.\n", "  In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the construction of a proper\nmeasure of quantum non-Markovianity. However, those proposed measures are shown\nto be at variance with different situations. In this work, we utilize the\ntheory of $k$-positive maps to generalize a hierarchy of $k$-divisibility and\ndevelop a powerful tool, called $k$-divisibility phase diagram, which can\nprovide a further insight into the nature of quantum non-Markovianity. By\nexploring the phase diagram with several paradigms, we can explain the origin\nof the discrepancy between two frequently used measures and find the condition\nunder which the two measures coincide with each other.\n", "  In a finite dimensional Hilbert space, each normalized vector (state) can be\nchosen as a member of an orthonormal basis of the space. We give a proof of\nthis statement in a manner that seems to be more comprehensible for physics\nstudents than the formal abstract one.\n", "  The principle of non-violation of \"information causality\", has been proposed\nas one of the foundational properties of nature\\cite{nature}. The main goal of\nthe paper is to explore the gap between quantum mechanical correlations and\nthose allowed by \"information causality\" in the context of local randomness by\nusing Cabello's nonlocality argument. This is interesting because the gap is\nslightly different than in the context of Hardy's similar nonlocality\nargument\\cite{gazi}\n", "  We treat the eigenvalue problem posed by self-similar potentials, i.e.\nhomogeneous functions under a particular affine transformation, by means of\nsymmetry techniques. We find that the eigenfunctions of such problems are\nlocalized, even when the potential does not rise to infinity in every\ndirection. It is shown that the logarithm of the energy displays levels\ncontained in families that are analogous to Wannier-Stark ladders. The position\nof each ladder is proved to be determined by the specific details of the\npotential and not by its transformation properties. This is done by direct\ncomputation of matrix elements. The results are compared with numerical\nsolutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  Dynamic buckling of an elastic column under compression at constant speed is\ninvestigated assuming the first-mode buckling. Two cases are considered: (i) an\nimperfect column (Hoff's statement), and (ii) a perfect column having an\ninitial lateral deflection. The range of parameters, where the maximum load\nsupported by a column exceeds Euler static force is determined. In this range,\nthe maximum load is represented as a function of the compression rate,\nslenderness ratio, and imperfection/initial deflection. Considering the results\nwe answer the following question: \"How slowly the column should be compressed\nin order to measure static load-bearing capacity?\" This question is important\nfor the proper setup of laboratory experiments and computer simulations of\nbuckling.\n  Additionally, it is shown that the behavior of a perfect column having an\ninitial deflection differ significantlys form the behavior of an imperfect\ncolumn. In particular, the dependence of the maximum force on the compression\nrate is non-monotonic. The analytical results are supported by numerical\nsimulations and available experimental data.\n", "  Recently the Ruelle-Perron-Fr\\\"obenius theorem was proved for H\\\"older\npotentials defined on the symbolic space $\\Omega=M^{\\mathbb{N}}$, where (the\nalphabet) $M$ is any compact metric space. In this paper, we extend this\ntheorem to the Walters space $W(\\Omega)$, in similar general alphabets. We also\ndescribe in detail an abstract procedure to obtain the Fr\\'echet-analyticity of\nthe Ruelle operator under quite general conditions and we apply this result to\nprove the analytic dependence of this operator on both Walters and H\\\"older\nspaces. The analyticity of the pressure functional on H\\\"older spaces is\nestablished. An exponential decay of the correlations is shown when the Ruelle\noperator has the spectral gap property.\n  A new (and natural) family of Walters potentials (on a finite alphabet\nderived from the Ising model) not having an exponential decay of the\ncorrelations is presented. Because of the lack of exponential decay, for such\npotentials we have the absence of the spectral gap for the Ruelle operator. The\nkey idea to prove the lack of exponential decay of the correlations are the\nGriffiths-Kelly-Sherman inequalities.\n", "  The method of non-Riemannian (metric-independent) spacetime volume-forms\n(alternative generally-covariant integration measure densities) is applied to\nconstruct a modified model of gravity coupled to a single scalar field\nproviding an explicit unification of dark energy (as a dynamically generated\ncosmological constant) and dust fluid dark matter flowing along geodesics as an\nexact sum of two separate terms in the scalar field energy-momentum tensor. The\nfundamental reason for the dark species unification is the presence of a\nnon-Riemannian volume-form in the scalar field action which both triggers the\ndynamical generation of the cosmological constant as well as gives rise to a\nhidden nonlinear Noether symmetry underlying the dust dark matter fluid nature.\nUpon adding appropriate perturbation breaking the hidden \"dust\" Noether\nsymmetry we preserve the geodesic flow property of the dark matter while we\nsuggest a way to get growing dark energy in the present universe' epoch free of\nevolution pathologies. Also, an intrinsic relation between the above modified\ngravity + single scalar field model and a special quadratic purely kinetic\n\"k-essence\" model is established as a weak-versus-strong-coupling duality.\n", "  We study the enumeration of diagonally and antidiagonally symmetric\nalternating sign matrices (DASASMs) of fixed odd order by introducing a case of\nthe six-vertex model whose configurations are in bijection with such matrices.\nThe model involves a grid graph on a triangle, with bulk and boundary weights\nwhich satisfy the Yang-Baxter and reflection equations. We obtain a general\nexpression for the partition function of this model as a sum of two\ndeterminantal terms, and show that at a certain point each of these terms\nreduces to a Schur function. We are then able to prove a conjecture of Robbins\nfrom the mid 1980's that the total number of $(2n+1)\\times(2n+1)$ DASASMs is\n$\\prod_{i=0}^n\\frac{(3i)!}{(n+i)!}$, and a conjecture of Stroganov from 2008\nthat the ratio between the numbers of $(2n+1)\\times(2n+1)$ DASASMs with central\nentry $-1$ and $1$ is $n/(n+1)$. Among the several product formulae for the\nenumeration of symmetric alternating sign matrices which were conjectured in\nthe 1980's, that for odd-order DASASMs is the last to have been proved.\n", "  The original formulation of the \"Einstein-Rosen bridge\" in the classic paper\nof Einstein and Rosen (1935) is historically the first example of a static\nspherically-symmetric wormhole solution. It is not equivalent to the concept of\nthe dynamical and non-traversable Schwarzschild wormhole, also called\n\"Einstein-Rosen bridge\" in modern textbooks on general relativity. In previous\npapers of ours we have provided a mathematically correct treatment of the\noriginal \"Einstein-Rosen bridge\" as a traversable wormhole by showing that it\nrequires the presence of a special kind of \"exotic matter\" located on the\nwormhole throat - a lightlike brane (the latter was overlooked in the original\n1935 paper). In the present note we continue our thorough study of the original\n\"Einstein-Rosen bridge\" as a simplest example of a lightlike thin-shell\nwormhole by explicitly deriving its description in terms of the Kruskal-Penrose\nformalism for maximal analytic extension of the underlying wormhole spacetime\nmanifold. Further, we generalize the Kruskal-Penrose description to the case of\nmore complicated lightlike thin-shell wormholes with two throats exhibiting a\nremarkable property of QCD-like charge confinement.\n", "  The ATLAS report in August 2016 provided an upper limit for the $pp\\to$\ndiboson and $t\\bar t$ cross sections. We consider a pseudoscalar-mediated\nfermionic dark matter together with gluon and photon effective operators\ninteracting with the pseudoscalar. Choosing the resonance mass being\n$m_\\rho=200, 750$ GeV and $2$ TeV, beside the relic density and the invisible\nHiggs decay constraints we constrain more the space of parameters with the\ndiboson and $t\\bar t$ cross section upper bounds. We finally provide some\nbenchmarks consistent with all the constraints. Having exploited a pseudoscalar\nmediator, the DM-nucleon cross section is velocity suppressed so that the model\nevades easily the bounds put by the future direct detection experiments such as\nXENON1T.\n", "  We consider a quantum Otto refrigerator cycle of a time-dependent harmonic\noscillator. We investigate the coefficient of performance at maximum figure of\nmerit for adiabatic and nonadiabatic frequency modulations. We obtain\nanalytical expressions for the optimal performance both in the high-temperature\n(classical) regime and in the low-temperature (quantum) limit. We moreover\nanalyze the breakdown of the cooling cycle for strongly nonadiabatic driving\nprotocols and derive analytical estimates for the minimal driving time allowed\nfor cooling.\n", "  Quantum phase slips are the primary excitations in one-dimensional\nsuperfluids and superconductors at low temperatures but their existence in\nultracold quantum gases has not been demonstrated yet. We now study\nexperimentally the nucleation rate of phase slips in one-dimensional\nsuperfluids realized with ultracold quantum gases, owing along a periodic\npotential. We observe a crossover between a regime of temperature-dependent\ndissipation at small velocity and interaction and a second regime of\nvelocity-dependent dissipation at larger velocity and interaction. This\nbehavior is consistent with the predicted crossover from thermally-assisted\nquantum phase slips to purely quantum phase slips.\n", "  For isotropic fluids, classical nucleation theory predicts the nucleation\nrate, barrier height and critical droplet size by accounting for the\ncompetition between bulk energy and interfacial tension. The nucleation process\nin liquid crystals is less understood. We numerically investigate nucleation in\nmonolayered nematogenic films using a mesoscopic framework, in particular, we\nstudy the mor- phology and kinetic pathway in spontaneous formation and growth\nof droplets of the stable phase in the metastable background. The parameter\n$\\kappa$ that quantifies the anisotropic elastic energy plays a central role in\ndetermining the geometric structure of the droplets. Noncircular nematic\ndroplets with homogeneous director orientation are nucleated in a background of\nsupercooled isotropic phase for small $\\kappa$. For large $\\kappa$, noncircular\ndroplets with integer topological charge, accompanied by a biaxial ring at the\nouter surface, are nucleated. The isotropic droplet shape in a superheated\nnematic background is found to depend on $\\kappa$ in a similar way. Identical\ngrowth laws are found in the two cases, although an unusual two-stage mechanism\nis observed in the nucleation of isotropic droplets. Temporal distributions of\nsuccessive events indicate the relevance of long-ranged elasticity-mediated\ninteractions within the isotropic domains. Implications for a theoretical\ndescription of nucleation in anisotropic fluids are discussed.\n", "  Multimode fibres (MMFs) are attracting interest for complex spatiotemporal\ndynamics, and for ultrafast fibre sources, imaging and telecommunications. This\nnew interest is based on three key properties: their high spatiotemporal\ncomplexity (information capacity), the important role of disorder, and complex\nintermodal interactions. To date, phenomena in MMFs have been studied only in\nlimiting cases where one or more of these properties can be neglected. Here we\nstudy MMFs in a regime in which all these elements are integral. We observe a\nspatial beam-cleaning process preceding spatiotemporal modulation instability.\nWe show that the origin of these processes is a universal unstable attractor in\ngraded-index MMFs. Both the self-organization of the attractor, as well as its\ninstability, are caused by intermodal interactions characterized by cooperating\ndisorder, nonlinearity and dissipation. The demonstration of a\ndisorder-enhanced nonlinear process in MMF has important implications for\ntelecommunications, and the multifaceted complexity of the dynamics showcases\nMM waveguides as ideal laboratories for many topics and applications in\ncomplexity science.\n", "  The ability to manipulate the spectral-temporal waveform of optical pulses\nhas enabled a wide range of applications from ultrafast spectroscopy to\nhigh-speed communications. Extending these concepts to quantum light has the\npotential to enable breakthroughs in optical quantum science and technology.\nHowever, filtering and amplifying often employed in classical pulse shaping\ntechniques are incompatible with non-classical light. Controlling the pulsed\nmode structure of quantum light requires efficient means to achieve\ndeterministic, unitary manipulation that preserves fragile quantum coherences.\nHere we demonstrate an electro-optic method for modifying the spectrum of\nnon-classical light by employing a time lens. In particular we show\nhighly-efficient wavelength-preserving six-fold compression of single-photon\nspectral intensity bandwidth, enabling over a two-fold increase of\nsingle-photon flux into a spectrally narrowband absorber. These results pave\nthe way towards spectral-temporal photonic quantum information processing and\nfacilitate interfacing of different physical platforms where quantum\ninformation can be stored or manipulated.\n", "  Both hydrodynamics-based models and a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model can\nreproduce the mass splitting of azimuthal anisotropy ($v_n$) at low transverse\nmomentum ($p_{\\perp}$) as observed in heavy ion collisions. In the AMPT model,\nhowever, $v_n$ is mainly generated by the parton escape mechanism, not by the\nhydrodynamic flow. In this study we provide detailed results on the mass\nsplitting of $v_n$ in this transport model, including $v_2$ and $v_3$ of\nvarious hadron species in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider and p+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We show that the\nmass splitting of hadron $v_2$ and $v_3$ in AMPT first arises from the\nkinematics in the quark coalescence hadronization process, and then, more\ndominantly, comes from hadronic rescatterings, even though the contribution\nfrom the latter to the overall charged hadron $v_n$ is small. We further show\nthat there is no qualitative difference between heavy ion collisions and\nsmall-system collisions or between elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$)\nanisotropies. Our studies thus demonstrate that the mass splitting of $v_2$ and\n$v_3$ at low-$p_{\\perp}$ is not a unique signature of hydrodynamic collective\nflow but can be the interplay of several physics effects.\n", "  Turbulence is argued to play a crucial role in cloud droplet growth. The\ncombined problem of turbulence and cloud droplet growth is numerically\nchallenging. Here, an Eulerian scheme based on the Smoluchowski equation is\ncompared with two Lagrangian superparticle (or su- perdroplet) schemes in the\npresence of condensation and collection. The growth processes are studied\neither separately or in combination using either two-dimensional turbulence, a\nsteady flow, or just gravitational acceleration without gas flow. Good\nagreement between the differ- ent schemes for the time evolution of the size\nspectra is observed in the presence of gravity or turbulence. Higher moments of\nthe size spectra are found to be a useful tool to characterize the growth of\nthe largest drops through collection. Remarkably, the tails of the size spectra\nare reasonably well described by a gamma distribution in cases with gravity or\nturbulence. The Lagrangian schemes are generally found to be superior over the\nEulerian one in terms of computational performance. However, it is shown that\nthe use of interpolation schemes such as the cloud-in-cell algorithm is\ndetrimental in connection with superparticle or superdroplet approaches.\nFurthermore, the use of symmetric over asymmetric collection schemes is shown\nto reduce the amount of scatter in the results.\n", "  In this paper, first we modify the definition of a Hom-Lie algebroid\nintroduced by Laurent-Gengoux and Teles and give its equivalent dual\ndescription. Many results that parallel to Lie algebroids are given. In\nparticular, we give the notion of a Hom-Poisson manifold and show that there is\na Hom-Lie algebroid structure on the pullback of the cotangent bundle of a\nHom-Poisson manifold. Then we give the notion of a Hom-Lie bialgebroid, which\nis a natural generalization of a purely Hom-Lie bialgebra and a Lie\nbialgebroid. We show that the base manifold of a Hom-Lie bialgebroid is a\nHom-Poisson manifold. Finally, we introduce the notion of a Hom-Courant\nalgebroid and show that the double of a Hom-Lie bialgebroid is a Hom-Courant\nalgebroid. The underlying algebraic structure of a Hom-Courant algebroid is a\nHom-Leibniz algebra, or a Hom-Lie 2-algebra.\n", "  We compare the performance of continuous coherent feedback, implemented using\nan ideal single-qubit controller, to that of continuous measurement-based\nfeedback for the task of controlling the state of a single qubit. Here the\nbasic dynamical resource is the ability to couple the system to a\ntraveling-wave field (for example, a transmission line) via a system\nobservable, and the fundamental limitation is the maximum rate that is\navailable for this coupling. We focus on the question of the best achievable\ncontrol given ideal controllers. To obtain a fair comparison we acknowledge\nthat the amplification involved in measurement-based control allows the\ncontroller to use macroscopic fields to apply feedback forces to the system, so\nit is natural to allow these feedback forces to be much larger than the\nmesoscopic coupling to the transmission line that mediates both the measurement\nfor measurement-based control and the coupling to the mesoscopic controller for\ncoherent control. Interestingly our numerical results indicate that under the\nabove platform for comparison, coherent feedback is able to exactly match the\nperformance of measurement-based feedback given ideal controllers. We also\ndiscuss various properties of, and control mechanisms for, coherent feedback\nnetworks.\n", "  Results of theoretical studies of the quantum unstable systems caused that\nthere are rather widespread belief that a universal feature od the quantum\ndecay process is the presence of three time regimes of the decay process: the\nearly time (initial) leading to the Quantum Zeno (or Anti Zeno) Effects,\n\"exponential\" (or \"canonical\") described by the decay law of the exponential\nform, and late time characterized by the decay law having inverse--power law\nform. Based on the fundamental principles of the quantum theory we give the\nproof that there is no time interval in which the survival probability (decay\nlaw) could be a decreasing function of time of the purely exponential form but\neven at the \"exponential\" regime the decay curve is oscillatory modulated with\na smaller or a large amplitude of oscillations depending on parameters of the\nmodel considered.\n", "  We show how the equations for the scalar field (including the massive,\nmassless, minimally and conformally coupled cases) on de Sitter and Anti-de\nSitter spaces can be obtained from both the SO$(2,4)$-invariant equation\n$\\square \\phi = 0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^6$ and two geometrical constraints defining\nthe (A)dS space. Apart from the equation in $\\mathbb{R}^6$, the results only\nfollow from the geometry. We also show how an interaction term in (A)dS space\ncan be taken into account from $\\mathbb{R}^6$.\n", "  In non-relativistic systems, when there is spontaneous symmetry breaking, the\nnumber of Nambu-Goldstone bosons ($n_{NG}$) are not necessarily equal to the\nnumber of broken generators ($n_{BG}$). Here we use the method of operators for\nanalyzing the necessary conditions in order to obtain the correct dispersion\nrelation for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons.\n", "  Faddeev formulation of general relativity (GR) is considered where the metric\nis composed of ten vector fields or a ten-dimensional tetrad. Upon partial use\nof the field equations, this theory results in the usual GR. Earlier we have\nproposed first-order representation of the minisuperspace model for the Faddeev\nformulation where the tetrad fields are piecewise constant on the polytopes\nlike 4-simplices or, say, cuboids into which ${\\rm R}^4$ can be decomposed, an\nanalogue of the Cartan-Weyl connection-type form of the Hilbert-Einstein action\nin the usual continuum GR. In the Hamiltonian formalism, the tetrad bilinears\nare canonically conjugate to the orthogonal connection matrices. We evaluate\nthe spectrum of the elementary areas, functions of the tetrad bilinears. The\nspectrum is discrete and proportional to the Faddeev analog $\\gamma_{\\rm F}$ of\nthe Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\\gamma$. The possibility of the tetrad and\nmetric discontinuities in the Faddeev gravity allows to consider any surface as\nconsisting of a set of virtually independent elementary areas and its spectrum\nbeing the sum of the elementary spectra. Requiring consistency of the black\nhole entropy calculations known in the literature we are able to estimate\n$\\gamma_{\\rm F}$.\n", "  A quantum spin liquid is an exotic quantum state of matter in which spins are\nhighly entangled and remain disordered down to zero temperature. Such a state\nof matter is potentially relevant to high-temperature superconductivity and\nquantum-information applications, and experimental identification of a quantum\nspin liquid state is of fundamental importance for our understanding of quantum\nmatter. Theoretical studies have proposed various quantum-spin-liquid ground\nstates, most of which are characterized by exotic spin excitations with\nfractional quantum numbers (termed `spinon'). Here, we report neutron\nscattering measurements that reveal broad spin excitations covering a wide\nregion of the Brillouin zone in a triangular antiferromagnet YbMgGaO4. The\nobserved diffusive spin excitation persists at the lowest measured energy and\nshows a clear upper excitation edge, which is consistent with the particle-hole\nexcitation of a spinon Fermi surface. Our results therefore point to a QSL\nstate with a spinon Fermi surface in YbMgGaO4 that has a perfect spin-1/2\ntriangular lattice as in the original proposal of quantum spin liquids.\n", "  We map the Hilbert space of the quantum Harmonic oscillator to the space of\nGlauber's $n$th-order intensity correlators, in effect showing \"the\ncorrelations between the correlators\" for a random sampling of the quantum\nstates. In particular, we show how the popular $g^{(2)}$ function is correlated\nto the mean population and how a recurrent criterion to identify\nsingle-particle states or emitters, namely $g^{(2)}<1/2$, is incorrect as\nstates exist that satisfy this condition with average population larger than\none. Our charting of the Hilbert space allows to capture its structure in a\nsimpler and physically more intuitive way that can be used to classify quantum\nsources by surveying which territory they can access.\n", "  Bell inequalities have traditionally been used to demonstrate that quantum\ntheory is nonlocal, in the sense that there exist correlations generated from\ncomposite quantum states that cannot be explained by means of local hidden\nvariables. With the advent of device-independent quantum information protocols,\nBell inequalities have gained an additional role as certificates of relevant\nquantum properties. In this work we consider the problem of designing Bell\ninequalities that are tailored to detect maximally entangled states. We\nintroduce a class of Bell inequalities valid for an arbitrary number of\nmeasurements and results, derive analytically their tight classical,\nnon-signalling and quantum bounds and prove that the latter is attained by\nmaximally entangled states. Our inequalities can therefore find an application\nin device-independent protocols requiring maximally entangled states.\n", "  The inverse problem is studied in multi-body systems with nonlinear dynamics\nrepresenting, e.g., phase-locked wave systems, standard multimode and random\nlasers. Using a general model for four-body interacting complex-valued\nvariables we test two methods based on pseudolikelihood, respectively with\nregularization and with decimation, to determine the coupling constants from\nsets of measured configurations. We test statistical inference predictions for\nincreasing number of sampled configurations and for an externally tunable {\\em\ntemperature}-like parameter mimicing real data noise and helping minimization\nprocedures. Analyzed models with phasors and rotors are generalizations of\nproblems of real-valued spherical problems (e.g., density fluctuations),\ndiscrete spins (Ising and vectorial Potts) or finite number of states (standard\nPotts): inference methods presented here can, then, be straightforward applied\nto a large class of inverse problems.\n", "  Although the paradigm of criticality is centred around spatial correlations\nand their anomalous scaling, not many studies of Self-Organised Criticality\n(SOC) focus on spatial correlations. Often, integrated observables, such as\navalanche size and duration, are used, not least as to avoid complications due\nto the unavoidable lack of translational invariance. The present work is a\nsurvey of spatio-temporal correlation functions in the Manna Model of SOC,\nmeasured numerically in detail in d=1,3 and 5 dimensions and compared to\ntheoretical results, in particular relating them to \"integrated\" observables\nsuch as avalanche size and duration scaling, that measure them indirectly.\nContrary to the notion held by some of SOC models organising into a critical\nstate by re-arranging their spatial structure avalanche by avalanche, which may\nbe expected to result in large, non-trivial, system-spanning spatial\ncorrelations in the quiescent state (between avalanches), correlations of\ninactive particles in the quiescent state have a small amplitude that does not\nincrease with the system size, although they display (noisy) power law scaling\nover a range linear in the system size. Self-organisation, however, does take\nplace as the (one-point) density of inactive particles organises into a\nparticular profile that is asymptotically independent of the driving location,\nalso demonstrated analytically in one dimension. Activity and its correlations,\non the other hand, display non-trivial long-ranged spatio-temporal scaling with\nexponents that can be related to established results, in particular avalanche\nsize and duration exponents. The correlation length and amplitude are set by\nthe system size (confirmed analytically for some observables), as expected in\nsystems displaying finite size scaling. In one dimension, we find some\nsurprising inconsistencies of the dynamical exponent. A (spatially extended)\nmean ...\n", "  We consider two high-frequency thermal processes in uniformly heated harmonic\ncrystals relaxing towards equilibrium: (i) equilibration of kinetic and\npotential energies and (ii) redistribution of energy among spatial directions.\nEquation describing these processes with deterministic initial conditions is\nderived. Solution of the equation shows that characteristic time of these\nprocesses is of the order of ten periods of atomic vibrations. After that time\nthe system practically reaches the stationary state. It is shown analytically\nthat in harmonic crystals temperature tensor is not isotropic even in the\nstationary state. As an example, harmonic triangular lattice is considered.\nSimple formula relating the stationary value of the temperature tensor and\ninitial conditions is derived. The function describing equilibration of kinetic\nand potential energies is obtained. It is shown that the difference between the\nenergies (Lagrangian) oscillates around zero. Amplitude of these oscillations\ndecays inversely proportional to time. Analytical results are in a good\nagreement with numerical simulations.\n  Keywords: tensor temperature; nonequilibrium processes; transition to\nequilibrium; harmonic crystals; triangular lattice.\n", "  Heavily electron-doped iron-selenide (HEDIS) high-transition-temperature\n(high-$T_{\\rm{c}}$) superconductors, which have no hole Fermi pockets, but have\na notably high $T_{\\rm{c}}$, have challenged the prevailing $s$$_\\pm$ pairing\nscenario originally proposed for iron pnictides containing both electron and\nhole pockets. The microscopic mechanism underlying the enhanced\nsuperconductivity in HEDIS remains unclear. Here, we used neutron scattering to\nstudy the spin excitations of the HEDIS material Li$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$ODFeSe\n($T_{\\rm{c}}$ = 41 K). Our data revealed nearly ring-shaped magnetic resonant\nexcitations surrounding ($\\pi$, $\\pi$) at $\\sim$ 21 meV. As the energy\nincreased, the spin excitations assumed a diamond shape, and they dispersed\noutward until the energy reached $\\sim$ 60 meV and then inward at higher\nenergies. The observed energy-dependent momentum structure and twisted\ndispersion of spin excitations near ($\\pi$, $\\pi$) are analogous to those of\nhole-doped cuprates in several aspects, thus implying that such spin\nexcitations are essential for the remarkably high $T_{\\rm{c}}$ in these\nmaterials.\n", "  A dedicated search is presented for new phenomena in inclusive eight- and\nten-jet final states with low missing transverse momentum, with and without\nidentification of jets originating from b quarks. The analysis is based on data\nfrom proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6\ninverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at sqrt(s) = 8\nTeV. The dominant multijet background expectations are obtained from low jet\nmultiplicity control samples. Data agree well with the standard model\nbackground predictions, and limits are set in several benchmark models.\nColorons (axigluons) with masses between 0.6 and 0.75 (up to 1.15) TeV are\nexcluded at 95% confidence level. Similar exclusion limits for gluinos in\nR-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios are from 0.6 up to 1.1 TeV. These\nresults comprise the first experimental probe of the coloron and axigluon\nmodels in multijet final states.\n", "  We call \\emph{Alphabet model} a generalization to N types of particles of the\nclassic ABC model. We have particles of different types stochastically evolving\non a one dimensional lattice with an exchange dynamics. The rates of exchange\nare local but under suitable conditions the dynamics is reversible with a\nGibbsian like invariant measure with long range interactions. We discuss\ngeometrically the conditions of reversibility on a ring that correspond to a\ngradient condition on the graph of configurations or equivalently to a\ndivergence free condition on a graph structure associated to the types of\nparticles. We show that much of the information on the interactions between\nparticles can be encoded in associated \\emph{Tournaments} that are a special\nclass of oriented directed graphs. In particular we show that the interactions\nof reversible models are corresponding to strongly connected tournaments. The\npossible minimizers of the energies are in correspondence with the Hamiltonian\ncycles of the tournaments. We can then determine how many and which are the\npossible minimizers of the energy looking at the structure of the associated\ntournament. As a byproduct we obtain a probabilistic proof of a classic Theorem\nof Camion \\cite{Camion} on the existence of Hamiltonian cycles for strongly\nconnected tournaments. Using these results we obtain in the case of an equal\nnumber of k types of particles new representations of the Hamiltonians in terms\nof translation invariant $k$-body long range interactions. We show that when\n$k=3,4$ the minimizer of the energy is always unique up to translations.\nStarting from the case $k=5$ it is possible to have more than one minimizer. In\nparticular it is possible to have minimizers for which particles of the same\ntype are not joined together in single clusters.\n", "  Cold atoms in an optical lattice with brick-wall geometry have been used to\nmimic graphene, a two-dimensional material with characteristic Dirac\nexcitations. Here we propose to bring such artificial graphene into the\nproximity of a second atomic layer with a square lattice geometry. For\nnon-interacting fermions, we find that such bilayer system undergoes a phase\ntransition from a graphene-like semi-metal phase, characterized by a band\nstructure with Dirac points, to a gapped band insulator phase. In the presence\nof attractive interactions between fermions with pseudospin-1/2 degree of\nfreedom, a competition between semi-metal and superfluid behavior is found at\nthe mean-field level. Using the quantum Monte Carlo method, we also investigate\nthe case of strong repulsive interactions. In the Mott phase, each layer\nexhibits a different amount of long-range magnetic order. Upon coupling both\nlayers, a valence-bond crystal is formed at a critical coupling strength.\nFinally, we discuss how these bilayer systems could be realized in existing\ncold atom experiments.\n", "  Supertranslations, and at least in 2+1 dimensions superrotations, are\nasymptotic symmetries of the metric in asymptotically flat spacetimes. They are\nnot, however, symmetries of the boundary term of the Einstein-Hilbert action,\nwhich therefore induces an action for the Goldstone-like fields that\nparametrize these symmetries. I show that in 2+1 dimensions, this action is\nclosely related to a chiral Liouville action, as well as the \"Schwarzian\"\naction that appears in two-dimensional near-AdS physics.\n", "  We analyze properties of unstable vacuum states from the point of view of the\nquantum theory. In the literature one can find some suggestions that some of\nfalse (unstable) vacuum states may survive up to times when their survival\nprobability has a non-exponential form. At asymptotically late times the\nsurvival probability as a function of time $t$ has an inverse power--like form.\nWe show that at this time region the energy of the false vacuum states tends to\nthe energy of the true vacuum state as $1/t^{2}$ for $t \\to \\infty$. This means\nthat the energy density in the unstable vacuum state should have analogous\nproperties and hence the cosmological constant $\\Lambda = \\Lambda (t)$ too. The\nconclusion is that $\\Lambda$ in the Universe with the unstable vacuum should\nhave a form of the sum of the \"bare\" cosmological constant and of the term of a\ntype $1/t^{2}$: $\\Lambda(t) \\equiv \\Lambda_{bare} + d/ t^{2}$ (where\n$\\Lambda_{bare}$ is the cosmological constant for the Universe with the true\nvacuum).\n", "  In this paper, we study a coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger system with small\ninitial data in a product space. We establish a modified scattering of the\nsolutions of this system and we construct a modified wave operator. The study\nof the resonant system, which provides the asymptotic dynamics, allows us to\nhighlight a control of the Sobolev norms and interesting dynamics with the\nbeating effect. The proof uses a recent work of Hani, Pausader, Tzvetkov and\nVisciglia for the modified scattering, and a recent work of Gr\\'ebert, Paturel\nand Thomann for the study of the resonant system.\n", "  Systematic comparisons of jetlike correlation data to radiative and\ncollisional energy loss model calculations are essential to extract transport\nproperties of the quark-gluon medium created in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions. This paper presents a transport study of collisional broadening of\njetlike correlations, by following parton-parton collision history in a\nmultiphase transport (AMPT) model. The correlation shape is studied as a\nfunction of the number of parton-parton collisions suffered by a high\ntransverse momentum probe parton ($N_{\\rm coll}$) and the azimuth of the probe\nrelative to the reaction plane ($\\phi_{\\rm fin.}^{\\rm probe}$). Correlation is\nfound to broaden with increasing $N_{\\rm coll}$ and $\\phi_{\\rm fin.}^{\\rm\nprobe}$ from in- to out-of-plane direction. This study provides a transport\nmodel reference for future jet-medium interaction studies.\n", "  In the late 80s, a curious effect suggested by Aharanov, Albert and Vaidman\nopened up new vistas regarding quantum measurements on weakly coupled systems.\nThere, a combination of a \"weak\" finite interaction together with a \"strong\"\npost-selection measurement leads to an anomalous effect, namely the mean value\nof a spin-1/2 particle in the $z-$direction lies outside the conventional\nspectrum of $\\pm$1.\n  In this paper, we investigate the quantum control of the weak value\namplification of a qubit system coupled to a meter, via a second\nnon-interacting qubit, initially quantum correlated with the first one. Our\nresults show that for weak measurements, the control can be remotely realized\nvia the post-selected state of the second qubit or the degree of squeezing of\nthe meter. Additionally, in a step towards the study of the quantum control of\nthe amplification, we can easily manipulate the degree of quantum correlations\nbetween the initial correlated qubits. We find that the degree of Entanglement\nhas no effect on the quantum control of the amplification. However, we have\nfound a clear connection between the amplification and quantum discord like\nmeasurements as well as classical correlations between the qubits. Moreover, we\ngeneralize the analysis to two control qubits and we can conclude that the\nsingle control qubit scheme is more efficient. Lastly, we suggest an original\napplication of the amplification control protocol on the enhancement of the\nquantum measurement accuracy, e.g. measuring the relative phase of the\npost-selected control qubit in a more precise way, as opposed to the\nno-amplification case\n", "  A fiber-integrated spectrometer for single-photon pulses outside the\ntelecommunications wavelength range based upon frequency-to-time mapping,\nimplemented by chromatic group delay dispersion (GDD), and precise\ntemporally-resolved single-photon counting, is presented. A chirped fiber Bragg\ngrating provides low-loss GDD, mapping the frequency distribution of an input\npulse onto the temporal envelope of the output pulse. Time-resolved detection\nwith fast single-photon-counting modules enables monitoring of a wavelength\nrange from 825 nm to 835 nm with nearly uniform efficiency at 55 pm resolution\n(24 GHz at 830 nm). To demonstrate the versatility of this technique, spectral\ninterference of heralded single photons and the joint spectral intensity\ndistribution of a photon-pair source are measured. This approach to\nsingle-photon-level spectral measurements provides a route to realize\napplications of time-frequency quantum optics at visible and near-infrared\nwavelengths, where multiple spectral channels must be simultaneously monitored.\n", "  We discuss - in what is intended to be a pedagogical fashion - a criterion,\nwhich is a lower bound on a certain ratio, for when a stock (or a similar\ninstrument) is not a good investment in the long term, which can happen even if\nthe expected return is positive. The root cause is that prices are positive and\nhave skewed, long-tailed distributions, which coupled with volatility results\nin a long-run asymmetry. This relates to bubbles in stock prices, which we\ndiscuss using a simple binomial tree model, without resorting to the stochastic\ncalculus machinery. We illustrate empirical properties of the aforesaid ratio.\nLog of market cap and sectors appear to be relevant explanatory variables for\nthis ratio, while price-to-book ratio (or its log) is not. We also discuss a\nshort-term effect of volatility, to wit, the analog of Heisenberg's uncertainty\nprinciple in finance and a simple derivation thereof using a binary tree.\n", "  Optical complex materials offer unprecedented opportunity to engineer\nfundamental band dispersion which enables novel optoelectronic functionality\nand devices. Exploration of photonic Dirac cone at the center of momentum space\nhas inspired an exceptional characteristic of zero-index, which is similar to\nzero effective mass in fermionic Dirac systems. Such all-dielectric zero-index\nphotonic crystals provide an in-plane mechanism such that the energy of the\npropagating waves can be well confined along the chip direction. A\nstraightforward example is to achieve the anomalous focusing effect without\nlongitudinal spherical aberration, when the size of zero-index lens is large\nenough. Here, we designed and fabricated a prototype of zero-refractive-index\nlens by comprising large-area silicon nanopillar array with plane-concave\nprofile. Near-zero refractive index was quantitatively measured near 1.55 um\nthrough anomalous focusing effect, predictable by effective medium theory. The\nzero-index lens was also demonstrated to perform ultralow longitudinal\nspherical aberration. Such IC compatible device provides a new route to\nintegrate all-silicon zero-index materials into optical communication, sensing,\nand modulation, and to study fundamental physics on the emergent fields of\ntopological photonics and valley photonics.\n", "  Organic dopants are frequently used to surface-dope inorganic semiconductors.\nThe resulted hybrid inorganic-organic materials have a crucial role in advanced\nfunctional materials and semiconductor devices. In this article, we study\ncharge transfer at hybrid silicon-molecule interfaces theoretically. The idea\nis to filter out the best molecular acceptors to dope silicon with hole\ndensities as high as 1013 cm-2. Here, we use a combinatorial algorithm merging\nchemical hardness method and first-principles DFT and GW calculations. We start\nby using the chemical hardness method which is simple and fast to narrow down\nour search for molecular dopants. Then, for the most optimistic candidates, we\nperform first-principles DFT calculations and discuss the necessity of GW\ncorrections. This screening approach is quite general and applicable to other\nhybrid interfaces.\n", "  The article demonstrates uncommon manifestation of spatial dispersion in low\nrefractive index contrast 3D periodic dielectric composites with periods of\nabout one tenth of the wavelength. First principles simulations by the well\nestablished plane wave method reveal that spatial dispersion leads to\nappearance of additional optical axes and can compensate anisotropy in certain\ndirections.\n", "  We show the kinematic equivalence between cosmological models driven by\nDirac-Born-Infeld fields $\\phi$ with constant proper velocity of the brane and\nexponential potential $V=V_0e^{-B\\phi}$ and interactive cosmological systems\nwith Modified Holographic Ricci type fluids as dark energy in flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies.\n", "  We show that additional solutions must be ignored (in differences of the\nSchrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations) in the Dirac equation, where usually\npassed the second order radial equation, called the reduced equation, instead\nof a system. Analogously to the Schrodinger equation, in this process the Dirac\ndelta function appears, which was unnoted during the full history of quantum\nmechanics. This unphysical term we remove by a boundary condition at the\norigin. However, the distribution theory imposes on the radial function strong\nrestriction and by this reason practically for all potentials, even regular,\nuse of these reduced equations is not permissible. At the end we include\nconsideration in the framework of two-dimensional Dirac equation. We show that\neven here the additional solution does not survives as a result of usual\nphysical requirements.\n", "  Wind-blown sand and dust models depend sensitively on the threshold wind\nstress. However, laboratory and numerical experiments suggest the coexistence\nof distinct \"fluid\" and \"impact\" thresholds for the initiation and cessation of\naeolian saltation, respectively. Because aeolian transport models typically use\nonly the fluid threshold, existence of a separate lower impact threshold\ncomplicates the prediction of wind-driven transport. Here, we derive the first\nfield-based estimates of distinct fluid and impact thresholds from\nhigh-frequency saltation measurements at three field sites. Our measurements\nshow that, when saltation is mostly inactive, its instantaneous occurrence is\ngoverned primarily by wind exceedance of the fluid threshold. As saltation\nactivity increases, so too does the relative importance of the impact\nthreshold, until it dominates under near-continuous transport conditions.\nAlthough both thresholds are thus important for high-frequency saltation\nprediction, we find that the time-averaged saltation flux is primarily governed\nby impact threshold.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the structural properties of $Z=132$ and $Z=138$\nsuperheavy nuclei within the ambit of axially deformed relativistic mean-field\nframework with NL$3^{*}$ parametrization and calculate the total binding\nenergies, radii, quadrupole deformation parameter, separation energies, density\ndistributions. We also investigate the phenomenon of shape coexistence by\nperforming the calculations for prolate, oblate and spherical configurations.\nFor clear presentation of nucleon distributions, the two-dimensional contour\nrepresentation of individual nucleon density and total matter density has been\nmade. Further, a competition between possible decay modes such as\n$\\alpha$-decay, $\\beta$-decay and spontaneous fission of the isotopic chain of\nsuperheavy nuclei with $Z=132$ within the range 312 $\\le$ A $\\le$ 392 and 318\n$\\le$ A $\\le$ 398 for $Z=138$ is systematically analyzed within self-consistent\nrelativistic mean field model. From our analysis, we inferred that the\n$\\alpha$-decay and spontaneous fission are the principal modes of decay in\nmajority of the isotopes of superheavy nuclei under investigation apart from\n$\\beta$ decay as dominant mode of decay in $^{318-322}138$ isotopes.\n", "  We discuss a realization of a small field inflation based on string inspired\nsupergravities. In theories accompanying extra dimensions, compactification of\nthem with small radii is required for realistic situations. Since the extra\ndimension can have a periodicity, there will appear (quasi-)periodic functions\nunder transformations of moduli of the extra dimensions in low energy scales.\nSuch a periodic property can lead to a UV completion of so-called multi-natural\ninflation model where inflaton potential consists of a sum of multiple\nsinusoidal functions with a decay constant smaller than the Planck scale. As an\nillustration, we construct a SUSY breaking model, and then show that such an\ninflaton potential can be generated by a sum of world sheet instantons in\nintersecting brane models on extra dimensions containing $T^2/{\\mathbb Z}_2$\norbifold. We show also predictions of cosmic observables by numerical analyzes.\n", "  The rate of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in a galaxy depends not only on\nstellar mass, but also on star formation history. Here we show that two simple\nobservational quantities ($g-r$ or $u-r$ host galaxy color, and $r$-band\nluminosity), coupled with an assumed delay time distribution (the rate of SNe\nIa as a function of time for an instantaneous burst of star formation), are\nsufficient to accurately determine a galaxy's SN Ia rate, with very little\nsensitivity to the precise details of the star formation history. Using this\nresult, we compare observed and predicted color distributions of SN Ia hosts\nfor the MENeaCS cluster supernova survey, and for the SDSS Stripe 82 supernova\nsurvey. The observations are consistent with a continuous delay time\ndistribution (DTD), without any cutoff. For old progenitor systems the\npower-law slope for the DTD is found to be $-1.50 ^{+0.19} _{-0.15}$. This\nresult favours the double degenerate scenario for SN Ia, though other\ninterpretations are possible. We find that the late-time slopes of the delay\ntime distribution are different at the 1$\\sigma$ level for low and high stretch\nsupernova, which suggest a single degenerate scenario for the latter. However,\ndue to ambiguity in the current models' DTD predictions, single degenerate\nprogenitors can neither be confirmed as causing high stretch supernovae nor\nruled out from contributing to the overall sample.\n", "  Weak measurements done on a subsystem of a bipartite system having both\nclassical and nonClassical correlations between its components can potentially\nreveal information about the other subsystem with minimal disturbance to the\noverall state. We use weak quantum discord and the fidelity between the initial\nbipartite state and the state after measurement to construct a cost function\nthat accounts for both the amount of information revealed about the other\nsystem as well as the disturbance to the overall state. We investigate the\nbehaviour of the cost function for families of two qubit states and show that\nthere is an optimal choice that can be made for the strength of the weak\nmeasurement.\n", "  Strong field gravitational lensing in the context of both higher spacetime\ndimensions and in presence of Kalb-Ramond field have been studied. After\ndeveloping proper analytical tools to analyze the problem we consider\ngravitational lensing in three distinct black hole spacetimes --- (a) four\ndimensional black hole in presence of Kalb-Ramond field, (b) brane world black\nholes with Kalb-Ramond field and finally (c) black hole solution in $f(T)$\ngravity. In all the three situations we have depicted the behavior of three\nobservables: the asymptotic position approached by the relativistic images, the\nangular separation and magnitude difference between the outermost images with\nothers packed inner ones, both numerically and analytically. Difference between\nthese scenarios have also been discussed along with possible observational\nsignatures.\n", "  We consider one dimensional weakly asymmetric boundary driven models of heat\nconduction. In the cases of a constant diffusion coefficient and of a quadratic\nmobility we compute the quasi-potential that is a non local functional obtained\nby the solution of a variational problem. This is done using the dynamic\nvariational approach of the macroscopic fluctuation theory \\cite{MFT}. The case\nof a concave mobility corresponds essentially to the exclusion model that has\nbeen discussed in \\cite{Lag,CPAM,BGLa,ED}. We consider here the convex case\nthat includes for example the Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model and its\ndual (KMPd) \\cite{KMP}. This extends to the weakly asymmetric regime the\ncomputations in \\cite{BGL}. We consider then, both microscopically and\nmacroscopically, the limit of large external fields. Microscopically we discuss\nsome possible totally asymmetric limits of the KMP model. In one case the\ntotally asymmetric dynamics has a product invariant measure. Another possible\nlimit dynamics has instead a non trivial invariant measure for which we give a\nduality representation. Macroscopically we show that the quasi-potentials of\nKMP and KMPd, that for any fixed external field are non local, become local in\nthe limit. Moreover the dependence on one of the external reservoirs\ndisappears. For models having strictly positive quadratic mobilities we obtain\ninstead in the limit a non local functional having a structure similar to the\none of the boundary driven asymmetric exclusion process.\n", "  The nucleon spin-averaged forward virtual Compton tensor determines important\nphysical quantities such as electromagnetically-induced mass differences of\nnucleons, and two-photon exchange contributions in hydrogen spectroscopy. It\ndepends on two kinematic variables: $\\nu$, the virtual photon energy in the\nproton rest frame, and $Q^2$, the photon's invariant four-momentum squared.\nUsing the operator product expansion, we calculate the tensor's large-$Q^2$\nbehavior for $\\nu=0$, including for the first time the full spin-2 contribution\nand correcting a previous result in the literature for the spin-0 contribution.\nImplications for the proton radius puzzle are discussed.\n", "  The framework of entropic dynamics (ED) allows one to derive quantum\nmechanics as an application of entropic inference. In this work we derive the\nclassical limit of quantum mechanics in the context of ED. Our goal is to find\nconditions so that the center of mass (CM) of a system of N particles behaves\nas a classical particle. What is of interest is that Planck's constant remains\nfinite at all steps in the calculation and that the classical motion is\nobtained as the result of a central limit theorem. More explicitly we show that\nif the system is sufficiently large, and if the CM is initially uncorrelated\nwith other degrees of freedom, then the CM follows a smooth trajectory and\nobeys the classical Hamilton-Jacobi with a vanishing quantum potential.\n", "  We propose a decoherence protected protocol for sending single photon quantum\nstates through depolarizing channels. This protocol is implemented via an\napproximate quantum adder engineered through spontaneous parametric down\nconverters, and shows higher success probability than distilled quantum\nteleportation protocols for distances below a threshold depending on the\nproperties of the channel.\n", "  Using the composite boson many-body formalism that takes single-exciton\nstates rather than free carrier states as a basis, we derive the integral\nequation fulfilled by the exciton-exciton effective scattering from which the\nrole of fermion exchanges can be unraveled. For excitons made of\n$(\\pm1/2)$-spin electrons and $(\\pm3/2)$-spin holes, as in GaAs\nheterostructures, one major result is that most spin configurations lead to\nbrightness-conserving scatterings with equal amplitude $\\Delta$, in spite of\nthe fact that they involve different carrier exchanges. A brightness-changing\nchannel also exists when two opposite-spin excitons scatter: dark excitons\n$(2,-2)$ can end either in the same dark states with an amplitude $\\Delta_e$,\nor in opposite-spin bright states $(1,-1)$, with a different amplitude\n$\\Delta_o$, the number of carrier exchanges being even or odd respectively.\nAnother major result is that these amplitudes are linked by a striking\nrelation, $\\Delta_e+\\Delta_o=\\Delta$, which has decisive consequence for\nexciton Bose-Einstein condensation. Indeed, this relation leads to the\nconclusion that the exciton condensate can be optically observed through a\nbright part only when excitons have a large dipole, that is, when the electrons\nand holes are well separated in two adjacent layers.\n", "  Extensivity of conservation laws of the quantum Hirota model on a $1+1$\ndimensional lattice is considered. This model can be interpreted in terms of an\nintegrable many-body quantum Floquet dynamics. We establish the procedure to\ngenerate a continuous family of quasilocal conservation laws from the conserved\noperators proposed by Faddeev and Volkov. The Hilbert-Schmidt kernel which\nallows the calculation of inner products of these new conservation laws is\nexplicitly computed. This result has potential applications in quantum quench\nand transport problems in integrable quantum field theories.\n", "  We have simulated a half-filled $1D$ $p$-wave periodic Anderson model with\nnumerically exact projector quantum Monte Carlo technique, and the system is\nindeed located in the Haldane-like state as detected in previous works on the\n$p$-wave Kondo lattice model, though the soluble non-interacting limit\ncorresponds to the conventional $Z_{2}$ topological insulator. The\nsite-resolved magnetization in an open boundary system and strange correlator\nfor the periodic boundary have been used to identify the mentioned topological\nstates. Interestingly, the edge magnetization in the Haldane-like state is not\nsaturated to unit magnetic moment due to the intrinsic charge fluctuation in\nour periodic Anderson-like model, which is beyond the description of the Kondo\nlattice-like model in existing literature. The finding here underlies the\ncorrelation driven topological state in this prototypical interacting\ntopological state of matter and naive use of non-interacting picture should be\ntaken care. Moreover, no trace of the surface Kondo breakdown at zero\ntemperature is observed and it is suspected that frustration-like interaction\nmay be crucial in inducing such radical destruction of Kondo screening. The\nfindings here may be relevant to our understanding of interacting topological\nmaterials like topological Kondo insulator candidate SmB$_{6}$.\n", "  Cauchy invariants are now viewed as a powerful tool for investigating the\nLagrangian structure of three-dimensional (3D) ideal flow (Frisch &\nZheligovsky, Commun. Math. Phys., vol. 326, 2014, pp. 499-505, Podvigina et\nal., J. Comput. Phys., vol. 306, 2016, pp. 320-342). Looking at such invariants\nwith the modern tools of differential geometry and of geodesic flow on the\nspace SDiff of volume-preserving transformations (Arnold, Ann. Inst. Fourier,\nvol. 16, 1966, pp. 319-361), all manners of generalisations are here derived.\nThe Cauchy invariants equation and the Cauchy formula, relating the vorticity\nand the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, are shown to be two expressions of this\nLie-advection invariance, which are duals of each other (specifically, Hodge\ndual). Actually, this is shown to be an instance of a general result, which\nholds for flow both in flat (Euclidean) space and in a curved Riemannian space:\nany Lie-advection invariant p-form which is exact (i.e. is a differential of a\n(p-1)-form) has an associated Cauchy invariants equation and a Cauchy formula.\nThis constitutes a new fundamental result in linear transport theory, providing\na Lagrangian formulation of Lie advection for some classes of differential\nforms. The result has a broad applicability: examples include the\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations and various extensions thereof, discussed\nby Lingam et al. (Phys. Lett. A, vol. 380, 2016, pp. 2400-2406), and include\nalso the equations of Tao (2016, arXiv:1606.08481 [math.AP]), Euler equations\nwith modified Biot-Savart law, displaying finite-time blow-up. Our main result\nis also used for new derivations, and several new results, concerning local\nhelicity-type invariants for fluids and MHD flow in flat or curved spaces of\narbitrary dimension.\n", "  Recently, the basic concept of quantum coherence (or superposition) has\ngained a lot of renewed attention, after Baumgratz et al. [PRL 113:140401\n(2014)], following \\AA{}berg [arXiv:quant-ph/0612146], have proposed a resource\ntheoretic approach to quantify it. This has resulted in a large number of\npapers and preprints exploring various coherence monotones, and debating\npossible forms for the resource theory. Here we take the view that the\noperational foundation of coherence in a state, be it quantum or otherwise wave\nmechanical, lies in the observation of interference effects.\n  Our approach here is to consider an idealised multi-path interferometer, with\na suitable detector, in such a way that the visibility of the interference\npattern provides a quantitative expression of the amount of coherence in a\ngiven probe state. We present a general framework of deriving coherence\nmeasures from visibility, and demonstrate it by analysing several concrete\nvisibility parameters, recovering some known coherence measures and obtaining\nsome new ones.\n", "  The statistical behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue has important\nimplications for systems which can be modeled using a Wishart-Laguerre\nensemble, the regular one or the fixed trace one. For example, the density of\nthe smallest eigenvalue of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble plays a crucial role\nin characterizing multiple channel telecommunication systems. Similarly, in the\nquantum entanglement problem, the smallest eigenvalue of the fixed trace\nensemble carries information regarding the nature of entanglement.\n  For real Wishart-Laguerre matrices, there exists an elegant recurrence scheme\nsuggested by Edelman to directly obtain the exact expression for the smallest\neigenvalue density. In the case of complex Wishart-Laguerre matrices, for\nfinding exact and explicit expressions for the smallest eigenvalue density,\nexisting results based on determinants become impractical when the determinants\ninvolve large-size matrices. In this work, we derive a recurrence scheme for\nthe complex case which is analogous to that of Edelman's for the real case.\nThis is used to obtain exact results for the smallest eigenvalue density for\nboth the regular, and the fixed trace complex Wishart-Laguerre ensembles. We\nvalidate our analytical results using Monte Carlo simulations. We also study\nscaled Wishart-Laguerre ensemble and investigate its efficacy in approximating\nthe fixed-trace ensemble. Eventually, we apply our result for the fixed-trace\nensemble to investigate the behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue in the\nparadigmatic system of coupled kicked tops.\n", "  In electronic systems with long-range Coulomb interaction, the nonlocal Fock\nexchange term has a band-widening effect. While this effect is included in\ncombined many-body perturbation theory and dynamical mean field theory schemes,\nit is not taken into account in standard extended DMFT (EDMFT) calculations.\nHere, we include this instantaneous term in both approaches and investigate its\neffect on the phase diagram and dynamically screened interaction. We show that\nthe largest deviations between previously presented EDMFT and $GW$+EDMFT\nresults originate from the nonlocal Fock term, and that the quantitative\ndifferences are especially large in the strong-coupling limit. Furthermore, we\nshow that the charge-ordering phase diagram obtained in $GW$+EDMFT methods for\nmoderate interaction values is very similar to the one predicted by dual boson\nmethods that include the fermion-boson or four-point vertex.\n", "  Spekkens' toy model is a non-contextual hidden variable model with an\nepistemic restriction, a constraint on what an observer can know about reality.\nThe aim of the model, developed for continuous and discrete prime degrees of\nfreedom, is to advocate the epistemic view of quantum theory, where quantum\nstates are states of incomplete knowledge about a deeper underlying reality.\nMany aspects of quantum mechanics and protocols from quantum information can be\nreproduced in the model. In spite of its significance, a number of aspects of\nSpekkens' model remained incomplete. Formal rules for the update of states\nafter measurement had not been written down, and the theory had only been\nconstructed for prime-dimensional, and infinite dimensional systems. In this\nwork, we remedy this, by deriving measurement update rules, and extending the\nframework to derive models in all dimensions, both prime and non-prime.\nStabilizer quantum mechanics is a sub-theory of quantum mechanics with\nrestricted states, transformations and measurements. First derived for the\npurpose of constructing error correcting codes, it now plays a role in many\nareas of quantum information theory. Previously, it had been shown that\nSpekkens' model was operationally equivalent in the case of infinite and odd\nprime dimensions. Here, exploiting known results on Wigner functions, we extend\nthis to show that Spekkens' model is equivalent to stabilizer quantum mechanics\nin all odd dimensions, prime and non-prime. This equivalence provides new\ntechnical tools for the study of technically difficult compound-dimensional\nstabilizer quantum mechanics.\n", "  Implementing the modal method in the electromagnetic grating diffraction\nproblem delivered by the curvilinear coordinate transformation yields a general\nanalytical solution to the 1D grating diffraction problem in a form of a\nT-matrix. Simultaneously it is shown that the validity of the Rayleigh\nexpansion is defined by the validity of the modal expansion in a transformed\nmedium delivered by the coordinate transformation.\n", "  The nature of pulsar-like compact stars is essentially a central question of\nthe fundamental strong interaction (explained in quantum chromo-dynamics) at\nlow energy scale, the solution of which still remains a challenge though\ntremendous efforts have been tried. This kind of compact objects could actually\nbe strange quark stars if strange quark matter in bulk may constitute the true\nground state of the strong-interaction matter rather than Fe^56 (the so-called\nWitten's conjecture). From astrophysical points of view, however, it is\nproposed that strange cluster matter could be absolutely stable and thus those\ncompact stars could be strange cluster stars in fact. This proposal could be\nregarded as a general Witten's conjecture: strange matter in bulk could be\nabsolutely stable, in which quarks are either free (for strange quark matter)\nor localized (for strange cluster matter). Strange cluster with\nthree-light-flavor symmetry is renamed strangeon, being coined by combining\n\"strange nucleon\" for the sake of simplicity. A strangeon star can then be\nthought as a 3-flavored gigantic nucleus, and strangeons are its constituent as\nan analogy of nucleons which are the constituent of a normal (micro) nucleus.\nThe observational consequences of strangeon stars show that different\nmanifestations of pulsar-like compact stars could be understood in the regime\nof strangeon stars, and we are expecting more evidence for strangeon star by\nadvanced facilities (e.g., FAST, SKA, and eXTP).\n", "  We construct the geometro-hydrodynamical formalism for a spinning particle\nbased on the six-dimensional manifold of autoparallelism geometry which is\nrepresented as a vector bundle with a base formed by the manifold of the\ntranslational coordinates and a fibre specified at each point by the field of\nan orthogonal coordinate frame underlying the classical spin. We show that the\ngeometry of oriented points leads to the existence of torsion field with the\nsource - the classical spin. We expand the geometro-hydrodynamical\nrepresentation of Pauli field developed by Takabayasi and Vigier. We show that\nthe external torsion field has a force effect on the velocity and spin fields\nvia the spin-vorticity, which is characteristic of the space structure with the\ninhomogene triad field. The possible experimental effects of torsion field are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The precise connection between quantum wave functions and the underlying\nclassical trajectories often is presented rather vaguely by practitioners of\nquantum mechanics. Here we demonstrate, with simple examples, that the imaging\ntheorem (IT) based on the semiclassical propagator provides a precise\nconnection. Wave functions are preserved out to macroscopic distances but the\nvariables, position and momentum, of these functions describe classical\ntrajectories. We show that the IT, based on an overtly time-dependent picture,\nprovides a strategy alternative to standard scattering theory with which to\ncompare experimental results to theory.\n", "  In a number of recent experiments, it has been shown that femtosecond laser\npulses can control magnetization on picosecond timescales, which is at least an\norder of magnitude faster compared to conventional magnetization dynamics.\nAmong these demonstrations, one material system (GdFeCo ferromagnetic films) is\nparticularly interesting, as deterministic toggle-switching of the magnetic\norder has been achieved without the need of any symmetry breaking magnetic\nfield. This phenomenon is often referred to as all optical switching (AOS).\nHowever, so far, GdFeCo remains the only material system where such\ndeterministic switching has been observed. When extended to ferromagnetic\nsystems, which are of greater interest in many technological applications, only\na partial effect can be achieved, which in turn requires repeated laser pulses\nfor full switching. However, such repeated pulsing is not only energy hungry,\nit also negates the speed advantage of AOS. Motivated by this problem, we have\ndeveloped a general method for single-shot, picosecond timescale, complete all\noptical switching of ferromagnetic materials. We demonstrate that in\nexchange-coupled layers of Co/Pt and GdFeCo, single shot, switching of the\nferromagnetic Co/Pt layer is achieved within 7 picoseconds after irradiation by\na femtosecond laser pulse. We believe that this approach will greatly expand\nthe range of materials and applications for ultrafast magnetic switching.\n", "  This paper has the purpose of presenting in an organic way a new approach to\nintegrable (1+1)-dimensional field systems and their systematic quantization\nemerging from intersection theory of the moduli space of stable algebraic\ncurves and, in particular, cohomological field theories, Hodge classes and\ndouble ramification cycles. This methods are alternative to the traditional\nWitten-Kontsevich framework and its generalizations by Dubrovin and Zhang and,\namong other advantages, have the merit of encompassing quantum integrable\nsystems. Most of this material originates from an ongoing collaboration with A.\nBuryak, B. Dubrovin and J. Gu\\'er\\'e.\n", "  In this paper, we give a procedure of how to discretize the recursion\noperators by considering unified bilinear forms of integrable hierarchies. As\ntwo illustrative examples, the unified bilinear forms of the AKNS hierarchy and\nthe KdV hierarchy are presented from their recursion operators. Via the\ncompatibility between soliton equations and their auto-B\\\"acklund\ntransformations, the bilinear integrable hierarchies are discretized and the\ndiscrete recursion operators are obtained. The discrete recursion operators\nconverge to the original continuous forms after a standard limit.\n", "  A search for the rare decays $B_s^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $B^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$\nis performed using proton--proton collision data collected with the LHCb\ndetector. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3fb$^{-1}$\ncollected in 2011 and 2012. The $\\tau$ leptons are reconstructed through the\ndecay $\\tau^-\\to\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-\\nu_{\\tau}$. Assuming no contribution from\n$B^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ decays, an upper limit is set on the branching fraction\n$\\mathcal{B}(B_s^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-) < 6.8\\times 10^{-3}$ at 95% confidence\nlevel. If instead no contribution from $B_s^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ decays is\nassumed, the limit is $\\mathcal{B}(B^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-)< 2.1 \\times 10^{-3}$ at\n95% confidence level. These results correspond to the first direct limit on\n$\\mathcal{B}(B_s^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-)$ and the world's best limit on\n$\\mathcal{B}(B^0\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-)$.\n", "  We present constraints on the masses of extremely light bosons dubbed fuzzy\ndark matter from Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data. Extremely light bosons with a De\nBroglie wavelength of $\\sim 1$ kpc have been suggested as dark matter\ncandidates that may resolve some of the current small scale problems of the\ncold dark matter model. For the first time we use hydrodynamical simulations to\nmodel the Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux power spectrum in these models and compare with\nthe observed flux power spectrum from two different data sets: the XQ-100 and\nHIRES/MIKE quasar spectra samples. After marginalization over nuisance and\nphysical parameters and with conservative assumptions for the thermal history\nof the IGM that allow for jumps in the temperature of up to $5000\\rm\\,K$,\nXQ-100 provides a lower limit of 7.1$\\times 10^{-22}$ eV, HIRES/MIKE returns a\nstronger limit of 14.3$\\times 10^{-22}$ eV, while the combination of both data\nsets results in a limit of 20 $\\times 10^{-22}$ eV (2$\\sigma$ C.L.). The limits\nfor the analysis of the combined data sets increases to 37.5$\\times 10^{-22}$\neV (2$\\sigma$ C.L.) when a smoother thermal history is assumed where the\ntemperature of the IGM evolves as a power-law in redshift. Light boson masses\nin the range $1-10 \\times10^{-22}$ eV are ruled out at high significance by our\nanalysis, casting strong doubts that FDM helps solve the \"small scale crisis\"\nof the cold dark matter models.\n", "  Postulating that spacetime is discrete, we assume that physical space is\ndescribed by a 3-dimensional cubic lattice.The corresponding symmetry group of\nrotations has order 24 and motivates the introduction of a cubic shaped graph\nwith 27 vertices and 351 edges. We call this graph the elementary particle cube\n(EPC) and consider the vertices as tiny cells that pre-elementary particles\ncalled preons can occupy and the edges as interactions between preons. The 23\nnontrivial members of the symmetry group naturally associate with the 23 basic\nelementary particles. We assume that each elementary particle is described by a\nunique subgraph of the EPC. The particular subgraph is determined by symmetry\nand the particle's mass. We postulate that the particle mass is a certain\nfunction of the lengths of the edges in the graph representing the particle.\nThis correspondence between particle graphs and mass appears to be quite\naccurate and gives a reason why leptons and quarks come in three generations.\nIn this way, the basic elementary particles emerge in a natural way from a few\nsimple principles. The paper ends with a discussion of hadrons, which as in the\nstandard model, are composite systems of quarks.\n", "  In this report, we propose a new concept of one-dimensional (1D) closed lines\nof Dirac magnon nodes in two-dimensional (2D) momentum space of quasi-2D\nquantum magnetic systems. They are termed \"2D Dirac magnon nodal-line loops\".\nWe utilize the bilayer honeycomb ferromagnets with intralayer coupling $J$ and\ninterlayer coupling $J_L$, which is realizable in the honeycomb chromium\ncompounds CrX$_3$ (X $\\equiv$ Br, Cl, and I). However, our results can also\nexist in other layered quasi-2D quantum magnetic systems. Here, we show that\nthe magnon bands of the bilayer honeycomb ferromagnets overlap for $J_L\\neq 0$\nand form 1D closed lines of Dirac magnon nodes in 2D momentum space. The 2D\nDirac magnon nodal-line loops are topologically protected by inversion and\ntime-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, we show that they are robust against weak\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction $ \\Delta_{DM}< J_L$ and possess chiral magnon\nedge modes.}\n", "  One of the main results of the ATIC (Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter)\nexperiment is a collection of energy spectra of abundant cosmic-ray nuclei:\nprotons, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe measured in terms of energy per particle in\nthe energy range from 50 GeV to tens of teraelectronvolts. In this paper, the\nATIC energy spectra of abundant primary nuclei are back-propagated to the\nspectra in sources in terms of magnetic rigidity using a leaky-box\napproximation of three different GALPROP-based diffusion models of propagation\nthat fit the latest B/C data of the AMS-02 experiment. It is shown that the\nresults of a comparison of the slopes of the spectra in sources are weakly\nmodel dependent; therefore the differences of spectral indices are reliable\ndata. A regular growth of the steepness of spectra in sources in the range of\nmagnetic rigidity of 50--1350~GV is found for a charge range from helium to\niron. This conclusion is statistically reliable with significance better than\n3.2 standard deviations. The results are discussed and compared to the data of\nother modern experiments.\n", "  The work is necessitated by search for new materials to detect ionizing\nradiation. The rare-earth ions doped with ternary alkali earth-halide systems\nare promising scintillators showing high efficiency and energy resolution. Some\naspects of crystal growth and data on the structural and luminescence\nproperties of BaBrI and BaClI doped with low concentrations of\n$\\mathrm{Eu^{2+}}$ ions are reported. The crystals are grown by the vertical\nBridgman method in sealed quartz ampoule. New crystallography data for BaClI\nsingle crystal obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction method are\npresented in this paper. Emission, excitation and optical absorption spectra as\nwell as luminescence decay kinetics are studied under excitation by X-ray,\nvacuum ultraviolet and ultraviolet radiation. The energies of the first 4f-5d\ntransition in $\\mathrm{Eu^{2+}}$ and band gap of the crystals have been\nobtained. We have calculated the electronic band structure of the crystals\nusing density functional theory as implemented in the \\latin{Ab Initio}.\nCalculated band gap energies are in accord with the experimental estimates. The\nenergy of gaps between the occupied Eu$^{2+}$ 4f level and the valence band top\nare predicted. In addition, positions of lanthanide energy levels in relation\nto valence band have been constructed using the chemical shift model.\n", "  A major challenge of any search for gravitational waves is to distinguish\ntrue astrophysical signals from those of terrestrial origin. Gravitational-wave\nexperiments therefore make use of multiple detectors, considering only those\nsignals which appear in coincidence in two or more instruments. It is unclear,\nhowever, how to interpret loud gravitational-wave candidates observed when only\none detector is operational. In this paper, we demonstrate that the observed\nrate of binary black hole mergers can be leveraged in order to make confident\ndetections of gravitational-wave signals with one detector alone. We quantify\ndetection confidences in terms of the probability $P(S)$ that a signal\ncandidate is of astrophysical origin. We find that, at current levels of\ninstrumental sensitivity, loud signal candidates observed with a single\nAdvanced LIGO detector can be assigned $P(S)\\gtrsim0.4$. In the future,\nAdvanced LIGO may be able to observe single-detector events with confidences\nexceeding $P(S)\\sim90\\%$.\n", "  We operate a resonant exchange qubit in a highly symmetric triple-dot\nconfiguration using IQ-modulated RF pulses. At the resulting three-dimensional\nsweet spot the qubit splitting is an order of magnitude less sensitive to all\nrelevant control voltages, compared to the conventional operating point, but we\nobserve no significant improvement in the quality of Rabi oscillations. For\nweak driving this is consistent with Overhauser field fluctuations modulating\nthe qubit splitting. For strong driving we infer that effective voltage noise\nmodulates the coupling strength between RF drive and the qubit, thereby\nquickening Rabi decay. Application of CPMG dynamical decoupling sequences\nconsisting of up to n = 32 {\\pi} pulses significantly prolongs qubit coherence,\nleading to marginally longer dephasing times in the symmetric configuration.\nThis is consistent with dynamical decoupling from low frequency noise, but\nquantitatively cannot be explained by effective gate voltage noise and\nOverhauser field fluctuations alone. Our results inform recent strategies for\nthe utilization of partial sweet spots in the operation and long-distance\ncoupling of triple-dot qubits.\n", "  The dynamical behavior of networked complex systems is shaped not only by the\ndirect links among the units, but also by the long-range interactions occurring\nthrough the many existing paths connecting the network nodes. In this work, we\nstudy how synchronization dynamics is influenced by these long-range\ninteractions, formulating a model of coupled oscillators that incorporates this\ntype of interactions through the use of $d-$path Laplacian matrices. We study\nsynchronizability of these networks by the analysis of the Laplacian spectra,\nboth theoretically and numerically, for real-world networks and artificial\nmodels. Our analysis reveal that in all networks long-range interactions\nimprove network synchronizability with an impact that depends on the original\nstructure, for instance it is greater for graphs having a larger diameter. We\nalso investigate the effects of edge removal in graphs with long-range\ninteractions and, as a major result, find that the removal process becomes more\ncritical, since also the long-range influence of the removed link disappears.\n", "  We perform a phenomenological study of the invariant mass distribution of\nhadronic jets produced in proton-proton collisions, in conjunction a grooming\nalgorithm. In particular, we consider the modified MassDrop Tagger (mMDT),\nwhich corresponds to Soft Drop with angular exponent $\\beta=0$. Our\ncalculation, which is differential in both jet mass and jet transverse\nmomentum, resums large logarithms of the jet mass, including the full\ndependence on the groomer's energy threshold $z_\\text{cut}$, and it is matched\nto fixed-order QCD matrix elements at next-to-leading order. In order to\naccount for non-perturbative contributions, originating from the hadronisation\nprocess and from the underlying event, we also include a phenomenological\ncorrection factor derived from Monte Carlo parton-shower simulations.\nFurthermore, we consider two different possibilities for the jet transverse\nmomentum: before or after grooming. We show that the former should be preferred\nfor comparisons with upcoming experimental data essentially because the mMDT\ntransverse momentum spectrum is not collinear safe.\n", "  We report neutron diffraction and transport results on the newly discovered\nsuperconducting nitride ThFeAsN with $T_c=$ 30 K. No magnetic transition, but a\nweak structural distortion around 160 K, is observed cooling from 300 K to 6 K.\nAnalysis on the resistivity, Hall transport and crystal structure suggests this\nmaterial behaves as an electron optimally doped pnictide superconductors due to\nextra electrons from nitrogen deficiency or oxygen occupancy at the nitrogen\nsite, which together with the low arsenic height may enhance the electron\nitinerancy and reduce the electron correlations, thus suppress the static\nmagnetic order.\n", "  We utilize silicon-nitride waveguides to self-reference a telecom-wavelength\nfiber frequency comb through supercontinuum generation, using 11.3 mW of\noptical power incident on the chip. This is approximately ten times lower than\nconventional approaches using nonlinear fibers and is enabled by low-loss (<2\ndB) input coupling and the high nonlinearity of silicon nitride, which can\nprovide two octaves of spectral broadening with incident energies of only 110\npJ. Following supercontinuum generation, self-referencing is accomplished by\nmixing 780-nm dispersive-wave light with the frequency-doubled output of the\nfiber laser. In addition, at higher optical powers, we demonstrate f-to-3f\nself-referencing directly from the waveguide output by the interference of\nsimultaneous supercontinuum and third harmonic generation, without the use of\nan external doubling crystal or interferometer. These hybrid comb systems\ncombine the performance of fiber-laser frequency combs with the high\nnonlinearity and compactness of photonic waveguides, and should lead to\nlow-cost, fully stabilized frequency combs for portable and space-borne\napplications.\n", "  We consider a range of model potentials with metastable states undergoing\nmolecular dynamics coupled to a thermal bath in the high friction regime, and\nconsider how the optimal reaction coordinate depends on the diffusion\nanisotropy. For this we use our recently proposed method 'Spectral gap\noptimization of order parameters (SGOOP)' (Tiwary and Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad.\nSci. 113 2839 2016). We show how available information about dynamical\nobservables in addition to static information can be incorporated into SGOOP,\nwhich can then be used to accurately determine the 'best' reaction coordinate\nfor arbitrary anisotropies. We compare our results with transmission\ncoefficient calculations and published benchmarks where applicable or available\nrespectively.\n", "  Quantum magnetic phases near the magnetic saturation of triangular-lattice\nantiferromagnets with XXZ anisotropy have been attracting renewed interest\nsince it has been suggested that a nontrivial coplanar phase, called the\n$\\pi$-coplanar or $\\Psi$ phase, could be stabilized by quantum effects in a\ncertain range of anisotropy parameter $J/J_z$ besides the well-known 0-coplanar\n(known also as $V$) and umbrella phases. Recently, Sellmann $et$ $al$. [Phys.\nRev. B {\\bf 91}, 081104(R) (2015)] claimed that the $\\pi$-coplanar phase is\nabsent for $S=1/2$ from an exact-diagonalization analysis in the sector of the\nHilbert space with only three down-spins (three magnons). We first reconsider\nand improve this analysis by taking into account several low-lying eigenvalues\nand the associated eigenstates as a function of $J/J_z$ and by sensibly\nincreasing the system sizes (up to 1296 spins). A careful identification\nanalysis shows that the lowest eigenstate is a chirally antisymmetric\ncombination of finite-size umbrella states for $J/J_z\\gtrsim 2.218$ while it\ncorresponds to a coplanar phase for $J/J_z\\lesssim 2.218$. However, we\ndemonstrate that the distinction between 0-coplanar and $\\pi$-coplanar phases\nin the latter region is fundamentally impossible from the symmetry-preserving\nfinite-size calculations with fixed magnon number.} Therefore, we also perform\na cluster mean-field plus scaling analysis for small spins $S\\leq 3/2$. The\nobtained results, together with the previous large-$S$ analysis, indicate that\nthe $\\pi$-coplanar phase exists for any $S$ except for the classical limit\n($S\\rightarrow \\infty$) and the existence range in $J/J_z$ is largest in the\nmost quantum case of $S=1/2$.\n", "  We make projections for measuring the black hole birth rate from the diffuse\nsupernova neutrino background (DSNB) by future neutrino experiments, and\nconstrain the black hole merger fraction $\\epsilon$, when combined with\ninformation on the black hole merger rate from gravitational wave experiments\nsuch as LIGO. The DSNB originates from neutrinos emitted by all the supernovae\nin the Universe, and is expected to be made up of two components: neutrinos\nfrom neutron-star-forming supernovae, and a sub-dominant component at higher\nenergies from black-hole-forming \"unnovae\". We perform a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo analysis of simulated data of the DSNB in an experiment similar to\nHyper-Kamiokande, focusing on this second component. Since all knowledge of the\nneutrino emission from unnovae comes from simulations of collapsing stars, we\nchoose two sets of priors: one where the unnovae are well-understood and one\nwhere their neutrino emission is poorly known. By combining the black hole\nbirth rate from the DSNB with projected measurements of the black hole merger\nrate from LIGO, we show that the fraction of black holes which lead to binary\nmergers observed today $\\epsilon$ could be constrained to be within the range\n$2 \\cdot 10^{-4} \\leq \\epsilon \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^{-2}$ at $3 \\sigma$ confidence,\nafter ten years of running an experiment like Hyper-Kamiokande.\n", "  The optical selection rules for inter-band transitions in WSe2, WS2 and MoSe2\ntransition metal dichalcogenide monolayers are investigated by\npolarization-resolved photoluminescence experiments with a signal collection\nfrom the sample edge. These measurements reveal a strong\npolarization-dependence of the emission lines. We see clear signatures of the\nemitted light with the electric field oriented perpendicular to the monolayer\nplane, corresponding to an inter-band optical transition forbidden at normal\nincidence used in standard optical spectroscopy measurements. The experimental\nresults are in agreement with the optical selection rules deduced from group\ntheory analysis, highlighting the key role played by the different symmetries\nof the conduction and valence bands split by the spin-orbit interaction. These\nstudies yield a direct determination on the bright-dark exciton splitting, for\nwhich we measure 40 $\\pm 1$ meV and 55 $\\pm 2$ meV for WSe2 and WS2 monolayer,\nrespectively.\n", "  We employ an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) holographic model, which is known\nto be in good agreement with lattice results for the QCD equation of state with\n$(2+1)$ flavors and physical quark masses, to investigate the temperature and\nbaryon chemical potential dependence of the susceptibilities, conductivities,\nand diffusion coefficients associated with baryon, electric, and strangeness\nconserved charges. We also determine how the bulk and shear viscosities of the\nplasma vary in the plane of temperature and baryon chemical potential. The\ndiffusion of conserved charges and the hydrodynamic viscosities in a baryon\nrich quark-gluon plasma are found to be suppressed with respect to the zero net\nbaryon case. The transition temperatures associated with equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium quantities are determined as a function of the baryon chemical\npotential for the first time. Because of the crossover nature of the QCD phase\ntransition even at moderately large values of the chemical potential, we find\nthat the transition temperatures associated with different quantities are\nspread in the interval between $130-200$ MeV and they all decrease with\nincreasing baryon chemical potential.\n", "  In atomic force microscopy (AFM), the angle relative to the vertical\n($\\theta_{i}$) that the tip apex of a cantilever moves is determined by the\ntilt of the probe holder and the geometries of the cantilever and actuated\neigenmode $i$. Even though the effects of $\\theta_{i}$ on static and\nsingle-frequency AFM are known (increased effective spring constant,\nsensitivity to sample anisotropy, etc), the higher eigenmodes used in\nmultifrequency force microscopy lead to additional effects that have not been\nfully explored. Here we use Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate\nhow $\\theta_{i}$ affects not only the signal amplitude and phase, but can also\nlead to behaviors such as destabilization of the KPFM voltage feedback loop. We\nfind that longer cantilevers and modified sample orientations improve voltage\nfeedback loop stability, even though variations to scanning parameters such as\ncantilever shake amplitude and lift height do not.\n", "  The physical analysis of generic phase coexistence in the North-East-Center\nToom model was originally given by Bennett and Grinstein. The gist of their\nargument relies on the dynamics of interfaces and droplets. We revisit the same\nquestion for a specific totally asymmetric kinetic Ising model on the square\nlattice. This nonequilibrium model possesses the remarkable property that its\nstationary-state measure in the absence of a magnetic field coincides with that\nof the usual ferromagnetic Ising model. We use both analytical arguments and\nnumerical simulations in order to make progress in the quantitative\nunderstanding of the phenomenon of generic phase coexistence. At zero\ntemperature a mapping onto the TASEP allows an exact determination of the\ntime-dependent shape of the ballistic interface sweeping a large square\nminority droplet of up or down spins. At finite temperature, measuring the mean\nlifetime of such a droplet allows an accurate measurement of its shrinking\nvelocity $v$, which depends on temperature $T$ and magnetic field $h$. In the\nabsence of a magnetic field, $v$ vanishes with an exponent\n$\\Delta_v\\approx2.5\\pm0.2$ as the critical temperature $T_c$ is approached. At\nfixed temperature in the ordered phase, $v$ vanishes at the phase-boundary\nfields $\\pm h_{\\rm b}(T)$ which mark the limits of the coexistence region. The\nlatter fields vanish with an exponent $\\Delta_h\\approx3.2\\pm0.3$ as $T_c$ is\napproached.\n", "  Finding the optimal encoding strategies can be challenging for communication\nusing quantum channels, as classical and quantum capacities may be\nsuperadditive. Entanglement assistance can often simplify this task, as the\nentanglement-assisted classical capacity for any channel is additive, making\nentanglement across channel uses unnecessary. If the entanglement assistance is\nlimited, the picture is much more unclear. Suppose the classical capacity is\nsuperadditive, then the classical capacity with limited entanglement assistance\ncould retain superadditivity by continuity arguments. If the classical capacity\nis additive, it is unknown if superadditivity can still be developed with\nlimited entanglement assistance. We show this is possible, by providing an\nexample. We construct a channel for which, the classical capacity is additive,\nbut that with limited entanglement assistance can be superadditive. This shows\nentanglement plays a weird role in communication and we still understand very\nlittle about it.\n", "  We elucidate the pivotal role of the bandstructure's orbital content in\ndeciding the type of commensurate magnetic order stabilized within the\nitinerant scenario of iron-pnictides. Recent experimental findings in the\ntetragonal magnetic phase attest to the existence of the so-called charge and\nspin ordered density wave over the spin-vortex crystal phase, the latter of\nwhich tends to be favored in simplified band models of itinerant magnetism.\nHere we show that employing a multiorbital itinerant Landau approach based on\nrealistic bandstructures can account for the experimentally observed magnetic\nphase, and thus shed light on the importance of the orbital content in deciding\nthe magnetic order. In addition, we remark that the presence of a hole pocket\ncentered at the Brillouin zone's ${\\rm M}$-point favors a magnetic stripe\nrather than a tetragonal magnetic phase. For inferring the symmetry properties\nof the different magnetic phases, we formulate our theory in terms of magnetic\norder parameters transforming according to irreducible representations of the\nensuing D$_{\\rm 4h}$ point group. The latter method not only provides\ntransparent understanding of the symmetry breaking schemes but also reveals\nthat the leading instabilities always belong to the $\\{A_{1g},B_{1g}\\}$ subset\nof irreducible representations, independent of their C$_2$ or C$_4$ nature.\n", "  Localised turbulent structures such as puffs or oblique stripes are building\nblocks of the intermittency regimes in subcritical wall-bounded shear flows.\nThese turbulent structures are investigated in incompressible pressure-driven\nannular pipe flow using direct numerical simulations in long domains. For low\nenough radius ratio $\\eta$, these coherent structures have a dynamics\ncomparable to that of puffs in cylindrical pipe flow. For $\\eta$ larger than\n0.5, they take the shape of helical stripes inclined with respect to the axial\ndirection. The transition from puffs to stripes is analysed statistically by\nfocusing on the axisymmetry properties of the associated large-scale flows. It\nis shown that the transition is gradual : as the azimuthal confinement relaxes,\nallowing for an azimuthal large-scale component, oblique stripes emerge as\npredicted in the planar limit. The generality of this transition mechanism is\ndiscussed in the context of subcritical shear flows.\n", "  This article is a review by the authors concerning the construction of a\nPoincar${\\rm \\acute{e}}$ covariant (owing to spacetime continuum)\nfield-theoretic formalism in terms of step-function-type basis functions\nwithout ultraviolet divergences. This formalism analytically derives\nconfinement/deconfinement, mass-gap and Regge trajectory for non-Abelian gauge\nfields, and gives solutions for self-interacting scalar fields. Fields\npropagate in spacetime continuum and fields with finite degrees of freedom\ntoward continuum limit have no ultraviolet divergence. Basis functions defined\nin a parameter spacetime are mapped to real spacetime. The authors derive a new\nsolution comprised of classical fields as a vacuum and quantum fluctuations,\nleading to the linear potential between the particle and antiparticle from the\nWilson loop. The Polyakov line gives finite binding energies and reveals the\ndeconfining property at high temperatures. The quantum action yields positive\nmass from the classical fields and quantum fluctuations produces the Coulomb\npotential. Pure Yang-Mills fields show the same mass-gap owing to the\nparticle-antiparticle pair creation. The Dirac equation under linear potential\nis analytically solved in this formalism, reproducing the principal properties\nof Regge trajectories at a quantum level. Further outlook mentions a\npossibility of the difference between conventional continuum and present wave\nfunctions responsible for the cosmological constant.\n", "  We consider the relaxation of a uniform current in a planar 2D conductor with\naccount taken of electromagnetic retardation effects. If the 2D conductivity is\nlarger than the speed of light, the straightforward solution for an infinite\nplane gives a negative relaxation rate. However if one starts from a conducting\ncylinder of finite radius and then increases it to infinity, the relaxation\nrate just tends to zero while remaining positive. We suggest that recent\nunusual plasmon-dispersion curves obtained by V. A. Volkov and A. A.\nZabolotnykh [arXiv:1605.00430] result from the incorrect finite-to-infinite\ntransition.\n", "  We perform a maximum likelihood kinematic analysis of the two dynamically\nrelaxed galaxy clusters MACS J1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$ and RXC J2248.7-4431 at\n$z=0.35$ to determine the total mass profile in modified gravity models, using\na modified version of the MAMPOSSt code of Mamon, Biviano and Bou\\'e. Our work\nis based on the kinematic and lensing mass profiles derived using the data from\nthe Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (hereafter CLASH) and the\nspectroscopic follow-up with the Very Large Telescope (hereafter CLASH-VLT). We\nassume a spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW hereafter) profile in order to\nobtain a constraint on the fifth force interaction range $\\lambda$ for models\nin which the dependence of this parameter on the enviroment is negligible at\nthe scale considered (i.e. $\\lambda=const$) and fixing the fifth force strength\nto the value predicted in $f(R)$ gravity. We then use information from lensing\nanalysis to put a prior on the other NFW free parameters. In the case of MACSJ\n1206 the joint kinematic+lensing analysis leads to an upper limit on the\neffective interaction range $\\lambda\\le1.61\\,\\mbox{Mpc}$ at\n$\\Delta\\chi^{2}=2.71$ on the marginalized distribution. For RXJ 2248 instead a\npossible tension with the $\\Lambda$CDM model appears when adding lensing\ninformation, with a lower limit $\\lambda\\ge0.14\\,\\mbox{Mpc}$ at\n$\\Delta\\chi^{2}=2.71$. This is consequence of the slight difference between the\nlensing and kinematic data, appearing in GR for this cluster, that could be\nexplained in terms of modifications of gravity. We discuss the impact of\nsystematics and the limits of our analysis as well as future improvements of\nthe results obtained.[...]\n", "  We show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a class of BPS electrically\ncharged rotating black holes in AdS$_5\\times S^5$ can be obtained by a simple\nextremization principle. We expect that this extremization corresponds to the\nattractor mechanism for BPS rotating black holes in five-dimensional gauged\nsupergravity, which is still unknown. The expression to be extremized has a\nsuggestive resemblance to anomaly polynomials and the supersymmetric Casimir\nenergy recently studied for $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills.\n", "  Various estimates of the even-odd effect of the mass shell of atomic nuclei\nare considered. Based on the experimental mass values of the Ca, Sn, and Pb\nisotopes, the dependence of the energy gap on the neutrons number is traced and\nthe relationship of this characteristic to the properties of external neutron\nsubshells is shown. In nuclei with closed proton shells, effects directly\nrelated to neutron pairing and effects of nucleon shells are discussed.\n", "  Using the Fixed Center Approximation to Faddeev equations we have\ninvestigated the $DKK$ and $DK\\bar{K}$ three-body systems, considering that the\n$DK$ dynamically generates, through its $I=0$ component, the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$\nmolecule. According to our findings, for $DK\\bar{K}$ interaction we have found\nan evidence of a state $I(J^P)=1/2(0^-)$ just above the $D^*_{s0}(2317)\\bar{K}$\nthreshold and around the $Df_0(980)$ thresholds, with mass about $2833 - 2858$\nMeV, made mostly of $Df_0(980)$. On the other hand, no evidence related to a\nstate from the $DKK$ interaction is found. The state found could be seen in the\n$\\pi \\pi D$ invariant mass.\n", "  We report a systematic crystal growth and characterization of\nCa$_{1-y}$La$_{y}$Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$As$_{2}$, the newly discovered 112-type\niron-based superconductor. After substituting Fe by a small amount of Ni, bulk\nsuperconductivity is successfully obtained in high quality single crystals\nsized up to 6 mm. Resistivity measurements indicate common features for\ntransport properties in this 112-type iron pnictide, suggest strong scattering\nfrom chemical dopants. Together with the superconducting transition temperature\n$T_c$, and the Neel temperature $T_N$ determined by the elastic neutron\nscattering, we sketch a three-dimensional phase diagram in the combination of\nboth Ni and La dopings.\n", "  The electromagnetic field correlators are evaluated around a cosmic string in\nbackground of $(D+1)$-dimensional dS spacetime assuming that the field is\nprepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state. The correlators are presented in the\ndecomposed form where the string-induced topological parts are explicitly\nextracted. With this decomposition, the renormalization of the local vacuum\nexpectation values (VEVs) in the coincidence limit is reduced to the one for dS\nspacetime in the absence of the cosmic string. The VEVs of the squared electric\nand magnetic fields, and of the vacuum energy density are investigated. Near\nthe string they are dominated by the topological contributions and the effects\ninduced by the background gravitational field are small. In this region, the\nleading terms in the topological contributions are obtained from the\ncorresponding VEVs for a string on the Minkowski bulk multiplying by the\nconformal factor. At distances from the string larger than the curvature radius\nof the background geometry, the pure dS parts in the VEVs dominate. In this\nregion, for spatial dimensions $D>3$, the influence of the gravitational field\non the topological contributions is crucial and the corresponding behavior is\nessentially different from that for a cosmic string on the Minkowski bulk.\nThere are well-motivated inflationary models which produce cosmic strings. We\nargue that, as a consequence of the quantum-to-classical transition of\nsuper-Hubble electromagnetic fluctuations during inflation, in the\npostinflationary era these strings will be surrounded by large scale stochastic\nmagnetic fields. These fields could be among the distinctive features of the\ncosmic strings produced during the inflation and also of the corresponding\ninflationary models.\n", "  The jet compositions, central engines, and progenitors of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) remain open questions in GRB physics. Applying broadband observations,\nincluding GRB prompt emission and afterglow properties derived from {\\em Fermi}\nand {\\em Swift} data, as well as from Keck host-galaxy observations, we address\nthese questions for the peculiar, bright GRB 110731A. By using the pair-opacity\nmethod, we derive $\\Gamma_{0}>190$ during the prompt emission phase.\nAlternatively, we derive $\\Gamma_{0} \\approx 580$ and $\\Gamma_{0} \\approx 154$\nby invoking the early-afterglow phase within the homogeneous density and wind\ncases, respectively. On the other hand, nondetection of a thermal component in\nthe spectra suggests that the prompt emission is likely powered by dissipation\nof a Poynting-flux-dominated jet leading to synchrotron radiation in an\noptically thin region. The nondetection of a jet break in the X-ray and optical\nbands allows us to place a lower limit on the jet opening angle $\\theta_{\\rm\nj}>5.5^{\\circ}$. Within a millisecond magnetar central engine scenario, we\nderive the period $P_{0}$ and polar magnetic field strength $B_{\\rm p}$, which\nhave extreme (but still allowed) values. The moderately short observed duration\n(7.3\\,s) and relatively large redshift ($z=2.83$) places the burst as a\n\"rest-frame short\" GRB, so the progenitor of the burst is subject to debate.\nIts relatively large $f_{{\\rm eff}, z}$ parameter (ratio of the 1\\,s peak flux\nof a pseudo-GRB and the background flux) and a large physical offset from a\npotential host galaxy suggest that the progenitor of GRB 110731A may be a\ncompact-star merger.\n", "  General expressions for the R\\'enyi entropies and central charges for higher\nderivative free spinors and scalars on even spheres are obtained using a direct\nspectral method on a compact lune division of the sphere. Formulae and numbers\nare rapidly obtained for any dimension and order of derivative.\n  The relation between the conformal anomaly and the hyperbolic free energy is\nbriefly explored using standard expansions.\n  A field theoretic derivation of the central charge formula for higher\nderivative scalars in any (even) dimension, given by Osborn and Stergiou and by\nGliozzi {\\it et al}, is thereby provided. The corresponding extension to\nspinors is made.\n  Generalised Bernoulli polynomials play an important technical role.\n", "  We present a $D$-dimensional charged Anti-de-Sitter black hole solutions in\n$f(T)$ gravity, where $f(T)=T+\\beta T^2$ and $D \\geq 4$. These solutions are\ncharacterized by flat or cylindrical horizons. The interesting feature of these\nsolutions is the existence of inseparable electric monopole and quadrupole\nterms in the potential which share related momenta, in contrast with most of\nthe known charged black hole solutions in General Relativity and its\nextensions. Furthermore, these solutions have curvature singularities which are\nmilder than those of the known charged black hole solutions in General\nRelativity and Teleparallel Gravity. This feature can be shown by calculating\nsome invariants of curvature and torsion tensors. Furthermore, we calculate the\ntotal energy of these black holes using the energy-momentum tensor. Finally, we\nshow that these charged black hole solutions violate the first law of\nthermodynamics in agreement with previous results.\n", "  `Galaxy groups' have hardly been realised as a separate class of objects with\nspecific characteristics in the structural hierarchy. The presumption that the\nself-similarity of dark matter structures is a valid prescription for the\nbaryonic universe at all scales has rendered smaller structures undetectable by\ncurrent observational facilities, leading to lesser dedicated studies on them.\nSome recent reports that indicate a deviation from $\\rm{L_x}$-T scaling in\ngroups compared to clusters have motivated us to study their physical\nproperties in depth. In this article, we report the extensive study on physical\nproperties of groups in comparison to the clusters through cosmological\nhydrodynamic plus N-body simulations using ENZO 2.2 code. As additional\nphysics, radiative cooling, heating due to supernova and star motions, star\nformation and stellar feedback has been implemented. We have produced a mock\nsample of 362 objects with mass ranging from $5\\times10^{12}\\; \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$\nto 2.5$\\times 10^{15}\\; \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$. Strikingly, we have found that objects\nwith mass below $\\sim$ $8\\times 10^{13}\\;\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ do not follow any of\nthe cluster self-similar laws in hydrostatics, not even in thermal and\nnon-thermal energies. Two distinct scaling laws are observed to be followed\nwith breaks at $\\sim$ $8\\times 10^{13}\\;\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ for mass, $\\sim$1 keV\nfor temperature and $\\sim$1 Mpc for radius. This places groups as a distinct\nentity in the hierarchical structures, well demarcated from clusters. This\nstudy reveals that groups are mostly far away from virialization, suggesting\nthe need for formulating new models for deciphering their physical parameters.\nThey are also shown to have high turbulence and more non-thermal energy stored,\nindicating better visibility in the non-thermal regime.\n", "  We explore the notion of the quantum auxiliary linear problem and the\nassociated problem of quantum Backlund transformations (BT). In this context we\nsystematically construct the analogue of the classical formula that provides\nthe whole hierarchy of the time components of Lax pairs at the quantum level\nfor both closed and open integrable lattice models. The generic time evolution\noperator formula is particularly interesting and novel at the quantum level\nwhen dealing with systems with open boundary conditions. In the same frame we\nshow that the reflection K-matrix can also be viewed as a particular type of\nBT, fixed at the boundaries of the system. The q-oscillator (q-boson) model, a\nvariant of the Ablowitz-Ladik model, is then employed as a paradigm to\nillustrate the method. Particular emphasis is given to the time part of the\nquantum BT as possible connections and applications to the problem of quantum\nquenches as well as the time evolution of local quantum impurities are evident.\nA discussion on the use of Bethe states as well as coherent states for the\nstudy of the time evolution is also presented.\n", "  Lattice thermal conductivity of Cu$_2$O was studied using ab initio density\nfunctional methods. The performance of generalized gradient approximation,\nGGA-PBE, and PBE0 exchange-correlation functionals was compared for various\nelectronic and phonon-related properties. 3d transition metal oxides such as\nCu$_2$O are known to be a challenging case for pure GGA functionals and in\ncomparison to GGA-PBE the PBE0 hybrid functional clearly improves the\ndescription of both electronic and phonon-related properties. The most striking\ndifference is found in the lattice thermal conductivity, where GGA\nunderestimates it as much as 40% in comparison to experiment, while the\ndifference between the experiment and the PBE0 hybrid functional is only a few\npercent.\n", "  We provide the first quantum (exact) protocol for the Dining Philosophers\nproblem (DP), a central problem in distributed algorithms. It is well known\nthat the problem cannot be solved exactly in the classical setting. We then use\nour DP protocol to provide a new quantum protocol for the tightly related\nproblem of exact leader election (LE) on a ring, improving significantly in\nboth time and memory complexity over the known LE protocol by Tani et. al. To\ndo this, we show that in some sense the exact DP and exact LE problems are\nequivalent; interestingly, in the classical non-exact setting they are not.\nHopefully, the results will lead to exact quantum protocols for other important\ndistributed algorithmic questions; in particular, we discuss interesting\nconnections to the ring size problem, as well as to a physically motivated\nquestion of breaking symmetry in 1D translationally invariant systems.\n", "  We present a simple, yet general, end-to-end deep neural network\nrepresentation of the potential energy surface for atomic and molecular\nsystems. This methodology, which we call Deep Potential, is \"first-principle\"\nbased, in the sense that no ad hoc approximations or empirical fitting\nfunctions are required. The neural network structure naturally respects the\nunderlying symmetries of the systems. When tested on a wide variety of\nexamples, Deep Potential is able to reproduce the original model, whether\nempirical or quantum mechanics based, within chemical accuracy. The\ncomputational cost of this new model is not substantially larger than that of\nempirical force fields. In addition, the method has promising scalability\nproperties. This brings us one step closer to being able to carry out molecular\nsimulations with accuracy comparable to that of quantum mechanics models and\ncomputational cost comparable to that of empirical potentials.\n", "  At the lower edge of the energy continuum the birth of an isolated quantum\nbound state is studied as caused by an infinitesimally small change of the\ninteraction. In our model a single, asymptotically free massive quantum\nparticle is assumed moving along a discretized real line of coordinates, $x \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}$. The motion is assumed controlled by a weakly nonlocal\n2J-parametric external potential which is non-Hermitian but PT-symmetric.\nMathematically, the bound states are then reinterpreted as Sturmians, i.e., the\nbound-state energy is treated as a variable real parameter while the value of\none of the couplings (responsible for the existence of the bound state) is\ndetermined via the standard secular equation. It is found that in such an\narrangement the model is exactly solvable at all of the finite counts J of the\ncouplings. For illustration, the explicit closed bound-state formulae are\npresented up to J=7.\n", "  We consider pure states in the SYK model. These are given by a simple local\ncondition on the Majorana fermions, evolved over an interval in Euclidean time\nto project on to low energy states. We find that \"diagonal\" correlators are\nexactly the same as thermal correlators at leading orders in the large $N$\nexpansion. We also describe \"off diagonal\" correlators that decay in time, and\nare given simply in terms of thermal correlators. We also solved the model\nnumerically for low values of $N$ and noticed that subsystems become typically\nentangled after an interaction time. In addition, we identified configurations\nin two dimensional nearly-$AdS_2$ gravity with similar symmetries. These\ngravity configurations correspond to states with regions behind horizons. The\nregion behind the horizon can be made accessible by modifying the Hamiltonian\nof the boundary theory using the the knowledge of the particular microstate.\nThe set of microstates in the SYK theory with these properties generates the\nfull Hilbert space.\n", "  Fluctuation magnetoconductivity and magnetization above the superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc) are measured on the recently discovered 112 family\nof iron-based superconductors (IBS), Ca$_{1-x}$La$_x$Fe$_{1-y}$Ni$_y$As$_2$,\nwhich presents an extra As-As chain spacer-layer. The analysis in terms of a\ngeneralization of the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) approach to finite applied magnetic\nfields indicates that these compounds are among the most anisotropic IBS\n($\\gamma$ up to ~30), and provides a compelling evidence of a\nquasi-two-dimensional behavior for doping levels near the optimal one.\n", "  In the lightly bound Skyrme model, several Skyrmions having particularly\nstrong binding are clusters of unit baryon number Skyrmions arranged as\ntruncated tetrahedra. Their baryon numbers form the sequence B = 4, 16, 40, 80,\n140, 224. This is the standard sequence of tetrahedral numbers multiplied by\nfour, and therefore agrees with the sequence of magic proton and neutron\nnumbers 2, 8, 20, 40, 70, 112 that occurs in the nuclear shell model in the\nabsence of strong spin-orbit coupling. This sequence includes several of the\nmagic numbers that are predicted for tetrahedrally deformed nuclei, and also\nappears in the context of the FCC lattice geometry investigated long ago by\nWigner and revived more recently.\n", "  Microtubules (MTs) are filamentous protein polymers roughly 25 nm in\ndiameter. Ubiquitous in eukaryotes, MTs are well known for their structural\nrole but also act as actuators, sensors, and, in association with other\nproteins, checkpoint regulators. The thin diameter and transparency of\nmicrotubules classifies them as sub-resolution phase objects, with concomitant\nimaging challenges. Label-free methods for imaging microtubules are preferred\nwhen long exposure times would lead to phototoxicity in fluorescence, or for\nretaining more native structure and activity.\n  This method approaches quantitative phase imaging of MTs as an inverse\nproblem based on the Transport of Intensity Equation. In a co-registered\ncomparison of MT signal-to-background-noise ratio, TIE Microscopy of MTs shows\nan improvement of more than three times that of video-enhanced bright field\nimaging.\n  This method avoids the anisotropy caused by prisms used in differential\ninterference contrast and takes only two defocused images as input. Unlike\nother label-free techniques for imaging microtubules, in TIE microscopy\nbackground removal is a natural consequence of taking the difference of two\ndefocused images, so the need to frequently update a background image is\neliminated.\n", "  In this brief review, we discuss the role that quantum correlations, as\nquantified by quantum discord, play in two interesting settings. The first one\nis discerning which unitaries have been applied on a quantum system, by taking\nadvantage of knowledge regarding its initial configuration. Here discord\ncaptures the \"quantum\" component of this knowledge, useful only when we have\naccess to a quantum memory. In particular, discord can be used to detect\nwhether an untrusted party has certain quantum capabilities. The second setting\nis quantum cryptography. Here discord represents an important resource for\ntrusted-noise quantum key distribution and also provides a general upper bound\nfor the optimal secret key rates that are achievable by ideal protocols. In\nparticular, the (two-way assisted) secret key capacity of a lossy bosonic\nchannel exactly coincides with the maximum discord that can be distributed\nbetween the remote parties at the two ends of the channel.\n", "  Learning cooperative policies for multi-agent systems is often challenged by\npartial observability and a lack of coordination. In some settings, the\nstructure of a problem allows a distributed solution with limited\ncommunication. Here, we consider a scenario where no communication is\navailable, and instead we learn local policies for all agents that collectively\nmimic the solution to a centralized multi-agent static optimization problem.\nOur main contribution is an information theoretic framework based on rate\ndistortion theory which facilitates analysis of how well the resulting fully\ndecentralized policies are able to reconstruct the optimal solution. Moreover,\nthis framework provides a natural extension that addresses which nodes an agent\nshould communicate with to improve the performance of its individual policy.\n", "  Quantum gravity that describes the world beyond the Planck scale should be\nformulated in a background-metric independent manner. Such a background-free\nnature can be represented as a gauge equivalency under conformal\ntransformations, called the BRST conformal symmetry. In this review, we present\nquantum field theories of gravity with such symmetry. Since we can choose any\nbackground owing to this symmetry as far as it is conformally flat, we here\nemploy the cylindrical background. First, we briefly review the famous BRST\nLiouville-Virasoro algebra in 2D quantum gravity on $R \\times S^1$. We then\npresent recent developments of the BRST conformal algebra and physical states\nof 4D quantum gravity on $R \\times S^3$ whose conformal-factor dynamics is\nruled by the Riegert's Wess-Zumino action, which arises in the UV limit of the\nrenormalizable quantum conformal gravity with the \"asymptotic background\nfreedom\". We find that the BRST conformal invariance makes all physical states\nreal and scalar as well as all negative-metric modes unphysical.\n  We also briefly discuss the dynamics of how the conformal invariance breaks\ndown and how our classical spacetime emerges at low energies, in which a novel\ninterpretation of the \"minimal length\" we can measure comes out without\ndiscretizing spacetime.\n", "  We have constructed a nuclear equation of state (EOS) that includes a full\nnuclear ensemble for use in core-collapse supernova simulations. It is based on\nthe EOS for uniform nuclear matter that two of the authors derived recently,\napplying a variational method to realistic two- and there-body nuclear forces.\nWe utilize an extended liquid drop model of heavy nuclei and a\nquantum-theoretical mass evaluation for light nuclei. In addition to realistic\nnuclear forces, the inclusion of in-medium effects on the full ensemble of\nnuclei makes the new EOS one of the most realistic EOS's for supernova\nsimulations. We make comparisons with the FYSS EOS, which is based on the same\nformulation for the nuclear ensemble but adopts the relativistic mean field\n(RMF) theory with the TM1 parameter set for uniform nuclear matter. The new EOS\nis softer than the FYSS EOS around and above nuclear saturation densities. We\nfind that neutron-rich nuclei with small mass numbers are more abundant in the\nnew EOS than in the FYSS EOS because of the larger saturation densities and\nsmaller symmetry energy of nuclei in the former. We apply the two EOS's to 1D\nsupernova simulations and find that the new EOS gives lower electron fractions\nand higher temperatures in the collapse phase owing to the smaller symmetry\nenergy. As a result, the inner core has smaller masses for the new EOS. It is\nmore compact, on the other hand, due to the softness of the new EOS and bounces\nat higher densities. The ensuing outward propagations of the shock wave in the\nouter core are very similar in the two simulations, which may be an artifact,\nthough, caused by the use of the same tabulated electron capture rates for\nheavy nuclei ignoring differences in the nuclear composition between the two\nEOS's in these computations.\n", "  Unlike the widely studied ReFeAsO series, the newly discovered iron-based\nsuperconductor ThFeAsN exhibits a remarkably high critical temperature of 30 K,\nwithout chemical doping or external pressure. Here we investigate in detail its\nmagnetic and superconducting properties via muon-spin rotation/relaxation\n($\\mu$SR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and show that ThFeAsN\nexhibits strong magnetic fluctuations, suppressed below 35 K, but no magnetic\norder. This contrasts strongly with the ReFeAsO series, where stoichiometric\nparent materials order antiferromagnetically and superconductivity appears only\nupon doping. The ThFeAsN case indicates that Fermi-surface modifications due to\nstructural distortions and correlation effects are as important as doping in\ninducing superconductivity. The direct competition between antiferromagnetism\nand superconductivity, which in ThFeAsN (as in LiFeAs) occurs at already zero\ndoping, may indicate a significant deviation of the $s$-wave superconducting\ngap in this compound from the standard $s^{\\pm}$ scenario.\n", "  Glass formers exhibit a viscoelastic behavior: at the laboratory timescale,\nthey behave like (glassy) solids at low temperatures, and like liquids at high\ntemperatures. Based on this observation, elastic models relate the long time\nsupercooled dynamics to short time elastic properties of the supercooled\nliquid. In the present work, we assess the validity of elastic models for the\nshear viscosity and the $\\alpha$-relaxation time of supercooled water, using\nmolecular dynamics simulations with the TIP4P/2005f force field over a wide\nrange of temperatures. We show that elastic models provide a good description\nof supercooled water dynamics. For the viscosity, two different regimes are\nobserved and the crossover temperature is found to be close to the one where\nthe Stokes-Einstein relation starts to be violated. Our simulations show that\nonly shear properties are important to characterize the effective flow\nactivation energy. This study calls for experimental determination of the high\nfrequency elastic properties of water at low temperatures.\n", "  We consider the boundary value problem of the stationary transport equation\nin the slab domain of general dimensions. In this paper, we discuss the\nrelation between discontinuity of the incoming boundary data and that of the\nsolution to the stationary transport equation. We introduce two conditions\nposed on the boundary data so that discontinuity of the boundary data\npropagates along positive characteristic lines as that of the solution to the\nstationary transport equation. Our analysis does not depend on the celebrated\nvelocity averaging lemma, which is different from previous works. We also\nintroduce an example in two dimensional case which shows that piecewise\ncontinuity of the boundary data is not a sufficient condition for the main\nresult.\n", "  In this review article, we show our recent results relating to the undoped\n(Ce-free) superconductivity in the electron-doped high-Tc cuprates with the\nso-called T' structure. For an introduction, we briefly mention the\ncharacteristics of the electron-doped T'-cuprates, including the reduction\nannealing, conventional phase diagram and undoped superconductivity. Then, our\ntransport and magnetic results and results relating to the superconducting\npairing symmetry of the undoped and underdoped T'-cuprates are shown.\nCollaborating spectroscopic and nuclear magnetic resonance results are also\nshown briefly. It has been found that, through the reduction annealing, a\nstrongly localized state of carriers accompanied by an antiferromagnetic\npseudogap in the as-grown samples changes to a metallic and superconducting\nstate with a short-range magnetic order in the reduced superconducting samples.\nThe formation of the short-range magnetic order due to a very small amount of\nexcess oxygen in the reduced superconducting samples suggests that the\nT'-cuprates exhibiting the undoped superconductivity in the parent compounds\nare regarded as strongly correlated electron systems, as well as the hole-doped\nhigh-Tc cuprates. We show our proposed electronic structure model to understand\nthe undoped superconductivity. Finally, unsolved future issues of the\nT'-cuprates are discussed.\n", "  A new type of neutron detector, named Stack Structure Solid organic\nScintillator (S$^4$), consisting of multi-layer plastic scintillators with\ncapability to suppress low-energy $\\gamma$ rays under high-counting rate has\nbeen constructed and tested. To achieve $\\it{n}$-$\\gamma$ discrimination, we\nexploit the difference in the ranges of the secondary charged particles\nproduced by the interactions of neutrons and $\\gamma$ rays in the scintillator\nmaterial. The thickness of a plastic scintillator layer was determined based on\nthe results of Monte Carlo simulations using the Geant4 toolkit. With layer\nthicknesses of 5 mm, we have achieved a good separation between neutrons and\n$\\gamma$ rays at 5 MeV$_{\\rm ee}$ threshold setting. We have also determined\nthe detection efficiencies using monoenergetic neutrons at two energies\nproduced by the $\\it{d}$+$\\it{d}\\to\\it{n}$+$^{3}$He reaction. The results agree\nwell with the Geant4 simulations implementing the Li$\\grave{\\rm e}$ge\nIntranuclear Cascade hadronic model (INCL++) and the high-precision model of\nlow-energy neutron interactions (NeutronHP).\n", "  Three dimensional (3D) fast (< 0.5 hour) printing of micro-optical elements\ndown to sub-wavelength resolution over 100 micrometers footprint areas using\nfemtosecond (fs-)laser oscillator is presented. Using sub-1 nJ pulse energies,\noptical vortex generators made of polymerised grating segments with an\nazimuthally changing orientation have been fabricated in SZ2080 resist; width\nof polymerised rods was ~150 nm and period 0.6-1 micrometers. Detailed phase\nretardance analysis was carried out manually with Berek compensator (under a\nwhite light illumination) and using an equivalent principle by an automated\nAbrio implementation at 546 nm. Direct experimental measurements of retardance\nwas required since the period of the grating was comparable (or larger) than\nthe wavelength of visible light. By gold sputtering, transmission-type optical\nvortex generators were turned into reflective ones with augmented retardance,\nn.h defined by the form birefringence, n, and the height h = 2d where d is the\nthickness of the polymerised structure. Retardance reached 315 nm as measured\nwith Berek compensator at visible wavelengths. Birefringent phase delays of 180\ndegrees (or half-wavelength) required for high purity vortex generators can be\nmade based on the proposed approach. Optical vortex generators for telecom\nwavelengths with sub-wavelength patterns of azimuthally oriented gratings are\namenable by direct laser polymerisation.\n", "  Identifying galaxy clusters through overdensities of galaxies in photometric\nsurveys is the oldest and arguably the most economic and mass-sensitive\ndetection method, compared to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect surveys that\ndetect the hot intracluster medium. However, a perennial problem has been the\nmapping of optical 'richness' measurements on to total cluster mass. Emitted at\na conformal distance of 14 Gpc, the cosmic microwave background acts as a\nbacklight to all intervening mass in the Universe, and therefore has been\ngravitationally lensed. Here we present a calibration of cluster optical\nrichness at the 10 per cent level by measuring the average cosmic microwave\nbackground lensing convergence measured by Planck towards the positions of\nlarge numbers of optically-selected clusters, detecting the deflection of\nphotons by haloes of total mass of the order 10**14 solar masses. Although\nmainly aimed at the study of larger-scale structures, the Planck lensing\nreconstruction can yield nearly unbiased results for stacked clusters on\narcminute scales. The lensing convergence only depends on the redshift integral\nof the fractional overdensity of matter, so this approach offers a clean\nmeasure of cluster mass over most of cosmic history, largely independent of\nbaryon physics.\n", "  Quantum phase slips, i.e the primary excitations in one-dimensional\nsuperfluids at low temperature, have been well characterized in most\ncondensed-matter systems, with the notable exception of ultracold quantum\ngases. Here we present our experimental investigation of the dissipation in\nonedimensional Bose superfluids flowing along a periodic potential, which show\nsignatures of the presence of quantum phase slips. In particular, by\ncontrolling the velocity of the superfluid and the interaction between the\nbosons we are apparently able to drive a crossover from a regime of thermal\nphase slips into a regime of quantum phase slips. Achieving a good control of\nquantum phase slips in ultracold quantum gases requires to keep under control\nother phenomena such as the breaking of superfluidity at the critical velocity\nor the appearance of a Mott insulator in the strongly correlated regime. Here\nwe show our current results in these directions.\n", "  Bound quasiparticles, negatively charged trions and neutral excitons, are\nassociated with the direct optical transitions at the K-points of the Brillouin\nzone for monolayer MoS$_2$. The change in the carrier concentration,\nsurrounding dielectric constant and defect concentration can modulate the\nphotoluminescence and Raman spectra. Here we show that exposing the monolayer\nMoS$_2$ in air to a modest laser intensity for a brief period of time enhances\nsimultaneously the photoluminescence (PL) intensity associated with both trions\nand excitons, together with $\\sim$ 3 to 5 times increase of the Raman intensity\nof first and second order modes. The simultaneous increase of PL from trions\nand excitons cannot be understood based only on known-scenario of depletion of\nelectron concentration in MoS$_2$ by adsorption of O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules.\nThis is explained by laser induced healing of defect states resulting in\nreduction of non-radiative Auger processes. This laser healing is corroborated\nby an observed increase of intensity of both the first order and second order\n2LA(M) Raman modes by a factor of $\\sim$ 3 to 5. The A$_{1g}$ mode hardens by\n$\\sim$ 1.4 cm$^{-1}$ whereas the E$^1_{2g}$ mode softens by $\\sim$ 1 cm$^{-1}$.\nThe second order 2LA(M) Raman mode at $\\sim$ 440 cm$^{-1}$ shows an increase in\nwavenumber by $\\sim$ 8 cm$^{-1}$ with laser exposure. These changes are a\ncombined effect of change in electron concentrations and oxygen-induced lattice\ndisplacements.\n", "  The numerical prediction of droplet base radius and contact angle depends on\nthe choice of characteristic radius and height of droplet. In this study, a\ndeveloped model on the basis of lubrication approximation is used to\ninvestigate the effect of characteristic parameters on the spreading of\ndroplets over substrates. Based on two main stages of spreading (initial and\nequilibrium), characteristic radius and height were first evaluated. The model\npredictions were then compared with experimental results in literature for both\nimpermeable and permeable substrates. The study provides evidence that the\nchoice of characteristic length scales based on either stage enables accurate\nprediction of the droplet base radius and contact angle. In addition, a new\nscaling relation for the predictions of the numerical disjoining pressure, with\nan error of $\\pm$5\\%, is proposed.\n", "  We determine the charm quark mass ${\\hat m}_c({\\hat m}_c)$ from QCD sum rules\nof moments of the vector current correlator calculated in perturbative QCD.\nOnly experimental data for the charm resonances below the continuum threshold\nare needed in our approach, while the continuum contribution is determined by\nrequiring self-consistency between various sum rules, including the one for the\nzeroth moment. Existing data from the continuum region can then be used to\nbound the theoretical error. Our result is ${\\hat m}_c({\\hat m}_c) = 1272 \\pm\n8$ MeV for $\\hat\\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1182$. Special attention is given to the\nquestion how to quantify and justify the uncertainty.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ be the Heisenberg algebra and let $\\mathfrak g$ be the\n3-dimensional Lie algebra having $[e_1,e_2]=e_1\\,(=-[e_2,e_1])$ as its only\nnon-zero commutation relations. We describe the closure of the orbit of a\nvector of structure constants corresponding to $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ and $\\mathfrak\ng$ respectively as an algebraic set giving in each case a set of polynomials\nfor which the orbit closure is the set of common zeros. Working over an\narbitrary infinite field, this description enables us to give an alternative\nway, using the definition of an irreducible algebraic set, of obtaining all\ndegenerations of $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ and $\\mathfrak g$ (the degeneration from\n$\\mathfrak g$ to $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ being one of them).\n", "  Mathematical modelling of tumor growth is one of the most useful and\ninexpensive approaches to determine and predict the stage, size and progression\nof tumors in realistic geometries. Moreover, these models has been used to get\nan insight into cancer growth and invasion and in the analysis of tumor size\nand geometry for applications in cancer treatment and surgical planning. The\npresent revision attempts to present a general perspective of the use of models\nbased on reaction-diffusion equations not only for the description of tumor\ngrowth in gliomas, addressing for processes such as tumor heterogeneity,\nhypoxia, dormancy and necrosis, but also its potential use as a tool in\ndesigning optimized and patient specific therapies.\n", "  SmCo5 permanent magnets exhibit enormous uniaxial magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy energy and have a high Curie temperature. However, a low energy\nproduct presents a significant drawback in the performance of SmCo5 permanent\nmagnets. In order to increase the energy product in SmCo5, we propose\nsubstituting fixed amount of cobalt with iron in a new magnet, SmFe3CoNi, where\ninclusion of nickel metal makes this magnet thermodynamically stable. We\nfurther discuss some basic theoretical magnetic properties of the SmCo5\ncompound.\n", "  The unique structure of Zintl phase makes it an ideal system to realize the\nconcept of phonon-glass and electron-crystal in the thermoelectric community.\nIn this work, by combining first-principles calculations and Boltzmann\ntransport theory for both electrons and phonons, we demonstrate that the ZT\nvalue of Zintl compound KSnSb can reach ~2.6 at 800 K. Such extraordinary\nthermoelectric performance originates from the large Seebeck coefficient due to\nmulti-valley band structures and particularly very small lattice thermal\nconductivity caused by mixed-bond characteristics.\n", "  Ultrafast fiber lasers play important roles in many aspects of our life for\ntheir various applications in fields ranging from fundamental sciences to\nindustrial purposes. Passive mode-locking technique is a key step to realize\nthe ultrafast soliton fiber lasers. However, the booting dynamics of the\nsoliton fiber lasers have not yet been well understood. Herein, we reveal the\nsoliton buildup dynamics of ultrafast fiber lasers operating both in anomalous\nand net-normal dispersion regimes. Based on the advanced experimental\nmethodologies of spatio-temporal reconstruction and dispersive Fourier\ntransform (DFT), the soliton booting dynamics are analyzed in the time and\nspectral domains. It was found that the booting dynamics of conventional and\ndissipative solitons operating in the anomalous and net-normal dispersion\nregimes, respectively, are different from each other due to the different pulse\nshaping mechanisms. In particular, the spectral interference pattern with\nstrong relaxation oscillation behavior was observed near the mode-locking\ntransition for conventional soliton, while no relaxation oscillation of\nspectral pattern was obtained for dissipative soliton. We firstly revealed that\nthe spectral pattern distributions are induced by the transient structured\nsoliton formation during the pulse shaping from the noise background. The\nexperimental results were verified by the theoretical simulations. The obtained\nresults would provide a general guideline for understanding the soliton booting\ndynamics in ultrafast fiber lasers, and will prove to be fruitful to the\nvarious communities interested in solitons and fiber lasers.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate coherent amplification of probe field in a\ntripod-type atoms driven by strong coupling, signal and weak probe fields. We\nsuppress linear and nonlinear atomic absorptions for resonant and near resonant\nprobe via double electromagnetically induced transparency (DEIT). Combining\nthese advantages of suppressed absorption along with temperature- or\natomic-density-controlled transfer of population(ToP) between hyperfine ground\nstates, we can induce near-resonant amplification of probe through stimulated\nRaman scattering(SRS) pumped by low-intensity signal field. The increased\npopulation difference of initial and final states of SRS due to increased ToP\nrate, together with reduced absorption at the second EIT window in an optically\nthick Cesium vapor, gives rise to highly effective coherent amplification.\n", "  The laminated structure of graphene oxide (GO) confers unique interactions\nwith water molecules which may be utilised in a range of applications that\nrequire materials with tuneable hygroscopic properties. Precise roles of the\nexpandable interlayer spacing and functional groups in GO laminates are not\nfully understood till date. Herein, we report experimental and theoretical\nstudy on the adsorption and desorption behaviour of water in GO laminates as a\nfunction of relative pressure. We have observed that GO imparts excellent water\nuptake capacity of up to 0.58 gram of water per gram of GO (g g-1), which is\nmuch higher than silica gel a conventional desiccant material. More\ninterestingly, the adsorption and desorption kinetics of GO is one order of\nmagnitude higher than silica gel. The observed extraordinary\nadsorption/desorption rate can be attributed to the high capillary pressure in\nGO laminates as well as micro meter sized tunnel like wrinkles located at the\nsurface.\n", "  In the present chapter, we discuss an approach for transition from discrete\nto continuum description of thermomechanical behavior of solids. The transition\nis carried out for several anharmonic systems: one-dimensional crystal,\nquasi-one-dimensional crystal (a chain possessing longitudinal and transversal\nmotions), two- and tree-dimensional crystals with simple lattice. Macroscopic\nbalance equations are derived from equations of motion for particles.\nMacroscopic parameters, such as stress, heat flux, deformation, thermal energy,\netc., are represented via parameters of the discrete system. Closed form\nequations of state relating thermal pressure, thermal energy and specific\nvolume are derived. Description of the heat transfer in harmonic approximation\nis discussed. Unsteady ballistic heat transfer in a harmonic one-dimensional\ncrystal is considered. The heat transfer equation for this system is rigorously\nderived.\n", "  We study radiation reaction in a Lorentz violating electrodynamics [1]. We\nexplore the possible modification whatsoever present in the radiation reaction\nforce experienced by an accelerating charge in the modified Maxwell theory.\nHowever it turns out that radiation reaction receives no change due to Lorentz\nviolation whereas electromagnetic mass manifests anisotropy.\n", "  In this paper we focus on the continuous representation on\n$\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})\\subset L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ with the operators\n$\\frac{(PQ+QP)}{4}$ and $\\frac{Q^2}{2}$ as generators given by\n$U[p,q]=\\exp(-\\frac{iqQ^2}{2}) \\exp(i\\log p\\frac{PQ+QP}{4}).$ Action of the\noperator $\\exp(PQ+QP)$ and the unitary equivalent operator on\n$\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})\\subseteq L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ of the multiplication\noperator in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\frac{1}{2}}\\oplus\\mathcal{H}_{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ is\nobtained.\n", "  This is a reply to the correspondence of Prof. Robert Ritchie: \"On the\nfracture toughness of bioinspired ceramic materials\", submitted to Nature\nMaterials, which discusses the fracture toughness values of the following\npapers: Bouville, F., Maire, E., Meille, S., Van de Moort\\`ele, B., Stevenson,\nA.

In this paper, we present a simulation study using CORSIKA to\nquantify the lateral profile of the muons at ground level, characterized by\ntheir energy spectrum and lateral spread, and combine it with the depth at\nshower maximum (X$_{max}$) of an EAS initiated by a primary at energies\n$10^{16}$ eV - $10^{19}$ eV. Using different primaries, we show that the\ncombined muon observables and X$_{max}$ can identify the primary in a large\nfraction of the events, depending on the energy and the detector performance.\nThis study provides important input parameters for the design of a future muon\ndetector for surface array, which will be able to boost the knowledge of\nprimaries and of the QCD interactions in the atmosphere.\n", "  We report the understanding of the electronic band structure of\n$Cs_4CuSb_2Cl_{12}$ perovskite through first-principles density-functional\ntheory calculations. We find that the most stable state has the\nantiferromagnetic configuration where each $[CuCl_6]$ octahedral chain along\nthe [010] direction is antiferromagnetic. The reasonable band structure of the\ncompound can be obtained only if both the correct magnetic order and the\nimproved exchange interaction of the Cu $\\it{d}$ electrons are taken into\naccount.\n", "  Systems comprising a turbulent channel flow overlaying a permeable bed can be\nfound in a variety of industrial and natural applications (e.g. urban planning,\nfracking, submerged vegetation). One important realization of this system is at\nthe bottom of rivers, where surface waters of the river permeate the deposited\nsediment and exchange their contents with subsurface waters. Obtaining a\ncomplete picture of this process, known as hyporheic exchange, is important for\nthe understanding and maintenance of water quality and river ecology. Given the\nwide range of length scales (mm to km) and corresponding time scales of\ninterest, reduced-order numerical models (e.g. stochastic particle tracking,\nadvection-dispersion equations) are often used to study the transport of mass\nand momentum in this system. However, the many scales associated with\nsurface/subsurface mixing make the development of a high-fidelity model for\nturbulent scalar transport a formidable challenge. In an effort to capture\ntransport behavior at the pore scale, this work is focused on development of a\ndetailed, three-dimensional flow model for the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of\nturbulent flow over a permeable bed. A rigorous assessment of the computational\nmesh, domain size and turbulence model is performed. Concurrently, the\ndouble-averaging methodology is used to study the large-scale, persistent flow\nbehavior in the presence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity. It is found that\naccurate resolution of the largest turbulent scales is necessary to develop a\ncomplete picture of interfacial transport, and that these large structures are\nfelt deeper within the bed. Additionally, the development of a particle\ntracking software module is detailed. This module provides a foundation for the\nextraction of Lagrangian dispersion information from the LES, which will\neventually be used to physically inform reduced-order models.\n", "  The paper reports the results of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations\nof proton beam acceleration at the interactions of a 130 fs laser pulse of\nintensity from the range of 10^21-10^23 W/cm^2, predicted for the Extreme Light\nInfrastructure (ELI) lasers currently built in Europe, with a thin hydrocarbon\n(CH) target. A special attention is paid to the effect of the laser pulse\nintensity and polarization (linear-LP, circular-CP) as well as the target\nthickness on the proton energy spectrum, the proton beam spatial distribution\nand the proton pulse shape and intensity. It is shown that for the highest,\nultra-relativistic intensities (10^23 W/cm^2) the effect of laser polarization\non the proton beam parameters is relatively weak and for both polarizations\nquasi-monoenergetic proton beams of the mean proton energy about 2 GeV and\ndE/E=0.3 for LP and dE/E=0.2 for CP are generated from the 0.1 micrometer CH\ntarget. At short distances from the irradiated target (below 50 micrometers),\nthe proton pulse is very short (below 20 fs), and the proton beam intensities\nreach extremely high values above 10^21 W/cm^2, which are much higher than\nthose attainable in conventional accelerators. Such proton beams can open the\ndoor for new areas of research in high energy-density physics and nuclear\nphysics as well as can also prove useful for applications in materials research\ne.g. as a tool for high-resolution proton radiography.\n", "  Coupled-resonance spectroscopy has been recently reported and applied for\nspectroscopic measurements and laser stabilizations. With coupled-resonance\nspectroscopy, one may indirectly measure some transitions between the excited\nstates that are hard to be measured directly because of the lack of populations\nin the excited states. An improvement of the coupled-resonance spectroscopy by\ncombining the technology of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is\nproposed. The coupled-resonance spectroscopy signal can be significantly\nenhanced by EIT. Several experimental schemes have been discussed. The line\nshape of the EIT-enhanced coupled-resonance spectroscopy has been\ncalculated.The EIT-enhanced coupled-resonance spectroscopy can be used for\nsimultaneously stabilizing two lasers to the same atomic source.\n", "  Non-Fourier heat conduction models assume wave-like behavior does exist in\nthe heat conduction process. Based on this wave-like behavior, thermal\nconduction controlled in a one-dimensional periodical structure, named thermal\nwave crystal, has been demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and\nnumerical simulation based on the Cattaneo-Vernotte (CV) heat-conduction model.\nThe transfer matrix method and Bloch analysis have been applied to calculate\nthe band structure of thermal wave propagating in thermal wave crystals. And\nthe temperature responses are obtained by using the FDTD method, which is also\nused to verify the correctness of the band structure. The results show that\nband gaps do exist due to the Bragg scattering. Then, a calculation method to\npredict the mid-gap frequency of band gaps for the thermal wave crystal has\nbeen introduced in this Letter. And key parameters determining the band gaps\nhave been discussed. This study shows the potential applications of this novel\nmechanism, such as thermal imagining, thermal diodes and thermal waveguides.\n", "  We point out that the quantum dynamical map of an open quantum system can be\ngenerated by an effective Liouville operator. The effective Liouville shows the\ndynamical breaking of time reversibility. This breaking of reversibility is\nexpressed by the effective Liouville's discrete spectrum having negative\nimaginary parts. This generated dynamics of open quantum systems is capable of\nmemory effects described by a frequency dependence of the spectrum. When memory\neffects can be neglected or smoothed out, the effective Liouville generates the\nwell known semi-group dynamics of open systems in the Markov approximation. The\nspectral analysis of the effective Liouville -with or without memory- allows to\nrepresent the quantum dynamical map and expectation values of physical\nquantities by metric expressions using complex eigenvalues and bi-orthonormal\neigenmodes. The long time dynamics is dominated by the zero-mode, which forms\nthe stationary state of the open system. The relaxation time scale $\\tau$ is\nset by the inverse of the smallest negative imaginary part of the non-vanishing\neffective eigenvalues of the effective Liouville. In generic cases of\nsystem-environment-coupling this time scale $\\tau$ is the relevant scale for\nboth, the relaxation of diagonal elements (populations) and the decay of\noff-diagonal elements (coherences) of an initial density matrix in the\nstationary state's diagonal representation. It also sets the time scale after\nwhich the entropy tends to its stationary value. The effective Liouville and\nits spectral content thus give a framework to study the dynamic breaking of\ntime reversibility, memory effects, decoherence, relaxation to a stationary\nstate and the role of entropy in open quantum systems.\n", "  Results of UBVRIJHKLM photometry, VRI polarimetry and optical spectroscopy of\na young star RW Aur A obtained during 2010-11 and 2014-16 dimming events are\npresented. During the second dimming the star decreased its brightness to\n\\Delta V > 4.5 mag, polarization of its light in I-band was up to 30%, and\ncolor-magnitude diagram was similar to that of UX Ori type stars. We conclude\nthat the reason of both dimmings is an eclipses of the star by dust screen, but\nthe size of the screen is much larger than in the case of UXORs.\n", "  The interaction of optical and acoustic waves via stimulated Brillouin\nscattering (SBS) has recently reached on-chip platforms, which has opened new\nfields of applications ranging from integrated microwave photonics and on-chip\nnarrow-linewidth lasers, to phonon-based optical delay and signal processing\nschemes. Since SBS is an effect that scales exponentially with interaction\nlength, on-chip implementation on a short length scale is challenging,\nrequiring carefully designed waveguides with optimized opto-acoustic overlap.\nIn this work, we use the principle of Brillouin optical correlation domain\nanalysis (BOCDA) to locally measure the SBS spectrum with high spatial\nresolution of 800 {\\mu}m and perform a distributed measurement of the Brillouin\nspectrum along a spiral waveguide in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). This\napproach gives access to local opto-acoustic properties of the waveguides,\nincluding the Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) and linewidth, essential\ninformation for the further development of high quality photonic-phononic\nwaveguides for SBS applications.\n", "  Motivated by the recent successful application of artificial neural networks\nto quantum many-body problems [G. Carleo and M. Troyer, Science {\\bf 355}, 602\n(2017)], a method to calculate the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model using\na feedforward neural network is proposed. The results are in good agreement\nwith those obtained by exact diagonalization and the Gutzwiller approximation.\nThe method of neural-network quantum states is promising for solving quantum\nmany-body problems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  Configuration Interaction (CI) calculations on the ground state of the C atom\nare carried out using a small basis set of Slater orbitals [7s6p5d4f3g]. The\nconfigurations are selected according to their contribution to the total\nenergy. One set of exponents is optimized for the whole expansion. Using some\ncomputational techniques to increase efficiency, our computer program is able\nto perform partially-parallelized runs of 1000 configuration term functions\nwithin a few minutes. With the optimized computer programme we were able to\ntest a large number of configuration types and chose the most important ones.\nThe energy of the $^3{\\rm P}$ ground state of carbon atom with a wave function\nof angular momentum L=1 and M$_{\\rm L}$=0 and spin eigenfunction with S=1 and\nM$_{\\rm S}$=0 leads to -37.83526523 h, which is millihartree accurate. We\ndiscuss the state of the art in the determination of the ground state of the\ncarbon atom and give an outlook about the complex spectra of this atom and its\nlow-lying states.\n", "  Steady-state upscaling of relative permeability is studied for a range of\nreservoir models. Both rate-dependent upscaling and upscaling in the capillary\nand viscous limits are considered. In particular, we study fluvial depositional\nsystems, which represent a large and important class of reservoirs. Numerical\nexamples show that steady-state upscaling is rate dependent, in accordance with\nprevious work. In this respect we introduce a scale-dependent capillary number\nto estimate the balance between viscous and capillary forces. The difference\nbetween the limit solutions can be large, and we show that the intermediate\nflow rates can span several orders of magnitude. This substantiate the need for\nrate-dependent steady-state upscaling in a range of flow scenarios. We\ndemonstrate that steady-state upscaling converges from the capillary to the\nviscous limit solution as the flow rate increases, and we identify a simple\nsynthetic model where the convergence fails to be monotone. Two different sets\nof boundary conditions were tested, but had only minor effects on the presented\nreservoir models. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of steady-state\nupscaling by performing dynamic flow simulation at the reservoir scale, both on\nfine-scaled and on upscaled models. The considered model is viscous dominated\nfor realistic flow rates, and the simulation results indicate that viscous\nlimit upscaling is appropriate.\n", "  It is believed that there are extra fundamental gauge symmetries beyond these\ndescribed by the Standard Model of particle physics. The scale of these new\ngauge symmetries are usually too high to be reachable by particle colliders.\nConsidering that the phase transition (PT) relating to the spontaneous breaking\nof new gauge symmetries to the electroweak symmetry might be strongly first\norder, we propose in this paper taking the stochastic gravitational waves (GW)\narising from this phase transition as an indirect way of detecting these new\nfundamental gauge symmetries. As an illustration, we explore the possibility of\ndetecting the stochastic GW generated from the PT of $\\mathbf{ B-L}$ in the\nspace-based interferometer detectors. Out study shows that the GW energy\nspectrum is reachable by the LISA, BBO, Taiji and DECIGO experiments only for\nthe case where the spontaneous breaking of $\\mathbf{B-L}$ is triggered by at\nleast two electroweak singlet scalars.\n", "  Many equations of mathematical physics are described by differential\npolynomials, that is by polynomials in the derivatives of a certain number of\nfunctions. However, up to the knowledge of the author, differential algebra in\na modern setting has never been applied to study the specific algebraic feature\nof such equations. The purpose of this short but difficult paper is to revisit\na few domains like general relativity, conformal geometry and contact geometry\nin the light of a modern approach to nonlinear systems of partial differential\nequations, using new methods from Differential Geometry (D.C. Spencer, 1970),\nDifferential Algebra (J.F. Ritt, 1950 and E. Kolchin, 1973) and Algebraic\nAnalysis (M. Kashiwara, 1970). Identifying the differential indeterminates of\nRitt and Kolchin with the jet coordinates of Spencer, the idea is to study\nDifferential Duality by using only linear differential operators with\ncoefficients in a differential field. In particular, the linearized second\norder Einstein equations are parametrizing the first order Cauchy stress\nequations but cannot themselves be parametrized. In the framework of\nHomological Algebra, this result is not coherent with the vanishing of certain\nfirst and second extension modules. As a byproduct, we shall prove that\ngravitation and electromagnetism must only depend on the second order jets\n(elations) of the system of conformal Killing equations. Finally, we shall use\nthese new methods in order to study contact transformations in arbitrary odd\ndimension and apply these results to the study of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in\nmechanics.\n", "  We report on recent results from a target-of-opportunity program to obtain\nspectropolarimetry observations with the Southern African Large Telescope\n(SALT) on flaring gamma-ray blazars. SALT spectropolarimetry and\ncontemporaneous multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) data are\nbeing modelled self-consistently with a leptonic single-zone model. Such\nmodeling provides an accurate estimate of the degree of order of the magnetic\nfield in the emission region and the thermal contributions (from the host\ngalaxy and the accretion disk) to the SED, thus putting strong constraints on\nthe physical parameters of the gamma-ray emitting region. For the specific case\nof the $\\gamma$-ray blazar 4C+01.02, we demonstrate that the combined SED and\nspectropolarimetry modeling constrains the mass of the central black hole in\nthis blazar to $M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 10^9 \\, M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We have developed a high-order numerical method for the 3D simulation of\nviscous and inviscid multiphase flow described by a homogeneous equilibrium\nmodel and a general equation of state. Here we focus on single-phase, two-phase\n(gas-liquid or gas-solid) and three-phase (gas-liquid-solid) flow of CO2 whose\nthermodynamic properties are calculated using the Span-Wagner reference\nequation of state. The governing equations are spatially discretized on a\nuniform Cartesian grid using the finite-volume method with a fifth-order\nweighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme and the robust first-order\ncentered (FORCE) flux. The solution is integrated in time using a third-order\nstrong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method. We demonstrate close to\nfifth-order convergence for advection-diffusion and for smooth single- and\ntwo-phase flows. Quantitative agreement with experimental data is obtained for\na direct numerical simulation of an air jet flowing from a rectangular nozzle.\nQuantitative agreement is also obtained for the shape and dimensions of the\nbarrel shock in two highly underexpanded CO2 jets.\n", "  Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) and transparent oxide semiconductors\n(TOSs) have become necessary materials for a variety of applications in the\ninformation and energy technologies, ranging from transparent electrodes to\nactive electronics components. Perovskite barium stannate (BaSnO3), a new TCO\nor TOS system, is a potential platform for realizing optoelectronic devices and\nobserving novel electronic quantum states due to its high electron mobility,\nexcellent thermal stability, high transparency, structural versatility, and\nflexible doping controllability at room temperature. This article reviews\nrecent progress in the doped BaSnO3 system, discussing the wide physical\nproperties, electron-scattering mechanism, and demonstration of key\nsemiconducting devices such as pn diodes and field-effect transistors.\nMoreover, we discuss the pathways to achieving two-dimensional electron gases\nat the interface between BaSnO3 and other perovskite oxides and describe\nremaining challenges for observing novel quantum phenomena at the\nheterointerface.\n", "  We study, theoretically and experimentally, optical properties of different\ntypes of honeycomb photonic structures, known also as `photonic graphene'.\nFirst, we employ the two-photon polymerization method to fabricate the\nhoneycomb structures. In experiment, we observe a strong diffraction from a\nfinite number of elements, thus providing a unique tool to define the exact\nnumber of scattering elements in the structure by a naked eye. Then, we study\ntheoretically the transmission spectra of both honeycomb single layer and 2D\nstructures of parallel dielectric circular rods. When the dielectric constant\nof the rod materials $\\varepsilon$ is increasing, we reveal that a\ntwo-dimensional photonic graphene structure transforms into a metamaterial when\nthe lowest TE${}_{01}$ Mie gap opens up below the lowest Bragg bandgap. We also\nobserve two Dirac points in the band structure of 2D photonic graphene at the\n$K$ point of the Brillouin zone and demonstrate a manifestation of the Dirac\nlensing for the TM polarization. The performance of the Dirac lens is that the\n2D photonic graphene layer converts a wave from point source into a beam with\nflat phase surfaces at the Dirac frequency for the TM polarization.\n", "  The strongly correlated electron fluids in high temperature cuprate\nsuperconductors demonstrate an anomalous linear temperature ($T$) dependent\nresistivity behavior, which persists to a wide temperature range without\nexhibiting saturation. As cooling down, those electron fluids lose the\nresistivity and condense into the superfluid. However, the origin of the\nlinear-$T$ resistivity behavior and its relationship to the strongly correlated\nsuperconductivity remain a mystery. Here we report a universal relation\n$d\\rho/dT=(\\mu_0k_B/\\hbar)\\lambda^2_L$, which bridges the slope of the\nlinear-$T$-dependent resistivity ($d\\rho/dT$) to the London penetration depth\n$\\lambda_L$ at zero temperature among cuprate superconductor\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ and heavy fermion superconductors\nCeCoIn$_5$, where $\\mu_0$ is vacuum permeability, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann\nconstant and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. We extend this scaling\nrelation to different systems and found that it holds for other cuprate,\npnictide and heavy fermion superconductors as well, regardless of the\nsignificant differences in the strength of electronic correlations, transport\ndirections, and doping levels. Our analysis suggests that the scaling relation\nin strongly correlated superconductors could be described as a hydrodynamic\ndiffusive transport, with the diffusion coefficient ($D$) approaching the\nquantum limit $D\\sim\\hbar/m^*$, where $m^*$ is the quasi-particle effective\nmass.\n", "  Certain star shaped quivers exhibit a pattern of symmetry enhancement on the\nCoulomb branch of $3d$ $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories. This\npaper studies a subclass of theories where such global symmetry enhancement\noccurs through a computation of the Highest Weight Generating Function (HWG)\nand of the corresponding Hilbert Series (HS), providing a further test of the\nCoulomb branch formula. This special subclass has a feature in which the HWG\ntakes a particularly simple form, as a simple rational function which is either\na product of simple poles (termed freely generated) or a simple PE (termed\ncomplete intersection). Out of all possible star shaped quivers, this is a\nparticularly simple subclass. The present study motivates a further study of\nidentifying all star shaped quivers for which their HWG is of this simple form.\n", "  In quantum error correction, it is an important assumption that errors on\ndifferent qubits are independent. In our previous work [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 92},\n052320 (2015)], the generality of the concatenated five-qubit code has been\ninvestgated when noises of the principal system and the auxiliary environment\nare assumed to be the same. In the error correction with concatenated code,\ntiny differences (in fidelity or independent errors) between initial quantum\nchannels may introduce different effective channels in the next level, and\ntherefore, it is necessary to study a meaningful question: Does five-qubit code\nstill work efficiently when errors on different qubits are different? In the\npresent work, it is discovered that even errors for different qubits are\narbitrary, the five-qubit code still works efficiently. Since it is much easier\nand more accurate to measure the fidelity, one can construct quantum error\ncorrection with five-qubit code according to the initial channel fidelity, and\nit is not necessary to know the complete information of the initial channel.\nMoreover, when the initial channel fidelity is below $0.992$, the fidelity\nthreshold for five-qubit code is the fidelity of the effective channel after\nerror correction in bit-flip channels.\n", "  The origin of the long-range memory in the non-equilibrium systems is still\nan open problem as the phenomenon can be reproduced using models based on\nMarkov processes. In these cases a notion of spurious memory is introduced. A\ngood example of Markov processes with spurious memory is stochastic process\ndriven by a non-linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). This example is\nat odds with models built using fractional Brownian motion (fBm). We analyze\ndifferences between these two cases seeking to establish possible empirical\ntests of the origin of the observed long-range memory. We investigate\nprobability density functions (PDFs) of burst and inter-burst duration in\nnumerically obtained time series and compare with the results of fBm. Our\nanalysis confirms that the characteristic feature of the processes described by\na one-dimensional SDE is the power-law exponent $3/2$ of the burst or\ninter-burst duration PDF. This property of stochastic processes might be used\nto detect spurious memory in various non-equilibrium systems, where observed\nmacroscopic behavior can be derived from the imitative interactions of agents.\n", "  Single spin detection is a key objective in the field of metrology. There\nhave been many experimental and theoretical investigations for the spin\ndetection based on the use of probe spins. A probe spin shows the precession\ndue to dipole-dipole interaction from a target spin, and measurement results of\nthe probe spin allow us to estimate the state of the target spin. Here, we\ninvestigate performance of single-spin detection when using an ensemble of\nprobe spins. Even though the ensemble of probe spins inevitably induces\nprojection noise that could hinder the signal from the target spin,\noptimization of the configuration of the spin ensemble improves the sensitivity\nsuch that enhancement of the signal can be much larger than the projection\nnoise. The probe-spin ensemble is especially useful at a large distance from\nthe target spin, where it is difficult for a single spin to read out the target\nspin within a reasonable repetition time. Our results pave the way for a new\nstrategy to realize efficient single-spin detections.\n", "  (abridged) The evolution of the B-band Tully Fisher relation (TFR) and of the\nstellar mass TFR up to z~1 is investigated using VIMOS tilted-slit spectra of\n160 zCOSMOS galaxies. Furthermore, the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio (SHMR) as a\nfunction of mass is studied and compared to predictions from simulations.\nInterestingly, the derived SHMR is in agreement with abundance matching models,\nalthough using simple derivations of vcircular from vmax and of rvirial from\nr1/2. This shows that this new approach can be used complementary to abundance\nmatching techniques to get new insights in the stellar content of dark matter\nhalos for individual galaxies.\n", "  In this paper we present a system of two nonlinear partial differential\nequations of the second order, depending on the time and one spatial\ncoordinate. It can be written as a system of two Burgers equations, which\nallows one to immediately conclude that it is integrable. This system seems to\nbe new, and its consideration can be of independent interest.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly using a\nmodel of the temporal patterns of two sub-regions, mimicking behaviour similar\nto El Ni\\~no Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Specifically, we present the\nexistence, stability, and basins of attraction of the solutions arising in the\nmodel system in the space of these parameters: self delay, delay and\ninter-region coupling strengths. The emergence or suppression of oscillations\nin our models is a dynamical feature of utmost relevance, as it signals the\npresence or absence of ENSO-like oscillations. In contrast to the well-known\nlow order model of ENSO, where the influence of the neighbouring regions on the\nregion of interest is modelled as external noise, we consider neighbouring\nregions as a coupled deterministic dynamical systems. Different parameters\nyield a rich variety of dynamical patterns in our model, ranging from steady\nstates and homogeneous oscillations to irregular oscillations and coexistence\nof oscillatory attractors, without explicit inclusion of noise. Interestingly,\nif we take the self-delay coupling strengths of the two sub-regions to be such\nthat the temperature of one region goes to a fixed point regime when uncoupled,\nwhile the other system is in the oscillatory regime, then on coupling both\nsystems show oscillations. We explicitly obtain the basins of attraction for\nthe different steady states and oscillatory states in the model. Our results\nmight be helpful for forecasting of El Ni\\~no (or La Ni\\~na) progress, as it\nindicates the combination of initial SST anomalies in the sub-regions that can\nresult in a El Ni\\~no/La Ni\\~na episodes. In particular, the result suggests\nusing an interval as a criterion to estimate the El-Ni\\~no or La-Ni\\~na\nprogress instead of the currently used the single value criterion.\n", "  Liquid metal (LM) is of current core interest for a wide variety of newly\nemerging areas. However, the functional materials thus made so far by LM only\ncould display a single silver-white appearance. Here in this study, the new\nconceptual colorful LM marbles working like transformable biomimetic chameleons\nwere proposed and fabricated from LM droplets through encasing them with\nfluorescent nano-particles. We demonstrated that this unique LM marble can be\nmanipulated into various stable magnificent appearances as one desires. And it\ncan also splitt and merge among different colors. Such multifunctional LM\nchameleon is capable of responding to the outside electric-stimulus and\nrealizing shape transformation and discoloration behaviors as well. Further\nmore, the electric-stimuli has been disclosed to be an easy going way to\ntrigger the release of nano/micro-particles from the LM. The present\nfluorescent biomimetic liquid metal chameleon is expected to offer important\nopportunities for diverse unconventional applications, especially in a wide\nvariety of functional smart material and color changeable soft robot areas.\n", "  This study proposes a novel solution blow spinning technique (SBS) for\nfabricating YBCO ceramic nanofibers. The precursor solutions were obtained from\nY, Ba, and Cu metallic acetates (Ac) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw =\n360,000). Ac:PVP concentrations of 1:1 and 5:1 were tested, resulting in\nceramic nanofibers with average diameters of 359 and 375 nm, respectively.\nX-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of a pure phase of YBa2Cu3O7-x. This\nis the first study to use SBS for fabricating YBCO nanofibers, and this\ntechnique shows promise for obtaining high-quality ceramic materials.\n", "  A long-standing open issue of the paradigm of low-mass star formation is the\nluminosity problem: most protostars are less luminous than theoretically\npredicted. One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU\nOri-type stars (FUors) are thought to be the visible examples for objects in\nthe high accretion state. FUors are often surrounded by massive envelopes,\nwhich replenish the disk material and enable the disk to produce accretion\noutbursts. However, we have insufficient information on the envelope dynamics\nin FUors, about where and how mass transfer from the envelope to the disk\nhappens. Here we present ALMA observations of the FUor-type star V346 Nor at\n1.3 mm continuum and in different CO rotational lines. We mapped the density\nand velocity structure of its envelope and analyze the results using channel\nmaps, position-velocity diagrams, and spectro-astrometric methods. We found\nthat V346 Nor is surrounded by gaseous material on 10000 au scale in which a\nprominent outflow cavity is carved. Within the central $\\sim$700 au, the\ncircumstellar matter forms a flattened pseudo-disk where material is infalling\nwith conserved angular momentum. Within $\\sim$350 au, the velocity profile is\nmore consistent with a disk in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 0.1\n$M_{\\odot}$. We determined an infall rate from the envelope onto the disk of\n6$\\times$10$^{-6}\\,M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, a factor of few higher than the\nquiescent accretion rate from the disk onto the star, hinting for a mismatch\nbetween the infall and accretion rates as the cause of the eruption.\n", "  In this chapter we review concepts and theories of polymer dynamics. We think\nof it as an introduction to the topic for scientists specializing in other\nsubfields of statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory, so, for the\nreaders reference, we start with a short review of the equilibrium static\nproperties of polymer systems. Most attention is paid to the dynamics of\nunentangled polymer systems, where apart from classical Rouse and Zimm models\nwe review some recent scaling and analytical generalizations. The dynamics of\nsystems with entanglements is also briefly reviewed. Special attention is paid\nto the discussion of comparatively weakly understood topological states of\npolymer systems and possible approaches to the description of their dynamics.\n", "  With the extensive applications of machine learning, the issue of private or\nsensitive data in the training examples becomes more and more serious: during\nthe training process, personal information or habits may be disclosed to\nunexpected persons or organisations, which can cause serious privacy problems\nor even financial loss. In this paper, we present a quantum privacy-preserving\nalgorithm for machine learning with perceptron. There are mainly two steps to\nprotect original training examples. Firstly when checking the current\nclassifier, quantum tests are employed to detect data user's possible\ndishonesty. Secondly when updating the current classifier, private random noise\nis used to protect the original data. The advantages of our algorithm are: (1)\nit protects training examples better than the known classical methods; (2) it\nrequires no quantum database and thus is easy to implement.\n", "  The HMI project recently started processing the continuum intensity images\nfollowing global helioseismology procedures similar to those used to process\nthe velocity images. The spatial decomposition of these images has produced\ntime series of spherical harmonic coefficients for degrees up to $\\ell=300$,\nusing a different apodization than the one used for velocity observations. The\nfirst 360 days of observations were processed and made available. In this paper\nI present initial results from fitting these time series using my state of the\nart fitting methodology and compare the derived mode characteristics to those\nestimated using co-eval velocity observations.\n", "  Coherence and entanglement are fundamental properties of quantum systems,\npromising to power the near future quantum computers, sensors and simulators.\nYet, their experimental detection is challenging, usually requiring full\nreconstruction of the system state. We show that one can extract quantitative\nbounds to the relative entropy of coherence and the coherent information,\ncoherence and entanglement quantifiers respectively, by a limited number of\npurity measurements. The scheme is readily implementable with current\ntechnology to verify quantum computations in large scale registers, without\ncarrying out expensive state tomography.\n", "  We introduce a novel in-situ strong field ionization tomography approach for\ncharacterizing the spatial density distribution of gas jets. We show that for\ntypical intensities in high harmonic generation experiments, the strong field\nionization mechanism used in our approach provides an improvement in the\nresolution close to factor of 2 (resolving about 8 times smaller voxel volume),\nwhen compared to linear/single-photon imaging modalities.\n  We find, that while the depth of scan in linear tomography is limited by\nresolution loss due to the divergence of the driving laser beam, in the\nproposed approach the depth of focus is localized due to the inherent physical\nnature of strong-field interaction and discuss implications of these findings.\nWe explore key aspects of the proposed method and compare it with commonly used\nsingle- and multi-photon imaging mechanisms. The proposed method will be\nparticularly useful for strong field and attosecond science experiments.\n", "  Experiments and computer simulations of the transformations of amorphous ices\ndisplay different behavior depending on sample preparation methods, and on the\nrates of change of temperature and pressure to which samples are subjected. In\naddition to these factors, simulation results also depend strongly on the\nchosen water model. Using computer simulations of the ST2 water model, we study\nhow the sharpness of the compression-induced transition from low-density\namorphous ice (LDA) to high-density amorphous ice (HDA) is influenced by the\npreparation of LDA. By studying LDA samples prepared using widely different\nprocedures, we find that the sharpness of the LDA-to- HDA transformation is\ncorrelated with the depth of the initial LDA sample in the potential energy\nlandscape (PEL), as characterized by the inherent structure energy. Our results\nshow that the complex phenomenology of the amorphous ices reported in\nexperiments and computer simulations can be understood and predicted in a\nunified way from a knowledge of the PEL of the system.\n", "  In this paper we model the neutralization of an acid solution in which the\nhydrogen ions are transported according to Cattaneo's diffusion. The latter is\na modification of classical Fickian diffusion in which the flux adjusts to the\ngradient with a positive relaxation time. Accordingly the evolution of the ions\nconcentration is governed by the hyperbolic telegraph equation instead of the\nclassical heat equation. We focus on the specific case of a marble slab\nreacting with a sulphuric acid solution and we consider a one-dimensional\ngeometry. We show that the problem is multi-scale in time, with a reaction time\nscale that is larger than the diffusive time scale, so that the governing\nequation is reduced to the one-dimensional wave equation. The mathematical\nproblem turns out to be a hyperbolic free boundary problem where the\nconsumption of the slab is described by a nonlinear differential equation.\nGlobal well posedness is proved and some numerical simulations are provided.\n", "  Aiming at improving our knowledge of the low-energy limit of heterotic\norbifold compactifications, we determine at lowest order the Kahler potential\nof matter fields in the case where more than three bulk Kahler moduli appear.\nInterestingly, bulk matter fields couple to more than one Kahler modulus, a\nsubtle difference with models with only three Kahler moduli that may provide a\ntool to address the question of moduli stabilization in these models.\n", "  We discuss the non-conservation of fermion number (or chirality breaking,\ndepending on the fermionic charge assignment) in Abelian gauge theories at\nfinite temperature. We study different mechanisms of fermionic charge\ndisappearance in the high temperature plasma, with the use of both analytical\nestimates and real-time classical numerical simulations. We investigate the\nrandom walk of the Chern-Simons number $N_{\\rm CS} \\propto \\int d^4x\nF_{\\mu\\nu}{\\tilde F}^{\\mu\\nu}$, and show that it has a diffusive behaviour in\nthe presence of an external magnetic field $B$. This indicates that the\nmechanism for fermionic number non-conservation for $B \\neq 0$, is due to\nfluctuations of the gauge fields, similarly as in the case of non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. We determine numerically the rate of chirality non-conservation\nassociated with this diffusion, finding it larger by a factor $\\sim 60$\ncompared to previous theoretical estimates. We also perform numerical\nsimulations for the system which contains a chemical potential $\\mu$\nrepresenting a fermionic charge density, again both with and without an\nexternal magnetic field. When $B=0$, we observe clearly the expected\ninstability of the system for $\\mu \\neq 0$, as long as the chemical potential\nexceeds a critical value $\\mu > \\mu_c(L)$, which depends on the size $L$ of the\nsystem. When $B \\neq 0$, the fluctuations of bosonic fields lead to the\ntransfer of chemical potential into Chern-Simons number for arbitrary $\\mu$.\n", "  The problem of classical data compression when the decoder has quantum side\ninformation at his disposal is considered. This is a quantum generalization of\nthe classical Slepian-Wolf theorem. The optimal compression rate is found to be\nreduced from the Shannon entropy of the source by the Holevo information\nbetween the source and side information.\n", "  Bipartite entanglement is one of the fundamental quantifiable resources of\nquantum information theory. We propose a new application of this resource to\nthe theory of quantum measurements. According to Naimark's theorem any rank 1\ngeneralised measurement (POVM) M may be represented as a von Neumann\nmeasurement in an extended (tensor product) space of the system plus ancilla.\nBy considering a suitable average of the entanglements of these measurement\ndirections and minimising over all Naimark extensions, we define a notion of\nentanglement cost E_min(M) of M.\n  We give a constructive means of characterising all Naimark extensions of a\ngiven POVM. We identify various classes of POVMs with zero and non-zero cost\nand explicitly characterise all POVMs in 2 dimensions having zero cost. We\nprove a constant upper bound on the entanglement cost of any POVM in any\ndimension. Hence the asymptotic entanglement cost (i.e. the large n limit of\nthe cost of n applications of M, divided by n) is zero for all POVMs.\n  The trine measurement is defined by three rank 1 elements, with directions\nsymmetrically placed around a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We give an\nanalytic expression for its entanglement cost. Defining a normalised cost of\nany d-dimensional POVM by E_min(M)/log(d), we show (using a combination of\nanalytic and numerical techniques) that the trine measurement is more costly\nthan any other POVM with d>2, or with d=2 and ancilla dimension 2. This\nstrongly suggests that the trine measurement is the most costly of all POVMs.\n", "  Let A = {rho_1,...,rho_n} be a given set of quantum states. We consider the\nproblem of finding necessary and sufficient conditions on another set B =\n{sigma_1,...,sigma_n} that guarantee the existence of a physical transformation\ntaking rho_i to sigma_i for all i. Uhlmann has given an elegant such condition\nwhen both sets comprise pure states. We give a simple proof of this condition\nand develop some consequences. Then we consider multi-probabilistic\ntransformations between sets of pure states which leads to conditions for the\nproblem of transformability between A and B when one set is pure and the other\nis arbitrary.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a quantum information theoretical model for\nquantum secret sharing schemes. We show that quantum information theory\nprovides a unifying framework for the study of these schemes. We prove that the\ninformation theoretical requirements for a class of quantum secret sharing\nschemes reduce to only one requirement (the recoverability condition) as a\nconsequence of the no-cloning principle. We give also a shorter proof of the\nfact that the size of the shares in a quantum secret sharing scheme must be at\nleast as large as the secret itself.\n", "  Continuing our earlier work (quant-ph/0401060), we give two alternative\nproofs of the result that a noiseless qubit channel has identification capacity\n2: the first is direct by a \"maximal code with random extension\" argument, the\nsecond is by showing that 1 bit of entanglement (which can be generated by\ntransmitting 1 qubit) and negligible (quantum) communication has identification\ncapacity 2.\n  This generalises a random hashing construction of Ahlswede and Dueck: that 1\nshared random bit together with negligible communication has identification\ncapacity 1.\n  We then apply these results to prove capacity formulas for various quantum\nfeedback channels: passive classical feedback for quantum-classical channels, a\nfeedback model for classical-quantum channels, and \"coherent feedback\" for\ngeneral channels.\n", "  Following initial work by Gregoratti and Werner [J. Mod. Optics 50, 913-933,\n2003 and quant-ph/0403092] and Hayden and King [quant-ph/0409026], we study the\nproblem of the capacity of a quantum channel assisted by a \"friendly (channel)\nenvironment\" that can locally measure and communicate classical messages to the\nreceiver.\n  Previous work [quant-ph/0505038] has yielded a capacity formula for the\nquantum capacity under this kind of help from the environment. Here we study\nthe problem of the environment-assisted classical capacity, which exhibits a\nsomewhat richer structure (at least, it seems to be the harder problem). There\nare several, presumably inequivalent, models of the permitted local operations\nand classical communications between receiver and environment: one-way,\narbitrary, separable and PPT POVMs. In all these models, the task of decoding a\nmessage amounts to discriminating a set of possibly entangled states between\nthe two receivers, by a class of operations under some sort of locality\nconstraint.\n  After introducing the operational capacities outlined above, we show that a\nlower bound on the environment-assisted classical capacity is always half the\nlogarithm of the input space dimension. Then we develop a few techniques to\nprove the existence of channels which meet this lower bound up to terms of much\nsmaller order, even when PPT decoding measurements are allowed (assuming a\ncertain superadditivity conjecture).\n", "  We consider two capacity quantities associated with bipartite unitary gates:\nthe entangling and the disentangling power. For two-qubit unitaries these two\ncapacities are always the same. Here we prove that these capacities are\ndifferent in general. We do so by constructing an explicit example of a\nqubit-qutrit unitary whose entangling power is maximal (2 ebits), but whose\ndisentangling power is strictly less. A corollary is that there can be no\nunique ordering for unitary gates in terms of their ability to perform\nnon-local tasks. Finally we show that in large dimensions, almost all bipartite\nunitaries have entangling and disentangling capacities close to the maximal\npossible (and thus in high dimensions the difference in these capacities is\nsmall for almost all unitaries).\n", "  We investigate the problem of \"nonlocal\" computation, in which separated\nparties must compute a function with nonlocally encoded inputs and output, such\nthat each party individually learns nothing, yet together they compute the\ncorrect function output. We show that the best that can be done classically is\na trivial linear approximation. Surprisingly, we also show that quantum\nentanglement provides no advantage over the classical case. On the other hand,\ngeneralized (i.e. super-quantum) nonlocal correlations allow perfect nonlocal\ncomputation. This gives new insights into the nature of quantum nonlocality and\nits relationship to generalised nonlocal correlations.\n"]}
