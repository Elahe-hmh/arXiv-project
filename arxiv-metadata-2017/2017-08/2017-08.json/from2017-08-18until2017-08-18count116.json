Since\nthe Potts model was first proposed in 1952, physicists have studied lattice\nmodels to gain deep insights into magnetism and other disordered systems. For\nsome time, researchers have realized that digital images may be modeled in much\nthe same way as these physical systems (i.e., as a square lattice of numerical\nvalues). A major drawback in using Potts model methods for image segmentation\nis that, with conventional methods, it processes in exponential time. Advances\nhave been made via certain approximations to reduce the segmentation process to\npower-law time. However, in many applications (such as for sonar imagery),\nreal-time processing requires much greater efficiency. This article contains a\ndescription of an energy minimization technique that applies four Potts\n(Q-Ising) models directly to the image and processes in linear time. The result\nis analogous to partitioning the system into regions of four classes of\nmagnetism. This direct Potts segmentation technique is demonstrated on\nphotographic, medical, and acoustic images.\n", "  We look into the general aspects of space-time symmetries in presence of\ntorsion, and how the latter is affected by such symmetries. Focusing in\nparticular to space-times which either exhibit maximal symmetry on their own,\nor could be decomposed to maximally symmetric subspaces, we work out the\nconstraints on torsion in two different theoretical schemes. We show that at\nleast for a completely antisymmetric torsion tensor (for e.g. the one motivated\nfrom string theory), an equivalence is set between these two schemes, as the\nnon-vanishing independent torsion tensor components turn out to be the same.\n", "  Colbeck (Thesis, 2006) proposed using Bell inequality violations to generate\ncertified random numbers. While full quantum-security proofs have been given,\nit remains a major open problem to identify the broadest class of Bell\ninequalities and lowest performance requirements to achieve such security. In\nthis paper, working within the broad class of spot-checking protocols, we prove\nexactly which Bell inequality violations can be used to achieve full security.\nOur result greatly improves the known noise tolerance for secure randomness\nexpansion: for the commonly used CHSH game, full security was only known with a\nnoise tolerance of 1.5%, and we improve this to 10.3%. We also generalize our\nresults beyond Bell inequalities and give the first security proof for\nrandomness expansion based on Kochen-Specker inequalities. The central\ntechnical contribution of the paper is a new uncertainty principle for the\nSchatten norm, which is based on the uniform convexity inequality of Ball,\nCarlen, and Lieb (Inventiones mathematicae, 115:463-482, 1994).\n", "  Gamma-ray observations give us a direct view into the most extreme\nenvironments of the universe. They help us to study astronomical particle\naccelerators as supernovae remnants, pulsars, active galaxies or gamma-ray\nbursts and help us to understand the propagation of cosmic rays through our\nMilky Way. This article summarizes the status of gamma-ray observations from\nspace; it is the write-up of a rapporteur talk given at the 34th ICRC in The\nHague, The Netherlands. The primary instrument used in the presented studies is\nthe Large Area Telescope on-board the Fermi Spacecraft, which images the whole\ngamma-ray sky at photon energies between 20 MeV and 2 TeV. The Fermi mission is\ncurrently in its 8th year of observations. This article will review many of the\nexciting discoveries made in this time, focusing on the most recent ones.\n", "  Anatase TiO$_2$ is among the most studied materials for light-energy\nconversion applications, but the nature of its fundamental charge excitations\nis still unknown. Yet it is crucial to establish whether light absorption\ncreates uncorrelated electron-hole pairs or bound excitons and, in the latter\ncase, to determine their character. Here, by combining steady-state\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry with\nstate-of-the-art ab initio calculations, we demonstrate that the direct optical\ngap of single crystals is dominated by a strongly bound exciton rising over the\ncontinuum of indirect interband transitions. This exciton possesses an\nintermediate character between the Wannier-Mott and Frenkel regimes and\ndisplays a peculiar two-dimensional wavefunction in the three-dimensional\nlattice. The nature of the higher-energy excitations is also identified. The\nuniversal validity of our results is confirmed up to room temperature by\nobserving the same elementary excitations in defect-rich samples (doped single\ncrystals and nanoparticles) via ultrafast two-dimensional deep-ultraviolet\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Analyzing complex fluid flow problems that involve multiple coupled domains,\neach with their respective set of governing equations, is not a trivial\nundertaking. Even more complicated is the elaborate and tedious task of\nspecifying the interface and boundary conditions between various domains. This\npaper provides an elegant, straightforward and universal method that considers\nthe nature of those shared boundaries and derives the appropriate conditions at\nthe interface, irrespective of the governing equations being solved. As a first\nexample, a well-known interface condition is derived using this method. For a\nsecond example, the set of boundary condi- tions necessary to solve a baseline\naerothermodynamics coupled plain/porous flow problem is derived. Finally, the\nmethod is applied to two more flow configurations, one consisting of an\nimpermeable adiabatic wall and the other an ablating surface.\n", "  Motivated by recent optical lattice experiments [J.-y. Choi et al., Science\n352, 1547 (2016)], we study the dynamics of strongly interacting bosons in the\npresence of disorder in two dimensions. We show that Gutzwiller mean-field\ntheory (GMFT) captures the main experimental observations, which are a result\nof the competition between disorder and interactions. Our findings highlight\nthe difficulty in distinguishing glassy dynamics, which can be captured by\nGMFT, and many-body localization, which cannot be captured by GMFT, and\nindicate the need for further experimental studies of this system.\n", "  We consider the issue of thermalization in the D1D5 CFT. Thermalization is\nexpected to correspond to the formation of a black hole in the dual gravity\ntheory. We start from the orbifold point, where the theory is essentially free,\nand does not thermalize. In earlier work it was noted that there was no clear\nthermalization effect when the theory was deformed off the orbifold point to\nfirst order in the relevant twist perturbation. In this paper we consider the\ndeformation to second order in the twist, where we do find effects that can\ncause thermalization of an initial perturbation. We consider a 1-loop process\nwhere two untwisted copies of the CFT are twisted to one copy and then again\nuntwisted to two copies. We start with a single oscillator excitation on the\ninitial CFT, and compute the effect of the two twists on this state. We find\nsimple approximate expressions for the Bogoliubov coefficients and the behavior\nof the single oscillator excitation in the continuum limit, where the mode\nnumbers involved are taken to be much larger than unity. We also prove a number\nof useful relationships valid for processes with an arbitrary number of twist\ninsertions.\n", "  Soft slender structures are ubiquitous in natural and artificial systems and\ncan be observed at scales that range from the nanometric to the kilometric,\nfrom polymers to space tethers. We present a practical numerical approach to\nsimulate the dynamics of filaments that, at every cross-section, can undergo\nall six possible modes of deformation, allowing the filament to bend, twist,\nstretch and shear, while interacting with complex environments via muscular\nactivity, surface contact, friction and hydrodynamics. We examine the accuracy\nof our method by means of several benchmark problems with known analytic\nsolutions. We then demonstrate the capabilities and robustness of our approach\nto solve forward problems in physics and mechanics related to solenoid and\nplectoneme formation in twisted, stretched filaments, and inverse problems\nrelated to active biophysics of limbless locomotion on solid surfaces and in\nbulk liquids. All together, our approach provides a robust computational\nframework to characterize the mechanical response and design of soft active\nslender structures.\n", "  We analyze the low-lying states for a one-dimensional potential consisting of\n$N$ identical wells, assuming that the wells are parabolic around the minima.\nMatching the exact wave functions around the minima and the WKB wave functions\nin the barriers, we find a quantization condition which is then solved to give\na formula for the energy eigenvalues explicitly written in terms of the\npotential. In addition, constructing $N$ localized approximate eigenstates each\nof which matches on to that of the harmonic oscillator in one of the parabolic\nwells, and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the subspace spanned by the\nlocalized states on the assumption that the localized states form an orthogonal\nbasis, we also find the same formula for the energy eigenvalues which the\nmethod of matching the wave functions gives. In the large-$N$ limit, the\nformula reproduces, at the leading order, the expression for the widths of the\nnarrow energy bands of the Mathieu equation present in the mathematical\nliterature. As there are differences between the $N$-well system in the\nlarge-$N$ limit and the fully periodic system, we include a two-dimensional\nmodel in which the quadratic minima are located on the vertices of a regular\n$N$-sided polygon with rotational symmetry of order $N$. We argue that the\nlowest band of the two-dimensional model closely resembles the tight-binding\nenergy bands of the fully periodic one-dimensional system in that most of the\neigenvalues are degenerate in the large-$N$ limit with the eigenfunctions\nsatisfying the Bloch condition under the discrete rotations.\n", "  How DNA is mapped to functional proteins is a basic question of living\nmatter. We introduce and study a physical model of protein evolution which\nsuggests a mechanical basis for this map. Many proteins rely on large-scale\nmotion to function. We therefore treat protein as learning amorphous matter\nthat evolves towards such a mechanical function: Genes are binary sequences\nthat encode the connectivity of the amino acid network that makes a protein.\nThe gene is evolved until the network forms a shear band across the protein,\nwhich allows for long-range, soft modes required for protein function. The\nevolution reduces the high-dimensional sequence space to a low-dimensional\nspace of mechanical modes, in accord with the observed dimensional reduction\nbetween genotype and phenotype of proteins. Spectral analysis of the space of\n$10^6$ solutions shows a strong correspondence between localization around the\nshear band of both mechanical modes and the sequence structure. Specifically,\nour model shows how mutations of the gene and their correlations occur at amino\nacids whose interactions determine the functional mode.\n", "  We investigate a Fabry-P\\'erot interferometer in the integer Hall regime in\nwhich only one edge channel is transmitted and n channels are trapped into the\ninterferometer loop. Addressing recent experimental observations, we assume\nthat Coulomb blockade effects are completely suppressed due to screening, while\nkeeping track of a residual strong short range electron-electron interaction\nbetween the co-propagating edge channels trapped into the interferometer loop.\nThis kind of interaction can be completely described in the framework of the\nedge-magnetoplasmon scattering matrix theory allowing us to evaluate the\nbackscattering current and the associated differential conductance as a\nfunction of the bias voltage. The remarkable features of these quantities are\ndiscussed as a function of the number of trapped channels. The developed\nformalism reveals very general and provides also a simple way to model the\nexperimentally relevant geometry in which some of the trapped channels are\nabsorbed into an Ohmic contact, leading to energy dissipation.\n", "  Via a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and finite-size\nscaling (FSS) analysis, we study dynamic critical phenomena for the\nvapor-liquid transition in a three dimensional Lennard-Jones system. The phase\nbehavior of the model, including the critical point, have been obtained via the\nMonte Carlo simulations. The transport properties, viz., the bulk viscosity and\nthe thermal conductivity, are calculated via the Green-Kubo relations, by\ntaking inputs from the MD simulations in the microcanonical ensemble. The\ncritical singularities of these quantities are estimated via the FSS method.\nThe results thus obtained are in nice agreement with the predictions of the\ndynamic renormalization group and mode-coupling theories.\n", "  The sensitivity of superconducting qubits allows for spectroscopy and\ncoherence measurements on individual two-level systems present in the\ndisordered tunnel barrier of an $\\mathrm{Al/AlO_x/Al}$ Josephson junction. We\nreport experimental evidence for the decoherence of two-level systems by\nBogoliubov quasiparticles leaking into the insulating $\\mathrm{AlO_x}$ barrier.\nWe control the density of quasiparticles in the junction electrodes either by\nthe sample temperature or by injecting them using an on-chip dc-SQUID driven to\nits resistive state. The decoherence rates were measured by observing the\ntwo-level system's quantum state evolving under application of resonant\nmicrowave pulses and were found to increase linearly with quasiparticle\ndensity, in agreement with theory. This interaction with electronic states\nprovides a noise and decoherence mechanism that is relevant for various\nmicrofabricated devices such as qubits, single-electron transistors, and\nfield-effect transistors. The presented experiments also offer a possibility to\ndetermine the location of the probed two-level systems across the tunnel\nbarrier, providing clues about the fabrication step in which they emerge.\n", "  Markovian master equations (formally known as quantum dynamical semigroups)\ncan be used to describe the evolution of a quantum state $\\rho$ when in contact\nwith a memoryless thermal bath. This approach has had much success in\ndescribing the dynamics of real-life open quantum systems in the lab. Such\ndynamics increase the entropy of the state $\\rho$ and the bath until both\nsystems reach thermal equilibrium, at which point entropy production stops. Our\nmain result is to show that the entropy production at time $t$ is bounded by\nthe relative entropy between the original state and the state at time $2t$. The\nbound puts strong constraints on how quickly a state can thermalise, and we\nprove that the factor of $2$ is tight. The proof makes use of a key physically\nrelevant property of these dynamical semigroups -- detailed balance, showing\nthat this property is intimately connected with the field of recovery maps from\nquantum information theory. We envisage that the connections made here between\nthe two fields will have further applications. We also use this connection to\nshow that a similar relation can be derived when the fixed point is not\nthermal.\n", "  We propose a system where coherent thermal transport between two reservoirs\nin non-galvanic contact is modulated by independently tuning the\nelectron-photon and the electron-phonon coupling. The scheme is based on two\ngate-controlled electrodes capacitively coupled through a dc-SQUID as\nintermediate phase-tunable resonator. Thereby the electron-photon interaction\nis modulated by controlling the flux threading the dc-SQUID and the impedance\nof the two reservoirs, while the electron-phonon coupling is tuned by\ncontrolling the charge carrier concentration in the electrodes. To\nquantitatively evaluate the behavior of the system we propose to exploit\ngraphene reservoirs. In this case, the scheme can work at temperatures reaching\n1 K, with unprecedented temperature modulations as large as 245 mK,\ntransmittance up to 99% and energy conversion efficiency up to 50%. Finally,\nthe accuracy of heat transport control allows to use this system as an\nexperimental tool to determine the electron-phonon coupling in two dimensional\nelectronic systems (2DES).\n", "  A pressure-induced topological quantum phase transition has been\ntheoretically predicted for the semiconductor BiTeI with giant Rashba spin\nsplitting. In this work, the evolution of the electrical transport properties\nin BiTeI and BiTeBr is investigated under high pressure. The pressure-dependent\nresistivity in a wide temperature range passes through a minimum at around 3\nGPa, indicating the predicted transition in BiTeI. Superconductivity is\nobserved in both BiTeI and BiTeBr while the resistivity at higher temperatures\nstill exhibits semiconducting behavior. Theoretical calculations suggest that\nthe superconductivity may develop from the multi-valley semiconductor phase.\nThe superconducting transition temperature Tc increases with applied pressure\nand reaches a maximum value of 5.2 K at 23.5 GPa for BiTeI (4.8 K at 31.7 GPa\nfor BiTeBr), followed by a slow decrease. Our results demonstrate that BiTeX (X\n= I, Br) compounds with non-trivial topology of electronic states display new\nground states upon compression.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the possibility of imaging molecular orbitals from\nphotoelectron spectra obtained via Laser Induced Electron Diffraction (LIED) in\nlinear molecules. This is an extension of our work published recently in\nPhysical Review A \\textbf{94}, 023421 (2016) to the case of the HOMO-1 orbital\nof the carbon dioxide molecule. We show that such an imaging technique has the\npotential to image molecular orbitals at different internuclear distances in a\nsub-femtosecond time scale and with a resolution of a fraction of an\nAngstr\\\"om.\n", "  The fringe pattern that allows geometrical and orbital structure information\nto be extracted from LIED spectra of symmetric molecules is shown to reflect a\nsymmetry conservation principle. We show that under a field polarization which\npreserves certain symmetry elements of the molecule, the symmetry character of\nthe initial wave function is conserved during its time-evolution. We present a\nsymmetry analysis of a deviation from a perfect alignment by decomposing the\nfield into a major, symmetry-determining part, and a minor, symmetry breaking,\npart. This decomposition leads to a corresponding factorization of the\ntime-evolution operator. The formalism is applied to the analysis of the\nrobustness of LIED readings and inversions with respect to deviations from a\nperfect perpendicular and parallel alignment of a symmetric ABA triatomic\nmolecule. The results indicate a particularly strong stability of the type of\nLIED spectra associated with the perpendicular alignment situation.\n", "  We study the dynamical aspects of dark energy in the context of a\nnon-minimally coupled scalar field with curvature and torsion. Whereas the\nscalar field acts as the source of the trace mode of torsion, a suitable\nconstraint on the torsion pseudo-trace provides a mass term for the scalar\nfield in the effective action. In the equivalent scalar-tensor framework, we\nfind explicit cosmological solutions representing dark energy in both Einstein\nand Jordan frames. We demand the dynamical evolution of the dark energy to be\nweak enough, so that the present-day values of the cosmological parameters\ncould be estimated keeping them within the confidence limits set for the\nstandard $\\L$CDM model from recent observations. For such estimates, we examine\nthe variations of the effective matter density and the dark energy equation of\nstate parameters over different redshift ranges. In spite of being weakly\ndynamic, the dark energy component differs significantly from the cosmological\nconstant, both in characteristics and features, for e.g. it interacts with the\ncosmological (dust) fluid in the Einstein frame, and crosses the phantom\nbarrier in the Jordan frame. We also obtain the upper bounds on the torsion\nmode parameters and the lower bound on the effective Brans-Dicke parameter. The\nlatter turns out to be fairly large, and in agreement with the local gravity\nconstraints, which therefore come in support of our analysis.\n", "  Topological insulators are new class of materials which are characterized by\na bulk band gap like ordinary band insulator but have protected conducting\nstates on their edge or surface. These states emerge out due to the combination\nof spin-orbit coupling and time reversal symmetry. Also these states are\ninsensitive to scattering by non-magnetic impurities. A two-dimensional (2D)\ntopological insulator has one dimensional (1D) edge states in which the\nspin-momentum locking of the electrons gives rise to quantum spin Hall effect.\nA three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D\nDirac fermions on its surface. These topological insulator materials have been\ntheoretically predicted and experimentally observed in a variety of 2D and 3D\nsystems, including $\\rm HgTe$ quantum wells, $\\rm BiSb$ alloys, and $\\rm\nBi_{2}Te_{3}$, $\\rm Bi_{2}Se_{3}$ crystals. Moreover, proximity induced\nsuperconductivity in these systems can lead to a state that supports zero\nenergy Majorana fermion and the phase is known as topological superconductors.\nIn this article, the basic idea of topological insulators and topological\nsuperconductors are presented along with their experimental development.\n", "  According to the literature, the S-expansion procedure involving a finite\nsemigroup is valid no matter what the structure of the original Lie\n(super)algebra is; However, when something about the structure of the starting\n(super)algebra is known and when certain particular conditions are met, the\nS-expansion method (with its features of resonance and reduction) is able not\nonly to lead to several kinds of expanded (super)algebras, but also to\nreproduce the effects of the standard as well as the generalized\nIn\\\"on\\\"u-Wigner contraction. In the present paper, we propose a new\nprescription for S-expansion, involving an infinite abelian semigroup\n$S^{(\\infty)}$ and the subtraction of an infinite ideal subalgebra. We show\nthat the subtraction of the infinite ideal subalgebra corresponds to a\nreduction. Our approach is a generalization of the finite S-expansion procedure\npresented in the literature, and it offers an alternative view of the\ngeneralized In\\\"on\\\"u-Wigner contraction. We then show how to write the\ninvariant tensors of the target (super)algebras in terms of those of the\nstarting ones in the infinite S-expansion context presented in this work. We\nalso give some interesting examples of application on algebras and\nsuperalgebras.\n", "  A well-known result of A. Vaintrob characterizes Lie algebroids and their\nmorphisms in terms of homological vector fields on supermanifolds. We give an\ninterpretation of Lie bialgebroids and their morphisms in terms of odd\nsymplectic dg-manifolds, building on the approach of D. Roytenberg. This\nextends naturally to the homotopy Lie case and leads to the notion of\n$L_\\infty$-bialgebroids and $L_\\infty$-morphisms between them.\n", "  The chiral symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field is\nstudied in the framework of logarithmic quark-sigma model with three flavors\n(u,d,s). The effective logarithmic mesonic potential is extended to strange\nquark and is numerically solved in the mean-field approximation. The present\nresults show that the chiral symmetry breaking is sensitive for the strange\nquark flavour in the presence an external magnetic field. In addition, the\neffect of the free parameters is studied. A comparison with original sigma\nmodel is discussed.\n", "  We extend the model of exciton-plasmon materials to include a ro-vibrational\nstructure of molecules using wave-packet propagations on electronic potential\nenergy surfaces. The new model replaces conventional two-level emitters with\nmore complex molecules allowing to examine the influence of alignment and\nvibrational dynamics on strong coupling with surface plasmon-polaritons. We\napply the model to a hybrid system comprising a thin layer of molecules placed\non top of a periodic array of slits. Rigorous simulations are performed for two\ntypes of molecular systems described by vibrational bound-bound and\nbound-continuum electronic transitions. Calculations reveal new features in\ntransmission, reflection and absorption spectra including the observation of\nsignificantly higher values of the Rabi splitting and vibrational patterns\nclearly seen in the corresponding spectra. We also examine the influence of\nanisotropic initial conditions on optical properties of hybrid materials\ndemonstrating that the optical response of the system is significantly affected\nby an initial pre-alignment of the molecules. Our work demonstrates that\npre-aligned molecules could serve as an efficient probe for the sub-diffraction\ncharacterization of the near-field near metal interfaces.\n", "  Multidimensional coherent optical spectroscopy is one of the most powerful\ntools for investigating complex quantum mechanical systems. While it was\nconceived decades ago in magnetic resonance spectroscopy using micro- and\nradio-waves, it has recently been extended into the visible and UV spectral\nrange. However, resolving MHz energy splittings with ultrashort laser pulses\nhas still remained a challenge. Here, we analyze two-dimensional Fourier\nspectra for resonant optical excitation of resident electrons to localized\ntrions or donor-bound excitons in semiconductor nanostructures subject to a\ntransverse magnetic field. Particular attention is devoted to Raman coherence\nspectra which allow one to accurately evaluate tiny splittings of the electron\nground state and to determine the relaxation times in the electron spin\nensemble. A stimulated step-like Raman process induced by a sequence of two\nlaser pulses creates a coherent superposition of the ground state doublet which\ncan be retrieved only optically due to selective excitation of the same\nsub-ensemble with a third pulse. This provides the unique opportunity to\ndistinguish between different complexes that are closely spaced in energy in an\nensemble. The related experimental demonstration is based on photon echo\nmeasurements in an n-type CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well structure detected by a\nheterodyne technique. The difference in the sub-$\\mu$eV range between the\nZeeman splittings of donor-bound electrons and electrons localized at potential\nfluctuations can be resolved even though the homogeneous linewidth of the\noptical transitions is larger by two orders of magnitude.\n", "  A long standing open problem whether a heat engine with finite power achieves\nthe Carnot efficiency is investigated. We rigorously prove a general trade-off\ninequality on thermodynamic efficiency and time interval of a cyclic process\nwith quantum heat engines. In a first step, employing the Lieb-Robinson bound\nwe establish an inequality on the change in a local observable caused by an\noperation far from support of the local observable. This inequality provides a\nrigorous characterization of the following intuitive picture that most of the\nenergy released from the engine to the cold bath remains near the engine when\nthe cyclic process is finished. Using the above description, we finally prove\nan upper bound on efficiency with the aid of quantum information geometry. In\naddition, since our inequality falls down into the conventional second law of\nthermodynamics in Markovian limit, we adopt a completely different treatment\nwhich is developed in the context of classical stochastic processes. Our result\ngenerally excludes the possibility of a process with finite speed at the Carnot\nefficiency in quantum heat engines. In particular, the obtained constraint\ncovers engines evolving with non-Markovian dynamics, which almost all previous\nstudies on this topics fail to address.\n", "  We study the phase space dynamics of cosmological models in the theoretical\nformulations of non-minimal metric-torsion couplings with a scalar field, and\ninvestigate in particular the critical points which yield stable solutions\nexhibiting cosmic acceleration driven by the {\\em dark energy}. The latter is\ndefined in a way that it effectively has no direct interaction with the\ncosmological fluid, although in an equivalent scalar-tensor cosmological setup\nthe scalar field interacts with the fluid (which we consider to be the\npressureless dust). Determining the conditions for the existence of the stable\ncritical points we check their physical viability, in both Einstein and Jordan\nframes. We also verify that in either of these frames, the evolution of the\nuniverse at the corresponding stable points matches with that given by the\nrespective exact solutions we have found in an earlier work (arXiv: 1611.00654\n[gr-qc]). We not only examine the regions of physical relevance for the\ntrajectories in the phase space when the coupling parameter is varied, but also\ndemonstrate the evolution profiles of the cosmological parameters of interest\nalong fiducial trajectories in the effectively non-interacting scenarios, in\nboth Einstein and Jordan frames.\n", "  We study interaction effect of quantum spin Hall state in InAs/GaSb quantum\nwells under an in-plane magnetic field by using the self-consistent mean field\ntheory. We construct a phase diagram as a function of intra-layer and\ninter-layer interactions, and identify two novel phases, a charge/spin density\nwave phase and an exciton condensate phase. The charge/spin density wave phase\nis topologically non-trivial with helical edge transport at the boundary, while\nthe exciton condensate phase is topologically trivial. The Zeeman effect is\nstrongly renormalized due to interaction in certain parameter regimes of the\nsystem, leading to a much smaller g-factor, which may stabilize the helical\nedge transport.\n", "  A high-modulation-efficiency optical modulator integrated on silicon (Si) is\na key enabler for low-power and high-capacity optical interconnects. However,\nSi-based optical modulators suffer from low phase modulation efficiency owing\nto the weak plasma dispersion effect in Si. Therefore, it is essential to find\na novel modulation scheme that is compatible with a Si photonics platform.\nHere, we demonstrate an InGaAsP/Si hybrid metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)\noptical modulator with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) formed by direct\nwafer bonding with an Al2O3 bonding interface. Electron accumulation at the\nInGaAsP MOS interface enables the extraction of the electron-induced refractive\nindex change in InGaAsP, which is significantly greater than that in Si. The\npresented modulator exhibits a phase modulation efficiency of 0.047 Vcm, which\nis approximately 5 times higher than that of Si MOS optical modulators. This\napproach provides a new efficient scheme of phase modulation on a Si photonics\nplatform for low-power, high-speed, and high-density optical links.\n", "  Knowledge of the topology of the electronic ground state of materials has led\nto deep insights to novel phenomena such as the integer quantum Hall effect and\nfermion-number fractionalization, as well as other properties of matter.\nJoining two insulators of different topological classes produces fascinating\nboundary states in the band gap. Another exciting recent development is the\nbottom-up synthesis (from molecular precursors) of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)\nwith atomic precision control of their edge and width. Here we connect these\ntwo fields, and show for the first time that semiconducting GNRs of different\nwidth, edge, and end termination belong to different topological classes. The\ntopology of GNRs is protected by spatial symmetries and dictated by the\nterminating unit cell. We have derived explicit formula for their topological\ninvariants, and show that localized junction states developed between two GNRs\nof distinct topology may be tuned by lateral junction geometry. The topology of\na GNR can be further modified by dopants, such as a periodic array of boron\natoms. In a superlattice consisted of segments of doped and pristine GNRs, the\njunction states are stable spin centers, forming a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic\nspin 1/2 chain with tunable exchange interaction. The discoveries here are not\nonly of scientific interest for studies of quasi one-dimensional systems, but\nalso open a new path for design principles of future GNR-based devices through\ntheir topological characters.\n", "  We explore polarized heavy quarkonium production using the color evaporation\nmodel at leading order. We present the polarized to total yield ratio as a\nfunction of center of mass energy and rapidity in $p+p$ collisions. At energies\nfar above the $Q \\overline Q$ production threshold, we find charmonium and\nbottomonium production to be longitudinally polarized ($J_z=0$). The quarkonium\nstates are also longitudinally polarized at central rapidity, becoming\ntransversely polarized ($J_z=\\pm1$) at the most forward rapidities.\n", "  An analytical study of low-energy electronic excited states in an uniformly\nstrained graphene is carried out up to second-order in the strain tensor. We\nreport an new effective Dirac Hamiltonian with an anisotropic Fermi velocity\ntensor, which reveals the graphene trigonal symmetry being absent in low-energy\ntheories to first-order in the strain tensor. In particular, we demonstrate the\ndependence of the Dirac-cone elliptical deformation on the stretching direction\nrespect to graphene lattice orientation. We further analytically calculate the\noptical conductivity tensor of strained graphene and its transmittance for a\nlinearly polarized light with normal incidence. Finally, the obtained\nanalytical expression of the Dirac point shift allows a better determination\nand understanding of pseudomagnetic fields induced by nonuniform strains.\n", "  We discuss highest $\\ell$-weight representations of quantum loop algebras and\nthe corresponding functional relations between integrability objects. In\nparticular, we compare the prefundamental and $q$-oscillator representations of\nthe positive Borel subalgebras of the quantum group $\\mathrm{U}_q(\\mathcal\nL(\\mathfrak{sl}_{l+1}))$ for arbitrary values of $l$. Our article has partially\nthe nature of a short review, but it also contains new results. These are the\nexpressions for the $L$-operators, and the exact relationship between different\nrepresentations, as a byproduct resulting in certain conclusions about\nfunctional relations.\n", "  Stronger selection implies faster evolution---that is, the greater the force,\nthe faster the change. This apparently self-evident proposition, however, is\nderived under the assumption that genetic variation within a population is\nprimarily supplied by mutation (i.e.\\ mutation-driven evolution). Here, we show\nthat this proposition does not actually hold for recombination-driven\nevolution, i.e.\\ evolution in which genetic variation is primarily created by\nrecombination rather than mutation. By numerically investigating population\ngenetics models of recombination, migration and selection, we demonstrate that\nstronger selection can slow down evolution on a perfectly smooth fitness\nlandscape. Through simple analytical calculation, this apparently\ncounter-intuitive result is shown to stem from two opposing effects of natural\nselection on the rate of evolution. On the one hand, natural selection tends to\nincrease the rate of evolution by increasing the fixation probability of fitter\ngenotypes. On the other hand, natural selection tends to decrease the rate of\nevolution by decreasing the chance of recombination between immigrants and\nresident individuals. As a consequence of these opposing effects, there is a\nfinite selection pressure maximizing the rate of evolution. Hence, stronger\nselection can imply slower evolution if genetic variation is primarily supplied\nby recombination.\n", "  The direct detection of gravitational waves provides the opportunity to\nmeasure fundamental aspects of gravity which have never been directly probed\nbefore, including the polarization of gravitational waves. In the context of\nsearches for continuous waves from known pulsars, we present novel methods to\ndetect signals of any polarization content, measure the modes present and place\nupper-limits on the amplitude of non-tensorial components. This will allow us\nto obtain new model-independent, dynamical constraints on deviations from\ngeneral relativity. We test this framework on multiple potential sources using\nsimulated data from three advanced-era detectors at design sensitivity. We find\nthat signals of any polarization will become detectable and distinguishable for\ncharacteristic strains $h\\gtrsim 3\\times10^{-27} \\sqrt{1~{\\rm yr}/T}$, for an\nobservation time $T$. We also find that our ability to detect non-tensorial\ncomponents depends only on the power present in those modes, irrespective of\nthe strength of the tensorial strain.\n", "  The appearance of negative terms in quasiprobability representations of\nquantum theory is known to be inevitable, and, due to its equivalence with the\nonset of contextuality, of central interest in quantum computation and\ninformation. Until recently, however, nothing has been known about how much\nnegativity is necessary in a quasiprobability representation. Zhu proved that\nthe upper and lower bounds with respect to one type of negativity measure are\nsaturated by quasiprobability representations which are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the elusive symmetric informationally complete quantum\nmeasurements (SICs). We define a family of negativity measures which includes\nZhu's as a special case and consider another member of the family which we call\n\"sum negativity.\" We prove a sufficient condition for local maxima in sum\nnegativity and find exact global maxima in dimensions $3$ and $4$. Notably, we\nfind that Zhu's result on the SICs does not generally extend to sum negativity,\nalthough the analogous result does hold in dimension $4$. Finally, the Hoggar\nlines in dimension $8$ make an appearance in a conjecture on sum negativity.\n", "  We use a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind\nto calculate cosmic ray diffusion coefficients throughout the inner heliosphere\n($2~R_\\odot - 3$ AU). The simulation resolves large-scale solar wind flow,\nwhich is coupled to small-scale fluctuations through a turbulence model.\nSimulation results specify background solar wind fields and turbulence\nparameters, which are used to compute diffusion coefficients and study their\nbehavior in the inner heliosphere. The parallel mean free path is evaluated\nusing quasi-linear theory, while the perpendicular mean free path is determined\nby non-linear guiding center theory with the random ballistic interpretation.\nSeveral runs examine varying turbulent energy and different solar source dipole\ntilts. We find that for most of the inner heliosphere, the radial mean free\npath (mfp) is dominated by diffusion parallel to the mean magnetic field; the\nparallel mfp remains at least an order of magnitude larger than the\nperpendicular mfp, except in the heliospheric current sheet, where the\nperpendicular mfp may be a few times larger than the parallel mfp; in the\necliptic region, the perpendicular mfp may influence the radial mfp at\nheliocentric distances larger than 1.5 AU; our estimations of the parallel mfp\nin the ecliptic region at 1 AU agree well with the Palmer \"consensus\" range of\n$0.08 - 0.3$ AU; solar activity increases perpendicular diffusion and reduces\nparallel diffusion; the parallel mfp varies with rigidity $(P)$ as $P^{.33}$,\nand the perpendicular mfp is weakly dependent on $P$; the mfps are weakly\ninfluenced by the choice of long wavelength power spectra.\n", "  We derive quantum trajectories (also known as stochastic master equations)\nthat describe an arbitrary quantum system probed by a propagating wave packet\nof light prepared in a continuous-mode Fock state. We consider three detection\nschemes of the output light: photon counting, homodyne detection, and\nheterodyne detection. We generalize to input field states that are\nsuperpositions and or mixtures of Fock states and illustrate the formalism with\nseveral examples.\n", "  We consider a random walk model in a one-dimensional environment, formed by\nseveral zones of finite width with the fixed transition probabilities. It is\nalso assumed that the transitions to the left and right neighboring points have\nunequal probabilities. In continuous limit, we derive analytically the\nprobability distribution function, which is mainly determined by a walker\ndiffusion and drift and accounts perturbatively for interface effects between\nzones. It is used for computing the probability to find a walker in a given\nspace-time point and the time dependence of the mean squared displacement of a\nwalker, which reveals the transient anomalous diffusion. To justify our\napproach, the probability function is compared with the results of numerical\nsimulations for a three-zone environment.\n", "  A measurement of the splitting scales occuring in the $k_\\mathrm{t}$\njet-clustering algorithm is presented for final states containing a $Z$ boson.\nThe measurement is done using 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data\ncollected at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC in 2012. The measurement is based on charged-particle\ntrack information, which is measured with excellent precision in the\n$p_\\mathrm{T}$ region relevant for the transition between the perturbative and\nthe non-perturbative regimes. The data distributions are corrected for detector\neffects, and are found to deviate from state-of-the-art predictions in various\nregions of the observables.\n", "  We propose a stochastic method to generate exactly the overdamped Langevin\ndynamics of semi-flexible Gaussian chains, conditioned to evolve between given\ninitial and final conformations in a preassigned time. The initial and final\nconformations have no restrictions, and hence can be in any knotted state. Our\nmethod allows the generation of statistically independent paths in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. We show that these conditioned paths can be\nexactly generated by a set of local stochastic differential equations. The\nmethod is used to analyze the transition routes between various knots in\ncrossable filamentous structures, thus mimicking topological reconnections\noccurring in soft matter systems or those introduced in DNA by topoisomerase\nenzymes. We find that the average number of crossings, writhe and unknotting\nnumber are not necessarily monotonic in time and that more complex topologies\nthan the initial and final ones can be visited along the route.\n", "  We demonstrate that the magnetic nanoskyrmion lattice on the Fe monolayer on\nIr(111) and the positions of the Fe atoms can be resolved simultaneously using\nmagnetic exchange force microscopy. Thus, the relation between magnetic and\natomic structure can be determined straightforwardly by evaluating the Fourier\ntransformation of the real space image data. We further show that the magnetic\ncontrast can be mapped on a Heisenberg-like magnetic interaction between tip\nand sample spins. Since our imaging technique is based on measuring forces, our\nobservation paves the way to study skyrmions or other complex spin textures on\ninsulating sample systems with atomic resolution.\n", "  In the next-to-minimal supersymmetric (NMS) Standard Model (SM), it is\npossible for either one of the additional singlet-like scalar and pseudoscalar\nHiggs bosons to be almost degenerate in mass with the ~125 GeV SM-like Higgs\nstate. In the real NMSSM (rNMSSM), when the mass difference between two scalar\nstates is comparable to their individual total decay widths, the quantum\nmechanical interference, due to the relevant diagonal as well as off-diagonal\nterms in the propagator matrix, between them can become sizable. This\npossibility invalidates usage of the narrow width approximation (NWA) to\ncompute the cross section for the production of a di-photon pair with a given\ninvariant mass via resonant Higgs boson(s) in the gluon fusion process at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). When, motivated by the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse, CP-violating (CPV) phases are explicitly invoked in the Higgs sector\nof the NMSSM, all the interaction eigenstates mix to give five CP-indefinite\nphysical Higgs bosons. In this scenario, the interference effects due the\noff-diagonal terms in the Higgs mass matrix that mix the pseudoscalar-like\nstate with the SM-like one can also become significant, when these two are\nsufficiently mass-degenerate. We perform a detailed analysis, in both the real\nand complex NMSSM, of these interference effects, when the full propagator\nmatrix is taken into account, in the production of a photon pair with an\ninvariant mass near 125 GeV through gluon fusion. We find that these effects\ncan account for up to ~40% of the total cross section for certain model\nparameter configurations. We also investigate how such mutually interfering\nstates contributing to the ~125 GeV signal observed at the LHC can be\ndistinguished from a single resonance.\n", "  The magnetic activity of the Sun becomes stronger and weaker over roughly an\n11 year cycle, modulating the radiation and charged particle environment\nexperienced by the Earth as \"space weather\". Decades of observations from the\nMount Wilson Observatory have revealed that other stars also show regular\nactivity cycles in their Ca II H+K line emission, and identified two different\nrelationships between the length of the cycle and the rotation rate of the\nstar. Recent observations at higher cadence have allowed the discovery of\nshorter cycles with periods between 1-3 yr. Some of these shorter cycles\ncoexist with longer cycle periods, suggesting that two underlying dynamos can\noperate simultaneously. We combine these new observations with previous data,\nand we show that the longer and shorter cycle periods agree remarkably well\nwith those expected from an earlier analysis based on the mean activity level\nand the rotation period. The relative turbulent length scales associated with\nthe two branches of cyclic behavior suggest that a near-surface dynamo may be\nthe dominant mechanism that drives cycles in more active stars, whereas a\ndynamo operating in deeper layers may dominate in less active stars. However,\nseveral examples of equally prominent long and short cycles have been found at\nall levels of activity of stars younger than 2.3 Gyr. Deviations from the\nexpected cycle periods show no dependence on the depth of the convection zone\nor on the metallicity. For some stars that exhibit longer cycles, we compute\nthe periods of shorter cycles that might be detected with future high-cadence\nobservations.\n", "  Concatenation of two quantum error correcting codes with complementary sets\nof transversal gates can provide a means towards universal fault-tolerant\ncomputation. We first show that it is generally preferable to choose the inner\ncode with the higher pseudo-threshold in order to achieve lower logical failure\nrates. We then explore the threshold properties of a wide range of\nconcatenation schemes. Notably, we demonstrate that the concatenation of\ncomplementary sets of Reed-Muller codes can increase the code capacity\nthreshold under depolarizing noise when compared to extensions of previously\nproposed concatenation models. We also analyze the properties of logical errors\nunder circuit level noise, showing that smaller codes perform better for all\nsampled physical error rates. Our work provides new insights into the\nperformance of universal concatenated quantum codes for both code capacity and\ncircuit level noise.\n", "  Stimulated by the BESIII observation of $X(2100)$, $X(2500)$, and\n$\\eta(2225)$, we try to pin down new pseudoscalar meson nonets including these\nstates. The analysis of mass spectra and the study of strong decays indicate\nthat $X(2120)$ and $\\eta(2225)$ associated with $\\pi(2070)$ and the predicted\nkaon $K(2150)$ may form a new pseudoscalar meson nonet. In addition, more\nexperimental data for $X(2100)$ are necessary to determine its structure of\nnonets. Then, $X(2500)$, $X(2370)$, $\\pi(2360)$, and the predicted kaon\n$K(2414)$ can be grouped into another new nonet. These assignments to the\ndiscussed pseudoscalar states can be further tested in experiment.\n", "  The challenge of heavy metal detection for environmental, industrial and\nmedical purposes has led to the development of many analytical techniques.\nStripping voltammetry is a very sensitive electrochemical method and has been\nwidely used for heavy metal detection. Carbon nanotubes, a well-studied carbon\nmaterial with physical and chemical properties suited for electrode material is\ncommonly employed for sensitive and selective metal detection in\nelectrochemistry. This article reviews the recent (2011-2016) applications of\ncarbon nanotubes as an electrode or electrode surface modifier for heavy metals\ndetection with stripping voltammetry.\n", "  There are investigated the generalized methods of cognition of the Existing,\ni.e. everything that is able to influence to the cognizer, and everything\ndiffered from the Existing is postulated as indistinguishable from the\nnon-existing and incognizable. The traditional methods of cognition, based on\nthe identification of the objects of the surrounding world, take into account\nnot all influences, because are limited by the nature, understood as the\nontology of the subject of cognition. The ontology is determined on the level\nof basic notions and definitions, so even if objects from the representation\nsystems different by ontology are identified, they look undetermined, uncertain\nand paradoxical, exactly as, for example, the quantum mechanical objects or\ncosmological dark matter and energy. The representation systems with different\nontology are incompatible with each other on the level of basic notions and\ncannot be unified on frames of one consistent system or theory. The concept of\nincompatible representations unifies on the level exceeded the ontological\nframes the different by ontology representation systems and incompatible\napproaches, such as relativistic and quantum ones. The concept gives a\npossibility to eliminate the principal contradictions of the system approach in\nscientific cognition, so solves the problem of understanding in science. The\ngeneralized methods of cognition are by definition on the foundations of\ndifferent representation systems: scientific, philosophical, religious and\nsocial ones, what gives a possibility of general analysis and revision of their\nfoundations. The interconnections of some physical theories, the philosophical,\nreligious and social systems are briefly analyzed from this point of view.\nThere are briefly considered the multi-polar picture of the world, which the\nconcept of incompatible representations leads to.\n", "  We perform a fully self-consistent study of domain walls between different\nchiral domains in chiral $d_{x^2-y^2} \\pm id_{xy}-wave superconductors with an\nunderlying honeycomb lattice structure. We investigate domain walls along all\npossible armchair and zigzag directions and with a finite global phase shift\nacross the domain wall, in addition to the change of chirality. For armchair\ndomain walls we find the lowest domain wall energy at zero global phase shift,\nwhile the most favorable zigzag domain wall has a finite global phase shift\ndependent on the doping level. Below the van Hove singularity the armchair\ndomain wall is most favorable, while at even higher doping the zigzag domain\nwall has the lowest energy. The domain wall causes a local suppression of the\nsuperconducting order parameter, with the superconducting recovery length\nfollowing a universal curve for all domain walls. Moreover, we always find four\nsubgap states crossing zero energy and well localized to the domain wall.\nHowever, the details of their energy spectrum vary notably, especially with the\nglobal phase shift across the domain wall.\n", "  We study a model of interacting run-and-tumble random walkers operating under\nmutual hardcore exclusion on a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions. We incorporate a finite, Poisson-distributed, tumble duration so\nthat a particle remains stationary whilst tumbling, thus generalising the\npersistent random walker model. We present the exact solution for the\nnonequilibrium stationary state of this system in the case of two random\nwalkers. We find this to be characterised by two lengthscales, one arising from\nthe jamming of approaching particles, and the other from one particle moving\nwhen the other is tumbling. The first of these lengthscales vanishes in a\nscaling limit where the continuous-space dynamics is recovered whilst the\nsecond remains finite. Thus the nonequilibrium stationary state reveals a rich\nstructure of attractive, jammed and extended pieces.\n", "  We evaluate the three-loop massive vacuum bubble diagrams in terms of\npolylogarithms up to weight six. We also construct the basis of irrational\nconstants being harmonic polylgarithms of arguments $e^{k i \\pi/3}$.\n", "  Effects of nanostructured defects of copper solid surface on the bubble\ngrowth in liquid argon have been investigated through a hybrid\natomistic-continuum method. The same solid surfaces with five different\nnanostructures, namely, wedge defect, deep rectangular defect (R-I), shallow\nrectangular defect (R-II), small rectangular defect (R-III) and no defect, have\nbeen modeled at molecular level. The liquid argon is placed on top of the hot\nsolid copper with superheat of 30 K after equilibration is achieved with CFD-MD\ncoupled simulation. Phase change of argon on five nanostructures has been\nobserved and analyzed accordingly. The results showed that the solid surface\nwith wedge defect tends to induce a nano-bubble relatively more easily than the\nothers, and the larger the size of the defect is the easier the bubble\ngenerate.\n", "  We investigate the anomalous flavour changing neutral current (FCNC)\ninteractions of top quark through the process $e^{-}p\\to e^{-}W^{\\pm}q+X$. We\ncalculate the signal and background cross sections in electron proton\ncollisions at Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) with a 7 TeV proton beam\nfrom the LHC and a new 60 GeV electron beam from energy recovery linac (ERL).\nWe study the relevant background processes including one electron and three\njets in the final state. The distributions of the invariant mass of two jets\nand an additional jet tagged as $b$-jet are used to account signal and\nbackground events after the analysis cuts. We find upper bounds on anomalous\nFCNC couplings $\\lambda$ of the order of $10^{-2}$ at LHeC for a luminosity\nprojection of $100$ fb$^{-1}$ together with the fast simulation of detector\neffects. As a matter of interest, we analyze the sensitivity to the couplings\n$(\\lambda_{u},\\lambda_{c})$ and find an enhanced sensitivity to $\\lambda_{c}$\nat the LHeC when compared to the results from the HERA.\n", "  Type IIn supernovae (SNe), a rare subclass of core collapse SNe, explode in\ndense circumstellar media that have been modified by the SNe progenitors at\ntheir last evolutionary stages. The interaction of the freely expanding SN\nejecta with the circumstellar medium gives rise to a shock wave propagating in\nthe dense SN environment, which may accelerate protons to multi-PeV energies.\nInelastic proton-proton collisions between the shock-accelerated protons and\nthose of the circumstellar medium lead to multi-messenger signatures. Here, we\nevaluate the possible neutrino signal of type IIn SNe and compare with IceCube\nobservations. We employ a Monte Carlo method for the calculation of the diffuse\nneutrino emission from the SN IIn class to account for the spread in their\nproperties. The cumulative neutrino emission is found to be ~ 10 per cent of\nthe observed IceCube neutrino flux above 60 TeV. Type IIn SNe would be the\ndominant component of the diffuse astrophysical flux, only if 4 per cent of all\ncore collapse SNe were of this type and 20 to 30 per cent of the shock energy\nwas channeled to accelerated protons. Lower values of the acceleration\nefficiency are accessible by the observation of a single type IIn SN as a\nneutrino point source with IceCube using up-going muon neutrinos. Such an\nidentification is possible in the first year following the SN shock breakout\nfor sources within 20 Mpc.\n", "  In the conventional ferromagnetic systems, topological magnon bands and\nthermal Hall effect are due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In\nprinciple, however, the DMI is either negligible or it is not allowed by\nsymmetry in some quantum magnets. Therefore, we expect that topological magnon\nfeatures will not be present in those systems. In addition, quantum magnets on\nthe triangular-lattice are not expected to possess topological features as the\nDMI or spin-chirality cancels out due to equal and opposite contributions from\nadjacent triangles. Here, however, we predict that the isomorphic frustrated\nhoneycomb-lattice and bilayer triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic system will\nexhibit topological magnon bands and topological thermal Hall effect in the\nabsence of an intrinsic DMI. These unconventional topological magnon features\nare present as a result of magnetic-field-induced non-coplanar spin\nconfigurations with nonzero scalar spin chirality. The relevance of the results\nto realistic bilayer triangular antiferromagnetic materials are discussed.\n", "  One longstanding problem for the potential habitability of planets within M\ndwarf systems is their likelihood to be tidally locked in a synchronously\nrotating spin state. This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a\nplanetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of\nplanets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise\nsynchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin\nstate, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with\nfull surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in\nilluminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus\non habitability. We also find that the resultant spin state can be very\nsensitive to initial conditions due to the chaotic nature of the spin state at\nearly times within certain regimes. We apply our model to two hypothetical\nplanetary systems inspired by the K00255 and TRAPPIST-1 systems, which both\nhave Earth-sized planets in mean-motion resonances orbiting cool stars.\n", "  We investigate the time evolution towards the asymptotic steady state of a\none dimensional interacting system after a quantum quench. We show that at\nfinite time the latter induces entanglement between right- and left- moving\ndensity excitations, encoded in their cross-correlators, which vanishes in the\nlong-time limit. This behavior results in a universal time-decay in system\nspectral properties $ \\propto t^{-2} $, in addition to non-universal power-law\ncontributions typical of Luttinger liquids. Importantly, we argue that the\npresence of quench-induced entanglement clearly emerges in transport\nproperties, such as charge and energy currents injected in the system from a\nbiased probe, and determines their long-time dynamics. In particular, energy\nfractionalization phenomenon turns out to be a promising platform to observe\nthe universal power-law decay $ \\propto t^{-2} $ induced by entanglement and\nrepresents a novel way to study the corresponding relaxation mechanism.\n", "  Iorgov, Lisovyy, and Teschner established a connection between isomonodromic\ndeformation of linear differential equations and Liouville conformal field\ntheory at $c=1$. In this paper we present a $q$ analog of their construction.\nWe show that the general solution of the $q$-Painlev\\'e VI equation is a ratio\nof four tau functions, each of which is given by a combinatorial series arising\nin the AGT correspondence. We also propose conjectural bilinear equations for\nthe tau functions.\n", "  The nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest open questions in\nphysics. Intriguingly, it has been suggested that dark matter may be explained\nby another recently observed phenomenon: the detection of gravitational waves\nby LIGO. LIGO's detection of gravitational waves from merging stellar mass\nblack holes renewed attention toward the possibility that dark matter consists\nsolely of black holes created in the very early universe and that these\nprimordial black holes are what LIGO is presently observing. Subsequent work on\nthis topic has ruled out the possibility that dark matter could consist solely\nof black holes similar to those that LIGO has detected with masses above 10\nsolar masses. However, LIGO's connection to dark matter remains an open\nquestion and in this work we consider a distribution of primordial black holes\nthat accounts for all of the dark matter, is consistent with LIGO's\nobservations arising from primordial black hole binaries, and resolves tension\nin previous surveys of microlensing events in the Milky Way halo. The\nprimordial black hole mass distribution that we consider offers an important\nprediction--LIGO may detect black holes smaller than have ever been observed\nwith ~1% of the black holes it detects having a mass less than the mass of our\nSun. Approximately one year of operating advanced LIGO at design sensitivity\nshould be adequate to begin to see a hint of a primordial black hole mass\ndistribution. Detecting primordial black hole binaries below a solar mass will\nbe readily distinguishable from other known compact binary systems, thereby\nproviding an unambiguous observational window for advanced LIGO to pin down the\nnature of dark matter.\n", "  A turbulent dynamo in spherical geometry with an outer corona is simulated to\nstudy the sign of magnetic helicity in the outer parts. In agreement with\nearlier studies, the sign in the outer corona is found to be opposite to that\ninside the dynamo. Line-of-sight observations of polarized emission are\nsynthesized to explore the feasibility of using the local reduction of Faraday\ndepolarization to infer the sign of helicity of magnetic fields in the solar\ncorona. This approach was previously identified as an observational diagnostic\nin the context of galactic magnetic fields. Based on our simulations, we show\nthat this method can be successful in the solar context if sufficient\nstatistics is gathered by using averages over ring segments in the corona\nseparately for the regions north and south of the solar equator.\n", "  Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) plays a critical role in the\ndevelopment of spintronics, thereby demanding new strategies to control PMA.\nHere we demonstrate a conceptually new type of interface induced PMA that is\ncontrolled by oxygen octahedral rotation. In superlattices comprised of\nLa$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ and SrIrO$_{3}$, we find that all superlattices\n(0$\\leq$x$\\leq$1) exhibit ferromagnetism despite the fact that\nLa$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ is antiferromagnetic for x$>$0.5. PMA as high as\n4$\\times$10$^6$ erg/cm$^3$ is observed by increasing x and attributed to a\ndecrease of oxygen octahedral rotation at interfaces. We also demonstrate that\noxygen octahedral deformation cannot explain the trend in PMA. These results\nreveal a new degree of freedom to control PMA, enabling discovery of emergent\nmagnetic textures and topological phenomena.\n", "  This paper is the first of several parts introducing a new powerful algebra:\nthe algebra of the pseudo-observables. This is a C*-algebra whose set is formed\nby formal expressions involving observables. The algebra is constructed by\napplying the Occam's razor principle, in order to obtain the minimal\ndescription of physical reality. Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of\nquantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical\nexplanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the\nstructure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of Werner Heisenberg's\nformulation of quantum mechanics. Last but not least, the very general\nhypotheses assumed, allow one to state that quantum mechanics is the unique\nminimal description of physical reality.\n", "  POLAR is a new satellite-born detector aiming to measure the polarization of\nan unprecedented number of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the 50-500 keV energy range. The\ninstrument, launched on-board the Tiangong-2 Chinese Space lab on the 15th of\nSeptember 2016, is designed to measure the polarization of the hard X-ray flux\nby measuring the distribution of the azimuthal scattering angles of the\nincoming photons. A detailed understanding of the polarimeter and specifically\nof the systematic effects induced by the instrument's non-uniformity are\nrequired for this purpose. In order to study the instrument's response to\npolarization, POLAR underwent a beam test at the European Synchrotron Radiation\nFacility in France. In this paper both the beam test and the instrument\nperformance will be described. This is followed by an overview of the Monte\nCarlo simulation tools developed for the instrument. Finally a comparison of\nthe measured and simulated instrument performance will be provided and the\ninstrument response to polarization will be presented.\n", "  It is suggested that the apparently disparate cosmological phenomena\nattributed to so-called 'dark matter' and 'dark energy' arise from the same\nfundamental physical process: the emergence, from the quantum level, of\nspacetime itself. This creation of spacetime results in metric expansion around\nmass points in addition to the usual curvature due to stress-energy sources of\nthe gravitational field. A recent modification of Einstein's theory of general\nrelativity by Chadwick, Hodgkinson, and McDonald incorporating spacetime\nexpansion around mass points, which accounts well for the observed galactic\nrotation curves, is adduced in support of the proposal. Recent observational\nevidence corroborates a prediction of the model that the apparent amount of\n'dark matter' increases with the age of the universe. In addition, the proposal\nleads to the same result for the small but nonvanishing cosmological constant,\nrelated to 'dark energy, as that of the causet model of Sorkin et al.\n", "  The fabrication of high-quality organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskite\nlayers is the key prerequisite for the realization of high efficient photon\nenergy harvest and electric energy conversion in their related solar cells. In\nthis article, we report a novel fabrication technique of CH3NH3PbI3 layer based\non high temperature chemical vapor reaction. CH3NH3PbI3 layers have been\nprepared by the reaction of PbI2 films which were deposited by pulsed laser\ndeposition, with CH3NH3I vapor at various temperatures from 160 oC to 210 oC.\nX-ray diffraction patterns confirm the formation of pure phase, and\nphotoluminescence spectra show the strong peak at around 760 nm. Scanning\nelectron microscopy images confirm the significantly increased average grain\nsize from nearly 1 {\\mu}m at low reaction temperature of 160 oC to more than 10\n{\\mu}m at high reaction temperature of 200 oC. The solar cells were fabricated,\nand short-circuit current density of 15.75 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage of 0.49\nV and fill factor of 71.66% have been obtained.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study acoustic resonance in\nlow-temperature glass by applying a small periodic shear at a boundary wall.\nShear wave resonance occurs as the frequency $\\omega$ approaches $\\omega_\\ell=\n\\pi c_\\perp\\ell/L$ ($\\ell=1, 2, 3,...)$. Here, $c_\\perp$ is the transverse\nsound speed and $L$ is the cell length. At resonance, large-amplitude sound\nwaves appear after many cycles even for very small applied strains. They then\ninduce plastic events, which are heterogeneous in space and intermittent on\ntime scales longer than the oscillation period $2\\pi/\\omega$. From these\nirreversible particle motions, there arises strong dissipation suppressing the\ngrowth of sounds. After many resonant cycles, we observe a phenomenon of forced\naging, where the shear modulus (measured after switching off the oscillation)\nis increased significantly.Sometimes, exceptionally large plastic events and\nsystem-size sliding motions induce a transition from resonant to off-resonant\nstates. At resonance, translational diffusion becomes appreciable as well as\naging due to enhanced configurational changes.\n", "  In this letter, we take a new approach to the explanation of the inverse\nisotope effect in PdH(D). Our approach introduces two new aspects. First, we\ntook into account the experimental evidence that at temperatures below 50 K,\nthe crystal structure of PdH and of PdD is zincblende. Second, we studied the\ncontribution of both, the electron-phonon and the electron-electron\ninteractions. We used the Migdal-Eliashberg theory to perform our ab initio\ncalculations. We found that the electron-electron contribution is the most\nimportant one to explain the inverse isotope effect. We reproduced the\nexperimentally found values for the critical temperature and the isotope\ncoefficient. Our analysis represents a direct and simple explanation for the\ninverse isotope effect in PdH(D).\n", "  The models of cyclic universes and cyclic multiverses based on the\nalternative gravity theories of varying constants are considered.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamics of a spin-qubit periodically driven\nin both longitudinal and transverse directions by two classical fields\nrespectively a radio-frequency (RF) and a microwave (MW) field operating at\nphase difference $\\phi$. The qubit is simultaneously locally subject to a\nlinearly polarized magnetic field which changes its sign at a degeneracy point\nin the longitudinal direction and remains constant in the transverse direction.\nWe superimpose the RF and MW signals respectively to the longitudinal and\ntransverse components of the magnetic field. The proposed model may be used to\noptimize the control of a qubit in quantum devices. The various fields applied\nare relevant to {\\it nearly-decouple} the spin-qubit from its environment,\nminimize decoherence effects and improve on the coherence time. The study is\ncarried out in the Schr\\\"odinger and Bloch pictures. We consider the limits of\nweak and strong longitudinal drives set up by comparing the characteristic time\nof non-adiabatic transitions with the coherence time of the longitudinal drive.\nExpressions for populations are compared with numerics and remarkable\nagreements are observed as both solutions are barely discernible.\n", "  Using information on geomagnetic activity, sunspot numbers and cosmogenic\nisotopes, supported by historic eclipse images and in conjunction with models,\nit has been possible to reconstruct annual means of solar wind speed and number\ndensity and heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) intensity since 1611, when\ntelescopic observations of sunspots began. These models are developed and tuned\nusing data recorded by near-Earth interplanetary spacecraft and by solar\nmagnetograms over the past 53 years. In this paper, we use these\nreconstructions to quantify power input into the magnetosphere over the past\n400 years. For each year, both the annual mean power input is computed and its\ndistribution in daily means. This is possible because the distribution of daily\nvalues divided by the annual mean is shown to maintain the same lognormal form\nwith a constant variance. This study is another important step towards the\ndevelopment of a physics-based, long-term climatology of space weather\nconditions.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of variable range hopping conduction\nin focused-ion-beam (FIB) fabricated ultra-narrow nanowires of topological\ninsulator (Bi2Se3). The value of the exponent in the hopping equation was\nextracted as ~ 1/2 for different widths of nanowires, which is the proof of the\npresence of Efros-Shklovskii hopping transport mechanism in a strongly\ndisordered system. High localization lengths (0.5nm, 20nm) were calculated for\nthe devices. A careful analysis of the temperature dependent fluctuations\npresent in the magnetoresistance curves, using the standard Universal\nConductance Fluctuation theory, indicates the presence of 2D topological\nsurface states. Also, the surface state contribution to the conductance was\nfound very close to one conductance quantum. We believe that our experimental\nfindings shed light on the understanding of quantum transport in disordered\ntopological insulator based nanostructures.\n", "  This dissertation discusses some properties of topologically ordered states\nas they appear in the setting of infinite quantum spin systems. We begin by\nstudying the set of infinite volume ground states for Kitaev's abelian quantum\ndouble models. We show that states describing a single excitation in the bulk\nare infinite volume ground states, that is, local perturbations cannot remove\nthe charge. The single excitations states, which are inequivalent for distinct\ncharges, give a complete characterization of the sector theory for the set of\nground states. Furthermore, any pure ground state is equivalent to some single\nexcitation ground state. We proceed to study the stability of charges that are\nclassified by certain representations of the algebra of observables. We\nintroduce a new superselection criterion selecting almost localized and\ntransportable $*$-endomorphisms with respect to a vacuum state. Equivalence\nclasses of representations satisfying the superselection criterion form\ndifferent charged superselection sectors of the system. We show that if the\nvacuum state satisfies certain locality conditions then the superselection\nstructure will be a braided tensor $C^*$-category.\n  Further, this superselection structure is stable up to deformations by a\nquasi-local dynamics.\n  This result is then applied to show that the anyon structure of the abelian\nquantum double models is stable under local perturbations.\n", "  The Cassini spacecraft will enter Saturn's atmosphere on 15th September 2017.\nThis event may be visible from Earth as a 'meteor' flash, and entry dynamics\nsimulations and results from observation of spacecraft entries at Earth are\nsummarized to develop expectations for astronomical observability\n", "  We characterize how suspensions of magnetic particles in a liquid respond to\na magnetic field in terms of the effective magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{eff}$\nusing inductance measurements. We test a model that predicts how $\\chi_{eff}$\nvaries due to demagnetization, as a function of sample aspect ratio, particle\npacking fraction, and particle aspect ratio. For spherical particles or\ncylindrical particles aligned with external magnetic field, the model can be\nfitted to the measured data with agreement within 17\\%. However, we find that\nthe random alignment of particles relative to the magnetic field plays a role,\nreducing $\\chi_{eff}$ by a factor of 3 in some cases, which is not accounted\nfor in models yet. While suspensions are predicted to have $\\chi_{eff}$ that\napproach the particle material susceptibility in the limit of large particle\naspect ratio, instead we find a much smaller particle aspect ratio where\n$\\chi_{eff}$ is maximized. A prediction that $\\chi_{eff}$ approaches the bulk\nmaterial susceptibility in the limit of the packing fraction of the\nliquid-solid transition also fails. We find $\\chi_{eff}$ no larger than about 4\nfor suspensions of iron particles.\n", "  We study the quantum theory of the singular scalar field $\\varphi $ minimally\ncoupled to gravity. In our approach, the scalar field is treated as a true\nquantum variable, while the scale factor $a(t)$ is supposed to be classical. We\nevaluate the quantum average of the self-interaction potential $V(\\varphi)$ and\nuse it in the modified differential equation for the Hubble parameter.\n", "  Ionic electro-active polymer (Nafion for example) can be used as sensor or\nactuator. To this end, a thin film of the water-saturated material is\nsandwiched between two electrodes. Water saturation causes a quasi-complete\ndissociation of the polymer and the release of small cations. The application\nof an electric field across the thickness results in the bending of the strip.\nConversely, a voltage can be detected between the two electrodes when the strip\nis bent. This phenomenon involves multiphysics couplings of\nelectro-mechanical-chemical type. The system is modeled by a deformable porous\nmedium in which flows an ionic solution and we use a continuous medium\napproach. Maxwell's equations and conservation laws of mass, linear momentum\nand energy are first written at the microscopic scale for each phase and\ninterfaces, then for the complete material using an average technique.\nThermodynamics of linear irreversible processes provides the constitutive\nequations : a Kelvin-Voigt stress-strain relation,generalized Fourier's and\nDarcy's laws and a Nernst-Planck equation.\n", "  The compound Atwood's machine (Atm) problem is revisited in order to\nintroduce young students on advanced concepts in Physics. Atm is an\nold-fashioned device. However, it allows us to speak about relativity of\nmotion, principle of equivalence, inertial and non-inertial frames of\nreference, general covariance and invariance under coordinate transformations.\nBesides, it also provides experimental support for our theoretical models. We\nhave started with coordinate transformations and inertial and non inertial\nreference frames followed by the principle of equivalence. The composed Atm was\nworked out in the following. We calculate the acceleration in the machine\napplying Newton's Laws to describe its dynamics in an inertial frame on the\nfixed pulley center and in a non-inertial one on the moving pulley center.\nCoordinate transformations mapping inertial frame solutions in non-inertial\nones and vice-versa allow students catch on relativity concepts and the role\nplayed by general covariance. A comparison between these solutions showed the\nimportance of the principle of equivalence in the evaluation of the intensity\nof gravity locally. In addition, according to this coordinate transformation\nthe non-inertial reference frame equations of motion are equivalent to one\nsingle Atm plus one falling mass. Our results have also shown, in agreement\nwith experimental outcomes, that after movement starts single Atm becomes\nlighter than $m_{3}$ mass, consequently $m_{3}$ mass is falling. It is a\nnon-intuitive experimental result first observed for the 1854 Poggendorff's\nfall machine. A measure of single Atm's mass reduction was reported in 2016's\nlast issue of Physics Education.\n", "  The ruggedness of HBT Class-C power amplifiers was improved by adding an\nanti-parallel diode to the amplifier input to limit the negative swing of the\nbase-emitter voltage. The improved amplifier could withstand 3:1 instead of 2:1\nmismatch in CW operation, and 2.5:1 instead of 1.5:1 mismatch in pulse\noperation. In contrast to other approaches with emitter ballast, active\nfeedback, or electrostatic discharge protection circuits, the present approach\nis simple to implement and has negligible impact on overall amplifier output\npower, gain or efficiency.\n", "  The darkness of the umbra of the lunar eclipse of August 7 2017 corresponded\nto the predictions of A. Danjon for the Sun at its minimum. It appeared partial\nat moonrise in Rome similarly to the one of April 3, 33 AD in Jerusalem,\nsupposed following the Crucifixion of Christ. The hypothesis of Sun at maximum\nactivity for that historical eclipse is discussed.\n", "  The TeV binary system \\lsi has a compact object in an eccentric orbit around\na Be star about 2 kpc from Earth. \\lsi exhibits modulated gamma-ray emission\naround its 26.5 days orbit, mostly detectable at TeV energies around its\napastron passage, with maximum flux during the $\\phi = 0.55-0.65$ phase range.\nMultiple flaring episodes with nightly flux variability at TeV energies have\nbeen observed since its detection in 2006. At one time significant TeV emission\nwas also detected in late 2010 from the source close to its periastron passage\nat superior conjunction. The TeV spectrum is well fitted by a power law with\nsmall variations of spectral index of $\\sim2.6$ over the years. GeV, X-ray, and\nradio emission have been detected along the entire orbit, enabling detailed\nstudy of the modulation pattern and its super-orbital period, such\ncomprehensive study of the \\lsi orbit in the TeV regime has not been presented\nbefore. VERITAS has observed \\lsi for over a decade now, accruing 200+ hours of\ndata during different parts of its orbit. In this work, we have analyzed all\navailable data for \\lsi since September 2007 in individual phase bins of width\n$\\Delta \\phi = 0.1$ and performed a spectral analysis for two different parts\nof the orbit. TeV emission is now detected in 9 out of 10 phase bins, around\nthe entire orbit for the first time in VERITAS data. Hint of spectral variation\nmight also be present between different parts of the orbit. The implication of\nthese results is discussed in the context of determining the nature of the\nunknown compact object (neutron star or microquasar) and a discussion of the\nabsorption mechanisms in the system.\n", "  As constructed, the Standard Model does not include genuine Second Class\nCurrents, however these can be induced through the breaking of isospin or\ncharge conjugation. The experimental limits from B-Factories are getting closer\nto the predictions made for induced Second Class Currents through isospin\nbreaking in the processes $\\tau\\to\\pi\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\nu_\\tau$, therefore a more\ncareful analysis of the background in these decays becomes necessary. In this\nwork we analyze the $\\tau\\to\\pi\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\gamma\\nu_\\tau$ decays as\nbackground of the non-radiative process. We find that the radiative processes\nare very important background for the non-radiative ones whenever the photon\nescapes detection. Photons cannot be completely excluded since they need to be\nkept for the identification of the eta and eta' in the final state. However, we\nfind that making appropriate cuts in the energy of the photon, this process can\nbe disregarded as an important background.\n", "  The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims at detecting\nultra-high energy extraterrestrial neutrinos via the extensive air showers\ninduced by the decay of tau leptons created in the interaction of neutrinos\nunder the Earth's surface. Consisting of an array of $\\sim10^5$ radio antennas\ndeployed over $\\sim 2\\times10^5\\,\\rm {km}^2$, GRAND plans to reach, for the\nfirst time, an all-flavor sensitivity of $\\sim1.5\\times10^{-10} \\,\\rm GeV\\,\ncm^{-2} \\,s^{-1}\\, sr^{-1}$ above $5\\times10^{17}$ eV and a sub-degree angular\nresolution, beyond the reach of other planned detectors. We describe here\npreliminary designs and simulation results, plans for the ongoing, staged\napproach to the construction of GRAND, and the rich research program made\npossible by GRAND's design sensitivity and angular resolution.\n", "  The observed variability of X-ray binaries over a wide range of time-scales\ncan be understood in the framework of a stochastic propagation model, where\nviscous fluctuations at different radii induce accretion rate variability that\npropagate inwards to the X-ray producing region. The scenario successfully\nexplains the power spectra, the linear rms-flux relation as well as the\ntime-lag between different energy photons. The predictions of this model have\nbeen obtained using approximate analytical solutions or empirically motivated\nmodels which take into account the effect of these propagating variability on\nthe radiative process of complex accretion flows. Here, we study the variation\nof the accretion rate due to such viscous fluctuations using a hydro-dynamical\ncode for the standard geometrically thin, gas pressure dominated $\\alpha$-disc\nwith a zero torque boundary condition. Our results confirm earlier findings\nthat the time-lag between a perturbation and the resultant inner accretion rate\nvariation depends on the frequency (or time-period) of the perturbation. Here\nwe have quantified that the time-lag $t_{lag} \\propto f^{-0.54}$, for\ntime-periods less than the viscous time-scale of the perturbation radius and is\nnearly constant otherwise. This, coupled with radiative process would produce\nthe observed frequency dependent time-lag between different energy bands. We\nalso confirm that if there are random Gaussian fluctuations of the\n$\\alpha$-parameter at different radii, the resultant inner accretion rate has a\npower spectrum which is a power-law.\n", "  We present the results of our calculations for the relative yields of\nneutron-rich fission fragments emitted in $^{208}$Pb ($^{18}$O, fission)\nreaction by using the concept of the conservation of isospin and compare with\nthe experimental data. We take into account a range of isospin values allowed\nby the isospin algebra and assume that the fission fragments are formed in\nIsobaric Analog States. We also take into account the neutron multiplicity data\nfor various neutron-emission channels in each partition, and use them to obtain\nthe weight factors in calculating the yields. We then calculate the relative\nyields of the fission fragments. Our calculated results are able to reproduce\nthe experimental trends reasonably well. This is the first direct evidence of\nthe isospin conservation in neutron-rich systems and may prove a very useful\ntool in their studies.\n", "  Previous Zernike phase-plates, for transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM)\nhave always been made out of carbon. A critical constraint on those\nphase-plates is their fast degradation during use. Here, a Zernike phase-plate\nconsisting out of metal is produced and tested for the first time. For the new\naluminium phase-plate, no charging like for the carbon phase-plate is observed.\nUnder conditions of use, the stability of the aluminium phase-plate, is\nexcellent. For both materials, a distortion in the image's\nFourier-transformation is observed, when inserting the thin-film into the beam\nat the back-focal-plane. This distortion is a negative, spatial-frequency\ndependent phase-shift, that is not equal to a focus-change. A phase-shift and\nan increase of contrast, is observed for the tested phase-plates. Different\ntypes of self-sustaining metal-films are produced with a technique, invented by\nJanbroers et al. All metal-films, produced at room-temperature, exhibit a\npolycrystalline structure, while carbon-films are amorphous. However, a high\ncrystallinity is unfavored, causing distortions in the image and an increase of\nelectron-scattering in the phase-plate, due to diffraction. Using\ncryo-deposition, metal-films are obtained that combine an amorphous structure\nwith beneficial properties of metals such as lower charging and prolonged\ndurability. Investigations with TEM, show a great potential of those cryo-films\nas material for Zernike phase-plates. Thickness-measurements are successfully\ncarried out with atomic-force-mycroscopy at step-edges between the thin-film\nand its substrate. For this, a technique for the preparation of very narrow\nstep-edges is developed here.\n", "  Excited configurations of hydrogen in the oxyhydride BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$\n($x=0.1-0.5$), which are considered to be involved in its hydrogen transport\nand exchange processes, were investigated by positive muon spin relaxation\n($\\mu^+$SR) spectroscopy using muonium (Mu) as a pseudoisotope of hydrogen.\nMuons implanted into the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ perovskite lattice were mainly\nfound in two qualitatively different metastable states. One was assigned to a\nhighly mobile interstitial protonic state, which is commonly observed in\nperovskite oxides. The other was found to form an entangled two\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ system with the nuclear spin of an H$^-$ ion at the anion\nsite. The structure of the (H,Mu) complex agrees well with that of a\nneutralized center containing two H$^-$ ions at a doubly charged oxygen\nvacancy, which was predicted to form in the SrTiO$_{3-\\delta}$ perovskite\nlattice by a computational study [Y. Iwazaki $et$ $al$., APL Materials 2,\n012103 (2014)]. Above 100 K, interstitial Mu$^+$ diffusion and retrapping to a\ndeep defect were observed, which could be a rate-limiting step of macroscopic\nMu/H transport in the BaTiO$_{3-x}$H$_x$ lattice.\n", "  Due to the chemical inertness of 2D hexagonal-Boron Nitride (h-BN), few\natomic-layer h-BN is often used to encapsulate air-sensitive 2D crystals such\nas Black Phosphorus (BP). However, the effects of h-BN on Schottky barrier\nheight, doping and contact resistance are not well known. Here, we investigate\nthese effects by fabricating h-BN encapsulated BP transistors with cobalt (Co)\ncontacts. In sharp contrast to directly Co contacted p-type BP devices, we\nobserve strong n-type conduction upon insertion of the h-BN at the Co/BP\ninterface. First principles calculations show that this difference arises from\nthe much larger interface dipole at the Co/h-BN interface compared to the Co/BP\ninterface, which reduces the work function of the Co/h-BN contact. The Co/h-BN\ncontacts exhibit low contact resistances (~ 4.5 k-ohm), and are Schottky\nbarrier free. This allows us to probe high electron mobilities (4,200 cm2/Vs)\nand observe insulator-metal transitions even under two-terminal measurement\ngeometry.\n", "  We report superconductive iridium pnictides BaxIr4X12 (X = As and P) with a\nfilled skutterudite structure, demonstrating that Ba filling dramatically\nalters their electronic properties and induces a nonmetal-to-metal transition\nwith increasing the Ba content x. The highest superconducting transition\ntemperatures are 4.8 and 5.6 K observed for BaxIr4As12 and BaxIr4P12,\nrespectively. The superconductivity in BaxIr4X12 can classified into the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type with intermediate coupling.\n", "  The thermoelectric voltage developed across an atomic metal junction (i.e., a\nnanostructure in which one or a few atoms connect two metal electrodes) in\nresponse to a temperature difference between the electrodes, results from the\nquantum interference of electrons that pass through the junction multiple times\nafter being scattered by the surrounding defects. Here we report successfully\ntuning this quantum interference and thus controlling the magnitude and sign of\nthe thermoelectric voltage by applying a mechanical force that deforms the\njunction. The observed switching of the thermoelectric voltage is reversible\nand can be cycled many times. Our ab initio and semi-empirical calculations\nelucidate the detailed mechanism by which the quantum interference is tuned. We\nshow that the applied strain alters the quantum phases of electrons passing\nthrough the narrowest part of the junction and hence modifies the electronic\nquantum interference in the device. Tuning the quantum interference causes the\nenergies of electronic transport resonances to shift, which affects the\nthermoelectric voltage. These experimental and theoretical studies reveal that\nAu atomic junctions can be made to exhibit both positive and negative\nthermoelectric voltages on demand, and demonstrate the importance and\ntunability of the quantum interference effect in the atomic-scale metal\nnanostructures.\n", "  As wide-field surveys yield ever more precise measurements, cosmology has\nentered a phase of high precision requiring highly accurate and fast\ntheoretical predictions. At the heart of most cosmological model predictions is\na numerical solution of the Einstein-Boltzmann equations governing the\nevolution of linear perturbations in the Universe. We present PyCosmo, a new\nPython-based framework to solve this set of equations using a special pur- pose\nsolver based on symbolic manipulations, automatic generation of C++ code and\nsparsity optimisation. The code uses a consistency relation of the field\nequations to adapt the time step and does not rely on physical approximations\nfor speed-up. After reviewing the system of first-order linear homogeneous\ndifferential equations to be solved, we describe the numerical scheme\nimplemented in PyCosmo. We then compare the predictions and performance of the\ncode for the computation of the transfer functions of cosmological\nperturbations and compare it to existing cosmological Boltzmann codes. We find\nthat we achieve comparable execution times for comparable accuracies. While\nPyCosmo does not yet have all the features of other codes, our approach is\ncomplementary to existing cosmological Boltzmann solvers and can be used as an\nindependent test of their numerical solutions. The symbolic representation of\nthe Einstein-Boltzmann equation system in PyCosmo provides a convenient\ninterface for implementing extended cosmological models. We also discuss how\nthe PyCosmo framework can also be used as a general framework to compute\ncosmological quantities as well as observables for both interactive and\nhigh-performance batch jobs applications. Information about the PyCosmo package\nand future code releases are available at\nhttp://www.cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab.html.\n", "  The dark colors of Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt (NEB, $7-17^\\circ$N)\nappeared to expand northward into the neighboring zone in 2015, consistent with\na 3-5 year cycle of activity in the NEB. Inversions of thermal-IR imaging from\nthe Very Large Telescope revealed a moderate warming and reduction of aerosol\nopacity at the cloud tops at $17-20^\\circ$N, suggesting subsidence and drying\nin the expanded sector. Two new thermal waves were identified during this\nperiod: (i) an upper tropospheric thermal wave (wavenumber 16-17, amplitude 2.5\nK at 170 mbar) in the mid-NEB that was anti-correlated with haze reflectivity;\nand (ii) a stratospheric wave (wavenumber 13-14, amplitude 7.3 K at 5 mbar) at\n$20-30^\\circ$N. Both were quasi-stationary, confined to regions of eastward\nzonal flow, and are morphologically similar to waves observed during previous\nexpansion events.\n", "  Jupiter's banded appearance may appear unchanging to the casual observer, but\ncloser inspection reveals a dynamic, ever-changing system of belts and zones\nwith distinct cycles of activity. Identification of these long-term cycles\nrequires access to datasets spanning multiple jovian years, but explaining them\nrequires multi-spectral characterization of the thermal, chemical, and aerosol\nchanges associated with visible color variations. The Earth-based support\ncampaign for Juno's exploration of Jupiter has already characterized two\nupheaval events in the equatorial and temperate belts that are part of\nlong-term jovian cycles, whose underlying sources could be revealed by Juno's\nexploration of Jupiter's deep atmosphere.\n", "  The LHCb experiment has the unique possibility, among the LHC experiments, to\nbe operated in fixed target mode, using its internal gas target SMOG. The\nenergy scale achievable at the LHC and the excellent detector capabilities for\nvertexing, tracking and particle identification allow a wealth of measurements\nof great interest for cosmic ray and heavy ions physics. We report the first\nmeasurements made in this configuration: the measurement of antiproton\nproduction in proton-helium collisions and the measurements of open and hidden\ncharm production in proton-argon collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\textrm{NN}} =$ 110\nGeV.\n", "  A method for the determination of integrated longitudinal stellar fields from\nlow-resolution spectra is the so-called slope method, which is based on the\nregression of the Stokes V signal against the first derivative of Stokes I.\nHere we investigate the possibility to extend this technique to measure the\nmagnetic fields of cool stars from high resolution spectra. For this purpose we\ndeveloped a multi-line modification to the slope method, called multi-line\nslope method. We tested this technique by analysing synthetic spectra computed\nwith the COSSAM code and real observations obtained with the high resolution\nspectropolarimeters Narval, HARPSpol and Catania Astrophysical Observatory\nSpectropolarimeter (CAOS). We show that the multi-line slope method is a fast\nalternative to the Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD) technique for the\nmeasurement of the effective magnetic fields of cool stars. Using a Fourier\ntransform on the effective magnetic field variations of the star $\\epsilon$\nEri, we find that the long term periodicity of the field corresponds to the\n2.95 yr period of the stellar dynamo, revealed by the variation of the activity\nindex.\n", "  The first photon emission and the disentanglement of a pair of identical\nbosonic atoms in excited entangled states follow an exponential law. We extend\nthe theory to distinguishable and identical fermionic two-atom systems. As a\nbyproduct of the analysis we determine the symmetries of the fermionic wave\nfunction. We also derive the emission distributions of excited atoms in product\nstates, which must take into account the presence of simultaneous detections.\nComparing both distributions reveals a direct manifestation of the\nmodifications induced by entanglement on the atomic emission properties.\n", "  In ultralong fiber laser key distribution, two sides use standard optical\nequipment to create kilometer long fiber lasers in a communication link to\nestablish a secret key. Its security rests on the assumption that any attacker\nwould need much more sophisticated equipment and techniques than those of the\nlegitimate user in order to discover the generated key. We present a challenge\nto that assumption with a hidden probe attack in which the eavesdropper hides a\nweak signal in the unavoidable noise floor that appears in the laser during\namplification and probes with it the configuration of one or both communication\nparties. We comment how this attack can compromise different proposals for\nultralong laser key distribution and propose possible countermeasures.\n", "  Numerous investigations discuss neutrino properties from low to ultra high\nenergies. This review discusses several topics that are investigated in present\nday experiments. The first section covers the detection of $\\tau$-neutrinos of\ncosmic origin and describes the significance of the results. The second topic\npoints out that the reported reduction of the antineutrino flux in reactor\nexperiments may be created by short wavelength oscillations where the detector\naverages over several wavelengths and observes only an average reduction of the\nantineutrino flux. In many theories the propagating particles are Majoranas and\nhave an anapole moment; they scatter on atomic electrons with a distinct\nsignature in $\\bar\\nu_e+e^-\\rightarrow\\bar\\nu_e+e^-$ scattering.\n", "  Novel low-band-gap copolymer oligomers are proposed on the basis of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) quantum chemical calculations of photophysical\nproperties. These molecules have an electron donor-accepter (D-A) architecture\ninvolving poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as D units and furan, aniline,\nor hydroquinone as A units. Structural parameters, electronic properties,\nhighest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital\n(LUMO) gaps and molecular orbital densities are predicted. The charge transfer\nprocess between the D unit and the A unit one is supported by analyzing the\noptical absorption spectra of the compounds and the localization of the HOMO\nand LUMO.\n", "  We perform a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the transition\nfrom multiphoton to optical-field photoemission from n-doped, single-crystal\nsilicon nanotips. Around this transition, we measure an enhanced emission rate\nas well as intensity-dependent structure in the photoelectron yield from the\nilluminated nanostructures. Numerically solving the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE), we demonstrate that the excess emission derives\nfrom the build-up of standing electronic wavepackets near the surface of the\nsilicon, and the intensity dependent structure in this transition results from\nthe increased ponderomotive potential and channel closing effects. By way of\ntime-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT), we then show that the visibility of\nintensity dependent structure, the transition rate from multiphoton to\noptical-field emission, and scaling rate at high intensities are all consistent\nwith a narrow band of ground-state energies near the conduction band dominating\nthe emission process in silicon. These results highlight the importance of\nconsidering both coherent electron wavepacket dynamics at the emitter surface\nas well as the ground-state energy distribution when interpreting strong-field\nphotoemission from solids.\n", "  This paper presents a half-analytical elastic solution convenient for\nparametric studies of 2D cracked pavements. The pavement structure is reduced\nto three elastic and homogeneous equivalent layers resting on a soil. In a\nsimilar way than the Pasternak's modelling for concrete pavements, the soil is\nmodelled by one layer, named shear layer, connected to Winkler's springs in\norder to ensure the transfer of shear stresses between the pavement structure\nand the springs. The whole four-layer system is modelled using a specific model\ndeveloped for the analysis of delamination in composite materials. It reduces\nthe problem by one dimension and gives access to regular interface stresses\nbetween layers at the edge of vertical cracks allowing the initial debonding\nanalysis. In 2D plane strain conditions, a system of twelve-second order\ndifferential equations is written analytically. This system is solved\nnumerically by the finite difference method (Newmark) computed in the free\nScilab software. The calculus tool allows analysis of the impact of material\ncharacteristics changing, loads and locations of cracks in pavements on the\ndistribution of mechanical fields. The approach with fracture mechanic concepts\nis well suited for practical use and for some subsequent numerical developments\nin 3D.\n", "  CeBr3 is emerging as one of the best scintillators having properties almost\nsimilar to Cerium doped lanthanum halide scintillators. We have measured, for\nthe first time, the intrinsic energy resolution of Compton electrons in a\ncylindrical 1\"x1\" CeBr3 detector using the sources, namely, 137Cs, 22Na and\n60Co employing Compton Coincidence Technique (CCT). We have used PIXIE-4 data\nacquisition system which makes the measurement setup quite compact. The results\nhave shown that non-proportionality is the major factor in limiting the overall\nenergy resolution of CeBr3 and the intrinsic resolution in CeBr3 arises due to\nprocesses other than the scattering of electrons inside the scintillator. We\nhave also studied the dependence of intrinsic energy resolution on the\ncoincidence window and optimized its value for a given source\n", "  A range of percolation models of cluster systems of composites is discussed.\nIn the models the parameters of the clusters of a substance and inner\nboundaries were obtained by the Monte Carlo method, and the possibility of\naffecting the properties of composite materials at the early stages of\nstructure formation was studied.\n", "  We present a two dimensional model describing the elastic behaviour of the\nwall of a curved blood vessel. The wall has a laminate structure consisting of\nseveral anisotropic layers of varying thickness and is assumed to be much\nsmaller in thickness than the radius of the vessel which itself is allowed to\nvary. Our two-dimensional model takes the interaction of the wall with the\nsurrounding tissue and the blood flow into account and is obtained via a\ndimension reduction procedure. The curvature and twist of the vessel axis as\nwell as the anisotropy of the laminate wall present the main challenges in\napplying the dimension reduction procedure so plenty of examples of canonical\nshapes of vessels and their walls are supplied with explicit systems of\ndifferential equations at the end.\n", "  Physical and chemical properties of 2D material are highly sensitive to its\nstructures whose regularity are seldom investigated, here we proposed a simple\nmechanical model whose covalent bonds are connected by angle springs, with\nwhich we gave insight into stability, bending stiffness and some other\nproperties of 2D structures. It is found that Flat, Chair and Washboard possess\nlarger existent possibilities, which are consistent with existing 2D materials'\nstructures. This model is a tool to evaluate existent possibilities of periodic\n2D structures from mechanical viewpoint.\n", "  We investigate the issue of single particle nonlocality in a quantum system\nsubjected to time-dependent boundary conditions. We first prove that contrary\nto earlier claims, there is no strong nonlocality: a quantum state localized at\nthe center of a well with infinitely high moving walls is not modified by the\nwall's motion. We then show the existence of a weak form of nonlocality: when a\nquantum state is extended over the well, the wall's motion induces a current\ndensity all over the box instantaneously. We indicate how this current density\ncan in principle be measured by performing weak measurements of the particle's\nmomentum.\n", "  The advent of quantum computing processors with possibility to scale beyond\nexperimental capacities magnifies the importance of studying their\napplications. Combinatorial optimization problems can be one of the promising\napplications of these new devices. These problems are recurrent in industrial\napplications and they are in general difficult for classical computing\nhardware. In this work, we provide a survey of the approaches to solving\ndifferent types of combinatorial optimization problems, in particular quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems on a gate model quantum\ncomputer. We focus mainly on four different approaches including digitizing the\nadiabatic quantum computing, global quantum optimization algorithms, the\nquantum algorithms that approximate the ground state of a general QUBO problem,\nand quantum sampling. We also discuss the quantum algorithms that are custom\ndesigned to solve certain types of QUBO problems.\n", "  In the present work, we analyze the influence of the polarization effects\ntaking place during the course of a 2DIR spectroscopy experiment performed on a\nmolecular system undergoing an intermolecular vibrational energy transfer\nprocess. When both donor and acceptor molecules participating in the\nvibrational energy transfer are embedded in a host solvent, they face\nrotational diffusion that strongly distorts the resulting 2DIR spectra. It\ncould be expected that the difference between rotational diffusion constants\nwill be of particular interest. For this purpose, the polarization effects are\ndiscussed according to the different orderings of the laser-molecule\ninteractions. Next, we study the distortions of the spectra as a function of\nthe rotational diffusion constants of the individual molecules. The knowledge\nof these polarization effects are relevant to the interpretation of the\nspectra. Finally, the conclusions reached in this work for a vibrational energy\ntransfer are valid for any other type of third-order optical process performed\non the same molecular system.\n", "  Elastic deformation of rigid materials with soft coatings (stratified\nmaterials) due to lubrication forces can also alter the interpretation of\ndynamic surface forces measurements and prevent contact formation between\napproaching surfaces. Understanding the role of elastic deformation on the\nprocess of fluid drainage is necessary, and the case where one (or both) of the\ninteracting materials consists of a rigid substrate with a soft coating is\nstill limited. We combine lubrication theory and solid linear elasticity to\ndescribe the dynamic of fluid drainage past a compliant stratified boundary.\nThe analysis presented covers the full range of coating thicknesses, from an\nelastic foundation to a half-space for an incomressible coating. We decouple\nthe individual contributions of the coating thickness and material properties\non the elastic deformation, hydrodynamic forces, and fluid film thickness. We\nobtain a simple expression for the shift in contact position during force\nmeasurements that is valid for many experimental conditions. We compare\ndirectly the effect of stratification on the out-of-contact deformation to the\nwell-known effect of stratification on indentation. We show that corrections\ndeveloped for stratification in contact mechanics are not applicable to\nelastohydrodynamic deformation. Finally, we provide generalized contour maps\nthat can be employed directly to estimate the elastic deformation present in\nmost dynamic surface force measurements.\n", "  We first present the exact solutions of the single ring-shaped Coulomb\npotential and then realize the visualizations of the space probability\ndistribution for a moving particle within the framework of this potential. We\nillustrate the two-(contour) and three-dimensional (isosurface) visualizations\nfor those specifically given quantum numbers (n, l, m) essentially related to\nthose so-called quasi quantum numbers (n',l',m') through changing the single\nring-shaped Coulomb potential parameter b. We find that the space probability\ndistributions (isosurface) of a moving particle for the special case and the\nusual case are spherical and circular ring-shaped, respectively by considering\nall variables in spherical coordinates. We also study the features of the\nrelative probability values P of the space probability distributions. As an\nillustration, by studying the special case of the quantum numbers (n, l, m)=(6,\n5, 1) we notice that the space probability distribution for a moving particle\nwill move towards two poles of axis z as the relative probability value P\nincreases. Moreover, we discuss the series expansion of the deformed spherical\nharmonics through the orthogonal and complete spherical harmonics and find that\nthe principal component decreases gradually and other components will increase\nas the potential parameter b increases.\n", "  This paper is the third part concluding the introduction of the powerful\nalgebra of the pseudo-observables. In this article will be dealt how to treat\nthe time evolution, and, more in general, the transformations, in the framework\nof the new theory. It will be shown that this requires only minor changes with\nrespect to the Dirac-Jordan transformation theory that can be found in almost\nany textbook, with some more care about the treatment of the continuous limit.\nA remarkable difference is also in the introduction of the time reversal, which\ngives the opportunity to a deeper insight about the Hermitian transposition. In\nthe conclusions, we will examine better the relationship between time evolution\nand measurement, a very problematic aspect in the framework of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation (and in many others ones). Finally we will present a list of\ncompelling reasons for which the physics community would seriously have to\nevaluate a switching to the new formalism.\n", "  Two-dimensional polyaniline with a C3N stoichiometry, is a newly fabricated\nmaterial that has expected to possess fascinating electronic, thermal,\nmechanical and chemical properties . The possibility of further tuning the C3N\nproperties upon the adsorption of foreign adatoms is thus among the most\nattractive researches. We carried out extensive ab-initio density functional\ntheory (DFT) simulations to investigate the adsorption of various elements\nincluding nonmetallic, metalloidic and metallic elements on the C3N monolayer.\nWhile pristine C3N acts as a semiconductor with an indirect electronic band\ngap; the functionalization with nonmetallic and semimetallic elements leads to\na p-type doping and induces metallic behavior to the monolayer. On the other\nhand, metallic adsorption depending on the adatom size and the number of\nvalence electrons may result in semiconducting, half-metallic or metallic\nproperties. Whenever metallic foreign atoms conduct metallic characteristics,\nthey mostly lead to the n-type doping by electron donation to the surface.\nMoreover, adsorption of transition metals could enhance the magnetic behavior\nof the monolayer due to the contribution of d electronic states. These results\nsuggest that C3N illustrates viable electronic-magnetic properties which could\nbe promising for semiconducting, nanosensores and catalytic applications.\n", "  The parameters in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) free induction decay\n(FID) signal contain information that is useful in magnetic field measurement,\nmagnetic resonance sounding (MRS) and other related applications. A real time\nsampled FID signal is well modeled as a finite mixture of exponential sequences\nplus noise. We propose to use the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) for noise\nreduction and characterization, where the generalized Hilbert-Huang represents\na way to decompose a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF) along\nwith a trend, and obtain instantaneous frequency data. Moreover, the HHT for an\nFID signal's feature analysis is applied for the first time. First, acquiring\nthe actual untuned FID signal by a developed prototype of proton magnetometer,\nand then the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is performed to decompose the\nnoise and original FID. Finally, the HHT is applied to the obtained IMFs to\nextract the Hilbert energy spectrum, to indicate the energy distribution of the\nsignal on the frequency axis. By theory analysis and the testing of an actual\nFID signal, the results show that, compared with general noise reduction\nmethods such as auto correlation and singular value decomposition (SVD),\ncombined with the proposed method can further suppress the interfered signals\neffectively, and can obtain different components of FID signal, which can use\nto identify the magnetic anomaly, the existence of groundwater etc. This is a\nvery important property since it can be exploited to separate the FID signal\nfrom noise and to estimate exponential sequence parameters of FID signal.\n", "  We investigate Proca star (PS) solutions, namely boson star (BS) type\nsolutions for a complex vector field with mass and nonminimal coupling to the\nEinstein tensor. Irrespective of the existence of nonminimal coupling, PS\nsolutions are mini-BS type, but the inclusion of it changes properties. For\npositive nonminimal coupling parameters, PS solutions do not exist for central\namplitudes above some certain value due to the singular behavior of the\nevolution equations. For negative nonminimal coupling parameters, there is no\nsuch singular behavior but sufficiently enhanced numerical resolutions are\nrequested for larger amplitudes. Irrespective of the sign of the nonzero\nnonminimal coupling parameter, PSs with the maximal Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass\nand Noether charge are gravitationally bound. Properties of PSs are very\nsimilar to those of BSs in scalar-tensor theories including healthy\nhigher-derivative terms.\n", "  The VVV survey has observed the southern disk of the Milky Way in the near\ninfrared, covering 240 deg$^{2}$ in the $ZYJHK_S$ filters. We search the VVV\nSurvey images in a $\\sim$19 deg$^{2}$ field around $\\alpha$ Centauri, the\nnearest stellar system to the Sun, to look for possible overlooked companions\nthat the baseline in time of VVV would be able to uncover. The photometric\ndepth of our search reaches $Y\\sim$19.3 mag, $J\\sim$19 mag, and $K_S\\sim$17\nmag. This search has yielded no new companions in $\\alpha$ Centauri system,\nsetting an upper mass limit for any unseen companion well into the brown\ndwarf/planetary mass regime. The apparent magnitude limits were turned into\neffective temperature limits, and the presence of companion objects with\neffective temperatures warmer than 325K can be ruled out using different\nstate-of-the-art atmospheric models.\n  These limits were transformed into mass limits using evolutionary models,\ncompanions with masses above 11 M$_{Jup}$ were discarded, extending the\nconstraints recently provided in the literature up to projected distances of\nd<7 000 AU from $\\alpha$ Cen AB and $\\sim$1200 AU from Proxima. In the next few\nyears, the VVV extended survey (VVVX) will allow to extend the search and place\nsimilar limits on brown dwarfs/planetary companions to $\\alpha$ Cen AB for\nseparations up to 20 000AU.\n", "  Direct measurements of VEM using scintillating plastic plates in water\nCherenkov prototype detectors and a muon flux model were previously used to\nreproduce the charge histogram of a detector. In these measurements the VEM has\na significantly lower value than would be obtained by locating the charge\nhistogram maximum.\n  In this technical note we will use the inverse process, being known the\ncharge histogram we will use a simple model to estimate the load distribution\nof the VEM. We will then use this VEM distribution and a one-hour secondary\ncosmic ray flux simulation to estimate the total muon component of the\nhistogram.\n"]}
