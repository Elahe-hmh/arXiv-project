We\nfind a single-letter expression for the entanglement-assisted quantum capacity\nof such channels which closely parallels Gel'fand and Pinsker's solution to the\nclassical version of the same problem. This theorem can also be used to find a\nlower bound on the unassisted quantum capacity of these channels.\n", "  We describe how any two-party quantum computation, specified by a unitary\nwhich simultaneously acts on the registers of both parties, can be privately\nimplemented against a quantum version of classical semi-honest adversaries that\nwe call specious. Our construction requires two ideal functionalities to\ngarantee privacy: a private SWAP between registers held by the two parties and\na classical private AND-box equivalent to oblivious transfer. If the unitary to\nbe evaluated is in the Clifford group then only one call to SWAP is required\nfor privacy. On the other hand, any unitary not in the Clifford requires one\ncall to an AND-box per R-gate in the circuit. Since SWAP is itself in the\nClifford group, this functionality is universal for the private evaluation of\nany unitary in that group. SWAP can be built from a classical bit commitment\nscheme or an AND-box but an AND-box cannot be constructed from SWAP. It follows\nthat unitaries in the Clifford group are to some extent the easy ones. We also\nshow that SWAP cannot be implemented privately in the bare model.\n", "  We use the macroscopic quantum electrodynamics approach suitable for\nabsorbing and dispersing media to study the properties and role of collective\nsurface excitations --- excitons and plasmons --- in single-wall and\ndouble-wall carbon nanotubes. We show that the interactions of excitonic states\nwith surface electromagnetic modes in individual small-diameter (<~1 nm)\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes can result in strong exciton-surface-plasmon\ncoupling. Optical response of individual nanotubes exhibits Rabi splitting ~0.1\neV, both in the linear excitation regime and in the non-linear excitation\nregime with the photoinduced biexcitonic states formation, as the exciton\nenergy is tuned to the nearest interband surface plasmon resonance of the\nnanotube. An electrostatic field applied perpendicular to the nanotube axis can\nbe used to control the exciton-plasmon coupling. For double-wall carbon\nnanotubes, we show that at tube separations similar to their equilibrium\ndistances interband surface plasmons have a profound effect on the inter-tube\nCasimir force. Strong overlapping plasmon resonances from both tubes warrant\ntheir stronger attraction. Nanotube chiralities possessing such collective\nexcitation features will result in forming the most favorable inner-outer tube\ncombination in double-wall carbon nanotubes. These results pave the way for the\ndevelopment of new generation of tunable optoelectronic and\nnano-electromechanical device applications with carbon nanotubes.\n", "  Mechanistic dynamic models of biochemical networks such as Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs) contain unknown parameters like the reaction rate\nconstants and the initial concentrations of the compounds. The large number of\nparameters as well as their nonlinear impact on the model responses hamper the\ndetermination of confidence regions for parameter estimates. At the same time,\nclassical approaches translating the uncertainty of the parameters into\nconfidence intervals for model predictions are hardly feasible.\n  In this article it is shown that a so-called prediction profile likelihood\nyields reliable confidence intervals for model predictions, despite arbitrarily\ncomplex and high-dimensional shapes of the confidence regions for the estimated\nparameters. Prediction confidence intervals of the dynamic states allow a\ndata-based observability analysis. The approach renders the issue of sampling a\nhigh-dimensional parameter space into evaluating one-dimensional prediction\nspaces. The method is also applicable if there are non-identifiable parameters\nyielding to some insufficiently specified model predictions that can be\ninterpreted as non-observability. Moreover, a validation profile likelihood is\nintroduced that should be applied when noisy validation experiments are to be\ninterpreted.\n  The properties and applicability of the prediction and validation profile\nlikelihood approaches are demonstrated by two examples, a small and instructive\nODE model describing two consecutive reactions, and a realistic ODE model for\nthe MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. The presented general approach\nconstitutes a concept for observability analysis and for generating reliable\nconfidence intervals of model predictions, not only, but especially suitable\nfor mathematical models of biological systems.\n", "  Twenty years ago Poole et al. (Nature 360, 324, 1992) suggested that the\nanomalous properties of supercooled water may be caused by a critical point\nthat terminates a line of liquid-liquid separation of lower-density and\nhigher-density water. Here we present an explicit thermodynamic model based on\nthis hypothesis, which describes all available experimental data for\nsupercooled water with better quality and with fewer adjustable parameters than\nany other model suggested so far. Liquid water at low temperatures is viewed as\nan 'athermal solution' of two molecular structures with different entropies and\ndensities. Alternatively to popular models for water, in which the\nliquid-liquid separation is driven by energy, the phase separation in the\nathermal two-state water is driven by entropy upon increasing the pressure,\nwhile the critical temperature is defined by the 'reaction' equilibrium\nconstant. In particular, the model predicts the location of density maxima at\nthe locus of a near-constant fraction (about 0.12) of the lower-density\nstructure.\n", "  We add a minimal correction term to the local Gross-Pitaevskii equation to\nrepresent non-locality in the interactions. We show that the effective minimal\nnon-locality can make the healing length decrease more rapidly with the\nincrease of $s$-wave scattering length leaving the expression of the velocity\nof sound unaltered. We discuss the implication of this result for a\nBose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) being used as an analogue gravity system. The\npresented result is important in the context of condensed matter physics as\nwell because one can considerably change the size of a quantized vortex at\nfinite $s$-wave scattering length by tuning the healing length.\n", "  In the version \\cite{Fiziev14} of this paper we presented for the first time\nthe basic equations and relations for relativistic static spherically symmetric\nstars (SSSS) in the model of minimal dilatonic gravity (MDG). This model is\n{\\em locally} equivalent to the f(R) theory of gravity and gives an alternative\ndescription of the effects of dark matter and dark energy using the\nBranse-Dicke dilaton $\\Phi$. To outline the basic properties of the MDG model\nof SSSS and to compare them with general relativistic results, in the present\npaper we use the relativistic equation of state (EOS) of neutron matter as an\nideal Fermi neutron gas at zero temperature. We overcome the well-known\ndifficulties of the physics of SSSS in the f(R) theories of gravity\n\\cite{Felice10,Berti} applying novel highly nontrivial nonlinear boundary\nconditions, which depend on the global properties of the solution and on the\nEOS. We also introduce two pairs of new notions: cosmological-energy-pressure\ndensities and dilaton-energy-pressure densities, as well as two new EOS for\nthem: cosmological EOS (CEOS) and dilaton EOS (DEOS). Special attention is paid\nto the dilatonic sphere (in brief -- disphere) of SSSS, introduced in this\npaper for the first time. Using several realistic EOS for neutron star (NS):\nSLy, BSk19, BSk20 and BSk21, and current observational two-solar-masses-limit,\nwe derive an estimate for scalar-field-mass $m_\\Phi \\sim 10^{-13} eV/c^2 \\div\n4\\times 10^{-11} eV/c^2$. Thus, the present version of the paper reflects some\nof the recent developments of the topic.\n", "  Scalar-tensor $f(R)$ theory of gravity is considered in the framework of a\nsimple inhomogeneous space-time model. In this we use the reconstruction\ntechnique to look for possible evolving wormhole solutions within viable $f(R)$\ngravity formalism. These $f(R)$ models are then constrained so that they are\nconsistent with existing experimental data. Energy conditions related to the\nmatter threading the wormhole are analysed graphically and are in general found\nto obey the null energy conditions (NEC) in regions around the throat, while in\nthe limit $f(R)=R,$ NEC can be violated at large in regions around the throat.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of constructing Kochen-Specker uncolorable\nsets of idempotent matrices whose entries lie in various rings, including the\nrational numbers, the integers, and finite fields. Most notably, we show that\nthere is no Kochen-Specker coloring of the $n \\times n$ idempotent integer\nmatrices for $n \\geq 3$, thereby illustrating that Kochen-Specker contextuality\nis an inherent feature of pure matrix algebra. We apply this to generalize\nrecent no-go results on noncommutative spectrum functors, showing that any\ncontravariant functor from rings to sets (respectively, topological spaces or\nlocales) that restricts to the Zariski prime spectrum functor for commutative\nrings must assign the empty set (respectively, empty space or locale) to the\nmatrix ring $M_n(R)$ for any integer $n \\geq 3$ and any ring $R$. An appendix\nby Alexandru Chirvasitu shows that Kochen-Specker colorings of idempotents in\npartial subalgebras of $M_3(F)$ for a perfect field $F$ can be extended to\npartial algebra morphisms into the algebraic closure of $F$.\n", "  We study the eigenvalue correlations of random Hermitian $n\\times n$ matrices\nof the form $S=M+\\epsilon H$, where $H$ is a GUE matrix, $\\epsilon>0$, and $M$\nis a positive-definite Hermitian random matrix, independent of $H$, whose\neigenvalue density is a polynomial ensemble. We show that there is a\nsoft-to-hard edge transition in the microscopic behaviour of the eigenvalues of\n$S$ close to $0$ if $\\epsilon$ tends to $0$ together with $n\\to +\\infty$ at a\ncritical speed, depending on the random matrix $M$. In a double scaling limit,\nwe obtain a new family of limiting eigenvalue correlation kernels. We apply our\ngeneral results to the cases where (i) $M$ is a Laguerre/Wishart random matrix,\n(ii) $M=G^*G$ with $G$ a product of Ginibre matrices, (iii) $M=T^*T$ with $T$ a\nproduct of truncations of Haar distributed unitary matrices, and (iv) the\neigenvalues of $M$ follow a Muttalib-Borodin biorthogonal ensemble.\n", "  We give an example of a scalar second order differential operator in the\nplane with double periodic coefficients and describe its modification, which\ncauses an additional spectral band in the essential spectrum. The modified\noperator is obtained by applying to the coefficients a mirror reflection with\nrespect to a vertical or horizontal line. This change gives rise to Rayleigh\ntype waves localized near the line. The results are proven using asymptotic\nanalysis, and they are based on high contrast of the coefficient functions.\n", "  We apply the operation of random independent thinning on the eigenvalues of\n$n\\times n$ Haar distributed unitary random matrices. We study gap\nprobabilities for the thinned eigenvalues, and we study the statistics of the\neigenvalues of random unitary matrices which are conditioned such that there\nare no thinned eigenvalues on a given arc of the unit circle. Various\nprobabilistic quantities can be expressed in terms of Toeplitz determinants and\northogonal polynomials on the unit circle, and we use these expressions to\nobtain asymptotics as $n\\to\\infty$.\n", "  A configuration space method is developed for binding energy calculations of\nthe lowest energy exciton complexes (trion, biexciton) in spatially confined\nquasi-1D semiconductor nanostructures such as nanowires and nanotubes. Quite\ngenerally, trions are shown to have greater binding energy in strongly confined\nstructures with small reduced electron-hole masses. Biexcitons have greater\nbinding energy in less confined structures with large reduced electron-hole\nmasses. This results in a universal crossover behavior, whereby trions become\nless stable than biexcitons as the transverse size of the quasi-1D\nnanostructure increases. The method is also capable of evaluating binding\nenergies for electron-hole complexes in quasi-2D semiconductors such as coupled\nquantum wells and bilayer van der Walls bound heterostructures with advanced\noptoelectronic properties.\n", "  We show how a quantum computer can be employed to elucidate reaction\nmechanisms in complex chemical systems, using the open problem of biological\nnitrogen fixation in nitrogenase as an example. We discuss how quantum\ncomputers can augment classical-computer simulations for such problems, to\nsignificantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable\nsimulations. Detailed resource estimates show that, even when taking into\naccount the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to\ncompile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in\nreasonable time on small quantum computers. This demonstrates that quantum\ncomputers will realistically be able to tackle important problems in chemistry\nthat are both scientifically and economically significant.\n", "  We explore in a rigorous manner the intuitive connection between the\nnon-Markovianity of the evolution of an open quantum system and the performance\nof the system as a quantum memory. Using the paradigmatic case of a two-level\nopen quantum system coupled to a bosonic bath, we compute the recovery\nfidelity, which measures the best possible performance of the system to store a\nqubit of information. We deduce that this quantity is connected, but not\nuniquely determined, by the non-Markovianity, for which we adopt the BLP\nmeasure proposed in \\cite{breuer2009}. We illustrate our findings with explicit\ncalculations for the case of a structured environment.\n", "  Lattice Gauge theories have been studied in the physics literature as\ndiscrete approximations to quantum Yang-Mills theory for a long time. Primary\nstatistics of interest in these models are expectations of the so called\n\"Wilson loop variables\". In this article we continue the program initiated by\nChatterjee (2015) to understand Wilson loop expectations in Lattice Gauge\ntheories in a certain limit through gauge-string duality. The objective in this\npaper is to better understand the underlying combinatorics in the strong\ncoupling regime, by giving a more geometric picture of string trajectories\ninvolving correspondence to objects such as decorated trees and non-crossing\npartitions. Using connections with Free Probability theory, we provide an\nelaborate description of loop expectations in the planar setting, which\nprovides certain insights about structures of higher dimensional trajectories\nas well. Exploiting this, we construct an example showing that in any\ndimension, the Wilson loop area law lower bound does not hold in full\ngenerality.\n", "  A variety of numerical methods exist for the study of deformable particles in\ndense suspensions. None of the standard tools, however, currently include\nvolume-changing objects such as oscillating microbubbles in three-dimensional\nperiodic domains. In the first part of this work, we develop a novel method to\ninclude such entities based on the boundary integral method. We show that the\nwell-known boundary integral equation must be amended with two additional terms\ncontaining the volume flux through the bubble surface. We rigorously prove the\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution. Our proof contains as a subset the\nsimpler boundary integral equation without volume-changing objects (such as red\nblood cell or capsule suspensions) which is widely used but for which a formal\nproof in periodic domains has not been published to date.\n  In the second part, we apply our method to study microbubbles for targeted\ndrug delivery. The ideal drug delivery agent should stay away from the\nbiochemically active vessel walls during circulation. However, upon reaching\nits target it should attain a near-wall position for efficient drug uptake.\nThough seemingly contradictory, we show that lipid-coated microbubbles in\nconjunction with a localized ultrasound pulse possess precisely these two\nproperties. This ultrasound-triggered margination is due to hydrodynamic\ninteractions between the red blood cells and the oscillating lipid-coated\nmicrobubbles which alternate between a soft and a stiff state. We find that the\neffect is very robust, existing even if the duration in the stiff state is more\nthan three times lower than the opposing time in the soft state.\n", "  In recent years, the study of heat to work conversion has been re-invigorated\nby nanotechnology. Steady-state devices do this conversion without any\nmacroscopic moving parts, through steady-state flows of microscopic particles\nsuch as electrons, photons, phonons, etc. This review aims to introduce some of\nthe theories used to describe these steady-state flows in a variety of\nmesoscopic or nanoscale systems. These theories are introduced in the context\nof idealized machines which convert heat into electrical power (heat-engines)\nor convert electrical power into a heat flow (refrigerators). In this sense,\nthe machines could be categorized as thermoelectrics, although this should be\nunderstood to include photovoltaics when the heat source is the sun. As quantum\nmechanics is important for most such machines, they fall into the field of\nquantum thermodynamics. In many cases, the machines we consider have few\ndegrees of freedom, however the reservoirs of heat and work that they interact\nwith are assumed to be macroscopic. This review discusses different theories\nwhich can take into account different aspects of mesoscopic and nanoscale\nphysics, such as coherent quantum transport, magnetic-field induced effects\n(including topological ones such as the quantum Hall effect), and single\nelectron charging effects. It discusses the efficiency of thermoelectric\nconversion, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. More specifically, the\ntheories presented are (i) linear response theory with or without magnetic\nfields, (ii) Landauer scattering theory in the linear response regime and far\nfrom equilibrium, (iii) Green-Kubo formula for strongly interacting systems\nwithin the linear response regime, (iv) rate equation analysis for small\nquantum machines with or without .....

The Ring Imaging\nCherenkov (RICH) detectors are one of the key components for particle\nidentification of the LHCb detector and the upgraded specifications will\nrequire a redesign of the optoelectronic readout chain. In the present work, we\ndescribe the experimental setup and the results of the tests carried out with a\nparticle beam to assess and validate the performance of the optoelectronic\nreadout system.\n", "  We study the $(1+1)$-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) interfaces growing\ninward from ring-shaped initial conditions, experimentally and numerically,\nusing growth of a turbulent state in liquid-crystal electroconvection and an\noff-lattice Eden model, respectively. To realize the ring initial condition\nexperimentally, we introduce a holography-based technique that allows us to\ndesign the initial condition arbitrarily. Then, we find that fluctuation\nproperties of ingrowing circular interfaces are distinct from those for the\ncurved or circular KPZ subclass and, instead, are characterized by the flat\nsubclass. More precisely, we find an asymptotic approach to the Tracy-Widom\ndistribution for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and the $\\text{Airy}_1$\nspatial correlation, as long as time is much shorter than the characteristic\ntime determined by the initial curvature. Near this characteristic time,\ndeviation from the flat KPZ subclass is found, which can be explained in terms\nof the correlation length and the circumference. Our results indicate that the\nsign of the initial curvature has a crucial role in determining the universal\ndistribution and correlation functions of the KPZ class.\n", "  Using a popular vertex-based model to describe a spatially disordered planar\nepithelial monolayer, we examine the relationship between cell shape and\nmechanical stress at the cell and tissue level. Deriving expressions for stress\ntensors starting from an energetic formulation of the model, we show that the\nprincipal axes of stress for an individual cell align with the principal axes\nof shape, and we determine the bulk effective tissue pressure when the\nmonolayer is isotropic at the tissue level. Using simulations for a monolayer\nthat is not under peripheral stress, we fit parameters of the model to\nexperimental data for Xenopus embryonic tissue. The model predicts that\nmechanical interactions can generate mesoscopic patterns within the monolayer\nthat exhibit long-range correlations in cell shape. The model also suggests\nthat the orientation of mechanical and geometric cues for processes such as\ncell division are likely to be strongly correlated in real epithelia. Some\nlimitations of the model in capturing geometric features of Xenopus epithelial\ncells are highlighted.\n", "  We present a matrix-product state (MPS)-based quadratically convergent\ndensity-matrix renormalization group self-consistent-field (DMRG-SCF) approach.\nFollowing a proposal by Werner and Knowles (JCP 82, 5053, (1985)), our DMRG-SCF\nalgorithm is based on a direct minimization of an energy expression which is\ncorrect to second-order with respect to changes in the molecular orbital basis.\nWe exploit a simultaneous optimization of the MPS wave function and molecular\norbitals in order to achieve quadratic convergence. In contrast to previously\nreported (augmented Hessian) Newton-Raphson and super-configuration-interaction\nalgorithms for DMRG-SCF, energy convergence beyond a quadratic scaling is\npossible in our ansatz. Discarding the set of redundant active-active orbital\nrotations, the DMRG-SCF energy converges typically within two to four cycles of\nthe self-consistent procedure\n", "  In circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), an artificial \"circuit\natom\" can couple to a quantized microwave radiation much stronger than its real\natomic counterpart. The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest\ninteraction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the\ncoupling is large enough, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic circuit\natom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We explored\nthis situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper pair box)\ntype multi-level circuits tuned to their respective flux/charge degeneracy\npoints. We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive\nand which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key\nquantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state\nentangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when\nthe coupling is sufficiently large. Like in the quantum Rabi model, for very\nlarge couplings the entanglement spectrum is dominated by only two, nearly\nequal eigenvalues, in spite of the fact that a large number of bare atomic\nstates are actually involved in the atom-resonator ground state. We interpret\nthe emergence of the two-fold degeneracy of the vacuum of both circuits as an\nenvironmental suppression of flux/charge tunneling due to their dressing by\nvirtual low-/high-impedance photons in the resonator. For flux tunneling, the\ndressing is nothing else than the shunting of a Josephson atom with a large\ncapacitance of the resonator. Suppression of charge tunneling is a\nmanifestation of the dynamical Coulomb blockade of transport in tunnel\njunctions connected to resistive leads.\n", "  A symmetry-guided definition of time may enhance and simplify the analysis of\nhistorical series with recurrent patterns and seasonalities. By enforcing\nsimple-scaling and stationarity of the distributions of returns, we identify a\nsuccessful protocol of time definition in Finance. The essential structure of\nthe stochastic process underlying the series can thus be analyzed within a most\nparsimonious symmetry scheme in which multiscaling is reduced in the quest of a\ntime scale additive and independent of moment-order in the distribution of\nreturns. At the same time, duration of periods in which markets remain inactive\nare properly quantified by the novel clock, and the corresponding (e.g.,\novernight) returns are consistently taken into account for financial\napplications.\n", "  X-ray reflection spectroscopy can be a powerful tool to test the nature of\nastrophysical black holes. Extending previous work on Kerr black holes with\nscalar hair [1] and on boson stars [2], here we study whether astrophysical\nblack hole candidates may be horizonless, self-gravitating, vector\nBose-Einstein condensates, known as Proca stars [3]. We find that observations\nwith current X-ray missions can only provide weak constraints and rule out\nsolely Proca stars with low compactness. There are two reasons. First, at the\nmoment we do not know the geometry of the corona, and therefore the uncertainty\nin the emissivity profile limits the ability to constrain the background\nmetric. Second, the photon number count is low even in the case of a bright\nblack hole binary, and we cannot have a precise measurement of the spectrum.\n", "  By using the unfolding operators for periodic homogenization, we give a\ngeneral compactness result for a class of functions defined on bounded domains\npresenting perforations of two different size. Then we apply this result to the\nhomogenization of the flow of a Bingham fluid in a porous medium with solid\nobstacles of different size. Next we give the interpretation of the limit\nproblem in term of a non linear Darcy law.\n", "  Collective spins of large atomic samples trapped inside optical resonators\ncan carry quantum information that can be processed in a way similar to quantum\ncomputation with continuous variables. It is shown here that by combining the\nresonators in multi-path interferometers one can realize coupling between\ndifferent samples, and that polynomial Hamiltonians can be constructed by\nrepeated spin rotations and twisting induced by dispersive interaction of the\natoms with light. Application can be expected in efficient simulation of\nquantum systems.\n", "  We derive the Markov process equivalent to She-Leveque scaling in homogeneous\nand isotropic turbulence. The Markov process is a jump process for velocity\nincrements $u(r)$ in scale $r$ in which the jumps occur randomly but with\ndeterministic width in $u$. From its master equation we establish a\nprescription to simulate the She-Leveque process and compare it with Kolmogorov\nscaling. To put the She-Leveque process into the context of other established\nturbulence models on the Markov level, we derive a diffusion process for $u(r)$\nfrom two properties of the Navier-Stokes equation. This diffusion process\nalready includes Kolmogorov scaling, extended self-similarity and a class of\nrandom cascade models. The fluctuation theorem of this Markov process implies a\n\"second law\" that puts a loose bound on the multipliers of the random cascade\nmodels. This bound explicitly allows for inverse cascades, which are necessary\nto satisfy the fluctuation theorem. By adding a jump process to the diffusion\nprocess, we go beyond Kolmogorov scaling and formulate the most general scaling\nlaw for the class of Markov processes having both diffusion and jump parts.\nThis Markov scaling law includes She-Leveque scaling and a scaling law derived\nby Yakhot.\n", "  The predictions of parameteric property models and their uncertainties are\nsensitive to systematic errors such as inconsistent reference data, parametric\nmodel assumptions, or inadequate computational methods. Here, we discuss the\ncalibration of property models in the light of bootstrapping, a sampling method\nakin to Bayesian inference that can be employed for identifying systematic\nerrors and for reliable estimation of the prediction uncertainty. We apply\nbootstrapping to assess a linear property model linking the 57Fe Moessbauer\nisomer shift to the contact electron density at the iron nucleus for a diverse\nset of 44 molecular iron compounds. The contact electron density is calculated\nwith twelve density functionals across Jacob's ladder (PWLDA, BP86, BLYP, PW91,\nPBE, M06-L, TPSS, B3LYP, B3PW91, PBE0, M06, TPSSh). We provide systematic-error\ndiagnostics and reliable, locally resolved uncertainties for isomer-shift\npredictions. Pure and hybrid density functionals yield average prediction\nuncertainties of 0.06-0.08 mm/s and 0.04-0.05 mm/s, respectively, the latter\nbeing close to the average experimental uncertainty of 0.02 mm/s. Furthermore,\nwe show that both model parameters and prediction uncertainty depend\nsignificantly on the composition and number of reference data points.\nAccordingly, we suggest that rankings of density functionals based on\nperformance measures (e.g., the coefficient of correlation, r2, or the\nroot-mean-square error, RMSE) should not be inferred from a single data set.\nThis study presents the first statistically rigorous calibration analysis for\ntheoretical Moessbauer spectroscopy, which is of general applicability for\nphysico-chemical property models and not restricted to isomer-shift\npredictions. We provide the statistically meaningful reference data set MIS39\nand a new calibration of the isomer shift based on the PBE0 functional.\n", "  The ability of metallic nanoparticles to supply heat to a liquid environment\nunder exposure to an external optical field has attracted growing interest for\nbiomedical applications. Controlling the thermal transport properties at a\nsolid-liquid interface then appears to be particularly relevant. In this work,\nwe address the thermal transport between water and a gold surface coated by a\npolymer layer. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that\nincreasing the polymer density displaces the domain resisting to the heat flow,\nwhile it doesn't affect the final amount of thermal energy released in the\nliquid. This unexpected behavior results from a trade-off established by the\nincreasing polymer density which couples more efficiently with the solid but\ninitiates a counterbalancing resistance with the liquid.\n", "  Finding influential spreaders of information and disease in networks is an\nimportant theoretical problem, and one of considerable recent interest. It has\nbeen almost exclusively formulated as a node-ranking problem -- methods for\nidentifying influential spreaders rank nodes according to how influential they\nare. In this work, we show that the ranking approach does not necessarily work:\nthe set of most influential nodes depends on the number of nodes in the set.\nTherefore, the set of $n$ most important nodes to vaccinate does not need to\nhave any node in common with the set of $n+1$ most important nodes. We propose\na method for quantifying the extent and impact of this phenomenon, and show\nthat it is common in both empirical and model networks.\n", "  The onset or demise of Kondo effect in a magnetic impurity on a metal surface\ncan be triggered, as often observed, by the simple mechanical nudging of a tip.\nThis mechanically-driven quantum phase transition must reflect in a\ncorresponding mechanical dissipation peak; yet, this kind of effect has not\nbeen focused upon so far. Aiming at the simplest theoretical modeling, we\ninitially treat the impurity as a non-interacting resonant level turned\ncyclically on and off, and obtain a dissipation per cycle which is proportional\nto the hybridization $\\Gamma$, with a characteristic temperature dependent\nresonant peak value. A better treatment is obtained next by solving an Anderson\nimpurity model by numerical renormalization group. Here, many body effects\nyield a dissipation whose peak value is now proportional to $T_K |\\log T|$ so\nlong as $T\\sim T_K$, followed for $T\\sim \\Gamma$ by a second high temperature\nregime where dissipation is proportional to $\\Gamma|\\log T|$. The detectability\nof Kondo mechanical dissipation in atomic force microscopy is discussed.\n", "  A nonautonomous version of the ultradiscrete hungry Toda lattice with a\nfinite lattice boundary condition is derived by applying reduction and\nultradiscretization to a nonautonomous two-dimensional discrete Toda lattice.\nIt is shown that the derived ultradiscrete system has a direct connection to\nthe box-ball system with many kinds of balls and finite carrier capacity.\nParticular solutions to the ultradiscrete system are constructed by using the\ntheory of some sort of discrete biorthogonal polynomials.\n", "  Bloch oscillations in nanoscale Josephson junctions with a Coulomb charging\nenergy comparable to the Josephson coupling energy are explored within the\ncontext of a model previously considered by Geigenm\\\"uller and Sch\\\"on that\nincludes Zener tunneling and treats quasiparticle tunneling as an explicit\nshot-noise process. The dynamics of the junction quasicharge are investigated\nnumerically using both Monte Carlo and ensemble approaches to calculate\nvoltage--current characteristics in the presence of microwaves. We examine in\ndetail the origin of harmonic and subharmonic Bloch steps at dc biases\n$I=(n/m)2ef$ induced by microwaves of frequency $f$ and consider the optimum\nparameters for the observation of harmonic ($m=1$) steps. We also demonstrate\nthat the GS model allows a detailed semi-quantitative fit to experimental\nvoltage--current characteristics previously obtained at the Chalmers University\nof Technology, confirming and strengthening the interpretation of the observed\nmicrowave-induced steps in terms of Bloch oscillations.\n", "  The maximum allowable size of a spherical cosmic structure as a function of\nits mass is determined by the maximum turn around radius $R_{\\rm TA,max}$, the\ndistance from its centre where the attraction on a radial test particle due to\nthe spherical mass is balanced with the repulsion due to the ambient dark\nenergy. In this work, we extend the existing results in several directions. (a)\nWe first show that for $w\\neq -1$, the expression for $R_{\\rm TA, max}$ found\nearlier using the cosmological perturbation theory, can be derived using a\nstatic geometry as well. (b) In the generic dark energy model with arbitrary\ntime dependent state parameter $w(t)$, taking into account the effect of\ninhomogeneities upon the dark energy as well, where it is shown that the data\nconstrain $w(t={\\rm today})>-2.3$, and (c) in the quintessence and the\ngeneralized Chaplygin gas models, both of which are shown to predict structure\nsizes consistent with observations.\n", "  Variational approaches for the calculation of vibrational wave functions and\nenergies are a natural route to obtain highly accurate results with\ncontrollable errors. However, the unfavorable scaling and the resulting high\ncomputational cost of standard variational approaches limit their application\nto small molecules with only few vibrational modes. Here, we demonstrate how\nthe density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) can be exploited to optimize\nvibrational wave functions (vDMRG) expressed as matrix product states. We study\nthe convergence of these calculations with respect to the size of the local\nbasis of each mode, the number of renormalized block states, and the number of\nDMRG sweeps required. We demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by vDMRG for\nsmall molecules that were intensively studied in the literature. We then\nproceed to show that the complete fingerprint region of the sarcosyn-glycin\ndipeptide can be calculated with vDMRG.\n", "  We calculate the level compressibility $\\chi(W,L)$ of the energy levels\ninside $[-L/2,L/2]$ for the Anderson model on infinitely large random regular\ngraphs with on-site potentials distributed uniformly in $[-W/2,W/2]$. We show\nthat $\\chi(W,L)$ approaches the limit $\\lim_{L \\rightarrow 0^+} \\chi(W,L) = 0$\nfor a broad interval of the disorder strength $W$ within the extended phase,\nincluding the region of $W$ close to the critical point for the Anderson\ntransition. These results strongly suggest that the energy levels follow the\nWigner-Dyson statistics in the extended phase, consistent with earlier\nanalytical predictions for the Anderson model on an Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi random\ngraph. Our results are obtained from the accurate numerical solution of an\nexact set of equations valid for infinitely large regular random graphs.\n", "  We present a new upper limit on CMB circular polarization from the 2015\nflight of SPIDER, a balloon-borne telescope designed to search for $B$-mode\nlinear polarization from cosmic inflation. Although the level of circular\npolarization in the CMB is predicted to be very small, experimental limits\nprovide a valuable test of the underlying models. By exploiting the non-zero\ncircular-to-linear polarization coupling of the HWP polarization modulators,\ndata from SPIDER's 2015 Antarctic flight provide a constraint on Stokes $V$ at\n95 and 150 GHz from $33<\\ell<307$. No other limits exist over this full range\nof angular scales, and SPIDER improves upon the previous limit by several\norders of magnitude, providing 95% C.L. constraints on $\\ell\n(\\ell+1)C_{\\ell}^{VV}/(2\\pi)$ ranging from 141 $\\mu K ^2$ to 255 $\\mu K ^2$ at\n150 GHz for a thermal CMB spectrum. As linear CMB polarization experiments\nbecome increasingly sensitive, the techniques described in this paper can be\napplied to obtain even stronger constraints on circular polarization.\n", "  The existence of gapless boundary states is a key attribute of any\ntopological insulator. Topological band theory predicts that these states are\nrobust against static perturbations that preserve the relevant symmetries. In\nthis article, using Floquet theory, we examine how chiral symmetry-protection\nextends also to states subject to time-periodic perturbations $-$ in\none-dimensional Floquet topological insulators as well as in ordinary\none-dimensional time-independent topological insulators. It is found that, in\nthe case of the latter, the edge modes are resistant to a much larger class of\ntime-periodic symmetry-preserving perturbations than in Floquet topological\ninsulators. Notably, boundary states in chiral time-independent topological\ninsulators also exhibit an unexpected resilience against a certain type of\nsymmetry-breaking time-periodic perturbations. We argue that this is a generic\nproperty for topological phases protected by chiral symmetry. Implications for\nexperiments are discussed.\n", "  We find that a fuzzy dark matter background and the mG scale magnetic field\nin the galactic center can give rise to a radiation with a very large energy\nrelease. The frequency of the radiation field is the same as the frequency of\nthe oscillating axion-like background field. We show that there is an energy\ntransfer between the fuzzy dark matter sector and the electromagnetic sector\nbecause of the presence of the generated radiation field and the galactic\nmagnetic field. The energy release rate of radiation is found to be very slow\nin comparison with the energy of fuzzy dark matter but could be significant\ncomparing with the energy of galactic magnetic field in the source region.\nUsing this example, we show that the fuzzy dark matter together with a large\nscale magnetic field is possible to give rise to fruitful physics.\n", "  A simple relation of the order of $n$ abstract objects generates an $n-2$\ndimensional basis of three dimensional vectors. A cellular automaton-like model\nof evolution of this system is postulated. During this evolution, some\nquantities stabilize with time and form a discrete spectrum of values. The\npresented model may have some general aspects in common with a cellular\nautomaton representation of a quantum system.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the Bogoliubov wave packet in superconductors and\ncalculate the supercurrent carried by the wave packet. We discover an anomalous\ncontribution to the supercurrent, related to the quantum metric of the Bloch\nwave function. This anomalous contribution is most important for flat or\nquasiflat bands, as exemplified by the attractive Hubbard models on the Creutz\nladder and sawtooth lattice. Our theoretical framework is general and can be\nused to study a wide variety of phenomena, such as spin transport and exciton\ntransport.\n", "  We address measurement-based generation of quantum coherence in continuous\nvariable systems. We consider Gaussian measurements performed on Gaussian\nstates and focus on two scenarios. In the first one, we assume an initially\ncorrelated bipartite state shared by two parties and study how correlations may\nbe exploited to remotely create quantum coherence via measurement back-action.\nIn particular, we focus on conditional states with zero first moments, so as to\naddress coherence due to properties of the covariance matrix. We consider\ndifferent classes of bipartite states with incoherent marginals and show that\nthe larger the measurement squeezing, the larger the conditional coherence.\nHomodyne detection is thus the optimal Gaussian measurement to remotely\ngenerate coherence. We also show that for squeezed thermal states there exists\na threshold value for the generated coherence which separates entangled and\nseparable states at a fixed energy. Finally, we briefly discuss the tripartite\ncase and the relationship between tripartite correlations and the conditional\ntwo-mode coherence. In the second scenario, we address the steady state\ncoherence of a system interacting with an environment which is continuously\nmonitored. In particular, we discuss the dynamics of an optical parametric\noscillator in order to investigate how the coherence of a Gaussian state may be\nincreased by means of time-continuous Gaussian measurement on the interacting\nenvironment.\n", "  The Rashba effect, a spin splitting in electronic band structure, attracts\nmuch attention for the potential applications in spintronics with no\nrequirement of external magnetic field. Realizing one-dimensional (1D) Rashba\nsystem is a big challenge due to the difficulties of growing high-quality\nheavy-metal nanowires or introducing strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and\nbroken inversion symmetry in flexible materials. Here, based on\nfirst-principles calculations, we propose a pathway to realize the Rashba\nspin-split by adsorbing Gd atom on zigzag graphene nanoribbons (Gd-ZGNR) and\nfurther investigate the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Perpendicular MAE and\nunconventional MAE contributions in k-space are found in the self-assembled\nGd-ZGNR system, which present a remarkable Rashba effect (the estimated\nstrength is 1.89 eV {\\AA}) attributed to strong SOC (~65.6 meV) and the\nasymmetric adsorption site at the nanoribbons edge. Moreover, first-order MAE\nis connected to the intrinsic Rashba effect beyond the traditional second-order\nMAE, which is confirmed based on the analysis of electronic structures\nperturbed with SOC in comparison with metastable Gd-ZGNR at central symmetric\nadsorption site. The dependence of first-order MAE as well as Rashba effect of\nGd-ZGNRs on the ribbon width are also examined. This work offers new\nperspective to achieve 1D Rashba system and provides fundamental understanding\non the magnetic anisotropy, which would be of great significance for searching\nMajorana fermions and promoting the potential applications in spintronics.\n", "  We present a thorough analysis of the interplay of magnetic moment and the\nJahn-Teller effect in the $\\Gamma_8$ cubic multiplet. We find that in the\npresence of dynamical Jahn-Teller effect, the Zeeman interaction remains\nisotropic, whereas the $g$ and $G$ factors can change their signs. The static\nJahn-Teller distortion also can change the sign of these $g$ factors as well as\nthe nature of the magnetic anisotropy. Combining the theory with\nstate-of-the-art {\\it ab initio} calculations, we analyzed the magnetic\nproperties of Np$^{4+}$ and Ir$^{4+}$ impurity ions in cubic environment. The\ncalculated $g$ factors of Np$^{4+}$ impurity agree well with experimental data.\nThe {\\it ab initio} calculation predicts strong Jahn-Teller effect in Ir$^{4+}$\nion in cubic environment and the strong vibronic reduction of $g$ and $G$\nfactors.\n", "  Cells alter the path of light, a fact that leads to well-known aberrations in\nsingle cell or tissue imaging. Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) measures\nthe biophysical property that causes these aberrations, the refractive index\n(RI). ODT is complementary to fluorescence imaging and does not require any\nmarkers. The present study introduces RI and fluorescence tomography with\noptofluidic rotation (RAFTOR) of suspended cells, quantifying the intracellular\nRI distribution and colocalizing it with fluorescence in 3D. The technique is\nvalidated with cell phantoms and used to confirm a lower nuclear RI for HL60\ncells. Furthermore, the nuclear inversion of adult mouse photoreceptor cells is\nobserved in the RI distribution. The applications shown confirm predictions of\nprevious studies and illustrate the potential of RAFTOR to improve our\nunderstanding of cells and tissues.\n", "  Finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory using Skyrme interactions\nand Relativistic Hartree-Fock effective Lagrangians, predicts $^{48}$Ni as\nbeing a possible candidate for the finite temperature pairing re-entrance\nphenomenon. For this proton-drip-line nucleus, proton resonant states are\nexpected to contribute substantially to pairing correlations and the two\npredicted critical temperatures are $T_{c1}\\sim 0.08-0.2$~MeV and $T_{c2}\\sim\n0.7-0.9$~MeV. It is also shown that pairing re-entrance modifies the proton\nsingle particle energies around the Fermi level, as well as occupation numbers,\nand quasi-particle levels. The understanding of pairing re-entrance in\n$^{48}$Ni presently challenge our understanding of exotic matter under extreme\nconditions.\n", "  Searches are presented for heavy gauge bosons decaying into a top and a\nbottom quark in data collected by the CMS experiment at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV that\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 and 2.6 inverse femtobarns in the\nleptonic and hadronic analyses, respectively. Two final states are analyzed,\none containing a single electron, or muon, and missing transverse momentum, and\nthe other containing multiple jets and no electrons or muons. No evidence is\nfound for a right-handed W' boson (W'[R]) and the combined analyses exclude at\n95% confidence level W'[R] with masses below 2.4 TeV if M[W'[R]] >> M[nu[R]]\n(mass of the right-handed neutrino), and below 2.6 TeV if M[W'[R]] < M[nu[R]].\nThe results provide the most stringent limits for right-handed W' bosons in the\ntop and bottom quark decay channel.\n", "  Coupled cluster theory is the method of choice for weakly correlated systems.\nBut in the strongly correlated regime, it faces a symmetry dilemma, where it\neither completely fails to describe the system, or has to artificially break\ncertain symmetries. On the other hand, projected Hartree-Fock theory captures\nthe essential physics of many kinds of strong correlations via symmetry\nbreaking and restoration. In this work, we combine and try to retain the merits\nof these two methods by applying symmetry projection to broken symmetry coupled\ncluster wavefunctions. The non-orthogonal nature of states resulting from the\napplication of symmetry projection operators furnishes particle-hole\nexcitations to all orders, thus creating an obstacle for the exact evaluation\nof overlaps. Here we provide a solution via a disentanglement framework theory\nthat can be approximated rigorously and systematically. Results of projected\ncoupled cluster theory are presented for molecules and the Hubbard model,\nshowing that spin projection significantly improves unrestricted coupled\ncluster theory while restoring good quantum numbers. The energy of projected\ncoupled cluster theory reduces to the unprojected one in the thermodynamic\nlimit, albeit at a much slower rate than projected Hartree-Fock.\n", "  Superconductivity often emerges in proximity of other symmetry-breaking\nground states, such as antiferromagnetism or charge-density-wave (CDW) order.\nHowever, the subtle inter-relation of these phases remains poorly understood,\nand in some cases even the existence of short-range correlations for\nsuperconducting compositions is uncertain. In such circumstances, ultrafast\nexperiments can provide new insights, by tracking the relaxation kinetics\nfollowing excitation at frequencies related to the broken symmetry state. Here,\nwe investigate the transient terahertz conductivity of BaPb1-xBixO3 - a\nmaterial for which superconductivity is adjacent to a competing CDW phase -\nafter optical excitation tuned to the CDW absorption band. In insulating BaBiO3\nwe observed an increase in conductivity and a subsequent relaxation, which are\nconsistent with quasiparticles injection across a rigid semiconducting gap. In\nthe doped compound BaPb0.72Bi0.28O3 (superconducting below Tc=7K), a similar\nresponse was also found immediately above Tc. This observation evidences the\npresence of a robust gap up to T=40 K, which is presumably associated with\nshort-range CDW correlations. A qualitatively different behaviour was observed\nin the same material fo T>40 K. Here, the photo-conductivity was dominated by\nan enhancement in carrier mobility at constant density, suggestive of melting\nof the CDW correlations rather than excitation across an optical gap. The\nrelaxation displayed a temperature dependent, Arrhenius-like kinetics,\nsuggestive of the crossing of a free-energy barrier between two phases. These\nresults support the existence of short-range CDW correlations above Tc in\nunderdoped BaPb1-xBixO3, and provide new information on the dynamical interplay\nbetween superconductivity and charge order.\n", "  The organic charge-transfer salt $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Hg(SCN)$_{2}$Br is\na quasi two-dimensional metal with a half-filled conduction band at ambient\nconditions. When cooled below $T=80$ K it undergoes a pronounced transition to\nan insulating phase where the resistivity increases many orders of magnitude.\nIn order to elucidate the nature of this metal-insulator transition we have\nperformed comprehensive transport, dielectric and optical investigations. The\nfindings are compared with other dimerized $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF) salts, in\nparticular the Cl-analogue, where a charge-order transition takes place at\n$T_{\\rm CO}=30$ K.\n", "  We provide an elegant way of solving analytically the third post-Newtonian\n(3PN) accurate Kepler equation, associated with the 3PN-accurate generalized\nquasi-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries in eccentric orbits. An\nadditional analytic solution is presented to check the correctness of our\ncompact solution and we perform comparisons between our PN-accurate analytic\nsolution and a very accurate numerical solution of the PN-accurate Kepler\nequation. We adapt our approach to compute crucial 3PN-accurate inputs that\nwill be required to compute analytically both the time and frequency domain\nready-to-use amplitude-corrected PN-accurate search templates for compact\nbinaries in inspiralling eccentric orbits.\n", "  We present a study of the three-dimensional structure of the molecular clouds\nin the Galactic Centre (GC) using CO emission and OH absorption lines. Two CO\nisotopologue lines, $^{12}$CO ($J$=1$\\rightarrow$0) and $^{13}$CO\n($J$=1$\\rightarrow$0), and four OH ground-state transitions, surveyed by the\nSouthern Parkes Large-Area Survey in Hydroxyl (SPLASH), contribute to this\nstudy. We develop a novel method to calculate the OH column density, excitation\ntemperature, and optical depth precisely using all four OH lines, and we employ\nit to derive a three-dimensional model for the distribution of molecular clouds\nin the GC for six slices in Galactic latitude. The angular resolution of the\ndata is 15.5 arcmin, which at the distance of the GC (8.34 kpc) is equivalent\nto 38 pc. We find that the total mass of OH in the GC is in the range 2400-5100\nSolar mass . The face-on view at a Galactic latitude of b = 0{\\deg} displays a\nbar-like structure with an inclination angle of 67.5 $\\pm$ 2.1{\\deg} with\nrespect to the line of sight. No ring-like structure in the GC is evident in\nour data, likely due to the low spatial resolution of the CO and OH maps.\n", "  The combination of superconductivity and the helical spin-momentum locking at\nthe surface state of a topological insulator (TI) has been predicted to give\nrise to p-wave superconductivity and Majorana bound states. The\nsuperconductivity can be induced by the proximity effect of a an s-wave\nsuperconductor (S) into the TI. To probe the superconducting correlations\ninside the TI, dI/dV spectroscopy has been performed across such S-TI\ninterfaces. Both the alloyed Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.7}$Se$_{1.3}$ and the\nstoichiometric BiSbTeSe$_2$ have been used as three dimensional TI. In the case\nof Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.7}$Se$_{1.3}$, the presence of disorder induced\nelectron-electron interactions can give rise to an additional zero-bias\nresistance peak. For the stoichiometric BiSbTeSe$_2$ with less disorder, tunnel\nbarriers were employed in order to enhance the signal from the interface. The\ngeneral observations in the spectra of a large variety of samples are\nconductance dips at the induced gap voltage, combined with an increased sub-gap\nconductance, consistent with p-wave predictions. The induced gap voltage is\ntypically smaller than the gap of the Nb superconducting electrode, especially\nin the presence of an intentional tunnel barrier. Additional uncovered\nspectroscopic features are oscillations that are linearly spaced in energy, as\nwell as a possible second order parameter component.\n", "  The Telescope Array (TA) experiment is located in the western desert of Utah,\nUSA, and observes ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in the Northern\nhemisphere. At the highest energies, $E>10$~EeV, the shape of cosmic ray energy\nspectrum may carry an imprint of the source density distribution along the line\nof sight different in different directions of the sky. In this study, we search\nfor such directional variations in the shape of the energy spectrum using\nevents observed with the Telescope Array's surface detector. We divide the TA\nfield of view into two nearly equal-exposure regions: the \"on-source\" region\nwhich we define as $\\pm 30^\\circ$ of the supergalactic plane containing mostly\nnearby structures, and the complementary \"off-source\" region where the sources\nare further away on average. We compare the UHECR spectra in these regions by\nfitting them to the broken power law and comparing the resulting parameters. We\nfind that the off-source spectrum has an earlier break at highest energies. The\nchance probability to obtain such or larger difference in statistically\nequivalent distributions is estimated as $6.2\\pm1.1\\times10^{-4}$ ($3.2\\sigma$)\nby a Monte-Carlo simulation. The observed difference in spectra is in a\nreasonable quantitative agreement with a simplified model that assumes that the\nUHECR sources trace the galaxy distribution from the 2MRS catalogue, primary\nparticles are protons and the magnetic deflections can be neglected.\n", "  We present the first study of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity and\nstellar-mass functions (GLF and GSMF) carried out by the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES). We describe the COMMODORE galaxy catalogue selected from Science\nVerification images. This catalogue is made of $\\sim 4\\times 10^{6}$ galaxies\nat $0<z\\lesssim1.3$ over a sky area of $\\sim155\\ {\\rm sq. \\ deg}$ with ${\\it\ni}$-band limiting magnitude ${\\it i}=23\\ {\\rm mag}$. Such characteristics are\nunprecedented for galaxy catalogues and they enable us to study the evolution\nof GLF and GSMF at $0<z<1$ homogeneously with the same statistically-rich\ndata-set and free of cosmic variance effects. The aim of this study is twofold:\ni) we want to test our method based on the use of photometric-redshift\nprobability density functions against literature results obtained with\nspectroscopic redshifts; ii) we want to shed light on the way galaxies build up\ntheir masses over cosmic time. We find that both the ${\\it i}$-band galaxy\nluminosity and stellar mass functions are characterised by a double-Schechter\nshape at $z<0.2$. Both functions agree well with those based on spectroscopic\nredshifts. The DES GSMF agrees especially with those measured for the GAlaxy\nMass Assembly and the PRism MUlti-object Survey out to $z\\sim1$. At $0.2<z<1$,\nwe find the ${\\it i}$-band luminosity and stellar-mass densities respectively\nto be constant ($\\rho_{\\rm L}\\propto (1+z)^{-0.12\\pm0.11}$) and decreasing\n($\\rho_{\\rm Mstar}\\propto (1+z)^{-0.5\\pm0.1}$) with $z$. This indicates that,\nwhile at higher redshift galaxies have less stellar mass, their luminosities do\nnot change substantially because of their younger and brighter stellar\npopulations. Finally, we also find evidence for a top-down mass-dependent\nevolution of the GSMF.\n", "  We present a review of the measurements of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of light\nnuclei ($d$,$\\bar{d}$, $t$, $^{3}\\rm He$, and $^{3}\\overline{\\rm He}$) from the\nRHIC and LHC experiments. Light (anti)nuclei $v_{2}$ have been compared with\nthat of (anti)proton. We observed a similar trend in light nuclei $v_{2}$ to\nthat in identified hadron $v_{2}$ with respect to the general observations such\nas ($p_{\\rm T}$) dependence, low $p_{\\rm T}$ mass ordering, and centrality\ndependence. We also compared the difference of nuclei and antinuclei $v_{2}$\nwith the corresponding difference of $v_{2}$ of proton and antiproton at\nvarious collision energies. Qualitatively they depict similar behavior. We also\ncompare the data on light nuclei $v_{2}$ to various theoretical models such as\nblast-wave and coalescence. We then present a prediction of $v_{2}$ for\n$^{3}\\rm He$ and $^{4}\\rm He$ using coalescence and blast-wave models.\n", "  We present a community study exploring the low frequency (5 - 800 MHz)\noptions and opportunities for the ngVLA project and its infrastructure. We\ndescribe a Next Generation LOw Band Observatory (ngLOBO) that will provide\naccess to the low frequency sky in a commensal fashion, operating independently\nfrom the ngVLA, but leveraging common infrastructure. This approach provides\ncontinuous coverage through an aperture array (called ngLOBO-Low) below 150 MHz\nand by accessing the primary focus of the ngVLA antennas (called ngLOBO-High)\nabove 150 MHz. ngLOBO preconditions include a) non-interference and b) low\nrelative cost (<5%) with respect to ngVLA.\n  ngLOBO has three primary scientific missions: (1) Radio Large Synoptic Survey\nTelescope (Radio-LSST): one naturally wide beam, commensal with ngVLA, will\nconduct a continuous synoptic survey of large swaths of the sky for both slow\nand fast transients; (2) This same commensal beam will provide complementary\nlow frequency images of all ngVLA targets and their environment {\\it when such\ndata enhances their value}. (3) Independent beams from the ngLOBO-Low aperture\narray will conduct research in astrophysics, Earth science and space weather\napplications, engaging new communities and attracting independent resources. If\nngVLA operates down to 2 GHz or lower, ngLOBO data will enhance ngVLA\ncalibration and dynamic scheduling. Finally, non-variable field sources outside\nthe ngVLA field of view can be harvested for serendipitous science, e.g.\npopulation studies for thermal and non-thermal continuum sources.\n  The ngVLA will be a superb, high frequency instrument; ngLOBO will allow it\nto participate in the worldwide renaissance in low frequency science as well.\n", "  We investigate the effect of far-off-resonant trapping light on ultracold\nbosonic RbCs molecules. We use kHz-precision microwave spectroscopy to measure\nthe differential AC Stark shifts between the ground and first excited\nrotational levels of the molecule with hyperfine-state resolution. We\ndemonstrate through both experiment and theory that coupling between\nneighboring hyperfine states manifests in rich structure with many avoided\ncrossings. This coupling may be tuned by rotating the polarization of the\nlinearly polarized trapping light. A combination of spectroscopic and\nparametric heating measurements allows complete characterization of the\nmolecular polarizability at a wavelength of 1550~nm in both the ground and\nfirst excited rotational states.\n", "  We report the first computational super-resolved, multi-camera integral\nimaging at long-wave infrared (LWIR) wavelengths. A synchronized array of FLIR\nLepton cameras was assembled, and computational super-resolution and\nintegral-imaging reconstruction employed to generate video with light-field\nimaging capabilities, such as 3D imaging and recognition of partially obscured\nobjects, while also providing a four-fold increase in effective pixel count.\nThis approach to high-resolution imaging enables a fundamental reduction in the\ntrack length and volume of an imaging system, while also enabling use of\nlow-cost lens materials.\n", "  The motion of electrons and nuclei in photochemical events often involve\nconical intersections, degeneracies between electronic states. They serve as\nfunnels for nuclear relaxation - on the femtosecond scale - in processes where\nthe electrons and nuclei couple nonadiabatically. Accurate ab initio quantum\nchemical models are essential for interpreting experimental measurements of\nsuch phenomena. In this paper we resolve a long-standing problem in coupled\ncluster theory, presenting the first formulation of the theory that correctly\ndescribes conical intersections between excited electronic states of the same\nsymmetry. This new development demonstrates that the highly accurate coupled\ncluster theory can be applied to describe dynamics on excited electronic states\ninvolving conical intersections.\n", "  Room-temperature (RT) Pulsed Cathodoluminescence (PCL) spectra of a set of\npure synthetic (both crystalline and amorphous) silicon dioxide materials were\nstudied. It is shown, that the PCL spectra of all samples (both amorphous and\ncrystalline) possess a separate band at 495 nm (2.5 eV). This band is the most\nintensive one in PCL spectra of disordered materials. The RT PCL band at 495 nm\n(2.5 eV) of {\\alpha}-quartz single crystal is polarized in XY crystalline plane\n(perpendicular to the $3^{rd}$ order symmetry axis). The structure of this band\nwas detected. It consists of three peaks: at 480$\\pm$2 nm (2.58$\\pm$0.01 eV),\n487$\\pm$ nm (2.55$\\pm$0.01 eV) and 493$\\pm$2 nm (2.52$\\pm$0.01 eV). Energy\nseparation between peaks is equal in order of magnitude to energies of\n$Li_{x}O_{y}$ molecular vibrations and to the energy of optical phonon in\n{\\alpha}-quartz. It is shown, that the emission band at 495 nm (2.5 eV) in RT\nPCL spectra of {\\alpha}-quartz single crystal is related to the bulk emission\ncenters, not to the surface-related ones. The annealing behaviors of the 495 nm\n(2.5 eV) bands in spectrum of amorphous and crystalline $SiO_{2}$ are close to\neach other. This fact may be the manifestation of identical origin of these\nbands. The following explanation of experimental data is proposed: the origin\nof 495 nm (2.5 eV) band in pure silicon dioxide is related to the recombination\nof non-bridging oxygen $NBO^{-}-Li^{+}$ centers.\n", "  The analytical solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation with the Yukawa\npotential is presented within the framework of an approximation to the\ncentrifugal potential for any arbitrary state with the position-dependent mass\nusing the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The energy eigenvalues and the\ncorresponding wave function have been obtained. The energy for both the scalar\npotential and vector potential as well as the effect of the screening parameter\non each of the energy for scalar potential and vector potential are\ninvestigated in detail. The nonrelativistic limit is obtained and numerical\nresults are computed. It is found that our results for the constant mass and\nthat of the nonrelativistic limit are in good agreement with the one in the\nliterature.\n", "  Rubenstein et al. present an interesting system of programmable\nself-assembled structure formation using 1000 Kilobot robots. The paper claims\nto advance work in artificial swarms similar to capabilities of natural systems\nbesides being highly robust. However, the system lacks in terms of matching\nmotility and complex shapes with holes, thereby limiting practical similarity\nto self-assembly in living systems.\n", "  Perfect, broadband and asymmetric sound absorption is theoretically,\nnumerically and experimentally reported by using subwavelength thickness panels\nin a transmission problem. The panels are composed of a periodic array of\nvarying cross-section waveguides, each of them being loaded by an array of\nHelmholtz resonators (HRs) with graded dimensions. The low cut-off frequency of\nthe absorption band is fixed by the resonance frequency of the deepest HR, that\nreduces drastically the transmission. The preceding HR is designed with a\nslightly higher resonance frequency with a geometry that allows the impedance\nmatching to the surrounding medium. Therefore, reflection vanishes and the\nstructure is critically coupled. This results in perfect sound absorption at a\nsingle frequency. We report perfect absorption at 300 Hz for a structure whose\nthickness is 40 times smaller than the wavelength. Moreover, this process is\nrepeated by adding HRs to the waveguide, each of them with a higher resonance\nfrequency than the preceding one. Using this frequency cascade effect, we\nreport quasi-perfect sound absorption over almost two frequency octaves ranging\nfrom 300 to 1000 Hz for a panel composed of 9 resonators with a total thickness\nof 11 cm, i.e., 10 times smaller than the wavelength at 300 Hz.\n", "  Mechanical vibrations of components of the optical system is one of the\nsources of blurring of interference pattern in coherent imaging systems. The\nproblem is especially important in holography where the resolution of the\nreconstructed objects depends on the effective size of the hologram, that is on\nthe extent of the interference pattern, and on the contrast of the interference\nfringes. We discuss the mathematical relation between the vibrations, the\nhologram contrast and the reconstructed object. We show how vibrations can be\npost-filtered out from the hologram or from the reconstructed object assuming a\nGaussian distribution of the vibrations. We also provide a numerical example of\ncompensation for directional motion blur. We demonstrate our approach for light\noptical and electron holograms, acquired with both, plane- as well as\nspherical-waves. As a result of such hologram deblurring, the resolution of the\nreconstructed objects is enhanced by almost a factor of 2. We believe that our\napproach opens up a new venue of post-experimental resolution enhancement in\nin-line holography by adapting the rich database/catalogue of motion deblurring\nalgorithms developed for photography and image restoration applications.\n", "  While considering nonlinear coherent states with specific anti-holomorphic\ncoefficients $\\bar{z}^n/\\sqrt{x_n!}$, we identify as first associated\nMeixner-Pollaczek polynomials the orthogonal polynomials arising from shift\noperators which are defined by the sequence $x_n=(n+1)^2$ . We give a formula\ndefining these polynomials by writing down their generating function. This also\nleads to construct a Bargmann-type integral transform whose kernel is given in\nterms of a $\\Psi_1$ Humbert's function.\n", "  The quantum motion of nuclei, generally ignored in sliding friction, can\nbecome important for an atom, ion, or light molecule sliding in an optical\nlattice. The density-matrix-calculated evolution of a quantum Prandtl-Tomlinson\nmodel, describing the frictional dragging by an external force of a quantum\nparticle, shows that classical predictions can be very wrong. The strongest\nquantum effect occurs not for weak, but for strong periodic potentials, where\nbarriers are high but energy levels in each well are discrete, and resonant\ntunnelling to excited states in the nearest well can preempt classical\nstick-slip with great efficiency. The resulting permeation of otherwise\nimpassable barriers is predicted to cause quantum lubricity\n", "  Molecular fragment or embedding methods are powerful techniques for\novercoming scalability limitations in electronic structure theory by dividing\nlarge molecular systems into individual units that are small enough to be\ntreated using standard techniques. Our group has developed a linear-scaling\ncoupled-cluster based fragment effective field method, molecular cluster\nperturbation theory (MCPT), that provides a systematically improvable\ndescription of the electronic wavefunction and is scalable to thousands of\natoms using the Aces4 massively parallel software package. We will present a\nsystematic computational benchmarking study of small organic molecule solvation\nfree energies obtained from MCPT using various perturbation corrections using\nexperimental and large-scale ab initio reference values. We will also present\nrecent work on the relative crystal lattice polymorph energies of several\nmolecular crystals where the roles of many-body dispersion and intermol ecular\nelectron exchange will be investigated. The molecular solvent and crystal\nsystems presented here are carefully chosen so as to provide a robust test set\nfor the fragment electronic structure community.\n", "  One of many challenges for niobium (Nb) based superconducting devices is the\nimprovement over the surface morphology and superconducting properties as well\nas the reduction of defects. We employed a novel deposition technique, i.e.\nbiased target ion beam deposition technique (BTIBD) to prepare Nb thin films\nwith controlled crystallinity and surface morphology. We found that the target\ncurrent (ITarget) and the target bias (VTarget) were critical to the\ncrystallinity and surface morphology of Nb films. The high target current\n(ITarget >500 mA and VTarget = 400 V bias) during the deposition degraded the\nNb crystallinity, and subsequently reduced the critical temperature for\nsuperconductivity (Tc). VTarget was critical to the surface morphology, i.e.\ngrain size and shape and the surface roughness. The optimized growth condition\nyielded very smooth film with RMS roughness of 0.4 nm that was an order of\nmagnitude smoother than that of Nb films by sputtering process. The critical\ntemperature for superconductivity was also close to the value of the bulk Nb.\nThe quality of Nb film was evident in the presence of a very thin proximity\nlayer (~ 0.8 nm). The experimental results demonstrated that the preparation of\nsmooth Nb films with adequate superconductivity by BTIBD could serve as a base\nelectrode for the in-situ magnetic layer or insulating layer for\nsuperconducting electronic devices.\n", "  We study the complex geometry of generalized Kepler manifolds, defined in\nJordan theoretic terms, introduce Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions\ndefined by radial measures, and find the complete asymptotic expansion of the\ncorresponding reproducing kernels for K\\\"ahler potentials, both in the flat and\nbounded setting.\n", "  Vertex models are a popular approach to modeling the mechanical and dynamical\nproperties of dense biological tissues, describing the tissue as a network of\nconnected polygons representing the cells. Recently a class of two-dimensional\nvertex models was shown to exhibit a disordered rigidity transition controlled\nby the preferred cellular geometry, echoing experimental findings. An\nattractive variant of these models uses a Voronoi tessellation to describe the\ncells and endows them with a non-equilibrium model of cellular motility,\nleading to rich, glassy behavior. This glassy behavior was suggested to be\ninextricably linked to an underlying jamming transition. We test this\nconjecture, exploring the low-effective-temperature limit of the Voronoi model\nby studying cell trajectories from detailed dynamical simulations in\ncombination with rigidity measurements of energy-minimized disordered cell\nconfigurations. We find that the zero-temperature limit of this model has no\nunjamming transition.\n", "  The dissociation of excited electron-hole pairs is a microscopic process that\nis fundamental to the performance of photovoltaic systems. For this process to\nbe successful, the oppositely charged electron and hole must overcome an\nelectrostatic binding energy before they undergo ground state recombination.\nHere we use a simple model of charge dynamics to investigate the role of\nmolecular disorder in this process. This model reveals that moderate spatial\nvariations in electronic energy levels, such as those that arise in disordered\nmolecular systems, can actually increase charge dissociation yields. We\ndemonstrate that this is a nonequilibrium effect that is mediated by the\ndissipation driven formation of partially dissociated intermediate states that\nare long-lived because they cannot easily recombine. We present a kinetic model\nthat incorporates these states and show that it is capable of reproducing\nsimilar behavior when it is parameterized with nonequilibrium rates.\n", "  We propose a new quantum-mechanical formalism to calculate spin torques based\non the gradient expansion, which naturally involves spacetime gradients of the\nmagnetization and electromagnetic fields. We have no assumption in the\nsmall-amplitude formalism or no difficulty in the SU($2$) gauge transformation\nformalism. As a representative, we calculate the spin renormalization, Gilbert\ndamping, spin-transfer torque, and $\\beta$-term in a three-dimensional\nferromagnetic metal with nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities being taken into\naccount within the self-consistent Born approximation. Our results serve as a\nfirst-principles formalism for spin torques.\n", "  In the coming years, it is likely that the first potentially Earth-like\nplanets will be discovered orbiting other stars. Once found, the\ncharacterisation of those planets will play a vital role in determining which\nwill be chosen as the first targets for the search for life beyond the Solar\nSystem. We must thus be able to gauge the relative importance of the various\nfactors proposed to influence potential planetary habitability, in order to\nbest focus that search.\n  One of the plethora of factors to be considered in that process is the\nclimatic variability of the exo-Earths in question. In the Solar System, the\nEarth's long-term climate is driven by several factors, including the modifying\ninfluence of life on our atmosphere, and the temporal evolution of solar\nluminosity. The gravitational influence of the other planets in the Solar\nSystem adds an extra complication, driving the Milankovitch cycles that are\nthought to have caused the on-going series of glacial and interglacial periods\nthat have dominated Earth's climate for the past few million years.\n  Here we present preliminary results of three suites of integrations that\ntogether examine the influence of Solar System architecture on the Earth's\nMilankovitch cycles. We consider separately the influence of the planets\nJupiter, Mars and Venus, each of which contributes to the forcing of Earth's\norbital evolution. Our results illustrate how small changes to the architecture\nof a given planetary system can result in marked changes in the potential\nhabitability of the planets therein, and are an important first step in\ndeveloping a means by which the nature of climate variability on planets beyond\nour Solar System can be characterised.\n", "  We study the phenomenological implications of breaking the Tri-Bimaximal\n(TBM) mixing in such a way that either first or second column of TBM mixing\nmatrix remains invariant. We present two such textures and confront them with\nthe experimental data. We give the predictions of these textures for\natmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ and Dirac-type CP violating phase\n$\\delta$ that will be measured in the future experiments.\n", "  We predict theoretically a carbon-based clathrate in the bipartite sodalite\nstructure, SrB3C3, that is thermodynamically stable at high pressure. This\nclathrate is predicted to be a dynamically stable superconductor with an\nestimated Tc of 42 K at ambient pressure. Calculated stress-strain relations\nfor SrB3C3 clathrate demonstrate its intrinsic hard nature with Vickers\nhardness of 24-31 GPa. Boron substitution aids in the stabilization of SrB3C3\nclathrate, and offers valuable insights into design guidelines for various\ncarbon-based materials.\n", "  To find the regularities of formed fingers in gravity driven coating flows on\nupper cylinder and sphere, the mathematical formulation to model the fingering\ninstability on cylindrical or spherical surface which consists of a capillary\nwave equation and a linear perturbation equation is constructed, based on the\nleading order governing equation in standard cylindrical or spherical\ncoordinate system. A disjoining pressure model is introduced to simulate the\npartial wetting process near moving contact line. The fingering number in high\n$Bo$ coating flow is focused on from a linear perspective. Using an asymptotic\ntheory, the high $Bo$ limits of the linear perturbation equations for both the\ncylindrical and spherical problems are proved to degenerate into a common\neigenvalue problem. Two analytical formulae concerning the most unstable wave\nnumber which can be described as two power laws are derived via a method of\nmodal analysis for the cylindrical and spherical problem, respectively. These\nformulae provide a succinct method to estimate the fingering number if the\nonset of the fingering instability is known. A method of transient growth\nanalysis which makes no high $Bo$ assumptions is used to verify the accuracy of\nthe asymptotic theory and modal analysis. In particular, an asymptotic behavior\nof the most unstable wave number as $Bo$ increases is highlighted. We show that\nthe linear growth rate may be improved by the disjoining pressure, which can be\nattributed to the effect of partial wetting, but the most unstable wave number\nis insensitive to the wetting model.\n", "  The High-Altitude Water-Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment is a TeV $\\gamma$-ray\nobservatory located \\unit[4100]{m} above sea level on the Sierra Negra mountain\nin Puebla, Mexico. The detector consists of 300 water-filled tanks, each\ninstrumented with 4 photomultiplier tubes that utilize the water-Cherenkov\ntechnique to detect atmospheric air showers produced by cosmic $\\gamma$ rays.\nConstruction of HAWC was completed in March of 2015. The experiment's wide\ninstantaneous field of view (\\unit[2]{sr}) and high duty cycle (> 95\\%) make it\na powerful survey instrument sensitive to pulsars, supernova remnants, and\nother $\\gamma$-ray sources. The mechanisms of particle acceleration at these\nsources can be studied by analyzing their high-energy spectra. To this end, we\nhave developed an event-by-event energy-reconstruction algorithm using an\nartificial neural network to estimate energies of primary $\\gamma$ rays at\nHAWC. We will present the details of this technique and its performance as well\nas the current progress toward using it to measure energy spectra of\n$\\gamma$-ray sources.\n", "  The S-star cluster in the Galactic center allows us to study the physics\nclose to a supermassive black hole, including distinctive dynamical tests of\ngeneral relativity. Our best estimates for the mass of and the distance to Sgr\nA* using the three stars with the shortest period (S2, S38, and S55/S0-102) and\nNewtonian models are M_BH = (4.15+- 0.13 +- 0.57) x 10^6 M_sun and R_0 = 8.19\n+- 0.11 +- 0.34 kpc. Additionally, we aim at a new and practical method to\ninvestigate the relativistic orbits of stars in the gravitational field near\nSgr A*. We use a first-order post- Newtonian approximation to calculate the\nstellar orbits with a broad range of periapse distance r_p. We present a method\nthat employs the changes in orbital elements derived from elliptical fits to\ndifferent sections of the orbit. These changes are correlated with the\nrelativistic parameter defined as {\\Upsilon} = r_s/r_p (with r_s being the\nSchwarzschild radius) and can be used to derive {\\Upsilon} from observational\ndata. For S2 we find a value of {\\Upsilon} = 0.00088 +- 0.00080, which is\nconsistent, within the uncertainty, with the expected value of {\\Upsilon} =\n0.00065 derived from MBH and the orbit of S2. We argue that the derived\nquantity is unlikely to be dominated by perturbing influences such as noise on\nthe derived stellar positions, field rotation, and drifts in black hole mass.\n", "  This paper deals with the possible motion of nucleons in the nucleus, which\nis due to realistic inter-nucleonic forces. This approach provides new or more\nsubstantiated conclusions about the nuclear structure than those based on the\neffective interaction of nucleons, while the shell model of the nucleus may\nlead to questionable conclusions regarding the nuclear structure and nuclear\nreaction mechanisms.\n", "  In this work we present a detailed analysis of the second-order piezoelectric\neffect in $c$-plane In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N/GaN quantum dots and its consequences\nfor electronic and optical properties of these systems. Special attention is\npaid to the impact of increasing In content $x$ on the results. We find that in\ngeneral the second-order piezoelectric effect leads to an increase of the\nelectrostatic built-in field. Furthermore, our results show that for an In\ncontent $\\geq$30\\% this increase in the built-in field has a significant effect\non the emission wavelength and the radiative lifetimes. For instance, at 40\\%\nIn, the radiative lifetime is more than doubled when taking second-order\npiezoelectricity into account. Overall our calculations reveal that when\ndesigning and describing the electronic and optical properties of $c$-plane\nIn$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N/GaN quantum dot based light emitters with high In contents,\nsecond-order piezoelectric effects cannot be neglected.\n", "  There are two accepted mechanisms to explain the origin of runaway OB-type\nstars: the Binary Supernova Scenario (BSS), and the Cluster Ejection Scenario\n(CES). In the former, a supernova explosion within a close binary ejects the\nsecondary star, while in the latter close multi-body interactions in a dense\ncluster cause one or more of the stars to be ejected from the region at high\nvelocity. Both mechanisms have the potential to affect the surface composition\nof the runaway star. TLUSTY non-LTE model atmosphere calculations have been\nused to determine atmospheric parameters and carbon, nitrogen, magnesium and\nsilicon abundances for a sample of B-type runaways. These same analytical tools\nwere used by Hunter et al. (2009) for their analysis of 50 B-type open cluster\nGalactic stars (i.e. non-runaways). Effective temperatures were deduced using\nthe silicon-ionization balance technique, surface gravities from Balmer line\nprofiles and microturbulent velocities derived using the Si spectrum. The\nrunaways show no obvious abundance anomalies when compared with stars in the\nopen clusters. The runaways do show a spread in composition which almost\ncertainly reflects the Galactic abundance gradient and a range in the\nbirthplaces of the runaways in the Galactic disk. Since the observed Galactic\nabundance gradients of C, N, Mg and Si are of a similar magnitude, the\nabundance ratios (e.g., N/Mg) are, as obtained, essentially uniform across the\nsample.\n", "  A major challenge for power grids with a high share of renewable energy\nsystems (RES), such as island grids, is to provide frequency stability in the\nface of renewable fluctuations. In this work we evaluate the ability of\nelectric vehicles (EV) to provide distributed primary control and to eliminate\nfrequency peaks. To do so we for the first time explicitly model the network\nstructure and incorporate non-Gaussian, strongly intermittent fluctuations\ntypical for RES.\n  We show that EVs can completely eliminate frequency peaks. Using threshold\nrandomization we further demonstrate that demand synchronization effects and\nbattery stresses can be greatly reduced. In contrast, explicit frequency\naveraging has a strong destabilizing effect, suggesting that the role of delays\nin distributed control schemes requires further studies.\n  Overall we find that distributed control outperforms central one. The results\nare robust against a further increase in renewable power production and\nfluctuations.\n", "  The feasibility of uniquely estimating parameters of dynamical systems from\nobservations is a widely discussed aspect of mathematical modelling. Several\napproaches have been published for analyzing identifiability. However, they are\ntypically computationally demanding, difficult to perform and/or not applicable\nin many application settings.\n  Here, an intuitive approach is presented which enables quickly testing of\nparameter identifiability. Numerical optimization with a penalty in radial\ndirection enforcing displacement of the parameters is used to check whether\nestimated parameters are unique, or whether the parameters can be altered\nwithout loss of agreement with the data indicating non-identifiability. This\nIdentifiability-Test by Radial Penalization (ITRP) can be employed for every\nmodel where optimization-based fitting like least-squares or maximum likelihood\nis feasible and is therefore applicable for all typical deterministic models.\n  The approach is illustrated and tested using 11 ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) models. The presented approach can be implemented without great\nefforts in any modelling framework. It is available within the free\nMatlab-based modelling toolbox Data2Dynamics. Source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Data2Dynamics.\n", "  A phase plot of the oil economy is built using the literature data of world\noil production, price, and EROEI (Energy Returned on Energy Invested). An\nanalogy between the oil economy and the Benard convection is proposed; some\nmethods of interpretation and forecast of the system behavior are also shown\nbased on \"phase portrait\" using as main variables the price, production and\nEROEI values. A scenery is proposed on this basis.\n", "  This paper discusses the physics, engineering and mission architecture\nrelating to a gram-sized interstellar probe propelled by a laser beam. The\nobjectives are to design a fly-by mission to Alpha Centauri with a total\nmission duration of 50 years travelling at a cruise speed of 0.1c. Furthermore,\noptical data from the target star system is to be obtained and sent back to the\nSolar system. The main challenges of such a mission are presented and possible\nsolutions proposed. The results show that by extrapolating from currently\nexisting technology, such a mission would be feasible. The total mass of the\nproposed spacecraft is 23g and the space-based laser infrastructure has a beam\npower output of 15GW. Rurther exploration of the laser - spacecraft tradespace\nand associated technologies are necessary.\n", "  This thesis centres on the development of multidimensional fluorescence\nimaging tools, with a particular emphasis on fluorescence lifetime imaging\n(FLIM) microscopy for application to biological research. The key aspects of\nthis thesis are the development and application of tunable supercontinuum\nexcitation sources based on supercontinuum generation in microstructured\noptical fibres and the development of stimulated emission depletion (STED)\nmicroscope capable of fluorescence lifetime imaging beyond the diffraction\nlimit. The utility of FLIM for biological research is illustrated by examples\nof experimental studies of the molecular structure of sarcomeres in muscle\nfibres and of signalling at the immune synapse. The application of\nmicrostructured optical fibre to provide tunable supercontinuum excitation\nsource for a range of FLIM microscopes is presented, including wide-field,\nNipkow disk confocal and hyper-spectral line scanning FLIM microscopes. The\napplication of supercontinuum generation to the first super-resolved FLIM\nmicroscope is then described. This novel microscope exploited the concept of\nSTED with a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser providing a tunable\nexcitation beam by pumping microstructured optical fibre for supercontinuum\ngeneration and directly providing the (longer wavelength) STED beam. This STED\nmicroscope was implemented in a commercial scanning confocal microscope to\nprovide compatibility with standard biological imaging, and exploited digital\nholography using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to provide the appropriate\nphase manipulation for shaping the STED beam profile and to compensate for\naberrations. The STED microscope was shown to be capable of recording\nsuperresolution images in both the lateral and axial planes, according to the\nsettings of the SLM.\n", "  Metal organic magnets have enormous potential to host a variety of electronic\nand magnetic phases that originate from a strong interplay between the spin,\norbital and lattice degrees of freedom. We control this interplay in the\nquantum magnet CuF$_2$(D$_2$O)$_2$pyz by using high pressure to drive the\nsystem through a structural and magnetic phase transition. Using neutron\nscattering, we show that the low pressure state, which hosts a two-dimensional\nsquare lattice with spin-wave excitations and a dominant exchange coupling of\n0.89 meV, transforms at high pressure into a one-dimensional spin-chain\nhallmarked by a spinon continuum and a reduced exchange interaction of 0.43\nmeV. This direct microscopic observation of a magnetic dimensional crossover as\na function of pressure opens up new possibilities for studying the evolution of\nfractionalised excitations in low dimensional quantum magnets and eventually\npressure-controlled metal--insulator transitions.\n", "  Recent spectroscopic observations of a few thousand partially obscured\ngalaxies in the Vela constellation revealed a massive overdensity on\nsupercluster scales straddling the Galactic Equator (l $\\sim$ 272.5deg) at $cz\n\\sim 18000$km/s. It remained unrecognised because it is located just beyond the\nboundaries and volumes of systematic whole-sky redshift and peculiar velocity\nsurveys - and is obscured by the Milky Way. The structure lies close to the\napex where residual bulkflows suggest considerable mass excess. The uncovered\nVela Supercluster (VSCL) conforms of a confluence of merging walls, but its\ncore remains uncharted. At the thickest foreground dust column densities (|b| <\n6 deg) galaxies are not visible and optical spectroscopy is not effective. This\nprecludes a reliable estimate of the mass of VSCL, hence its effect on the\ncosmic flow field and the peculiar velocity of the Local Group. Only systematic\nHI-surveys can bridge that gap. We have run simulations and will present\nearly-science observing scenarios with MeerKAT 32 (M32) to complete the census\nof this dynamically and cosmologically relevant supercluster. M32 has been put\nforward because this pilot project will also serve as precursor project for HI\nMeerKAT Large Survey Projects, like Fornax and Laduma. Our calculations have\nshown that a survey area of the fully obscured part of the supercluster, where\nthe two walls cross and the potential core of the supercluster resides, can be\nachieved on reasonable time-scales (200 hrs) with M32.\n", "  The modified Navier-Stokes equation describing the velocity field in the\nsuperfluid quantum space is loaded by the external Lorentz force introducing\nelectromagnetic fields. In order to open the path for getting the\n\\Schrodinger-Pauli equation describing the behavior of a particle with spin-1/2\nin the magnetic field we need to extend the continuity equation to take into\naccount conservation of spin flows on the 3D sphere. This extension includes\nconservation of the density distribution function in 6D space, that is a\nmultiplication of the 3D Euclidean space by the 3D sphere of unit radius. The\nspecial unitary group SU(2) underlies the rotations of the spin on this sphere.\nThis group is isomorphic to the group of quaternions containing the real 4x4\nmatrices of norm 1. Transition to the quaternion group opens up the way to the\npossibility of describing the spin-1/2 behavior in a magnetic field as a motion\nof a spin flag on the 2D sphere. Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory\nmanifests itself in the quaternion group basis by the natural manner.\n", "  Within a random-matrix-theory approach, we use the nearest-neighbor energy\nlevel spacing distribution $P(s)$ and the entropic eigenfunction localization\nlength $\\ell$ to study spectral and eigenfunction properties (of adjacency\nmatrices) of weighted random--geometric and random--rectangular graphs. A\nrandom--geometric graph (RGG) considers a set of vertices uniformly and\nindependently distributed on the unit square, while for a random--rectangular\ngraph (RRG) the embedding geometry is a rectangle. The RRG model depends on\nthree parameters: The rectangle side lengths $a$ and $1/a$, the connection\nradius $r$, and the number of vertices $N$. We then study in detail the case\n$a=1$ which corresponds to weighted RGGs and explore weighted RRGs\ncharacterized by $a\\sim 1$, i.e.~two-dimensional geometries, but also approach\nthe limit of quasi-one-dimensional wires when $a\\gg1$. In general we look for\nthe scaling properties of $P(s)$ and $\\ell$ as a function of $a$, $r$ and $N$.\nWe find that the ratio $r/N^\\gamma$, with $\\gamma(a)\\approx -1/2$, fixes the\nproperties of both RGGs and RRGs. Moreover, when $a\\ge 10$ we show that\nspectral and eigenfunction properties of weighted RRGs are universal for the\nfixed ratio $r/{\\cal C}N^\\gamma$, with ${\\cal C}\\approx a$.\n", "  The interference effect between leptonic radiative corrections and hadronic\npolarization functions is calculated via optical theorem for $\\mu-$pair\nproductions. Fine selected new data for the production cross section\n$\\sigma_h(e^+e^-\\rightarrow hadrons$) are used for calculation of hadronic\nvacuum polarization, which enter the dressed photon propagator in muon pair\nproduction. The result is compared with KLOE experiment for $\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}$\nproduction at $\\phi $ meson energy, as well as the running fine structure\ncoupling is compared with recent KLOE2 experiment for radiative return\n$\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}$ production at $ \\omega/\\rho $ meson energy.\n", "  In this paper we employ the Renormalization Group (RG) method to study the\nlong-time asymptotics of a class of nonlinear integral equations with a\ngeneralized heat kernel and with time-dependent coefficients. The\nnonlinearities are classified and studied according to its role in the\nasymptotic behavior. Here we prove that adding nonlinear perturbations\nclassified as irrelevant, the behavior of the solution in the limit $t\n\\to\\infty$ remains unchanged from the linear case. In a companion paper, we\nwill include a type of nonlinearities called marginal and we will show that, in\nthis case, the large time limit gains an extra logarithmic decay factor.\n", "  Quantum coherence phenomena driven by electronic-vibrational (vibronic)\ninteractions, are being reported in many pulse (e.g. laser) driven chemical and\nbiophysical systems. But what systems-level advantage(s) do such many-body\ncoherences offer to future technologies? We address this question for pulsed\nsystems of general size N, akin to the LHCII aggregates found in green plants.\nWe show that external pulses generate vibronic states containing particular\nmultipartite entanglements, and that such collective vibronic states increase\nthe excitonic transfer efficiency. The strength of these many-body coherences\nand their robustness to decoherence, increase with aggregate size N and do not\nrequire strong electronic-vibrational coupling. The implications for energy and\ninformation transport are discussed.\n", "  We develop a quantum theory of near-field electrodynamical properties of\ncarbon nanotubes and investigate spontaneous decay dynamics of excited states\nand van der Waals attraction of the ground state of an atomic system close to a\nsingle-wall nanotube surface. Atomic spontaneous decay exhibits vacuum-field\nRabi oscillations -- a principal signature of strong atom-vacuum-field\ncoupling. The strongly coupled atomic state is nothing but a 'quasi-1D cavity\npolariton'. Its stability is mainly determined by the atom-nanotube van der\nWaals interaction. Our calculations of the ground-state atom van der Waals\nenergy performed within a universal quantum mechanical approach valid for both\nweak and strong atom-field coupling demonstrate the inapplicability of\nconventional weak-coupling-based van der Waals interaction models in a close\nvicinity of the nanotube surface.\n"]}
