magnetization and d.c. susceptibility measurements,\nElectron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\n(NMR) over a wide range of temperature (1.6-300K) at applied magnetic fields,\nH=0.5 and 1.5 Tesla. The two molecular magnets consist of\nCuII(saldmen)(H2O)}6{FeIII(CN)6}](ClO4)38H2O in short Cu6Fe and the analog\ncompound with cobalt, Cu6Co. It is found that in Cu6Fe whose magnetic core is\nconstituted by six Cu2+ ions and one Fe3+ ion all with s=1/2, a weak\nferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ moments through the central Fe3+ ion\nwith J = 0.14 K is present, while in Cu6Co the Co3+ ion is diamagnetic and the\nweak interaction is antiferromagnetic with J = -1.12 K. The NMR spectra show\nthe presence of non equivalent groups of protons with a measurable contact\nhyperfine interaction consistent with a small admixture of s-wave function with\nthe d-function of the magnetic ion. The NMR relaxation results are explained in\nterms of a single ion (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co3+) uncorrelated spin dynamics with an\nalmost temperature independent correlation time due to the weak magnetic\nexchange interaction. We conclude that the two molecular magnets studied here\nbehave as single molecule paramagnets with a very weak intramolecular\ninteraction, almost of the order of the dipolar intermolecular interaction.\nThus they represent a new class of molecular magnets which differ from the\nsingle molecule magnets investigated up to now, where the intramolecular\ninteraction is much larger than the intermolecular one.\n", "  We study the electron states of a chain of non-identical, vertically stacked\nquantum dots (QDs). We discuss how the pseudo-band formed of the ground states\nconfined in the QDs disintegrates upon increasing the inhomogeneity of the\nelectron energies and analyze the impact of localization on the intraband\nabsorption from the pseudo-band to extended (bulk) states. We describe also the\ndependence of the intraband absorption spectrum on the QD size.\n", "  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study on morphological changes in gold\nnanostructures deposited on Si (100) upon annealing under different vacuum\nconditions has been reported. Au thin films of thickness ~2.0 nm were deposited\nunder high vacuum condition (with the native oxide at the interface of Au and\nSi) using thermal evaporation. In-situ, high temperature (from room temperature\n(RT) to 850\\degreeC) real time TEM measurements showed the evaluation of gold\nnanoparticles into rectangular/square shaped gold silicide structures. This has\nbeen attributed to selective thermal decomposition of native oxide layer.\nEx-situ annealing in low vacuum (10-2 mbar) at 850\\degreeC showed no growth of\nnano-gold silicide structures. Under low vacuum annealing conditions, the\ncreation of oxide could be dominating compared to the decomposition of oxide\nlayers resulting in the formation of barrier layer between Au and Si.\n", "  To understand surface structural modifications for Au/Si (100) system, a thin\ngold film of ~2.0 nm was deposited under ultra high vacuum (UHV) condition on\nreconstructed Si surfaces using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Post annealing\nwas done at 500{\\deg}C in three different vacuum conditions: (1) low vacuum\n(LV) furnace (10-2 mbar), (2) UHV (10-10 mbar) (MBE chamber), (3) high vacuum\n(HV) chamber. The variation in the overall shape of the gold nanostructures and\nfiner changes at the edges, like rounding of corners has been reported in this\nwork. Although well aligned nano rectangles were formed in both HV and LV\ncases, corner rounding is more prominent in LV case. Furthermore in UHV case,\nrandom structures were formed having sharp corners. In all the above three\ncases, samples were exposed to air (for half an hour) before annealing. To\nstudy the effect of surface oxide, in-situ annealing inside UHV-MBE chamber was\ndone without exposing to air. Well aligned rectangles with sharp corners (no\ncorner rounding) were formed. The details about the role of surface oxides in\nthe corner rounding process are discussed.\n", "  We present a novel experimental tool allowing for kinematically complete\nstudies of break-up processes of laser-cooled atoms. This apparatus, the\n'MOTReMi', is a combination of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and a Reaction\nMicroscope (ReMi). Operated in an ion-storage ring, the new setup enables to\nstudy the dynamics in swift ion-atom collisions on an unprecedented level of\nprecision and detail. In first experiments on collisions with 1.5 MeV/amu\nO$^{8+}$-Li the pure ionization of the valence electron as well as\nionization-excitation of the lithium target has been investigated.\n", "  We show that driven dislocation assemblies exhibit a set of dynamical phases\nremarkably similar to those of driven systems with quenched disorder such as\nvortices in superconductors, magnetic domain walls, and charge density wave\nmaterials. These phases include jammed, fluctuating, and dynamically ordered\nstates, and each produces distinct dislocation patterns as well as specific\nfeatures in the noise fluctuations and transport properties. Our work suggests\nthat many of the results established for systems with quenched disorder\nundergoing depinning transitions can be applied to dislocation systems,\nproviding a new approach for understanding dislocation pattern formation and\ndynamics.\n", "  We report magnetization, specific heat, and NMR investigations on YFe2Al10\nover a wide range in temperature and magnetic field and zero field (NQR)\nmeasurements. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate divided by T (1/T1T) follow a weak power law (T^-0.4)\ntemperature dependence, which is a signature of critical fluctuations of Fe\nmoments. The value of the Sommerfeld-Wilson ratio and linear relation between\n1/T1T and chi(T) suggest the existence of ferromagnetic correlations in this\nsystem. No magnetic ordering down to 50 mK in Cp(T) and the unusual temperature\nand field scaling of the bulk and NMR data are associated with a magnetic\ninstability which drives the system to quantum criticality. The magnetic\nproperties of the system are tuned by field wherein ferromagnetic fluctuations\nare suppressed and a crossover from quantum critical to FL behavior is observed\nwith increasing magnetic field.\n", "  When active matter particles such as swimming bacteria are placed in an\nasymmetric array of funnels, it has been shown that a ratchet effect can occur\neven in the absence of an external drive. Here we examine active ratchets for\ntwo dimensional arrays of funnels or L-shapes where there is also an externally\napplied dc drive or drift. We show that for certain conditions, the ratchet\neffect can be strongly enhanced, and that it is possible to have conditions\nunder which run-and-tumble particles with one run length move in the opposite\ndirection from particles with a different run length. For the arrays of\nL-shapes, we find that the application of a drift force can enhance a\ntransverse rectification in the direction perpendicular to the drift. When\nparticle-particle steric interactions are included, we find that the ratchet\neffects can be either enhanced or suppressed depending on barrier geometry,\nparticle run length, and particle density.\n", "  We numerically examine dynamical irreversible to reversible transitions and\nrandom organization for periodically driven gliding dislocation assemblies\nusing the stroboscopic protocol developed to identify random organization in\nperiodically driven dilute colloidal suspensions. We find that the gliding\ndislocations exhibit features associated with random organization and evolve\ninto a dynamically reversible state after a transient time extending over a\nnumber of cycles. At a critical shearing amplitude, the transient time\ndiverges. When the dislocations enter the reversible state they organize into\npatterns with fragmented domain wall type features.\n", "  In this work we provide an overview of jamming transitions in two dimensional\nsystems focusing on the limit of frictionless particle interactions in the\nabsence of thermal fluctuations. We first discuss jamming in systems with short\nrange repulsive interactions, where the onset of jamming occurs at a critical\npacking density and where certain quantities show a divergence indicative of\ncritical behavior. We describe how aspects of the dynamics change as the\njamming density is approached and how these dynamics can be explored using\nexternally driven probes. Different particle shapes can produce jamming\ndensities much lower than those observed for disk-shaped particles, and we show\nhow jamming exhibits fragility for some shapes while for other shapes this is\nabsent. Next we describe the effects of long range interactions and jamming\nbehavior in systems such as charged colloids, vortices in type-II\nsuperconductors, and dislocations. We consider the effect of adding obstacles\nto frictionless jamming systems and discuss connections between this type of\njamming and systems that exhibit depinning transitions. Finally, we discuss\nopen questions such as whether the jamming transition in all these different\nsystems can be described by the same or a small subset of universal behaviors,\nas well as future directions for studies of jamming transitions in two\ndimensional systems, such as jamming in self-driven or active matter systems.\n", "  We numerically examine the transport of active run-and-tumble particles\ndriven with a drift force over random disordered landscapes comprised of fixed\nobstacles. For increasing run lengths, the net particle transport initially\nincreases before reaching a maximum and decreasing at larger run lengths. The\ntransport reduction is associated with the formation of cluster or living\ncrystal states that become locally jammed or clogged by the obstacles. We also\nfind that the system dynamically jams at lower particle densities when the run\nlength is increased. Our results indicate that there is an optimal activity\nlevel for active matter transport through quenched disorder, and could be\nimportant for understanding biological transport in complex environments or for\napplications of active matter particles in random media.\n", "  The mesoscale structure of aeolian sand transport determines a variety of\nnatural phenomena studied in planetary and Earth science. We analyze it\ntheoretically beyond the mean-field level, based on the grain-scale transport\nkinetics and splash statistics. A coarse-grained analytical model is proposed\nand verified by numerical simulations resolving individual grain trajectories.\nThe predicted height-resolved sand flux and other important characteristics of\nthe aeolian transport layer agree remarkably well with a comprehensive\ncompilation of field and wind tunnel data, suggesting that the model robustly\ncaptures the essential mesoscale physics. By comparing the saturation length\nwith field data for the minimum sand-dune size, we can reconcile conflicting\nprevious models for this most enigmatic emergent aeolian scale and elucidate\nthe importance of intermittent turbulent wind fluctuations for field\nmeasurements.\n", "  We numerically examine the two-dimensional ordering of a stripe forming\nsystem of particles with competing long-range repulsion and short-range\nattraction in the presence of a quasi-one-dimensional corrugated substrate. As\na function of increasing substrate strength or the ratio of the number of\nparticles to the number of substrate minima we show that a remarkable variety\nof distinct orderings can be realized, including modulated stripes, prolate\nclump phases, two dimensional ordered kink structures, crystalline void phases,\nand smectic phases. Additionally in some cases the stripes align perpendicular\nto the substrate troughs. Our results suggest that a new route to self assembly\nfor systems with competing interactions can be achieved through the addition of\na simple periodic modulated substrate.\n", "  We examine a two-dimensional system of sterically repulsive interacting disks\nwhere each particle runs in a random direction. This system is equivalent to a\nrun-and-tumble dynamics system in the limit where the run time is infinite. At\nlow densities, we find a strongly fluctuating state composed of transient\nclusters. Above a critical density that is well below the density at which\nnon-active particles would crystallize, the system can organize into a drifting\nquiescent or frozen state where the fluctuations are lost and large\ncrystallites form surrounded by a small density of individual particles.\nAlthough all the particles are still moving, their paths form closed orbits.\nThe average transient time to organize into the quiescent state diverges as a\npower law upon approaching the critical density from above. We compare our\nresults to the random organization observed for periodically sheared systems\nthat can undergo an absorbing transition from a fluctuating state to a\ndynamical non-fluctuating state. In the random organization studies, the system\norganizes to a state in which the particles no longer interact; in contrast, we\nfind that the randomly running active matter organizes to a strongly\ninteracting dynamically jammed state. We show that the transition to the frozen\nstate is robust against a certain range of stochastic fluctuations. We also\nexamine the effects of adding a small number of pinned particles to the system\nand find that the transition to the frozen state shifts to significantly lower\ndensities and arises via the nucleation of faceted crystals centered at the\nobstacles.\n", "  We use particle-based simulations to examine the static and driven collective\nphases of skyrmions interacting with random quenched disorder. We show that\nnon-dissipative effects due to the Magnus term reduce the depinning threshold\nand strongly affect the skyrmion motion and the nature of the dynamic phases.\nThe quenched disorder causes the Hall angle to become drive-dependent in the\nmoving skyrmion phase, while different flow regimes produce distinct signatures\nin the transport curves. For weak disorder, the skyrmions form a pinned crystal\nand depin elastically, while for strong disorder the system forms a pinned\namorphous state that depins plastically. At high drives the skyrmions can\ndynamically reorder into a moving crystal, with the onset of reordering\ndetermined by the strength of the Magnus term.\n", "  The interplay of symmetry and topological order leads to a variety of\ndistinct phases of matter, the Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) phases. Here\nwe discuss physical observables that distinguish different SETs in the context\nof Z$_2$ quantum spin liquids with SU(2) spin rotation invariance. We focus on\nthe cylinder geometry, and show that ground state quantum numbers for different\ntopological sectors are robust invariants which can be used to identify the SET\nphase. More generally these invariants are related to 1D symmetry protected\ntopological phases when viewing the cylinder geometry as a 1D spin chain. In\nparticular we show that the Kagome spin liquid SET can be determined by\nmeasurements on one ground state, by wrapping the Kagome in a few different\nways on the cylinder. In addition to guiding numerical studies, this approach\nprovides a transparent way to connect bosonic and fermionic mean field theories\nof spin liquids. When fusing quasiparticles, it correctly predicts nontrivial\nphase factors for combining their space group quantum numbers.\n", "  The phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on the hexagonal (honeycomb)\nlattice is computed numerically, extending on earlier work by Moessner, Sondhi,\nand Chandra. The different ground state phases are studied in detail using\nseveral local and global observables. In addition, we analyze imaginary-time\ncorrelation functions to determine ground state energies as well as gaps to the\nfirst excited states. This leads in particular to a confirmation that the\nintermediary so-called plaquette phase is gapped -- a point which was\npreviously advocated with general arguments and some data for an order\nparameter, but required a more direct proof. On the technical side, we describe\nan efficient world-line quantum Monte Carlo algorithm with improved cluster\nupdates that increase acceptance probabilities by taking account of potential\nterms of the Hamiltonian during the cluster construction. The Monte Carlo\nsimulations are supplemented with variational computations.\n", "  When a particle is driven with an ac force over an asymmetric potential, it\ncan undergo a ratchet effect that produces a net dc motion of the particle.\nRatchet effects have been observed in numerous systems such as superconducting\nvortices on asymmetric pinning substrates. Skyrmions, stable topological spin\ntextures with particle-like properties, have many similarities to vortices but\ntheir behavior is strongly influenced by non-disspative effects arising from a\nMagnus term in their equation of motion. We show using numerical simulations\nthat pronounced ratchet effects can occur for ac driven skyrmions moving over\nasymmetric quasi-one-dimensional substrates. We find a new type of ratchet\neffect called a Magnus-induced transverse ratchet that arises when the ac\ndriving force is applied perpendicular rather than parallel to the asymmetry\ndirection of the substrate. This transverse ratchet effect only occurs when the\nMagnus term is finite, and the threshold ac amplitude needed to induce it\ndecreases as the Magnus term becomes more prominent. Ratcheting skyrmions\nfollow ordered orbits in which the net displacement parallel to the substrate\nasymmetry direction is quantized. Skyrmion ratchets represent a new ac\ncurrent-based method for controlling skyrmion positions and motion for\nspintronic applications.\n", "  We study the entropy increase of quantum systems evolving under primitive,\ndoubly stochastic Markovian noise and thus converging to the maximally mixed\nstate. This entropy increase can be quantified by a logarithmic-Sobolev\nconstant of the Liouvillian generating the noise. We prove a universal lower\nbound on this constant that stays invariant under taking tensor-powers. Our\nmethods involve a new comparison method to relate logarithmic-Sobolev constants\nof different Liouvillians and a technique to compute logarithmic-Sobolev\ninequalities of Liouvillians with eigenvectors forming a projective\nrepresentation of a finite abelian group. Our bounds improve upon similar\nresults established before and as an application we prove an upper bound on\ncontinuous-time quantum capacities. In the last part of this work we study\nentropy production estimates of discrete-time doubly-stochastic quantum\nchannels by extending the framework of discrete-time logarithmic-Sobolev\ninequalities to the quantum case.\n", "  By exploiting two sets of high-resolution images obtained with HST ACS/WFC\nover a baseline of ~10 years we have measured relative proper motions of\n~70,000 stars in the stellar system Terzan 5. The results confirm the\nmembership of the three sub-populations with different iron abudances\ndiscovered in the system. The orbit of the system has been derived from a first\nestimate of its absolute proper motion, obtained by using bulge stars as\nreference. The results of the integration of this orbit within an axisymmetric\nGalactic model exclude any external accretion origin for this cluster. Terzan 5\nis known to have chemistry similar to the Galactic bulge; our findings support\na kinematic link between the cluster and the bulge, further strengthening the\npossibility that Terzan 5 is the fossil remnant of one of the pristine clumps\nthat originated the bulge.\n", "  We numerically study the behavior of two-dimensional skyrmions in the\npresence of a quasi-one-dimensional sinusoidal substrate under the influence of\nexternally applied dc and ac drives. In the overdamped limit, when both dc and\nac drives are aligned in the longitudinal direction parallel to the direction\nof the substrate modulation, the velocity-force curves exhibit classic Shapiro\nstep features when the frequency of the ac drive matches the washboard\nfrequency that is dynamically generated by the motion of the skyrmions over the\nsubstrate, similar to previous observations in superconducting vortex systems.\nIn the case of skyrmions, the additional contribution to the skyrmion motion\nfrom a non-dissipative Magnus force shifts the location of the locking steps to\nhigher dc drives, and we find that the skyrmions move at an angle with respect\nto the direction of the dc drive. For a longitudinal dc drive and a\nperpendicular or transverse ac drive, the overdamped system exhibits no Shapiro\nsteps; however, when a finite Magnus force is present we find pronounced\ntransverse Shapiro steps along with complex two-dimensional periodic orbits of\nthe skyrmions in the phase-locked regimes. Both the longitudinal and transverse\nac drives produce locking steps whose widths oscillate with increasing ac drive\namplitude. We examine the role of collective skyrmion interactions and find\nthat additional fractional locking steps occur for both longitudinal and\ntransverse ac drives. At higher skyrmion densities, the system undergoes a\nseries of dynamical order-disorder transitions, with the skyrmions forming a\nmoving solid on the phase locking steps and a fluctuating dynamical liquid in\nregimes between the steps.\n", "  We use about 200,000 FGK type main-sequence stars from the LAMOST DR1 data to\nmap the local stellar kinematics. With the velocity de-projection technique, we\nare able to derive the averaged 3 dimensional velocity and velocity ellipsoids\nusing only the line-of-sight velocity for the stars with various effective\ntemperatures within $100 < |z| < 500$ pc. Using the mean velocities of the cool\nstars, we derive the solar motion of ($U_{\\!\\odot}$, $V_{\\!\\odot}$,\n$W_{\\!\\odot}$)=(9.58$\\pm2.39$, 10.52$\\pm1.96$, 7.01$\\pm1.67$)$km\\,s^{-1}$ with\nrespect to the local standard of rest. Moreover, we find that the stars with\n${T}_{\\rm eff}>6000$K show a net asymmetric motion of $\\sim3 km\\,s^{-1}$ in\n$\\langle W\\rangle$ compared to the stars with ${T}_{\\rm eff}<6000$K. And their\nazimuthal velocity increases when $|z|$ increases. This peculiar motion in the\nwarmer stars is likely because they are young and not completely relaxed,\nalthough other reasons, such as the resonance induced by the central rotating\nbar or the spiral structures, and the perturbation of the merging dwarf\ngalaxies, can not be ruled out. The derived velocity dispersions and cross\nterms for the data are approximately consistent with previous studies. We also\nfind that the vertical gradients of $\\sigma_{U}$ and $\\sigma_V$ are larger than\nthat of $\\sigma_W$ . And the vertical gradient of $\\sigma_U$ shows clear\ncorrelation with ${T}_{\\rm eff}$, while the other two do not. Finally, our\nsample shows vertex deviation of about 11$^\\circ$, at $300 < |z| < 500$pc, but\nroughly zero at $100 < |z| < 300$pc.\n", "  Proton migration is a ubiquitous process in chemical reactions related to\nbiology, combustion, and catalysis. Thus, the ability to control the movement\nof nuclei with tailored light, within a hydrocarbon molecule holds promise for\nfar-reaching applications. Here, we demonstrate the steering of hydrogen\nmigration in simple hydrocarbons, namely acetylene and allene, using\nwaveform-controlled, few-cycle laser pulses. The rearrangement dynamics are\nmonitored using coincident 3D momentum imaging spectroscopy, and described with\na quantum-dynamical model. Our observations reveal that the underlying control\nmechanism is due to the manipulation of the phases in a vibrational wavepacket\nby the intense off-resonant laser field.\n", "  We examine the statics and dynamics of vortices in the presence of a periodic\nquasi-one dimensional substrate, focusing on the limit where the vortex lattice\nconstant is smaller than the substrate lattice period. As a function of the\nsubstrate strength and filling factor, within the pinned state we observe a\nseries of order-disorder transitions associated with buckling phenomena in\nwhich the number of vortex rows that fit between neighboring substrate maxima\nincreases. These transitions coincide with steps in the depinning threshold,\njumps in the density of topological defects, and changes in the structure\nfactor. At the buckling transition the vortices are disordered, while between\nthe buckling transitions the vortices form a variety of crystalline and\npartially ordered states. In the weak substrate limit, the buckling transitions\nare absent and the vortices form an ordered hexagonal lattice that undergoes\nchanges in its orientation with respect to the substrate as a function of\nvortex density. At intermediate substrate strengths, certain ordered states\nappear that are correlated with peaks in the depinning force. Under an applied\ndrive the system exhibits a rich variety of distinct dynamical phases,\nincluding plastic flow, a density-modulated moving crystal, and moving floating\nsolid phases. We also find a dynamic smectic-to-smectic transition in which the\nsmectic ordering changes from being aligned with the substrate to being aligned\nwith the external drive. The different dynamical phases can be characterized\nusing velocity histograms and the structure factor. We discuss how these\nresults are related to recent experiments on vortex ordering on\nquasi-one-dimensional periodic modulated substrates. Our results should also be\nrelevant for other types of systems such as ions, colloids, or Wigner crystals\ninteracting with periodic quasi-one-dimensional substrates.\n", "  We study the convergence of states under continuous-time depolarizing\nchannels with full rank fixed points in terms of the relative entropy. The\noptimal exponent of an upper bound on the relative entropy in this case is\ngiven by the log-Sobolev-1 constant. Our main result is the computation of this\nconstant. As an application we use the log-Sobolev-1 constant of the\ndepolarizing channels to improve the concavity inequality of the von-Neumann\nentropy. This result is compared to similar bounds obtained recently by Kim et\nal. and we show a version of Pinsker's inequality, which is optimal and tight\nif we fix the second argument of the relative entropy. Finally, we consider the\nlog-Sobolev-1 constant of tensor-powers of the completely depolarizing channel\nand use a quantum version of Shearer's inequality to prove a uniform lower\nbound.\n", "  We quantify the emergent complexity of quantum states near quantum critical\npoints on regular 1D lattices, via complex network measures based on quantum\nmutual information as the adjacency matrix, in direct analogy to quantifying\nthe complexity of EEG/fMRI measurements of the brain. Using matrix product\nstate methods, we show that network density, clustering, disparity, and\nPearson's correlation obtain the critical point for both quantum Ising and\nBose-Hubbard models to a high degree of accuracy in finite-size scaling for\nthree classes of quantum phase transitions, $Z_2$, mean field superfluid/Mott\ninsulator, and a BKT crossover.\n", "  We derive suitable uncertainty relations for characteristics functions of\nphase and number variables obtained from the Weyl form of commutation\nrelations. This is applied to finite-dimensional spin- like systems, which is\nthe case when describing the phase difference between two field modes, as well\nas to the phase and number of a single-mode field. Some contradictions between\nthe product and sums of characteristic functions are noted.\n", "  The window function for protohalos in Lagrangian space is often assumed to be\na tophat in real space. We measure this profile directly and find that it is\nmore extended than a tophat but less extended than a Gaussian; its shape is\nwell-described by rounding the edges of the tophat by convolution with a\nGaussian that has a scale length about 5 times smaller. This effective window\n$W_{\\rm eff}$ is particularly simple in Fourier space, and has an analytic form\nin real space. Together with the excursion set bias parameters, $W_{\\rm eff}$\ndescribes the scale-dependence of the Lagrangian halo-matter cross correlation\nup to $kR_{\\rm Lag} \\sim 10 $, where $R_{\\rm Lag}$ is the Lagrangian size of\nthe protohalo. Moreover, with this $W_{\\rm eff}$, all the spectral moments of\nthe power spectrum are finite, allowing a straightforward estimate of the\nexcursion set peak mass function. This estimate requires a prescription of the\ncritical overdensity enclosed within a protohalo if it is to collapse, which we\ncalibrate from simulations. We find that the resulting estimate of halo\nabundances is only accurate to about 20%, and we discuss why: A tophat in\n`infall time' towards the protohalo center need not correspond to a tophat in\nthe initial spatial distribution, so models in which infall rather than\nsmoothed overdensity is the relevant variable may be more accurate.\n", "  Blackbody radiation contains (on average) an entropy of 3.9\\pm2.5 bits per\nphoton. If the emission process is unitary, then this entropy is exactly\ncompensated by \"hidden information\" in the correlations. We extend this\nargument to the Hawking radiation from GR black holes, demonstrating that the\nassumption of unitarity leads to a perfectly reasonable entropy/information\nbudget. The key technical aspect of our calculation is a variant of the\n\"average subsystem\" approach developed by Page, which we extend beyond\nbipartite pure systems, to a tripartite pure system that considers the\ninfluence of the environment.\n", "  We present microscopic magnetic properties of a two dimensional triangular\nlattice Sc2Ga2CuO7, consisting of single and double triangular Cu planes. A\nCurie-Weiss temperature theta_CW = --44 K and an antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nexchange interaction J/KB = 35 K between Cu2+ (S = 1/2) spins in the triangular\nbi-plane are obtained from the analysis of magnetic susceptibility data. The\nintrinsic magnetic susceptibility extracted from 71Ga NMR shift data displays\nthe presence of AFM short range spin correlations and remains finite down to 50\nmK suggesting an non-singlet ground state. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation\nrate (1/T1) reveals a slowing down of Cu2+ spin fluctuations with decreasing T\ndown to 100 mK. Magnetic specific heat (Cm) and 1/T1 exhibit a power law\nbehavior at low temperatures implying gapless nature of the spin excitation\nspectrum. Absence of long range magnetic ordering down to ~ J/700, nonzero spin\nsusceptibility at low T, and power law behavior of Cm and 1/T1 suggest a\ngapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) state. Our results demonstrate that\npersistent spin dynamics induced by frustration maintain a quantum-disordered\nstate at T -> 0 in this triangular lattice antiferromagnet. This suggests that\nthe low energy modes are dominated by spinon excitations in the QSL state due\nto randomness engendered by disorder and frustration.\n", "  We consider the ensemble of $N\\times N$ real random symmetric matrices\n$H_N^{(R)}$ obtained from the determinant form of the Ihara zeta function\nassociated to random graphs $\\Gamma_N^{(R)}$ of the long-range percolation\nradius model with the edge probability determined by a function $\\phi(t)$.\n  We show that the normalized eigenvalue counting function of $H_N^{( R)}$\nweakly converges in average as $N,R\\to\\infty$, $R=o(N)$ to a unique measure\nthat depends on the limiting average vertex degree of $\\Gamma_N^{(R)}$ given by\n$\\phi_1 = \\int \\phi(t) dt$. This measure converges in the limit of infinite\n$\\phi_1$ to a shift of the Wigner semi-circle distribution. We discuss\nrelations of these results with the properties of the Ihara zeta function and\nweak versions of the graph theory Riemann Hypothesis.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate experimentally a scheme to create entangled\nhistory states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type. In our\nexperiment, the polarization states of a single photon at three different times\nare prepared as a GHZ entangled history state. We define a GHZ functional which\nattains a maximum value $1$ on the ideal GHZ entangled history state and is\nbounded above by $1/16$ for any three-time history state lacking tripartite\nentanglement. We have measured the GHZ functional on a state we have prepared\nexperimentally, yielding a value of $0.656\\pm 0.005$, clearly demonstrating the\ncontribution of entangled histories.\n", "  We discuss the symmetries of the Lagrangian of the leptonic sector. We\nconsider the case when this symmetry group is a Coxeter group. The number of\nelements of the PMNS matrix predicted by this group structure would depend on\nthe number of generators of this group. We analyze finite Coxeter groups with 2\nto 4 generators and even finite subgroups of infinite Coxeter groups with 4\ngenerators and show which of them can give results that are consistent with\nexperimental data.\n", "  We propose a heralded quantum repeater based on the scattering of photons off\nsingle emitters in one-dimensional waveguides. We show the details by\nimplementing nonlocal entanglement generation, entanglement swapping, and\nentanglement purification modules with atoms in waveguides, and discuss the\nfeasibility of the repeater with currently achievable technology. In our\nscheme, the faulty events can be discarded by detecting the polarization of the\nphotons. That is, our protocols are accomplished with fidelity of 100% in\nprinciple, which is advantageous for implementing realistic long-distance\nquantum communication. Moreover, additional atomic qubits are not required, but\nonly a single-photon medium. Our scheme is scalable and attractive since it can\nbe realized in solid-state quantum systems. With the great progress on\ncontrolling atom-waveguide systems, the repeater may be very useful in quantum\ninformation processing in the future.\n", "  We investigate the performance of an underdamped stochastic heat engine for a\ntime-dependent harmonic oscillator. We analytically determine the optimal\nprotocol that maximizes the efficiency at fixed power. The maximum efficiency\nreduces to the Curzon-Ahlborn formula at maximum power and the Carnot formula\nat zero power. We further establish that the efficiency at maximum power is\nuniversally given by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency in the weakly damped regime.\nFinally, we show that even small deviations from operation at maximum power may\nresult in a significantly increased efficiency.\n", "  We review the depinning and nonequilibrium phases of collectively interacting\nparticle systems driven over random or periodic substrates. This type of system\nis relevant to vortices in type-II superconductors, sliding charge density\nwaves, electron crystals, colloids, stripe and pattern forming systems, and\nskyrmions, and could also have connections to jamming, glassy behaviors, and\nactive matter. These systems are ideal for exploring the broader issues of\ncharacterizing transient and steady state nonequilibrium flow phases as well as\nnonequilibrium phase transitions between distinct dynamical phases, analogous\nto phase transitions between different equilibrium states. We discuss elastic\nand plastic depinning on random substrates and the different types of\nnonequilibrium phases that produce features in the velocity-force curves,\nfluctuation spectra, scaling relations, and local or global particle ordering.\nWe describe how these quantities change depending on dimension, anisotropy,\ndisorder strength, and the presence of hysteresis. Within the moving phase we\ndiscuss transitions from a liquid-like state to dynamically ordered moving\ncrystal, smectic, or nematic states. Systems with periodic or quasiperiodic\nsubstrates can have multiple nonequilibrium transitions in the moving state\nbetween chaotic and coherent phases, and can exhibit hysteresis. We also\ndiscuss systems with competing repulsive and attractive interactions, which\nundergo dynamical transitions into stripes and other complex morphologies when\ndriven over random substrates. Throughout this work we highlight open issues\nand future directions such as absorbing phase transitions, nonequilibrium work\nrelations, inertia, the role of non-dissipative dynamics such as Magnus\neffects, and how these results could be extended to the broader issues of\nplasticity in crystals, amorphous solids, and jamming phenomena.\n", "  A conformal pinning array can be created by conformally transforming a\nuniform triangular pinning lattice to produces a new structure in which the\nsix-fold ordering of the original lattice is conserved but where there is a\nspatial gradient in the density of pinning sites. Here we examine several\naspects of vortices interacting with conformal pinning arrays and how they can\nbe used to create a flux flow diode effect for driving vortices in different\ndirections across the arrays. Under the application of an ac drive, a\npronounced vortex ratchet effect occurs where the vortices flow in the easy\ndirection of the array asymmetry. When the ac drive is applied perpendicular to\nthe asymmetry direction of the array, it is possible to realize a transverse\nvortex ratchet effect where there is a generation of a dc flow of vortices\nperpendicular to the ac drive due to the creation of a noise correlation\nratchet by the plastic motion of the vortices. We also examine vortex transport\nsimulations in experiments and compare the pinning effectiveness of conformal\narrays to uniform triangular pinning arrays. We find that a triangular array\ngenerally pins the vortices more effectively at the first matching field and\nbelow, while the conformal array is more effective at higher fields where\ninterstitial vortex flow occurs.\n", "  We report single-crystal 51V NMR studies on volborthite Cu3V2O7(OH)2 2H2O,\nwhich is regarded as a quasi-two-dimensional frustrated magnet with competing\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. In the 1/3 magnetization\nplateau above 28 T, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 indicates an\nexcitation gap with a large effective g factor in the range of 4.6-5.9,\npointing to magnon bound states. Below 26 T where the gap has closed, the NMR\nspectra indicate small internal fields with a Gaussian-like distribution,\nwhereas 1/T1 shows a power-law-like temperature dependence in the paramagnetic\nstate, which resembles a slowing down of spin fluctuations associated with\nmagnetic order. We discuss the possibility of an exotic spin state caused by\nthe condensation of magnon bound states below the magnetization plateau.\n", "  In non-canonical two-field inflation models, deviations from the canonical\nmodel can be captured by a parameter $\\xi$. We show this parameter is usually\none half of the slow-roll order and analytically calculate the primordial power\nspectra accurate to order $\\xi^2$. The super-horizon perturbations are studied\nwith an improved method, which gives a correction of order $\\xi^2$. Three\ntypical examples demonstrate that our analytical formulae of power spectra fit\nwell with numerical simulation.\n", "  Ratchet effects can arise for single or collectively interacting Brownian\nparticles on an asymmetric substrate when a net dc transport is produced by an\nexternally applied ac driving force or by periodically flashing the substrate.\nRecently, a new class of active ratchet systems has been realized through the\nuse of active matter, which are self-propelled units that can be biological or\nnon-biological in nature. When active materials such as swimming bacteria\ninteract with an asymmetric substrate, a net dc directed motion can arise even\nwithout external driving, opening a wealth of possibilities such as sorting,\ncargo transport, or micromachine construction. We review the current status of\nactive matter ratchets for swimming bacteria, cells, active colloids, and\nswarming models, focusing on the role of particle-substrate interactions. We\ndescribe ratchet reversals produced by collective effects and the use of active\nratchets to transport passive particles. We discuss future directions including\ndeformable substrates or particles, the role of different swimming modes,\nvaried particle-particle interactions, and non-dissipative effects.\n", "  Miniaturization of force probes into nanomechanical oscillators enables\nultrasensitive investigations of forces on dimensions smaller than their\ncharacteristic length scale. Meanwhile it also unravels the force field\nvectorial character and how its topology impacts the measurement. Here we\nexpose an ultrasensitive method to image 2D vectorial force fields by\noptomechanically following the bidimensional Brownian motion of a singly\nclamped nanowire. This novel approach relies on angular and spectral tomography\nof its quasi frequency-degenerated transverse mechanical polarizations:\nimmersing the nanoresonator in a vectorial force field does not only shift its\neigenfrequencies but also rotate eigenmodes orientation as a nano-compass. This\nuniversal method is employed to map a tunable electrostatic force field whose\nspatial gradients can even take precedence over the intrinsic nanowire\nproperties. Enabling vectorial force fields imaging with demonstrated\nsensitivities of attonewton variations over the nanoprobe Brownian trajectory\nwill have strong impact on scientific exploration at the nanoscale.\n", "  We assemble a database of 15 HSB and 15 LSB galaxies, for which surface\nbrightness density and spectroscopic rotation curve data are both available and\nrepresentative for various morphologies. We use this dataset to test the\nNavarro-Frenk-White, the Einasto, and the pseudo-isothermal sphere dark matter\n(DM) models. We investigate the compatibility of the pure baryonic model and\nbaryonic plus one of the three DM models with observations on the assembled\ngalaxy database. When a DM component improves the fit with the spectroscopic\nrotational curve, we rank the models according to the goodness of fit to the\ndatasets. We constructed the spatial luminosity density of the baryonic\ncomponent based on the surface brightness profile of the galaxies. We estimated\nthe mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of the stellar component through a previously\nproposed color-mass-to-light ratio relation (CMLR). We assumed an axissymetric\nbaryonic mass model with variable axis ratios together with one of the three DM\nmodels to provide the theoretical rotational velocity curves, and we compared\nthem with the dataset. In a second attempt, we addressed the question whether\nthe dark component could be replaced by a pure baryonic model with fitted M/L\nratios. We employed the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to establish the\nperformance of the best-fit models. For 7 galaxies, neither model fits the\ndataset within the 1{\\sigma} confidence level. For the other 23 cases, one of\nthe models with DM explains the rotation curve data best. According to the AIC,\nthe PSE emerges as most favored in 14 cases, followed by the NFW (6 cases) and\nthe Einasto (3 cases) DM models. We find that the pure baryonic model with\nfitted M/L ratios falls within the 1{\\sigma} confidence level for 10 HSB and 2\nLSB galaxies, at the price of growing the M/Ls on average by a factor of two,\nbut the fits are inferior compared to the best-fitting DM model.\n", "  We propose a new scheme of producing intense neutron beam whose yields exceed\nthose of existing facilities by many orders of magnitude. This scheme uses the\nrecently proposed photon beam extracted from circulating quantum ions, which is\ndirected to a deuteron target for photo-disintegration. The calculated neutron\nenergy spectrum is nearly flat down to neV range, except a threshold rise and\nits adjacent wide structure. Hence, there exists a possibility of directly\nusing sub-eV neutrons without a moderator. We shall have brief comments on\npromising particle physics applications using this large yield of neutron.\n", "  We demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of spin-dependent diffraction and\nspin-polarization of an electron in two counter-propagating, circularly\npolarized laser beams. The spin-dynamics appears in a two-photon process of the\nKapitza-Dirac effect in the Bragg regime. We show the spin-dependence of the\ndiffraction process by comparison of the time-evolution of a spin-up and\nspin-down electron in a relativistic quantum simulation. We further discuss the\nspin properties of the scattering by studying an analytically approximated\nsolution of the time-evolution matrix. A classification scheme in terms of\nunitary or non-unitary propagation matrices is used for establishing a\ngeneralized and spin-independent description of the spin properties in the\ndiffraction process.\n", "  The low-gain free-electron laser (FEL) oscillators are cutting-edge tools to\nproduce fully coherent radiation in the spectral region from terahertz to\nvacuum ultraviolet, and potentially in hard X-ray. In this paper, it is\nproposed to utilize an FEL oscillator with multi-stage undulators to enable\ngain cascading in a single-pass, making it possible to achieve shorter single\npulse lengths, higher peak power, and even higher pulse energy than classical\nFEL oscillator. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations in the infrared\nand hard X-ray regions show that our proposal is effective.\n", "  Using a particle-based simulation model, we show that quenched disorder\ncreates a drive-dependent skyrmion Hall effect as measured by the change in the\nratio $R=V_{\\perp}/V_{||}$ of the skyrmion velocity perpendicular ($V_{\\perp}$)\nand parallel ($V_{||}$) to an external drive. $R$ is zero at depinning and\nincreases linearly with increasing drive, in agreement with recent experimental\nobservations. At sufficiently high drives where the skyrmions enter a free flow\nregime, $R$ saturates to the disorder-free limit. This behavior is robust for a\nwide range of disorder strengths and intrinsic Hall angle values, and occurs\nwhenever plastic flow is present. For systems with small intrinsic Hall angles,\nwe find that the Hall angle increases linearly with external drive, as also\nobserved in experiment. In the weak pinning regime where the skyrmion lattice\ndepins elastically, $R$ is nonlinear and the net direction of the skyrmion\nlattice motion can rotate as a function of external drive.\n", "  The energy of a particle moving on a spacetime, in principle, can affect the\nbackground metric. The modifications to it depend on the ratio of energy of the\nparticle and the Planck energy, known as rainbow gravity. Here we find the\nexplicit expressions for the coordinate transformations from rainbow Minkowski\nspacetime to accelerated frame. The corresponding metric is also obtained which\nwe call as rainbow-Rindler metric. So far we are aware of, no body has done it\nin a concrete manner. Here this is found from the first principle and hence all\nthe parameters are properly identified. The advantage of this is that the\ncalculated Unruh temperature is compatible with the Hawking temperature of the\nrainbow black hole horizon, obtained earlier. Since the accelerated frame has\nseveral importance in revealing various properties of gravity, we believe that\nthe present result will not only fill that gap, but also help to explore\ndifferent aspects of rainbow gravity paradigm.\n", "  We numerically examine driven skyrmions interacting with a periodic quasi-one\ndimensional substrate where the driving force is applied either parallel or\nperpendicular to the substrate periodicity direction. For perpendicular\ndriving, the particles in a purely overdamped system simply slide along the\nsubstrate minima; however, for skyrmions where the Magnus force is relevant, we\nfind that a rich variety of dynamics can arise. In the single skyrmion limit,\nthe skyrmion motion is locked along the driving or longitudinal direction for\nlow drives, while at higher drives a transition occurs to a state in which the\nskyrmion moves both transverse and longitudinal to the driving direction.\nWithin the longitudinally locked phase we find a pronounced speed up effect\nthat occurs when the Magnus force aligns with the external driving force, while\nat the transition to transverse and longitudinal motion, the skyrmion velocity\ndrops, producing negative differential conductivity. For collectively\ninteracting skyrmion assemblies, the speed up effect is still present and we\nobserve a number of distinct dynamical phases, including a sliding smectic\nphase, a disordered or moving liquid phase, a moving hexatic phase, and a\nmoving crystal phase. The transitions between the dynamic phases produce\ndistinct features in the structure of the skyrmion lattice and in the\nvelocity-force curves. We map these different phases as a function of the ratio\nof the Magnus term to the dissipative term, the substrate strength, the\ncommensurability ratio, and the magnitude of the driving force.\n", "  We point out that past-incompleteness of geodesics in FLRW spacetimes does\nnot necessarily imply that these spacetimes start from a singularity. Namely,\nif a test particle that follows such a trajectory has a non-vanishing velocity,\nits energy was super-Planckian at some time in the past if it kept following\nthat geodesic. That indicates a breakdown of the particle's description, which\nis why we should not consider those trajectories for the definition of an\ninitial singularity. When one only considers test particles that do not have\nthis breakdown of their trajectory, it turns out that the only singular FLRW\nspacetimes are the ones that have a scale parameter that vanishes at some\ninitial time.\n", "  This paper describes an undergraduate-level physics project that incorporates\nvarious aspects of machine- and electronics-shop technical development. The\ndesktop muon detector is a self-contained apparatus that employs plastic\nscintillator as a detection medium and a silicon photomultiplier for light\ncollection. These detectors can be used in conjunction with the provided\nsoftware to make interesting physics measurements. The total cost of each\ncounter is approximately $100.\n", "  The effective field theory of heterotic vacua that realise $\\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$\npreserving $\\mathcal{N} =1$ supersymmetry are studied. The vacua in question\nadmit large radius limits taking the form $\\mathbb{R}^{3,1}\\times {X}$ , with\n${X}$ a smooth three-fold with vanishing first Chern class and a stable\nholomorphic gauge bundle $\\mathcal{E}$. In a previous paper we calculated the\nkinetic terms for moduli, deducing the moduli metric and Kahler potential. In\nthis paper, we compute the remaining couplings in the effective field theory,\ncorrect to first order in alpha prime. In particular, we compute the\ncontribution of the matter sector to the Kahler potential, derive the Yukawa\ncouplings and other quadratic fermionic couplings. From this we write down a\nKahler potential $\\mathcal{K}$ and superpotential $\\mathcal{W}$ .\n", "  Using computer simulations, we study a two-dimensional system of sterically\ninteracting self-mobile run-and-tumble disk-shaped particles with an underlying\nperiodic quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric substrate, and show that a rich\nvariety of collective active ratchet behaviors arise as a function of particle\ndensity, activity, substrate strength, and substrate period. The ratchet\nefficiency is nonmonotonic since the ratcheting is enhanced by increased\nactivity but diminished by the onset of self-clustering of the active\nparticles. Increasing the particle density decreases the ratchet efficiency for\nweak substrates but increases the ratchet efficiency for strong substrates due\nto collective hopping events. At the highest particle densities, the ratchet\nmotion is destroyed by a self-jamming effect. We show that it is possible to\nrealize reversals of the ratchet effect, where the net flux of particles is\nalong the hard rather than the easy direction of the substrate asymmetry. The\nreversals occur in the strong substrate limit when multiple rows of active\nparticles can be confined in each substrate minimum, permitting emergent\nparticle-like excitations to appear that experience an inverted effective\nsubstrate potential. We map out a phase diagram of the forward and reverse\nratchet effects as a function of the particle density, activity, and substrate\nproperties.\n", "  By numerically studying non-Abelian quantum turbulence, we find that the\nhelicity cascade and the inverse energy cascade are topologically protected\nagainst reconnection of vortices and lead to the energy spectrum $E(k) \\propto\nk^{-7/3}$ for a large-scale energy injection and $E(k) \\propto k^{-5/3}$ for a\nsmall-scale energy injection with a large-scale web of non-Abelian vortices.\nOur prediction can be tested in the cyclic phase of a spin-2 spinor\nBose-Einstein condensate.\n", "  We prove that generic quantum local Hamiltonians are gapless. In fact, we\nprove that there is a continuous density of states above the ground state. The\nHamiltonian can be on a lattice in any spatial dimension or on a graph with a\nbounded maximum vertex degree. The type of interactions allowed for include\ntranslational invariance in a disorder (i.e., probabilistic) sense with some\nassumptions on the local distributions. Examples include many-body localization\nand random spin models. We calculate the scaling of the gap with the system's\nsize when the local terms are distributed according to a Gaussian\n$\\beta-$orthogonal random matrix ensemble. As a corollary there exist finite\nsize partitions with respect to which the ground state is arbitrarily close to\na product state. When the local eigenvalue distribution is discrete, in\naddition to the lack of an energy gap in the limit, we prove that the ground\nstate has finite size degeneracies. The proofs are simple and constructive.\nThis work excludes the important class of truly translationally invariant\nHamiltonians where the local terms are all equal.\n", "  Topological properties of crystals and quasicrystals is a subject of recent\nand growing interest. This Letter reports an experiment where, for certain\nquasicrystals, these properties can be directly retrieved from diffraction. We\ndirectly observe, using an interferometric approach, all the topological\ninvariants of finite-length Fibonacci chains in their diffraction pattern. We\nalso demonstrate quantitatively the stability of these topological invariants\nwith respect to structural disorder.\n", "  In this paper we show that integrable four dimensional linearly degenerate\nequations of second order possess infinitely many three dimensional\nhydrodynamic reductions. Furthermore, they are equipped infinitely many\nconservation laws and higher commuting flows. We show that the dispersionless\nlimits of nonlocal KdV and nonlocal NLS equations (the so-called Breaking\nSoliton equations introduced by O.I. Bogoyavlenski) are one and two component\nreductions (respectively) of one of these four dimensional linearly degenerate\nequations.\n", "  We illustrate possible topological phases in honeycomb lattice with textures\nin electron hopping energy between nearest-neighboring sites and show that they\nare characterized by the mirror winding number intimately related to the chiral\n(or sublattice) symmetry. Analytic wave functions of zero-energy edge modes in\nribbon geometry are provided, which are classified into even and odd sectors\nwith respect to the mirror operation with the mirror plane perpendicular to the\nedge, and evolve into the topological helical edge states at finite momenta.\nIntriguingly our results demonstrate that in order to achieve the topological\nphase one can decorate the edge in a way adaptive to the bulk hopping texture.\nThis paves a new way to tailoring graphene in the topological point of view.\n", "  Let $(\\mathcal{M}^{3+1},g)$ be a real analytic, stationary and asymptotically\nflat spacetime with a non-empty ergoregion $\\mathscr{E}$ and no future event\nhorizon $\\mathcal{H}^{+}$. On such spacetimes, Friedman provided a heuristic\nargument that the energy of certain solutions $\\phi$ of $\\square_{g}\\phi=0$\ngrows to $+\\infty$ as time increases. In this paper, we provide a rigorous\nproof of Friedman's instability. Our setting is, in fact, more general. We\nconsider smooth spacetimes $(\\mathcal{M}^{d+1},g)$, for any $d\\ge2$, not\nnecessarily globally real analytic. We impose only a unique continuation\ncondition for the wave equation across the boundary $\\partial\\mathscr{E}$ of\n$\\mathscr{E}$ on a small neighborhood of a point $p\\in\\partial\\mathscr{E}$.\nThis condition always holds if $(\\mathcal{M},g)$ is analytic in that\nneighborhood of $p$, but it can also be inferred in the case when\n$(\\mathcal{M},g)$ possesses a second Killing field $\\Phi$ such that the span of\n$\\Phi$ and the stationary Killing field $T$ is timelike on\n$\\partial\\mathscr{E}$. We also allow the spacetimes $(\\mathcal{M},g)$ under\nconsideration to possess a (possibly empty) future event horizon\n$\\mathcal{H}^{+}$, such that, however,\n$\\mathcal{H}^{+}\\cap\\mathscr{E}=\\emptyset$ (excluding, thus, the Kerr exterior\nfamily). As an application of our theorem, we infer an instability result for\nthe acoustical wave equation on the hydrodynamic vortex, a phenomenon first\ninvestigated numerically by Oliveira, Cardoso and Crispino. Furthermore, as a\nside benefit of our proof, we provide a derivation, based entirely on the\nvector field method, of a Carleman-type estimate on the exterior of the\nergoregion for a general class of stationary and asymptotically flat\nspacetimes.\n", "  We carry out numerical evaluations of the motion of classical particles in\nMinkowski Space $\\mathbb{M}^{4}$ which are confined to the inside of a bag. In\nparticular, we analyze the structure of the paths evolving from the breaking of\nthe dilatation symmetry, the conformal symmetry and the combination of both\ntogether. The confining forces arise directly from the corresponding\nnonconserved currents. We demonstrate in our evaluations that these particles\nunder certain initial conditions move toward the interior of the bag.\n", "  We show that sterically interacting self-propelled disks in the presence of\nrandom pinning substrates exhibit transitions among a variety of different\nstates. In particular, from a phase separated cluster state, the disks can\nspread out and homogeneously cover the substrate in what can be viewed as an\nexample of an active matter wetting transition. We map the location of this\ntransition as a function of activity, disk density, and substrate strength, and\nwe also identify other phases including a cluster state, coexistence between a\ncluster and a labyrinth wetted phase, and a pinned liquid. These phases can be\nidentified using the cluster size, which dips at the wetting-dewetting\ntransition, and the fraction of sixfold coordinated particles, which drops when\ndewetting occurs.\n", "  Using numerical simulations, we study the dynamical evolution of particles\ninteracting via competing long-range repulsion and short-range attraction in\ntwo dimensions. The particles are compressed using a time-dependent quasi-one\ndimensional trough potential that controls the local density, causing the\nsystem to undergo a series of structural phase transitions from a low density\nclump lattice to stripes, voids, and a high density uniform state. The\ncompression proceeds via slow elastic motion that is interrupted with\navalanche-like bursts of activity as the system collapses to progressively\nhigher densities via plastic rearrangements. The plastic events vary in\nmagnitude from small rearrangements of particles, including the formation of\nquadrupole-like defects, to large-scale vorticity and structural phase\ntransitions. In the dense uniform phase, the system compresses through row\nreduction transitions mediated by a disorder-order process. We characterize the\nrearrangement events by measuring changes in the potential energy, the fraction\nof sixfold coordinated particles, the local density, and the velocity\ndistribution. At high confinements, we find power law scaling of the velocity\ndistribution during row reduction transitions. We observe hysteresis under a\nreversal of the compression when relatively few plastic rearrangements occur.\nThe decompressing system exhibits distinct phase morphologies, and the phase\ntransitions occur at lower compression forces as the system expands compared to\nwhen it is compressed.\n", "  The stabilizer group of an n-qubit state \\psi is the set of all matrices of\nthe form g=g_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes g_n, with g_1,...,g_n being any 2x2\ninvertible complex matrices, that satisfy g\\psi=\\psi. We show that for 5 or\nmore qubits, except for a set of states of zero measure, the stabilizer group\nof multipartite entangled states is trivial; that is, containing only the\nidentity element. We use this result to show that for 5 or more qubits, the\naction of deterministic local operations and classical communication (LOCC) can\nalmost always be simulated simply by local unitary (LU) operations. This proves\nthat almost all n-qubit states with n>4 are isolated, that is they can neither\nbe reached nor converted into any other (n-partite entangled), LU-inequivalent\nstate via deterministic LOCC. We also find a simple and elegant expression for\nthe maximal probability to convert one multi-qubit entangled state to another\nfor this generic set of states.\n", "  We demonstrate the use of an external field to stabilize and control defect\nlines connecting topological monopoles in spin ice. For definiteness we perform\nBrownian dynamics simulations with realistic units mimicking experimentally\nrealized artificial colloidal spin ice systems, and show how defect lines can\ngrow, shrink or move under the action of direct and alternating fields.\nAsymmetric alternating biasing fields can cause the defect line to ratchet in\neither direction, making it possible to precisely position the line at a\ndesired location. Such manipulation could be employed to achieve fast, dense,\nand mobile information storage in these metamaterials.\n", "  The present work discusses motion of neutral and charged particles in\nReissner - Nordstrom spacetime. The constant energy paths are derived in a\nvariational principle framework using the Jacobi metric which is parameterized\nby conserved particle energy. Of particular interest is the case of particle\ncharge and Reissner-Nordstrom black hole charge being of same sign since this\nleads to a clash of opposing forces - gravitational (attractive) and Coulomb\n(repulsive). Our paper aims to compliment the recent works of Pugliese, Quevedo\nand Ruffini [1,2]. The energy dependent Gaussian curvature (induced by Jacobi\nmetric), plays an important role in classifying the trajectories.\n", "  The asymptotic form of the average probability to count $N$ indistinguishable\nidentical particles in a small number $r \\ll N$ of binned-together output ports\nof a $M$-port Haar-random unitary network, proposed recently in\n\\textit{Scientific Reports} \\textbf{7}, 31 (2017) in a heuristic manner with\nsome numerical confirmation, is presented with the mathematical rigor and\ngeneralized to an arbitrary (mixed) input state of $N$ indistinguishable\nparticles. It is shown that, both in the classical (distinguishable particles)\nand quantum (indistinguishable particles) cases, the average counting\nprobability into $r$ output bins factorizes into a product of $r-1$ counting\nprobabilities into two bins. This fact relates the asymptotic Gaussian law to\nthe de Moivre-Laplace theorem in the classical case and similarly in the\nquantum case where an analogous theorem can be stated. The results have\napplications to the setups where randomness plays a key role, such as the\nmultiphoton propagation in disordered media and the scattershot Boson Sampling.\n", "  The simplest variant of gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan spacetime\nleading to the solution of the problem of cosmological singularity and dark\nenergy problem is investigated. It is shown that this theory by certain\nrestrictions on indefinite parameters of gravitational Lagrangian in the case\nof usual gravitating systems leads to Einstein gravitational equations with\neffective cosmological constant.\n", "  Previous experimental tests of quantum contextuality based on the\nBell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem have demonstrated that not all observables\namong a given set can be assigned noncontextual eigenvalue predictions, but\nhave never identified which specific observables must fail such assignment. We\nnow remedy this shortcoming by showing that BKS contextuality can be confined\nto particular observables by pre- and postselection, resulting in anomalous\nweak values that we measure using modern neutron interferometry. We construct a\nconfined contextuality witness from weak values, which we measure\nexperimentally to obtain a $5\\sigma$ average violation of the noncontextual\nbound, with one contributing term violating an independent bound by more than\n$99\\sigma$. This weakly measured confined BKS contextuality also confirms the\nquantum pigeonhole effect, wherein eigenvalue assignments to contextual\nobservables apparently violate the classical pigeonhole principle.\n", "  We study observables on monotone $\\sigma$-complete effect algebras. We find\nconditions when a spectral resolution implies existence of the corresponding\nobservable. The set of sharp elements of a monotone $\\sigma$-complete\nhomogeneous effect algebra is a monotone $\\sigma$-complete subalgebra. In\naddition, we study compatibility in orthoalgebras.\n", "  We present a general framework for accurate spectral modeling of the low\nmultipoles of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as observed in a boosted\nframe. In particular, we demonstrate how spectral measurements of the low\nmultipoles can be used to separate the motion-induced dipole of the CMB from a\npossible intrinsic dipole component. In a moving frame, the leakage of an\nintrinsic dipole moment into the CMB monopole and quadrupole induces spectral\ndistortions with distinct frequency functions that respectively peak at 337 GHz\nand 276 GHz. The leakage into the quadrupole moment also induces a geometrical\ndistortion to the spatial morphology of this mode. The combination of these\neffects can be used to lift the degeneracy between the motion-induced dipole\nand any intrinsic dipole that the CMB might possess. Assuming the current\npeculiar velocity measurements, the leakage of an intrinsic dipole with an\namplitude of $\\Delta T = 30\\mu$K into the monopole and quadrupole moments will\nbe detectable by a PIXIE--like experiment at $\\sim 40~$nK ($2.5\\sigma$) and\n$\\sim 130~$nK ($11\\sigma$) level at their respective peak frequencies.\n", "  The extraordinary multi-TeV flare from 1ES 1011 +496 during February-March\n2014 was observed by MAGIC telescopes for 17 nights and the average spectrum of\nthe whole period has a non-trivial shape. We have used the photohadronic model\nand a template EBL model to explain the average spectrum which fits well to the\nflare data. The spectral index $\\alpha$ is the only free parameter in our\nmodel. We have also shown that the non-trivial nature of the spectrum is due to\nthe change in the behavior of the optical depth above $\\sim 600$ GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray energy accompanied with the high SSC flux.\n", "  The CHErenkov / Scintillation Separation experiment (CHESS) has been used to\ndemonstrate the separation of Cherenkov and scintillation light in both linear\nalkylbenzene (LAB) and LAB with 2g/L of PPO as a fluor (LAB/PPO). This is the\nfirst such demonstration for the more challenging LAB/PPO cocktail and improves\non previous results for LAB. A time resolution of 338 +/- 12 ps FWHM results in\nan efficiency for identifying Cherenkov photons in LAB/PPO of 70 +/- 3% and 63\n+/- 8% for time- and charge-based separation, respectively, with scintillation\ncontamination of 36 +/- 5% and 38 +/- 4%. LAB/PPO data is consistent with a\nrise time of 0.75 +/- 0.25 ns.\n", "  We present a high precision H-band emission spectrum of the transiting brown\ndwarf KELT-1b, which we spectrophotometrically observed during a single\nsecondary eclipse using the LUCI1 multi-object spectrograph on the Large\nBinocular Telescope. Using a Gaussian-process regression model, we are able to\nclearly measure the broadband eclipse depth as Delta-H=1418+/-94ppm. We are\nalso able to spectrally-resolve the H-band into five separate wavechannels and\nmeasure the eclipse spectrum of KELT-1b at R~50 with an average precision of\n+/-135ppm. We find that the day side has an average brightness temperature of\n3250+/-50K, with significant variation as a function of wavelength. Based on\nour observations, and previous measurements of KELT-1b's eclipse at other\nwavelengths, we find that KELT-1b's day side appears identical to an isolated\n3200K brown dwarf, and our modeling of the atmospheric emission shows a\nmonotonically decreasing temperature-pressure profile. This is in contrast to\nhot Jupiters with similar day side brightness temperatures near 3000K, all of\nwhich appear to be either isothermal or posses a stratospheric temperature\ninversion. We hypothesize that the lack of an inversion in KELT-1b is due to\nits high surface gravity, which we argue could be caused by the increased\nefficiency of cold-trap processes within its atmosphere.\n", "  We investigate the statistical arrow of time for a quantum system being\nmonitored by a sequence of measurements. For a continuous qubit measurement\nexample, we demonstrate that time-reversed evolution is always physically\npossible, provided that the measurement record is also negated. Despite this\nrestoration of dynamical reversibility, a statistical arrow of time emerges,\nand may be quantified by the log-likelihood difference between forward and\nbackward propagation hypotheses. We then show that such reversibility is a\nuniversal feature of non-projective measurements, with forward or backward\nJanus measurement sequences that are time-reversed inverses of each other.\n", "  A generalized Hermitian (GH-) algebra is a generalization of the partially\nordered Jordan algebra of all Hermitian operators on a Hilbert space. We\nintroduce the notion of a gh-tribe, which is a commutative GH-algebra of\nfunctions on a nonempty set $X$ with pointwise partial order and operations,\nand we prove that every commutative GH-algebra is the image of a gh-tribe under\na surjective GH-morphism. Using this result, we prove each element $a$ of a\nGH-algebra $A$ corresponds to a real observable $\\xi_a$ on the\n$\\sigma$-orthomodular lattice of projections in $A$ and that $\\xi_a$ determines\nthe spectral resolution of $a$. Also, if $f$ is a continuous function defined\non the spectrum of $a$, we formulate a definition of $f(a)$, thus obtaining a\ncontinuous functional calculus for $A$.\n", "  An SU(1,1) interferometer replaces the beamsplitters in a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer with nonlinear interactions and offers the potential of\nachieving high phase sensitivity in applications with low optical powers. We\npresent a novel variation in which the second nonlinear interaction is replaced\nwith balanced homodyne detection. The phase-sensing quantum state is a two-mode\nsqueezed state produced by seeded four-wave-mixing in Rb vapor. Measurements as\na function of operating point show that even with $\\approx35~\\%$ loss this\ndevice can surpass the standard quantum limit by 4~dB.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions between\ntwo-dimensional Dirac semimetals and $Z_3$-ordered phases (e.g. Kekule\nvalence-bond solid), where cubic terms of the order parameter are allowed in\nthe quantum Landau-Ginzberg theory and the transitions are putatively\nfirst-order. From large-$N$ renormalization group (RG) analysis, we find that\nfermion-induced quantum critical points (FIQCPs) [Z.-X. Li et al., Nature\nCommunications 8, 314 (2017)] occur when $N$ (the number of flavors of\nfour-component Dirac fermions) is larger than a critical value $N_c$.\nRemarkably, from the knowledge of spacetime supersymmetry, we obtain an exact\nlower bound for $N_c$, i.e., $N_c>1/2$. (Here the \"1/2\" flavor of\nfour-component Dirac fermions is equivalent to one flavor of four-component\nMajorana fermions). Moreover, we show that the emergence of two length scales\nis a typical phenomenon of FIQCPs and obtain two different critical exponents,\ni.e., $\\nu$$\\neq$$\\nu'$, by large-$N$ RG calculations. We further give a brief\ndiscussion on possible experimental realizations of FIQCPs.\n", "  We characterize surface-plasmon polaritons at lossy planar interfaces between\none dispersive and one nondispersive linear isotropic homogeneous media, i.e.,\nmaterials or metamaterials. Specifically we solve Maxwell's equations to obtain\nstrict bounds for the permittivity and permeability of these media such that\nsatisfying these bounds implies surface-plasmon polaritons successfully\npropagate at the interface, and violation of the bounds impedes propagation,\ni.e., the field delocalizes from the surface into the bulk. Our\ncharacterization of surface-plasmon polaritons is valuable for checking\nviability of a proposed application, and, as an example, we employ our method\nto falsify a previous prediction that surface-plasmon propagation through a\nsurface of a double-negative refractive index medium occurs for any\npermittivity and permeability; instead we show that propagation can occur only\nfor certain medium parameters.\n", "  We review the reduction of four-dimensional N=1 Seiberg duality to three\ndimensions focusing on the D brane engineering approach. We start with an\noverview of four-dimensional Seiberg duality for theories with various types of\ngauge groups and matter content both from a field-theoretic and a brane\nengineering point of view. Then we describe two families of N=2\nthree-dimensional dualities, namely Giveon-Kutasov-like and Aharony-like\ndualities. The last part of our discussion is devoted to the 4D/3D reduction of\nthe dualities studied above. We discuss both the analysis at finite radius,\ncrucial for preserving the duality in the dimensional reduction, and the\nzero-size limit that must be supported by a real mass flow and a Higgsing,\nwhich can differ case by case. We show that this mechanism is reproduced in the\nbrane description by T-duality, supplying a unified picture for all the\ndifferent cases. As a bonus we show that this analysis provides a brane\ndescription for Aharony-like dualities.\n", "  We study an interesting region of phase space at the LHC for pair-produced\nstops decaying into hadronic top quarks and light neutralinos. After imposing a\nsizeable cut on the missing transverse energy, which is the key variable for\nreducing backgrounds, we have found that the two hadronic tops are likely to\nmerge into a single fat jet. We develop a jet-substructure-based strategy to\ntag the two merged top-jets and utilize the MT2 variable to further reduce the\nbackgrounds. We obtain about a 50% increase to the ratio of the signal over\nbackground and a mild increase on the signal discovery significance, based on a\nsignal with a 1.2 TeV stop and a 100 GeV neutralino, for the 13 TeV LHC with\n100 fb$^{-1}$. The general event kinematics could also occur and be explored\nfor other new physics signatures with large missing transverse energy.\n", "  We consider the critical behaviour of long-range $O(n)$ models ($n \\ge 0$) on\n${\\mathbb Z}^d$, with interaction that decays with distance $r$ as\n$r^{-(d+\\alpha)}$, for $\\alpha \\in (0,2)$. For $n \\ge 1$, we study the\n$n$-component $|\\varphi|^4$ lattice spin model. For $n =0$, we study the weakly\nself-avoiding walk via an exact representation as a supersymmetric spin model.\nThese models have upper critical dimension $d_c=2\\alpha$. For dimensions\n$d=1,2,3$ and small $\\epsilon>0$, we choose $\\alpha = \\frac 12 (d+\\epsilon)$,\nso that $d=d_c-\\epsilon$ is below the upper critical dimension. For small\n$\\epsilon$ and weak coupling, to order $\\epsilon$ we prove existence of and\ncompute the values of the critical exponent $\\gamma$ for the susceptibility\n(for $n \\ge 0$) and the critical exponent $\\alpha_H$ for the specific heat (for\n$n \\ge 1$). For the susceptibility, $\\gamma = 1 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8} \\frac\n\\epsilon\\alpha + O(\\epsilon^2)$, and a similar result is proved for the\nspecific heat. Expansion in $\\epsilon$ for such long-range models was first\ncarried out in the physics literature in 1972. Our proof adapts and applies a\nrigorous renormalisation group method developed in previous papers with\nBauerschmidt and Brydges for the nearest-neighbour models in the critical\ndimension $d=4$, and is based on the construction of a non-Gaussian\nrenormalisation group fixed point. Some aspects of the method simplify below\nthe upper critical dimension, while some require different treatment, and new\nideas and techniques with potential future application are introduced.\n", "  The propulsion type plasma in oblique external magnetic field is studied in\n2D3V PIC MCC simulations. A periodical structure with maxima of electron and\nion densities appears with an increase of an obliqueness of magnetic field.\nThese ridges of electron and ion densities are aligned with the magnetic field\nvector and shifted relative each other. As a result the two-dimensional\ndouble-layers structure forms in cylindrical plasma chamber. The ion and\nelectron currents on the side wall are essential modulated by the oblique\nmagnetic field.\n", "  The vicinity of a Mott insulating phase has constantly been a fertile ground\nfor finding exotic quantum states, most notably the high Tc cuprates and\ncolossal magnetoresistance manganites. The layered transition metal\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS2 represents another intriguing example, in which the Mott\ninsulator phase is intimately entangled with a series of complex\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) orders. More interestingly, it has been recently\nfound that 1T-TaS2 undergoes a Mott-insulator-to-superconductor transition\ninduced by high pressure, charge doping, or isovalent substitution. The nature\nof the Mott insulator phase and transition mechanism to the conducting state is\nstill under heated debate. Here, by combining scanning tunneling microscopy\n(STM) measurements and first-principles calculations, we investigate the atomic\nscale electronic structure of 1T-TaS2 Mott insulator and its evolution to the\nmetallic state upon isovalent substitution of S with Se. We identify two\ndistinct types of orbital textures - one localized and the other extended - and\ndemonstrates that the interplay between them is the key factor that determines\nthe electronic structure. Especially, we show that the continuous evolution of\nthe charge gap visualized by STM is due to the immersion of the\nlocalized-orbital-induced Hubbard bands into the extended-orbital-spanned Fermi\nsea, featuring a unique evolution from a Mott gap to a charge-transfer gap.\nThis new mechanism of orbital-driven Mottness collapse revealed here suggests\nan interesting route for creating novel electronic state and designing future\nelectronic devices.\n", "  We consider effective Higgs boson couplings, including both the CP-even and\nCP-odd couplings, that affect Higgs boson pair production in this study.\nThrough the partial wave analysis, we find that the process $gg\\to hh$ is\ndominated by the $s$-wave component even at a 100~TeV $pp$-collider. Making use\nof the $s$-wave kinematics, we propose a cut efficiency function to mimic the\ncollider simulation and obtain the potential of measuring Higgs effective\ncouplings at the 14~TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of $3000~{\\rm\nfb}^{-1}$ and at a 100 TeV $pp$-collider. Analytical expressions of the\n$2\\sigma$ exclusion limits at the LHC and the $5\\sigma$ discovery bands at the\n100 TeV machine are given.\n", "  In a recent paper, Liu, Zhu & Wu (2015, J. Fluid Mech. 784: 304; LZW for\nshort) present a far-field theory for the aerodynamic force experienced by a\nbody in a two-dimensional, viscous, compressible and steady flow. In this\ncompanion theoretical paper we do the same for three-dimensional flow. By a\nrigorous fundamental solution method of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations,\nwe not only improve the far-field force formula for incompressible flow\noriginally derived by Goldstein in 1931 and summarized by Milne-Thomson in\n1968, both being far from complete, to its perfect final form, but also prove\nthat this final form holds universally true in a wide range of compressible\nflow, from subsonic to supersonic flows. We call this result the unified force\ntheorem (UF theorem for short) and state it as a theorem, which is exactly the\ncounterpart of the two-dimensional compressible Joukowski-Filon theorem\nobtained by LZW. Thus, the steady lift and drag are always exactly determined\nby the values of vector circulation $\\Gamma_\\phi$ due to the longitudinal\nvelocity and inflow $Q_\\psi$ due to the transversal velocity, respectively, no\nmatter how complicated the near-field viscous flow surrounding the body might\nbe. However, velocity potentials are not directly observable either\nexperimentally or computationally, and hence neither is the UF theorem. Thus, a\ntestable version of it is also derived, which holds only in the linear far\nfield and is exactly the counterpart of the testable compressible\nJoukowski-Filon formula in two dimensions. We call it the testable unified\nforce formula (TUF formula for short). Due to its linear dependence on the\nvorticity, TUF formula is also valid for statistically stationary flow,\nincluding time-averaged turbulent flow.\n", "  This article reviews our current understanding of how the internal quark\nstructure of a nucleon bound in nuclei differs from that of a free nucleon. We\nfocus on the interpretation of measurements of the EMC effect for valence\nquarks, a reduction in the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) cross-section ratios\nfor nuclei relative to deuterium, and its possible connection to\nnucleon-nucleon Short-Range Correlations (SRC) in nuclei. Our review and new\nanalysis (involving the amplitudes of non-nucleonic configurations in the\nnucleus) of the available experimental and theoretical evidence shows that\nthere is a phenomenological relation between the EMC effect and the effects of\nSRC that is not an accident. The influence of strongly correlated\nneutron-proton pairs involving highly virtual nucleons is responsible for both\neffects. These correlated pairs are temporary high-density fluctuations in the\nnucleus in which the internal structure of the nucleons is briefly modified.\nThis conclusion needs to be solidified by the future experiments and improved\ntheoretical analyses that are discussed herein.\n", "  Blazars exhibit flares across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Many\n$\\gamma$-ray flares are highly correlated with flares detected at longer\nwavelengths; however, a small subset appears to occur in isolation, with little\nor no correlated variability at longer wavelengths. These \"orphan\" $\\gamma$-ray\nflares challenge current models of blazar variability, most of which are unable\nto reproduce this type of behavior. Macdonald et al. have developed the Ring of\nFire model to explain the origin of orphan $\\gamma$-ray flares from within\nblazar jets. In this model, electrons contained within a blob of plasma moving\nrelativistically along the spine of the jet inverse-Compton scatter synchrotron\nphotons emanating off of a ring of shocked sheath plasma that enshrouds the jet\nspine. As the blob propagates through the ring, the scattering of the ring\nphotons by the blob electrons creates an orphan $\\gamma$-ray flare. This model\nwas successfully applied to modeling a prominent orphan $\\gamma$-ray flare\nobserved in the blazar PKS 1510$-$089. To further support the plausibility of\nthis model, Macdonald et al. presented a stacked radio map of PKS 1510$-$089\ncontaining the polarimetric signature of a sheath of plasma surrounding the\nspine of the jet. In this paper, we extend our modeling and stacking techniques\nto a larger sample of blazars: 3C 273, 4C 71$.$01, 3C 279, 1055$+$018, CTA 102,\nand 3C 345, the majority of which have exhibited orphan $\\gamma$-ray flares. We\nfind that the model can successfully reproduce these flares, while our stacked\nmaps reveal the existence of jet sheaths within these blazars.\n", "  We consider the problem of estimating the temperature $ T $ of a very cold\nequilibrium sample. The temperature estimates are drawn from measurements\nperformed on a quantum probe strongly coupled to it. We model this scenario by\nresorting to the canonical Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian and find analytically\nthe exact stationary state of the probe for arbitrary coupling strength. In\ngeneral, the probe does not reach thermal equilibrium with the sample, due to\ntheir non-perturbative interaction. We argue that this is advantageous for low\ntemperature thermometry, as we show in our model that: (i) The thermometric\nprecision at low $ T $ can be significantly enhanced by strengthening the\nprobe-sampling coupling, (ii) the variance of a suitable quadrature of our\nBrownian thermometer can yield temperature estimates with nearly minimal\nstatistical uncertainty, and (iii) the spectral density of the probe-sample\ncoupling may be engineered to further improve thermometric performance. These\nobservations may find applications in practical nanoscale thermometry at low\ntemperatures---a regime which is particularly relevant to quantum technologies.\n", "  Matrix Product States (MPS) are used for the simulation of the real-time\ndynamics induced by an electric quench on the vacuum state of the massive\nSchwinger model. For small quenches it is found that the obtained oscillatory\nbehavior of local observables can be explained from the single-particle\nexcitations of the quenched Hamiltonian. For large quenches damped oscillations\nare found and comparison of the late time behavior with the appropriate Gibbs\nstates seems to give some evidence for the onset of thermalization. Finally,\nthe MPS real-time simulations are explicitly compared with the semi-classical\napproach and, as expected, agreement is found in the limit of large quenches.\n", "  We classify integrable scalar polynomial partial differential equations of\nsecond order generalizing the short pulse equation.\n", "  We show that the rotation algebras are limit of matrix algebras in a very\nstrong sense of convergence for algebras with additional Lipschitz structure.\nOur results generalize to higher dimensional noncommutative tori and operator\nvalued coefficients. In contrast to previous results by Rieffel, Li, Kerr, and\nLatr\\'emoli\\`ere we use Lipschitz norms induced by the `carr\\'e du champ' of\ncertain natural dynamical systems, including the heat semigroup.\n", "  We describe the defect operator interpretation of the supersymmetric Renyi\nentropies of superconformal field theories in three, four and five dimensions.\nThe operators involved are supersymmetric codimension-two defects in an\nauxiliary Z_n gauge theory coupled to n copies of the SCFT. We compute the\nexact expectation values of such operators using localization, and compare the\nresults to the supersymmetric Renyi entropy. The agreement between the two\nimplies a relationship between the partition function on a squashed sphere and\nthe one on a round sphere in the presence of defects.\n", "  A subnanosecond breakdown in high-voltage pulse discharge is studied in\nexperiment and in kinetic simulations for mid-high pressure in helium. It is\nshown that the characteristic time of the current growth can be controlled by\nthe secondary electron emission. We test the influence of secondary electron\nyield on plasma parameters for three types of cathodes made from titanium,\nsilicon carbide and CuAlMg-alloy. By changing the pulse voltage amplitude and\ngas pressure, the area of existence of subnanosecond breakdown is identified.\n", "  Quantum systems out of equilibrium are presently a subject of active\nresearch, both in theoretical and experimental domains. In this work we\nconsider time-periodically modulated quantum systems which are in contact with\na stationary environment. Within the framework of a quantum master equation,\nthe asymptotic states of such systems are described by time-periodic density\noperators. Resolution of these operators constitutes a non-trivial\ncomputational task. To go beyond the current size limits, we use the quantum\ntrajectory method which unravels master equation for the density operator into\na set of stochastic processes for wave functions. The asymptotic density matrix\nis calculated by performing a statistical sampling over the ensemble of quantum\ntrajectories, preceded by a long transient propagation. We follow the ideology\nof event-driven programming and construct a new algorithmic realization of the\nmethod. The algorithm is computationally efficient, allowing for long 'leaps'\nforward in time, and is numerically exact in the sense that, being given the\nlist of uniformly distributed (on the unit interval) random numbers, $\\{\\eta_1,\n\\eta_2,...,\\eta_n\\}$, one could propagate a quantum trajectory (with $\\eta_i$'s\nas norm thresholds) in a numerically exact way. %Since the quantum trajectory\nmethod falls into the class of standard sampling problems, performance of the\nalgorithm %can be substantially improved by implementing it on a computer\ncluster. By using a scalable $N$-particle quantum model, we demonstrate that\nthe algorithm allows us to resolve the asymptotic density operator of the model\nsystem with $N = 2000$ states on a regular-size computer cluster, thus reaching\nthe scale on which numerical studies of modulated Hamiltonian systems are\ncurrently performed.\n", "  We are interested in thermalization in the D1D5 CFT, since this process is\nexpected to be dual to black hole formation. We expect that the lowest order\nprocess where thermalization occurs will be at second order in the perturbation\nthat moves us away from the orbifold point. The operator governing the\ndeformation off of the orbifold point consists of a twist operator combined\nwith a supercharge operator acting on this twist. In a previous paper we\ncomputed the action of two twist operators on an arbitrary state of the CFT. In\nthe present work we compute the action of the supercharges on these twist\noperators, thereby obtaining the full action of two deformation operators on an\narbitrary state of the CFT. We show that the full amplitude can be related to\nthe amplitude with just the twists through an action of the supercharge\noperators on the initial and final states. The essential part of this\ncomputation consists of moving the contours from the twist operators to the\ninitial and final states; to do this one must first map the amplitude to a\ncovering space where the twists are removed, and then map back to the original\nspace on which the CFT is defined.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the cohering and decohering power for the\none-qubit Markovian channels with respect to coherence in terms of the\n$l_{1}$-norm, the R$\\acute{e}$nyi $\\alpha$-relative entropy and the Tsallis\n$\\alpha$-relative entropy. In the case of $\\alpha=2$, the cohering and\ndecohering power of the amplitude damping channel, the phase damping channel,\nthe depolarizing channel, and the flip channels under the three measures of\ncoherence are calculated analytically. The decohering power on the $x, y, z$\nbasis referring to the amplitude damping channel, the phase damping channel,\nthe flip channel for every measure we investigated is equal. This property also\nhappens in the cohering power of the phase damping channel, the depolarizing\nchannel, and the flip channels. However, the decohering power of the\ndepolarizing channel is independent to the reference basis, and the cohering\npower of the amplitude damping channel on the $x, y$ basis is different to that\non the $z$ basis.\n", "  We carry out a joint analysis of redshift-space distortions and galaxy-galaxy\nlensing, with the aim of measuring the growth rate of structure; this is a key\nquantity for understanding the nature of gravity on cosmological scales and\nlate-time cosmic acceleration. We make use of the final VIPERS redshift survey\ndataset, which maps a portion of the Universe at a redshift of $z \\simeq 0.8$,\nand the lensing data from the CFHTLenS survey over the same area of the sky. We\nbuild a consistent theoretical model that combines non-linear galaxy biasing\nand redshift-space distortion models, and confront it with observations. The\ntwo probes are combined in a Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis to determine\nthe growth rate of structure at two redshifts $z=0.6$ and $z=0.86$. We obtain\nmeasurements of $f\\sigma_8(0.6) = 0.48 \\pm 0.12$ and $f\\sigma_8(0.86) = 0.48\n\\pm 0.10$. The additional galaxy-galaxylensing constraint alleviates galaxy\nbias and $\\sigma_8$ degeneracies, providing direct measurements of\n$[f(0.6),\\sigma_8(0.6)] = [0.93 \\pm 0.22, 0.52 \\pm 0.06]$ and\n$f(0.86),\\sigma_8(0.86)] = [0.99 \\pm 0.19, 0.48 \\pm 0.04]$. These measurements\nare statistically consistent with a Universe where the gravitational\ninteractions can be described by General Relativity, although they are not yet\naccurate enough to rule out some commonly considered alternatives. Finally, as\na complementary test we measure the gravitational slip parameter, $E_G$ , for\nthe first time at $z>0.6$. We find values of $\\smash{\\overline{E}_G}(0.6) =\n0.16 \\pm 0.09$ and $\\smash{\\overline{E}_G}(0.86) = 0.09 \\pm 0.07$, when $E_G$\nis averaged over scales above $3 h^{-1} \\rm{Mpc}$. We find that our $E_G$\nmeasurements exhibit slightly lower values than expected for standard\nrelativistic gravity in a {\\Lambda}CDM background, although the results are\nconsistent within $1-2\\sigma$.\n", "  Small polaron formation in transition metal oxides, like the prototypical\nmaterial rutile TiO$_2$, remains a puzzle and a challenge to simple theoretical\ntreatment. In our combined experimental and theoretical study, we examine this\nproblem using Raman spectroscopy of photo-excited samples and real-time\ntime-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT), which employs Ehrenfest\ndynamics to couple the electronic and ionic subsystems. We observe\nexperimentally the unexpected stiffening of the $A_{1g}$ phonon mode under UV\nillumination and provide a theoretical explanation for this effect. Our\nanalysis also reveals a possible reason for the observed anomalous\ntemperature-dependence of the Hall mobility. Small polaron formation in rutile\nTiO$_2$ is a strongly non-adiabatic process and is adequately described by\nEhrenfest dynamics at time scales of polaron formation.\n", "  The low flux of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) at the highest\nenergies provides a challenge to answer the long standing question about their\norigin and nature. Even lower fluxes of neutrinos with energies above $10^{22}$\neV are predicted in certain Grand-Unifying-Theories (GUTs) and e.g.\\ models for\nsuper-heavy dark matter (SHDM). The significant increase in detector volume\nrequired to detect these particles can be achieved by searching for the\nnano-second radio pulses that are emitted when a particle interacts in Earth's\nmoon with current and future radio telescopes.\n  In this contribution we present the design of an online analysis and trigger\npipeline for the detection of nano-second pulses with the LOFAR radio\ntelescope. The most important steps of the processing pipeline are digital\nfocusing of the antennas towards the Moon, correction of the signal for\nionospheric dispersion, and synthesis of the time-domain signal from the\npolyphased-filtered signal in frequency domain. The implementation of the\npipeline on a GPU/CPU cluster will be discussed together with the computing\nperformance of the prototype.\n", "  The adaptive voter model has been widely studied as a conceptual model for\nopinion formation processes on time-evolving social networks. Past studies on\nthe effect of zealots, i.e. nodes aiming to spread their fixed opinion\nthroughout the system, only considered the voter model on a static network.\nHere, we extend the study of zealotry to the case of an adaptive network\ntopology co-evolving with the state of the nodes and investigate opinion\nspreading induced by zealots depending on their initial density and\nconnectedness. Numerical simulations reveal that below the fragmentation\nthreshold a low density of zealots is sufficient to spread their opinion to the\nwhole network. Beyond the transition point, zealots must exhibit an increased\ndegree as compared to ordinary nodes for an efficient spreading of their\nopinion. We verify the numerical findings using a mean-field approximation of\nthe model yielding a low-dimensional set of coupled ordinary differential\nequations. Our results imply that the spreading of the zealot opinion in the\nadaptive voter model is strongly dependent on the rate of link rewiring and the\naverage degree of normal nodes in comparison with that of the zealots. In order\nto avoid a complete dominance of the zealots' opinion, there are two possible\nstrategies for the remaining nodes: adjusting the rate of rewiring and/or the\nnumber of connections with other nodes, respectively.\n", "  I review a number of recent developments in the physics of compact stars\ncontaining deconfined quark matter, including (a)~their cooling with possible\nphase transition from a fully gapped to a gapless phase of QCD at low\ntemperatures and large isospin, (b)~the transport coefficients of the 2SC phase\nand the role played by the Aharonov-Bohm interactions between flux-tubes and\nunpaired fermions; (c)~rapidly rotating compact stars and spin-down and spin-up\ninduced phase transition between hadronic and QCD matter as well as between\ndifferent phases of QCD.\n", "  We propose a novel architecture for scalable quantum computation based on\nquantum actuated decoherence-free (DF) qubits. Each qubit is encoded by the DF\nsubspace of a nuclear spin pair and has long coherence time. A nitrogen-vacancy\ncenter in diamond is chosen as the quantum actuator to realize initialization,\nreadout and universal control of DF qubits with fidelities higher than 99%. It\nreduces the challenge of classical interfaces from controlling and observing\ncomplex quantum systems down to a simple quantum actuator. Our scheme also\nprovides a novel way to handle complex quantum systems.\n", "  I explore the phenomenology of Supersymmetry models in which the gauginos are\nmuch heavier then that scalar particles of the MSSM. In these models, the\ngauginos are inaccessible to colliders while the scalar spectrum is compressed.\nI give several examples of models which exhibit this phenomenology built in the\nclass of General Gauge Mediated Models. I explore possible LSP and NLSP\ncandidates in these scenarios including Higgsino, stau, and sneutrino\ncandidates. Collider signatures for these models include multi-particle decay\nchains, many taus in the final state, and possible displaced vertices with\nsemi-long lived sparticles. I enumerate the most likely collider smoking gun\ncollider signatures for each general LSP/NLSP scenario.\n", "  We present the first calculation of the shear viscosity for two-flavor plane\nwave (FF) color superconducting quark matter. This is a member of the family of\ncrystalline color superconducting phases of dense quark matter that may be\npresent in the cores of neutron stars. The paired quarks in the FF phase\nfeature gapless excitations on surfaces of crescent shaped blocking regions in\nmomentum space and participate in transport. We calculate their contribution to\nthe shear viscosity. We note that they also lead to dynamic screening of\ntransverse $t^1$, $t^2$, $t^3$ gluons which are undamped in the 2SC phase. The\nexchange of these gluons is the most important mechanism of the scattering of\nthe paired quarks. We find that the shear viscosity of the paired quarks is\nroughly a factor of $100$ smaller compared to the shear viscosity of unpaired\nquark matter. Our results may have implications for the damping of $r-$modes in\nrapidly rotating, cold neutron stars.\n", "  Statistical reaction theories such as Hauser-Feshbach assume that branching\nratios follow Bohr's compound nucleus hypothesis by factorizing into\nindependent probabilities for different channels. Corrections to the\nfactorization hypothesis are known in both nuclear theory and quantum transport\ntheory, particularly an enhanced memory of the entrance channel. We apply the\nGaussian orthogonal ensemble to study a complementary suppression of exit\nchannel branching ratios. The effect can be large enough to provide information\non the number of exit channels. The effect is demonstrated for the branching\nratios of neutron-induced reactions on a $^{235}$U target.\n", "  The Oktay-Kronfeld (OK) action extends the Fermilab improvement program for\nmassive Wilson fermions to higher order in suitable power-counting schemes. It\nincludes dimension-six and -seven operators necessary for matching to QCD\nthrough order ${\\mathrm{O}}(\\Lambda^3/m_Q^3)$ in HQET power counting, for\napplications to heavy-light systems, and ${\\mathrm{O}}(v^6)$ in NRQCD power\ncounting, for applications to quarkonia. In the Symanzik power counting of\nlattice gauge theory near the continuum limit, the OK action includes all\n${\\mathrm{O}}(a^2)$ and some ${\\mathrm{O}}(a^3)$ terms. To assess whether the\ntheoretical improvement is realized in practice, we study combinations of\nheavy-strange and quarkonia masses and mass splittings, designed to isolate\nheavy-quark discretization effects. We find that, with one exception, the\nresults obtained with the tree-level-matched OK action are significantly closer\nto the continuum limit than the results obtained with the Fermilab action. The\nexception is the hyperfine splitting of the bottom-strange system, for which\nour statistical errors are too large to draw a firm conclusion. These studies\nare carried out with data generated with the tadpole-improved Fermilab and OK\nactions on 500 gauge configurations from one of MILC's $a\\approx0.12$~fm,\n$N_f=2+1$-flavor, asqtad-staggered ensembles.\n", "  Localising the galileon symmetry along with Poincare symmetry we have found a\nversion of galileon model coupled with curved spacetime which retains the\ninternal galileon symmetry in covariant form. Also, the model has second order\nequations of motion.\n", "  We demonstrate that the normalised localization length $\\beta$ of the\neigenfunctions of diluted (sparse) banded random matrices follows the scaling\nlaw $\\beta=x^*/(1+x^*)$. The scaling parameter of the model is defined as\n$x^*\\propto(b_{eff}^2/N)^\\delta$, where $b_{eff}$ is the average number of\nnon-zero elements per matrix row, $N$ is the matrix size, and $\\delta\\sim 1$.\nAdditionally, we show that $x^*$ also scales the spectral properties of the\nmodel (up to certain sparsity) characterized by the spacing distribution of\neigenvalues.\n", "  A quantitative vortex-fluid model for flux-flow resistivity $\\rho$ and Nernst\nsignal $e_N$ in high-temperature superconductors (HTSC) is proposed. Two kinds\nof vortices, magnetic and thermal, are considered, and the damping viscosity\n$\\eta$ is modeled by extending the Bardeen-Stephen model to include the\ncontributions of flux pinning at low temperature and in weak magnetic fields,\nand vortex-vortex collisions in strong magnetic fields. Remarkably accurate\ndescriptions for both Nernst signal of six samples and flux flow resistivity\nare achieved over a wide range of temperature $T$ and magnetic field $B$. A\ndiscrepancy of three orders of magnitude between data and Anderson's model of\nNernst signal is pointed out and revised using experimental values of $\\eta$\nfrom magnetoresistance. Furthermore, a two-step procedure is developed to\nreliably extract, from the Nernst signal, a set of physical parameters\ncharacterizing the vortex dynamics, which yields predictions of local\nsuperfluid density $n_s$, the Kosterlitz coefficient $b$ of thermal vortices,\nand upper critical field and temperature. Application of the model and\nsystematic measurement of relevant physical quantities from Nernst signal in\nother HTSC samples are discussed.\n", "  Kitaev's quantum double models, including the toric code, are canonical\nexamples of quantum topological models on a 2D spin lattice. Their Hamiltonian\ndefines the groundspace by imposing an energy penalty to any nontrivial flux or\ncharge, but does not distinguish among those. We generalize this construction\nby introducing a novel family of Hamiltonians made of commuting four-body\nprojectors that provide an intricate splitting of the Hilbert space by\ndiscriminating among non-trivial charges and fluxes. Our construction\nhighlights that anyons are not in one-to-one correspondence with energy\neigenspaces, a feature already present in Kitaev's construction. This\ndiscrepancy is due to the presence of local degrees of freedom in addition to\ntopological ones on a lattice.\n", "  Metal atoms and small clusters introduced into superfluid helium (He II)\nconcentrate there in quantized vortices to form (by further coagulation) the\nthin nanowires. The nanowires' thickness and structure are well predicted by a\ndouble-staged mechanism. On the first stage the coagulation of cold particles\nin the vortex cores leads to melting of their fusion product, which acquires a\nspherical shape due to surface tension. Then (second stage) when these\nparticles reach a certain size they do not possess sufficient energy to melt\nand eventually coalesce into the nanowires. Nevertheless the assumption of\nmelting for such refractory metal as tungsten, especially in He II, which\npossesses an extremely high thermal conductivity, induces natural skepticism.\nThat is why we decided to register directly the visible thermal emission\naccompanying metals coagulation in He II. The brightness temperatures of this\nradiation for the tungsten, molybdenum, and platinum coagulation were found to\nbe noticeably higher than even the metals' melting temperatures. The region of\nHe II that contained suspended metal particles expanded with the velocity of 50\nm/s, being close to the Landau velocity, but coagulation took place even more\nquickly, so that the whole process of nanowire growth is completed at distances\nabout 1.5 mm from the place of metal injection into He II. High rate of\ncoagulation of guest metal particles as well as huge local overheating are\nassociated with them concentrating in quantized vortex cores. The same process\nshould take place not only for metals but for any atoms, molecules and small\nclusters embedded into He II.\n", "  We prove a result on separation of particles in a two-dimensional Coulomb\nplasma, which holds provided that the inverse temperature $\\beta$ satisfies\n$\\beta>1$. For large $\\beta$, separation is obtained at the same scale as the\nconjectural Abrikosov lattice optimal separation.\n", "  A fully analytical approximation for the observable characteristics of\nmany-electron atoms is developed via a complete and orthonormal hydrogen-like\nbasis with a single-effective charge parameter for all electrons of a given\natom. The basis completeness allows us to employ the secondary-quantized\nrepresentation for the construction of regular perturbation theory, which\nincludes in a natural way correlation effects, converges fast and enables an\neffective calculation of the subsequent corrections. The hydrogen-like basis\nset provides a possibility to perform all summations over intermediate states\nin closed form, including both the discrete and continuous spectra. This is\nachieved with the help of the decomposition of the multi-particle Green\nfunction in a convolution of single-electronic Coulomb Green functions. We\ndemonstrate that our fully analytical zeroth-order approximation describes the\nwhole spectrum of the system, provides accuracy, which is independent of the\nnumber of electrons and is important for applications where the Thomas-Fermi\nmodel is still utilized. In addition already in second-order perturbation\ntheory our results become comparable with those via a multi-configuration\nHartree-Fock approach.\n", "  We propose a simple analytic model to understand when star formation is\ntime-steady versus bursty in galaxies. Recent models explain the observed\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation between star formation rate and gas surface\ndensities in galaxies as resulting from a balance between stellar feedback and\ngravity. We argue that bursty star formation occurs when such an equilibrium\ncannot be stably sustained, and identify two regimes in which galaxy-scale star\nformation should be bursty: i) at high redshift (z>~1) for galaxies of all\nmasses, and ii) at low masses (depending on gas fraction) for galaxies at any\nredshift. At high redshift, characteristic galactic dynamical timescales become\ntoo short for supernova feedback to effectively respond to gravitational\ncollapse in galactic discs (an effect recently identified for galactic nuclei),\nwhereas in dwarf galaxies star formation occurs in too few bright star-forming\nregions to effectively average out. Burstiness is also enhanced at high\nredshift owing to elevated gas fractions in the early Universe. Our model can\nthus explain the bursty star formation rates predicted in these regimes by\nrecent high-resolution galaxy formation simulations, as well as the bursty star\nformation histories observationally-inferred in both local dwarf and\nhigh-redshift galaxies. In our model, bursty star formation is associated with\nparticularly strong spatio-temporal clustering of supernovae. Such clustering\ncan promote the formation of galactic winds and our model may thus also explain\nthe much higher wind mass loading factors inferred in high-redshift massive\ngalaxies relative to their z~0 counterparts.\n", "  It is not yet known if the properties of molecular gas in distant\nprotocluster galaxies are significantly affected by their environment as\ngalaxies are in local clusters. Through a deep, 64 hours of effective on-source\nintegration with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we discovered a\nmassive, M_mol=2.0+-0.2x10^11 M_sun, extended, ~40 kpc, CO(1-0)-emitting disk\nin the protocluster surrounding the radio galaxy, MRC1138-262. The galaxy, at\nz_CO=2.1478, is a clumpy, massive disk galaxy, M_star~5x10^11 M_sun, which lies\n250 kpc in projection from MRC1138-262 and is a known H-alpha emitter, HAE229.\nHAE229 has a molecular gas fraction of ~30%. The CO emission has a kinematic\ngradient along its major axis, centered on the highest surface brightness\nrest-frame optical emission, consistent with HAE229 being a rotating disk.\nSurprisingly, a significant fraction of the CO emission lies outside of the\nUV/optical emission. In spite of this, HAE229 follows the same relation between\nstar-formation rate and molecular gas mass as normal field galaxies. HAE229 is\nthe first CO(1-0) detection of an ordinary, star-forming galaxy in a\nprotocluster. We compare a sample of cluster members at z>0.4 that are detected\nin low-order CO transitions with a similar sample of sources drawn from the\nfield. We confirm findings that the CO-luminosity and FWHM are correlated in\nstarbursts and show that this relation is valid for normal high-z galaxies as\nwell as those in overdensities. We do not find a clear dichotomy in the\nintegrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for protocluster and field galaxies. Not\nfinding any environmental dependence in the \"star-formation efficiency\" or the\nmolecular gas content, especially for such an extended CO disk, suggests that\nenvironmentally-specific processes such as ram pressure stripping are not\noperating efficiently in (proto)clusters. (abridged)\n", "  We consider a holographic model of the heating up process. As a dual\nbackground we take a geometry describing thin shell accretion on a black brane.\nWe find explicitly the time evolution of the mutual information during the\nnon-equlibrium heating process from the initial temperature $T_i$ to the final\ntemperature $T_f$ for the system of two intervals in the 1+1 dimensional case.\nWe calculate widths and separation of twointervals for which the time\ndependence of the mutual information has the bell-like form, i.e. it starts\nfrom zero value at the wake up time, then reaches a maximal value and vanishes\nat the scrambling time. This form of the mutual information evolution was\npreviously found in photosynthesis. The zone of the bell-like configurations\nexists for small distances $x<\\log 2/2\\pi T_i$ only for the particular interval\nsizes. For $x$ large enough, i.e. $x>>\\log 2/2\\pi T_i$, it exists only for\nlarge enough interval sizes and this zone becomes more narrow when $T_i$\nincreases and becomes larger with increasing of $T_f$.\n", "  Within a Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) scenario, we use high resolution\ncosmological simulations spanning over four orders of magnitude in galaxy mass\nto understand the deficit of dwarf galaxies in observed velocity functions. We\nmeasure velocities in as similar a way as possible to observations, including\ngenerating mock HI data cubes for our simulated galaxies. We demonstrate that\nthis apples-to-apples comparison yields an \"observed\" velocity function in\nagreement with observations, reconciling the large number of low-mass halos\nexpected in a LCDM cosmological model with the low number of observed dwarfs at\na given velocity. We then explore the source of the discrepancy between\nobservations and theory, and conclude that the dearth of observed dwarf\ngalaxies is primarily explained by two effects. The first effect is that\ngalactic rotational velocities derived from the HI linewidth severely\nunderestimate the maximum halo velocity. The second effect is that a large\nfraction of halos at the lowest masses are too faint to be detected by current\ngalaxy surveys. We find that cored dark matter density profiles can contribute\nto the lower observed velocity of galaxies, but only for galaxies in which the\nvelocity is measured interior to the size of the core (~3 kpc).\n", "  We describe the conformal symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetime. These\nrepresent an extension of the BMS group that we call the conformal BMS group.\nIts general features are discussed.\n", "  In the recently discovered Weyl semimetals, the Fermi surface may feature\ndisjoint, open segments -- the so-called Fermi arcs -- associated with\ntopological states bound to exposed crystal surfaces. Here we show that the\ncollective dynamics of electrons near such surfaces sharply departs from that\nof a conventional three-dimensional metal. In magnetic systems with broken time\nreversal symmetry, the resulting Fermi arc plasmons (FAPs) are chiral, with\ndispersion relations featuring open, hyperbolic constant frequency contours. As\na result, a large range of surface plasmon wave vectors can be supported at a\ngiven frequency, with corresponding group velocity vectors directed along a few\nspecific collimated directions. Fermi arc plasmons can be probed using near\nfield photonics techniques, which may be used to launch highly directional,\nfocused surface plasmon beams. The unusual characteristics of FAPs arise from\nthe interplay of bulk and surface Fermi arc carrier dynamics, and give a window\ninto the unusual Fermiology of Weyl semimetals.\n", "  SN Hun248 was classified as a nonterminal eruption (a SN \"impostor\") from a\ndirectly identified and highly variable cool hypergiant star. The 2014 outburst\nachieved peak luminosity equivalent to that of the historic eruption of\nluminous blue variable (LBV) Eta Car, and exhibited a multipeaked optical light\ncurve that rapidly faded after ~100 days. We report ultraviolet (UV) through\noptical observations of SN Hunt248 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) about\n1 yr after the outburst, and mid-infrared observations with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope before the burst and in decline. The HST data reveal a source that is\na factor of ~10 dimmer in apparent brightness than the faintest available\nmeasurement of the precursor star. The UV-optical spectral energy distribution\n(SED) requires a strong Balmer continuum, consistent with a hot B4-B5\nphotosphere attenuated by grey circumstellar extinction. Substantial\nmid-infrared excess of the source is consistent with thermal emission from hot\ndust with a mass of 10^{-6} - 10^{-5} MSun and a geometric extent that is\ncomparable to the expansion radius of the ejecta from the 2014 event. SED\nmodeling indicates that the dust consists of relatively large grains (>0.3 um),\nwhich could be related to the grey circumstellar extinction that we infer for\nthe UV-optical counterpart. Revised analysis of the precursor photometry is\nalso consistent with grey extinction by circumstellar dust, and suggests that\nthe initial mass of the star could be twice as large as previously estimated\n(nearly ~60 MSun). Reanalysis of the earlier outburst data shows that the peak\nluminosity and outflow velocity of the eruption are consistent with a trend\nexhibited by stellar merger candidates, prompting speculation that SN Hunt248\nmay also have stemmed from a massive stellar merger or common-envelope\nejection.\n", "  We explore the consequences of dynamical evolution of field binaries composed\nof a primary black hole (BH) and a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star in the context of\ngravitational wave (GW) source progenitors. We argue, from general\nconsiderations, that the spin of the WR-descendent BH will be maximal in a\nsignificant number of cases due to dynamical effects. In other cases, the spin\nshould reflect the natal spin of the primary BH which are currently\ntheoretically unconstrained. We argue that the three currently published LIGO\nsystems (GW150914, GW151226, LVT151012) suggest that this spin is small. The\nresultant effective spin distribution of gravitational wave sources should thus\nbe bi-model if this classic GW progenitor channel is indeed dominant. While\nthis is consistent with the LIGO detections thus far, it is in contrast to the\nthree best-measured high-mass x-ray binary (HMXB) systems. A comparison of the\nspin distribution of HMXBs and GW sources should ultimately reveal whether or\nnot these systems arise from similar astrophysical channels.\n", "  We explore the temperature dependent magnetoresistance of bulk insulating\ntopological insulator thin films. Thin films of Bi2Se2Te and BiSbTeSe1.6 were\ngrown using Pulsed Laser Deposition technique and subjected to transport\nmeasurements. Magnetotransport measurements indicate a non-saturating linear\nmagnetoresistance (LMR) behavior at high magnetic field values. We present a\ncareful analysis to explain the origin of LMR taking into consideration all the\nexisting models of LMR. Here we consider that the bulk insulating states and\nthe metallic surface states constitute two parallel conduction channels.\nInvoking this, we were able to explain linear magnetoresistance behavior as a\ncompetition between these parallel channels. We observe that the crossover\nfield, where LMR sets in, decreases with increasing temperature. We propose\nthat this cross over field can be used phenomenologically to estimate the\nstrength of surface to bulk coupling.\n", "  We propose a conjectural explicit formula of generating series of a new type\nfor Gromov--Witten invariants of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ of all degrees in full genera.\n", "  As indicated in our previous paper (Phys.Rev.D96.034002), the existing\nliteratures studying the $J/\\psi$ production in deeply inelastic scattering\n(DIS) in collinear factorization are on the basis of a formalism that will lead\nto wrong results when the ranges of the transverse momentum or the rapidity of\nthe $J/\\psi$ in the laboratory frame do not cover all values possible for them.\nIn this paper, we present the renewed results for the $J/\\psi$ production in\nDIS at HERA within the nonrelativistic QCD framework at QCD leading order (LO).\nThree different sets of the long-distance matrix elements are employed for\ncomparison. The predictions via the colour-singlet (CS) model at QCD LO are\ngenerally below the experimental data especially in the regions where\nperturbation theory are expected to work well, while the colour-octet\ncontributions are of the same order of magnitude as the CS ones, however, in\ngeneral make the agreement between theory and experiment better.\n", "  We derive Ehrenfest like equations for the coupled Gross Pitaevskii equations\n(CGPE) which describe the dynamics of the binary Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BBEC) both in the free particle regime and in the regime where condensate is\nwell trapped. Instead of traditional variational technique, we propose a new\nEhrenfest based approach to explore so far unrevealed dynamics for CGPE and\nillustrate the possibility of almost shape invariant states in both the\nregimes. In absence of trapping potential, when all the interactions present in\nthe system are attractive, it is possible for an initially mixed Gaussian state\nto propagate with almost no change in width if the proper initial condition is\nsatisfied. Even for repulsive intra-atomic and attractive inter-atomic\ninteraction ($g_{\\alpha\\beta}$) one can tune $|g_{\\alpha\\beta}|$ such that the\nwidth of the propagating wave packet remains bounded within almost about\n$10\\%$. We also discuss the dynamics of the initially phase separated\ncondensate and have shown the breakdown of Gaussian nature of the wave packets\ndue to collisions. However, when BEC is trapped in simple harmonic\noscillator(SHO) potential, for $g_{\\alpha\\beta}>0$, it is possible for an\ninitially overlapping state to retain its initial shape if $g_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is\nless than a critical value ($g_{\\alpha\\beta}^c$). If $g_{\\alpha\\beta}$ exceeds\n$g_{\\alpha\\beta}^c$, an overlapping state can become phase separated while\nkeeping its shape unchanged.\n", "  We present the results of a search for the rare decays $B\\to\nh\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$, where $h$ stands for $K^+,\\:K^0_{\\mathrm{S}},\\:K^{\\ast\n+},\\:K^{\\ast 0},\\:\\pi^+,\\:\\pi^0,\\:\\rho^+$ and $\\rho^{0}$. The results are\nobtained with $772\\times10^{6}$ $B\\overline{B}$ pairs collected with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB $e^+ e^-$ collider. We reconstruct one $B$ meson in a\nsemileptonic decay and require a single $h$ meson but nothing else on the\nsignal side. We observe no significant signal and set upper limits on the\nbranching fractions. The limits set on the $B\\to\nK^0_{\\mathrm{S}}\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$, $B^0\\to K^{*0}\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$, $B\\to\n\\pi^+\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$, $B^0\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$,\n$B^+\\to\\rho^+\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$, and $B^0\\to\\rho^0\\nu\\overline{\\nu}$ channels\nare the world's most stringent.\n", "  A (k,n)-threshold secret-sharing scheme allows for a string to be split into\nn shares in such a way that any subset of at least k shares suffices to recover\nthe secret string, but such that any subset of at most k-1 shares contains no\ninformation about the secret. Quantum secret-sharing schemes extend this idea\nto the sharing of quantum states. Here we propose a method of performing\ncomputation on quantum shared secrets. We introduce a (n,n)-quantum secret\nsharing scheme together with a set of protocols that allow quantum circuits to\nbe evaluated on the shared secret without the need to decode the secret. We\nconsider a multipartite setting, with each participant holding a share of the\nsecret. We show that if there exists at least one honest participant, no group\nof dishonest participants can recover any information about the shared secret,\nindependent of their deviations from the protocol.\n", "  We prove that Nagaoka's theorem, that the large-$U$ Hubbard model with\nexactly one hole is ferromagnetic, holds for any balanced Hamiltonian. Simply\nput, if a positive bond encodes friendship and a negative bond encodes enmity,\nthen balance implies when that enemy of one's enemy is one's friend. We argue\nthat, in itinerant electron systems, a balanced Hamiltonian, rather than\nbipartite lattice, defines an unfrustrated system. The proof is valid for\nmulti-orbital models with arbitrary two-orbital interactions provided that no\nexchange interactions are antiferromagnetic: a class of models including the\nKanomori Hamiltonian.\n", "  We review the concept of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and discuss examples\nof their use in a number of scenarios. Several SVM implementations have been\nused in HEP and we exemplify this algorithm using the Toolkit for Multivariate\nAnalysis (TMVA) implementation. We discuss examples relevant to HEP including\nbackground suppression for $H\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-$ at the LHC with several different\nkernel functions. Performance benchmarking leads to the issue of generalisation\nof hyper-parameter selection. The avoidance of fine tuning (over training or\nover fitting) in MVA hyper-parameter optimisation, i.e. the ability to ensure\ngeneralised performance of an MVA that is independent of the training,\nvalidation and test samples, is of utmost importance. We discuss this issue and\ncompare and contrast performance of hold-out and k-fold cross-validation. We\nhave extended the SVM functionality and introduced tools to facilitate cross\nvalidation in TMVA and present results based on these improvements.\n", "  A method is described to solve the nonlinear Langevin equations arising from\nquadratic interactions in quantum mechanics. While, the zeroth order\nlinearization approximation to the operators is normally used, here first and\nsecond order truncation perturbation schemes are proposed. These schemes employ\nhigher-order system operators, and then approximate number operators with their\ncorresponding mean boson numbers, only where needed. Spectral densities of\nhigher-order operators are derived, and an expression for the second-order\ncorrelation function at zero time-delay has been found, which reveals that the\ncavity photon occupation of an ideal laser at threshold reaches $\\sqrt{6}-2$,\nin good agreement with extensive numerical calculations. As further\napplications, analysis of the quantum anharmonic oscillator, calculation of\n$Q-$functions, analysis of quantum limited amplifiers, and nondemoliton\nmeasurements.\n", "  We disprove a conjecture of Breuer-Last-Simon concerning the absolutely\ncontinuous spectrum of Jacobi matrices with coefficients that obey an $\\ell^2$\nbounded variation condition with step $q$. We prove existence of a.c. spectrum\non a smaller set than that specified by the conjecture and prove that our\nresult is optimal.\n", "  We identify and investigate thermal spin transport phenomena in\nsputter-deposited Pt/NiFe$_2$O$_{\\textrm{4-x}}$ ($4\\geq x \\geq 0$) bilayers. We\nseparate the voltage generated by the spin Seebeck effect from the anomalous\nNernst effect contributions and even disentangle the intrinsic anomalous Nernst\neffect (ANE) in the ferromagnet (FM) from the ANE produced by the Pt that is\nspin polarized due to its proximity to the FM. Further, we probe the dependence\nof these effects on the electrical conductivity and the band gap energy of the\nFM film varying from nearly insulating NiFe$_2$O$_4$ to metallic\nNi$_{33}$Fe$_{67}$. A proximity-induced ANE could only be identified in the\nmetallic Pt/Ni$_{33}$Fe$_{67}$ bilayer in contrast to Pt/NiFe$_2$O$_{\\rm x}$\n($x>0$) samples. This is verified by the investigation of static magnetic\nproximity effects via x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity.\n", "  It has been shown that AdS/CFT calculations can reproduce certain exclusive\n2->2 cross sections in QCD at high energy, both for near-forward and for\nfixed-angle scattering. In this paper, we extend prior treatments by using\nAdS/CFT to calculate the inclusive single-particle production cross section in\nQCD at high center-of-mass energy. We find that conformal invariance in the UV\nrestricts the cross section to have a characteristic power-law falloff in the\ntransverse momentum of the produced particle, with the exponent given by twice\nthe conformal dimension of the produced particle, independent of incoming\nparticle types. We conclude by comparing our findings to recent LHC\nexperimental data from ATLAS and ALICE, and find good agreement.\n", "  We demonstrate that pulses of linear physical systems, weakly perturbed by\nnonlinear dissipation, exhibit soliton-like behavior in fast collisions. The\nbehavior is demonstrated for linear waveguides with weak cubic loss and for\nsystems described by linear diffusion-advection models with weak quadratic\nloss. We show that in both systems, the expressions for the collision-induced\namplitude shifts due to the nonlinear loss have the same form as the expression\nfor the amplitude shift in a fast collision between two optical solitons in the\npresence of weak cubic loss. Our analytic predictions are confirmed by\nnumerical simulations with the corresponding coupled linear evolution models\nwith weak nonlinear loss. These results open the way for studying dynamics of\nfast collisions between pulses of weakly perturbed linear physical systems in\nan arbitrary spatial dimension.\n", "  We present an expression for the four-point conformal blocks of symmetric\ntraceless operators of arbitrary spin as an integral over a pair of geodesics\nin Anti-de Sitter space, generalizing the geodesic Witten diagram formalism of\nHijano et al [arXiv:1508.00501] to arbitrary spin. As an intermediate step in\nthe derivation, we identify a convenient basis of bulk three-point interaction\nvertices which give rise to all possible boundary three point structures. We\nhighlight a direct connection between the representation of the conformal block\nas a geodesic Witten diagram and the shadow operator formalism.\n", "  As HPC facilities grow their resources, adaptation of classic HEP/NP\nworkflows becomes a need. Linux containers may very well offer a way to lower\nthe bar to exploiting such resources and at the time, help collaboration to\nreach vast elastic resources on such facilities and address their massive\ncurrent and future data processing challenges. In this proceeding, we showcase\nSTAR data reconstruction workflow at Cori HPC system at NERSC. STAR software is\npackaged in a Docker image and runs at Cori in Shifter containers. We highlight\ntwo of the typical end-to-end optimization challenges for such pipelines: 1)\ndata transfer rate which was carried over ESnet after optimizing end points and\n2) scalable deployment of conditions database in an HPC environment. Our tests\ndemonstrate equally efficient data processing workflows on Cori/HPC, comparable\nto standard Linux clusters.\n", "  We investigate first- and second-order quantum phase transitions of the\nanisotropic quantum Rabi model, in which the rotating- and counter-rotating\nterms are allowed to have different coupling strength. The model interpolates\nbetween two known limits with distinct universal properties. Through a\ncombination of analytic and numerical approaches we extract the phase diagram,\nscaling functions, and critical exponents, which allows us to establish that\nthe universality class at finite? anisotropy is the same as the isotropic\nlimit. We also reveal other interesting features, including a\nsuperradiance-induced freezing of the effective mass and discontinuous scaling\nfunctions in the Jaynes-Cummings limit. Our findings are relevant in a variety\nof systems able to realize strong coupling between light and matter, such as\ncircuit QED setups where a finite anisotropy appears quite naturally.\n", "  We present a detailed spectroscopic study of the photoluminescence quenching\nin an epitaxial structures containing CdSe/ZnSe quantum dots doped with low\nconcentration of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. Our time-resolved and time-integrated\nexperiments reveal the origin of the quenching observed in\nmacro-photoluminescence studies of ensembles of such dots. We show that\nincorporation of even a few ions to an individual dot does not quench its\nluminescence effectively, although some fingerprints of expected spin-dependent\nquenching are visible. At the same time, the presence of Mn$^{2+}$ ions in the\nsample significantly affects the luminescence intensity of the wetting layer,\nresulting in a quenching of the global luminescence from studied structure. On\nthe other hand, the luminescence decay dynamics is found to be independent of\nthe presence of Mn$^{2+}$ ions, which suggests that the observed quenching\noccurs for the excited excitonic states.\n", "  The GooFit Framework is designed to perform maximum-likelihood fits for\narbitrary functions on various parallel back ends, for example a GPU. We\npresent an extension to GooFit which adds the functionality to perform\ntime-dependent amplitude analyses of pseudoscalar mesons decaying into four\npseudoscalar final states. Benchmarks of this functionality show a significant\nperformance increase when utilizing a GPU compared to a CPU. Furthermore, this\nextension is employed to study the sensitivity on the $D^0 - \\bar{D}^0$ mixing\nparameters $x$ and $y$ in a time-dependent amplitude analysis of the decay $D^0\n\\rightarrow K^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$. Studying a sample of 50 000 events and setting\nthe central values to the world average of $x = (0.49 \\pm0.15) \\%$ and $y =\n(0.61 \\pm0.08) \\%$, the statistical sensitivities of $x$ and $y$ are determined\nto be $\\sigma(x) = 0.019 \\%$ and $\\sigma(y) = 0.019 \\%$.\n", "  An instability of a liquid droplet traversed by an energetic ion is explored.\nThis instability is brought about by the predicted shock wave induced by the\nion. An observation of multifragmentation of small droplets traversed by ions\nwith high linear energy transfer is suggested to demonstrate the existence of\nshock waves. A number of effects are analysed in effort to find the conditions\nfor such an experiment to be signifying. The presence of shock waves crucially\naffects the scenario of radiation damage with ions since the shock waves\nsignificantly contribute to the thermomechanical damage of biomolecules as well\nas the transport of reactive species. While the scenario has been upheld by\nanalyses of biological experiments, the shock waves have not yet been observed\ndirectly, regardless of a number of ideas of experiments to detect them were\nexchanged at conferences.\n", "  We have measured the optically injected excess carrier lifetime in silicon\nusing photoexcited muon spin spectroscopy. Positive muons implanted deep in a\nwafer can interact with the excess carriers and directly probe the bulk carrier\nlifetime whilst minimizing the effect from surface recombination. The method is\nbased on the relaxation rate of muon spin asymmetry, which depends on the\nexcess carrier concentration. The underlying microscopic mechanism has been\nunderstood by simulating the four-state muonium model in Si under illumination.\nWe apply the technique to different injection levels and temperatures, and\ndemonstrate its ability for injection- and temperature-dependent lifetime\nspectroscopy.\n", "  In this work we investigate a $Z_2$ symmetric model of one scalar field\n$\\phi$ in $(1,1)$ dimension. The model is characterized by a continuous\ntransition from a potential $V(\\phi)$ with two vacua to the vacuumless case.\nThe model has kink and antikink solutions that minimize energy. Stability\nanalysis are described by a Schr\\\"odinger-like equation with a potential that\ntransits from a volcano-shape with no vibrational states (in the case of\nvacuumless limit) to a smooth valley with one vibrational state. We are\ninterested on the structure of 2-bounce windows present in kink-antikink\nscattering processes. The standard mechanism of Campbell-Schonfeld-Wingate\n(CSW) requires the presence of one vibrational state for the occurrence of\n2-bounce windows. We report that the effect of increasing the separation of\nvacua from the potential $V(\\phi)$ has the consequence of trading some of the\nfirst 2-bounce windows predicted by the CSW mechanism by false 2-bounce\nwindows. Another consequence is the appearance of false 2-bounce windows of\nzero-order.\n", "  Quantum spin ice, modeled for magnetic rare-earth pyrochlores, has attracted\ngreat interest for hosting a U(1) quantum spin liquid, which involves spin-ice\nmonopoles as gapped deconfined spinons, as well as gapless excitations\nanalogous to photons. However, the global phase diagram under a [111] magnetic\nfield remains open. Here we uncover by means of unbiased quantum Monte-Carlo\nsimulations that a supersolid of monopoles, showing both a superfluidity and a\npartial ionization, intervenes the kagom\\'e spin ice and a fully ionized\nmonopole insulator, in contrast to classical spin ice where a direct\ndiscontinuous phase transition takes place. We also show that on cooling,\nkagom\\'e spin ice evolves towards a valence bond solid similar to what appears\nin the associated kagom\\'e lattice model [S. V. Isakov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n97, 147202 (2006)]. Possible relevance to experiments is discussed.\n", "  The Jansky Very Large Array was used to observe 121 magnetic cataclysmic\nvariables (MCVs). We report radio detections of 19 stars. Fourteen are new\nradio sources, increasing the number of MCVs that are radio sources by more\nthan twofold, from 8 to 22. Most detections are at 8.7 GHz (X-band) with a\nlesser number at 5.4 and 21.1 GHz (C- and K-bands). Most flux density limits\nare in the range of 47-470 uJy. With the exception of AE Aqr, the maximum flux\ndetected is 818 uJy. Fourteen of the detections show approximately 100%\ncircularly polarized emission, which is characteristic of electron-cyclotron\nmaser emission. The data suggest that MCVs might be divided into two classes of\nradio emitters: those dominated by weakly polarized gyro-synchrotron emission\nand those by highly polarized electron-cyclotron maser emission.\n", "  We perform a phenomenological analysis of the $\\cos 2 \\phi $ azimuthal\nasymmetry in virtual photon plus jet production induced by the linear\npolarization of gluons in unpolarized $pA$ collisions. Although the linearly\npolarized gluon distribution becomes maximal at small $x$, TMD evolutionleads\nto a Sudakov suppression of the asymmetry with increasing invariant mass of the\n$\\gamma^*$-jet pair. Employing a small-$x$ model input distribution, the\nasymmetry is found to be strongly suppressed under TMD evolution, but still\nremains sufficiently large to be measurable in the typical kinematical region\naccessible at RHIC or LHC at moderate photon virtuality, whereas it is expected\nto be negligible in $Z/W$-jet pair production at LHC. We point out the optimal\nkinematics for RHIC and LHC studies, in order to expedite the first\nexperimental studies of the linearly polarized gluon distribution through this\nprocess. We further argue that this is a particularly clean process to test the\n$k_t$-resummation formalism in the small-$x$ regime.\n", "  The principle of common cause asserts that positive correlations between\ncausally unrelated events ought to be explained through the action of some\nshared causal factors. Reichenbachian common cause systems are probabilistic\nstructures aimed at accounting for cases where correlations of the aforesaid\nsort cannot be explained through the action of a single common cause. The\nexistence of Reichenbachian common cause systems of arbitrary finite size for\neach pair of non-causally correlated events was allegedly demonstrated by\nHofer-Szab\\'o and R\\'edei in 2006. This paper shows that their proof is\nlogically deficient, and we propose an improved proof.\n", "  In the present work, we explore a nonlinear Dirac equation motivated as the\ncontinuum limit of a binary waveguide array model. We approach the problem both\nfrom a near-continuum perspective as well as from a highly discrete one.\nStarting from the former, we see that the continuum Dirac solitons can be\ncontinued for all values of the discretization (coupling) parameter, down to\nthe uncoupled (so-called anti-continuum) limit where they result in a 9-site\nconfiguration. We also consider configurations with 1- or 2-sites at the\nanti-continuum limit and continue them to large couplings, finding that they\nalso persist. For all the obtained solutions, we examine not only the\nexistence, but also the spectral stability through a linearization analysis and\nfinally consider prototypical examples of the dynamics for a selected number of\ncases for which the solutions are found to be unstable.\n", "  The relaxation of a helical magnetic field ${\\bf B}({\\bf x}, t)$ in a\nhigh-conductivity plasma contained in the annulus between two perfectly\nconducting coaxial cylinders is considered. The plasma is of low density and\nits pressure is negligible compared with the magnetic pressure; the flow of the\nplasma is driven by the Lorentz force and and energy is dissipated primarily by\nthe viscosity of the medium. The axial and toroidal fluxes of magnetic field\nare conserved in the perfect-conductivity limit, as is the mass per unit axial\nlength. The magnetic field relaxes during a rapid initial stage to a force-free\nstate, and then decays slowly, due to the effect of weak resistivity $\\eta$,\nwhile constrained to remain approximately force-free. Interest centres on\nwhether the relaxed field may attain a Taylor state; but under the assumed\nconditions with axial and toroidal flux conserved inside every cylindrical\nLagrangian surface, this is not possible. The effect of an additional\n$\\alpha$-effect associated with instabilities and turbulence in the plasma is\ntherefore investigated in exploratory manner. An assumed pseudo-scalar form of\n$\\alpha$ proportional to $q\\,\\eta\\, ({\\bf j}\\cdot {\\bf B})$ is adopted, where $\n{\\bf j}=\\nabla\\times {\\bf B}$ and $q$ is an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ dimensionless\nparameter. It is shown that, when $q$ is less that a critical value $q_c$, the\nevolution remains smooth and similar to that for $q=0$; but that if $q>q_c$,\nnegative-diffusivity effects act on the axial component of $\\bf B$, generating\nhigh-frequency rapidly damped oscillations and an associated transitory\nappearance of reversed axial field. However, the scalar quantity $\\gamma={\\bf\nj}\\cdot {\\bf B}/B^2$ remains highly non-uniform, so that again the field shows\nno sign of relaxing to a Taylor state for which $\\gamma$ would have to be\nconstant.\n", "  We analytically and numerically investigate the performance of weak-value\namplification (WVA) and related parameter estimation methods in the presence of\ntemporally correlated noise. WVA is a special instance of a general measurement\nstrategy that involves sorting data into separate subsets based on the outcome\nof a second \"partitioning\" measurement. Using a simplified noise model that can\nbe analyzed exactly together with optimal statistical estimators, we compare\nWVA to a conventional measurement method. We find that introducing WVA indeed\nyields a much lower variance of the parameter of interest than does the\nconventional technique, optimized in the absence of any partitioning\nmeasurements. In contrast, a statistically optimal analysis that employs\npartitioning measurements, incorporating all partitioned results and their\nknown correlations, is found to yield an improvement -- typically slight --\nover the noise reduction achieved by WVA. This is because the simple WVA\ntechnique is not tailored to a given noise environment and therefore does not\nmake use of correlations between the different partitions. We also compare WVA\nto traditional background subtraction, a familiar technique where measurement\noutcomes are partitioned to eliminate unknown offsets or errors in calibration.\nSurprisingly, in our model background subtraction turns out to be a special\ncase of the optimal partitioning approach in the balanced case, possessing a\nsimilar typically slight advantage over WVA. These results give deeper insight\ninto the role of partitioning measurements, with or without post-selection, in\nenhancing measurement precision, which some have found puzzling. We finish by\npresenting numerical results to model a more realistic laboratory situation of\ntime-decaying correlations, showing our conclusions hold for a wide range of\nstatistical models.\n", "  We would like to put the area law -- believed to by obeyed by entanglement\nentropies in the ground state of a local field theory -- to scrutiny in the\npresence of non-perturbative effects. We study instanton corrections to\nentanglement entropy in various models whose instanton effects are well\nunderstood, including $U(1)$ gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions and false vacuum\ndecay in $\\phi^4$ theory, and we demonstrate that the area law is indeed obeyed\nin these models. We also perform numerical computations for toy wavefunctions\nmimicking the theta vacuum of the (1+1)-dimensional Schwinger model. Our\nresults indicate that such superpositions exhibit no more violation of the area\nlaw than the logarithmic behavior of a single Fermi surface.\n", "  We present the large statistics of the galaxy effective radius in the\nrest-frame far-infrared (FIR) wavelength Re(FIR) obtained from 1627 deep ALMA\n1-mm band maps that become public by 2017 July. Our ALMA sample consists of\n1034 sources at z=0-6 that typically have the star-formation rate of ~100-1000\nM$_{\\odot}$/yr and the stellar mass of ~10$^{10}$-10$^{11.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We\nhomogeneously derive Re(FIR) and FIR luminosity L_FIR of our ALMA sources via\nthe same uv-visibility method with the exponential disk fitting, carefully\nevaluating the selection and measurement incompletenesses by realistic\nMonte-Carlo simulations. We find that there is a positive correlation between\nRe(FIR) and L_FIR at the >99% significance level. The best-fit power-law\nfunction, Re(FIR) $\\propto$ L_FIR$^{\\alpha}$, provides $\\alpha=0.28+/-0.07$,\nand shows that the average Re(FIR) at a fixed L_FIR decreases toward high\nredshifts. The best-fit $\\alpha$ and the redshift evolution of Re(FIR) are\nsimilar to those of the galaxy effective radius in the rest-frame UV (optical)\nwavelength Re(UV) (Re(Opt.)) revealed by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) studies.\nWe identify that our ALMA sources have significant trends of Re(FIR) <~ Re(UV)\nand Re(Opt.), suggesting that dusty starbursts take place in a compact region.\nMoreover, Re(FIR) of our ALMA sources is comparable to Re(Opt.) of quiescent\ngalaxies at z~1-3 as a function of stellar mass, supporting the evolutionary\nconnection between these two galaxy populations. We also investigate rest-frame\nUV and optical morphologies of our ALMA sources with deep HST images, and find\nthat ~30-40% of our ALMA sources are classified as major mergers. This\nindicates that dusty starbursts are triggered not only by the major mergers but\nalso the other mechanism(s).\n", "  Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing is not only a valuable probe of the\ndark matter distribution of massive galaxies, but can also provide valuable\ncosmological constraints, either by studying the population of strong lenses or\nby measuring time delays in lensed quasars. Due to the rarity of galaxy-scale\nstrongly lensed systems, fast and reliable automated lens finding methods will\nbe essential in the era of large surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. To\ntackle this challenge, we introduce CMU DeepLens, a new fully automated\ngalaxy-galaxy lens finding method based on Deep Learning. This supervised\nmachine learning approach does not require any tuning after the training step\nwhich only requires realistic image simulations of strongly lensed systems. We\ntrain and validate our model on a set of 20,000 LSST-like mock observations\nincluding a range of lensed systems of various sizes and signal-to-noise ratios\n(S/N). We find on our simulated data set that for a rejection rate of\nnon-lenses of 99%, a completeness of 90% can be achieved for lenses with\nEinstein radii larger than 1.4\" and S/N larger than 20 on individual $g$-band\nLSST exposures. Finally, we emphasize the importance of realistically complex\nsimulations for training such machine learning methods by demonstrating that\nthe performance of models of significantly different complexities cannot be\ndistinguished on simpler simulations. We make our code publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/McWilliamsCenter/CMUDeepLens .\n", "  We introduce an updated physical model to simulate the formation and\nevolution of galaxies in cosmological, large-scale\ngravity+magnetohydrodynamical simulations with the moving mesh code AREPO. The\noverall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation\nmodel, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution,\nchemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar\nfeedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and\nmulti-mode feedback. In this paper we give a comprehensive description of the\nphysical and numerical advances which form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The\nNext Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the\ngalactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal\ncontent, and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population.\nAs described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black hole driven\nkinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics, and improvements\nto the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc $h^{-1}$)$^3$ cosmological\nboxes we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The\npresence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an\nimportant impact on the stellar content of $10^{12} M_{\\rm sun}$ haloes and\nabove. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key\nproblems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and\naffecting the stellar content and sizes of the low mass end of the galaxy\npopulation.\n", "  One dimensional topological insulators are characterized by edge states with\nexponentially small energies. According to one generalization of topological\nphases to non-Hermitian systems, a finite system in a non-trivial topological\nphase displays surface states with exponentially long life times. In this work\nwe explore the possibility of exploiting such non-Hermitian topological phases\nto enhance the quantum coherence of a fiducial qubit embedded in a dissipative\nenvironment. We first show that a network of qubits interacting with lossy\ncavities can be represented, in a suitable super-one-particle sector, by a\nnon-Hermitian \"Hamiltonian\" of the desired form. We then study, both\nanalytically and numerically, one-dimensional geometries with up to three sites\nper unit cell, and up to a topological winding number $W=2$. For finite-size\nsystems the number of edge modes is a complicated function of $W$ and the\nsystem size $N$. However we find that there are precisely $W$ modes localized\nat one end of the chain. In such topological phases the quibt's coherence\nlifetime is exponentially large in the system size. We verify that, for $W>1$,\nat large times, the Lindbladian evolution is approximately a non-trivial\nunitary. For $W=2$ this results in Rabi-like oscillations of the qubit's\ncoherence measure.\n", "  The functionality of GooFit, a GPU-friendly framework for doing\nmaximum-likelihood fits, has been extended to extract model-independent S-wave\namplitudes in three-body decays such as $D^+ \\to h^+h^+h^-$. A full amplitude\nanalysis is done where the magnitudes and phases of the S-wave amplitudes are\nanchored at a finite number of $m^2(h^+h^-)$ control points, and a cubic spline\nis used to interpolate between these points. The amplitudes for P-wave and\nD-wave intermediate states are modeled as spin-dependent Breit-Wigner\nresonances. GooFit uses the Thrust library, with a CUDA backend for NVIDIA GPUs\nand an OpenMP backend for threads with conventional CPUs. Performance on a\nvariety of platforms is compared. Executing on systems with GPUs is typically a\nfew hundred times faster than executing the same algorithm on a single CPU.\n", "  We investigate the effect of quenched surface disorder on effective\ninteractions between two planar surfaces immersed in fluids which are near\ncriticality and belong to the Ising bulk universality class. We consider the\ncase that, in the absence of random surface fields, the surfaces of the film\nbelong to the surface universality class of the so-called ordinary transition.\nWe find analytically that in the linear weak-coupling regime, i.e., upon\nincluding the mean-field contribution and Gaussian fluctuations, the presence\nof random surface fields with zero mean leads to an attractive,\ndisorder-induced contribution to the critical Casimir interactions between the\ntwo confining surfaces. Our analytical, field-theoretic results are compared\nwith corresponding Monte Carlo simulation data.\n", "  We use the gauge gravity correspondence to study the renormalization group\nflow of a double trace fermionic operator in a quark-gluon plasma subject to\nthe influence of a strong magnetic field and compare it with the results for\nthe case at zero temperature and no magnetic field, where the flow between two\nfixed points is observed. Our results show that the energy necessary to access\nthe physics of the ultraviolet theory increases with the intensity of the\nmagnetic field under which the processes happen. We provide arguments to\nsupport that this increase is scheme independent, and to exhibit further\nevidence we do a very simple calculation showing that the dimensional reduction\nexpected in the gauge theory in this scenario is effective up to an energy\nscale that grows with the strength of such a background field. We also show\nthat independently of the renormalization scheme, the coupling of the double\ntrace operators in the ultraviolet fixed point increases with the intensity of\nthe background field. These effects combined can change both, the processes\nthat are expected to be involved in a collision experiment at a given energy\nand the azimuthal anisotropy of the measurements resulting of them.\n", "  Three related analyses of $\\phi^4$ theory with $O(N)$ symmetry are presented.\nIn the first, we review the $O(N)$ model over the $p$-adic numbers and the\ndiscrete renormalization group transformations which can be understood as spin\nblocking in an ultrametric context. We demonstrate the existence of a\nWilson-Fisher fixed point using an $\\epsilon$ expansion, and we show how to\nobtain leading order results for the anomalous dimensions of low dimension\noperators near the fixed point. Along the way, we note an important aspect of\nultrametric field theories, which is a non-renormalization theorem for kinetic\nterms. In the second analysis, we employ large $N$ methods to establish\nformulas for anomalous dimensions which are valid equally for field theories\nover the $p$-adic numbers and field theories on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Results for\nanomalous dimensions agree between the first and second analyses when they can\nbe meaningfully compared. In the third analysis, we consider higher derivative\nversions of the $O(N)$ model on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the simplest of which has been\nstudied in connection with spatially modulated phases. Our general formula for\nanomalous dimensions can still be applied. Analogies with two-derivative\ntheories hint at the existence of some interesting unconventional field\ntheories in four real Euclidean dimensions.\n", "  Motivated by the formula, due to Bourgain, Brezis and Mironescu,\n\\begin{equation*}\n  \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0^+} \\int_\\Omega\\int_\\Omega\n\\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^q}{|x-y|^q}\\,\\rho_\\varepsilon(x-y)\\,dx\\,dy=K_{q,N}\\|\\nabla\nu\\|_{L^{q}}^q\\,, \\end{equation*} that characterizes the functions in $L^q$ that\nbelong to $W^{1,q}$ (for $q>1$) and $BV$ (for $q=1$), respectively, we study\nwhat happens when one replaces the denominator in the expression above by\n$|x-y|$. It turns out that, for $q>1$ the corresponding functionals \"see\" only\nthe jumps of the $BV$ function. We further identify the function space relevant\nto the study of these functionals, the space $BV^q$, as the Besov space\n$B^{1/q}_{q,\\infty}$. We show, among other things, that $BV^q(\\Omega)$ contains\nboth the spaces $BV(\\Omega)\\cap L^\\infty(\\Omega)$ and $W^{1/q,q}(\\Omega)$. We\nalso present applications to the study of singular perturbation problems of\nAviles-Giga type.\n", "  Microwave parametric amplifiers based on Josephson junctions have become a\nkey component of many quantum information experiments. One key limitation which\nhas not been well predicted by theory is the gain saturation behavior which\ndetermines its ability to process large amplitude signals. The typical\nexplanation for this behavior in phase-preserving amplifiers based on\nthree-wave mixing is pump depletion, in which the consumption of pump photons\nto produce amplification results in a reduction in gain. However, in this work\nwe present experimental data and theoretical calculations showing that the\nfourth-order Kerr nonlinearities inherent in the Josephson junctions are the\ndominant factor in the Josephson Parametric Converter (JPC). The Kerr-based\ntheory has the unusual property of causing saturation to both lower and higher\ngains, depending on bias conditions. This work presents a new methodology for\noptimizing device performance in the presence of Kerr nonlinearities while\nretaining device tunability, and points to the necessity of controlling\nhigher-order Hamiltonian terms to make further improvements in parametric\ndevices.\n", "  We consider a gas of $N$ bosons in a box with volume one interacting through\na two-body potential with scattering length of order $N^{-1}$ (Gross-Pitaevskii\nlimit). Assuming the (unscaled) potential to be sufficiently small, we show\nthat the ground state of the system and all states with relatively small\nexcitation energy exhibit complete Bose-Einstein condensation, with a uniform\n(i.e. $N$ independent) bound on the number of excitations.\n", "  Recent years have seen a surprising connection between the physics of\nscattering amplitudes and a class of mathematical objects--the positive\nGrassmannian, positive loop Grassmannians, tree and loop Amplituhedra--which\nhave been loosely referred to as \"positive geometries\". The connection between\nthe geometry and physics is provided by a unique differential form canonically\ndetermined by the property of having logarithmic singularities (only) on all\nthe boundaries of the space, with residues on each boundary given by the\ncanonical form on that boundary. In this paper we initiate an exploration of\n\"positive geometries\" and \"canonical forms\" as objects of study in their own\nright in a more general mathematical setting. We give a precise definition of\npositive geometries and canonical forms, introduce general methods for finding\nforms for more complicated positive geometries from simpler ones, and present\nnumerous examples of positive geometries in projective spaces, Grassmannians,\nand toric, cluster and flag varieties. We also illustrate a number of\nstrategies for computing canonical forms which yield interesting\nrepresentations for the forms associated with wide classes of positive\ngeometries, ranging from the simplest Amplituhedra to new expressions for the\nvolume of arbitrary convex polytopes.\n", "  Recent data on the deutron and $^3$He production in central Pb+Pb collisions\nat the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies measured by the NA49\ncollaboration are analyzed within the model of the three-fluid dynamics (3FD)\ncomplemented by the coalescence model for the light-fragment production. The\nsimulations are performed with different equations of state---with and without\ndeconfinement transition. It is found that scenarios with the deconfinement\ntransition are preferable for reproduction rapidity distributions of deuterons\nand $^3$He, the corresponding results well agree with the experimental data. At\nthe same time the calculated transverse-mass spectra of $^3$He at midrapidity\ndo not that nice agree with the experimental data. The latter apparently\nindicates that coalescence coefficients should be temperature and/or momentum\ndependent.\n", "  Hawking radiation, the spontaneous emission of thermal photons from an event\nhorizon, is one of the most intriguing and elusive predictions of field theory\nin curved spacetimes. A formally analogue phenomenon occurs at the supersonic\ntransition of a fluid: in this respect, ultracold gases stand out among the\nmost promising systems but the theoretical modelling of this effect has always\nbeen carried out in semiclassical approximation, borrowing part of the analysis\nfrom the gravitational analogy. Here we discuss the exact solution of a\none-dimensional Bose gas flowing against an obstacle, showing that spontaneous\nphonon emission (the analogue of Hawking radiation) is predicted without\nreference to the gravitational analogy. Long after the creation of the\nobstacle, the fluid settles into a stationary state displaying the emission of\nsound waves (phonons) in the upstream direction. A careful analysis shows that\na precise correspondence between this phenomenon and the spontaneous emission\nof radiation from an event horizon requires additional conditions to be met in\nfuture experiments aimed at identifying the occurrence of the Hawking-like\nmechanism in Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  Computing the inverse covariance matrix (or precision matrix) of large data\nvectors is crucial in weak lensing (and multi-probe) analyses of the large\nscale structure of the universe. Analytically computed covariances are\nnoise-free and hence straightforward to invert, however the model\napproximations might be insufficient for the statistical precision of future\ncosmological data. Estimating covariances from numerical simulations improves\non these approximations, but the sample covariance estimator is inherently\nnoisy, which introduces uncertainties in the error bars on cosmological\nparameters and also additional scatter in their best fit values. For future\nsurveys, reducing both effects to an acceptable level requires an unfeasibly\nlarge number of simulations.\n  In this paper we describe a way to expand the true precision matrix around a\ncovariance model and show how to estimate the leading order terms of this\nexpansion from simulations. This is especially powerful if the covariance\nmatrix is the sum of two contributions, $\\smash{\\mathbf{C} =\n\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}}$, where $\\smash{\\mathbf{A}}$ is well understood\nanalytically and can be turned off in simulations (e.g. shape-noise for cosmic\nshear) to yield a direct estimate of $\\smash{\\mathbf{B}}$. We test our method\nin mock experiments resembling tomographic weak lensing data vectors from the\nDark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telecope (LSST). For DES\nwe find that $400$ N-body simulations are sufficient to achive negligible\nstatistical uncertainties on parameter constraints. For LSST this is achieved\nwith $2400$ simulations. The standard covariance estimator would require\n>$10^5$ simulations to reach a similar precision. We extend our analysis to a\nDES multi-probe case finding a similar performance.\n", "  Chamseddine and Mukhanov showed that gravity and gauge theories could be\nunified in one geometric construction provided that a metricity condition is\nimposed on the vielbein. In this paper we are going to show that by enlarging\nthe gauge group we are able to unify Chern-Simons gauge theory and Chern-Simons\ngravity in 3-D space-time. Such unification leads to the quantization of the\ncoefficients for both Chern-Simons terms for compact groups but not for\nnon-compact groups. Moreover, it leads to a topological invariant quantity of\nthe 3 dimensional space-time manifold on which they are defined.\n", "  In both light optics and electron optics, the amplitude of a wave scattered\nby an object is an observable that is usually recorded in the form of an\nintensity distribution in a real space image or a diffraction image. In\ncontrast, retrieval of the phase of a scattered wave is a well-known challenge,\nwhich is usually approached by interferometric or numerical methods. In\nelectron microscopy, as a result of constraints in the lens setup, it is\nparticularly difficult to retrieve the phase of a diffraction image. Here, we\nuse a defocused beam generated by a nanofabricated hologram to form a reference\nwave that can be interfered with a diffracted beam. This setup provides an\nextended interference region with the sample wavefunction in the Fraunhofer\nplane. As a case study, we retrieve the phase of an electron vortex beam.\nBeyond this specific example, the approach can be used to retrieve the\nwavefronts of diffracted beams from a wide range of samples.\n", "  We study the statistical properties of an ensemble of weak gravitational\nwaves interacting nonlinearly in a flat space-time. We show that the resonant\nthree-wave interactions are absent and develop a theory for four-wave\ninteractions in a reduced case of a diagonal metric tensor. In this limit,\nwhere only one type of gravitational waves are present, we derive the\ninteraction Hamiltonian and consider the asymptotic regime of weak\ngravitational wave turbulence. Both direct and inverse cascades are found for\nthe energy and the wave action respectively, and the corresponding wave spectra\nare derived. The inverse cascade is characterized by a finite-time propagation\nof the metric excitations - a process similar to an explosive non-equilibrium\nBose-Einstein condensation, which provides an efficient mechanism to ironing\nout small-scale inhomogeneities. The direct cascade leads to an accumulation of\nthe radiation energy in the system. These processes might be important for\nunderstanding the early Universe where a background of weak nonlinear\ngravitational waves is expected.\n", "  The observed evolution of the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED)\nin NS X-ray Nova Aql X-1 during the rise phase of a bright FRED-type outburst\nin 2013 can be understood in the framework of thermal emission from\nunstationary accretion disc with temperature radial distribution transforming\nfrom a single-temperature blackbody emitting ring into the multi-colour\nirradiated accretion disc. SED evolution during the hard to soft X-ray state\ntransition looks curious, as it can not be repro- duced by the standard disc\nirradiation model with a single irradiation parameter for NUV, Optical and NIR\nspectral bands. NIR (NUV) band is correlated with soft (hard) X-ray flux\nchanges during the state transition interval, respectively. In our interpreta-\ntion, at the moment of X-ray state transition UV-emitting parts of the\naccretion disc are screened from direct X-ray illumination from the central\nsource and are heated primary by hard X-rays (E > 10 keV), scattered in the hot\ncorona or wind possibly formed above the optically-thick outer accretion flow;\nthe outer edge of multi-colour disc, which emits in Optical-NIR, can be heated\nprimary by direct X-ray illumination.\n  We point out that future simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of X-ray\nNova systems during the fast X-ray state transition interval are of great\nimportance, as it can serve as 'X-ray tomograph' to study physical conditions\nin outer regions of accretion flow. This can provide an effective tool to\ndirectly test the energy-dependent X-ray heating efficiency, vertical structure\nand accretion flow geometry in transient LMXBs.\n", "  We describe a fully generic implementation of two-body partial decay widths\nat the full one-loop level in the SARAH and SPheno framework compatible with\nmost supported models. It incorporates fermionic decays to a fermion and a\nscalar or a gauge boson as well as scalar decays into two fermions, two gauge\nbosons, two scalars or a scalar and a gauge boson. We present the relevant\ngeneric expressions for virtual and real corrections. Whereas wavefunction\ncorrections are determined from on-shell conditions, the parameters of the\nunderlying model are by default renormalised in a DR (or MS) scheme. However,\nthe user can also define model-specific counter-terms. As an example we discuss\nthe renormalisation of the electric charge in the Thomson limit for top-quark\ndecays in the standard model. One-loop induced decays are also supported. The\nframework additionally allows the addition of mass and mixing corrections\ninduced at higher orders for the involved external states. We explain our\nprocedure to cancel infra-red divergences for such cases, which is achieved\nthrough an infra-red counter-term taking into account corrected Goldstone boson\nvertices. We compare our results for sfermion, gluino and Higgs decays in the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) against the public codes SFOLD,\nFVSFOLD and HFOLD and explain observed differences. Radiative induced gluino\nand neutralino decays are compared against the original implementation in\nSPheno in the MSSM. We exactly reproduce the results of the code CNNDecays for\ndecays of neutralinos and charginos in R-parity violating models. The new\nversion SARAH 4.11.0 by default includes the calculation of two-body decay\nwidths at the full one-loop level. Current limitations for certain model\nclasses are described.\n", "  We generalize Thouless bandwidth formula to its n-th moment. We obtain a\nclosed expression in terms of polygamma, zeta and Euler numbers.\n", "  [Abridged] The Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) is the new 64-m dish operated\nby INAF (Italy). Its active surface will allow us to observe at frequencies of\nup to 116 GHz. At the moment, three receivers, one per focal position, have\nbeen installed and tested. The SRT was officially opened in October 2013, upon\ncompletion of its technical commissioning phase. In this paper, we provide an\noverview of the main science drivers for the SRT, describe the main outcomes\nfrom the scientific commissioning of the telescope, and discuss a set of\nobservations demonstrating the SRT's scientific capabilities. One of the main\nobjectives of scientific commissioning was the identification of deficiencies\nin the instrumentation and/or in the telescope sub-systems for further\noptimization. As a result, the overall telescope performance has been\nsignificantly improved. As part of the scientific commissioning activities,\ndifferent observing modes were tested and validated, and first astronomical\nobservations were carried out to demonstrate the science capabilities of the\nSRT. In addition, we developed astronomer-oriented software tools, to support\nfuture observers on-site. The astronomical validation activities were\nprioritized based on technical readiness and scientific impact. The highest\npriority was to make the SRT available for joint observations as part of\nEuropean networks. As a result, the SRT started to participate (in shared-risk\nmode) in EVN (European VLBI Network) and LEAP (Large European Array for\nPulsars) observing sessions in early 2014. The validation of single-dish\noperations for the suite of SRT first light receivers and backends continued in\nthe following years, and was concluded with the first call for\nshared-risk/early-science observations issued at the end of 2015.\n", "  Unstable spin-1 particles are properly described by including absorptive\ncorrections to the electromagnetic vertex and propagator, without breaking the\nelectromagnetic gauge invariance. We show that the modified propagator can be\nset into a complex mass form, provided the mass and the width parameters, which\nare properly defined at the pole position, are replaced by energy dependent\nfunctions fulfilling the same requirements at the pole. We exemplify the case\nfor the $K^*(892)$ vector meson, where the mass function deviates around 2 MeV\nfrom the $K\\pi$ threshold to the pole position. The absorptive correction\ndepends on the mass of the particles in the loop. For vector mesons, whose main\ndecay is into two pseudoscalar mesons ($PP'$), the flavor symmetry breaking\ninduces a correction to the longitudinal part of the propagator. Considering\nthe $\\tau^- \\to K_S\\pi^-\\nu_\\tau$ decay, we illustrate these corrections by\nobtaining the modified vector and scalar form factors. The $K_S\\pi^-$ spectrum\nis described considering the $K^*(892)$ and $K^{'*}(1410)$ vectors and one\nscalar particle. Nonetheless, for this case, the correction to the scalar form\nfactor is found to be negligible.\n", "  The advent of microcontrollers with enough CPU power and with analog and\ndigital peripherals makes possible to design a complete particle detector with\nrelative acquisition system around one microcontroller chip. The existence of a\nworld wide data infrastructure as internet allows for devising a distributed\nnetwork of cheap detectors capable to elaborate and send data or respond to\nsettings commands. The internet infrastructure enables to distribute the\nabsolute time (with precision of few milliseconds), to the simple devices far\napart, with few milliseconds precision, from a few meters to thousands of\nkilometres. So it is possible to create a crowdsourcing experiment of citizen\nscience that use small scintillation-based particle detectors to monitor the\nhigh energetic cosmic ray and the radiation environment.\n", "  We present a systematic introduction to the diagrammatic method for practical\ncalculations in inflationary cosmology, based on Schwinger-Keldysh path\nintegral formalism. We show in particular that the diagrammatic rules can be\nderived directly from a classical Lagrangian even in the presence of derivative\ncouplings. Furthermore, we use quasi-single-field inflation as an example to\nshow how this formalism, combined with the trick of mixed propagator, can\nsignificantly simplify the calculation of some in-in correlation functions. The\nresulting bispectrum includes the lighter scalar case ($m<3H/2$) that has been\npreviously studied, and the heavier scalar case ($m>3H/2$) that has not been\nexplicitly computed for this model. The latter provides a concrete example of\nquantum primordial standard clocks, in which the clock signals can be\nobservably large.\n", "  We report branching fraction measurements of the decays\n$B^+\\to\\eta\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ and $B^+\\to\\eta^\\prime\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ based on\n711~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected near the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the\nBelle experiment at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. This data\nsample contains 772 million $B\\bar B$~events. One of the two $B$~mesons is\nfully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode. Among the remaining\n(\"signal-$B$\") daughters, we search for the $\\eta$~meson in two decay channels,\n$\\eta\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ and $\\eta\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$, and reconstruct the\n$\\eta^{\\prime}$~meson in $\\eta^\\prime\\to\\eta\\pi^+\\pi^-$ with subsequent decay\nof the $\\eta$ into $\\gamma\\gamma$. Combining the two $\\eta$ modes and using an\nextended maximum likelihood, the $B^+\\to\\eta\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ branching fraction\nis measured to be $(4.2\\pm 1.1 (\\rm stat.)\\pm 0.3 (\\rm syst.))\\times 10^{-5}$.\nFor $B^+\\to\\eta^\\prime\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$, we observe no significant signal and set\nan upper limit of $0.72\\times 10^{-4}$ at 90\\% confidence level.\n", "  We have investigated the properties of quarkonia in a thermal QCD medium in\nthe background of strong magnetic field. For that purpose, we employ the\nSchwinger proper-time quark propagator in the lowest Landau level to calculate\nthe one-loop gluon self-energy, which in the sequel gives the the effective\ngluon propagator. As an artifact of strong magnetic field approximation\n($eB>>T^2$ and $eB>>m^2$), the Debye mass for massless flavors is found to\ndepend only on the magnetic field which is the dominant scale in comparison to\nthe scales prevalent in the thermal medium. However, for physical quark masses,\nit depends on both magnetic field and temperature in a low temperature and high\nmagnetic field but the temperature dependence is very meagre and becomes\nindependent of temperature beyond a certain temperature and magnetic field.\nWith the above mentioned ingredients, the potential between heavy quark ($Q$)\nand anti-quark ($\\bar Q$) is obtained in a hot QCD medium in the presence of\nstrong magnetic field by correcting both short and long range components of the\npotential in real-time formalism. It is found that the long range part of the\nquarkonium potential is affected much more by magnetic field as compared to the\nshort range part. This observation facilitates us to estimate the magnetic\nfield beyond which the potential will be too weak to bind $Q\\bar Q$ together.\nFor example, the $J/\\psi$ is dissociated at $eB \\sim$ 10 $m_\\pi^2$ and\n$\\Upsilon$ is dissociated at $eB \\sim$ 100 $m_\\pi^2$ whereas its excited\nstates, $\\psi^\\prime$ and $\\Upsilon^\\prime$ are dissociated at smaller magnetic\nfield $eB= m_\\pi^2$, $13 m_\\pi^2$, respectively.\n", "  Instanton partition functions of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ 5d Super Yang-Mills reduced\non $S^1$ can be engineered in type IIB string theory from the $(p,q)$-branes\nweb diagram. To this diagram is superimposed a web of representations of the\nDing-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra that acts on the partition function. In this\ncorrespondence, each segment is associated to a representation, and the\n(topological string) vertex is identified with the intertwiner operator\nconstructed by Awata, Feigin and Shiraishi. We define a new intertwiner acting\non the representation spaces of levels $(1,n)\\otimes(0,m)\\to(1,n+m)$, thereby\ngeneralizing to higher rank $m$ the original construction. It allows us to use\na folded version of the usual $(p,q)$-web diagram, bringing great\nsimplifications to actual computations. As a result, the characterization of\nGaiotto states and vertical intertwiners, previously obtained by some of the\nauthors, is uplifted to operator relations acting in the Fock space of\nhorizontal representations. We further develop a method to build qq-characters\nof linear quivers based on the horizontal action of DIM elements. While\nfundamental qq-characters can be built using the coproduct, higher ones require\nthe introduction of a (quantum) Weyl reflection acting on tensor products of\nDIM generators.\n", "  Chiral potentials are derived for the interactions between Goldstone bosons\nand pseudoscalar charmed mesons up to next-to-next-to-leading order in a\ncovariant chiral effective field theory with explicit vector charmed-meson\ndegrees of freedom. Using the extended-on-mass-shell scheme, we demonstrate\nthat the ultraviolet divergences and the so-called power counting breaking\nterms can be properly absorbed by the low-energy constants of the chiral\nLagrangians. We calculate the scattering lengths by unitarizing the one-loop\npotentials and fit them to the data extracted from lattice QCD. The obtained\nresults are compared to the ones without an explicit contribution of vector\ncharmed mesons given previously. It is found that the difference is negligible\nfor $S$-wave scattering in the threshold region. This validates the use of\n$D^\\ast$-less one-loop potentials in the study of the pertinent scattering\nlengths. We search for dynamically generated open-charm states with $J^P=0^+$\nas poles of the $S$-matrix on various Riemann sheets. The trajectories of those\npoles for varying pion masses are presented as well.\n", "  The study of low regularity (in-)extendibility of Lorentzian manifolds is\nmotivated by the question whether a given solution to the Einstein equations\ncan be extended (or is maximal) as a weak solution. In this paper we show that\na timelike complete and globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold is\n$C^0$-inextendible. For the proof we make use of the result, recently\nestablished by S\\\"amann [17], that even for \\emph{continuous} Lorentzian\nmanifolds that are globally hyperbolic, there exists a length-maximizing causal\ncurve between any two causally related points.\n", "  The interpretation of the new effect of the superfluidity in reactions with\nsmall number of particles is discussed in a simple model where the exact\nsolution is accessible. It is find that the fluctuations of observable with the\ngauge angle reproduce well the exact fluctuations. Then a method of projection\nis proposed and tested to determine the transfer probabilities between two\nsuperfluid systems.\n", "  We compute the off-shell 1-loop tadpole amplitude in heterotic string field\ntheory. With a special choice of cubic vertex, we show that this amplitude can\nbe computed exactly. We obtain explicit and elementary expressions for the\nFeynman graph decomposition of the moduli space, the local coordinate map at\nthe puncture as a function of the modulus, and the $b$-ghost insertions needed\nfor the integration measure. Recently developed homotopy algebra methods\nprovide a consistent configuration of picture changing operators. We discuss\nthe consequences of spurious poles for the choice of picture changing\noperators.\n", "  The Hall resistance obtained in liquid gated Hall effect measurement of\ngraphene demonstrates a higher sensitivity than the sheet resistance and the\ngate-source current for L-histidine of different concentrations in the pM\nrange. This indicates that the extra information offered by the liquid gated\nHall measurement of graphene can improve the sensitivity of the\ntransistor-based potentiometric biosensors, and it could also be a\nsupplementary method to the amperometric techniques for electrochemically\ninactive molecules. Further analysis of the system suggests that the asymmetry\nof the electron-hole mobility induced by the ions in the liquid serves as the\nsensing mechanism. The calculation on the capacitance values shows that the\nquantum capacitance is only dominant near the \"Dirac\" point in our system. This\nconclusion is useful for many applications involving graphene-electrolyte\nsystems, such as bio-sensing, energy storage, neural stimulation, and so on.\n", "  The spatial dependence of magnetic fields in simple configurations is an\nusual topic in introductory electromagnetism lessons, both in high school and\nin university courses. In typical experiments, magnetic fields are obtained\ntaking point-by-point values using a Hall sensor and distances are measured\nusing a ruler. Here, we show how to take advantage of the smartphone\ncapabilities to get simultaneous measures with the built-in accelerometer and\nmagnetometer and to obtain the spatial dependence of magnetic fields. We\nconsider a simple set up consisting of a smartphone mounted on a track whose\ndirection coincides with the axis of a coil. While the smartphone is smoothly\naccelerated, both the magnetic field and the distance from the center of the\ncoil (integrated numerically from the acceleration values) are simultaneously\nobtained. This methodology can be easily extended to more complicated setups.\n", "  We introduce the quantum dimer-pentamer model (QDPM) on the square lattice.\nThis model is a generalization of the square lattice quantum dimer model as its\nconfiguration space comprises fully-packed hard-core dimer coverings as well as\ndimer configurations containing pentamers, where four dimers touch a vertex.\nThus in the QDPM, the fully-packed, hard-core constraint of the quantum dimer\nmodel is relaxed such that the local dimer number at each vertex is fixed\nmodulo 3, resulting in an exact local $Z_3$ gauge symmetry. We construct a\nlocal Hamiltonian for which the Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) equal superposition state\nis the exact ground state and has a 9-fold topological degeneracy on the torus.\nUsing Monte Carlo calculations, we find no spontaneous symmetry breaking in the\nRK wavefunction and that its dimer-dimer correlation function decays\nexponentially. By doping the QDPM RK state with a pair of monomers, we\ndemonstrate that $Z_3$ electric charges are deconfined. Additionally, we\nintroduce a $Z_3$ magnetic string operator that we find decays exponentially\nand shows no signatures of magnetic vortex condensation and with correlations.\nThese numerical results suggest that the ground state of the QDPM is a dimer\nliquid with $Z_3$ topological order.\n", "  Recent developments in quantum gravity have shown the Lorentzian treatment to\nbe a fruitful approach towards the emergence of macroscopic spacetimes. In this\npaper, we discuss another related aspect of the Lorentzian treatment: we argue\nthat collective quantum coherence may provide a simple mechanism for\nhighlighting symmetric configurations over generic non-symmetric ones. After\npresenting the general framework of the mechanism, we show the phenomenon in\nsome concrete simple examples in the randomly connected tensor network, which\nis tightly related to a certain model of quantum gravity, i.e., the canonical\ntensor model. We find large peaks at configurations invariant under Lie-group\nsymmetries as well as a preference for charge quantization, even in the Abelian\ncase. In future study, this simple mechanism may provide a way to analyze the\nemergence of macroscopic spacetimes with global symmetries as well as various\nother symmetries existing in nature, which are usually postulated.\n", "  In order to answer the question on how much the trilinear Higgs self-coupling\ncould deviate from its Standard Model value in weakly coupled models, we study\nboth theoretical and phenomenological constraints. As a first step, we discuss\nthis question by modifying the Standard Model using effective operators.\nConsidering constraints from vacuum stability and perturbativity, we show that\nonly the latter can be reliably assessed in a model-independent way. We then\nfocus on UV models which receive constraints from Higgs coupling measurements,\nelectroweak precision tests, vacuum stability and perturbativity. We find that\nthe interplay of current measurements with perturbativity already exclude\nself-coupling modifications above a factor of few with respect to the Standard\nModel value.\n", "  We obtain finite-temperature M2 black branes in 11-dimensional supergravity,\nin a $G_4$-flux background whose self-dual part approaches a solution of\nCveti\\v{c}, Gibbons, L\\\"u, and Pope, based upon Stenzel's family of Ricci-flat\nK\\\"ahler deformed cones. Our solutions are asymptotically $AdS_4$ times a\n7-dimensional Stiefel manifold $V_{5,2}$, and the branes are ``smeared'' to\nretain $SO(5)$ symmetry in the internal space. The solutions represent a mass\ndeformation of the corresponding dual $CFT_3$, whose full description is at\nthis time only partially-understood. We investigate the possibility of a\nconfinement/de-confinement phase transition analogous to the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$\ncase, and a possible Gregory-Laflamme type instability which could lead to\npolarised brane solutions which break $SO(5)$. We discuss possible consequences\nfor AdS/CFT and the KKLT cosmological uplift mechanism.\n", "  Inspired by the newly observed $\\Omega_c^0$ states at LHCb, we decode their\nproperties by performing an analysis of mass spectrum and decay behavior. Our\nstudies show that the five narrow states, i.e., $\\Omega_c(3000)^0$,\n$\\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3090)^0$, and\n$\\Omega_c(3119)^0$, could be grouped into the $1P$ states with negative parity.\nAmong them, the $\\Omega_c(3000)^0$ and $\\Omega_c(3090)^0$ states could be the\n$J^P=1/2^-$ candidates, while $\\Omega_c(3050)^0$ and $\\Omega_c(3119)^0$ are\nsuggested as the $J^P=3/2^-$ states. $\\Omega_c(3066)^0$ could be regarded as a\n$J^P=5/2^-$ state. Since the the spin-parity, the electromagnetic transitions,\nand the possible hadronic decay channels $\\Omega_c^{(\\ast)}\\pi$ have not been\nmeasured yet, other explanations are also probable for these narrow\n$\\Omega_c^0$ states. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of the broad\nstructure $\\Omega_c(3188)^0$ as a $2S$ state with $J^P=1/2^+$ or $J^P=3/2^+$.\nIn our scheme, $\\Omega_c(3119)^0$ cannot be a $2S$ candidate.\n", "  In light of the present LHC Run II at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ $TeV$, string y\nstandard-like model is studied. Concretely, a singlet $S $ scalar-extended SM\ngiven in terms four stacks of intersecting D6-branes in a type IIA superstring\ncompactification producing a large gauge symmetry is examined. The involved\nscales are dealt with. According to the dark matter relic density, the mass of\nthe scalar dark matter beyond the SM $m_{S}\\lesssim 10^{3}GeV$ and the\ncorresponding Higgs portal couplings $\\lambda _{SH}\\lesssim 10^{-8}$ are\napproached.\n", "  By incorporating market impact and momentum traders into an agent-based\nmodel, we investigate the conditions for the occurrence of self-reinforcing\nfeedback loops and the coevolutionary mechanism of prices and strategies. For\nlow market impact, the price fluctuations are originally large. The existence\nof momentum traders has little impact on the change of price fluctuations but\ndestroys the equilibrium between the trend-following and trend-rejecting\nstrategies. The trend-following herd behaviors become dominant. A\nself-reinforcing feedback loop exists. For high market impact, the existence of\nmomentum traders leads to an increase in price fluctuations. The\ntrend-following strategies of rational individuals are suppressed while the\ntrend-following strategies of momentum traders are promoted. The\ncrowd-anticrowd behaviors become dominant. A negative feedback loop exists. A\ntheoretical analysis indicates that, for low market impact, the majority effect\nis beneficial for the trend-followers to earn more, which in turn promotes the\ntrend-following strategies. For high market impact, the minority effect causes\nthe trend-followers to suffer great losses, which in turn suppresses the\ntrend-following strategies.\n", "  In a many-body localized (MBL) quantum system, the ergodic hypothesis breaks\ndown completely, giving rise to a fundamentally new many-body phase. Whether\nand under which conditions MBL can occur in higher dimensions remains an\noutstanding challenge both for experiments and theory. Here, we experimentally\nexplore the relaxation dynamics of an interacting gas of fermionic potassium\natoms loaded in a two-dimensional optical lattice with different quasi-periodic\npotentials along the two directions. We observe a dramatic slowing down of the\nrelaxation for intermediate disorder strengths and attribute this partially to\nconfigurational rare-region effects. Beyond a critical disorder strength, we\nsee negligible relaxation on experimentally accessible timescales, indicating a\npossible transition into a two-dimensional MBL phase. Our experiments reveal a\ndistinct interplay of interactions, disorder, and dimensionality and provide\ninsights into regimes where controlled theoretical approaches are scarce.\n", "  In this paper, we use the Fokas method to analyze the complex\nSharma-Tasso-Olver(cSTO) equation on the half line. We show that it can be\nrepresented in terms of the solution of a matrix RHP formulated in the plane of\nthe complex spectral parameter {\\lambda}.\n", "  Spin-orbit interaction is investigated in a dual gated InAs/GaSb quantum\nwell. Using an electric field the quantum well can be tuned between a single\ncarrier regime with exclusively electrons as carriers and a two-carriers regime\nwhere electrons and holes coexist. Spin-orbit interaction in both regimes\nmanifests itself as a beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. In the\nsingle carrier regime the linear Dresselhaus strength is characterized by\n$\\beta =$ 28.5 meV$\\AA$ and the Rashba coefficient $\\alpha$ is tuned from 75 to\n53 meV$\\AA$ by changing the electric field. In the two-carriers regime the spin\nsplitting shows a nonmonotonic behavior with gate voltage, which is consistent\nwith our band structure calculations.\n", "  The decay rate of a false vacuum is studied in gauge theory, paying\nparticular attention to its gauge invariance. Although the decay rate should\nnot depend on the gauge parameter $\\xi$ according to the Nielsen identity, the\ngauge invariance of the result of a perturbative calculation has not been\nclearly shown. We give a prescription to perform a one-loop calculation of the\ndecay rate, with which a manifestly gauge-invariant expression of the decay\nrate is obtained. We also discuss the renormalization necessary to make the\nresult finite, and show that the decay rate is independent of the gauge\nparameter even after the renormalization.\n", "  Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics is undoubtedly a cornerstone for the\ndescription of many particle systems. The common interpretation is based on\nensemble theory as put forward by Gibbs, alongside the basic assumptions that\ndifferent ensembles are equivalent, i.~e.\\ the properties of the system can\nequally be obtained in any ensemble with the same results. However, the\nsimplicity of the argument that provides such equivalence, mathematically\ngrounded by the existence of Legendre transformation between the ensembles and\nthe existence of its inverse, may break down for physical systems with long\nrange interactions. In this paper we study the behavior of a simple toy model\nwith a long range interaction and show from first principles, by solving\nnumerically the mechanical equations of motion and Monte Carlo simulations, the\ninequivalence of ensembles, and discuss in what situations and how the Maxwell\nconstruction is applicable.\n", "  We evaluate the corrections of the two-photon exchange (TPE) process on the\n$\\gamma^* N\\Delta$ transition form factors. The contributions of the TPE\nprocess to the $eN\\rightarrow e\\Delta(1232)\\rightarrow eN\\pi$ are calculated in\na hadronic model with the inclusion of only the elastic nucleon intermediate\nstates, to estimate its effects on the multipoles $M^{(3/2)}_{1^+},\nE^{(3/2)}_{1^+}, S^{(3/2)}_{1^+}$ at the $\\Delta$ peak. We find that TPE\neffects on $G^*_M$ is very small. $G^*_E,$ and $ G^*_C$ are also little\naffected at small $Q^2 $. For $G^*_E$, the TPE effects reach about $3 - 8\\%$\nnear $Q^2\\sim 4$ GeV$^2$, depending on the model, MAID or SAID, used to emulate\nthe data. For $G^*_C$, the TPE effects decrease rapidly with increasing\n$\\epsilon$ while growing with increasing $Q^2$ to reach $\\sim 6 - 15\\%$ with\n$Q^2 \\sim 4$ GeV$^2$ at $\\epsilon = 0.2$. Sizeable TPE corrections to $G^*_E$\nand $G^*_C$ found here points to the need of including TPE effects in the\nmultipole analysis in the region of high $Q^2$ and small $\\epsilon$. The TPE\ncorrections to $R_{EM}$ and $R_{SM}$ obtained in our hadronic calculation are\ncompared with those obtained in a partonic calculation for moderate momentum\ntransfer of $2<Q^2<4$ GeV$^2$.\n", "  We study cosmological inflation in the Einstein gravity model, where\nadditionally the Gauss-Bonnet term non-minimally coupled to a scalar field is\nincluded. We prove that inflationary solutions of exponential and power-law\ntypes are allowable and we found few examples of them. We also proposed the\nmethod of the exact inflationary solutions construction for a single scalar\nfield with given scale factor and Gauss-Bonnet coupling term in the spatially\nflat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe on the basis of connection with\nstandard inflation and using special anzatses. With one special anzats we\npresented the system of equations in the form which allowed generation of exact\nsolutions (at least in quadratures) of wide class by setting the scale factor.\n", "  Physics based analytic equations for charge carrier profile and current\ndensity are derived by solving the carrier transport and the continuity\nequations for metal-intrinsic semiconductor-metal diodes. Using the analytic\nmodels a physics based method is developed to extract the built-in potential\n$V_{bi}$ from current density-voltage ($J$-$V$) characteristics. The proposed\nmethod is thoroughly validated using numerical simulation results. After\nverifying the applicability of the proposed theory on experimentally fabricated\norganic diodes, $V_{bi}$ is extracted using the present method showing a good\nagreement with the reported value.\n", "  We overview the current status of theoretical approaches for heavy-ion fusion\nreactions at subbarrier energies. We particularly discuss theoretical\nchallenges in the coupled-channels approach, that include i) a description of\ndeep subbarrier hindrance of fusion cross sections, ii) the role of nuclear\ndissipation, iii) fusion of unstable nuclei, and iv) an interplay between\nfusion and multi-nucleon transfer processes. We also present results of a\nsemi-microscopic approach to heavy-ion fusion reactions, that combines the\ncoupled-channels approach with state-of-the-art microscopic nuclear structure\ncalculations.\n", "  We consider the dark matter (DM) scenario in the context of the classically\nconformal U(1)' extended standard model (SM), with three right-handed neutrinos\n(RHNs) and the U(1)' Higgs field. The model is free from all the U(1)' gauge\nand gravitational anomalies in the presence of the three RHNs. We introduce a\n$Z_2$-parity in the model, under which an odd-parity is assigned to one RHN,\nwhile all the other particles is assigned to be $Z_2$-even, and hence the\n$Z_2$-odd RHN serves as a DM candidate. In this model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry\nis radiatively broken through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, by which the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking is triggered. There are three free parameters in\nour model, the U(1)' charge of the SM Higgs doublet ($x_H$), the new U(1)'\ngauge coupling ($g_X$), and the U(1)' gauge boson ($Z'$) mass ($m_{Z'}$), which\nare severely constrained in order to solve the electroweak vacuum instability\nproblem, and satisfy the LHC Run-2 bounds from the search for $Z'$ boson\nresonance. In addition to these constraints, we investigate the RHN DM physics.\nBecause of the nature of classical conformality, we find that a RHN DM pair\nmainly annihilates into the SM particles through the $Z'$ boson exchange. This\nis the so-called $Z'$-portal DM scenario. Combining the electroweak vacuum\nstability condition, the LHC Run-2 bounds, and the cosmological constraint from\nthe observed DM relic density, we find that all constrains complementarily work\nto narrow down the allowed parameter regions, and, especially, exclude $m_{Z'}\n\\lesssim 3.5$ TeV. For the obtained allowed regions, we calculate the\nspin-independent cross section of the RHN DM with nucleons. We find that the\nresultant cross section well below the current experimental upper bounds.\n", "  This comment is dedicated to the investigation of many-body localization in a\nquantum Ising model with long-range power law interactions, $r^{-\\alpha}$,\nrelevant for a variety of systems ranging from electrons in Anderson insulators\nto spin excitations in chains of cold atoms. It has been earlier argued [1, 2]\nthat this model obeys the dimensional constraint suggesting the delocalization\nof all finite temperature states in thermodynamic limit for $\\alpha \\leq 2d$ in\na $d$-dimensional system. This expectation conflicts with the recent numerical\nstudies of the specific interacting spin model in Ref. [3]. To resolve this\ncontroversy we reexamine the model of Ref. [3] and demonstrate that the\ninfinite temperature states there obey the dimensional constraint. The earlier\ndeveloped scaling theory for the critical system size required for\ndelocalization [2] is extended to small exponents $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq d$.\nDisagreements between two works are explained by the non-standard selection of\ninvestigated states in the ordered phase and misinterpretation of the\nlocalization-delocalization transition in Ref. [3].\n", "  Cosmic-ray anti-deuterium and anti-helium have long been suggested as probes\nof dark matter, as their secondary astrophysical production was thought\nextremely scarce. But how does one actually predict the secondary flux?\nAnti-nuclei are dominantly produced in pp collisions, where laboratory cross\nsection data is lacking. We make a new attempt at tackling this problem by\nappealing to a scaling law of nuclear coalescence with the physical volume of\nthe hadronic emission region. The same volume is probed by Hanbury Brown-Twiss\n(HBT) two-particle correlations. We demonstrate the consistency of the scaling\nlaw with systems ranging from central and off-axis AA collisions to pA\ncollisions, spanning 3 orders of magnitude in coalescence yield. Extending the\nvolume scaling to the pp system, HBT data allows us to make a new estimate of\ncoalescence, that we test against preliminary ALICE pp data. For anti-helium\nthe resulting cross section is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than earlier\nestimates. The astrophysical secondary flux of anti-helium could be within\nreach of a five-year exposure of AMS02.\n", "  We consider a chiral cosmological model in the framework of\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology. Using a decomposition of the latter equations\nin such a way that the first chiral field is responsible for the Einstein part\nof the model, while the second field together with the kinetic interaction is\nconnected with the Gauss--Bonnet part of the theory, we find new exact\nsolutions for the 2-component chiral cosmological model with and without the\nkinetic interaction between fields.\n", "  Machine learning is capable of discriminating phases of matter, and finding\nassociated phase transitions, directly from large data sets of raw state\nconfigurations. In the context of condensed matter physics, most progress in\nthe field of supervised learning has come from employing neural networks as\nclassifiers. Although very powerful, such algorithms suffer from a lack of\ninterpretability, which is usually desired in scientific applications in order\nto associate learned features with physical phenomena. In this paper, we\nexplore support vector machines (SVMs) which are a class of supervised kernel\nmethods that provide interpretable decision functions. We find that SVMs can\nlearn the mathematical form of physical discriminators, such as order\nparameters and Hamiltonian constraints, for a set of two-dimensional spin\nmodels: the ferromagnetic Ising model, a conserved-order-parameter Ising model,\nand the Ising gauge theory. The ability of SVMs to provide interpretable\nclassification highlights their potential for automating feature detection in\nboth synthetic and experimental data sets for condensed matter and other\nmany-body systems.\n", "  We review the recurrence intervals as a function of ground motion amplitude\nat several terrestrial locations, and make the first interplanetary comparison\nwith measurements on the Moon, Mars, Venus and Titan. This empirical approach\ngives an intuitive guide to the relative seismicity of these locations, without\ninvoking interior models and specific sources: for example a Venera-14\nobservation of possible ground motion indicates a microseismic environment\nmid-way between noisy and quiet terrestrial locations; quiet terrestrial\nregions see a peak velocity amplitude in mm/s roughly equal to 0.4*N(-0.7),\nwhere N is the number of events observed per year. The Apollo data show signals\nfor a given recurrence rate are typically about 10,000 times smaller in\namplitude than a quiet site on Earth, while Viking data masked for low-wind\nperiods appears comparable with a quiet terrestrial site. Recurrence rate plots\nfrom in-situ measurements provide a convenient guide to expectations for\nseismic instrumentation on future planetary missions : while small geophones\ncan discriminate terrestrial activity rates, observations with guidance\naccelerometers are typically too insensitive to provide meaningful constraints\nunless operated for long periods.\n", "  We propose the study of constant-roll inflation in $F(R)$ gravity. We use two\ndifferent approaches, one that relates an $F(R)$ gravity to well known scalar\nmodels of constant-roll and a second that examines directly the constant-roll\ncondition in $F(R)$ gravity. With regards to the first approach, by using well\nknown techniques, we find the $F(R)$ gravity which realizes a given\nconstant-roll evolution in the scalar-tensor theory. We also perform a\nconformal transformation in the resulting $F(R)$ gravity and we find the\nEinstein frame counterpart theory. As we demonstrate, the resulting scalar\npotential is different in comparison to the original scalar constant-roll case,\nand the same applies for the corresponding observational indices. Moreover, we\ndiscuss how cosmological evolutions that can realize constant-roll to\nconstant-roll eras transitions in the scalar-tensor description, can be\nrealized by vacuum $F(R)$ gravity. With regards to the second approach, we\nexamine directly the effects of the constant-roll condition on the inflationary\ndynamics of vacuum $F(R)$ gravity. We present in detail the formalism of\nconstant-roll $F(R)$ gravity inflationary dynamics and we discuss how the\ninflationary indices become in this case. We use two well known $F(R)$\ngravities in order to illustrate our findings, the $R^2$ model and a power-law\n$F(R)$ gravity in vacuum. As we demonstrate, in both cases the parameter space\nis enlarged in comparison to the slow-roll counterparts of the models, and in\neffect, the models can also be compatible with the observational data. Finally,\nwe briefly address the graceful exit issue.\n", "  We analyse the minima of scalar potentials for multi-Higgs models where the\nscalars are arranged as either one triplet or two triplets of the discrete\nsymmetries $A_4$, $S_4$, $\\Delta(27)$, $\\Delta(54)$, as well as $\\Delta(3n^2)$\nand $\\Delta(6n^2)$ with $n>3$. The results should be useful for both\nmulti-Higgs models involving electroweak doublets and multi-flavon models\ninvolving electroweak singlets, where in both cases the fields transform as\ntriplets under some non-Abelian discrete symmetry.\n", "  A nonlocal dispersive-optical-model analysis has been carried out for\nneutrons and protons in $^{48}$Ca. Elastic-scattering angular distributions,\ntotal and reaction cross sections, single-particle energies, the neutron and\nproton numbers, and the charge distribution have been fitted to extract the\nneutron and proton self-energies both above and below the Fermi energy. From\nthe single-particle propagator resulting from these self-energies we have\ndetermined the charge and neutron matter distributions in $^{48}$Ca. A neutron\nskin of 0.249$\\pm$0.023~fm is deduced. The energy dependence of the total\nneutron cross sections is shown to have strong sensitivity to the skin\nthickness.\n", "  Topological nodal-line semimetals are characterized by one-dimensional lines\nof band crossing in the Brillouin zone. In contrast to nodal points, nodal\nlines can be in topologically nontrivial configurations. In this paper, we\nstudy the simplest topologically nontrivial forms of nodal line, namely, a\nsingle nodal line taking the shape of a knot in the Brillouin zone. We\nintroduce a generic construction for various \"nodal-knot semimetals\", which\nyields the simplest trefoil nodal knot and other more complicated nodal knots\nin the Brillouin zone. The knotted-unknotted transitions by nodal-line\nreconnections are also studied. Our work brings the knot theory to the subject\nof topological semimetals.\n", "  The ground state multiplet structure for nuclei over the wide range of mass\nnumber $A$ was calculated in $\\delta$-approximation and different mass\nrelations for pairing energy was analysed in this work. Correlation between the\ncalculated multiplet structure and experimental data offer a guideline in\ndeciding between mass relations for nucleon pairing.\n", "  We study effective two- and three-body interactions between non-active\ncolloidal inclusions in an active bath of chiral or non-chiral particles, using\nBrownian Dynamics simulations within a standard, two-dimensional model of\ndisk-shaped inclusions and active particles. In a non-chiral active bath, we\nfirst corroborate previous findings on effective two-body repulsion mediated\nbetween the inclusions by elucidating the detailed non-monotonic features of\nthe two-body force profiles, including a primary maximum, and a secondary hump\nat larger separations that was not previously reported. We then show that these\nfeatures arise directly from the formation, and sequential overlaps, of\ncircular layers (or 'rings') of active particles around the inclusions, as the\nlatter are brought to small surface separations. These rings extend to radial\ndistances of a few active-particle radii from the surface of inclusions, giving\nthe hard-core inclusions relatively thick, soft, repulsive 'shoulders', whose\nmultiple overlaps then enable significant (non-pairwise) three-body forces in\nboth non-chiral and chiral active baths. The resulting three-body forces can\neven exceed the two-body forces in magnitude and display distinct repulsive and\nattractive regimes at intermediate to large self-propulsion strengths. In a\nchiral active bath, we show that, while active particles still tend to\naccumulate at the immediate vicinity of the inclusions, they exhibit strong\ndepletion from the intervening region between the inclusions, and partial\ndepletion from relatively thick, circular, zones further away from the\ninclusions. In this case, the effective, predominantly repulsive, interactions\nbetween the inclusions turn to active, chirality-induced, depletion-type\nattractions, acting over an extended range of separations.\n", "  We report measurements of optical absorption in the zig-zag antiferromagnet\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ as a function of temperature, $T$, magnetic field, $B$, and\nphoton energy, $\\hbar\\omega$ in the range $\\sim$ 0.3 to 8.3 meV, using\ntime-domain terahertz spectroscopy. Polarized measurements show that 3-fold\nrotational symmetry is broken in the honeycomb plane from 2 K to 300 K. We find\na sharp absorption peak at 2.56 meV upon cooling below the N\\'eel temperature\nof 7 K at $B=0$ that we identify as magnetic-dipole excitation of a\nzero-wavevector magnon, or antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR). With application\nof $B$, the AFMR broadens and shifts to lower frequency as long-range magnetic\norder is lost in a manner consistent with transitioning to a spin-disordered\nphase. From direct, internally calibrated measurement of the AFMR spectral\nweight, we place an upper bound on the contribution to the $dc$ susceptibility\nfrom a magnetic excitation continuum.\n", "  We find AdS5 solutions holographically dual to compactifications of\nsix-dimensional N=(1,0) supersymmetric field theories on Riemann surfaces with\npunctures. We simplify a previous analysis of supersymmetric AdS5 IIA\nsolutions, and with a suitable Ansatz we find explicit solutions organized in\nthree classes, where an O8--D8 stack, D6- and D4-branes are simultaneously\npresent, localized and partially localized. The D4-branes are smeared over the\nRiemann surface and this is interpreted as the presence of a uniform\ndistribution of punctures. For the first class we identify the corresponding\nsix-dimensional theory as an E-string theory coupled to a quiver gauge theory.\nThe second class of solutions lacks D6-branes and its central charge scales as\n$n^{5/2}$, suggesting a five-dimensional origin for the dual field theory. The\nlast class has elements of the previous two.\n", "  The electrostatic performance of p-type nanowires (NWs) made of InSb and\nGaSb, with special focus on their gate capacitance behavior, is analyzed and\ncompared to that achieved by traditional semiconductors usually employed for\np-MOS such as Si and Ge. To do so, a self-consistent kp simulator has been\nimplemented to achieve an accurate description of the Valence Band and evaluate\nthe charge behavior as a function of the applied gate bias. The contribution\nand role of the constituent capacitances, namely the insulator, centroid and\nquantum ones are assessed. It is demonstrated that the centroid and quantum\ncapacitances are strongly dependent on the semiconductor material. We find a\ngood inherent electrostatic performance of GaSb and InSb NWs, comparable to\ntheir Ge and Si counterparts making these III-Sb compounds good candidates for\nfuture technological nodes.\n", "  The copper oxides present the highest superconducting temperature and\nproperties at odds with other compounds, suggestive of a fundamentally\ndifferent superconductivity. In particular, the Abrikosov vortices fail to\nexhibit localized states expected and observed in all clean superconductors. We\nhave explored the possibility that the elusive vortex-core signatures are\nactually present but weak. Combining local tunneling measurements with\nlarge-scale theoretical modeling, we positively identify the vortex states in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\\delta}$. We explain their spectrum and the observed\nvariations thereof from one vortex to the next by considering the effects of\nnearby vortices and disorder in the vortex lattice. We argue that the\nsuperconductivity of copper oxides is conventional, but the spectroscopic\nsignature does not look so because the superconducting carriers are a minority.\n", "  The recent discovery of thousands of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in nearby\ngalaxy clusters has opened a new window into the process of galaxy formation\nand evolution. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the formation\nhistory of UDGs, and their ability to survive in the harsh cluster\nenvironments. A key requirement to distinguish between these scenarios is a\nmeasurement of their halo masses which, due to their low surface brightnesses,\nhas proven difficult if one relies on stellar tracers of the potential. We\nexploit weak gravitational lensing, a technique that does not depend on these\nbaryonic tracers, to measure the average subhalo mass of 784 UDGs selected in\n18 clusters at $z\\leq0.09$. Our sample of UDGs has a median stellar mass\n$\\langle m_\\star\\rangle=2\\times10^8\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and a median effective\nradius $\\langle r_\\mathrm{eff}\\rangle=2.8$ kpc. We constrain the average mass\nof subhaloes within 30 kpc to $\\log\nm_\\mathrm{UDG}(r<30\\,\\mathrm{kpc})/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot\\leq10.99$ at 95 per cent\ncredibility, implying an effective virial mass $\\log\nm_{200}/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot\\leq11.80$, and a lower limit on the stellar mass\nfraction within 10 kpc of 1.0 per cent. Such mass is consistent with a simple\nextrapolation of the subhalo-to-stellar mass relation of typical satellite\ngalaxies in massive clusters. However, our analysis is not sensitive to scatter\nabout this mean mass; the possibility remains that extreme UDGs reside in\nhaloes as massive as the Milky Way.\n", "  A communication game consists of distributed parties attempting to jointly\ncomplete a task with restricted communication. Such games are useful tools for\nstudying limitations of physical theories. A theory exhibits preparation\ncontextuality whenever its predictions cannot be explained by a preparation\nnoncontextual model. Here, we show that communication games performed in\noperational theories reveal the preparation contextuality of that theory. For\nstatistics obtained in a particular family of communication games, we show a\ndirect correspondance with correlations in space-like separated events obeying\nthe no-signaling principle. Using this, we prove that all mixed quantum states\nof any finite dimension are preparation contextual. We report on an\nexperimental realization of a communication game involving three-level quantum\nsystems from which we observe a strong violation of the constraints of\npreparation noncontextuality.\n", "  Progress in the development of coupled atomistic-continuum methods for\nsimulations of critical dynamic material behavior has been hampered by a\nspurious wave reflection problem at the atomistic-continuum interface. This\nproblem is mainly caused by the difference in material descriptions between the\natomistic and continuum models, which results in a mismatch in phonon\ndispersion relations. In this work, we introduce a new method based on\natomistic dynamics of lattice coupled with a concurrent atomistic-continuum\nmethod to enable a full phonon representation in the continuum description.\nThis then permits the passage of short-wavelength, high-frequency phonon waves\nfrom the atomistic to continuum regions. The benchmark examples presented in\nthis work demonstrate that the new scheme enables the passage of all allowable\nphonons through the atomistic-continuum interface; it also preserves the wave\ncoherency and energy conservation after phonons transport across multiple\natomistic-continuum interfaces. This work is the first step towards developing\na concurrent atomistic-continuum simulation tool for non-equilibrium\nphonon-mediated thermal transport in materials with microstructural complexity.\n", "  We identify an object previously thought to be a star in the disk of M31,\nJ0045+41, as a background $z\\approx0.215$ AGN seen through a low-absorption\nregion of M31. We present moderate resolution spectroscopy of J0045+41 obtained\nusing GMOS at Gemini-North. The spectrum contains features attributable to the\nhost galaxy. We model the spectrum to estimate the AGN contribution, from which\nwe estimate the luminosity and virial mass of the central engine. Residuals to\nour fit reveal a blue-shifted component to the broad H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ at\na relative velocity of $\\sim4800$ km s$^{-1}$. We also detect \\ion{Na}{1}\nabsorption in the Milky Way restframe. We search for evidence of periodicity\nusing $g$-band photometry from the Palomar Transient Factory and find evidence\nfor multiple periodicities ranging from $\\sim80-350$ days. Two of the detected\nperiods are in a 1:4 ratio, which is identical to the predictions of\nhydrodynamical simulations of binary supermassive black hole systems. If these\nsignals arise due to such a system, J0045+41 is well within the gravitational\nwave regime. We calculate the time until inspiral due to gravitational\nradiation, assuming reasonable values of the mass ratio of the two black holes.\nWe discuss the implications of our findings and forthcoming work to identify\nother such interlopers in the light of upcoming photometric surveys such as the\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)\nprojects.\n", "  Heterotic string compactifications on integrable $G_2$ structure manifolds\n$Y$ with instanton bundles $(V,A), (TY,\\tilde{\\theta})$ yield supersymmetric\nthree-dimensional vacua that are of interest in physics. In this paper, we\ndefine a covariant exterior derivative $\\cal D$ and show that it is equivalent\nto a heterotic $G_2$ system encoding the geometry of the heterotic string\ncompactifications. This operator $\\cal D$ acts on a bundle ${\\cal\nQ}=T^*Y\\oplus{\\rm End}(V)\\oplus{\\rm End}(TY)$ and satisfies a nilpotency\ncondition $\\check{\\cal D}^2=0$, for an appropriate projection of $\\cal D$.\nFurthermore, we determine the infinitesimal moduli space of these systems and\nshow that it corresponds to the finite-dimensional cohomology group $\\check\nH^1_{\\check{\\cal D}}(\\cal Q)$. We comment on the similarities and differences\nof our result with Atiyah's well-known analysis of deformations of holomorphic\nvector bundles over complex manifolds. Our analysis leads to results that are\nof relevance to all orders in the $\\alpha'$ expansion.\n", "  We present a recently developed theory for the inclusive breakup of\nthree-fragment projectiles within a four-body spectator model\n\\cite{CarPLB2017}, for the treatment of the elastic and inclusive non-elastic\nbreak up reactions involving weakly bound three-cluster nuclei in $A\\,(a,b)\\,X$\n/ $a = x_1 + x_2 + b$ collisions. The four-body theory is an extension of the\nthree-body approaches developed in the 80's by Ichimura, Autern and Vincent\n(IAV) \\cite{IAV1985}, Udagawa and Tamura (UT) \\cite{UT1981} and Hussein and\nMcVoy (HM) \\cite{HM1985}. We expect that experimentalists shall be encouraged\nto search for more information about the $x_{1} + x_{2}$ system in the elastic\nbreakup cross section and that also further developments and extensions of the\nsurrogate method will be pursued, based on the inclusive non-elastic breakup\npart of the $b$ spectrum.\n", "  We present a new technique for extracting decay and transition rates into\nfinal states with any number of hadrons. The approach is only sensitive to\ntotal rates, in which all out-states with a given set of QCD quantum numbers\nare included. For processes involving photons or leptons, differential rates\nwith respect to the non-hadronic kinematics may also be extracted. Our method\ninvolves constructing a finite-volume Euclidean four-point function, whose\ncorresponding spectral function measures the decay and transition rates in the\ninfinite-volume limit. This requires solving the inverse problem of extracting\nthe spectral function from the correlator and also necessitates a smoothing\nprocedure so that a well-defined infinite-volume limit exists. Both of these\nsteps are accomplished by the Backus-Gilbert method and, as we show with a\nnumerical example, reasonable precision can be expected in cases with multiple\nopen decay channels. Potential applications include nucleon structure functions\nand the onset of the deep inelastic scattering regime, as well as semi-leptonic\n$D$ and $B$ decay rates.\n", "  In this paper we introduce and analyse Langevin samplers that consist of\nperturbations of the standard underdamped Langevin dynamics. The perturbed\ndynamics is such that its invariant measure is the same as that of the\nunperturbed dynamics. We show that appropriate choices of the perturbations can\nlead to samplers that have improved properties, at least in terms of reducing\nthe asymptotic variance. We present a detailed analysis of the new Langevin\nsampler for Gaussian target distributions. Our theoretical results are\nsupported by numerical experiments with non-Gaussian target measures.\n", "  We study the structure of the neutrino mass matrix in the minimal gauged\nU(1)$_{L_\\mu-L_\\tau}$ model, where three right-handed neutrinos are added to\nthe Standard Model in order to obtain non-zero masses for active neutrinos.\nBecause of the U(1)$_{L_\\mu-L_\\tau}$ gauge symmetry, the structure of both\nDirac and Majorana mass terms of neutrinos is tightly restricted. In\nparticular, the inverse of the neutrino mass matrix has zeros in the\n$(\\mu,\\mu)$ and $(\\tau,\\tau)$ components, namely, this model offers a symmetric\nrealization of the so-called two-zero-minor structure in the neutrino mass\nmatrix. Due to these constraints, all the CP phases-the Dirac CP phase $\\delta$\nand the Majorana CP phases $\\alpha_2$ and $\\alpha_3$-as well as the mass\neigenvalues of the light neutrinos $m_i$ are uniquely determined as functions\nof the neutrino mixing angles $\\theta_{12}$, $\\theta_{23}$, and $\\theta_{13}$,\nand the squared mass differences $\\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $\\Delta m_{31}^2$. We\nfind that this model predicts the Dirac CP phase $\\delta$ to be $\\delta\\simeq\n1.59\\pi$-$1.70\\pi$ ($1.54\\pi$-$1.78\\pi$), the sum of the neutrino masses to be\n$\\sum_{i}m_i \\simeq 0.14$-0.22 eV ($0.12$-0.40 eV), and the effective mass for\nthe neutrinoless double beta decay to be $\\langle m_{\\beta \\beta }\\rangle\n\\simeq 0.024$-0.055 eV ($0.017$-0.12 eV) at $1\\sigma$ ($2\\sigma$) level, which\nare totally consistent with the current experimental limits. These predictions\ncan soon be tested in future neutrino experiments. Implications for\nleptogenesis are also discussed.\n", "  The commensurate charge density wave (CDW) in the layered compound\n$1T$-TaS$_2$ has hitherto mostly been treated as a quasi two-dimensional\nphenomenon. Recent band structure calculations have, however, predicted that\nthe CDW coexists with a nearly one-dimensional metallic dispersion\nperpendicular to the crystal planes. Using synchrotron radiation based\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that this metallic band does\nin fact exist. Its occupied band width is in excellent agreement with\npredictions for a simple $\\tau_c$ stacking order of the CDW between adjacent\nlayers and its periodicity in the $c$ direction is $2 \\pi / c$.\n", "  A new experiment to measure vacuum magnetic birefringence (VMB), the OVAL\nexperiment, is reported. We developed an original pulsed magnet that has a high\nrepetition rate and applies the strongest magnetic field among VMB experiments.\nThe vibration isolation design and feedback system enable the direct\ncombination of the magnet with a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity. To ensure the searching\npotential, a calibration measurement with dilute nitrogen gas and a prototype\nsearch for vacuum magnetic birefringence are performed. Based on the results, a\nstrategy to observe vacuum magnetic birefringence is reported.\n", "  It is one of the major issues to realize a vacuum which breaks supersymmetry\n(SUSY) and R-symmetry, in a supersymmetric model. We study the model, where the\nsame sector breaks the gauge symmetry and SUSY. In general, the SUSY breaking\nmodel without gauge symmetry has a flat direction at the minimum of F-term\nscalar potential. When we introduce U(1) gauge symmetry to such a SUSY breaking\nmodel, there can appear a runaway direction. Such a runway direction can be\nlifted by loop effects, and the gauge symmetry breaking and SUSY breaking are\nrealized. The R-symmetry, that is assigned to break SUSY, is also spontaneously\nbroken at the vacuum. This scenario can be extended to non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. We also discuss application to the Pati-Salam model and the SU(5)\ngrand unified theory. We see that non-vanishing gaugino masses are radiatively\ngenerated by the R-symmetry breaking and the gauge messenger contribution.\n", "  We study the Domb-Joyce model of weakly self-avoiding walks on the simple\ncubic lattice via Monte Carlo simulations. We determine to excellent accuracy\nthe value for the interaction parameter which results in an improved model for\nwhich the leading correction-to-scaling term has zero amplitude.\n", "  Bosonization provides a powerful analytical framework to deal with\none-dimensional strongly interacting fermion systems, which makes it a\ncornerstone in quantum many-body theory. Yet, this success comes at the expense\nof using effective infrared parameters, and restricting the description to low\nenergy states near the Fermi level. We propose a radical extension of the\nbosonization technique that overcomes both limitations, allowing computations\nwith microscopic lattice Hamiltonians, from the Fermi level down to the bottom\nof the band. The formalism rests on the simple idea of representing the fermion\nkinetic term in the energy domain, after which it can be expressed in terms of\nfree bosonic degrees of freedom. As a result, one- and two-body fermionic\nscattering processes generate anharmonic boson-boson interactions, even in the\nforward channel. We show that up to moderate interaction strengths, these\nnonlinearities can be treated analytically at all energy scales, using the\nx-ray emission problem as a showcase. In the strong interaction regime, we\nemploy a systematic variational solution of the bosonic theory, and obtain\nresults that agree quantitatively with an exact diagonalization of the original\none-particle fermionic model. This provides a proof of the fully microscopic\ncharacter of bosonization on all energy scales for an arbitrary band structure.\nBesides recovering the known x-ray edge singularity at the emission threshold,\nwe find strong signatures of correlations even at emission frequencies beyond\nthe band bottom.\n", "  One of the hallmarks of time-reversal-symmetric topological insulators in\nthree dimensions is the topological magnetoelectric effect (TME). So far, a\ntime-reversal breaking variant of this effect has attracted much attention, in\nthe sense that the induced electric charge changes sign when the direction of\nan externally applied magnetic field is reversed. Theoretically, this effect is\ndescribed by the so-called axion term. Here, we discuss a\ntime-reversal-symmetric TME, where the electric charge depends only on the\nmagnitude of the magnetic field but is independent of its sign. We obtain this\nnonperturbative result by a combination of analytic and numerical arguments,\nand suggest a mesoscopic setup to demonstrate it experimentally.\n", "  In an unseeded SU(1,1) interferometer composed of two cascaded degenerate\nparametric amplifiers, with direct detection at the output, we demonstrate a\nphase sensitivity overcoming the shot noise limit by 2.3 dB. The interferometer\nis strongly unbalanced, with the parametric gain of the second amplifier\nexceeding the gain of the first one by a factor of 2, which makes the scheme\nextremely tolerant to detection losses. We show that by increasing the gain of\nthe second amplifier, the phase supersensitivity of the interferometer can be\npreserved even with detection losses as high as 80%. This finding can\nconsiderably improve the state-of-the-art interferometry, enable sub-shot-noise\nphase sensitivity in spectral ranges with inefficient detection, and allow\nextension to quantum imaging.\n", "  In this paper we expand upon our previous work [1] by using the entire family\nof Bianchi type V stiff fluid solutions as seed solutions of the Stephani\ntransformation. Among the new exact solutions generated, we observe a number of\nimportant physical phenomena. The most interesting phenomenon is exact\nsolutions with intersecting spikes. Other interesting phenomena are solutions\nwith saddle states and a close-to-FL epoch.\n", "  We investigate the present constraints from MINOS and T2K experiments for the\nneutrino decay scenario induced by non-diagonal couplings of Majorons to\nneutrinos. As novelty, on top of the typical invisible decay prescription, we\nadd the contribution of visible decay, where final products can be observed.\nThis new effect depends on the nature of the neutrino - Majoron coupling, which\ncan be of scalar or pseudoscalar type. Using the combination of disappearance\ndata from MINOS and disappearance and appearance data from T2K, for normal\nordering, we constrain the decay parameter $\\alpha\\equiv E\\,\\Gamma$ for the\nheaviest neutrino, where $E$ and $\\Gamma$ are the neutrino energy and width,\nrespectively. We find that when considering visible decay within appearance\ndata, one can improve current neutrino long-baseline constraints up to $\\alpha<\n\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ eV$^2$, at 90\\% C.L., for both kinds of couplings, which\nis better by one order of magnitude compared to previous bounds.\n", "  In this work we experimentally demonstrate for the first time a recently\nproposed criterion adressed to detect nonclassical behavior in the fluorescence\nemission of ensembles of single-photon emitters. In particular, we apply the\nmethod to study clusters of NV centres in diamond observed via\nsingle-photon-sensitive confocal microscopy. Theoretical considerations on the\nbehavior of the parameter at any arbitrary order in presence of poissonian\nnoise are presented and, finally, the opportunity of detecting manifold\ncoincidences is discussed.\n", "  Understanding spin-wave dynamics in chiral magnets is a key step for the\ndevelopment of high-speed, spin-wave based spintronic devices that take\nadvantage of chiral and topological spin textures for their operation. Here we\npresent an experimental and theoretical study of spin-wave dynamics in a cubic\nB20 FeGe single crystal. Using the combination of waveguide microwave\nabsorption spectroscopy (MAS), micromagnetic simulations, and analytical\ntheory, we identify the resonance dynamics in all magnetic phases (field\npolarized, conical, helical, and skyrmion phases). Because the resonance\nfrequencies of specific chiral spin textures are unique, quantitative agreement\nbetween our theoretical predictions and experimental findings for all resonance\nfrequencies and spin wave modes enables us to unambiguously identify chiral\nmagnetic phases and to demonstrate that MAS is a powerful tool to efficiently\nextract a magnetic phase diagram. These results provide a new tool to\naccelerate the integration of chiral magnetic materials into spintronic\ndevices.\n", "  Seismic data will be a vital geophysical constraint on internal structure of\nEuropa if we land instruments on the surface. Quantifying expected seismic\nactivity on Europa both in terms of large, recognizable signals and ambient\nbackground noise is important for understanding dynamics of the moon, as well\nas interpretation of potential future data. Seismic energy sources will likely\ninclude cracking in the ice shell and turbulent motion in the oceans. We define\na range of models of seismic activity in Europa's ice shell by assuming each\nmodel follows a Gutenberg-Richter relationship with varying parameters. A range\nof cumulative seismic moment release between $10^{16}$ and $10^{18}$ Nm/yr is\ndefined by scaling tidal dissipation energy to tectonic events on the Earth's\nmoon. Random catalogs are generated and used to create synthetic continuous\nnoise records through numerical wave propagation in thermodynamically\nself-consistent models of the interior structure of Europa. Spectral\ncharacteristics of the noise are calculated by determining probabilistic power\nspectral densities of the synthetic records. While the range of seismicity\nmodels predicts noise levels that vary by 80 dB, we show that most noise\nestimates are below the self-noise floor of high-frequency geophones, but may\nbe recorded by more sensitive instruments. The largest expected signals exceed\nbackground noise by $\\sim$50 dB. Noise records may allow for constraints on\ninterior structure through autocorrelation. Models of seismic noise generated\nby pressure variations at the base of the ice shell due to turbulent motions in\nthe subsurface ocean may also generate observable seismic noise.\n", "  The local form of higher-spin equations found recently to the second order\n[1] is shown to properly reproduce the anticipated $AdS/CFT$ correlators for\nappropriate boundary conditions. It is argued that consistent $AdS/CFT$\nholography for the parity-broken boundary models needs a nontrivial\nmodification of the bosonic truncation of the original higher-spin theory with\nthe doubled number of fields, as well as a nonlinear deformation of the\nboundary conditions in the higher orders.\n", "  Seismology was developed on Earth and shaped our model of the Earth's\ninterior over the 20th century. With the exception of the Philae lander, all in\nsitu extraterrestrial seismological effort to date was limited to other\nterrestrial planets. All have in common a rigid crust above a solid mantle. The\ncoming years may see the installation of seismometers on Europa, Titan and\nEnceladus, so it is necessary to adapt seismological concepts to the setting of\nworlds with global oceans covered in ice. Here we use waveform analyses to\nidentify and classify wave types, developing a lexicon for icy ocean world\nseismology intended to be useful to both seismologists and planetary\nscientists. We use results from spectral-element simulations of broadband\nseismic wavefields to adapt seismological concepts to icy ocean worlds. We\npresent a concise naming scheme for seismic waves and an overview of the\nfeatures of the seismic wavefield on Europa, Titan, Ganymede and Enceladus. In\nclose connection with geophysical interior models, we analyze simulated seismic\nmeasurements of Europa and Titan that might be used to constrain geochemical\nparameters governing the habitability of a sub-ice ocean.\n", "  Microcavity exciton polaritons are promising candidates to build a new\ngeneration of highly nonlinear and integrated optoelectronic devices. Such\ndevices range from novel coherent light emitters to reconfigurable potential\nlandscapes for electro-optical polariton-lattice based quantum simulators as\nwell as building blocks of optical logic architectures. Especially for the\nlatter, the strongly interacting nature of the light-matter hybrid particles\nhas been used to facilitate fast and efficient switching of light by light,\nsomething which is very hard to achieve with weakly interacting photons. We\ndemonstrate here that polariton transistor switches can be fully integrated in\nelectro-optical schemes by implementing a one-dimensional polariton channel\nwhich is operated by an electrical gate rather than by a control laser beam.\nThe operation of the device, which is the polariton equivalent to a\nfield-effect transistor, relies on combining electro-optical potential\nlandscape engineering with local exciton ionization to control the scattering\ndynamics underneath the gate. We furthermore demonstrate that our device has a\nregion of negative differential resistance and features a completely new way to\ncreate bistable behavior.\n", "  In the context of extended Teleparallel gravity theories with a 3+1\ndimensions Gauss-Bonnet analog term, we address the possibility of these\ntheories reproducing several well-known cosmological solutions. In particular\nwhen applied to a Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker geometry in\nfour-dimensional spacetime with standard fluids exclusively. We study different\ntypes of gravitational Lagrangians and reconstruct solutions provided by\nanalytical expressions for either the cosmological scale factor or the Hubble\nparameter. We also show that it is possible to find Lagrangians of this type\nwithout a cosmological constant such that the behaviour of the LCDM model is\nprecisely mimicked. The new Lagrangians may also lead to other phenomenological\nconsequences opening up the possibility for new theories to compete directly\nwith other extensions of General Relativity.\n", "  Geophysical measurements can reveal the structure of icy ocean worlds and\ncycling of volatiles. The associated density, temperature, sound speed, and\nelectrical conductivity of such worlds thus characterizes their habitability.\nTo explore the variability and correlation of these parameters, and to provide\ntools for planning and data analyses, we develop 1-D calculations of internal\nstructure, which use available constraints on the thermodynamics of aqueous\nMgSO$_4$, NaCl (as seawater), and NH$_3$, water ices, and silicate content.\nLimits in available thermodynamic data narrow the parameter space that can be\nexplored: insufficient coverage in pressure, temperature, and composition for\nend-member salinities of MgSO$_4$ and NaCl, and for relevant water ices; and a\ndearth of suitable data for aqueous mixtures of Na-Mg-Cl-SO$_4$-NH$_3$. For\nEuropa, ocean compositions that are oxidized and dominated by MgSO$_4$, vs\nreduced (NaCl), illustrate these gaps, but also show the potential for\ndiagnostic and measurable combinations of geophysical parameters. The\nlow-density rocky core of Enceladus may comprise hydrated minerals, or anydrous\nminerals with high porosity comparable to Earth's upper mantle. Titan's ocean\nmust be dense, but not necessarily saline, as previously noted, and may have\nlittle or no high-pressure ice at its base. Ganymede's silicious interior is\ndeepest among all known ocean worlds, and may contain multiple phases of\nhigh-pressure ice, which will become buoyant if the ocean is sufficiently\nsalty. Callisto's likely near-eutectic ocean cannot be adequately modeled using\navailable data. Callisto may also lack high-pressure ices, but this cannot be\nconfirmed due to uncertainty in its moment of inertia.\n", "  Recently, it has been realized that the so-called G-inflation model inspired\nby supplementing a generalized covariant Galileon-like non-linear derivative\nself-interacting term to the standard kinetic term should be ruled out from\ninflationary models. This is due to the fact that it suffers from lack of an\noscillatory phase at the end of the inflationary regime which is typically\naccompanied by the appearance of a negative squared propagation speed of the\nscalar mode leading to instabilities of small-scale perturbations. In this\nregard, the warm G-inflation scenario is proposed where for G-inflation to\nsurvive, the Galileon scalar field is coupled to the radiation field through a\ndissipation term which results in removing the reheating period due to the\ncharacteristics of warm inflationary scenario. In so doing, a linear stability\nanalysis is first performed to obtain the appropriate slow-roll conditions in\nsuch a proposal. Cosmological perturbations of the model are then investigated\nby utilizing fluctuation-dissipation theorem and analytical expressions are\nderived for observable quantities; the power spectrum, tilt spectral index and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio in terms of $PSR$ parameters and Galileon flow\nfunctions. Finally, the model is solved for chaotic self-interacting\npotentials, particularly the renormalizable Higgs potential $\\frac{\\lambda}{4}\n\\phi^{4}$, and shown to be consistent with observations in the weak dissipation\n$Q \\ll 1+ 3\\frac{\\delta_{GX}}{\\delta_{X}}$ and G-dominant\n$3\\frac{\\delta_{GX}}{\\delta_{X}}\\gg 1$ regime despite its large self-coupling,\nsince the energy scale at the horizon crossing is depressed by the synergy of\nGalileon and thermal effects.\n", "  Recent experiments on macroscopic quantum tunneling reveal a non-exponential\ndecay of the number of atoms trapped in a quasibound state behind a potential\nbarrier. Through both experiment and theory, we demonstrate this\nnon-exponential decay results from interactions between atoms. Quantum\ntunneling of tens of thousands of 87 Rb atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate is\nmodeled by a modified Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin model, taking into\naccount the effective time-dependent barrier induced by the mean-field.\nThree-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii simulations corroborate a mean-field result\nwhen compared with experiments. However, with one-dimensional modeling using\ntime-evolving block decimation, we present an effective renormalized mean-field\ntheory that suggests many-body dynamics for which a bare mean-field theory may\nnot apply.\n", "  Heavy axion-like particles have been introduced in several scenarios beyond\nthe Standard Model and their production in some astrophysical systems should be\npossible. In this work, we re-examine the possibility that these type of\nparticles can be generated in the accretion disks of gamma-ray bursts (GRB),\nthe most powerful events in the universe. If the produced axions decay into\nphotons or $e^+e-$ pairs at the correct distances, a fireball is generated. We\ncalculate the structure transient accretion disks in GRBs (density, temperature\nand thickness profiles) taking into account the effect of heavy axion emission\nas well as the rest of the relevant standard cooling processes. This allows us\nto obtain the values of the coupling constant g_{aN} in order for the axions\nnot to become trapped, and we can also compute the emitted heavy axion\nluminosity from the entire disk. We find that for the couplings within the\nranges found, then the mechanism for powering GRBs based on heavy axion\nproduction and decay becomes an alternative to the standard picture based upon\nmagnetohydrodynamic processes and neutrino-antineutrino annihilation.\nOtherwise, if heavy axions are produced in the disk but their decay to takes\nplace further away, the mechanism fails. Still, the decay products (gamma rays\nor electrons and positrons) should leave observable signatures which are not\nobserved for different ranges of values of the coupling constants, depending on\nthe mass of the heavy axion\n", "  Interference effect of neutron capture cross section between the compound and\ndirect processes is investigated. The compound process is calculated by\nresonance parameters and the direct process by the potential mode. The\ninterference effect is tested for neutron-rich $^{82}$Ge and $^{134}$Sn nuclei\nrelevant to $r$-process and light nucleus $^{13}$C which is neutron poison in\nthe $s$-process and produces long-lived radioactive nucleus $^{14}$C\n($T_{1/2}=5700$ y). The interference effects in those nuclei are significant\naround resonances, and low energy region if $s$-wave neutron direct capture is\npossible. Maxwellian averaged cross sections at $kT=30$ and $300$ keV are also\ncalculated, and the interference effect changes the Maxwellian averaged capture\ncross section largely depending on resonance position.\n", "  Two-dimensionally nanoconfined water between ideal planar walls has been the\nsubject of ample study, aiming at understanding the intrinsic response of water\nto confinement, avoiding the consideration of the chemistry of actual confining\nmaterials. In this work, we study the response of such nanoconfined water under\na periodic confining potential by means of computer simulations, both using\nempirical potentials and from first-principles. We propose a periodic confining\npotential emulating the atomistic oscillation of the confining walls, which\nallows varying the lattice parameter and amplitude of the oscillation. We do it\nfor a triangular lattice, with several values of the lattice parameter: one\nwhich is ideal for commensuration with layers of Ih ice, and other values that\nwould correspond to more realistic substrates. For the former, an overall rise\nof the melting temperature is observed. The liquid maintains a bi-layer\ntriangular structure, however, despite the fact that it is not favoured by the\nexternal periodicity. The first-principles liquid is significantly affected by\nthe modulation in its layering and stacking even at relatively small amplitudes\nof the confinement modulation. Beyond some critical modulation amplitude the\nhexatic phase present in flat confinement is replaced by a trilayer crystalline\nphase unlike any of the phases encountered for flat confinement. For more\nrealistic lattice parameters, the liquid does not display higher tendency to\nfreeze, but it clearly shows inhomogeneous behaviour as the strength of the\nrugosity increases. In spite of this expected inhomogeneity, the structural and\ndynamical response of the liquid is surprisingly insensitive to the external\nmodulation. Although the first-principles calculations give a more triangular\nliquid than the one observed with empirical potentials, both agree remarkably\nwell for the main conclusions of the study.\n", "  We study Hawking radiation on the quantum space-time of a collapsing null\nshell. We use the geometric optics approximation as in Hawking's original\npapers to treat the radiation. The quantum space-time is constructed by\nsuperposing the classical geometries associated with collapsing shells with\nuncertainty in their position and mass. We show that there are departures from\nthermality in the radiation even though we are not considering back reaction.\nOne recovers the usual profile for the Hawking radiation as a function of\nfrequency in the limit where the space-time is classical. However, when quantum\ncorrections are taken into account, the profile of the Hawking radiation as a\nfunction of time contains information about the initial state of the collapsing\nshell. More work will be needed to determine if all the information can be\nrecovered. The calculations show that non-trivial quantum effects can occur in\nregions of low curvature when horizons are involved, as for instance advocated\nin the firewall scenario.\n", "  We unveil a novel source of non-Markovianity for the dynamics of quantum\nsystems, which appears when the system does not explore the full set of\ndynamical trajectories in the interaction with its environment. We term this\neffect non-Markovianity by undersampling and demonstrate its appearance in the\noperation of an all-optical quantum simulator involving a polarization qubit\ninteracting with a dephasing fluctuating environment.\n", "  Small drops impinging angularly on thin flowing soap films frequently\ndemonstrate the rare emergence of bulk elastic effects working in-tandem with\nthe more common-place hydrodynamic interactions. Three collision regimes are\nobservable: (a) drop piercing through the film, (b) it coalescing with the\nflow, and (c) it bouncing off the film surface. During impact, the drop deforms\nalong with a bulk elastic deformation of the film. For impacts that are\nclose-to-tangential, the bounce-off regime predominates. We outline a reduced\norder analytical framework assuming a deformable drop and a deformable\nthree-dimensional film, and the idealization invokes a phase-based parametric\nstudy. Angular inclination of the film and the ratio of post and pre impact\ndrop sizes entail the phase parameters. We also perform experiments with\nvertically descending droplets impacting against an inclined soap film, flowing\nunder constant pressure head. Model predicted phase domain for bounce-off\ncompares well to our experimental findings. Additionally, the experiments\nexhibit momentum transfer to the film in the form of shed vortex dipole, along\nwith propagation of free surface waves. On consulting prior published work, we\nnote that for locomotion of water-walking insects using an impulsive action,\nthe momentum distribution to the shed vortices and waves are both significant,\ntaking up respectively 2/3-rd and 1/3-rd of the imparted streamwise momentum.\nIn view of the potentially similar impulse actions, this theory is applied to\nthe bounce-off examples in our experiments, and the resultant shed vortex\ndipole momenta are compared to the momenta computed from particle imaging\nvelocimetry data. The magnitudes reveal identical order ($10^{-7}$ N$\\cdot$s),\nsuggesting that the bounce-off regime can be tapped as a simple analogue for\ninterfacial bio-locomotion relying on impulse reactions.\n", "  In topological quantum computing, information is encoded in \"knotted\" quantum\nstates of topological phases of matter, thus being locked into topology to\nprevent decay. Topological precision has been confirmed in quantum Hall liquids\nby experiments to an accuracy of $10^{-10}$, and harnessed to stabilize quantum\nmemory. In this survey, we discuss the conceptual development of this\ninterdisciplinary field at the juncture of mathematics, physics and computer\nscience. Our focus is on computing and physical motivations, basic mathematical\nnotions and results, open problems and future directions related to and/or\ninspired by topological quantum computing.\n", "  The pseudogap metal phase of the hole-doped cuprate superconductors has two\nseemingly unrelated characteristics: a gap in the electronic spectrum in the\n`anti-nodal' region of the square lattice Brillouin zone, and discrete broken\nsymmetries. We present a SU(2) gauge theory of quantum fluctuations of\nmagnetically ordered states which appear in a classical theory of square\nlattice antiferromagnets, in a spin density wave mean field theory of the\nsquare lattice Hubbard model, and in a CP$^1$ theory of spinons. This theory\nleads to metals with an antinodal gap, and topological order which intertwines\nwith precisely the observed broken symmetries.\n", "  We study topological crystalline insulators doped with magnetic impurities,\nin which ferromagnetism at the surface lowers the electronic energy by\nspontaneous breaking of a crystalline symmetry. The number of energetically\nequivalent ground states is sensitive to the crystalline symmetry of the\nsurface, as well as the precise density of electrons at the surface. We show\nthat for a SnTe model in the topological state, magnetic states can have\ntwofold symmetry, sixfold symmetry, or eightfold degenerate minima. We compute\nspin stiffnesses within the model to demonstrate the stability of ferromagnetic\nstates, and consider their ramifications for thermal disordering. Possible\nexperimental consequences of the surface magnetism are discussed.\n", "  Strong dipole-dipole interactions between atoms in high-lying Rydberg states\ncan suppress multiple Rydberg excitations within a micron-sized trapping volume\nand yield sizable Rydberg level shifts at larger distances. Ensembles of atoms\nin optical microtraps then form Rydberg superatoms with collectively enhanced\ntransition rates to the singly excited state. These superatoms can represent\nmesoscopic, strongly-interacting spins. We study a regular array of such\neffective spins driven by a laser field tuned to compensate the\ninteraction-induced level shifts between neighboring superatoms. During the\ninitial transient, a few excited superatoms seed a cascade of resonantly\nfacilitated excitation of large clusters of superatoms. Due to spontaneous\ndecay, the system then relaxes to the steady state having nearly universal\nRydberg excitation density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{R}} = 2/3$. This state is\ncharacterized by highly-nontrivial equilibrium dynamics of quasi-particles --\nexcitation holes in the lattice of Rydberg excited superatoms. We derive an\neffective many-body model that accounts for hole mobility as well as continuous\ncreation and annihilation of holes upon collisions with each other. We find\nthat holes exhibit a nearly incompressible liquid phase with highly\nsub-Poissonian number statistics and finite-range density-density correlations.\n", "  Klein tunneling, the perfect transmission of normally incident Dirac\nelectrons across a potential barrier, has been widely studied in graphene and\nexplored to design switches, albeit indirectly. We show that Klein tunneling\nmaybe easier to detect for spin-momentum locked electrons crossing a PN\njunction along a three-dimensional topological insulator surface. In these\ntopological insulator PN junctions (TIPNJs), the spin texture and momentum\ndistribution of transmitted electrons can be measured electrically using a\nferromagnetic probe for varying gate voltages and angles of current injection.\nBased on transport models across a TIPNJ, we show that the asymmetry in the\npotentiometric signal between PP and PN junctions and its overall angular\ndependence serve as a direct signature of Klein tunneling.\n", "  Multi-photon processes are the essence of nonlinear optics. Optical harmonics\ngeneration and multi-photon absorption, ionization, polymerization or\nspectroscopy are widely used in practical applications. Generally, the rate of\nan n-photon effect scales as the n-th order autocorrelation function of the\nincident light, which is high for light with strong photon-number fluctuations.\nTherefore `noisy' light sources are much more efficient for multi-photon\neffects than coherent sources with the same mean power, pulse duration and\nrepetition rate. Here we generate optical harmonics of order 2-4 from bright\nsqueezed vacuum (BSV), a state of light consisting of only quantum noise with\nno coherent component. We observe up to two orders of magnitude enhancement in\nthe generation of optical harmonics due to ultrafast photon-number\nfluctuations. This feature is especially important for the nonlinear optics of\nfragile structures where the use of a `noisy' pump can considerably increase\nthe effect without overcoming the damage threshold.\n", "  Formally, the cross section for producing a heavy evaporation residue,\n{\\sigma}EVR, in a fusion reaction can be written as. \\begin{equation}\n\\sigma_{\\rm EVR}(E)=\\frac{\\pi h^2}{2\\mu E}\\sum\\limits_{\\ell=0}^\\infty\n(2\\ell+1)T(E,\\ell)P_{\\rm CN}(E,\\ell)W_{\\rm sur}(E,\\ell), \\end{equation} where E\nis the center of mass energy, and T is the probability of the colliding nuclei\nto overcome the potential barrier in the entrance channel and reach the contact\npoint. PCN is the probability that the projectile-target system will evolve\nfrom the contact point to the compound nucleus. Wsur is the probability that\nthe compound nucleus will decay to produce an evaporation residue rather than\nfissioning. However, one must remember that the Wsur term effectively sets the\nallowed values of the spin, which in turn, restricts the values of the capture\nand fusion cross sections. We point out the implications of this fact for\ncapture cross sections for heavy element formation reactions.\n", "  We discuss the stability properties of the solutions of the general nonlinear\n\\Schrodinger\\ equation (NLSE) in 1+1 dimensions in an external potential\nderivable from a parity-time ($\\PT$) symmetric superpotential $W(x)$ that we\nconsidered earlier \\cite{PhysRevE.92.042901}. In particular we consider the\nnonlinear partial differential equation $ \\{\n  i \\,\n  \\partial_t\n  +\n  \\partial_x^2\n  -\n  V(x)\n  + g\n  | \\psi(x,t) |^{2\\kappa}\n  \\} \\, \\psi(x,t)\n  =\n  0 \\>, $ for arbitrary nonlinearity parameter $\\kappa$, where $g= \\pm1$ and\n$V$ is the well known P{\\\"o}schl-Teller potential which we allow to be\nrepulsive as well as attractive. Using energy landscape methods, linear\nstability analysis as well as a time dependent variational approximation, we\nderive consistent analytic results for the domains of instability of these new\nexact solutions as a function of the strength of the external potential and\n$\\kappa$. For the repulsive potential (and $g=+1$) we show that there is a\ntranslational instability which can be understood in terms of the energy\nlandscape as a function of a stretching parameter and a translation parameter\nbeing a saddle near the exact solution. In this case, numerical simulations\nshow that if we start with the exact solution, the initial wave function breaks\ninto two pieces traveling in opposite directions. If we explore the slightly\nperturbed solution situations, a 1\\% change in initial conditions can change\nsignificantly the details of how the wave function breaks into two separate\npieces. For the attractive potential (and $g=+1$), changing the initial\nconditions by 1 \\% modifies the domain of stability only slightly. For the case\nof the attractive potential and negative $g$ perturbed solutions merely\noscillate with the oscillation frequencies predicted by the variational\napproximation.\n", "  We demonstrate that the microscopic Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory\nprovides an important approach to shed light on the nuclear dynamics leading to\nthe formation of superheavy elements. In particular, we discuss studying\nquasifission dynamics and calculating ingredients for compound nucleus\nformation probability calculations. We also discuss possible extensions to TDHF\nto address the distribution of observables.\n", "  A search is presented for long-lived particles with a mass between 25 and 50\nGeV/$c^2$ and a lifetime between 2 and 500 ps, using proton-proton collision\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0 fb$^{-1}$, collected by\nthe LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The particles are\nassumed to be pair-produced in the decay of a 125 GeV/$c^2$ Standard-Model-like\nHiggs boson. The experimental signature is a single long-lived particle,\nidentified by a displaced vertex with two associated jets. No excess above\nbackground is observed and limits are set on the production cross-section as a\nfunction of the mass and lifetime of the long-lived particle.\n", "  The motion of massless Dirac-electrons in graphene mimics the propagation of\nphotons. This makes it possible to control the charge-carriers with components\nbased on geometrical-optics and has led to proposals for an all-graphene\nelectron-optics platform. An open question arising from the possibility of\nreducing the component-size to the nanometer-scale is how to access and\nunderstand the transition from optical-transport to quantum-confinement. Here\nwe report on the realization of a circular p-n junction that can be\ncontinuously tuned from the nanometer-scale, where quantum effects are\ndominant, to the micrometer scale where optical-guiding takes over. We find\nthat in the nanometer-scale junction electrons are trapped in states that\nresemble atomic-collapse at a supercritical charge. As the junction-size\nincreases, the transition to optical-guiding is signaled by the emergence of\nwhispering-gallery modes and Fabry-Perot interference. The creation of tunable\njunctions that straddle the crossover between quantum-confinement and\noptical-guiding, paves the way to novel design-architectures for controlling\nelectronic transport.\n", "  We present results of the coordinated observing campaign that made the first\nsubarcsecond localization of a Fast Radio Burst, FRB 121102. During this\ncampaign, we made the first simultaneous detection of an FRB burst by multiple\ntelescopes: the VLA at 3 GHz and the Arecibo Observatory at 1.4 GHz. Of the\nnine bursts detected by the Very Large Array at 3 GHz, four had simultaneous\nobserving coverage at other observatories. We use multi-observatory constraints\nand modeling of bursts seen only at 3 GHz to confirm earlier results showing\nthat burst spectra are not well modeled by a power law. We find that burst\nspectra are characterized by a ~500 MHz envelope and apparent radio energy as\nhigh as $10^{40}$ erg. We measure significant changes in the apparent\ndispersion between bursts that can be attributed to frequency-dependent\nprofiles or some other intrinsic burst structure that adds a systematic error\nto the estimate of DM by up to 1%. We use FRB 121102 as a prototype of the FRB\nclass to estimate a volumetric birth rate of FRB sources $R_{FRB} \\approx\n5x10^{-5}/N_r$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, where $N_r$ is the number of bursts per\nsource over its lifetime. This rate is broadly consistent with models of FRBs\nfrom young pulsars or magnetars born in superluminous supernovae or long\ngamma-ray bursts, if the typical FRB repeats on the order of thousands of times\nduring its lifetime.\n", "  We study the current sample of rapidly rotating neutron stars in both\naccreting and non-accreting binaries in order to determine whether the spin\ndistribution of accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries can be\nreconciled with current accretion torque models. We perform a statistical\nanalysis of the spin distributions and show that there is evidence for two\nsub-populations among low-mass X-ray binaries, one at relatively low spin\nfrequency, with an average of ~300 Hz and a broad spread, and a peaked\npopulation at higher frequency with average spin frequency of ~575 Hz. We show\nthat the two sub-populations are separated by a cut-point at a frequency of\n~540 Hz. We also show that the spin frequency of radio millisecond pulsars does\nnot follow a log-normal distribution and shows no evidence for the existence of\ndistinct sub-populations. We discuss the uncertainties of different accretion\nmodels and speculate that either the accreting neutron star cut-point marks the\nonset of gravitational waves as an efficient mechanism to remove angular\nmomentum or some of the neutron stars in the fast sub-population do not evolve\ninto radio millisecond pulsars.\n", "  We point out that leptonic weak-basis invariants are an important tool for\nthe study of the properties of lepton flavour models. In particular, we show\nthat appropriately chosen invariants can give a clear indication of whether a\nparticular lepton flavour model favours normal or inverted hierarchy for\nneutrino masses and what is the octant of $\\theta_{23}$. These invariants can\nbe evaluated in any conveniently chosen weak-basis and can also be expressed in\nterms of neutrino masses, charged lepton masses, mixing angles and CP violation\nphases.\n", "  The growth and saturation of magnetic fields due to the Weibel instability\n(WI) have important implications for laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, and\nthis has drawn significant interest recently. Since the WI can generate a large\nmagnetic field from no initial field, the maximum magnitudes achieved can have\nsignificant consequences for a number of applications. Hence, an understanding\nof the detailed dynamics driving the nonlinear saturation of the WI is\nimportant. This work considers the nonlinear saturation of the WI when\ncounter-streaming populations of initially unmagnetized electrons are perturbed\nby a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the direction of streaming.\nPrevious works have found magnetic trapping to be important and connected\nelectron skin depth spatial scales to the nonlinear saturation of the WI. 2\nResults presented in this work are consistent with these findings for a\nhigh-temperature case. However, using a high-order continuum kinetic simulation\ntool, this work demonstrates that, when the electron populations are colder, a\nsignificant electrostatic potential develops that works with the magnetic field\nto create potential wells. The electrostatic field develops due to transverse\nflows induced by the WI, and in some cases is strengthened by a secondary\ninstability. This field plays a key role in saturation of the WI for colder\npopulations. The role of the electrostatic potential in Weibel instability\nsaturation has not been studied in detail previously.\n", "  It is shown that the existence of single critical point of the fluid\ndescribed by van der Waals equation of state is not the hypothesis and it is\nthe consequence of the thermodynamic conditions of liquid-vapor phase\nequilibrium. It is also shown that the thermodynamic conditions of liquid-vapor\nphase equilibrium of the fluid give equalities to zero of first and second\npartial derivatives at constant temperature of pressure with respect to volume\nat critical point which are usual conditions of existence of critical point.\n", "  We consider the $n$-component $|\\varphi|^4$ lattice spin model ($n \\ge 1$)\nand the weakly self-avoiding walk ($n=0$) on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, in dimensions\n$d=1,2,3$. We study long-range models based on the fractional Laplacian, with\nspin-spin interactions or walk step probabilities decaying with distance $r$ as\n$r^{-(d+\\alpha)}$ with $\\alpha \\in (0,2)$. The upper critical dimension is\n$d_c=2\\alpha$. For $\\epsilon >0$, and $\\alpha = \\frac 12 (d+\\epsilon)$, the\ndimension $d=d_c-\\epsilon$ is below the upper critical dimension. For small\n$\\epsilon$, weak coupling, and all integers $n \\ge 0$, we prove that the\ntwo-point function at the critical point decays with distance as\n$r^{-(d-\\alpha)}$. This \"sticking\" of the critical exponent at its mean-field\nvalue was first predicted in the physics literature in 1972. Our proof is based\non a rigorous renormalisation group method. The treatment of observables\ndiffers from that used in recent work on the nearest-neighbour 4-dimensional\ncase, via our use of a cluster expansion.\n", "  Combined HERA data on charm production in deep-inelastic scattering have\npreviously been used to determine the charm-quark running mass $m_c(m_c)$ in\nthe MSbar renormalisation scheme. Here, the same data are used as a function of\nthe photon virtuality $Q^2$ to evaluate the charm-quark running mass at\ndifferent scales to one-loop order, in the context of a next-to-leading order\nQCD analysis. The scale dependence of the mass is found to be consistent with\nQCD expectations.\n", "  We consider Einstein-Horndeski-Maxwell gravity, together with a cosmological\nconstant and multiple Horndeski axions. We construct charged AdS planar black\nholes in general dimensions where the Horndeski anxions span over the planar\ndirections. We analyse the thermodynamics and obtain the black hole volumes. We\nshow that the reverse isoperimetric inequality can be violated, implying that\nthese black holes can store information more efficiently than the Schwarzschild\nblack hole.\n", "  Matching members in the Coma cluster catalogue of ultra-diffuse galaxies\n(UDGs, Yagi et al. 2016) from SUBARU imaging with a very deep radio continuum\nsurvey source catalogue of the cluster (Miller et al. 2009) using the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array (VLA) within a rectangular region of ~ 1.19 square\ndegrees centred on the cluster core reveals matches consistent with random. An\noverlapping set of 470 UDGs and 696 VLA radio sources in this rectangular area\nfinds 33 matches within a separation of 25 arcsec; dividing the sample into\nbins with separations bounded by 5 arcsec, 10 arcsec, 20 arcsec and 25 arcsec\nfinds 1, 4, 17 and 11 matches. An analytical model estimate, based on the\nPoisson probability distribution, of the number of randomly expected matches\nwithin these same separation bounds is 1.7, 4.9, 19.4 and 14.2, each\nrespectively consistent with the 95 percent Poisson confidence intervals of the\nobserved values. Dividing the data into five clustercentric annuli of 0.1\ndegree, and into the four separation bins, finds the same result. This random\nmatch of UDGs with VLA sources implies that UDGs are not radio galaxies by the\nstandard definition. Those VLA sources having integrated flux > 1 mJy at 1.4\nGHz in Miller et al. (2009) without SDSS galaxy matches are consistent with the\nknown surface density of background radio sources. We briefly explore the\npossibility that some unresolved VLA sources near UDGs could be young, compact,\nbright, supernova remnants of type Ia events, possibly in the intracluster\nvolume.\n", "  The supersymmetry arises in certain theories of fermions coupled to gauge\nfields and gravity in a spacetime of 11 dimensions. The dynamical brane\nbackground has mainly been studied for the class of purely bosonic solutions\nonly, but recent developments involving a time-dependent brane solution have\nmade it clear that one can get more information by asking what happens on\nsupersymmetric systems. In this paper, we construct an exact supersymmetric\nsolution of a dynamical M-brane background in the 11-dimensional supergravity\nand investigate supersymmetry breaking, the geometric features near the\nsingularity and the black hole horizon.\n", "  We investigate the reduced Maxwell-Bloch (RMB) equations which describe the\npropagation of short optical pulses in dielectric materials with resonant\nnon-degenerate transitions. The general Nth-order periodic solutions are\nprovided by means of the Darboux transformation, and from two different\nlimiting cases of the obtained general periodic solutions, the Nth-order\ndegenerate periodic and Nth-order rational solutions containing several free\nparameters with compact determinant representations are derived, respectively.\nExplicit expressions of these solutions from first to second order are\npresented. Typical nonlinear wave patterns for the four components of the RMB\nequations such as single-peak, double-peak-double-dip, double-peak and\nsingle-dip structures in the second-order rational solutions are shown. This\nkind of the rational solutions correspond to rogue waves in the reduced\nMaxwell-Bloch equations.\n", "  Minimal area surfaces in AdS$_3$ ending on a given curve at the boundary are\ndual to planar Wilson loops in N=4 SYM. In previous work it was shown that the\nproblem of finding such surfaces can be recast as the one of finding an\nappropriate parameterization of the boundary contour that corresponds to\nconformal gauge. A. Dekel was able to find such reparameterization in a\nperturbative expansion around a circular contour. In this work we show that for\nmore general contours such reparameterization can be found using a numerical\nprocedure that does not rely on a perturbative expansion. This provides further\nchecks and applications of the integrability method. An interesting property of\nthe method is that it uses as data the Schwarzian derivative of the contour and\ntherefore it has manifest global conformal invariance. Finally, we apply Shanks\ntransformation to extend the near circular expansion to larger deformations,\nthe results are in agreement with the new method.\n", "  Large radio telescopes in the 21st century such as the Low-Frequency Array\n(LOFAR) or the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) make use of phased aperture\narrays of antennas to achieve superb survey speeds. The Square Kilometer Array\nlow frequency instrument (SKA1-LOW) will consist of a collection of non-regular\nphased array systems. The prediction of the main beam of these arrays using a\nfew coefficients is crucial for the calibration of the telescope. An effective\napproach to model the main beam and first few sidelobes for large non-regular\narrays is presented. The approach exploits Zernike polynomials to represent the\narray pattern. Starting from the current defined on an equivalence plane\nlocated just above the array, the pattern is expressed as a sum of Fourier\ntransforms of Zernike functions of different orders. The coefficients for\nZernike polynomials are derived by two different means: least-squares and\nanalytical approaches. The analysis shows that both approaches provide a\nsimilar performance for representing the main beam and first few sidelobes.\nMoreover, numerical results for different array configurations are provided,\nwhich demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, also for arrays with\nshapes far from circular.\n", "  We present a detailed, broadband X-ray spectral analysis of the ULX pulsar\nNGC 7793 P13, a known super-Eddington source, utilizing data from the\n$XMM$-$Newton$, $NuSTAR$ and $Chandra$ observatories. The broadband\n$XMM$-$Newton+NuSTAR$ spectrum of P13 is qualitatively similar to the rest of\nthe ULX sample with broadband coverage, suggesting that additional ULXs in the\nknown population may host neutron star accretors. Through time-averaged,\nphase-resolved and multi-epoch studies, we find that two non-pulsed thermal\nblackbody components with temperatures $\\sim$0.5 and $\\sim$1.5 keV are required\nto fit the data below 10 keV, in addition to a third continuum component which\nextends to higher energies and is associated with the pulsed emission from the\naccretion column. The characteristic radii of the thermal components appear to\nbe similar, and are too large to be associated with the neutron star itself, so\nthe need for two components likely indicates the accretion flow outside the\nmagnetosphere is complex. We suggest a scenario in which the thick inner disc\nexpected for super-Eddington accretion begins to form, but is terminated by the\nneutron star's magnetic field soon after its onset, implying a limit of $B\n\\lesssim 6 \\times 10^{12}$ G for the dipolar component of the central neutron\nstar's magnetic field. Evidence of similar termination of the disc in other\nsources may offer a further means of identifying additional neutron star ULXs.\nFinally, we examine the spectrum exhibited by P13 during one of its unusual\n'off' states. These data require both a hard powerlaw component, suggesting\nresidual accretion onto the neutron star, and emission from a thermal plasma,\nwhich we argue is likely associated with the P13 system.\n", "  The possibility of a subdominant component of dark matter dissipating energy\ncould lead to dramatic new phenomenology such as the formation of a dark disk.\nOne rigorous way to assess this possibility and settle the debate on its\nfeasibility is to include the dissipative dark component in a numerical\nhydrodynamical simulation. A necessary input to such a simulation is a\nprescription including energy dissipation rates of different processes and\nrates of processes that change the number densities of dark ions and atoms. In\nthis article, we study the simplest dissipative dark sector which consists of a\ndark electron and proton, both charged under a dark gauged U(1). We present\napproximate analytic formulas for energy loss rates due to Compton scattering,\nbremsstrahlung, recombination, collisional ionization and collisional\nexcitation as well as the rates of number density change. We also include the\nheating rate due to photoionization. The work serves as the first step to\nrealize a numerical simulation including a dissipative dark sector, which\nhopefully can shed more light on the formation and properties of a dark disk\noriginating from dark matter self-interactions.\n", "  The Drude-Smith model has been used extensively in fitting the THz\nconductivities of nanomaterials with carrier confinement on the mesoscopic\nscale. Here, we show that the conventional 'backscattering' explanation for the\nsuppression of low-frequency conductivities in the Drude-Smith model is not\nconsistent with a confined Drude gas of classical non-interacting electrons and\nwe derive a modified Drude-Smith conductivity formula based on a diffusive\nrestoring current. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of a model system and\nshow that the modified Drude-Smith model reproduces the extracted\nconductivities without free parameters. This alternate route to the Drude-Smith\nmodel provides the popular formula with a more solid physical foundation and\nwell-defined fit parameters.\n", "  We describe a dispersive Faraday optical probe of atomic spin which performs\na weak measurement of spin projection of a quantum gas continuously for more\nthan one second. To date focusing bright far-off-resonance probes onto quantum\ngases has proved invasive, due to strong scalar and vector light shifts\nexerting dipole and Stern-Gerlach forces. We show that tuning the probe near\nthe magic-zero wavelength at 790 nm between the fine-structure doublet of\n$^{87}$Rb cancels the scalar light shift, and careful control of polarization\neliminates the vector light shift. Faraday rotations due to each fine-structure\nline reinforce at this wavelength, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio for a\nfixed rate of probe-induced decoherence. Using this minimally-invasive spin\nprobe we perform microscale atomic magnetometry at high temporal resolution.\nSpectrogram analysis of the Larmor precession signal of a single spinor\nBose-Einstein condensate measures a time-varying magnetic field strength with 1\n{\\mu}G accuracy every 5 ms; or equivalently makes > 200 successive measurements\neach at $10\\,\\mathrm{pT/\\sqrt{Hz}}$ sensitivity.\n", "  In most realistic models for quantum chaotic systems, the Hamiltonian\nmatrices in unperturbed bases have a sparse structure. We study correlations in\neigenfunctions of such systems and derive explicit expressions for some of the\ncorrelation functions with respect to energy. The analytical results are tested\nin several models by numerical simulations. An application is given for a\nrelation between transition probabilities.\n", "  The low-energy modes of a spin-imbalanced superfluid Fermi gas in the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) side are studied. The gas is assumed to be\nsufficiently dilute so that the pairing of atoms can be considered effective\nonly in s-wave between fermions of different internal state. The order\nparameter at equilibrium is determined by the mean-field approximation, while\nthe properties of the collective modes are calculated within a Gaussian\napproximation for the fluctuations of the order parameter. In particular we\ninvestigate the effects of asymmetry between the populations of the two\ndifferent components and of temperature on the frequency and damping of\ncollective modes. It is found that the temperature does not much affect the\nfrequency and the damping of the modes, whereas an increase of the imbalance\nshifts the frequency toward lower values and enhances the damping sensitively.\nBesides the Bogoliubov-Anderson phonons, we observe modes at zero frequency for\nfinite values of the wave-number. These modes indicate that an instability\ndevelops driving the system toward two separate phases, normal and superfluid.\n", "  The effect of the Pauli exclusion principle on the nucleus-nucleus bare\npotential is studied using a new density-constrained extension of the\nFrozen-Hartree-Fock (DCFHF) technique. The resulting potentials exhibit a\nrepulsion at short distance. The charge product dependence of this Pauli\nrepulsion is investigated. Dynamical effects are then included in the potential\nwith the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DCTDHF) method. In\nparticular, isovector contributions to this potential are used to investigate\nthe role of transfer on fusion, resulting in a lowering of the inner part of\nthe potential for systems with positive Q-value transfer channels.\n", "  For numerous applications of quantum theory it is desirable to be able to\napply arbitrary unitary operations on a given quantum system. However, in\nparticular situations only a subset of unitary operations is easily accessible.\nThis raises the question of what additional unitary gates should be added to a\ngiven gate-set in order to attain physical universality, i.e., to be able to\nperform arbitrary unitary transformation on the relevant Hilbert space. In this\nwork, we study this problem for three paradigmatic cases of naturally occurring\nrestricted gate-sets: (A) particle-number preserving bosonic linear optics, (B)\nparticle-number preserving fermionic linear optics, and (C) general (not\nnecessarily particle-number preserving) fermionic linear optics. Using tools\nfrom group theory and control theory, we classify, in each of these scenarios,\nwhat sets of gates are generated, if an additional gate is added to the set of\nallowed transformations. This allows us to solve the universality problem\ncompletely for arbitrary number of particles and for arbitrary dimensions of\nthe single-particle Hilbert space.\n", "  We consider a Hamiltonian system which has its origin in a generalization of\nexact renormalization group flow of matrix scalar field theory and describes a\nnon-linear generalization of the shock-wave equation that is known to be\nintegrable. Analyzing conserved currents of the system the letter shows, that\nthese follow a nice pattern governed by coefficients of Motzkin polynomials,\nwhere each integral of motion corresponds to a path on a unit lattice.\n", "  We analyze the response of a type II superconducting wire to an external\nmagnetic field parallel to it in the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory. We\nfocus on the surface superconductivity regime of applied field between the\nsecond and third critical values, where the superconducting state survives only\nclose to the sample's boundary. Our first finding is that, in first\napproximation, the shape of the boundary plays no role in determining the\ndensity of superconducting electrons. A second order term is however isolated,\ndirectly proportional to the mean curvature of the boundary. This demonstrates\nthat points of higher boundary curvature (counted inwards) attract\nsuperconducting electrons.\n", "  We provide numerical evidence that a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs in\nthe Dirac fluid of electrons in graphene and can be detected in current\nexperiments. This instability appears for electrons in the viscous regime\npassing though a micrometer-scale obstacle and affects measurements on the time\nscale of nanoseconds. A possible realization with a needle-shaped obstacle is\nproposed to produce and detect this instability by measuring the electric\npotential difference between contact points located before and after the\nobstacle. We also show that, for our setup, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nleads to the formation of whirlpools similar to the ones reported in Bandurin\net al. [Science 351, 1055 (2016)]. To perform the simulations, we develop a\nlattice Boltzmann method able to recover the full dissipation in a fluid of\nmassless particles.\n", "  The Visual Physics Analysis (VISPA) project defines a toolbox for accessing\nsoftware via the web. It is based on latest web technologies and provides a\npowerful extension mechanism that enables to interface a wide range of\napplications. Beyond basic applications such as a code editor, a file browser,\nor a terminal, it meets the demands of sophisticated experiment-specific use\ncases that focus on physics data analyses and typically require a high degree\nof interactivity. As an example, we developed a data inspector that is capable\nof browsing interactively through event content of several data formats, e.g.,\n\"MiniAOD\" which is utilized by the CMS collaboration. The VISPA extension\nmechanism can also be used to embed external web-based applications that\nbenefit from dynamic allocation of user-defined computing resources via SSH.\nFor example, by wrapping the \"JSROOT\" project, ROOT files located on any remote\nmachine can be inspected directly through a VISPA server instance. We\nintroduced domains that combine groups of users and role-based permissions.\nThereby, tailored projects are enabled, e.g. for teaching where access to\nstudent's homework is restricted to a team of tutors, or for\nexperiment-specific data that may only be accessible for members of the\ncollaboration. We present the extension mechanism including corresponding\napplications and give an outlook onto the new permission system.\n", "  By operating a one-electron quantum dot (fabricated between a multielectron\ndot and a one-electron reference dot) as a spectroscopic probe, we study the\nspin properties of a gate-controlled multielectron GaAs quantum dot at the\ntransition between odd and even occupation number. We observe that the\nmultielectron groundstate transitions from spin-1/2-like to singlet-like to\ntriplet-like as we increase the detuning towards the next higher charge state.\nThe sign reversal in the inferred exchange energy persists at zero magnetic\nfield, and the exchange strength is tunable by gate voltages and in-plane\nmagnetic fields. Complementing spin leakage spectroscopy data, the inspection\nof coherent multielectron spin exchange oscillations provides further evidence\nfor the sign reversal and, inferentially, for the importance of non-trivial\nmultielectron spin exchange correlations.\n", "  We present a selection of the first results obtained in a comprehensive\ncalculation of ground state properties of even-even superheavy nuclei in the\nregion of 96 < Z < 136 and 118 < N < 320 from the Quark-Meson-Coupling model\n(QMC). Ground state binding energies, the neutron and proton number dependence\nof quadrupole deformations and Q$_\\alpha$ values are reported for even-even\nnuclei with 100 < Z < 136 and compared with available experimental data and\npredictions of macro-microscopic models. Predictions of properties of nuclei,\nincluding Q$_\\alpha$ values, relevant for planning future experiments are\npresented.\n", "  The Sun is a main source of high energy neutrinos. These neutrinos appear as\nsecondary particles after the Sun absorbs high-energy cosmic rays, that find\nthere a low-density environment (much thinner than our atmosphere) where most\nsecondary pions, kaons and muons can decay before they lose energy. The main\nuncertainty in a calculation of the solar neutrino flux is due to the effects\nof the magnetic fields on the absorption rate of charged cosmic rays. We use\nrecent data from HAWC on the cosmic-ray shadow of the Sun to estimate this\nrate. We evaluate the solar neutrino flux and show that at 1 TeV it is over ten\ntimes larger than the atmospheric one at zenith theta_z=30^o/150^o. The flux\nthat we obtain has a distinct spectrum and flavor composition, and it could be\ndetected in current and upcoming neutrino telescopes. KM3NeT, in particular,\nlooks very promising: it will see the Sun high in the sky (the atmospheric\nbackground is lower there than near the horizon) and expects a very good\nangular resolution (the Sun's radius is just 0.27^o).\n", "  In this paper we work out a parameterization of the environment noise within\nthe Haken-Strobl-Reinenker (HSR) model for the PE545 light-harvesting complex\nbased on atomic-level quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)\nsimulations. We use this approach to investigate the role of different auto-\nand cross-correlations in the HSR noise tensor, confirming that site-energy\nautocorrelations (pure dephasing) terms dominate the noise-induced exciton\nmobility enhancement, followed by site energy-coupling cross-correlations for\nspecific triplets of pigments. Interestingly, several cross-correlations of the\nlatter kind, together with coupling-coupling cross-correlations, display clear\nlow-frequency signatures in their spectral densities in the region 30-70\ninverse centimeters. These slow components lie at the limits of validity of the\nHSR approach, requiring that environmental fluctuations be faster than typical\nexciton transfer time scales. We show that a simple coarse-grained\nelastic-network-model (ENM) analysis of the PE545 protein naturally spotlights\ncollective normal modes in this frequency range, that represent specific\nconcerted motions of the subnetwork of cysteines that are covalenty linked to\nthe pigments. This analysis strongly suggests that protein scaffolds in\nlight-harvesting complexes are able to express specific collective,\nlow-frequency normal modes providing a fold-rooted blueprint of exciton\ntransport pathways. We speculate that ENM-based mixed quantum classical\nmethods, such as Ehrenfest dynamics, might be promising tools to disentangle\nthe fundamental designing principles of these dynamical processes in natural\nand artificial light-harvesting structures.\n", "  We introduce a novel model for active particles with short-range aligning\ninteractions and study their behaviour in crowded environments using numerical\nsimulations. When only active particles are present, we observe a transition\nfrom a gaseous state to the emergence of metastable clusters as the level of\norientational noise is reduced. When also passive particle are present, we\nobserve the emergence of a network of metastable channels.\n", "  Density functional theory, the most widely used theoretical model in\nchemistry and material science, is gaining more predictive power at the cost of\nbeing more complicated. We believe, however, that it is possible to reach\nhigher accuracy while retaining simplicity. Here we present a novel, and\ncoherent concept of viewing exchange energy of an inhomogeneous electron\ndensity as a gradual progression between the perfectly uniform electron gas,\nand the Coulombic decay when asymptotically far away from nuclei. The concept\nleads to a simple functional; and despite its unique simplicity, it is one of\nthe most accurate exchange functional to date. The interpolating variable is\nfurther interpreted as an expansion of separating distance between neighboring\nelectrons. Connections between the topology interpretation and the applications\nfor identifying chemical bonds are briefly discussed.\n", "  We investigate the steady state phase diagram of two-component driven open\ncondensates in one dimension. We identify a miscible-immiscible transition\nwhich is predominantly driven by gapped density fluctuations and occurs upon\nincreasing the inter-component inelastic coupling. Below the transition in the\nmiscible phase, we find the effective long wavelength dynamics to be described\nby a two-component Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation that belongs to the\nnonequilibrium universality class of the one-dimensional single-component KPZ\nequation at generic choices of parameters. Our results are relevant for\ndifferent experimental realizations for two-component driven open condensates\nin exciton-polariton systems.\n", "  We study a sufficient condition to prove the stability of a black hole when\nthe master equation for linear perturbation takes the form of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. If the potential contains a small negative region, usually, the\n$S$-deformation method was used to show the non-existence of unstable mode.\nHowever, in some cases, it is hard to find an appropriate deformation function\nanalytically because the only way known so far to find it is a try-and-error\napproach. In this paper, we show that it is easy to find a regular deformation\nfunction by numerically solving the differential equation such that the\ndeformed potential vanishes everywhere, when the spacetime is stable. Even if\nthe spacetime is almost marginally stable, our method still works. We also\ndiscuss a simple toy model which can be solved analytically, and show the\ncondition for the non-existence of a bound state is the same as that for the\nexistence of a regular solution for the differential equation in our method.\nFrom these results, we conjecture that our criteria is also a necessary\ncondition.\n", "  We report on a detailed study of the spectral and temporal properties of the\nneutron star low mass X-ray binary SLX 1737-282, which is located only ~1degr\naway from Sgr A. The system is expected to have a short orbital period, even\nwithin the ultra-compact regime, given its persistent nature at low X-ray\nluminosities and the long duration thermonuclear burst that it has displayed.\nWe have analysed a Suzaku (18 ks) observation and an XMM-Newton (39 ks)\nobservation taken 7 years apart. We infer (0.5-10 keV) X-ray luminosities in\nthe range 3-6 x10^35erg s-1, in agreement with previous findings. The spectra\nare well described by a relatively cool (kTbb = 0.5 keV) black body component\nplus a Comptonized emission component with {\\Gamma} ~1.5-1.7. These values are\nconsistent with the source being in a faint hard state, as confirmed by the ~\n20 per cent fractional root mean square amplitude of the fast variability (0.1\n- 7 Hz) inferred from the XMM-Newton data. The electron temperature of the\ncorona is >7 keV for the Suzaku observation, but it is measured to be as low as\n~2 keV in the XMM-Newton data at higher flux. The latter is significantly lower\nthan expected for systems in the hard state. We searched for X-ray pulsations\nand imposed an upper limit to their semi-amplitude of 2 per cent (0.001 - 7\nHz). Finally, we investigated the origin of the low frequency variability\nemission present in the XMM-Newton data and ruled out an absorption dip origin.\nThis constraint the orbital inclination of the system to 65 degr unless the\norbital period is longer than 11 hr (i.e. the length of the XMM-Newton\nobservation).\n", "  The Prototypical magnetic memory shape alloy Ni$_2$MnGa undergoes various\nphase transitions as a function of temperature, pressure, and doping. In the\nlow-temperature phases below 260 K, an incommensurate structural modulation\noccurs along the [110] direction which is thought to arise from softening of a\nphonon mode. It is not at present clear how this phenomenon is related, if at\nall, to the magnetic memory effect. Here we report time-resolved measurements\nwhich track both the structural and magnetic components of the phase transition\nfrom the modulated cubic phase as it is brought into the high-symmetry phase.\nThe results suggest that the photoinduced demagnetization modifies the Fermi\nsurface in regions that couple strongly to the periodicity of the structural\nmodulation through the nesting vector. The amplitude of the periodic lattice\ndistortion, however, appears to be less affected by the demagnetizaton.\n", "  We measure the gate voltage ($V_g$) dependence of the superconducting\nproperties and the spin-orbit interaction in the (111)-oriented\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. Superconductivity is observed in a dome-shaped\nregion in the carrier density-temperature phase diagram with the maxima of\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the upper critical fields\nlying at the same $V_g$. The spin-orbit interaction determined from the\nsuperconducting parameters and confirmed by weak-antilocalization measurements\nfollows the same gate voltage dependence as $T_c$. The correlation between the\nsuperconductivity and spin-orbit interaction as well as the enhancement of the\nparallel upper critical field, well beyond the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit\nsuggest that superconductivity and the spin-orbit interaction are linked in a\nnontrivial fashion. We propose possible scenarios to explain this\nunconventional behavior.\n", "  The pseudospectral code bamps is used to evolve axisymmetric gravitational\nwaves. We consider a one-parameter family of Brill wave initial data, taking\nthe seed function and strength parameter of Holz et. al. A careful comparison\nis made to earlier work. Our results are mostly in agreement with the\nliterature, but we do find that some amplitudes reported elsewhere as\nsubcritical evolve to form apparent horizons. Related to this point we find\nthat by altering the slicing condition, the position of the peak of the\nKretschmann scalar in these supercritical data can be controlled so that it\nappears away from the symmetry axis before the method fails, demonstrating that\nsuch behavior is at least partially a coordinate effect. We are able to tune\nthe strength parameter to an interval of range $1-A_\\star/A\\simeq10^{-6}$\naround the onset of apparent horizon formation. In this regime we find that\nlarge spikes appear in the Kretschmann scalar on the symmetry axis but away\nfrom the origin. From the supercritical side disjoint apparent horizons form\naround these spikes. On the subcritical side, down to this range, evidence of\npower-law scaling of the Kretschmann scalar is not conclusive, but the data can\nbe fitted as a power-law with periodic wiggle.\n", "  Recent works have proved that semi-classical theories of gravity needed not\nbe fundamentally inconsistent, at least in the Newtonian regime. Using the\nmachinery of continuous measurement theory and feedback, it was shown that one\ncould construct well behaved models of hybrid quantum-classical dynamics at the\nprice of an imposed (non unique) decoherence structure. We introduce a\nprinciple of least decoherence (PLD) which allows to naturally single out a\nunique model from all the available options; up to some unspecified short\ndistance regularization scale. Interestingly, the resulting model is found to\ncoincide with the old --erstwhile only heuristically motivated-- proposal of\nPenrose and one of us for gravity-related spontaneous decoherence and collapse.\nFinally, this letter suggests that it is in the submillimeter behavior of\ngravity that new phenomena might be found.\n", "  Preserving data analyses produced by the collaborations at LHC in a\nparametrized fashion is crucial in order to maintain reproducibility and\nre-usability. We argue for a declarative description in terms of individual\nprocessing steps - packtivities - linked through a dynamic directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG) and present an initial set of JSON schemas for such a description\nand an implementation - yadage - capable of executing workflows of analysis\npreserved via Linux containers.\n", "  We consider an analysis of potentials related to Schr\\\"odinger-type equations\nfor scalar fields in a 5D AdS black hole background with dilaton in order to\nget melting temperatures for different hadrons in a thermal bath. The approach\ndoes not consider calculations of spectral functions and it is easy to get\nresults for hadrons with an arbitrary number of constituents. We present\nresults for scalar mesons, glueballs, hybrid mesons and tetraquarks, and we\nshow that mesons are more resistant to being melted in a thermal bath than\nother scalar hadrons, and in general the melting temperature increases when\nhadrons contain heavy quarks.\n", "  We present results from a coordinated $XMM$-$Newton$+$NuSTAR$ observation of\nthe type 1.8 Seyfert galaxy IRAS 13197-1627. This is a highly complex source,\nwith strong contributions from relativistic reflection from the inner accretion\ndisk, neutral absorption and further reprocessing by more distant material, and\nionised absorption from an outflow. We undertake a detailed spectral analysis\ncombining the broadband coverage provided by $XMM$-$Newton$+$NuSTAR$ with a\nmulti-epoch approach incorporating archival observations performed by\n$XMM$-$Newton$ and $Suzaku$. Our focus is on characterising the reflection from\nthe inner accretion disk, which previous works have suggested may dominate the\nAGN emission, and constraining the black hole spin. Using lamppost disk\nreflection models, we find that the results for the inner disk are largely\ninsensitive to assumptions regarding the geometry of the distant reprocessor\nand the precise form of the illuminating X-ray continuum. However, these\nresults do depend on the treatment of the iron abundance of the distant\nabsorber/reprocessor. The multi-epoch data favour a scenario in which the AGN\nis chemically homogeneous, and we find that a rapidly rotating black hole is\npreferred, with $a^* \\geq 0.7$, but a slowly-rotating black hole is not\nstrongly excluded. In addition to the results for the inner disk, we also find\nthat both the neutral and ionised absorbers vary from epoch to epoch, implying\nthat both have some degree of inhomogeneity in their structure.\n", "  All symmetric space AdS(n) solutions of ten-dimensional type IIA and type IIB\nsupergravity are constructed for n>2. There are a total of 26 geometries. Out\nof these only 7 allow for supersymmetries and these are the well known\nbackgrounds coming from near-horizon limits of (intersecting) branes in ten or\neleven dimensions and preserving 32, 16 or 8 supersymmetries.\n", "  The most dramatic \"Sommerfeld enhancements\" of neutral-wino-pair annihilation\noccur when the wino mass is near a critical value where there is a zero-energy\nS-wave resonance at the neutral-wino-pair threshold. Near such a critical mass,\nlow-energy winos can be described by a zero-range effective field theory in\nwhich the winos interact nonperturbatively through a contact interaction. The\neffective field theory is controlled by a renormalization-group fixed point at\nwhich the neutral and charged winos are degenerate in mass and their scattering\nlength is infinite. The parameters of the zero-range effective field theory can\nbe determined by matching wino-wino scattering amplitudes calculated by solving\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation for winos interacting through a potential due to the\nexchange of weak gauge bosons. If the wino mass is larger than the critical\nvalue, the resonance is a wino-pair bound state. The power of the zero-range\neffective field theory is illustrated by calculating the rate for formation of\nthe bound state in the collision of two neutral winos through the emission of\ntwo soft photons.\n", "  The possibility of realizing fractional quantum Hall liquids in photonic\nsystems has attracted a great deal of interest of late. Unlike electronic\nsystems, interactions in photonic systems must be engineered from non-linear\nelements and are thus subject to positional disorder. The stability of the\ntopological liquid relies on repulsive interactions. In this paper we\ninvestigate the stability of fractional quantum Hall liquids to impurities\nwhich host attractive interactions. We find that for sufficiently strong\nattractive interactions these impurities can destroy the topological liquid.\nHowever, we find that the liquid is quite robust to these defects, a fact which\nbodes well for the realization of topological quantum Hall liquids in photonic\nsystems.\n", "  We investigate quenches of holographic theories in a confined phase, where\nthe energy injected is insufficient to reach the deconfined phase. In such\nquenches, thermalization is not associated with gravitational collapse and the\nformation of a black hole. Nevertheless, we attempt to characterize the\nlate-time state of this scenario. We check a number of notions of\nthermalization that do not require horizon formation, and find no evidence for\nthermalization in our chosen parameters and initial states, even in the weakest\nsense.\n  We find that the post-quench behaviour of both local and nonlocal observables\nexhibit oscillatory behaviour rather than decaying towards equilibrium. We\ngenerally find that the response of the nonlocal observables is smoother than\nthat of the local ones. We discuss mechanisms which generate such smoothing, as\nwell as \"beats\" which appear in the time-dependence of the nonlocal operators\nfor certain classes of quenches. When tuning the quench parameters such that\nthe smoothing is ineffective, we are able to perform \"entanglement\nspectroscopy\", recovering the spectrum of the confined phase of the theory from\nthe time dependence of the entanglement entropy, as well as other nonlocal\nobservables.\n", "  We analyze the unusual slow dynamics that emerges in the bad metal\ndelocalized phase preceding the Many-Body Localization transition by using\nsingle-particle Anderson Localization on the Bethe lattice as a toy model of\nmany-body dynamics in Fock space. We probe the dynamical evolution by measuring\nobservables such as the imbalance and equilibrium correlation functions, which\ndisplay slow dynamics and power-laws strikingly similar to the ones observed in\nrecent simulations and experiments. We relate this unusual behavior to the\nnon-ergodic spectral statistics found on Bethe lattices. We discuss different\nscenarii, such as a true intermediate phase which persists in the thermodynamic\nlimit versus a glassy regime established on finite but very large time and\nlength-scales only, and their implications for real space dynamical properties.\nIn the latter, slow dynamics and power-laws extend on a very large time-window\nbut are eventually cut-off on a time-scale that diverges at the MBL transition.\n", "  The equations of hydrodynamics including mass, linear momentum, angular\nmomentum, and energy are derived by coarse-graining the microscopic equations\nof motion for systems consisting of rotary dumbbells driven by internal\ntorques.\n", "  We report high-pressure magnetization and $^{35}$Cl NMR studies on\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with pressure up to 1.5~GPa. At low pressures, the magnetic\nordering is identified by both the magnetization data and the NMR data, where\nthe $T_N$ shows a concave shape dependence with pressure. These data suggest\nstacking rearrangement along the $c$-axis. With increasing pressure, phase\nseparation appears prominently at $P\\ge$~0.45~GPa, and the magnetic volume\nfraction is completely suppressed at $P\\ge$~1.05~GPa. Meanwhile, a\nphase-transition-like behavior emerges at high pressures in the remaining\nvolume by a sharp drop of magnetization $M(T)$ upon cooling, with the\ntransition temperature $T_x$ increased to ~250~K at 1~GPa. The $1/^{35}T_1$ is\nreduced by over three orders of magnitude when cooled below 100~K. This\ncharacterizes a high-pressure, low-temperature phase with nearly absent static\nsusceptibility and low-energy spin fluctuations. The nature of the\nhigh-pressure ground state is discussed, where a magnetically disordered state\nis proposed as a candidate state.\n", "  For more than 20 years, observation of the non-dissipative Hall viscosity in\nthe quantum Hall effect has been impeded by the difficulty to probe directly\nthe momentum of the two-dimensional electron gas. However, in three-dimensional\nsystems such as superfluid ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathrm{B}$, the momentum\ndensity is readily probed through transverse acoustic waves. We show that in a\nthree-dimensional elastic medium supporting transverse waves, a non-vanishing\nHall viscosity induces circular birefringence. Such an effect has been observed\nin ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathrm{B}$ in the presence of a weak magnetic\nfield, and is known as the acoustic Faraday effect. The acoustic Faraday effect\nhas been understood in terms of the Zeeman splitting of the excited order\nparameter modes which support the transverse wave propagation in the\nsuperfluid. We show that the Zeeman effect can generically lead to a non-zero\nHall viscosity coefficient, and confirm this prediction using a simple\nphenomenological model for the ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathrm{B}$\ncollective modes. Therefore, we claim that the observation of the acoustic\nFaraday effect can be leveraged to make a direct observation of the Hall\nviscosity in superfluid ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He}\\!\\!-\\!\\!\\mathrm{B}$ in a magnetic\nfield and other systems such as the crystalline\n$\\mathrm{Tb}_{3}\\mathrm{Ga}_{5}\\mathrm{O}_{12}$ material.\n", "  Spin waves can induce domain wall motion in ferromagnets. We derive the\nequations of motion for a transverse domain wall driven by spin waves. Our\ncalculations show that the magnonic spin-transfer torque does not cause\nrotation-induced Walker breakdown. The amplitude of spin waves that are excited\nby a localized microwave field depends on the spatial profile of the field and\nthe excitation frequency. By taking this frequency dependence into account, we\nshow that a simple one-dimensional model may reproduce much of the puzzling\nfrequency dependence observed in early numerical studies.\n", "  We analyze a minimal model for a rigid spherical microswimmer and explore the\nconsequences of its extended surface on the interplay between its\nself-propulsion and flow properties. The model is the first order\nrepresentation of microswimmers, such as bacteria and algae, with rigid bodies\nand flexible propelling appendages. The flow field of such a microswimmer at\nfinite distances significantly differs from that of a point-force (Stokeslet)\ndipole. For a suspension of microswimmers, we derive the grand mobility matrix\nthat connects the motion of an individual swimmer to the active and passive\nforces and torques acting on all the swimmers. Our investigation of the\nmobility tensors reveals that hydrodynamic interactions among rigid-bodied\nmicroswimmers differ considerably from those among the corresponding\npoint-force dipoles. Our results are relevant for the study of collective\nbehavior of hydrodynamically interacting microswimmers by means of Stokesian\ndynamics simulations at moderate concentrations.\n", "  We present a fully integrated InGaAs/InP negative feedback avalanche diode\n(NFAD) based free-running single-photon detector (SPD) designed for accurate\nlidar applications. A free-piston Stirling cooler is used to cool down the NFAD\nwith a large temperature range, and an active hold-off circuit implemented in a\nfield programmable gate array is applied to further suppress the afterpulsing\ncontribution. The key parameters of the free-running SPD including photon\ndetection efficiency (PDE), dark count rate (DCR), afterpulse probability, and\nmaximum count rate (MCR) are dedicatedly optimized for lidar application in\npractice. We then perform a field experiment using a Mie lidar system with 20\nkHz pulse repetition frequency to compare the performance between the\nfree-running InGaAs/InP SPD and a commercial superconducting nanowire\nsingle-photon detector (SNSPD). Our detector exhibits good performance with 1.6\nMcps MCR (0.6 {\\mu}s hold-off time), 10% PDE, 950 cps DCR, and 18% afterpulse\nprobability over 50 {\\mu}s period. Such performance is worse than the SNSPD\nwith 60% PDE and 300 cps DCR. However, after performing a specific algorithm\nthat we have developed for afterpulse and count rate corrections, the lidar\nsystem performance in terms of range-corrected signal (Pr2) distribution using\nour SPD agrees very well with the result using the SNSPD, with only a relative\nerror of ~2%. Due to the advantages of low-cost and small size of InGaAs/InP\nNFADs, such detector provides a practical solution for accurate lidar\napplications.\n", "  We study color entanglement effect for T-odd cases in collinear twist-3\nfactorization. As an example, we compute the transverse single spin asymmetry\nfor direct photon production in pp collisions in pure collinear twist-3\napproach. By analyzing the gauge link structure of the collinear gluon\ndistribution on unpolarized target side, we demonstrate how color entanglement\neffect arises in the presence of the additional gluon attachment from polarized\nprojectile. The result is consistent with that obtained from a hybrid approach\ncalculation.\n", "  We discuss the only two viable realizations of fermion compositeness\ndescribed by a calculable relativistic effective field theory consistent with\nunitarity, crossing symmetry and analyticity: chiral-compositeness vs\ngoldstino-compositeness. We construct the effective theory of $\\mathcal{N}$\nGoldstini and show how the Standard Model can emerge from this dynamics. We\npresent new bounds on either type of compositeness, for quarks and leptons,\nusing dilepton searches at LEP, dijets at the LHC, as well as low-energy\nobservables and precision measurements. Remarkably, a scale of compositeness\nfor Goldstino-like electrons in the 2 TeV range is compatible with present\ndata, and so are Goldstino-like first generation quarks with a compositeness\nscale in the 10 TeV range. Moreover, assuming maximal $R$-symmetry,\ngoldstino-compositeness of both right- and left-handed quarks predicts exotic\nspin-1/2 colored sextet particles that are potentially within the reach of the\nLHC.\n", "  We develop a framework for deriving Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSEs) and\nBethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The starting point\nis a modified form (with auxiliary fields) of QCD generating functional. This\nframework provides a natural order-by-order truncation scheme for DSEs and BSE,\nand the kernels of the equations up to any order are explicitly given. Chiral\nsymmetry (at chiral limit) is preserved in any order truncation, so it\nexemplifies the symmetry preserving truncation scheme. It provides a method to\nstudy DSEs and BSE beyond the Rainbow-Ladder truncation, and is especially\nuseful to study contributions from non-Abelian dynamics (those arise from gluon\nself-interactions). We also derive the equation for the quark-ghost scattering\nkernel, and discuss the Slavnov-Taylor identity connecting the quark-gluon\nvertex, the quark propagator and the quark-ghost scattering kernel.\n", "  Engineering entanglement between quantum systems often involves coupling\nthrough a bosonic mediator, which should be disentangled from the systems at\nthe operation's end. The quality of such an operation is generally limited by\nenvironmental and control noise. One of the prime techniques for suppressing\nnoise is by dynamical decoupling, where one actively applies pulses at a rate\nthat is faster than the typical time scale of the noise. However, for\nboson-mediated gates, current dynamical decoupling schemes require executing\nthe pulses only when the boson and the quantum systems are disentangled. This\nrestriction implies an increase of the gate time by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$,\nwith $N$ being the number of pulses applied. Here we propose and realize a\nmethod that enables dynamical decoupling in a boson mediated system where the\npulses can be applied while spin-boson entanglement persists, resulting in an\nincrease in time that is at most a factor of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, independently of\nthe number of pulses applied. We experimentally demonstrate the robustness of\nour fast dynamically decoupled entangling gate to $\\sigma_z$ noise with ions in\na Paul trap.\n", "  We studied one-dimensional systems formed by $N$ identical particles confined\nin a harmonic trap and subject to an inverse power law interaction potential\n$\\sim|x|^{-d}$. The correlation properties of a Wigner molecule with the lowest\nenergy are investigated in terms of their dependence on the number $N$ and the\npower $d$, including the limit as $d\\rightarrow 0$. There are $N$-particle\nWigner molecules with properties such that their correlations are mainly\nmanifested in the $N$ lowest natural orbitals. The values of the control\nparameters of the system at which such states appear are identified. The\nproperties of Wigner molecules formed in the limit as $d$ approaches infinity\nare also revealed.\n", "  Hall viscosity is a non-dissipative response function describing momentum\ntransport in two-dimensional systems with broken parity. It is quantized in the\nquantum Hall regime, and contains information about the topological order of\nthe quantum Hall state. Hall viscosity can distinguish different quantum Hall\nstates with identical Hall conductances, but different topological order. To\ndate, an experimentally accessible signature of Hall viscosity is lacking. We\nexploit the fact that Hall viscosity contributes to charge transport at finite\nwavelengths, and can therefore be extracted from non-local resistance\nmeasurements in inhomogeneous charge flows. We explain how to determine the\nHall viscosity from such a transport experiment. In particular, we show that\nthe profile of the electrochemical potential close to contacts where current is\ninjected is sensitive to the value of the Hall viscosity.\n", "  The hypothesis of the new stable heavy hadrons existence is proposed which\nfollows from Cosmic rays physics indirect data. It is shown that the hypothesis\ndoes not contradict Cosmochemical data, Cosmological test and the restrictions\non New Physics effects. This conclusion is based on the most important property\nof the new hadrons - repulsion strong interaction with nucleons at large\ndistance asymptote. This effect is substantiated theoretically in the framework\nof the low-energy hadron interaction model. Some extensions of Standard Model\nis considered where new stable and metastable quarks appear.\n", "  A number of recent experiments have highlighted a remarkable transformation\nof a large cuprate Fermi surface into small pockets in the underdoped region\nsignalling a breakdown of a conventional Fermi liquid theory in the PG phase. A\nfew phenomenological models have been recently put forward to account for this\ntransformation. However, none of those models have been derived microscopically\nnor are totally compatible with experimental data. In the present work we show\nthat the observed Fermi-surface reconstruction can be accounted for directly\nwithin a standard microscopic $t-J$ model of correlated electrons, provided\nstrong electron correlations are properly taken into account.\n", "  We consider the production of an arbitrary number of colour-singlet particles\nnear partonic threshold, and show that next-to-leading order cross sections for\nthis class of processes have a simple universal form at next-to-leading power\n(NLP) in the energy of the emitted gluon radiation. Our analysis relies on a\nrecently derived factorisation formula for NLP threshold effects at amplitude\nlevel, and therefore applies both if the leading-order process is tree-level\nand if it is loop-induced. It holds for differential distributions as well. The\nresults can furthermore be seen as applications of recently derived\nnext-to-soft theorems for gauge theory amplitudes. We use our universal\nexpression to re-derive known results for the production of up to three Higgs\nbosons at NLO in the large top mass limit, and for the hadro-production of a\npair of electroweak gauge bosons. Finally, we present new analytic results for\nHiggs boson pair production at NLO and NLP, with exact top-mass dependence.\n", "  Computing the exact spectrum of charged massless matter is a crucial step\ntowards understanding the effective field theory describing F-theory vacua in\nfour dimensions. In this work we further develop a coherent framework to\ndetermine the charged massless matter in F-theory compactified on elliptic\nfourfolds, and demonstrate its application in a concrete example. The gauge\nbackground is represented, via duality with M-theory, by algebraic cycles\nmodulo rational equivalence. Intersection theory within the Chow ring allows us\nto extract coherent sheaves on the base of the elliptic fibration whose\ncohomology groups encode the charged zero-mode spectrum. The dimensions of\nthese cohomology groups are computed with the help of modern techniques from\nalgebraic geometry, which we implement in the software gap. We exemplify this\napproach in models with an Abelian and non-Abelian gauge group and observe\njumps in the exact massless spectrum as the complex structure moduli are\nvaried. An extended mathematical appendix gives a self-contained introduction\nto the algebro-geometric concepts underlying our framework.\n", "  Delamination of thin films from the supportive substrates is critical issues\nin thin film industry and technology. The emergent two-dimensional materials,\natomic layered materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides are highly\nflexible thus the buckles and wrinkles can be easily generated and play vital\neffects on the physical properties. Here we introduce one kind of patterned\nbuckling behavior caused by the delamination from substrate initiated at the\nedges of the chemical vapor deposition synthesized monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides, mainly due to the thermal expansion mismatch. The atomic force\nmicroscopy and optical characterizations clearly showed the puckered structures\nassociated with strains, whereas the transmission electron microscopy revealed\nthe special sawtooth shaped edge structures which break the geometrical\nsymmetry of the buckling behavior of hexagonal samples. The condition of this\nedge delamination is in accordance with the fracture theory. This edge\ndelamination process and buckling upon synthesis is universal for most of the\nultrathin two dimensional materials, and it is definitely noteworthy in their\nfuture applications.\n", "  By adding an extra Hilbert space to Hadamard Quantum Walk on Cycles (QWC), we\npresented a new type of QWCs called M\\\"obius Quantum Walk (MQW). The new space\nconfiguration enables the particle to rotate around the axis of movement. We\ndefined factor $\\alpha$ as the M\\\"obius factor which is number of rotations per\ncycle. So by $\\alpha=0$ we have normal QWC, while $\\alpha \\neq 0$ defines new\ntype of QWC (namely M\\\"obius Quantum Walk). Specially $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$\ndefines a structure similar to M\\\"obius strip. We analytically investigated\nthis new type of QW and found that by tuning the parameter $\\alpha$ we can\nreach uniform distribution for any number of nodes, while it is impossible for\nQWC. The effects of $\\alpha$ on limiting distribution have been investigated\nand an explicit formula for non-uniform cases has been derived as well.\n", "  We consider the lagrangian description of Argyres-Douglas theories of type\n$A_{2N-1}$, which is a $SU(N)$ gauge theory with an adjoint and one fundamental\nflavor. An appropriate reformulation allows us to map the moduli space of vacua\nacross the duality, and to dimensionally reduce. Going down to three\ndimensions, we find that the adjoint SQCD \"abelianizes\": in the infrared it is\nequivalent to a $\\mathcal{N}=4$ linear quiver theory. Moreover, we study the\nmirror dual: using a monopole duality to \"sequentially confine\" quivers tails\nwith balanced nodes, we show that the mirror RG flow lands on $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nSQED with $N$ flavors. These results provide a physical derivation of previous\nproposals for the three dimensional mirror of AD theories.\n", "  Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we investigate oxide-induced\ngrowth pits in Si thin films deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. In the\ntransition temperature range from 2D adatom islanding to step-flow growth,\nsystematic controlled air leaks into the growth chamber induce pits in the\ngrowth surface. We show that pits are also correlated with oxygen-contaminated\nflux from Si sublimation sources. From a thermodynamic standpoint, multilayer\ngrowth pits are unexpected in relaxed homoepitaxial growth, whereas oxidation\nis a known cause for step pinning, roughening, and faceting on elemental\nsurfaces, both with and without growth flux. Not surprisingly, pits are\nthermodynamically metastable and heal by annealing to recover a smooth periodic\nstep arrangement. STM reveals new details about the pits' atomistic origins and\ngrowth dynamics. We give a model for heterogeneous nucleation of pits by\npreferential adsorption of {\\AA}-sized oxide nuclei at intrinsic growth\nantiphase boundaries, and subsequent step pinning and bunching around the\nnuclei.\n", "  We study spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in spatially modulated stable or\nmeta-stable vacua in supersymmetric field theories. Such spatial modulation can\nbe realized in a higher derivative chiral model for which vacuum energies are\neither positive, negative or zero, depending on the model parameters. There\nappears a Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneously breaking of\nthe translational and $U(1)$ symmetries without the quadratic kinetic term and\nwith a quartic derivative term in the modulated direction, and a gapless Higgs\nmode. We show that there appears a Goldstino associated with the supersymmetry\nbreaking at a meta-stable vacuum, where energy is positive, while it becomes a\nfermionic ghost in the negative energy vacuum, and zero norm state and\ndisappears from the physical sector in the zero energy vacuum.\n", "  The calculation of the Higgs mass in general renormalisable field theories\nhas been plagued by the so-called \"Goldstone Boson Catastrophe\", where light\n(would-be) Goldstone bosons give infra-red divergent loop integrals. In\nsupersymmetric models, previous approaches included a workaround that\nameliorated the problem for most, but not all, parameter space regions; while\ngiving divergent results everywhere for non-supersymmetric models! We present\nan implementation of a general solution to the problem in the public code\nSARAH, along with new calculations of some necessary loop integrals and generic\nexpressions. We discuss the validation of our code in the Standard Model, where\nwe find remarkable agreement with the known results. We then show new\napplications in Split SUSY, the NMSSM, the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model, and the\nGeorgi-Machacek model. In particular, we take some first steps to exploring\nwhere the habit of using tree-level mass relations in non-supersymmetric models\nbreaks down, and show that the loop corrections usually become very large well\nbefore naive perturbativity bounds are reached.\n", "  Common lore suggests that $N$-color QCD with massive quarks has no useful\norder parameters which can be non-trivial at zero baryon density. However, such\norder parameters do exist when there are $n_f$ quark flavors with a common mass\nand $d\\equiv\\gcd(n_f,N) > 1$. These theories have a $\\mathbb Z_d$ color-flavor\ncenter symmetry arising from intertwined color center transformations and\ncyclic flavor permutations. The symmetry realization depends on the\ntemperature, baryon chemical potential and value of $n_f/N$, with implications\nfor conformal window studies and dense quark matter.\n", "  It is known that there are AdS vacua obtained from compactifying the SM to 2\nor 3 dimensions. The existence of such vacua depends on the value of neutrino\nmasses through the Casimir effect. Using the Weak Gravity Conjecture, it has\nbeen recently argued by Ooguri and Vafa that such vacua are incompatible with\nthe SM embedding into a consistent theory of quantum gravity. We study the\nlimits obtained for both the cosmological constant $\\Lambda_4$ and neutrino\nmasses from the absence of such dangerous 3D and 2D SM AdS vacua. One\ninteresting implication is that $\\Lambda_4$ is bounded to be larger than a\nscale of order $m_\\nu^4$, as observed experimentally. Interestingly, this is\nthe first argument implying a non-vanishing $\\Lambda_4$ only on the basis of\nparticle physics, with no cosmological input. Conversely, the observed\n$\\Lambda_4$ implies strong constraints on neutrino masses in the SM and also\nfor some BSM extensions including extra Weyl or Dirac spinors, gravitinos and\naxions. The upper bounds obtained for neutrino masses imply (for fixed neutrino\nYukawa and $\\Lambda_4$) the existence of upper bounds on the EW scale. In the\ncase of massive Majorana neutrinos with a see-saw mechanism associated to a\nlarge scale $M\\simeq 10^{10-14}$ GeV and $Y_{\\nu_1}\\simeq 10^{-3}$, one obtains\nthat the EW scale cannot exceed $M_{EW}\\lesssim 10^2-10^4$ GeV. From this point\nof view, the delicate fine-tuning required to get a small EW scale would be a\nmirage, since parameters yielding higher EW scales would be in the swampland\nand would not count as possible consistent theories. This would bring a new\nperspective into the issue of the EW hierarchy.\n", "  We have performed a high sensitivity observation of the UFO/BAL quasar APM\n08279+5255 at z=3.912 with NOEMA at 3.2 mm, aimed at detecting fast moving\nmolecular gas. We report the detection of blueshifted CO(4-3) with maximum\nvelocity (v95\\%) of $-1340$ km s$^{-1}$, with respect to the systemic peak\nemission, and a luminosity of $L' = 9.9\\times 10^9 ~\\mu^{-1}$ K km s$^{-1}$\npc$^{-2}$ (where $\\mu$ is the lensing magnification factor). We discuss various\nscenarios for the nature of this emission, and conclude that this is the first\ndetection of fast molecular gas at redshift $>3$. We derive a mass flow rate of\nmolecular gas in the range $\\rm \\dot M=3-7.4\\times 10^3$ M$_\\odot$/yr, and\nmomentum boost $\\dot P_{OF} / \\dot P_{AGN} \\sim 2-6$, therefore consistent with\na momentum conserving flow. For the largest $\\dot P_{OF}$ the scaling is also\nconsistent with a energy conserving flow with an efficiency of $\\sim$10-20\\%.\nThe present data can hardly discriminate between the two expansion modes. The\nmass loading factor of the molecular outflow $\\eta=\\dot M_{OF}/SFR$ is $>>1$.\nWe also detect a molecular emission line at a frequency of 94.83 GHz,\ncorresponding to a rest frame frequency of 465.8 GHz, which we tentatively\nidentified with the cation molecule $\\rm N_2H^+$(5-4), which would be the first\ndetection of this species at high redshift. We discuss the alternative\npossibility that this emission is due to a CO emission line from the, so far\nundetected, lens galaxy. Further observations of additional transitions of the\nsame species with NOEMA can discriminate between the two scenarios.\n", "  We consider a family of classical elliptic integrable systems including\n(relativistic) tops and their matrix extensions of different types. These\nmodels can be obtained from the \"off-shell\" Lax pairs, which do not satisfy the\nLax equations in general case but become true Lax pairs under various\nconditions (reductions). At the level of the off-shell Lax matrix there is a\nnatural symmetry between the spectral parameter $z$ and relativistic parameter\n$\\eta$. It is generated by the finite Fourier transformation, which we describe\nin detail. The symmetry allows to consider $z$ and $\\eta$ on an equal footing.\nDepending on the type of integrable reduction any of the parameters can be\nchosen to be the spectral one. Then another one is the relativistic deformation\nparameter. As a by-product we describe the model of $N^2$ interacting $GL(M)$\nmatrix tops and/or $M^2$ interacting $GL(N)$ matrix tops depending on a choice\nof the spectral parameter.\n", "  This letter investigates a flow-free, pseudospin-based acoustic topological\ninsulator. Zone folding, a strategy originated from photonic crystal, is used\nto form double Dirac cones in phononic crystal. The lattice symmetry of the\nphononic crystal is broken by tuning the size of the center \"atom\" of the unit\ncell in order to open the nontrivial topological gap. Robust sound one-way\npropagation is demonstrated both numerically and experimentally. This study\nprovides a flexible approach for realizing acoustic topological insulators,\nwhich are promising for applications such as noise control and waveguide\ndesign.\n", "  We provide a full quantization of the vacuum Gowdy model with local\nrotational symmetry. We consider a redefinition of the constraints where the\nHamiltonian Poisson-commutes with itself. We then apply the canonical\nquantization program of loop quantum gravity within an improved dynamics\nscheme. We identify the exact solutions of the constraints and the physical\nobservables, and we construct the physical Hilbert space. It is remarkable that\nquantum spacetimes are free of singularities. New quantum observables naturally\narising in the treatment partially codify the discretization of the geometry.\nThe preliminary analysis of the asymptotic future/past of the evolution\nindicates that the existing Abelianization technique needs further refinement.\n", "  The direct detection of dark matter particles requires ultra-low background\nconditions at energies below a few tens of keV. Radioactive isotopes are\nproduced via cosmogenic activation in detectors and other materials and those\nisotopes constitute a background source which has to be under control. In\nparticular, tritium is specially relevant due to its decay properties (very low\nendpoint energy and long half-life) when induced in the detector medium, and\nbecause it can be generated in any material as a spallation product.\nQuantification of cosmogenic production of tritium is not straightforward,\nneither experimentally nor by calculations. In this work, a method for the\ncalculation of production rates at sea level has been developed and applied to\nsome of the materials typically used as targets in dark matter detectors\n(germanium, sodium iodide, argon and neon); it is based on a selected\ndescription of tritium production cross sections over the entire energy range\nof cosmic nucleons. Results have been compared to available data in the\nliterature, either based on other calculations or from measurements. The\nobtained tritium production rates, ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of\nnuclei per kg and per day at sea level, point to a significant contribution to\nthe background in dark matter experiments, requiring the application of\nspecific protocols for target material purification, material storing\nunderground and limiting the time the detector is on surface during the\nbuilding process in order to minimize the exposure to the most dangerous cosmic\nray components.\n", "  A granular system composed of frictional glass beads is simulated using the\nDiscrete Element Method. The inter-grain forces are based on the Hertz contact\nlaw in the normal direction with frictional tangential force. The damping due\nto collision is also accounted for. Systems are loaded at various stresses and\ntheir quasi-static elastic moduli are characterized. Each system is subjected\nto an extensive dynamic testing protocol by measuring the resonant response to\na broad range of AC drive amplitudes and frequencies via a set of diagnostic\nstrains. The system, linear at small AC drive amplitudes has resonance\nfrequencies that shift downward (i.e., modulus softening) with increased AC\ndrive amplitude. Detailed testing shows that the slipping contact ratio does\nnot contribute significantly to this dynamic modulus softening, but the\ncoordination number is strongly correlated to this reduction. This suggests\nthat the softening arises from the extended structural change via break and\nremake of contacts during the rearrangement of bead positions driven by the AC\namplitude.\n", "  We discuss the bi-local collective theory for the $\\mathcal{N}=1,2$\nsupersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SUSY SYK) models. We construct a bi-local\nsuperspace, and formulate the bi-local collective superfield theory of the\none-dimensional SUSY vector model. The bi-local collective theory provides\nsystematic analysis of the SUSY SYK models. We find that this bi-local\ncollective theory naturally leads to supermatrix formulation in the bi-local\nsuperspace. This supermatrix formulation drastically simplifies the analysis of\nthe SUSY SYK models. We also study $\\mathcal{N}=1$ bi-local superconformal\ngenerators in the supermatrix formulation, and find the eigenvectors of teh\nsuperconformal Casimir. We diagonalize the quadratic action in large $N$\nexpansion.\n", "  We have studied a two dimensional lattice model of Coulomb glass for a wide\nrange of disorders at $T\\sim 0$. The system was first annealed using Monte\nCarlo simulation. Further minimization of the total energy of the system was\ndone using Baranovskii et al algorithm followed by cluster flipping to obtain\nthe pseudo ground states. We have shown that the energy required to create a\ndomain of linear size L in d dimensions is proportional to $L^{d-1}$. Using\nImry-Ma arguments given for random field Ising model, one gets critical\ndimension $d_{c}\\geq 2$ for Coulomb glass. The investigations of domains in the\ntransition region shows a discontinuity in staggered magnetization which is an\nindication of a first-order type transition from charge-ordered phase to\ndisordered phase. The structure and nature of Random field fluctuations of the\nsecond largest domain in Coulomb glass are inconsistent with the assumptions of\nImry and Ma as was also reported for random field Ising model. The study of\ndomains showed that in the transition region there were mostly two large\ndomains and as disorder was increased, the two large domains remained but there\nwere a large number of small domains. We have also studied the properties of\nthe second largest domain as a function of disorder. We furthermore analysed\nthe effect of disorder on the density of states and showed a transition from\nhard gap at low disorders to a soft gap at higher disorders. At $W=2$, we have\nanalysed the soft gap in detail and found that the density of states deviates\nslightly ($\\delta\\approx 1.293 \\pm 0.027$) from the linear behaviour in two\ndimensions. Analysis of local minima show that the pseudo ground states have\nsimilar structure.\n", "  By using high pressure synthesis method, we have fabricated the potassium\ndoped para-terphenyl. The temperature dependence of magnetization measured in\nboth zero-field-cooled and field-cooled processes shows step like transitions\nat about 125 K. This confirms earlier report about the possible\nsuperconductivity like transition in the same system. However, the\nmagnetization hysteresis loop exhibits a weak ferromagnetic background. After\nremoving this ferromagnetic background, a Meissner effect like magnetic\nshielding can be found. A simple estimate on the diamagnetization of this step\ntells that the diamagnetic volume is only about 0.0427% at low temperatures, if\nwe assume the penetration depth is much smaller than the size of possible\nsuperconducting grains. This magnetization transition does not shift with\nmagnetic field but is suppressed and becomes almost invisible above 1.0 T. The\nresistivity measurements are failed because of an extremely large resistance.\nBy using the same method, we also fabricated the potassium doped\npara-quaterphenyl. A similar step like transition at about 125 K was also\nobserved by magnetization measurement. Since there is an unknown positive\nbackground and the diamagnetic volume is too small, it is insufficient to\nconclude that this step is derived from superconductivity although it looks\nlike.\n", "  Classical topological phases derived from point degeneracies in photonic\nbandstructures show intriguing and unique behaviour. Previously identified\nexceptional points are based on accidental degeneracies and subject to\nengineering on a case-by-case basis. Here we show that symmetry induced\n(deterministic) pseudo Weyl points with non-trivial topology and hyper-conic\ndispersion exist at the centre of the Brillouin zone of chiral cubic systems.\nWe establish the physical implications by means of a $P2_13$ sphere packing,\nrealised as a nano plasmonic system and a photonic crystal.\n", "  Repulsive and attractive interactions usually lead to very different physics.\nStriking exceptions exist in the dynamics of driven-dissipative quantum\nsystems. For the example of a photonic Bose-Hubbard dimer, we establish a\none-to-one mapping relating the cases of onsite repulsion and attraction. We\nprove that the mapping is valid for an entire class of Markovian open quantum\nsystems with time-reversal invariant Hamiltonian and physically meaningful\ninverse-sign Hamiltonian. To underline the broad applicability of the mapping,\nwe illustrate the one-to-one correspondence between the nonequilibrium dynamics\nin a geometrically frustrated spin lattice and that in a non-frustrated partner\nlattice.\n", "  We consider an asymptotically free, vectorial, ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric\ngauge theory with gauge group $G$ and $N_f$ pairs of chiral superfields in the\nrespective representations ${\\cal R}$ and $\\bar {\\cal R}$ of $G$, having an\ninfrared fixed point (IRFP) of the renormalization group at $\\alpha_{IR}$. We\npresent exact results for the anomalous dimensions of various (gauge-invariant)\ncomposite chiral superfields $\\gamma_{{\\Phi}_{\\rm prod}}$ at the IRFP and prove\nthat these increase monotonically with decreasing $N_f$ in the non-Abelian\nCoulomb phase of the theory and that scheme-independent expansions for these\nanomalous dimensions as powers of an $N_f$-dependent variable, $\\Delta_f$,\nexhibit monotonic and rapid convergence to the exact $\\gamma_{{\\Phi}_{\\rm\nprod}}$ throughout this phase. We also present a scheme-independent calculation\nof the derivative of the beta function, $d\\beta/d\\alpha\n|_{\\alpha=\\alpha_{IR}}$, denoted $\\beta'_{IR}$, up to $O(\\Delta_f^3)$ for\ngeneral $G$ and ${\\cal R}$, and, for the case $G={\\rm SU}(N_c)$, ${\\cal R}=F$,\nwe give an analysis of the properties of $\\beta'_{IR}$ calculated to\n$O(\\Delta_f^4)$.\n", "  We studied the connection between the structural relaxation and viscosity for\na binary model of repulsive particles in the supercooled liquid regime. The\nused approach is based on the decomposition of the macroscopic Green-Kubo\nstress correlation function into the correlation functions between the atomic\nlevel stresses. Previously we used the approach to study an iron-like single\ncomponent system of particles. The role of vibrational motion has been\naddressed through the demonstration of the relationship between viscosity and\nthe shear waves propagating over large distances. In our previous\nconsiderations, however, we did not discuss the role of the structural\nrelaxation. Here we suggest that the contribution to viscosity from the\nstructural relaxation can be taken into account through the consideration of\nthe contribution from the atomic stress auto-correlation term only. This\nconclusion, however, does not mean that only the auto-correlation term\nrepresents the contribution to viscosity from the structural relaxation.\nPreviously the role of the structural relaxation for viscosity has been\naddressed through the considerations of the transitions between inherent\nstructures and within the mode-coupling theory by other authors. In the present\nwork, we study the structural relaxation through the considerations of the\nparent liquid and the atomic level stress correlations in it. The comparison\nwith the results obtained on the inherent structures also is made. Our results\nsuggest that in the supercooled liquid regime the vibrational contribution to\nviscosity extends over the times which are much larger than the Einstein's\nvibrational period and much larger than the times which it takes for the shear\nwaves to propagate over the model systems. Besides addressing the atomic level\nshear stress correlations, we also studied correlations between the atomic\nlevel pressure elements.\n", "  We present a set of numerical experiments designed to systematically\ninvestigate how turbulence and magnetic fields influence the morphology,\nenergetics, and dynamics of filaments produced in wind-cloud interactions. We\ncover 3D magnetohydrodynamic systems of supersonic winds impacting clouds with\nturbulent density, velocity, and magnetic fields. We find that log-normal\ndensity distributions aid shock propagation through clouds, increasing their\nvelocity dispersion and producing filaments with expanded cross sections and\nhighly-magnetised knots and sub-filaments. In self-consistently turbulent\nscenarios the ratio of filament to initial cloud magnetic energy densities is\n~1. The effect of Gaussian velocity fields is bound to the turbulence Mach\nnumber: Supersonic velocities trigger a rapid cloud expansion; subsonic\nvelocities only have a minor impact. The role of turbulent magnetic fields\ndepends on their tension and is similar to the effect of radiative losses: the\nstronger the magnetic field or the softer the gas equation of state, the\ngreater the magnetic shielding at wind-filament interfaces and the suppression\nof Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Overall, we show that including turbulence\nand magnetic fields is crucial to understanding cold gas entrainment in\nmulti-phase winds. While cloud porosity and supersonic turbulence enhance the\nacceleration of clouds, magnetic shielding protects them from ablation and\ncauses Rayleigh-Taylor-driven sub-filamentation. Wind-swept clouds in turbulent\nmodels reach distances ~15-20 times their core radius and acquire bulk speeds\n~0.3-0.4 of the wind speed in one cloud-crushing time, which are three times\nlarger than in non-turbulent models. In all simulations the ratio of turbulent\nmagnetic to kinetic energy densities asymptotes at ~0.1-0.4, and convergence of\nall relevant dynamical properties requires at least 64 cells per cloud radius.\n", "  We propose an optimization procedure for Euclidean path-integrals that\nevaluate CFT wave functionals in arbitrary dimensions. The optimization is\nperformed by minimizing certain functional, which can be interpreted as a\nmeasure of computational complexity, with respect to background metrics for the\npath-integrals. In two dimensional CFTs, this functional is given by the\nLiouville action. We also formulate the optimization for higher dimensional\nCFTs and, in various examples, find that the optimized hyperbolic metrics\ncoincide with the time slices of expected gravity duals. Moreover, if we\noptimize a reduced density matrix, the geometry becomes two copies of the\nentanglement wedge and reproduces the holographic entanglement entropy. Our\napproach resembles a continuous tensor network renormalization and provides a\nconcrete realization of the proposed interpretation of AdS/CFT as tensor\nnetworks. The present paper is an extended version of our earlier report\narXiv:1703.00456 and includes many new results such as evaluations of\ncomplexity functionals, energy stress tensor, higher dimensional extensions and\ntime evolutions of thermofield double states.\n", "  We use the ab initio Bethe Ansatz dynamics to predict the dissociation of\none-dimensional cold-atom breathers that are created by a quench from a\nfundamental soliton. We find that the dissociation is a robust quantum\nmany-body effect, while in the mean-field (MF) limit the dissociation is\nforbidden by the integrability of the underlying nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. The analysis demonstrates the possibility to observe quantum\nmany-body effects without leaving the MF range of experimental parameters. We\nfind that the dissociation time is of the order of a few seconds for a typical\natomic-soliton setting.\n", "  Interactions between people are the basis on which the structure of our\nsociety arises as a complex system and, at the same time, are the starting\npoint of any physical description of it. In the last few years, much\ntheoretical research has addressed this issue by combining the physics of\ncomplex networks with a description of interactions in terms of evolutionary\ngame theory. We here take this research a step further by introducing a most\nsalient societal factor such as the individuals' preferences, a characteristic\nthat is key to understand much of the social phenomenology these days. We\nconsider a heterogeneous, agent-based model in which agents interact\nstrategically with their neighbors but their preferences and payoffs for the\npossible actions differ. We study how such a heterogeneous network behaves\nunder evolutionary dynamics and different strategic interactions, namely\ncoordination games and best shot games. With this model we study the emergence\nof the equilibria predicted analytically in random graphs under best response\ndynamics, and we extend this test to unexplored contexts like proportional\nimitation and scale free networks. We show that some theoretically predicted\nequilibria do not arise in simulations with incomplete Information, and we\ndemonstrate the importance of the graph topology and the payoff function\nparameters for some games. Finally, we discuss our results with available\nexperimental evidence on coordination games, showing that our model agrees\nbetter with the experiment that standard economic theories, and draw hints as\nto how to maximize social efficiency in situations of conflicting preferences.\n", "  This study employs an improved volume of fluid method and adaptive mesh\nrefinement algorithm to numerically investigate the internal jet-like mixing\nupon the coalescence of two initially stationary droplets of unequal sizes. The\nemergence of the internal jet is attributed to the formation of a main vortex\nring, as the jet-like structure shows a strong correlation with the main vortex\nring inside the merged droplet. By tracking the evolution of the main vortex\nring together with its circulation, we identified two mechanisms that are\nessential to the internal-jet formation: the vortex-ring growth and the\nvortex-ring detachment. Recognizing that the manifestation of the\nvortex-ring-induced jet physically relies on the competition between the\nconvection and viscous dissipation of the vortex ring, we further developed and\nsubstantiated a vortex-ring-based Reynolds number criterion to interpret the\noccurrence of the internal jet at various Ohnesorge numbers and size ratios.\nFor the merged droplet with apparent jet formation, the average mixing rate\nafter jet formation increases monotonically with the vortex-ring Reynolds\nnumber, which therefore serves as an approximate measure of the jet strength.\nIn this respect, stronger internal jet is responsible for enhanced mixing of\nthe merged droplet.\n", "  We derive the stochastic description of a massless, interacting scalar field\nin de Sitter space directly from the quantum theory. This is done by showing\nthat the density matrix for the effective theory of the long wavelength\nfluctuations of the field obeys a quantum version of the Fokker-Planck\nequation. This equation has a simple connection with the standard Fokker-Planck\nequation of the classical stochastic theory, which can be generalised to any\norder in perturbation theory. We illustrate this formalism in detail for the\ntheory of a massless scalar field with a quartic interaction.\n", "  Motivated by additional experimental hints of Lepton Flavour Universality\nviolation in B decays, both in charged- and in neutral-current processes, we\nanalyse the ingredients necessary to provide a combined description of these\nphenomena. By means of an Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, based on the\nhypothesis of New Physics coupled predominantly to the third generation of\nleft-handed quarks and leptons, we show how this is possible. We demonstrate,\nin particular, how to solve the problems posed by electroweak precision tests\nand direct searches with a rather natural choice of model parameters, within\nthe context of a $U(2)_q \\times U(2)_\\ell$ flavour symmetry. We further\nexemplify the general EFT findings by means of simplified models with explicit\nmediators in the TeV range: coloured scalar or vector leptoquarks and\ncolour-less vectors. Among these, the case of an $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector\nleptoquark emerges as a particularly simple and successful framework.\n", "  We present the properties of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of CaF molecules.\nWe study the process of loading the MOT from a decelerated buffer-gas-cooled\nbeam, and how best to slow this molecular beam in order to capture the most\nmolecules. We determine how the number of molecules, the photon scattering\nrate, the oscillation frequency, damping constant, temperature, cloud size and\nlifetime depend on the key parameters of the MOT, especially the intensity and\ndetuning of the main cooling laser. We compare our results to analytical and\nnumerical models, to the properties of standard atomic MOTs, and to MOTs of SrF\nmolecules. We load up to $2 \\times 10^4$ molecules, and measure a maximum\nscattering rate of $2.5 \\times 10^6$ s$^{-1}$ per molecule, a maximum\noscillation frequency of 100 Hz, a maximum damping constant of 500 s$^{-1}$,\nand a minimum MOT rms radius of 1.5 mm. A minimum temperature of 730 $\\mu$K is\nobtained by ramping down the laser intensity to low values. The lifetime,\ntypically about 100 ms, is consistent with a leak out of the cooling cycle with\na branching ratio of about $6 \\times 10^{-6}$. The MOT has a capture velocity\nof about 11 m/s.\n", "  A one-dimensional quantum system with off diagonal disorder, consisting of a\nsample of conducting regions randomly interspersed within potential barriers is\nconsidered. Results mainly concerning the large $N$ limit are presented. In\nparticular, the effect of compression on the transmission coefficient is\ninvestigated. A numerical method to simulate such a system, for a physically\nrelevant number of barriers, is proposed. It is shown that the disordered model\nconverges to the periodic case as $N$ increases, with a rate of convergence\nwhich depends on the disorder degree. Compression always leads to a decrease of\nthe transmission coefficient which may be exploited to design\nnano-technological sensors. Effective choices for the physical parameters to\nimprove the sensitivity are provided. Eventually large fluctuations and rate\nfunctions are analysed.\n", "  We study the production of a photon pair in association with two bottom jets\nat the LHC. This process constitutes an important background to double Higgs\nproduction with the subsequent decay of the two Higgs bosons into a pair of\nphotons and b-quarks respectively. We calculate this process at next-to-leading\norder accuracy in QCD and find that QCD corrections lead to a substantial\nincrease of the production cross section due to new channels opening up at\nnext-to-leading order and their inclusion is therefore inevitable for a\nreliable prediction. Furthermore, the approximation of massless b-quarks is\nscrutinized by calculating the process with both massless and massive b-quarks.\nWe find that the massive bottom quark leads to a substantial reduction of the\ncross section where the biggest effect is however due to the use of a four\nflavor PDF set and the corresponding smaller values for the strong coupling\nconstant.\n", "  Stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are complex systems which\ncombine the features of concurrent transformation of multiple variables in each\nelementary reaction event, and nonlinear relations between states and their\nrates of change. Most general results concerning CRNs are limited to restricted\ncases where a topological characteristic known as deficiency takes value 0 or\n1. Here we derive equations of motion for fluctuation moments at all orders for\nstochastic CRNs at general deficiency. We show, for the case of the mass-action\nrate law, that the generator of the stochastic process acts on the hierarchy of\nfactorial moments with a finite representation. Whereas simulation of\nhigh-order moments for many-particle systems is costly, this representation\nreduces solution of moment hierarchies to a complexity comparable to solving a\nheat equation. At steady states, moment hierarchies for finite CRNs interpolate\nbetween low-order and high-order scaling regimes, which may be approximated\nseparately by distributions similar to those for deficiency-0 networks, and\nconnected through matched asymptotic expansions. In CRNs with multiple stable\nor metastable steady states, boundedness of high-order moments provides the\nstarting condition for recursive solution downward to low-order moments,\nreversing the order usually used to solve moment hierarchies. A basis for a\nsubset of network flows defined by having the same mean-regressing property as\nthe flows in deficiency-0 networks gives the leading contribution to low-order\nmoments in CRNs at general deficiency, in a $1/n$-expansion in large particle\nnumbers. Our results give a physical picture of the different informational\nroles of mean-regressing and non-mean-regressing flows, and clarify the\ndynamical meaning of deficiency not only for first-moment conditions but for\nall orders in fluctuations.\n", "  We introduce a set of identities in the cohomology ring of elliptic\nfibrations which are equivalent to the cancellation of gauge and mixed\ngauge-gravitational anomalies in F-theory compactifications to four and six\ndimensions. The identities consist in (co)homological relations between complex\ncodimension-two cycles. The same set of relations, once evaluated on elliptic\nCalabi-Yau three-folds and four-folds, is shown to universally govern the\nstructure of anomalies and their Green-Schwarz cancellation in six- and\nfour-dimensional F-theory vacua, respectively. We furthermore conjecture that\nthese relations hold not only within the cohomology ring, but even at the level\nof the Chow ring, i.e. as relations among codimension-two cycles modulo\nrational equivalence. We verify this conjecture in non-trivial examples with\nAbelian and non-Abelian gauge groups factors. Apart from governing the\nstructure of local anomalies, the identities in the Chow ring relate different\ntypes of gauge backgrounds on elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau four-folds.\n", "  We show that the CKM matrix can be the source of CP violation for electroweak\nbaryogenesis if Yukawa couplings vary at the same time as the Higgs acquires\nits vacuum expectation value. This offers new avenues for explaining the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe. These ideas apply if the mechanism explaining the\nflavour structure of the Standard Model is connected to electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. We compute the resulting baryon asymmetry for various low-scale\nflavour models and different configurations of the Yukawa coupling variation\nacross the bubble wall, and show that it can naturally be of the right order.\n", "  Neutral hydrogen (HI) will soon be the dark matter tracer observed over the\nlargest volumes of Universe thanks to the 21 cm intensity mapping technique. To\nunveil cosmological information it is indispensable to understand the HI\ndistribution with respect to dark matter. Using a full one-loop derivation of\nthe power spectrum of HI, we show that higher order corrections change the\namplitude and shape of the power spectrum on typical cosmological (linear)\nscales. These effects go beyond the expected dark matter non-linear corrections\nand include non-linearities in the way the HI signal traces dark matter. We\nshow that, on linear scales at z = 1, the HI bias drops by up to 15% in both\nreal and redshift space, which results in underpredicting the mass of the halos\nin which HI lies. Non-linear corrections give rise to a significant scale\ndependence when redshift space distortions arise, in particular on the scale\nrange of the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). There is a factor of 5\ndifference between the linear and full HI power spectra over the full BAO scale\nrange, which will modify the ratios between the peaks. This effect will also be\nseen in other types of survey and it will be essential to take it into account\nin future experiments in order to match the expectations of precision\ncosmology.\n", "  For certain correlated electron-photon systems we construct the exact\ndensity-to-potential maps, which are the basic ingredients of a\ndensity-functional reformulation of coupled matter-photon problems. We do so\nfor numerically exactly solvable models consisting of up to four fermionic\nsites coupled to a single photon mode. We show that the recently introduced\nconcept of the intra-system steepening (T.Dimitrov et al., 18, 083004 NJP\n(2016)) can be generalized to coupled fermion-boson systems and that the\nintra-system steepening indicates strong exchange-correlation (xc) effects due\nto the coupling between electrons and photons. The reliability of the\nmean-field approximation to the electron-photon interaction is investigated and\nits failure in the strong coupling regime analyzed. We highlight how the\nintra-system steepening of the exact density-to-potential maps becomes apparent\nalso in observables such as the photon number or the polarizability of the\nelectronic subsystem. We finally show that a change in functional variables can\nmake these observables behave more smoothly and exemplify that the\ndensity-to-potential maps can give us physical insights into the behavior of\ncoupled electron-photon systems by identifying a very large polarizability due\nto ultra-strong electron-photon coupling.\n", "  We calculate the next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the\nproduction of a photon pair in association with zero, one and two jets at the\nLHC. We use GoSam and Sherpa to obtain the results in a fully automated way.\nFor a typical set of fiducial cuts the electroweak corrections lead to a\nmodification of the total cross section of up to 3 per cent, depending on the\njet multiplicity. We find substantial contributions in differential\ndistributions, leading to tens of per cent corrections for phase space regions\nwithin the reach of the LHC. Furthermore we investigate the importance of\nphoton induced processes as well as subleading contributions. Photon induced\nprocesses are found to be negligible, subleading contributions can have a\nsizeable impact however they can be removed by appropriate phase space cuts.\n", "  We apply the master equation with dynamical coarse graining approximation to\na pair of detectors interacting with a scalar field. By solving the master\nequation numerically, we investigate evolution of negativity between comoving\ndetectors in de Sitter space. For the massless conformal scalar field, it is\nfound that a pair of detectors can perceive entanglement beyond the Hubble\nhorizon scale if the initial separation of detectors is sufficiently small. At\nthe same time, violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality on the super horizon scale\nis also detected. For the massless minimal scalar field, on the other hand, the\nentanglement decays within Hubble time scale owing to the quantum noise caused\nby particle creations in de Sitter space and the entanglement on the super\nhorizon scale cannot be detected.\n", "  The present high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering experiment on ice\nXVII, containing molecular hydrogen with different ortho/para ratio, allows to\nassign the H$_2$ motion spectral bands to rotational and center-of-mass\ntranslational transitions of either {\\it para}- or {\\it ortho}-H$_2$. Due to\nits structure, ice XVII confines H$_2$ molecules to move in spiral channels of\nmolecular size. Reported data demonstrate that H$_2$ molecules rotate almost\nfreely in these nanometric channels, though showing larger perturbation than in\nclathrate hydrates, and perform a translational motion exhibiting two low\nfrequency excitations. The good agreement between experimental spectra and\ncorresponding molecular dynamics results clearly enables to portray a picture\nof the confined motions of a hydrophobic guest within a metastable ice\nframework, i.e. ice XVII.\n", "  We discuss the physics case for and the concept of a medium-scale axion\nhelioscope with sensitivities in the axion-photon coupling a few times better\nthan CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST). Search for an axion-like particle with\nthese couplings is motivated by several persistent astrophysical anomalies. We\npresent early conceptual design, existing infrastructure, projected sensitivity\nand timeline of such a helioscope (Troitsk Axion Solar Telescope Experiment,\nTASTE) to be constructed in the Institute for Nuclear Research, Troitsk,\nRussia. The proposed instrument may be also used for the search of dark-matter\nhalo axions.\n", "  We study theoretically and experimentally the behaviour of a strongly\nconfined dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, in the regime of quantum-mechanical\nstabilization by beyond-mean-field effects. Theoretically, we demonstrate that\nself-organized striped ground states are predicted in the framework of the\nextended Gross-Pitaevskii theory. Experimentally, by tilting the magnetic\ndipoles we show that self-organized striped states can be generated, likely in\ntheir metastable state. Matter-wave interference experiments with multiple\nstripes show that there is no long-range off-diagonal order (global phase\ncoherence). We outline a parameter range where global phase coherence could be\nestablished, thus paving the way towards the observation of supersolid states\nin this system.\n", "  The Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) has\nproduced a large volume of high-quality lunar laser ranging (LLR) data since it\nbegan operating in 2006. For most of this period, APOLLO has relied on a\nGPS-disciplined, high-stability quartz oscillator as its frequency and time\nstandard. The recent addition of a cesium clock as part of a timing calibration\nsystem initiated a comparison campaign between the two clocks. This has allowed\ncorrection of APOLLO range measurements--called normal points--during the\noverlap period, but also revealed a mechanism to correct for systematic range\noffsets due to clock errors in historical APOLLO data. Drift of the GPS clock\non ~1000 s timescales contributed typically 2.5 mm of range error to APOLLO\nmeasurements, and we find that this may be reduced to ~1.6 mm on average. We\npresent here a characterization of APOLLO clock errors, the method by which we\ncorrect historical data, and the resulting statistics.\n", "  Lunar laser ranging provides a number of leading experimental tests of\ngravitation -- important in our quest to unify General Relativity and the\nStandard Model of physics. The Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging\nOperation (APOLLO) has for years achieved median range precision at the ~2 mm\nlevel. Yet residuals in model-measurement comparisons are an order-of-magnitude\nlarger, raising the question of whether the ranging data are not nearly as\naccurate as they are precise, or if the models are incomplete or\nill-conditioned. This paper describes a new absolute calibration system (ACS)\nintended both as a tool for exposing and eliminating sources of systematic\nerror, and also as a means to directly calibrate ranging data in-situ. The\nsystem consists of a high-repetition-rate (80 MHz) laser emitting short (< 10\nps) pulses that are locked to a cesium clock. In essence, the ACS delivers\nphotons to the APOLLO detector at exquisitely well-defined time intervals as a\n\"truth\" input against which APOLLO's timing performance may be judged and\ncorrected. Preliminary analysis indicates no inaccuracies in APOLLO data beyond\nthe ~3 mm level, suggesting that historical APOLLO data are of high quality and\nmotivating continued work on model capabilities. The ACS provides the means to\ndeliver APOLLO data both accurate and precise below the 2 mm level.\n", "  The discharge of polydisperse grains in a two-dimensional silo, operating in\na continuous-discharge mode, is studied with the help of soft-particle discrete\nelement simulations. We find that the mass flow rate displays similar variation\nwith vertical normal stress at the base and the transition-point in the bulk,\nsignifying that the base normal stress can be considered as a representative of\nits bulk counterpart. The variation of the base and transition-point normal\nstresses with fill height follows the Janssen's model, with the former being\nlarger than the latter. The transition-point ($y_t$) is defined as the vertical\nextent of Region of Orifice Influence (ROOI), which is situated directly above\nthe orifice in its neighbourhood. The transition-point occurs largely at the\nsame location irrespective of the fill height. It shifts, however, upon\nchanging the orifice size, indicating its occurrence to be a localized\nphenomenon. Finally, the scaling of the vertical velocities at the\ntransition-point and outlet uncovers $y_t$ to be a more relevant length scale\nthan the orifice size $D$. This scaling provides a new insight into the\ndynamics of the silo discharge in the case where the flow rate varies but the\nnormal stress stays largely invariant to change in the orifice size.\n", "  An operational approach to the study of computation based on correlations\nconsiders black-boxes with one-bit inputs and outputs, controlled by a limited\nclassical computer capable only of performing sums modulo-2. In this setting,\nit was shown that non-contextual correlations do not provide any extra\ncomputational power, while contextual correlations were found to be necessary\nfor the deterministic evaluation of non-linear Boolean functions. Here we\ninvestigate the requirements for reliable computation in this setting, that is,\nthe evaluation of any Boolean function with success probability bounded away\nfrom 1/2. We show that bipartite CHSH quantum correlations suffice for reliable\ncomputation. We also prove that an arbitrarily small violation of a\nmultipartite GHZ non-contextuality inequality also suffices for reliable\ncomputation.\n", "  We calculate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the Z3-invariant\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model where the interactions of the\nsinglino provide the necessary source of charge and parity violation. Using the\nclosed time path formalism, we derive and solve transport equations for the\ncases where the singlet acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) before and\nduring the electroweak phase transition. We perform a detailed scan to show how\nthe baryon asymmetry varies throughout the relevant parameter space. Our\nresults show that the case where the singlet acquires a VEV during the\nelectroweak phase transition typically generates a larger baryon asymmetry,\nalthough we expect that the case where the singlet acquires a VEV first is far\nmore common for any model in which parameters unify at a high scale. Finally,\nwe examine the dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the three-body\ninteractions involving gauge singlets.\n", "  We present multi-epoch, multi-colour pre-outburst photometry and\npost-outburst light curves and spectra of the luminous blue variable (LBV)\noutburst Gaia16cfr discovered by the Gaia satellite on 1 December 2016. We\ndetect Gaia16cfr in 13 epochs of Hubble Space Telescope imaging spanning phases\nof 10 yr to 8 months before the outburst and in Spitzer Space Telescope imaging\n13 years before outburst. Pre-outburst optical photometry is consistent with an\n18 Msun F8 I star, although the star was likely reddened and closer to 30 Msun.\nThe pre-outburst source exhibited a significant near-infrared excess consistent\nwith a 120 AU shell with 4x10-6 Msun of dust. We infer that the source was\nenshrouded by an optically-thick and compact shell of circumstellar material\nfrom an LBV wind, which formed a pseudo-photosphere consistent with S Dor-like\nvariables in their \"maximum\" phase. Within a year of outburst, the source was\nhighly variable on 10-30 day timescales. The outburst light curve closely\nmatches that of the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip, although the observed\nvelocities are significantly slower than in that event. In Halpha, the outburst\nhad an excess of blueshifted emission at late times centred around -1500 km/s,\nsimilar to that of double-peaked Type IIn supernovae and the LBV outburst SN\n2015bh. From the pre-outburst and post-outburst photometry, we infer that the\noutburst ejecta are evolving into a dense, highly structured circumstellar\nenvironment from precursor outbursts within years of the December 2016 event.\n", "  We propose a new approximation framework that unifies and generalizes a\nnumber of existing mean-field approximation methods for the SIS epidemic model\non complex networks. We derive the framework, which we call the Universal\nMean-Field Framework (UMFF), as a set of approximations of the exact Markovian\nSIS equations. Our main novelty is that we describe the mean-field\napproximations from the perspective of the isoperimetric problem, an insight\nwhich results in bounds on the UMFF approximation error. These new bounds\nprovide insight in the accuracy of existing mean-field methods, such as the\nwidely-used N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA) and Heterogeneous\nMean-Field method (HMF). Additionally, the geometric perspective of the\nisoperimetric problem enables the UMFF approximation accuracy to be related to\nthe regularity notions of Szemer\\'edi's regularity lemma, which yields a\nprediction about the behavior of the SIS process on large graphs.\n", "  A self-consistent nonlinear hydrodynamic theory is presented of the\npropagation of a long and thin relativistic electron beam, for a typical plasma\nwake field acceleration configuration in an unmagnetized and overdense plasma.\nThe random component of the trajectories of the beam particles as well as of\ntheir velocity spread is modelled by an anisotropic temperature, allowing the\nbeam dynamics to be approximated as a 3-D adiabatic expansion/compression. {It\nis shown that even in the absence of the {nonlinear plasma wake force}, the\nlocalization of the beam in the transverse direction can be achieved owing to\nthe} nonlinearity associated with the adiabatic compression/rarefaction and a\ncoherent stationary state is constructed. Numerical calculations reveal the\npossibility of the beam focussing and defocussing, but the lifetime of the beam\ncan be significantly extended by the appropriate adjustments, so that\ntransverse oscillations are observed, {similar to those} predicted within the\nthermal wave and Vlasov kinetic models.\n", "  Recent progress in resource theory of quantum coherence has resulted in\nmeasures to quantify coherence in quantum systems. Especially, the l1-norm and\nrelative entropy of coherence have been shown to be proper quantifiers of\ncoherence and have been used to investigate coherence properties in different\noperational tasks. Since long-lasting quantum coherence has been experimentally\nconfirmed in a number of photosynthetic complexes, it has been debated if and\nhow coherence is connected to the known efficiency of population transfer in\nsuch systems. In this study, we investigate quantitatively the relationship\nbetween coherence, as quantified by l1-norm and relative entropy of coherence,\nand efficiency, as quantified by fidelity, for population transfer between\nend-sites in a network of two-level quantum systems. In particular, we use the\ncoherence averaged over the duration of the population transfer in order to\ncarry out a quantitative comparision between coherence and fidelity. Our\nresults show that although coherence is a necessary requirement for population\ntransfer, there is no unique relation between coherence and the efficiency of\nthe transfer process.\n", "  In this paper, we propose an extension of quantum searches on graphs driven\nby quantum walks to simplicial complexes. To this end, we newly define a\nquantum walk on simplicial complex which is an alternative of preceding studies\nby authors. We show that the quantum search on the specific simplicial complex\ncorresponding to the triangulation of $n$-dimensional unit square driven by\nthis new simplicial quantum walk works well, namely, a marked simplex can be\nfound with probability $1+o(1)$ with in a time $O(\\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of simplices with the dimension of marked simplex.\n", "  We present a new method of deriving the off-shell spectrum of supergravity\nand massless $4D,~\\mathcal{N}=1$ higher spin multiplets without the need of an\naction and based on a set of natural requirements: (a.) existence of an\nunderlying superspace description, (b.) an economical description of free,\nmassless, higher spins and (c.) equal numbers of bosonic and fermionic degrees\nof freedom. We prove that for any theory that respects the above, the fermionic\nauxiliary components come in pairs and are gauge invariant and there are two\ntypes of bosonic auxiliary components. Type (1) are pairs of a $(2,0)$-tensor\nwith real or imaginary $(1,1)$-tensor with non-trivial gauge transformations.\nType (2) are singlets and gauge invariant. The outcome is a set of Diophantine\nequations, the solutions of which determine the off-shell spectrum of\nsupergravity and massless higher spin multiplets. This approach provides (i) a\nclassification of the irreducible, supersymmetric, representations of arbitrary\nspin and (ii) a very clean and intuitive explanation to why some of these\ntheories have more than one formulations (e.g. the supergravity multiplet) and\nothers do not.\n", "  The combination of line and continuum observations can provide vital insights\nto the formation and fragmentation of filaments and the initial conditions for\nstar formation.

The filament was first\nThe combination of line and continuum observations can provide vital insights\nto the formation and fragmentation of filaments and the initial conditions for\nstar formation. We have carried out line observations to map the kinematics of\nan evolved, actively star forming filament G82.65-2.00. The filament was first\nidentified from the Planck data as a region of particularly cold dust emission\nand was mapped at 100-500 $\\mu$m as a part of Herschel key program Galactic\nCold Cores.\n  The observations reveal several velocity components in the field, with\nstrongest line emission concentrated to velocity range $\\sim [3,5]$ km $\\rm\ns^{-1}$. The column density of molecular hydrogen along the filament varies\nfrom 1.0 to 2.3 $\\times 10^{22}$ $\\rm cm^{2}$. We have examined six cold clumps\nfrom the central part of the filament. The clumps have masses in the range $10\n- 20$ $M_{\\odot}$ ($\\sim70M_{\\odot}$ in total) and are close to or above the\nvirial mass. Furthermore, the main filament is heavily fragmented and most of\nthe the substructures have a mass lower than or close to the virial mass,\nsuggesting that the filament is dispersing as a whole. Position-velocity maps\nof $\\rm ^{12}CO$ and $\\rm ^{13}CO$ lines indicate that at least one of the\nstriations is kinematically connected to two of the clumps, potentially\nindicating mass accretion from the striation onto the main filament. We\ntentatively estimate the accretion rate to be $\\dot{M}$ = $2.23 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$ M_{\\odot} / \\rm year$.\n", "  The isovector bottomoniumlike exotic resonances $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$\nare very close to the thresholds of heavy meson pairs $B \\bar B^* \\, ( \\bar B\nB^*)$ and $B^* \\bar B^*$, and are naturally understood as `molecular' states\nmade of the corresponding meson-antimeson pairs. The picture with a full\nseparation of the two channels cannot be exact and a cross-feed between the\nstates necessarily takes place. A simple model is considered here describing\nthe mixing between the channels in terms of one parameter. The model reasonably\ndescribes the current data on the decays of the $Z_b$ resonances to bottomonium\nplus a pion and predicts the rate and a distinctive interference pattern for\nthe decay $Z_b(10650) \\to B \\bar B^* \\, ( \\bar B B^*)$ as well as excess of the\nmass splitting between the resonances over the mass difference between $B^*$\nand $B$ mesons.\n", "  We propose a new model of the D-term hybrid inflation in the framework of\nsupergravity. Although our model introduces, analogously to the conventional\nD-term inflation, the inflaton and a pair of scalar fields charged under a\n$U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we study the logarithmic and exponential dependence on\nthe inflaton field, respectively, for the K\\\"ahler and superpotential. This\nresults in a characteristic one-loop scalar potential consisting of linear and\nexponential terms, which realizes the small-field inflation dominated by the\nFayet-Iliopoulos term. With the reasonable values for the coupling coefficients\nand, in particular, with the $U(1)$ gauge coupling constant comparable to that\nof the Standard Model, our D-term inflation model can solve the notorious\nproblems in the conventional D-term inflation, namely, the CMB constraints on\nthe spectral index and the generation of cosmic strings.\n", "  The field space entanglement entropy of a quantum field theory is obtained by\nintegrating out a subset of its fields. We study an interacting quantum field\ntheory consisting of massless scalar fields on a closed compact manifold M. To\nthis model we associate its Lifshitz dual model. The ground states of both\nmodels are invariant under constant shifts. We interpret this invariance as\ngauge symmetry and subject the models to proper gauge fixing. By applying the\nheat kernel regularization one can show that the field space entanglement\nentropies of the massless scalar field model and of its Lifshitz dual are\nagreeing.\n", "  Networks are versatile representations of the interactions between entities\nin complex systems. Cycles on such networks represent feedback processes which\nplay a central role in system dynamics. In this work, we introduce a measure of\nthe importance of any individual cycle, as the fraction of the total\ninformation flow of the network passing through the cycle. This measure is\ncomputationally cheap, numerically well-conditioned, induces a centrality\nmeasure on arbitrary subgraphs and reduces to the eigenvector centrality on\nvertices. We demonstrate that this measure accurately reflects the impact of\nevents on strategic ensembles of economic sectors, notably in the US economy.\nAs a second example, we show that in the protein-interaction network of the\nplant Arabidopsis thaliana, a model based on cycle-centrality better accounts\nfor pathogen activity than the state-of-art one. This translates into\npathogen-targeted-proteins being concentrated in a small number of triads with\nhigh cycle-centrality. Algorithms for computing the centrality of cycles and\nsubgraphs are available for download.\n", "  Two 3-fold flops are exhibited, both of which have precisely one flopping\ncurve. One of the two flops is new, and is distinct from all known algebraic\nD4-flops. It is shown that the two flops are neither algebraically nor\nanalytically isomorphic, yet their curve-counting Gopakumar-Vafa invariants are\nthe same. We further show that the contraction algebras associated to both are\nnot isomorphic, so the flops are distinguished at this level. This shows that\nthe contraction algebra is a finer invariant than various curve-counting\ntheories, and it also provides more evidence for the proposed analytic\nclassification of 3-fold flops via contraction algebras.\n", "  We have explored a new mechanism for switching magnetism and\nsuperconductivity in a magnetically frustrated iron-based superconductor using\nspin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SPSTM). Our SPSTM study on single\ncrystal Sr$_2$VO$_3$FeAs shows that a spin-polarized tunneling current can\nswitch the Fe-layer magnetism into a non-trivial $C_4$ (2$\\times$2) order, not\nachievable by thermal excitation with unpolarized current. Our tunneling\nspectroscopy study shows that the induced $C_4$ (2$\\times$2) order has\ncharacteristics of plaquette antiferromagnetic order in Fe layer and strongly\nsuppressed superconductivity. Also, thermal agitation beyond the bulk Fe spin\nordering temperature erases the $C_4$ state. These results suggest a new\npossibility of switching local superconductivity by changing the symmetry of\nmagnetic order with spin-polarized and unpolarized tunneling currents in\niron-based superconductors.\n", "  We present an analysis of microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0693, based on the\nsurvey-only microlensing observations by the OGLE and KMTNet groups. In order\nto analyze the light curve, we consider the effects of parallax, orbital\nmotion, and baseline slope, and also refine the result using a Galactic model\nprior. From the microlensing analysis, we find that the event is a binary\ncomposed of a low-mass brown dwarf 49+-20 M_J companion and a K- or G-dwarf\nhost, which lies at a distance 5.0+-0.6 kpc toward the Galactic bulge. The\nprojected separation between the brown dwarf and its host star is less than 5\nAU, and thus it is likely that the brown dwarf companion is located in the\nbrown dwarf desert.\n", "  Theoretical investigations of the pentaquark states which were recently\ndiscovered provide important information on their nature and structure. It is\nnecessary to study the spectroscopic parameters like masses and residues of\nparticles belong to the class of pentaquarks and ones having similar\nstructures. The mass and pole residue are quantities which emerge as the main\ninput parameters in exploration of the electromagnetic, strong and weak\ninteractions of the pentaquarks with other hadrons in many frameworks. This\nwork deals with a QCD sum rule analysis of the spin-$3/2$ and spin-$5/2$ bottom\npentaquarks with both positive and negative parities aiming to evaluate their\nmasses and residues. In calculations, the pentaquark states are modeled by\nmolecular-type interpolating currents: for particles with $J=5/2$ a mixing\ncurrent is used. We compare the results obtained in this work with the existing\npredictions of other theoretical studies. The predictions on the masses may\nshed light on experimental searches of the bottom pentaquarks.\n", "  We present a detailed description of the wavelength, astrometric and\nphotometric calibration plan for SITELLE, the imaging Fourier transform\nspectrometer attached to the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, based on\nobservations of a red (647 - 685 nm) data cube of the central region (11$'\n\\times 11'$) of the Andromeda galaxy. The first application, presented in this\npaper, is a radial-velocity catalogue (with uncertainties of $\\sim 2 - 6$ km/s)\nof nearly 800 emission-line point-like sources, including $\\sim$ 450 new\ndiscoveries. Most of the sources are likely planetary nebulae, although we also\ndetect five novae (having erupted in the first 8 months of 2016) and one new\nsupernova remnant candidate.\n", "  We analyse, in NLO, the physical properties of the discrete eigenvalue\nsolution for the BFKL equation. We show that a set of eigenfunctions with\npositive eigenvalues, \\omega, together with a small contribution from a\ncontinuum of eigenfunctions with negative \\omega, provide an excellent\ndescription of high-precision HERA F_2 data in the region, x<0.001, Q^2 > 6\nGeV^2. The phases of the eigenfunctions can be obtained from a simple\nparametrisation of the pomeron spectrum, which has a natural motivation within\nBFKL. The data analysis shows that the first eigenfunction decouples completely\nor almost completely from the proton. This suggests that there exist an\nadditional ground state, which is naturally saturated and may have the\nproperties of the soft pomeron.\n", "  In the context of the interaction between the electromagnetic field and a\ndielectric dispersive lossless medium, we present a non-linear version of the\nrelativistically covariant Hopfield model, which is suitable for the\ndescription of a dielectric Kerr perturbation propagating in a dielectric\nmedium. The non-linearity is introduced in the Lagrangian through a\nself-interacting term proportional to the fourth power of the polarization\nfield. We find an exact solution for the nonlinear equations describing a\npropagating perturbation in the dielectric medium. Furthermore the presence of\nan analogue Hawking effect, as well as the thermal properties of the model, are\ndiscussed, confirming and improving the results achieved in the scalar case.\n", "  We systematically study the $S$-wave doubly charmed baryons using the method\nof QCD sum rules. Our results suggest that the $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ recently\nobserved by LHCb can be well identified as the $S$-wave $\\Xi_{cc}$ state of\n$J^P = 1/2^+$. We study its relevant $\\Omega_{cc}$ state, whose mass is\npredicted to be around 3.7 GeV. We also systematically study the $P$-wave\ndoubly charmed baryons, whose masses are predicted to be around 4.1 GeV.\nEspecially, there can be several excited doubly charmed baryons in this energy\nregion, and we suggest to search for them in order to study the fine structure\nof the strong interaction.\n", "  The massless Klein--Gordon equation on arbitrary curved backgrounds allows\nfor solutions which develop \"tails\" inside the light cone and, therefore, do\nnot strictly follow null geodesics as discovered by DeWitt and Brehme almost\nsixty years ago. A modification of the massless Klein--Gordon equation is\npresented which always exhibits null geodesic propagation of waves on arbitrary\ncurved spacetimes. This new equation is derived from a Lagrangian which\nexhibits current--current interaction. Its non--linearity is due to a\nself--coupling term which is related to the quantum mechanical Bohm potential.\n", "  The X-ray emission of the O+O binary HD166734 was monitored using Swift and\nXMM-Newton observatories, leading to the discovery of phase-locked variations.\nThe presence of an f line in the He-like triplets further supports a wind-wind\ncollision as the main source of the X-rays in HD166734. While temperature and\nabsorption do not vary significantly along the orbit, the X-ray emission\nstrength varies by one order of magnitude, with a long minimum state\n(Delta(phi)~0.1) occurring after a steep decrease. The flux at minimum is\ncompatible with the intrinsic emission of the O-stars in the system, suggesting\na possible disappearance of colliding wind emission. While this minimum cannot\nbe explained by eclipse or occultation effects, a shock collapse may occur at\nperiastron in view of the wind properties. Afterwards, the recovery is long,\nwith an X-ray flux proportional to the separation d (in hard band) or to d^2\n(in soft band). This is incompatible with an adiabatic nature for the collision\n(which would instead lead to \"F_X propto 1/d\"), but could be reconciled with a\nradiative character of the collision, though predicted temperatures are lower\nand more variable than in observations. An increase in flux around phi~0.65 and\nthe global asymmetry of the light curve remain unexplained, however.\n", "  We introduce the extended Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits magic square based on\nsix algebras: the reals $\\mathbb{R}$, complexes $\\mathbb{C}$, ternions\n$\\mathbb{T}$, quaternions $\\mathbb{H}$, sextonions $\\mathbb{S}$ and octonions\n$\\mathbb{O}$. The ternionic and sextonionic rows/columns of the magic square\nyield non-reductive Lie algebras, including\n$\\mathfrak{e}_{7\\scriptscriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}$. It is demonstrated that the\nalgebras of the extended magic square appear quite naturally as the symmetries\nof supergravity Lagrangians. The sextonionic row (for appropriate choices of\nreal forms) gives the non-compact global symmetries of the Lagrangian for the\n$D=3$ maximal $\\mathcal{N}=16$, magic $\\mathcal{N}=4$ and magic\nnon-supersymmetric theories, obtained by dimensionally reducing the $D=4$\nparent theories on a circle, with the graviphoton left undualised. In\nparticular, the extremal intermediate non-reductive Lie algebra\n$\\tilde{\\mathfrak{e}}_{7(7)\\scriptscriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ (which is not a\nsubalgebra of $\\mathfrak{e}_{8(8)}$) is the non-compact global symmetry algebra\nof $D=3$, $\\mathcal{N}=16$ supergravity as obtained by dimensionally reducing\n$D=4$, $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity with $\\mathfrak{e}_{7(7)}$ symmetry on a\ncircle. The ternionic row (for appropriate choices of real forms) gives the\nnon-compact global symmetries of the Lagrangian for the $D=4$ maximal\n$\\mathcal{N}=8$, magic $\\mathcal{N}=2$ and magic non-supersymmetric theories\nobtained by dimensionally reducing the parent $D=5$ theories on a circle. In\nparticular, the Kantor-Koecher-Tits intermediate non-reductive Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{e}_{6(6)\\scriptscriptstyle{\\frac{1}{4}}}$ is the non-compact global\nsymmetry algebra of $D=4$, $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity as obtained by\ndimensionally reducing $D=5$, $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity with\n$\\mathfrak{e}_{6(6)}$ symmetry on a circle.\n", "  We present an efficient implementation of a surface Green's-function method\nfor atomistic modeling of surfaces within the framework of density functional\ntheory using a pseudopotential localized basis set approach. In this method,\nthe system is described as a truly semi-infinite solid with a surface region\ncoupled to an electron reservoir, thereby overcoming several fundamental\ndrawbacks of the traditional slab approach. The versatility of the method is\ndemonstrated with several applications to surface physics and chemistry\nproblems that are inherently difficult to address properly with the slab\nmethod, including metal work function calculations, band alignment in thin-film\nsemiconductor heterostructures, surface states in metals and topological\ninsulators, and surfaces in external electrical fields. Results obtained with\nthe surface Green's-function method are compared to experimental measurements\nand slab calculations to demonstrate the accuracy of the approach.\n", "  In earlier papers we have studied the turbulent flow exponents $\\zeta_p$,\nwhere $\\langle|\\Delta{\\bf v}|^p\\rangle\\sim\\ell^{\\zeta_p}$ is the contribution\nto the fluid velocity at small scale $\\ell$. Using ideas of non-equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics we have found $$\n\\zeta_p={p\\over3}-{1\\over\\ln\\kappa}\\ln\\Gamma({p\\over3}+1) $$ where $1/ln\\kappa$\nis experimentally $\\approx 0.32\\pm 0.01$. The purpose of the present note is to\npropose a somewhat more physical derivation of the formula for $\\zeta_p$. We\nalso present an estimate $\\approx 100$ for the Reynolds number at the onset of\nturbulence.\n", "  We update the constraints on the cosmological parameters by adopting the\nPlanck data released in 2015 and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements\nincluding the new DR14 quasar sample measurement at redshift $z=1.52$, and we\nconclude that the based six-parameter $\\Lambda$CDM model is preferred.\nExploring some extensions to the $\\Lambda$CDM models, we find that the equation\nof state of dark energy reads $w=-1.036\\pm 0.056$ in the $w$CDM model, the\neffective relativistic degrees of freedom in the Universe is\n$N_\\text{eff}=3.09_{-0.20}^{+0.18}$ in the $N_\\text{eff}+\\Lambda$CDM model and\nthe spatial curvature parameter is $\\Omega_k=(1.8\\pm1.9)\\times 10^{-3}$ in the\n$\\Omega_k+\\Lambda$CDM model at $68\\%$ confidence level (C.L.), and the $95\\%$\nC.L. upper bounds on the sum of three active neutrinos masses are $\\sum\nm_\\nu<0.16$ eV for the normal hierarchy (NH) and $\\sum m_\\nu<0.19$ eV for the\ninverted hierarchy (IH) with $\\Delta\\chi^2\\equiv\n\\chi^2_\\text{NH}-\\chi^2_\\text{IH}=-1.25$.\n", "  We investigate quasar outflows at $z \\geq 6$ by performing zoom-in\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations. By employing the SPH code GADGET-3, we\nzoom in the $2 R_{200}$ region around a $2 \\times 10^{12} M_{\\odot}$ halo at $z\n= 6$, inside a $(500 ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving volume. We compare the results of\nour AGN runs with a control simulation in which only stellar/SN feedback is\nconsidered. Seeding $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ BHs at the centers of $10^{9} M_{\\odot}$\nhalos, we find the following results. BHs accrete gas at the Eddington rate\nover $z = 9 - 6$. At $z = 6$, our most-massive BH has grown to $M_{\\rm BH} = 4\n\\times 10^9 M_{\\odot}$. Fast ($v_{r} > 1000$ km/s), powerful ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nout} \\sim 2000 M_{\\odot}$/yr) outflows of shock-heated low-density gas form at\n$z \\sim 7$, and propagate up to hundreds kpc. Star-formation is quenched over\n$z = 8 - 6$, and the total SFR (SFR surface density near the galaxy center) is\nreduced by a factor of $5$ ($1000$). We analyse the relative contribution of\nmultiple physical process: (i) disrupting cosmic filamentary cold gas inflows,\n(ii) reducing central gas density, (iii) ejecting gas outside the galaxy; and\nfind that AGN feedback has the following effects at $z = 6$. The inflowing gas\nmass fraction is reduced by $\\sim 12 \\%$, the high-density gas fraction is\nlowered by $\\sim 13 \\%$, and $\\sim 20 \\%$ of the gas outflows at a speed larger\nthan the escape velocity ($500$ km/s). We conclude that quasar-host galaxies at\n$z \\geq 6$ are accreting non-negligible amount of cosmic gas, nevertheless AGN\nfeedback quenches their star formation dominantly by powerful outflows ejecting\ngas out of the host galaxy halo.\n", "  The goal of this note is to show that, also in a bounded domain $\\Omega\n\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, with $\\partial \\Omega\\in C^2$, any weak solution,\n$(u(x,t),p(x,t))$, of the Euler equations of ideal incompressible fluid in\n$\\Omega\\times (0,T) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\mathbb{R}_t$, with the\nimpermeability boundary condition: $u\\cdot \\vec n =0$ on\n$\\partial\\Omega\\times(0,T)$, is of constant energy on the interval $(0,T)$\nprovided the velocity field $u \\in L^3((0,T);\nC^{0,\\alpha}(\\overline{\\Omega}))$, with $\\alpha>\\frac13\\,.$\n", "  We study a one-dimensional (1D) chain of $2N$ Majorana bound states, which\ninteract through a local quartic interaction. This model describes for example\nthe edge physics of a quasi 1D stack of $2N$ Kitaev chains with modified\ntime-reversal symmetry $T\\gamma_iT^{-1}=\\gamma_i$, which precludes the presence\nof quadratic coupling. The ground state of our 1D Majorana chain displays a\nfour-fold periodicity in $N$, corresponding to the four distinct topological\nclasses of the stacked Kitaev chains. We analyze the transport properties of\nthe 1D Majorana chain, when probed by local conductors located at its ends. We\nfind that for finite but large $N$, the scattering matrix partially reflects\nthe four-fold periodicity, and the chain exhibits strikingly different\ntransport properties for different chain lengths. In the thermodynamic limit,\nthe 1D Majorana chain hosts a robust many-body zero mode, which indicates that\nthe corresponding stacked two-dimensional bulk system realizes a weak\ntopological phase.\n", "  Grid-control is a lightweight and highly portable open source submission tool\nthat supports virtually all workflows in high energy physics (HEP). Since 2007\nit has been used by a sizeable number of HEP analyses to process tasks that\nsometimes consist of up 100k jobs. grid-control is built around a powerful\nplugin and configuration system, that allows users to easily specify all\naspects of the desired workflow. Job submission to a wide range of local or\nremote batch systems or grid middleware is supported. Tasks can be conveniently\nspecified through the parameter space that will be processed, which can consist\nof any number of variables and data sources with complex dependencies on each\nother. Dataset information is processed through a configurable pipeline of\ndataset filters, partition plugins and partition filters. The partition plugins\ncan take the number of files, size of the work units, metadata or combinations\nthereof into account. All changes to the input datasets or variables are\npropagated through the processing pipeline and can transparently trigger\nadjustments to the parameter space and the job submission. While the core\nfunctionality is completely experiment independent, integration with the CMS\ncomputing environment is provided by a small set of plugins.\n", "  We introduce and study renormalization group interfaces between two\nholographic conformal theories which are related by deformation by a scalar\ndouble trace operator. At leading order in the 1/N expansion, we derive\nexpressions for the two point correlation functions of the scalar, as well as\nthe spectrum of operators living on the interface. We also compute the\ninterface contribution to the sphere partition function, which in two\ndimensions gives the boundary g factor. Checks of our proposal include\nreproducing the g factor and some defect overlap coefficients of Gaiotto's RG\ninterfaces at large N, and the two-point correlation function whenever\nconformal perturbation theory is valid.\n", "  A mapping of the process on a continuous configuration space to the symbolic\nrepresentation of the motion on a discrete state space will be combined with an\niterative aggregation and disaggregation (IAD) procedure to obtain steady state\ndistributions of the process. The IAD speeds up the convergence to the unit\neigenvector, which is the steady state distribution, by forming smaller\naggregated matrices whose unit eigenvector solutions are used to refine\napproximations of the steady state vector until convergence is reached. This\nmethod works very efficiently and can be used together with distributed or\nparallel computing methods to obtain high resolution images of the steady state\ndistribution of complex atomistic or energy landscape type problems. The method\nis illustrated in two numerical examples. In the first example the transition\nmatrix is assumed to be known. The second example represents an overdamped\nBrownian motion process subject to a dichotomously changing external potential.\n", "  We analyze the oscillatory dynamics of a time-delayed dynamical system\nsubjected to a periodic external forcing. We show that, for certain values of\nthe delay, the response can be greatly enhanced by a very small forcing\namplitude. This phenomenon is related to the presence of a Bogdanov- Takens\nbifurcation and displays some analogies to other resonance phenomena, but also\nsubstantial differences.\n", "  Cracks, the major vehicle for material failure, tend to accelerate to high\nvelocities in brittle materials. In three-dimensions, cracks generically\nundergo a micro-branching instability at about 40% of their sonic limiting\nvelocity. Recent experiments showed that in sufficiently thin systems cracks\nunprecedentedly accelerate to nearly their limiting velocity without\nmicro-branching, until they undergo an oscillatory instability. Despite their\nfundamental importance and apparent similarities to other instabilities in\ncondensed-matter physics and materials science, these dynamic fracture\ninstabilities remain poorly understood. They are not described by the classical\ntheory of cracks, which assumes that linear elasticity is valid inside a\nstressed material and uses an extraneous local symmetry criterion to predict\ncrack paths. Here we develop a model of two-dimensional dynamic brittle\nfracture capable of predicting arbitrary paths of ultra-high-speed cracks in\nthe presence of elastic nonlinearity without extraneous criteria. We show, by\nextensive computations, that cracks undergo a dynamic oscillatory instability\ncontrolled by small-scale elastic nonlinearity near the crack tip. This\ninstability occurs above a ultra-high critical velocity and features an\nintrinsic wavelength that increases proportionally to the ratio of the fracture\nenergy to an elastic modulus, in quantitative agreement with experiments. This\nratio emerges as a fundamental scaling length assumed to play no role in the\nclassical theory of cracks, but shown here to strongly influence crack\ndynamics. Those results pave the way for resolving other long-standing puzzles\nin the failure of materials.\n", "  The Dicke-Ising model describes cavity quantum electrodynamics setups in\nwhich dipoles couple not only with the photonic cavity field but also to each\nother through dipole-dipole interaction. In this work we diagonalise such a\nmodel in terms of bosonic polaritonic operators for arbitrarily large values of\nthe light-matter coupling and for values of the dipole-dipole interaction until\nthe onset of the ferromagnetic Ising phase transition. In order to accomplish\nthis task we exploit higher order terms of the Holstein-Primakoff\ntransformation, developing a general method which allows to solve the normal\nphase of the Ising model in term of bosonic excitations for large values of the\ndipole-dipole interaction. Our results shed light on the interplay between the\ndipole-dipole and the light-matter coupling strengths, and their effect on the\nvirtual excitations which populate the ground-state when the interactions\nbecome comparable with the bare transition frequency.\n", "  We investigate and map out the non-equilibrium phase diagram of a\ngeneralization of the well known Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper (AAH) model. This\ngeneralized AAH (GAAH) model is known to have a single-particle mobility edge\nwhich also has an additional self-dual property akin to that of the critical\npoint of AAH model. By calculating the imbalance, we get hints of a rich phase\ndiagram. We find a fascinating connection between single particle wavefunctions\nnear the mobility edge of GAAH model and the wavefunctions of the critical AAH\nmodel. By placing this model far-from-equilibrium with the aid of two baths, we\ninvestigate the open system transport via system size scaling of\nnon-equilibrium steady state (NESS) current. Current is calculated by fully\nexact non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. The critical point of\nthe AAH model now generalizes to a 'critical' line separating regions of\nballistic and localized transport. Like critical point of AAH model, current\nscales sub-diffusively with system size on the 'critical' line ($I\\sim\nN^{-2\\pm0.1}$). However, remarkably, the scaling exponent on this line is\ndistinctly different from that obtained for the critical AAH model (where\n$I\\sim N^{-1.4\\pm0.05}$). All these results can be understood from the\nabove-mentioned connection between states near mobility edge of GAAH model and\nthose of critical AAH model. A very interesting high temperature\nnon-equilibrium phase diagram of the GAAH model emerges from our calculations.\n", "  A global $U(1)_\\text{PQ}$ symmetry is protected from gravitational effects in\nthe s-confining $SU(N)^k$ product group theory with $A+4Q +N\\overline{Q}$\nmatter. If the $SU(4)$ family symmetry is gauged and an appropriate tree-level\nsuperpotential is added, then the dynamically generated superpotential\nspontaneously breaks $SU(4)\\times U(1)_\\text{PQ} \\rightarrow SU(3)_c$ and\nproduces a QCD axion. Small values of the $CP$-violating $\\theta$ parameter are\nthen possible without any fine-tuning, as long as the product group is suitably\nlarge. By introducing a second copy of the s-confining $SU(N)$ product group\nalso coupled to the gauged $SU(4)$, we find that values as small as $N=7$ are\nconsistent with $\\bar\\theta<10^{-10}$, even under the pessimistic assumption\nthat the dominant contribution to the axion quality is at tree level.\n", "  The bright M dwarf K2-18 at 34 pc is known to host a transiting\nsuper-Earth-sized planet orbiting within the star's habitable zone; K2-18b.\nGiven the superlative nature of this system for studying an exoplanetary\natmosphere receiving similar levels of insolation as the Earth, we aim to\ncharacterize the planet's mass which is required to interpret atmospheric\nproperties and infer the planet's bulk composition. We obtain precision radial\nvelocity measurements with the HARPS spectrograph and couple those measurements\nwith the K2 photometry to jointly model the observed radial velocity variation\nwith planetary signals and a radial velocity jitter model based on Gaussian\nprocess regression. We measure the mass of K2-18b to be $8.0 \\pm 1.9$\nM$_{\\oplus}$ with a bulk density of $3.7 \\pm 0.9$ g/cm$^3$ which may correspond\nto a predominantly rocky planet with a significant gaseous envelope or an ocean\nplanet with a water mass fraction $\\gtrsim 50$%. We also find strong evidence\nfor a second, warm super-Earth K2-18c at $\\sim 9$ days with a semi-major axis\n2.4 times smaller than the transiting K2-18b. After re-analyzing the available\nlight curves of K2-18 we conclude that K2-18c is not detected in transit and\ntherefore likely has an orbit that is non-coplanar with K2-18b. A suite of\ndynamical integrations with varying simulated orbital eccentricities of the two\nplanets are used to further constrain each planet's eccentricity posterior from\nwhich we measure $e_b < 0.43$ and $e_c < 0.47$ at 99% confidence. The discovery\nof the inner planet K2-18c further emphasizes the prevalence of multi-planet\nsystems around M dwarfs. The characterization of the density of K2-18b reveals\nthat the planet likely has a thick gaseous envelope which along with its\nproximity to the Solar system makes the K2-18 planetary system an interesting\ntarget for the atmospheric study of an exoplanet receiving Earth-like\ninsolation.\n", "  A new large-scale parallel multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF)\nimplementation in the open-source NWChem computational chemistry code is\npresented. The generalized active space (GAS) approach is used to partition\nlarge configuration interaction (CI) vectors and generate a sufficient number\nof batches that can be distributed to the available nodes. Massively parallel\nCI calculations with large active spaces can be treated. The performance of the\nnew parallel MCSCF implementation is presented for the chromium trimer and for\nan active space of 20 electrons in 20 orbitals. Unprecedented CI calculations\nwith an active space of 22 electrons in 22 orbitals for the pentacene systems\nwere performed and a single CI iteration calculation with an active space of 24\nelectrons in 24 orbitals for the chromium tetramer was possible. The chromium\ntetramer corresponds to a CI expansion of one trillion SDs (914 058 513 424)\nand is largest conventional CI calculation attempted up to date.\n", "  We investigate the impact of operators of higher canonical dimension on the\nlower Higgs mass consistency bound by means of generalized Higgs-Yukawa\ninteractions. Analogously to higher-order operators in the bare Higgs potential\nin an effective field theory approach, the inclusion of higher-order Yukawa\ninteractions, e.g., $\\phi^3\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$, leads to a diminishing of the lower\nHiggs mass bound and thus to a shift of the scale of new physics towards larger\nscales by a few orders of magnitude without introducing a metastability in the\neffective Higgs potential. We observe that similar renormalization group\nmechanisms near the weak-coupling fixed point are at work in both\ngeneralizations of the microscopic action. Thus, a combination of\nhigher-dimensional operators with generalized Higgs as well as Yukawa\ninteractions does not lead to an additive shift of the lower mass bound, but\nrelaxes the consistency bounds found recently only slightly. On the method\nside, we clarify the convergence properties of different projection and\nexpansion schemes for the Yukawa potential used in the functional\nrenormalization group literature so far.\n", "  We investigate compact halos of sterile-neutrino dark matter and examine\nobservable signatures with respect to neutrino and photon emission. Primarily,\nwe consider two cases: primordial black-hole halos and ultra-compact\nmini-halos. In both cases, we find that there exists a broad range of possible\nparameter choices such that detection in the near future with X-ray and\ngamma-ray telescopes might be well possible. In fact, for energies above\n$10\\,{\\rm TeV}$, the neutrino telescope IceCube would be a splendid detection\nmachine for such macroscopic dark-matter candidates.\n", "  In the present work we study the production of vector resonances at the LHC\nby means of the vector boson scattering $WZ \\to WZ$ and explore the\nsensitivities to these resonances for the expected future LHC luminosities. We\nare assuming that these vector resonances are generated dynamically from the\nself interactions of the longitudinal gauge bosons, $W_L$ and $Z_L$, and work\nunder the framework of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian to describe in a model\nindependent way the supposedly strong dynamics of these modes. The properties\nof the vector resonances, mass, width and couplings to the $W$ and $Z$ gauge\nbosons are derived from the inverse amplitude method approach. We implement all\nthese features into a single model, the IAM-MC, adapted for MonteCarlo, built\nin a Lagrangian language in terms of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian and a\nchiral Lagrangian for the vector resonances, which mimics the resonant behavior\nof the IAM and provides unitary amplitudes. The model has been implemented in\nMadGraph, allowing us to perform a realistic study of the signal versus\nbackground events at the LHC. In particular, we have focused our study on the\n$pp\\to WZjj$ type of events, discussing first on the potential of the hadronic\nand semileptonic channels of the final $WZ$, and next exploring in more detail\nthe clearest signals. These are provided by the leptonic decays of the gauge\nbosons, leading to a final state with $\\ell_1^+\\ell_1^-\\ell_2^+\\nu jj$,\n$\\ell=e,\\mu$, having a very distinctive signature, and showing clearly the\nemergence of the resonances with masses in the range of 1.5-2.5 TeV, which we\nhave explored.\n", "  We extend the foliation-based quantization scheme of \\cite{Park:2014tia} to\narbitrary asymptotically flat backgrounds including time- and position-\ndependent ones. One of the ingredients to accomplish the extension is\nimposition of a Neumann-type boundary condition. The quantization procedure,\nespecially the gauge-fixing-induced reduction, provides a new insight into the\nblack hole information paradox. The hypersurface degrees of freedom in the\nasymptotic region - whose dynamics should be responsible for part of the `hair'\n- and transitions among various excitations play a central role in the global\nformulation of the information and proposed solution of the information\nparadox. In retrospect, the quantization scheme reveals the origin of the\ndifficulty of the information problem: the problem's ties with the quantization\nof gravity and subtle boundary dynamics as well as the multilayered techniques\nrequired for its setup and study. We also comment on the implications of the\nasymptotic symmetries for the present quantization framework.\n", "  The $\\beta$-ensembles of random matrix theory with classical weights have\nmany special properties. One is that the loop equations specifying the\nresolvent and corresponding multipoint correlators permit a derivation at\ngeneral order of the correlator via Aomoto's method from the theory of the\nSelberg integral. We use Aomoto's method to derive the full hierarchy of loop\nequations for Laguerre and Jacobi $\\beta$ ensembles, and use these to\nsystematically construct the explicit form of the $1/N$ expansion at low\norders. This allows us to give the explicit form of corrections to the global\ndensity, and allows various moments to be computed, complementing results\navailable in the literature motivated by problems in quantum transport.\n", "  Polymer quantum mechanics has been studied as a simplified picture that\nreflects some of the key properties of Loop Quantum Gravity; however, while the\nfate of relativistic symmetries in Loop Quantum Gravity is still not\nestablished, it is usually assumed that the discrete polymer structure should\nlead to a breakdown of relativistic symmetries. We here focus for simplicity on\na one-spatial-dimension polymer model and show that relativistic symmetries are\ndeformed, rather than being broken. The specific type of deformed relativistic\nsymmetries which we uncover appears to be closely related to analogous\ndescriptions of relativistic symmetries in some noncommutative spacetimes. This\nalso contributes to an ongoing effort attempting to establish whether the\n\"quantum-Minkowski limit\" of Loop Quantum Gravity is a noncommutative\nspacetime.\n", "  A systematic temperature dependent study of the femtosecond optical\nsuperconducting (SC) state destruction and recovery in\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta}$ cuprate superconductor by means of the\nall-optical polarization-sensitive multi-pulse spectroscopy is presented. At\nlow temperatures and a partial SC state suppression an anisotropic SC-gap\nrecovery-timescale is suggested by the data. The SC state destruction and\nrecovery dynamics are compared to the recent TR-ARPES-inferred SC-gap dynamics\nand a qualitative agreement is found. Using a phenomenological response\nfunction the experimental data are also compared to time dependent\nGinzburg-Landau model simulations.\n", "  We study natural perturbations of the Laughlin state arising from the effects\nof trapping and disorder. These are N-particle wave functions that have the\nform of a product of Laughlin states and analytic functions of the N variables.\nWe derive an upper bound to the ground state energy in a confining external\npotential, matching exactly a recently derived lower bound in the large N\nlimit. Irrespective of the shape of the confining potential, this sharp upper\nbound can be achieved through a modification of the Laughlin function by\nsuitably arranged quasi-holes.\n", "  We explicitly construct families of integrable $\\sigma$-model actions\nsmoothly interpolating between exact CFTs. In the ultraviolet the theory is the\ndirect product of two current algebras at levels $k_1$ and $k_2$. In the\ninfrared and for the case of two deformation matrices the CFT involves a coset\nCFT, whereas for a single matrix deformation it is given by the ultraviolet\ndirect product theories but at levels $k_1$ and $k_2-k_1$. For isotropic\ndeformations we demonstrate integrability. In this case we also compute the\nexact beta-function for the deformation parameters using gravitational methods.\nThis is shown to coincide with previous results obtained using perturbation\ntheory and non-perturbative symmetries.\n", "  It is shown that by fitting a Markovian quantum master equation to the\nnumerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation of a system of\ntwo spin-1/2 particles interacting with a bath of up to 34 spin-1/2 particles,\nthe former can describe the dynamics of the two-spin system rather well. The\nfitting procedure that yields this Markovian quantum master equation accounts\nfor all non-Markovian effects in as much the general structure of this equation\nallows and yields a description that is incompatible with the Lindblad\nequation.\n", "  We present ALMA band 3 observations of the CO(6-5), CO(7-6), and [CI]\n369micron emission lines in three of the highest redshift quasar host galaxies\nat 6.6<z<6.9. These measurements constitute the highest-redshift CO detections\nto date. The target quasars have previously been detected in [CII] 158micron\nemission and the underlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum. We detect\n(spatially unresolved, at a resolution of >2\", or >14kpc) CO emission in all\nthree quasar hosts. In two sources, we detect the continuum emission around\n400micron (rest-frame), and in one source we detect [CI] at low significance.\nWe derive molecular gas reservoirs of (1-3)x10^10 M_sun in the quasar hosts,\ni.e. approximately only 10 times the mass of their central supermassive black\nholes. The extrapolated [CII]-to-CO(1-0) luminosity ratio is 2500-4200,\nconsistent with measurements in galaxies at lower redshift. The detection of\nthe [CI] line in one quasar host galaxy and the limit on the [CI] emission in\nthe other two hosts enables a first characterization of the physical properties\nof the interstellar medium in z~7 quasar hosts. In the sources, the derived\nglobal CO/[CII]/[CI] line ratios are consistent with expectations from\nphotodissociation regions (PDR), but not X-ray dominated regions (XDR). This\nsuggest that quantities derived from the molecular gas and dust emission are\nrelated to ongoing star-formation activity in the quasar hosts, providing\nfurther evidence that the quasar hosts studied here harbor intense starbursts\nin addition to their active nucleus.\n", "  Analogies between evolutionary dynamics and statistical mechanics, such as\nFisher's second-law-like \"fundamental theorem of natural selection\" and\nWright's \"fitness landscapes\", have had a deep and fruitful influence on the\ndevelopment of evolutionary theory. Here I discuss a new conceptual link\nbetween evolution and statistical physics. I argue that natural selection can\nbe viewed as a coarsening phenomenon, similar to the growth of domain size in\nquenched magnets or to Ostwald ripening in alloys and emulsions. In particular,\nI show that the most remarkable features of coarsening---scaling and\nself-similarity---have strict equivalents in evolutionary dynamics. This\nanalogy has three main virtues: it brings a set of well-developed mathematical\ntools to bear on evolutionary dynamics; it suggests new problems in theoretical\nevolution; and it provides coarsening physics with a new exactly soluble model.\n", "  Here we investigate the origin of the dust mass (Mdust) observed in the Milky\nWay (MW) and of dust scaling relations found in a sample of local galaxies from\nthe DGS and KINGFISH surveys. To this aim, we model dust production from\nAsymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and supernovae (SNe) in simulated galaxies\nforming along the assembly of a Milky Way-like halo in a well resolved cosmic\nvolume of 4cMpc using the GAMESH pipeline. We explore the impact of different\nsets of metallicity and mass-dependent AGB and SN dust yields on the predicted\nMdust. Our results show that models accounting for grain destruction by the SN\nreverse shock predict a total dust mass in the MW that is a factor of ~4 lower\nthan observed, and can not reproduce the observed galaxy-scale relations\nbetween dust and stellar masses, and dust-to-gas ratios and metallicity, with a\nsmaller discrepancy in galaxies with low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) < 7.5) and\nlow stellar masses (Mstar < 10^7 Msun). In agreement with previous studies, we\nsuggest that competing processes in the interstellar medium must be at play to\nexplain the observed trends. Our result reinforces this conclusion by showing\nthat it holds independently of the adopted AGB and SN dust yields.\n", "  The thermodynamic theory of dislocation-enabled plasticity is based on two\nunconventional hypotheses. The first of these is that a system of dislocations,\ndriven by external forces and irreversibly exchanging heat with its\nenvironment, must be characterized by a thermodynamically defined effective\ntemperature that is not the same as the ordinary temperature. The second\nhypothesis is that the overwhelmingly dominant mechanism controlling plastic\ndeformation is thermally activated depinning of entangled pairs of\ndislocations. This paper consists of a systematic reformulation of this theory\nfollowed by examples of its use in analyses of experimentally observed\nphenomena including strain hardening, grain-size (Hall-Petch) effects, yielding\ntransitions, and adiabatic shear banding.\n", "  The relative entropy between very high energy localized excitations and the\nvacuum, where both states are reduced to a spatial region, gives place to a\nprecise definition of a local temperature produced by vacuum entanglement\nacross the boundary. This generalizes the Unruh temperature of the Rindler\nwedge to arbitrary regions. The local temperatures can be read off from the\nshort distance leading terms in the modular Hamiltonian. For free scalar and\nfermion fields they have a universal geometric expression that follows by\nsolving a particular eikonal type equation in Euclidean space. This equation\ngeneralizes to any dimension the holomorphic property that holds in two\ndimensions. For regions of arbitrary shapes the local temperatures at a point\nare direction dependent. We compute their explicit expression for the geometry\nof a wall or strip.\n", "  We study transport properties of an arbitrary two terminal Hermitian system\nwithin a tight-binding approximation and derive the expression for the\ntransparency in the form, which enables one to determine exact energies of\nperfect (unity) transmittance, zero transmittance (Fano resonance) and bound\nstate in the continuum (BIC). These energies correspond to the real roots of\ntwo energy-dependent functions that are obtained from two non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians: the Feshbach's effective Hamiltonian and the auxiliary\nHamiltonian, which can be easily deduced from the effective one. BICs and\nscattering states are deeply connected to each other. We show that\ntransformation of a scattering state into a BIC can be formally described as a\n\"phase transition\" with divergent generalized response function. Design rules\nfor quantum conductors and waveguides are presented, which determine structures\nexhibiting coalescence of both resonances and antiresonances resulting in the\nformation of almost rectangular transparency and reflection windows. The\nresults can find applications in construction of molecular conductors, broad\nband filters, quantum heat engines and waveguides with controllable BIC\nformation.\n", "  Ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation is a new mode of inflation which corresponds\nto the occasions when the inflaton field must traverse an extremely flat part\nof the scalar potential, when the usual slow-roll (SR) fails. We investigate\nUSR and obtain an estimate for how long it lasts, given the initial kinetic\ndensity of the inflaton. We also find that, if the initial kinetic density is\nsmall enough, USR can be avoided and the usual SR treatment is valid. This has\nimportant implications for inflection-point inflation.\n", "  In this paper we classify in terms of Lie point symmetries the\nthree-dimensional nonrelativistic motion of charged particles in arbitrary\ntime-independent electromagnetic fields. The classification is made on the\nground of equivalence transformations, and, when the system is nonlinear and\nparticularly for inhomogeneous and curved magnetic fields, it is also complete.\nUsing the homogeneous Maxwell's equations as auxiliary conditions for\nconsistency, in which case the system amounts to a Lagrangian of three degrees\nof freedom with velocity-dependent potentials, the equivalence group stays the\nsame. Therefore, instead of the actual fields, the potentials are equally\nemployed and their gauge invariance results in an infinite-dimensional\nequivalence algebra, which nevertheless projects to finite-dimensional symmetry\nalgebras. Subsequently, optimal systems of equivalence subalgebras are obtained\nthat lead to one-, two- and three-parameter extended symmetry groups, besides\nthe obvious time translations. Finally, based on symmetries of Noether type,\naspects of complete integrability are discussed, as well.\n", "  Nb$_3$Sn has great potential to become the material of choice for fabrication\nof SRF cavities. The higher critical temperature of Nb$_3$Sn potentially allows\nfor an increased operational temperature in SRF cavities, which could enable\ntremendous simplification of cryogenic system, leading to significant cost\nreduction. We present extended characterization of a Nb$_3$Sn coated Nb cavity\nprepared at Cornell University. Using combination of thermometry during cavity\nRF measurements, and structural and analytical characterization of the cavity\ncutouts, we discover Nb$_3$Sn coating flaws responsible for the poor cavity\nperformance. Our results clearly show degraded material quality in the cavity\ncutouts which exhibit significant heating during the RF testing. Results of\nextended comparison of cavity cutouts with different dissipation profiles not\nonly point out the cause of significant Q-slope but also establish figures of\nmerit for material qualities in relation to the quality of SRF performance.\n", "  We compare the transition barrier that accompanies a first-order phase\ntransition in the canonical and microcanonical ensemble. This is directly\nencoded in the probability distributions of standard Metropolis Monte Carlo\nsimulations and a proper microcanonical sampling technique. For the example of\ndroplet formation, we find that in both ensembles the transition barrier scales\nas expected but that the barrier is much smaller in the microcanonical\nensemble. In addition its growth with system size is weaker which will enhance\nthis difference for larger systems. We provide an intuitive physical\nexplanation for this observation.\n", "  We investigate the out-of-equilibrium properties of a simple quantum impurity\nmodel, the interacting resonant level model (IRLM). We focus on the scaling\nregime, where the bandwidth of the fermions in the leads is larger than all the\nother energies, so that the lattice and the continuum versions of the model\nbecome equivalent. Using time-dependent DMRG simulations initialized with\nstates having different densities in the two leads we extend the results of\nBoulat, Saleur and Schmitteckert [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 140601 (2008)]\nconcerning the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) curves, for several values of the\ninteraction strength $U$. We estimate numerically the Kondo scale $T_B$ and the\nexponent $b(U)$ associated to the tunneling of the fermions from the leads to\nthe dot. Next we analyze the quantum entanglement properties of the steady\nstates. We focus in particular on the entropy rate $\\alpha$, describing the\nlinear growth with time of the bipartite entanglement in the system. We show\nthat, as for the current, $\\alpha/T_B$ is described by some function of $U$ and\nof the rescaled bias $V/T_B$. Finally, the spatial structure of the entropy\nprofiles is discussed.\n", "  We consider the structure of current and stress tensor two-point functions in\nconformal field theory with a boundary. The main result of this paper is a\nrelation between a boundary central charge and the coefficient of a\ndisplacement operator correlation function in the boundary limit. The boundary\ncentral charge under consideration is the coefficient of the product of the\nextrinsic curvature and the Weyl curvature in the conformal anomaly. Along the\nway, we describe several auxiliary results. Three of the more notable are as\nfollows: (1) we give the bulk and boundary conformal blocks for the current\ntwo-point function; (2) we show that the structure of these current and stress\ntensor two-point functions is essentially universal for all free theories; (3)\nwe introduce a class of interacting conformal field theories with boundary\ndegrees of freedom, where the interactions are confined to the boundary. The\nmost interesting example we consider can be thought of as the infrared fixed\npoint of graphene. This particular interacting conformal model in four\ndimensions provides a counterexample of a previously conjectured relation\nbetween a boundary central charge and a bulk central charge. The model also\ndemonstrates that the boundary central charge can change in response to\nmarginal deformations.\n", "  We investigate the non linear mixing of orbital angular momentum in type II\nsecond harmonic generation with arbitrary topological charges imprinted on two\northogonally polarized beams. Starting from the basic nonlinear equations for\nthe interacting fields, we derive the selection rules determining the set of\nparaxial modes taking part in the interaction. Conservation of orbital angular\nmomentum naturally appears as the topological charge selection rule. However, a\nless intuitive rule applies to the radial orders when modes carrying opposite\nhelicities are combined in the nonlinear crystal, an intriguing feature\nconfirmed by experimental measurements.\n", "  We perform a magneto-optical study of a two-dimensional electron systems\n(2DES) in the regime of the Stoner ferromagnetic instability for even quantum\nHall filling factors on Mg$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$O/ZnO heterostructures. Under\nconditions of Landau-level crossing, caused by enhanced spin susceptibility in\ncombination with the tilting of the magnetic field, the transition between two\nrivaling phases- paramagnetic and ferromagnetic- is traced in terms of optical\nspectra reconstruction. Synchronous sharp transformations are observed both in\nthe photoluminescence structure and parameters of collective excitations upon\ntransition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering. Based on these\nmeasurements, a phase diagram is constructed in terms of the 2D electron\ndensity and tilt angle of the magnetic field. Apart from stable paramagnetic\nand ferromagnetic phases, an instability region is found at intermediate\nparameters with the Stoner transition occurring at $\\nu\\approx 2$. The spin\nconfiguration in all cases is unambiguously determined by means of inelastic\nlight scattering by spin-sensitive collective excitations. One indicator of the\nspin ordering is the intra-Landau-level spin exciton, which acquires a large\nspectral weight in the ferromagnetic phases. The other - is an abrupt energy\nshift of the intersubband charge density excitation due to change in the\nmany-particle energy contribution upon spin rearrangement. From our analysis of\nphotoluminescence and light scattering data, we estimate the ratio of surface\nareas occupied by the domains of the two phases in the vicinity of a transition\npoint. In addition, the thermal smearing of a phase transition is\ncharacterized.\n", "  We have derived explicit expressions for the sum rules of order one of the\neigenvalues of the negative Laplacian on two dimensional domains of arbitrary\nshape. Taking into account the leading asymptotic behavior of these\neigenvalues, as given from Weyl's law, we show that it is possible to define\nsum rules that are finite, using different prescriptions. We provide the\nexplicit expressions and test them on a number of non trivial examples,\ncomparing the exact results with precise numerical results.\n", "  Accounting for viscous damping within Fokker-Planck equations led to various\nimprovements in the understanding and analysis of nuclear fission of heavy\nnuclei. Analytical expressions for the fission time are typically provided by\nKramers' theory, which improves on the Bohr-Wheeler estimate by including the\ntime-scale related to many-particle dissipative processes along the deformation\ncoordinate. However, Kramers' formula breaks down for sufficiently high\nexcitation energies where Kramers' assumption of a large barrier no longer\nholds. In the regime $T>1$ MeV, Kramers' theory should be replaced by a new\ntheory based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck first-passage time method that is\nproposed here. The theory is applied to fission time data from fusion-fission\nexperiments on $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb $\\rightarrow$ $^{224}$Th. The proposed model\nprovides an internally consistent one-parameter fitting of fission data with a\nconstant nuclear friction as the fitting parameter, whereas Kramers' fitting\nrequires a value of friction which falls out of the allowed range. The theory\nprovides also an analytical formula that in future work can be easily\nimplemented in numerical codes such as CASCADE or JOANNE4.\n", "  We point out that the expansion of the universe leads to a cosmological time\nevolution of the vacuum expectation of the Higgs boson. Within the standard\nmodel of particle physics, the cosmological time evolution of the vacuum\nexpectation of the Higgs leads to a cosmological time evolution of the masses\nof the fermions and of the electroweak gauge bosons while the scale of Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD) remains constant. Precise measurements of the cosmological\ntime evolution of $\\mu=m_e/m_p$, where $m_e$ and $m_p$ are respectively the\nelectron and proton mass (which is essentially determined by the QCD scale),\ntherefore provide a test of the standard models of particle physics and of\ncosmology. This ratio can be measured using modern atomic clocks.\n", "  Approaches based on viscous hydrodynamics for the hot and dense stage and\nhadronic transport for the final dilute rescattering stage are successfully\napplied to the dynamic description of heavy ion reactions at high beam\nenergies. One crucial step in such hybrid approaches is the so called\nparticlization, the transition between the hydrodynamic description to\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom. For this purpose, individual particles are\nsampled on the Cooper-Frye hypersurface. In this work, 4 different realizations\nof sampling algorithms are compared, where three of them incorporate global\nconservation laws of quantum numbers in each event. The algorithms are compared\nwithin two types of scenarios: simple \"box\" hypersurface consisting of only one\nstatic cell and a typical particlization hypersurface for Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV. For all algorithms the mean multiplicities\n(or particle spectra) remain unaffected by global conservation laws in the case\nof large volumes. In contrast, the fluctuations of the particle numbers are\naffected considerably. The fluctuations of the newly developed SPREW algorithm\nbased on exponential weights and the recently suggested SER algorithm based on\nensemble rejection are smaller than without conservation laws and agree with\nthe expectation from the canonical ensemble. The previously applied mode\nsampling algorithm produces dramatically larger fluctuations, than it is\nexpected in the corresponding microcanonical ensemble, and therefore should be\navoided in fluctuation studies. This study might be of interest for\ninvestigations of particle fluctuations and correlations, e.g. the suggested\nsignatures for a phase transition or a critical endpoint, in hybrid approaches\nthat are affected by global conservation laws.\n", "  A detailed study of energy dependence of positive kaon to pion, negative kaon\nto pion and total kaon to pion multiplicity ratio have been carried out in pp\ncollisions at 6.3, 17.3, 62.4, 200 and 900 GeV and also at root s =2.76 TeV and\n7 TeV in the framework of UrQMD and DPMJET III model. Energy dependence of\npositive kaon to pion and negative kaon to pion show different behavior in case\nof UrQMD and DPMJET III model. The presence of the horn like structure in the\nvariation of positive kaon to pion and negative kaon to pion ratio with energy\nfor the experimental data is supported by the DPMJET III model. Experimentally\nit has been observed that as energy increases, the total kaon to pion\nmultiplicity ratio increases systematically for pp collisions at lower energies\nand becomes independent of energy in LHC energy regime. Our analysis on total\nkaon to pion multiplicity ratio with UrQMD data is well supported by the\nexperimental results obtained by different collaborations in different times.\nIn case of DPMJET III data, the saturation of kaon to pion ratio at LHC region\nhas not been observed.\n", "  We consider the Regge limit of the CFT correlation functions $\\langle {\\cal\nJ} {\\cal J} {\\cal O}{\\cal O}\\rangle$ and $\\langle TT {\\cal O}{\\cal O}\\rangle$,\nwhere ${\\cal J}$ is a vector current, $T$ is the stress tensor and ${\\cal O}$\nis some scalar operator. These correlation functions are related by a type of\nFourier transform to the AdS phase shift of the dual 2-to-2 scattering process.\nAdS unitarity was conjectured some time ago to be positivity of the imaginary\npart of this bulk phase shift. This condition was recently proved using purely\nCFT arguments. For large $N$ CFTs we further expand on these ideas, by\nconsidering the phase shift in the Regge limit, which is dominated by the\nleading Regge pole with spin $j(\\nu)$, where $\\nu$ is a spectral parameter. We\ncompute the phase shift as a function of the bulk impact parameter, and then\nuse AdS unitarity to impose bounds on the analytically continued OPE\ncoefficients $C_{{\\cal J}{\\cal J}j(\\nu)}$ and $C_{TTj(\\nu)}$ that describe the\ncoupling to the leading Regge trajectory of the current ${\\cal J}$ and stress\ntensor $T$. AdS unitarity implies that the OPE coefficients associated to\nnon-minimal couplings of the bulk theory vanish at the intercept value $\\nu=0$,\nfor any CFT. Focusing on the case of large gap theories, this result can be\nused to show that the physical OPE coefficients $C_{{\\cal J}{\\cal J}T}$ and\n$C_{TTT}$, associated to non-minimal bulk couplings, scale with the gap\n$\\Delta_g$ as $\\Delta_g^{-2}$ or $\\Delta_g^{-4}$. Also, looking directly at the\nunitarity condition imposed at the OPE coefficients $C_{{\\cal J}{\\cal J}T}$ and\n$C_{TTT}$ results precisely in the known conformal collider bounds, giving a\nnew CFT derivation of these bounds. We finish with remarks on finite $N$\ntheories and show directly in the CFT that the spin function $j(\\nu)$ is\nconvex, extending this property to the continuation to complex spin.\n", "  Dark matter (DM) haloes forming near the thermal cut-off scale of the density\nperturbations are unique, since they are the smallest objects and form through\nmonolithic gravitational collapse, while larger haloes contrastingly have\nexperienced mergers. While standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulations readily\nproduce haloes that follow the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density\nprofile with an inner slope, $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\alpha}$, with $\\alpha=1$,\nrecent simulations have found that when the free-streaming cut-off expected for\nthe CDM model is resolved, the resulting haloes follow nearly power-law density\nprofiles of $\\alpha\\sim1.5$. In this paper, we study the formation of density\ncusps in haloes using idealized $N$-body simulations of the collapse of\nproto-haloes. When the proto-halo profile is initially cored due to particle\nfree-streaming at high redshift, we universally find $\\sim r^{-1.5}$ profiles\nirrespective of the proto-halo profile slope outside the core and large-scale\nnon-spherical perturbations. Quite in contrast, when the proto-halo has a\npower-law profile, then we obtain profiles compatible with the NFW shape when\nthe density slope of the proto-halo patch is shallower than a critical value,\n$\\alpha_{\\rm ini} \\sim 0.3$, while the final slope can be steeper for\n$\\alpha_{\\rm ini}\\ga 0.3$. We further demonstrate that the $r^{-1.5}$ profiles\nare sensitive to small scale noise, which gradually drives them towards an\ninner slope of $-1$, where they become resilient to such perturbations. We\ndemonstrate that the $r^{-1.5}$ solutions are in hydrostatic equilibrium,\nlargely consistent with a simple analytic model, and provide arguments that\nangular momentum appears to determine the inner slope.\n", "  We consider the conventional left-right gauge extension of the standard model\nof quarks and leptons without a scalar bidoublet. We study systematically how\none-loop radiative Dirac neutrino masses may be obtained. In addition to two\nwell-known cases from almost 30 years ago, we find two new scenarios with\nverifiable predictions.\n", "  In this paper, we address the theoretical resolution of the Vlasov-Gauss\nsystem from the linear regime to the strongly nonlinear one, when significant\ntrapping has occurred. The electric field is that of a sinusoidal electron\nplasma wave (EPW) which is assumed to grow from the noise level, and to keep\ngrowing at least up to the amplitude when linear theory in no longer valid\n(while the wave evolution in the nonlinear regime may be arbitrary). The ions\nare considered as a neutralizing fluid, while the electron response to the wave\nis derived by matching two different techniques. We make use of a perturbation\nanalysis similar to that introduced to prove the Kolmogorov-Arnold- Moser\ntheorem, up to amplitudes large enough for neo-adiabatic results to be valid.\nOur theory is applied to the growth and saturation of the beam-plasma\ninstability, and to the three-dimensional propagation of a driven EPW in a\nnon-uniform and non-stationary plasma. For the latter example, we lay a special\nemphasis on nonlinear collisionless dissipation. We provide an explicit\ntheoretical expression for the nonlinear Landau-like damping rate which, in\nsome instances, is amenable to a simple analytic formula. We also insist on the\nirreversible evolution of the electron distribution function, which is nonlocal\nin the wave amplitude and phase velocity. This makes trapping an effective\nmeans of dissipation for the electrostatic energy, and also makes the wave\ndispersion relation nonlocal. Our theory is generalized to allow for stimulated\nRaman scattering, which we address up to saturation by accounting for plasma\ninhomogeneity and non-stationarity, nonlinear kinetic effects, and interspeckle\ncoupling.\n", "  Unified theories of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions which have\nelectric charge quantization predict the existence of topologically stable\nmagnetic monopoles. Intermediate scale monopoles are comparable with detection\nenergies of cosmic ray monopoles at IceCube and other cosmic ray experiments.\nMagnetic monopoles in some models can be significantly lighter and carry two,\nthree or possibly even higher quanta of the Dirac magnetic charge. They could\nbe light enough for their effects to be detected at the LHC either directly or\nindirectly. An example based on a D-brane inspired $SU(3)_C\\times SU(3)_L\\times\nSU(3)_R$ (trinification) model with the monopole carrying three quanta of Dirac\nmagnetic charge is presented. These theories also predict the existence of\ncolor singlet states with fractional electric charge which may be accessible at\nthe LHC.\n", "  The combination Charge Conjugation-Parity-Time Reversal(CPT) is a fundamental\nsymmetry in our current understanding of nature. As such, testing CPT violation\nis a strongly motivated path to explore new physics. In this paper we study CPT\nviolation in the neutrino sector, giving for the first time a bound, for a\nfundamental particle, in the CPT violating particle-antiparticle gravitational\nmass difference. We argue that cosmology is nowadays the only data sensitive to\nCPT violation for the neutrino-antineutrino mass splitting and we use the\nlatest data release from Planck combined with the current\nBaryonic-Acoustic-Oscillation measurement to perform a full cosmological\nanalysis. To show the potential of the future experiments we also show the\nresults for Euclid, a next generation large scale structure experiment.\n", "  Models with extended Higgs sectors can contain several additional Higgs\nstates, heavier or lighter than the SM Higgs boson. The couplings of lighter\nextra states to SM particles can be strongly reduced, leading to small cross\nsections for their direct production. Heavier extra states can have larger\ncouplings to SM particles and, moreover, have large branching fractions into\nlighter extra states, notably into a SM-like Higgs boson accompagnied by\nanother Higgs state which can be lighter or heavier than 125$\\sim$GeV.\nMotivated by corresponding scenarios in the NMSSM we study the prospects for\nthe discovery or exclusion of cascade decays $ggF \\to H_3 \\to H_2 + H_1$ in the\n$b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}$, $b\\bar{b}\\tau\\tau$ and $b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$ final states\nwhere either $H_1$ or $H_2$ can be SM-like. Significant regions of the NMSSM\nparameter space can be tested by these searches. These are, however, not\nconfined to models of the NMSSM type.\n", "  The properties of cold Bose gases at unitarity have been extensively\ninvestigated in the last few years both theoretically and experimentally. In\nthis paper we use a family of interactions tuned to two-body unitarity and very\nweak three-body binding to demonstrate the universal properties of both\nclusters and matter. We determine the universal properties of finite clusters\nup to 60 particles and, for the first time, explicitly demonstrate the\nsaturation of energy and density with particle number and compare with bulk\nproperties. At saturation in the bulk we determine the energy, density, two-\nand three-body contacts and the condensate fraction. We find that uniform\nmatter is more bound than three-body clusters by nearly two orders of\nmagnitude, the two-body contact is very large in absolute terms, and yet the\ncondensate fraction is also very large, greater than 90%. Equilibrium\nproperties of these systems may be experimentally accessible through rapid\nquenching of weakly-interacting boson superfluids.\n", "  Generic resolution of singularities and geodesic completeness in the loop\nquantization of Bianchi-II spacetimes with arbitrary minimally coupled matter\nis investigated. Using the effective Hamiltonian approach, we examine two\navailable quantizations: one based on the connection operator and second by\ntreating extrinsic curvature as connection via gauge fixing. It turns out that\nfor the connection based quantization, either the inverse triad modifications\nor imposition of weak energy condition is necessary to obtain a resolution of\nall strong singularities and geodesic completeness. In contrast, the extrinsic\ncurvature based quantization generically resolves all strong curvature\nsingularities and results in a geodesically complete effective spacetime\nwithout inverse triad modifications or energy conditions. In both the\nquantizations, weak curvature singularities can occur resulting from\ndivergences in pressure and its derivatives at finite densities. These are\nharmless events beyond which geodesics can be extended. Our work generalizes\nprevious results on the generic resolution of strong singularities in the loop\nquantization of isotropic, Bianchi-I and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes.\n", "  In this paper we reconsider the Cachazo-He-Yuan construction (CHY) of the so\ncalled scattering amplitudes at one-loop, in order to obtain quadratic\npropagators. In theories with colour ordering the key ingredient is the\nredefinition of the Parke-Taylor factors. After classifying all the possible\none-loop CHY-integrands we conjecture a new one-loop amplitude for the massless\nBi-adjoint $\\Phi^3$ theory. The prescription directly reproduces the quadratic\npropagators from of the traditional Feynman approach.\n", "  The Inverse Seesaw naturally explains the smallness of neutrino masses via an\napproximate $B-L$ symmetry broken only by a correspondingly small parameter. In\nthis work the possible dynamical generation of the Inverse Seesaw neutrino mass\nmechanism from the spontaneous breaking of a gauged $U(1)$ $B-L$ symmetry is\ninvestigated. Interestingly, the Inverse Seesaw pattern requires a chiral\ncontent such that anomaly cancellation predicts the existence of extra fermions\nbelonging to a dark sector with large, non-trivial, charges under the $U(1)$\n$B-L$. We investigate the phenomenology associated to these new states and find\nthat one of them is a viable dark matter candidate with mass around the TeV\nscale, whose interaction with the Standard Model is mediated by the $Z'$ boson\nassociated to the gauged $U(1)$ $B-L$ symmetry. Given the large charges\nrequired for anomaly cancellation in the dark sector, the $B-L$ $Z'$ interacts\npreferentially with this dark sector rather than with the Standard Model. This\nsuppresses the rate at direct detection searches and thus alleviates the\nconstraints on $Z'$-mediated dark matter relic abundance. The collider\nphenomenology of this elusive $Z'$ is also discussed.\n", "  We consider active particles swimming in a convergent fluid flow in a\ntrapezoid nozzle with no-slip walls. We use mathematical modeling to analyze\ntrajectories of these particles inside the nozzle. By extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we show that trajectories are strongly affected by the background\nfluid flow and geometry of the nozzle leading to wall accumulation and upstream\nmotion (rheotaxis). In particular, we describe the non-trivial focusing of\nactive rods depending on physical and geometrical parameters. It is also\nestablished that the convergent component of the background flow leads to\nstability of both downstream and upstream swimming at the centerline. The\nstability of downstream swimming enhances focusing, and the stability of\nupstream swimming enables rheotaxis in the bulk.\n", "  The recent prediction, and subsequent discovery, of the quantum anomalous\nHall (QAH) effect in thin films of the three-dimensional ferromagnetic\ntopological insulator (MTI) (Cr$_y$Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x-y}$)$_2$Te$_3$ has opened new\npossibilities for chiral-edge-state-based devices in zero external magnetic\nfield. Like the $\\nu=1$ quantum Hall system, the QAH system is predicted to\nhave a single chiral edge mode circulating along the boundary of the film.\nBackscattering of the chiral edge mode should be suppressed, as recently\nverified by the observation of well-quantized Hall resistivities $\\rho_{yx} =\n\\pm h/e^2$, along with longitudinal resistivities as low as a few ohms.\nDissipationless 1D conduction is also expected along magnetic domain walls.\nHere, we intentionally create a magnetic domain wall in a MTI and study\nelectrical transport along the domain wall. We present the first observation of\nchiral transport along domain walls, in agreement with theoretical predictions.\nWe present further evidence that two modes equilibrate and co-propagate along\nthe length of the domain wall.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo method for computing the renormalized coupling\nconstants and the critical exponents within renormalization theory. The scheme,\nwhich derives from a variational principle, overcomes critical slowing down, by\nmeans of a bias potential that renders the coarse grained variables\nuncorrelated. The 2D Ising model is used to illustrate the method.\n", "  Photometric redshift surveys map the distribution of matter in the Universe\nthrough the positions and shapes of galaxies with poorly resolved measurements\nof their radial coordinates. While a tomographic analysis can be used to\nrecover some of the large-scale radial modes present in the data, this approach\nsuffers from a number of practical shortcomings, and the criteria to decide on\na particular binning scheme are commonly blind to the ultimate science goals.\nWe present a method designed to separate and compress the data into a small\nnumber of uncorrelated radial modes, circumventing some of the problems of\nstandard tomographic analyses. The method is based on the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve\ntransform (KL), and is connected to other 3D data compression bases advocated\nin the literature, such as the Fourier-Bessel decomposition. We apply this\nmethod to both weak lensing and galaxy clustering. In the case of galaxy\nclustering, we show that the resulting optimal basis is closely associated with\nthe Fourier-Bessel basis, and that for certain observables, such as the effects\nof magnification bias or primordial non-Gaussianity, the bulk of the signal can\nbe compressed into a small number of modes. In the case of weak lensing we show\nthat the method is able to compress the vast majority of the signal-to-noise\ninto a single mode, and that optimal cosmological constraints can be obtained\nconsidering only three uncorrelated KL eigenmodes, considerably simplifying the\nanalysis with respect to a traditional tomographic approach.\n", "  QCD-like theories can be engineered to remain in a confined phase when\ncompactified on an arbitrarily small circle, where their features may be\nstudied quantitatively in a controlled fashion. Previous work has elucidated\nthe generation of a non-perturbative mass gap and the spontaneous breaking of\nchiral symmetry in this regime. Here, we study the rich spectrum of hadronic\nstates, including glueball, meson, and baryon resonances. We find an\nexponentially growing Hagedorn density of states, as well as the emergence of\nnon-perturbative energy scales given by iterated exponentials of the inverse\nYang-Mills coupling $g^2$.\n", "  Lorentz-violating gravity theories with a preferred foliation can have\ninstantaneous propagation. Nonetheless, it has been shown that black holes can\nstill exist in such theories and the relevant notion of an event horizon has\nbeen dubbed `universal horizon'. In stationary spacetimes the universal horizon\nhas to reside in a region of spacetime where the Killing vector associated with\nstationarity is spacelike. This raises the question of what happens to the\nuniversal horizon in the extremal limit, where no such region exists anymore.\nWe use a decoupling limit approximation to study this problem. Our results\nsuggest that at the extremal limit, the extremal Killing horizon appears to\nplay the role of a degenerate universal horizon, despite being a null and not a\nspacelike surface, and hence not a leaf of the preferred foliation.\n", "  A search for the solar neutrino effective magnetic moment has been performed\nusing data from 1291.5 days exposure during the second phase of the Borexino\nexperiment. No significant deviations from the expected shape of the electron\nrecoil spectrum from solar neutrinos have been found, and a new upper limit on\nthe effective neutrino magnetic moment of $\\mu_{\\nu}^{eff}$ $<$\n2.8$\\cdot$10$^{-11}$ $\\mu_{B}$ at 90\\% c.l. has been set using constraints on\nthe sum of the solar neutrino fluxes implied by the radiochemical gallium\nexperiments.Using the limit for the effective neutrino moment, new limits for\nthe magnetic moments of the neutrino flavor states, and for the elements of the\nneutrino magnetic moments matrix for Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, are derived.\n", "  Stringent relations between the $B^{(*)} \\to D^{(*)} $ form factors exist in\nthe heavy quark limit and the leading symmetry breaking corrections are known.\nWe reconsider their uncertainty and role in the analysis of recent Belle data\nfor $B\\to D^{(*)}\\ell\\nu$ with model-independent parametrizations and in the\nrelated prediction of $R(D^{(*)})$. We find $|V_{cb}|=41.5(1.3) \\ 10^{-3}$ and\n$|V_{cb}|=40.6(^{+1.2}_{-1.3}) \\ 10^{-3}$ using input from Light Cone Sum\nRules, and $R(D^{*})=0.260(8)$.\n", "  We report experimental and theoretical results on spatiotemporal pattern\nformation in cell populations, where the parameters vary in space and time due\nto mechanisms intrinsic to the system, namely Dictyostelium discoideum (D.d.)\nin the starvation phase. We find that different patterns are formed when the\npopulations are initialized at different developmental stages, or, when\npopulations at different initial developmental stages are mixed. The\nexperimentally observed patterns can be understood with a modified\nKessler-Levine model that takes into account the initial spatial heterogeneity\nof the cell populations and a developmental path introduced by us, i.e., the\ntime dependence of the various biochemical parameters. The dynamics of the\nparameter agree with known biochemical studies. Most importantly the modified\nmodel reproduces not only our results, but also the observations of an\nindependent experiment published earlier. This shows that pattern formation can\nbe used to understand and quantify the temporal evolution of the system\nparameters.\n", "  We propose an effective anisotropic fluid description for a generic\ninfrared-modified theory of gravity. In our framework, the additional component\nof the acceleration, commonly attributed to dark matter, is explained as a\nradial pressure generated by the reaction of the dark energy fluid to the\npresence of baryonic matter. Using quite general assumptions, and a microscopic\ndescription of the fluid in terms of a Bose-Einstein condensate of gravitons,\nwe find the static, spherically symmetric solution for the metric in terms of\nthe Misner-Sharp mass function and the fluid pressure. At galactic scales, we\ncorrectly reproduce the leading MOND-like $\\log(r)$ and subleading\n$(1/r)\\,\\log(r)$ terms in the weak-field expansion of the potential. Our\ndescription also predicts a tiny (of order $10^{-6}$ for a typical spiral\ngalaxy) Machian modification of the Newtonian potential at galactic scales,\nwhich is controlled by the cosmological acceleration.\n", "  The angular distributions of lepton pairs in the Drell-Yan process can\nprovide rich information on the underlying QCD production mechanisms. These\ndynamics can be parameterised in terms of a set of frame dependent angular\ncoefficients, $A_{i=0,\\ldots,7}$, which depend on the invariant mass,\ntransverse momentum, and rapidity of the lepton pair. Motivated by recent\nmeasurements of these coefficients by ATLAS and CMS, and in particular by the\napparent violation of the Lam-Tung relation $A_0-A_2=0$, we perform a precision\nstudy of the angular coefficients at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)$ in perturbative\nQCD. We make predictions relevant for $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV,\nand perform comparisons with the available ATLAS and CMS data as well as\nproviding predictions for a prospective measurement at LHCb. To expose the\nviolation of the Lam-Tung relationship we propose a new observable\n$\\Delta^\\mathrm{LT} = 1-A_2/A_0$ that is more sensitive to the dynamics in the\nregion where $A_0$ and $A_2$ are both small. We find that the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)$ corrections have an important impact on the $p_{T,Z}$\ndistributions for several of the angular coefficients, and are essential to\nprovide an adequate description of the data. The compatibility of the available\nATLAS and CMS data is reassessed by performing a partial $\\chi^2$ test with\nrespect to the central theoretical prediction which shows that\n$\\chi^2/N_\\mathrm{data}$ is significantly reduced by going from\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)$.\n", "  We present a force-biased Monte Carlo (FMC) method for structural modeling of\ntransition metal clusters of Fe, Ni, and Cu with 5 to 60 atoms. By employing\nthe Finnis-Sinclair potential for Fe and the Sutton-Chen potential for Ni and\nCu, the total energy of the clusters is minimized using a method that utilizes\natomic forces in Monte Carlo simulations. The structural configurations of the\nclusters obtained from this biased Monte Carlo approach are analyzed and\ncompared with the same from the Cambridge Cluster Database (CCD). The results\nshow that the total-energy of the FMC clusters is very close to the\ncorresponding value of the CCD clusters as listed in the Cambridge Cluster\nDatabase. A comparison of the FMC and CCD clusters is presented by computing\nthe pair-correlation function, the bond-angle distribution, and the\ndistribution of atomic-coordination numbers in the first-coordination shell,\nwhich provide information about the two-body and three-body correlation\nfunctions, the local atomic structure, and the bonding environment of the atoms\nin the clusters.\n", "  High intensity monoenergetic muon neutrinos of energy 236 MeV from kaon decay\nat rest (KDAR) at the medium energy proton accelerator facilities like J-PARC\nand Fermilab are proposed to be used for making precision measurements of\nneutrino-nucleus cross sections in $^{12}C$ and $^{40}Ar$ and perform neutrino\noscillation experiments in $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ modes.\nIn view of these developments, we study the theoretical uncertainties arising\ndue to the nuclear medium effects in the neutrino-nucleus cross sections as\nwell as in the angular and energy distributions of the charged leptons produced\nin the charged current (CC) induced reactions by $\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_e$ in\n$^{12}C$ and $^{40}Ar$ in the energy region of $E_{\\nu_e(\\nu_\\mu)}<$ 300 MeV.\nThe calculations have been done in a microscopic model using the local density\napproximation which takes into account the nuclear effects due to the Fermi\nmotion, binding energy and long range correlations. The results are compared\nwith the other calculations available in the literature.\n", "  We expand the Bethe/Gauge dictionary between the XXX Heisenberg spin chain\nand 2d N = (2,2) supersymmetric gauge theories to include aspects of the\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz. We construct the wave functions of off-shell Bethe\nstates as orbifold defects in the A-twisted supersymmetric gauge theory and\nstudy their correlation functions. We also present an alternative description\nof off-shell Bethe states as boundary conditions in an effective N = 4\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we interpret spin chain R-matrices\nas correlation functions of Janus interfaces for mass parameters in the\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics.\n", "  We analyze ground state (GS) factorization in general arrays of spins $s_i$\nwith $XXZ$ couplings immersed in nonuniform fields. It is shown that an\nexceptionally degenerate set of completely separable symmetry-breaking GS's can\narise for a wide range of field configurations, at a quantum critical point\nwhere all GS magnetization plateaus merge. Such configurations include\nalternating fields as well as zero bulk field solutions with edge fields only\nand intermediate solutions with zero field at specific sites, valid for\n$d$-dimensional arrays. The definite magnetization projected GS's at\nfactorization can be analytically determined and depend only on the exchange\nanisotropies, exhibiting critical entanglement properties. We also show that\nsome factorization compatible field configurations may result in field-induced\nfrustration and nontrivial behavior at strong fields.\n", "  We present the peculiar in-plane velocities derived from the LAMOST red clump\nstars, which are purified and separated by a novel approach into two groups\nwith different ages. The samples are mostly contributed around the Galactic\nanti-centre direction such that we are able to map the radial profiles of the\nradial and azimuthal velocities in the outer disc. From the variations of the\nin-plane velocities with the Galactocentric radius for the younger and older\npopulations, we find that both radial and azimuthal velocities are not\naxisymmetric at $8<R<14\\,kpc$. The two red clump populations show that the mean\nradial velocity is negative within $R\\sim9\\,kpc$ and positive beyond. This is\nlikely because of the perturbation induced by the rotating bar. The cross-zero\nradius, $R\\sim9$\\, kpc, essentially indicates the rough location of the outer\nLindblad resonance (OLR) radius. Given the circular speed of 238\\,km$\\rm\ns^{-1}$, then the pattern speed of the bar can be approximated as $45$\\,km$\\rm\ns^{-1}\\rm kpc^{-1}$. The young red clump stars show larger mean radial velocity\nthan the old population by about 3$\\,km\\rm s^{-1}$ between $R\\sim9$ and\n12\\,kpc. This is possibly because the younger population is more sensitive to\nthe perturbation than the older one. The radial profiles of the mean azimuthal\nvelocity for the two populations show an interesting U-shape, i.e. at\n$R<10.5\\,kpc$, the azimuthal velocity declines with $R$ by about 10$\\,km\\rm\ns^{-1}$, while at $R>10.5$ it increases with $R$ to 240-245$\\,km\\rm s^{-1}$. It\nis not clear why the mean azimuthal velocity shows the U-shape along the\nGalactic anti-centre direction. Meanwhile, the azimuthal velocity for the\nyounger population is slightly larger than the older one and the difference\nmoderately declines with $R$. Beyond $R\\sim12\\,kpc$, the azimuthal velocities\nfor the two populations are indistinguishable.\n", "  We study the surface brightness fluctuations of the cosmic X-ray background\n(CXB) using Chandra data of XBOOTES. After masking out resolved sources we\ncompute the power spectrum of fluctuations of the unresolved CXB for angular\nscales from ~2 arcsec to ~3 deg. The non-trivial large-scale structure (LSS)\nsignal dominates over the shot-noise of unresolved point sources at all scales\nabove ~1 arcmin and is produced mainly by the intracluster medium (ICM) of\nunresolved clusters and groups of galaxies, as shown in our previous\npublication.\n  The shot-noise-subtracted power spectrum of CXB fluctuations has a power-law\nshape with the slope of $\\Gamma = 0.96 \\pm 0.06$. Its energy spectrum is well\ndescribed by the redshifted emission spectrum of optically-thin plasma with the\nbest-fit temperature of $T \\approx 1.3$ keV and the best-fit redshift of $z\n\\approx 0.40$. They are in good agreement with theoretical expectations based\non the X-ray luminosity function and scaling relations of clusters. From these\nvalues we estimate the typical mass and luminosity of the objects responsible\nfor CXB fluctuations, $M_{500} \\sim 10^{13.6}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}/h$ and\n$L_{0.5-2.0\\,{\\rm keV}} \\sim 10^{42.5}$ erg/s. On the other hand, the\nflux-weighted mean temperature and redshift of resolved clusters are $T \\approx\n2.4$ keV and $z \\approx 0.23$, confirming that fluctuations of unresolved CXB\nare caused by cooler (i.e. less massive) and more distant clusters, as\nexpected. We show that the power spectrum shape is sensitive to the ICM\nstructure all the way to the outskirts, out to $\\sim{\\rm few}\\times R_{500}$.\nWe also look for possible contribution of the warm-hot intergalactic medium\n(WHIM) to the observed CXB fluctuations.\n  Our results underline the significant diagnostics potential of the CXB\nfluctuation analysis in studying the ICM structure in clusters.\n", "  Predictions for our ability to distinguish quark and gluon jets vary by more\nthan a factor of two between different parton showers. We study this problem\nusing analytic resummed predictions for the thrust event shape up to NNLL'\nusing $e^+e^- \\to Z \\to q \\bar q$ and $e^+e^- \\to H \\to gg$ as proxies for\nquark and gluon jets. We account for hadronization effects through a\nnonperturbative shape function, and include an estimate of both perturbative\nand hadronization uncertainties. In contrast to previous studies, we find\nreasonable agreement between our results and predictions from both Pythia and\nHerwig parton showers. We find that this is due to a noticeable improvement in\nthe description of gluon jets in the newest Herwig 7.1 compared to previous\nversions.\n", "  The delta-shell representation of the nuclear force allows a simplified\ntreatment of nuclear correlations. We show how this applies to the\nBethe-Goldstone equation as an integral equation in coordinate space with a few\nmesh points, which is solved by inversion of a 5-dimensional square matrix in\nthe single channel cases and a $10\\times10$ matrix for the tensor-coupled\nchannels. This allows us to readily obtain the high momentum distribution, for\nall partial waves, of a back-to-back correlated nucleon pair in nuclear matter.\nWe find that the probability of finding a high-momentum correlated\nneutron-proton pair is about 18 times that of a proton-proton one, as a result\nof the strong tensor force, thus confirming in an independent way previous\nresults and measurements.\n", "  We show that discrete-time quantum walks on the line, $\\mathbb{Z}$, behave as\n\"the quantum tunneling\". In particular, quantum walkers can tunnel through a\ndouble-well with the transmission probability $1$ under a mild condition. This\nis a property of quantum walks which cannot be seen on classical random walks,\nand is different from both linear spreadings and localizations.\n", "  We study inequivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles in the\nmean-field Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. This generalizes previous results\nobtained for the Blume-Capel model. The phase diagram strongly depends on the\nvalue of the biquadratic exchange interaction K, the additional feature present\nin the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model. At small values of K, as for the\nBlume-Capel model, lines of first and second order phase transitions between a\nferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase are present, separated by a tricritical\npoint whose location is different in the two ensembles. At higher values of K\nthe phase diagram changes substantially, with the appearance of a triple point\nin the canonical ensemble which does not find any correspondence in the\nmicrocanonical ensemble. Moreover, one of the first order lines that starts\nfrom the triple point ends in a critical point, whose position in the phase\ndiagram is different in the two ensembles. This line separates two paramagnetic\nphases characterized by a different value of the quadrupole moment. These\nfeatures were not previously studied for other models and substantially enrich\nthe landscape of ensemble inequivalence, identifying new aspects that had been\ndiscussed in a classification of phase transitions based on singularity theory.\nFinally, we discuss ergodicity breaking, which is highlighted by the presence\nof gaps in the accessible values of magnetization at low energies: it also\ndisplays new interesting patterns that are not present in the Blume-Capel\nmodel.\n", "  Biadjoint scalar field theories are increasingly important in the study of\nscattering amplitudes in various string and field theories. Recently, some\nfirst exact nonperturbative solutions of biadjoint scalar theory were\npresented, with a pure power-like form corresponding to isolated monopole-like\nobjects located at the origin of space. In this paper, we find a novel family\nof extended solutions, involving non-trivial form factors that partially screen\nthe divergent field at the origin. All previous solutions emerge as special\ncases.\n", "  In this work, we predict a novel band structure for Carbon-Lithium(C4Li)\ncompound using the first-principles method. We show that it exhibits two Dirac\npoints near the Fermi level; one located at W point originating from the\nnonsymmophic symmetry of the compound, and the other one behaves like a type-II\nDirac cone with higher anisotropy along the {\\Gamma} to X line. The obtained\nFermi surface sheets of the hole-pocket and the electron-pocket near the\ntype-II Dirac cone are separated from each other, and they would touch each\nother when the Fermi level is doped to cross the type-II Dirac cone. The\nevolution of Fermi surface with doping is also discussed. The bands crossing\nfrom T to W make a line-node at the intersection of kx={\\pi} and ky={\\pi}\nmirror planes. The C4Li is a novel material with both nonsymmorphic protected\nDirac cone and type-II Dirac cone near the Fermi level which may exhibit\nexceptional topological property for electronic applications.\n", "  Quasilinear turbulent transport models are a successful tool for prediction\nof core tokamak plasma profiles in many regimes. Their success hinges on the\nreproduction of local nonlinear gyrokinetic fluxes. We focus on significant\nprogress in the quasilinear gyrokinetic transport model QuaLiKiz [C. Bourdelle\net al. 2016 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 58 014036], which employs an\napproximated solution of the mode structures to significantly speed up\ncomputation time compared to full linear gyrokinetic solvers. Optimization of\nthe dispersion relation solution algorithm within integrated modelling\napplications leads to flux calculations $\\times10^{6-7}$ faster than local\nnonlinear simulations. This allows tractable simulation of flux-driven dynamic\nprofile evolution including all transport channels: ion and electron heat, main\nparticles, impurities, and momentum. Furthermore, QuaLiKiz now includes the\nimpact of rotation and temperature anisotropy induced poloidal asymmetry on\nheavy impurity transport, important for W-transport applications. Application\nwithin the JETTO integrated modelling code results in 1s of JET plasma\nsimulation within 10 hours using 10 CPUs. Simultaneous predictions of core\ndensity, temperature, and toroidal rotation profiles for both JET hybrid and\nbaseline experiments are presented, covering both ion and electron turbulence\nscales. The simulations are successfully compared to measured profiles, with\nagreement mostly in the 5-25% range according to standard figures of merit.\n", "  Ultrafast laser excitation of a metal causes correlated, highly\nnonequilibrium dynamics of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom, which are\nhowever only poorly captured by the widely-used two-temperature model. Here we\ndevelop an out-of-equilibrium theory that captures the full dynamic evolution\nof the electronic and phononic populations and provides a microscopic\ndescription of the transfer of energy delivered optically into electrons to the\nlattice. All essential nonequilibrium energy processes, such as electron-phonon\nand phonon-phonon interactions are taken into account. Moreover, as all\nrequired quantities are obtained from first-principles calculations, the model\ngives an exact description of the relaxation dynamics without the need for\nfitted parameters. We apply the model to FePt and show that the detailed\nrelaxation is out-of-equilibrium for picoseconds.\n", "  Where collider searches for resonant invisible particles loose steam, dark\nsectors might leave their trace as virtual effects in precision observables.\nHere we explore this option in the framework of Higgs portal models, where a\nsector of dark fermions interacts with the standard model through a strong\nrenormalizable coupling to the Higgs boson. We show that precise measurements\nof Higgs-gauge and triple Higgs interactions can probe dark fermions up to the\nTeV scale through virtual corrections. Observation prospects at the LHC and\nfuture lepton colliders are discussed for the so-called singlet-doublet model\nof Majorana fermions, a generalization of the bino-higgsino scenario in\nsupersymmetry. We advocate a two-fold search strategy for dark sectors through\ndirect and indirect observables.\n", "  Hyper-Kamiokande, the next generation large water Cherenkov detector in\nJapan, is planning to use approximately 80,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes\n(PMTs). They are one of the major cost factors of the experiment. We propose a\nnovel enhanced photon trap design based on a smaller and more economical PMT in\ncombination with wavelength shifters, dichroic mirrors, and broadband mirrors.\nGEANT4 is utilized to obtain photon collection efficiencies and timing\nresolution of the photon traps. We compare the performance of different trap\nconfigurations and sizes. Our simulations indicate an enhanced photon trap with\na 12-inch PMT can match a 20-inch PMTs collection efficiency, however at a cost\nof reduced timing resolution. The photon trap might be suitable as detection\nmodule for the outer detector with large photo coverage area.\n", "  Within a phenomenological holographic model in $(4+1)$-bulk dimensions,\ndefined by Einstein-gravity with a negative cosmological constant, coupled to a\nDirac-Born-Infeld and a Chern-Simons term, we explore the fate of BF-bound\nviolation for a probe scalar field and a fluctuation mode of the corresponding\ngeometry. We assume this simple model to capture the dynamics of a strongly\ncoupled SU$(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f$ fundamental matter, which in the\nlimit ${\\cal O} \\left( N_c \\right) \\sim {\\cal O}\\left(N_f\\right)$ and with a\nnon-vanishing matter density, is holographically described by an\nAdS$_2$-geometry in the IR. We demonstrate that, superconductor/superfluid\ninstabilities are facilitated and spontaneous breaking of translational\ninvariance is inhibited with increasing values of $\\left(N_f / N_c \\right) $.\nThis is similar, in spirit, with known results in large $N_c$ Quantum\nChromodynamics with $N_f$ quarks and a non-vanishing density, in which the\nchiral density wave phase becomes suppressed and superconducting instabilities\nbecome favoured as the number of quarks is increased.\n", "  We investigate the relative importance of initial and final state effects on\nazimuthal correlations of gluons in low and high multiplicity p+Pb collisions.\nTo achieve this, we couple Yang-Mills dynamics of pre-equilibrium gluon fields\n(IP-GLASMA) to a perturbative QCD based parton cascade for the final state\nevolution (BAMPS) on an event-by-event basis. We find that signatures of both\nthe initial state correlations and final state interactions are seen in\nazimuthal correlation observables, such as\n$v_2\\left\\lbrace2PC\\right\\rbrace(p_T)$, their strength depending on the event\nmultiplicity and transverse momentum. Initial state correlations dominate\n$v_2\\left\\lbrace2PC\\right\\rbrace(p_T)$ in low multiplicity events for\ntransverse momenta $p_T>2~{\\rm GeV}$. While final state interactions are\ndominant in high multiplicity events, initial state correlations affect\n$v_2\\left\\lbrace2PC\\right\\rbrace(p_T)$ for $p_T>2~{\\rm GeV}$ as well as the pT\nintegrated $v_2\\left\\lbrace2PC\\right\\rbrace$.\n", "  We have compiled a set of electron-impact multiple ionization (EIMI) cross\nsections for astrophysically relevant ions. EIMI can have a significant effect\non the ionization balance of non-equilibrium plasmas. For example, it can be\nimportant if there is a rapid change in the electron temperature or if there is\na non-thermal electron energy distribution, such as a kappa distribution. Cross\nsections for EIMI are needed in order to account for these processes in plasma\nmodeling and for spectroscopic interpretation. Here, we describe our comparison\nof proposed semiempirical formulae to the available experimental EIMI cross\nsection data. Based on this comparison, we have interpolated and extrapolated\nfitting parameters to systems that have not yet been measured. A tabulation of\nthe fit parameters is provided for 3466 EIMI cross sections. We also highlight\nsome outstanding issues that remain to be resolved.\n", "  We examine the large $N$ 1/4-BPS spectrum of the symmetric orbifold CFT\nSym$^N(M)$ deformed to the supergravity point in moduli space for $M= K3$ and\n$T^4$. We consider refinement under both left- and right-moving $SU(2)_R$\nsymmetries of the superconformal algebra, and decompose the spectrum into\ncharacters of the algebra. We find that at large $N$ the character\ndecomposition satisfies an unusual property, in which the degeneracy only\ndepends on a certain linear combination of left- and right-moving quantum\nnumbers, suggesting deeper symmetry structure. Furthermore, we consider the\naction of discrete symmetry groups on these degeneracies, where certain\nsubgroups of the Conway group are known to play a role. We also comment on the\npotential for larger discrete symmetry groups to appear in the large $N$ limit.\n", "  There is significant evidence suggesting that continuous global symmetries\nare always gauged in quantum gravity. However, very weakly gauged symmetries\nseem global to an effective field theory expansion in powers of Newton's\nconstant. We show that, at least for Einsteinian quantum gravity on AdS, such\nextremely weak gaugings are indeed in the Swampland: Consistency with AdS black\nhole thermodynamics requires the bulk gauge coupling $g^2$ not to vanish faster\nthan $\\sim\\exp(\\ell^{d-1}/G)$, where $\\ell$ is the $AdS_{d+1}$ radius and $G$\nis Newton's constant as we take the $G\\rightarrow0$ limit. This translates to a\nconstraint in the dual large $N$ CFT, namely, that the two-point function\ncoefficient of the current $C_J$ cannot grow faster than $\\exp(N^2)$ in the\nlarge $N$ limit. We also recover a previously known logarithmic relationship\nbetween the cutoff of the effective field theory in AdS, Planck's mass, and the\nAdS radius.\n", "  The extended Schmidt law (ESL) is a variant of the Schmidt law which relates\nthe surface densities of gas and star formation, with the surface density of\nstellar mass added as an extra parameter. We empirically investigate for the\nfirst time whether low metallicity faint dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs)\nfollow the ESL. Here we consider the `global' law where surface densities are\naveraged over the galactic discs. dIrrs are unique not only because they are at\nthe lowest end of mass and star formation scales for galaxies, but also because\nthey are metal-poor compared to the general population of galaxies. Our sample\nis drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) which is the\nlargest survey of atomic hydrogen in such galaxies. The gas surface densities\nare determined using their atomic hydrogen content. The star formation rates\nare calculated using GALEX far ultraviolet fluxes after correcting for dust\nextinction, whereas the stellar surface densities are calculated using Spitzer\n3.6 $\\mu$m fluxes. All surface densities are calculated over stellar discs\ndefined by the 3.6 $\\mu$m images. We find dIrrs indeed follow the extended\nSchmidt law. The mean deviation of the FIGGS galaxies from the relation is 0.01\ndex, with a scatter around the relation of less than half that seen in the\noriginal relation. In comparison, we also show that the FIGGS galaxies are much\nmore deviant when compared to the `canonical' Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Our\nresults help strengthen the universality of the extended Schmidt law,\nespecially for galaxies with low metallicities. We suggest that models of star\nformation in which feedback from previous generations of stars set the pressure\nin the ISM, are promising candidates for explaining the ESL. We also confirm\nthat ESL is an independent relation and not a form of a relation between star\nformation efficiency and metallicity.\n", "  Driven lattice gases are widely regarded as the paradigm of collective\nphenomena out of equilibrium. While such models are usually studied with\nnearest-neighbor interactions, many empirical driven systems are dominated by\nslowly decaying interactions such as dipole-dipole and Van der Waals forces.\nMotivated by this gap, we study the non-equilibrium stationary state of a\ndriven lattice gas with slow-decayed repulsive interactions at zero\ntemperature. By numerical and analytical calculations of the particle current\nas a function of the density and of the driving field, we identify (i) an\nabrupt breakdown transition between insulating and conducting states, (ii)\ncurrent quantization into discrete phases where a finite current flows with\ninfinite differential resistivity, and (iii) a fractal hierarchy of\nexcitations, related to the Farey sequences of number theory. We argue that the\norigin of these effects is the competition between scales, which also causes\nthe counterintuitive phenomenon that crystalline states can melt by increasing\nthe density.\n", "  Employing a Mathematica symbolic computer algebra package called xTensor, we\npresent $(1+3)$-covariant special case proofs of the shear-free perfect fluid\nconjecture in General Relativity. We first present the case where the pressure\nis constant, and where the acceleration is parallel to the vorticity vector.\nThese cases were first presented in their covariant form by Senovilla et. al.\nWe then provide a covariant proof for the case where the acceleration and\nvorticity vectors are orthogonal, which leads to the existence of a Killing\nvector along the vorticity. This Killing vector satisfies the new constraint\nequations resulting from the vanishing of the shear. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat in order for the conjecture to be true, this Killing vector must have a\nvanishing spatially projected directional covariant derivative along the\nvelocity vector field. This in turn implies the existence of another\n\\textit{basic} vector field along the direction of the vorticity for the\nconjecture to hold. Finally, we show that in general, there exist a\n\\textit{basic} vector field parallel to the acceleration for which the\nconjecture is true.\n", "  When electrodes are biased above the plasma potential, electrons accelerated\nthrough the associated electron sheath can dramatically increase the ionization\nrate of neutrals near the electrode surface. It has previously been observed\nthat if the ionization rate is great enough, a double layer separates a\nluminous high-potential plasma attached to the electrode surface (called an\nanode spot or fireball) from the bulk plasma. Here, results of the first 2D\nparticle-in-cell simulations of anode spot formation are presented along with a\ntheoretical model describing the formation process. It is found that ionization\nleads to the buildup of an ion-rich layer adjacent to the electrode, forming a\nnarrow potential well near the electrode surface that traps electrons born from\nionization. Anode spot onset occurs when a quasineutral region is established\nin the potential well and the density in this region becomes large enough to\nviolate the steady-state Langmuir condition, which is a balance between\nelectron and ion fluxes across the double layer. A model for steady-state\nproperties of the anode spot is also presented, which predicts values for the\nanode spot size, double layer potential drop, and form of the sheath at the\nelectrode by considering particle, power, and current balance. These\npredictions are found to be consistent with the presented simulation and\nprevious experiments.\n", "  We derive and implement a new way of solving coupled cluster equations with\nlower computational scaling. Our method is based on decomposition of both\namplitudes and two electron integrals, using a combination of tensor\nhypercontraction and canonical polyadic decomposition. While the original\ntheory scales as $O(N^6)$ with respect to the number of basis functions, we\ndemonstrate numerically that we achieve sub-millihartree difference from the\noriginal theory with $O(N^4)$ scaling. This is accomplished by solving directly\nfor the factors that decompose the cluster operator. The proposed scheme is\nquite general and can be easily extended to other many-body methods.\n", "  Pressure-induced polarization switching in ferroelectric thin films has\nemerged as a powerful method for domain patterning, allowing to create\npredefined domain patterns on free surfaces and under thin conductive top\nelectrodes. However, the mechanisms for pressure induced polarization switching\nin ferroelectrics remain highly controversial, with flexoelectricity,\npolarization rotation and suppression, and bulk and surface electrochemical\nprocesses all being potentially relevant. Here we classify possible pressure\ninduced switching mechanisms, perform elementary estimates, and study in depth\nusing phase-field modelling. We show that magnitudes of these effects are\nremarkably close, and give rise to complex switching diagrams as a function of\npressure and film thickness with non-trivial topology or switchable and\nnon-switchable regions.\n", "  We showed in previous work that for homogeneous Yang-Baxter (YB) deformations\nof AdS$_5\\times$S$^5$, the open string metric and coupling, and as a result the\nclosed string density $e^{-2 \\Phi} \\sqrt{g}$, remain undeformed. In this work,\nin addition to extending these results to the deformation associated with the\nmodified CYBE, or $\\eta$-deformation, we identify the Page forms as the open\nstring counterpart for RR fields and demonstrate case by case that the non-zero\nPage forms remain invariant under YB deformations. We give a physical meaning\nto the Killing vector $I$ of generalized supergravity and show for all YB\ndeformations: 1) $I$ appears as a current for center of mass motion on the\nworldvolume of a D-branes probing the background, 2) $I$ is equal to the\ndivergence of the noncommutativity parameter, 3) $I$ exhibits \"holographic\"\nbehavior, where the radial component of $I$ vanishes at the AdS boundary, and\n4) in pure spinor formalism $I$ is related to a certain state in the BRST\ncohomology.\n", "  We consider arbitrary stationary and axisymmetric black holes in general\nrelativity in $(d +1)$ dimensions (with $d \\geq 3$) that satisfy the vacuum\nEinstein equation and have a non-degenerate horizon. We prove that the\ncanonical energy of axisymmetric electromagnetic perturbations is positive\ndefinite. This establishes that all vacuum black holes are stable to\naxisymmetric electromagnetic perturbations. Our results also hold for\nasymptotically deSitter black holes that satisfy the vacuum Einstein equation\nwith a positive cosmological constant. Our results also apply to extremal black\nholes provided that the initial perturbation vanishes in a neighborhood of the\nhorizon.\n", "  We have recently studied a simplified version of the path integral for a\nparticle on a sphere, and more generally on maximally symmetric spaces, and\nproved that Riemann normal coordinates allow the use of a quadratic kinetic\nterm in the particle action. The emerging linear sigma model contains a scalar\neffective potential that reproduces the effects of the curvature. We present\nhere further details on the construction, and extend its perturbative\nevaluation to orders high enough to read off the type-A trace anomalies of a\nconformal scalar in dimensions d = 14 and d = 16.\n", "  In the organic charge transfer salt k-(BETS)2Mn[N(CN)2]3 the metallic\nconductivity is provided by itinerant pi-electrons in the layers of BETS\nmolecules, whereas magnetization is largely dominated by the localized\nd-electrons of the Mn2+ ions in the insulating anionic layers. We study\nmagnetic properties of the compound in its low-temperature, Mott-insulating\nstate by means of magnetic torque technique. The complex behavior of the torque\ncan be qualitatively explained by the coexistence of two weakly interacting\nmagnetic subsystems associated with paramagnetic d-electron spins and\nantiferromagnetically ordered pi-electron spins, respectively. Based on the\nexperimental data, we determine the principal axes of magnetization of the Mn2+\nsublattice and propose a qualitative model for the pi-electron spin\narrangement, implying an important role of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction.\n", "  Ejection velocity fields of asteroid families are largely unconstrained due\nto the fact that members disperse relatively quickly on Myr time-scales by\nsecular resonances and the Yarkovsky effect. The spreading of fragments in $a$\nby the Yarkovsky effect is indistinguishable from the spreading caused by the\ninitial ejection of fragments. By examining families $<$20 Myrs-old, we can use\nthe V-shape identification technique to separate family shapes that are due to\nthe initial ejection velocity field and those that are due to the Yarkovsky\neffect. $<$20 Myr-old asteroid families provide an opportunity to study the\nvelocity field of family fragments before they become too dispersed. Only the\nKarin family's initial velocity field has been determined and scales inversely\nwith diameter, $D^{-1}$. We have applied the V-shape identification technique\nto constrain young families' initial ejection velocity fields by measuring the\ncurvature of their fragments' V-shape correlation in semi-major axis, $a$, vs.\n$D^{-1}$ space. Curvature from a straight line implies a deviation from a\nscaling of $D^{-1}$. We measure the V-shape curvature of 11 young asteroid\nfamilies including the \\FYnospace, Aeolia, Brangane, Brasilia, Clarissa,\nIannini, Karin, Konig, Koronis(2), Theobalda and Veritas asteroid families. We\nfind that the majority of asteroid families have initial ejection velocity\nfields consistent with $\\sim D^{-1}$ supporting laboratory impact experiments\nand computer simulations of disrupting asteroid parent bodies.\n", "  The Complex Kohn variational method for electron-polyatomic molecule\nscattering is formulated using an overset grid representation of the scattering\nwave function. The overset grid consists of a central grid and multiple dense,\natom-centered subgrids that allow the simultaneous spherical expansions of the\nwave function about multiple centers. Scattering boundary conditions are\nenforced by using a basis formed by the repeated application of the free\nparticle Green's function and potential, $\\hat{G}^+_0\\hat{V}$ on the overset\ngrid in a \"Born-Arnoldi\" solution of the working equations. The theory is shown\nto be equivalent to a specific Pad\\'e approximant to the $T$-matrix, and has\nrapid convergence properties, both in the number of numerical basis functions\nemployed and the number of partial waves employed in the spherical expansions.\nThe method is demonstrated in calculations on methane and CF$_4$ in the\nstatic-exchange approximation, and compared in detail with calculations\nperformed with the numerical Schwinger variational approach based on single\ncenter expansions. An efficient procedure for operating with the free-particle\nGreen's function and exchange operators (to which no approximation is made) is\nalso described.\n", "  We study the small mass limit (or: the Smoluchowski-Kramers limit) of a class\nof quantum Brownian motions with inhomogeneous damping and diffusion. For Ohmic\nbath spectral density with a Lorentz-Drude cutoff, we derive the\nHeisenberg-Langevin equations for the particle's observables using a quantum\nstochastic calculus approach. We set the mass of the particle to equal $m =\nm_{0} \\epsilon$, the reduced Planck constant to equal $\\hbar = \\epsilon$ and\nthe cutoff frequency to equal $\\Lambda = E_{\\Lambda}/\\epsilon$, where $m_0$ and\n$E_{\\Lambda}$ are positive constants, so that the particle's de Broglie\nwavelength and the largest energy scale of the bath are fixed as $\\epsilon \\to\n0$. We study the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ of the rescaled model and derive a\nlimiting equation for the (slow) particle's position variable. We find that the\nlimiting equation contains several drift correction terms, the quantum\nnoise-induced drifts, including terms of purely quantum nature, with no\nclassical counterparts.\n", "  We present a detailed mapping of the dominant kinematical domains\ncontributing to the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux at high neutrino energies\nby studying its sensitivity to the cuts on several kinematical variables\ncrucial for charm production in cosmic ray scattering in the atmosphere. This\nincludes the maximal center-of-mass energy for proton-proton scattering, the\nlongitudinal momentum fractions of partons in the projectile (cosmic ray) and\ntarget (nucleus of the atmosphere), the Feynman $x_F$ variable and the\ntransverse momentum of charm quark/antiquark. We find that the production of\nneutrinos with energies larger than $E_{\\nu} >$ 10$^7$ GeV is particularly\nsensitive to the center-of-mass energies larger than the ones at the LHC and to\nthe longitudinal momentum fractions in the projectile 10$^{-8}$ $< x <$\n10$^{-5}$. Clearly, these are regions where we do not control the parton, in\nparticular gluon, densities. We also analyse the characteristic theoretical\nuncertainties in the charm production cross section coming from its QCD\nmodelling. The precision data on the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux can\nefficiently constrain the mechanism of heavy quark production and underlying\nQCD dynamics in kinematical ranges beyond the reach of the current collider\nmeasurements.\n", "  We present the projected Rayleigh statistic (PRS), a modification of the\nclassic Rayleigh statistic, as a test for non-uniform relative orientation\nbetween two pseudo-vector fields. In the application here this gives an\neffective way of investigating whether polarization pseudo-vectors (spin-2\nquantities) are preferentially parallel or perpendicular to filaments in the\ninterstellar medium. For example, there are other potential applications in\nastrophysics, e.g., when comparing small-scale orientations with larger-scale\nshear patterns. We compare the efficiency of the PRS against histogram binning\nmethods that have previously been used for characterising the relative\norientations of gas column density structures with the magnetic field projected\non the plane of the sky. We examine data for the Vela C molecular cloud, where\nthe column density is inferred from Herschel submillimetre observations, and\nthe magnetic field from observations by the Balloon-borne Large-Aperture\nSubmillimetre Telescope in the 250-, 350-, and 500-{\\mu}m wavelength bands. We\nfind that the PRS has greater statistical power than approaches that bin the\nrelative orientation angles, as it makes more efficient use of the information\ncontained in the data. In particular, the use of the PRS to test for\npreferential alignment results in a higher statistical significance, in each of\nthe four Vela C regions, with the greatest increase being by a factor 1.3 in\nthe South-Nest region in the 250-{\\mu}m band.\n", "  We present the computation of energy-energy correlation in $e^+e^-$\ncollisions in the back-to-back region at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic\naccuracy matched with the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative\nprediction. We study the effect of the fixed higher order corrections in a\ncomparison of our results to LEP and SLC data. The next-to-next-to-leading\norder correction has a sizable impact on the extracted value of\n$\\alpha_{\\mathrm S}(M_Z)$, hence its inclusion is mandatory for a precise\nmeasurement of the strong coupling using energy-energy correlation.\n", "  Nine transiting Earth-sized planets have recently been discovered around\nnearby late M dwarfs, including the TRAPPIST-1 planets and two planets\ndiscovered by the MEarth survey, GJ 1132b and LHS 1140b. These planets are the\nsmallest known planets that may have atmospheres amenable to detection with\nJWST. We present model thermal emission and transmission spectra for each\nplanet, varying composition and surface pressure of the atmosphere. We base\nelemental compositions on those of Earth, Titan, and Venus and calculate the\nmolecular compositions assuming chemical equilibrium, which can strongly depend\non temperature. Both thermal emission and transmission spectra are sensitive to\nthe atmospheric composition; thermal emission spectra are sensitive to surface\npressure and temperature. We predict the observability of each planet's\natmosphere with JWST. GJ 1132b and TRAPPIST-1b are excellent targets for\nemission spectroscopy with JWST/MIRI, requiring fewer than 10 eclipse\nobservations. Emission photometry for TRAPPIST-1c requires 5-15 eclipses; LHS\n1140b and TRAPPIST-1d, TRAPPIST-1e, and TRAPPIST-1f, which could possibly have\nsurface liquid water, may be accessible with photometry. Seven of the nine\nplanets are strong candidates for transmission spectroscopy measurements with\nJWST, though the number of transits required depends strongly on the planets'\nactual masses. Using the measured masses, fewer than 20 transits are required\nfor a 5 sigma detection of spectral features for GJ 1132b and six of the\nTRAPPIST-1 planets. Dedicated campaigns to measure the atmospheres of these\nnine planets will allow us, for the first time, to probe formation and\nevolution processes of terrestrial planetary atmospheres beyond our solar\nsystem.\n", "  Investigations into the microwave surface impedance of superconducting\nresonators have led to the development of single photon counters that rely on\nkinetic inductance for their operation. While concurrent progress in additive\nmanufacturing, `3D printing', opens up a previously inaccessible design space\nfor waveguide resonators. In this manuscript, we present results from the first\nsynthesis of these two technologies in a titanium, aluminum, vanadium\n(Ti-6Al-4V) superconducting radio frequency resonator which exploits a design\nunattainable through conventional fabrication means. We find that Ti-6Al-4V has\ntwo distinct superconducting transition temperatures observable in heat\ncapacity measurements. The higher transition temperature is in agreement with\nDC resistance measurements. While the lower transition temperature, not\npreviously known in literature, is consistent with the observed temperature\ndependence of the superconducting microwave surface impedance. From the surface\nreactance, we extract a London penetration depth of $8\\pm3{\\mu}$m - roughly an\norder of magnitude larger than other titanium alloys and several orders of\nmagnitude larger than other conventional elemental superconductors. This large\nLondon penetration depth suggests that Ti-6Al-4V may be a suitable material for\nhigh kinetic inductance applications such as single photon counting or\nparametric amplification used in quantum computing.\n", "  Gravitational waves from merging neutron stars are expected to be observed in\nthe next 5 years. We explore the potential impact of matter effects on\ngravitational waves from merging double neutron-star binaries. If neutron star\nbinaries exist with chirp masses less than roughly 1 solar mass and typical\nneutron-star radii are larger than roughly 14 km, or if neutron-star radii are\nlarger than 15-16 km for the chirp masses of galactic neutron-star binaries,\nthen matter will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of a\npoint-particle-based search at Advanced LIGO design sensitivity (roughly 5%\nadditional loss of signals). In a configuration typical of LIGO's first\nobserving run, extreme matter effects lead to up to 10% potential loss in the\nmost extreme cases.\n", "  In multi-Higgs models, the properties of one neutral scalar state approximate\nthose of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson in a limit where the corresponding\nscalar field is roughly aligned in field space with the scalar doublet vacuum\nexpectation value. In a scenario of alignment without decoupling, a SM-like\nHiggs boson can be accompanied by additional scalar states whose masses are of\na similar order of magnitude. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM), alignment without decoupling can be achieved due to an accidental\ncancellation of tree-level and radiative loop-level effects. In this paper we\nassess the impact of the leading two-loop O(alpha_s h_t^2) corrections on the\nHiggs alignment condition in the MSSM. These corrections are sizable and\nimportant in the relevant regions of parameter space and furthermore give rise\nto solutions of the alignment condition that are not present in the approximate\none-loop description. We provide a comprehensive numerical comparison of the\nalignment condition obtained in the approximate one-loop and two-loop\napproximations, and discuss its implications for phenomenologically viable\nregions of the MSSM parameter space.\n", "  HD 209458 is one of the benchmark objects in the study of hot Jupiter\natmospheres and their evaporation through planetary winds. The expansion of the\nplanetary atmosphere is thought to be driven by high-energy EUV and X-ray\nirradiation. We obtained new Chandra HRC-I data, which unequivocally show that\nHD 209458 is an X-ray source. Combining these data with archival XMM-Newton\nobservations, we find that the corona of HD 209458 is characterized by a\ntemperature of about 1 MK and an emission measure of 7e49 cm^-3, yielding an\nX-ray luminosity of 1.6e27 erg/s in the 0.124-2.48 keV band. HD 209458 is an\ninactive star with a coronal temperature comparable to that of the inactive Sun\nbut a larger emission measure. At this level of activity, the planetary\nhigh-energy emission is sufficient to support mass-loss at a rate of a few\ntimes 1e10 g/s.\n", "  Weakly interacting massive particles are a widely well-probed dark matter\ncandidate by the dark matter direct detection experiments. Theoretically, there\nare a large number of ultraviolet completed models that consist of a weakly\ninteracting massive particle dark matter. The variety of models makes the\ncomparison with the direct detection data complicated and often non-trivial. To\novercome this, in the non-relativistic limit, the effective theory was\ndeveloped in the literature which works very well to significantly reduce the\ncomplexity of dark matter-nucleon interactions and to better study the nuclear\nresponse functions. In the effective theory framework for a spin-1/2 dark\nmatter, we combine three independent likelihood functions from the latest\nPandaX, LUX, and XENON1T data, and give a joint limit on each effective\ncoupling. The astrophysical uncertainties of the dark matter distribution are\nalso included in the likelihood. We further discuss the isospin violating cases\nof the interactions. Finally, for both dimension-five and dimension-six\neffective theories above the electroweak scale, we give updated limits of the\nnew physics mass scales.\n", "  We study dynamics of an injected domain wall (DW) in 2-dimensional disordered\nferromagnets with different sample shapes using random-field Ising model on a\nsquare lattice rotated by 45 degrees. The saw-tooth DW of the length $L_x$ is\ncreated along one side and swept through the sample by slow ramping of the\nexternal field until the complete magnetisation reversal and the wall\nannihilation at the open top boundary at a distance $L_y$. By fixing the number\nof spins $N=L_x\\times L_y=10^6$ and the random-field distribution above the\ncritical disorder, we vary the ratio $L_x/L_y\\in[1/16,16]$. The periodic\nboundary conditions are applied in the y-direction so that these ratios\ncomprise different samples, i.e., surfaces of cylinders with the changing\nperimeter $L_x$ and height $L_y$. We analyse the avalanches of the DW slips\nbetween following field updates, and the multifractal structure of the\nmagnetisation fluctuation time series. Our findings are that the domain-wall\nlengths materialised in different sample shapes have an impact on the dynamics\nat all scales.\n", "  We give heavy quark-diquark symmetry predictions for doubly heavy baryons and\ntetraquarks in light of the recent discovery of the $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ by LHCb.\nFor five excited doubly charm baryons that are predicted to lie below the\n$\\Lambda_c D$ threshold, we give predictions for their electromagnetic and\nstrong decays using a previously developed chiral Lagrangian with heavy\nquark-diquark symmetry. Based on the mass of the $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$, the existence\nof a doubly heavy bottom $I=0$ tetraquark that is stable to the strong and\nelectromagnetic decays has been predicted. If the mass of this state is below\n10405 MeV, as predicted in some models, we argue using heavy quark-diquark\nsymmetry that the $J^P=1^+$ $I=1$ doubly bottom tetraquark state will lie just\nbelow the open bottom threshold and likely be a narrow state as well. In this\nscenario, we compute strong decay width for this state using a new Lagrangian\nfor tetraquarks which is related to the singly heavy baryon Lagrangian by heavy\nquark-diquark symmetry.\n", "  We construct walls of mass-deformed K\\\"{a}hler nonlinear sigma models on\n$SO(2N)/U(N)$, by using the moduli matrix formalism and the simple roots of\n$SO(2N)$. Penetrable walls are observed in the nonlinear sigma models on\n$SO(2N)/U(N)$ with $N>3$.\n", "  We study a class of 6d $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ non-geometric vacua of the\n$\\text{Spin}(32)/\\mathbb Z_2$ heterotic string which can be understood as\nfibrations of genus-two curves over a complex one-dimensional base. The 6d\n$\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ theories living on the defects that arise when the\ngenus-two fiber degenerates at a point of the base are analyzed by dualizing to\nF-theory on elliptic K3-fibered non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. We consider\nall possible degenerations of genus-two curves and systematically attempt to\nresolve the singularities of the dual threefolds. As in the analogous\nnon-geometric vacua of the $E_8\\times E_8$ heterotic string, we find that many\nof the resulting dual threefolds contain singularities which do not admit a\ncrepant resolution. When the singularities can be resolved crepantly, we\ndetermine the emerging effective theories which turn out to be little string\ntheories at a generic point on their tensor branch. We also observe a form of\nduality in which theories living on distinct defects are the same.\n", "  The oxidation of {\\alpha}-Ti(0001) surface was studied using density\nfunctional theory. In order to enhance the oxidation resistance, we substituted\nTi atoms with Si atoms in Ti(0001) surface. We observe that Si prefers to\nsegregate at the surface layer of Ti(0001) compared to other sub-surface\nlayers. The Si solubility on the Ti(0001) surface was estimated to be around 75\nat.%. While Si segregation was found to reduce the binding between the oxygen\natom and the Ti(0001) surface, the barrier for oxygen to diffuse into the slab\nincreases. The dissociation of the oxygen molecule on the clean and Si\nsegregated surfaces of Ti was found to be barrier-less. Overall, the Si\nsegregation on the Ti(0001) surface was found to hinder the dissolution of\noxygen in Ti.\n", "  Environmental decoherence of oscillating neutrinos of strength $\\Gamma = (2.3\n\\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{-23}$ GeV can explain how maximal $\\theta_{23}$ mixing\nobserved at 295 km by T2K appears to be non-maximal at longer baselines. As\nshown recently by R. Oliveira, the MSW matter effect for neutrinos is altered\nby decoherence: In normal (inverted) mass hierarchy, a resonant enhancement of\n$\\nu_{\\mu} (\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}) \\rightarrow \\nu_{e} (\\bar{\\nu}_{e})$ occurs for $6\n< E_{\\nu} < 20$ GeV. Thus decoherence at the rated strength may be detectable\nas an excess of charged-current $\\nu_{e}$ events in the full $\\nu_{\\mu}$\nexposures of MINOS+ and OPERA.\n", "  We describe the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic nano-oscillator in an\nexternal magnetic field of any given time distribution. The oscillator is\npowered by a spin current originating from spin-orbit effects in a neighboring\nheavy metal layer, and is capable of emitting a THz signal in the presence of\nan additional easy-plane anisotropy. We derive an analytical formula describing\nthe interaction between such a system and an external field, which can affect\nthe output signal character. Interactions with magnetic pulses of different\nshapes, with a sinusoidal magnetic field and with a sequence of rapidly\nchanging magnetic fields are discussed. We also perform numerical simulations\nbased on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-transfer torque effects\nto verify the obtained results and find a very good quantitative agreement\nbetween analytical and numerical predictions.\n", "  We report here the results of searching for inelastic scattering of dark\nmatter (initial and final state dark matter particles differ by a small mass\nsplitting) with nucleon with the first 79.6-day of PandaX-II data (Run 9). We\nset the upper limits for the spin independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross\nsection up to a mass splitting of 300 keV/c$^2$ at two benchmark dark matter\nmasses of 1 and 10 TeV/c$^2$.\n", "  We propose to construct a nonreciprocal single-photon frequency converter via\nmultiple semi-infinite coupled-resonator waveguides (CRWs). We first\ndemonstrate that the frequency of a single photon can be converted\nnonreciprocally through two CRWs, which are coupled indirectly by\noptomechanical interactions with two nondegenerate mechanical modes. Based on\nsuch nonreciprocity, two different single-photon circulators are proposed in\nthe T-shaped waveguides consisting of three semi-infinite CRWs, which are\ncoupled in pairwise by optomechanical interactions. One circulator is proposed\nby using two nondegenerate mechanical modes and the other one is proposed by\nusing three nondegenerate mechanical modes. Nonreciprocal single-photon\nfrequency conversion is induced by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, and the\noptimal conditions for nonreciprocal frequency conversion are obtained. These\nproposals can be used to realize nonreciprocal frequency conversion of single\nphotons in any two distinctive waveguides with different frequencies and they\ncan allow for dynamic control of the direction of frequency conversion by\ntuning the phases of external driving lasers, which may have versatile\napplications in hybrid quantum networks.\n", "  The $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomaly can be explained by tree level exchange of\nleptoquarks. We study the consequences of subjecting these models to the\nprinciple of minimal flavor violation (MFV). We consider MFV in the linear\nregime, and take the charged lepton Yukawa matrix to be the only spurion that\nviolates lepton flavor universality. We find that a combination of constraints\nfrom a variety of processes -- $b\\to s\\mu\\mu$, $b\\to s\\tau\\tau$, $b\\to\ns\\nu\\nu$, $b\\bar b\\to\\tau\\tau$ and $b\\to c\\tau\\nu$ -- excludes MFV in these\nmodels.\n", "  The inflationary expansion of our early-time universe is considered in terms\nof the van der Waals equation, as equation of state for the cosmic fluid, where\na bulk viscosity contribution is assumed to be present. The corresponding\ngravitational equations for the energy density in a homogeneous and isotropic\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker universe are solved, and an analytic\nexpression for the scale factor is obtained. Attention is paid, specifically,\nto the role of the viscosity term in the accelerated expansion; the values of\nthe slow-roll parameters, the spectral index, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio\nfor the van der Waals model are calculated and compared with the most recent\nastronomical data from the Planck satellite. By imposing reasonable\nrestrictions on the parameters of the van der Waals equation, in the presence\nof viscosity, it is shown to be possible for this model to comply quite\nprecisely with the observational data. One can therefore conclude that the\ninclusion of viscosity in the theory of the inflationary epoch definitely\nimproves the cosmological models.\n", "  We consider pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on four-dimensional de Sitter dS$_4$\nand anti-de Sitter AdS$_4$ spaces and construct various solutions to the\nYang-Mills equations. On de Sitter space we reduce the Yang-Mills equations via\nan SU(2)-equivariant ansatz to Newtonian mechanics of a particle moving in\n${\\mathbb R}^3$ under the influence of a quartic potential. Then we describe\nmagnetic and electric-magnetic solutions, both Abelian and non-Abelian, all\nhaving finite energy and finite action. A similar reduction on anti-de Sitter\nspace also yields Yang-Mills solutions with finite energy and action. We\npropose a lower bound for the action on both backgrounds. Employing another\nmetric on AdS$_4$, the SU(2) Yang-Mills equations are reduced to an analytic\ncontinuation of the above particle mechanics from ${\\mathbb R}^3$ to ${\\mathbb\nR}^{2,1}$. We discuss analytical solutions to these equations, which produce\ninfinite-action configurations. After a Euclidean continuation of dS$_4$ and\nAdS$_4$ we also present self-dual (instanton-type) Yang--Mills solutions on\nthese backgrounds.\n", "  Trapped Rydberg ions are a promising novel approach to quantum computing and\nsimulations. They are envisaged to combine the exquisite control of trapped ion\nqubits with the fast two-qubit Rydberg gates already demonstrated in neutral\natom experiments. Coherent Rydberg excitation is a key requirement for these\ngates. Here, we carry out the first coherent Rydberg excitation of an ion and\nperform a single-qubit Rydberg gate, thus demonstrating basic elements of a\ntrapped Rydberg ion quantum computer.\n", "  We study the excitation of spin waves in scaled magnetic waveguides using the\nmagnetoelastic effect. In uniformly magnetized systems, normal strains parallel\nor perpendicular to the magnetization direction do not lead to spin wave\nexcitation since the magnetoelastic torque is zero. Using micromagnetic\nsimulations, we show that the nonuniformity of the magnetization in submicron\nwaveguides due to the effect of the demagnetizing field leads to the excitation\nof spin waves for oscillating normal strains both parallel and perpendicular to\nthe magnetization. The excitation by biaxial normal in-plane strain was found\nto be much more efficient than by uniaxial normal out-of-plane strain. For\nnarrow waveguides with widths of 200\\,nm, the excitation efficiency of biaxial\nnormal in-plane strain was comparable to that of shear strain.\n", "  We study models in which reheating happens only through non-perturbative\nprocesses. The energy transferred can be exponentially suppressed unless the\ninflaton is coupled to a particle with a parametrically small mass.\nAdditionally, in some models a light scalar with a negative mass squared\nparameter leads to much more efficient reheating than one with a positive mass\nsquared of the same magnitude. If a theory contains many sectors similar to the\nStandard Model coupled to the inflaton via their Higgses, such dynamics can\nrealise the Nnaturalness solution to the hierarchy problem. A sector containing\na light Higgs with a non-zero vacuum expectation value is dominantly reheated\nand there is little energy transferred to the other sectors, consistent with\ncosmological constraints. The inflaton must decouple from other particles and\nhave a flat potential at large field values, in which case the visible sector\nUV cutoff can be raised to 10 TeV in a simple model.\n", "  We have fabricated disordered superconducting nanowires of molybdenium\nsilicide. A molybdenium nanowire is first deposited on top of silicon, and the\nalloy is formed by rapid thermal annealing. The method allows tuning of the\ncrystal growth to optimise, e.g., the resistivity of the alloy for potential\napplications in quantum phase slip devices and superconducting nanowire\nsingle-photon detectors. The wires have effective diameters from 42 to 79 nm,\nenabling the observation of crossover from conventional superconductivity to\nregimes affected by thermal and quantum fluctuations. In the smallest diameter\nwire and at temperatures well below the superconducting critical temperature,\nwe observe residual resistance and negative magnetoresistance, which can be\nconsidered as fingerprints of quantum phase slips.\n", "  A quite general device analysis method that allows the direct evaluation of\noptical and recombination losses in crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based solar\ncells has been developed. By applying this technique, the optical and physical\nlimiting factors of the state-of-the-art solar cells with ~20% efficiencies\nhave been revealed. In the established method, the carrier loss mechanisms are\ncharacterized from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) analysis with very low\ncomputational cost. In particular, the EQE analyses of textured c-Si solar\ncells are implemented by employing the experimental reflectance spectra\nobtained directly from the actual devices while using flat optical models\nwithout any fitting parameters. We find that the developed method provides\nalmost perfect fitting to EQE spectra reported for various textured c-Si solar\ncells, including c-Si heterojunction solar cells, a dopant-free c-Si solar cell\nwith a MoOx layer, and an n-type passivated emitter with rear locally diffused\n(PERL) solar cell. The modeling of the recombination loss further allows the\nextraction of the minority carrier diffusion length and surface recombination\nvelocity from the EQE analysis. Based on the EQE analysis results, the carrier\nloss mechanisms in different types of c-Si solar cells are discussed.\n", "  Star formation in a filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC) is simulated over\na dynamic range of 4.2 pc to 28 au for a period of $3.5\\times 10^5$ yr,\nincluding magnetic fields and both radiative and outflow feedback from the\nprotostars. At the end of the simulation, the star formation efficiency is 4.3\nper cent and the star formation rate per free fall time is $\\epsilon_{\\rm\nff}\\simeq 0.04$, within the range of observed values (Krumholz et al. 2012a).\nThe total stellar mass increases as $\\sim\\,t^2$, whereas the number of\nprotostars increases as $\\sim\\,t^{1.5}$. We find that the density profile\naround most of the simulated protostars is $\\sim\\,\\rho\\propto r^{-1.5}$, as\npredicted by Murray & Chang (2015). At the end of the simulation, the\nprotostellar mass function approaches the Chabrier (2005) stellar initial mass\nfunction. We infer that the time to form a star of median mass $0.2\\,M_\\odot$\nis about $1.4\\times 10^5$~yr from the median mass accretion rate. We find good\nagreement among the protostellar luminosities observed in the large sample of\nDunham et al. (2013), our simulation, and a theoretical estimate, and conclude\nthat the classical protostellar luminosity problem Kenyon et al. (1990) is\nresolved. The multiplicity of the stellar systems in the simulation agrees to\nwithin a factor 2 of observations of Class I young stellar objects; most of the\nsimulated multiple systems are unbound. Bipolar protostellar outflows are\nlaunched using a sub-grid model, and extend up to 1 pc from their host star.\nThe mass-velocity relation of the simulated outflows is consistent with both\nobservation and theory.\n", "  The influence of centre vortices on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is\ninvestigated through the light hadron spectrum on the lattice. Recent studies\nof the quark propagator and other quantities have provided evidence that centre\nvortices are the fundamental objects underpinning dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking in SU(3) gauge theory. For the first time, we use the chiral overlap\nfermion action to study the low-lying hadron spectrum on lattice ensembles\nconsisting of Monte Carlo, vortex-removed, and vortex-projected gauge fields.\nWe find that gauge field configurations consisting solely of smoothed centre\nvortices are capable of reproducing all the salient features of the hadron\nspectrum, including dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. The hadron spectrum on\nvortex-removed fields shows clear signals of chiral symmetry restoration at\nlight values of the bare quark mass, while at heavy masses the spectrum is\nconsistent with a theory of weakly-interacting constituent quarks.\n", "  X-ray phase-contrast imaging has experienced rapid development over the last\nfew decades, and in this technology, the phase modulation strategy of\nphase-stepping is used most widely to measure the sample's phase signal.\nHowever, because of its discontinuous nature, phase-stepping has the defects of\nworse mechanical stability and high exposure dose, which greatly hinder its\nwide application in dynamic phase measurement and potential clinical\napplications. In this manuscript, we demonstrate preliminary research on the\nuse of integrating-bucket phase modulation method to retrieve the phase\ninformation in grating-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging. Experimental results\nshowed that our proposed method can be well employed to extract the\ndifferential phase-contrast image, compared with the current mostly used\nphase-stepping strategy, advantage of integrating-bucket phase modulation\ntechnique is that fast measurement and low dose are promising.\n", "  The dynamic and static critical behaviors of driven and equilibrium lattice\ngas models are studied in two spatial dimensions. We show that in the\nshort-time regime immediately following a critical quench, the dynamics of the\ntransverse order parameters, auto-correlations, and Binder cumulant are\nconsistent with the prediction of a Gaussian, $i.e.,$ non-interacting,\neffective theory, both for the equilibrium lattice gas and its nonequilibrium\ncounterparts. Such a \"super-universal\" behavior is observed only at short times\nafter a critical quench, while the various models display their distinct\nbehaviors in the stationary states, described by the corresponding, known\nuniversality classes.\n", "  As the largest organ in the human body, the skin provides the important\nsensory channel for humans to receive external stimulations based on touch. By\nthe information perceived through touch, people can feel and guess the\nproperties of objects, like weight, temperature, textures, and motion, etc. In\nfact, those properties are nerve stimuli to our brain received by different\nkinds of receptors in the skin. Mechanical, electrical, and thermal stimuli can\nstimulate these receptors and cause different information to be conveyed\nthrough the nerves. Technologies for actuators to provide mechanical,\nelectrical or thermal stimuli have been developed. These include static or\nvibrational actuation, electrostatic stimulation, focused ultrasound, and more.\nSmart materials, such as piezoelectric materials, carbon nanotubes, and shape\nmemory alloys, play important roles in providing actuation for tactile\nsensation. This paper aims to review the background biological knowledge of\nhuman tactile sensing, to give an understanding of how we sense and interact\nwith the world through the sense of touch, as well as the conventional and\nstate-of-the-art technologies of tactile actuators for tactile feedback\ndelivery.\n", "  We consider the production of $Z$ bosons associated with beauty quarks at the\nLHC using a combined $k_T$ + collinear QCD factorization approach, that\ninterpolates between small $x$ and large $x$ physics. Our consideration is\nbased on the off-shell gluon-gluon fusion subprocess $g^* g^* \\to Z Q\\bar Q$ at\nthe leading order ${\\cal O}(\\alpha\\alpha_s^2)$ (where the $Z$ boson further\ndecays into a lepton pair), calculated in the $k_T$-factorization approach, and\nseveral subleading ${\\cal O}(\\alpha \\alpha_s^2 )$ and ${\\cal O}(\\alpha\n\\alpha_s^3 )$ subprocesses involving quark-antiquark and quark-gluon\ninteractions, taken into account in conventional (collinear) QCD factorization.\nThe contributions from double parton scattering are discussed as well. The\ntransverse momentum dependent (or unintegrated) gluon densities in a proton are\nderived from Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) evolution equation. We\nachieve reasonably good agreement with the latest data taken by CMS and ATLAS\nCollaborations. The comparison of our results with next-to-leading-order pQCD\npredictions, obtained in the collinear QCD factorization, is presented. We\ndiscuss the uncertainties of our calculations and demonstrate the importance of\nsubleading quark involving contributions in describing the LHC data in the\nwhole kinematic region.\n", "  Carbon-hydrogen plasmas and hydrocarbon materials are of broad interest to\nlaser shock experimentalists, high energy density physicists, and\nastrophysicists. Accurate equations of state (EOS) of hydrocarbons are valuable\nfor various studies from inertial confinement fusion (ICF) to planetary\nscience. By combining path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results at high\ntemperatures and density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) results\nat lower temperatures, we compute the EOS for hydrocarbons at 1473 separate\n($\\rho,T$)-points distributed over a range of compositions. These methods\naccurately treat electronic excitation and many-body interaction effects and\nthus provide a benchmark-quality EOS that surpasses that of semi-empirical and\nThomas-Fermi-based methods in the warm dense matter regime. By comparing our\nfirst-principles EOS to the LEOS 5112 model for CH, we validate the specific\nheat assumptions in this model but suggest that the Grueneisen parameter is too\nlarge at low temperature. Based on our first-principles EOS, we predict the\nHugoniot curve of polystyrene to be 2-5% softer at maximum compression than\nthat predicted by orbital-free DFT and SESAME 7593. By investigating the atomic\nstructure and chemical bonding, we show a drastic decrease in the lifetime of\nchemical bonds in the pressure interval of 0.4-4 megabar. We find the\nassumption of linear mixing to be valid for describing the EOS and the shock\nHugoniot curve of the dense, partially ionized hydrocarbons under\nconsideration. We make predictions of the shock compression of glow-discharge\npolymers and investigate the effects of oxygen content and C:H ratio on their\nHugoniot curve. Our full suite of first-principles simulation results may be\nused to benchmark future theoretical investigations pertaining to hydrocarbon\nEOS, and should be helpful in guiding the design of future gigabar experiments.\n", "  We use 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the effect of the\nsaturated whistler instability on the viscous heating and nonthermal\nacceleration of electrons in a shearing, collisionless plasma with a growing\nmagnetic field, \\textbf{B}. In this setup, an electron pressure anisotropy with\n$p_{\\perp,e} > p_{||,e}$ naturally arises due to the adiabatic invariance of\nthe electron magnetic moment ($p_{||,e}$ and $p_{\\perp,e}$ are the pressures\nparallel and perpendicular to \\textbf{B}). If the anisotropy is large enough,\nthe whistler instability arises, efficiently scattering the electrons and\nlimiting $\\Delta p_e$ ($\\equiv p_{\\perp,e}-p_{||,e}$). In this context, $\\Delta\np_e$ taps into the plasma velocity shear, producing electron heating by the so\ncalled anisotropic viscosity. In our simulations, we permanently drive the\ngrowth of $|\\textbf{B}|$ by externally imposing a plasma shear, allowing us to\nself-consistently capture the long-term, saturated whistler instability\nevolution. We find that besides the viscous heating, the scattering by whistler\nmodes can stochastically accelerate electrons to nonthermal energies. This\nacceleration is most prominent when initially $\\beta_e\\sim 1$, gradually\ndecreasing its efficiency for larger values of $\\beta_e$ ($\\equiv 8\\pi\np_e/|\\textbf{B}|^2$). If initially $\\beta_e \\sim 1$, the final electron energy\ndistribution can be approximately described by a thermal component, plus a\npower-law tail with spectral index $\\sim 3.7$. In these cases, the nonthermal\ntail accounts for $\\sim 5\\%$ of the electrons, and for $\\sim 15\\%$ of their\nkinetic energy. We discuss the implications of our results for electron heating\nand acceleration in low-collisionality astrophysical environments, such as\nlow-luminosity accretion flows.\n", "  The relation between a cosmological halo concentration and its mass (cMr) is\na powerful tool to constrain cosmological models of halo formation and\nevolution. On the scale of galaxy clusters the cMr has so far been determined\nmostly with X-ray and gravitational lensing data. The use of independent\ntechniques is helpful in assessing possible systematics. Here we provide one of\nthe few determinations of the cMr by the dynamical analysis of the\nprojected-phase-space distribution of cluster members. Based on the WINGS and\nOmegaWINGS data sets, we used the Jeans analysis with the MAMPOSSt technique to\ndetermine masses and concentrations for 49 nearby clusters, each of which has\n~60 spectroscopic members or more within the virial region, after removal of\nsubstructures. Our cMr is in statistical agreement with theoretical predictions\nbased on LambdaCDM cosmological simulations. Our cMr is different from most\nprevious observational determinations because of its flatter slope and lower\nnormalization. It is however in agreement with two recent cMr obtained using\nthe lensing technique on the CLASH and LoCuSS cluster data sets. In the future\nwe will extend our analysis to galaxy systems of lower mass and at higher\nredshifts.\n", "  Future generation of gravitational wave detectors will have the sensitivity\nto detect gravitational wave events at redshifts far beyond any detectable\nelectromagnetic sources. We show that if the observed event rate is greater\nthan one event per year at redshifts z > 40, then the probability distribution\nof primordial density fluctuations must be significantly non-Gaussian or the\nevents originate from primordial black holes. The nature of the excess events\ncan be determined from the redshift distribution of the merger rate.\n", "  We present a determination of the strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s(m_Z)$\nusing inclusive top-quark pair production cross section measurements performed\nat the LHC and at the Tevatron. Following a procedure first applied by the CMS\ncollaboration, we extract individual values of $\\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from\nmeasurements by different experiments at several centre-of-mass energies, using\nQCD predictions complete in NNLO perturbation theory, supplemented with NNLL\napproximations to all orders, and suitable sets of parton distribution\nfunctions. The determinations are then combined using a likelihood-based\napproach, where special emphasis is put on a consistent treatment of\ntheoretical uncertainties and of correlations between various sources of\nsystematic uncertainties. Our final combined result is $\\alpha_s(m_Z) =\n0.1177^{+0.0034}_{-0.0036}$.\n", "  Synchrotron radiation from cosmic rays is a key observational probe of the\ngalactic magnetic field. Interpreting synchrotron emission data requires\nknowledge of the cosmic ray number density, which is often assumed to be in\nenergy equipartition (or otherwise tightly correlated) with the magnetic field\nenergy. However, there is no compelling observational or theoretical reason to\nexpect such tight correlation to hold across all scales. We use test particle\nsimulations, tracing the propagation of charged particles (protons) through a\nrandom magnetic field, to study the cosmic ray distribution at scales\ncomparable to the correlation scale of the turbulent flow in the interstellar\nmedium ($\\simeq 100\\,{\\rm pc}$ in spiral galaxies). In these simulations, we\nfind that there is no spatial correlation between the cosmic ray number density\nand the magnetic field energy density. In fact, their distributions are\napproximately statistically independent. We find that low-energy cosmic rays\ncan become trapped between magnetic mirrors, whose location depends more on the\nstructure of the field lines than on the field strength.\n", "  In a holographic probe-brane model exhibiting a spontaneously spatially\nmodulated ground state, we introduce explicit sources of symmetry breaking in\nthe form of ionic and antiferromagnetic lattices. For the first time in a\nholographic model, we demonstrate pinning, in which the translational Goldstone\nmode is lifted by the introduction of explicit sources of translational\nsymmetry breaking. The numerically computed optical conductivity fits very well\nto a Drude-Lorentz model with a small residual metallicity, precisely matching\nanalytic formulas for the DC conductivity. We also find an instability of the\nstriped phase in the presence of a large-amplitude ionic lattice.\n", "  Galactic black hole candidate Swift~J1753.5-0127 was discovered on 2005 June\n30 by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. We study the accretion flow properties\nduring its very first outburst through careful analysis of the evolution of the\nspectral and the temporal properties using the two-component advective flow\n(TCAF) paradigm. RXTE proportional counter array spectra in $2.5-25$ keV are\nfitted with the current version of the TCAF model fits file to estimate\nphysical flow parameters, such as two component (Keplerian disk and\nsub-Keplerian halo) accretion rates, properties of the Compton cloud, probable\nmass of the source, etc. The source is found to be in harder (hard and\nhard-intermediate) spectral states during the entire phase of the outburst with\nvery significant jet activity. Since in TCAF solution, the model normalization\nis constant for any particular source, any requirement of significantly\ndifferent normalization to have a better fit on certain days would point to\nX-ray contribution from components not taken into account in the current TCAF\nmodel fits file. By subtracting the contribution using actual normalization, we\nderive the contribution of X-rays from the jets and outflows. We study its\nproperties, such as its magnitude and spectra. We find that on some days, up to\nabout 32\\% X-ray flux is emitted from the base of the jet itself.\n", "  In this letter we present a theorem on the dynamics of the generalized\nHubbard models. This theorem shows that the symmetry of the single particle\nHamiltonian can protect a kind of dynamical symmetry driven by the\ninteractions. Here the dynamical symmetry refers to that the time evolution of\ncertain observables are symmetric between the repulsive and attractive Hubbard\nmodels. We demonstrate our theorem with three different examples in which the\nsymmetry involves bipartite lattice symmetry, reflection symmetry and\ntranslation symmetry, respectively. Each of these examples relates to one\nrecent cold atom experiment on the dynamics in the optical lattices where such\na dynamical symmetry is manifested. These experiments include expansion\ndynamics of cold atoms, chirality of atomic motion within a synthetic magnetic\nfield and melting of charge-density-wave order. Therefore, our theorem provides\na unified view of these seemingly disparate phenomena.\n", "  A formalism for treating the scattering of decuplet baryons in chiral\neffective field theory is developed. The minimal Lagrangian and potentials in\nleading-order SU(3) chiral effective field theory for the interactions of octet\nbaryons ($B$) and decuplet baryons ($D$) for the transitions $BB\\to BB$,\n$BB\\leftrightarrow DB$, $DB\\to DB$, $BB\\leftrightarrow DD$, $DB\\leftrightarrow\nDD$, and $DD\\to DD$ are provided. As an application of the formalism we compare\nwith results from lattice QCD simulations for $\\Omega\\Omega$ and $N\\Omega$\nscattering. Implications of our results pertinent to the quest for dibaryons\nare discussed.\n", "  We consider static, spherically symmetric configurations in general\nrelativity, supported by nonlinear electromagnetic fields with gauge-invariant\nLagrangians depending on the single invariant $f = F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}$.\nAfter a brief review on black hole (BH) and solitonic solutions, obtained so\nfar with pure electric or magnetic fields, an attempt is made to obtain dyonic\nsolutions, those with both electric and magnetic charges. A general scheme is\nsuggested, leading to solutions in quadratures for an arbitrary Lagrangian\nfunction $L(f)$ (up to some monotonicity restrictions); such solutions are\nexpressed in terms of $f$ as a new radial coordinate instead of the usual\ncoordinate $r$. For the truncated Born-Infeld theory (depending on the\ninvariant $f$ only), a general dyonic solution is obtained in terms of $r$. A\nfeature of interest in this solution is the existence of a special case with a\nself-dual electromagnetic field, $f \\equiv 0$ and the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nmetric.\n", "  Given the tension between the values of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ inferred\nfrom the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and from supernovae, attention is\nturning to time delays of strongly lensed quasars. Current time-delay\nmeasurements indicate a value of $H_0$ closer to that from supernovae, with\nerrors on the order of a few percent, and future measurements aim to bring the\nerrors down to the subpercent level. Here we consider the uncertainties in the\nmass distribution in the outskirts of the lens. We show that these can lead to\nerrors in the inferred $H_0$ on the order of a percent and, once accounted for,\nwould correct $H_0$ upward (thus increasing slightly the tension with the CMB).\nWeak gravitational lensing and simulations may help to reduce these\nuncertainties.\n", "  Stacking-dependent interlayer interactions are important for understanding\nthe structural and electronic properties in incommensurable two dimensional\nmaterial assemblies where long-range moir\\'e patterns arise due to small\nlattice constant mismatch or twist angles. Here, we study the\nstacking-dependent interlayer coupling energies between graphene (G) and\nhexagonal boron nitride (BN) homo- and hetero-structures using high-level\nrandom-phase approximation (RPA) ab initio calculations. Our results show that\nalthough total binding energies within LDA and RPA differ substantially between\na factor of 200%-400%, the energy differences as a function of stacking\nconfiguration yield nearly constant values with variations smaller than 20%\nmeaning that LDA estimates are quite reliable. We produce phenomenological fits\nto these energy differences, which allows us to calculate various properties of\ninterest including interlayer spacing, sliding energetics, pressure gradients\nand elastic coefficients to high accuracy. The importance of long-range\ninteractions (captured by RPA but not LDA) on various properties is also\ndiscussed. Parameterisations for all fits are provided.\n", "  We present a generalization of the n-dimensional (pure) Lovelock Gravity\ntheory based on an enlarged Lorentz symmetry. In particular, we propose an\nalternative way to introduce a cosmological term. Interestingly, we show that\nthe usual pure Lovelock gravity is recovered in a matter-free configuration.\nThe five and six-dimensional cases are explicitly studied.\n", "  The main result of this paper is the proof that there are local electric and\nmagnetic field configurations expressed in terms of field lines on an arbitrary\nhyperbolic manifold. This electromagnetic field is described by (dual)\nsolutions of the Maxwell's equations of the Einstein-Maxwell theory. These\nsolutions have the following important properties: i) they are general, in the\nsense that the knot solutions are particular cases of them and ii) they reduce\nto the electromagnetic fields in the field line representation in the flat\nspace-time. Also, we discuss briefly the real representation of these\nelectromagnetic configurations and write down the corresponding Einstein\nequations.\n", "  LOFAR observations at 144 MHz have revealed large-scale radio sources in the\nunrelaxed galaxy cluster Abell 1132. The cluster hosts diffuse radio emission\non scales of $\\sim$650 kpc near the cluster center and a head-tail (HT) radio\ngalaxy, extending up to 1 Mpc, South of the cluster center. The central diffuse\nradio emission is not seen in NVSS, FIRST, WENSS, nor in C & D array VLA\nobservations at 1.4 GHz, but is detected in our follow-up GMRT observations at\n325 MHz. Using LOFAR and GMRT data, we determine the spectral index of the\ncentral diffuse emission to be $\\alpha=-1.75\\pm0.19$ ($S\\propto\\nu^{\\alpha}$).\nWe classify this emission as an ultra-steep spectrum radio halo and discuss the\npossible implications for the physical origin of radio halos. The HT radio\ngalaxy shows narrow, collimated emission extending up to 1 Mpc and another 300\nkpc of more diffuse, disturbed emission, giving a full projected linear size of\n1.3 Mpc - classifying it as a giant radio galaxy (GRG) and making it the\nlongest HT found to date. The head of the GRG coincides with an elliptical\ngalaxy (SDSS J105851.01$+$564308.5) belonging to Abell 1132. In our LOFAR\nimage, there appears to be a connection between the radio halo and the GRG. The\nturbulence that may have produced the halo may have also affected the tail of\nthe GRG. In turn, the GRG may have provided seed electrons for the radio halo.\n", "  A generalization of the Wilson loop area-law criterion is proposed, which is\napplicable to gauge theories with matter in the fundamental representation of\nthe gauge group. This new criterion, like the area law, is stronger than the\nstatement that asymptotic particle states are massive color singlets, which\nholds even for theories described by the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.\n", "  The predictability of hierarchical quark mass matrices with symmetrically\nplaced texture zeros is explored in the light of current precision measurements\non quark masses and mixing data and interesting phenomenological relations\namong the quark mass ratios and flavor mixing angles along with CP asymmetry\nangle $\\beta$ are deduced for different predictive textures within the\nframework of the Standard Model. It is shown that a single non-trivial phase in\nthese mass matrices is sufficient enough to account for the observed\nCP-violation in the quark sector. In particular, it is observed that the\nCabibbo angle is predominantly determined by the ratio $\\sqrt{m_{d}/m_{s}}$ and\ncorrections may also result from $\\sqrt{m_{u}/m_{c}}$. Furthermore,\n$V_{cb}\\cong \\sqrt{m_d/m_b}$ or $V_{cb}\\cong \\sqrt{m_c/2m_t}$ along with\n$V_{ub}\\simeq \\sqrt{m_u/m_t}$ provide excellent agreements with the current\nmixing data and $\\beta =-Arg\\lbrace V_{td}\\rbrace$ may provide a rigorous test\nat the B-factories for some of these texture zero structures.\n", "  Ab initio grids of time dependent chemical models, varying in gas density,\ntemperature, cosmic ray ionization rate, and radiation field, are used as input\nto RADEX calculations. Tables of abundances, column densities, theoretical line\nintensities, and line ratios for some of the most used dense gas tracers are\nprovided. The degree of correlation as well as degeneracy inherent in molecular\nratios is discussed. Comparisons of the theoretical intensities with example\nobservations are also provided. We find that, within the parameters space\nexplored, chemical abundances can be constrained by a well defined set of gas\ndensity-gas temperature-cosmic ray ionization rate for the species we\ninvestigate here. However, line intensities, as well as, more importantly, line\nratios, from different chemical models can be very similar leading to a clear\ndegeneracy. We also find that the gas subjected to a galactic cosmic ray\nionization rate will not necessarily have reached steady state by 1 Myr. The\nspecies most affected by time dependency effects are HCN and CS, both high\ndensity tracers. We use our method to fit an example set of data from two\ngalaxies. We find that (i) molecular line ratios can be easily matched even\nwith erroneous individual line intensities; (ii) no set of species can be\nmatched by a one-component ISM; (iii) a species may be a good tracer of an\nenergetic process but only under specific density and temperature conditions.\nWe show that by taking into consideration the chemistry behind each species and\nthe individual line intensities, many degeneracies that arise by just using\nmolecular line ratios can be avoided. Finally we show that using a species or a\nratio as a tracer of an individual energetic process (e.g. cosmic rays, UV)\nought to be done with caution.\n", "  Elastic channels are an important component of many soft matter systems, in\nwhich hydrodynamic interactions with confining membranes determine the behavior\nof particles in flow. In this work, we derive analytical expressions for the\nGreen's functions associated to a point-force (Stokeslet) directed parallel or\nperpendicular to the axis of an elastic cylindrical channel exhibiting\nresistance against shear and bending. We then compute the leading order self-\nand pair mobility functions of particles on the cylinder axis, finding that the\nmobilities are primarily determined by membrane shear and that bending does not\nplay a significant role. In the quasi-steady limit of vanishing frequency, the\nparticle self- and pair mobilities near a no-slip hard cylinder are recovered\nonly if the membrane possesses a non-vanishing shear rigidity. We further\ncompute the membrane deformation, finding that deformation is generally more\npronounced in the axial (radial) directions, for the motion along\n(perpendicular) to the cylinder centerline, respectively. Our analytical\ncalculations for the Green's functions in an elastic cylinder can serve as a\nfundamental building block for future studies and are verified by fully\nresolved boundary integral simulations where a very good agreement is obtained.\n", "  If the scalar sector of the Standard Model is non-minimal, one might expect\nmultiple generations of the hypercharge-1/2 scalar doublet analogous to the\ngenerational structure of the fermions. In this work, we examine the structure\nof a Higgs sector consisting of N Higgs doublets (where N \\geq 2). It is\nparticularly convenient to work in the so-called charged Higgs basis, in which\nthe neutral Higgs vacuum expectation value resides entirely in the first Higgs\ndoublet, and the charged components of remaining N-1 Higgs doublets are\nmass-eigenstate fields.\n  We elucidate the interactions of the gauge bosons with the physical Higgs\nscalars and the Goldstone bosons and show that they are determined by an Nx2N\nmatrix. This matrix depends on (N-1)(2N-1) real parameters that are associated\nwith the mixing of the neutral Higgs fields in the charged Higgs basis. Among\nthese parameters, N-1 are unphysical (and can be removed by rephasing the\nphysical charged Higgs fields), and the remaining 2(N-1)^2 parameters are\nphysical. We also demonstrate a particularly simple form for the cubic\ninteraction and some of the quartic interactions of the Goldstone bosons with\nthe physical Higgs scalars. These results are applied in the derivation of\nHiggs coupling sum rules and tree-level unitarity bounds that restrict the size\nof the quartic scalar couplings. In particular, new applications to three Higgs\ndoublet models with an order-4 CP symmetry and with a Z_3 symmetry,\nrespectively, are presented.\n", "  We demonstrate that a holographic model of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair\nexhibits fast scrambling. Strongly entangled quark and antiquark in\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory are considered. Their gravity dual is a\nfundamental string whose endpoints are uniformly accelerated in opposite\ndirection. We slightly increase the acceleration of the endpoint and show that\nit quickly destroys the correlation between the quark and antiquark. The proper\ntime scale of the destruction is $\\tau_\\ast\\sim \\beta \\ln S$ where $\\beta$ is\nthe inverse Unruh temperature and $S$ is the entropy of the accelerating quark.\nWe also evaluate the Lyapunov exponent from correlation function as\n$\\lambda_L=2\\pi/\\beta$, which saturates the Lyapunov bound. Our results suggest\nthat the fast scrambling or saturation of the Lyapunov bound do not directly\nimply the existence of an Einstein dual. When we slightly decrease the\nacceleration, the quark and antiquark are causally connected and an \"one-way\ntraversable wormhole\" is created on the worldsheet. It causes the divergence of\nthe correlation function between the quark and antiquark.\n", "  Standard models of reaction kinetics in condensed materials rely on the\nBoltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the population of reactants at the top of the\nfree energy barrier separating them from the products. While energy dissipation\nand quantum effects at the barrier top can potentially affect the transmission\ncoefficient entering the rate preexponential factor, much stronger dynamical\neffects on the reaction barrier are caused by the breakdown of ergodicity for\npopulating the reaction barrier (violation of the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics).\nWhen the spectrum of medium modes coupled to the reaction coordinate includes\nfluctuations slower than the reaction rate, such nuclear motions dynamically\nfreeze on the reaction time-scale and do not contribute to the activation\nbarrier. Here we consider the consequences of this scenario for electrode\nreactions in slowly relaxing media. Changing electrode overpotential speeds\nelectrode electron transfer up, potentially cutting through the spectrum of\nnuclear modes coupled to the reaction coordinate. The reorganization energy of\nelectrochemical electron transfer becomes a function of the electrode\noverpotential, switching between the thermodynamic value at low rates to the\nnonergodic limit at higher rates. The sharpness of this transition depends of\nthe relaxation spectrum of the medium. The reorganization energy experiences a\nsudden drop with increasing overpotential for a medium with a Debye relaxation,\nbut becomes a much shallower function of the overpotential for media with\nstretched exponential dynamics. The latter scenario characterizes electron\ntransfer in ionic liquids. The analysis of electrode reactions in\nroom-temperature ionic liquids shows that the magnitude of the free energy of\nnuclear solvation is significantly below its thermodynamic limit.\n", "  Detection of the neutrinoless $\\beta\\beta$ ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay is of\nhigh priority in the particle- and neutrino-physics communities. The\ndetectability of this decay mode is strongly influenced by the value of the\nweak axial-vector coupling constant $g_{\\rm A}$. The recent nuclear-model\nanalyses of $\\beta$ and $\\beta\\beta$ decays suggest that the value of $g_{\\rm\nA}$ could be dramatically quenched, reaching ratios of $g^{\\rm free}_{\\rm\nA}/g_{\\rm A}\\approx 4$, where $g^{\\rm free}_{\\rm A}=1.27$ is the free,\nneutron-decay, value of $g_{\\rm A}$. The effects of this quenching appear\ndevastating for the sensitivity of the present and future $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\nexperiments since the 4$th$ power of this ratio scales the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\nhalf-lives. This, in turn, could lead to some two orders of magnitude less\nsensitivity for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments. In the present Letter it is\nshown that by using a consistent approach to both the two-neutrino $\\beta\\beta$\nand $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays by the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase\napproximation (pnQRPA), the feared two-orders-of-magnitude reduction in the\nsensitivity of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments actually shrinks to a reduction\nby factors in the range $2-6$. This certainly has dramatic consequences for the\npotential to detect the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay.\n", "  We discuss various realizations of the Weyl group in the background field\nexpansion of quantum gravity, in the presence of a cutoff, as required in\napplications of the functional renormalization group. In order to study the\nbackground--dependence, special attention is given to split gauge\ntransformations, which act on the background field and fluctuation keeping the\ntotal metric unchanged. The results generalize previous works on global and\nlocal scale transformations.\n", "  We focus on empirically measure the p-factor of a homogeneous sample of 29\nLMC and 10 SMC Cepheids for which an accurate average LMC/SMC distance were\nestimated from eclipsing binary systems. We used the SPIPS algorithm, which is\nan implementation of the BW method. As opposed to other conventional use, SPIPS\ncombines all observables, i.e. radial velocities, multi-band photometry and\ninterferometry into a consistent physical modeling to estimate the parameters\nof the stars. The large number and their redundancy insure its robustness and\nimproves the statistical precision. We successfully estimated the p-factor of\nseveral MC Cepheids. Combined with our previous Galactic results, we find the\nfollowing P-p relation: -0.08(log P-1.18)+1.24. We find no evidence of a\nmetallicity dependent p-factor. We also derive a new calibration of the P-R\nrelation, logR=0.684(log P-0.517)+1.489, with an intrinsic dispersion of 0.020.\nWe detect an IR excess for all stars at 3.6 and 4.5um, which might be the\nsignature of circumstellar dust. We measure a mean offset of $\\Delta\nm_{3.6}=0.057$mag and $\\Delta m_{4.5}=0.065$mag. We provide a new P-p relation\nbased on a multi-wavelengths fit, and can be used for the distance scale\ncalibration from the BW method. The dispersion is due to the MCs width we took\ninto account because individual Cepheids distances are unknown. The new P-R\nrelation has a small intrinsic dispersion, i.e. 4.5% in radius. Such precision\nwill allow us to accurately apply the BW method to nearby galaxies. Finally,\nthe IR excesses we detect raise again the issue on using mid-IR wavelengths to\nderive P-L relation and calibrate the $H_0$. These IR excesses might be the\nsignature of circumstellar dust, and are never taken into account when applying\nthe BW method at those wavelengths. Our measured offsets may give an average\nbias of 2.8% on the distances derived through mid-IR P-L relations.\n", "  Pump-probe experiments and polarizing microscopy are applied to examine\ntemperature and heat flow in metallic magnetic superlattices on glass\nsubstrates. A model of heat diffusion in thin layers for cylindrical symmetry,\nequivalent to the Green's function method, gives a good description of the\nresults. The frequency dependence of temperature modulation shows that a glass\nlayer should be added to the sample structure. The demagnetization patterns are\nreproduced with a Green's function that includes an interface conductance.\n", "  Microwave photons have become very important qubits in quantum communication\nas the first quantum satellite has been launched successfully. Therefore, it is\na necessary and meaningful task for ensuring the high security and efficiency\nof microwave-based quantum communication in practice. Here, we present an\noriginal polarization entanglement purification protocol for nonlocal microwave\nphotons based on the cross-Kerr effect in circuit quantum electrodynamics\n(QED). Our protocol can solve the problem that the purity of maximally\nentangled states used for constructing quantum channels will decrease due to\ndecoherence from environment noise. This task is accomplished by means of the\npolarization parity-check quantum nondemolition (QND) detector, the\nbit-flipping operation, and the linear microwave elements. The QND detector is\ncomposed of several cross-Kerr effect systems which can be realized by coupling\ntwo superconducting transmission line resonators to a superconducting molecule\nwith the N-type level structure. We give the applicable experimental parameters\nof QND measurement system in circuit QED and analyze the fidelities. Our\nprotocol has good applications in long-distance quantum communication assisted\nby microwave photons in the future, such as satellite quantum communication.\n", "  We present a mode-sum regularization prescription for computing the vacuum\npolarization of a scalar field in static spherically-symmetric black hole\nspacetimes in even dimensions. This is the first general and systematic\napproach to regularized vacuum polarization in higher even dimensions, building\nupon a previous scheme we developed for odd dimensions. Things are more\ncomplicated here since the even-dimensional propagator possesses logarithmic\nsingularities which must be regularized. However, in spite of this\ncomplication, the regularization parameters can be computed in closed form in\narbitrary even dimensions and for arbitrary metric function $f(r)$. As an\nexplicit example of our method, we show plots for vacuum polarization of a\nmassless scalar field in the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetime for even\n$d=4,...,10$. However, the method presented applies straightforwardly to\nmassive fields or to nonvacuum spacetimes.\n", "  The role of gluons in the structure of the nucleon and light nuclei is\ninvestigated using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. The first\nmoment of the unpolarised gluon distribution is studied in nuclei up to atomic\nnumber $A=3$ at quark masses corresponding to pion masses of $m_\\pi\\sim 450$\nand $806$ MeV. Nuclear modification of this quantity defines a gluonic analogue\nof the EMC effect and is constrained to be less than $\\sim 10$% in these\nnuclei. This is consistent with expectations from phenomenological quark\ndistributions and the momentum sum rule. In the deuteron, the combination of\ngluon distributions corresponding to the $b_1$ structure function is found to\nhave a small first moment compared with the corresponding momentum fraction.\nThe first moment of the gluon transversity structure function is also\ninvestigated in the spin-1 deuteron, where a non-zero signal is observed at\n$m_\\pi \\sim 806$ MeV. This is the first indication of gluon contributions to\nnuclear structure that can not be associated with an individual nucleon.\n", "  This paper presents the mass assembly time scales of nearby galaxies observed\nby CALIFA at the 3.5m telescope in Calar Alto. We apply the fossil record\nmethod of the stellar populations to the complete sample of the 3rd CALIFA data\nrelease, with a total of 661 galaxies, covering stellar masses from 10$^{8.4}$\nto 10$^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and a wide range of Hubble types. We apply spectral\nsynthesis techniques to the datacubes and process the results to produce the\nmass growth time scales and mass weighted ages, from which we obtain temporal\nand spatially resolved information in seven bins of galaxy morphology and six\nbins of stellar mass (M$_{\\star}$) and stellar mass surface density\n($\\Sigma_{\\star}$). We use three different tracers of the spatially resolved\nstar formation history (mass assembly curves, ratio of half mass to half light\nradii, and mass-weighted age gradients) to test if galaxies grow inside-out,\nand its dependence with galaxy stellar mass, $\\Sigma_{\\star}$, and morphology.\nOur main results are as follows: (a) The innermost regions of galaxies assemble\ntheir mass at an earlier time than regions located in the outer parts; this\nhappens at any given M$_{\\star}$, $\\Sigma_{\\star}$, or Hubble type, including\nthe lowest mass systems. (b) Galaxies present a significant diversity in their\ncharacteristic formation epochs for lower-mass systems. This diversity shows a\nstrong dependence of the mass assembly time scales on $\\Sigma_{\\star}$ and\nHubble type in the lower-mass range (10$^{8.4}$ to 10$^{10.4}$), but a very\nmild dependence in higher-mass bins. (c) All galaxies show negative\n$\\langle$log age$\\rangle_{M}$ gradients in the inner 1 HLR. The profile\nflattens with increasing values of $\\Sigma_{\\star}$. There is no significant\ndependence on M$_{\\star}$ within a particular $\\Sigma_{\\star}$ bin, except for\nthe lowest bin, where the gradients becomes steeper.\n", "  Vibrational energy harvesters capture mechanical energy from ambient\nvibrations and convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy to power\nwireless electronic systems. Challenges exist in the process of capturing\nmechanical energy from ambient vibrations. For example, resonant harvesters may\nbe used to improve power output near their resonance, but their narrow\nbandwidth makes them less suitable for applications with varying vibrational\nfrequencies. Higher operating frequencies can increase harvesters power output,\nbut many vibrational sources are characterized by lower frequencies, such as\nhuman motions. This paper provides a thorough review of state of the art energy\nharvesters based on various energy sources such as solar, thermal,\nelectromagnetic and mechanical energy, as well as smart materials including\npiezoelectric materials and carbon nanotubes. The paper will then focus on\nvibrational energy harvesters to review harvesters using typical transduction\nmechanisms and various techniques to address the challenges in capturing\nmechanical energy and delivering it to the transducers.\n", "  Radially inward turbulent particle flux is observed in the core region of\ntarget plasma of Large Volume Plasma Device(LVPD). The region satisfy\nconditions for ETG turbulence, i.e. threshold condition, $ \\eta_e = L_{n_e} /\nL_{T_e} > 2/3 $ , where density scale length, $ L_{n_e} \\sim 300 cm $ and\ntemerature scale length, $ L_{T_e} \\sim 50cm $[S.K. Mattoo et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett., 108, 255007(2012)\\cite{Mattoo_PRL}]. The measured flux is dominantly\nelectrostatic ($\\Gamma_{es} \\approx 10^{5} \\Gamma_{em}$) although the nature of\nthe measured turbulence is electromagnetic($\\beta \\approx 0.6 $). The\nturbulence has been established as a consequence of electron temperature\ngradient (ETG) driven modes. Experimental observations of phase angle between\ndensity ($ n_e $) and potential ($\\phi $) fluctuations, $ \\theta_{\\tilde{n}_e,\n\\tilde{\\phi}} $ and electrostatic particle flux, $ \\Gamma_{es} $ shows good\nagreement with the corresponding theoretical estimates for ETG turbulence.\n", "  The technique of chemical tagging uses the elemental abundances of stellar\natmospheres to `reconstruct' chemically homogeneous star clusters that have\nlong since dispersed. The GALAH spectroscopic survey --which aims to observe\none million stars using the Anglo-Australian Telescope -- allows us to measure\nup to 30 elements or dimensions in the stellar chemical abundance space, many\nof which are not independent. How to find clustering reliably in a noisy\nhigh-dimensional space is a difficult problem that remains largely unsolved.\nHere we explore t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) -- which\nidentifies an optimal mapping of a high-dimensional space into fewer dimensions\n-- whilst conserving the original clustering information. Typically, the\nprojection is made to a 2D space to aid recognition of clusters by eye. We show\nthat this method is a reliable tool for chemical tagging because it can: (i)\nresolve clustering in chemical space alone, (ii) recover known open and\nglobular clusters with high efficiency and low contamination, and (iii) relate\nfield stars to known clusters. t-SNE also provides a useful visualization of a\nhigh-dimensional space. We demonstrate the method on a dataset of 13 abundances\nmeasured in the spectra of 187,000 stars by the GALAH survey. We recover 7 of\nthe 9 observed clusters (6 globular and 3 open clusters) in chemical space with\nminimal contamination from field stars and low numbers of outliers. With\nchemical tagging, we also identify two Pleiades supercluster members (which we\nconfirm kinematically), one as far as 6$^\\circ$ -- one tidal radius away from\nthe cluster centre.\n", "  One factor determining the reliability of measurements of electron\ntemperature using a Thomson scattering (TS) system is transmittance of the\noptical bandpass filters in polychromators. We investigate the system\nperformance as a function of electron temperature to determine reliable range\nof measurements for a given set of the optical bandpass filters. We show that\nsuch a reliability, i.e., both bias and random errors, can be obtained by\nbuilding a forward model of the KSTAR TS system to generate synthetic TS data\nwith the prescribed electron temperature and density profiles. The prescribed\nprofiles are compared with the estimated ones to quantify both bias and random\nerrors.\n", "  We report the synthesis and structural characterisation of three mixed-metal\nformate perovskite families [C(NH$_2$)$_3$]M$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$(HCOO)$_3$ (M = Mn,\nZn, Mg). Using a combination of infrared spectroscopy, non-negative matrix\nfactorization, and reverse Monte Carlo refinement, we show that the Mn- and\nZn-containing compounds support compositional nanodomains resembling the polar\nnanoregions of conventional relaxor ferroelectrics. The M = Mg family exhibits\na miscibility gap that we suggest reflects the limiting behaviour of nanodomain\nformation.\n", "  We describe a novel technique that renders theories of $N$ axions tractable,\nand more generally can be used to efficiently analyze a large class of periodic\npotentials of arbitrary dimension. Such potentials are complex energy\nlandscapes with a number of local minima that scales as $\\sqrt{N!}$, and so for\nlarge $N$ appear to be analytically and numerically intractable. Our method is\nbased on uncovering a set of approximate symmetries that exist in addition to\nthe $N$ periods. These approximate symmetries, which are exponentially close to\nexact, allow us to locate the minima very efficiently and accurately and to\nanalyze other characteristics of the potential. We apply our framework to\nevaluate the diameters of flat regions suitable for slow-roll inflation, which\nunifies, corrects and extends several forms of \"axion alignment\" previously\nobserved in the literature. We find that in a broad class of random theories,\nthe potential is smooth over diameters enhanced by $N^{3/2}$ compared to the\ntypical scale of the potential. A Mathematica implementation of our framework\nis available online.\n", "  We start with the recently conjectured 3d bosonization dualities and gauge\nglobal symmetries to generate an infinite sequence of new dualities. These\nequate theories with non-Abelian product gauge groups and bifundamental matter.\nWe uncover examples of Bose/Bose and Fermi/Fermi dualities, as well as a\nsequence of dualities between theories with scalar matter in two-index\nrepresentations. Our conjectures are consistent with level/rank duality in\nmassive phases.\n", "  We present a new implementation of the NNLO QCD corrections to three-jet\nfinal states and related event-shape observables in electron--positron\nannihilation. Our implementation is based on the antenna subtraction method,\nand is performed in the NNLOJET framework. The calculation improves upon\nearlier results by taking into account the full kinematical information on the\ninitial state momenta, thereby allowing the event orientation to be computed to\nNNLO accuracy. We find the event-orientation distributions at LEP and SLC to be\nvery robust under higher order QCD corrections.\n", "  The process $e^+e^- \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-2\\pi^0\\gamma$ is investigated by means of\nthe initial-state radiation technique, where a photon is emitted from the\nincoming electron or positron. Using $454.3 \\rm{fb}^{-1}$ of data collected\naround a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 10.58 \\rm{GeV}$ by the BaBar\nexperiment at SLAC, approximately 150000 signal events are obtained. The\ncorresponding non-radiative cross section is measured with a relative\nuncertainty of $3.6\\%$ in the energy region around $1.5 \\rm{GeV}$, surpassing\nall existing measurements in precision. Using this new result, the channel's\ncontribution to the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is calculated as\n$(g_\\mu^{\\pi^+\\pi^-2\\pi^0}-2)/2 = (17.9 \\pm 0.1_\\mathrm{stat} \\pm\n0.6_\\mathrm{syst}) \\times 10^{-10}$ in the energy range $0.85\\rm{GeV} <\nE_\\mathrm{CM} < 1.8\\rm{GeV}$. In the same energy range, the impact on the\nrunning of the fine structure constant at the $Z^0$-pole is determined as\n$\\Delta\\alpha^{\\pi^+\\pi^-2\\pi^0}(M^2_\\mathrm{Z}) = (4.44 \\pm 0.02_\\mathrm{stat}\n\\pm 0.14_\\mathrm{syst}) \\times 10^{-4}$. Furthermore, intermediate resonances\nare studied and especially the cross section of the process $e^+e^- \\to\n\\omega\\pi^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-2\\pi^0$ is measured.\n", "  We compute the holographic stress tensor and the logarithmic energy-momentum\ntensor of Einstein-Weyl gravity at the critical point. This computation is\ncarried out performing a holographic expansion in a bulk action supplemented by\nthe Gauss-Bonnet term with a fixed coupling. The renormalization scheme defined\nby the addition of this topological term has the remarkable feature that all\nEinstein modes are identically cancelled both from the action and its\nvariation. Thus, what remains comes from a nonvanishing Bach tensor, which\naccounts for non-Einstein modes associated to logarithmic terms which appear in\nthe expansion of the metric. In particular, we compute the holographic\n$1$-point functions for a generic boundary geometric source.\n", "  The phases of A$_2$Mn$_8$O$_{16}$ hollandite group oxides emerge from the\ncompetition between ionic interactions, Jahn-Teller effects, charge ordering,\nand magnetic interactions. Their balanced treatment with feasible computational\napproaches can be challenging for commonly used approximations in Density\nFunctional Theory. Three examples (A = Ag, Li and K) are studied with a\nsequence of different approximate exchange-correlation functionals. Starting\nfrom a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), an extension to include van\nder Waals interactions and a recently proposed meta-GGA are considered. Then\nlocal Coulomb interactions for the Mn $3d$ electrons are more explicitly\nconsidered with the DFT+$U$ approach. Finally selected results from a hybrid\nfunctional approach provide a reference. Results for the binding energy of the\nA species in the parent oxide highlight the role of van der Waals interactions.\nRelatively accurate results for insertion energies can be achieved with a low\n$U$ and a high $U$ approach. In the low $U$ case, the materials are described\nas band metals with a high symmetry, tetragonal crystal structure. In the high\n$U$ case, the electrons donated by A result in formation of local Mn$^{3+}$\ncenters and corresponding Jahn-Teller distortions characterized by a local\norder parameter. The resulting degree of monoclinic distortion depends on\ncharge ordering and magnetic interactions in the phase formed. The reference\nhybrid functional results show charge localization and ordering. Comparison to\nlow temperature experiments of related compounds suggests that charge\nlocalization is the physically correct result for the hollandite group oxides\nstudied here. . . .\n", "  We show that any Bell local state, with a hidden nonlocality that can be\nrevealed by local filtering, is more, or equally, entangled than nonlocal\nstates. More precisely, it can be deterministically transformed into a nonlocal\nstate, by local operations and classical communication. For such a state, there\nis a clear anomaly of nonlocality, for any measures of entanglement and\nnonlocality. Moreover, we prove that the hidden nonlocality of any bipartite\nstate more, or equally, entangled than nonlocal states, can be revealed by\nlocal operations and the sending of two one-bit messages, one in each\ndirection. For some particular states, one bit of communication is even enough.\n", "  Poisson-Lie dualising the eta deformation of the G/H symmetric space sigma\nmodel with respect to the simple Lie group G is conjectured to give an analytic\ncontinuation of the associated lambda deformed model. In this paper we\ninvestigate when the eta deformed model can be dualised with respect to a\nsubgroup G_0 of G. Starting from the first-order action on the complexified\ngroup and integrating out the degrees of freedom associated to different\nsubalgebras, we find it is possible to dualise when G_0 is associated to a\nsub-Dynkin diagram. Additional U_1 factors built from the remaining Cartan\ngenerators can also be included. The resulting construction unifies both the\nPoisson-Lie dual with respect to G and the complete abelian dual of the eta\ndeformation in a single framework, with the integrated algebras unimodular in\nboth cases. We speculate that extending these results to the path integral\nformalism may provide an explanation for why the eta deformed AdS_5 x S^5\nsuperstring is not one-loop Weyl invariant, that is the couplings do not solve\nthe equations of type IIB supergravity, yet its complete abelian dual and the\nlambda deformed model are.\n", "  The process of neutron-mirror neutron oscillation, motivated by symmetric\nmirror dark matter models, is governed by two parameters: $n-n'$ mixing\nparameter $\\delta$ and $n-n'$ mass splitting $\\Delta$. For neutron mirror\nneutron oscillation to be observable, the splitting between their masses\n$\\Delta$ must be small and current experiments lead to $\\delta \\leq 2\\times\n10^{-27}$ GeV and$\\Delta \\leq 10^{-24}$ GeV. We show that in mirror universe\nmodels where this process is observable, this small mass splitting constrains\nthe way that one must implement asymmetric inflation to satisfy the limits of\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis on the number of effective light degrees of freedom.\nIn particular we find that if asymmetric inflation is implemented by inflaton\ndecay to color or electroweak charged particles, the oscillation is\nunobservable. Also if one uses SM singlet fields for this purpose, they must be\nweakly coupled to the SM fields.\n", "  We consider space-time models with pure radiation, which admit integration of\nthe eikonal equation by the method of separation of variables. For all types of\nthese models, the equations of the energy-momentum conservation law were\nintegrated. The resulting form of metric, energy density and wave vectors of\nradiation as functions of metric for all types of spaces under consideration is\npresented. The solutions obtained can be used for any metric theories of\ngravitation.\n", "  A new aspect of understanding a Fano absorption spectrum is presented in\nterms of the complex spectral analysis. The absorption spectrum of an impurity\nembedded in semi-infinite superlattice is investigated. The boundary condition\non the continuum causes a large energy dependence of the self-energy, enhances\nthe nonlinearity of the eigenvalue problem of the effective Hamiltonian,\nyielding several nonanalytic resonance states. The overall spectral features is\nperfectly reproduced by the direct transitions to these discrete resonance\nstates. Even with a single optical transition path the spectrum exhibits an\nasymmetric Fano profile, which is enhanced for the transition to the\nnonanalytic resonance states. Since this is the genuine eigenstates of the\ntotal Hamiltonian, there is no ambiguity in the interpretation of the\nabsorption spectrum, avoiding the arbitrary interpretation based on the quantum\ninterference. The spectral change around the exceptional point is well\nunderstood when we extract the resonant state component.\n", "  We study the finite temperature properties of a recently introduced string\nbit model designed to capture some features of the emergent string in the\ntensionless limit. The model consists of a pair of bosonic and fermionic bit\noperators transforming in the adjoint representation of the color group SU(N).\nColor confinement is not achieved as a dynamical effect, but instead is\nenforced by an explicit singlet projection. At large N and finite temperature,\nthe model has a non trivial thermodynamics. In particular, there is a Hagedorn\ntype transition at a finite temperature $T=T_H$ where the string degrees of\nfreedom are liberated and the free energy gets a large contribution $\\sim\nN^{2}$ that plays the role of an order parameter. For $T>T_H$, the low\ntemperature phase becomes unstable. In the new phase, the thermodynamically\nfavoured configurations are characterized by a non-trivial gapped density of\nthe SU(N) angles associated with the singlet projection. We present an accurate\nalgorithm for the determination of the density profile at $N=\\infty$. In\nparticular, we determine the gap endpoint at generic temperature and analytical\nexpansions valid near the Hagedorn transition as well as at high temperature.\nThe leading order corrections are characterized by non-trivial exponents that\nare determined analytically and compared with explicit numerical calculations.\n", "  The folding of a protein towards its native state is a rather complicated\nprocess. However there are empirical evidences that the folding time correlates\nwith the contact order, a simple measure of the spatial organisation of the\nnative state of the protein. Contact order is related to the average length of\nthe main chain loops formed by amino acids which are in contact. Here we argue\nthat folding kinetics can be influenced also by the entanglement that loops may\nundergo within the overall three dimensional protein structure. In order to\nexplore such possibility, we introduce a novel descriptor, which we call\n\"maximum intrachain contact entanglement\". Specifically, we measure the maximum\nGaussian entanglement between any looped portion of a protein and any other\nnon-overlapping subchain of the same protein, which is easily computed by\ndiscretized line integrals on the coordinates of the $C_{\\alpha}$ atoms. By\nanalyzing experimental data sets of two-state and multistate folders, we show\nthat also the new index is a good predictor of the folding rate. Moreover,\nbeing only partially correlated with previous methods, it can be integrated\nwith them to yield more accurate predictions.\n", "  We build the electromagnetic trace anomaly effective term for a generalized\nlinear sigma model with two chiral nonets, one with a quark-antiquark\nstructure, the other one with a four quark content. In the leading order of\nthis framework, we study the decays into two photons of the lowest isosinglet\nscalar mesons. We find that the direct inclusion of underlying mixing among\ntwo- and four-quark components in the trace anomaly term is essential in order\nfor the model prediction to agree with the available experimental data on decay\nwidth of $f_0(980)$ to two photons. Consequently, this sets a lower bound of\n0.5 KeV on the decay with of $f_0(500)$ to two photons.\n", "  The Georgi-Machacek model is used to motivate and interpret LHC searches for\ndoubly- and singly-charged Higgs bosons decaying into vector boson pairs. In\nthis paper we study the constraints on and phenomenology of the \"H5plane\"\nbenchmark scenario in the Georgi-Machacek model, which has been proposed for\nuse in these searches. We show that the entire H5plane benchmark is compatible\nwith the LHC measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs boson couplings. We also point\nout that, over much of the H5plane benchmark, the lineshapes of the two CP-even\nneutral heavy Higgs bosons $H$ and $H_5^0$ will overlap and interfere when\nproduced in vector boson fusion with decays to $W^+W^-$ or $ZZ$. Finally we\ncompute the decay branching ratios of the additional heavy Higgs bosons within\nthe H5plane benchmark to facilitate the development of search strategies for\nthese additional particles.\n", "  We present a characterization of the many-body lattice wave functions\nobtained from the conformal blocks (CBs) of the Ising conformal field theory\n(CFT). The formalism is interpreted as a matrix product state using continuous\nancillary degrees of freedom. We provide analytic and numerical evidence that\nthe resulting states can be written as BCS states. We give a complete proof\nthat the translationally invariant 1D configurations have a BCS form and we\nfind suitable parent Hamiltonians. In particular, we prove that the ground\nstate of the finite-size critical Ising transverse field (ITF) Hamiltonian can\nbe obtained with this construction. Finally, we study 2D configurations using\nan operator product expansion (OPE) approximation. We associate these states to\nthe weak pairing phase of the $p+ip$ superconductor via the scaling of the\npairing function and the entanglement spectrum.\n", "  We describe a simple procedure for constructing a Lax pair for suitable\n2-dimensional $\\sigma$-models appearing in Poisson-Lie T-duality\n", "  We study the quantum many-body ground states of electrons on the half-filled\nhoneycomb lattice with short- and long-ranged density-density interactions as a\nmodel for graphene. To this end, we employ the recently developed\ntruncated-unity functional renormalization group (TU-fRG) approach which allows\nfor a high resolution of the interaction vertex' wavevector dependence. We\nconnect to previous lattice quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results which predict a\nstabilization of the semimetallic phase for realistic \\emph{ab initio}\ninteraction parameters and confirm that the application of a finite biaxial\nstrain can induce a quantum phase transition towards an ordered ground state.\nIn contrast to lattice QMC simulations, the TU-fRG is not limited in the choice\nof tight-binding and interaction parameters to avoid the occurrence of a sign\nproblem. Therefore, we also investigate a range of parameters relevant to the\nrealistic graphene material which are not accessible by numerically exact\nmethods. Although a plethora of charge density waves arise under medium-range\ninteractions, we find the antiferromagnetic spin-density wave to be the\nprevailing instability for long-range interactions. We further explore the\nimpact of an extended tight-binding Hamiltonian with second-nearest neighbor\nhopping and a finite chemical potential for a more accurate description of the\nband structure of graphene's $p_z$ electrons.\n", "  Explicit expressions are found for the $6j$ symbols in symmetric\nrepresentations of quantum $\\mathfrak{su}_N$ through appropriate hypergeometric\nAskey-Wilson (q-Racah) polynomials. This generalizes the well-known classical\nformulas for $U_q(\\mathfrak{su}_2)$ and provides a link to conformal theories\nand matrix models.\n", "  Recent results from RIKEN/RIBF on the low-lying level structure of 29F are\ninterpreted within the Particle-Rotor Model. We show that the experimental data\ncan be understood in the Rotation-aligned Coupling Scheme, with the 5/2+ ground\nstate as the bandhead of a decoupled band. In this picture, the energy of the\nobserved 1/2+1 state correlates strongly with the rotational energy of the core\nand provides an estimate of the 2+ energy in 28O. Our analysis suggest a\nmoderate deformation, epsilon_2 ~ 0.17, and places the 2+ in 28O at ~ 2.4 MeV.\n", "  We describe a study on the conceptual difficulties faced by college students\nin understanding hydrodynamics of ideal fluids. This study was based on\nresponses obtained in hundreds of written exams and oral interviews, which were\nheld with first-year Engineering and Science university students. Their\nresponses allowed us to identify a series of misconceptions unreported in the\nliterature so far. The study findings demonstrate that the most important\ndifficulties arise from the students' inability to establish a link between the\nkinematics and dynamics of moving fluids, and from a lack of understanding\nregarding how different regions of a system interact.\n", "  There are some particular one-dimensional models, such as the\nIsing-Heisenberg spin models with a variety of chain structures, which exhibit\nunexpected behaviors quite similar to the first and second order phase\ntransition, which could be confused naively with an authentic phase transition.\nThrough the analysis of the first derivative of free energy, such as entropy,\nmagnetization, and internal energy, a \"sudden\" jump that closely resembles a\nfirst-order phase transition at finite temperature occurs. However, by\nanalyzing the second derivative of free energy, such as specific heat and\nmagnetic susceptibility at finite temperature, it behaves quite similarly to a\nsecond-order phase transition exhibiting an astonishingly sharp and fine peak.\nThe correlation length also confirms the evidence of this pseudo-transition\ntemperature, where a sharp peak occurs at the pseudo-critical temperature. We\nalso present the necessary conditions for the emergence of these quasi-phases\nand pseudo-transitions.\n", "  For asymptotically flat spacetimes the Penrose inequality gives an initial\ndata test for the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis. We give a formulation of\nthis inequality for asymptotically anti-deSitter (AAdS) spacetimes, and show\nthat the inequality holds for time asymmetric data in spherical symmetry. Our\nanalysis is motivated by the constant-negative-spatial-curvature form of the\nAdS black hole metric.\n", "  We present 888 visual-wavelength spectra of 122 nearby type II supernovae\n(SNe II) obtained between 1986 and 2009, and ranging between 3 and 363 days\npost explosion. In this first paper, we outline our observations and data\nreduction techniques, together with a characterization based on the spectral\ndiversity of SNe~II. A statistical analysis of the spectral matching technique\nis discussed as an alternative to non-detection constraints for estimating SN\nexplosion epochs. The time evolution of spectral lines is presented and\nanalysed in terms of how this differs for SNe of different photometric,\nspectral, and environmental properties: velocities, pseudo-equivalent widths,\ndecline rates, magnitudes, time durations, and environment metallicity. Our\nsample displays a large range in ejecta expansion velocities, from $\\sim9600$\nto $\\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$ at 50 days post explosion with a median H$_{\\alpha}$\nvalue of 7300 km s$^{-1}$. This is most likely explained through differing\nexplosion energies. Significant diversity is also observed in the absolute\nstrength of spectral lines, characterised through their pseudo-equivalent\nwidths. This implies significant diversity in both temperature evolution\n(linked to progenitor radius) and progenitor metallicity between different\nSNe~II. Around 60\\% of our sample show an extra absorption component on the\nblue side of the H$_{\\alpha}$ P-Cygni profile (\"Cachito\" feature) between 7 and\n120 days since explosion. Studying the nature of Cachito, we conclude that\nthese features at early times (before $\\sim35$ days) are associated with\n\\ion{Si}{2} $\\lambda6355$, while past the middle of the plateau phase they are\nrelated to high velocity (HV) features of hydrogen lines.\n", "  The distribution of the hypervolume $V$ and surface $\\partial V$ of convex\nhulls of (multiple) random walks in higher dimensions are determined\nnumerically, especially containing probabilities far smaller than $P =\n10^{-1000}$ to estimate large deviation properties. For arbitrary dimensions\nand large walk lengths $T$, we suggest a scaling behavior of the distribution\nwith the length of the walk $T$ similar to the two-dimensional case, and\nbehavior of the distributions in the tails. We underpin both with numerical\ndata in $d=3$ and $d=4$ dimensions. Further, we confirm the analytically known\nmeans of those distributions and calculate their variances for large $T$.\n", "  We do a complete calculation of the stochastic gravitational wave background\nto be expected from cosmic strings. We start from a population of string loops\ntaken from simulations, smooth these by Lorentzian convolution as a model of\ngravitational back reaction, calculate the average spectrum of gravitational\nwaves emitted by the string population at any given time, and propagate it\nthrough a standard model cosmology to find the stochastic background today. We\ntake into account all known effects, including changes in the number of\ncosmological relativistic degrees of freedom at early times and the possibility\nthat some energy is in rare bursts that we might never have observed.\n", "  We explore the quasi-stationary profile of massive charged scalar field in a\nclass of charged black hole in dRGT massive gravity. We discuss how the linear\nterm in the metric which is a unique character of the dRGT massive gravity\naffects structure of the spacetime. Numerical calculations of the quasinormal\nmodes are performed for the charged scalar field in the dRGT black hole\nbackground. For asymptotically de Sitter (dS) black hole, an improved\nasymptotic iteration method is used to obtain the associated quasinormal\nfrequencies. The unstable modes are found for $\\ell=0$ case and their\ncorresponding real parts satisfy superradiant condition. For $\\ell=2$, the\nresults show that all the de Sitter black holes considered here are stable\nagainst a small perturbation. For asymptotically dRGT anti de Sitter (AdS)\nblack hole, unstable modes are found with the frequency satisfying superradiant\ncondition. Effects of massive gravity parameter are discussed. Analytic\ncalculation reveals unique diffusive nature of quasinormal modes in the massive\ngravity model with the linear term. Numerical results confirm existence of the\ncharacteristic diffusive modes in both dS and AdS cases.\n", "  We present an analysis of observed trends and correlations between a large\nrange of spectral and photometric parameters of more than 100 type II\nsupernovae (SNe~II), during the photospheric phase. We define a common epoch\nfor all SNe of 50 days post-explosion where the majority of the sample is\nlikely to be under similar physical conditions. Several correlation matrices\nare produced to search for interesting trends between more than 30 distinct\nlight-curve and spectral properties that characterize the diversity of SNe~II.\nOverall, SNe with higher expansion velocities are brighter, have more rapidly\ndeclining light-curves, shorter plateau durations, and higher $^{56}$Ni masses.\nUsing a larger sample than previous studies, we argue that `$Pd$' - the plateau\nduration from the transition of the initial to `plateau' decline rates to the\nend of the `plateau' - is a better indicator of the hydrogen envelope mass than\nthe traditionally used optically thick phase duration ($OPTd$: explosion epoch\nto end of plateau). This argument is supported by the fact that $Pd$ also\ncorrelates with s$_3$, the light-curve decline rate at late times: lower $Pd$\nvalues correlate with larger s$_3$ decline rates. Large s$_3$ decline rates are\nlikely related to lower envelope masses that enables gamma-ray escape. We also\nfind a significant anticorrelation between $Pd$ and s$_2$ (the plateau decline\nrate), confirming the long standing hypothesis that faster declining SNe~II\n(SNe~IIL) are the result of explosions with lower hydrogen envelope masses and\ntherefore have shorter $Pd$ values.\n", "  In the Lagrangian theory of guiding center motion, an effective magnetic\nfield $\\mathbf{B}^* = \\mathbf{B}+(m/e)v_\\parallel\\nabla \\times {\\mathbf{b}}$\nappears prominently in the equations of motion. Because the parallel component\nof this field can vanish, there is a range of parallel velocities where the\nLagrangian guiding center equations of motion are either ill-defined or very\nbadly behaved. Moreover, the velocity dependence of $\\mathbf{B}^*$ greatly\ncomplicates the identification of canonical variables, and therefore the\nformulation of symplectic integrators for guiding center dynamics. This Letter\nintroduces a simple coordinate transformation that alleviates both of these\nproblems simultaneously. In the new coordinates, the Liouville volume element\nis equal to the toroidal cotravariant component of the magnetic field.\nConsequently, the large-velocity singularity is completely eliminated.\nMoreover, passing from the new coordinate system to canonical coordinates is\nextremely simple, even if the magnetic field is devoid of flux surfaces. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this approach to regularizing the guiding center\nLagrangian by presenting a new and stable one-step variational integrator for\nguiding centers moving in arbitrary time-dependent electromagnetic fields.\n", "  Uphill currents are observed when mass diffuses in the direction of the\ndensity gradient. We study this phenomenon in stationary conditions in the\nframework of locally perturbed 1D Zero Range Processes (ZRP). We show that the\nonset of currents flowing from the reservoir with smaller density to the one\nwith larger density can be caused by a local asymmetry in the hopping rates on\na single site at the center of the lattice. For fixed injection rates at the\nboundaries, we prove that a suitable tuning of the asymmetry in the bulk may\ninduce uphill diffusion at arbitrarily large, finite volumes. We also deduce\nheuristically the hydrodynamic behavior of the model and connect the local\nasymmetry characterizing the ZRP dynamics to a matching condition relevant for\nthe macroscopic problem.\n", "  Almost 20 % of the ~ 200 different species detected in the interstellar and\ncircumstellar media present a carbon atom linked to nitrogen by a triple bond.\nOf these 37 molecules, 30 are nitrile R-CN compounds, the remaining 7 belonging\nto the isonitrile R-NC family. How these species behave in their interactions\nwith the grain surfaces is still an open question. In a previous work, we have\ninvestigated whether the difference between nitrile and isonitrile functional\ngroups may induce differences in the adsorption energies of the related isomers\nat the surfaces of interstellar grains of various nature and morphologies. This\nstudy is a follow up of this work, where we focus on the adsorption on\ncarbonaceous aromatic surfaces. The question is addressed by means of a\nconcerted experimental and theoretical approach of the adsorption energies of\nCH$_3$CN and CH$_3$NC on the surface of graphite (with and without surface\ndefects). The experimental determination of the molecule and surface\ninteraction energies is carried out using temperature-programmed desorption\n(TPD) in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) between 70 and 160 K. Theoretically, the\nquestion is addressed using first-principle periodic density functional theory\n(DFT) to represent the organised solid support. The adsorption energy of each\ncompound is found to be very sensitive to the structural defects of the\naromatic carbonaceous surface: these defects, expected to be present in a large\nnumbers and great diversity on a realistic surface, significantly increase the\naverage adsorption energies to more than 50\\% as compared to adsorption on\nperfect graphene planes. The most stable isomer (CH$_3$CN) interacts more\nefficiently with the carbonaceous solid support than the higher energy isomer\n(CH$_3$NC), however.\n", "  We present the abundances of Li, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co,\nNi, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba in a wide metallicity range ($-2.8 \\le$ [Fe/H] $\\le\n-1.5$). Using the differential technique allowed us to obtain an unprecedented\nlow level of scatter in our analysis, with standard deviations as low as 0.05\ndex, and mean errors as low as 0.05 dex for [X/Fe]. By expanding our\nmetallicity range with precise abundances from other works, we were able to\nprecisely constrain Galactic chemical evolution models in a wide metallicity\nrange ($-3.6 \\le$ [Fe/H] $\\le -0.4$). The agreements and discrepancies found\nare key for further improvement of both models and observations. We also show\nthat the LTE analysis of Cr II is a much more reliable source of abundance for\nchromium, as Cr I has important NLTE effects. These effects can be clearly seen\nwhen we compare the observed abundances of Cr I and Cr II with GCE models.\nWhile Cr I has a clear disagreement between model and observations, Cr II is\nvery well modeled. We confirm tight increasing trends of Co and Zn toward lower\nmetallicities, and a tight flat evolution of Ni relative to Fe. Our results\nstrongly suggest inhomogeneous enrichment from hypernovae. Our precise stellar\nparameters results in a low star-to-star scatter ($0.04$ dex) in the Li\nabundances of our sample, with a mean value about $0.4$ dex lower than the\nprediction from standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis; we also study the relation\nbetween lithium depletion and stellar mass, but it is difficult to assess a\ncorrelation due to the limited mass range. We find two blue straggler stars,\nbased on their very depleted Li abundances. One of them shows intriguing\nabundance anomalies, including a possible zinc enhancement, suggesting that\nzinc may have been also produced by a former AGB companion.\n", "  We present a model-dependent method to estimate the redshifts of three TeV BL\nLac objects (BL Lacs) through fltting their (quasi-) simultaneous\nmulti-waveband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) by one-zone leptonic\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Considering the impact of electron energy\ndistributions (EEDs) on the results, we use three types of EEDs, such as the\npower-law EED with exponential cut-ofi (PLC), the log-parabola (PLLP) and the\nbroken power-law (BPL) EEDs, to flt the SEDs. We also use a parameter fi to\ndescribe the uncertainties of the extragalactic background light (EBL) models,\nas in (Abdo et al. 2010b). We then use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method\nto explore multi-dimensional parameter space and obtain the uncertainties of\nthe model parameters based on the observational data. We apply our method to\nobtain the redshifts of three TeV BL Lac objects in the marginalized 68%\nconfldence, and flnd that the PLC EED does not flt the SEDs. For 3C66A, the\nredshift is 0.14 - 0.31 and 0.16 - 0.32 in the BPL and PLLP EEDs; for\nPKS1424+240, the redshift is 0.55 - 0.68 and 0.55 - 0.67 in the BPL and PLLP\nEEDs; for PG1553+113, the redshift is 0.22 - 0.48 and 0.22 - 0.39 in the BPL\nand PLLP EEDs. We also estimate the redshift of PKS1424+240 in the high stage\nto be 0.46 - 0.67 in the PLLP EED, roughly consistent with that in the low\nstage.\n", "  Determining the physical properties of microlensing events depends on having\naccurate angular sizes of the source star. Using long-baseline optical\ninterferometry we are able to measure the angular sizes of nearby stars with\nuncertainties $\\leq 2\\%$. We present empirically derived relations of angular\ndiameters that are calibrated using both a sample of dwarfs/subgiants and a\nsample of giant stars. These relations are functions of five color indices in\nthe visible and near-infrared, and have uncertainties of 1.8-6.5% depending on\nthe color used. We find that a combined sample of both main-sequence and\nevolved stars of A-K spectral types is well fit by a single relation for each\ncolor considered. We find that in the colors considered, metallicity does not\nplay a statistically significant role in predicting stellar size, leading to a\nmeans of predicting observed sizes of stars from color alone.\n", "  Projection of many-body states with good angular momentum from an initial\nstate is usually accomplished by a three-dimensional integral. We show how\nprojection can instead be done by solving a straightforward system of linear\nequations. We demonstrate the method and give sample applications to $^{48}$Cr\nand $^{60}$Fe in the $pf$ shell. This new projection scheme, which is\ncompetitive against the standard numerical quadrature, should also be\napplicable to other quantum numbers such as isospin and particle number.\n", "  The primary purpose of this paper is to stimulate theoretical predictions of\nhow to retain metastably hydrogenous materials made at high pressure P on\nrelease to ambient. Ultracondensed metallic hydrogen has been made at 140 GPa\nat finite temperatures T in the fluid. The term metallic here means quantum\nmechanically degenerate. A single sample of ultracondensed hydrogen has been\nmade at an estimated pressure of 495 GPa at 5.5 K. Whether that sample is solid\nor fluid remains to be determined. Those results imply the long quest for\nmetallic hydrogen is likely to be concluded in the relatively near future.\nBecause the quest for metallic hydrogen has been a major driver of high\npressure research for decades, a logical question is whether another research\ndirection, comparable in scale to that quest, will arise in high pressure\nresearch in the future.\n  One possibility is retention of metastable solid metallic hydrogen and other\nhydrogenous materials on release of P and T to ambient. If hydrogenous\nmaterials could be retained metastably in the solid on release, those materials\nwould be a new class of materials for scientific investigations and\ntechnological applications. This paper is a brief review of the synthesis of\nmetallic hydrogen, potential technological applications of metastable solid\nmetallic H and other hydrogenous materials at ambient, and published\nexperimental and theoretical results as general background for what has been\naccomplished with metastable phases in the past, which suggests what might be\naccomplished in the future.\n", "  For the first time, based on long-term spectral monitoring with high spectral\nresolution, the optical spectrum of the weak central star of the IR source\nRAFGL 5081 has been studied. The spectral type of this star is close to G5-8\nII, and its effective temperature is Teff ~5400 K. An unusual spectral\nphenomenon was discovered: splitting of the profiles of broad, stationary\nabsorption lines of medium and low intensity. The heliocentric radial\nvelocities Vr of all components of metal absorption lines, the NaI D lines, and\nthe H$\\alpha$ line were measured for all the observation epochs. The constancy\nof the absorption lines rules out the possibility that the line splitting is\ndue to binarity. The radial velocities of the wind components in the profiles\nof the NaI D and H$\\alpha$ lines reach $-250$ and $-600$ km/s, respectively.\nThese profiles have narrow components, whose number, depth, and position vary\nwith time. The time variability and multicomponent structure of the profiles of\nthe NaI D and H$\\alpha$ lines indicates inhomogeneity and instability of the\ncircumstellar envelope of RAFGL 5081. The presence of components with velocity\nVr(IS)=$-65$ km/s in the NaI(1) lines provides evidence that RAFGL 5081 is\nlocated behind the Perseus arm, i.e., no closer than 2 kpc. It is noted that\nRAFGL 5081 is associated with the reflection nebula GN 02.44.7.\n", "  Materials design based on first-principles electronic calculations has proven\na fruitful strategy to identify new thermoelectric materials with a favorable\nfigure of merit. Recent electronic structure calculations predict that in\ncobalt-based half-Heusler systems a power factor higher than in CoTiSb can be\nachieved upon p-type doping of CoVSn, CoNbSn, CoTaSn, CoMoIn, and CoWIn. Here,\nusing a first-principles approach and semi-classical Boltzmann transport\ntheory, we investigate the electrical and thermal transport properties of these\nmaterials. The calculated thermal conductivity at room temperature of all the\nsystems is lower than that of CoTiSb, with CoMoIn and CoWIn having an almost\n3-fold lower thermal conductivity than CoTiSb. We also provide conservative\nestimates of the figure of merit for these systems which all turn out to be\nhigher than in CoTiSb and to have a maximum value for CoWIn.\n", "  In front of a mirror, the radiation of weakly driven large disordered clouds\npresents an interference fringe in the backward direction, on top of an\nincoherent background. Although strongly driven atoms usually present little\ncoherent scattering, we here show that the mirror-assisted version can produce\nhigh contrast fringes, for arbitrarily high saturation parameters. The contrast\nof the fringes oscillates with the Rabi frequency of the atomic transition and\nthe distance between the mirror and the atoms, due to the coherent interference\nbetween the carrier and the Mollow sidebands of the saturated resonant\nfluorescence spectrum emitted by the atoms. The setup thus represents a\npowerful platform to study the spectral properties of ensembles of correlated\nscatterers.\n", "  Anion exchange at positively charged interfaces plays an important role in a\nvariety of physical and chemical processes. However, the molecular scale\ndetails of these processes, especially with heavy and large anionic complexes,\nare not well-understood. We studied the adsorption of $PtCl_6^{2-}$ anionic\ncomplexes to floating DPTAP monolayers in the presence of excess $Cl^-$ as a\nfunction of the bulk chlorometalate concentration. In situ x-ray scattering and\nfluorescence measurements, which are element and depth sensitive, show that the\nchlorometalate ions only adsorb in the diffuse layer at lower concentrations,\nwhile they adsorb predominantly in the Stern layer at higher concentrations.\nThe response of DPTAP molecules to the adsorbed ions is determined\nindependently by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, and supports this\npicture. Molecular dynamics simulations further elucidate the nanoscale\nstructure of the interfacial complexes. The results suggest that ion hydration\nand ion-ion correlations play a key role in the competitive adsorption process.\n", "  Finding concrete realizations for topologically nontrivial chiral\nsuperconductivity has been a long-standing goal in quantum matter research.\nHere we propose a route to a systematic realization of chiral superconductivity\nwith nonzero Chern numbers. This goal can be achieved in a nanomagnet lattice\ndeposited on top of a spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)\nwith proximity s-wave superconductivity. The proposed structure can be regarded\nas a universal platform for chiral superconductivity supporting a large variety\nof topological phases. The topological state of the system can be electrically\ncontrolled by, for example, tuning the density of the 2DEG.\n", "  Context. Important information on the evolution of the jet can be obtained by\ncomparing the physical state of the plasma at its propagation through the\nbroad-line region (where the jet is most likely formed) into the intergalactic\nmedium, where it starts to significantly decelerate. Aims. We compare the\nconstraints on the physical parameters in the innermost ($\\leq$ pc) and outer\n($\\geq$ kpc) regions of the 3C 120 jet by means of a detailed multiwavelength\nanalysis and theoretical modeling of their broadband spectra. Methods.The data\ncollected by Fermi LAT, Swift and Chandra are analyzed together and the\nspectral energy distributions are modeled using a leptonic synchrotron and\ninverse Compton model, taking into account the seed photons originating inside\nand outside of the jet. The model parameters are estimated using the MCMC\nmethod. Results. The $\\gamma$-ray flux from the inner jet of 3C 120 was\ncharacterized by rapid variation from MJD 56900 to MJD 57300. Two strong flares\nwere observed on April 24, 2015 when, within 19.0 minutes and 3.15 hours the\nflux was as high as $(7.46\\pm1.56)\\times10^{-6}photon\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}$ and\n$(4.71\\pm0.92)\\times10^{-6}photon\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}$ respectively. The broadband\nemission in the quiet and flaring states can be described as SSC emission while\nIC scattering of dusty torus photons cannot be excluded for the flaring states.\nThe X-ray emission from the knots can be well reproduced by IC scattering of\nCMB photons only if the jet is highly relativistic (since even when $\\delta=10$\nstill $U_{\\rm e}/U_B\\geq80$). These extreme requirements can be somewhat\nsoftened assuming the X-rays are from the synchrotron emission of a second\npopulation of very-high-energy electrons. Conclusions. We found that the jet\npower estimated at two scales is consistent, suggesting that the jet does not\nsuffer severe dissipation, it simply becomes radiatively inefficient.\n", "  We present a thorough theoretical analysis and experimental study of the shot\nand electronic noise spectra of a balanced optical detector based on an\noperational amplifier (OA) connected in a transimpedance scheme. We identify\nand quantify the primary parameters responsible for the limitations of the\ncircuit, in particular the bandwidth and shot-to-electronic noise clearance. We\nfind that the shot noise spectrum can be made consistent with the second order\nButterworth filter, while the electronic noise grows linearly with the second\npower of the frequency. Good agreement between the theory and experiment is\nobserved, however the capacitances of the operational amplifier input and the\nphotodiodes appear significantly higher than those specified in manufacturers'\ndatasheets. This observation is confirmed by independent tests.\n", "  In heterogeneous environments, the diffusivity is not constant but changes\nwith time. It is important to detect changes in the diffusivity from\nsingle-particle-tracking trajectories in experiments. Here, we devise a novel\nmethod for detecting the transition times of the diffusivity from trajectory\ndata. A key idea of this method is the introduction of a characteristic time\nscale of the diffusive states, which is obtained by a fluctuation analysis of\nthe time-averaged mean square displacements. We test our method in silico by\nusing the Langevin equation with a fluctuating diffusivity. We show that our\nmethod can successfully detect the transition times of diffusive states and\nobtain the diffusion coefficient as a function of time. This method will\nprovide a quantitative description of the fluctuating diffusivity in\nheterogeneous environments and can be applied to time series with transitions\nof states.\n", "  The twofold twist defects in the $D(\\mathbb{Z}_k)$ quantum double model\n(abelian topological phase) carry non-abelian fractional Majorana-like\ncharacteristics. We align these twist defects in a line and construct a one\ndimensional Hamiltonian which only includes the pairwise interaction. For the\ndefect chain with even number of twist defects, it is equivalent to the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_k$ clock model with periodic boundary condition (up to some phase\nfactor for boundary term), while for odd number case, it maps to $\\mathbb{Z}_k$\nclock model with duality twisted boundary condition. At critical point, for\nboth cases, the twist defect chain enjoys an additional translation symmetry,\nwhich corresponds to the Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry in the $\\mathbb{Z}_k$\nclock model and can be generated by a series of braiding operators for twist\ndefects. We further numerically investigate the low energy excitation spectrum\nfor $k=3,~4,~5$ and $6$. For even-defect chain, the critical points are the\nsame as the $\\mathbb{Z}_k$ clock conformal field theories (CFTs), while for\nodd-defect chain, when $k\\neq 4$, the critical points correspond to orbifolding\na $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of CFTs of the even-defect chain. For $k=4$ case, we\nnumerically observe some similarity to the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ twist fields in\n$SU(2)_1/D_4$ orbifold CFT.\n", "  We report on first-principle based studies of the adsorption interaction of\nastatine species on a gold surface. These studies are aimed primarily at the\nsupport and interpretation of gas chromatographic experiments with Superheavy\nElements, tennessine (Ts, $Z=117$) as the heavier homologue of At and possibly\nnihonium (Nh, $Z=113$) as its pseudo-homologue. The adsorption energies of\nelemental astatine or the corresponding monohydroxide on a stable gold (111)\nsurface are estimated using gold clusters with up to 69 atoms in order to\nsimulate the adsorption site. To simulate the electronic structure of $\\rm\nAt-Au_n$ and $\\rm AtOH-Au_n$ complexes, we combine accurate shape-consistent\nrelativistic pseudopotentials and non-collinear two-component relativistic\ndensity functional theory. The predicted adsorption energies for At and AtOH on\ngold are $\\rm 130 \\pm 10$ kJ/mol and $\\rm 90 \\pm 10$ kJ/mol, respectively.\n", "  In Lorentz violating theories of gravitation with a preferred foliation a\nnotion of black hole is still possible, despite the presence of infinitely fast\npropagating modes. Such event horizons are known as universal horizons. Their\ndiscovery poses the question of whether they satisfy mechanical laws, analogous\nto the ones of Killing horizons in Lorentz symmetric theories, and whether they\nadmit a thermodynamical interpretation. In this paper we study the viability of\nthe first law for several exact universal horizon solutions previously derived\nin the literature. Our results show that a simple mechanical and\nthermodynamical interpretation is problematic in these cases, and call for a\nmore systematic study of rotating universal horizons.\n", "  Motivated by recent reports concerning the observation of limited enrichment\nin He but excess K in stars of globular clusters, we revisit the H-burning\nconditions that lead to the chemical properties of multiple stellar populations\nin these systems. In particular, we are interested in correlations of He and K\nwith other elements, like O, Na, Al, Mg and Si, reported in stars of NGC 2808.\nWe perform calculations of nucleosynthesis at constant temperature and density,\nexploring the temperature range of 25 to 200 10$^6$ K (25 to 200 MK), using a\ndetailed nuclear reaction network and the most up-to-date nuclear reaction\nrates. We find that Mg is the most sensitive \"thermometer\" of hydrostatic\nH-burning conditions, pointing to a temperature range of 70-80 MK for NGC~2808,\nwhile He is a lesser - but not negligible - constraint. K can be produced at\nthe levels reported for NGC 2808 at temperatures $>$180 MK and Si at T$>$80 MK.\nHowever, in the former temperature range Al and Na are totally destroyed and no\ncorrelation can be obtained, in contrast to the reported observations. None of\nthe putative polluter sources proposed so far seem to satisfy the ensemble of\nnucleosynthesis constraints.\n", "  Two correlation functions of Yang-Mills beyond the primitively divergent\nones, the two-ghost-two-gluon and the four-ghost vertices, are calculated and\ntheir influence on lower vertices is examined. Their full (transverse) tensor\nstructure is taken into account. As input, a solution of the full two-point\nequations - including two-loop terms - is used that respects the resummed\nperturbative ultraviolet behavior. A clear hierarchy is found with regard to\nthe color structure that reduces the number of relevant dressing functions. The\nimpact of the two-ghost-two-gluon vertex on the three-gluon vertex is\nnegligible, which is explained by the fact that all non-small dressing\nfunctions drop out due to their color factors. Only in the ghost-gluon vertex a\nsmall net effect below $2\\%$ is seen. The four-ghost vertex is found to be\nextremely small in general. Since these two four-point functions do not enter\ninto the propagator equations, these findings establish their small overall\neffect on lower correlation functions.\n", "  We study the feedback of star formation and nuclear activity on the chemistry\nof molecular gas in NGC1068, a nearby (D=14Mpc) Seyfert 2 barred galaxy, by\nanalyzing if the abundances of key molecular species like ethynyl (C2H), a\nclassical tracer of PDR, change in the different environments of the disk of\nthe galaxy. We have used ALMA to map the emission of the hyperfine multiplet of\nC2H(N=1-0) and its underlying continuum emission in the central\nr~35\"(2.5kpc)-region of the disk of NGC1068 with a spatial resolution\n1.0\"x0.7\"(50-70pc). We have developed a set of time-dependent chemical models\nto determine the origin of the C2H gas. A sizeable fraction of the total C2H\nline emission is detected from the r~1.3kpc starburst (SB) ring. However, the\nbrightest C2H emission originates from a r~200pc off-centered circumnuclear\ndisk (CND), where evidence of a molecular outflow has been previously found in\nother molecular tracers imaged by ALMA. We also detect significant emission\nthat connects the CND with the outer disk. We derived the fractional abundances\nof C2H (X(C2H)) assuming LTE conditions. Our estimates range from X(C2H)~a few\n10^-8 in the SB ring up to X(C2H)~ a few 10^-7 in the outflow region. PDR\nmodels that incorporate gas-grain chemistry are able to account for X(C2H) in\nthe SB ring for moderately dense (n(H2)>10^4 cm^-3) and moderately\nUV-irradiated gas (UV-field<10xDraine field) in a steady-state regime. However,\nthe high fractional abundances estimated for C2H in the outflow region can only\nbe reached at very early times (T< 10^2-10^3 yr) in models of UV/X-ray\nirradiated dense gas (n(H2)>10^4-10^5) cm^-3). We interpret that the transient\nconditions required to fit the high values of X(C2H) in the outflow are likely\ndue to UV/X-ray irradiated non-dissociative shocks associated with the highly\nturbulent interface between the outflow and the molecular gas in NGC1068.\n", "  In this Letter, we mainly investigate the dynamic behavior of quantum\nsteering and how to effectively recover the lost steerability of quantum states\nwithin non-Markovian environments. We consider two different cases\n(one-subsystem or all-subsystem interacts with the dissipative environments),\nand obtain that the dynamical interaction between system initialized by a\nWerner state and the non-Markovian environments can induce the quasi-periodic\nquantum entanglement (concurrence) resurgence, however, quantum steering cannot\nretrieve in such a condition. And we can obtain that the resurgent quantum\nentanglement cannot be utilized to achieve quantum steering. Subsequently, we\nput forward a feasible physical scheme for recovering the steerability of\nquantum states within the non-Markovian noises by prior weak measurement on\neach subsystem before the interaction with dissipative environments followed by\npost weak measurement reversal. It is shown that the steerability of quantum\nstates and the fidelity can be effectively restored. Furthermore, the results\nshow that the larger the weak measurement strength is, the better the\neffectiveness of the scheme is. Consequently, our investigations might be\nbeneficial to recover the lost steerability of quantum states within the\nnon-Markovian regimes.\n", "  We apply a generic formalism of light propagation to linearly perturbed\nspherically symmetric dust models including a cosmological constant. For a\ncomoving observer on the central worldline, we derive the equation of geodesic\ndeviation and perform a suitable spherical harmonic decomposition. This allows\nto map the abstract gauge-invariant perturbation variables to well-known\nquantities from weak gravitational lensing like convergence or cosmic shear.\nThe resulting set of differential equations can effectively be solved by a\nGreen's function approach leading to line-of-sight integrals sourced by the\nperturbation variables on the backward lightcone. The resulting spherical\nharmonic coefficients of the lensing observables are presented and the shear\nfield is decomposed into its E- and B-modes. Results of this work are an\nessential tool to add information from linear structure formation to the\nanalysis of spherically symmetric dust models with the purpose of testing the\nCopernican Principle with multiple cosmological probes.\n", "  We show that dual conformal symmetry, mainly studied in planar $\\mathcal N =\n4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, has interesting consequences for Feynman integrals\nin nonsupersymmetric theories such as QCD, including the nonplanar sector. A\nsimple observation is that dual conformal transformations preserve unitarity\ncut conditions for any planar integrals, including those without dual conformal\nsymmetry. Such transformations generate differential equations without raised\npropagator powers, often with the right hand side of the system proportional to\nthe dimensional regularization parameter $\\epsilon$. A nontrivial subgroup of\ndual conformal transformations, which leaves all external momenta invariant,\ngenerates integration-by-parts relations without raised propagator powers,\nreproducing, in a simpler form, previous results from computational algebraic\ngeometry for several examples with up to two loops and five legs. By opening up\nthe two-loop three- and four-point nonplanar diagrams into planar ones, we find\na nonplanar analog of dual conformal symmetry. As for the planar case this is\nused to generate integration-by-parts relations and differential equations.\nThis implies that the symmetry is tied to the analytic properties of the\nnonplanar sector of the two-loop four-point amplitude of $\\mathcal N = 4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  We discuss USp(2n) supersymmetric models with eight fundamental fields and a\nfield in the antisymmetric representation. Turning on the most generic\nsuperpotentials, coupling pairs of fundamental fields to powers of the\nantisymmetric field while preserving an R symmetry, we give evidence for the\nstatement that the models are connected by a large network of dualities which\ncan be organized into orbits of the Weyl group of E_8. We make also several\ncurious observations about such models. In particular, we argue that a USp(2m)\nmodel with the addition of singlet fields and even rank m flows in the IR to a\nCFT with E_7 U(1) symmetry. We also discuss an infinite number of duals for the\nUSp(2) theory with eight fundamentals and no superpotential.\n", "  Context. Transit events of extrasolar planets offer the opportunity to study\nthe composition of their atmospheres. Previous work on transmission\nspectroscopy of the close-in gas giant TrES-3 b revealed an increase in\nabsorption towards blue wavelengths of very large amplitude in terms of\natmospheric pressure scale heights, too large to be explained by\nRayleigh-scattering in the planetary atmosphere. Aims. We present a follow-up\nstudy of the optical transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter TrES-3 b to\ninvestigate the strong increase in opacity towards short wavelengths found by a\nprevious study. Furthermore, we aim to estimate the effect of stellar spots on\nthe transmission spectrum. Methods. This work uses previously published long\nslit spectroscopy transit data of the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and\npublished broad band observations as well as new observations in different\nbands from the near-UV to the near-IR, for a homogeneous transit light curve\nanalysis. Additionally, a long-term photometric monitoring of the TrES-3 host\nstar was performed. Results. Our newly analysed GTC spectroscopic transit\nobservations show a slope of much lower amplitude than previous studies. We\nconclude from our results the previously reported increasing signal towards\nshort wavelengths is not intrinsic to the TrES-3 system. Furthermore, the broad\nband spectrum favours a flat spectrum. Long-term photometric monitoring rules\nout a significant modification of the transmission spectrum by unocculted star\nspots.\n", "  The technique of one-loop calculations for the processes involving Reggeized\nquarks is described in the framework of gauge invariant effective field theory\nfor the Multi-Regge limit of QCD, which has been introduced by Lipatov and\nVyazovsky. The rapidity divergences, associated with the terms enhanced by\n$\\log (s)$, appear in the loop corrections in this formalism. The covariant\nprocedure of regularization of rapidity divergences, preserving the gauge\ninvariance of effective action is described. As an example application, the\none-loop correction to the propagator of Reggeized quark and $\\gamma Q\nq$-scattering vertex are computed. Obtained results are used to construct the\nRegge limit of one-loop $\\gamma\\gamma\\to q\\bar q$ amplitude. The cancellation\nof rapidity divergences and consistency of the effective field theory\nprediction with the full QCD result is demonstrated. The rapidity\nrenormalization group within the effective field theory is discussed.\n", "  We have studied the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect in a polar\nantiferromagnet $\\alpha$-Cu$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{7}$ in contact with a Pt film.\nBelow the antiferromagnetic transition temperature of\n$\\alpha$-Cu$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{7}$, spin Seebeck voltages whose magnetic field\ndependence is similar to that reported in antiferromagnetic MnF$_{2}$$\\mid$Pt\nbilayers are observed. Though a small weak-ferromagnetic moment appears owing\nto the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in $\\alpha$-Cu$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{7}$,\nthe magnetic field dependence of spin Seebeck voltages is found to be\nirrelevant to the weak ferromagnetic moments. The dependences of the spin\nSeebeck voltages on magnetic fields and temperature are analyzed by a magnon\nspin current theory. The numerical calculation of spin Seebeck voltages using\nmagnetic parameters of $\\alpha$-Cu$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{7}$ determined by previous\nneutron scattering studies reveals that the magnetic-field and temperature\ndependences of the spin Seebeck voltages for\n$\\alpha$-Cu$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{7}$$\\mid$Pt are governed by the changes in magnon\nlifetimes with magnetic fields and temperature.\n", "  Based on $448.1 \\times 10^6$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII\ndetector, the decays $\\psi(3686)\\to\\gamma\\chi_{cJ}, \\chi_{cJ} \\to\n\\gamma\\gamma~(J=0, 1, 2)$ are studied. The decay branching fractions of\n$\\chi_{c0,c2} \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ are measured to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c0}\\to\\gamma\\gamma) = (1.93 \\pm 0.08 \\pm 0.05 \\pm\n0.05)\\times 10^{-4}$ and $\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c2}\\to\\gamma\\gamma) = (3.10 \\pm\n0.09 \\pm 0.07 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-4} $, which correspond to two-photon decay\nwidths of $\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\chi_{c0}) = 2.03 \\pm 0.08 \\pm 0.06 \\pm 0.13\n~\\rm{keV}$ and $\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\chi_{c2}) = 0.60 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.01 \\pm\n0.04 ~\\rm{keV}$ with a ratio of\n$\\mathcal{R}=\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\chi_{c2})/\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\chi_{c0})=\n0.295 \\pm 0.014 \\pm 0.007 \\pm 0.027$, where the uncertainties are statistical,\nsystematic and associated with the uncertainties of\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(3686)\\to\\gamma\\chi_{c0,c2})$ and the total widths\n$\\Gamma(\\chi_{c0,c2})$, respectively. For the forbidden decay of\n$\\chi_{c1}\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, no signal is observed, and an upper limit on the\ntwo-photon width is obtained to be $\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\chi_{c1})<5.3\n~\\rm{eV}$ at the 90\\% confidence level. The ratio of the two-photon widths\nbetween helicity-zero and helicity-two components in the decay\n$\\chi_{c2}\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ is also measured to be $f_{0/2} =\n\\Gamma^{\\lambda=0}_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\chi_{c2})/\\Gamma^{\\lambda=2}_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\chi_{c2})\n= (0.0 \\pm 0.6 \\pm 1.2)\\times 10^{-2}$, where the uncertainties are statistical\nand systematic, respectively.\n", "  The sensitivity of ALMA makes it possible to detect thermal mm/submm emission\nfrom small/distant Solar System bodies at the sub-mJy level. Measured fluxes\nare primarily sensitive to the objects' diameters, but deriving precise sizes\nis somewhat hampered by the uncertain effective emissivity at these\nwavelengths. Following Brown and Butler (2017) who presented ALMA data for four\nbinary TNOs, we report ALMA 1.29 mm measurements of four Centaurs (2002\nGZ$_{32}$, Bienor, Chiron, Chariklo) and two TNOs (Huya and Makemake), sampling\na range of size, albedo and composition. These thermal fluxes are combined with\nmid/far-infrared fluxes to derive the relative emissivity at radio (mm/submm)\nwavelengths, using NEATM and thermophysical models. We reassess earlier thermal\nmeasurements of these and other objects -- including Pluto/Charon and Varuna --\nexploring effects due to non-spherical shape and varying apparent pole\norientation, and show that those can be key for reconciling previous diameter\ndeterminations and correctly estimating the spectral emissivities. We also\nevaluate the possible contribution to thermal fluxes of established (Chariklo)\nor claimed (Chiron) ring systems. As a general conclusion, all the objects,\nexcept Makemake, have radio emissivities significantly lower than unity.\nAlthough the emissivity values show diversity, we do not find any significant\ntrend with physical parameters such as diameter, composition, beaming factor,\nalbedo, or color, but we suggest that the emissivity could be correlated with\ngrain size. The mean relative radio emissivity is found to be 0.70$\\pm$0.13, a\nvalue that we recommend for the analysis of further mm/submm data.\n", "  Herein we review the remarkable range of modifications to materials\nproperties associated with photoexcitation of the growth surface during\nphysical vapor epitaxy of semiconductors. We concentrate on mechanisms\nproducing measureable, utilizable changes in crystalline perfection, phase,\ncomposition, doping, and defect distribution. We outline the relevant physics\nof different mechanisms, concentrating on those yielding effects orthogonal to\nthe primary growth variables of temperature and atomic or molecular fluxes and\ndocument the phenomenological effects reported. Based on experimental\nobservations from a range of semiconductor systems and growth conditions, the\nprimary effects include enhanced anion desorption, molecular dissociation,\nincreased doping efficiency, modification to defect populations and\nimprovements to the crystalline quality of epilayers grown at low temperatures.\nFuture research directions and technological applications are also discussed.\n", "  In the presence of a gravitational field decay rates may significantly differ\nfrom flat space equivalent. By studying mutually interacting quantum fields the\ndecay rates can be calculated on a given spacetime. This paper presents the\ncalculation of the transition probability for the decay of a massive scalar\nparticle in a stiff matter dominated universe. We find that due to the precence\nof a gravitational field a finite correction to the transition probability is\nadded which depends inversely on the mass. Moreover the decay rate is smaller\nand lifetime of the particles is longer compared to flat space. The mass\ndependence is such that the lifetime of lighter particles is prolonged more\ncompared to heavier particles. This result may be of significance when studying\ncosmological situations involving stiff matter.\n", "  Starting from a Skyrme interaction with tensor terms, the $\\beta$-decay rates\nof $^{52}$Ca have been studied within a microscopic model including the $2p-2h$\nconfiguration effects. We observe a redistribution of the strength of\nGamow-Teller transitions due to the $2p-2h$ fragmentation. Taking into account\nthis effect results in a satisfactory description of the neutron emission\nprobability of the $\\beta$-decay in $^{52}$Ca.\n", "  We study the phase transition between conducting and insulating states taking\nplace in disordered multi-channel Luttinger liquids with inter-channel\ninteractions. We derive renormalisation group equations which are perturbative\nin disorder but nonperturbative in interaction. In the vicinity of the\nsimultaneous phase transition in all channels, these equations become a set of\ncoupled Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless equations, which we analyze within\ntwo models: an array of identical wires and a two-channel model with distinct\nchannels. We show that a competition between disorder and interaction results\nin a variety of phases, expected to be observable at intermediate temperatures\nwhere the interaction and disorder are relevant but weak hybridization and the\ncharge-density wave interaction may be ignored.\n", "  We have compiled from the available literature a large set of radio\nmeasurements of black hole binaries in the hard X-ray state for which\nmeasurements of the gigahertz frequency radio spectral index are possible. We\nseparate the sample into `radio loud' and `radio quiet' subsets based upon\ntheir distribution in the radio -- X-ray plane, and investigate the\ndistribution of radio spectral indices within each subset. The distribution of\nspectral indices of the `radio loud' subset is well described by a Gaussian\ndistribution with mean spectral index $\\alpha = +0.2$ and standard deviation\n$0.2$ (here spectral index is defined such that a positive spectral index means\nmore flux at higher frequencies). The sparser sample for the `radio quiet'\nsubset can be approximated, less well, by a Gaussian with mean $\\alpha = -0.2$\nand standard deviation $0.3$; alternatively the simple mean of the distribution\nof the radio quiet subset is $-0.3$. The two spectral index distributions are\ndifferent at high statistical significance. Confirming previous work in the\nliterature, we test to see if the differences in observed spectra could result\nfrom different distributions of jet viewing angles, but find no evidence for\nthis. We conclude therefore that the jets in the two groups are physically\ndifferent in some way, and briefly discuss possible origins and further\npossible diagnostics. Finally we note that extrapolating to lower frequencies\nthe two subsets move closer together in the radio -- X-ray plane, and\napproximately merge into a single distribution at around 400 MHz.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of the dark matter density profiles of the most\nmassive galaxy clusters in the Universe. Using a `zoom-in' procedure on a large\nsuite of cosmological simulations of total comoving volume of $3\\,(h^{-1}\\,\\rm\nGpc)^3$, we study the 25 most massive clusters in four redshift slices from\n$z\\sim 1$ to the present. The minimum mass is $M_{500} > 5.5 \\times 10^{14}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ at $z=1$. Each system has more than two million particles within\n$r_{500}$. Once scaled to the critical density at each redshift, the dark\nmatter profiles within $r_{500}$ are strikingly similar from $z\\sim1$ to the\npresent day, exhibiting a low dispersion of 0.15 dex, and showing little\nevolution with redshift in the radial logarithmic slope and scatter. They have\nthe running power law shape typical of the NFW-type profiles, and their inner\nstructure, resolved to $3.8\\,h^{-1}$ comoving kpc at $z=1$, shows no signs of\nconverging to an asymptotic slope. Our results suggest that this type of\nprofile is already in place at $z>1$ in the highest-mass haloes in the\nUniverse, and that it remains exceptionally robust to merging activity.\n", "  We focus on a non-abelian gauge field coupled to a single (but general)\nrepresentation of a family of Nf fermions. By using the same machinery that had\nallowed us to evaluate the sub-leading large-Nf term of the five-loop Beta\nfunction earlier, we here report on a confirmation of the all-Nf result that\nhas in the meantime been published by another group. Furthermore, in order to\npush forward the 5-loop renormalization program regarding gauge parameter\ndependence, we present the linear terms of the complete set of anomalous\ndimensions, in an expansion in the covariant gauge parameter around the Feynman\ngauge.\n", "  We report the amplification of 250~GHz pulses as short as 260~ps without\nobservation of pulse broadening using a photonic-band-gap circuit gyrotron\ntraveling-wave-amplifier. The gyrotron amplifier operates with 38~dB of device\ngain and 8~GHz of instantaneous bandwidth. The operational bandwidth of the\namplifier can be tuned over 16 GHz by adjusting the operating voltage of the\nelectron beam and the magnetic field. The amplifier uses a 30~cm long\nphotonic-band-gap interaction circuit to confine the desired TE$_{03}$-like\noperating mode while suppressing lower order modes which can result in\nundesired oscillations. The circuit gain is $>$55~dB for a beam voltage of\n23~kV and a current of 700~mA. These results demonstrate the wide bandwidths\nand high gain achievable with gyrotron amplifiers. The amplification of\npicosecond pulses of variable lengths, 260-800~ps, shows good agreement with\ntheory using the coupled dispersion relation and the gain-spectrum of the\namplifier as measured with quasi-CW input pulses.\n", "  Low-scale leptogenesis provides an economic and testable description of the\norigin of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this scenario, the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe is reprocessed from the lepton asymmetry by\nelectroweak sphaleron processes. Provided that sphalerons are fast enough to\nmaintain equilibrium, the values of the baryon and lepton asymmetries are\nrelated to each other. Usually, this relation is used to find the value of the\nbaryon asymmetry at the time of the sphaleron freeze-out. To put in other\nwords, the formula which is valid only when the sphalerons are fast, is applied\nat the moment when they are actually switched off. In this paper, we examine\nthe validity of such a treatment. To this end, we solve the full system of\nkinetic equations for low-scale leptogenesis. This system includes equations\ndescribing the production of the lepton asymmetry in oscillations of\nright-handed neutrinos, as well as a separate kinetic equation for the baryon\nasymmetry. We show that for some values of the model parameters, the\ncorrections to the standard approach are sizeable. We also present a feasible\nimprovement to the ordinary procedure, which accounts for these corrections.\n", "  Helium (He) nanodroplets irradiated by intense near-infrared laser pulses\nform a nanoplasma by avalanche-like electron impact ionizations even at lower\nlaser intensities where He is not directly field ionized, provided that the\ndroplets contain a few dopant atoms which provide seed electrons for the\nelectron impact ionization avalanche. In this theoretical paper on calcium and\nxenon doped He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization\navalanches, termed ignition. We find that the partial loss of seed electrons\nfrom the activated droplets starkly assists ignition, as the Coulomb barrier\nfor ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant\ncations, and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric\nfield. In addition, the dopant ions assist the acceleration of the seed\nelectrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting electron impact\nionizations of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away.\nThe dopants' ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He as well as the\nslingshot effect decrease with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a\ndependence of the dopants' ignition capability on the dopant mass. Here, we\ndevelop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the ignition capability of\ndopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the\nHe atoms and (ii) the overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the\ndistribution of Coulomb barrier heights at He. The relatively long time delays\nbetween the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation times) for\ncalcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by the time it takes to\ndeshield the dopant ions.\n", "  Polarimetry of IGR J1401-4306, a long period (12.7 hours), eclipsing\nintermediate polar and remnant of Nova Scorpii 1437 A.D., reveals periodic\nvariations of optical circular polarization, confirming the system as the\nlongest period eclipsing intermediate polar known. This makes it an interesting\nsystem from an evolutionary perspective. The circular polarization is\ninterpreted as optical cyclotron emission from an accreting magnetic white\ndwarf primary. Based on the polarimetry, we propose that it is a disc-fed\nintermediate polar. The detection of predominantly negative circular\npolarization is consistent with only one of the magnetic poles dominating the\npolarized emission, while the other is mostly obscured by the accretion disc.\n", "  In an effort to search for Ly$\\alpha$ emission from circum- and intergalactic\ngas on scales of hundreds of kpc around $z\\sim3$ quasars, and thus characterise\nthe physical properties of the gas in emission, we have initiated an extensive\nfast-survey with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE): Quasar Snapshot\nObservations with MUse: Search for Extended Ultraviolet eMission (QSO MUSEUM).\nIn this work, we report the discovery of an enormous Ly$\\alpha$ nebula (ELAN)\naround the quasar SDSS~J102009.99+104002.7 at $z=3.164$, which we followed-up\nwith deeper MUSE observations. This ELAN spans $\\sim297$ projected kpc, has an\naverage Ly$\\alpha$ surface brightness ${\\rm SB}_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}\\sim\n6.04\\times10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ (within the $2\\sigma$\nisophote), and is associated with an additional four, previously unknown\nembedded sources: two Ly$\\alpha$ emitters and two faint active galactic nuclei\n(one Type-1 and one Type-2 quasar). By mapping at high significance the\nline-of-sight velocity in the entirety of the observed structure, we unveiled a\nlarge-scale coherent rotation-like pattern spanning $\\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$ with\na velocity dispersion of $<270$ km s$^{-1}$, which we interpret as a signature\nof the inspiraling accretion of substructures within the quasar's host halo.\nFuture multiwavelength data will complement our MUSE observations, and are\ndefinitely needed to fully characterise such a complex system. None the less,\nour observations reveal the potential of new sensitive integral-field\nspectrographs to characterise the dynamical state of diffuse gas on large\nscales in the young Universe, and thereby witness the assembly of galaxies.\n", "  Spatially resolved observations of protoplanetary discs are revealing that\ntheir inner regions can be warped or broken from the outer disc. A few\nmechanisms are known to lead to such 3D structures; among them, the interaction\nwith a stellar companion. We perform a 3D SPH simulation of a circumbinary disc\nmisaligned by $60^\\circ$ with respect to the binary orbital plane. The inner\ndisc breaks from the outer regions, precessing as a rigid body, and leading to\na complex evolution. As the inner disc precesses, the misalignment angle\nbetween the inner and outer discs varies by more than $100^\\circ$. Different\nsnapshots of the evolution are post-processed with a radiative transfer code,\nin order to produce observational diagnostics of the process. Even though the\nsimulation was produced for the specific case of a circumbinary disc, most of\nthe observational predictions hold for any disc hosting a precessing inner rim.\nSynthetic scattered light observations show strong azimuthal asymmetries, where\nthe pattern depends strongly on the misalignment angle between inner and outer\ndisc. The asymmetric illumination of the outer disc leads to azimuthal\nvariations of the temperature structure, in particular in the upper layers,\nwhere the cooling time is short. These variations are reflected in asymmetric\nsurface brightness maps of optically thick lines, as CO $J$=3-2. The\nkinematical information obtained from the gas lines is unique in determining\nthe disc structure. The combination of scattered light images and (sub-)mm\nlines can distinguish between radial inflow and misaligned inner disc\nscenarios.\n", "  Quantum radiated power emitted by an Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector in linear\noscillatory motion in (3+1)D Minkowski space, with the internal harmonic\noscillator minimally coupled to a massless scalar field, is obtained\nnon-perturbatively by numerical method. The signal of the Unruh-like effect\nexperienced by the detector is found to be pronounced in quantum radiation in\nthe highly non-equilibrium regime with high averaged acceleration and short\noscillatory cycle, and the signal would be greatly suppressed by quantum\ninterference when the averaged proper acceleration is sufficiently low. An\nobserver at a fixed angle would see periods of negative radiated power in each\ncycle of motion, while the averaged radiated power over a cycle is always\npositive as guaranteed by the quantum inequalities. Coherent high harmonic\ngeneration and down conversion are identified in the detector's quantum\nradiation. Due to the overwhelming largeness of the vacuum correlators of the\nfree field, the asymptotic reduced state of the harmonics of the radiation\nfield is approximately a direct product of the squeezed thermal states.\n", "  Hybrid quantum circuits combining advantages of each individual system have\nprovided a promising platform for quantum information processing. Here we\npropose an experimental scheme to directly couple a transmon qubit to an\nindividual spin in the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, with a coupling strength\nthree orders of magnitude larger than that for a single spin coupled to a\nmicrowave cavity. This direct coupling between the transmon and the NV center\ncould be utilized to make a transmon bus, leading to a coherently virtual\nexchange among different single spins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, by\ncoupling a transmon to a low-density NV ensemble, a SWAP operation between the\ntransmon and NV ensemble is feasible and a quantum non-demolition measurement\non the state of NV ensemble can be realized on the cavity-transmon-NV-ensemble\nhybrid system. Moreover, on this system, a virtual coupling can be achieved\nbetween the cavity and NV ensemble, which is much larger in magnitude than the\ndirect coupling between the cavity and the NV ensemble. The photon state in\ncavity can be thus stored into NV spins more efficiently through this virtual\ncoupling.\n", "  The CRAYFIS experiment proposes to use privately owned mobile phones as a\nground detector array for Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays. Upon interacting with\nEarth's atmosphere, these events produce extensive particle showers which can\nbe detected by cameras on mobile phones. A typical shower contains\nminimally-ionizing particles such as muons. As these particles interact with\nCMOS image sensors, they may leave tracks of faintly-activated pixels that are\nsometimes hard to distinguish from random detector noise. Triggers that rely on\nthe presence of very bright pixels within an image frame are not efficient in\nthis case.\n  We present a trigger algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Networks which\nselects images containing such tracks and are evaluated in a lazy manner: the\nresponse of each successive layer is computed only if activation of the current\nlayer satisfies a continuation criterion. Usage of neural networks increases\nthe sensitivity considerably comparable with image thresholding, while the lazy\nevaluation allows for execution of the trigger under the limited computational\npower of mobile phones.\n", "  Daily operation of a large-scale experiment is a challenging task,\nparticularly from perspectives of routine monitoring of quality for data being\ntaken. We describe an approach that uses Machine Learning for the automated\nsystem to monitor data quality, which is based on partial use of data qualified\nmanually by detector experts. The system automatically classifies marginal\ncases: both of good an bad data, and use human expert decision to classify\nremaining \"grey area\" cases.\n  This study uses collision data collected by the CMS experiment at LHC in\n2010. We demonstrate that proposed workflow is able to automatically process at\nleast 20\\% of samples without noticeable degradation of the result.\n", "  High-energy physics experiments rely on reconstruction of the trajectories of\nparticles produced at the interaction point. This is a challenging task,\nespecially in the high track multiplicity environment generated by p-p\ncollisions at the LHC energies. A typical event includes hundreds of signal\nexamples (interesting decays) and a significant amount of noise (uninteresting\nexamples).\n  This work describes a modification of the Artificial Retina algorithm for\nfast track finding: numerical optimization methods were adopted for fast local\ntrack search. This approach allows for considerable reduction of the total\ncomputational time per event. Test results on simplified simulated model of\nLHCb VELO (VErtex LOcator) detector are presented. Also this approach is\nwell-suited for implementation of paralleled computations as GPGPU which look\nvery attractive in the context of upcoming detector upgrades.\n", "  The progenitors of low-luminosity Type II-Plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are\nbelieved to be red supergiant (RSG) stars, but there is much disparity in the\nliterature concerning their mass at core collapse and therefore on the main\nsequence. Here, we model the SN radiation arising from the low-energy explosion\nof RSG stars of 12, 25, and 27 M$_{\\odot}$ on the main sequence and formed\nthrough single star evolution. Despite the narrow range in ejecta kinetic\nenergy (2.5$-$4.2$\\times$10$^{50}$ erg) in our model set, the SN observables\nfrom our three models are significantly distinct, reflecting the differences in\nprogenitor structure (e.g., surface radius, H-rich envelope mass, He-core\nmass). Our higher mass RSG stars give rise to Type II SNe that tend to have\nbluer colors at early times, a shorter photospheric phase, and a faster\ndeclining $V$-band light curve (LC) more typical of Type II-linear SNe, in\nconflict with the LC plateau observed for low-luminosity SNe II. The complete\nfallback of the CO core in the low-energy explosions of our high mass RSG stars\nprevents the ejection of any ${}^{56}$Ni (nor any core O or Si), in contrast to\nlow-luminosity SNe II-P, which eject at least 0.001 M$_{\\odot}$ of ${}^{56}$Ni.\nIn contrast to observations, type II SN models from higher mass RSGs tend to\nshow an H$\\alpha$ absorption that remains broad at late times (due to a larger\nvelocity at the base of the H-rich envelope). In agreement with the analyses of\npre-explosion photometry, we conclude that low-luminosity SNe II-P likely arise\nfrom low-mass rather than high-mass RSG stars.\n", "  High partial-wave ($l\\ge2$) Feshbach resonance (FR) in an ultracold mixture\nof $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb atoms is investigated experimentally aided by a\npartial-wave insensitive analytic multichannel quantum-defect theory (MQDT).\nTwo \"broad\" resonances from coupling between d-waves in both the open and\nclosed channels are observed and characterized. One of them shows a fully\nresolved triplet structure with splitting ratio well explained by the\nperturbation to the closed channel due to interatomic spin-spin interaction.\nThese tunable \"broad\" d-wave resonances, especially the one in the\nlowest-energy open channel, could find important applications in simulating\nd-wave coupling dominated many-body systems. In addition, we find that there is\ngenerally a time and temperature requirement, associated with tunneling through\nthe angular momentum barrier, to establish and observe resonant coupling in\nnonzero partial waves.\n", "  We present results based on a well sampled optical ($UBVRI$) and ultraviolet\n({\\it Swift}/UVOT) imaging, and low-resolution optical spectroscopic follow-up\nobservations of the nearby Type Ic supernova (SN) ASASSN-16fp (SN 2016coi). The\nSN was monitored during the photospheric phase ($-10$ to $+$33 days with\nrespect to the $B$-band maximum light). The rise to maximum light and early\npost-maximum decline of the light curves are slow. The peak absolute magnitude\n($M_{V}$ = $-17.7\\pm0.2$ mag) of ASASSN-16fp is comparable with broad-lined Ic\nSN 2002ap, SN 2012ap and transitional Ic SN 2004aw but considerably fainter\nthan the GRB/XRF associated supernovae (e.g. SN 1998bw, 2006aj). Similar to the\nlight curve, the spectral evolution is also slow. ASASSN-16fp shows distinct\nphotospheric phase spectral lines along with the C\\,{\\sc ii} features. The\nexpansion velocity of the ejecta near maximum light reached $\\sim$16000 km\ns$^{-1}$ and settled to $\\sim$8000 km s$^{-1}$, $\\sim$1 month post-maximum.\nAnalytical modelling of the quasi-bolometric light curve of ASASSN-16fp\nsuggests that $\\sim$0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ $^{56}$Ni mass was synthesized in the\nexplosion, with a kinetic energy of 6.9$^{+1.5}_{-1.3}$ $\\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg\nand total ejected mass of $\\sim$4.5\\,$\\pm$\\,0.3 M$_{\\odot}$.\n", "  In the paper we discuss the angular correlation present in hadron-hadron\ncollisions at large rapidity difference ($\\bas\\,y_{12}\\,\\gg\\,1$). We find that\nin the CGC/saturation approach the largest contribution stems from the density\nvariation mechanism. Our principal results are that the odd Fourier\nharmonics($v_{2n+1}$), decrease substantially as function of $y_{12}$, while\nthe even harmonics ($v_{2n}$ ), increase considerably with a growth of\n$y_{12}$.\n", "  The one-loop correction to heavy quark pair back-to-back production in\nunpolarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering is given in this work in\nthe framework of transverse momentum dependent(TMD) factorization. Both\nunpolarized and linearly polarized TMD gluon distribution functions are taken\ninto account. A subtraction method based on diagram expansion is used to get\nfinite hard coefficients. It is found the soft and collinear divergences of\none-loop amplitude is proportional to tree level ones and can be expressed\nthrough several basic scalar triangle and bubble integrals. The subtraction of\nthese divergences is spin independent. Beyond tree level an additional soft\nfactor related to final heavy quark pair must be added into the factorization\nformula. This soft factor affects the azimuthal angle distribution of virtual\nphoton in a nonperturbative way. Integrating over virtual photon azimuthal\nangle we construct three weighted cross sections, which depend on only three\nadditional integrated soft factors. These weighted cross sections can be used\nto extract linearly polarized gluon distribution function. In addition, lepton\nazimuthal angle is unintegrated in this work, which provides more observables.\nAll hard coefficients relevant to lepton and virtual photon azimuthal angle\ndistributions are given at one-loop level.\n", "  Observations of thermonuclear X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars (NSs)\nin low-mass X-ray binary systems can be used to constrain NS masses and radii.\nMost previous work of this type has set these constraints using Planck function\nfits as a proxy: both the models and the data are fit with diluted blackbody\nfunctions to yield normalizations and temperatures which are then compared\nagainst each other. Here, for the first time, we fit atmosphere models of X-ray\nbursting NSs directly to the observed spectra. We present a hierarchical\nBayesian fitting framework that uses state-of-the-art X-ray bursting NS\natmosphere models with realistic opacities and relativistic exact Compton\nscattering kernels as a model for the surface emission. We test our approach\nagainst synthetic data, and find that for data that are well-described by our\nmodel we can obtain robust radius, mass, distance, and composition\nmeasurements. We then apply our technique to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer\nobservations of five hard-state X-ray bursts from 4U 1702-429. Our joint fit to\nall five bursts shows that the theoretical atmosphere models describe the data\nwell but there are still some unmodeled features in the spectrum corresponding\nto a relative error of 1-5% of the energy flux. After marginalizing over this\nintrinsic scatter, we find that at 68% credibility the circumferential radius\nof the NS in 4U 1702-429 is R = 12.4+-0.4 km, the gravitational mass is\nM=1.9+-0.3 Msun, the distance is 5.1 < D/kpc < 6.2, and the hydrogen mass\nfraction is X < 0.09.\n", "  Singlet-triplet qubits in lateral quantum dots in semiconductor\nheterostructures exhibit high-fidelity single-qubit gates via exchange\ninteractions and magnetic field gradients. High-fidelity two-qubit entangling\ngates are challenging to generate since weak interqubit interactions result in\nslow gates that accumulate error in the presence of noise. However, the\ninterqubit electrostatic interaction also produces a shift in the local double\nwell detunings, effectively changing the dependence of exchange on the gate\nvoltages. We consider an operating point where the effective exchange is first\norder insensitive to charge fluctuations while maintaining nonzero\ninteractions. This \"sweet spot\" exists only in the presence of interactions. We\nshow that working at the interacting sweet spot can directly produce maximally\nentangling gates and we simulate the gate evolution under realistic 1/f noise.\nWe report theoretical two-qubit gate fidelities above 99% in GaAs and Si\nsystems.\n", "  Blazar jets are renowned for their rapid violent variability and\nmultiwavelength flares, however, the physical processes responsible for these\nflares are not well understood. In this paper we develop a time-dependent\ninhomogeneous fluid jet emission model for blazars. We model optically thick\nradio flares for the first time and show that they are delayed with respect to\nthe prompt optically thin emission by ~ months to decades, with a lag that\nincreases with the jet power and observed wavelength. This lag is caused by a\ncombination of the travel time of the flaring plasma to the optically thin\nradio emitting sections of the jet and the slow rise time of the radio flare.\nWe predict two types of flares: symmetric flares - with the same rise and decay\ntime, which occur for flares whose duration is shorter than both the radiative\nlifetime and the geometric path-length delay timescale; extended flares - whose\nluminosity tracks the power of particle acceleration in the flare, which occur\nfor flares with a duration longer than both the radiative lifetime and\ngeometric delay. Our model naturally produces orphan X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray\nflares. These are caused by flares which are only observable above the\nquiescent jet emission in a narrow band of frequencies. Our model is able to\nsuccessfully fit to the observed multiwavelength flaring spectra and\nlightcurves of PKS1502+106 across all wavelengths, using a transient flaring\nfront located within the broad-line region.\n", "  We study particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in the\nprimary hotspot in the northwest jet of radiogalaxy Cygnus A. By using the\nobserved flux density at 43 GHz in a well resolved region of this hotspot, we\ndetermine the minimum value of the jet density and constrain the magnitude of\nthe magnetic field. We find that a jet with density greater than $5\\times\n10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and hotspot magnetic field in the range 50-400 $\\mu$G are\nrequired to explain the synchrotron emission at 43 GHz. The upper-energy\ncut-off in the hotspot synchrotron spectrum is at a frequency < $5\\times\n10^{14}$ Hz, indicating that the maximum energy of non-thermal electrons\naccelerated at the jet reverse shock is $E_{e, \\rm max} \\sim 0.8$ TeV in a\nmagnetic field of 100 $\\mu$G. Based on the condition that the\nmagnetic-turbulence scale length has to be larger than the plasma skin depth,\nand that the energy density in non-thermal particles cannot violate the limit\nimposed by the jet kinetic luminosity, we show that $E_{e,\\rm max}$ cannot be\nconstrained by synchrotron losses as traditionally assumed. In addition to\nthat, and assuming that the shock is quasi-perpendicular, we show that\nnon-resonant hybrid instabilities generated by the streaming of cosmic rays\nwith energy $E_{e, \\rm max}$ can grow fast enough to amplify the jet magnetic\nfield up to 50-400 $\\mu$G and accelerate particles up to the maximum energy\n$E_{e, \\rm max}$ observed in the Cygnus A primary hotspot.\n", "  We present Gemini/GNIRS cross-dispersed near-infrared spectra of 12 nearby\nearly-type galaxies, with the aim of testing commonly used stellar population\nsynthesis models. We select a subset of galaxies from the atlas/ sample which\nspan a wide range of ages (SSP-equivalent ages of 1--15~Gyr) at approximately\nsolar metallicity. We derive star formation histories using four different\nstellar population synthesis models, namely those of [bruzual_stellar_2003],\nConroy, Gunn \\& White (2009; 2010), [maraston_stellar_2011] and\n[vazdekis_uv-extended_2016]. We compare star formation histories derived from\nnear-infrared spectra with those derived from optical spectra using the same\nmodels. We find that while all models agree in the optical, the derived star\nformation histories vary dramatically from model to model in the near-infrared.\nWe find that this variation is largely driven by the choice of stellar spectral\nlibrary, such that models including high quality spectral libraries provide the\nbest fits to the data, and are the most self-consistent when comparing\noptically-derived properties with near-infrared ones. We also find the impact\nof age variation in the near-infrared to be subtle, and largely encoded in the\nshape of the continuum, meaning that the common approach of removing continuum\ninformation with a high-order polynomial greatly reduces our ability to\nconstrain ages in the near-infrared.\n", "  Blazars are classified into high, intermediate and low energy peaked sources\nbased on the location of their synchrotron peak. This lies in infra-red/optical\nto ultra-violet bands for low and intermediate peaked blazars. The transition\nfrom synchrotron to inverse Compton emission falls in the X-ray bands for such\nsources. We present the spectral and timing analysis of 14 low and intermediate\nenergy peaked blazars ob- served with XMMNewton spanning 31 epochs. Parametric\nfits to X-ray spectra helps constrain the possible location of transition from\nthe high energy end of the syn- chrotron to the low energy end of the inverse\nCompton emission. In seven sources in our sample, we infer such a transition\nand constrain the break energy in the range 0.6 10 keV. The Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram is used to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) shape. It is\nwell described by a power law in a majority of light curves, the index being\nflatter compared to general expectation from AGN, ranging here between 0.01 and\n1.12, possibly due to short observation durations resulting in an absence of\nlong term trends. A toy model involving synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and\nexter- nal Compton (EC; disk, broad line region, torus) mechanisms are used to\nestimate magnetic field strength 6 0.03 - 0.88 G in sources displaying the\nenergy break and infer a prominent EC contribution. The timescale for\nvariability being shorter than synchrotron cooling implies steeper PSD slopes\nwhich are inferred in these sources.\n", "  The cosmological phase transition with Q-balls production mechanism can\nexplain the baryogenesis and dark matter simultaneously, where constraints on\ndark matter masses and reverse dilution are significantly relaxed. We study how\nto probe this scenario by collider signals at QCD next-to-leading order and\ngravitational wave signals.\n", "  Supersymmetry and more specifically supergravity grand unification allow one\nto extrapolate physics from the electroweak scale up to the grand unification\nscale consistent with electroweak data. Here we give a brief overview of their\ncurrent status and show that the case for supersymmetry is stronger as a result\nof the Higgs boson discovery with a mass measurement at $\\sim 125$ GeV\nconsistent with the supergravity grand unification prediction that the Higgs\nboson mass lie below 130 GeV. Thus the discovery of the Higgs boson and the\nmeasurement of its mass provide a further impetus for the search for sparticles\nto continue at the current and future colliders.\n", "  We have studied a series of Pt/Co/M epitaxial trilayers, in which Co is\nsandwiched between Pt and a non magnetic layer M (Pt, Ir, Cu, Al). Using polar\nmagneto-optical Kerr microscopy, we show that the field- induced domain wall\nspeeds are strongly dependent on the nature of the top layer, they increase\ngoing from M=Pt to lighter top metallic overlayers, and can reach several 100\nm/s for Pt/Co/Al. The DW dynamics is consistent with the presence of chiral\nN\\'eel walls stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)\nwhose strength increases going from Pt to Al top layers. This is explained by\nthe presence of DMI with opposite sign at the Pt/Co and Co/M interfaces, the\nlatter increasing in strength going towards heavier atoms, possibly due to the\nincreasing spin-orbit interaction. This work shows that in non-centrosymmetric\ntrilayers the domain wall dynamics can be finely tuned by engineering the DMI\nstrength, in view of efficient devices for logic and spitronics applications.\n", "  This paper describes the use of the idea of natural time to propose a new\nmethod for characterizing the seismic risk to the world's major cities at risk\nof earthquakes. Rather than focus on forecasting, which is the computation of\nprobabilities of future events, we define the term seismic nowcasting, which is\nthe computation of the current state of seismic hazard in a defined geographic\nregion.\n", "  We calculate axisymmetric spheroidal modes of neutron stars magnetized with\nan axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field. We use polytropes of the indices\n$n\\sim1$ as background equilibrium models of neutron stars where we ignore the\ndeformation due to the magnetic fields. For a poloidal magnetic field,\naxisymmetric normal modes of non-rotating stars are decoupled into spheroidal\nmodes and toroidal modes, and we can treat spheroidal modes separately from\ntoroidal modes. For the surface field strength $B_S$ ranging from $10^{14}$G to\n$10^{16}$G, we calculate axisymmetric spheroidal magnetic modes whose\noscillation frequency is proportional to $B_S$. The typical oscillation\nfrequency of the magnetic modes is $\\sim 0.01\\times\\sqrt{GM/R^3}$ for $B_S\\sim\n10^{15}$G, where $M$ and $R$ are respectively the mass and radius of the star\nand $G$ is the gravitational constant. For $M=1.4M_\\odot$ and $R=10^6$cm, this\nfrequency is $\\sim 20$Hz, which may explain low frequency QPOs found for SGR\n1806-204 and SGR 1900+14. We also find modes of frequency $> \\sqrt{GM/R^3}$\ncorresponding to the radial fundamental and first harmonic modes. No unstable\nmagnetic modes are found for axisymmetric spheroidal oscillations of magnetized\nstars.\n", "  We explore the possibility that the recently detected dipole anisotropy in\nthe arrival directions of~$>8$~EeV ultra-high energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs)\narises due to the large-scale structure (LSS). We assume that the cosmic ray\nsources follow the matter distribution and calculate the flux-weighted UHECRs'\nRMS dipole amplitude taking into account the diffusive transport in the\nintergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We find that the flux-weighted RMS dipole\namplitude is $\\sim8$% before entering the Galaxy. The amplitude in the [4-8]\nEeV is only slightly lower $\\sim 5$%. The required IGMF is of the order of\n{5-30 nG}, and the UHECR sources must be relatively nearby, within $\\sim$300\nMpc. The absence of statistically significant signal in the lower energy bin\ncan be explained if the same nuclei specie dominates the composition in both\nenergy bins and diffusion in the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) reduces the\ndipole of these lower rigidity particles. Photodisintegration of higher energy\nUHECRs could also reduce somewhat the lower energy dipole.\n", "  Methyl isocyanate (CH3NCO) is one of the important complex organic molecules\ndetected on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by Rosetta's Philae lander. It\nwas also detected in hot cores around high-mass protostars along with a recent\ndetection in the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. We propose here a\ngas-grain chemical model to form CH3NCO after reviewing various formation\npathways with quantum chemical computations. We have used NAUTILUS 3-phase\ngas-grain chemical model to compare observed abundances in the IRAS 16293-2422.\nOur chemical model clearly indicates the ice phase origin of CH3NCO.\n", "  We present the stochastic thermodynamic analysis of a time-periodic single\nparticle pump, including explicit results for flux, thermodynamic force,\nentropy production, work, heat and efficiency. These results are valid far from\nequilibrium. The deviations from the linear (Onsager) regime are discussed.\n", "  The Time Differential Perturbed Angular Distribution technique with LaBr$_3$\ndetectors has been applied to the $I^\\pi = \\frac{11}{2}^-$ isomeric state ($E_x\n= 846$ keV, $\\tau=107$~ns) in $^{107}$Cd, which was populated and\nrecoil-implanted into a gadolinium host following the $^{98}$Mo($^{12}$C,\n$3n$)$^{107}$Cd reaction. The static hyperfine field strength of Cd recoil\nimplanted into gadolinium was thus measured, together with the fraction of\nnuclei implanted into field-free sites, under similar conditions as pertained\nfor a previous implantation perturbed angular distribution $g$-factor\nmeasurement on the $I^\\pi = 10^+$ state in $^{110}$Cd. The $^{110}$Cd $g(10^+)$\nvalue was thereby re-evaluated, bringing it into agreement with the value\nexpected for a seniority-two $\\nu h_{\\frac{11}{2}}$ configuration.\n", "  We aim to study the variability properties of bright hard X-ray selected\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with redshift between 0.3 and 1.6 detected in the\nChandra Deep Field South (XMM-CDFS) by a long XMM observation. Taking advantage\nof the good count statistics in the XMM CDFS we search for flux and spectral\nvariability using the hardness ratio techniques. We also investigated spectral\nvariability of different spectral components. The spectra were merged in six\nepochs (defined as adjacent observations) and in high and low flux states to\nunderstand whether the flux transitions are accompanied by spectral changes.\nThe flux variability is significant in all the sources investigated. The\nhardness ratios in general are not as variable as the fluxes. Only one source\ndisplays a variable HR, anti-correlated with the flux (source 337). The\nspectral analysis in the available epochs confirms the steeper when brighter\ntrend consistent with Comptonisation models only in this source. Finding this\ntrend in one out of seven unabsorbed sources is consistent, within the\nstatistical limits, with the 15 % of unabsorbed AGN in previous deep surveys.\nNo significant variability in the column densities, nor in the Compton\nreflection component, has been detected across the epochs considered. The high\nand low states display in general different normalisations but consistent\nspectral properties. X-ray flux fluctuations are ubiquitous in AGN. In general,\nthe significant flux variations are not associated with a spectral variability:\nphoton index and column densities are not significantly variable in nine out of\nthe ten AGN over long timescales (from 3 to 6.5 years). The photon index\nvariability is found only in one source (which is steeper when brighter) out of\nseven unabsorbed AGN. These results are consistent with previous deep samples.\n", "  We discuss a cosmological phase transition within the Standard Model which\nincorporates spontaneously broken scale invariance as a low-energy theory. In\naddition to the Standard Model fields, the minimal model involves a light\ndilaton, which acquires a large vacuum expectation value (VEV) through the\nmechanism of dimensional transmutation. Under the assumption of the\ncancellation of the vacuum energy, the dilaton develops a very small mass at\n2-loop order. As a result, a flat direction is present in the classical\ndilaton-Higgs potential at zero temperature while the quantum potential admits\ntwo (almost) degenerate local minima with unbroken and broken eletroweak\nsymmetry. We found that the cosmological electroweak phase transition in this\nmodel can only be triggered by a QCD chiral symmetry breaking phase transition\nat low temperatures, $T\\lesssim 132$ MeV. Furthermore, unlike the standard\ncase, the universe settles into the chiral symmetry breaking vacuum via a\nfirst-order phase transition which gives rise to a stochastic gravitational\nbackground with a peak frequency $\\sim 10^{-8}$ Hz as well as triggers the\nproduction of approximately solar mass primordial black holes. The observation\nof these signatures of cosmological phase transitions together with the\ndetection of a light dilaton would provide a strong hint of the fundamental\nrole of scale invariance in particle physics.\n", "  The effects of pressure on micromechanical air-filled cavities made by a pair\nof suspended, parallel silicon nitride membranes are investigated in the free\nmolecular and quasi-molecular regimes. Variations of the fundamental drummode\nmechanical resonant frequencies and damping with air pressure are determined by\nmeans of optical interferometry. A kinetic damping linear friction force and a\npositive resonant frequency shift due to the compression of the fluid between\nthe membranes are observed to be proportional with pressure in the range\n0.01-10 mbars. For resonators with near-degenerate modes hybridization of the\nmodes due to this squeeze film effect is also observed and well accounted for\nby a simple spring-coupled oscillator model.\n", "  The non-Leibniz formalism is introduced in this article. The formalism is\nbased on the generalized differentiation operator (kappa-operator) with a\nnon-zero Leibniz defect. The Leibniz defect of the introduced operator linearly\ndepends on one scaling parameter. In a special case, if the Leibniz defect\nvanishes, the generalized differentiation operator reduces to the common\ndifferentiation operator. The kappa-operator allows the formulation of the\nvariational principles and corresponding Lagrange and Hamiltonian equations.\nThe solutions of some generalized dynamical equations are provided closed\nform.With a positive Leibniz defect the amplitude of free vibration remains\nconstant with time with the fading frequency (<<red shift>>). The negative\nLeibniz defect leads the opposite behavior, demonstrating the growing frequency\n(<<blue shift>>). However, the Hamiltonian remains constant in time in both\ncases. Thus the introduction of non-zero Leibniz defect leads to an alternative\nmathematical description of the conservative systems.\n", "  A concentration gradient along a fluid-fluid interface can cause flow. On a\nmicroscopic level, this so-called Marangoni effect can be viewed as being\ncaused by a gradient in the pressures acting on the fluid elements, or as the\nchemical-potential gradients acting on the excess densities of different\nspecies at the interface. If the interfacial thickness can be ignored, all\napproaches should result in the same flow profile away from the interface.\nHowever, on a more microscopic scale, the different expressions result in\ndifferent flow profiles, only one of which can be correct. Here we compare the\nresults of direct non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations with the flows\nthat would be generated by pressure and chemical potential gradients. We find\nthat the approach based on the chemical potential gradients agrees with the\ndirect simulations, whereas the calculations based on the pressure gradients do\nnot.\n", "  We investigate the upper stellar mass limit set by radiative feedback by the\nforming star with various accretion rates and metallicities. To this end, we\nnumerically solve the structures of both a protostar and its surrounding\naccretion envelope assuming a spherical symmetric and steady flow. The optical\ndepth of the dust cocoon, a dusty part of the accretion envelope, differs among\nthe direct light from the stellar photosphere and the diffuse light re-emitted\nas dust thermal emission. As a result, varying the metallicity qualitatively\nchanges the way that the radiative feedback suppresses the accretion flow. With\na fixed accretion rate of $10^{-3}M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr^{-1}}$, the both direct and\ndiffuse lights jointly operate to prevent the mass accretion at $Z \\gtrsim\n10^{-1}Z_{\\odot}$. At $Z \\lesssim 10^{-1}Z_{\\odot}$, the diffuse light is no\nlonger effective, and the direct light solely limits the mass accretion. At $Z\n\\lesssim 10^{-3}Z_{\\odot}$, the HII region formation plays an important role in\nterminating the accretion. The resultant upper mass limit increases with\ndecreasing metallicity, from a few $\\times~10~M_\\odot$ to $\\sim 10^3~M_\\odot$\nover $Z = 1Z_{\\odot} - 10^{-4}~Z_\\odot$. We also illustrate how the radiation\nspectrum of massive star-forming cores changes with decreasing metallicity.\nFirst, the peak wavelength of the spectrum, which is located around $30 \\mu\n{\\rm m}$ at $1Z_{\\odot}$, shifts to $< 3 \\mu {\\rm m}$ at $Z \\lesssim 0.1\nZ_\\odot$. Second, a characteristic feature at $10 \\mu \\rm{m}$ due to the\namorphous silicate band appears as a dip at $1Z_{\\odot}$, but changes to a bump\nat $Z \\lesssim 0.1 Z_{\\odot}$. Using these spectral signatures, we can search\nmassive accreting protostars in nearby low-metallicity environments with\nup-coming observations.\n", "  We investigate low-frequency fluctuations in the transport characteristics of\na quasi-1D Wigner solid (WS) moving along a liquid helium substrate in response\nto a sinusoidal driving voltage. The fluctuations occur between distinct\ntransport modes in which the decoupling of the WS from ripplonic polarons (or\n'dimple lattice', DL) formed on the helium surface does, or does not, occur\nduring each ac cycle. We demonstrate that a Gaussian-like distribution in the\ndecoupling threshold force gives rise to this bistability, as the low-frequency\nswitching occurs when the probability of decoupling during each ac cycle is\nsmall but finite. We attribute the distribution in the decoupling threshold\nforce to the range of structural configurations allowed for the quasi-1D\nelectron lattice, which influences the strength of the WS-DL coupling. Hence,\nthe switching rate between the ac transport modes is extremely sensitive to the\nmicroscopic properties of the electron solid.\n", "  Massive large-scale AGN outflows are an important element of galaxy\nevolution, being a way through which the AGN can affect most of the host\ngalaxy. However, outflows evolve on timescales much longer than typical AGN\nepisode durations, therefore most AGN outflows are not observed simultaneously\nwith the AGN episode that inflated them. It is therefore remarkable that rather\ntight correlations between outflow prop- erties and AGN luminosity exist. In\nthis paper, I show that such correlations can be preserved during the fading\nphase of the AGN episode, provided that the AGN lumi- nosity evolves as a power\nlaw with exponent $\\alpha_{\\rm d} \\sim 1$ at late times. I also show that\nsubsequent AGN episodes that illuminate an ongoing outflow are unlikely to\nproduce outflow momentum or energy rates rising above the observed\ncorrelations. However, there may be many difficult-to-detect outflows with\nmomentum and energy rates lower than expected from the current AGN luminosity.\nDetailed observations of AGN out- flow properties might help constrain the\nactivity histories of typical and/or individual AGN.\n", "  Results of timing measurements of the pulsar PSR B0329+54 obtained in\n1968--2012 using the Big Scanning Antenna of the Pushchino Radio Astronomy\nObservatory (at 102 and 111 MHz), the DSS 13 and DSS 14 telescopes of the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (2388 MHz), and the 64 m telescope of the Kalyazin Radio\nAstronomy Observatory (610 MHz) are presented. The astrometric and rotational\nparameters of the pulsar are derived at a new epoch. Periodic variations in the\nbarycentric timing residuals have been found, which can be explained by the\npresence of a planet orbiting the pulsar, with an orbital period $P_{1}$ = 27.8\nyr, mass \\textit{$m_{c}$}sin\\textit{i} = 2$M_{\\oplus}$, and orbital semi-major\naxis $a$ = 10.26 AU. The results of this study do not confirm existence of a\nproposed second planet with orbital period $P_{2}$ = 3 yr.\n", "  The surroundings of massive protostars constitute an accretion disc which has\nnumerically been shown to be subject to fragmentation and responsible for\nluminous accretion-driven outbursts. Moreover, it is suspected to produce close\nbinary companions which will later strongly influence the star's future\nevolution in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram. We present three-dimensional\ngravitation-radiation-hydrodynamic numerical simulations of 100 Mo pre-stellar\ncores. We find that accretion discs of young massive stars violently fragment\nwithout preventing the (highly variable) accretion of gaseous clumps onto the\nprotostars. While acquiring the characteristics of a nascent low-mass\ncompanion, some disc fragments migrate onto the central massive protostar with\ndynamical properties showing that its final Keplerian orbit is close enough to\nconstitute a close massive proto-binary system, having a young high-mass and a\nlow-mass component. We conclude on the viability of the disc fragmentation\nchannel for the formation of such short-period binaries, and that both\nprocesses -close massive binary formation and accretion bursts- may happen at\nthe same time. FU-Orionis-type bursts, such as observed in the young high-mass\nstar S255IR-NIRS3, may not only indicate ongoing disc fragmentation, but also\nbe considered as a tracer for the formation of close massive binaries -\nprogenitors of the subsequent massive spectroscopic binaries - once the\nhigh-mass component of the system will enter the main-sequence phase of its\nevolution. Finally, we investigate the ALMA-observability of the disc\nfragments.\n", "  Superconducting accelerator magnets require sophisticated monitoring and\nmeans of protection due to the large energy stored in the magnetic field.\nNumerical simulations play a crucial role in understanding transient phenomena\noccurring within the magnet, and can, therefore, help to prevent disruptive\nconsequences. We present a 2-D FEM model for the simulation of electro-thermal\ntransients occurring in superconducting accelerator magnets. The\nmagnetoquasistatic problem is solved with a modified magnetic vector potential\nformulation, where the cable eddy currents are resolved in terms of their\nequivalent magnetization. The heat balance equation is then investigated, and\nthe relevant heat sources are discussed. The model implements a two-port\ncomponent interface and is resolved, as part of an electrical circuit, in a\ncooperative simulation scheme with a lumped-parameter network.\n", "  We present photometric redshifts for 1,031 X-ray sources in the X-ATLAS\nfield, using the machine learning technique TPZ (Carrasco Kind & Brunner 2013).\nX-ATLAS covers 7.1 deg2 observed with the XMM-Newton within the Science\nDemonstration Phase (SDP) of the H-ATLAS field, making it one of the largest\ncontiguous areas of the sky with both XMMNewton and Herschel coverage. All of\nthe sources have available SDSS photometry while 810 have additionally mid-IR\nand/or near-IR photometry. A spectroscopic sample of 5,157 sources primarily in\nthe XMM/XXL field, but also from several X-ray surveys and the SDSS DR13\nredshift catalogue, is used for the training of the algorithm. Our analysis\nreveals that the algorithm performs best when the sources are split, based on\ntheir optical morphology, into point-like and extended sources. Optical\nphotometry alone is not enough for the estimation of accurate photometric\nredshifts, but the results greatly improve when, at least, mid-IR photometry is\nadded in the training process. In particular, our measurements show that the\nestimated photometric redshifts for the X-ray sources of the training sample,\nhave a normalized absolute median deviation, n_mad=0.06, and the percentage of\noutliers, eta=10-14 percent, depending on whether the sources are extended or\npoint-like. Our final catalogue contains photometric redshifts for 933 out of\nthe 1,031 X-ray sources with a median redshift of 0.9.\n", "  The Herschel Space Observatory has revealed a very different galaxyscape from\nthat shown by optical surveys which presents a challenge for galaxy-evolution\nmodels. The Herschel surveys reveal (1) that there was rapid galaxy evolution\nin the very recent past and (2) that galaxies lie on a a single Galaxy Sequence\n(GS) rather than a star-forming `main sequence' and a separate region of\n`passive' or `red-and-dead' galaxies. The form of the GS is now clearer because\nfar-infrared surveys such as the Herschel ATLAS pick up a population of\noptically-red star-forming galaxies that would have been classified as passive\nusing most optical criteria. The space-density of this population is at least\nas high as the traditional star-forming population. By stacking spectra of\nH-ATLAS galaxies over the redshift range 0.001 < z < 0.4, we show that the\ngalaxies responsible for the rapid low-redshift evolution have high stellar\nmasses, high star-formation rates but, even several billion years in the past,\nold stellar populations - they are thus likely to be relatively recent\nancestors of early-type galaxies in the Universe today. The form of the GS is\ninconsistent with rapid quenching models and neither the analytic bathtub model\nnor the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation can reproduce the rapid cosmic\nevolution. We propose a new gentler model of galaxy evolution that can explain\nthe new Herschel results and other key properties of the galaxy population.\n", "  We investigate the stellar mass loss of gas rich galaxies falling into\nclusters due to the change in the gravitational potential caused by the ram\npressure stripping of their gas. We model the satellites with exponential\nstellar and gas disk profiles, assume rapid ram pressure stripping, and follow\nthe stellar orbits in the shocked potential. Due to the change of the\npotential, the stars move from circular orbits to elliptical orbits with\napocenters that are often outside the tidal radius, causing those stars to be\nstripped. We explore the impact of the redshift of infall, gas fraction,\nsatellite halo mass and cluster mass on this process. The puffing of the\nsatellites makes them appear as ultra diffuse galaxies, and the stripped stars\ncontribute to the intracluster light. Our results show these effects are most\nsignificant for less-massive satellites, which have larger gas fractions when\nthey are accreted into clusters. The preferential destruction of low mass\nsystems causes the red fraction of cluster galaxies to be smaller at lower\nmasses, an observation that is otherwise difficult to explain.\n", "  I studied giant discy galaxies with optical radii more than 30 kpc. The\ncomparison of these systems with discy galaxies of moderate sizes revealed that\nthey tend to have higher rotation velocities, B-band luminosities, HI masses\nand dark-to-luminous mass ratios. The giant discs follow the trend $\\log(M_{\\rm\nHI})(R_{25})$ found for normal size galaxies. It indicates the absence of the\npeculiarities of evolution of star formation in these galaxies. The HI mass to\nluminosity ratio of giant galaxies appears not to differ from that of normal\nsize galaxies, giving evidences in favor of similar star formation efficiency.\nI also found that the bars and rings occur more frequently among giant discs. I\nperformed mass-modelling of the subsample of 18 giant galaxies with available\nrotation curves and surface photometry data and constructed $\\chi^2$ maps for\nthe parameters of their dark matter haloes. These estimates indicate that giant\ndiscs tend to be formed in larger more massive and rarified dark haloes in\ncomparison to moderate size galaxies. However giant galaxies do not deviate\nsignificantly from the relations between the optical sizes and dark halo\nparameters for moderate size galaxies. These findings can rule out the\ncatastrophic scenario of the formation of at least most of giant discs, since\nthey follow the same relations as normal discy galaxies. The giant sizes of the\ndiscs can be due to the high radial scale of the dark matter haloes in which\nthey were formed.\n", "  We explore the electronic structure of ultralong-range pentaatomic Rydberg\nmolecules from a merger of a Rydberg atom and two ground state heteronuclear\ndiatomic molecules. Our focus is on the interaction of Rb($23s$) and Rb($n=20$,\n$l\\ge 3$) Rydberg states with ground and rotationally excited KRb diatomic\npolar molecules. For symmetric and asymmetric configurations of the pentaatomic\nRydberg molecule, we investigate the metamorphosis of the Born-Oppenheimer\npotential curves, essential for the binding of the molecule, with varying\ndistance from the Rydberg core and analyze the alignment and orientation of the\npolar diatomic molecules.\n", "  We focus on the response of mechanically stable (MS) packings of\nfrictionless, bidisperse disks to thermal fluctuations, with the aim of\nquantifying how nonlinearities affect system properties at finite temperature.\nPackings of disks with purely repulsive contact interactions possess two main\ntypes of nonlinearities, one from the form of the interaction potential and one\nfrom the breaking (or forming) of interparticle contacts. To identify the\ntemperature regime at which the contact-breaking nonlinearities begin to\ncontribute, we first calculated the minimum temperatures $T_{cb}$ required to\nbreak a single contact in the MS packing for both single and multiple eigenmode\nperturbations of the $T=0$ MS packing. We then studied deviations in the\nconstant volume specific heat $C_V$ and deviations of the average disk\npositions $\\Delta r$ from their $T=0$ values in the temperature regime $T_{cb}\n< T < T_{r}$, where $T_r$ is the temperature beyond which the system samples\nthe basin of a new MS packing. We find that the deviation in the specific heat\nper particle $\\Delta {\\overline C}_V^0/{\\overline C}_V^0$ relative to the zero\ntemperature value ${\\overline C}_V^0$ can grow rapidly above $T_{cb}$, however,\nthe deviation $\\Delta {\\overline C}_V^0/{\\overline C}_V^0$ decreases as\n$N^{-1}$ with increasing system size. To characterize the relative strength of\ncontact-breaking versus form nonlinearities, we measured the ratio of the\naverage position deviations $\\Delta r^{ss}/\\Delta r^{ds}$ for single- and\ndouble-sided linear and nonlinear spring interactions. We find that $\\Delta\nr^{ss}/\\Delta r^{ds} > 100$ for linear spring interactions and is independent\nof system size.\n", "  As part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM)\nproject we present an estimate of the mass of the supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) in the nearby fast-rotating early-type galaxy NGC4429, that is barred\nand has a boxy/peanut-shaped bulge. This estimate is based on Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) cycle-2 observations of the 12CO(3-2)\nemission line with a linear resolution of ~13 pc (0\"18x0\"14). NGC4429 has a\nrelaxed, flocculent nuclear disc of molecular gas that is truncated at small\nradii, likely due to the combined effects of gas stability and tidal shear. The\nwarm/dense 12CO(3-2) emitting gas is confined to the inner parts of this disc,\nlikely again because the gas becomes more stable at larger radii, preventing\nstar formation. The gas disc has a low velocity dispersion of\n2.2$^{+0.68}_{-0.65}$ km/s. Despite the inner truncation of the gas disc, we\nare able to model the kinematics of the gas and estimate a mass of\n(1.5$\\pm0.1^{+0.15}_{-0.35}$)$\\times$10$^8$ Msun for the SMBH in NGC4429 (where\nthe quoted uncertainties reflect the random and systematic uncertainties,\nrespectively), consistent with a previous upper limit set using ionised gas\nkinematics. We confirm that the V-band mass-to-light ratio changes by ~30%\nwithin the inner 400 pc of NGC4429, as suggested by other authors. This SMBH\nmass measurement based on molecular gas kinematics, the sixth presented in the\nliterature, once again demonstrates the power of ALMA to constrain SMBH masses.\n", "  One possible explanation of the cavity in debris discs is the gravitational\nperturbation of an embedded giant planet. Planetesimals passing close to a\nmassive body are dynamically stirred resulting in a cleared region known as the\nchaotic zone. Theory of overlapping mean-motion resonances predicts the width\nof this cavity. To test whether this cavity is identical to the chaotic zone,\nwe investigate the formation of cavities by means of collisionless N-body\nsimulations assuming a 1.25-10 Jupiter mass planet with eccentricities of\n0-0.9. Synthetic images at millimetre wavelengths are calculated to determine\nthe cavity properties by fitting an ellipse to 14 percent contour level.\nDepending on the planetary eccentricity, e_pl, the elliptic cavity wall rotates\nas the planet orbits with the same (e_pl<0.2) or half (e_pl>0.2) period that of\nthe planet. The cavity centre is offset from the star along the semi-major axis\nof the planet with a distance of d=0.1q^-0.17e_pl^0.5 in units of cavity size\ntowards the planet's orbital apocentre, where q is the planet-to-star mass\nratio. Pericentre (apocentre) glow develops for e_pl<0.05 (e_pl>0.1), while\nboth are present for 0.05<=e_pl<=0.1. Empirical formulae are derived for the\nsizes of the cavities: da_cav=2.35q^0.36 and da_cav=7.87q^0.37e_pl^0.38 for\ne_pl<=0.05 and e_pl>0.05, respectively. The cavity eccentricity, e_cav, equals\nto that of the planet only for 0.3<=e_pl<=0.6. A new method based on ALMA\nobservations for estimating the orbital parameters and mass of the planet\ncarving the cavity is also given.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the molecular gas in the fast AGN-driven\noutflow in the nearby radio-loud Seyfert galaxy IC 5063. Using ALMA\nobservations of a number of tracers (12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), 12CO(3-2), 13CO(2-1)\nand HCO+(4-3)), we map the differences in excitation, density and temperature\nof the gas. The results show that in the immediate vicinity of the radio jet, a\nfast outflow, with velocities up to 800 km/s, is occurring of which the gas has\nhigh excitation temperatures in the range 30-55 K, demonstrating the direct\nimpact of the jet on the ISM. The relative brightness of the CO lines show that\nthe outflow is optically thin. We estimate the mass of the molecular outflow to\nbe 1.2 x 10^6 Msol and likely to be a factor 2-3 larger. This is similar to\nthat of the outflow of atomic gas, but much larger than that of the ionised\noutflow, showing that the outflow is dominated by cold gas. The total mass\noutflow rate we estimate to be ~12 Msol/yr. The mass of the outflow is much\nsmaller than the total gas mass of the ISM of IC 5063. Therefore, although the\ninfluence of the radio jet is very significant in the inner regions, globally\nspeaking the impact will be very modest. We use RADEX modelling to explore the\nphysical conditions of the molecular gas in the outflow. Models with the\noutflowing gas being quite clumpy give the most consistent results and our\npreferred solutions have kinetic temperatures in the range 20-100 K and\ndensities between 10^5 and 10^6 cm^-3. The resulting pressures are 10^6-10^7.5\nK cm^-3, about two orders of magnitude higher than in the outer quiescent disk.\nThe results strongly suggest that the outflow is driven by the radio jet\nexpanding into a clumpy medium, creating a cocoon of gas which is pushed away\nfrom the jet axis resulting in a lateral outflow, very similar to what is\npredicted by numerical simulations.\n", "  Superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation are usually considered as two\nclosely related phenomena. Indeed, in most macroscopic quantum systems, like\nliquid helium, ultracold atomic Bose gases, and exciton-polaritons,\ncondensation and superfluidity occur in parallel. In photon Bose-Einstein\ncondensates realized in the dye microcavity system, thermalization does not\noccur by direct interaction of the condensate particles as in the above\ndescribed systems, i.e. photon-photon interactions, but by absorption and\nre-emission processes on the dye molecules, which act as a heat reservoir.\nCurrently, there is no experimental evidence for superfluidity in the dye\nmicrocavity system, though effective photon interactions have been observed\nfrom thermo-optic effects in the dye medium. In this work, we theoretically\ninvestigate the implications of effective thermo-optic photon interactions, a\ntemporally delayed and spatially non-local effect, on the photon condensate,\nand derive the resulting Bogoliubov excitation spectrum. The calculations\nsuggest a linear photon dispersion at low momenta, fulfilling the Landau's\ncriterion of superfluidity . We envision that the temporally delayed and\nlong-range nature of the thermo-optic photon interaction offer perspectives for\nnovel quantum fluid phenomena.\n", "  We have conducted a search of a 9 deg$^{2}$ region of the CFHTLS around the\nMilky Way analog M101 (D$\\sim$7 Mpc), in order to look for previously unknown\nlow surface brightness galaxies. This search has uncovered 38 new low surface\nbrightness dwarf candidates, and confirmed 11 previously reported galaxies, all\nwith central surface brightness $\\mu$(g,0)$>$23mag/arcsec$^{2}$, potentially\nextending the satellite luminosity function for the M101 group by $\\sim$1.2\nmagnitudes. The search was conducted using an algorithm that nearly automates\nthe detection of diffuse dwarf galaxies. The candidates small size and low\nsurface brightness means that the faintest of these objects would likely be\nmissed by traditional visual or computer detection techniques. The dwarf galaxy\ncandidates span a range of $-$7.1 $\\geq$ M$_g$ $\\geq$ $-$10.2 and half light\nradii of 118-540 pc at the distance of M101, and they are well fit by simple\nS\\'{e}rsic surface brightness profiles. These properties are consistent with\ndwarfs in the Local Group, and to match the Local Group luminosity function\n$\\sim$10-20 of these candidates should be satellites of M101. Association with\na massive host is supported by the lack of detected star formation and the over\ndensity of candidates around M101 compared to the field. The spatial\ndistribution of the dwarf candidates is highly asymmetric, and concentrated to\nthe northeast of M101 and therefore distance measurements will be required to\ndetermine if these are genuine members of the M101 group.\n", "  We study the change in the resurgent asymptotic properties of a trans-series\nin two parameters, a coupling $g^2$ and a gauge index $N$, as a system passes\nthrough a large $N$ phase transition, using the universal example of the\nGross-Witten-Wadia third-order phase transition in the unitary matrix model.\nThis transition is well-studied in the immediate vicinity of the transition\npoint, where it is characterized by a double-scaling limit Painlev\\'e II\nequation, and also away from the transition point using the pre-string\ndifference equation. Here we present a complementary analysis of the transition\nat all coupling and all finite N, in terms of a differential equation, using\nthe explicit Tracy-Widom mapping of the Gross-Witten-Wadia partition function\nto a solution of a Painlev\\'e III equation. This mapping provides a simple\nmethod to generate trans-series expansions in all parameter regimes, and to\nstudy their transmutation as the parameters are varied. For example, at any\nfinite N the weak coupling expansion is divergent, with a non-perturbative\ntrans-series completion; on the other hand, the strong coupling expansion is\nconvergent, and yet there is still a non-perturbative trans-series completion.\nWe show how the different instanton terms `condense' at the transition point to\nmatch with the double-scaling limit trans-series. We also define a uniform\nlarge N strong-coupling expansion (a non-linear analogue of uniform WKB), which\nis much more precise than the conventional large N expansion through the\ntransition region, and apply it to the evaluation of Wilson loops.\n", "  Based on new Chandra X-ray telescope data, we present empirical evidence of\nplasma Compton cooling during a flare in the non pulsating massive X-ray binary\n4U1700-37. This behaviour might be explained by quasispherical accretion onto a\nslowly rotating magnetised neutron star. In quiescence, the neutron star in\n4U1700-37 is surrounded by a hot radiatively cooling shell. Its presence is\nsupported by the detection of mHz quasi periodic oscillations likely produced\nby its convection cells. The high plasma temperature and the relatively low\nX-ray luminosity observed during the quiescence, point to a small emitting area\nabout 1 km, compatible with a hot spot on a NS surface. The sudden transition\nfrom a radiative to a significantly more efficient Compton cooling regime\ntriggers an episode of enhanced accretion resulting in a flare. During the\nflare, the plasma temperature drops quickly. The predicted luminosity for such\ntransitions, Lx = 3 x 10^35 erg s-1, is very close to the luminosity of\n4U1700-37 during quiescence. The transition may be caused by the accretion of a\nclump in the stellar wind of the donor star. Thus, a magnetised NS nature of\nthe compact object is strongly favoured.\n", "  We present the results of targeted observations and a survey of 1612-, 1665-,\nand 1667-MHz circumstellar OH maser emission from asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars and red supergiants (RSGs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using the\nParkes and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes. No clear OH\nmaser emission has been detected in any of our observations targeting luminous,\nlong-period, large-amplitude variable stars, which have been confirmed\nspectroscopically and photometrically to be mid- to late-M spectral type. These\nobservations have probed 3 - 4 times deeper than any OH maser survey in the\nSMC. Using a bootstrapping method with LMC and Galactic OH/IR star samples and\nour SMC observation upper limits, we have calculated the likelihood of not\ndetecting maser emission in any of the two sources considered to be the top\nmaser candidates to be less than 0.05%, assuming a similar pumping mechanism as\nthe LMC and Galactic OH/IR sources. We have performed a population comparison\nof the Magellanic Clouds and used Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry to confirm\nthat we have observed all high luminosity SMC sources that are expected to\nexhibit maser emission. We suspect that, compared to the OH/IR stars in the\nGalaxy and LMC, the reduction in metallicity may curtail the dusty wind phase\nat the end of the evolution of the most massive cool stars. We also suspect\nthat the conditions in the circumstellar envelope change beyond a simple\nscaling of abundances and wind speed with metallicity.\n", "  ALMA [CII] line and continuum observations of five redshift z>6 quasars are\npresented. This sample was selected to probe lower black hole mass quasars than\nmost previous studies. We find a wide dispersion in properties with CFHQS\nJ0216-0455, a low-luminosity quasar with absolute magnitude M_1450=-22.2,\nremaining undetected implying a limit on the star formation rate in the host\ngalaxy of <10 solar masses per year, whereas other host galaxies have star\nformation rates up to hundreds of solar masses per year. Two other quasars have\nparticularly interesting properties. VIMOS2911 is one of the least luminous z>6\nquasars known with M_1450=-23.1, yet its host galaxy is experiencing a very\npowerful starburst. PSO J167-13 has a broad and luminous [CII] line and a\nneighbouring galaxy a projected distance of 5kpc away that is also detected in\nthe [CII] line and continuum. Combining with similar observations from the\nliterature, we study the ratio of [CII] line to far-infrared luminosity finding\nthis ratio increases at high-redshift at a fixed far-infrared luminosity,\nlikely due to lower dust content, lower metallicity and/or higher gas masses.\nWe compile a sample of 21 high-redshift quasars with dynamical masses and\ninvestigate the relationship between black hole mass and dynamical mass. The\nnew observations presented here reveal dynamical masses consistent with the\nrelationship defined by local galaxies. However, the full sample shows a very\nwide scatter across the black hole mass - dynamical mass plane, whereas both\nthe local relationship and simulations of high-redshift quasars show a much\nlower dispersion in dynamical mass.\n", "  Hybrid pixel sensor technology such as the Medipix3 represents a unique tool\nfor electron imaging. We have investigated its performance as a direct imaging\ndetector using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) which incorporated a\nMedipix3 detector with a 300 micrometre thick silicon layer compromising of\n256x256 pixels at 55 micrometre pixel pitch. We present results taken with the\nMedipix3 in Single Pixel Mode (SPM) with electron beam energies in the range,\n60 to 200 keV. Measurements of the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and the\nDetective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) were investigated. At a given beam energy,\nthe MTF data was acquired by deploying the established knife edge technique.\nSimilarly, the experimental data required to DQE was obtained by acquiring a\nstack of images of a focused beam and of free space (flatfield) to determine\nthe Noise Power Spectrum (NPS).\n", "  Martin & Lubow (2017) showed through simulations that an initially tilted\ndisc around an eccentric binary can evolve to polar alignment in which the disc\nlies perpendicular to the binary orbital plane. We apply linear theory to show\nboth analytically and numerically that a nearly polar aligned low mass\ncircumbinary disc evolves to polar alignment and determine the alignment\ntimescale. Significant disc evolution towards the polar state around moderately\neccentric binaries can occur for typical protostellar disc parameters in less\nthan a typical disc lifetime for binaries with orbital periods of order 100\nyears or less. Resonant torques are much less effective at truncating the inner\nparts of circumbinary polar discs than the inner parts of coplanar discs. For\npolar discs, they vanish for a binary eccentricity of unity. The results agree\nwith the simulations in showing that discs can evolve to a polar state.\nCircumbinary planets may then form in such discs and reside on polar orbits.\n", "  A former member of the Hyades cluster, $\\iota$ Horologii ($\\iota$ Hor) is a\nplanet-hosting Sun-like star which displays the shortest coronal activity cycle\nknown to date ($P_{\\rm cyc}\\sim$ 1.6 yr). With an age of $\\sim$$625$ Myr,\n$\\iota$ Hor is also the youngest star with a detected activity cycle. The study\nof its magnetic properties holds the potential to provide fundamental\ninformation to understand the origin of cyclic activity and stellar magnetism\nin late-type stars. In this series of articles, we present the results of a\ncomprehensive project aimed at studying the evolving magnetic field in this\nstar and how this evolution influences its circumstellar environment. This\npaper summarizes the first stage of this investigation, with results from a\nlong-term observing campaign of $\\iota$ Hor using ground-based high-resolution\nspectropolarimetry. The analysis includes precise measurements of the magnetic\nactivity and radial velocity of the star, and their multiple time-scales of\nvariability. In combination with values reported in the literature, we show\nthat the long-term chromospheric activity evolution of $\\iota$ Hor follows a\nbeating pattern, caused by the superposition of two periodic signals of similar\namplitude at $P_{1} \\simeq 1.97 \\pm 0.02$ yr and $P_{2} \\simeq 1.41 \\pm 0.01$\nyr. Additionally, using the most recent parameters for $\\iota$ Hor b in\ncombination with our activity and radial velocity measurements, we find that\nstellar activity dominates the radial velocity residuals, making the detection\nof additional planets in this system challenging. Finally, we report here the\nfirst measurements of the surface longitudinal magnetic field strength of\n$\\iota$ Hor, which displays varying amplitudes within $\\pm4$ G and served to\nestimate the rotation period of the star ($P_{\\rm rot} =~7.70^{+0.18}_{-0.67}$\nd).\n", "  We evaluate the effect of structure formation on the average expansion rate\nwith a statistical treatment where density peaks and troughs are modelled as\nhomogeneous ellipsoids. This extends earlier work that used spherical regions.\nWe find that the shear and the presence of filamentary and planar structures\nhave only a small impact on the results. The expansion rate times the age of\nthe universe $Ht$ increases from 2/3 to 0.83 at late times, in order of\nmagnitude agreement with observations, although the change is slower and takes\nlonger than in the real universe. We discuss shortcomings that have to be\naddressed for this and similar statistical models in the literature to develop\ninto realistic quantitative treatment of backreaction.\n", "  We have measured the absolute proper motion of the Sextans dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy using Subaru Suprime-Cam images taken at three epochs, with a time\nbaseline of ~ 10 years. We astrometrically calibrate each epoch by constructing\ndistortion-correction maps from the best available Subaru Suprime-Cam dithered\ndata sets and from Gaia DR1 positions. The magnitude limit of the proper-motion\nstudy is V ~ 24. The area covered is 26.7 x 23.3 arcmin, which is still within\nthe core radius of Sextans. The derived proper motion is (mu_a, mu_d) = (-0.409\n+/- 0.050, -0.047 +/- 0.058) mas/yr. The direction of motion is perpendicular\nto the major axis of the galaxy. Our measurement, combined with radial velocity\nand distance from the literature, implies a low eccentricity orbit, with a\nmoderate inclination to the Galactic plane, and a period of 3 Gyr. Sextans is\nnow some 0.4 Gyr away from its pericenter ( r_peri ~ 75 kpc), moving toward its\napocenter (r_apo ~ 132 kpc). Its orbit is inconsistent with membership to the\nvast polar structure of Galactic satellites.\n", "  In this paper we consider the evaluation of the Araki-Sucher correction for\narbitrary many-electron atomic and molecular systems. This contribution appears\nin the leading order quantum electrodynamics corrections to the energy of a\nbound state. The conventional one-electron basis set of Gaussian-type orbitals\n(GTOs) is adopted; this leads to two-electron matrix elements which are\nevaluated with help of generalised the McMurchie-Davidson scheme. We also\nconsider the convergence of the results towards the complete basis set. A\nrigorous analytic result for the convergence rate is obtained and verified by\ncomparing with independent numerical values for the helium atom. Finally, we\npresent a selection of numerical examples and compare our results with the\navailable reference data for small systems. In contrast with other methods used\nfor the evaluation of the Araki-Sucher correction, our method is not restricted\nto few-electron atoms or molecules. This is illustrated by calculations for\nseveral many-electron atoms and molecules.\n", "  We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of AzV322, an emission line\nobject located in the Small Magellanic Cloud previously classified between O9\nand B0. We analyze 17.5 years of $I$ and $V$ band OGLE-II, III and IV light\ncurves and find four significant frequencies, viz. $f_1$= 0.386549 $\\pm$\n0.000003, $f_2$= 0.101177 $\\pm$ 0.000005, $f_3$= 0.487726 $\\pm$ 0.000015 and\n$f_4$= 0.874302 $\\pm$ 0.000020 c/d. The $f_1$ frequency (period 2.58700 $\\pm$\n0.00002 days) provides the stronger periodogram peak and gives a single wave\nlight curve of full amplitude 0.066 mag in the $I$-band. High-resolution\noptical spectroscopy confirms the early B-type spectral type and reveals\nprominent double peak Balmer, Paschen, OI 8446 and HeI 5875 emissions. The\nspectral energy distribution shows significant color excess towards long\nwavelengths possibly attributed to free-free emission in a disk-like envelope.\nOur analysis yields $T_{eff}$ = 23000 $\\pm$ 1500 K, log g = 3.0 $\\pm$ 0.5, $M$\n= 16 $\\pm$ 1 M$_{\\odot}$, $R$ = 31.0 $\\pm$ 1.1 R$_{\\odot}$, and $L_{bol}$ =\n10$^{4.87 \\pm 0.06}$ $L_{\\odot}$. AzV322 might be a member of the new class of\nslowly pulsating B supergiants introduced by Saio et al. (2006) and documented\nby Lefever, Puls & Aerts (2007), however its circumstellar disk make it an\nhitherto unique object. Furthermore, we notice that a O-C analysis for $f_1$\nreveals quasi-cyclic changes for the times of maximum in a time scale of 20\nyears which might indicate a light-travel time effect in a very wide orbit\nbinary with an undetected stellar component.\n", "  The reaction $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\Lambda^+_c\\bar\\Lambda^-_c$ is investigated\nat energies close to the threshold with emphasis on the role played by the\n$X(4630)$ resonance. The interaction in the final $\\Lambda^+_c \\bar\\Lambda^-_c$\nsystem, constructed within chiral effective field theory and supplemented by a\npole diagram that represents a bare $X(4630)$ resonance, is taken into account\nrigorously. The pole parameters of the $X(4630)$ are extracted and found to be\ncompatible with the ones of the $X(4660)$ resonance that have been established\nin the reaction $e^+e^- \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(2S)$. The actual result for the\n$X(4630)$ is $M = (4652.5\\pm 3.4)$ MeV and $\\Gamma = (62.6\\pm 5.6)$ MeV.\nPredictions for the $\\Lambda^+_c$ electromagnetic form factors in the timelike\nregion are presented.\n", "  We apply the average null energy condition to obtain upper bounds on the\nthree-point function coefficients of stress tensors and a scalar operator,\n$\\langle TT {\\cal O } \\rangle,$ in general CFTs. We also constrain the\ngravitational anomaly of $U(1)$ currents in four-dimensional CFTs, which are\nencoded in three-point functions of the form $\\langle TT J \\rangle$. In\ntheories with a large $N$ AdS dual we translate these bounds into constraints\non the coefficient of a higher derivative bulk term of the form $\\int\n\\phi\\hspace{.5mm} W^2 $. We speculate that these bounds also apply in\nde-Sitter. In this case our results constrain inflationary observables, such as\nthe amplitude for chiral gravity waves that originate from higher derivative\nterms in the Lagrangian of the form $\\phi \\hspace{.5mm}W W^*$.\n", "  Copper borate Cu$_3$(BO$_3$)$_2$ is a complex compound with a layered\ncrystallographic structure in which the Jahn-Teller active and magnetic copper\nCu$^{2+}$ ions occupy sixteen nonequivalent positions in the unit cell\ndisplaying controversial magnetic behavior. In this paper, we report on the\ninfrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of the lattice dynamics and the\nelectronic structure of 3$d^9$ copper states below the fundamental absorption\nband. The lattice dynamics is characterized by a large number of phonons due to\na low $P\\overline{1}$ space group symmetry and a large unit cell with Z=10.\nUnusually rich set of phonons was found in the low-energy part of the infrared\nand Raman spectra below 100 cm$^{-1}$, which we tentatively assign to\ninterlayer vibrations activated by a crystal superstructure and/or to weak\nforce constants for modes related to some structural groups. Several phonons\nshow anomalous behavior in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition at\n$T_N$=10 K thus evidencing magnetoelastic interaction. No new phonons were\nfound below $T_N$, which excludes the spin-Peierls type of the magnetic\ntransition. In the region of electronic transitions, a strong broad absorption\nband centered at $\\sim$1.8 eV is observed, which we assign to overlapping of\ntransitions between the 3$d^9$ states of Cu$^{2+}$ ions split by the crystal\nfield in nonequivalent positions. The fundamental charge-transfer absorption\nband edge has a complex structure and is positioned around $\\sim$2.8-3.0 eV.\n", "  We study the dust concentration and emission in protoplanetary disks\nvortices. We extend the Lyra-Lin solution for the dust concentration of a\nsingle grain size to a power-law distribution of grain sizes $n(a) \\propto\na^{-p}$. Assuming dust conservation in the disk, we find an analytic dust\nsurface density as a function of the grain radius. We calculate the increase of\nthe dust to gas mass ratio $\\epsilon$ and the slope $p$ of the dust size\ndistribution due to grain segregation within the vortex. We apply this model to\na numerical simulation of a disk containing a persistent vortex. Due to the\naccumulation of large grains towards the vortex center, $\\epsilon$ increases by\na factor of 10 from the background disk value, and $p$ decreases from 3.5 to\n3.0. We find the disk emission at millimeter wavelengths corresponding to\nsynthetic observations with ALMA and VLA. The simulated maps at 7 mm and 1 cm\nshow a strong azimuthal asymmetry. This happens because, at these wavelengths,\nthe disk becomes optically thin while the vortex remains optically thick. The\nlarge vortex opacity is mainly due to an increase in the dust to gas mass\nratio. In addition, the change in the slope of the dust size distribution\nincreases the opacity by a factor of 2. We also show that the inclusion of the\ndust scattering opacity substantially changes the disks images.\n", "  We use the SU(2) 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole configuration, and its BPS\nversion, to test the integral equations of the Yang-Mills theory. Those\nintegral equations involve two (complex) parameters which do not appear in the\ndifferential Yang-Mills equations, and if they are considered to be arbitrary\nit then implies that non-abelian gauge theories (but not abelian ones) possess\nan infinity of integral equations. For static monopole configurations only one\nof those parameters is relevant. We expand the integral Yang-Mills equation in\na power series of that parameter and show that the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole\nand its BPS version satisfy the integral equations obtained in first and second\norder of that expansion. Our results points to the importance of exploring the\nphysical consequences of such an infinity of integral equations on the global\nproperties of the Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  We have recently presented strong evidence that chaotic orbits that obey one\nisolating integral besides energy exist in a toy Hamiltonian model with three\ndegrees of freedom and are bounded by regular orbits that isolate them from the\nArnold web. The interval covered by those numerical experiments was equivalent\nto about one million Hubble times in a galactic context. Here we use a four\ndimensional map to confirm our previous results and to extend that interval\nfifty times. We show that, at least within that interval, features found in\nlower dimension Hamiltonian systems and maps are also present in our study,\ne.g., within the phase space occupied by a chaotic orbit that obeys one\nintegral there are subspaces where that orbit does not enter and are, instead,\noccupied by regular orbits that, if tori, bound other chaotic orbits obeying\none integral and, if cantori, produce stickiness. We argue that the validity of\nour results might exceed the time intervals covered by the numerical\nexperiments.\n", "  We demonstrate that a weak external magnetic field can induce negative\nmagneto-thermal-resistance for magnons in a disordered two-dimensional\nantiferromagnet. We study the main effect of a weak external magnetic field on\nthe longitudinal thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_{xx}$, for a disordered\nantiferromagnet using the weak-localization theory for magnons. We show that\nthe weak-localization correction term of $\\kappa_{xx}$ positively increases\nwith increasing the magnetic field parallel to the ordered spins. Since this\nincrease corresponds to a decrease of the thermal resistivity, this phenomenon\nis negative magneto-thermal-resistance for magnons. This negative\nmagneto-thermal-resistance and the weak localization of magnons will be used to\ncontrol the magnon thermal current in antiferromagnetic spintronics devices. We\nalso discuss several implications for further experimental and theoretical\nstudies for disordered magnets.\n", "  In this paper we use the effective blackfold description of branes to extend\nthe study of the thermal BIon, a D-brane and parallel anti-D-brane connected by\na wormhole with F-string charge in hot flat space, by introducing a radial\nboost along the brane. The boosted system behaves qualitatively differently\nfrom both the extremal and the thermal BIon considered previously.\nInterestingly, we are able to formulate a first law of thermodynamics for the\nsystem as a whole, despite the fact that it is not a stationary blackfold. In\nparticular, the global temperature is given by the rest frame temperature times\nthe gamma factor of special relativity which is the inverse transformation\ncompared to the case of stationary blackfolds. In addition we define two new\nkinds of thermodynamic conjugate variables, the energy flux $W$ and the\nintegrated velocity on the brane. We find that a phase transition occurs by\nvarying the energy flux $W$. Below a critical value of $W$ the brane separation\n$\\Delta$ changes only slightly with $W$. Instead above the critical value\n$\\Delta$ grows exponentially.\n", "  We present a first attempt to derive the full (type-A and type-B) Weyl\nanomaly of four dimensional conformal higher spin (CHS) fields in a holographic\nway. We obtain the type-A and type-B Weyl anomaly coefficients for the whole\nfamily of 4D CHS fields from the one-loop effective action for massless higher\nspin (MHS) Fronsdal fields evaluated on a 5D bulk Poincar\\'e-Einstein metric\nwith an Einstein metric on its conformal boundary. To gain access to the type-B\nanomaly coefficient we assume, for practical reasons, a Lichnerowicz-type\ncoupling of the bulk Fronsdal fields with the bulk background Weyl tensor.\nRemarkably enough, our holographic findings under this simplifying assumption\nare certainly not unknown: they match the results previously found on the\nboundary counterpart under the assumption of factorization of the CHS\nhigher-derivative kinetic operator into Laplacians of \"partially massless\"\nhigher spins on Einstein backgrounds.\n", "  Circumstellar discs with large dust depleted cavities and vigorous accretion\nonto the central star are often considered signposts for (multiple) giant\nplanet formation. In this letter we show that X-ray photoevaporation operating\nin discs with modest (factors 3-10) gas-phase depletion of Carbon and Oxygen at\nlarge radii (> 15 AU) yield the inner radius and accretion rates for most of\nthe observed discs, without the need to invoke giant planet formation. We\npresent one-dimensional viscous evolution models of discs affected by X-ray\nphotoevaporation assuming moderate gas-phase depletion of Carbon and Oxygen,\nwell within the range reported by recent observations. Our models use a\nsimplified prescription for scaling the X-ray photoevaporation rates and\nprofiles at different metallicity, and our quantitative result depends on this\nscaling. While more rigorous hydrodynamical modelling of mass loss profiles at\nlow metallicities is required to constrain the observational parameter space\nthat can be explained by our models, the general conclusion that metal\nsequestering at large radii may be responsible for the observed diversity of\ntransition discs is shown to be robust. Gap opening by giant planet formation\nmay still be responsible for a number of observed transition discs with large\ncavities and very high accretion rate.\n", "  We consider a class of generalizations of the Skyrme model to five spacetime\ndimensions ($d=5$), which is defined in terms of an $O(5)$ sigma model. A\nspecial ansatz for the Skyrme field allows angular momentum to be present and\nequations of motion with a radial dependence only. Using it, we obtain: 1)\neverywhere regular solutions describing localised energy lumps (Skyrmions); 2)\nSelf-gravitating, asymptotically flat, everywhere non-singular solitonic\nsolutions (Skyrme stars), upon minimally coupling the model to Einstein's\ngravity; 3) both static and spinning black holes with Skyrme hair, the latter\nwith rotation in two orthogonal planes, with both angular momenta of equal\nmagnitude. In the absence of gravity we present an analytic solution that\nsatisfies a BPS-type bound and explore numerically some of the non-BPS\nsolutions. In the presence of gravity, we contrast the solutions to this model\nwith solutions to a complex scalar field model, namely boson stars and black\nholes with synchronised hair. Remarkably, even though the two models present\nkey differences, and in particular the Skyrme model allows static hairy black\nholes, when introducing rotation, the synchronisation condition becomes\nmandatory, providing further evidence for its generality in obtaining rotating\nhairy black holes.\n", "  The composition and morphology of the interstellar medium in starburst\ngalaxies has been well investigated, but the magnetic field properties are\nstill uncertain. The nearby starburst galaxy M82 provides a unique opportunity\nto investigate the mechanisms leading to the amplification and reduction of\nturbulent and regular magnetic fields. Possible scenarios of the contribution\nof the magnetic field to the star-formation rate are evaluated. Archival data\nfrom the VLA and WSRT were combined and re-reduced to cover the wavelength\nregime between 3cm and 22cm. All observations revealed polarised emission in\nthe inner part of the galaxy, while extended polarised emission up to a\ndistance of 2kpc from the disk was only detected at 18cm and 22cm. The\nobservations hint at a magnetised bar in the inner part of the galaxy. We\ncalculate the mass inflow rate due to magnetic stress of the bar to 7.1 solar\nmasses per year, which can be a significant contribution to the star-formation\nrate of M82 of approximately 13 solar masses per year. The halo shows polarised\nemission, which might be the remnant of a regular disk field. Indications for a\nhelical field in the inner part of the outflow cone are provided. The coherence\nlength of the magnetic field in the centre is similar to the size of giant\nmolecular clouds. Using polarisation spectra more evidence for a close coupling\nof the ionised gas and the magnetic field as well as a two-phase magnetic field\ntopology were found. Electron densities in the halo are similar to the ones\nfound in the Milky Way. The magnetic field morphology is similar to the one in\nother nearby starburst galaxies with possible large-scale magnetic loops in the\nhalo and a helical magnetic field inside the outflow cones. The special\ncombination of a magnetic bar and a circumnuclear ring are able to\nsignificantly raise the star-formation rate in this galaxy by magnetic braking.\n", "  We studied the spatial distribution of young and old stellar populations\nalong the western half part of the minor axis of the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) using Washington MT1 photometry of selected fields, which span a\ndeprojected distance range from the LMC bar centre out to ~ 31.6 kpc. We found\nthat both stellar populations share a mean LMC limiting radius of 8.9+-0.4 kpc;\nold populations are three times more dense that young populations at that LMC\nlimit. When comparing this result with recent values for the LMC extension due\nto north, the old populations resulted significantly more elongated than the\nyoung ones. Bearing in mind previous claims that the elongation of the\noutermost LMC regions may be due to the tidal effects of the Milky Way (MW),\nour findings suggest that such a tidal interaction should not have taken place\nrecently. The existence of young populations in the outermost western regions\nalso supports previous results about ram pressure stripping effects of the LMC\ngaseous disc due to the motion of the LMC in the MW halo.\n", "  Protein adsorption at the solid-liquid interface is an important phenomenon\nthat often can be observed as a first step in biological processes. Despite its\ninherent importance, still relatively little is known about the underlying\nmicroscopic mechanisms. Here, using multivalent ions, we demonstrate the\ncontrol of the interactions and the corresponding adsorption of net-negatively\ncharged proteins (bovine serum albumin) at a solid-liquid interface. This is\ndemonstrated by ellipsometry and corroborated by neutron reflectivity and\nquartz-crystal microbalance experiments. We show that the reentrant\ncondensation observed within the rich bulk phase behavior of the system\nfeaturing a nonmonotonic dependence of the second virial cofficient on salt\nconcentration c_s is reflected in an intriguing way in the protein adsorption\nd(c_s) at the interface. Our findings are successfully described and understood\nby a model of ion-activated patchy interactions within the framework of\nclassical density functional theory. In addition to the general challenge of\nconnecting bulk and interface behavior, our work has implications for, inter\nalia, nucleation at interfaces.\n", "  We describe a joint high contrast imaging survey for planets at Keck and VLT\nof the last large sample of debris disks identified by the Spitzer Space\nTelescope. No new substellar companions were discovered in our survey of 30\nSpitzer-selected targets. We combine our observations with data from four\npublished surveys to place constraints on the frequency of planets around 130\ndebris disk single stars, the largest sample to date. For a control sample, we\nassembled contrast curves from several published surveys targeting 277 stars\nwhich do not show infrared excesses. We assumed a double power law distribution\nin mass and semi-major axis of the form f(m,a) = $Cm^{\\alpha}a^{\\beta}$, where\nwe adopted power law values and logarithmically flat values for the mass and\nsemi-major axis of planets. We find that the frequency of giant planets with\nmasses 5-20 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ and separations 10-1000 AU around stars with debris\ndisks is 6.27% (68% confidence interval 3.68 - 9.76%), compared to 0.73% (68%\nconfidence interval 0.20 - 1.80%) for the control sample of stars without\ndisks. These distributions differ at the 88% confidence level, tentatively\nsuggesting distinctness of these samples.\n", "  We present measurements of the fractal dimension of a turbulent\nasymptotically anti-deSitter black brane reconstructed from simulated boundary\nfluid data at the perfect fluid order using the fluid-gravity duality. We argue\nthat the boundary fluid energy spectrum scaling as $E(k)\\sim k^{-2}$ is a more\nnatural setting for the fluid-gravity duality than the Kraichnan-Kolmogorov\nscaling of $E(k) \\sim k^{-5/3}$, but we obtain fractal dimensions $D$ for\nspatial sections of the horizon $H\\cap\\Sigma$ in both cases: $D=2.584(1)$ and\n$D=2.645(4)$, respectively. These results are consistent with the upper bound\nof $D=3$, thereby resolving the tension with the recent claim in Adams,\nChesler, Liu (2014) that $D=3+1/3$. We offer a critical examination of the\ncalculation which led to their result, and show that their proposed definition\nof fractal dimension performs poorly as a fractal dimension estimator on\n$1$-dimensional curves with known fractal dimension. Finally, we describe how\nto define and in principle calculate the fractal dimension of spatial sections\nof the horizon $H\\cap \\Sigma$ in a covariant manner, and we speculate on\nassigning a `bootstrapped' value of fractal dimension to the entire horizon $H$\nwhen it is in a statistically quasi-steady turbulent state.\n", "  Floquet exceptional points correspond to the coalescence of two (or more)\nquasi-energies and corresponding Floquet eigenstates of a time-periodic\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian. They generally arise when the oscillation frequency\nsatisfies a multiphoton resonance condition. Here we discuss the interplay\nbetween Floquet exceptional points and the chiral dynamics observed, over\nseveral oscillation cycles, in a wide class of non-Hermitian systems when they\nare slowly cycled in opposite directions of parameter space.\n", "  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the\nelectronic and magnetic structures of a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer\nLi$_{2}$N. It is shown that bulk Li$_{3}$N is a non-magnetic semiconductor. The\nnon-spinpolarized DFT calculations show that $p$ electrons of N in 2D Li$_{2}$N\nform a narrow band at the Fermi energy $E_{\\rm{F}}$ due to a low coordination\nnumber, and the density of states at the Fermi energy ($g(E_{\\rm{F}}$)) is\nincreased as compared with bulk Li$_{3}$N. The large $g(E_{\\rm{F}}$) shows\ninstability towards magnetism in Stoner's mean field model. The spin-polarized\ncalculations reveal that 2D Li$_{2}$N is magnetic without intrinsic or impurity\ndefects. The magnetic moment of 1.0\\,$\\mu_{\\rm{B}}$ in 2D Li$_{2}$N is mainly\ncontributed by the $p_{z}$ electrons of N, and the band structure shows\nhalf-metallic behavior. {Dynamic instability in planar Li$_{2}$N monolayer is\nobserved, but a buckled Li$_{2}$N monolayer is found to be dynamically stable.}\nThe ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between the N atoms\nis also investigated to access the exchange field strength. {We found that\nplanar (buckled) 2D Li$_{2}$N is a ferromagnetic material with Curie\ntemperature $T_{c}$ of 161 (572) K.}\n", "  Using the rigorous path integral formalism of Feynman and Kac we prove\nLondon's eighty years old conjecture that during the superfluid transition in\nliquid helium Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) takes place. The result is\nobtained by proving first that at low enough temperatures macroscopic\npermutation cycles appear in the system, and then showing that this implies\nBEC. We find also that in the limit of zero temperature the infinite cycles\ncover the whole system, while BEC remains partial. For the Bose-condensed fluid\nat rest we define a macroscopic wave function. Via the equivalence of 1/2 spins\nand hard-core bosons the method extends to lattice models. We show that at low\nenough temperatures the spin-1/2 axially anisotropic Heisenberg models,\nincluding the isotropic ferro- and antiferromagnet and the XY model, undergo\nmagnetic ordering.\n", "  (abridged) The strong winds of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are important for the\nmechanical and chemical feedback of the most massive stars and determine\nwhether they end their lives as neutron stars or black holes. In this work we\ninvestigate theoretically the mass-loss properties of H-free WR stars of the\nnitrogen sequence (WN stars). We connect stellar structure models for He stars\nwith wind models for optically-thick winds and assess how both types of models\ncan simultaneously fulfill their respective sonic-point conditions. Fixing the\nouter wind law and terminal wind velocity, we obtain unique solutions for the\nmass-loss rates of optically-thick, radiatively-driven winds of WR stars in the\nphase of core He-burning. The resulting mass-loss relations as a function of\nstellar parameters, agree well with previous empirical relations. Furthermore,\nwe encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist.\nWhile these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they\nare in conflict with observations in the LMC. While our results confirm in\nparticular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that\nonly part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of\nthe standard assumptions of a smooth transonic flow and compact stellar core.\nThis means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inflated wind\nstructure, or deviations from the diffusion limit at the sonic point may have\nto be invoked. Qualitatively, the existence of mass limits for the formation of\nWR-type winds may be relevant for the non-detection of low-mass WR stars in\nbinary systems, which are believed to be progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae.\nThe sonic-point conditions derived in this work may provide a possibility to\ninclude optically-thick winds in stellar evolution models in a more physically\nmotivated form than in current models.\n", "  It was suggested that the large scale magnetic field can be dragged inwards\nefficiently by the corona above the disc, i.e., the so called \"coronal\nmechanism\" (Beckwith, Hawley, \\& Krolik 2009), which provides a way to solve\nthe difficulty of field advection in a geometrically thin accretion disc. In\nthis case, the magnetic pressure should be lower than the gas pressure in the\ncorona. We estimate the maximal power of the jets accelerated by the magnetic\nfield advected by the corona. The Blandford-Payne (BP) jet power is found\nalways to be higher than the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet power, except for a\nrapidly spinning black hole with a>0.8. The maximal jet power is always low,\nless than 0.05 Eddington luminosity, even for an extreme Kerr black hole, which\nis insufficient for the observed strong jets in some blazars with jet power\n$\\sim 0.1-1$ Eddington luminosity (or even higher). It implies that these\npowerful jets cannot be accelerated by the coronal field. We suggest that, the\nmagnetic field dragged inward by the accretion disc with magnetically outflows\nmay accelerate the jets (at least for the most powerful jets, if not all) in\nthe blazars.\n", "  The tunnelling of virtual matter-antimatter pairs from the quantum vacuum in\nmultidimensions is studied. We consider electric backgrounds as a linear\ncombination of a spatial Sauter field and, interchangeably, certain weaker time\ndependent fields without poles in the complex plane such as the sinusoidal and\nGaussian cases. Based on recent geometric considerations within the worldline\nformalism, we employ the relevant critical points in order to analytically\nestimate a characteristic threshold for the temporal inhomogeneity. We set\nappropriate initial conditions and apply additional symmetry constraints in\norder to determine the classical periodic paths in spacetime. Using these\nworldline instantons, we compute the corresponding leading order exponential\nfactors showing large dynamical enhancement in general. We work out the main\ndifferences caused by the analytic structure of such composite backgrounds and\nalso discuss the case with a strong temporal variation of Sauter-type.\n", "  We have performed a timing and spectral analysis of a set of black-hole\nbinaries to study the correlation between the photon index and the time lag of\nthe hard photons with respect to the soft ones. We provide further evidence\nthat the timing and spectral properties in black-hole X-ray binaries are\ncoupled. In particular, we find that the average time lag increases as the\nX-ray emission becomes softer. Although a correlation between the hardness of\nthe X-ray spectrum and the time (or phase) lag has been reported in the past\nfor a handful of systems, our study confirms that this correlated behaviour is\na global property of black-hole X-ray binaries. We also demonstrate that the\nphoton-index - time-lag correlation can be explained as a result of inverse\nComptonization in a jet.\n", "  Water molecules adsorbed on inorganic substrates play an important role in\nseveral technological applications. In the presence of light atoms in\nadsorbates, nuclear quantum effects (NQE) influence properties of these\nsystems. In this work, we explore the impact of NQE on the dissociation of\nwater wires on stepped Pt(221) surfaces. By performing ab initio molecular\ndynamics simulations with van der Waals corrected density functional theory, we\nnote that several competing minima for both intact and dissociated structures\nare accessible at finite temperatures, making it important to assess whether\nharmonic estimates of the quantum free energy are sufficient to determine the\nrelative stability of the different states. We perform ab initio path integral\nmolecular dynamics (PIMD) in order to calculate these contributions taking into\naccount conformational entropy and anharmonicities at finite temperatures. We\npropose that when when adsorption is weak and NQE on the substrate are\nnegligible, PIMD simulations can be performed through a simple partition of the\nsystem, resulting in considerable computational savings. We calculate the\ncontribution of NQE to the free energies, including anharmonic terms. We find\nthat they result in an increase of up to 20% of the quantum contribution to the\ndissociation free energy compared to harmonic estimates. We also find that the\ndissociation has a negligible contribution from tunneling, but is dominated by\nZPE, which can enhance the rate by three orders of magnitude. Finally we\nhighlight how both temperature and NQE indirectly impact dipoles and the\nredistribution of electron density, causing work function to changes of up to\n0.4 eV with respect to static estimates. This quantitative determination of the\nchange in work function provides a possible approach to determine\nexperimentally the most stable configurations of water oligomers on the stepped\nsurfaces.\n", "  Working in the effective-mass approximation, we apply a powerful convergent\nperturbative technique of Turbiner's to the calculation of the ground state\nenergy and the wave function of an exciton confined to a three-dimensional\nparabolic quantum dot. Unlike the usual Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation\ntheory, Turbiner's approach works well even in the regime of strong coupling\nand does not require the knowledge of the full solution to the undisturbed\nproblem. The second-order convergent calculation presented below is in\nexcellent agreement with the results of exact numerical simulations for a wide\nrange of system's confinement parameters.\n", "  The prevalence of clouds in currently observable exoplanetary atmospheres\nmotivates the compilation and calculation of their optical properties. First,\nwe present a new open-source Mie scattering code known as LX-MIE, which is able\nto consider large size parameters ($\\sim 10^7$) using a single computational\ntreatment. We validate LX-MIE against the classical MIEV0 code as well as\nprevious studies. Second, we embark on an expanded survey of the published\nliterature for both the real and imaginary components of the refractive indices\nof 32 condensate species. As much as possible, we rely on experimental\nmeasurements of the refractive indices and resort to obtaining the real from\nthe imaginary component (or vice versa), via the Kramers-Kronig relation, only\nin the absence of data. We use these refractive indices as input for LX-MIE to\ncompute the absorption, scattering and extinction efficiencies of all 32\ncondensate species. Finally, we use a three-parameter function to provide\nconvenient fits to the shape of the extinction efficiency curve. We show that\nthe errors associated with these simple fits in the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3),\nJ, H and K wavebands are $\\sim 10\\%$. These fits allow for the extinction cross\nsection or opacity of the condensate species to be easily included in retrieval\nanalyses of transmission spectra. We discuss prospects for future experimental\nwork. The compilation of the optical constants and LX-MIE are publicly\navailable as part of the open-source Exoclime Simulation Platform\n(http://www.exoclime.org).\n", "  Aims: In light of recent discoveries of pulsating ULXs and recently\nintroduced models, that propose neutron stars (NSs) as the central engines of\nULXs, we revisit the (XMM-Newton and NuSTAR) spectra of eighteen well known\nULXs, in search of indications that favor this new hypothesis. Results: We\nconfirm the, previously noted, presence of the low energy (<6 keV) spectral\nrollover and argue that it could be interpreted as thermal emission. The\nspectra are well described by a double thermal model consisting of a \"hot\" (>1\nkeV) and a \"cool\" (<0.7 keV) multicolor black body (MCB). Under the assumption\nthat the \"cool\" MCD emission originates in a disk truncated at the NS\nmagnetosphere, we find that all ULXs in our sample are consistent with\naccretion onto a highly magnetized (B>10^12G) NS. We note a strong correlation\nbetween the strength of the magnetic field, the temperature of the \"hot\"\nthermal component and the total unabsorbed luminosity. Examination of the\nNuSTAR data supported this interpretation and confirmed the presence of a weak,\nhigh energy (>15 keV) tail, most likely the result of modification of the MCB\nemission by inverse Compton scattering. We also note that the apparent high\nenergy tail, may simply be the result of mis-modeling of MCB emission with an\natypical temperature (T) vs radius (r) gradient, using a standard MCD model\nwith a fixed gradient of T~r^-0.75. Conclusions: We have offered a new physical\ninterpretation for the dual-thermal spectra of ULXs. We find that the best-fit\nderived parameters, are in excellent agreement with recent predictions that\nfavor super-critically accreting NSs as the engines of a large fraction of\nULXs. Nevertheless, the considerable degeneracy between models and the lack of\nunequivocal evidence cannot rule out other equally plausible interpretations.\nOur results warrant further exploration of this new framework.\n", "  The possible detection of C_{24}, a planar graphene, recently reported in\nseveral planetary nebulae by Garciaa-Hernandez et al. (2011, 2012) inspires us\nto explore whether and how much graphene could exist in the interstellar medium\n(ISM) and how it would reveal its presence through its ultraviolet (UV)\nextinction and infrared (IR) emission. In principle, interstellar graphene\ncould arise from the photochemical processing of polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) molecules which are abundant in the ISM through a complete\nloss of their hydrogen atoms and/or from graphite which is thought to be a\nmajor dust species in the ISM through fragmentation caused by grain-grain\ncollisional shattering. Both quantum-chemical computations and laboratory\nexperiments have shown that the exciton-dominated electronic transitions in\ngraphene cause a strong absorption band near 2755 Angstrom. We calculate the UV\nabsorption of graphene and place an upper limit of ~5 ppm of C/H (i.e., ~1.9\\%\nof the total interstellar C) on the interstellar graphene abundance. We also\nmodel the stochastic heating of graphene C_{24} excited by single starlight\nphotons of the interstellar radiation field in the ISM and calculate its IR\nemission spectra. We also derive the abundance of graphene in the ISM to be <5\nppm of C/H by comparing the model emission spectra with that observed in the\nISM.\n", "  It is shown here that the Exact Exchange (EE) formalism provides a natural\nand rigorous approach for a Density Functional Theory (DFT) of the Integer\nQuantum Hall Effect (IQHE). Application of a novel EE method to a quasi\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (q2DEG) subjected to a perpendicular magnetic\nfield leads to the following main findings. \\textit{i)} the microscopic\nexchange energy functional of the IQHE has been obtained, whose main feature\nbeing that it minimizes with a discontinuous derivative at every integer\nfilling factor $\\nu$; \\textit{ii)} an analytical solution is found for the\nmagnetic-field dependent EE potential, in the one-subband regime; \\textit{iii)}\nas a consequence of \\textit{i)}, the EE potential display sharp discontinuities\nat every integer $\\nu$; and \\textit{iv)} the widely used Local Spin Density\nApproximation (LSDA) is strongly violated for filling factors close to integer\nvalues.\n", "  At the electron scales the power spectrum of solar-wind magnetic fluctuations\ncan be highly variable and the dissipation mechanisms of the magnetic energy\ninto the various particle species is under debate. In this paper we investigate\ndata from the Cluster mission's STAFF Search Coil magnetometer when the level\nof turbulence is sufficiently high that the morphology of the power spectrum at\nelectron scales can be investigated. The Cluster spacecraft sample a disturbed\ninterval of plasma where two streams of solar wind interact. Meanwhile, several\ndiscontinuities (coherent structures) are seen in the large scale magnetic\nfield, while at small scales several intermittent bursts of wave activity\n(whistler waves) are present. Several different morphologies of the power\nspectrum can be identified: (1) two power laws separated by a break (2) an\nexponential cutoff near the Taylor shifted electron scales and (3) strong\nspectral knees at the Taylor shifted electron scales. These different\nmorphologies are investigated by using wavelet coherence, showing that in this\ninterval a clear break and strong spectral knees are features which are\nassociated with sporadic quasi parallel propagating whistler waves, even for\nshort times. On the other hand, when no signatures of whistler waves at 0.1 -\n0.2fce are present, a clear break is difficult to find and the spectrum is\noften more characteristic of a power law with an exponential cutoff.\n", "  To obtain the best possible scientific result, astronomers must understand\nthe properties of the available instrumentation well. This is important both\nwhen designing new instruments and when using existing instruments close to the\nlimits of their specified capabilities or beyond. Ray-tracing is a technique\nfor numerical simulations where the path of many light rays is followed through\nthe system to understand how individual system components influence the\nobserved properties, such as the shape of the point-spread-function (PSF). In\ninstrument design, such simulations can be used to optimize the performance.\nFor observations with existing instruments this helps to discern instrumental\nartifacts from a true signal. Here, we describe MARXS, a new python package\ndesigned to simulate X-ray instruments on satellites and sounding rockets.\nMARXS uses probability tracking of photons and has polarimetric capabilities.\n", "  A modified version of the folded aplanatic Gregory telescope equipped with a\nspherical two-lens corrector is proposed for observations requiring a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The basic telescope model has an aperture of 400 mm\n(f/3.0), its field of view is 3.0 degrees, the linear obscuration is 0.12, the\ndistortion is less than 0.5%. The focal surface has a spherical shape; the\nachieving of a plane field requires an increase in the number of lenses in the\ncorrector. The images of stars in the integrated wavelength range 0.35 - 1.0\nmcm are close to the diffraction-limited ones (D_{80} = 5.9 - 8.2 mcm = 1.0 -\n1.4 arc seconds). The system is free from direct background illumination; both\nthe lens corrector and the light detector are protected from cosmic particles.\n", "  We study the homogeneous nearest-neighbor Ising ferromagnet on the right half\nplane with a Dobrushin type boundary condition --- say plus on the top part of\nthe boundary and minus on the bottom. For sufficiently low temperature $T$, we\ncompletely characterize the pure (i.e., extremal) Gibbs states, as follows.\nThere is exactly one for each angle $\\theta\\in\\lbrack-\\pi/2,+\\pi/2]$; here\n$\\theta$ specifies the asymptotic angle of the interface separating regions\nwhere the spin configuration looks like that of the plus (respectively, minus)\nfull-plane state. Some of these conclusions are extended all the way to\n$T=T_{c}$ by developing new Ising exact solution result -- in particular, there\nis at least one pure state for each $\\theta$.\n", "  The energy and charge fluxes carried by electrons in a two-terminal junction\nsubjected to a random telegraph noise, produced by a single electronic defect,\nare analyzed. The telegraph processes are imitated by the action of a\nstochastic electric field that acts on the electrons in the junction. Upon\naveraging over all random events of the telegraph process, it is found that\nthis electric field supplies, on the average, energy to the electronic\nreservoirs, which is distributed unequally between them: the stronger is the\ncoupling of the reservoir with the junction, the more energy it gains. Thus the\nnoisy environment can lead to a temperature gradient across an un-biased\njunction.\n", "  Using a sample of $1.31 \\times 10^{9}$ $J/\\psi$ events collected with the\nBESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we study the decays of $J/\\psi\n\\rightarrow K_S K_L$ and $K_S K_S$. The branching fraction of$J/\\psi\\rightarrow\nK_S K_L$ is determined to be ${\\cal B}(J/\\psi \\rightarrow K_S\nK_L)=(1.93\\pm0.01~(\\rm{stat.})\\pm0.05~(\\rm{syst.}))\\times10^{-4}$, which\nsignificantly improves on previous measurements. No clear signal is observed\nfor the $J/\\psi \\rightarrow K_S K_S$ process, and the upper limit at the 95%\nconfidence level for its branching fraction is determined to be ${\\cal\nB}(J/\\psi \\rightarrow K_S K_S)<1.4\\times10^{-8}$, which improves on the\nprevious searches by two orders in magnitude and reaches the order of the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen expectation.\n", "  AH Cep and CW Cep are both early B-type binaries with short orbital periods\nof 1.8~d and 2.7~d, respectively. All four components are B0.5V types. The\nbinaries are also double-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing. Consequently,\nsolutions for orbital and stellar parameters make the pair of binaries ideal\ntargets for a study of the colliding winds between two B~stars. {\\em Chandra}\nACIS-I observations were obtained to determine X-ray luminosities. AH~Cep was\ndetected with an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity at a 90\\% confidence interval of\n$(9-33)\\times 10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$, or $(0.5-1.7)\\times 10^{-7} L_{\\rm Bol}$,\nrelative to the combined Bolometric luminosities of the two components. While\nformally consistent with expectations for embedded wind shocks, or binary wind\ncollision, the near-twin system of CW~Cep was a surprising non-detection. For\nCW~Cep, an upper limit was determined with $L_X/L_{\\rm Bol} < 10^{-8}$, again\nfor the combined components. One difference between these two systems is that\nAH~Cep is part of a multiple system. The X-rays from AH~Cep may not arise from\nstandard wind shocks nor wind collision, but perhaps instead from magnetism in\nany one of the four components of the system. The possibility could be tested\nby searching for cyclic X-ray variability in AH~Cep on the short orbital period\nof the inner B~stars.\n", "  Binary neutron-star mergers (BNSMs) are among the most readily detectable\ngravitational-wave (GW) sources with LIGO. They are also thought to produce\nshort $\\gamma$-ray bursts (SGRBs), and kilonovae that are powered by r-process\nnuclei. Detecting these phenomena simultaneously would provide an unprecedented\nview of the physics during and after the merger of two compact objects. Such a\nRosetta Stone event was detected by LIGO/Virgo on 17 August 2017 at a distance\nof $\\sim 44$ Mpc. We monitored the position of the BNSM with ALMA at 338.5 GHz\nand GMRT at 1.4 GHz, from 1.4 to 44 days after the merger. Our observations\nrule out any afterglow more luminous than $3\\times 10^{26}~{\\rm\nerg\\,s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm Hz}^{-1}$ in these bands, probing $>$2--4 dex fainter than\nprevious SGRB limits. We match these limits, in conjunction with public data\nannouncing the appearance of X-ray and radio emission in the weeks after the GW\nevent, to templates of off-axis afterglows. Our broadband modeling suggests\nthat GW170817 was accompanied by a SGRB and that the GRB jet, powered by\n$E_{\\rm AG,\\,iso}\\sim10^{50}$~erg, had a half-opening angle of $\\sim20^\\circ$,\nand was misaligned by $\\sim41^\\circ$ from our line of sight. The data are also\nconsistent with a more collimated jet: $E_{\\rm AG,\\,iso}\\sim10^{51}$~erg,\n$\\theta_{1/2,\\,\\rm jet}\\sim5^\\circ$, $\\theta_{\\rm obs}\\sim17^\\circ$. This is\nthe most conclusive detection of an off-axis GRB afterglow and the first\nassociated with a BNSM-GW event to date. Assuming a uniform top-hat jet, we use\nthe viewing angle estimates to infer the initial bulk Lorentz factor and true\nenergy release of the burst.\n", "  The coincident detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) event GW170817 with\nelectromagnetic (EM) signals (e.g., a short gamma-ray burst SGRB 170817A or a\nmacronova) from a binary neutron star merger within the nearby galaxy NGC 4933\nprovides a new, multimessenger test of the weak equivalence principle (WEP),\nextending the WEP test with GWs and photons. Assuming that the arrival time\ndelay between the GW signals from GW170817 and the photons from SGRB 170817A or\nthe macronova is mainly attributed to the gravitational potential of the Milky\nWay, we demonstrate that the strict upper limits on the deviation from the WEP\nare $\\Delta \\gamma<1.4\\times10^{-3}$ for GW170817/macronova and $\\Delta \\gamma\n<5.9\\times10^{-8}$ for GW170817/SGRB 170817A. A much more severe constraint on\nthe WEP accuracy can be achieved ($\\sim0.9\\times10^{-10}$) for GW170817/SGRB\n170817A when we consider the gravitational potential of the Virgo Cluster,\nrather than the Milky Way's gravity. This provides the tightest limit to date\non the WEP through the relative differential variations of the $\\gamma$\nparameter for two different species of particles. Compared with other\nmultimessenger (photons and neutrinos) results, our limit is 7 orders of\nmagnitude tighter than that placed by the neutrinos and photons from supernova\n1987A, and is almost as good as or is an improvement of 6 orders of magnitude\nover the limits obtained by the low-significance neutrinos correlated with GRBs\nand a blazar flare.\n", "  We present a high-precision chemical analysis of iota Horologii, a\nplanet-host field star thought to have formed in the Hyades. Elements with\natomic number 6<=Z<=30 have abundances that are in excellent agreement with\nthose of the cluster within the +/-0.01 dex (or ~2%) precision errors. Heavier\nelements show a range of abundances such that about half of the Z>30 species\nanalyzed are consistent with those of the Hyades, while the other half are\nmarginally enhanced by 0.03+/-0.01 dex (~7+/-2%). The lithium abundance, A(Li),\nis very low compared to the well-defined A(Li)-Teff relation of the cluster.\nFor its Teff, iota Horologii's lithium content is about half the Hyades'.\nAttributing the enhanced lithium depletion to the planet would require a\npeculiar rotation rate, which we are unable to confirm. Our analysis of the\nstar's chromospheric activity suggests Prot=5d, which is significantly shorter\nthan previously reported. Models of Galactic orbits place iota Horologii\nhundreds of parsecs away from the Hyades cluster at formation. Thus, we find\nthe claim of a shared birthplace very difficult to justify.\n", "  We combine electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) information on\nthe binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 in order to constrain the radii\n$R_{\\rm ns}$ and maximum mass $M_{\\rm max}$ of NSs. GW170817 was followed by a\nrange of EM counterparts, including a weak gamma-ray burst (GRB), kilonova (KN)\nemission from the radioactive decay of the merger ejecta, and X-ray/radio\nemission consistent with being the synchrotron afterglow of a more powerful\noff-axis jet. The type of compact remnant produced in the immediate merger\naftermath, and its predicted EM signal, depend sensitively on the high-density\nNS equation of state (EOS). For a soft EOS which supports a low $M_{\\rm max}$,\nthe merger undergoes a prompt collapse accompanied by a small quantity of\nshock-heated or disk wind ejecta, inconsistent with the large quantity $\\gtrsim\n10^{-2}M_{\\odot}$ of lanthanide-free ejecta inferred from the KN. On the other\nhand, if $M_{\\rm max}$ is sufficiently large, then the merger product is a\nrapidly-rotating supramassive NS (SMNS), which must spin-down before collapsing\ninto a black hole. A fraction of the enormous rotational energy necessarily\nreleased by the SMNS during this process is transferred to the ejecta, either\ninto the GRB jet (energy $E_{\\rm GRB}$) or the KN ejecta (energy $E_{\\rm ej}$),\nalso inconsistent with observations. By combining the total binary mass of\nGW170817 inferred from the GW signal with conservative upper limits on $E_{\\rm\nGRB}$ and $E_{\\rm ej}$ from EM observations, we constrain the likelihood\nprobability of a wide-range of previously-allowed EOS. These two constraints\ndelineate an allowed region of the $M_{\\rm max}-R_{\\rm ns}$ parameter space,\nwhich once marginalized over NS radius places an upper limit of $M_{\\rm max}\n\\lesssim 2.17M_{\\odot}$ (90\\%), which is tighter or arguably less\nmodel-dependent than other current constraints.\n", "  We consider a PT-symmetric ladder-shaped optical array consisting of a chain\nof waveguides with gain coupled to a parallel chain of waveguides with loss.\nAll waveguides have the focusing Kerr nonlinearity. The array supports two\nco-existing solitons, an in-phase and an antiphase one, and each of these can\nbe centred either on a lattice site or midway between two neighbouring sites.\nWe show that both bond-centred (i.e. intersite) solitons are unstable\nregardless of their amplitudes and parameters of the chain. The site-centred\nin-phase soliton is stable when its amplitude lies below a threshold that\ndepends on the coupling and gain-loss coefficient. The threshold is lowest when\nthe gain-to-gain and loss-to-loss coupling constant in each chain is close to\nthe interchain gain-to-loss coupling coefficient. The antiphase soliton in the\nstrongly-coupled chain or in a chain close to the PT-symmetry breaking point,\nis stable when its amplitude lies above a critical value and unstable\notherwise. The instability growth rate of solitons with small amplitude is\nexponentially small in this parameter regime; hence the small-amplitude\nsolitons, though unstable, have exponentially long lifetimes. On the other\nhand, the antiphase soliton in the weakly or moderately coupled chain and away\nfrom the PT-symmetry breaking point, is unstable when its amplitude falls in\none or two finite bands. All amplitudes outside those bands are stable.\n", "  We make a theoretical prediction for the ratio of the dark energy to other\ncomponents in the Universe based on the scenario of the sequestering mechanism\nwhich was recently proposed as one possible way to solve the cosmological\nconstant problem. In order to evaluate the value of dark energy and the others,\nwe assume a specific scale factor which describes the Big-Crunch scenario in\nthe scalar-tensor theory. We specify the parameter region where the one can\nexplain the observed dark energy-matter ratio.\n", "  We have studied the variability of the black-widow type binary millisecond\npulsar PSR J1311$-$3430 from optical to gamma-ray energies. We confirm evidence\nfor orbital modulation in the weak off-pulse $\\ge$200-MeV emission, with a peak\nat $\\phi_B\\approx 0.8$, following pulsar inferior conjunction. The peak has a\nrelatively hard spectrum, extending above $\\sim 1$\\,GeV. XMM-Newton and Swift\nUV observations also show that this source's strong X-ray flaring activity is\nassociated with optical/UV flares. With a duty cycle $\\sim 7-19$%, this flaring\nis quite prominent with an apparent power-law intensity distribution. Flares\nare present at all orbital phases, with a slight preference for\n$\\phi_B=0.5-0.7$. We explore possible connections of these variabilities with\nthe intrabinary shock and magnetic activity on the low mass secondary.\n", "  Rotating and twisting locally rotationally symmetric imperfect fluids in\ngeneral relativity admit a much larger set of solutions than the self-similar\nones recently suggested in the literature. Explicit forms of the metrics are\ngiven and the self-similar sub-cases are discussed.\n", "  We report the spin to charge current conversation in an intrinsic topological\ninsulator (TI) $(Bi_{0.22}Sb_{0.78})_2Te_3$ film at room temperature. The spin\ncurrents are generated in a thin layer of permalloy (Py) by two different\nprocesses, spin pumping (SPE) and spin Seebeck effects (SSE). In the first we\nuse microwave-driven ferromagnetic resonance of the Py film to generate a SPE\nspin current that is injected into the TI $(Bi_{0.22}Sb_{0.78})_2Te_3$ layer in\ndirect contact with Py. In the second we use the SSE in the longitudinal\nconfiguration in Py without contamination by the Nernst effect made possible\nwith a thin NiO layer between the Py and $(Bi_{0.22}Sb_{0.78})_2Te_3$ layers.\nThe spin-to-charge current conversion is attributed to the inverse Edelstein\neffect (IEE) made possible by the spin-momentum locking in the electron Fermi\ncontours due to the Rashba field. The measurements by the two techniques yield\nvery similar values for the IEE parameter, which are larger than the reported\nvalues in the previous studies on topological insulators.\n", "  The first, long awaited, detection of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from\nthe merger of a binary neutron-star (NS-NS) system was finally achieved\n(GW$\\,$170817), and was also accompanied by an electromagnetic counterpart --\nthe short-duration GRB 170817A. It occurred in the nearby ($D\\approx40\\;$Mpc)\nelliptical galaxy NGC$\\,$4993, and showed optical, IR and UV emission from half\na day up to weeks after the event, as well as late time X-ray (at $\\geq\n8.9\\;$days) and radio (at $\\geq 16.4\\;$days) emission. There was a delay of\n$\\Delta t \\approx 1.74\\;$s between the GW merger chirp signal and the\nprompt-GRB emission onset, and an upper limit of $\\theta_{\\rm obs}<28^\\circ$\nwas set on the viewing angle w.r.t the jet's symmetry axis from the GW signal.\nIn this letter we examine some of the implications of these groundbreaking\nobservations. The delay $\\Delta t$ sets an upper limit on the prompt-GRB\nemission radius, $R_\\gamma\\lesssim 2c\\Delta t/(\\theta_{\\rm obs}-\\theta_0)^2$,\nfor a jet with sharp edges at an angle $\\theta_0<\\theta_{\\rm obs}$. GRB\n170817A's relatively low isotropic equivalent $\\gamma$-ray energy-output may\nsuggest a viewing angle slightly outside the jet's sharp edge,\n$\\theta_{\\rm{}obs}-\\theta_0\\sim(0.05-0.1)(\\Gamma/100)^{-1}$, but its peak\n$\\nu{}F_\\nu$ photon energy and afterglow emission suggest instead that the jet\ndoes not have sharp edges and the prompt emission was dominated by less\nenergetic material along our line of sight, at $\\theta_{\\rm{}obs}\\gtrsim\n2\\theta_0$. Finally, we consider the type of remnant that is produced by the\nNS-NS merger and find that a relatively long-lived ($>2\\;$s) massive NS is\nstrongly disfavored, while a hyper-massive NS of lifetime $\\sim1\\;$s appears to\nbe somewhat favored over the direct formation of a black hole.\n", "  We report on a Hubble Space Telescope detection of the nearby, old pulsar\nB0950+08 ($d\\simeq 262$ pc, spin-down age 17.5 Myr) in two far-ultraviolet\n(FUV) bands. We measured the mean flux densities $\\bar{f}_\\nu = 109\\pm 6$ nJy\nand $83\\pm 14$ nJy in the F125LP and F140LP filters (pivot wavelengths 1438 and\n1528 \\AA). Using the FUV data together with previously obtained optical-UV\ndata, we conclude that the optical-FUV spectrum consists of two components -- a\nnonthermal (presumably magnetospheric) power-law spectrum ($f_\\nu\\propto\n\\nu^\\alpha$) with slope $\\alpha\\sim -1.2$ and a thermal spectrum emitted from\nthe bulk of the neutron star surface with a temperature in the range of\n$(1-3)\\times 10^5$ K, depending on interstellar extinction and neutron star\nradius. These temperatures are much higher than predicted by neutron star\ncooling models for such an old pulsar, which means that some heating mechanisms\noperate in neutron stars. A plausible mechanism responsible for the high\ntemperature of PSR B0950+08 is the interaction of vortex lines of the faster\nrotating neutron superfluid with the slower rotating normal matter in the inner\nneutron star crust (vortex creep heating).\n", "  The Survey of Water and Ammonia in the Galactic Center (SWAG) covers the\nCentral Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way at frequencies between 21.2 and\n25.4 GHz obtained at the Australia Telescope Compact Array at $\\sim 0.9$ pc\nspatial and $\\sim 2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ spectral resolution. In this paper, we\npresent data on the inner $\\sim 250$ pc ($1.4^\\circ$) between Sgr C and Sgr B2.\nWe focus on the hyperfine structure of the metastable ammonia inversion lines\n(J,K) = (1,1) - (6,6) to derive column density, kinematics, opacity and kinetic\ngas temperature. In the CMZ molecular clouds, we find typical line widths of\n$8-16$ km s$^{-1}$ and extended regions of optically thick ($\\tau > 1$)\nemission. Two components in kinetic temperature are detected at $25-50$ K and\n$60-100$ K, both being significantly hotter than dust temperatures throughout\nthe CMZ. We discuss the physical state of the CMZ gas as traced by ammonia in\nthe context of the orbital model by Kruijssen et al. (2015) that interprets the\nobserved distribution as a stream of molecular clouds following an open\neccentric orbit. This allows us to statistically investigate the time\ndependencies of gas temperature, column density and line width. We find heating\nrates between $\\sim 50$ and $\\sim 100$ K Myr$^{-1}$ along the stream orbit. No\nstrong signs of time dependence are found for column density or line width.\nThese quantities are likely dominated by cloud-to-cloud variations. Our results\nqualitatively match the predictions of the current model of tidal triggering of\ncloud collapse, orbital kinematics and the observation of an evolutionary\nsequence of increasing star formation activity with orbital phase.\n", "  We examine the Hamiltonian dynamics of bouncing Bianchi IX cosmologies in\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. The $6$-dim phase space presents two critical\npoints, one asymptotic de Sitter attractor at infinity and a $2$-dim invariant\nplane. We identified four distinct parameter domains $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ for\nwhich the pair of critical points engenders distinct features in the dynamics.\nIn the domain $A$ the dynamics consists basically of periodic bouncing orbits,\nor oscillatory orbits with a finite number of bounces. The center with\nmultiplicity two engenders in its neighborhood the topology of stable and\nunstable cylinders $R \\times S^3$ of orbits. We show that the stable and\nunstable cylinders coalesce realizing a smooth homoclinic connection to the\ncenter manifold, a rare event of regular/non-chaotic dynamics in bouncing\nBianchi IX cosmologies. The presence of a saddle of multiplicity two in the\ndomain $B$ engenders a high instability in the dynamics so that the cylinders\nemerging from the center manifold towards the bounce have four distinct\nattractors: the center manifold itself, the de Sitter attractor at infinity and\ntwo further momentum-dominated attractors with infinite anisotropy. In the\ndomain $C$ we examine the features of invariant manifolds of orbits about a\nsaddle of multiplicity two. The presence of the saddle of multiplicity two\nengenders bifurcations of the invariant manifold as the energy $E_0$ of the\nsystem increases relative to the energy $E_{cr}$ providing structures that were\nnot yet observed in the literature. The domain $D$ is not examined as most of\nits features are present already in the previous domains.\n", "  Microswimmers, and among them aspirant microrobots, generally have to cope\nwith flows where viscous forces are dominant, characterized by a low Reynolds\nnumber ($Re$). This implies constraints on the possible sequences of body\nmotion, which have to be nonreciprocal. Furthermore, the presence of a strong\ndrag limits the range of resulting velocities. Here, we propose a swimming\nmechanism, which uses the buckling instability triggered by pressure waves to\npropel a spherical, hollow shell. With a macroscopic experimental model, we\nshow that a net displacement is produced at all $Re$ regimes. An optimal\ndisplacement caused by non-trivial history effects is reached at intermediate\n$Re$. We show that, due to the fast activation induced by the instability, this\nregime is reachable by microscopic shells. The rapid dynamics would also allow\nhigh frequency excitation with standard traveling ultrasonic waves. Scale\nconsiderations predict a swimming velocity of order 1 cm/s for a\nremote-controlled microrobot, a suitable value for biological applications such\nas drug delivery.\n", "  Earlier estimates have argued that the baryon number violating scattering\ncross-section in the laboratory is exponentially small so it will never be\nobserved, even for incoming 2-particle energy well above the sphaleron energy\nof 9 TeV. However, we argue in arXiv:1505.03690 that, due to the periodic\nnature of the sphaleron potential, the event rate for energies above the\nsphaleron energy may be high enough to be observed in the near future. That is,\nthere is a discrepancy of about 70 orders of magnitude between the two\nestimates. Here we argue why and how the multi-sphaleron processes are crucial\nto the event rate estimate, a very important \"resonant tunneling\" property that\nhas not been taken into account before. We also summarize the input assumptions\nand reasoning adopted in our estimate, when compared to the earlier estimates.\n", "  X-ray emitting gaseous coronae around massive galaxies are a basic prediction\nof galaxy formation models. Although the coronae around spiral galaxies offer a\nfundamental test of these models, observational constraints on their\ncharacteristics are still scarce. While the presence of extended hot coronae\nhas been established around a handful of massive spiral galaxies, the short\nX-ray observations only allowed for measurements of the basic characteristics\nof the coronae. In this work, we utilize deep XMM-Newton observations of NGC\n6753 to explore its extended X-ray corona in unprecedented detail.\nSpecifically, we establish the isotropic morphology of the hot gas, suggesting\nthat it resides in hydrostatic equilibrium. The temperature profile of the gas\nshows a decrease with increasing radius: it drops from $kT\\approx0.7$ keV in\nthe innermost parts to $kT\\approx0.4$ keV at 50 kpc radius. The temperature map\nreveals the complex temperature structure of the gas. We study the metallicity\ndistribution of the gas, which is uniform at $Z\\approx0.1$ Solar. This value is\nabout an order of magnitude lower than that obtained for elliptical galaxies\nwith similar dark matter halo mass, hinting that the hot gas in spiral galaxies\npredominantly originates from external gas inflows rather than from internal\nsources. By extrapolating the density profile of the hot gas out to the virial\nradius, we estimate the total gas mass and derive the total baryon mass of NGC\n6753. We conclude that the baryon mass fraction is $f_{\\rm b} \\approx 0.06$,\nimplying that about half of the baryons are missing.\n", "  Few observational constraints exist for the tidal synchronization rate of\nlate-type stars, despite its fundamental role in binary evolution. We visually\ninspected the light curves of 2278 eclipsing binaries (EBs) from the Kepler\nEclipsing Binary Catalog to identify those with starspot modulations, as well\nas other types of out-of-eclipse variability. We report rotation periods for\n816 EBs with starspot modulations, and find that 79% of EBs with orbital\nperiods less than ten days are synchronized. However, a population of short\nperiod EBs exists with rotation periods typically 13% slower than synchronous,\nwhich we attribute to the differential rotation of high latitude starspots. At\n10 days, there is a transition from predominantly circular, synchronized EBs to\npredominantly eccentric, pseudosynchronized EBs. This transition period is in\ngood agreement with the predicted and observed circularization period for Milky\nWay field binaries. At orbital periods greater than about 30 days, the amount\nof tidal synchronization decreases. We also report 12 previously unidentified\ncandidate $\\delta$ Scuti and $\\gamma$ Doradus pulsators, as well as a candidate\nRS CVn system with an evolved primary that exhibits starspot occultations. For\nshort period contact binaries, we observe a period-color relation, and compare\nit to previous studies. As a whole, these results represent the largest\nhomogeneous study of tidal synchronization of late-type stars.\n", "  We report on the critical current density Jc and the vortex dynamics of\npristine and 3 MeV proton irradiated (cumulative dose equal to 2x10^16 cm^-2)\n$\\beta$-FeSe single crystals. We also analyze a remarkable dependence of the\nsuperconducting critical temperature Tc, Jc and the flux creep rate S on the\nsample mounting method. Free-standing crystals present Tc =8.4(1)K, which\nincreases to 10.5(1)K when they are fixed to the sample holder by embedding\nthem with GE-7031 varnish. On the other hand, the irradiation has a marginal\neffect on Tc. The pinning scenario can be ascribed to twin boundaries and\nrandom point defects. We find that the main effect of irradiation is to\nincrease the density of random point defects, while the embedding mainly\nreduces the density of twin boundaries. Pristine and irradiated crystals\npresent two outstanding features in the temperature dependence of the flux\ncreep rate: S(T) presents large values at low temperatures, which can be\nattributed to small pinning energies, and a plateau at intermediate\ntemperatures, which can be associated with glassy relaxation. From Maley\nanalysis, we observe that the characteristic glassy exponent {\\mu} changes from\n~ 1.7 to 1.35-1.4 after proton irradiation.\n", "  The analysis of perturbative quantities is a powerful tool to distinguish\nbetween different Dark Energy models and gravity theories degenerated at the\nbackground level. In this work, we generalise the integral solution of the\nmatter density contrast for General Relativity gravity to a wide class of\nModified Gravity (MG) theories. To calculate this solution is necessary prior\nknowledge of the Hubble rate, the density parameter at the present epoch\n($\\Omega_{m0}$) and the functional form of the effective Newton's constant that\ncharacterises the gravity theory. We estimate in a model-independent way the\nHubble expansion rate by applying a non-parametric reconstruction method to\nmodel-independent cosmic chronometer data and high-$z$ quasar data. In order to\ncompare our generalised solution of the matter density contrast, using the\nnon-parametric reconstruction of $H(z)$ from observational data, with purely\ntheoretical one, we choose a parameterisation of the Screened MG and the\n$\\Omega_{m0}$ from WMAP-9 collaborations. Finally, we calculate the growth\nindex for the analysed cases, finding very good agreement between theoretical\nvalues and the obtained ones using the approach presented in this work.\n", "  Molecular Dynamics - Green's Functions Reaction Dynamics (MD-GFRD) is a\nmultiscale simulation method for particle dynamics or particle-based\nreaction-diffusion dynamics that is suited for systems involving low particle\ndensities. Particles in a low-density region are just diffusing and not\ninteracting. In this case one can avoid the costly integration of microscopic\nequations of motion, such as molecular dynamics (MD), and instead turn to an\nevent-based scheme in which the times to the next particle interaction and the\nnew particle positions at that time can be sampled. At high (local)\nconcentrations, however, e.g. when particles are interacting in a nontrivial\nway, particle positions must still be updated with small time steps of the\nmicroscopic dynamical equations. The efficiency of a multi-scale simulation\nthat uses these two schemes largely depends on the coupling between them and\nthe decisions when to switch between the two scales. Here we present an\nefficient scheme for multi-scale MD-GFRD simulations. It has been shown that\nMD-GFRD schemes are more efficient than brute-force molecular dynamics\nsimulations up to a molar concentration of $10^{2}\\mu M$. In this paper, we\nshow that the choice of the propagation domains has a relevant impact on the\ncomputational performance. Domains are constructed using a local optimization\nof their sizes and a minimal domain size is proposed. The algorithm is shown to\nbe more efficient than brute-force Brownian dynamics simulations up to a molar\nconcentration of $10^{3}\\mu M$ and is up to an order of magnitude more\nefficient compared with previous MD-GFRD schemes.\n", "  We show that the mass of a dark matter halo can be inferred from the\ndynamical status of its satellite galaxies. Using 9 dark-matter simulations of\nhalos like the Milky Way (MW), we find that the present-day substructures in\neach halo follow a characteristic distribution in the phase space of orbital\nbinding energy and angular momentum, and that this distribution is similar from\nhalo to halo but has an intrinsic dependence on the halo formation history. We\nconstruct this distribution directly from the simulations for a specific halo\nand extend the result to halos of similar formation history but different\nmasses by scaling. The mass of an observed halo can then be estimated by\nmaximizing the likelihood in comparing the measured kinematic parameters of its\nsatellite galaxies with these distributions. We test the validity and accuracy\nof this method with mock samples taken from the simulations. Using the\npositions, radial velocities, and proper motions of 9 tracers and assuming\nobservational uncertainties comparable to those of MW satellite galaxies, we\nfind that the halo mass can be recovered to within $\\sim$40%. The accuracy can\nbe improved to within $\\sim$25% if 30 tracers are used. However, the dependence\nof the phase-space distribution on the halo formation history sets a minimum\nuncertainty of $\\sim$20% that cannot be reduced by using more tracers. We\nbelieve that this minimum uncertainty also applies to any mass determination\nfor a halo when the phase space information of other kinematic tracers is used.\n", "  The phonon-assisted sticking rate of slow moving atoms impinging on an\nelastic membrane at nonzero temperature is studied analytically using a model\nwith linear atom-phonon interactions, valid in the weak coupling regime. A\nperturbative expansion of the adsorption rate in the atom-phonon coupling is\ninfrared divergent at zero temperature, and this infrared problem is\nexacerbated by finite temperature. The use of a coherent state phonon basis in\nthe calculation, however, yields infrared-finite results even at finite\ntemperature. The sticking probability with the emission of any finite number of\nphonons is explicitly seen to be exponentially small, and it vanishes as the\nmembrane size grows, a result that was previously found at zero temperature; in\ncontrast to the zero temperature case, this exponential suppression of the\nsticking probability persists even with the emission of an infinite number of\nsoft phonons. Explicit closed-form expressions are obtained for the effects of\nsoft-phonon emission at finite temperature on the adsorption rate. For slowly\nmoving atoms, the model predicts that there is zero probability of sticking to\na large elastic membrane at nonzero temperature and weak coupling.\n", "  Predictions of the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states are critical\nfor nuclear structure studies, but are problematic for nuclei with an odd\nnucleon due to the interplay of the unpaired single particle with nuclear\ncollective degrees of freedom. In this work, a microscopic core-quasiparticle\ncoupling (CQC) model based on the covariant density functional theory is\ndeveloped that contains the collective excitations of even-mass cores and\nspherical single-particle states of the odd nucleon as calculated from a\nquadrupole collective Hamiltonian combined with a constrained triaxial\nrelativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model. Predictions of the new model for\nexcitation energies, kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia, and transition\nrates are shown to be in good agreement with results of low-lying spectroscopy\nmeasurements of the axially deformed odd-proton nucleus $^{159}$Tb and the\nodd-neutron nucleus $^{157}$Gd. Future studies with additional nuclei are\nplanned.\n", "  The life-cycle of cosmic dust grains is far from being understood and the\norigin and evolution of interstellar medium (ISM) grains is still under debate.\nIn the ISM, the cosmic dust destruction rate is faster than the production rate\nby stellar sources. However, observations of ISM refractory matter suggest that\nto maintain a steady amount of cosmic grains, some supplementary production\nmechanism takes place. In this context, we aimed to study possible re-formation\nmechanisms of cosmic grains taking place at low temperature directly in the\nISM. The low temperature condensation of carbonaceous materials has been\ninvestigated in experiments mimicking the ISM conditions. Gas-phase\ncarbonaceous precursors created by laser ablation of graphite were forced to\naccrete on cold substrates (T about 10 K) representing surviving dust grains.\nThe growing and evolution of the condensing carbonaceous precursors have been\nmonitored by MIR and UV spectroscopy under a number of experimental scenarios.\nIt is demonstrated, for the first time, the possibility to form ISM\ncarbonaceous grains in \"situ\". The condensation process is governed by carbon\nchains that first condense into small carbon clusters and finally into more\nstable carbonaceous materials, which structural characteristics are comparable\nto the material formed in gas-phase condensation experiments at very high\ntemperature. We also show that the so-formed fullerene-like carbonaceous\nmaterial is transformed into a more ordered material under VUV processing. The\ncold condensation mechanisms here discussed can give fundamental clues to fully\nunderstand the balance between the timescale for dust injection, destruction\nand re-formation in the ISM.\n", "  Perovskite oxide interfaces have attracted tremendous research interest for\ntheir fundamental physics and promising all-oxide electronics applications.\nHere, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a novel surface La\ninterstitial promoted interface insulator-metal transition in LaAlO3/SrTiO3\n(110). Compared with surface oxygen vacancies, which play a determining role on\nthe insulator-metal transition of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (001) interfaces, we find that\nsurface La interstitials can be more experimentally realistic and accessible\nfor manipulation and more stable in ambient atmospheric environment.\nInterestingly, these surface La interstitials also induce significant\nspin-splitting states with Ti dyz/dxz character at conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3\n(110) interface. On the other hand, for insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (110) (<4 unit\ncells LaAlO3 thickness), a distortion between La (Al) and O atoms is found at\nthe LaAlO3 side, partially compensating the polarization divergence. Our\nresults reveal the origin of metal-insulator transition in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (110)\nheterostructures, and also shed light on the manipulation of the superior\nproperties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (110) for new possibilities of electronic and\nmagnetic applications.\n", "  We investigate the effect of adsorption-desorption phenomenon of ions in an\nasymmetric electrolytic cell at open circuit conditions. Our approach is based\non the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory for electrolytes and the kinetic model of\nLangmuir for the description of adsorption-desorption phenomena on the\nelectrodes. When the electrodes are immersed into the solution, selective ion\nadsorption takes place. It is shown, that the selective ion adsorption is\nresponsible for generating an electrical potential difference between the\nelectrodes of the cell. The analytical expressions for the potential difference\nand for the charge distribution are calculated. Finally, the time evolution of\nthe system is investigated and the relaxation times of the problem are deduced\nnumerically.\n", "  We find that the standard relative entropy and the Umegaki entropy are\ndesigned for the purpose of inferentially updating probability and density\nmatrices respectively. From the same set of inferentially guided design\ncriteria, both of the previously stated entropies are derived in parallel. This\nformulates a quantum maximum entropy method for the purpose of inferring\ndensity matrices in the absence of complete information in Quantum Mechanics.\n", "  Solitonic boson stars are stable objects made of a complex scalar field with\na compactness that can reach values comparable to that of neutron stars. A\nrecent study of the collision of identical boson stars produced only\nnon-rotating boson stars or black holes, suggesting that rotating boson stars\nmay not form from binary mergers. Here we extend this study to include an\nanalysis of the gravitational waves radiated during the coalescence of such a\nbinary, which is crucial to distinguish these events from other binaries with\nLIGO and Virgo observations. Our studies reveal that the remnant's\ngravitational wave signature is mainly governed by its fundamental frequency as\nit settles down to a non-rotating boson star, emitting significant\ngravitational radiation during this post-merger state. We calculate how the\nwaveforms and their post-merger frequencies depend on the compactness of the\ninitial boson stars and estimate analytically the amount of energy radiated\nafter the merger.\n", "  We present a comprehensive and precise description of the Sagittarius (Sgr)\nstellar stream's 3D geometry as traced by its old stellar population. This\nanalysis draws on the sample of ${\\sim}44,000$ RR Lyrae (RRab) stars from the\nPan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3$\\pi$ survey (Hernitschek et al. 2016,Sesar et al. 2017b),\nwhich is ${\\sim}80\\%$ complete and ${\\sim}90\\%$ pure within 80~kpc, and extends\nto ${\\gtrsim} 120$~kpc with a distance precision of ${\\sim} 3\\%$. A projection\nof RR Lyrae stars within $|\\tilde{B}|_{\\odot}<9^\\circ$ of the Sgr stream's\norbital plane reveals the morphology of both the leading and the trailing arms\nat very high contrast, across much of the sky. In particular, the map traces\nthe stream near-contiguously through the distant apocenters. We fit a simple\nmodel for the mean distance and line-of-sight depth of the Sgr stream as a\nfunction of the orbital plane angle $\\tilde{\\Lambda}_{\\odot}$, along with a\npower-law background-model for the field stars. This modeling results in\nestimates of the mean stream distance precise to ${\\sim}1\\%$ and it resolves\nthe stream's line-of-sight depth. These improved geometric constraints can\nserve as new constraints for dynamical stream models.\n", "  We present rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy of the brightest\nlensed galaxy yet discovered, at redshift z = 2.4. This source reveals a\ncharacteristic, triple-peaked Lyman {\\alpha} profile which has been predicted\nby various theoretical works but to our knowledge has not been unambiguously\nobserved previously. The feature is well fit by a superposition of two\ncomponents: a double-peak profile emerging from substantial radiative transfer,\nand a narrow, central component resulting from directly escaping Lyman {\\alpha}\nphotons; but is poorly fit by either component alone. We demonstrate that the\nfeature is unlikely to contain contamination from nearby sources, and that the\ncentral peak is unaffected by radiative transfer effects apart from very slight\nabsorption. The feature is detected at signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 80 per\npixel at line center, and bears strong resemblance to synthetic profiles\npredicted by numerical models.\n", "  We present an analysis of stellar populations in passive galaxies in seven\nmassive X-ray clusters at z=0.19-0.89. Based on absorption line strengths\nmeasured from our high signal-to-noise spectra, the data support primarily\npassive evolution of the galaxies. We use the scaling relations between\nvelocity dispersions and the absorption line strengths to determine\nrepresentative mean line strengths for the clusters. From the age\ndeterminations based on the line strengths (and stellar population models), we\nfind a formation redshift of z_form=1.96(-0.19,+0.24). Based on line strength\nmeasurements from high signal-to-noise composite spectra of our data, we\nestablish the relations between velocity dispersion, ages, metallicities [M/H]\nand abundance ratios [alpha/Fe] as a function of redshift. The [M/H]-velocity\ndispersion and [alpha/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations are steep and tight.\nThe age-velocity dispersion relation is flat, with zero point changes\nreflecting passive evolution. The scatter in all three parameters are within\n0.08-0.15 dex at fixed velocity dispersions, indicating a large degree of\nsynchronization in the evolution of the galaxies. We find indication of\ncluster-to-cluster differences in metallicities and abundance ratios. However,\nvariations in stellar populations with the cluster environment can only account\nfor a very small fraction of the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations.\nThus, within these very massive clusters the main driver of the properties of\nthe stellar populations in passive galaxies appears to be the galaxy velocity\ndispersion.\n", "  Thermo-osmotic and related thermo-phoretic phenomena can be found in many\nsituations from biology to colloid science, but the underlying molecular\nmechanisms remain largely unexplored. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we\nmeasured the thermo-osmosis coefficient by both mechano-caloric and\nthermo-osmotic routes, for different solid-liquid interfacial energies. The\nsimulations reveal in particular the crucial role of nanoscale interfacial\nhydrodynamics. For non-wetting surfaces , thermo-osmotic transport is largely\namplified by hydrodynamic slip at the interface. For wetting surfaces, the\nposition of the hydrodynamic shear plane plays a key role in determining the\namplitude and sign of the thermo-osmosis coefficient. Finally, we measure a\ngiant thermo-osmotic response of the water-graphene interface, which we relate\nto the very low interfacial friction displayed by this system. These results\nopen new perspectives for the design of efficient functional interfaces for,\ne.g., waste heat harvesting.\n", "  Modeling the interior of exoplanets is essential to go further than the\nconclusions provided by mean density measurements. In addition to the still\nlimited precision on the planets' fundamental parameters, models are limited by\nthe existence of degeneracies on their compositions. Here we present a model of\ninternal structure dedicated to the study of solid planets up to ~10 Earth\nmasses, i.e. Super-Earths. When the measurement is available, the assumption\nthat the bulk Fe/Si ratio of a planet is similar to that of its host star\nallows us to significantly reduce the existing degeneracy and more precisely\nconstrain the planet's composition. Based on our model, we provide an update of\nthe mass-radius relationships used to provide a first estimate of a planet's\ncomposition from density measurements. Our model is also applied to the cases\nof two well-known exoplanets, CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b, using their recently\nupdated parameters. The core mass fractions of CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b are\nfound to lie within the 10-37% and 10-33% ranges, respectively, allowing both\nplanets to be compatible with an Earth-like composition. We also extend the\nrecent study of Proxima Centauri b, and show that its radius may reach 1.94\nEarth radii in the case of a 5 Earth masses planet, as there is a 96.7%\nprobability that the real mass of Proxima Centauri b is below this value.\n", "  Is it possible to recover the position of a source from the steady-state\nfluxes of Brownian particles to small absorbing windows located on the boundary\nof a domain? To address this question, we develop a numerical procedure to\navoid tracking Brownian trajectories in the entire infinite space. Instead, we\ngenerate particles near the absorbing windows, computed from the analytical\nexpression of the exit probability. When the Brownian particles are generated\nby a steady-state gradient at a single point, we compute asymptotically the\nfluxes to small absorbing holes distributed on the boundary of half-space and\non a disk in two dimensions, which agree with stochastic simulations. We also\nderive an expression for the splitting probability between small windows using\nthe matched asymptotic method. Finally, when there are more than two small\nabsorbing windows, we show how to reconstruct the position of the source from\nthe diffusion fluxes. The present approach provides a computational first\nprinciple for the mechanism of sensing a gradient of diffusing particles, a\nubiquitous problem in cell biology.\n", "  Evolved stars with a helium core can be formed by non-conservative mass\nexchange interaction with a companion or by strong mass loss. Their masses are\nsmaller than 0.5 MSun. In the database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),\nthere are several thousand stars which were classified by the pipeline as dwarf\nO, B and A stars. Considering the lifetimes of these classes on the main\nsequence, and their distance modulus at the SDSS bright saturation, if these\nwere common main sequence stars, there would be a considerable population of\nyoung stars very far from the galactic disk. Their spectra are dominated by\nBalmer lines which suggest effective temperatures around 8000-10000K. Several\nthousand have significant proper motions, indicative of distances smaller than\n1kpc. Many show surface gravity in intermediate values between main sequence\nand white dwarf, 4.75 < log g < 6.5, hence they have been called sdA stars.\nTheir physical nature and evolutionary history remains a puzzle. We propose\nthey are not H-core main sequence stars, but helium core stars and the outcomes\nof binary evolution. We report the discovery of two new extremely-low mass\nwhite dwarfs among the sdAs to support this statement.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing provides an independent measurement of the\nHubble parameter ($H_0$). One remaining systematic is a bias from the\nadditional mass due to a galaxy group at the lens redshift or along the\nsightline. We quantify this bias for more than 20 strong lenses that have\nwell-sampled sightline mass distributions, focusing on the convergence $\\kappa$\nand shear $\\gamma$. In 23% of these fields, a lens group contributes a $\\ge$1%\nconvergence bias; in 57%, there is a similarly significant line-of-sight group.\nFor the nine time delay lens systems, $H_0$ is overestimated by 11$^{+3}_{-2}$%\non average when groups are ignored. In 67% of fields with total $\\kappa \\ge$\n0.01, line-of-sight groups contribute $\\gtrsim 2\\times$ more convergence than\ndo lens groups, indicating that the lens group is not the only important mass.\nLens environment affects the ratio of four (quad) to two (double) image\nsystems; all seven quads have lens groups while only three of 10 doubles do,\nand the highest convergences due to lens groups are in quads. We calibrate the\n$\\gamma$-$\\kappa$ relation: $\\log(\\kappa_{\\rm{tot}}) = (1.94 \\pm 0.34)\n\\log(\\gamma_{\\rm{tot}}) + (1.31 \\pm 0.49)$ with a rms scatter of 0.34 dex.\nShear, which, unlike convergence, can be measured directly from lensed images,\ncan be a poor predictor of $\\kappa$; for 19% of our fields, $\\kappa$ is\n$\\gtrsim 2\\gamma$. Thus, accurate cosmology using strong gravitational lenses\nrequires precise measurement and correction for all significant structures in\neach lens field.\n", "  In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of exclusive vector meson\nphotoproduction in $pp$, $pPb$ and $PbPb$ collisions at Run 2 LHC energies\nusing the Color Dipole formalism. The rapidity distributions and total cross\nsections for the $\\rho$, $\\phi$, $J/\\Psi$, $\\Psi (2S)$ and $\\Upsilon$\nproduction are estimated considering the more recent phenomenological models\nfor the dipole - proton scattering amplitude, which are based on the Color\nGlass Condensate formalism and are able to describe the inclusive and exclusive\n$ep$ HERA data. Moreover, we also discuss the impact of the modelling of the\nvector meson wave functions on the predictions. The current theoretical\nuncertainty in the Color Dipole predictions is estimated and a comparison with\nthe experimental results is performed.\n", "  We study numerically the dynamics of a network made of two coupled\none-dimensional ensembles of discrete-time systems. The first ensemble is\nrepresented by a ring of nonlocally coupled Henon maps, and the second one - by\na ring of nonlocally coupled Lozi maps. We find that the network of coupled\nensembles can realize all the spatio-temporal structures which are observed\nboth in the Henon map ensemble and in the Lozi map ensemble when uncoupled.\nMoreover, we reveal a new type of spatiotemporal structure, a solitary state\nchimera, in the considered network. We also establish and describe the effect\nof mutual synchronization of various complex spatiotemporal patterns in the\nsystem of two coupled ensembles of Henon and Lozi maps.\n", "  We derive a general integrodifferential equation for the transient behaviour\nof small-amplitude capillary waves on the planar surface of a viscous fluid in\nthe presence of the Marangoni effect. The equation is solved for an insoluble\nsurfactant solution in concentration below the critical micelle concentration\n(cmc) undergoing convective-diffusive surface transport. The special case of a\ndiffusion-driven surfactant is considered near the the critical damping\nwavelength. The Marangoni effect is shown to contribute to the overall damping\nmechanism and a first-order term correction to the critical wavelength with\nrespect to the surfactant concentration difference and the Schmidt number is\nproposed.\n", "  We develop the research achievement of recent work [M. G\\\"arttner, et.al.,\nPhys. Rev. Letts. 113, 233002 (2014)], in which an anomalous excitation\nenhancement is observed in a three-level Rydberg-atom ensemble with many-body\ncoherence. In our novel theoretical analysis, this effect is ascribed to the\nexistence of a quasi-dark state as well as its avoided crossings to nearby\nRydberg-dressed states. Moreover, we show that with an appropriate control of\nthe optical detuning to the intermediate state, the enhancement can evoke a\ndirect facilitation to atom-light coupling that even breaks through the\nconventional $\\sqrt{N}$ limit of strong-blockaded ensembles. As a consequence,\nthe intensity of the probe laser for intermediate transition can be reduced\nconsiderably, increasing the feasibility of experiments with Rydberg-dressed\natoms.\n", "  We present a new algorithm for fitting and classifying polarized radio\nsources, which is based on the QU fitting method introduced by O'Sullivan et\nal. and on our analysis of pulsars. Then we test this algorithm using Monte\nCarlo simulations of observations in the 16 cm band of the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (1.3-3.1 GHz), to quantify how often the algorithm identifies the\ncorrect source model, how certain it is of this identification, and how the\nparameters of the injected and fitted models compare. In our analysis we\nconsider the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria, and model averaging. For\nthe observing setup we simulated, the Bayesian Information Criterion, without\nmodel averaging, is the best way for identifying the correct model and for\nestimating its parameters. Sources can only be identified correctly if their\nparameters lie inside a 'Goldilocks region': strong depolarization makes it\nimpossible to detect sources that emit over a wide range in RM, whereas sources\nthat emit over a narrow range in RM cannot be told apart from simpler sources\nor sources that emit at only one RM. We identify when emission at similar RMs\nis 'resolved', and quantify this in a way similar to the Rayleigh criterion in\noptics. Also, we identify pitfalls in RM synthesis that are avoided by QU\nfitting. Finally, we show how channel weights can be tweaked to produce\napodized RM spectra, that observing time requirements in RM synthesis and QU\nfitting are the same, and we analyse when to stop RMClean.\n", "  Images of the Kuiper belt object (126719) 2002 CC249 obtained in 2016 and\n2017 using the 6.5m Magellan-Baade Telescope and the 4.3m Discovery Channel\nTelescope are presented. A lightcurve with a periodicity of 11.87+/-0.01 h and\na peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.79+/-0.04 mag is reported. This high amplitude\ndouble-peaked lightcurve can be due to a single elongated body, but it is best\nexplained by a contact binary system from its U-/V-shaped lightcurve. We\npresent a simple full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) test that can be used to\ndetermine if an object is likely a contact binary or an elongated object based\non its lightcurve. Considering that 2002 CC249 is in hydrostatic equilibrium, a\nsystem with a mass ratio qmin=0.6, and a density \\rho min=1gcc, or less\nplausible a system with qmax=1, and \\rho max=5gcc can interpret the lightcurve.\nAssuming a single Jacobi ellipsoid in hydrostatic equilibrium, and an\nequatorial view, we estimate \\rho = 0.34gcc, and a/b=2.07. Finally, we report a\nnew color study showing that 2002 CC249 displays an ultra red surface\ncharacteristic of a dynamically Cold Classical trans-Neptunian object.\n", "  As an important problem in acoustics, sound insulation finds applications in\na great variety of situations. In the existing schemes, however, there has\nalways been a tradeoff between the thinness of sound-insulating devices and\ntheir ventilating capabilities, limiting their potentials in the control of\nlow-frequency sound in high ventilation environments. Here we design and\nexperimentally implement an omnidirectional acoustic barrier with planar\nprofile, subwavelength thickness (0.18lambda) yet high ventilation. The\nproposed mechanism is based on the interference between the resonant scattering\nof discrete states and the background scattering of continuous states that\ninduces Fano-like asymmetric transmission profile. Benefitting from the\nbinarystructured design of coiled unit and hollow pipe, it maximally simplifies\nthe design and fabrication while ensuring the ventilation for all the non\nresonant units with open tubes. The simulated and measured results agree well,\nshowing the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism to block low frequency\nsound coming from various directions while allowing 63% of the air flow to\npass. We anticipate our design to open routes to design sound insulators and to\nenable applications in traditionally unattainable cases such as those calling\nfor noise reduction and cooling simultaneously.\n", "  The rearrangements of protons and neutrons amongst the valence\nsingle-particle orbitals during double {\\beta} decay of 100Mo have been\ndetermined by measuring cross sections in (d,p), (p,d), (3He,{\\alpha}) and\n(3He,d) reactions on 98,100Mo and 100,102Ru targets. The deduced nucleon\noccupancies reveal significant discrepancies when compared with theoretical\ncalculations; the same calculations have previously been used to determine the\nnuclear matrix element associated with the decay probability of double {\\beta}\ndecay of the 100Mo system.\n", "  In commonly employed models for 2D topological insulators, bulk gapless\nstates are well known to form at the band inversion points where the degeneracy\nof the states is protected by symmetries. It is thus sometimes quite tempting\nto consider this feature, the occurrence of gapless states, a result of the\nband inversion process under protection of the symmetries. Similarly, the band\ninversion process might even be perceived as necessary to induce 2D topological\nphase transitions. To clarify these misleading perspectives, we propose a\nsimple model with a flexible Chern number to demonstrate that the bulk gapless\nstates emerge at the phase boundary of topological phase transitions, despite\nthe absence of band inversion process. Furthermore, the bulk gapless states do\nnot need to occur at the special $k$-points protected by symmetries. Given the\nsignificance of these fundamental \\textit{conceptual} issues and their\nwide-spread influence, our clarification should generate strong general\ninterests and significant impacts. Furthermore, the simplicity and flexibility\nof our general model with an arbitrary Chern number should prove useful in a\nwide range of future studies of topological states of matter.\n", "  In this paper, we construct a series of additional flows of the CKP hierarchy\nand the multi-component CKP hierarchy and these flows constitute a N-folds\ndirect product of the positive half of the quantum Torus symmetry. Comparing to\nthe $W_{\\infty}$ infinite dimensional Lie symmetry, this quantum Torus symmetry\nhas a nice algebraic structure with double indices.\n", "  For Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed through a non-uniform interstellar\nmedium (ISM) in its host galaxy, we investigate whether the non-uniformity can\ncause observable time variations in dust extinction and in gas absorption due\nto the expansion of the SN photosphere with time. We show that, owing to the\nsteep spectral index of the ISM density power spectrum, sizable density\nfluctuation amplitudes at the length scale of typical ISM structures ($\\gtrsim\n\\text{ 10 pc}$) will translate to much smaller fluctuations on the scales of a\nSN photosphere. Therefore the typical amplitude of time variation due to\nnon-uniform ISM, of absorption equivalent widths and of extinction, would be\nsmall. As a result, we conclude that non-uniform ISM density should not impact\ncosmology measurements based on SNe Ia. We apply our predictions based on the\nISM density power law power spectrum to the observations of two highly reddened\nSNe Ia, SN 2012cu and SN 2014J.\n", "  This paper investigates the use of gravitational time delays of macro-lenses\nto constrain a possible photon mass. The time delay between the 2 compact\nimages of a source of massive photons is computed. Explicit expressions are\ngiven for Schwarzschild and singular isothermal lenses. In the latter case, the\ntime delay is very insensitive to the photon mass. Modeling lens galaxies by a\nsingular isothermal model and a central supermassive black hole, the photon\nmass-dependent part of the time delay between the compact images is shown to be\nproportional to the mass of the black hole. The sensitivity of time delays to\nthe photon mass is illustrated by a bound obtained from 3 AGN which have\nmeasurements in several passbands. The bound obtained is comparable to the\nlimit with the deflection of radio waves by the Sun.\n", "  We consider various possible scenarios to explain the recent observation of a\nclaimed broad H$\\alpha$ absorption in our Galactic halo with peak optical depth\n$\\tau \\simeq 0.01$ and equivalent width $W \\simeq 0.17 \\, \\rm \\AA$. We show\nthat the absorbed feature cannot arise from the circumgalactic and ISM\nH$\\alpha$ absorption. As the observed absorption feature is quite broad\n$\\Delta\\lambda \\simeq 30 \\, \\rm \\AA$, we also consider CNO lines that lie close\nto H$\\alpha$ as possible alternatives to explain the feature. We show such\nlines could also not account for the observed feature. Instead, we suggest that\nit can arise from diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) carriers or polyaromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) absorption. While we identify several such lines close to\nthe H$\\alpha$ transition, we are unable to determine the molecule responsible\nfor the observed feature, partly because of selection effects that prevents us\nfrom identifying DIBs/PAHs features close to H$\\alpha$ using local\nobservations. Deep integration on a few extragalactic sources with high\nspectral resolution might allow us to distinguish between different possible\nexplanations.\n", "  We investigate statistical aspects of the entanglement production for open\nchaotic mesoscopic billiards in contact with superconducting parts, known as\nAndreev billiards. The complete distributions of concurrence and entanglement\nof formation are obtained by using the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes of\ncircular ensembles of scattering matrices, which complements previous studies\nin chaotic universal billiards belonging to other classes of random matrix\ntheory. Our results show a unique and very peculiar behavior: the realization\nof entanglement in a Andreev billiard always results in non-separable state,\nregardless of the time reversal symmetry. The analytical calculations are\nsupported by a numerical Monte Carlo simulation.\n", "  The observations and research on the neutrinos provide a kind of indirect way\nof revealing the properties of dark matter particles. For the detection of muon\nneutrinos, the main issue is the large atmospheric background, which is caused\nby the interactions between the cosmic rays and atoms within the atmosphere.\nCompared with muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos have a smaller atmospheric\nbackground especially for the downward-going direction. Except for the\nclassical neutrino sources, dark matter particles can also annihilate into the\nneutrinos and are the potential high energy astrophysical sources. The\nannihilation rate of dark matter particles is proportional to the square of\nnumber density; therefore, the annihilation rate is large near the center of\ndark matter halos especially for the new kind of dark matter structures named\nultracompact dark matter minihalos (UCMHs). In previous works, we have\ninvestigated the potential muon neutrino flux from UCMHs due to dark matter\nannihilation. Moreover, since the formation of UCMHs is related to the\nprimordial density perturbations of small scales, we get the constraints on the\namplitude of the primordial curvature perturbations of small scales, $1\n\\lesssim k \\lesssim 10^{7} ~\\rm Mpc^{-1}$. In this work, we focus on the\ndownward-going tau neutrinos from UCMHs due to dark matter annihilation.\nCompared with the background of tau neutrino flux we get the constraints on the\nmass fraction of UCMHs. Then using the limits on the mass fraction of UCMHs we\ngot the constraints on the amplitude of the primordial curvature perturbations\nwhich are extended to the scale $k \\sim 10^{8} ~ \\rm Mpc^{-1}$ compared with\nprevious results.\n", "  Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have made UAVs an\nattractive possibility as an airborne calibration platform for astronomical\nfacilities. This is especially true for arrays of telescopes spread over a\nlarge area such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In this paper, the\nfeasibility of using UAVs to calibrate CTA is investigated. Assuming a UAV at 1\nkm altitude above CTA, operating on astronomically clear nights with\nstratified, low atmospheric dust content, appropriate thermal protection for\nthe calibration light source and an onboard photodiode to monitor its absolute\nlight intensity, inter-calibration of CTA's telescopes of the same size class\nis found to be achievable with a 6-8 % uncertainty. For cross-calibration of\ndifferent telescope size classes, a systematic uncertainty of 8-10 % is found\nto be achievable. Importantly, equipping the UAV with a multi-wavelength\ncalibration light source affords us the ability to monitor the\nwavelength-dependent degradation of CTA telescopes' optical system, allowing us\nto not only maintain this 6-10 % uncertainty after the first few years of\ntelescope deployment, but also to accurately account for the effect of\nmulti-wavelength degradation on the cross-calibration of CTA by other\ntechniques, namely with images of air showers and local muons. A UAV-based\nsystem thus provides CTA with several independent and complementary methods of\ncross-calibrating the optical throughput of individual telescopes. Furthermore,\nhousing environmental sensors on the UAV system allows us to not only minimise\nthe systematic uncertainty associated with the atmospheric transmission of the\ncalibration signal, it also allows us to map the dust content above CTA as well\nas monitor the temperature, humidity and pressure profiles of the first\nkilometre of atmosphere above CTA with each UAV flight.\n", "  The metasurface concept has emerged as an advantageous reconfigurable antenna\narchitecture for beam forming and wavefront shaping, with applications that\ninclude satellite and terrestrial communications, radar, imaging, and wireless\npower transfer. The metasurface antenna consists of an array of metamaterial\nelements distributed over an electrically large structure, each subwavelength\nin dimension and with subwavelength separation between elements. In the antenna\nconfiguration we consider here, the metasurface is excited by the fields from\nan attached waveguide. Each metamaterial element can be modeled as a\npolarizable dipole that couples the waveguide mode to radiation modes. Distinct\nfrom the phased array and electronically scanned antenna (ESA) architectures, a\ndynamic metasurface antenna does not require active phase shifters and\namplifiers, but rather achieves reconfigurability by shifting the resonance\nfrequency of each individual metamaterial element. Here we derive the basic\nproperties of a one-dimensional waveguide-fed metasurface antenna in the\napproximation that the metamaterial elements do not perturb the waveguide mode\nand are non-interacting. We derive analytical approximations for the array\nfactors of the 1D antenna, including the effective polarizabilities needed for\namplitude-only, phase-only, and binary constraints. Using full-wave numerical\nsimulations, we confirm the analysis, modeling waveguides with slots or\ncomplementary metamaterial elements patterned into one of the surfaces.\n", "  We use neutron polarization analysis to study spin excitation anisotropy in\nthe optimal-isovalent-doped superconductor BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 (Tc = 30 K).\nDifferent from optimally hole and electron-doped BaFe2As2, where there is a\nclear spin excitation anisotropy in the paramagnetic tetragonal state well\nabove Tc, we find no spin excitation anisotropy for energies above 2 meV in the\nnormal state of BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2. Upon entering the superconducting state,\nsignificant spin excitation anisotropy develops at the antiferromagnetic (AF)\nzone center QAF = (1, 0, L = odd), while magnetic spectrum is isotropy at the\nzone boundary Q = (1, 0, L = even). By comparing temperature, wave vector, and\npolarization dependence of the spin excitation anisotropy in BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2\nand hole-doped Ba0.67K0.33Fe2As2 (Tc = 38 K), we conclude that such anisotropy\narises from spin-orbit coupling and is associated with the nearby AF order and\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  [abridged] We determine the relationship between turbulence energy and gas\ndensity variance for 15 molecular clouds in the Solar neighbourhood. We use the\nlinewidths of the CO molecule as the probe of the turbulence energy (sonic Mach\nnumber, $\\cal{M}_\\mathrm{s}$) and three-dimensional models to reconstruct the\ndensity probability distribution function ($\\rho$-PDF) of the clouds, derived\nusing near-infrared extinction and Herschel dust emission data, as the probe of\nthe density variance ($\\sigma_\\mathrm{s}$). We find no significant correlation\nbetween $\\cal{M}_\\mathrm{s}$ and $\\sigma_\\mathrm{s}$ among the studied clouds,\nhowever, we also cannot rule out a weak correlation. In the context of\nturbulence-dominated gas, the range of the $\\cal{M}_\\mathrm{s}$ and\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{s}$ values corresponds with the model predictions. The data\ncannot constrain whether or not the turbulence driving parameter, $b$, and/or\nthermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio, $\\beta$, vary among the sample clouds. Most\nclouds are not in agreement with field strengths stronger than given by $\\beta\n\\lesssim 0.05$. A model with $b^2 \\beta / (\\beta+1) = 0.30 \\pm 0.06$ provides\nan adequate fit to the cloud sample as a whole. When considering the average\nbehaviour of the sample, we can rule out three regimes: (i) strong compression\ncombined with a weak magnetic field ($b \\gtrsim 0.7$ and $\\beta \\gtrsim 3$),\n(ii) weak compression ($b \\lesssim 0.35$), and (iii) strong magnetic field\n($\\beta \\lesssim 0.1$). Including independent magnetic field strength estimates\nto the analysis, the data rule out solenoidal driving ($b < 0.4$) for the\nmajority of the Solar neighbourhood clouds. However, most clouds have $b$\nparameters larger than unity, which indicates a discrepancy with the\nturbulence-dominated picture; we discuss the possible reasons for this.\n", "  High frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (HF QPOs) detected in the power\nspectra of low mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs) could unveil the fingerprints of\ngravitation in strong field regime. Using the energy-momentum relation we\ncalculate the energy a clump of plasma orbiting in the accretion disk releases\nduring circularization of its slightly eccentric relativistic orbit. Following\nprevious works, we highlight the strong tidal force as mechanism to dissipate\nsuch energy. We show that tides acting on the clump are able to reproduce the\nobserved coherence of the upper HF QPO seen in LMXBs with a neutron star (NS).\nThe quantity of energy released by the clump and relativistic boosting might\ngive a modulation amplitude in agreement with that observed in the upper HF\nQPO. Both the amplitude and coherence of the upper HF QPO in NS LMXBs could\nallow us to disclose, for the first time, the tidal circularization of\nrelativistic orbits occurring around a neutron star.\n", "  We search for the $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ and $1^{+-}$ light tetraquark states with\nmasses up to 2.46~GeV/$c^2$ in $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$ decays with\ndata samples of $(102\\pm 2)$ million and $(158\\pm 4)$ million events,\nrespectively, collected with the Belle detector. No significant signals are\nobserved in any of the studied production modes, and 90\\% credibility level\n(C.L.) upper limits on their branching fractions in $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and\n$\\Upsilon(2S)$ decays are obtained. The inclusive branching fractions of the\n$\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$ decays into final states with $f_1(1285)$ are\nmeasured to be ${\\cal B}(\\Upsilon(1S)\\to f_1(1285)+anything)=(46\\pm28({\\rm\nstat.})\\pm13({\\rm syst.}))\\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\\cal B}(\\Upsilon(2S)\\to\nf_1(1285)+anything)=(22\\pm15({\\rm stat.})\\pm6.3({\\rm syst.}))\\times 10^{-4}$.\nThe measured $\\chi_{b2} \\to J/\\psi + anything$ branching fraction is measured\nto be $(1.50\\pm0.34({\\rm stat.})\\pm0.22({\\rm syst.}))\\times 10^{-3}$, and 90\\%\nC.L. upper limits for the $\\chi_{b0,b1} \\to J/\\psi + anything$ branching\nfractions are found to be $2.3\\times 10^{-3}$ and $1.1\\times 10^{-3}$,\nrespectively. For ${\\cal B}(\\chi_{b1} \\to \\omega + anything)$, the branching\nfraction is measured to be $(4.9\\pm1.3({\\rm stat.})\\pm0.6({\\rm syst.}))\\times\n10^{-2}$. %($<3.68\\times 10^{-2}$ at 90\\% C.L.). All results reported here are\nthe first measurements for these modes.\n", "  After the early observations of the disrupted asteroid P/2016 G1 with the\n10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and the modeling of the dust ejecta, we\nhave performed a follow-up observational campaign of this object using the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) during two epochs (June 28 and July 11, 2016). The\nanalysis of these HST images with the same model inputs obtained from the GTC\nimages revealed a good consistency with the predicted evolution from the GTC\nimages, so that the model is applicable to the whole observational period from\nlate April to early July 2016. This result confirms that the resulting dust\nejecta was caused by a relatively short-duration event with onset about 350\ndays before perihelion, and spanning about 30 days (HWHM). For a size\ndistribution of particles with a geometric albedo of 0.15, having radii limits\nof 1 $\\mu$m and 1 cm, and following a power-law with index --3.0, the total\ndust mass ejected is $\\sim$2$\\times$10$^7$ kg. As was the case with the GTC\nobservations, no condensations in the images that could be attributed to a\nnucleus or fragments released after the disruption event were found. However,\nthe higher limiting magnitude reachable with the HST images in comparison with\nthose from GTC allowed us to impose a more stringent upper limit to the\nobserved fragments of $\\sim$30 m.\n", "  We study analytically the radial Schr\\\"odinger equation with long-range\nattractive potentials whose asymptotic behaviors are dominated by inverse\npower-law tails of the form $V(r)=-\\beta_n r^{-n}$ with $n>2$. In particular,\nassuming that the effective radial potential is characterized by a short-range\ninfinitely repulsive core of radius $R$, we derive a compact {\\it analytical}\nformula for the threshold energy\n$E^{\\text{max}}_l=E^{\\text{max}}_l(n,\\beta_n,R)$ which characterizes the most\nweakly bound-state resonance (the most excited energy level) of the quantum\nsystem.\n", "  We examined Lead (Pb) Substitution effect on a single crystal of a layered\nsuperconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Pb concentration dependence of the lattice\nconstant showed slight anomaly at about 8% and 9% substitution of Pb for Bi.\nThese samples showed the enhancement of the superconducting transition\ntemperature and the superconducting volume fraction. Furthermore, these samples\nshowed the anomaly in the temperature dependence of the resistivity at about\n150K. These results were not observed in Pb substituted NdO0.7F0.3BiS2.\nTherefore, the enhancement of the superconducting properties by Pb substitution\nis related to the structural instability for the pale perturbation in\nLaO0.5F0.5BiS2.\n", "  The chaotic diffusion for a family of Hamiltonian mappings whose angles\ndiverge in the limit of vanishingly action is investigated by using the\nsolution of the diffusion equation. The system is described by a\ntwo-dimensional mapping for the variables action, $I$, and angle, $\\theta$ and\ncontrolled by two control parameters: (i) $\\epsilon$, controlling the\nnonlinearity of the system, particularly a transition from integrable for\n$\\epsilon=0$ to non-integrable for $\\epsilon\\ne0$ and; (ii) $\\gamma$ denoting\nthe power of the action in the equation defining the angle. For $\\epsilon\\ne0$\nthe phase space is mixed and chaos is present in the system leading to a finite\ndiffusion in the action characterized by the solution of the diffusion\nequation. The analytical solution is then compared to the numerical simulations\nshowing a remarkable agreement between the two procedures.\n", "  We conducted zircon (U-Th)/He (ZHe) analysis of lunar impact-melt breccia\n14311 with the aim of leveraging radiation damage accumulated in zircon over\nextended intervals to detect low-temperature or short-lived impact events that\nhave previously eluded traditional isotopic dating techniques. Our ZHe data\nrecord a coherent date vs. effective Uranium concentration (eU) trend\ncharacterized by >3500 Ma dates from low (<75 ppm) eU zircon grains, and ca.\n110 Ma dates for high (>100 ppm) eU grains. A progression between these date\npopulations is apparent for intermediate (75-100 ppm) eU grains. Thermal\nhistory modeling constrains permissible temperatures and cooling rates during\nand following impacts. Modeling shows that the data are most simply explained\nby impact events at ca. 3950 Ma and ca. 110 Ma, and limits allowable\ntemperatures of heating events between 3950-110 Ma. Modeling of solar cycling\nthermal effects at the lunar surface precludes this as the explanation for the\nca. 110 Ma ZHe dates. We propose a sample history characterized by zircon\nresetting during the ca. 3950 Ma Imbrium impact event, with subsequent heating\nduring an impact at ca. 110 Ma that ejected the sample to the vicinity of its\ncollection site. Our data show that zircon has the potential to retain 4He over\nimmense timescales (>3950 Myrs), thus providing a valuable new\nthermochronometer for probing the impact histories of lunar samples, and\nmartian or asteroidal meteorites.\n", "  We report the detection of a highly collimated linear emission-line structure\nin the spiral galaxy NGC\\,232 through the use of integral field spectroscopy\ndata from the All-weather MUse Supernova Integral field Nearby Galaxies\n(AMUSING) survey. This jet--like feature extends radially from the nucleus and\nis primarily detected in [oiii]$\\lambda$5007 without clear evidence of an\noptical continuum counterpart. The length of the radial structure projected on\nsky reaches $\\sim 3$ kpc, which makes NGC\\,232 the second longest emission-line\njet reported. The ionized gas presents extreme [Oiii]/H$\\beta$ and\n[Nii]/H$\\alpha$ line ratios, increasing along the jet-like structure. We\ndiscuss three possible scenarios to explain the observed structure: (i) direct\nionization of in-falling material from the intergalactic medium by the AGN;\n(ii) photo-ionization by an un-detected optical counter-part of the radio jet\nand (iii) fast shocks ionization due to the lateral expansion of the radio jet\nacross the ISM. Our analysis favors in-situ ionization.\n", "  A novel approach for deriving the equation of state for a 2D lattice gas is\nproposed, based on arguments similar to those used in the derivation of the\nLangmuir-Szyszkowski equation of state for localized adsorption. The\nrelationship between surface coverage and excluded area is first extracted from\nRandom Sequential Adsorption simulations incorporating surface diffusion\n(RSAD). The adsorption isotherm is then obtained using kinetic arguments and\nthe Gibbs equation gives the relation between surface pressure and coverage.\nProvided surface diffusion is fast enough to ensure internal equilibrium within\nthe monolayer during the RSAD simulations, the resulting equations of state are\nvery close to the most accurate equivalents obtained by cumbersome\nthermodynamic methods. An internal test of the accuracy of the method is\nobtained by noting that adsorption RSAD simulations starting from an empty\nlattice and desorption simulations starting from a full lattice provide\nconvergent upper and lower bounds on the surface pressure.\n", "  The GW self-energy method has long been recognized as the gold standard for\nquasiparticle (QP) calculations of solids in spite of the fact that the neglect\nof vertex corrections and the use of a DFT starting point lacks rigorous\njustification. In this work we remedy this situation by including a simple\nvertex correction that is consistent with an LDA starting point. We analyse the\neffect of the self-energy by splitting it into a short-range and long-range\nterm which are shown to govern respectively the center and size of the band\ngap. The vertex mainly improves the short-range correlations and therefore has\na small effect on the band gap, while it shifts the band gap center up in\nenergy by around 0.5 eV in good agreement with experiments. Our analysis also\nexplains how the relative importance of short- and long-range interactions in\nstructures of different dimensionality is reflected in their QP energies.\nInclusion of the vertex comes at practically no extra computational cost and\neven improves the basis set convergence compared to GW. The method thus\nprovides an efficient and rigorous improvement over the GW approximation and\nsets a new standard for quasiparticle calculations of solids.\n", "  One of the most prominent dynamical features of turbulent, rapidly-rotating\nconvection is the formation of large-scale coherent structures, driven by\nReynolds stresses resulting from the small-scale convective flows. In spherical\ngeometry, such structures consist of intense zonal flows that are invariant\nalong the rotation axis. In planar geometry, long-lived, depth-invariant\nstructures also form at large scales, but, in the absence of horizontal\nanisotropy, they consist of vortices that grow to the domain size. In this\nwork, through the introduction of horizontal anisotropy into a numerical model\nof planar rotating convection by the adoption of unequal horizontal box sizes\n(i.e. $L_x \\le L_y$, where the $xy$-plane is horizontal), we investigate\nwhether unidirectional flows and large-scale vortices can coexist. We find that\nonly a small degree of anisotropy is required to bring about a transition from\ndynamics dominated by persistent large-scale vortices to dynamics dominated by\npersistent unidirectional flows parallel to the shortest horizontal direction.\nWhen the anisotropy is sufficiently large, the unidirectional flow consists of\nmultiple jets, generated on a timescale smaller than a global viscous\ntimescale, thus signifying that the upscale energy transfer does not\nspontaneously feed the largest available mode in the system. That said, the\nmultiple jets merge on much longer timescales. Large-scale vortices of size\ncomparable with $L_x$ systematically form in the flanks of the jets and can be\npersistent or intermittent. This indicates that large-scale vortices, either\ncoexisting with jets or not, are a robust dynamical feature of planar rotating\nconvection.\n", "  We calculate a low-frequency surface impedance of a dirty, s-wave\nsuperconductor with an imperfect surface incorporating either a thin layer with\na reduced pairing constant or a thin, proximity-coupled normal layer. Such\nstructures model realistic surfaces of superconducting materials which can\ncontain oxide layers, absorbed impurities or nonstoichiometric composition. We\nsolved the Usadel equations self-consistently and obtained spatial\ndistributions of the order parameter and the quasiparticle density of states\nwhich then were used to calculate a low-frequency surface resistance $R_s(T)$\nand the magnetic penetration depth $\\lambda(T)$ as functions of temperature in\nthe limit of local London electrodynamics. It is shown that the imperfect\nsurface in a single-band s-wave superconductor results in a non-exponential\ntemperature dependence of $Z(T)$ at $T\\ll T_c$ which can mimic the behavior of\nmultiband or d-wave superconductors. The imperfect surface and the broadening\nof the gap peaks in the quasiparticle density of states $N(\\epsilon)$ in the\nbulk give rise to a weakly temperature-dependent residual surface resistance.\nWe show that the surface resistance can be optimized and even reduced below its\nvalue for an ideal surface by engineering $N(\\epsilon)$ at the surface using\npairbreaking mechanisms, particularly, by incorporating a small density of\nmagnetic impurities or by tuning the thickness and conductivity of the normal\nlayer and its contact resistance. The results of this work address the limit of\n$R_s$ in superconductors at $T\\ll T_c$, and the ways of engineering the optimal\ndensity of states by surface nano-structuring and impurities to reduce losses\nin superconducting micro-resonators, thin film strip lines, and radio frequency\ncavities for particle accelerators.\n", "  We identify the phase boundary between spiral spin and ferromagnetic phases\nin Au$_2$Mn at a critical pressure of 16.4 kbar, as determined by neutron\ndiffraction, magnetization and magnetoresistance measurements. The\ntemperature-dependent critical field at a given pressure is accompanied by a\npeak in magnetoresistance and a step in magnetization. The critical field\ndecreases with increasing temperature and pressure. The critical pressure\nseparating the spiral phase and ferromagnetism coincides with the disappearance\nof the magnetroresistance peak, where the critical field goes to zero. The\nnotable absence of an anomalous Hall effect in the the ferromagnetic phase is\nattributable to the high conductivity of this material.\n", "  Multiscale and inhomogeneous molecular systems are challenging topics in the\nfield of molecular simulation. In particular, modeling biological systems in\nthe context of multiscale simulations and exploring material properties are\ndriving a permanent development of new simulation methods and optimization\nalgorithms. In computational terms, those methods require parallelization\nschemes that make a productive use of computational resources for each\nsimulation and from its genesis. Here, we introduce the heterogeneous domain\ndecomposition approach which is a combination of an heterogeneity sensitive\nspatial domain decomposition with an \\textit{a priori} rearrangement of\nsubdomain-walls. Within this approach, the theoretical modeling and\nscaling-laws for the force computation time are proposed and studied as a\nfunction of the number of particles and the spatial resolution ratio. We also\nshow the new approach capabilities, by comparing it to both static domain\ndecomposition algorithms and dynamic load balancing schemes. Specifically, two\nrepresentative molecular systems have been simulated and compared to the\nheterogeneous domain decomposition proposed in this work. These two systems\ncomprise an adaptive resolution simulation of a biomolecule solvated in water\nand a phase separated binary Lennard-Jones fluid.\n", "  We study the scattering of scalar waves propagating on the global monopole\nbackground. Since the scalar wave operator in this topological defect is not\nessentially self-adjoint, its solutions are not uniquely determined until a\nboundary condition at the origin is specified. As we show, this boundary\ncondition manifests itself in the differential cross section and can be\ninferred by measuring the amplitude of the backscattered wave. We further\ndemonstrate that whether or not the spacetime is stable under scalar\nperturbations also relies on the chosen boundary condition. In particular, we\nidentify a class of such boundary conditions which significantly affects the\ndifferential cross section without introducing an instability.\n", "  The problem behind this paper is, if the number of queries to unitary\noperations is fixed, say $k$, then when do local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC) suffice for optimally distinguishing bipartite unitary\noperations? We consider the above problem for two-qubit unitary operations in\nthe case of $k=1$, showing that for two two-qubit entangling unitary operations\nwithout local parties, LOCC achieves the same distinguishability as the global\noperations. Specifically, we obtain: (i) if such two unitary operations are\nperfectly distinguishable by global operations, then they are perfectly\ndistinguishable by LOCC too, and (ii) if they are not perfectly distinguishable\nby global operations, then LOCC can achieve the same optimal discrimination\nprobability as the global operations.\n", "  Using the Very Large Array, we have investigated a non-thermal radio filament\n(NTF) recently found very near the Galactic black hole and its radio\ncounterpart, SgrA*. While this NTF -- the Sgr A West Filament (SgrAWF) --\nshares many characteristics with the population of NTFs occupying the central\nfew hundred parsecs of the Galaxy, the SgrAWF has the distinction of having an\norientation and sky location that suggest an intimate physical connection to\nSgrA*. We present 3.3 and 5.5 cm images constructed using an innovative\nmethodology that yields a very high dynamic range, providing an unprecedentedly\nclear picture of the SgrAWF. While the physical association of the SgrAWF with\nSgrA* is not unambiguous, the images decidedly evoke this interesting\npossibility. Assuming that the SgrAWF bears a physical relationship to SgrA*,\nwe examine the potential implications. One is that SgrA* is a source of\nrelativistic particles constrained to diffuse along ordered local field lines.\nThe relativistic particles could also be fed into the local field by a\ncollimated outflow from SgrA*, perhaps driven by the Poynting flux accompanying\nthe black hole spin in the presence of a magnetic field threading the event\nhorizon. Second, we consider the possibility that the SgrAWF is the\nmanifestation of a low-mass-density cosmic string that has become anchored to\nthe black hole. The simplest form of these hypotheses would predict that the\nfilament be bi-directional, whereas the SgrAWF is only seen on one side of\nSgrA*, perhaps because of the dynamics of the local medium.\n", "  The hour-glass-like dispersion of spin excitations is a common feature of\nunderdoped cuprates. It was qualitatively explained by the random phase\napproximation based on various ordered states with some phenomenological\nparameters; however, its origin remains elusive. Here, we present a numerical\nstudy of spin dynamics in the $t$-$J$ model using the variational Monte Carlo\nmethod. This parameter-free method satisfies the no double-occupancy constraint\nof the model and thus provides a better evaluation on the spin dynamics with\nrespect to various mean-field trial states. We conclude that the lower branch\nof the hour-glass dispersion is a collective mode and the upper branch is more\nlikely the consequence of the stripe state than the other candidates.\n", "  We study numerically the superconductor-insulator transition in\ntwo-dimensional inhomogeneous superconductors with gauge disorder, described by\nfour different quantum rotor models: a gauge glass, a flux glass, a binary\nphase glass and a Gaussian phase glass. The first two models, describe the\ncombined effect of geometrical disorder in the array of local superconducting\nislands and a uniform external magnetic field while the last two describe the\neffects of random negative Josephson-junction couplings or $\\pi$ junctions.\nMonte Carlo simulations in the path-integral representation of the models are\nused to determine the critical exponents and the universal conductivity at the\nquantum phase transition. The gauge and flux glass models display the same\ncritical behavior, within the estimated numerical uncertainties. Similar\nagreement is found for the binary and Gaussian phase-glass models. Despite the\ndifferent symmetries and disorder correlations, we find that the universal\nconductivity of these models is approximately the same. In particular, the\nratio of this value to that of the pure model agrees with recent experiments on\nnanohole thin film superconductors in a magnetic field, in the large disorder\nlimit.\n", "  Nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation provides a means to perform fast\nand robust quantum gates. It has been implemented in various physical systems,\nsuch as trapped ions, nuclear magnetic resonance and superconducting circuits.\nAnother system being adequate for implementation of nonadiabatic geometric\nquantum computation may be Rydberg atoms, since their internal states have very\nlong coherence time and the Rydberg-mediated interaction facilitates the\nimplementation of a two-qubit gate. Here, we propose a scheme of nonadiabatic\ngeometric quantum computation based on Rydberg atoms, which combines the\nrobustness of nonadiabatic geometric gates with the merits of Rydberg atoms.\n", "  In this paper the sensor noise of two geophone configurations (L-22D and L-4C\ngeophones from Sercel with custom built amplifiers) was measured by performing\ntwo huddle tests. It is shown that the accuracy of the results can be\nsignificantly improved by performing the huddle test in a seismically quiet\nenvironment and by using a large number of reference sensors to remove the\nseismic foreground signal from the data. Using these two techniques, the\nmeasured sensor noise of the two geophone configurations matched calculated\npredictions remarkably well in the bandwidth of interest (0.01 Hz to 100 Hz).\nLow noise operational amplifiers OPA188 were utilized to amplify the L-4C\ngeophone to give a sensor that was characterized to be near Johnson noise\nlimited in the bandwidth of interest with a noise value of $10^{-11}\n\\text{m}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz.\n", "  The internal chirality of Cooper pairs is shown to modify strongly the\nresponse of a superconductor to the local heating by a laser beam. The\nsuppression of the chiral order parameter inside the hot spot appears to induce\nthe supercurrents flowing around the spot region. The chirality affects also\nthe sequential stage of thermal quench developing according to the Kibble-Zurek\nscenario: besides the generation of vortex-antivortex pairs the quench\nfacilitates the formation of superconducting domains with different chirality.\nThese fingerprints of the chiral superconducting state can be probed by any\nexperimental techniques sensitive to the local magnetic field. The\nsupercurrents encircling the hot spot originate from the inhomogeneity of the\nstate with the broken time reversal symmetry and their detection would provide\na convenient alternative to the search of the spontaneous edge currents\nsensitive to the boundary properties. Thus, the suggested setup can help to\nresolve the long-standing problem of unambiguous detection of type of pairing\nin Sr2RuO4 considered as a good candidate for chiral superconductivity.\n", "  Dynamically varying system parameters along a path enclosing an exceptional\npoint is known to lead to chiral mode conversion. But is it necessary to\ninclude this non-Hermitian degeneracy inside the contour for this process to\ntake place? We show that a slow enough variation of parameters, even away from\nthe system's exceptional point, can also lead to a robust asymmetric state\nexchange. To study this process, we consider a prototypical two-level\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a constant coupling between elements. Closed\nform solutions are obtained when the amplification/attenuation coefficients in\nthis arrangement are varied in conjunction with the resonance detuning along a\ncircular contour. Using asymptotic expansions, this input-independent mode\nconversion is theoretically proven to take place irrespective of whether the\nexceptional point is enclosed or not upon encirclement. Our results\nsignificantly broaden the range of parameter space required for the\nexperimental realization of such chiral mode conversion processes.\n", "  In this article, we provide analytical expressions for the photon\npolarization tensor in pulsed Hermite- and Laguerre-Gaussian laser beams. Our\nresults are based on a locally constant field approximation of the one-loop\nHeisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian for quantum electrodynamics. Hence, by\nconstruction they are limited to slowly varying electromagnetic fields, varying\non spatial and temporal scales significantly larger than the Compton\nwavelength/time of the electron. The latter criterion is fulfilled by all laser\nbeams currently available in the laboratory. Our findings will, e.g., be\nrelevant for the study of vacuum birefringence experienced by probe photons\nbrought into collision with a high-intensity laser pulse which can be\nrepresented as a superposition of either Hermite- or Laguerre-Gaussian modes.\n", "  In this paper, we study the gravitational wave polarization modes for some\nparticular $f(R)$ models using Newman-Penrose formalism. We find two extra\nscalar modes of gravitational wave (longitudinal and transversal modes) in\naddition to two tensor modes of general relativity. We conclude that\ngravitational waves correspond to class $II_{6}$ under the Lorentz-invariant\nE(2) classification of plane null waves for these $f(R)$ models.\n", "  In this paper, we present the first extended catalogue of far-infrared fluxes\nof Galactic bubbles. Fluxes were estimated for 1814 bubbles, defined here as\nthe `golden sample', and were selected from the Milky Way Project First Data\nRelease (Simpson et al.) The golden sample was comprised of bubbles identified\nwithin the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) dataset (using 12- and\n22-$\\mu$m images) and Herschel data (using 70-, 160-, 250-, 350- and 500-$\\mu$m\nwavelength images). Flux estimation was achieved initially via classical\naperture photometry and then by an alternative image analysis algorithm that\nused active contours. The accuracy of the two methods was tested by comparing\nthe estimated fluxes for a sample of bubbles, made up of 126 H II regions and\n43 planetary nebulae, which were identified by Anderson et al. The results of\nthis paper demonstrate that a good agreement between the two was found. This is\nby far the largest and most homogeneous catalogue of infrared fluxes measured\nfor Galactic bubbles and it is a step towards the fully automated analysis of\nastronomical datasets.\n", "  $\\mathit{Context.}$ The thermal conductivity of highly porous dust aggregates\nis a key parameter for many subjects in planetary science; however, it is not\nyet fully understood. $\\mathit{Aims.}$ In this study, we investigate the\nthermal conductivity of fluffy dust aggregates with filling factors of less\nthan $10^{-1}$. $\\mathit{Methods.}$ We determine the temperature structure and\nheat flux of the porous dust aggregates calculated by $N$-body simulations of\nstatic compression in the periodic boundary condition. $\\mathit{Results.}$ We\nderive an empirical formula for the thermal conductivity through the solid\nnetwork $k_{\\rm sol}$ as a function of the filling factor of dust aggregates\n$\\phi$. The results reveal that $k_{\\rm sol}$ is approximately proportional to\n${\\phi}^{2}$, and the thermal conductivity through the solid network is\nsignificantly lower than previously assumed. In light of these findings, we\nmust reconsider the thermal histories of small planetary bodies.\n", "  In the quest for exotic superconducting pairing states, the Rashba effect,\nwhich lifts the electron-spin degeneracy as a consequence of strong spin-orbit\ninteraction (SOI) under broken inversion symmetry, has attracted considerable\ninterest. Here, to introduce the Rashba effect into two-dimensional (2D)\nstrongly correlated electron systems, we fabricate non-centrosymmetric\n(tricolor) superlattices composed of three kinds of $f$-electron compounds with\natomic thickness; $d$-wave heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ sandwiched\nby two different nonmagnetic metals, YbCoIn$_5$ and YbRhIn$_5$. We find that\nthe Rashba SOI induced global inversion symmetry breaking in these tricolor\nKondo superlattices leads to profound changes in the superconducting properties\nof CeCoIn$_5$, which are revealed by unusual temperature and angular\ndependences of upper critical fields that are in marked contrast with the bulk\nCeCoIn$_5$ single crystals. We demonstrate that the Rashba effect incorporated\ninto 2D CeCoIn$_5$ block layers is largely tunable by changing the layer\nthickness. Moreover, the temperature dependence of in-plane upper critical\nfield exhibits an anomalous upturn at low temperatures, which is attributed to\na possible emergence of a helical or stripe superconducting phase. Our results\ndemonstrate that the tricolor Kondo superlattices provide a new playground for\nexploring exotic superconducting states in the strongly correlated 2D electron\nsystems with the Rashba effect.\n", "  Momentum deposition by radiation pressure from young, massive stars may help\nto destroy molecular clouds and unbind stellar clusters by driving large-scale\noutflows. We extend our previous numerical radiation hydrodynamic study of\nturbulent, star-forming clouds to analyze the detailed interaction between\nnon-ionizing UV radiation and the cloud material. Our simulations trace the\nevolution of gas and star particles through self-gravitating collapse, star\nformation, and cloud destruction via radiation-driven outflows. These models\nare idealized in that we include only radiation feedback and adopt an\nisothermal equation of state. Turbulence creates a structure of dense filaments\nand large holes through which radiation escapes, such that only ~50% of the\nradiation is (cumulatively) absorbed by the end of star formation. The surface\ndensity distribution of gas by mass as seen by the central cluster is roughly\nlognormal with sigma_ln(Sigma) = 1.3-1.7, similar to the externally-projected\nsurface density distribution. This allows low surface density regions to be\ndriven outwards to nearly 10 times their initial escape speed v_esc. Although\nthe velocity distribution of outflows is broadened by the lognormal surface\ndensity distribution, the overall efficiency of momentum injection to the gas\ncloud is reduced because much of the radiation escapes. The mean outflow\nvelocity is approximately twice the escape speed from the initial cloud radius.\nOur results are also informative for understanding galactic-scale wind driving\nby radiation, in particular the relationship between velocity and surface\ndensity for individual outflow structures, and the resulting velocity and mass\ndistributions arising from turbulent sources.\n", "  Low-pressure gaseous TPCs are well suited detectors to correlate the\ndirections of nuclear recoils to the galactic Dark Matter (DM) halo. Indeed, in\naddition to providing a measure of the energy deposition due to the elastic\nscattering of a DM particle on a nucleus in the target gas, they allow for the\nreconstruction of the track of the recoiling nucleus. In order to exclude the\nbackground events originating from radioactive decays on the surfaces of the\ndetector materials within the drift volume, efforts are ongoing to precisely\nlocalize the track nuclear recoil in the drift volume along the axis\nperpendicular to the cathode plane. We report here the implementation of the\nmeasure of the signal induced on the cathode by the motion of the primary\nelectrons toward the anode in a MIMAC chamber. As a validation, we performed an\nindependent measurement of the drift velocity of the electrons in the\nconsidered gas mixture, correlating in time the cathode signal with the measure\nof the arrival times of the electrons on the anode.\n", "  We introduce the Optimal Fingerprinting Process which is aimed at accurately\nidentifying the parameters which characterize the dynamics of a physical\nsystem. A database is first built from the time evolution of an ensemble of\ndynamical systems driven by a specific field, which is designed by optimal\ncontrol theory to maximize the efficiency of the recognition process. Curve\nfitting is then applied to enhance the precision of the identification. As an\nillustrative example, we consider the estimation of the relaxation parameters\nof a spin- 1/2 particle. The experimental results are in good accordance with\nthe theoretical computations. We show on this example a physical limit of the\nestimation process.\n", "  Ferroelectrics with suitable band gaps have recently attracted attention as\ncandidate solar absorbing materials for photovoltaics. The inversion symmetry\nbreaking may promote the separation of photo-excited carriers and allow\nvoltages higher than the band gap. However, these effects are not fully\nunderstood, in part because of a lack of suitable model systems for studying\nthese effects in detail. Here, we report properties of ferroelectric\nSn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ and Sn$_2$P$_2$Se$_6$ using first principles calculations.\nResults are given for the electronic structure, carrier pocket shapes, optical\nabsorption and transport. We find indirect band gaps of 2.20 eV and 1.55 eV,\nrespectively, and favorable band structures for carrier transport, including\nboth holes and electrons. Strong absorption is found above the direct gaps of\n2.43 eV and 1.76 eV. Thus these compounds may serve as useful model systems for\nunderstanding photovoltaic effects in ferroelectric semiconductors.\n", "  Based on an analytic approach, we present a theoretical review on the\nabsorption, scattering, and extinction of both dipole scatterers and regular\narrays composed of such scatterers i.e., metasurfaces. Besides offering a\ntutorial by outlining the maximum absorption limit for\nelectrically/magnetically resonant dipole particles/metasurfaces, we give an\neducative analytical approach to their analysis. Moreover, we put forward the\nanalysis of two known alternatives in providing perfect absorbers out of\nelectrically and or magnetically resonant metasurfaces; one is based on the\nsimultaneous presence of both electric and magnetic responses in so called\nHuygens metasurfaces while the other is established upon the presence of a back\nreflector in so called Salisbury absorbers. Our work is supported by several\nnumerical examples to clarify the discussions in each stage.\n", "  Filamentous bacteriophages such as fd-like viruses are monodisperse rod-like\ncolloids that have well defined properties: diameter, length, rigidity, charge\nand chirality. Engineering those viruses leads to a library of colloidal rods\nwhich can be used as building blocks for reconfigurable and hierarchical\nself-assembly. Their condensation in aqueous solution \\th{with additive\npolymers which act as depletants to induce} attraction between the rods leads\nto a myriad of fluid-like micronic structures ranging from isotropic/nematic\ndroplets, colloid membranes, achiral membrane seeds, twisted ribbons,\n$\\pi$-wall, pores, colloidal skyrmions, M\\\"obius anchors, scallop membranes to\nmembrane rafts. Those structures and the way they shape shift not only shed\nlight on the role of entropy, chiral frustration and topology in soft matter\nbut it also mimics many structures encountered in different fields of science.\nOn one hand, filamentous phages being an experimental realization of colloidal\nhard rods, their condensation mediated by depletion interactions constitutes a\nblueprint for self-assembly of rod-like particles and provides fundamental\nfoundation for bio- or material oriented applications. On the other hand, the\nchiral properties of the viruses restrict the generalities of some results but\nvastly broaden the self-assembly possibilities.\n", "  Nanocomposites are promising candidates for the next generation of\nthermoelectric materials since they exhibit extremely low thermal\nconductivities as a result of phonon scattering on the boundaries of the\nvarious material phases. The nanoinclusions, however, should not degrade the\nthermoelectric power factor, and ideally should increase it, so that benefits\nto the ZT figure of merit can be achieved. In this work we employ the\nNon-Equilibrium Greens Function (NEGF) quantum transport method to calculate\nthe electronic and thermoelectric coefficients of materials embedded with\nnanoinclusions. For computational effectiveness we consider two-dimensional\nnanoribbon geometries, however, the method includes the details of geometry,\nelectron-phonon interactions, quantisation, tunneling, and the ballistic to\ndiffusive nature of transport, all combined in a unified approach. This makes\nit a convenient and accurate way to understand electronic and thermoelectric\ntransport in nanomaterials, beyond semiclassical approximations, and beyond\napproximations that deal with the complexities of the geometry. We show that\nthe presence of nanoinclusions within a matrix material offers opportunities\nfor only weak energy filtering, significantly lower in comparison to\nsuperlattices, and thus only moderate power factor improvements. However, we\ndescribe how such nanocomposites can be optimised to limit degradation in the\nthermoelectric power factor and elaborate on the conditions that achieve the\naforementioned mild improvements. Importantly, we show that under certain\nconditions, the power factor is independent of the density of nanoinclusions,\nmeaning that materials with large nanoinclusion densities which provide very\nlow thermal conductivities, can also retain large power factors and result in\nlarge ZT figures of merit.\n", "  SN 2015J was discovered on April 27th 2015 and is classified as a type IIn\nsupernova. At first, it appeared to be an orphan SN candidate, i.e. without any\nclear identification of its host galaxy. Here, we present the analysis of the\nobservations carried out {by the VLT 8-m class telescope with the FORS2 camera\nin the R band and the Magellan telescope (6.5 m) equipped with the IMACS\nShort-Camera (V and I filters) and the FourStar camera (Ks filter)}. We show\nthat SN 2015J resides in what appears to be a very compact galaxy establishing\na relation between the SN event and its natural host. We also present and\ndiscuss archival and new $X$-ray data centred on SN 2015J. At the time of the\nsupernova explosion, Swift/XRT observations were made and a weak X-ray source\nwas detected at the location of SN 2015J. Almost one year later, the same\nsource was unambiguously identified during serendipitous observations by\nSwift/XRT and $XMM$-Newton, clearly showing an enhancement of the 0.3-10 keV\nband flux by a factor $\\simeq 30$ with respect to the initial state. Swift/XRT\nobservations show that the source is still active in the $X$-rays at a level of\n$\\simeq 0.05$ counts s$^{-1}$. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity derived from the\n{\\it XMM}-Newton slew and SWIFT observations, $L_{x}\\simeq 5\\times10^{41}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, places SN 2015J among the brightest young supernovae in X-rays.\n", "  The evolution of the solar neutrino flux which is described by the wave\nfunction $\\Psi^T=(\\nu_{eL},\\nu_{XL}, \\overline{\\nu}_{eL}, \\overline{\\nu}_{XL})$\nis examined. Our treatment of the problem holds for any standard model (SM)\nextensions possessing nonzero dipole magnetic and anapole moments. When the\nsolar neutrino flux moves through the solar flare (SF) region in the preflare\nperiod, then it undergoes the additional (compared with the SM) resonance\nconversions. As a result, the weakening the electron neutrinos flux takes\nplace. On the other hand, existence of the additional resonances lead to\nappearance of the $\\overline{\\nu}_{eL}$ and $\\overline{\\nu}_{XL}$ neutrinos\nthat could be detected by the terrestrial detectors.\n  The hypothesis of the $\\nu_e$-induced $\\beta$-decays is also discussed.\nAccording to it, before the large SF, decreasing the $\\beta$-decay rate for\nsome elements takes place. The possible influence of the electron antineutrino\nflux produced in the superflares on the regime of the hypothetical georeactor\nis considered.\n", "  We present the first detailed analysis of three extragalactic fields (IRAC\nDark Field, ELAIS-N1, ADF-S) observed by the infrared satellite, AKARI, using\nan optimised data analysis toolkit specifically for the processing of\nextragalactic point sources. The InfraRed Camera (IRC) on AKARI complements the\nSpitzer space telescope via its comprehensive coverage between 8-24 microns\nfilling the gap between the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS instruments. Source counts in\nthe AKARI bands at 3.2, 4.1, 7, 11, 15 and 18 microns are presented. At\nnear-infrared wavelengths, our source counts are consistent with counts made in\nother AKARI fields and in general with Spitzer/IRAC (except at 3.2 microns\nwhere our counts lie above). In the mid-infrared (11 - 18 microns) we find our\ncounts are consistent with both previous surveys by AKARI and the Spitzer\npeak-up imaging survey with the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS). Using our counts\nto constrain contemporary evolutionary models we find that although the models\nand counts are in agreement at mid-infrared wavelengths there are\ninconsistencies at wavelengths shortward of 7 microns, suggesting either a\nproblem with stellar subtraction or indicating the need for refinement of the\nstellar population models. We have also investigated the AKARI/IRC filters, and\nfind an AGN selection criteria out to $z<2$ on the basis of AKARI 4.1, 11, 15\nand 18 microns colours.\n", "  We report on three-dimensional (3D) Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of\nrecurrent eruptions in emerging flux regions. We find that reconnection of\nsheared fieldlines, along the polarity inversion line of an emerging bipolar\nregion, leads to the formation of a new magnetic structure, which adopts the\nshape of a magnetic flux rope during its rising motion. Initially, the flux\nrope undergoes a slow-rise phase and, eventually, it experiences a fast-rise\nphase and ejective eruption towards the outer solar atmosphere. In total, four\neruptions occur during the evolution of the system. For the first eruption, our\nanalysis indicates that the torus instability initiates the eruption and that\ntether-cutting reconnection of the fieldlines, which envelope the flux rope,\ntriggers the rapid acceleration of the eruptive field. For the following\neruptions, we conjecture that it is the interplay between tether-cutting\nreconnection and torus instability, which causes the onset of the various\nphases. We show the 3D shape of the erupting fields, focusing more on how\nmagnetic fieldlines reconnect during the eruptions. We find that when the\nenvelope fieldlines reconnect mainly with themselves, hot and dense plasma is\ntransferred closer to the core of the erupting flux rope. The same area appears\nto be cooler and less dense when the envelope fieldlines reconnect with\nneighboring sheared fieldlines. The plasma density and temperature\ndistribution, together with the rising speeds, the energies and the size of the\nerupting fields indicate that they may account for small-scale (mini) Coronal\nMass Ejections (CMEs).\n", "  Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for two neutrino double beta decays are\ndiscussed in terms of the Fermi Surface Quasi-Particle (FSQP) Model. The\nevaluated NMEs agree with the observed NMEs . The new NMEs for two neutrino\ndouble beta decays from Kr78, Cd106, Ba130, and Pd110 were evaluated by FSQP.\nThe NMEs show shell configuration dependence. Impacts of the FSQP NMEs for two\nneutrino double beta decays on the NMEs for neutrino less double beta decays\nare discussed.\n", "  Functional brain network has been widely studied to understand the\nrelationship between brain organization and behavior. In this paper, we aim to\nexplore the functional connectivity of brain network under a \\emph{multi-step}\ncognitive task involving with consecutive behaviors, and further understand the\neffect of behaviors on the brain organization. The functional brain networks\nare constructed base on a high spatial and temporal resolution fMRI dataset and\nanalyzed via complex network based approach. We find that at voxel level the\nfunctional brain network shows robust small-worldness and scale-free\ncharacteristics, while its assortativity and rich-club organization are\nslightly restricted to order of behaviors performed. More interestingly, the\nfunctional connectivity of brain network in activated ROIs strongly correlates\nwith behaviors and behaves obvious differences restricted to order of behaviors\nperformed. These empirical results suggest that the brain organization has the\ngeneric properties of small-worldness and scale-free characteristics, and its\ndiverse function connectivity emerging from activated ROIs is strongly driven\nby these behavioral activities via the plasticity of brain.\n", "  The hyperfine induced\n$4f^{14}5s5p~^3\\mathrm{P}^o_{0,2}~-~4f^{14}5s^2~^1\\mathrm{S}_0$ transition\nprobabilities for highly charged Sm-like ions are calculated in the framework\nof the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. Electron correlation, the\nBreit interaction and quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects are taken into\naccount. For ions ranging from $Z=79$ to $Z=94$,\n$4f^{14}5s5p~^3\\mathrm{P}^o_{0}$ is the first excited state, and the hyperfine\ninduced transition is an dominant decay channel. For the\n$4f^{14}5s5p~^3\\mathrm{P}^o_{2}$ state, the hyperfine induced transition (HIT)\nrates of Sm-like ions with $Z=82-94$ are reported as well as the magnetic\ndipole (M1) $^3\\mathrm{P}^o_2 ~-~ ^3\\mathrm{P}^o_1$, the electric quadrupole\n(E2) $^3\\mathrm{P}^o_2 ~-~ ^3\\mathrm{P}^o_{0,1}$, and the magnetic quadrupole\n(M2) $^3\\mathrm{P}^o_2 ~-~ ^1\\mathrm{S}_0$ transition probabilities. It is\nfound that M1 transition from the $4f^{14}5s5p~^3\\mathrm{P}^o_2$ state is the\nmost important decay channel in this range on $Z \\ge 82$.\n", "  Disorder inevitably exists in realistic samples, manifesting itself in\nvarious exotic properties for the topological states. In this paper, we\nsummarize and briefly review work completed over the last few years, including\nour own, regarding recent developments in several topics about disorder effects\nin topological states. For weak disorder, the robustness of topological states\nis demonstrated, especially for both quantum spin Hall states with $Z_2=1$ and\nsize induced nontrivial topological insulators with $Z_2=0$. For moderate\ndisorder, by increasing the randomness of both the impurity distribution and\nthe impurity induced potential, the topological insulator states can be created\nfrom normal metallic or insulating states. These phenomena and their mechanisms\nare summarized. For strong disorder, the disorder causes a metal-insulator\ntransition. Due to their topological nature, the phase diagrams are much richer\nin topological state systems. Finally, the trends in these areas of disorder\nresearch are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the Tully-Fisher Relation (TFR) for a morphologically and\nkine- matically diverse sample of galaxies from the SAMI Galaxy Survey using 2\ndimensional spatially resolved Halpha velocity maps and find a well defined\nrelation across the stellar mass range of 8.0 < log(M*) < 11.5. We use an\nadaptation of kinemetry to parametrise the kinematic Halpha asymmetry of all\ngalaxies in the sample, and find a correlation between scatter (i.e. residuals\noff the TFR) and asymmetry. This effect is pronounced at low stellar mass,\ncorresponding to the inverse relationship between stellar mass and kinematic\nasymmetry found in previous work. For galaxies with log(M*) < 9.5, 25 +/- 3%\nare scattered below the root mean square (RMS) of the TFR, whereas for galaxies\nwith log(M*) > 9.5 the fraction is 10 +/- 1% We use 'simulated slits' to\ndirectly compare our results with those from long slit spectroscopy and find\nthat aligning slits with the photometric, rather than the kinematic, position\nangle, increases global scatter below the TFR. Further, kinematic asymmetry is\ncorrelated with misalignment between the photometric and kinematic position\nangles. This work demonstrates the value of 2D spatially resolved kinematics\nfor accurate TFR studies; integral field spectroscopy reduces the\nunderestimation of rotation velocity that can occur from slit positioning off\nthe kinematic axis.\n", "  We calculate the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions of the\nBohrs collective Hamiltonian with the help of the modified Poschl-Teller\npotential model within -unstable structure. Our numerical results for the\nground state beta and gamma band heads together with the electric quadrupole\nB(E2) transition rates are displayed and compared with those available\nexperimental data.\n", "  As supernova remnants (SNRs) age, they become efficient cosmic ray\naccelerators at their outer shell shocks. The current paradigm for shock\nacceleration theory favors turbulent field environs in the proximity of these\nshocks, turbulence driven by current instabilities involving energetic ions.\nWith the imminent prospect of dedicated X-ray polarimeters becoming a reality,\nthe possibility looms of probing turbulence on scales that couple to the\nsuper-TeV electrons that emit X-rays. This paper presents model X-ray\npolarization signatures from energetic electrons moving in simulated MHD\nturbulence of varying levels of \"chaos.\" The emission volumes are finite slabs\nthat represent the active regions of young SNR shells. We find that the\nturbulent field energy must be quite limited relative to that of the total\nfield in order for the X-ray polarization degree to be as strong as the radio\nmeasures obtained in some remnants. Results presented are pertinent to the\nplanned IXPE and XIPE polarimeters.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals semiconductors have emerged as a class of\nmaterials with promising device characteristics owing to the intrinsic bandgap.\nFor realistic applications, the ideal is to modify the bandgap in a controlled\nmanner by a mechanism that can be generally applied to this class of materials.\nHere, we report the observation of a universally tunable bandgap in the family\nof bulk 2H transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) by in situ surface doping of\nRb atoms. A series of angle-resolved photoemission spectra unexceptionally\nshows that the bandgap of TMDs at the zone corners is modulated in the range of\n0.8 ~ 2.0 eV, which covers a wide spectral range from visible to near infrared,\nwith a tendency from indirect to direct bandgap. A key clue to understand the\nmechanism of this bandgap engineering is provided by the spectroscopic\nsignature of symmetry breaking and resultant spin splitting, which can be\nexplained by the formation of 2D electric dipole layers within the surface\nbilayer of TMDs. Our results establish the surface Stark effect as a universal\nmechanism of bandgap engineering based on the strong 2D nature of van-der-Waals\nsemiconductors.\n", "  In this paper, we study the quantum self-contained refrigerator [N. Linden,\nS. Popescu and P. Skrzypczyk, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{105}, 130401 (2010)] in\nthe strong internal coupling regime with engineered reservoirs. We find that if\nsome modes of the three thermal reservoirs can be properly filtered out, the\nefficiency and the working domain of the refrigerator can be improved in\ncontrast to the those in the weak internal coupling regime, which indicates one\nadvantage of the strong internal coupling. In addition, we find that the\nbackground natural vacuum reservoir could cause the filtered refrigerator to\nstop working and the background natural thermal reservoir could greatly reduce\nthe cooling efficiency.\n", "  We consider the hydrodynamic stability of homogeneous, incompressible and\nrotating ellipsoidal fluid masses. The latter are the simplest models of fluid\ncelestial bodies with internal rotation and subjected to tidal forces. The\nclassical problem is the stability of Roche--Riemann ellipsoids moving on\ncircular Kepler orbits. However, previous stability studies have to be\nreassessed. Indeed, they only consider global perturbations of large wavelength\nor local perturbations of short wavelength. Moreover many planets and stars\nundergo orbital motions on eccentric Kepler orbits, implying time-dependent\nellipsoidal semi-axes. This time dependence has never been taken into account\nin hydrodynamic stability studies. In this work we overcome these stringent\nassumptions. We extend the hydrodynamic stability analysis of rotating\nellipsoids to the case of eccentric orbits. We have developed two open-source\nand versatile numerical codes to perform global and local inviscid stability\nanalyses. They give sufficient conditions for instability. The global method,\nbased on an exact and closed Galerkin basis, handles rigorously global\nellipsoidal perturbations of unprecedented complexity. Tidally driven and\nlibration-driven elliptical instabilities are first recovered and unified\nwithin a single framework. Then we show that new global fluid instabilities can\nbe triggered in ellipsoids by tidal effects due to eccentric Kepler orbits.\nTheir existence is confirmed by a local analysis and direct numerical\nsimulations of the fully nonlinear and viscous problem. Thus a non-zero orbital\neccentricity may have a strong destabilising effect in celestial fluid bodies,\nwhich may lead to space-filling turbulence in most of the parameters range.\n", "  Kinetics of electrochemical reactions are several orders of magnitude slower\nin solids than in liquids as a result of the much lower ion diffusivity. Yet,\nthe solid state maximizes the density of redox species, which is at least two\norders of magnitude lower in liquids because of solubility limitations. With\nregard to electrochemical energy storage devices, this leads to high-energy\nbatteries with limited power and high-power supercapacitors with a well-known\nenergy deficiency. For such devices the ideal system should endow the liquid\nstate with a density of redox species close to the solid state. Here we report\nan approach based on biredox ionic liquids to achieve bulk-like redox density\nat liquid like fast kinetics. The cation and anion of these biredox ILs bear\nmoieties that undergo very fast reversible redox reactions. As a first\ndemonstration of their potential for high-capacity / high-rate charge storage,\nwe used them in redox supercapacitors. These ionic liquids are able to decouple\ncharge storage from ion accessible electrode surface, by storing significant\ncharge in the pores of the electrodes, to minimize self-discharge and leakage\ncurrent as a result of retaining the redox species in the pores, and to raise\nworking voltage due to their wide electrochemical window.\n", "  A well-known result in the study of convex polyhedra, due to Minkowski, is\nthat a convex polyhedron is uniquely determined (up to translation) by the\ndirections and areas of its faces. The theorem guarantees existence of the\npolyhedron associated to given face normals and areas, but does not provide a\nconstructive way to find it explicitly. This article provides an algorithm to\nreconstruct 3D convex polyhedra from their face normals and areas, based on an\nmethod by Lasserre to compute the volume of a convex polyhedron in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$. A Python implementation of the algorithm is available at\nhttps://github.com/gsellaroli/polyhedrec.\n", "  Continuous Matrix Product States (cMPS) are powerful variational ansatz\nstates for ground states of continuous quantum field theories in (1+1)\ndimension. In this paper we introduce a novel parametrization of the cMPS wave\nfunction based on basis-spline functions, which we coin spline-based MPS\n(spMPS), and develop novel regauging techniques for inhomogeneous cMPS. We\nextend a recently developed ground-state optimization algorithm for\ntranslational invariant cMPS [M. Ganahl, J. Rinc\\'on, G.Vidal. Phys.Rev.Lett.\n118,220402 (2017)] to the case of inhomogeneous cMPS and, as\nproof-of-principle, use it to obtain the ground-state of a gas of Lieb-Liniger\nbosons in a periodic potential. The proposed method provides a first working\nimplementation of a cMPS optimization for non-translational invariant\ncontinuous Hamiltonians.\n", "  We show that contrary to what it is claimed in Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{94},\n022329 (2016), in general the local projective measurement that induces maximal\ncoherence loss is \\textit{not} the projection onto the local basis that defines\nthe coherence of the system, at least for all quantum-incoherent states.\n", "  The exact interior static solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations in Bondi's\ncoordinates for the electrically charged fluid ball is obtained as a source of\nthe Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution.\n", "  This work is devoted to further consideration of the Henon map with negative\nvalues of the shrinking parameter and the study of transient oscillations,\nmultistability, and possible existence of hidden attractors. The computation of\nthe finite-time Lyapunov exponents by different algorithms is discussed. A new\nadaptive algorithm for the finite-time Lyapunov dimension computation in\nstudying the dynamics of dimension is used. Analytical estimates of the\nLyapunov dimension using the localization of attractors are given. A proof of\nthe conjecture on the Lyapunov dimension of self-excited attractors and\nderivation of the exact Lyapunov dimension formula are revisited.\n", "  We present a topologically trivial, non-vacuum solution of the Einstein's\nfield equations in four-dimensions, which is regular everywhere. The metric\nadmits circular closed timelike curves, which appear beyond the null curve, and\nthese timelike curves are linearly stable under linear perturbations.\nAdditionally, the spacetime admits null geodesics curve which are not closed,\nand the metric is of type D in the Petrov classification scheme. The\nstress-energy tensor anisotropic fluid satisfy the different energy conditions\nand a generalization of Equation-of-State parameter of perfect fluid\n$p=\\omega\\,\\rho$. The metric admits a twisting, shearfree, non-exapnding\ntimelike geodesic congruence. Finally, the physical interpretation of this\nsolution, based on the study of the equation of the geodesics deviation, will\nbe presented.\n", "  This proceeding covers tools and technologies at our disposal for scientific\ndata preservation and shows that this extends the scientific reach of our\nexperiments. It is cost-efficient to warehouse data from completed experiments\non the tape archives of our national and international laboratories. These\nsubject-specific data stores also offer the technologies to capture and archive\nknowledge about experiments in the form of technical notes, electronic logs,\nwebsites, etc. Furthermore, it is possible to archive our source code and\ncomputing environments. The paper illustrates these challenges with experience\nfrom preserving the LEP data for the long term.\n", "  We present a photometric study of M13 multiple stellar populations over a\nwide field of view, covering approximately 6.5 half-light radii, using archival\nIsaac Newton Telescope observations to build an accurate multi-band Str\\\"omgren\ncatalogue. The use of the Str\\\"omgren index $c_{y}$ permits us to separate the\nmultiple populations of M13 on the basis of their position on the red giant\nbranch. The comparison with medium and high resolution spectroscopic analysis\nconfirms the robustness of our selection criterion. To determine the radial\ndistribution of stars in M13, we complemented our dataset with Hubble Space\nTelescope observations of the cluster core, to compensate for the effect of\nincompleteness affecting the most crowded regions. From the analysis of the\nradial distributions we do not find any significant evidence of spatial\nsegregation. Some residuals may be present in the external regions where we\nobserve only a small number of stars. This finding is compatible with the short\ndynamical timescale of M13 and represents, to date, one of the few examples of\nfully spatially mixed multiple populations in a massive globular cluster.\n", "  We compute the instanton partition functions of $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs in\nclass $\\mathcal{S}_k$. We obtain this result via orbifolding Dp/D(p-4) brane\nsystems and calculating the partition function of the supersymmetric gauge\ntheory on the worldvolume of $K$ D(p-4) branes. Starting with D5/D1 setups\nprobing a $\\mathbb{Z}_\\ell\\times \\mathbb{Z}_k$ orbifold singularity we obtain\nthe $K$ instanton partition functions of 6d $(1,0)$ theories on $\\mathbb{R}^4\n\\times T^2$ in the presence of orbifold defects on $T^2$ via computing the 2d\nsuperconformal index of the worldvolume theory on $K$ D1 branes wrapping the\n$T^2$. We then reduce our results to the 5d and to the 4d instanton partition\nfunctions. For $k=1$ we check that we reproduce the known elliptic,\ntrigonometric and rational Nekrasov partition functions. Finally, we show that\nthe instanton partition functions of $SU(N)$ quivers in class $\\mathcal{S}_k$\ncan be obtained from the class $\\mathcal{S}$ mother theory partition functions\nwith $SU(kN)$ gauge factors via imposing the `orbifold condition'\n$a_{\\mathcal{A}} \\rightarrow a_A e^{2\\pi i j/k}$ with $\\mathcal{A}=jA$ and\n$A=1,\\dots, N$, $j=1,\\dots, k$ on the Coulomb moduli and the mass parameters.\n", "  We describe a major update to the public GIZMO code. GIZMO has been used in\nsimulations of cosmology; galaxy and star formation and evolution; black hole\naccretion and feedback; proto-stellar disk dynamics and planet formation; fluid\ndynamics and plasma physics; dust-gas dynamics; giant impacts and solid-body\ninteractions; collisionless gravitational dynamics; and more. This release of\nthe public code supports: hydrodynamics (using various mesh-free finite-volume\nGodunov methods or SPH), ideal and non-ideal MHD, anisotropic conduction and\nviscosity, radiative cooling and chemistry, star and black hole formation and\nfeedback, sink particles, dust-gas (aero)-dynamics (with or without magnetic\nfields), elastic/plastic dynamics, arbitrary (gas, stellar, degenerate,\nsolid/liquid material) equations of state, passive scalar/turbulent diffusion,\nlarge-eddy and shearing boxes, self-gravity with fully-adaptive force\nsoftenings, arbitrary cosmological expansion, and on-the-fly group-finding. It\nis massively-parallel with hybrid MPI+OpenMP scaling verified up to >1 million\nthreads. The code is extensively documented, with test problems and tutorials\nprovided for these different physics modules.\n", "  The central goal of crystal engineering is to develop precise control over\nmaterial function \\emph{via} rational design of structure. A particularly\nsuccessful realisation of this paradigm is the example of hybrid improper\nferroelectricity in layered perovskite materials, where cation vacancies and\ncooperative octahedral tilts combine to break inversion symmetry. However, in\nthe more chemically diverse and technologically relevant family of inorganic\nABX$_3$ perovskites, symmetry conspires to render hybrid coupling to polar\ndistortions impossible. In this study, we use group-theoretical analysis to\nuncover a profound enhancement of the number of improper ferroelectric coupling\nschemes available to \\emph{molecular} perovskites. This enhancement arises\nbecause molecular substitution on the A- and/or X-site significantly\ndiversifies the range of distortions possible. Not only do our insights\nrationalise the emergence of polarisation in a number of previously-studied\nmaterials, but we identify the fundamental importance of molecular degrees of\nfreedom at the A-site, which are much more straightforwardly controlled from a\nsynthetic viewpoint than are lattice, charge and orbital degrees of freedom. We\nenvisage that the crystal design principles we develop here will be enable\ntargeted synthesis of a large family of new acentric functional materials.\n", "  In this work, a new structure is suggested for spasing. The presented spaser\nis made up of a graphene nanosphere, which supports localized surface plasmon\nmodes, and a quantum dot array, acting as a gain medium. The gain medium is\npumped by an external laser source. Since all the plasmons are carried on a\ngraphene platform, the structure features coherent surface plasmons with high\nconfinement and large life time. All the structure is analyzed theoretically\nusing full quantum mechanical description. The main advantage of the proposed\nspaser is the simple tuning capability of it by changing graphene Fermi level\nwhich is performed by either chemical doping in the manufacturing time or\nelectrostatic gating. We suggest utilizing the proposed spaser for exciting\ncoherent, long range surface plasmons on a graphene sheet. The near field of\nthe spaser couples to the surface plasmons on graphene sheet and compensates\nthe large momentum mismatch between surface plasmons and photons.\n", "  A necessary element for the predicted topological state in Kondo insulator\nSmB$_6$ is the hybridization gap which opens in this compound at low\ntemperatures. In this work, we present a comparative study of the in-gap\ndensity of states due to Sm vacancies by Raman scattering spectroscopy and heat\ncapacity for samples where the number of Sm vacancies is equal to or below 1 %.\nWe demonstrate that hybridization gap is very sensitive to the presence of Sm\nvacancies. At the amount of vacancies above 1 % the gap fills in with impurity\nstates and low temperature heat capacity is enhanced.\n", "  We describe a self-contained procedure to evaluate the free energy of liquid\nand solid phases of an alloy system. The free energy of a single-element solid\nphase is calculated with thermodynamic integration using the Einstein crystal\nas the reference system. Then, free energy difference between the solid and\nliquid phases is calculated by Gibbs-Duhem integration. The central part of our\nmethod is the construction of a reversible alchemical path connecting a pure\nliquid and a liquid alloy to calculate the mixing enthalpy and entropy. We have\napplied the method to calculate the free energy of solid and liquid phases in\nthe Al-Sm system. The driving force for fcc-Al nucleation in Al-Sm liquid and\nthe melting curve for fcc-Al and Al3Sm are also calculated.\n", "  Exotic charmonium-like states have been targeted by various experiments in\nthe last 15 years, but their nature still is unknown. Photo-(muo)production is\na new promising instrument to study them. COMPASS, a fixed target experiment at\nCERN, analyzed the full set of the data collected with a muon beam between 2002\nand 2011, covering the range from 7 GeV to 19 GeV in the centre-of-mass energy\nof the (virtual)photon-nucleon system. Production of the X(3872) state in the\nreaction $\\mu^+~N \\rightarrow \\mu^+(J/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^- )\\pi^{\\pm} N'$ has been\nobserved with a statistical significance of around 5 $\\sigma$. The shape of the\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$ mass distribution from the decay $X(3872)\\rightarrow\nJ/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-$ shows disagreement with previous observations. The product of\nthe cross section and the branching fraction of the $X(3872)$ decay into\n$J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ is estimated as 71$\\pm$28(stat)$\\pm$39(syst) pb. The results\nobtained for the production of the $Z_c^{\\pm}(3900)$ are also reported as well\nas future perspectives.\n", "  This short paper presents an efficient implementation of\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for calculating the logarithm of product of\ntwo possibly non-commutative Lie group elements using only Lie algebra terms.\n", "  Quantum Fourier transformation is important in many quantum algorithms. In\nthis paper, we generalize quantum Fourier transformation over the Abelian group\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ from two different points to get more efficient unitary\ntransformations. The obtained unitary transformations are given in concise and\nexplicit formula which can be used directly. A relationship between the\ngeneralized quantum Fourier transformation and the dihedral hidden subgroup\nproblem are discussed in this paper. This may lead a way to solve the dihedral\nhidden subgroup problem. The second goal of this paper is to give an explicit\nformula of quantum Haar transformation.\n", "  The mechanical behavior of magnetoelectric transducers consisting of\npiezoelectric-magnetostrictive bilayers has been modeled. The effect of the\naspect ratio of the transducer as well as the influence of non-active\nsurrounding layers has been modeled, including a passivation layer surrounding\nthe active device, a clamping layer above the active device, and an interfacial\nlayer that might be inserted between the magnetostrictive and the piezoelectric\nlayers. Strategies to control and maximize the strain magnitude and orientation\nbased on material selection and device design are proposed.\n", "  Applications of quantum science to computing, cryptography and imaging are on\ntheir way to becoming key next generation technologies. Owing to the high-speed\ntransmission and exceptional noise properties of photons, quantum photonic\narchitectures are likely to play a central role. A long-standing hurdle,\nhowever, has been the realization of robust, device-compatible single photon\nsources that can be activated and controlled on demand. Here we use strain\nengineering to create large arrays of quantum emitters in two-dimensional\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The large energy gap inherent to this Van der\nWaals material stabilizes the emitters at room temperature within nanoscale\nregions defined by substrate-induced deformation of the flake. Combining\nanalytical and numerical modeling we show that emitter activation is likely the\nresult of carrier trapping in deformation potential wells localized near the\npoints where the hBN flake reaches the highest curvature. These findings,\ntherefore, hint at novel opportunities for the manipulation of single photon\nsources through the combined control of strain and external electrostatic\npotentials under ambient conditions.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a low-cost integrated photonic chip fabricated in\na SOI foundry capable of simultaneously routing and amplifying light in a chip.\nThis device is able to compensate insertion losses in photonic routers. It\nconsists of standard Si/SiO2 ring resonators with Er:Al2O3 as the upper\ncladding layer, employed using only one simple post-processing step. This\nresulted in a measured on/off gain of 0.9 dB, with a footprint smaller than\n0.002 mm2, and expected bit rates as high as 40Gb/s based on the resonance\nquality-factor. We show that the on/off gain value can be further increased\nusing coupled rings to reach net gain values of 4 dB.\n", "  Manipulation of oxygen vacancies (V_O) in single oxide layers by varying the\nelectric field can result in significant modulation of the ground state.\nHowever, in many oxide multilayers with strong application potentials, e.g.\nferroelectric tunnel junctions and solid-oxide fuel cells, understanding V_O\nbehaviour in various layers under an applied electric field remains a\nchallenge, owing to complex V_O transport between different layers. By sweeping\nthe external voltage, a reversible manipulation of V_O and a corresponding\nfixed magnetic phase transition sequence in cobaltite/manganite\n(SrCoO3-x/La0.45Sr0.55MnO3-y) heterostructures are reported. The magnetic phase\ntransition sequence confirms that the priority of electric-field-induced V_O\nformation/annihilation in the complex bilayer system is mainly determined by\nthe V_O formation energies and Gibbs free energy differences, which is\nsupported by theoretical analysis. We not only realize a reversible\nmanipulation of the magnetic phase transition in an oxide bilayer, but also\nprovide insight into the electric field control of V_O engineering in\nheterostructures.\n", "  A representation for the kernel of the transmutation operator relating the\nperturbed Bessel equation with the unperturbed one is obtained in the form of a\nfunctional series with coefficients calculated by a recurrent integration\nprocedure. New properties of the transmutation kernel are established. A new\nrepresentation of the regular solution of the perturbed Bessel equation is\ngiven presenting a remarkable feature of uniform error bound with respect to\nthe spectral parameter for partial sums of the series. A numerical illustration\nof application to the solution of Dirichlet spectral problems is presented.\n", "  We demonstrate fabrication of a high quality factor lithium niobate\ndouble-disk whispering-gallery microcavity using femtosecond laser assisted ion\nbeam milling. Using this method, two vertically stacked 30-um-diameter disks\nwith a 200-nm-gap are fabricated. With our device, an optical quality factor as\nhigh as 1.2*10^5 is demonstrated. Our approach is scalable to fabricate\nmultiple disks on a single chip.\n", "  Starshades are a leading technology to enable the direct detection and\nspectroscopic characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. In an effort to\nadvance starshade technology through system level demonstrations, the\nMcMath-Pierce Solar Telescope was adapted to enable the suppression of\nastronomical sources with a starshade. The long baselines achievable with the\nheliostat provide measurements of starshade performance at a flight-like\nFresnel number and resolution, aspects critical to the validation of optical\nmodels. The heliostat has provided the opportunity to perform the first\nastronomical observations with a starshade and has made science accessible in a\nunique parameter space, high contrast at moderate inner working angles. On-sky\nimages are valuable for developing the experience and tools needed to extract\nscience results from future starshade observations. We report on high contrast\nobservations of nearby stars provided by a starshade. We achieve 5.6e-7\ncontrast at 30 arcseconds inner working angle on the star Vega and provide new\nphotometric constraints on background stars near Vega.\n", "  Irreversibility remains one of the least understood concepts in physics. One\nof the main reasons is the fact that the fundamental laws of classical and\nquantum physics are time symmetric, whereas macroscopic processes evolve in a\npreferred time direction. This long-standing conflict of ideas goes to the\nheart of the so-called Loschmidt's paradox. Here, we address this dichotomy\nfrom a Newtonian perspective of the dynamics of the center of mass of a\nmany-body system, which was found to impose constraints on the time evolution.\nWe demonstrate that despite the time symmetric behavior of the microscopic\nconstituents of the system, in many typical cases the external conditions lead\nnaturally to the unidirectional macroscopic time evolution, independent of the\ninternal interactions and how far the system is from equilibrium. We also\nillustrate our findings by direct calculation of the center of mass dynamics\nfor a nonequilibrium steady state system partially free from external influence\nand for a system following the route to equilibrium.\n", "  Silver (Ag) coatings have been widely used in many industry areas due to\ntheir excellent conductivity. However, wider applications of Ag coatings have\nbeen hindered by their poor mechanical properties. In this research, to improve\nthe mechanical performance, Ag-Bi nano-composite coatings were prepared by a\nnovel ionic co-discharge method. A systematic study of the microstructure,\nmechanical properties, electrical conductivity and antibacterial behavior of\nthe resulting coating was performed. The results indicated that after adding an\nappropriate amount of Bi containing solution into the Ag plating solution,\nAg-Bi nano-particles were in-situ formed and distributed uniformly throughout\nthe coating matrix, resulting in a significant improvement in the mechanical\nproperties. The hardness of Ag-Bi coating was increased by 60% compared to that\nof the pure Ag coating. The corrosion resistance of Ag-Bi coatings was also\nenhanced. The outcome of this research may find a broader application in\nelectronics, jewelry, aerospace and other industries.\n", "  Riemannian and contact geometry formalisms are used to study the fundamental\nequation of electromagnetic radiation-like systems, obeying a\nStefan-Boltzmann's-like law. The vanishing of metric determinant is used for\nclassifying what kind of systems can not represent a possible generalization of\nblackbody-like systems. In addition, thermodynamic curvature scalar\n$\\mathcal{R}$ is evaluated for a thermodynamic metric, giving $\\mathcal{R}=0$,\nwhich validates the non-interaction hypothesis stating that the scalar\ncurvature vanishes for non-interacting systems.\n", "  The formation and dynamics of free-surface structures, such as steps or\nterraces and their interplay with the phase separation in the bulk are key\nfeatures of diblock copolymer films. We present a phase-field model with an\nobstacle potential which follows naturally from derivations of the\nOhta-Kawasaki energy functional via self-consistent field theory. The free\nsurface of the film is incorporated into the phase-field model by including a\nthird phase for the void. The resulting model and its sharp interface limit are\nshown to capture the energetics of films with steps in two dimensions. For this\nmodel, we then develop a numerical approach that is capable of resolving the\nlong-time complex free-surface structures that arise in diblock copolymer\nfilms.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a structure for graphene spaser and develop an\nelectrostatic model for quantizing plasmonic modes. Using this model, one can\nanalyze any spaser consisting of graphene in the electrostatic regime. The\nproposed structure is investigated analytically and the spasing condition is\nderived. We show that spasing can occur in some frequencies where the Quality\nfactor of plasmonic modes is higher than some special minimum value. Finally,\nan algorithmic design procedure is proposed, by which one can design the\nstructure for a given frequency. As an example, a spaser with plasmon energy of\n0.1 eV is designed.\n", "  We are reporting a new synthetic strategy to grow large size black phosphorus\n(Black-P) crystals through a ternary clathrate Sn$_{24}$P$_{22-x}$I$_8$, under\nlower synthetic temperature and pressure. The Black-P crystals are found grown\nin situ at the site where the solid clathrate originally resides, which\nsuggests chemical vapor mineralizer does not play a critical role for the\nBlack-P formation. More detailed systematical studies has indicated the P\nvacancies in the framework of ternary clathrate Sn$_{24}$P$_{22-x}$I$_8$ is\nimportant for the subsequent Black-P from phosphorus vapors, and a likely\nVapor-Solid-Solid (VSS) model is responsible for the Black-P crystal growth.\nThe obtained room temperature mobility {\\mu} is ~ 350 $cm^2/Vs$ from Hall\nmeasurements at mechanically-cleaved flake, where noticeable micro-cracks are\nvisible. The obtained high mobility value further suggest the high quality of\nthe Black-P crystals synthesized through this route.\n", "  Diamond cavity optomechanical devices hold great promise for quantum\ntechnology based on coherent coupling between photons, phonons and spins. These\ndevices benefit from the exceptional physical properties of diamond, including\nits low mechanical dissipation and optical absorption. However the nanoscale\ndimensions and mechanical isolation of these devices can make them susceptible\nto thermo-optic instability when operating at the high intracavity field\nstrengths needed to realize coherent photon--phonon coupling. In this work, we\novercome these effects through engineering of the device geometry, enabling\noperation with large photon numbers in a previously thermally unstable regime\nof red-detuning. We demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency with\ncooperativity > 1 and normal mode cooling from 300 K to 60 K, and predict that\nthese device will enable coherent optomechanical manipulation of diamond spin\nsystems.\n", "  We present a subset of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Gould Belt Survey's\n\"first-look\" results of the southern extent of the Orion A molecular cloud.\nEmploying a two-step structure identification process, we constructed\nindividual catalogues for large-scale regions of significant emission labeled\nas \"islands\" and smaller-scale subregions called \"fragments\" using the 850\n$\\mu$m continuum maps obtained using the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer\nArray 2 (SCUBA-2). We highlight the relationship between the concentration and\nJeans stability for regions of significant emission and present the results of\nan investigation into the spatial distribution of Young Stellar Objects\ndetected using the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory.\nWe find an apparent evolution in the velocity dispersion from Class 0 to Class\nII objects which we derive from comparing our observations to a simple model.\n", "  At the Astrochemistry Focus Group, we discussed what is still missing in our\nunderstanding even with new knowledge given at this conference, and what can be\ndone for that within 10 years from now. Still missing in understanding are\nUV-photons and cosmic-rays interactions with icy dust grains, Sulphur and\nPhosphorus chemistry, Metallicity effect, Duration (time) effect, COM formation\nand destruction, phase transition, dust-gas interface, dust evolution, etc.\nWhat we should do are multi-scale high spectral resolution molecular\nobservations, laboratory work, theory, radiative transfer, etc. We need careful\nmodeling without simplifying things. Next, I introduce our research on Planck\ncold clumps. We observed thirteen Planck cold clumps with the James Clerk\nMaxwell Telescope/SCUBA-2 and with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope. The\nN$_2$H$^+$ distribution obtained with the Nobeyama telescope is quite similar\nto SCUBA-2 dust distribution. The 82 GHz HC$_3$N, 82 GHz CCS, and 94 GHz CCS\nemission are often distributed differently with respect to the N$_2$H$^+$\nemission. The CCS emission, which is known to be abundant in starless molecular\ncloud cores, is often very clumpy in the observed targets. We made deep\nsingle-pointing observations in DNC, HN$^{13}$C, N$_2$D$^+$, cyclic C$_3$H$_2$\ntoward nine clumps. The detection rate of N$_2$D$^+$ is 50\\%. In two of the\nstarless clumps observe, the CCS emission is distributed as it surrounds the\nN$_2$H$^+$ core (chemically evolved gas), which resembles the case of L1544, a\nprestellar core showing collapse. In addition, we detected both DNC and\nN$_2$D$^+$. These two clumps are most likely on the verge of star formation. We\nintroduce the Chemical Evolution Factor (CEF) for starless cores to describe\nthe chemical evolutionary stage, and analyze the observed Planck cold clumps.\n", "  We define some of the programming and system-level challenges facing the\napplication of quantum processing to high-performance computing. Alongside\nbarriers to physical integration, prominent differences in the execution of\nquantum and conventional programs challenges the intersection of these\ncomputational models. Following a brief overview of the state of the art, we\ndiscuss recent advances in programming and execution models for hybrid\nquantum-classical computing. We discuss a novel quantum-accelerator framework\nthat uses specialized kernels to offload select workloads while integrating\nwith existing computing infrastructure. We elaborate on the role of the host\noperating system to manage these unique accelerator resources, the prospects\nfor deploying quantum modules, and the requirements placed on the language\nhierarchy connecting these different system components. We draw on recent\nadvances in the modeling and simulation of quantum computing systems with the\ndevelopment of architectures for hybrid high-performance computing systems and\nthe realization of software stacks for controlling quantum devices. Finally, we\npresent simulation results that describe the expected system-level behavior of\nhigh-performance computing systems composed from compute nodes with quantum\nprocessing units. We describe performance for these hybrid systems in terms of\ntime-to-solution, accuracy, and energy consumption, and we use simple\napplication examples to estimate the performance advantage of quantum\nacceleration.\n", "  Recollect that Heron's formula for the area of a triangle given its sides has\na counterpart given the medians instead, which carries an extra factor of\n$\\frac{4}{3}$. On the one hand, we formulate the pair of these in Linear\nAlgebra terms, showing that they are related by a sides-to-medians involution\n$J$, which we find to furthermore commute with the `Heron map' $H$ as visible\nin the expanded version of Heron. Upon further casting the pair of these in\nterms of mass-weighted Jacobi coordinates, we find moreover that they are\nplaced on an exactly equal footing, the factor of $\\frac{4}{3}$ having now\ncancelled out. This motivates the `Heron--Jacobi' version of Heron's formulae,\nfor mass-weighted area in terms of mass-weighted sides and mass-weighted\nmedians respectively.\n  On the other hand, we show that diagonalizing the Heron map $H$ provides new\nderivations of, firstly, the famous Hopf map, and, secondly, of Kendall's\nTheorem that the space of triangles is a sphere. This occurs by the\n`Heron--Hopf' version of Heron's formula simplifying down to none other than\nthe on-sphere condition. Thus we establish that -- both an important fibre\nbundle model, and a foundational theorem of Shape Theory: a widely applicable\nDifferential Geometry and Topology topic -- arise together as consequences of\njust Heron's formula, Stewart's Theorem, and some elementary Linear Algebra\nmanipulations. This working also accounts for the extra factor of 4 in the Hopf\ncoordinate that is elsewise equal to the mass-weighted area in the 3-body\nproblem context. It finally offers a new interpretation of the shape-theoretic\nellipticity and anisoscelesness which realize the other two Hopf quantities: as\neigenvectors shared by the Heron map $H$ and the sides-to-medians involution\n$J$.\n", "  There is growing evidence for disk-mediated accretion being the dominant mode\nof star formation across nearly the whole stellar mass spectrum. The stochastic\nnature of this process has been realized which implies an inherent source\nvariability. It can be traced more easily for low-mass YSOs (LMYSOs) since\nhigh-mass YSOs (HMYSOs) are still embedded even when reaching the ZAMS. While\nvariable reflection nebulae around LMYSOs were among the earliest signs of star\nformation, little is known on the variability of scattered light from embedded\nclusters, the birthplaces of HMYSOs. Since the few most massive stars dominate\nthis emission, their variability is literally reflected in scattered light.\nMoreover, because of their high luminosity, for a given ambient dust density\nand source distance, the associated nebulosities are much larger than those of\nLMYSOs. In this case, the light travel time becomes substantial. So the\napparent brightness distribution constitutes a light echo, shaped by both the\nHMYSO variability history and the spatial distribution of the scattering\nmedium. We report on early results of a NIR variability study of HMYSOs\nassociated with Class II methanol masers which aims at revealing a possible\ncorrelation between maser flux density and infrared brightness. Additionally,\nrelevant findings for the eruptive HMYSO S255IR-NIRS3 are presented.\n", "  A brief overview of recent advances in the study of star formation in the\nGalactic Center (GC) environment is presented. Particular attention is paid to\nnew insights concerning the suppression of star formation in GC molecular\nclouds. Another focus is the question whether the GC can be used as a template\nfor the understanding of starburst galaxies in the nearby and distant universe:\nthis must be done with care. Some of the particular conditions in the center of\nthe Milky Way do not necessarily play a role in starburst galaxies.\n", "  Star cluster formation is unlikely to be a sudden event: instead, matter will\nflow to a cluster's formation site over an extended period, even as stars form\nand inject energy to the region. A cluster's gaseous precursor must persist\nunder the competing influences of accretion and feedback for several crossing\ntimes, insofar as star formation is a slow process. The new-born stellar\ncluster should therefore preserve a memory of this competition. Using\nanalytical approximations we assess the dynamical state of the gas, mapping\nregimes in which various types of feedback are weak or strong. Protostellar\noutflows, radiation pressure, and ionized gas pressure are accounted for.\nComparison to observations shows that feedback is often incapable of expelling\ngas in the more massive, rapidly-accreting clusters, but feedback may\nnevertheless starve accretion by acting on larger scales.\n", "  The formation and evolution of cold diffuse clouds (CDCs), the parent objects\nof dense molecular clouds, affects both the star formation process and that of\nlarger-scale galactic evolution. We have begun a pilot study of one CDC's dust\ncontent, with the goal of quantifying the abundances of different types of dust\nand relating these to the relative abundance of molecular gas, the cloud's\nphysical properties, and its general stage of development. Using photometry\nfrom AKARI and other surveys, we have extracted a sample spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the CDC dust thermal emission over the near-infrared to\nsubmillimeter range. The extracted SED closely resembles others in the\nliterature, confirming our isolation of the cloud emission from other sources\nalong the sight line. We plan to fit this SED with dust models at each position\nin the cloud, automating our procedure to map out the structure of this CDC and\nothers.\n", "  The approximate solution of Bohr-Mottelson Hamiltonian in rigid deformed\nnucleus case for Hulthen potential with minimal length effect was investigated\nusing Asymptotic Iteration Method. Asymptotic Iteration Method was used to\nsolve approximately the Bohr-Mottelson Hamiltonian to obtain energy spectrum\nand un-normalized wave function. The energy spectrum was calculated numerically\nusing the Matlab software. The un-normalized wave function was expressed in the\nhypergeometric term. The results showed that the energy spectrum increased due\nto the increasing minimal length parameter. The energy spectrum also increased\nby the increasing range of potential.\n", "  Dirac semimetal (DSM) hosts four-fold degenerate isolated band-crossing\npoints with linear dispersion, around which the quasiparticles resemble the\nrelativistic Dirac Fermions. It can be described by a 4 * 4 massless Dirac\nHamiltonian which can be decomposed into a pair of Weyl points or gaped into an\ninsulator. Thus, crystal symmetry is critical to guarantee the stable\nexistence. On the contrary, by breaking crystal symmetry, a DSM may transform\ninto a Weyl semimetal (WSM) or a topological insulator (TI). Here, by taking\nhexagonal LiAuSe as an example, we find that it is a starfruit shaped multiple\nnodal chain semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling(SOC). In the\npresence of SOC, it is an ideal DSM naturally with the Dirac points locating at\nFermi level exactly, and it would transform into WSM phase by introducing\nexternal Zeeman field or by magnetic doping with rare-earth atom Sm. It could\nalso transform into TI state by breaking rotational symmetry. Our studies show\nthat DSM is a critical point for topological phase transition, and the\nconclusion can apply to most of the DSM materials, not limited to the hexagonal\nmaterial LiAuSe.\n", "  In this paper we report the effect of hydrogen on the structural properties\nof AISI-H13 steel nitrogen-implanted samples in low oxygen partial pressure\natmosphere. The samples were implanted in a high vacuum chamber by using a\nbroad ion beam source. The H2+/N2+ ion composition of the beam was varied and\nthe surface composition studied in situ by photoemission electron spectroscopy\n(XPS). The samples were also ex situ analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM), including energy-dispersive spectroscopy\nmeasurements. It was found that hydrogen has the effect of modifying the amount\nof retained nitrogen at the surfaces. This result shows that hydrogen plays a\nrole beyond the well-established effect of oxygen etching in industrial\nmachines where vacuum is relatively less well controlled. Finally, an optimum\nconcentration of 20 to 40% [H2]/[H2+N2] ion beam composition was determined to\nobtain maximum nitrogen incorporation on the metal surface.\n", "  We investigate implementation of lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) code on\nthe Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing (KNL). The most time consuming part of the\nnumerical simulations of lattice QCD is a solver of linear equation for a large\nsparse matrix that represents the strong interaction among quarks. To establish\nwidely applicable prescriptions, we examine rather general methods for the SIMD\narchitecture of KNL, such as using intrinsics and manual prefetching, to the\nmatrix multiplication and iterative solver algorithms. Based on the performance\nmeasured on the Oakforest-PACS system, we discuss the performance tuning on KNL\nas well as the code design for facilitating such tuning on SIMD architecture\nand massively parallel machines.\n", "  Electron tracking based Compton imaging is a key technique to improve the\nsensitivity of Compton cameras by measuring the initial direction of recoiled\nelectrons. To realize this technique in semiconductor Compton cameras, we\npropose a new detector concept, Si-CMOS hybrid detector. It is a Si detector\nbump-bonded to a CMOS readout integrated circuit to obtain electron trajectory\nimages. To acquire the energy and the event timing, signals from N-side are\nalso read out in this concept. By using an ASIC for the N-side readout, the\ntiming resolution of few us is achieved. In this paper, we present the results\nof two prototypes with 20 um pitch pixels. The images of the recoiled electron\ntrajectories are obtained with them successfully. The energy resolutions (FWHM)\nare 4.1 keV (CMOS) and 1.4 keV (N-side) at 59.5 keV. In addition, we confirmed\nthat the initial direction of the electron is determined using the\nreconstruction algorithm based on the graph theory approach. These results show\nthat Si-CMOS hybrid detectors can be used for electron tracking based Compton\nimaging.\n", "  We present a practical method to obtain bounds for the oscillation minima and\nmaxima of large classes of biochemical oscillator models that generate\noscillations through a negative feedback. These bounds depend on the feedback\nnonlinearity and are independent of explicit or effective feedback delays. For\nspecific systems, we obtain explicit analytical expressions for the bounds and\ndemonstrate their effectiveness in comparison with numerical simulations.\n", "  Advance designs of random lasers towards development of miniature laser\nsystems are in demand. We demonstrated random lasing from Rhodamine-B dye\nattached to polystyrene micro-spheres. Bare polystyrene spheres were used as\nscatterers and these provided optical feedback to the gain. Random lasing was\nsuccessfully demonstrated in two different disordered environments, in binary\ncolloidal mixture solution and in photonic glass. Incoherent feedback occurred\nin both the cases and single wavelength lasing were obtained. The lasing\nthreshold in case of photonic glass was lower in comparison to binary colloidal\nmixture solution. This was because of higher index contrast and larger filling\nfraction of micro-particles in case of photonic glass. Longer fluorescence\nlifetime of embedded dye was observed in photonic glass environment in\ncomparison to ethanolic solution of the Rhodamine-B dye. Lasing results\nobtained for photonic glass were compared with our previous results of Bloch\nlasing in photonic crystal synthesized using similar dye doped polystyrene\nmicro-spheres.\n", "  Ionization of an atom or molecule by a strong laser field produces\nsub-optical cycle wave packets whose control has given rise to attosecond\nscience. The final states of the wave packets depend on ionization and\ndeflection by the laser field, which are convoluted in conventional\nexperiments. Here, we demonstrate a technique enabling efficient electron\ndeflection, separate from the field driving strong-field ionization. Using a\nmid-infrared deflection field permits one to distinguish electron wave packets\ngenerated at different field maxima of an intense few-cycle visible laser\npulse. We utilize this capability to trace the scattering of low-energy\nelectrons driven by the mid-infrared field. Our approach represents a general\ntechnique for studying and controlling strong-field ionization dynamics on the\nattosecond time scale.\n", "  We have performed $^{27}$Al-NMR measurements on single-crystalline\nUPd$_2$Al$_3$ with the field parallel to the $c$ axis to investigate the\nsuperconducting (SC) properties near the upper critical field of\nsuperconductivity $H_{\\rm c2}$. The broadening of the NMR linewidth below 14~K\nindicates the appearance of the internal field at the Al site, which originates\nfrom the antiferromagnetically ordered moments of U 5$f$ electrons. In the SC\nstate well below $\\mu_0H_{\\rm c2}$ = 3.4~T, the broadening of the NMR linewidth\ndue to the SC diamagnetism and a decrease in the Knight shift are observed,\nwhich are well-understood by the framework of spin-singlet superconductivity.\nIn contrast, the Knight shift does not change below $T_{\\rm c}(H)$, and the NMR\nspectrum is broadened symmetrically in the SC state in the field range of 3~T\n$< \\mu_0 H < \\mu_0 H_{\\rm c2}$. The unusual NMR spectrum near $H_{\\rm c2}$\nsuggests that a spatially inhomogeneous SC state such as the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state would be realized.\n", "  The work shows that a single elongated island immersed in the quasi-neutral\ncurrent sheet makes it MHD unstable. Typical values of growth rate are found to\nbe several per cent of inverse Alfven time for broad sheets. Hall dynamics\ngreatly enhance instability and growth rate reaches one-tenth of ion cyclotron\nfrequency when sheet width is comparable to ion inertia length. A weak\nsquare-root dependence of increment on island width and length is derived both\nfrom numerical simulation and analytical analysis. At the non-linear phase of\nevolution a phenomenon of fast impulsive intensification of current is found.\nAfter finite time of about 10 ion-cyclotron periods it ends by a collapse of\nthe sheet. It is shown that Hall dynamics is responsible for such a behaviour.\nPossible implications for magnetotail substorms are discussed.\n", "  C-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN), existing in the two $Z$ and $E$ isomeric forms,\nis a key prebiotic molecule, but, so far, only the $E$ isomer has been detected\ntoward the massive star-forming region. Sagittarius B2(N) using transitions in\nthe radio wavelength domain. With the aim of detecting HNCHCN in Sun-like-star\nforming regions, the laboratory investigation of its rotational spectrum has\nbeen extended to the millimeter-/submillimeter-wave (mm-/submm-) spectral\nwindow in which several unbiased spectral surveys have been already carried\nout. High-resolution laboratory measurements of the rotational spectrum of\nC-cyanomethanimine were carried out in the 100-420 GHz range using a\nfrequency-modulation absorption spectrometer. We then searched for the\nC-cyanomethanimine spectral features in the mm-wave range using the\nhigh-sensitivity and unbiased spectral surveys obtained with the IRAM 30-m\nantenna in the ASAI context, the earliest stages of star formation from\nstarless to evolved Class I objects being sampled. For both the $Z$ and $E$\nisomers, the spectroscopic work has led to an improved and extended knowledge\nof the spectroscopic parameters, thus providing accurate predictions of the\nrotational signatures up to $\\sim$700 GHz. So far, no C-cyanomethanimine\nemission has been detected toward the ASAI targets, and upper limits of the\ncolumn density of $\\sim$ 10$^{11}$--10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ could only be derived.\nConsequently, the C-cyanomethanimine abundances have to be less than a few\n10$^{-10}$ for starless and hot-corinos. A less stringent constraint, $\\leq$\n10$^{-9}$, is obtained for shocks sites. The combination of the upper limits of\nthe abundances of C-cyanomethanimine together with accurate laboratory\nfrequencies up to $\\sim$ 700 GHz poses the basis for future higher sensitivity\nsearches around Sun-like-star forming regions.\n", "  The response of conduction band electrons to a local, pulse-like external\nexcitation is investigated. The charge density wave packets that emerge as a\nconsequence of the excitation leave the interaction region with a speed close\nto the initial state's band velocity, but there are also oscillations with\nessentially the same frequency as that of the laser field. As a good\nestimation, the excitation can also be considered as a localized,\ntime-dependent ponderomotive potential, leading to slowly varying current\noscillations. The role of all these effects are investigated for different\nelectron energies, carrier frequencies and sizes of the interaction area.\n", "  In this work we discuss an analytic bootstrap approach [1,2] in the context\nof spinning 4D conformal blocks [3,4]. As an example we study the simplest\nspinning case, the scalar-fermion correlator\n$\\langle\\phi\\psi\\phi\\bar\\psi\\rangle$. We find that to every pair of primary\nscalar $\\phi$ and fermion $\\psi$ correspond two infinite towers of fermionic\nlarge spin primary operators. We compute their twists and products of OPE\ncoefficients using both s-t and u-t bootstrap equations to the leading and\nsub-leading orders. We find that the leading order is represented by the\nscalar-fermion generalized free theory and the sub-leading order is governed by\nthe minimal twist bosonic (light scalars, currents and the energy-momentum\ntensor) and fermionic (light fermions and the suppersymmetric current)\noperators present in the spectrum.\n", "  In this paper we address the question how the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which\ndescribes the formation of topological defects in quantum systems subjected to\na quench across a critical point, is generalized to the same scenario but for\ndriven-dissipative quantum critical systems. In these out of equilibrium\nsystems, the critical behavior is manifested in the steady states rather than\nin the ground states as in quantum critical models of closed systems. To give\nthe generalization we need to establish what is meant by adiabaticity in open\nquantum systems. Another most crucial concept that we clarify is the\ncharacterization of non-adiabatic excitations. It is clear what these are for a\nHamiltonian systems, but question is more subtle for driven-dissipative\nsystems. In particular, the important observation is that the instantaneous\nsteady states serve as reference states. From these the excitations can then be\nextracted by comparing the distance from the evolved state to the instantaneous\nsteady state. With these issues resolved we demonstrate the applicability of\nthe generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism to an open Landau-Zener problem and show\nuniversal Kibble-Zurek scaling for an open transverse Ising model. Thus, our\nresults support any assumption that non-equilibrium quantum critical behavior\ncan be understood from universal features.\n", "  The exact solution for a small falling drop is a classical result by Hadamard\nand Rybczynski. But experiments show that small drops fall slower than\npredicted, giving closer agreement with Stokes' result for a falling hard\nsphere. Increasing the drop size, a transition between these two extremes is\nfound. This is due to surfactants present in the system, and previous work has\nled to the stagnant-cap model. We present here an alternative approach which we\ncall the continuous-interface model. In contrast to the stagnant-cap model, we\ndo not consider a surfactant advection-diffusion equation at the interface.\nTaking instead the normal and tangential interfacial stresses into account, we\nsolve the Stokes equation analytically for the falling drop with varying\ninterfacial tension. Some of the solutions thus obtained, e.g. the hovering\ndrop, violate conservation ofenergy unless energy is provided directly to the\ninterface. Considering the energy budget of the drop, we show that the terminal\nvelocity is bounded by the Stokes and the Hadamard-Rybczynski results. The\ncontinuous-interface model is then obtained from the force balance for\nsurfactants at the interface. The resulting expressions gives the transition\nbetween the two extremes, and also predicts that the critical radius, below\nwhich drops fall like hard spheres, is proportional to the interfacial\nsurfactant concentration. By analysing experimental results from the\nliterature, we confirm this prediction, thus providing strong arguments for the\nvalidity of the proposed model.\n", "  The strong coupling constants of negative parity heavy baryons belonging to a\nsextet and antitriplet representations of $SU_f(3)$ with light $\\pi$ and $K$\nmesons are estimated within the light cone QCD sum rules. It is observed that\neach class of the sextet-sextet, sextet-antitriplet, and\nantitriplet-antitriplet transitions can be described by only one corresponding\nfunction. The pollutions arising from the positive to positive, positive to\nnegative, and negative to positive parity baryons transitions are eliminated by\nconstructing sum rules for different Lorentz structures. The obtained coupling\nconstants are compared with the ones for the positive parity heavy baryons.\n", "  The generation of electrical power from Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of a\ncylinder is investigated numerically. The cylinder is free to oscillate in the\ndirection transverse to the incoming flow. The cylinder is attached to a magnet\nthat can move along the axis of a coil made from conducting wire. The magnet\nand the coil together constitute a basic electrical generator. When the\ncylinder undergoes VIV, the motion of the magnet creates a voltage across the\ncoil, which is connected to a resistive load. By Lenz's law, induced current in\nthe coil applies a retarding force to the magnet. Effectively, the electrical\ngenerator applies a damping force on the cylinder with a spatially varying\ndamping coefficient. For the initial investigation reported here, the Reynolds\nnumber is restricted to Re < 200, so that the flow is laminar and\ntwo-dimensional (2D). The incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations are solved\nusing an extensively validated spectral-element based solver. The effects of\nthe electromagnetic (EM) damping constant xi_m, coil dimensions (radius a,\nlength L), and mass ratio on the electrical power extracted are quantified. It\nis found that there is an optimal value of xi_m (xi_opt) at which maximum\nelectrical power is generated. As the radius or length of the coil is\nincreased, the value of xi_opt is observed to increase. Although the maximum\naverage power remains the same, a larger coil radius or length results in a\nmore robust system in the sense that a relatively large amount of power can be\nextracted when xi_m is far from xi_opt, unlike the constant damping ratio case.\nThe average power output is also a function of Reynolds number, primarily\nthrough the increased maximum oscillation amplitude that occurs with increased\nReynolds number at least within the laminar range, although the general\nqualitative findings seem likely to carry across to high Reynolds number VIV.\n", "  Portable electronic devices are already an indispensable part of our daily\nlife; and their increasing number and demand for higher performance is becoming\na challenge for the research community. In particular, a major concern is the\nway to efficiently power these energy-demanding devices, assuring long grid\nindependency with high efficiency, sustainability and cheap production. In this\ncontext, technologies beyond Li-ion are receiving increasing attention, among\nwhich the development of micro solid oxide fuel cells ({\\mu}SOFC) stands out.\nIn particular, {\\mu}SOFC provides a high energy density, high efficiency and\nopens the possibility to the use of different fuels, such as hydrocarbons. Yet,\nits high operating temperature has typically hindered its application as\nminiaturized portable device. Recent advances have however set a completely new\nrange of lower operating temperatures, i.e. 350-450C, as compared to the\ntypical >900C needed for classical bulk SOFC systems. In this work, a\ncomprehensive review of the status of the technology is presented. The main\nachievements, as well as the most important challenges still pending are\ndiscussed, regarding (i.) the cell design and microfabrication, and (ii.) the\nintegration of functional electrolyte and electrode materials. To conclude, the\ndifferent strategies foreseen for a wide deployment of the technology as new\nportable power source are underlined.\n", "  In this work we have assumed a Hernquist model with an inside-out formation\nfor the Galactic bulge and, using a chemical evolution model, we were able\nobtain the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) for different radial\nregions. The preliminary results show that in the inner regions of the bulge\nthe MDF has a higher fraction of metal poor stars, while this fraction is\nprogressively diminished as moving outwards in the bulge. These results may\nexplain the metallicity gradient observed in the Galactic bulge.\n", "  The possibility of laboratory X-ray reflectometry study of the structure of\ndimyristoyl phosphatidylserine (DMPS) phospholipid monolayers on the water\nsurface in various phase states has been demonstrated.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that the introduction of a rail, a small height\nconstriction, within the cross-section of a rectangular channel could be used\nas a robust passive sorting device in two-phase fluid flows. Single air bubbles\ncarried within silicone oil are generally transported on one side of the rail.\nHowever, for flow rates marginally larger than a critical value, a narrow band\nof bubble sizes can propagate (stably) over the rail, while bubbles of other\nsizes segregate to the side of the rail. The width of this band of bubble sizes\nincreases with flow rate and the size of the most stable bubble can be tuned by\nvarying the rail width. We present a complementary theoretical analysis based\non a depth-averaged theory, which is in qualitative agreement with the\nexperiments. The theoretical study reveals that the mechanism relies on a\nnon-trivial interaction between capillary and viscous forces that is fully\ndynamic, rather than being a simple modification of capillary static solutions.\n", "  The influence of the physical mechanisms activated during deformation and\nannealing on the microstructure and texture evolution as well as on the\nmechanical properties in the equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA)\nwere investigated. A combination of cold rolling and annealing was used to\ninvestigate the HEA in the deformed, recovered, partially recrystallized, and\nfully recrystallized states. Detailed microstructure and texture analysis was\nperformed by electron backscatter diffraction, transmission electron\nmicroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The mechanical properties were evaluated\nusing uniaxial tensile testing. A specific focus of this investigation was put\non studying the influence of deformation and annealing twinning on the material\nbehavior. It was substantiated that during cold rolling deformation, twinning\nfacilitates the transition from the Cu-type to the Brass-type texture, whereas\nannealing-twinning leads to a strong modification of the texture formed during\nrecrystallization. The formation of specific twin orientations and the\nrandomization of the recrystallization texture were proven by experiments as\nwell as by cellular automaton simulations. During tension of the cold-rolled\nand annealed material high work-hardenability was observed. We attribute this\nbehavior primarily to the dominance of planar dislocation slip and reduced\ntendency for dynamic recovery, since deformation twinning was observed to\nactivate only in the non-recrystallized grains and thus, contributed minimally\nto the overall plasticity. The correlation between deformation/annealing\ntwinning and the material behavior was discussed in detail.\n", "  We describe and discuss solutions for an innovating sub-relativistic electron\nsource, based on pulsed DC gun, including linear (1D) Field Emitter Array (FEA)\nassociated immediately with Laser Dielectric Accelerator (DLA) stage. That\nsetup is designed to avoid any standard accelerator component (electrostatic or\nmagnetic macroscopic dipole ...) Parts of the diagnostics, including\nspectrometer and all diagnostics, are planned to rely on nano-structures. Then\nthe entire setup -pulsed source, laser and measurements ends excepted- should\nbe enclosed inside a decimeter range vacuum chamber. The goal of that paper is\nto suggest experimental orientations, which are discussed inside our\nlaboratory.\n  However we shall also notice the theoretical issues among which we actually\nwork, these one could be presented in a next work.\n", "  The SM-like Higgs pair productions are discussed in the framework of the\ngeneral CP-violating two-Higgs-doublet model, where we find the CP-violating\nmixing angles can be related to the Higgs self couplings. Therefore, the future\nexperimental searches for Higgs boson pairs can be constrained by the improved\nprecision of the electric dipole moment measurements. Based on a series\nconstraints of the SM-like Higgs boson signal fits, the perturbative unitarity\nand stability bounds to the Higgs potential, and the most recent LHC searches\nfor the heavy Higgs bosons, we suggest a set of benchmark models for the future\nhigh-energy collider searches for the Higgs pair productions. The $e^+ e^-$\ncolliders operating at $\\sqrt{s}=$ (500 GeV, 1 TeV) are capable of measuring\nthe Higgs cubic self couplings of the benchmark models directly. We also\nestimate the cross sections of the resonance contributions to the Higgs pair\nproductions for the benchmark models at the future LHC and SppC/Fcc-hh runs.\n", "  In this report, we demonstrate a new principle to improve the resolution of\nthe acoustic microscopy, which is based on the sub-wavelength focusing of\nacoustic wave passing through an acoustically transparent mesoscale particle.\nIn the principle, the width of the acoustic focal area can be less than one\nwavelength. The sub-wavelength focusing effect is verified by the FEM\nsimulation.\n", "  There have been some significant advances in optical-fiber multimode\ncommunications. And important effort in on-chip communication has also been\nrecently reported for realizing mode-division multiplexing (MDM). Because of\nthe difficulty in lack of mode converter which can freely perform mode\nconverting function among different waveguide modes, flexible on-chip\nmode-division switching communication has been rarely reported. Here we show\nthe first demonstration of mode converter which can convert an arbitrary\nwaveguide mode into any other modes with the help of phase tuning. With that\nmode converter, two flexible on-chip mode-division switching architectures are\nproposed. That architecture is compatible with wavelength-division multiplexing\n(WDM) and can enable further scaling of the on-chip communication bandwidth.\nOur demonstration suggests great potential of mode-divisional switching in the\nvision of fully flexible, dense, on-chip optical networks.\n", "  Correlations, highly important in low--dimensional systems, are known to\ndecrease the plasmon dispersion of two-dimensional electron liquids. Here we\ncalculate the plasmon properties, applying the 'Dynamic Many-Body Theory',\naccounting for correlated two-particle--two-hole fluctuations. These dynamic\ncorrelations are found to significantly lower the plasmon's energy. For the\ndata obtained numerically, we provide an analytic expression that is valid\nacross a wide range both of densities and of wave vectors. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how this can be invoked in determining the actual electron\ndensities from measurements on an AlGaAs quantum well.\n", "  Background: The nuclear many-body system is a strongly correlated quantum\nsystem, posing serious challenges for perturbative approaches starting from\nuncorrelated reference states. The last decade has witnessed considerable\nprogress in the accurate treatment of pairing correlations, one of the major\ncomponents in medium-sized nuclei, reaching accuracies below the 1% level of\nthe correlation energy.\n  Purpose: Development of a quantum many-body method for pairing correlations\nthat is (a) competitive in the 1% error range, and (b) can be systematically\nimproved with a fast (exponential) convergence rate.\n  Method: The present paper capitalizes upon ideas from Richardson-Gaudin\nintegrability. The proposed method is a two-step approach. The first step\nconsists of the optimization of a Richardson-Gaudin ground state as variational\ntrial state. At the second step, the complete set of excited states on top of\nthis Richardson-Gaudin ground state is used as an optimal basis for a\nConfiguration Interaction method in an increasingly large effective Hilbert\nspace.\n  Results: The performance of the variational Richardson-Gaudin (varRG) and\nRichardson-Gaudin Configuration Interaction (RGCI) method is benchmarked\nagainst exact results using an effective $G$-matrix interaction for the Sn\nregion. The varRG already reaches accuracies around the 1% level of the\ncorrelation energies, and the RGCI step sees an additional improvement scaling\nexponentially with the size of the effective Hilbert space.\n  Conclusions: The Richardson-Gaudin models of integrability provide an\noptimized complete basis set for pairing correlations.\n", "  Excited state hydrogen transfer (ESHT) is responsible to various\nphotochemical processes of aromatics including photoprotection of nuclear\nbasis. Its mechanism is explained by the internal conversion from aromatic\n$\\pi$$\\pi$* to $\\pi$$\\sigma$* states via conical intersection. It means that\nthe electron is transferred to a diffuse Rydberg like $\\sigma$* orbital apart\nfrom the proton migration. This picture means the electron and the proton are\nnot move together and its dynamics are different in principle. Here, we have\napplied the picosecond time-resolved near infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR)\nspectroscopies to the phenol--(NH 3) 5 cluster, the bench mark system of ESHT,\nand monitored the electron transfer and proton motion independently. The\nelectron transfer monitored by the NIR transition rises within 3 ps while the\noverall H transfer detected by the IR absorption of NH vibration appears with\nthe lifetime of $\\approx$20 ps. It clearly proves that the electron motion and\nproton migration are decoupled. Such the difference of the time-evolutions\nbetween the NIR absorption and the IR transition has not been detected in the\ncluster with three ammonia molecules. We will report full of our observation\ntogether with theoretical calculations of potential energy surfaces of\n$\\pi$$\\pi$* and $\\pi$$\\sigma$* states, and will discuss the ESHT mechanism and\nits cluster size-dependence between n = 3 and 5. It is suggested that the\npresence and absence of a barrier in the proton transfer coordinate cause the\ndifferent dynamics. 2\n", "  With the volume of manuscripts submitted for publication growing every year,\nthe deficiencies of peer review (e.g. long review times) are becoming more\napparent. Editorial strategies, sets of guidelines designed to speed up the\nprocess and reduce editors workloads, are treated as trade secrets by\npublishing houses and are not shared publicly. To improve the effectiveness of\ntheir strategies, editors in small publishing groups are faced with undertaking\nan iterative trial-and-error approach. We show that Cartesian Genetic\nProgramming, a nature-inspired evolutionary algorithm, can dramatically improve\neditorial strategies. The artificially evolved strategy reduced the duration of\nthe peer review process by 30%, without increasing the pool of reviewers (in\ncomparison to a typical human-developed strategy). Evolutionary computation has\ntypically been used in technological processes or biological ecosystems. Our\nresults demonstrate that genetic programs can improve real-world social systems\nthat are usually much harder to understand and control than physical systems.\n", "  Understanding community structure of social media is critical due to its\nbroad applications such as friend recommendations, user modeling and content\npersonalizations. Existing research uses structural metrics such as modularity\nand conductance and functional metrics such as ground truth to measure the\nqualify of the communities discovered by various community detection\nalgorithms, while overlooking a natural and important dimension, community\nsize. Recently, anthropologist Dunbar suggests that the size of stable\ncommunity in social media should be limited to 150, referred to as Dunbar's\nnumber. In this study, we propose a systematic way of algorithm comparison by\northogonally integrating community size as a new dimension into existing\nstructural metrics for consistently and holistically evaluating the community\nquality in social media context. we design a heuristic clique based algorithm\nwhich controls the size and overlap of communities with adjustable parameters\nand evaluate it along with five state-of-the-art community detection algorithms\non both Twitter network and DBLP network. Specifically, we divide the\ndiscovered communities based on their size into four classes called close\nfriend, casual friend, acquaintance, and just a face, and then calculate the\ncoverage, modularity, triangle participation ratio, conductance, transitivity,\nand the internal density of communities in each class. We discover that\ncommunities in different classes exhibit diverse structural qualities and many\nexisting community detection algorithms tend to output extremely large\ncommunities.\n", "  This paper establishes a framework for the acceleration of quantum gossip\nalgorithms by introducing local clique operations to networks of interconnected\nqubits. Cliques are local structures in complex networks being complete\nsubgraphs. Based on cyclic permutations, clique gossiping leads to collective\nmulti-party qubit interactions. This type of algorithm can be physically\nrealized by a series of local environments using coherent methods. First of\nall, we show that at reduced states, these cliques have the same acceleration\neffects as their roles in accelerating classical gossip algorithms, which can\neven make possible finite-time convergence for suitable network structures.\nNext, for randomized selection of cliques where node updates enjoy a more\nself-organized and scalable sequencing, we show that the rate of convergence is\nprecisely improved by $\\mathcal{O}(k/n)$ at the reduced states, where $k$ is\nthe size of the cliques and $n$ is the number of qubits in the network. The\nrate of convergence at the coherent states of the overall quantum network is\nproven to be decided by the spectrum of a mean-square error evolution matrix.\nExplicit calculation of such matrix is rather challenging, nonetheless, the\neffect of cliques on the coherent states' dynamics is illustrated via numerical\nexamples. Interestingly, the use of larger quantum cliques does not necessarily\nincrease the speed of the network density aggregation, suggesting quantum\nnetwork dynamics is not entirely decided by its classical topology.\n", "  First results of a cosmic-ray electron + positron spectrum, from 10 GeV to 3\nTeV, is presented based upon observations with the CALET instrument on the ISS\nstarting in October, 2015. Nearly a half million electron + positron events are\nincluded in the analysis. CALET is an all-calorimetric instrument with total\nvertical thickness of 30 $X_0$ and a fine imaging capability designed to\nachieve a large proton rejection and excellent energy resolution well into the\nTeV energy region. The observed energy spectrum over 30 GeV can be fit with a\nsingle power law with a spectral index of -3.152 $\\pm$ 0.016 (stat.+ syst.).\nPossible structure observed above 100 GeV requires further investigation with\nincreased statistics and refined data analysis.\n", "  In this Letter, we present a new experimental approach to investigate the\neffective temperature concept as a generalization of the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) for nonequilibrium systems. Simultaneous\nmeasurements of diffusion coefficient and sedimentation velocity of heavy\ncolloids, embedded in a Laponite clay suspension, are performed with a\nfluorescence-recovery-based setup. This nonperturbative dual measurement,\nperformed at a single time in a single sample, allows for a direct application\nof the FDT to the tracer velocity observable. It thus provides a well-defined\nderivation of the effective temperature in this ageing colloidal gel. For a\nwide range of concentrations and ageing times, we report no violation of the\nFDT, with effective temperature agreeing with bath temperature. This result is\nconsistent with recent theoretical predictions on the coupling between the\nvelocity observable and nonequilibrium gels dynamics.\n", "  Several experiments at the electron-proton ($ep$) collider HERA have\ncollected high precision data on the spectrum of leading-proton and\nleading-neutron carrying a large fraction of the proton's energy. In this\npaper, we have analyzed recent experimental data on the production of\nleading-nucleon in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) processes at HERA in the\nframework of a perturbative QCD (pQCD). An approach based on the fractures\nfunctions framework has been used, and the nucleon fracture functions (nucleon\nFFs) ${\\cal M}_2^{(n/p)} (x, Q^2, x_L)$ have been extracted from global QCD\nanalysis of DIS data measured by ZEUS collaboration at HERA. We show that the\napproach of fracture functions formalisem allows us phenomenologically\nparametrize the nucleon FFs at the input scale, $Q_0^2$. Considering\nleading-nucleon production data in the DIS processes, we present the results\nfor the separate parton distributions for all parton species. The extracted\nresults from the $t$-integrated leading-baryon fracture functions, $F_2^{\\rm\nLB(3)} (x, Q^2, x_L)$ are in good agreement with all DIS data analyzed, for a\nwide range of longitudinal momentum fraction $x_L$ as well as scaled fractional\nmomentum variable $x$.\n", "  In this paper the discretized variational principle in the simulation of the\nWall Touching Kink Modes (WTKM) is reformulated in terms of independent\nvariables and a corresponding constrained minimization algorithm is elaborated.\nIn a frame of a general formalism is proposed an algoritm for constrained\nlinear minimization adapted to this class of problems. The FORTRAN programme\nthat realize the algorithm is described.\n", "  We develop an agent-based model to reproduce the size distribution of R\\&D\nalliances of firms. Agents are uniformly selected to initiate an alliance and\nto invite collaboration partners. These decide about acceptance based on an\nindividual threshold that is compared with the utility expected from joining\nthe current alliance. The benefit of alliances results from the fitness of the\nagents involved. Fitness is obtained from an empirical distribution of agent's\nactivities. The cost of an alliance reflects its coordination effort. Two free\nparameters $a_{c}$ and $a_{l}$ scale the costs and the individual threshold. If\ninitiators receive $R$ rejections of invitations, the alliance formation stops\nand another initiator is selected. The three free parameters $(a_{c},a_{l},R)$\nare calibrated against a large scale data set of about 15,000 firms engaging in\nabout 15,000 R\\&D alliances over 26 years. For the validation of the model we\ncompare the empirical size distribution with the theoretical one, using\nconfidence bands, to find a very good agreement. As an asset of our agent-based\nmodel, we provide an analytical solution that allows to reduce the simulation\neffort considerably. The analytical solution applies to general forms of the\nutility of alliances. Hence, the model can be extended to other cases of\nalliance formation. While no information about the initiators of an alliance is\navailable, our results indicate that mostly firms with high fitness are able to\nattract newcomers and to establish larger alliances.\n", "  In August 2015, the CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET), designed for\nlong exposure observations of high energy cosmic rays, docked with the\nInternational Space Station (ISS) and shortly thereafter began tocollect data.\nCALET will measure the cosmic ray electron spectrum over the energy range of 1\nGeV to 20 TeV with a very high resolution of 2% above 100 GeV, based on a\ndedicated instrument incorporating an exceptionally thick 30 radiation-length\ncalorimeter with both total absorption and imaging (TASC and IMC) units. Each\nTASC readout channel must be carefully calibrated over the extremely wide\ndynamic range of CALET that spans six orders of magnitude in order to obtain a\ndegree of calibration accuracy matching the resolution of energy measurements.\nThese calibrations consist of calculating the conversion factors between ADC\nunits and energy deposits, ensuring linearity over each gain range, and\nproviding a seamless transition between neighboring gain ranges. This paper\ndescribes these calibration methods in detail, along with the resulting data\nand associated accuracies. The results presented in this paper show that a\nsufficient accuracy was achieved for the calibrations of each channel in order\nto obtain a suitable resolution over the entire dynamic range of the electron\nspectrum measurement.\n", "  When plotted in linear transformations of the Michaelis-Menten equation, ion\nuptake in plants has been shown to be multiphasic, i.e. to be represented by a\nseries of straight lines separated by discontinuous transitions (Nissen 1971,\n1974, 1991, 1996). Reanalysis of data for other transport, binding and enzyme\nsystems has also given such kinetics (Nissen and Mart\\'in-Nieto 1998).\nRecently, such profiles have been found for a variety of biological as well as\nnon-biological processes and phenomena, including activation of ion channels,\nbinding, pH, folding/unfolding, effects of various interactions and chain\nlength (Nissen 2015a,b, Nissen 2016a-d). These biological and nonbiological\nprocesses have little in common beyond the ions involved. Here I show that the\nmultiphasic property seen in so many systems is present in the fundamental\nphysical properties of the ion themselves.\n  The characteristics of multiphasic profiles have now also been found in\nprofiles for activities of ions in simple inorganic solutions, indicating that\nthey are somehow causing the multiphasic profiles in more complex systems. A\nset of extensive and precise data (Lee et al. 2002) for the activities of the\nbiologically very important ions Na+, K+ and Cl- (in NaCl and KCl) at four\ndifferent temperatures (15, 25, 35 and 45oC) will be reanalyzed in the present\npaper. The activities of NaBr and KBr will be plotted in a forthcoming paper.\nExtensive data for these and other ion activities Wilczek-Vera et al. (2004)\ncan also be precisely represented by multiphasic profiles (in preparation).\n", "  We establish a class of area-angular momentum-charge inequalities satisfied\nby stable marginally outer trapped surfaces in 5-dimensional minimal\nsupergravity which admit a $U(1)^2$ symmetry. A novel feature is the fact that\nsuch surfaces can have the nontrivial topologies $S^1 \\times S^2$ and $L(p,q)$.\nIn addition to two angular momenta, they may be characterized by `dipole\ncharge' as well as electric charge. We show that the unique geometries which\nsaturate the inequalities are the horizon geometries corresponding to extreme\nblack hole solutions. Analogous inequalities which also include contributions\nfrom a positive cosmological constant are also presented.\n", "  High-intensity proton beams impinging on a fixed target or beam dump allow to\nprobe new physics via the production of new weakly-coupled particles in hadron\ndecays. The CERN SPS provides opportunities to do so with the running NA62\nexperiment and the planned SHiP experiment. Reconstruction of kaon decay\nkinematics (beam mode) allows NA62 to probe for the existence of right-handed\nneutrinos and dark photons with masses below 0.45 GeV. Direct reconstruction of\ndisplaced vertices from the decays of new neutral particles (dump mode) will\nallow NA62 and SHiP to probe right-handed neutrinos with masses up to 5 GeV and\nmixings down to several orders of magnitude smaller than current constraints,\nin regions favoured in models which explain at once neutrino masses,\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the finite-size\ndependence of the dynamical properties of a diatomic supercooled liquid. The\nsimplicity of the molecule permits us to access the microsecond time scale. We\nfind that the relaxation time decreases simultaneously with the strength of\ncooperative motions when the size of the system decreases. While the decrease\nof the cooperative motions is in agreement with previous studies, the decrease\nof the relaxation time opposes what has been reported to date in monatomic\nglass formers and in silica. This result suggests the presence of different\ncompeting physical mechanisms in the relaxation process. For very small box\nsizes the relaxation times behavior reverses itself and increases strongly when\nthe box size decreases, thus leading to a nonmonotonic behavior. This result is\nin qualitative agreement with defect and facilitation theories.\n", "  We study the multi-dimensional operator $(H_x\nu)_n=\\sum_{|m-n|=1}u_{m}+f(T^n(x))u_n$, where $T$ is the shift of the torus\n$\\T^d$. When $d=2$, we show the spectrum of $H_x$ is almost surely purely\ncontinuous for a.e. $\\alpha$ and generic continuous potentials. When $d\\geq 3$,\nthe same result holds for frequencies under an explicit arithmetic criterion.\nWe also show that general multi-dimensional operators with measurable\npotentials do not have eigenvalue for generic $\\alpha$.\n", "  The structural bifurcation of a 2D divergence free vector field\n$\\mathbf{u}(\\cdot, t)$ when $\\mathbf{u}(\\cdot, t_0)$ has an interior isolated\nsingular point $\\mathbf{x}_0$ of zero index has been studied by Ma and Wang.\nAlthough in the class of divergence free fields which undergo a local\nbifurcation around a singular point, the ones with index zero singular points\nare generic, this class excludes some important families of symmetric flows. In\nparticular, when $\\mathbf{u}(\\cdot, t_0)$ is anti-symmetric with respect to\n$\\mathbf{x}_0$, or symmetric with respect to the axis located on $\\mathbf{x}_0$\nand normal to the unique eigendirection of the Jacobian $D\\mathbf{u}(\\cdot,\nt_0)$, the vector field must have index 1 or -1 at the singular point. Thus we\nstudy the structural bifurcation when $\\mathbf{u}(\\cdot, t_0)$ has an interior\nisolated singular point $\\mathbf{x}_0$ with index -1, 1. In particular we show\nthat if such a vector field with its acceleration at $t_0$ both satisfy\naforementioned symmetries then generically the flow will undergo a local\nbifurcation. Under these generic conditions, we rigorously prove the existence\nof flow patterns such as pairs of co-rotating vortices and double saddle\nconnections. We also present numerical evidence of Stokes flow in a rectangular\nand cylindrical cavity showing that the bifurcation scenarios we present are\nindeed realizable.\n", "  One of the most important features observed in real networks is that, as a\nnetwork's topology evolves so does the network's ability to perform various\ncomplex tasks. To explain this, it has also been observed that as a network\ngrows certain subnetworks begin to specialize the function(s) they perform.\nHere, we introduce a class of models of network growth based on this notion of\nspecialization and show that as a network is specialized using this method its\ntopology becomes increasingly sparse, modular, and hierarchical, each of which\nare important properties observed in real networks. This procedure is also\nhighly flexible in that a network can be specialized over any subset of its\nelements. This flexibility allows those studying specific networks the ability\nto search for mechanisms that describe the growth of these particular networks.\nAs an example, we find that by randomly selecting these elements a network's\ntopology acquires some of the most well-known properties of real networks\nincluding the small-world property, disassortativity, power-law like degree\ndistributions, and power-law like clustering coefficients. As far as the\nauthors know, this is the first such class of models that creates an\nincreasingly modular and hierarchical network topology with these properties.\n", "  We consider spacetimes solving the Einstein non-linear scalar field equations\nwith T2-symmetry and show that they admit an areal time foliation in the\nexpanding direction. In particular, we prove global existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions to the corresponding system of evolution equations for all future\ntimes. The only assumption we have to make is that the potential is a\nnon-negative smooth function.\n  In the special case of a constant potential, a setting which is equivalent to\na linear scalar field on a background with a positive cosmological constant, we\nachieve detailed asymptotic estimates for the different components of the\nspacetime metric. This result holds for all T3-Gowdy symmetric metrics and\nextends to certain T2-symmetric ones satisfying an a priori decay property.\nBuilding upon these asymptotic estimates, we show future causal geodesic\ncompleteness and prove the Cosmic No-Hair conjecture.\n", "  We study the unitary representations of the non-compact real forms of the\ncomplex Lie superalgebra sl(n|m). Among them, only the real form su(p,q|m)\n(p+q=n) admits nontrivial unitary representations, and all such representations\nare of the highest-weight type (or the lowest-weight type). We extend the\nstandard oscillator construction of the unitary representations of non-compact\nLie superalgebras over standard Fock spaces to generalised Fock spaces which\nallows us to define the action of oscillator determinants raised to non-integer\npowers. We prove that the proposed construction yields all the unitary\nrepresentations including those with continuous labels. The unitary\nrepresentations can be diagrammatically represented by non-compact Young\ndiagrams. We apply our general results to the physically important case of\nfour-dimensional conformal superalgebra su(2,2|4) and show how it yields\nreadily its unitary representations including those corresponding to\nsupermultiplets of conformal fields with continuous (anomalous) scaling\ndimensions.\n", "  A method for correcting for detector smearing effects using machine learning\ntechniques is presented. Compared to the standard approaches the method can use\nmore than one reconstructed variable to infere the value of the unsmeared\nquantity on event by event basis. The method is implemented using a sequential\nneural network with a categorical cross entropy as the loss function. It is\ntested on a toy example and is shown to satisfy basic closure tests. Possible\napplication of the method for analysis of the data from high energy physics\nexperiments is discussed.\n", "  We have estimated the performance of discrimination criterion based on the\nP/S spectral amplitude ratios obtained from six underground tests conducted by\nthe DPRK since October 2006 and six aftershocks induced by the last two\nexplosions. Two aftershocks were detected in routine processing at the IDC.\nThree aftershocks were detected by a prototype waveform cross correlation\nprocedure with explosions as master events, and one aftershock was found with\nthe aftershocks as master event. Two seismic arrays USRK and KSRS of the IMS\nand two non-IMS 3-C stations SEHB (South Korea) and MDJ (China) were used. With\nincreasing frequency, all stations demonstrate approximately the same level of\ndeviation between the Pg/Lg spectral amplitude ratios belonging to the DPRK\nexplosions and their aftershocks. For a single station, simple statistical\nestimates show that the probability of any of six aftershocks not to be a\nsample from the explosion population is larger than 99.996% at the KSRS and\neven larger at USRK. The probability of any of the DPRK explosion to be a\nrepresentative of the aftershock population is extremely small as defined by\nthe distance of 20 and more standard deviations to the mean explosion Pg/Lg\nvalue. For network discrimination, we use the Mahalanobis distance combining\nthe Pg/Lg estimates at three stations: USRK, KSRS and MDJ. At frequencies above\n4 Hz, the (squared) Mahalanobis distance, D2, between the populations of\nexplosions and aftershocks is larger than 100. In the frequency band between 6\nand 12 Hz at USRK, the aftershocks distance from the average explosion\nD2>21,000. Statistically, the probability to confuse explosions and aftershocks\nis negligible. These discrimination results are related only to the aftershocks\nof the DPRK tests and cannot be directly extrapolated to the population of\ntectonic earthquakes in the same area.\n", "  The paper includes novel results for the scattering and localisation of a\ntime-harmonic flexural wave by a semi-infinite herringbone waveguide of rigid\npins embedded within an elastic Kirchhoff plate. The analytical model takes\ninto account the orientation and spacing of the constituent parts of the\nherringbone system, and incorporates dipole approximations for the case of\nclosely spaced pins. Illustrative examples are provided, together with the\npredictive theoretical analysis of the localised waveforms.\n", "  The radiolysis of a nitrogen-acetone mixture, condensed at 11 K, by 40 MeV\n$^{58}$Ni$^{11+}$ ions is studied. These results are representative of studies\nconcerning solar system objects exposed to cosmic rays. In the Kuiper Belt,\nregion of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), acetone, molecular nitrogen and other\nsmall molecules were detected and may be present on icy surfaces. Bombardment\nby cosmic rays triggers chemical reactions leading to synthesis of larger\nmolecules. In this work, destruction cross sections of acetone and nitrogen in\nsolid phase are determined from a sequence of infrared spectra obtained at\nincreasing ion beam fluence. The results are analyzed and compared with those\nof previous experiments performed with pure acetone. It is observed that the\nmolecular nitrogen column density decrease very fast, suggesting that nitrogen\nquickly leaves a porous sample under irradiation. The behavior of acetone in\nthe mixture confirms that the ice formed by deposition of vapor mixture is more\nporous than that of pure acetone ice. The most abundant molecular species\nformed from the mixture during irradiation are: C$_3$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_6$, N$_3$,\nCO, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$. Some N-bearing species are also formed, but with low\nproduction yield. Comparing with pure acetone results, it is seen that\ndissolving acetone in nitrogen affects the formation cross sections of the new\nspecies: CH$_4$, CO$_2$ and H$_2$CO, for example, have formation cross section\nsmaller than the respective values for irradiated pure acetone, while those for\nCO and C$_2$H$_6$ species are higher. This fact can explain the presence of\nC$_2$H$_6$ even in regions on Pluto where CH$_4$ is not pure, but diluted in a\nN$_2$ matrix together with less abundant species. These results also show the\nformation of more complex molecules, such as HNCO, acetic acid and,\npossibility, glycine.\n", "  Primordial stars are likely to be very massive >30 Msun, form in isolation,\nand will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of their host dark\nmatter halos. We expect primordial stars to form in halos in the mass range\n10^6-10^10 Msun. Some of these early black holes, formed at redshifts z>10,\ncould be the seed black hole for a significant fraction of the supermassive\nblack holes found in galaxies in the local universe. If the black hole\ndescendants of the primordial stars exist, their mergers with nearby\nsupermassive black holes may be a prime candidate for long wavelength\ngravitational wave detectors. We simulate formation and evolution of dark\nmatter halos in LambdaCDM universe. We seed high-redshift dark matter halos\nwith early black holes, and explore the merger history of the host halos and\nthe implications of black hole's kick velocities arising from their\ncoalescence. The central concentration of low mass early black holes in present\nday galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of km/s.\nEven such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which\nconsequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the low mass\nblack holes that were ejected, compared to those still embedded in their parent\nhalos. Therefore, merger rates with central supermassive black holes in the\nlargest halos may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using\nanalytical and illustrative cosmological N-body simulations, we quantify the\nrole of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal free\nstars with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies.\n", "  A semiclassical theory is developed for the appearance of an excitation gap\nin a ballistic chaotic cavity connected by a point contact to a superconductor.\nDiffraction at the point contact is a singular perturbation in the limit\n$\\hbar\\to 0$, which opens up a gap $E_{\\rm gap}$ in the excitation spectrum.\nThe time scale $\\hbar/E_{\\rm gap}\\propto\\alpha^{-1}\\ln\\hbar$ (with $\\alpha$ the\nLyapunov exponent) is the Ehrenfest time, the characteristic time scale of\nquantum chaos.\n", "  A tunnel barrier in a degenerate electron gas was recently discovered as a\nsource of entangled particle-hole excitations. The entanglement is produced by\nelastic tunneling events, without requiring electron-electron interactions.\nHere we investigate the inverse process, the annihilation of an electron and a\nhole by elastic scattering. We find that this process leads to teleportation of\nthe (unknown) state of the annihilated electron to a second, distant electron\n-- if the latter was previously entangled with the annihilated hole. We propose\nan experiment, involving low-frequency noise measurements on a two-dimensional\nelectron gas in a high magnetic field, to detect teleportation of electrons and\nholes in the two lowest Landau levels.\n", "  Building on a previous proposal for the entanglement of electron-hole pairs\nin the Fermi sea, we show how 3 qubits can be entangled without using\nelectron-electron interactions. As in the 2-qubit case, this electronic scheme\nworks even if the sources are in (local) thermal equilibrium -- in contrast to\nthe photonic analogue. The 3 qubits are represented by 4 edge-channel\nexcitations in the quantum Hall effect (2 hole excitations plus 2 electron\nexcitations with identical channel index). The entangler consists of an\nadiabatic point contact flanked by a pair of tunneling point contacts. The\nirreducible 3-qubit entanglement is characterized by the tangle, which is\nexpressed in terms of the transmission matrices of the tunneling point\ncontacts. The maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is\nobtained for channel-independent tunnel probabilities. We show how\nlow-frequency noise measurements can be used to determine an upper and lower\nbound to the tangle. The bounds become tighter the closer the electron-hole\nstate is to the GHZ state.\n", "  The discovery of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in two-dimensional (2D)\nelectron systems challenged the veracity of one of the most influential\nconjectures in the physics of disordered electrons, which states that `in two\ndimensions, there is no true metallic behaviour'; no matter how weak the\ndisorder, electrons would be trapped and unable to conduct a current. However,\nthat theory did not account for interactions between the electrons. Here we\ninvestigate the interplay between the electron-electron interactions and\ndisorder near the MIT using simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity\nand magnetoconductance. We show that both the resistance and interaction\namplitude exhibit a fan-like spread as the MIT is crossed. From these data we\nconstruct a resistance-interaction flow diagram of the MIT that clearly reveals\na quantum critical point, as predicted by the two-parameter scaling theory\n(Punnoose and Finkel'stein, Science 310, 289 (2005)). The metallic side of this\ndiagram is accurately described by the renormalization group theory without any\nfitting parameters. In particular, the metallic temperature dependence of the\nresistance sets in when the interaction amplitude reaches gamma_2 = 0.45 - a\nvalue in remarkable agreement with the one predicted by the theory.\n", "  We re-examine the problem of the \"Loschmidt echo\", which measures the\nsensitivity to perturbation of quantum chaotic dynamics. The overlap squared\n$M(t)$ of two wave packets evolving under slightly different Hamiltonians is\nshown to have the double-exponential initial decay $\\propto \\exp(-{\\rm\nconstant}\\times e^{2\\lambda_0 t})$ in the main part of phase space. The\ncoefficient $\\lambda_0$ is the self-averaging Lyapunov exponent. The average\ndecay $\\bar{M}\\propto e^{-\\lambda_1 t}$ is single exponential with a different\ncoefficient $\\lambda_1$. The volume of phase space that contributes to\n$\\bar{M}$ vanishes in the classical limit $\\hbar\\to 0$ for times less than the\nEhrenfest time $\\tau_E=\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_0^{-1}|\\ln \\hbar|$. It is only after\nthe Ehrenfest time that the average decay is representative for a typical\ninitial condition.\n"]}
