regime -2 < n < 2. This model is defined on an annulus of aspect ratio\n\\tau. Loops touching the left, right, or both rims of the annulus are\ndistinguished by arbitrary (real) weights which moreover depend on whether they\nwrap the periodic direction. Any value of these weights corresponds to a\nconformally invariant boundary condition. We obtain the exact seven-parameter\npartition function in the continuum limit, as a function of \\tau, by a\ncombination of algebraic and field theoretical arguments. As a specific\napplication we derive some new crossing formulae for percolation clusters.\n", "  The oxygen quenching effect in Linear Alkl Benzne (LAB) based liquid\nscintillator (LAB as the solvent, 3 g/L 2, 5 diphe-nyloxazole (PPO) as the\nfluor and 15 mg/L $p$-bis-($o$-methylstyryl)-benzene (bis-MSB) as the\n$\\lambda$-shifter) is studied by measuring the light yield as the function of\nthe nitrogen bubbling time. It is shown that the light yield of the fully\npurged liquid scintillator is increased by 11% at the room temperature and the\nroom atmosphere pressure. A simple nitrogen bubbling model is proposed to\ndescribe the relationship between the relative light yield (oxygen quenching\nfactor) and the bubbling time.\n", "  When existing, cumulants can provide valuable information about a given\ndistribution and can in principle be used to either fully reconstruct or\napproximate the parent distribution function. A previously reported cumulant\nexpansion approach for Franck-Condon profiles [Faraday Discuss., 150, 363\n(2011)] is extended to describe also the profiles of vibronic transitions that\nare weakly allowed or forbidden in the Franck-Condon approximation (non-Condon\nprofiles). In the harmonic approximation the cumulants of the vibronic spectral\nprofile can be evaluated analytically and numerically with a coherent\nstate-based generating function that accounts for the Duschinsky effect. As\nillustration, the one-photon $1 ^{1}\\mathrm{A_{g}}\\rightarrow1\n^{1}\\mathrm{B_{2u}}$ UV absorption spectrum of benzene in the electric dipole\nand (linear) Herzberg-Teller approximation is presented herein for zero Kelvin\nand finite temperatures.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the scattering of two $\\phi^6$ kinks and derive\nthe real dynamics by solving the appropriate field equation numerically\nemploying a Runga-Kutta method. We also use a collective coordinate\napproximation to find approximate dynamics, with the objective being to compare\nthe approximate motion to the real dynamics in order to test the validity of\nthis kind of approximation, which is used extensively in the study of solitons.\n", "  In this article, we put forward a new approach to electrodynamics of\nmaterials. Based on the identification of induced electromagnetic fields as the\nmicroscopic counterparts of polarization and magnetization, we systematically\nemploy the mutual functional dependencies of induced, external and total field\nquantities. This allows for a unified, relativistic description of the\nelectromagnetic response without assuming the material to be composed of\nelectric or magnetic dipoles. Using this approach, we derive universal\n(material-independent) relations between electromagnetic response functions\nsuch as the dielectric tensor, the magnetic susceptibility and the microscopic\nconductivity tensor. Our formulae can be reduced to well-known identities in\nspecial cases, but more generally include the effects of inhomogeneity,\nanisotropy, magnetoelectric coupling and relativistic retardation. If combined\nwith the Kubo formalism, they would also lend themselves to the ab initio\ncalculation of all linear electromagnetic response functions.\n", "  In 1887 Voigt published a paper dedicated to the Doppler effect in which he\ndemanded form invariance to the wave equation in inertial frames and obtained a\nset of spacetime transformations now known as the Voigt transformations. In\n1905 Poincar\\'e showed that the wave equation was also invariant under the\nLorentz transformations. Voigt and Lorentz transformations are then closely\nrelated, but this relation is not widely known in the standard literature. In\nthis paper we derive the Lorentz transformations from the invariance of the\nD'Alembert operator $\\big(\\Box^{2}=\\Box'^{2}\\big)$ and the Voigt\ntransformations from the conformal invariance of the D'Alembert operator\n$\\big(\\Box^{2}=(1/\\gamma^2)\\Box'^{2},$ where $\\gamma=1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\\big).$\nThe homogeneous scalar wave equation is then invariant under the Lorentz\ntransformations and conformally invariant under the Voigt transformations. We\nsuggest a presentation of special relativity in which the Voigt transformations\nare commented after discussing the Galilean transformations but before\npresenting the Lorentz transformations.\n", "  Distinctive normal-state properties of cuprate superconductors follow from\ntheir charge carriers forming a large-bipolaron liquid. The very weak\nscattering of the slow-moving heavy-massed excitations of the liquid by\nacoustic phonons yields a scattering rate that is less than the Debye\nfrequency. The moderate liquid mobility, greater than 1 cm2/V-sec at 300 K,\nresults as the weak scattering of the liquid compensates for its large mass. In\nresolution of a long-standing dilemma, the dc resistivity resulting from\nscattering by acoustic phonons remains nearly proportional to temperature to\nwell below the Debye temperature. Above the Debye frequency the\nfrequency-dependent conductivity is dominated by excitation and\nphoto-ionization of the self-trapped electronic carriers of the\nlarge-bipolarons. Below the Debye frequency the frequency-dependent\nconductivity is dominated by the Drude-like collective motion of the\nlarge-bipolaron liquid. The gap between these two domains sharpens with\ndecreasing temperature as phonon scattering of the liquid diminishes. The\nhigh-frequency electronic excitations survive in the superconducting state.\n", "  A central issue of the science of complex systems is the quantitative\ncharacterization of complexity. In the present work we address this issue by\nresorting to information geometry. Actually we propose a constructive way to\nassociate to a - in principle any - network a differentiable object (a\nRiemannian manifold) whose volume is used to define an entropy. The\neffectiveness of the latter to measure networks complexity is successfully\nproved through its capability of detecting a classical phase transition\noccurring in both random graphs and scale--free networks, as well as of\ncharacterizing small Exponential random graphs, Configuration Models and real\nnetworks.\n", "  In this lecture we show that the study of hadronic resonances is severely\nhampered by the lack of accurate data and, moreover, that for similar reason\nthe study of Weak substructure does not make sufficient progress. We\nfurthermore report on an unexplained high statistics signal that may indicate\nthe existence of a superlight scalar boson.\n", "  This is a leisurely introductory account addressed to non-experts and based\non previous work by the authors, on how methods borrowed from physics can be\nused to \"count\" an infinite number of points. We begin with the classical case\nof counting integer points on the non-negative real axis and the classical\nEuler-Maclaurin formula. As an intermediate stage, we count integer points on\nproduct cones where the roles played by the coalgebra and the algebraic\nBirkhoff factorization can be appreciated in a relatively simple setting. We\nthen consider the general case of (lattice) cones for which we introduce a\nconilpotent coalgebra of cones, with applications to renormalization of conical\nzeta values. When evaluated at zero arguments conical zeta functions indeed\n\"count\" integer points on cones.\n", "  On assuming that Weak substructure has a dynamics which is similar to quantum\nchromodynamics but much stronger, we conclude that unquenching is indispensable\nfor predictions on the spectrum of Weak-substructure resonances.\n", "  In spite of extensive observations and numerous theoretical studies in the\npast decades several key questions related with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) emission\nmechanisms are still to be answered. Precise detection of the GRB polarization\ncarried out by dedicated instruments can provide new data and be an ultimate\ntool to unveil their real nature. A novel space-borne Compton polarimeter POLAR\nonboard the Chinese space station TG2 is designed to measure linear\npolarization of gamma-rays arriving from GRB prompt emissions. POLAR uses\nplastics scintillator bars (PS) as gamma-ray detectors and multi-anode\nphotomultipliers (MAPMTs) for readout of the scintillation light. Inherent\nproperties of such detection systems are crosstalk and non-uniformity. The\ncrosstalk smears recorded energy over multiple channels making both\nnon-uniformity corrections and energy calibration more difficult. Rigorous\nextraction of polarization observable requires to take such effects properly\ninto account. We studied influence of the crosstalk on energy depositions\nduring laboratory measurements with X-ray beams. A relation between genuine and\nrecorded energy was deduced using an introduced model of data analysis. It\npostulates that both the crosstalk and non-uniformities can be described with a\nsingle matrix obtained in calibrations with mono-energetic X- and gamma-rays.\nNecessary corrections are introduced using matrix based equations allowing for\nproper evaluation of the measured GRB spectra. Validity of the method was\nestablished during dedicated experimental tests. The same approach can be also\napplied in space utilizing POLAR internal calibration sources. The introduced\nmodel is general and with some adjustments well suitable for data analysis from\nother MAPMT-based instruments.\n", "  Astrophysical black hole candidates are thought to be the Kerr black holes of\ngeneral relativity, but the actual nature of these objects has still to be\nconfirmed. The continuum-fitting and the iron line methods are currently the\nonly available techniques to probe the spacetime geometry around these bodies\nand test the Kerr black hole paradigm. The continuum-fitting method is a robust\napproach, but the shape of the disk's thermal spectrum is in general too simple\nto measure the spin and to constrain possible deviations from the Kerr solution\nat the same time. The iron line analysis is potentially a powerful technique,\nbut at the moment we do not have high quality data and a robust astrophysical\nmodel.\n", "  Within 5-10 years, submillimeter VLBI facilities will be hopefully able to\nimage the \"shadow\" of SgrA$^*$. When a black hole is surrounded by an optically\nthin emitting medium, the boundary of the shadow corresponds to the apparent\nphoton capture sphere and only depends on the background metric. An accurate\ndetermination of the shape of the shadow of SgrA$^*$ could constrain possible\ndeviations from the Kerr solution. In combination with other measurements,\nthese observations could test the Kerr black hole paradigm.\n", "  In the standard paradigm, astrophysical black holes can be described solely\nby their mass and angular momentum - commonly referred to as `spin' - resulting\nfrom the process of their birth and subsequent growth via accretion. Whilst the\nmass has a standard Newtonian interpretation, the spin does not, with the\neffect of non-zero spin leaving an indelible imprint on the space-time closest\nto the black hole. As a consequence of relativistic frame-dragging, particle\norbits are affected both in terms of stability and precession, which impacts on\nthe emission characteristics of accreting black holes both stellar mass in\nblack hole binaries (BHBs) and supermassive in active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nOver the last 30 years, techniques have been developed that take into account\nthese changes to estimate the spin which can then be used to understand the\nbirth and growth of black holes and potentially the powering of powerful jets.\nIn this chapter we provide a broad overview of both the theoretical effects of\nspin, the means by which it can be estimated and the results of ongoing\ncampaigns.\n", "  The coefficients of the higher-derivative terms in the low energy expansion\nof genus-one graviton Type II superstring scattering amplitudes are determined\nby integrating sums of non-holomorphic modular functions over the complex\nstructure modulus of a torus. In the case of the four-graviton amplitude, each\nof these modular functions is a multiple sum associated with a Feynman diagram\nfor a free massless scalar field on the torus. The lines in each diagram join\npairs of vertex insertion points and the number of lines defines its weight\n$w$, which corresponds to its order in the low energy expansion. Previous\nresults concerning the low energy expansion of the genus-one four-graviton\namplitude led to a number of conjectured relations between modular functions of\na given $w$, but different numbers of loops $\\le w-1$. In this paper we shall\nprove the simplest of these conjectured relations, namely the one that arises\nat weight $w=4$ and expresses the three-loop modular function $D_4$ in terms of\nmodular functions with one and two loops. As a byproduct, we prove three\nintriguing new holomorphic modular identities.\n", "  Insight in the crumpling or compaction of one-dimensional objects is of great\nimportance for understanding biopolymer packaging and designing innovative\ntechnological devices. By compacting various types of wires in rigid\nconfinements and characterizing the morphology of the resulting crumpled\nstructures, here we report how friction, plasticity, and torsion enhance\ndisorder, leading to a transition from coiled to folded morphologies. In the\nlatter case, where folding dominates the crumpling process, we find that\nreducing the relative wire thickness counter-intuitively causes the maximum\npacking density to decrease. The segment-size distribution gradually becomes\nmore asymmetric during compaction, reflecting an increase of spatial\ncorrelations. We introduce a self-avoiding random walk model and verify that\nthe cumulative injected wire length follows a universal dependence on segment\nsize, allowing for the prediction of the efficiency of compaction as a function\nof material properties, container size, and injection force.\n", "  We study the activated quantum no-signalling-assisted zero-error classical\ncapacity by first allowing the assistance from some noiseless forward\ncommunication channel and later paying back the cost of the helper. This\nactivated communication model considers the additional forward noiseless\nchannel as a catalyst for communication. First, we show that the one-shot\nactivated capacity can be formulated as a semidefinite program and we derive a\nnumber of striking properties of this capacity. We further present a sufficient\ncondition under which a noisy channel can be activated. Second, we show that\none-bit noiseless classical communication is able to fully activate any\nclassical-quantum channel to achieve its asymptotic capacity, or the\nsemidefinite (or fractional) packing number. Third, we prove that the\nasymptotic activated capacity cannot exceed the original asymptotic capacity of\nany quantum channel. We also show that the asymptotic no-signalling-assisted\nzero-error capacity does not equal to the semidefinite packing number for\nquantum channels, which differs from the case of classical-quantum channels.\n", "  We review the present situation in top quark physics, in these early days of\nRun II of the LHC. We take mostly a Standard Model perspective, showing recent\nresults, and review the key concepts and results of the associated theoretical\npredictions. The issues we discuss are the top quark mass, top quark pair and\nsingle top production, production in association with other particles, charge\nasymmetry and top quark decay.\n", "  Tangle machines are a topologically inspired diagrammatic formalism to\ndescribe information flow in networks. This paper begins with an expository\naccount of tangle machines motivated by the problem of describing `covariance\nintersection' fusion of Gaussian estimators in networks. It then gives two\nexamples in which tangle machines tell stories of adiabatic quantum\ncomputations, and discusses learning tangle machines from data.\n", "  We derive a new inequality that is necessary and sufficient to show\nEPR-steering in a scenario employing only correlations between two arbitrary\ndichotomic measurements on each party. Thus the inequality is a complete\nsteering analogy of the CHSH inequality, a generalisation of the result of\nCavalcanti et al, JOSA B, 32(4), A74 (2015). We show that violation of the\ninequality only requires measuring over equivalence classes of mutually\nunbiased measurements on the trusted party and in fact assuming a general two\nqubit system arbitrary pairs of distinct projective measurements at the trusted\nparty are equally useful. Via this it is found that for a given state the\nmaximum violation of our EPR-steering inequality is equal to that for the CHSH\ninequality, so all states that are EPR-steerable with CHSH-type correlations\nare also Bell nonlocal.\n", "  Quantum transition amplitudes are formulated for a model system with local\ninternal time, using path integrals. The amplitudes are shown to be more\nregular near a turning point of internal time than could be expected based on\nexisting canonical treatments. In particular, a successful transition through a\nturning point is provided in the model system, together with a new definition\nof such a transition in general terms. Some of the results rely on a fruitful\nrelation between the problem of time and general Gribov problems.\n", "  Conical zeta values associated with rational convex polyhedral cones\ngeneralise multiple zeta values. We renormalise conical zeta values at poles by\nmeans of a generalisation of Connes and Kreimer's Algebraic Birkhoff\nFactorisation. This paper serves as a motivation for and an application of this\ngeneralised renormalisation scheme. The latter also yields an Euler-Maclaurin\nformula on rational convex polyhedral lattice cones which relates exponential\nsums to exponential integrals. When restricted to Chen cones, it reduces to\nConnes and Kreimer's Algebraic Birkhoff Decomposition for maps with values in\nthe algebra of ordinary meromorphic functions in one variable.\n", "  Multimode optical fibres are enjoying a renewed attention, boosted by the\nurgent need to overcome the current capacity crunch of single-mode fibre\nsystems and by recent advances in multimode complex nonlinear optics [1-13]. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that standard multimode fibres can be used as\nultrafast all-optical tool for transverse beam manipulation of high power laser\npulses. Our experimental data show that the Kerr effect in a graded-index\nmultimode fibre is the driving mechanism for overcoming speckle distortions,\nleading to a somewhat counter-intuitive effect resulting in a spatially clean\noutput beam robust against fibre bending. Our observations demonstrate that\nnonlinear beam reshaping into the fundamental mode of a multimode fibre can be\nachieved even in the absence of a dissipative process such as stimulated\nscattering (Raman or Brillouin) [14,15].\n", "  This paper describes a reduced-order quasi-geostrophic coupled\nocean-atmosphere model that allows for an arbitrary number of atmospheric and\noceanic modes to be retained in the spectral decomposition. The modularity of\nthis new model allows one to easily modify the model physics. Using this new\nmodel, coined the \"Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model\" (MAOOAM), we\nanalyse the dependence of the model dynamics on the truncation level of the\nspectral expansion, and unveil spurious behaviour that may exist at low\nresolution by a comparison with the higher-resolution configurations. In\nparticular, we assess the robustness of the coupled low-frequency variability\nwhen the number of modes is increased. An \"optimal\" configuration is proposed\nfor which the ocean resolution is sufficiently high, while the total number of\nmodes is small enough to allow for a tractable and extensive analysis of the\ndynamics.\n", "  Using advanced classification techniques, we carry out the extended symmetry\nanalysis of the class of generalized Burgers equations of the form\n$u_t+uu_x+f(t,x)u_{xx}=0$. This enhances all the previous results on symmetries\nof these equations and includes the description of admissible transformations,\nLie symmetries, Lie and nonclassical reductions, conservation laws, potential\nadmissible transformations and potential symmetries. The study is based on the\nfact that the class is normalized, and its equivalence group is\nfinite-dimensional.\n", "  The excellent light yield proportionality of europium-doped strontium iodide\n(SrI$_2$:Eu) has resulted in state-of-the-art $\\gamma$-ray detectors with\nremarkably high energy resolution, far exceeding that of most halide compounds.\nIn this class of materials the formation of self-trapped hole polarons is very\ncommon. However, polaron formation is usually expected to limit carrier\nmobilities and has been associated with poor scintillator light-yield\nproportionality and resolution. Here, using a recently developed\nfirst-principles method, we perform an unprecedented study of polaron transport\nin SrI$_2$, both for equilibrium polarons, as well as nascent polarons\nimmediately following a self-trapping event. As a result, we put forward a\nrationale for the unexpected high energy resolution of SrI$_2$. We identify\nnine stable hole polaron configurations, which consist of dimerized iodine\npairs with polaron binding energies of up to 0.5\\,eV. They are connected by a\ncomplex potential energy landscape that comprises 66 unique nearest-neighbor\nmigration paths. \\textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations reveal that\na large fraction of polarons is born into configurations that migrate\npractically barrier free at room temperature. As a result, carriers created\nduring $\\gamma$-irradiation can quickly diffuse away reducing the chance for\nnon-linear recombination reactions that are the primary culprits for\nnon-proportionality and resolution reduction. This leads to the conclusion that\nthe flat, albeit complex, landscape for polaron migration in SrI$_2$ is key for\nunderstanding its outstanding performance. This insight provides important\nguidance not only for the future development of high-performance scintillators\nbut also of other materials, for which large polaron mobilities are crucial\nsuch as batteries and solid state ionic conductors.\n", "  Measurement is of central interest in quantum mechanics as it provides the\nlink between the quantum world and the world of everyday experience. One of the\nfeatures of the latter is its robust, objective character, contrasting the\ndelicate nature of quantum systems. Here we analyze in a completely\nmodel-independent way the celebrated von Neumann measurement process, using\nrecent techniques of information flow, studied in open quantum systems. We show\nthe generic appearance of objective results in quantum measurements, provided\nwe macroscopically coarse-grain the measuring apparatus and wait long enough.\nTo study genericity, we employ the widely-used Gaussian Unitary Ensemble of\nrandom matrices and the Hoeffding inequality. We derive generic objectivization\ntimescales, given solely by the interaction strength and the systems'\ndimensions. Our results are manifestly universal and are a generic property of\nvon Neumann measurements.\n", "  We present the numerical code PRECESSION: a new open-source python module to\nstudy the dynamics of precessing black-hole binaries in the post-Newtonian\nregime. The code provides a comprehensive toolbox to (i) study the evolution of\nthe black-hole spins along their precession cycles, (ii) perform\ngravitational-wave driven binary inspirals using both orbit-averaged and\nprecession-averaged integrations, and (iii) predict the properties of the\nmerger remnant through fitting formulae obtained from numerical-relativity\nsimulations. PRECESSION is a ready-to-use tool to add the black-hole spin\ndynamics to larger-scale numerical studies such as gravitational-wave parameter\nestimation codes, population synthesis models to predict gravitational-wave\nevent rates, galaxy merger trees and cosmological simulations of structure\nformation. PRECESSION provides fast and reliable integration methods to\npropagate statistical samples of black-hole binaries from/to large separations\nwhere they form to/from small separations where they become detectable, thus\nlinking gravitational-wave observations of spinning black-hole binaries to\ntheir astrophysical formation history. The code is also a useful tool to\ncompute initial parameters for numerical-relativity simulations targeting\nspecific precessing systems. PRECESSION can be installed from the Python\nPackage Index and it is freely distributed under version control on Github,\nwhere further documentation is provided.\n", "  Besides general features of two-boson mass distributions, experimental\nresults are are discussed. Furthermore, E(38 MeV) and Z(57.5 GeV) are\nhighlighted.\n", "  An eigenfunction method is applied to reduce the regular projective\nrepresentations (Reps) of finite groups to obtain their irreducible projective\nReps. Anti-unitary groups are treated specially, where the decoupled factor\nsystems and modified Schur's lemma are introduced. We discuss the applications\nof irreducible Reps in many-body physics. It is shown that in symmetry\nprotected topological phases, geometric defects or symmetry defects may carry\nprojective Rep of the symmetry group; while in symmetry enriched topological\nphases, intrinsic excitations (such as spinons or visons) may carry projective\nRep of the symmetry group. We also discuss the applications of projective Reps\nin problems related to spectrum degeneracy, such as in search of models without\nsign problem in quantum Monte Carlo Simulations.\n", "  The Hopf algebra and the Rota-Baxter algebra are the two algebraic structures\nunderlying the algebraic approach of Connes and Kreimer to renormalization of\nperturbative quantum field theory. In particular the Hopf algebra of rooted\ntrees serves as the \"baby model\" of Feynman graphs in their approach and can be\ncharacterized by certain universal properties involving a Hochschild 1-cocycle.\nDecorated rooted trees have also been applied to study Feynman graphs. We will\ncontinue the study of universal properties of various spaces of decorated\nrooted trees with such a 1-cocycle, leading to the concept of a cocycle Hopf\nalgebra. We further apply the universal properties to equip a free Rota-Baxter\nalgebra with the structure of a cocycle Hopf algebra or a cocycle bialgebra.\n", "  Skyrmions, topologically-protected nanometric spin vortices, are being\ninvestigated extensively in various magnets. Among them, many of\nstructurally-chiral cubic magnets host the triangular-lattice skyrmion crystal\n(SkX) as the thermodynamic equilibrium state. However, this state exists only\nin a narrow temperature and magnetic-field region just below the magnetic\ntransition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$, while a helical or conical magnetic\nstate prevails at lower temperatures. Here we describe that for a\nroom-temperature skyrmion material, $\\beta$-Mn-type Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$, a\nfield-cooling via the equilibrium SkX state can suppress the transition to the\nhelical or conical state, instead realizing robust metastable SkX states that\nsurvive over a very wide temperature and magnetic-field region, including down\nto zero temperature and up to the critical magnetic field of the ferromagnetic\ntransition. Furthermore, the lattice form of the metastable SkX is found to\nundergo reversible transitions between a conventional triangular lattice and a\nnovel square lattice upon varying the temperature and magnetic field. These\nfindings exemplify the topological robustness of the once-created skyrmions,\nand establish metastable skyrmion phases as a fertile ground for technological\napplications.\n", "  Wormholes are hypothetical shortcuts in spacetime that in General Relativity\nunavoidably violate all of the pointwise energy conditions. In this paper, we\nconsider several wormhole spacetimes that, as opposed to the standard\n\\emph{designer} procedure frequently employed in the literature, arise directly\nfrom gravitational actions including additional terms resulting from\ncontractions of the Ricci tensor with the metric, and which are formulated\nassuming independence between metric and connection (Palatini approach). We\nreinterpret such wormhole solutions under the prism of General Relativity and\nstudy the matter sources that thread them. We discuss the size of violation of\nthe energy conditions in different cases, and how this is related to the same\nspacetimes when viewed from the modified gravity side.\n", "  It was argued that the Raychaudhuri equation with a quantum correction term\nseems to avoid the Big Bang singularity and to characterize an everlasting\nUniverse [PLB741,276(2015)]. Critical comments on both conclusions and on the\ncorrectness of the key expressions of this work were discussed in literature\n[MPLA31(2016)1650044]. In the present work, we have analyzed the perturbative\n(in)stability conditions in the inflationary era of the early Universe. We\nconclude that both unstable and stable modes are incompatible with the\ncorresponding ones obtained in the standard FLRW Universe. We have shown that\nunstable modes do exist at small (an)isotropic perturbation and for different\nequations of state. Inequalities for both unstable and stable solutions with\nthe standard FLRW space were derived. They reveal that in the FLRW flat\nUniverse both perturbative instability and stability are likely. While negative\nstability modes have been obtained for radiation- and matter-dominated eras,\nmerely, instability modes exist in case of a finite cosmological constant and\nalso if the vacuum energy dominates the cosmic background geometry.\n", "  Whether an idea, information, infection, or innovation diffuses throughout a\nsociety depends not only on the structure of the network of interactions, but\nalso on the timing of those interactions. Recent studies have shown that\ndiffusion can fail on a network in which people are only active in \"bursts\",\nactive for a while and then silent for a while, but diffusion could succeed on\nthe same network if people were active in a more random Poisson manner. Those\nstudies generally consider models in which nodes are active according to the\nsame random timing process and then ask which timing is optimal. In reality,\npeople differ widely in their activity patterns -- some are bursty and others\nare not. Here we show that, if people differ in their activity patterns, bursty\nbehavior does not always hurt the diffusion, and in fact having some (but not\nall) of the population be bursty significantly helps diffusion. We prove that\nmaximizing diffusion requires heterogeneous activity patterns across agents,\nand the overall maximizing pattern of agents' activity times does not involve\nany Poisson behavior.\n", "  The self-consistent model, developed previously to describe phonon coupling\n(PC) effects in magnetic moments of odd magic and semi-magic nuclei, is\nextended to quadrupole moments. It is based on the theory of finite Fermi\nsystems with the use of the perturbation theory in $g_L^2$, where $g_L$ is the\nvertex creating the $L$-phonon. Accounting for the phonon tadpole diagrams is\nan important ingredient of this model. The calculation scheme is based on the\nFayans energy density functional DF3-a and does not contain any adjusted\nparameters. The odd In and Sb isotopes are considered, which are the proton-odd\nneighbors of even tin nuclei. The $2^+_1$ phonon is taken into account which\nquadrupole moment is one ingredient of the calculation scheme. The\ncorresponding values were found by us previously. Two main PC corrections, due\nto the phonon $Z$-factor and due to the phonon-induced interaction, have\nopposite signs and cancel strongly each other, leaving room for other `small'\ncorrections, so that the resulting PC correction is much lower than the\nabsolute values of each of two main ones. However, it remains noticeable,\nmaking the overall agreement with the data significantly better.\n", "  Alpha-decay energies for several chains of super-heavy nuclei are calculated\nwithin the self-consistent mean-field approach by using the Fayans functional\nFaNDF$^0$. They are compared to the experimental data and predictions of two\nSkyrme functionals, SLy4 and SkM*, and of the macro-micro method as well. The\ncorresponding lifetimes are calculated with the use of the\nsemi-phenomenological formulas by Parkhomenko and Sobiczewski and by Royer and\nZhang.\n", "  We study expected values of the polynomials $P_N^{}(z)=\\prod_{1\\leq n\\leq\nN}(X_n^2+z^2)$ whose $2N$ zeros $\\{\\pm i X_k\\}^{}_{k=1,...,N}$ are generated by\n$N$ identically distributed multi-variate mean-zero normal random variables\n$\\{X_k\\}^{N}_{k=1}$ with co-variance\n${\\rm{Cov}}_N^{}(X_k,X_l)=(1+\\frac{\\sigma^2-1}{N})\\delta_{k,l}+\\frac{\\sigma^2-1}{N}(1-\\delta_{k,l})$.\nIn principle these can be evaluated in closed form for arbitrary $N$, yet\ncommonly available computer algebra handles only $N$ up to a dozen (due to\nmemory constraints). A list of the first three expected polynomials shows that\nthe expressions become unwieldy already for moderate $N$. On the other hand,\nasymptotic evaluations of the large-$N$ regime for complex $z$ have\ntraditionally been limited to analytic expansion techniques, several rigorous\nresults are proved about this regime for complex $z$. Yet if $z$ is real one\ncan also compute the large-$N$ asymptotics in the \"infinite-degree\" limit with\nthe help of the familiar relative entropy principle for probability measures, a\nrigorous proof of this fact is supplied. Computer algebra-generated evidence is\npresented in support of a conjecture that a generalization of the relative\nentropy principle to *{signed and complex measures}* governs the $N\\to\\infty$\nasymptotics of the regime of imaginary $z$. Potential generalizations, in\nparticular to point vortex ensembles and the prescribed Gauss curvature\nproblem, and to random matrix ensembles, are emphasized.\n", "  We present a new procedure for the internal (night-to-night) calibration of\ntime series spectra, with specific applications to optical AGN reverberation\nmapping data. The traditional calibration technique assumes that the narrow\n[OIII]$\\lambda$5007 emission line profile is constant in time; given a\nreference [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 line profile, nightly spectra are aligned by\nfitting for a wavelength shift, a flux rescaling factor, and a change in the\nspectroscopic resolution. We propose the following modifications to this\nprocedure: 1) we stipulate a constant spectral resolution for the final\ncalibrated spectra, 2) we employ a more flexible model for changes in the\nspectral resolution, and 3) we use a Bayesian modeling framework to assess\nuncertainties in the calibration. In a test case using data for MCG+08-11-011,\nthese modifications result in a calibration precision of $\\sim\\! 1$\nmillimagnitude, which is approximately a factor of five improvement over the\ntraditional technique. At this level, other systematic issues (e.g., the\nnightly sensitivity functions and FeII contamination) limit the final precision\nof the observed light curves. We implement this procedure as a {\\tt python}\npackage ({\\tt mapspec}), which we make available to the community.\n", "  The measurement of two-particle angular correlations is a powerful tool to\nstudy jet quenching in a $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ region inaccessible by direct jet\nidentification. In these measurements pseudorapidity ($\\Delta\\eta$) and\nazimuthal ($\\Delta\\varphi$) differences are used to extract the shape of the\nnear-side peak formed by particles associated to a higher $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\ntrigger particle ($1 < p_{\\mathrm{T, trig}} <$ 8 GeV/c). A combined fit of the\nnear-side peak and long-range correlations is applied to the data allowing the\nextraction of the centrality evolution of the peak shape in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. A significant broadening of the peak in\nthe $\\Delta\\eta$ direction at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is found from peripheral to\ncentral collisions, which vanishes above 4 GeV/c, while in the $\\Delta\\varphi$\ndirection the peak is almost independent of centrality. For the 10% most\ncentral collisions and $1 < p_{\\mathrm{T, assoc}} <$ 2 GeV/c, $1 <\np_{\\mathrm{T, trig}} <$ 3 GeV/c a novel feature is observed: a depletion\ndevelops around the centre of the peak. The results are compared to pp\ncollisions at the same centre of mass energy and to AMPT model simulations. The\ncomparison to the investigated models suggests that the broadening and the\ndevelopment of the depletion is connected to the strength of radial and\nlongitudinal flow.\n", "  In two-particle angular correlation measurements, jets give rise to a\nnear-side peak, formed by particles associated to a higher $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\ntrigger particle. Measurements of these correlations as a function of\npseudorapidity ($\\Delta\\eta$) and azimuthal ($\\Delta\\varphi$) differences are\nused to extract the centrality and $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ dependence of the shape of\nthe near-side peak in the $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ range $1 < p_{\\mathrm{T}} <$ 8 GeV/c\nin Pb-Pb and pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. A combined\nfit of the near-side peak and long-range correlations is applied to the data\nand the peak shape is quantified by the variance of the distributions. While\nthe width of the peak in the $\\Delta\\varphi$ direction is almost independent of\ncentrality, a significant broadening in the $\\Delta\\eta$ direction is found\nfrom peripheral to central collisions. This feature is prominent for the low\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ region and vanishes above 4 GeV/c. The widths measured in\nperipheral collisions are equal to those in pp in the $\\Delta\\varphi$ direction\nand above 3 GeV/c in the $\\Delta\\eta$ direction. Furthermore, for the 10\\% most\ncentral collisions and $1 < p_{\\mathrm{T, assoc}} <$ 2 GeV/c, $1 <\np_{\\mathrm{T, trig}} <$ 3 GeV/c a departure from a Gaussian shape is found: a\ndepletion develops around the centre of the peak. The results are compared to\nAMPT model simulations as well as other theoretical calculations indicating\nthat the broadening and the development of the depletion is connected to the\nstrength of radial and longitudinal flow.\n", "  Recently, it was formulated a teleparallel theory called $f(T,B)$ gravity\nwhich connects both $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ under suitable limits. In this theory,\nthe function in the action is assumed to depend on the torsion scalar $T$ and\nalso on a boundary term related with the divergence of torsion,\n$B=2\\nabla_{\\mu}T^{\\mu}$. In this work, we study different features of a flat\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology in this theory. First,\nwe show that the FLRW equations can be transformed to the form of Clausius\nrelation $\\hat{T}_hS_{\\rm eff}=-dE+WdV$, where $\\hat{T}_h$ is the horizon\ntemperature and $S_{\\rm eff}$ is the entropy which contains contributions both\nfrom horizon entropy and an additional entropy term introduced due to the\nnon-equilibrium. We also formulate the constraint for the validity of the\ngeneralised second law of thermodynamics (GSLT). Additionally, using a\ncosmological reconstruction technique, we show that both $f(T,B)$ and $-T+F(B)$\ngravity can mimic power-law, de-Sitter and $\\Lambda$CDM models. Finally, we\nformulate the perturbed evolution equations and analyse the stability of some\nimportant cosmological solutions.\n", "  The Moutard transformation for a two-dimensional Dirac operator with a\ncomplex-valued potential is constructed. It is showed that this transformation\nrelates the potentials of Weierstrass representations of surfaces related by a\ncomposition of the inversion and a reflection with respect to an axis. It is\ngiven an analytical description of an explicit example of such a transformation\nwhich results in a creation of double points on the spectral curve of a Dirac\noperator with a double-periodic potential.\n", "  The $^{4}\\Phi_{9/2}$ ground state of the Ni$_2^+$ diatomic molecular cation\nis determined experimentally from temperature and magnetic-field-dependent\nx-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy in a cryogenic ion trap, where\nan electronic and rotational temperature of $7.4 \\pm 0.2$ K was reached by\nbuffer gas cooling of the molecular ion. The contribution of the magnetic\ndipole term to the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spin sum rule amounts to\n$7\\, T_z = 0.17 \\pm 0.06$ $\\mu_B$ per atom, approximately 11 % of the spin\nmagnetic moment. We find that, in general, homonuclear diatomic molecular\ncations of $3d$ transition metals seem to adopt maximum spin magnetic moments\nin their electronic ground states.\n", "  We have investigated spin interaction under the collision of Kerr-(anti-)de\nSitter black holes. The potential of a spin interaction is dependent on the\nrelative rotating directions of the black holes, and this potential can be\nreleased as gravitational radiation under the collision. The radiation depends\non the cosmological constant and corresponds to the potential of the spin\ninteraction at a limit where one of the black holes is assumed to have small\nmass and angular momentum. Then, we have shown, approximately, the overall\nbehaviors of the upper bounds on the radiation using thermodynamics. From these\nbounds, the spin interaction can consistently contribute to the radiation. In\naddition, the radiation depends on the stability of the black hole synthesized\nfrom the collision.\n", "  Dirac-like electronic states are the main engines powering the tremendous\nadvances in research of graphene, topological insulators and other materials\nwith these states. Zero effective mass, high carrier mobility and numerous\napplications are some consequences of linear dispersion that distinguishes\nDirac states. Here we report a new class of linear electronic bands in\ntwo-dimensional materials with zero effective mass and sharp band edges never\nseen in solid state matter before, and predict stable materials with such\nelectronic structure utilizing symmetry group analysis and ab initio approach.\nWe make a full classification of completely linear bands in two-dimensional\nmaterials and find that only two classes exist: Dirac fermions on one hand and\npyramidal-like and cootie catcher-like states on the other hand. The new class\nsupports zero effective mass and hence high carrier mobility similar to that of\ngraphene, anisotropic electronic properties like that of phosphorene, and\nrobustness of states with respect to electronic correlations.\n", "  The detection, removal and reduction of hydrogen peroxide is of significant\nimportance for its increasing application in the areas of environment, food,\nelectrochemistry and clinical laboratory. Herein the dissociative adsorption\nbehavior of hydrogen peroxide on ultrathin magnesia (001) films deposited on\ntransition metal is uncovered for the first time by employing periodic\ndensity-functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections. The\nhydrogen peroxide is dissociated smoothly and reduced to surface hydroxyls on\nMgO(001)/TM, and the dissociative adsorption energies of all the considered\nfragmentation configurations are substantially negative, demonstrating\ndissociation and reduction of hydrogen peroxide on MgO(001)/TM is\nthermodynamically favorable. The dissociative adsorption energy decreases\nmonotonously with increasing film thickness, demonstrating the lower reactivity\nof thick oxide films. Moreover, we examined the suitability of several\ntransition metal slabs (molybdenum, silver, vanadium, tungsten and gold)\ncombined with magnesia for splitting hydrogen peroxide. The dissociative\nadsorption energies enhance when the lattice constants of substrate slabs\nincrease, indicating the chemisorption strength can be tuned by category of\nmetal slabs as well as thickness of oxide film. The mechanism of reactivity\nenhancement for energetically and dynamically favorable decomposition of\nhydrogen peroxide on supported magnesia is elucidated by characterizing the\ngeometric structures and electronic properties. The fragmentation and reduction\nof diethyl peroxide and peroxyacetone are also studied to reveal the catalytic\nactivity of ultrathin magnesia toward splitting organic peroxides. The results\nare wished to provide useful clue for detecting and reducing hydrogen peroxide\nand organic peroxides by employing oxide-metal hybrid nanostructure.\n", "  We construct a two-dimensional (2D) lattice model that is argued to realize a\ngapped chiral spin liquid with (Ising) non-Abelian topological order. The\nbuilding blocks are spin-1/2 two-leg ladders with $SU(2)$-symmetric spin-spin\ninteractions. The two-leg ladders are then arranged on rows and coupled through\nSU(2)-symmetric interactions between consecutive ladders. The intra-ladder\ninteractions are tuned so as to realize the c = 1/2 Ising conformal field\ntheory, a fact that we establish numerically via Density Matrix Renormalization\nGroup (DMRG) studies. Time-reversal breaking inter-ladder interactions are\ntuned so as to open a bulk gap in the 2D lattice system. This 2D system\nsupports gapless chiral edge modes with Ising non-Abelian excitations but no\ncharge excitations, in contrast to the Pfaffian non-Abelian fractional quantum\nHall state.\n", "  According to quantum theory the interactions between physical systems are\nquantized. As a direct consequence, measurement sensitivities are fundamentally\nlimited by quantization noise, or just `quantum noise' in short. Furthermore,\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle demands measurement back-action for some\nobservables of a system if they are measured repeatedly. In both respects,\nsqueezed states are of high interest since they show a `squeezed' uncertainty,\nwhich can be used to improve the sensitivity of measurement devices beyond the\nusual quantum noise limits including those impacted by quantum back-action\nnoise. Squeezed states of light can be produced with nonlinear optics, and a\nlarge variety of proof-of-principle experiments were performed in past decades.\nAs an actual application, squeezed light has now been used for several years to\nimprove the measurement sensitivity of GEO600 -- a laser interferometer built\nfor the detection of gravitational waves. Given this success, squeezed light is\nlikely to significantly contribute to the new field of gravitational-wave\nastronomy. This Review revisits the concept of squeezed states and two-mode\nsqueezed states of light, with a focus on experimental observations. The\ndistinct properties of squeezed states displayed in quadrature phase-space as\nwell as in the photon number representation are described. The role of the\nlight's quantum noise in laser interferometers is summarized and the actual\napplication of squeezed states in these measurement devices is reviewed.\n", "  Van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit intriguing structural, electronic and\nphotonic properties. Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) within Scanning\nTransmission Electron Microscope (STEM) allows for nanoscale mapping of such\nproperties. However, typical STEM-EELS detection is limited to energy losses in\nthe eV range, which are too large for probing important low-energy excitation\nsuch as phonons or mid-IR plasmons. Here we adapt a conventional STEM-EELS\nsystem to probe energy loss down to 100 meV, and apply it to map phononic\nstates in h-BN, a representative van der Waals (vdW) material. The h-BN EELS\nspectra, surprisingly, depend on the h-BN thickness and the distance of the\nelectron beam to h-BN flake edges. To explain this observation, we developed a\nclassical response theory describing the interaction of fast electrons with\n(anisotropic) slabs of vdW materials. Theoretical and numerical calculations\nperfectly match the experimental h-BN spectra, and reveal that the electron\nloss is dominated by the excitation of hyperbolic phonon polaritons, and not of\nbulk phonons as often reported. Thus, STEM-EELS offers the possibility to probe\nlow-energy polaritons in vdW materials, with our theory being of fundamental\nimportance for interpreting future experiments.\n", "  Charge carriers that execute multi-phonon hopping generally interact strongly\nenough with phonons to form polarons. A polarons sluggish motion is linked to\nslowly shifting atomic displacements that severely reduce the intrinsic width\nof its transport band. Here a means to estimate hopping polarons bandwidths\nfrom Seebeck-coefficient measurements is described. The magnitudes of\nsemiconductors Seebeck coefficients are usually quite large (greater than 86\nmicrovolts/K) near room temperature. However, in accord with the third law of\nthermodynamics, Seebeck coefficients must vanish at absolute zero. Here the\ntransition of the Seebeck coefficient of hopping polarons to its\nlow-temperature regime is investigated. The temperature and sharpness of this\ntransition depends on the concentration of carriers and on the width of their\ntransport band. This feature provides a means of estimating the width of a\npolarons transport band. Since the intrinsic broadening of polaron bands is\nvery small, less than the characteristic phonon energy, the net widths of\npolaron transport bands in disordered semiconductors approach the energetic\ndisorder experienced by their hopping carriers, their disorder energy.\n", "  When data is poor we resort to theory modelling. This is a two-step process.\nWe have first to identify the appropriate type of model for the system under\nconsideration and then to tailor it to the specifics of the case. To understand\nsettlement formation, which is the concern of this paper, this not only\ninvolves choosing input parameter values such as site separations but also\ninput functions which characterises the ease of travel between sites. Although\nthe generic behaviour of the model is understood, the details are not.\nDifferent choices will necessarily lead to different outputs (for identical\ninputs). We can only proceed if choices that are \"close\" give outcomes are\nsimilar. Where there are local differences it suggests that there was no\ncompelling reason for one outcome rather than the other. If these differences\nare important for the historic record we may interpret this as sensitivity to\ncontingency. We re-examine the rise of Greek city states as first formulated by\nRihll and Wilson in 1979, initially using the same \"retail\" gravity model. We\nsuggest that, whereas cities like Athens owe their position to a combination of\ngeography and proximity to other sites, the rise of Thebes is the most\ncontingent, whose success reflects social forces outside the grasp of simple\nnetwork modelling.\n", "  Water, when confined at the nanoscale acquires extraordinary transport\nproperties. And yet there is no direct experimental evidence of these\nproperties at nanoscale resolution. Here, by using 2D NMR diffusion-relaxation\n(D-T2) and spin-lattice - spin-spin relaxation (T1-T2) spectroscopy, we\nsucceeded to resolve at the nanoscale water diffusion in single and\ndouble-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT/DWCNT). In SWCNTs, spectra display the\ncharacteristic shape of uniform water diffusion restricted in one dimension.\nRemarkably, in DWCNTs water is shown to split into two axial components with\nthe inner one acquiring unusual flow properties: high fragility, ultrafast\nself-diffusion coefficient, and \"rigid\" molecular environment, revealing a\nstratified cooperative motion mechanism to underlie fast diffusion in water\nsaturated CNTs.\n", "  Algebraic quantum field theory is considered from the perspective of the\nHochschild cohomology bicomplex. This is a framework for studying deformations\nand symmetries. Deformation is a possible approach to the fundamental challenge\nof constructing interacting QFT models. Symmetry is the primary tool for\nunderstanding the structure and properties of a QFT model.\n  This perspective leads to a generalization of the algebraic quantum field\ntheory framework, as well as a more general definition of symmetry. This means\nthat some models may have symmetries that were not previously recognized or\nexploited.\n  To first order, a deformation of a QFT model is described by a Hochschild\ncohomology class. A deformation could, for example, correspond to adding an\ninteraction term to a Lagrangian. The cohomology class for such an interaction\nis computed here. However, the result is more general and does not require the\nundeformed model to be constructed from a Lagrangian. This computation leads to\na more concrete version of the construction of perturbative algebraic quantum\nfield theory.\n", "  Deep inelastic scattering data on $F_2$ structure function obtained in the\nfixed-target experiments were analysed in the valence quark approximation with\na next-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy. Parton distribution functions are\nparametrized by using information from the Gottfried sum rule. The strong\ncoupling constant is found to be $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2) = 0.1180 \\pm\n0.0020~\\mbox(total\\,exp.error)$, which coincides very well with the average\nworld value $\\alpha_s^{\\rm PDG}(M_Z^2) = 0.1181 \\pm 0.0013$ updated recently in\na PDG report. The result for the second moment of the difference in $u$ and $d$\nquark distributions $<\\!\\!x\\!\\!>_{u-d}=0.187 \\pm 0.021$ is seen to be well\ncompatible with the latest LATTICE result $<\\!\\!x\\!\\!>_{u-d}^{\\rm\nLATTICE}=0.208 \\pm 0.024$\n", "  Motivated by the local formulae for asymptotic expansion of heat kernels in\nspectral geometry, we propose a definition of Ricci curvature in noncommutative\nsettings. The Ricci operator of an oriented closed Riemannian manifold can be\nrealized as a spectral functional, namely the functional defined by the zeta\nfunction of the full Laplacian of the de Rham complex, localized by smooth\nendomorphisms of the cotangent bundle and their trace. We use this formulation\nto introduce the Ricci functional in a noncommutative setting and in particular\nfor curved noncommutative tori. This Ricci functional uniquely determines a\ndensity element, called the Ricci density, which plays the role of the Ricci\noperator. The main result of this paper provides an explicit computation of the\nRicci density when the conformally flat geometry of the noncommutative two\ntorus is encoded by the modular de Rham spectral triple.\n", "  We study the long wavelength excitations in rotating QCD fluid in presence of\nan external magnetic field at finite vector and axial charge densities. We\nconsider the fluctuations of vector and axial charge currents coupled to energy\nand momentum fluctuations and compute the $SO(3)$ covariant dispersion\nrelations of the six corresponding hydrodynamic modes. Among them, there are\nalways two scalar Chiral Magnetic-Vortical-Heat (CMVH) waves; In the absence of\nmagnetic field (vorticity) these waves reduce to CVH (CMH) waves. While CMVH\nwaves are the mixed of CMH and CVH waves, they have generally different\nvelocities compared to the sum of velocities of the latter waves. The other\nfour modes, which are made out of scalar-vector fluctuations, are mixed\nSound-Alfv\\'en waves. We show that in the direction parallel to both magnetic\nfield and vorticity, these four modes are the two ordinary sound modes together\nwith two Chiral Alfv\\'en waves (CAW).\n", "  Large scale, dynamical simulations have been performed for the two\ndimensional octahedron model, describing the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) for\nnonlinear, or the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) class for linear surface growth. The\nautocorrelation functions of the heights and the dimer lattice gas variables\nare determined with high precision. Parallel random-sequential (RS) and\ntwo-sub-lattice stochastic dynamics (SCA) have been compared. The latter causes\na constant correlation in the long time limit, but after subtracting it one can\nfind the same height functions as in case of RS. On the other hand the ordered\nupdate alters the dynamics of the lattice gas variables, by increasing\n(decreasing) the memory effects for nonlinear (linear) models with respect to\nrandom-sequential. Additionally, we support the KPZ ansatz and the\nKallabis-Krug conjecture in $2+1$ dimensions and provide a precise growth\nexponent value $\\beta=0.2414(2)$. We show the emergence of finite size\ncorrections, which occur long before the steady state roughness is reached.\n", "  The characterization of the stationary states in the spin-Hall effect is\ndiscussed within the framework of the phenomenological two spin-channel model.\nIt is shown that two different definitions of the stationary states can be\napplied in the spin-Hall effect, leading to two different types of state in the\nbulk: zero transverse spin-current or non-zero pure spin-current. This\ndifference is due to the treatment of the region near the edges, in which\nelectric charge accumulation occurs. The screening equations that describe the\naccumulation of electric charges due to spin-orbit coupling are derived. The\nspin-accumulation associated to spin-flip scattering and the spin-Hall\naccumulation due to spin-orbit coupling are two independent effects if we\nassume that the screening length is small with respect to the spin-diffusion\nlength. The corresponding transport equations are discussed in terms of the\nDyakonov-Perel equations.\n", "  Shortcuts to adiabaticity provide a general approach to mimic adiabatic\nquantum processes via arbitrarily fast evolutions in Hilbert space. For these\ncounter-diabatic evolutions, higher speed comes at higher energy cost. Here,\nthe counter-diabatic theory is employed as a minimal energy demanding scheme\nfor speeding up adiabatic tasks. As a by-product, we show that this approach\ncan be used to obtain infinite classes of transitionless models, including\ntime-independent Hamiltonians under certain conditions over the eigenstates of\nthe original Hamiltonian. We apply these results to investigate shortcuts to\nadiabaticity in decohering environments by introducing the requirement of a\nfixed energy resource. In this scenario, we show that generalized\ntransitionless evolutions can be more robust against decoherence than their\nadiabatic counterparts. We illustrate this enhanced robustness both for the\nLandau-Zener model and for quantum gate Hamiltonians.\n", "  After a short critique of the Minkowski formulae for the electromagnetic\nconstitutive laws in moving media, we argue that in actual fact the problem of\nLorentz-covariant electromagnetic response theory is automatically solved\nwithin the framework of modern microscopic electrodynamics of materials. As an\nillustration, we first rederive the well-known relativistic transformation\nbehavior of the microscopic conductivity tensor. Thereafter, we deduce from\nfirst principles the transformation law of the wavevector- and\nfrequency-dependent dielectric tensor under Lorentz boost transformations.\n", "  Variability Search Toolkit (VaST) is a software package designed to find\nvariable objects in a series of sky images. It can be run from a script or\ninteractively using its graphical interface. VaST relies on source list\nmatching as opposed to image subtraction. SExtractor is used to generate source\nlists and perform aperture or PSF-fitting photometry (with PSFEx). Variability\nindices that characterize scatter and smoothness of a lightcurve are computed\nfor all objects. Candidate variables are identified as objects having high\nvariability index values compared to other objects of similar brightness. The\ntwo distinguishing features of VaST are its ability to perform accurate\naperture photometry of images obtained with non-linear detectors and handle\ncomplex image distortions. The software has been successfully applied to images\nobtained with telescopes ranging from 0.08 to 2.5m in diameter equipped with a\nvariety of detectors including CCD, CMOS, MIC and photographic plates. About\n1800 variable stars have been discovered with VaST. It is used as a transient\ndetection engine in the New Milky Way (NMW) nova patrol. The code is written in\nC and can be easily compiled on the majority of UNIX-like systems. VaST is free\nsoftware available at http://scan.sai.msu.ru/vast/\n", "  China has experienced an outstanding economic expansion during the past\ndecades, however, literature on non-monetary metrics that reveal the status of\nChina's regional economic development are still lacking. In this paper, we fill\nthis gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through\nanalyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic\ncomplexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces'\nECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic\ndevelopment and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of\nECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare\ndifferent measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with\nmonetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the\nnon-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have\nstronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate\nregressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other\nsocioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better\nunderstanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary\nmacroeconomic indicators.\n", "  We study the effect of spin-orbit interaction on one-dimensional\nU(1)-invariant frustrated magnets with dominant critical nematic fluctuations.\nThe spin-orbit coupling explicitly breaks the U(1) symmetry of arbitrary global\nspin rotations about the high-symmetry axis down to $Z_2$ (invariance under a\n$\\pi$-rotation). Given that the nematic order parameter is invariant under a\n$\\pi$-rotation, it is relevant to ask if other discrete symmetries can be\nspontaneously broken. Here we demonstrate that the spin-orbit coupling induces\na bond density wave that spontaneously breaks the translational symmetry and\nopens a gap in the excitation spectrum.\n", "  We analyze the probability distributions of the quantum walks induced from\nMarkov chains by Szegedy (2004). The first part of this paper is devoted to the\nquantum walks induced from finite state Markov chains. It is shown that the\nprobability distribution on the states of the underlying Markov chain is always\nconvergent in the Cesaro sense. In particular, we deduce that the limiting\ndistribution is uniform if the transition matrix is symmetric. In the cases of\nnon-symmetric Markov chain, we exemplify that the limiting distribution of the\nquantum walk is not necessarily identical with the stationary distribution of\nthe underlying irreducible Markov chain. The Szegedy scheme can be extended to\ninfinite state Markov chains (random walks). In the second part, we formulate\nthe quantum walk induced from a lazy random walk on the line. We then obtain\nthe weak limit of the quantum walk. It is noted that the current quantum walk\nappears to spread faster than its counterpart-quantum walk on the line driven\nby the Grover coin discussed in literature. The paper closes with an outlook on\npossible future directions.\n", "  We derive an interacting quintessence model on the framework of a recently\nintroduced new class of geometrical scalar-tensor theories of gravity\nformulated on a Weyl-Integrable geometry, where the gravitational sector is\ndescribed by both a scalar and a tensor metric field. By using a Palatini\nvariational principle we construct a scalar-tensor action invariant under the\nWeyl symmetry group of the background geometry, which in the Einstein-Riemann\nframe leads to a gravitoelectromagnetic theory. We use the gauge freedom of the\ntheory and the fact that the Weyl scalar field couples with matter fields to\nformulate an interacting quintessential model with a non-canonical kinetic\nterm, where the quintessence field has a geometrical origin. Due to this\nnon-canonicity we obtain that the mass of the quintessence field in the past\nepochs results to be small enough not to cause modifications in the baryon to\nphoton ratio during nucleosynthesis.\n", "  The status of the literature is reviewed for several thermophysical\nproperties of pure solid and liquid tungsten which constitute input for the\nmodelling of intense plasma-surface interaction phenomena that are important\nfor fusion applications. Reliable experimental data are analyzed for the latent\nheat of fusion, the electrical resistivity, the specific isobaric heat\ncapacity, the thermal conductivity and the mass density from the room\ntemperature up to the boiling point of tungsten as well as for the surface\ntension and the dynamic viscosity across the liquid state. Analytical\nexpressions of high accuracy are recommended for these thermophysical\nproperties that involved a minimum degree of extrapolations. In particular,\nextrapolations were only required for the surface tension and viscosity.\n", "  The complete group classification problem for the class of (1+1)-dimensional\n$r$th order general variable-coefficient Burgers-Korteweg-de Vries equations is\nsolved for arbitrary values of $r$ greater than or equal to two. We find the\nequivalence groupoids of this class and its various subclasses obtained by\ngauging equation coefficients with equivalence transformations. Showing that\nthis class and certain gauged subclasses are normalized in the usual sense, we\nreduce the complete group classification problem for the entire class to that\nfor the selected maximally gauged subclass, and it is the latter problem that\nis solved efficiently using the algebraic method of group classification.\nSimilar studies are carried out for the two subclasses of equations with\ncoefficients depending at most on the time or space variable, respectively.\nApplying an original technique, we classify Lie reductions of equations from\nthe class under consideration with respect to its equivalence group. Studying\nof alternative gauges for equation coefficients with equivalence\ntransformations allows us not only to justify the choice of the most\nappropriate gauge for the group classification but also to construct for the\nfirst time classes of differential equations with nontrivial generalized\nequivalence group such that equivalence-transformation components corresponding\nto equation variables locally depend on nonconstant arbitrary elements of the\nclass. For the subclass of equations with coefficients depending at most on the\ntime variable, which is normalized in the extended generalized sense, we\nexplicitly construct its extended generalized equivalence group in a rigorous\nway. The new notion of effective generalized equivalence group is introduced.\n", "  The superposition principle lies at the heart of many non-classical\nproperties of quantum mechanics. Motivated by this, we introduce a rigorous\nresource theory framework for the quantification of superposition of a finite\nnumber of linear independent states. This theory is a generalization of\nresource theories of coherence. We determine the general structure of\noperations which do not create superposition, find an elementary connection to\nunambiguous state discrimination, and propose several general quantitative\nsuperposition measures. We show that several main results from resource\ntheories of coherence still hold in our more general setting. Of special\nimportance are two results about the free completion of trace decreasing\noperations and the free probabilistic transformation between pure states that\nare also valid for the special case of coherence.\n", "  The Standard Model (SM) is inadequate to explain the origin of tiny neutrino\nmasses, the dark matter (DM) relic abundance and also the baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe. In this work to address all the three puzzles, we extend the SM\nby a local U$(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetry, three right-handed (RH) neutrinos\nfor the cancellation of gauge anomalies and two complex scalars having nonzero\nU$(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ charges. All the newly added particles become massive after\nthe breaking of U$(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ symmetry by the vacuum expectation value (VEV)\nof one of the scalar fields $\\phi_H$. The other scalar field $\\phi_{DM}$, which\ndoes not have any VEV, becomes automatically stable and can be a viable DM\ncandidate. Neutrino masses are generated using Type-I seesaw mechanism while\nthe required lepton asymmetry to reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry, can\nbe attained from the CP violating out of equilibrium decays of RH neutrinos in\nTeV scale. More importantly within this framework, we have studied in detail\nthe production of DM via freeze-in mechanism considering all possible\nannihilation and decay processes. Finally, we find a situation when DM is\ndominantly produced from the annihilation of RH neutrinos, which are at the\nsame time also responsible for neutrino mass generation and leptogenesis.\n", "  The control of spins and spin to charge conversion in organics requires\nunderstanding the molecular spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and a means to tune its\nstrength. However, quantifying SOC strengths indirectly through spin relaxation\neffects has proven diffi- cult due to competing relaxation mechanisms. Here we\npresent a systematic study of the g-tensor shift in molecular semiconductors\nand link it directly to the SOC strength in a series of high mobility molecular\nsemiconductors with strong potential for future devices. The results\ndemonstrate a rich variability of the molecular g-shifts with the effective\nSOC, depending on subtle aspects of molecular composition and structure. We\ncorrelate the above g -shifts to spin-lattice relaxation times over four orders\nof magnitude, from 200 {\\mu}s to 0.15 {\\mu}s, for isolated molecules in\nsolution and relate our findings for isolated molecules in solution to the spin\nrelaxation mechanisms that are likely to be relevant in solid state systems.\n", "  Extending work by Gies and Karbstein on the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, it\nhas recently been shown that the one-loop propagator of a charged scalar\nparticle in a constant electromagnetic field has a one-particle reducible\ncontribution in addition to the well-studied irreducible one. Here we further\ngeneralize this result to the spinor case, and find the same relation between\nthe reducible term, the tree-level propagator and the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg\nLagrangian as in the scalar case. Our demonstration uses a novel worldline path\nintegral representation of the photon-dressed spinor propagator in a constant\nelectromagnetic field background.\n", "  We propose and experimentally demonstrate an efficient framework for the\nquantum simulation of quantum channels in NMR. Our approach relies on the\nsuitable decomposition of non-unitary operators in a linear combination of $d$\nunitary ones, which can be then experimentally implemented with the assistance\nof a number of ancillary qubits that grows logarithmically in $d$. As a\nproof-of-principle demonstration, we realize the quantum simulation of three\nquantum channels for a single-qubit: phase damping (PD), amplitude damping\n(AD), and depolarizing (DEP) channels. For these paradigmatic cases, we measure\nkey features, such as the fidelity of the initial state and the associated von\nNeuman entropy for a qubit evolving through these channels. Our experiments are\ncarried out using nuclear spins in a liquid sample and NMR control techniques.\n", "  To address some physical properties of percolating systems it can be useful\nto know the degree distributions in finite clusters along with their size\ndistribution. Here we show that to achieve this aim for classical bond\npercolation one can use the $q \\to 1$ limit of suitably modified q-state Potts\nmodel. We consider a version of such model with the additional complex\nvariables and show that its partition function gives generating function for\nthe size and degree distribution in this limit. We derive this distribution\nanalytically for bond percolation on Bethe lattice and complete graph. The\npossibility to expand the applications of present method to other clusters'\ncharacteristics and to models of correlated percolation is discussed.\n", "  For lattice Monte Carlo simulations parallelization is crucial to make\nstudies of large systems and long simulation time feasible, while sequential\nsimulations remain the gold-standard for correlation-free dynamics. Here,\nvarious domain decomposition schemes are compared, concluding with one which\ndelivers virtually correlation-free simulations on GPU Extensive simulations of\nthe octahedron model for $2+1$ dimensional Karda--Parisi--Zhang surface growth,\nwhich is very sensitive to correlation in the site-selection dynamics, were\nperformed to show self-consistency of the parallel runs and agreement with the\nsequential algorithm. We present a GPU implementation providing a speedup of\nabout $30\\times$ over a parallel CPU implementation on a single socket and at\nleast $180\\times$ with respect to the sequential reference.\n", "  A search for new physics in energetic, high-multiplicity final states has\nbeen performed using proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS\ndetector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. The standard model background,\ndominated by multijet production, is determined exclusively from control\nregions in data. No statistically significant excess of events is observed.\nModel-independent limits on the product of the cross section and the acceptance\nof a new physics signal in these final states are set and further interpreted\nin terms of limits on the production of black holes. Semiclassical black holes\nand string balls with masses as high as 9.5 TeV, and quantum black holes with\nmasses as high as 9.0 TeV are excluded by this search in the context of models\nwith extra dimensions, thus significantly extending limits set at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the LHC Run 1 data.\n", "  A core process in many quantum tasks is the generation of entanglement. It is\nbeing actively studied in a variety of physical settings - from simple\nbipartite systems to complex multipartite systems. In this work we\nexperimentally study the generation of bipartite entanglement in a nanophotonic\nsystem. Entanglement is generated via the quantum interference of two surface\nplasmon polaritons in a beamsplitter structure, i.e. utilising the\nHong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, and its presence is verified using quantum state\ntomography. The amount of entanglement is quantified by the concurrence and we\nfind values of up to 0.77 +/- 0.04. Verifying entanglement in the output state\nfrom HOM interference is a nontrivial task and cannot be inferred from the\nvisibility alone. The techniques we use to verify entanglement could be applied\nto other types of photonic system and therefore may be useful for the\ncharacterisation of a range of different nanophotonic quantum devices.\n", "  We propose an integrable discrete model of one-dimensional soil water\ninfiltration. This model is based on the continuum model by Broadbridge and\nWhite, which takes the form of nonlinear convection-diffusion equation with a\nnonlinear flux boundary condition at the surface. It is transformed to the\nBurgers equation with a time-dependent flux term by the hodograph\ntransformation. We construct a discrete model preserving the underlying\nintegrability, which is formulated as the self-adaptive moving mesh scheme. The\ndiscretization is based on linearizability of the Burgers equation to the\nlinear diffusion equation, but the na\\\"ive discretization based on the Euler\nscheme which is often used in the theory of discrete integrable systems does\nnot necessarily give a good numerical scheme. Taking desirable properties of a\nnumerical scheme into account, we propose an alternative discrete model that\nproduces solutions with similar accuracy to direct computation on the original\nnonlinear equation, but with clear benefits regarding computational cost.\n", "  We first prove that, in Vasiliev's theory, the zero-form charges studied in\n1103.2360 and 1208.3880 are twisted open Wilson lines in the noncommutative $Z$\nspace. This is shown by mapping Vasiliev's higher-spin model on noncommutative\nYang--Mills theory. We then prove that, prior to Bose-symmetrising, the\ncyclically-symmetric higher-spin invariants given by the leading order of these\n$n$-point zero-form charges are equal to corresponding cyclically-invariant\nbuilding blocks of $n$-point correlation functions of bilinear operators in\nfree conformal field theories (CFT) in three dimensions. On the higher spin\ngravity side, our computation reproduces the results of 1210.7963 using an\nalternative method amenable to the computation of subleading corrections\nobtained by perturbation theory in normal order. On the free CFT side, our\nproof involves the explicit computation of the separate cyclic building blocks\nof the correlation functions of $n$ conserved currents in arbitrary dimension\n$d>2$, using polarization vectors, which is an original result. It is shown to\nagree, for $d=3$, with the results obtained in 1301.3123 in various dimensions\nand where polarization spinors were used.\n", "  Machine learning has emerged as an invaluable tool in many research areas. In\nthe present work, we harness this power to predict highly accurate molecular\ninfrared spectra with unprecedented computational efficiency. To account for\nvibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects -- typically neglected by\nconventional quantum chemistry approaches -- we base our machine learning\nstrategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations\nare usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules, we overcome\nthese limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning\ntechniques, not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude,\nbut also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this\nend, we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent\nneural network charges and combine it with the neural network potentials of\nBehler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy, we are\nable to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of\ninfrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference\npoints. This is made possible through the introduction of a fully automated\nsampling scheme and the use of molecular forces during neural network potential\ntraining. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying\nit to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule, n-alkanes containing\nup to 200 atoms and the protonated alanine tripeptide, which at the same time\nrepresents the first application of machine learning techniques to simulate the\ndynamics of a peptide. In all these case studies we find excellent agreement\nbetween the infrared spectra predicted via machine learning models and the\nrespective theoretical and experimental spectra.\n", "  Spatial organisation is a hallmark of all living cells, and recreating it in\nmodel systems is a necessary step in the creation of synthetic cells. It is\ntherefore of both fundamental and practical interest to better understand the\nbasic mechanisms underlying spatial organisation in cells. In this work, we use\na continuum model of membrane and protein dynamics to study the behaviour of\ncurvature-inducing proteins on membranes of spherical shape, such as living\ncells or lipid vesicles. We show that the interplay between curvature energy,\nentropic forces, and the geometric constraints on the membrane can result in\nthe formation of patterns of highly-curved/protein-rich and\nweakly-curved/protein-poor domains on the membrane. The spontaneous formation\nof such patterns can be triggered either by an increase in the average density\nof curvature-inducing proteins, or by a relaxation of the geometric constraints\non the membrane imposed by the membrane tension or by the tethering of the\nmembrane to a rigid cell wall or cortex. These parameters can also be tuned to\nselect the size and number of the protein-rich domains that arise upon pattern\nformation. The very general mechanism presented here could be related to\nprotein self-organisation in many biological processes, ranging from\n(proto)cell division to the formation of membrane rafts.\n", "  We propose that the dark matter abundance is set by the decoupling of\ninelastic scattering instead of annihilations. This coscattering mechanism is\ngenerically realized if dark matter scatters against states of comparable mass\nfrom the thermal bath. Coscattering points to dark matter that is exponentially\nlighter than the weak scale and has a suppressed annihilation rate, avoiding\nstringent constraints from indirect detection. Dark matter upscatters into\nstates whose late decays can lead to observable distortions to the blackbody\nspectrum of the cosmic microwave background.\n", "  Planar large-bipolarons can form if the ratio of the surrounding mediums\nstatic to high-frequency dielectric constants is especially large. A\nlarge-bipolaron in p-doped La2CuO4 is modeled as two electrons being removed\nfrom the out-of-plane orbitals of four oxygen ions circumscribed by four copper\nions of a CuO2 layer. These oxygen dianions relax inwardly as they donate\nelectrons to the surrounding outwardly relaxing copper cations. This charge\ntransfer generates the strong in-plane electron-lattice interaction needed to\nstabilize a large-bipolaron with respect to decomposing into polarons. The\nlowest-energy radial in-plane optic vibration of a large-bipolarons four core\noxygen ions with their associated electronic charges has d-symmetry. Electronic\nrelaxation in response to multiple large-bipolarons atomic vibrations lowers\ntheir frequencies to generate a phonon-mediated attraction among them which\nfosters their condensation into a liquid. This liquid features distinctive\ntransport and optical properties. A large-bipolaron liquids superconductivity\ncan result when it undergoes a Bose condensation yielding macroscopic\noccupation of its ground-state. The synchronized vibrations of large-bipolarons\ncore-oxygen ions with their electronic charges generate this Bose condensates\ndynamic global d-symmetry.\n", "  We provide a systematic theoretical, experimental, and historical critique of\nthe standard derivation of Fresnel's equations, which shows in particular that\nthese well-established equations actually contradict the traditional,\nmacroscopic approach to electrodynamics in media. Subsequently, we give a\nrederivation of Fresnel's equations which is exclusively based on the\nmicroscopic Maxwell equations and hence in accordance with modern\nfirst-principles materials physics. In particular, as a main outcome of this\nanalysis being of a more general interest, we propose the most general boundary\nconditions on electric and magnetic fields which are valid on the microscopic\nlevel.\n", "  Determining the stability of molecules and condensed phases is the\ncornerstone of atomistic modelling, underpinning our understanding of chemical\nand materials properties and transformations. Here we show that a machine\nlearning model, based on a local description of chemical environments and\nBayesian statistical learning, provides a unified framework to predict\natomic-scale properties. It captures the quantum mechanical effects governing\nthe complex surface reconstructions of silicon, predicts the stability of\ndifferent classes of molecules with chemical accuracy, and distinguishes active\nand inactive protein ligands with more than 99% reliability. The universality\nand the systematic nature of our framework provides new insight into the\npotential energy surface of materials and molecules.\n", "  We experimentally investigate Andreev transport through a single junction\nbetween an s-wave indium superconductor and a thick film of a three-dimensional\n$Bi_2Te_3$ topological insulator. We study $Bi_2Te_3$ samples with different\nbulk and surface characteristics, where the presence of a topological surface\nstate is confirmed by direct ARPES measurements. All the junctions demonstrate\nAndreev transport within the superconducting gap. For junctions with\ntransparent $In-Bi_2Te_3$ interfaces we find a number of nearly periodic\nconductance oscillations, which are accompanied by zero-bias conductance\nanomaly. Both effects disappear above the superconducting transition or for\nresistive junctions. We propose a consistent interpretation of both effects as\noriginating from proximity-induced superconducting correlations within the\n$Bi_2Te_3$ topological surface state.\n", "  We explore a variant of the $\\phi^6$ model originally proposed in Phys.\\\nRev.\\ D {\\bf 12}, 1606 (1975) as a prototypical, so-called, \"bag\" model in\nwhich domain walls play the role of quarks within hadrons. We examine the\nsteady state of the model, namely an apparent bound state of two kink\nstructures. We explore its linearization, and we find that, as a function of a\nparameter controlling the curvature of the potential, an {\\it effectively\narbitrary} number of internal modes may arise in the point spectrum of the\nlinearization about the domain wall profile. We explore some of the key\ncharacteristics of kink-antikink collisions, such as the critical velocity and\nthe multi-bounce windows, and how they depend on the principal parameter of the\nmodel. We find that the critical velocity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence\non the parameter controlling the curvature of the potential. For the\nmulti-bounce windows, we find that their range and complexity decrease as the\nrelevant parameter decreases (and as the number of internal modes in the model\nincreases). We use a modified collective coordinates method [in the spirit of\nrecent works such as {Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D} {\\bf 94}, 085008 (2016)] in order to\ncapture the relevant phenomenology in a semi-analytical manner.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions, transitions between many-body ground states, are\nof extensive interest in research ranging from condensed matter physics to\ncosmology. Key features of the phase transitions include a stage with rapidly\ngrowing new order, called inflation in cosmology, followed by the formation of\ntopological defects. How inflation is initiated and evolves into topological\ndefects remains a hot debate topic. Ultracold atomic gas offers a pristine and\ntunable platform to investigate quantum critical dynamics. We report the\nobservation of coherent inflationary dynamics across a quantum critical point\nin driven Bose-Einstein condensates. The inflation manifests in the exponential\ngrowth of density waves and populations in well-resolved momentum states. After\nthe inflation stage, extended coherent dynamics is evident in both real and\nmomentum space. We present an intuitive description of the quantum critical\ndynamics in our system and demonstrate the essential role of phase fluctuations\nin the formation of topological defects.\n", "  We study the effect of lesions on our four-electrode measurements of the\nionic conductivity of (1 cm3) samples of human brain excised from patients\nundergoing pediatric epilepsy surgery. For most (about 94 %) samples the\nlow-frequency ionic conductivity rises upon increasing the applied frequency.\nWe attributed this behavior to the long-range (0.4 mm) diffusion of solvated\nsodium cations before encountering impenetrable blockages such as cell\nmembranes, blood vessels and cell walls. By contrast, the low-frequency ionic\nconductivity of some (6 %) brain tissue samples falls with increasing applied\nfrequency. We attribute this unusual frequency-dependence to the electric-field\ninduced liberation of sodium cations from traps introduced by the unusually\nsevere pathology observed in samples from these patients. Thus, the anomalous\nfrequency-dependence of the ionic conductivity indicates trap-producing brain\nlesions.\n", "  To ensure compliance with the experimental requirement for ultra-low\nbackground, in this study the radioactivity of stainless steels manufactured by\nsmelting is thoroughly investigated. Raw materials, stage samples, and\ncommercial samples are investigated by glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS)\nand/or with high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) at both the ground level\nand/or the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. Custom-made stainless steel\nsamples are found to have radioactivity levels comparable to those in other\nlow-background experiments. The comprehensive results regarding the\nradioactivity level in materials to be used in the proposed Jinping Neutrino\nExperiment are reported.\n", "  New Experiments With Spheres-Gas (NEWS-G) is a direct dark matter detection\nexperiment using Spherical Proportional Counters (SPCs) with light noble gases\nto search for low-mass Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). We report\nthe results from the first physics run taken at the Laboratoire Souterrain de\nModane (LSM) with SEDINE, a 60 cm diameter prototype SPC operated with a\nmixture of $\\mathrm{Ne}+\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ (0.7 %) at 3.1 bars for a total\nexposure of $9.7\\;\\mathrm{kg\\cdot days}$. New constraints are set on the\nspin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section in the\nsub-$\\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ mass region. We exclude cross-sections above $4.4 \\times\n\\mathrm{10^{-37}\\;cm^2}$ at 90 % confidence level (C.L.) for a 0.5\n$\\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ WIMP. The competitive results obtained with SEDINE are\npromising for the next phase of the NEWS-G experiment: a 140 cm diameter SPC to\nbe installed at SNOLAB by summer 2018.\n", "  We investigate the effect of large magnetic fields on the $2+1$ dimensional\nreduced-magnetohydrodynamical expansion of hot and dense nuclear matter\nproduced in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we consider the case where the magnetic field points in the\ndirection perpendicular to the reaction plane. We also consider this field to\nbe external, with energy density parametrized as a two-dimensional Gaussian.\nThe width of the Gaussian along the directions orthogonal to the beam axis\nvaries with the centrality of the collision. The dependence of the magnetic\nfield on proper time ($\\tau$) for the case of zero electrical conductivity of\nthe QGP is parametrized following [Deng 2012], and for finite electrical\nconductivity following [Tuchin 2013]. We solve the equations of motion of ideal\nhydrodynamics for such an external magnetic field. For collisions with non-zero\nimpact parameter we observe considerable changes in the evolution of the\nmomentum eccentricities of the fireball when comparing the case when the\nmagnetic field decays in a conducting QGP medium and when no magnetic field is\npresent. The elliptic-flow coefficient $v_2$ of $\\pi^{-}$ is shown to increase\nin the presence of an external magnetic field and the increment in $v_2$ is\nfound to depend on the evolution and the initial magnitude of the magnetic\nfield.\n", "  Hamiltonian Truncation (a.k.a. Truncated Spectrum Approach) is an efficient\nnumerical technique to solve strongly coupled QFTs in d=2 spacetime dimensions.\nFurther theoretical developments are needed to increase its accuracy and the\nrange of applicability. With this goal in mind, here we present a new variant\nof Hamiltonian Truncation which exhibits smaller dependence on the UV cutoff\nthan other existing implementations, and yields more accurate spectra. The key\nidea for achieving this consists in integrating out exactly a certain class of\nhigh energy states, which corresponds to performing renormalization at the\ncubic order in the interaction strength. We test the new method on the strongly\ncoupled two-dimensional quartic scalar theory. Our work will also be useful for\nthe future goal of extending Hamiltonian Truncation to higher dimensions d >=\n3.\n", "  We investigate large-scale effects induced by external fields,\nphenomenologically interpreted as mass media, in multiagent models evolving\nwith the microscopic dynamics of the binary naming game. In particular, we show\nthat a single external field, broadcasting information at regular time\nintervals, can reverse the majority opinion of the population, provided the\nfrequency and the effectiveness of the sent messages lie above well-defined\nthresholds. We study the phase structure of the model in the mean field\napproximation and in numerical simulations with several network topologies. We\nalso investigate the influence on the agent dynamics of two competing external\nfields, periodically broadcasting different messages. In finite regions of the\nparameter space we observe periodic equilibrium states in which the average\nopinion densities are reversed with respect to naive expectations. Such\nequilibria occur in two cases: (i) when the frequencies of the competing\nmessages are different but close to each other; (ii) when the frequencies are\nequal and the relative time shift of the messages does not exceed half a\nperiod. We interpret the observed phenomena as a result of the interplay\nbetween the external fields and the internal dynamics of the agents and\nconclude that, depending on the model parameters, the naming game is consistent\nwith scenarios of first- or second-mover advantage (to borrow an expression\nfrom the jargon of business strategy).\n", "  Calculating the abundance of thermally produced dark matter particles has\nbecome a standard procedure, with sophisticated methods guaranteeing a\nprecision that matches the percent-level accuracy in the observational\ndetermination of the dark matter density. Here, we point out that one of the\nmain assumptions in the commonly adopted formalism, namely local thermal\nequilibrium during the freeze-out of annihilating dark matter particles, does\nnot have to be satisfied in general. We present two methods for how to deal\nwith such situations, in which the kinetic decoupling of dark matter happens so\nearly that it interferes with the chemical decoupling process: i) an\napproximate treatment in terms of a coupled system of differential equations\nfor the leading momentum moments of the dark matter distribution, and ii) a\nfull numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation in phase-space. For\nillustration, we apply these methods to the case of Scalar Singlet dark matter.\nWe explicitly show that even in this simple model the prediction for the dark\nmatter abundance can be affected by up to one order of magnitude compared to\nthe traditional treatment.\n", "  The strong corrections to the R-ratio of electron-positron annihilation into\nhadrons are studied at the higher-loop levels. Specifically, the essentials of\ncontinuation of the spacelike perturbative results into the timelike domain are\nelucidated. The derivation of a general form of the commonly employed\napproximate expression for the R-ratio (which constitutes its truncated\nre-expansion at high energies) is delineated, the appearance of the pertinent\n$\\pi^2$-terms is expounded, and their basic features are examined. It is\ndemonstrated that the validity range of such approximation is strictly limited\nto $\\sqrt{s}/\\Lambda > \\exp(\\pi/2) \\simeq 4.81$ and that it converges rather\nslowly when the energy scale approaches this value. The spectral function\nrequired for the proper calculation of the R-ratio is explicitly derived and\nits properties at the higher-loop levels are studied. The developed method of\ncalculation of the spectral function enables one to obtain the explicit\nexpression for the latter at an arbitrary loop level. By making use of the\nderived spectral function the proper expression for the R-ratio is calculated\nup to the five-loop level and its properties are examined. It is shown that the\nloop convergence of the proper expression for the R-ratio is better than that\nof its commonly employed approximation. The impact of the omitted higher-order\n$\\pi^2$-terms on the latter is also discussed.\n", "  Magnetic fields play important roles in many astrophysical processes.\nHowever, there is no universal diagnostic for the magnetic fields in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) and each magnetic tracer has its limitation. Any new\ndetection method is thus valuable. Theoretical studies have shown that\nsubmillimetre fine-structure lines are polarised due to atomic alignment by\nUltraviolet (UV) photon-excitation, which opens up a new avenue to probe\ninterstellar magnetic fields. We will, for the first time, perform synthetic\nobservations on the simulated three-dimensional ISM to demonstrate the\nmeasurability of the polarisation of submillimetre atomic lines. The maximum\npolarisation for different absorption and emission lines expected from various\nsources, including Star-Forming Regions (SFRs) are provided. Our results\ndemonstrate that the polarisation of submillimetre atomic lines is a powerful\nmagnetic tracer and add great value to the observational studies of the\nsubmilimetre astronomy.\n", "  Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) is a recently proposed computational\nimaging technique with both high resolution and wide field-of-view. In current\nFP experimental setup, the dark-field images with high-angle illuminations are\neasily submerged by stray light and background noise due to the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio, thus significantly degrading the reconstruction quality\nand also imposing a major restriction on the synthetic numerical aperture (NA)\nof the FP approach. To this end, an overall and systematic data preprocessing\nscheme for noise removal from FP's raw dataset is provided, which involves\nsampling analysis as well as underexposed/overexposed treatments, then followed\nby the elimination of unknown stray light and suppression of inevitable\nbackground noise, especially Gaussian noise and CCD dark current in our\nexperiments. The reported non-parametric scheme facilitates great enhancements\nof the FP's performance, which has been demonstrated experimentally that the\nbenefits of noise removal by these methods far outweigh its defects of\nconcomitant signal loss. In addition, it could be flexibly cooperated with the\nexisting state-of-the-art algorithms, producing a stronger robustness of the FP\napproach in various applications.\n", "  Besides the unitarity and symmetry requirements for a multi-resonance\nscattering amplitude, several other natural conditions can easily exclude\nunrealistic proposals. In particular, the behaviour of singularities under the\nvariation of model parameters yields important information. We discuss how\nresonance poles should move in the complex-energy plane when coupling constants\nand masses are varied, how resonances above threshold can turn into bound\nstates below threshold and how the light-quark spectrum can be turned into the\nspectrum of heavy quarks, with one and the same analytic expression for the\nscattering amplitude. Moreover, it is shown that perturbative approximations\nusually do not satisfy those natural conditions.\n", "  This article covers thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models that are\nsuitable for the analysis of wetting, adsorption, and related interfacial\nphenomena in colloidal and multiphase systems. Particular emphasis is made on\ndescribing crucial physical assumptions and the validity range of the described\ntheoretical approaches and predictive models. The classical sharp interface\ntreatment of thermodynamic systems where a perfectly smooth surface is assumed\nto separate homogeneous phases can present significant limitations when\nanalyzing systems that are subject to thermal motion and present multiple\nmetastable states caused by interfacial heterogeneities of nanoscale\ndimensions. Mesoscopic approaches such as stochastic Langevin dynamics can\nextend the application of sharp interface models to a wide variety of systems\nexhibiting metastability as they undergo thermal motion. For such metastable\nsystems, dynamic and kinetic equations can describe the evolution of observable\n(macroscopic) variables as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium.\nSufficiently close to equilibrium, Kramers theory of thermally activated escape\nfrom metastable states can be effectively employed to describe diverse wetting\nand interfacial processes via kinetic equations. Future directions for further\nadvancement and application of thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models are\nbriefly discussed in the context of current technological developments\ninvolving nanoparticles, nanofluidics, and nanostructured surfaces.\n", "  We study both experimentally and theoretically the dynamics of chemically\nself-propelled Janus colloids moving atop a two-dimensional crystalline\nsurface. The surface is a hexagonally close-packed monolayer of colloidal\nparticles of the same size as the mobile one. The dynamics of the\nself-propelled colloid reflects the competition between hindered diffusion due\nto the periodic surface and enhanced diffusion due to active motion. Which\ncontribution dominates depends on the propulsion strength, which can be\nsystematically tuned by changing the concentration of a chemical fuel. The\nmean-square displacements obtained from the experiment exhibit enhanced\ndiffusion at long lag times. Our experimental data are consistent with a\nLangevin model for the effectively two-dimensional translational motion of an\nactive Brownian particle in a periodic potential, combining the confining\neffects of gravity and the crystalline surface with the free rotational\ndiffusion of the colloid. Approximate analytical predictions are made for the\nmean-square displacement describing the crossover from free Brownian motion at\nshort times to active diffusion at long times. The results are in\nsemi-quantitative agreement with numerical results of a refined Langevin model\nthat treats translational and rotational degrees of freedom on the same\nfooting.\n", "  We report the new exact results on one of the best studied models in\nstatistical physics: the classical antiferromagnetic Ising chain in a magnetic\nfield. We show that the model possesses an infinite cascade of thermal phase\ntransitions (also known as \"disorder lines\" or geometric phase transitions).\nThe phase transition is signalled by a change of asymptotic behavior of the\nnonlocal string-string correlation functions when their monotonous decay\nbecomes modulated by incommensurate oscillations. The transitions occur for\nrarefied ($m$-periodic) strings with arbitrary odd $m$. We propose a duality\ntransformation which maps the Ising chain onto the $m$-leg Ising tube with\nnearest-neighbor couplings along the legs and the plaquette four-spin\ninteractions of adjacent legs. Then the $m$-string correlation functions of the\nIsing chain are mapped onto the two-point spin-spin correlation functions along\nthe legs of the $m$-leg tube. We trace the origin of these cascades of phase\ntransitions to the lines of the Lee-Yang zeros of the Ising chain in\n$m$-periodic complex magnetic field, allowing us to relate these zeros to the\nobservable (and potentially measurable) quantities.\n", "  A suite of detectors around the world is poised to measure the\nflavor-energy-time evolution of the ten-second burst of neutrinos from a\ncore-collapse supernova occurring in the Milky Way or nearby. Next-generation\ndetectors to be built in the next decade will have enhanced flavor sensitivity\nand statistics. Not only will the observation of this burst allow us to peer\ninside the dense matter of the extreme event and learn about the collapse\nprocesses and the birth of the remnant, but the neutrinos will bring\ninformation about neutrino properties themselves. This review surveys some of\nthe physical signatures that the currently-unknown neutrino mass pattern will\nimprint on the observed neutrino events at Earth, emphasizing the most robust\nand least model-dependent signatures of mass ordering.\n", "  We study the dynamics of excitonic insulators coupled to phonons. Without\nphonon couplings, the linear response is given by the damped amplitude\noscillations of the order parameter with frequency equal to the minimum band\ngap. A phonon coupling to the interband transfer integral induces two types of\nlong-lived collective oscillations of the amplitude, one originating from the\nphonon dynamics and the other from the phase mode, which becomes massive. We\nshow that even for small phonon coupling, a photo-induced enhancement of the\nexciton condensation and the gap can be realized. Using the Anderson\npseudo-spin picture, we argue that the origin of the enhancement is a\ncooperative effect of the massive phase mode and the Hartree shift induced by\nthe photo excitation. We also discuss how the enhancement of the order and the\ncollective modes can be observed with time-resolved photo-emission\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We demonstrate that Kondo-Heisenberg systems, consisting of itinerant\nelectrons and localized magnetic moments (Kondo impurities), can be used as a\nprincipally new platform to realize scalar chiral spin order. The underlying\nphysics is governed by a competition of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kosuya-Yosida\n(RKKY) indirect exchange interaction between the local moments with the direct\nHeisenberg one. When the direct exchange is weak and RKKY dominates the\nisotropic system is in the disordered phase. A moderately large direct exchange\nleads to an Ising-type phase transition to the phase with chiral spin order.\nOur finding paves the way towards pioneering experimental realizations of the\nchiral spin liquid in low dimensional systems with spontaneously broken time\nreversal symmetry.\n", "  When deriving a master equation for a multipartite weakly-interacting open\nquantum systems, dissipation is often addressed \\textit{locally} on each\ncomponent, i.e. ignoring the coherent couplings, which are later added `by\nhand'. Although simple, the resulting local master equation (LME) is known to\nbe thermodynamically inconsistent. Otherwise, one may always obtain a\nconsistent \\textit{global} master equation (GME) by working on the energy basis\nof the full interacting Hamiltonian. Here, we consider a two-node `quantum\nwire' connected to two heat baths. The stationary solution of the LME and GME\nare obtained and benchmarked against the exact result. Importantly, in our\nmodel, the validity of the GME is constrained by the underlying secular\napproximation. Whenever this breaks down (for resonant weakly-coupled nodes),\nwe observe that the LME, in spite of being thermodynamically flawed: (a)\npredicts the correct steady state, (b) yields the exact asymptotic heat\ncurrents, and (c) reliably reflects the correlations between the nodes. In\ncontrast, the GME fails at all three tasks. Nonetheless, as the inter-node\ncoupling grows, the LME breaks down whilst the GME becomes correct. Hence, the\nglobal and local approach may be viewed as \\textit{complementary} tools, best\nsuited to different parameter regimes.\n", "  Manipulating topological disclination networks that arise in a\nsymmetry-breaking phase transfor- mation in widely varied systems including\nanisotropic materials can potentially lead to the design of novel materials\nlike conductive microwires, self-assembled resonators, and active anisotropic\nmatter. However, progress in this direction is hindered by a lack of control of\nthe kinetics and microstructure due to inherent complexity arising from\ncompeting energy and topology. We have studied thermal and electrokinetic\neffects on disclinations in a three-dimensional nonabsorbing nematic material\nwith a positive and negative sign of the dielectric anisotropy. The electric\nflux lines are highly non-uniform in uniaxial media after an electric field\nbelow the Fr\\'eedericksz threshold is switched on, and the kinetics of the\ndisclination lines is slowed down. In biaxial media, depending on the sign of\nthe dielectric anisotropy, apart from the slowing down of the disclination\nkinetics, a non-uniform electric field filters out disclinations of different\ntopology by inducing a kinetic asymmetry. These results enhance the current\nunderstanding of forced disclination networks and establish the pre- sented\nmethod, which we call fluctuating electronematics, as a potentially useful tool\nfor designing materials with novel properties in silico.\n", "  We investigated the impact of uncertainties in neutron-capture and weak\nreactions (on heavy elements) on the s-process nucleosynthesis in low-mass\nstars and massive stars using a Monte-Carlo based approach. We performed\nextensive nuclear reaction network calculations that include newly evaluated\ntemperature-dependent upper and lower limits for the individual reaction rates.\nWe found beta-decay rate uncertainties affect only a few nuclei near s-process\nbranchings, whereas most of the uncertainty in the final abundances is caused\nby uncertainties in the neutron capture rates. We suggest a list of uncertain\nrates as candidates for improved measurement by future experiments.\n", "  We show that neutral current (NC) measurements at neutrino detectors can play\na valuable role in the search for new physics. Such measurements have certain\nintrinsic features and advantages that can fruitfully be combined with the\nusual well-studied charged lepton detection channels in order to probe the\npresence of new interactions or new light states. In addition to the fact that\nNC events are immune to uncertainties in standard model neutrino mixing and\nmass parameters, they can have small matter effects and superior rates since\nall three flavours participate. We also show, as a general feature, that NC\nmeasurements provide access to different combinations of CP phases and mixing\nparameters compared to CC measurements at both long and short baseline\nexperiments. Using the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) as an\nillustrative setting, we demonstrate the capability of NC measurements to break\ndegeneracies arising in CC measurements, allowing us, in principle, to\ndistinguish between new physics that violates three flavour unitarity and that\nwhich does not. Finally, we show that NC measurements can enable us to restrict\nnew physics parameters that are not easily constrained by CC measurements.\n", "  We use the dynamic length and time scale separation in suspensions to\nformulate a general description of colloidal thermophoresis. Our approach\nallows an unambiguous definition of separate contributions to the colloidal\nflux and clarifies the physical mechanisms behind non-equilibrium motion of\ncolloids. In particular, we derive an expression for the interfacial force\ndensity that drives single-particle thermophoresis in non-ideal fluids. The\nissuing relations for the transport coefficients explicitly show that\ninterfacial thermophoresis has a hydrodynamic character that cannot be\nexplained by a purely thermodynamic consideration. Our treatment generalises\nthe results from other existing approaches, giving them a clear interpretation\nwithin the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n", "  We study fourfold rotation invariant gapped topological systems with\ntime-reversal symmetry in two and three dimensions ($d=2,3$). We show that in\nboth cases nontrivial topology is manifested by the presence of the\n$(d-2)$-dimensional edge states, existing at a point in 2D or along a line in\n3D. For fermion systems without interaction, the bulk topological invariants\nare given in terms of the Wannier centers of filled bands, and can be readily\ncalculated using a Fu-Kane-like formula when inversion symmetry is also\npresent. The theory is extended to strongly interacting systems through\nexplicit construction of microscopic models having robust $(d-2)$-dimensional\nedge states.\n", "  We report the observation of extraordinarily robust zero-resistance\nsuperconductivity in the pressurized (TaNb)0.67(HfZrTi)0.33 high entropy alloy\n- a new kind of material with a body-centered cubic crystal structure made from\nfive randomly distributed transition metal elements. The transition to\nsuperconductivity (TC) increases from an initial temperature of 7.7 K at\nambient pressure to 10 K at ~ 60 GPa, and then slowly decreases to 9 K by 190.6\nGPa, a pressure that falls within that of the outer core of the earth. We infer\nthat the continuous existence of the zero-resistance superconductivity from one\natmosphere up to such a high pressure requires a special combination of\nelectronic and mechanical characteristics. This high entropy alloy\nsuperconductor thus may have a bright future for applications under extreme\nconditions, and also poses a challenge for understanding the underlying quantum\nphysics.\n", "  We reexamine canonical quantization of the gauged Rarita-Schwinger theory\nusing the extended theory, incorporating a dimension $\\frac{1}{2}$ auxiliary\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ field $\\Lambda$, in which there is an exact off-shell gauge\ninvariance. In $\\Lambda=0$ gauge, which reduces to the original unextended\ntheory, our results agree with those found by Johnson and Sudarshan, and later\nverified by Velo and Zwanziger, which give a canonical Rarita-Schwinger field\nDirac bracket that is singular for small gauge fields. In gauge covariant\nradiation gauge, the Dirac bracket of the Rarita-Schwinger fields is\nnonsingular, but does not correspond to a positive semi-definite\nanticommutator, and the Dirac bracket of the auxiliary fields has a singularity\nof the same form as found in the unextended theory. These results indicate that\ngauged Rarita-Schwinger theory is somewhat pathological, and cannot be\ncanonically quantized within a conventional positive semi-definite metric\nHilbert space. We leave open the questions of whether consistent quantizations\ncan be achieved by using an indefinite metric Hilbert space, by path integral\nmethods, or by appropriate couplings to conventional dimension $\\frac{3}{2}$\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ fields.\n", "  We study the holographic entanglement entropy of spatial regions with corners\nin the AdS4/BCFT3 correspondence by considering three dimensional boundary\nconformal field theories whose boundary is a timelike plane. We compute\nanalytically the corner function corresponding to an infinite wedge having one\nedge on the boundary. A relation between this corner function and the\nholographic one point function of the stress tensor is observed. An analytic\nexpression for the corner function of an infinite wedge having only its tip on\nthe boundary is also provided. This formula requires to find the global minimum\namong two extrema of the area functional. The corresponding critical\nconfigurations of corners are studied. The results have been checked against a\nnumerical analysis performed by computing the area of the minimal surfaces\nanchored to some finite domains containing corners.\n", "  The Area Theorem states that when a short optical pulse drives a quantum\ntwo-level system, it undergoes Rabi oscillations in the probability of\nscattering a single photon. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the\nArea Theorem as both the pulse length becomes non-negligible and for certain\npulse areas. Using simple quantum trajectories, we provide an analytic\napproximation to the photon emission dynamics of a two-level system. Our model\nprovides an intuitive way to understand re-excitation, which elucidates the\nmechanism behind the two-photon emission events that can spoil single-photon\nemission. We experimentally measure the emission statistics from a\nsemiconductor quantum dot, acting as a two-level system, and show good\nagreement with our simple model for short pulses. Additionally, the model\nclearly explains our recent results [K. Fischer and L. Hanschke, et al., Nature\nPhysics (2017)] showing dominant two-photon emission from a two-level system\nfor pulses with interaction areas equal to an even multiple of $\\pi$.\n", "  We present a two-dimensional lattice model for quantum spin-1/2 for which the\nlow-energy limit is governed by four flavors of strongly interacting Majorana\nfermions. We study this low-energy effective theory using two alternative\napproaches. The first consists of a mean-field approximation. The second\nconsists of a Random Phase approximation (RPA) for the single-particle Green's\nfunctions of the Majorana fermions built from their exact forms in a certain\none-dimensional limit. The resulting phase diagram consists of two competing\nchiral phases, one with Abelian and the other with non-Abelian topological\norder, separated by a continuous phase transition. Remarkably, the Majorana\nfermions propagate in the two-dimensional bulk, as in the Kitaev model for a\nspin liquid on the honeycomb lattice. We identify the vison fields, which are\nmobile (they are static in the Kitaev model) domain walls propagating along\nonly one of the two space directions.\n", "  We propose a new audio signal encryption scheme based on the chaotic H\\'enon\nmap. The scheme mainly comprises two phases: one is the preprocessing stage\nwhere the audio signal is transformed into a data by the lifting wavelet scheme\nand the other in which the transformed data is encrypted by chaotic data set\nand hyperbolic functions. Furthermore, we use dynamic keys and consider the key\nspace size to be large enough to resist any kind of cryptographic attacks. A\nstatistical investigation is also made to test the security and the efficiency\nof the proposed scheme.\n", "  In order to meet the requirements of the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), it\nwill be necessary to replace the current tracker of the ATLAS experiment.\nTherefore, a new all-silicon tracking detector is being developed, the\nso-called Inner Tracker (ITk). The use of quad chip modules is intended in its\npixel region. These modules consist of a silicon sensor that forms a unit along\nwith four read-out chips. The current ATLAS pixel detector consists of planar\nn-in-n silicon pixel sensors. Similar sensors and four FE-I4 read-out chips\nwere assembled to first prototypes of planar n-in-n quad modules. The main\nfocus of the investigation of these modules was the region between the read-out\nchips, especially the central area between all four read-out chips. There are\nspecial pixel cells placed on the sensor which cover the gap between the\nread-out chips. This contribution focuses on the characterization of a\nnon-irradiated device, including important sensor characteristics, charge\ncollection determined with radioactive sources as well as hit efficiency\nmeasurements, performed in the laboratory and at testbeams. In addition, first\nlaboratory results of an irradiated device are presented.\n", "  In this special issue article, I review some of the accomplishments of the\nchiral mean field (CMF) model, which contains nucleon, hyperon, and quark\ndegrees of freedom, and its applications to proto-neutron and neutron stars. I\nalso present a set of equation of state and particle population tables built\nusing the CMF model subject to physical constraints necessary to reproduce\ndifferent environments, such as those present in cold neutron stars,\ncore-collapse supernova explosions and different stages of compact star\nmergers.\n", "  We consider di-jet production in hadron collisions where a transverse veto is\nimposed on radiation for (pseudo-)rapidities in the central region only, where\nthis central region is defined with rapidity cutoff. For the case where the\ntransverse measurement (e.g., transverse energy or min $p_T$ for jet veto) is\nparametrically larger relative to the typical transverse momentum beyond the\ncutoff, the cross section is insensitive to the cutoff parameter and is\nfactorized in terms of collinear and soft degrees of freedom. The virtuality\nfor these degrees of freedom is set by the transverse measurement, as in\ntypical transverse-momentum dependent observables such as Drell-Yan, Higgs\nproduction, and the event shape broadening. This paper focuses on the other\nregion, where the typical transverse momentum below and beyond the cutoff is of\nsimilar size. In this region the rapidity cutoff further resolves soft\nradiation into (u)soft and soft-collinear radiation with different rapidities\nbut identical virtuality. This gives rise to rapidity logarithms of the\nrapidity cutoff parameter which we resum using renormalization group methods.\nWe factorize the cross section in this region in terms of soft and collinear\nfunctions in the framework of soft-collinear effective theory, then further\nrefactorize the soft function as a convolution of the (u)soft and\nsoft-collinear functions. All these functions are calculated at one-loop order.\nAs an example, we calculate a differential cross section for a specific\npartonic channel, $q q' \\to q q'$, for the jet shape angularities and show that\nthe refactorization allows us to resum the rapidity logarithms and\nsignificantly reduce theoretical uncertainties in the jet shape spectrum.\n", "  Novel order parameters for the confinement-deconfinement phase transition of\nquenched QCD and fundamentally charged scalar QCD are presented. Similar to the\nwell-known dual condensate, they are defined via generalized matter propagators\nwith $U(1)$-valued boundary conditions. The order parameters are easily\naccessible with functional methods. Their validity and accessibility is\nexplicitly demonstrated by numerical studies of the Dyson-Schwinger equations\nfor the matter propagators. Even in the case of heavy scalar matter, where the\npropagator does not show a signature of the phase transition, a discontinuity\ndue to the transition can be extracted in the order parameters, establishing\nalso fundamentally charged scalar matter as a probe for color confinement.\n", "  We obtain the exact scale invariant scattering solutions for two-dimensional\nfield theories with replicated permutational symmetry $\\mathbb{S}_q$. After\nsending to zero the number of replicas they correspond to the renormalization\ngroup fixed points of the $q$-state Potts model with quenched disorder. We find\nthat all solutions with non-zero disorder possess $q$-independent sectors,\npointing to superuniversality (i.e. symmetry independence) of some critical\nexponents. The solution corresponding to the random bond ferromagnet, for which\ndisorder vanishes as $q\\to 2$, allows for superuniversality of the correlation\nlength exponent $\\nu$ [PRL 118 (2017) 250601]. Of the two solutions which are\nstrongly disordered for all values of $q$, one is completely $q$-independent\nand accounts for the zero-temperature percolation fixed point of the randomly\nbond diluted ferromagnet. The other is the main candidate to describe the\nNishimori-like fixed point of the Potts model with $\\pm J$ disorder, and leaves\nroom for superuniversality of the magnetic exponent $\\eta$, a possibility not\nyet excluded by available numerical data.\n", "  As it is known, neither classical logical conjunction \"and\" nor classical\nlogical alternative \"either...or\" can replace \"+\" representing a linear\nsuperposition of two quantum states. Therefore, to provide a logical account of\nthe quantum superposition, one must either reconsider the standard\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics (making it fit for classical bivalent\nlogic) or replace the standard logic with a deviant logic suitable for\ndescribing the superposition. In the paper, a supervaluation approach to the\ndescription of the quantum superposition is considered. In accordance with this\napproach, the indefinite propositions, which correspond to the superposition\nstates, lack truth-values of any kind even granting that their compounds (such\nas logical alternative \"either...or\") can have truth-values. As an\nillustration, the supervaluationist account of the superposition of spin states\nis presented.\n", "  We numerically construct translationally invariant quasi-conserved operators\nwith maximum range M which best-commute with a non-integrable quantum spin\nchain Hamiltonian, up to M = 12. In the large coupling limit, we find that the\nresidual norm of the commutator of the quasi-conserved operator decays\nexponentially with its maximum range M at small M, and turns into a slower\ndecay at larger M. This quasi-conserved operator can be understood as a dressed\ntotal \"spin-z\" operator, by comparing with the perturbative Schrieffer-Wolff\nconstruction developed to high order reaching essentially the same maximum\nrange. We also examine the operator inverse participation ratio of the\noperator, which suggests its localization in the operator Hilbert space. The\noperator also shows almost exponentially decaying profile at short distance,\nwhile the long-distance behavior is not clear due to limitations of our\nnumerical calculation. Further dynamical simulation confirms that the\nprethermalization-equilibrated values are described by a generalized Gibbs\nensemble that includes such quasi-conserved operator.\n", "  A new version of the $k_T$ factorization approach is formulated for the high\nenergy heavy quark production. The results are in reasonable agreement with the\nexperimental data at LHC energies.\n", "  The construction of a reaction network containing all relevant intermediates\nand elementary reactions is necessary for the accurate description of chemical\nprocesses. In the case of a complex chemical reaction (involving, for instance,\nmany reactants or highly reactive species), the size of such network may grow\nrapidly. Here, we present a computational protocol that constructs such\nreaction networks in a fully automated fashion steered in an intuitive,\ngraph-based fashion through a single graphical user interface. Starting from a\nset of initial reagents new intermediates are explored through intra- and\nintermolecular reactions of already explored intermediates or new reactants\npresented to the network. This is done by assembling reactive complexes based\non heuristic rules derived from conceptual electronic-structure theory and\nexploring the corresponding approximate reaction path. A subsequent path\nrefinement leads to a minimum-energy path which connects the new intermediate\nto the existing ones to form a connected reaction network. Tree traversal\nalgorithms are then employed to detect reaction channels and catalytic cycles.\nWe apply our protocol to the formose reaction to study different pathways of\nsugar formation and to rationalize its autocatalytic nature.\n", "  We introduce the concept of self-adaptive tensor network states (SATNS) based\non multi-site correlators. The SATNS ansatz gradually extends its variational\nspace incorporating the most important next-order correlators into the ansatz\nfor the wave function. The selection of these correlators is guided by\nentanglement-entropy measures from quantum information theory. By sequentially\nintroducing variational parameters and adjusting them to the system under\nstudy, the SATNS ansatz achieves to keep their number significantly smaller\nthan the total number of full-configuration interaction parameters. The SATNS\nansatz is studied for manganocene in its lowest-energy sextet and doublet\nstates, the latter of which is known to be difficult to describe. It is shown\nthat the SATNS parametrization solves the convergence issues found for previous\ncorrelator-based tensor network states.\n", "  Engineering local angular momentum of structured light fields in real space\nenables unprecedented applications in many fields, in particular for the\nrealization of unidirectional robust transport in topological photonic crystals\nwith non-trivial Berry vortex in momentum space. Here, we show transverse\nangular momentum modes in silicon topological photonic crystals when\nconsidering transverse electric polarization. Excited by a chiral external\nsource with either transverse spin or orbital angular momentum, robust light\nflow propagating along opposite directions was observed in several kinds of\nsharp-turn interfaces between two topologically-distinct silicon photonic\ncrystals. A transverse orbital angular momentum mode with alternating-sign\ntopological charge was found at the boundary of such two photonic crystals. In\naddition, we also found that unidirectional transport is robust to the working\nfrequency even when the ring-size or location of pseudo-spin source varies in a\ncertain range, leading to the superiority of broadband photonic device. These\nfindings enable for making use of transverse angular momentum, a kind of degree\nof freedom, to achieve unidirectional robust transport in telecom region and\nother potential applications in integrated photonic circuits such as on-chip\nrobust delay line.\n", "  Temporal correlations of time series or event sequences in natural and social\nphenomena have been characterized by power-law decaying autocorrelation\nfunctions with decaying exponent $\\gamma$. Such temporal correlations can be\nunderstood in terms of power-law distributed interevent times with exponent\n$\\alpha$, and/or correlations between interevent times. The latter, often\ncalled correlated bursts, has recently been studied by measuring power-law\ndistributed bursty trains with exponent $\\beta$. A scaling relation between\n$\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ has been established for the uncorrelated interevent\ntimes, while little is known about the effects of correlated interevent times\non temporal correlations. In order to study these effects, we devise the\nbursty-get-burstier model for correlated bursts, by which one can tune the\ndegree of correlations between interevent times, while keeping the same\ninterevent time distribution. We numerically find that sufficiently strong\ncorrelations between interevent times could violate the scaling relation\nbetween $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ for the uncorrelated case. A non-trivial\ndependence of $\\gamma$ on $\\beta$ is also found for some range of $\\alpha$. The\nimplication of our results is discussed in terms of the hierarchical\norganization of bursty trains at various timescales.\n", "  We consider the reduced dynamics of a small quantum system in interaction\nwith a reservoir when the initial state is factorized. We present a rigorous\nderivation of a GKLS master equation in the weak-coupling limit for a generic\nbath, which is not assumed to have a bosonic or fermionic nature, and whose\nreference state is not necessarily thermal. The crucial assumption is a\nreservoir state endowed with a mixing property: the n-point connected\ncorrelation function of the interaction must be asymptotically bounded by the\nproduct of two-point functions (clustering property).\n", "  A novel equation of state with the surface tension induced by particles'\ninteractions was generalized to describe the properties of the neutron stars\n(NSs). In this equation the interaction between particles occurs via the hard\ncore repulsion by taking into account the proper volumes of particles.\nRecently, this model was successfully applied to the description of the\nproperties of nuclear and hadron matter created in collisions of nucleons. The\nnew approach is free of causality problems and is fully thermodynamically\nconsistent, which enables us to use it for the investigation of the strongly\ninteracting matter phase-diagram properties in a wide range of temperatures and\nbaryon densities, including NSs. Here, we have calculated the mass-radius\nrelations for a compact star using the Tolmann-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV)\nequation for two sets of parameters that satisfy the existing constraints.\nAccordingly, we found parameter values that are in good agreement with the same\nones obtained from the nuclear-nuclear collision data analysis. The\nastrophysical constraints suggest that the hard core radius of baryons can vary\nbetween 0.425 fm and 0.476 fm.\n", "  Compressed sensing is an important problem in many fields of science and\nengineering. It reconstructs signals by finding sparse solutions to\nunderdetermined linear equations. In this work we propose a deterministic and\nnon-parametric algorithm SSD (Shortest-Solution guided Decimation) to construct\nsupport of the sparse solution under the guidance of the dense least-squares\nsolution of the recursively decimated linear equation. The most significant\nfeature of SSD is its insensitivity to correlations in the sampling matrix.\nUsing extensive numerical experiments we show that SSD greatly outperforms\nL1-norm based methods, Orthogonal Least Squares, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit,\nand Approximate Message Passing when the sampling matrix contains strong\ncorrelations. This nice property of correlation tolerance makes SSD a versatile\nand robust tool for different types of real-world signal acquisition tasks.\n", "  We consider the problem of characterising the spatial extent of a composite\nlight source using the superresolution imaging technique when the centroid of\nthe source is not known precisely. We show that the essential features of this\nproblem can be mapped onto a simple qubit model for joint estimation of a phase\nshift and a dephasing strength.\n", "  Coarse-grained models can be of great help to address the problem of\nstructure prediction in nucleic acids. On one hand they can make the prediction\nmore efficient, while on the other hand, they can also help to identify the\nessential degrees of freedom and interactions for the description of a number\nof structures. With the aim to provide an all-atom representation in an\nexplicit solvent to the predictions of our SPlit and conQueR (SPQR)\ncoarse-grained model of RNA, we recently introduced a backmapping procedure\nwhich enforces the predicted structure into an atomistic one by means of\nsteered Molecular Dynamics. These simulations minimize the ERMSD, a particular\nmetric which deals exclusively with the relative arrangement of nucleobases,\nbetween the atomistic representation and the target structure. In this paper,\nwe explore the effects of this approach on the resulting interaction networks\nand backbone conformations by applying it on a set of fragments using as a\ntarget their native structure. We find that the geometry of the target\nstructures can be reliably recovered, with limitations in the regions with\nunpaired bases such as bulges. In addition, we observe that the folding pathway\ncan also change depending on the parameters used in the definition of the ERMSD\nand the use of other metrics such as the RMSD.\n", "  In this study an array of eight 6 mm x 6 mm area SiPMs was coupled to the end\nof a long plastic scintillator counter which was exposed to a 2.5 GeV/c muon\nbeam at the CERN PS. Timing characteristics of bars with dimensions 150 cm x 6\ncm x 1 cm and 120 cm x 11 cm x 2.5 cm have been studied. An 8-channel SiPM\nanode readout ASIC (MUSIC R1) based on a novel low input impedance current\nconveyor has been used to read out and amplify SiPMs independently and sum the\nsignals at the end. Prospects for applications in large-scale particle physics\ndetectors with timing resolution below 100 ps are provided in light of the\nresults.\n", "  In the present work we investigate evolving wormhole configurations described\nby a constant redshift function in Einstein-Cartan theory ({{\\sf ECT}}). The\nmatter content consists of a Weyssenhoff fluid along with an anisotropic matter\nwhich together generalize the anisotropic energy momentum tensor in general\nrelativity ({{\\sf GR}}) in order to include the effects of intrinsic angular\nmomentum (spin) of particles. Using a generalized Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n({\\sf FRW}) spacetime, we derive analytical evolving wormhole geometries by\nassuming a particular equation of state ({{\\sf EoS}}) for energy density and\npressure profiles. We introduce exact asymptotically flat and anti-de Sitter\nspacetimes that admit traversable wormholes and respect energy conditions\nthroughout the spacetime. The rate of expansion of these evolving wormholes is\ndetermined only by the Friedmann equation in the presence of spin effects.\n", "  Nanosatellites, and especially CubeSats, at low earth orbits (LEOs) are a low\ncost option for monitoring atmospheric and environmental conditions around\nEarth. For instance, data for weather forecast reports can be obtained\nperiodically with these kind of small satellites. Therefore, to academic\ninstitutions, universities, etc., this fact makes nanosatellites a very\nattractive way for researching with a moderate budget.\n  In this project we compute orbital lifetimes (or simply lifetimes) for\nhypothetical missions involving nanosatellites at LEO, focusing our attention\non exploring regions along the equatorial line. Thus, in the framework of\norbital mechanics, we show the viability for these kind of missions in a long\nand a short term. Applications are projected for countries in northern South\nAmerica, central Africa and islands/countries in southern Asia.\n  To compute lifetimes, we take into account three effects: i) gravitational,\nii) Earth deformations and iii) atmospheric density. These effects are included\nin the motion equation for a nanosatellite around Earth. After solving this\nequation for initial altitudes in 200-800 km above mean sea level (AMSL), we\ncompute and report flight times to arrive at 150 km AMSL. These results are\ndefined here as lifetimes and they are calculated for different\natmospheric-density profiles according to experimental data and estimations.\n  In conclusion, we find lowest and highest lifetimes for hypothetical missions\ninvolving small satellites at LEO orbiting along the equatorial line, and\npropose upper limits for density relative uncertainties in order to estimate\nreliable lifetimes.\n", "  Prior to the arrival of Cassini-Huygens, aerosol production in Titan's\natmosphere was believed to begin in the stratosphere where chemical processes\nare predominantly initiated by FUV radiation. However, measurements taken by\nCassini UVIS and CAPS indicate that haze formation initiates in the\nthermosphere where there is a greater flux of EUV photons and energetic\nparticles available to initiate chemical reactions, including the destruction\nof N2. The discovery of previously unpredicted nitrogen species in Titan's\natmosphere by Cassini INMS indicates that nitrogen participates in the\nchemistry to a much greater extent than was appreciated before Cassini. The\ndegree of nitrogen in the haze is important for understanding the diversity of\nmolecules present in Titan's atmosphere and on its surface. We have conducted a\nseries of simulation experiments using either spark discharge or FUV photons to\ninitiate chemistry in CH4/N2 gas mixtures (0.01% CH4/99.99% N2 to 10% CH4/90%\nN2). We obtained in situ real-time measurements using an HR-ToF-AMS to measure\nthe particle composition as a function of particle size and a PIT-MS to measure\nthe composition of gas phase products. These two techniques allow us to\ninvestigate the effect of energy source and initial CH4 concentration on the\ndegree of nitrogen incorporation in both the gas and solid phase products. The\nresults presented here confirm that FUV photons produce not only solid phase\nnitrogen bearing products but also gas phase nitrogen species. We find that in\nboth the gas and solid phase, nitrogen is found in nitriles rather than amines\nand both the gas phase and solid phase products are composed primarily of\nmolecules with a low degree of aromaticity. The UV experiments reproduce the\nabsolute abundances measured in Titan's stratosphere for a number of gas phase\nspecies including C4H2, C6H6, HCN, CH3CN, HC3N, and C2H5CN. [Edited for length]\n", "  This paper presents a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with heptagonal core and\nheptagonal cladding for dispersion compensation. Different optical properties\nof the suggested PCF are explored using the finite element method (FEM). The\nproposed dispersion compensating PCF (DC-PCF) exhibits a very large negative\nchromatic dispersion of $-940 ps/(nm-km)$ at $1550 nm$ wavelength. The overall\ndispersion of the DC-PCF is $-420.1$ to $-1160 ps/(nm-km)$ in the wavelength\nrange of $1390$ to $1700 nm$ ($310 nm$ band). The relative dispersion slope is\n$0.0036 nm^{-1}$ which is a perfect match with the standard single mode fibers.\nMoreover, it exhibits a very low confinement loss of about $10^{-5} dB/km$ and\nlow nonlinearity of $45 W^{-1}km^{-1}$ at $1550 nm$ wavelength. Since the\nsuggested DC-PCF has very high negative dispersion and low nonlinearity, it can\nbe a potential candidate for broadband dispersion compensation in fiber-optic\ncommunication.\n", "  Extended electroweak scalar sectors containing several doublet multiplets\nrequire flavour-aligned Yukawa matrices to prevent the appearance at tree level\nof unwanted flavour- changing neutral-current transitions. We analyse the\nmisalignment induced by one-loop quantum corrections and explore possible\ngeneralizations of the alignment condition and their compatibility with current\nexperimental constraints. The hypothesis of flavour alignment at a high scale\nturns out to be consistent with all known phenomenological tests.\n", "  The renormalization group approach and the operator product expansion\ntechnique are applied to the model of a tracer field advected by the\nNavier-Stokes velocity ensemble for a compressible fluid. The model is\nconsidered in the vicinity of the specific space dimension $d=4$. The\nproperties of the equal-time structure functions are investigated. The\nmultifractal behaviour of various correlation functions is established. All\ncalculations are performed in the leading one-loop approximation.\n", "  The effective Hamiltonian for the linear $E\\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller model\ndescribes the coupling between two electronic states and two vibrational modes\nin molecules or bulk crystal impurities. While in the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation the Berry curvature has a delta function singularity at the\nconical intersection of the potential energy surfaces, the exact Berry\ncurvature is a smooth peaked function. Numerical calculations revealed that the\ncharacteristic width of the peak is $\\hbar K^{1/2}/gM^{1/2}$, where $M$ is the\nmass associated with the relevant nuclear coordinates, $K$ is the effective\ninternuclear spring constant and $g$ is the electronic-vibrational coupling.\nThis result is confirmed here by an asymptotic analysis of the\n$M\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit, an interesting outcome of which is the emergence of\na separation of length scales. Being based on the exact electron-nuclear\nfactorization, our analysis does not make any reference to adiabatic potential\nenergy surfaces or nonadiabatic couplings. It is also shown that the Ham\nreduction factors for the model can be derived from the exact geometric phase.\n", "  Key performance characteristics are demonstrated for the microwave SQUID\nmultiplexer ($\\mu$MUX) coupled to transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers that\nhave been optimized for cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. In a\n64-channel demonstration, we show that the $\\mu$MUX produces a white, input\nreferred current noise level of 29~pA$/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ at -77~dB microwave\nprobe tone power, which is well below expected fundamental detector and photon\nnoise sources for a ground-based CMB-optimized bolometer. Operated with\nnegligible photon loading, we measure 98~pA$/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the\nTES-coupled channels biased at 65% of the sensor normal resistance. This noise\nlevel is consistent with that predicted from bolometer thermal fluctuation\n(i.e., phonon) noise. Furthermore, the power spectral density exhibits a white\nspectrum at low frequencies ($\\sim$~100~mHz), which enables CMB mapping on\nlarge angular scales that constrain the physics of inflation. Additionally, we\nreport cross-talk measurements that indicate a level below 0.3%, which is less\nthan the level of cross-talk from multiplexed readout systems in deployed CMB\nimagers. These measurements demonstrate the $\\mu$MUX as a viable readout\ntechnique for future CMB imaging instruments.\n", "  Discussed here are the effects of basics graph transformations on the spectra\nof associated quantum graphs. In particular it is shown that under an edge\nswitch the spectrum of the transformed Schr\\\"odinger operator is interlaced\nwith that of the original one. By implication, under edge swap the spectra\nbefore and after the transformation, denoted by $\\{ E_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ and\n$\\{\\widetilde E_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ correspondingly, are level-2 interlaced, so\nthat $E_{n-2}\\le \\widetilde E_n\\le E_{n+2}$. The proofs are guided by\nconsiderations of the quantum graphs' discrete analogs.\n", "  We demonstrate applications of topological characteristics of oil and gas\nreservoirs considered as three-dimensional bodies to geological modeling.\n", "  Constructing simpler models, either stochastic or deterministic, for\nexploring the phenomenon of flow reversals in fluid systems is in vogue across\ndisciplines. Using direct numerical simulations and nonlinear time series\nanalysis, we illustrate that the basic nature of flow reversals in convecting\nfluids can depend on the dimensionless parameters describing the system.\nSpecifically, we find evidence of low-dimensional determinism in flow reversals\noccurring at zero Prandtl number, whereas we fail to find such signatures for\nreversals at infinite Prandtl number. Thus, even in a single system, as one\nvaries the system parameters, one can encounter reversals that are\nfundamentally different in nature. Consequently, we conclude that a single\ngeneral low-dimensional deterministic model cannot faithfully characterize flow\nreversals for every set of parameter values.\n", "  The proposed numerical method, \"FLAME-slab,\" solves electromagnetic wave\nscattering problems for aperiodic slab structures by exploiting short-range\nregularities in these structures. The computational procedure involves special\ndifference schemes with high accuracy even on coarse grids. These schemes are\nbased on Trefftz approximations, utilizing functions that locally satisfy the\ngoverning differential equations, as is done in the Flexible Local\nApproximation Method (FLAME). Radiation boundary conditions are implemented via\nFourier expansions in the air surrounding the slab. When applied to ensembles\nof slab structures with identical short-range features, such as amorphous or\nquasicrystalline lattices, the method is significantly more efficient, both in\nruntime and in memory consumption, than traditional approaches. This efficiency\nis due to the fact that the Trefftz functions need to be computed only once for\nthe whole ensemble.\n", "  Two basic routes for planetesimal formation have been proposed over the last\nfew decades. One is a classical \"slow-growth\" scenario. Another one is particle\nconcentration models, in which small pebbles are concentrated locally and then\ncollapse gravitationally to form planetesimals. Both types of models make\ncertain predictions for the size spectrum and internal structure of newly-born\nplanetesimals. We use these predictions as input to simulate collisional\nevolution of debris discs left after the gas dispersal. The debris disc\nemission as a function of a system's age computed in these simulations is\ncompared with several Spitzer and Herschel debris disc surveys around A-type\nstars. We confirm that the observed brightness evolution for the majority of\ndiscs can be reproduced by classical models. Further, we find that it is\nequally consistent with the size distribution of planetesimals predicted by\nparticle concentration models - provided the objects are loosely bound \"pebble\npiles\" as these models also predict. Regardless of the assumed planetesimal\nformation mechanism, explaining the brightest debris discs in the samples\nuncovers a \"disc mass problem.\" To reproduce such discs by collisional\nsimulations, a total mass of planetesimals of up to ~1000 Earth masses is\nrequired, which exceeds the total mass of solids available in the\nprotoplanetary progenitors of debris discs. This may indicate that stirring was\ndelayed in some of the bright discs, that giant impacts occurred recently in\nsome of them, that some systems may be younger than previously thought, or that\nnon-collisional processes contribute significantly to the dust production.\n", "  In this paper we present the measurement of charged pion two-particle\nfemtoscopic correlation functions in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, in 31 average\ntransverse mass bins, separately for positive and negative pion pairs.\nL\\'evy-shaped source distributions yield a statistically acceptable description\nof the measured correlation functions, with three physical parameters:\ncorrelation strength parameter lambda, L\\'evy index alpha and L\\'evy scale\nparameter R. The transverse mass dependence of these L\\'evy parameters is then\ninvestigated and their physical interpretation is also discussed, and the\nappearance of a new scaling variable is observed.\n", "  Polarized light microscopy, as a contrast-enhancing technique for optically\nanisotropic materials, is a method well suited for the investigation of a wide\nvariety of effects in solid-state physics, as for example birefringence in\ncrystals or the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). We present a microscopy\nsetup that combines a widefield microscope and a confocal scanning laser\nmicroscope with polarization-sensitive detectors. By using a high numerical\naperture objective, a spatial resolution of about 240 nm at a wavelength of 405\nnm is achieved. The sample is mounted on a $^4$He continuous flow cryostat\nproviding a temperature range between 4 K and 300 K, and electromagnets are\nused to apply magnetic fields of up to 800 mT with variable in-plane\norientation and 20 mT with out-of-plane orientation. Typical applications of\nthe polarizing microscope are the imaging of the in-plane and out-of-plane\nmagnetization via the longitudinal and polar MOKE, imaging of magnetic flux\nstructures in superconductors covered with a magneto-optical indicator film via\nFaraday effect or imaging of structural features, such as twin-walls in\ntetragonal SrTiO$_3$. The scanning laser microscope furthermore offers the\npossibility to gain local information on electric transport properties of a\nsample by detecting the beam-induced voltage change across a current-biased\nsample. This combination of magnetic, structural and electric imaging\ncapabilities makes the microscope a viable tool for research in the fields of\noxide electronics, spintronics, magnetism and superconductivity.\n", "  In general, small bodies of the solar system, e.g., asteroids and comets,\nhave a very irregular shape. This feature affects significantly the\ngravitational potential around these irregular bodies, which hinders dynamical\nstudies. The Poincar\\'e surface of sec- tion technique is often used to look\nfor stable and chaotic regions in two-dimensional dynamic cases. In this work,\nwe show that this tool can be useful for exploring the surroundings of\nirregular bodies such as the asteroid 4179 Toutatis. Considering a rotating\nsystem with a particle, under the effect of the gravitational field computed\nthree-dimensionally, we define a plane in the phase space to build the\nPoincar\\'e surface of sections. Despite the extra dimension, the sections\ncreated allow us to find trajec- tories and classify their stabilities. Thus,\nwe have also been able to map stable and chaotic regions, as well as to find\ncorrelations between those regions and the contri- bution of the third\ndimension of the system to the trajectory dynamics as well. As examples, we\nshow details of periodic(resonant or not) and quasi-periodic trajectories.\n", "  Proxima Centauri is known as the closest star from the Sun. Recently, radial\nvelocity observations revealed the existence of an Earth-mass planet around it.\nWith an orbital period of ~11 days, the surface of Proxima Centauri b is\ntemperate and might be habitable. We took a photometric monitoring campaign to\nsearch for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan\nStation in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8th,\nis identified tentatively. Its midtime, $T_{C}=2,457,640.1990\\pm0.0017$ HJD, is\nconsistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1$\\sigma$\nconfidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of\nProxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a\nGaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential\ntransit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence\nlevel of $2.5\\sigma$. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to\nconfirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b. We plan to monitor Proxima\nCentauri in next Polar night at Dome A in Antarctica, taking the advantage of\ncontinuous darkness. \\citet{Kipping17} reported two tentative transit-like\nsignals of Proxima Centauri b, observed by the Microvariability and Oscillation\nof Stars space Telescope in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The midtransit time of\nour detection is 138 minutes later than that predicted by their transit\nephemeris. If all the signals are real transits, the misalignment of the epochs\nplausibly suggests transit timing variations of Proxima Centauri b induced by\nan outer planet in this system.\n", "  We use a self-assembled two-dimensional Coulomb crystal of $\\sim 70$ ions in\nthe presence of an external transverse field to engineer a quantum simulator of\nthe Dicke Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian has spin and bosonic degrees of freedom\nwhich are encoded by two hyperfine states in each ion and the center of mass\nmotional mode of the crystal, respectively. The Dicke model features a quantum\ncritical point separating two distinct phases: the superradiant (ferromagnetic)\nand normal (paramagnetic) phases. We experimentally explore protocols that aim\nto adiabatically prepare the superradiant ground state, a spin-boson cat state\nwith macroscopic phonon occupation, which is well-suited for enhanced metrology\nand quantum information processing. We start in the normal phase, with all\nspins aligned along a large transverse field and ramp down the field across the\ncritical point following various protocols. We measure the spin observables,\nboth experimentally and in our simulations to characterize the state of the\nsystem at the end of the ramp. We find that under current operating conditions\nan optimally designed ramp is not sufficient to achieve significant fidelity\nwith the superradiant ground state. However, our theoretical investigation\nshows that slight modifications of experimental parameters, together with\nmodest reductions in decoherence rates and thermal noise can increase the\ncat-state fidelity to $\\sim 75\\%$ for $N \\sim 20$ spins. Our results open a\npath for the use of large ensembles of trapped ions as powerful quantum sensors\nand quantum computers.\n", "  We introduce \\emph{contact interactions hamiltonians} (self-adjointoperators\ndefined by boundary conditions) between $N$ massive particles in $R^3$, $N \\geq\n3$. We prove that they are limits (in strong resolvent sense) when $ \\epsilon\n\\to 0$ of interaction through a two-body potential which scales according to $\nV_\\epsilon (|x|) =\\epsilon ^{-3} V ( \\frac {|x|}{ \\epsilon} )$ where $ V(|x|) $\nis an integrable function. The advantage of the formalism of contact\ninteractions is that the results do not depend on the shape of the\napproximating potentials. Depending on the masses and symmetries there may be\nthree body bound states with wave function localized near the barycenter and\nless localized four-body bound states. For some range of masses there is an\ninfinity of bound states with energies which accumulate geometrically to zero\n(Efimov effect). For contact interactions these are all the bound states which\ncan be present in the $N$-body system. We study of zero range hamiltonians by\nfirst compactly embedding the physical space $ L^2(R^{3 (N-1)}) $ in a larger\nHilbert space of more singular functions (Krein space) Estimates are done in\nthe auxiliary space, where strong resolvent convergence when $ \\epsilon \\to 0$\nand spectral properties are easily established. If the hamiltonian \\emph{in\nKrein space} is positive, coming back to $L^2 (R^{3N})$ is done using the\ncompactness of the Krein map and the fact that for positive forms weak\nconvergence implies strong convergence. If it is not positive we use a somewhat\nmore sophisticated operation, $ \\Gamma-$convergence [Dal]. In both cases the\nlimit operator is unique.\n", "  Explosive synchronization (ES) of coupled oscillators on networks is shown to\nbe originated from existence of correlation between natural frequencies of\noscillators and degrees of corresponding nodes. Here, we demonstrate that ES is\na generic feature of multiplex network of second-order Kuramoto oscillators and\ncan exist in absence of a frequency-degree correlation. A monoplex network of\nsecond-order Kuramoto oscillators bearing homogeneous (heterogeneous)\ndegree-distribution is known to display the first-order (second-order)\ntransition to synchronization. We report that multiplexing of two such networks\nhaving homogeneous degree-distribution support the first-order transition in\nboth the layers thereby facilitating ES. More interesting is the multiplexing\nof a layer bearing heterogeneous degree-distribution with another layer bearing\nhomogeneous degree-distribution, which induces a first-order (ES) transition in\nthe heterogeneous layer which was incapable of showing the same in the\nisolation. Further, we report that such induced ES transition in the\nheterogeneous layer of multiplex networks can be controlled by varying inter\nand intra-layer coupling strengths. Our findings emphasize on importance of\nmultiplexing or impact of one layer on dynamical evolution of other layers of\nsystems having inherent multiplex or multilevel architecture.\n", "  The spin-dependent nature of the nuclear tensor force is studied in details\nwithin the relativistic Hartree-Fock approach. The relativistic formalism for\nthe tensor force is supplemented with an additional Lorentz-invariant tensor\nformalism in $\\sigma$-scalar channel, so as to take into account almost fully\nthe nature of the tensor force brought about by the Fock diagrams in realistic\nnuclei. Specifically, the tensor sum rules are tested for the spin and\npseudo-spin partners with/without nodes, to further understand the tensor force\nnature within relativistic model. It is shown that the interference between two\ncomponents of nucleon spinors brings distinct violations on the tensor sum\nrules in realistic nuclei , which is mainly due to the opposite sign on\n$\\kappa$ quantities of the upper and lower components as well as the nodal\ndifference. Even though, the sum rules can be precisely reproduced if taking\nthe same radial wave functions for the spin/pseudo-spin partners in addition to\nneglecting the lower/upper components, revealing clearly the nature of tensor\nforce.\n", "  The intrinsic magnetic state (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic) of\nultra-thin LaMnO$_3$ films on the mostly used SrTiO$_3$ substrate is a\nlong-existing question under debate. Either strain effect or non-stoichiometry\nwas argued to be responsible for the experimental ferromagnetism. In a recent\nexperiment [Science \\textbf{349}, 716 (2015)], one more mechanism, namely the\nself-doping due to polar discontinuity, was argued to be the driving force of\nferromagnetism beyond the critical thickness. Here systematic first-principles\ncalculations have been performed to check these mechanisms in ultra-thin\nLaMnO$_3$ films as well as superlattices. Starting from the very precise\ndescriptions of both LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$, it is found that the compressive\nstrain is the dominant force for the appearance of ferromagnetism, while the\nopen surface with oxygen vacancies leads to the suppression of ferromagnetism.\nWithin LaMnO$_3$ layers, the charge reconstructions involve many competitive\nfactors and certainly go beyond the intuitive polar catastrophe model\nestablished for LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. Our study not only\nexplains the long-term puzzle regarding the magnetism of ultra-thin LaMnO$_3$\nfilms, but also shed light on how to overcome the notorious magnetic dead layer\nin ultra-thin manganites.\n", "  The Lieb-Liniger equation of state accurately describes the zero-temperature\nuniversal properties of a dilute one-dimensional Bose gas in terms of the\ns-wave scattering length. For weakly-interacting bosons we derive non-universal\ncorrections to this equation of state taking into account finite-range effects\nof the inter-atomic potential. Within the finite-temperature formalism of\nfunctional integration we find a beyond-mean-field equation of state which\ndepends on scattering length and effective range of the interaction potential.\nOur analytical results, which are obtained performing dimensional\nregularization of divergent zero-point quantum fluctuations, show that for the\none-dimensional Bose gas thermodynamic quantities like pressure and sound\nvelocity are modified by changing the ratio between the effective range and the\nscattering length.\n", "  For a fully chaotic two-dimensional (2D) microcavity laser, we present a\ntheory that guarantees both the existence of a stable single-mode lasing state\nand the nonexistence of a stable multimode lasing state, under the assumptions\nthat the cavity size is much larger than the wavelength and the external\npumping power is sufficiently large. It is theoretically shown that these\nuniversal spectral characteristics arise from the synergistic effect of two\ndifferent kinds of nonlinearities: deformation of the cavity shape and mode\ninteraction due to a lasing medium. Our theory is based on the linear stability\nanalysis of stationary states for the Maxwell-Bloch equations and accounts for\nsingle-mode lasing phenomena observed in real and numerical experiments of\nfully chaotic 2D microcavity lasers.\n", "  Co40Fe40B20 layers were grown on the Pb0.71Sn0.29Te topological insulator\nsubstrates by laser molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE) method, and the growth\nconditions were studied. The possibility of growing epitaxial layers of a\nferromagnet on the surface of a topological insulator was demonstrated for the\nfirst time. The Co40Fe40B20 layers obtained have a bcc crystal structure with a\ncrystalline (111) plane parallel to the (111) PbSnTe plane. The use of\nthree-dimensional mapping in the reciprocal space of reflection high electron\ndiffraction (RHEED) patterns made it possible to determine the epitaxial\nrelationship of main crystallographic axes between the film and the substrate\nof topological insulator. Quenching of some reflections in diffraction pattern\nallows confirmation of the substrate stoichiometry.\n", "  We propose a conjectural construction of various slices for double affine\nGrassmannians as Coulomb branches of 3-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric affine\nquiver gauge theories. It generalizes the known construction for the usual\naffine Grassmannian, and makes sense for arbitrary symmetric Kac-Moody\nalgebras.\n", "  Optical nonlocalities are elusive and hardly observable in traditional\nplasmonic materials like noble and alkali metals. Here we report experimental\nobservation of viscoelastic nonlocalities in the infrared optical response of\ndoped cadmium-oxide, epsilon-near-zero nanofilms. The nonlocality is detectable\nthanks to the low damping rate of conduction electrons and the virtual absence\nof interband transitions at infrared wavelengths. We describe the motion of\nconduction electrons using a hydrodynamic model for a viscoelastic fluid, and\nfind excellent agreement with experimental results. The electrons elasticity\nblue-shifts the infrared plasmonic resonance associated with the main\nepsilon-near-zero mode, and triggers the onset of higher-order resonances due\nto the excitation of electron-pressure modes above the bulk plasma frequency.\nWe also provide evidence of the existence of nonlocal damping, i.e., viscosity,\nin the motion of optically-excited conduction electrons using a combination of\nspectroscopic ellipsometry data and predictions based on the viscoelastic\nhydrodynamic model.\n", "  We consider the Solid-On-Solid model interacting with a wall, which is the\nstatistical mechanics model associated with the integer-valued field\n$(\\phi(x))_{x\\in \\mathbb Z^2}$, and the energy functional $$V(\\phi)=\\beta\n\\sum_{x\\sim y}|\\phi(x)-\\phi(y)|-\\sum_{x}\\left( h{\\bf\n1}_{\\{\\phi(x)=0\\}}-\\infty{\\bf 1}_{\\{\\phi(x)<0\\}} \\right).$$ We prove that for\n$\\beta$ sufficiently large, there exists a decreasing sequence\n$(h^*_n(\\beta))_{n\\ge 0}$, satisfying\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}h^*_n(\\beta)=h_w(\\beta),$ and such that: $(A)$ The free\nenergy associated with the system is infinitely differentiable on $\\mathbb R\n\\setminus \\left(\\{h^*_n\\}_{n\\ge 1}\\cup h_w(\\beta)\\right)$, and not\ndifferentiable on $\\{h^*_n\\}_{n\\ge 1}$. $(B)$ For each $n\\ge 0$ within the\ninterval $(h^*_{n+1},h^*_n)$ (with the convention $h^*_0=\\infty$), there exists\na unique translation invariant Gibbs state which is localized around height\n$n$, while at a point of non-differentiability, at least two ergodic Gibbs\nstate coexist. The respective typical heights of these two Gibbs states are\n$n-1$ and $n$. The value $h^*_n$ corresponds thus to a first order layering\ntransition from level $n$ to level $n-1$. These results combined with those\nobtained in [23] provide a complete description of the wetting and layering\ntransition for SOS.\n", "  We demonstrate a compact source of energetic and phase-locked multi-terahertz\npulses at a repetition rate of 190 kHz. Difference frequency mixing of the\nfundamental output of an Yb:KGW amplifier with the idler of an optical\nparametric amplifier in GaSe and LiGaS2 crystals yields a passively\nphase-locked train of waveforms tunable between 12 and 42 THz. The shortest\nmulti-terahertz pulses contain 1.8 oscillation cycles within the intensity\nFWHM. Pulse energies of up to 0.16 {\\mu}J and peak electric fields of 13 MV/cm\nare achieved. Electro-optic sampling reveals a phase stability better than 0.1\n$\\pi$ over multiple hours combined with free CEP tunability. The scalable\nscheme opens the door to strong-field terahertz optics at unprecedented\nrepetition rates.\n", "  Layered indium selenide (InSe), a new two-dimensional (2D) material with a\nhexagonal structure and semiconducting characteristic, is gaining increasing\nattention owing to its intriguing electronic properties. Here, by using\nfirst-principles calculations, we reveal that perfect InSe possesses a high\nchemical stability against oxidation, superior to MoS2. However, the presence\nof intrinsic Se vacancy (VSe) and light illumination can markedly affect the\nsurface activity. In particular, the excess electrons associated with the\nexposed In atoms at the VSe site under illumination are able to remarkably\nreduce the dissociation barrier of O2 to ~0.2 eV. Moreover, at ambient\nconditions, the splitting of O2 enables the formation of substitutional\n(apical) oxygen atomic species, which further cause the trapping and subsequent\nrapid splitting of H2O molecules and ultimately the formation of hydroxyl\ngroups. Our findings uncover the causes and underlying mechanisms of InSe\nsurface degradation via the defect-photo promoted oxidations. Such results will\nbe beneficial in developing strategies for the storage of InSe material and its\napplications for surface passivation with boron nitride, graphene or In-based\noxide layers.\n", "  We propose a prime factoring machine operated in a frame work of quantum\nannealing (QA). The idea is inverse operation of a quantum-mechanically\nreversible multiplier implemented with QA-based Boolean logic circuits. We\ndesigned the QA machine on an application-specific-annealing-computing\narchitecture which efficiently increases available hardware budgets at the cost\nof restricted functionality. The circuits are to be implemented and fabricated\nby using superconducting integrated circuit technology. We propose a\nthree-dimensional packaging scheme of a qubit-chip / interposer /\npackage-substrate structure for realizing practically-large scale QA systems.\n", "  We report on the first star discovered to host a planet detected by radial\nvelocity (RV) observations obtained within the CARMENES survey for exoplanets\naround M dwarfs. HD 147379 ($V = 8.9$ mag, $M = 0.58 \\pm 0.08$ M$_{\\odot}$), a\nbright M0.0V star at a distance of 10.7 pc, is found to undergo periodic RV\nvariations with a semi-amplitude of $K = 5.1\\pm0.4$ m s$^{-1}$ and a period of\n$P = 86.54\\pm0.06$ d. The RV signal is found in our CARMENES data, which were\ntaken between 2016 and 2017, and is supported by HIRES/Keck observations that\nwere obtained since 2000. The RV variations are interpreted as resulting from a\nplanet of minimum mass $m_{\\rm p}\\sin{i} = 25 \\pm 2$ M$_{\\oplus}$, 1.5 times\nthe mass of Neptune, with an orbital semi-major axis $a = 0.32$ au and low\neccentricity ($e < 0.13$). HD 147379b is orbiting inside the temperate zone\naround the star, where water could exist in liquid form. The RV time-series and\nvarious spectroscopic indicators show additional hints of variations at an\napproximate period of 21.1d (and its first harmonic), which we attribute to the\nrotation period of the star.\n", "  We summarize the new method for the correction of participant fluctuations in\nhigh energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. It allows to estimate a fluctuation\nbaseline in comparison to a useful signal. In particular cases of a weak signal\ncompared to baseline, it allows to cancel the baseline contribution from\nparticipants.\n", "  This paper provides the first systematic philosophical analysis of an\nincreasingly important part of modern scientific practice: analogue quantum\nsimulation. We introduce the distinction between `simulation' and `emulation'\nas applied in the context of two case studies. Based upon this distinction, and\nbuilding upon ideas from the recent philosophical literature on scientific\nunderstanding, we provide a normative framework to isolate and support the\ngoals of scientists undertaking analogue quantum simulation and emulation. We\nexpect our framework to be useful to both working scientists and philosophers\nof science interested in cutting-edge scientific practice.\n", "  Recently, Shara and collaborators searched for novae in M87 in a series of\nimages originally acquired in HST program #10543 (PI: Baltz), finding a\nsurprisingly high nova rate of $363_{-45}^{+33}$ per year. In an attempt to\nreconcile this rate with previous ground-based estimates, we have undertaken an\nindependent analysis of the HST data. Our results are in broad agreement with\nthose of Shara et al., although we argue that the global nova rate in M87\nremains uncertain, both due to the difficulty in identifying bona fide novae\nfrom incomplete lightcurves, and in extrapolating observations near the center\nof M87 to the entire galaxy. We conclude that nova rates as low as ~200 per\nyear remain plausible.\n", "  We describe a model for the colloidal glass transition that is based on\nFeynman's theory for the $\\lambda$-transition in liquid helium. Our model\nessentially counts the number of configurations of dynamic loops, strings or\nclusters of different sizes, and determines the glass transition volume\nfraction $\\phi_{g}$ from the distribution of these heterogeneities. Since\nconfinement restricts the available number of configurations for these loops,\nstrings and clusters, its effect on $\\phi_{g}$ can also be calculated in a\nrelatively straightforward manner.\n", "  In this study we present a statistical analysis of 53 fast Earth-directed\nhalo CMEs observed by the SOHO/LASCO instrument during the period Jan.\n2009-Sep. 2015, and we use this CME sample to test the capabilities of a\nSun-to-Earth prediction scheme for CME geoeffectiveness. First, we investigate\nthe CME association with other solar activity features by means of\nmulti-instrument observations of the solar magnetic and plasma properties.\nSecond, using coronagraphic images to derive the CME kinematical properties at\n0.1 AU, we propagate the events to 1 AU by means of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model.\nSimulation results at Earth are compared with in-situ observations at L1. By\napplying the pressure balance condition at the magnetopause and a solar wind-Kp\nindex coupling function, we estimate the expected magnetospheric compression\nand geomagnetic activity level, and compare them with global data records. The\nanalysis indicates that 82% of the CMEs arrived at Earth in the next 4 days.\nAlmost the totality of them compressed the magnetopause below geosynchronous\norbits and triggered a geomagnetic storm. Complex sunspot-rich active regions\nassociated with energetic flares result the most favourable configurations from\nwhich geoeffective CMEs originate. The analysis of related SEP events shows\nthat 74% of the CMEs associated with major SEPs were geoeffective. Moreover,\nthe SEP production is enhanced in the case of fast and interacting CMEs. In\nthis work we present a first attempt at applying a Sun-to-Earth\ngeoeffectiveness prediction scheme - based on 3D simulations and solar\nwind-geomagnetic activity coupling functions - to a statistical set of\npotentially geoeffective halo CMEs. The results of the prediction scheme are in\ngood agreement with geomagnetic activity data records, although further studies\nperforming a fine-tuning of such scheme are needed.\n", "  We extend recent work on a leakage-protected, adiabatic entangling gate for\nexchange-only spin qubits [Doherty and Wardrop, PRL 111, 050503 (2013)] by\nadapting to a setting where single spins are not assumed to be polarized on\npreparation. Previous gate constructions do not function correctly when \"gauge\nspins\" are uninitialized, because the entangling gate has different,\nnon-trivial action in different gauge subspaces. Our construction inherits many\nof the desirable features of the previous work while addressing the\ngauge-dependent behavior. Using numerical simulation, we show that the\nresulting gate implements the same logical operation in both gauge subspaces to\nfirst order in perturbation theory, and second-order terms introduce an error\nthat decreases quadratically in the duration of the gate. We add $1/f$ charge\nnoise to voltages modulating exchange in this model, which introduces errors\nthat increase with gate time, to show that there is an optimal gate duration\nfor a given set of device parameters.\n", "  The microscopic origins of Fourier's venerable law of thermal transport in\nquantum electron systems has remained somewhat of a mystery, given that\nprevious derivations were forced to invoke intrinsic scattering rates far\nexceeding those occurring in real systems. We propose an alternative\nhypothesis, namely, that Fourier's law emerges naturally if many quantum states\nparticipate in the transport of heat across the system. We test this hypothesis\nsystematically in a graphene flake junction, and show that the temperature\ndistribution becomes nearly classical when the broadening of the individual\nquantum states of the flake exceeds their energetic separation. We develop a\nthermal resistor network model to investigate the scaling of the sample and\ncontact thermal resistances, and show that the latter is consistent with\nclassical thermal transport theory in the limit of large level broadening.\n", "  The slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is one of the key\nchallenges in developing high performance energy devices, such as solid oxide\nfuel cells. Straining a film by growing on a lattice-mismatched substrate has\nbeen a conventional approach to enhance the ORR activity. However, due to the\nlimited choice of electrolyte substrates to alter the degree of strain, a\nsystematic study in various materials has been a challenge. Here, we explore\nthe strain modulation of the ORR kinetics by growing epitaxial\nLa0.6Sr0.4CoO3-{\\delta} (LSCO) films on yttria-stabilized zirconia substrates\nwith the film thickness below and above the critical thickness for strain\nrelaxation. Two orders of magnitude higher ORR kinetics is achieved in an\nultra-thin film with ~0.8% tensile strain as compared to unstrained films.\nTime-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling confirms that\nthe Sr surface segregation is not responsible for the enhanced ORR in strained\nfilms. We attribute this enhancement of ORR kinetics to the increase in oxygen\nvacancy concentration in the tensile-strained LSCO film owing to the reduced\nactivation barrier for oxygen surface exchange kinetics. Density functional\ntheory calculations reveal an upshift of the oxygen 2p-band center relative to\nthe Fermi level by tensile strain, indicating the origin of the enhanced ORR\nkinetics.\n", "  The dynamics of quantized vortices in weakly interacting superfluids are\noften modeled by a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. In contrast, we show that\nquantized vortices in fact obey a non-Hamiltonian evolution equation, which\nenhances dispersion along the vortex line while introducing a gain mechanism.\nThis allows the vortex medium to support a helical shock front propagating\nahead of a dissipative soliton. This dynamic relaxes localized curvature events\ninto Kelvin wave packets. Consequently, a beyond local induction model provides\na pathway for decay in low-temperature quantum turbulence.\n", "  We investigate (a) spontaneous Raman scattering of classical signals in long\noptical fiber links leading to significant Raman noise in quantum channels\npropagating in the same fiber and (b) impact of chromatic dispersion on the\nperformance of high quantum bit rate QKD systems. One way of decreasing Raman\nnoise is to decrease the classical signal power. This may be achieved by the\nuse of coherent modulation formats and the deployment of Forward Error\nCorrection technology. Additionally, low loss fiber with small Raman gain at\ntelecom wavelengths enables the simultaneous transmission of multiple quantum\nchannels and one or a few classical channels at 100 Gb/s rate over tens,\npossibly hundreds, of kilometers.\n", "  The difference of the moment of inertia of the neutron star PSR J0348 + 0432\nand that of its proto neutron star is studied in the framework of the\nrelativistic mean field theory considering baryon octet. The temperature of the\nproto neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is chosen as T=5 MeV. The calculations show\nthat the central baryon number density of the proto neutron star PSR J0348+0432\nis in the range 0.623$\\sim$0.813 fm$^{-3}$, decreased by 2$\\sim$7\\% compared to\nthat of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432. The radius of the proto neutron star\nPSR J0348+0432 is in the range 13.101$\\sim$12.419 km, increased by 1$\\sim$2\\%\ncompared to that of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432. The moment of inertia of\nthe proto neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range\n1.939$\\times$10$^{45}$$\\sim$1.638$\\times$10$^{45}$ g.cm$^{2}$, increased by\nabout 2$\\sim$7\\% compared to that of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432.\n", "  Intra-atomic exchange couplings (IEC) between $5d6s$ and $4f$ electrons are\nubiquitous in rare-earth metals and play a critical role in spin dynamics.\nHowever, detecting them in real time domain has been difficult. Here we show\nthe direct evidence of IEC between $5d6s$ and $4f$ electrons in gadolinium.\nUpon femtosecond laser excitation, $5d6s$ electrons are directly excited, their\nmajority bands shift toward the Fermi level while their minority bands do the\nopposite. For the first time, our first-principles minority shift now agrees\nwith the experiment quantitatively. Excited $5d6s$ electrons lower the exchange\npotential barrier for $4f$ electrons, so the $4f$ states are also shifted in\nenergy, a prediction that can be tested experimentally. Although a significant\nnumber of $5d6s$ electrons, some several eV below the Fermi level, are excited\nout of the Fermi sea, there is no change in the $4f$ states, a clear\nmanifestation of intra-atomic exchange coupling. Based on our results, we\npropose that the demagnetization time of a material be inversely proportional\nto the density of states at the Fermi level and the excited, not the whole,\nspin moment. This can be tested experimentally.\n", "  Vorticity distributions in axisymmetric vortex rings produced by a\npiston-pipe apparatus are numerically studied over a range of Reynolds numbers,\n$\\mathrm{Re}$, and stroke-to-diameter ratios, $L/D$. It is found that a state\nof advective balance, such that $\\zeta \\equiv \\omega_\\phi/r \\approx F(\\psi,\nt)$, is achieved within the region (called the vortex ring bubble) enclosed by\nthe dividing streamline. Here $\\zeta \\equiv\\omega_\\phi/r$ is the ratio of\nazimuthal vorticity to cylindrical radius, and $\\psi$ is the Stokes\nstreamfunction in the frame of the ring. Some but not all of the $\\mathrm{Re}$\ndependence in the time evolution of $F(\\psi, t)$ can be captured by introducing\na scaled time $\\tau = \\nu t$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. When $\\nu\nt/D^2 \\gtrsim 0.02$, the shape of $F(\\psi)$ is dominated by the\nlinear-in-$\\psi$ component, the coefficient of the quadratic term being an\norder of magnitude smaller. An important feature is that as the dividing\nstreamline ($\\psi = 0$) is approached, $F(\\psi)$ tends to a non-zero intercept\nwhich exhibits an extra $\\mathrm{Re}$ dependence. This and other features are\nexplained by a simple toy model consisting of the one-dimensional cylindrical\ndiffusion equation. The key ingredient in the model responsible for the extra\n$\\mathrm{Re}$ dependence is a Robin-type boundary condition, similar to\nNewton's law of cooling, that accounts for the edge layer at the dividing\nstreamline.\n", "  A novel and practical copper-catalyzed approach is developed for the\npreparation of 5-arylindazolo[3,2-b]quinazolin-7(5H)-ones. The\n2-amino-N'-arylbenzohydrazide, which easily prepared by reaction of isatoic\nanhydride with arylhydrazine, through a condensation/intramolecular cyclization\nreacted by 2-nitrobenzaldehydes in the present of CuI to afford corresponding\n5-arylindazolo[3,2-b]quinazolin-7(5H)-ones in good yields.\n", "  Cooperators benefit others with paying costs. Evolution of cooperation\ncrucially depends on the cost-benefit ratio of cooperation, denoted as $c$. In\nthis work, we investigate the infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma for\nvarious values of $c$ with four of the representative memory-one strategies,\ni.e., unconditional cooperation, unconditional defection, tit-for-tat, and\nwin-stay-lose-shift. We consider replicator dynamics which deterministically\ndescribes how the fraction of each strategy evolves over time in an\ninfinite-sized well-mixed population in the presence of implementation error\nand mutation among the four strategies. Our finding is that this\nthree-dimensional continuous-time dynamics exhibits chaos through a bifurcation\nsequence similar to that of a logistic map as $c$ varies. If mutation occurs\nwith rate $\\mu \\ll 1$, the position of the bifurcation sequence on the $c$ axis\nis numerically found to scale as $\\mu^{0.1}$, and such sensitivity to $\\mu$\nsuggests that mutation may have non-perturbative effects on evolutionary paths.\nIt demonstrates how the microscopic randomness of the mutation process can be\namplified to macroscopic unpredictability by evolutionary dynamics.\n", "  Princess Kaguya is a heroine of a famous folk tale, as every Japanese knows.\nShe was assumed to be confined in a bamboo cavity with cylindrical shape, and\nthen fortuitously discovered by an elderly man in the forest. Here, we pose a\nquestion as to how long she could have survived in an enclosed space such as\nthe bamboo chamber, which had no external oxygen supply at all. We demonstrate\nthat the survival time should be determined by three geometric quantities: the\ninner volume of the bamboo chamber, the volumetric size of her body, and her\nbody's total surface area that governs the rate of oxygen consumption in the\nbody. We also emphasize that this geometric problem shed light on an\ninteresting scaling relation between biological quantities for living\norganisms.\n", "  A general framework of non-perturbative quantum field theory on a curved\nbackground is presented. A quantum field theory is in this setting\ncharacterised by an embedding of a space of field configurations into a Hilbert\nspace over $\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$. This embedding, which is only local up to a\nscale that we interpret as the Planck scale, coincides in the local and flat\nlimit with the plane wave expansion known from canonical quantisation. We\nidentify a universal Bott-Dirac operator acting in the Hilbert space over\n$\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$ and show that it gives rise to the free Hamiltonian both in\nthe case of a scalar field theory and in the case of a Yang-Mills theory. These\ntheories come with a canonical fermionic sector for which the Bott-Dirac\noperator also provides the Hamiltonian. We prove that these quantum field\ntheories exist non-perturbatively for an interacting real scalar theory and for\na general Yang-Mills theory, both with or without the fermionic sectors, and\nshow that the free theories are given by semi-finite spectral triples over the\nrespective configuration spaces. Finally, we propose a class of quantum field\ntheories whose interactions are generated by inner fluctuations of the\nBott-Dirac operator.\n", "  We analyze the universality of the Unitary Fermi Gas in its ground state from\na Wilsonian renormalization point of view and compute the effective range\ndependence of the Bertsch parameter $\\xi$ exactly. To this end we construct an\neffective block-diagonal two-body separable interaction with the Fermi momentum\nas a cut-off which reduces the calculation to the mean field level. The\ninteraction is separable in momentum space and is determined by Tabakin's\ninverse scattering formula. For a vanishing effective range we get $\\xi =\n\\frac{176}{9 \\pi }-\\frac{17}{3} = 0.56$. By using phase-equivalent similarity\ntransformations we can show that there is a class of exact solutions with any\nvalue in the range $ 0.56 \\ge \\xi \\ge -1/3$.\n", "  The goal of these lectures is to present the few fundamentals of\nnoncommutative geometry looking around its spectral approach. Strongly\nmotivated by physics, in particular by relativity and quantum mechanics,\nChamseddine and Connes have defined an action based on spectral considerations,\nthe so-called spectral action.\n  The idea is to review the necessary tools which are behind this spectral\naction to be able to compute it first in the case of Riemannian manifolds\n(Einstein--Hilbert action). Then, all primary objects defined for manifolds\nwill be generalized to reach the level of noncommutative geometry via spectral\ntriples, with the concrete analysis of the noncommutative torus which is a\ndeformation of the ordinary one.\n  The basics of different ingredients will be presented and studied like, Dirac\noperators, heat equation asymptotics, zeta functions and then, how to get\nwithin the framework of operators on Hilbert spaces, the notion of\nnoncommutative residue, Dixmier trace, pseudodifferential operators etc. These\nnotions are appropriate in noncommutative geometry to tackle the case where the\nspace is swapped with an algebra like for instance the noncommutative torus.\nIts non-compact generalization, namely the Moyal plane, is also investigated.\n", "  Massive neutrinos and leptonic mixings have provided the first evidence of\nflavour violation in the lepton sector, opening a unique gateway to many new\nphenomena. Among the latter, one finds processes violating lepton number,\ncharged lepton flavours, or even the universality of lepton flavours. These\nvery rare transitions can be studied in high-intensity facilities, and if\nobserved, constitute a clear sign of New Physics. After a brief review of the\nexperimental status of dedicated searches, we comment on the prospects of\nseveral well-motivated models of neutrino mass generation to several of the\nabove mentioned observables, also discussing how the interplay of\nhigh-intensity observables and neutrino data can shed light on the underlying\nNew Physics model.\n", "  We are going to apply AGB stars to find star formation history for IC\\,1613\ngalaxy, this a new and simple method that works well for nearby galaxies.\nIC\\,1613 is a Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy that is located at distance of\n750 kpc, a gas rich and isolated dwarf galaxy that has a low foreground\nextinction. We use the long period variable stars (LPVs) that represent the\nvery final stage of evolution of stars with low and intermediate mass at the\nAGB phase and are very luminous and cool so that they emit maximum brightness\nin near--infrared bands. Thus near--infrared photometry with using stellar\nevolutionary models help us to convert brightness to birth mass and age and\nfrom this drive star formation history of the galaxy. We will use the\nluminosity distribution of the LPVs to reconstruct the star formation\nhistory--a method we have successfully applied in other Local Group galaxies.\nOur analysis shows that the IC 1613 has had a nearly constant star formation\nrate, without any dominant star formation episode.\n", "  A study of general rogue waves in some integrable reverse time nonlocal\nnonlinear equations is presented. Specifically, the reverse time nonlocal\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) and nonlocal Davey-Stewartson (DS) equations are\ninvestigated, which are nonlocal reductions from the AKNS hierarchy. By using\nDarboux transformation (DT) method, several types of rogue waves are\nconstructed. Especially, a unified binary DT is found for this nonlocal DS\nsystem, thus the solution formulas for nonlocal DSI and DSII equation can be\nwritten in an uniform expression. Dynamics of these rogue waves is separately\nexplored. It is shown that the (1+1)-dimensional rogue waves in nonlocal NLS\nequation can be bounded for both x and t, or develop collapsing singularities.\nIt is also shown that the (1+2)-dimensional line rogue waves in the nonlocal DS\nequations can be bounded for all space and time, or have finite-time\nblowing-ups. All these types depend on the values of free parameters introduced\nin the solution. In addition, the dynamics patterns in the multi- and\nhigher-order rogue waves exhibits more richer structures, most of which have no\ncounterparts in the corresponding local nonlinear equations.\n", "  We measure the electron spin resonance spectrum of the endohedral fullerene\nmolecule $^{15}\\mathrm{N@C}_{60}$ at pressures ranging from atmospheric\npressure to 0.25 GPa, and find that the hyperfine coupling increases linearly\nwith pressure. We present a model based on van der Waals interactions, which\naccounts for this increase via compression of the fullerene cage and consequent\nadmixture of orbitals with a larger hyperfine coupling. Combining this model\nwith theoretical estimates of the bulk modulus, we predict the pressure shift\nand compare it to our experimental results, finding fair agreement given the\nspread in estimates of the bulk modulus. The spin resonance linewidth is also\nfound to depend on pressure. This is explained by considering the\npressure-dependent viscosity of the solvent, which modifies the effect of\ndipolar coupling between spins within fullerene clusters.\n", "  The Fermi level position in (Ga,Mn)N has been determined from the\nperiod-analysis of GaN-related Franz-Keldysh oscillation obtained by\ncontactless electroreflectance in a series of carefully prepared by molecular\nbeam epitaxy GaN/Ga1-xMnxN/GaN(template) bilayers of various Mn concentration\nx. It is shown that the Fermi level in (Ga,Mn)N is strongly pinned in the\nmiddle of the band gap and the thickness of the depletion layer is negligibly\nsmall. For x > 0.1% the Fermi level is located about 1.25 - 1.55 eV above the\nvalence band, that is very close to, but visibly below the Mn-related Mn2+/Mn3+\nimpurity band. The accumulated data allows us to estimate the Mn-related band\noffsets at the (Ga,Mn)N/GaN interface. It is found that most of the band gap\nchange in (Ga,Mn)N takes place in the valence band on the absolute scale and\namounts to -0.028+-0.008 eV/% Mn. The strong Fermi level pinning in the middle\nof the band gap, no carrier conductivity within the Mn-related impurity band,\nand a good homogeneity enable a novel functionality of (Ga,Mn)N as a\nsemi-insulating buffer layers for applications in GaN-based heterostuctures.\n", "  We present a many-body theory that explains and reproduces recent\nobservations of population polarization dynamics, is supported by controlled\nhuman experiments, and addresses the controversy surrounding the Internet's\nimpact. It predicts that whether and how a population becomes polarized is\ndictated by the nature of the underlying competition, rather than the validity\nof the information that individuals receive or their online bubbles. Building\non this framework, we show that next-generation social media algorithms aimed\nat pulling people together, will instead likely lead to an explosive\npercolation process that generates new pockets of extremes.\n", "  We discuss the effect of noise on a system with a quasi-periodicity of\ndifferent dimensions. As the basic model of our research we use the simplest\nthree-dimensional map with two-frequency and three-frequency quasi-periodicity.\nModification of the dynamical regimes at the influence of noise is considered\nwith the help of Lyapunov chart method. The transformation of Lyapunov\nexponents plots characteristic for the quasi-periodic Hopf bifurcation of\n3-torus birth at the presence of noise is examined.\n", "  A few thoughts on physical meaning of geometry, space and time.\n", "  Fluid-induced slip of fractures is characterized by strong multiphysics\ncouplings. Three physical processes are considered: Flow, rock deformation and\nfracture deformation. The fractures are represented as lower-dimensional\nobjects embedded in a three-dimensional domain. Fluid is modeled as slightly\ncompressible, and flow in both fractures and matrix is accounted for. The\ndeformation of rock is inherently different from the deformation of fractures;\nthus, two different models are needed to describe the mechanical deformation of\nthe rock. The medium surrounding the fractures is modeled as a linear elastic\nmaterial, while the slip of fractures is modeled as a contact problem, governed\nby a static-dynamic friction model. We present an iterative scheme for solving\nthe non-linear set of equations that arise from the models, and suggest how the\nstep parameter in this scheme should depend on the shear modulus and mesh size.\n", "  Schneider (2018) explored the possibility that 'Oumuamua is a Solar System\nobject, and concluded that if it is, it must have been scattered by \"another,\nyet unknown planet.\" I provide an extremely conservative upper limit on\npost-scattering velocities in the Solar System to show that 'Oumuamua is moving\nfar to quickly to be the result of any hypothetical single scattering event\nbetween any bound Solar System objects within 21 au (a distance within which\nour understanding of objects capable of scattering 'Oumuamua is presumably\ncomplete).\n", "  Atomic force microscopy is based on tip sample interaction, which is\ndetermined by the properties of tip and sample. Unfortunately, in particular in\nambient conditions the tip as well as the sample are contaminated, and it is\nnot clear how this contamination may affect data in Atomic Force Microscopy\n(AFM) applications. In the present work we propose to use on the one hand AFM\nimaging of the cantilever chips and on the other hand multidimensional AFM\nspectroscopy techniques to characterize the state of contamination of the tip\nsample system. We find that typically AFM cantilevers may be severely\ncontaminated when taken from typical packaging boxes that have been opened for\na long time. In addition, by acquisition spectroscopy data as a function of\ntip-sample voltage and tip-sample distance, we are able to determine the\nHamaker constant of the system, which depends strongly on the contamination\nwithin the tip-sample system. This method allows for in-situ characterization\nof the tip-sample system using only AFM techniques.\n", "  We numerically analyze the performance of labyrinthine acoustic metamaterials\nwith internal channels folded along a Wunderlich space-filling curve to control\nlow-frequency sound in air. In contrast to previous studies, we perform direct\nmodeling of wave propagation through folded channels, not introducing effective\ntheory assumptions. As a result, we reveal that metastructures with channels,\nwhich allow wave propagation in the opposite direction to incident waves, have\ndifferent dynamics as compared to those for straight slits of equivalent\nlength. The differences are attributed to activated tortuosity effects and\nresult in 100% wave reflection at band gap frequencies. This total reflection\nphenomenon is found to be insensitive to thermo-viscous dissipation in air. For\nlabyrinthine channels generated by iteration levels, one can achieve broadband\ntotal sound reflection by using a metamaterial monolayer and efficiently\ncontrol the amount of absorbed wave energy by tuning the channel width. Thus,\nthe work contributes to a better understanding of labyrinthine metamaterials\nwith potential applications for reflection and filtering of low-frequency\nairborne sound.\n", "  We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to study critical nematic\nfluctuations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Au$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ superconductors above and across\nwell separated tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition at temperature\n$T_S(x)$ and the N\\'{e}el transition at $T_N(x)$. The static Raman\nsusceptibility in $XY$ symmetry channel increases upon cooling from room\ntemperature following the Curie-Weiss law, with Weiss temperature\n$T_{\\theta}(x)$ several tens of degrees lower than $T_S(x)$. Data reveals a\nhidden nematic quantum critical point at $x_{c} = 0.031$ when the system\nbecomes superconducting, indicating a direct connection between quantum\ncritical nematic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity. We\nattribute the origin of the nematicity to charge quadrupole fluctuations due to\nelectron transfer between the nearly degenerate $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbitals.\n", "  The hyperbolic tangent function is usually used as a reliable approximation\nof the equilibrium density distributions of a system with phase transitions.\nHowever, analyzing the accuracies of the numerical derivatives, we find that\nits numerical derivatives computed by central difference method (CDM) may\ndeviate significantly from its analytical solutions, while those computed by\nhigh-order difference method (HDM) can agree very well. Therefore, we introduce\nHDM to evaluate the interparticle interactions instead of popular CDM, and\npropose a pseudopotential multiphase lattice Boltzmann model based on\nhigh-order difference method. The present model not only retains the advantages\nof the pseudopotential model, such as easy implementation, high efficiency,\nfull parallelism and so on, but also achieves higher accuracies. To verify the\nperformances of this model, several multiphase flow simulations are conducted,\nincluding both stationary and dynamic situations. Firstly, full thermodynamic\nconsistencies for the popular equations of state have been achieved in large\ntemperature range and at large density ratio, without any combining interaction\nand any additional adjustable parameter of interaction. Secondly, with\nhigh-order difference, either the interparticle interaction proposed by\nShan-Chen or by Zhang-Chen can equally depict the phase transitions of the\nfluids with all selected equations of the state. These numerical agreements\nbased on HDM are consistent to the theoretical analysis that the two models are\nmathematically identical. Thirdly, the present model is stable and accurate at\na wider temperature range. Lastly, our newly proposed model can be easily and\nreliably applied to various practical simulations and expected to obtain some\nmore interesting results.\n", "  The Helmholtz equation arises when modeling wave propagation in the frequency\ndomain. The equation is discretized as an indefinite linear system, which is\ndifficult to solve at high wave numbers. In many applications, the solution of\nthe Helmholtz equation is required for a point source. In this case, it is\npossible to reformulate the equation as two separate equations: one for the\ntravel time of the wave and one for its amplitude. The travel time is obtained\nby a solution of the factored eikonal equation, and the amplitude is obtained\nby solving a complex-valued advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation. The\nreformulated equation is equivalent to the original Helmholtz equation, and the\ndifferences between the numerical solutions of these equations arise only from\ndiscretization errors. We develop an efficient multigrid solver for obtaining\nthe amplitude given the travel time, which can be efficiently computed. This\napproach is advantageous because the amplitude is typically smooth in this\ncase, and hence, more suitable for multigrid solvers than the standard\nHelmholtz discretization. We demonstrate that our second order ADR\ndiscretization is more accurate than the standard second order discretization\nat high wave numbers, as long as there are no reflections or caustics.\nMoreover, we show that using our approach, the problem can be solved more\nefficiently than using the common shifted Laplacian multigrid approach.\n", "  The multi-TeV energies available at LHC have opened up the possibility to\nmeasure, for the first time, various large-mass elementary particles in nuclear\ncollisions. The current study presents the first observation of top quark--the\nheaviest elementary particle in the standard model--using proton-lead\ncollisions. The measurement is based on a data set whose integrated luminosity\namounts to 174 nb$^{-1}$, as recorded by CMS at a center-of-mass energy per\nnucleon pair of 8.16 TeV. The pair production process is measured using events\nwith exactly one isolated lepton, electron or muon, and at least four jets,\nleading to a cross section of $45\\pm8\\ \\rm{nb}$. This is well compatible with\ntheoretical predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order with soft gluon resummation at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The statistical significance of\nthe signal against the background-only hypothesis is above five standard\ndeviations.\n", "  The first measurement of the top quark pair production cross section\n($\\sigma_{\\rm{t}\\bar{\\rm{t}}}$) in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} =\n5.02$ TeV is reviewed. The data have been collected by the CMS experiment at\nthe LHC and analyzed considering events with at least one charged lepton. The\nextraction of $\\sigma_{\\rm{t}\\bar{\\rm{t}}}$ can be used to constrain the gluon\ndistribution function (PDF) at large longitudinal parton momentum fraction and\nto establish experimentally the relation between the top-quark mass as\nimplemented in Monte-Carlo generators and the Lagrangian mass parameter. The\nimpact of the measurement on the determination of the gluon PDF is illustrated\nthrough a quantum chromodynamic analysis at next-to-next-to-leading order and\nthe result is furthermore put in context with other top quark measurements in\ndifferent phase space regions. The measurement has paved the way for the first\nobservation of top quark production in nuclear collisions and the subsequent\nstudy of modifications induced on the bound gluon PDF.\n", "  The top quark, being the heaviest elementary fermion known in the Standard\nmodel, has the largest coupling to the Higgs boson. The associated production\nof top quarks with the Higgs boson, either in pairs (t$\\bar{\\rm{t}}$H) or\nsingly (tH), provides direct experimental access to the top-Higgs coupling\n$y_{\\rm{t}}$. The t$\\bar{\\rm{t}}$H (tH) production mode, while proceeding at a\nrate of about 100 (1000) times smaller than gluon fusion, bears a highly\ndistinctive experimental signature, which includes leptons and/or jets from the\ndecay of the two (single) top quarks. The latest results of ttH searches at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up\nto $35.9\\ \\rm{fb}^{-1}$ as collected from CMS are shown and tantalizing\nevidence is found for measuring this crucial process with sufficient precision.\nHowever, higher precision data set is needed in order to confirm or disprove\nthe previous observed excess. Initial searches for tH production mode at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV achieve comparable sensitivity to that of the\nRun 1 analysis.\n", "  Precision measurement of the cross section for single top production is an\nimportant test of the Standard Model (SM). The purity of the collected data in\nsingle top events is limited by the understanding of the shape and yield of\nbackground contributions. Besides electroweak and $\\rm{t\\bar{t}}$ processes,\nQCD multijet events constitute a non-negligible background for the considered\nsignal bq$'\\rightarrow$ tq ($\\textit{t}$-channel) process. The data-driven\ntechnique for constraining QCD contribution, employed in the measurement of the\n$\\textit{t}$-channel single top-quark cross section using the very first LHC\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13\\ TeV$ with the CMS detector, is\ndescribed. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of\n$\\mathcal{L}=42\\ pb^{\\mathrm{-1}}$.\n", "  In 1958, Ernest Rabinowicz suggested a simple criterion distinguishing the\nregimes of plastic smoothing and formation of wear particles in a contact of\nhomogeneous sliding bodies. However, he did not consider any detailed mechanism\nof either plastic smoothing or debris formation. In a recent paper in Nature\nCommunications, Molinari et al. have confirmed the criterion using explicit\nmesoparticle simulation. The work of Molinari's group provides a strong support\nto the general concept of Rabinowicz which is based on the consideration of\ncompetition of plastic deformation and fracture. It is interesting to apply\nthis concept to more general configurations than those considered by Rabinowicz\nand Molinari's group. An important case is a system having a very soft surface\nlayer. In the present paper, the analysis similar to that of Rabinowicz is\napplied to materials with soft layer. It is shown that in this case, too, both\ncases of plastic deformation and debris formation may occur. It would be\ninteresting to verify this prediction by explicit meso-particle simulations\nsimilar to those of Molinari's group.\n", "  We investigate electromagnetic scattering of normally irradiated gyrotropic,\nmagneto-optical core-shell cylinders using Lorenz-Mie theory. A general\nexpression for time-averaged electromagnetic energy inside a coated\ngyroelectric and gyromagnetic scatterer is derived. Using realistic material\nparameters for a silica core and InSb shell, we calculate the stored\nelectromagnetic energy and the scattering anisotropy. We show that the\napplication of an external magnetic field along the cylinder axis induces a\ndrastic decrease in electromagnetic absorption in a frequency range in the\nterahertz, where absorption is maximal in the absence of the magnetic field. We\ndemonstrate not only that the scattering anisotropy can be externally tuned by\napplying a magnetic field, but also that it reaches negative values in the\nterahertz range even in the dipolar regime. We also show that this preferential\nbackscattering response results in an anomalous regime of multiple light\nscattering from a collection of magneto-optical core-shell cylinders, in which\nthe extinction mean free path is longer than the transport mean free path. By\nadditionally calculating the energy-transport velocity and diffusion\ncoefficient, we demonstrate an unprecedented degree of external control of\nmultiple light scattering, which can be achieved by either applying an external\nmagnetic field or varying the temperature.\n", "  By combining first principles theoretical calculations and experimental\noptical and structural characterization such as spectroscopic ellipsometry,\nX-ray spectroscopy, and electron microscopy, we study the dielectric\npermittivity and plasmonic properties of ultrathin TiN films at an atomistic\nlevel. Our results indicate a remarkably persistent metallic character of\nultrathin TiN films and a progressive red shift of the plasmon energy as the\nthickness of the film is reduced. The microscopic origin of this trend is\ninterpreted in terms of the characteristic two-band electronic structure of the\nsystem. Surface oxidation and substrate strain are also investigated to explain\nthe deviation of the optical properties from the ideal case. This paves the way\nto the realization of ultrathin TiN films with tailorable and tunable plasmonic\nproperties in the visible range for applications in ultrathin metasurfaces and\nflexible optoelectronic devices.\n", "  Many cellular processes are tightly connected to the dynamics of microtubules\n(MTs). While in neuronal axons MTs mainly regulate intracellular trafficking,\nthey participate in cytoskeleton reorganization in many other eukaryotic cells,\nenabling the cell to efficiently adapt to changes in the environment. We show\nthat the functional differences of MTs in different cell types and regions is\nreflected in the dynamic properties of MT tips. Using plus-end tracking\nproteins EB1 to monitor growing MT plus-ends, we show that MT dynamics and life\ncycle in axons of human neurons significantly differ from that of fibroblast\ncells. The density of plus-ends, as well as the rescue and catastrophe\nfrequencies increase while the growth rate decreases toward the fibroblast cell\nmargin. This results in a rather stable filamentous network structure and\nmaintains the connection between nucleus and membrane. In contrast, plus-ends\nare uniformly distributed along the axons and exhibit diverse polymerization\nrun times and spatially homogeneous rescue and catastrophe frequencies, leading\nto MT segments of various lengths. The probability distributions of the\nexcursion length of polymerization and the MT length both follow nearly\nexponential tails, in agreement with the analytical predictions of a two-state\nmodel of MT dynamics.\n", "  Transmembrane receptor clustering is a ubiquitous phenomenon in pro- and\neukaryotic cells to physically sense receptor/ligand interactions and\nsubsequently translate an exogenous signal into a cellular response. Despite\nthat receptor cluster formation has been described for a wide variety of\nreceptors, ranging from chemotactic receptors in bacteria to growth factor and\nneurotransmitter receptors in mammalian cells, a mechanistic understanding of\nthe underlying molecular processes is still puzzling. In an attempt to fill\nthis gap we followed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by\ndissecting and modulating cargo binding, internalization and cellular response\nmediated by KDEL receptors (KDELRs) at the mammalian cell surface after\ninteraction with a model cargo/ligand. Using a fluorescent variant of ricin\ntoxin A chain as KDELR-ligand, eGFP-RTA (H/KDEL), we demonstrate that cargo\nbinding induces dose-dependent receptor cluster formation at and subsequent\ninternalization from the membrane which is associated and counteracted by\nanterograde and microtubule-assisted receptor transport to preferred docking\nsites at the plasma membrane. By means of analytical arguments and extensive\nnumerical simulations we show that cargo-synchronized receptor transport from\nand to the membrane is causative for KDELR/cargo cluster formation at the\nmammalian cell surface.\n", "  We clarify the natural cluster algebra of type A that exists in a residual\nand tropical form in the kinematical space as suggested in 1711.09102 by the\nuse of triangulations, mutations and associahedron on the definition of\nscattering forms. We also show that this residual cluster algebra is preserved\nin a hypercube (diamond) necklace inside the associahedron where cluster\nsub-algebras $(A_1)^n$ exist. This result goes in line with results with\ncluster poligarithms in 1401.6446 written in terms of $A_2$ and $A_3$ functions\nonly and other works showing the primacy of $A$ cluster sub-algebras as data\ninput for scattering amplitudes.\n", "  We present predictions for proton skins based on isospin-asymmetric equations\nof state derived microscopically from high-precision chiral few-nucleon\ninteractions. Moreover, we investigate the relation between the neutron skin of\na nucleus and the difference between the proton radii of the corresponding\nmirror nuclei.\n", "  On the basis of field observations and of a tentative classification of the\ndifferent types of snow, a modeling of the different possible types of\nfull-depth avalanches is proposed. A new approach for flow and arrest processes\nis suggested, in terms of healable granular media dynamics.\n", "  In the framework of chiral kinetic theory (CKT), we consider a system of\nright- and left-handed Weyl fermions out of thermal equilibrium in a\nhomogeneous weak magnetic field. We show that the Lorentz invariance implies a\nmodification in the definition of the momentum current in the phase space,\ncompared to the case in which the system is in global equilibrium. Using this\nmodified momentum current, we derive the linearized conservation equations from\nthe kinetic equation up to second order in the derivative expansion. It turns\nout that the eigenmodes of these equations, namely the hydrodynamic modes,\ndiffer from those obtained from the hydrodynamic in the Landau-Lifshitz (LL)\nframe at the same order. We show that the modes of the former case may be\ntransformed to the corresponding modes in the latter case by a global boost.\nThe velocity of the boost is proportional to the magnetic field as well as the\ndifference between the right- and left-handed charges susceptibility. We then\ncompute the chiral transport coefficients in a system of non-Abelian chiral\nfermions in the no-drag frame and by making the above boost, obtain the\nwell-known transport coeffiecients of the system in the LL frame. Finally by\nusing the idea of boost, we reproduce the AdS/CFT result for the chiral drag\nforce exerted on a quark at rest in the rest frame of the fluid, without\nperforming any holographic computations.\n", "  Using a first principles approach combined with analysis of heuristic\ntight-binding models, we examine the connectivity dependence of two forms of\nquantum interference in single molecules. Based on general arguments, Fano\nresonances are shown to be insensitive to connectivity, while Mach-Zehnder-type\ninterference features are shown to be connectivity dependent. This behaviour is\nfound to occur in molecular wires containing anthraquinone units, in which the\npendant carbonyl groups create Fano resonances, which coexist with\nmultiple-path quantum interference features.\n", "  The promise of enhanced performance has motivated the study of one\ndimensional nanomaterials, especially aligned carbon nanotubes (A-CNTs), for\nthe reinforcement of polymeric materials. While early work has shown that CNTs\nhave remarkable theoretical properties, more recent work on aligned CNT polymer\nmatrix nanocomposites (A-PNCs) have reported mechanical properties that are\norders of magnitude lower than those predicted by rule of mixtures. This large\ndifference primarily originates from the morphology of the CNTs that reinforce\nthe A-PNCs, which have significant local curvature commonly referred to as\nwaviness, but are commonly modeled using the oversimplified straight column\ngeometry. Here we used a simulation framework capable of analyzing 10$^{5}$\nwavy CNTs with realistic stochastic morphologies to study the influence of\nwaviness on the compliance contribution of wavy A-CNTs to the effective elastic\nmodulus of A-PNCs, and show that waviness is responsible for the orders of\nmagnitude \\textit{over-prediction} of the A-PNC effective modulus by existing\ntheoretical frameworks that both neglect the shear deformation mechanism and do\nnot properly account for the CNT morphpology. Additional work to quantify the\nmorphology of A-PNCs in three dimensions and simulate their full elastic\nconstitutive relations is planned.\n", "  This overview will give a glimpse into chemical design principles for\nexploiting quantum interference (QI) effects in molecular-scale devices. Direct\nobservation of room temperature QI in single-molecule junctions has stimulated\ngrowing interest in fabrication of tailor-made molecular electronic devices.\nHerein, we outline a new conceptual advance in the scientific understanding and\ntechnological know-how necessary to control QI effects in single molecules by\nchemical modification. We start by discussing QI from a chemical viewpoint and\nthen describe a new magic ratio rule (MRR), which captures a minimal\ndescription of connectivity-driven charge transport and provides a useful\nstarting point for chemists to design appropriate molecules for molecular\nelectronics with desired functions. The MRR predicts conductance ratios, which\nare solely determined by QI within the core of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\n(PAHs). The manifestations of QI and related quantum circuit rules for\nmaterials discovery are direct consequences of the key concepts of weak\ncoupling, locality, connectivity, mid-gap transport and phase coherence in\nsingle-molecule junctions.\n", "  The Standard model of particle physics provides a successful theory to\nunderstand the experimental results of the electroweak and strong interactions.\nHowever, it does not have a satisfactory explanation for the hierarchy problem.\nMany extensions of the Standard Model that solve the hierarchy problem result\nin new particles. We will study the phenomenology of vector-like fermions\nresulting in theories where the Higgs boson is typically a\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. In these theories we study the case where a heavy\nfermion will be heavier than a heavy gluon, and then the channel of a heavy\nfermion decaying into a color octet is considered. We study this phenomenology\nat high energy colliders, both the LHC as well as future machines.\n", "  Materials comprising carbon nanotube (CNT) aligned nanowire (NW) polymer\nnanocomposites (A-PNCs) are emerging as next-generation materials for use in\naerospace structures. Enhanced operating regimes, such as operating\ntemperatures, motivate the study of CNT aligned NW ceramic matrix\nnanocomposites (A-CMNCs). Here we report the synthesis of CNT A-CMNCs through\nthe pyrolysis of CNT A-PNC precursors, thereby creating carbon matrix CNT\nA-CMNCs. Characterization reveals that the fabrication of high strength, high\ntemperature, lightweight next-generation aerospace materials is possible using\nthis method. Additional characterization and modeling are planned.\n", "  Rb-NMR study has been performed on the quasi-one dimensional competing spin\nchain Rb2Cu2Mo3O12 with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange\ninteractions on nearest neighboring and next nearest neighboring spins,\nrespectively. The system changes from a gapped ground state at zero field to\nthe gapless state at H_C \\simeq 2 T, where the existence of magnetic order\nbelow 1 K was demonstrated by a broadening of NMR spectrum, associated with a\ncritical divergence of 1/T_1. In higher temperature region, 1/T_1 showed a\npower-law type temperature dependence, from which the field dependence of\nLuttinger parameter K was obtained and compared with theoretical calculations\nbased on the spin nematic Tomonaga Luttinger Liquid (TLL) state.\n", "  We investigate the confinement-deconfinement transition at finite temperature\nin terms of the probability distribution of Polyakov-loop complex-phase via the\nJensen-Shannon divergence. The Jensen-Shannon divergence quantifies the\ndifference of two probability distributions, namely the target and reference\nprobability distributions. We adopt the complex-phase distributions of the\nspatially averaged Polyakov loop at $\\mu/T=0$ and $\\mu/T=i\\pi/3$ as the target\nand reference distributions, respectively. It is shown that the Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence has the inflection point when the target system approaches the\nRoberge-Weiss endpoint temperature even in the finite-volume system. This means\nthat we can detect the confinement-deconfinement transition from the structural\nchange of probability distributions when we suitably set the reference\nprobability distribution. It is also shown that we can pick up the information\nof the confinement-deconfinement transition from the quark number density by\nusing the Fourier decomposition; Fourier coefficients have a long tail at\naround the transition temperature and show a divergent series in calculating\nthe normalized kurtosis.\n", "  We comment two incorrect statements given in Ref.1. (A) - In order to show\nthat the electron-phonon interaction (EPI) is very small and irrelevant for\nsuperconductivity in 1UC FeSe/SrTiO3 system, the authors of Ref.1 use an EPI\ncoupling constant which does not enter in any theory of superconductivity. So,\ntheir conclusion on the smallness of the EPI in 1UC FeSe/SrTiO3 is incorrect.\nAccordingly, their coupling constant has also nothing to do with the EPI\ncoupling with the forward scattering peak (EPI-FSP), which is proposed recently\nin order to explain high Tc in 1UC FeSe/SrTiO3. (B) - In Ref.1 it is claimed\nthat the experimentally resolved ARPES replica bands can be explained by the\nLDA+DMFT method. We show that this statement is also incorrect, i.e. the\nLDA+DMFT method in Ref.1 is unable to explain the replica bands.\n", "  We report on high-resolution photoluminescence (PL) and photocurrent (PC)\nspectroscopies of a single self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) embedded\nin an n-i-Schottky device with an applied magnetic field in Faraday and Voigt\ngeometries. The single-QD PC spectrum of neutral exciton (X$^0$) is obtained by\nsweeping the bias-dependent X$^0$ transition energy to achieve resonance with a\nfixed narrow-bandwidth laser through quantum-confined Stark effect. With a\nmagnetic field applied in Faraday geometry, the diamagnetic effect and the\nZeeman splitting of X$^0$ are observed both in PL and PC spectra. When the\nmagnetic field is applied in Voigt geometry, the mixture of bright and dark\nstates results in an observation of dark exciton states, which are confirmed by\nthe polarization-resolved PL and PC spectra.\n", "  Type-I X-ray bursts arise from unstable thermonuclear burning of accreted\nfuel on the surface of neutron stars. In this chapter we review the fundamental\nphysics of the burning processes, and summarise the observational, numerical,\nand nuclear experimental progress over the preceding decade. We describe the\ncurrent understanding of the conditions that lead to burst ignition, and the\ninfluence of the burst fuel on the observational characteristics. We provide an\noverview of the processes which shape the burst X-ray spectrum, including the\nobservationally elusive discrete spectral features. We report on the studies of\ntiming behaviour related to nuclear burning, including burst oscillations and\nmHz quasi-periodic oscillations. We describe the increasing role of nuclear\nexperimental physics in the interpretation of astrophysical data and models. We\nsurvey the simulation projects that have taken place to date, and chart the\nincreasing dialogue between modellers, observers, and nuclear experimentalists.\nFinally, we identify some open problems with prospects of a resolution within\nthe timescale of the next such review.\n", "  Atmospheric propagation effects at millimeter wavelengths can significantly\nalter the phases of radio signals and reduce the coherence time, putting tight\nconstraints on high frequency Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)\nobservations. In previous works, it has been shown that non-dispersive (e.g.\ntropospheric) effects can be calibrated with the frequency phase transfer (FPT)\ntechnique. The coherence time can thus be significantly extended. Ionospheric\neffects, which can still be significant, remain however uncalibrated after FPT\nas well as the instrumental effects. In this work, we implement a further phase\ntransfer between two FPT residuals (i.e. so-called FPT-square) to calibrate the\nionospheric effects based on their frequency dependence. We show that after\nFPT-square, the coherence time at 3 mm can be further extended beyond 8~hours,\nand the residual phase errors can be sufficiently canceled by applying the\ncalibration of another source, which can have a large angular separation from\nthe target (>20 deg) and significant temporal gaps. Calibrations for all-sky\ndistributed sources with a few calibrators are also possible after FPT-square.\nOne of the strengths and uniqueness of this calibration strategy is the\nsuitability for high-frequency all-sky survey observations including very weak\nsources. We discuss the introduction of a pulse calibration system in the\nfuture to calibrate the remaining instrumental effects and allowing the\npossibility of imaging the source structure at high frequencies with\nFPT-square, where all phases are fully calibrated without involving any\nadditional sources.\n", "  In this paper, thermal conductivity measurement of liquids and nanofluids is\nnumerically investigated by the steady state method. In which, it is required\nto omit the natural convection effects on the inaccuracy of measurement for\nheat lost quantification. One of the well-known steady-state apparatus is\ncircular parallel-plate where the distance between circular plates is filled\nwith liquids or nanofluids. So, it has to be designed accurately to neglect the\neffects of free convection. The numerical simulation is a convenient method\nwhich can omit the mentioned effects. Water, Ethylene and Ethylene Glycol are\nconsidered as base liquids and Al2O3 as a Nano-fluid in this work. Thermal\nboundary conditions, the distance between two parallel discs, physical and\nthermal quantities of fluids, size and volume fraction of nano-particles have\nextensive effects on the measurement process. The main result of the simulation\nindicates that for all of the cases, the distance between two parallel discs\nhas to get less than 2 mm for accurate measurement of thermal conductivity in\nthe parallel circular plate, wherein, uncertainty in the presence of the\nnatural convection can be easily omitted.\n", "  We delineate the properties of dense QCD matter through equations of state\nconstrained by the neutron star observations. The two solar mass constraint,\nthe radius constraint of 11-13 km, and the causality constraint on the speed of\nsound, are used to develop the picture of hadron-quark continuity in which\nhadronic matter continuously transforms into quark matter. A unified equation\nof state at zero temperature and beta-equilibrium is constructed by a\nphenomenological interpolation between nuclear and quark matter equations of\nstate. For applications to supernovae and neutron star mergers, the unified\nequation of state is perturbed by temperature corrections.\n", "  Contact analysis without adhesion is still a challenging problem, mainly\nowing to the multiscale and self-fractal characteristics of rough surfaces. Up\nto now, theories for analyzing contact behavior of rough surfaces in literature\ncan be generally categorized into two groups: the asperity-based Hertz contact\nmodels initiated by Greenwood and Williamson (G-W model), which is shown more\naccurate under small indentation distance, and the magnification-based pressure\ndiffusion theory initiated by Persson, which is shown to work well under full\ncontact conditions. The aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical model\nthat can effectively formulate the contact status of rough surfaces during the\nentire compression process. This is achieved by integrating the idea of\nmagnification, or evolving resolution into an asperity representation of rough\nsurfaces, and a magnification-based multi-asperity model is thus established.\nIn the derived model, the originally complex contact problem is decomposed into\na family of sub-problems each defined on a morphologically simpler contact\nislands. Benefiting from the explicit results given by Greenwood and\nWilliamson, the proposed method is relatively easy for numerical\nimplementation. Compared to other G-W type models, the proposed method has\nespecially shown its strength in the computation of the contact area. Moreover,\nthe G-W and Persson models are found well connected by the proposed method. For\nits validation, the proposed model is well compared with existing numerical,\ntheoretical and experimental results. In particular, the proposed model has\nshown its excellency through comparison with representative theoretical,\nnumerical and experimental data compiled in the contact challenge test by\nMueser et al.\n", "  In this paper we introduce exotic twisted $\\mathbb T$-equivariant K-theory of\nloop space $LZ$ depending on the (typically non-flat) holonomy line bundle\n${\\mathcal L}^B$ on $LZ$ induced from a gerbe with connection $B$ on $Z$. We\nalso define exotic twisted $\\mathbb T$-equivariant Chern character that maps\nthe exotic twisted $\\mathbb T$-equivariant K-theory of $LZ$ into the exotic\ntwisted $\\mathbb T$-equivariant cohomology as defined in an earlier paper of\nours, and which localises to twisted cohomology of $Z$.\n", "  Drawing largely from my work with co--workers, I present arguments that\nstrangeness does not play an {\\it explicit} role in compact-star matter. They\nare based on the skyrmion description of dense matter combined with Wilsoninan\nrenormalization group approach to kaon nuclear interactions. The key idea is\nthat quark degrees of freedom, carrying strangeness, can be traded in by\ntopology for hadron degrees of freedom.\n", "  Weakly interacting quantum fluids allow for a natural kinetic theory\ndescription which takes into account the fermionic or bosonic nature of the\ninteracting particles. In the simplest cases, one arrives at the\nBoltzmann-Nordheim equations for the reduced density matrix of the fluid. We\ndiscuss here two related topics: the kinetic theory of the fermionic Hubbard\nmodel, in which conservation of total spin results in an additional Vlasov type\nterm in the Boltzmann equation, and the relation between kinetic theory and\nthermalization.\n", "  We derive the momentum distribution for two soft and collinear gluons emitted\nfrom an off-shell quark, modeled by a $q\\gamma\\rightarrow qgg$ scattering\nprocess and computed using the maximal helicity violating (MHV) technique. We\nfind the explicit non-Abelian corrections to the independent emission Poisson\ndistribution in QED and demonstrate the efficiency of the MHV technique in\nperturbative QCD calculations. The gluonic two particle correlation function is\nhighly suggestive of that measured in high-multiplicity $pp$ and $pA$\ncollisions, with a tight correlation in angle but broad correlation in\nrapidity. Further, the autocorrelation generated by the non-Abelian correlation\ncan provide a significant non-hydrodynamical source of $v_2$ in these high\nmultiplicity $pp$ and $pA$ collisions. Finally, these two gluon correlations\ncan be used to calibrate Monte Carlo shower codes for a more accurate\ndescription of QCD processes in $pp$ collisions.\n", "  We propose a class of metamaterials possessing an arbitrary strong elastic\nasymmetry, which emerges from contact interaction introduced in their\narchitecture. The material can be made stiff in tension and soft in compression\nor vice versa. This asymmetry results in different wave celerities of tensile\nand compressive components of elastic waves. The faster component overtakes the\nslower one and results in their dissipative annihilation through high-frequency\nenergy cascades. We discuss the mechanism of this damping, efficient\nsignal-absorbing assemblies, and relevant material architectures.\n", "  This paper has two purposes. The first is to introduce the definition of\nHaantjes manifolds with symmetry. The second is to explain why these manifolds\nappear in the theory of integrable systems of hydrodynamic type and in\ntopological field theories.\n", "  We describe and then elaborate the model of trading zones first presented in\nCollins et al 2007, Trading Zones and Interactional Expertise. We believe this\nexpanded version of the model includes some very important but previously\noverlooked ways for separate language communities to communicate. We illustrate\nthe argument with examples.\n", "  Polynuclear magnetic molecules often present dense transmission spectra with\nmany overlapping conduction spin channels. Single-metal complexes display a\nsparser density of states, which in the presence of a fixed external magnetic\nfield makes them interesting candidates for spin filtering. Here we perform a\nDFT study of a family of bis- and tris-dithiolate vanadium complexes sandwiched\nbetween Au(111) electrodes and demonstrate that [VO(C$_3$S$_4$O)$_2$]$^{2-}$\ncan behave as a dual spin filter. This means that an external stimulus can\nswitch between the selective transmission of spin-up and spin-down carriers. By\nusing an electrostatic gate as external stimulus we show that the onset for the\nspin-up conductance is at a voltage V$_g$ = -0.51 V but a small shift to V$_g$\n= -0.63 V is capable of activating spin-down transport. For both cases, we\nestimate a large low-bias conductance (approx. 2 {\\mu}S at Vbias < 50 mV) with\nexcellent spin selectivity (> 99.5%). We conclude by commenting on the general\nmolecular requirements for the chemical design of further such spintronics\ncomponents.\n", "  We introduce concept of next generation shape invariance and show that the\nprocess of shape invariant extension can be continued indefinitely.\n", "  We review in a unified way a recently proposed method to detect properties of\nunknown quantum channels and lower bounds to quantum capacities, without\nresorting to full quantum process tomography. The method is based on the\npreparation of a fixed bipartite entangled state at the channel input or,\nequivalently, an ensemble of an overcomplete set of single-system states, along\nwith few local measurements at the channel output.\n", "  It is a comment on a paper titled \"Reversibility of magnetic field driven\ntransition from electronic phase separation state to single-phase state in\nmanganites: A microscopic view\" by Liu et al. Phys. Rev. B 96 (2017) 195154.\n", "  Query complexity is a model of computation in which we have to compute a\nfunction $f(x_1, \\ldots, x_N)$ of variables $x_i$ which can be accessed via\nqueries. The complexity of an algorithm is measured by the number of queries\nthat it makes. Query complexity is widely used for studying quantum algorithms,\nfor two reasons. First, it includes many of the known quantum algorithms\n(including Grover's quantum search and a key subroutine of Shor's factoring\nalgorithm). Second, one can prove lower bounds on the query complexity,\nbounding the possible quantum advantage. In the last few years, there have been\nmajor advances on several longstanding problems in the query complexity. In\nthis talk, we survey these results and related work, including:\n  - the biggest quantum-vs-classical gap for partial functions (a problem\nsolvable with 1 query quantumly but requiring $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$ queries\nclassically);\n  - the biggest quantum-vs-determistic and quantum-vs-probabilistic gaps for\ntotal functions (for example, a problem solvable with $M$ queries quantumly but\nrequiring $\\tilde{\\Omega}(M^{2.5})$ queries probabilistically);\n  - the biggest probabilistic-vs-deterministic gap for total functions (a\nproblem solvable with $M$ queries probabilistically but requiring\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(M^{2})$ queries deterministically);\n  - the bounds on the gap that can be achieved for subclasses of functions (for\nexample, symmetric functions);\n  - the connections between query algorithms and approximations by low-degree\npolynomials.\n", "  An optical trapping scheme is proposed by which ultrashort low-amplitude\nradiations, co-propagating with a continuous train of temporal pulses in a\nhollow-core photonic crystal fiber filled with Raman-inactive noble gases, can\nbe trapped and reshaped into optical soliton trains by means of cross-phase\nmodulation interactions. The scheme complements and extends a recently proposed\nidea that a single-pulse soliton could trap an ultrashort small-amplitude\nradiation in a symmetric hollow-core photonic crystal fiber filled with a noble\ngas, thus preventing its dispersion [M. F. Saleh and F. Biancalana, Phys. Rev.\nA87, 043807 (2013)]. We find a family of three distinct soliton-train\nboundstates with different propagation constants, one being a \"duplicate\" of\nthe trapping pulse train. We analyze the effects of self-steepening on the\ntrapping (i.e. pump) and trapped (i.e. probe) field profiles and find that\nself-steepening causes a uniform shift in position of the pump soliton train,\nbut a complex motion for the probe dominanted by anharmonic oscillations of\ntheir temporal positions and phases. The new trapping scheme is intended for\noptical applications involving optical-field cloning and duplication via\nwave-guided-wave processes, in photonic fiber media in which interplay\ntime-division multiplexed high-intensity pulses coexisting with continuous-wave\nradiations.\n", "  This paper explains the perfect characterization of the generalized Bethe\ntrees by analyzing the spectrum of its transition matrix.\n", "  Tribology, which studies surfaces in contact and relative motion, includes\nfriction, wear, and lubrication, straddling across different fields: mechanical\nengineering, materials science, chemistry, nanoscience, physics. This short\nreview restricts to the last two disciplines, with a qualitative survey of a\nsmall number of recent progress areas in the physics of nanofriction.\n", "  If the factors controlling the decay in single-molecule electrical\nconductance G with molecular length L could be understood and controlled, then\nthis would be a significant step forward in the design of high-conductance\nmolecular wires. For a wide variety of molecules conducting by phase coherent\ntunneling, conductance G decays with length following the relationship G =\nAexp-\\b{\\eta}L. It is widely accepted that the attenuation coefficient \\b{\\eta}\nis determined by the position of the Fermi energy of the electrodes relative to\nthe energy of frontier orbitals of the molecular bridge, whereas the terminal\nanchor groups which bind to the molecule to the electrodes contribute to the\npre-exponential factor A. We examine this premise for several series of\nmolecules which contain a central conjugated moiety (phenyl, viologen or\n{\\alpha}-terthiophene) connected on either side to alkane chains of varying\nlength, with each end terminated by thiol or thiomethyl anchor groups. In\ncontrast with this expectation, we demonstrate both experimentally and\ntheoretically that additional electronic states located on thiol anchor groups\ncan significantly decrease the value of \\b{eta}, by giving rise to resonances\nclose to EF through coupling to the bridge moiety. This interplay between the\ngateway states and their coupling to a central conjugated moiety in the\nmolecular bridges creates a new design strategy for realising\nhigher-transmission molecular wires by taking advantage of the\nelectrode-molecule interface properties.\n", "  In this article, we present a brief narration of the origin and the overview\nof the recent developments done on the Kolkata Paise Restaurant (KPR) problem,\nwhich can serve as a prototype for a broader class of resource allocation\nproblems in the presence of a large number of competing agents, typically\nstudied using coordination and anti-coordination games. We discuss the KPR and\nits several extensions, as well as its applications in many economic and social\nphenomena. We end the article with some discussions on our ongoing experimental\nanalysis of the same problem. We demonstrate that this provides an interesting\npicture of how people analyze complex situations, and design their strategies\nor react to them.\n", "  The steady state heat currents of continuous absorption machines can be\ndecomposed into thermodynamically consistent contributions, each of them\nassociated with a circuit in the graph representing the master equation of the\nthermal device. We employ this tool to study the functioning of absorption\nrefrigerators and heat transformers with an increasing number of active levels.\nInterestingly, such an analysis is independent of the particular physical\nimplementation (classical or quantum) of the device. We provide new insights\ninto the understanding of scaling up thermal devices concerning both the\nperformance and the magnitude of the heat currents. Indeed, it is shown that\nthe performance of a multilevel machine is smaller or equal than the\ncorresponding to the largest circuit contribution. Besides, the magnitude of\nthe heat currents is well-described by a purely topological parameter which in\ngeneral increases with the connectivity of the graph. Therefore, we conclude\nthat for a fixed number of levels, the best of all different constructions of\nabsorption machines is the one whose associated graph is as connected as\npossible, with the condition that the performance of all the contributing\ncircuits is equal.\n", "  Motivated by the need to detect an underground cavity within the procedure of\nan On-Site-Inspection (OSI), of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\nOrganization, the aim of this paper is to present results on the comparison of\nour numerical simulations with an analytic solution. The accurate numerical\nmodeling can facilitate the development of proper analysis techniques to detect\nthe remnants of an underground nuclear test. The larger goal is to help set a\nrigorous scientific base of OSI and to contribute to bringing the Treaty into\nforce. For our 3D numerical simulations, we use the discontinuous Galerkin\nSpectral Element Code SPEED jointly developed at MOX (The Laboratory for\nModeling and Scientific Computing, Department of Mathematics) and at DICA\n(Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering) of the Politecnico di\nMilano.\n", "  We report the magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of a heavy\nfermion compound CeNiGe2. This compound undergoes two antiferromagnetic\ntransitions around 4.1 and 3 K. It is observed in heat capacity that as\nmagnetic field is increased to ~ 1 T, the two peak merge into a single peak\naround 3 K. However this peak is not suppressed under the application of\nmagnetic field. Instead a new feature develops at 3.6 K above 1 T. The magnetic\nfield induced new feature is investigated through entropy evolution, magnetic\nGruneisen parameter and resistivity studies. These studies emphasis the fact\nthat partial magnetic frustration due to field induced spin fluctuation is\nresponsible for this observed feature. This partially frustrated regime\ndevelops a new antiferromagnetically ordered phase at high fields. In this\ncompound magnetic field induced QCP is absent implying that the behavior of\nCeNiGe2 is not in accordance to Doniach model proposed for heavy fermions\ncompounds.\n", "  We present here the results of the analysis of the $\\gamma$-ray blazar, 1ES\n1215+303, over a 10-year period, from 2008 to 2017, measured at high energies\n(HE; 200 MeV $< E <$ 100 GeV) by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) and at\nvery high energies (VHE; $E >$ 100 GeV) by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS. This is the\nlongest temporal study of this high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object (HBL) at\n$\\gamma$-ray energies to date. The spectrum follows a log parabola over this\ntime period, and its HE and VHE spectra are well-connected. Its flux is\nsufficiently strong at HE to allow us to bin the Fermi-LAT data in 3-day\nintervals, enabling us to investigate the temporal evolution of the flux in\nunprecedented detail. Several flaring episodes were detected and evidence for\nan overall trend of increasing flux over the span of the 10 years was observed.\nThese light curves, in addition to the spectra, are presented. This unique data\nset will help us to advance our understanding of the underlying physical\nprocesses in blazar jets.\n", "  With the data collected by LHC at 13 TeV, the CMS collaboration has searched\nfor low mass resonances decaying into two photons. This has resulted in the\nobservation of 3 sd excess around 95 GeV, reminiscent of an indication obtained\nat LEP2 by combining the Higgs boson searches of the four LEP experiments.\nThese observations, marginally significant, motivate the present study which\nshows how HL-LHC and ILC250 could search for a radion, the lightest new\nparticle predicted within the Randall Sundrum (RS) model. ILC operating at a\ncentre of mass energy of 250 GeV and with an integrated luminosity surpassing\nLEP2 by three orders of magnitude, could become the ideal machine to study a\nlight radion and to observe, with very high accuracy, how it mixes with the\nHiggs boson and modifies the various couplings.\n", "  A new extended gamma-ray source, which was named as Source A, in the\nsouthwest of Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G306.3$-$0.9 was detected with a\nsignificance of $\\sim$13$\\sigma$ at the location of R.A.

In\norder to investigate this unidentified gamma-ray source in multi-wavelengths,\nwe performed Swift observations of Source A. In this presentation we summarize\nthe published gamma-ray results, report about the recent ToO Swift observations\nof Source A, and show our preliminary results of the gamma-ray analysis that we\nconducted using the new X-ray data.\n", "  We recently introduced a model of an asymmetric dumbbell made of two\nhydrodynamically coupled subunits as a minimal model for a macromolecular\ncomplex, in order to explain the observation of enhanced diffusion of\ncatalytically active enzymes. It was shown that internal fluctuations lead to\nnegative contributions to the overall diffusion coefficient and that the\nfluctuation-induced contributions are controlled by the strength of the\ninteractions between the subunits and their asymmetry. We develop the theory\nfurther by studying the effect of anisotropy of the constituents on the\ndiffusion properties of a modular structure. We derive an analytic form for the\ndiffusion coefficient of an asymmetric, anisotropic dumbbell and show\nsystematically its dependence on the internal and external symmetry. We give\nexpressions for the associated polarisation fields, and comment on their\nconsequences for the alignment mechanism of the dumbbell. The present work\nopens the way to more detailed descriptions of the effect of hydrodynamic\ninteractions on the diffusion and transport properties of biomolecules with\ncomplex structures.\n", "  We propose to build a shielded magnet that will act as an untagged\nbremsstrahlung photon source suitable for deployment in Hall A/C at Jefferson\nLab. The goal of the project is a compact source which provides a narrow 1-mm\ndiameter photon beam at the target with the intensity adequate to the polarized\ntarget operation. The proposed solution is based on the absorption of the\nelectron beam in the magnet. The compactness is achieved by means of a shallow\nchannel which leads to an electromagnetic shower in the Cu-W body of the\nchannel and surrounding material after a 1-2~mm deflection of the beam\nelectrons by a horizontal magnetic field.\n  This source will allow us to achieve ten times the luminosity of the mixed\nelectron--photon beam configuration while keeping the heat load on the\n(polarized) target as well as the radiation level in the experimental hall at\nacceptable levels. The concept for this device was developed for the\nexperimental proposal PR12-15-003 but, if built, it would become a\ngeneral--purpose source that would be usable for a variety of photon--induced\nreactions of interest in the 12-GeV era.\n", "  A new extended gamma-ray source (PS J1934.5+1845) was detected with a\nsignificance of $\\sim$13$\\sigma$ at a location of 1$^{\\circ}\\!\\!$.83 away from\nthe radio location of the Galactic supernova remnant 3C 400.2 using about 9\nyears of Fermi-LAT data. The 68% containment radius of PS J1934.5+1845's\nextension was found to be 0$^{\\circ}\\!\\!$.61 and PS J1934.5+1845 is showing a\npower-law type spectrum with a spectral index of $\\sim$2.38. In this\npresentation we will summarize the gamma-ray analysis methods and report on the\nanalysis results related to the extension and spectrum of PS J1934.5+1845.\n", "  We study the coronal mass ejection (CME) with a complex acceleration profile.\nThe event occurred on April 23, 2009. It had an impulsive acceleration phase,\nan impulsive deceleration phase, and a second impulsive acceleration phase.\nDuring its evolution, the CME showed signatures of different acceleration\nmechanisms: kink instability, prominence drainage, flare reconnection, and a\nCME-CME collision. The special feature of the observations is the usage of the\nTESIS EUV telescope. The instrument could image the solar corona in the Fe 171\n\\AA\\ line up to a distance of 2 $R_\\odot$ from the center of the Sun. This\nallows us to trace the CME up to the LASCO/C2 field of view without losing the\nCME from sight. The onset of the CME was caused by kink instability. The mass\ndrainage occurred after the kink instability. The mass drainage played only an\nauxiliary role: it decreased the CME mass, which helped to accelerate the CME.\nThe first impulsive acceleration phase was caused by the flare reconnection. We\nobserved the two ribbon flare and an increase of the soft X-ray flux during the\nfirst impulsive acceleration phase. The impulsive deceleration and the second\nimpulsive acceleration phases were caused by the CME-CME collision. The studied\nevent shows that CMEs are complex phenomena that cannot be explained with only\none acceleration mechanism. We should seek a combination of different\nmechanisms that accelerate CMEs at different stages of their evolution.\n", "  In practical terms, controlling a network requires manipulating a large\nnumber of nodes with a comparatively small number of external inputs, a process\nthat is facilitated by paths that broadcast the influence of the\n(directly-controlled) driver nodes to the rest of the network. Recent work has\nshown that surprisingly, temporal networks can enjoy tremendous control\nadvantages over their static counterparts despite the fact that in temporal\nnetworks such paths are seldom instantaneously available. To understand the\nunderlying reasons, here we systematically analyze the scaling behavior of a\nkey control cost for temporal networks--the control energy. We show that the\nenergy costs of controlling temporal networks are determined solely by the\nspectral properties of an \"effective\" Gramian matrix, analogous to the static\nnetwork case. Surprisingly, we find that this scaling is largely dictated by\nthe first and the last network snapshot in the temporal sequence, independent\nof the number of intervening snapshots, the initial and final states, and the\nnumber of driver nodes. Our results uncover the intrinsic laws governing why\nand when temporal networks save considerable control energy over their static\ncounterparts.\n", "  In this paper, applying the Bethe ansatz method, we investigate the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for the three quasi-exactly solvable double-well\npotentials, namely the generalized Manning potential, the Razavy bistable\npotential and the hyperbolic Shifman potential. General exact expressions for\nthe energies and the associated wave functions are obtained in terms of the\nroots of a set of algebraic equations. Also, we solve the same problems using\nthe Lie algebraic approach of quasi-exact solvability through the sl(2)\nalgebraization and show that the results are the same. The numerical evaluation\nof the energy spectrum is reported to display explicitly the energy levels\nsplitting.\n", "  An overview of research on laser-plasma based acceleration of ions is given.\nThe experimental state of the art is summarized and recent progress is\ndiscussed. The basic acceleration processes are briefly reviewed with an\noutlook on hybrid mechanisms and novel concepts. Finally, we put focus on the\ndevelopment of engineered targets for enhanced acceleration and of all-optical\nmethods for beam post-acceleration and control.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the coupled focusing-defocusing complex short\npulse equation, which describe the propagation of ultra-short optical pulses in\ncubic nonlinear media. Through the unified transform method, the\ninitial-boundary value problem for the coupled focusing-defocusing complex\nshort pulse equation with $4\\times 4$ Lax pair on the half-line are to be\nanalyzed. Assuming that the solution $\\{q_1(x,t),q_2(x,t)\\}$ of the coupled\nfocusing-defocusing complex short pulse equation exists, we show that\n$\\{q_{1,x}(x,t),q_{2,x}(x,t)\\}$ can be expressed in terms of the unique\nsolution of a $4\\times 4$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the\ncomplex $\\lambda$-plane. Thus, the solution $\\{q_1(x,t),q_2(x,t)\\}$ can be\nobtained by integration with respect to $x$. Moreover, we also get that some\nspectral functions are not independent and satisfy the so-called global\nrelation.\n", "  It is challenging task to detect and measure genuine multipartite\nentanglement. We investigate the problem by considering the average based\npositive partial transposition(PPT) criterion and the realignment criterion.\nSufficient conditions for detecting genuine tripartite entanglement are\npresented. We also derive lower bounds for the genuine tripartite entanglement\nconcurrence with respect to the conditions. While the PPT criterion and the\nrealignment criterion are powerful for detecting bipartite entanglement and for\nproviding lower bounds of bipartite concurrences, our results give an effective\noperational way to detect and measure the genuine tripartite entanglement.\n", "  A precise definition of what constitutes a community in networks has remained\nelusive. Consequently, network scientists have compared community detection\nalgorithms on benchmark networks with a particular form of community structure\nand classified them based on the mathematical techniques they employ. However,\nthis comparison can be misleading because apparent similarities in their\nmathematical machinery can disguise different reasons for why we would want to\nemploy community detection in the first place. Here we provide a focused review\nof these different motivations that underpin community detection. This\nproblem-driven classification is useful in applied network science, where it is\nimportant to select an appropriate algorithm for the given purpose. Moreover,\nhighlighting the different approaches to community detection also delineates\nthe many lines of research and points out open directions and avenues for\nfuture research.\n", "  We present and discuss some experimental approaches involving spectroscopy\nfrom heavy meson decays going to light mesons. In particular we emphasis the\nscalar resonance $f_0(980)$, which have different well determined parameter of\nmass and width obtained from $J/\\psi$ and D decays. We will also show how the\nCP violation observed in charmless three body decay can be used as tool to\nunderstand hadron hadron interaction at low mass region\n", "  This paper introduces the concept of on-chip temporal optical computing,\nbased on dispersive Fourier transform and suitably designed modulation module,\nto perform mathematical operations of interest, such as differentiation,\nintegration, or convolution in time domain. The desired mathematical operation\nis performed as signal propagates through a fully reconfigurable on-chip\nphotonic signal processor. Although a few number of photonic temporal signal\nprocessors have been introduced recently, they are usually bulky or they suffer\nfrom limited reconfigurability which is of great importance to implement\nlarge-scale general-purpose photonic signal processors. To address these\nlimitations, this paper demonstrates a fully reconfigurable photonic integrated\nsignal processing system. As the key point, the reconfigurability is achieved\nby taking advantages of dispersive Fourier transformation, linearly chirp\nmodulation using four wave mixing, and applying the desired arbitrary transfer\nfunction through a cascaded Mach-Zehnder modulator and phase modulator. Our\ndemonstration reveals an operation time of $200~ps$ with high resolution of\n$300~fs$. To have an on-chip photonic signal processor, a broadband photonic\ncrystal waveguide with an extremely large group-velocity dispersion of $2.81\n\\times {10^{6}}~\\frac{{{ps^2}}}{km}$ is utilized. Numerical simulations of the\nproposed structure reveal a great potential for chip-scale fully reconfigurable\nall-optical signal processing through a bandwidth of $400~GHz$.\n", "  Precision experiments, such as the search for electric dipole moments of\ncharged particles using radiofrequency spin rotators in storage rings, demand\nfor maintaining the exact spin resonance condition for several thousand\nseconds. Synchrotron oscillations in the stored beam modulate the spin tune of\noff-central particles, moving it off the perfect resonance condition set for\ncentral particles on the reference orbit. Here we report an analytic\ndescription of how synchrotron oscillations lead to non-exponential decoherence\nof the radiofrequency resonance driven up-down spin rotations. This\nnon-exponential decoherence is shown to be accompanied by a nontrivial walk of\nthe spin phase. We also comment on sensitivity of the decoherence rate to the\nharmonics of the radiofreqency spin rotator and a possibility to check\npredictions of decoherence-free magic energies.\n", "  The world famous Javanese temple of Borobudur is located at the westernmost\nend of a straight line which includes two satellite temples, Mendut and Pawon.\nOriginally, the three buildings were probably connected by a processional path\nrunning along this line. It is shown here that the alignment points, at the\nhorizon, where the sun sets in the days of the zenith passages. This\norientation is likely intentional and related to a ritual procession which\nconnected the three temples, mimicking the path of the sun in the sky.\n", "  From the new infrared (IR) reflectivity and time-domain terahertz (THz)\nspectra combined with available high-frequency dielectric data above the MHz\nrange in a broad temperature range of 10-900 K, a full picture of the soft and\ncentral mode behavior in the classical relaxor ferroelectric Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3\n(PMN) is suggested. A detailed comparison is given with the recent hyper-Raman\nspectroscopy data (Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 155501 (2016)), and also with other\navailable experiments based on inelastic light and neutron scattering. The\nclosest agreement is with the hyper-Raman data, both techniques yield the same\nnumber of soft-mode components and the same high-temperature softening towards\nthe temperature T* ~ 400 K. In addition to evaluation of the IR-THz data using\nfitting with standard factorized form of the dielectric function, we performed\na successful fitting of the same data using the effective medium approach\n(EMA), originally based on the assumption that the mesoscopic structure of PMN\nconsists of randomly oriented uniaxially anisotropic polar nanodomains (PNDs)\nwith somewhat harder TO polar modes in the direction along the local PND dipole\n(Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 027601 (2006)). Evaluation using the Bruggeman EMA\nmodelling has been successfully applied in the entire investigated temperature\nrange. These results suggest that the response perpendicular to the local\ndipole moment, at high temperatures induced by random fields rather than PNDs,\nundergoes a classical softening from high temperatures with permittivity\nobeying the Curie-Weiss law, eps_per = C/(T-Tc), C = 1.7 x 10^5 K and Tc = 380\nK. Below the Burns temperature ~620 K, a GHz relaxation ascribed to flipping of\nthe PNDs emerges from the soft mode response, slows down and broadens,\nremaining quite strong towards the cryogenic temperatures, where it can be\nassigned to fluctuations of the PND boundaries.\n", "  Single molecule spectroscopy aims at unveiling often hidden but potentially\nvery important contributions of single entities to a system's ensemble\nresponse. Albeit contributing tremendously to our ever growing understanding of\nmolecular processes the fundamental question of temporal evolution, or change,\nhas thus far been inaccessible, resulting in a static picture of a dynamic\nworld. Here, we finally resolve this dilemma by performing the first ultrafast\ntime-resolved transient spectroscopy on a single molecule. By tracing the\nfemtosecond evolution of excited electronic state spectra of single molecules\nover hundreds of nanometres of bandwidth at room temperature we reveal their\nnon-linear ultrafast response in an effective 3-pulse scheme with fluorescence\ndetection. A first excitation pulse is followed by a phase-locked de-excitation\npulse-pair, providing spectral encoding with 25 fs temporal resolution. This\nexperimental realisation of true single molecule transient spectroscopy\ndemonstrates that two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of single molecules\nis experimentally in reach.\n", "  In continuation of our earlier work on the long-term evolution of the\nso-called high--B radio pulsars (HBRPs) with measured braking indices, we have\ninvestigated the long-term evolution of the remaining five HBRPs for which\nbraking indices have not been measured yet. This completes our source-by-source\nanalyses of HBRPs in the fallback disc model that was also applied earlier to\nanomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), soft gamma repeaters (SGRs), and dim isolated\nneutron stars (XDINs). Our results show that the X-ray luminosities and the\nrotational properties of these rather different neutron star populations can be\nacquired by neutron stars with fallback discs as a result of differences in\ntheir initial conditions, namely the initial disc mass, initial period and the\ndipole field strength. For the five HBRPs, unlike for AXPs, SGRs and XDINs, our\nresults do not constrain the dipole field strengths of the sources. We obtain\nevolutionary paths leading to the properties of HBRPs in the propeller phase\nwith dipole fields sufficiently strong to produce pulsed radio emission.\n", "  We propose a scheme for high quantum state transfer efficiency between two\ndistant mechanical oscillators. Through coupling separately to two optical\ncavities connected by an optical fiber, two distant mechanical oscillators\nachieve a transfer efficiency closing to unity. In the process of analysis, we\nemployed time-varying optomechanical coupling strength as a Gaussian pulse.\n", "  The functions of proteins and RNAs are determined by a myriad of interactions\nbetween their constituent residues, but most quantitative models of how\nmolecular phenotype depends on genotype must approximate this by simple\nadditive effects. While recent models have relaxed this constraint to also\naccount for pairwise interactions, these approaches do not provide a tractable\npath towards modeling higher-order dependencies. Here, we show how latent\nvariable models with nonlinear dependencies can be applied to capture\nbeyond-pairwise constraints in biomolecules. We present a new probabilistic\nmodel for sequence families, DeepSequence, that can predict the effects of\nmutations across a variety of deep mutational scanning experiments\nsignificantly better than site independent or pairwise models that are based on\nthe same evolutionary data. The model, learned in an unsupervised manner solely\nfrom sequence information, is grounded with biologically motivated priors,\nreveals latent organization of sequence families, and can be used to\nextrapolate to new parts of sequence space\n", "  We study possible superfluid states of the Rashba spin-orbit coupled (SOC)\nspinor bosons with the spin anisotropic interaction $ \\lambda $ hopping in a\nsquare lattice. The frustrations from the non-abelian flux due to the SOC leads\nto novel spin-bond correlated superfluids. By using a recently developed\nsystematic \"order from quantum disorder\" analysis, we not only determine the\ntrue quantum ground state, but also evaluate the mass gap in the spin sector at\n$ \\lambda < 1 $, especially compute the the excitation spectrum of the\nGoldstone mode in the spin sector at $ \\lambda=1 $ which would be quadratic\nwithout the analysis. The analysis also leads to different critical exponents\non the two sides of the 2nd order transition driven by a roton touchdown at $\n\\lambda=1 $. The intimate analogy at $ \\lambda=1 $ with the charge neutral\nGoldstone mode in the pseudo-spin sector in the Bilayer quantum Hall systems at\nthe total filling factor $ \\nu_T=1 $ are stressed. The experimental\nimplications and detections of these novel phenomena in cold atoms loaded on a\noptical lattice are presented.\n", "  Photometric surveys at optical, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths provide\never growing datasets as major surveys proceed. Colour-colour diagrams are\nuseful tools to identify classes of stars and to provide large samples.\nCombining all photometric measurements of a star into a spectral energy\ndistribution will allow quantitative analyses to be carried out. We demonstrate\nhow to construct and exploit spectral energy distributions and colours for\nsublumious B (sdB) stars. The aim is to identify cool companions to hot\nsubdwarfs and to determine atmospheric parameters of apparently single sdB\nstars as well as composite spectrum sdB binaries. We analyse two sdB stars with\nhigh-quality photometric data which serve as our benchmarks, the apparently\nsingle sdB HD 205805 and the sdB + K5 binary PG 0749+658, briefly present\npreliminary results for the sample of 142 sdB binaries with known orbits, and\ndiscuss future prospects from ongoing all-sky optical space- (Gaia) and\nground-based (e.g. SkyMapper) as well as NIR surveys.\n", "  During the formation and evolution of the Solar System, significant numbers\nof cometary and asteroidal bodies were ejected into interstellar space$^{1,2}$.\nIt can be reasonably expected that the same happened for planetary systems\nother than our own. Detection of such Inter- stellar Objects (ISOs) would allow\nus to probe the planetesimal formation processes around other stars, possibly\ntogether with the effects of long-term exposure to the interstellar medium.\n1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua is the first known ISO, discovered by the Pan-STARRS1\ntelescope in October 2017$^3$.The discovery epoch photometry implies a highly\nelongated body with radii of $\\sim 200 \\times 20$ m when a comet-like geometric\nalbedo of 0.04 is assumed. Here we report spectroscopic characterisation of\n'Oumuamua, finding it to be variable with time but similar to organically rich\nsurfaces found in the outer Solar System. The observable ISO population is\nexpected to be dominated by comet-like bodies in agreement with our spectra,\nyet the reported inactivity implies a lack of surface ice. We show this is\nconsistent with predictions of an insulating mantle produced by long-term\ncosmic ray exposure. An internal icy composition cannot therefore be ruled out\nby the lack of activity, even though 'Oumuamua passed within 0.25 au of the\nSun.\n", "  A configuration to excite the Uller-Zenneck surface electromagnetic waves at\nthe planar interfaces of homogeneous and isotropic dielectric materials is\nproposed and theoretically analyzed. The Uller-Zenneck waves are surface waves\nthat can exist at the planar interface of two dissimilar dielectric materials\nof which at least one is a lossy dielectric material. In this work, a slab of a\nlossy dielectric material was taken with lossless dielectric materials on both\nsides. A canonical boundary-value problem was set up and solved to find the\npossible Uller-Zenneck waves and waveguide modes. The Uller-Zenneck waves\nguided by the slab of the lossy dielectric material were found to be either\nsymmetric or anti-symmetric that transmuted into waveguide modes when the\nthickness of that slab was increased. A prism-coupled configuration was then\nsuccessfully devised to excite the Uller-Zenneck waves. The results showed that\nthe Uller-Zenneck waves are excited at the same angle of incidence for any\nthickness of the slab of the lossy dielectric material, whereas the waveguide\nmodes can be excited when the slab is sufficiently thick. The excitation of\nUller-Zenneck waves at the planar interfaces with homogeneous and\nall-dielectric materials can usher new avenues for the applications for\nelectromagnetic surface waves.\n", "  It has been claimed in Ref.[arXiv:1712.02240] that massive primordial black\nholes (PBH) cannot constitute all of the dark matter (DM), because their\ngravitational-lensing imprint on the Hubble diagram of type Ia supernovae (SN)\nwould be incompatible with present observations. In this paper, we critically\nreview those constraints and find several caveats on the analysis. First of\nall, the constraints on the fraction $\\alpha$ of PBH in matter seem to be\ndriven by a very restrictive choice of priors on the cosmological parameters.\nIn particular, the degeneracy between $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$ and $\\alpha$ is ignored\nand thus, by fixing $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, transferred the constraining power of SN\nmagnitudes to $\\alpha$. Furthermore, by considering more realistic physical\nsizes for the type-Ia supernovae, we find an effect on the SN lensing\nmagnification distribution that leads to significantly looser constraints.\nMoreover, considering a wide mass spectrum of PBH, such as a lognormal\ndistribution, further softens the constraints from SN lensing. Finally, we find\nthat the fraction of PBH that could constitute DM today is bounded by $f_{\\rm\nPBH} < 1.09\\ (1.38)$, for JLA (Union 2.1) catalogs, and thus it is perfectly\ncompatible with an all-PBH dark matter scenario in the LIGO band.\n", "  The paper describes the experimental investigations of the performance of a\nmulti-stage water desalination still connected to a solar parabolic trough\n(solar energy concentrator) with focal pipe and simple heat exchanger\n(serpentine). The receiver length is 2 m and has a diameter of 6 mm. A diluted\nsolution of water-antifreeze is selected as working fluid. This solution is\nflowing as cycle through the focal pipe and serpentine. The solution in the\nheat exchanger is heated during the sunlight by means of solar energy\nconcentrator (solar parabolic trough). The parabolic trough is tracking the sun\nusing simple mechanism to collect the highest amount of solar radiation by\noptimum angle. The receiver is covered with transparent borosilicate glass to\navoid the heat transfer by convection to the surrounding (i.e. the greenhouse\neffect is utilized) and the space between the glass and tube is evacuated.\nAluminum serpentine of the heat exchanger is installed in the bottom of the\nstill. It is attached extremely with thermally insulated pipelines through the\ntrough. The fluid is forced flow using small pump which is powered by PV\nsystem. The multi-stage solar still water desalination system was designed to\nrecover latent heat from evaporation and condensation processes in 2 stages.\nThe results of tests demonstrate that the system produces about 3.6 kg of fresh\nwater for only 5 hours from 10:00 to 15:30.the The system components were\nfabricated and the overall system was assembled in International Center for\nScience & High Technology & Environmental Science, Mahan, Iran.\n", "  We perform a systematic search for all possible massive deformations of IIA\nsupergravity in ten dimensions. We show that there exist exactly two\npossibilities: Romans supergravity and Howe-Lambert-West supergravity. Along\nthe way we give the full details of the ten-dimensional superspace formulation\nof the latter. The scalar superfield at canonical mass dimension zero (whose\nlowest component is the dilaton), present in both Romans and massless IIA\nsupergravities, is not introduced from the outset but its existence follows\nfrom a certain integrability condition implied by the Bianchi identities. This\nfact leads to the possibility for a certain topological modification of\nmassless IIA, reflecting an analogous situation in eleven dimensions.\n", "  In previous papers, we have investigated the classical theory of Barut and\nZanghi (BZ) for the electron spin [which interpreted the Zitterbewegung (zbw)\nmotion as an internal motion along helical paths], and its \"quantum\" version,\nby using the language of Clifford algebras. And, in so doing, we ended with a\nnew non-linear Dirac-like equation (NDE). We want to readdress in this Review\nthe whole subject, and extend it, by translating it however into the ordinary\ntensorial language, within the frame of the first quantization formalism. In\nparticular, we re-derive here the NDE for the electron field, and show it to be\nassociated with a new conserved probability current (which allows us to work\nout a quantum probabilistic interpretation of our NDE). Actually, the Dirac\nequation is obtained from the former NDE just by averaging over a zbw cycle. We\nthen derive an equation of motion for the 4-velocity field which will allow us\nto regard the electron as an extended-type object with a classically\nintelligible internal structure. We carefully study the solutions of the NDE;\nwith special attention to those implying (at the classical limit) light-like\nhelical motions, which appear to be the most adequate solutions for the\nelectron description from a kinematical and physical point of view, and do cope\nwith the electromagnetic properties of the electron. At last we propose a\nnatural generalization of our approach, for the case in which an external\nelectromagnetic potential A^\\mu is present; it happens to be based on a new\nsystem of five first-order differential field equations.\n", "  We report upon a novel principle for realization of a fast nondeterministic\nrandom number generator whose randomness relies on intrinsic randomness of the\nquantum physical processes of photonic emission in semiconductors and\nsubsequent detection by the photoelectric effect. Timing information of\ndetected photons is used to generate binary random digits-bits. The bit\nextraction method based on restartable clock theoretically eliminates both bias\nand autocorrelation while reaching efficiency of almost 0.5 bits per random\nevent. A prototype has been built and statistically tested.\n"]}
