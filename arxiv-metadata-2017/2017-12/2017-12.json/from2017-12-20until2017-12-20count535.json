rolling wheels develop ripples\nabove a critical speed. The resulting pattern, known as \"washboard\" or\n\"corrugated\" road, is common on dry, unpaved roads. We investigated this\nphenomenon theoretically and experimentally, using laboratory-scale apparatus\nand beds of dry sand. A thick layer of sand on a circular track was forced by a\nrolling wheel on an arm whose weight and moment of inertia could be varied. We\ncompared the ripples made by the rolling wheel to those made using a simple\ninclined plow blade. We investigated the dependence of the critical speed on\nvarious parameters, and describe a scaling argument which leads to a\ndimensionless ratio, analogous to the hydrodynamic Froude number, which\ncontrols the instability. This represents the crossover between conservative,\ndynamic forces and dissipative, static forces. Above onset, wheel-driven\nripples move in the direction of motion of the wheel, but plow-driven ripples\nmove in the reverse direction for a narrow range of Froude numbers.\n", "  We study the quantum geometry of the class of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which\nare elliptic fibrations over a two-dimensional toric base. A holomorphic\nanomaly equation for the topological string free energy is proposed, which is\niterative in the genus expansion as well as in the curve classes in the base.\nT-duality on the fibre implies that the topological string free energy also\ncaptures the BPS-invariants of D4-branes wrapping the elliptic fibre and a\nclass in the base. We verify this proposal by explicit computation of the BPS\ninvariants of 3 D4-branes on the rational elliptic surface.\n", "  Vanadium dioxide(VO$_2$) is a paradigmatic example of a strongly correlated\nsystem that undergoes a metal-insulator transition at a structural phase\ntransition. To date, this transition has necessitated significant post-hoc\nadjustments to theory in order to be described properly. Here we report\nstandard state-of-the-art first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\ncalculations of the structural dependence of the properties of VO$_2$. Using\nthis technique, we simulate the interactions between electrons explicitly,\nwhich allows for the metal-insulator transition to naturally emerge,\nimportantly without ad-hoc adjustments. The QMC calculations show that the\nstructural transition directly causes the metal-insulator transition and a\nchange in the coupling of vanadium spins. This change in the spin coupling\nresults in a prediction of a momentum-independent magnetic excitation in the\ninsulating state. While two-body correlations are important to set the stage\nfor this transition, they do not change significantly when VO$_2$ becomes an\ninsulator. These results show that it is now possible to account for electron\ncorrelations in a quantitatively accurate way that is also specific to\nmaterials.\n", "  Agegraphic dark energy(ADE) and New-ADE models have been introduced as two\ncandidates for dark energy to explain the accelerated expansion phase of the\nUniverse. In spite of a few suitable features of these models some studies have\nshown that there are several drawbacks in them. Therefore in this investigation\na new version of ADE and New-ADE are studied which can improve such drawbacks\nwhich appear in the ordinary ADE and New-ADE scenario. In fact we consider an\ninteracting model of scalar field with matter and after re-deriving some\ncosmological parameters of the model, we find out the best fit for the model.\nActually by finding the best fitting for free parameters of the model, we show\nthat our theoretical results are in a good agreement with observational data.\n", "  A high resolution (0.05 m) water isotopic record ($\\delta^{18}\\mathrm{O}$) is\navailable from the NorthGRIP ice core. In this study we look into the water\nisotope diffusion history as estimated by the spectral characteristics of the\n$\\delta^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ time series covering the last 16,000 years. The\ndiffusion of water vapor in the porous medium of the firn pack attenuates the\ninitial isotopic signal, predominantly having an impact on the high frequency\ncomponents of the power spectrum. Higher temperatures induce higher rates of\nsmoothing and thus the signal can be used as a firn paleothermometer. We use a\nwater isotope diffusion model coupled to a steady-state densification model in\norder to infer the temperature signal from the site, assuming the accumulation\nand strain rate history as estimated using the GICC05 layer counted chronology\nand a Dansgaard--Johnsen ice flow model. The temperature reconstruction\naccurately captures the timing and magnitude of the B{\\o}lling--Aller{\\o}d and\nYounger Dryas transitions. A Holocene climatic optimum is seen between 7 and 9\nky b2k with an apparent cooling trend thereafter. Our temperature estimate for\nthe Holocene climatic optimum, points to a necessary adjustment of the ice\nthinning function indicating that the ice flow model overestimates past\naccumulation rates by about 10\\% at 8 ky b2k. Finally, the record presents a\nclimatic variability over the Holocene spanning millennial and centennial\nscales with a profound cooling occurring at approximately 4000 years b2k. The\nnew reconstruction technique is able to provide past temperature estimates by\novercoming the issues apparent in the use of the classical\n$\\delta^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ slope method. It can in the same time resolve\ntemperature signals at low and high frequencies.\n", "  This is the supporting online material for the manuscript arXiv:1404.4201\n\"Water isotope diffusion rates from the NorthGRIP ice core for the last 16,000\nyears - glaciological and paleoclimatic implications.\"\n", "  Models postulating the existence of additional spacelike dimensions of\nmacroscopic or even infinite size, while viewing our observable universe as\nmerely a 3-brane living in a higher-dimensional bulk were a major breakthrough\nwhen proposed some 15 years ago. The most interesting among them both in terms\nof elegance of the setup and of the richness of the emerging phenomenology is\nthe Randall-Sundrum II model where one infinite extra spacelike dimension is\nconsidered with an AdS topology, characterized by the warping effect caused by\nthe presence of a negative cosmological constant in the bulk. A major drawback\nof this model is that despite numerous efforts no line element has ever been\nfound that could describe a stable, regular, realistic black hole. Finding a\nsmoothly behaved such solution supported by the presence of some more or less\nconventional fields either in the bulk and/or on the brane is the core of the\nblack hole challenge. After a comprehensive presentation of the details of the\nmodel and the analysis of the significance and the utility of getting a\nspecific analytic black hole solution, several (unsuccessful) analytic and\nnumerical approaches to the problem developed over the years are presented with\nsome discussion about their results. The chapter closes with the latest\nnumerical results that actually consists a major advancement in the effort to\naddress the challenge, the presentation of the most recent analytic work trying\n(and unfortunately failing) to build a solution assuming the existence of\nunconventional scalar fields and some ideas about the routes the forthcoming\nanalytic approaches should explore.\n", "  We have used all 20 archival XMM-Newton observations of PKS 2155-304 with\nsimultaneous X-ray and UV/optical data to study its long term flux and spectral\nvariability. We find significant variations, in all bands, on time-scales of\nyears with an rms amplitude of ~ 35-45 per cent, through the optical/UV\nvariations are not correlated with those in the X-ray. We constructed SEDs that\nspan more than three orders of magnitude in frequency and we first fitted them\nwith a log-parabolic model; such models have been applied many times in the\npast for this, and other, blazars. These fits were poor, so we then examined\ncombined power-law and log-parabolic fits that are improvements. These models\nindicate that the optical/UV and X-ray flux variations are mainly driven by\nmodel normalization variations, but the X-ray band flux is also affected by\nspectral variations, as parametrized with the model 'curvature' parameter, b.\nOverall, the energy at which the emitted power is maximum correlates positively\nwith the total flux. As the spectrum shifts to higher frequencies, the spectral\n'curvature' increase, in contrast to what is expected if a single log-parabolic\nmodel were an acceptable representation of the broad band SEDs. Our results\nsuggest that the optical/UV and X-ray emissions in this source may arise from\ndifferent lepton populations.\n", "  We propose a method of measuring extremely weak magnetic fields in the\nintergalactic medium prior to and during the epoch of cosmic reionization. The\nmethod utilizes the Larmor precession of spin-polarized neutral hydrogen in the\ntriplet state of the hyperfine transition. This precession leads to a\nsystematic change in the brightness temperature fluctuations of the 21-cm line\nfrom the high-redshift universe, and thus the statistics of these fluctuations\nencode information about the magnetic field the atoms are immersed in. The\nmethod is most suited to probing fields that are coherent on large scales; in\nthis paper, we consider a homogenous magnetic field over the scale of the 21-cm\nfluctuations. Due to the long lifetime of the triplet state of the 21-cm\ntransition, this technique is naturally sensitive to extremely weak field\nstrengths, of order $10^{-19}$ G at a reference redshift of $\\sim 20$ (or\n$10^{-21}$ G if scaled to the present day). Therefore, this might open up the\npossibility of probing primordial magnetic fields just prior to reionization.\nIf the magnetic fields are much stronger, it is still possible to use this\nmethod to infer their direction, and place a lower limit on their strength. In\nthis paper (Paper I in a series on this effect), we perform detailed\ncalculations of the microphysics behind this effect, and take into account all\nthe processes that affect the hyperfine transition, including radiative decays,\ncollisions, and optical pumping by Lyman-$\\alpha$ photons. We conclude with an\nanalytic formula for the brightness temperature of linear-regime fluctuations\nin the presence of a magnetic field, and discuss its limiting behavior for weak\nand strong fields.\n", "  We give a general description of the moment cone associated with an arbitrary\nfinite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact, connected Lie group in\nterms of finitely many linear inequalities. Our method is based on combining\ndifferential-geometric arguments with a variant of Ressayre's notion of a\ndominant pair. As applications, we obtain generalizations of Horn's\ninequalities to arbitrary representations, new inequalities for the one-body\nquantum marginal problem in physics, which concerns the asymptotic support of\nthe Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group, and a geometric\ninterpretation of the Howe-Lee-Tan-Willenbring invariants for the tensor\nproduct algebra.\n", "  We estimate the reach of the 14 TeV LHC and future hadronic and leptonic\ncolliders in the parameter space of the minimal composite Higgs model,\noutlining the complementarity of direct resonance searches and indirect\ninformation from the measurements of the Higgs boson couplings. The reach on\nelectroweak charged spin-one resonances, taken here as representative direct\nsignatures, is obtained from the current 8 TeV LHC limits by an extrapolation\nprocedure which we outline and validate. The impact of electroweak precision\ntests, and their possible improvement at future colliders, is also quantified.\n", "  \"Arithmetic random waves\" are the Gaussian Laplace eigenfunctions on the\ntwo-dimensional torus (Rudnick and Wigman (2008), Krishnapur, Kurlberg and\nWigman (2013)). In this paper we find that their nodal length converges to a\nnon-universal (non-Gaussian) limiting distribution, depending on the angular\ndistribution of lattice points lying on circles. Our argument has two main\ningredients. An explicit derivation of the Wiener-It\\^o chaos expansion for the\nnodal length shows that it is dominated by its $4$th order chaos component (in\nparticular, somewhat surprisingly, the second order chaos component vanishes).\nThe rest of the argument relies on the precise analysis of the fourth order\nchaotic component.\n", "  Here we report our recent results of variability studies in optical and X-ray\nbands of three blazars namely 3C 273, PKS 2155 - 304 and BL Lacertae with\nXMM-Newton. We found large amplitude optical to X-rays variability in 3C 273,\nand PKS 2155 - 304 on year time scale. In 3C 273, we noticed that synchrotron\ncooling and particle acceleration are at work at different epoch of\nobservations. In PKS 2155 - 304, spectral energy distribution from optical to\nX-ray is fitted with LPPL (log parabolic + power law) model. In BL Lacertae,\noptical flux and degree of polarization were anti-correlated.\n", "  We analyzed the multi-band optical behaviour of the BL Lacertae object, S5\n0716+714, during its outburst state from 2014 November - 2015 March. We took\ndata on 23 nights at three observatories, one in India and two in Bulgaria,\nmaking quasi-simultaneous observations in B, V, R, and I bands. We measured\nmulti-band optical fluxes, colour and spectral variations for this blazar on\nintraday and short timescales. The source was in a flaring state during the\nperiod analyzed and displayed intense variability in all wavelengths. R band\nmagnitude of 11.6 was attained by the target on 18 Jan 2015, which is the\nbrightest value ever recorded for S5 0716+714. The discrete correlation\nfunction method yielded good correlation between the bands with no measurable\ntime lags, implying that radiation in these bands originate from the same\nregion and by the same mechanism. We also used the structure function technique\nto look for characteristic timescales in the light curves. During the times of\nrapid variability, no evidence for the source to display spectral changes with\nmagnitude was found on either of the timescales. The amplitude of variations\ntends to increase with increasing frequency with a maximum of $\\sim$ 22% seen\nduring flaring states in B band. A mild trend of larger variability amplitude\nas the source brightens was also found. We found the duty cycle of our source\nduring the analyzed period to be $\\sim$ 90%. We also investigated the optical\nspectral energy distribution of S5 0716+714 using B, V, R, and I data points\nfor 21 nights. We briefly discuss physical mechanisms most likely responsible\nfor its flux and spectral variations.\n", "  To search for optical variability on a wide range of timescales, we have\ncarried out photometric monitoring of 3C 454.3, 3C 279 and S5 0716+714. CCD\nmagnitudes in B, V, R and I pass-bands were determined for $\\sim$ 7000 new\noptical observations from 114 nights made during 2011 - 2014, with an average\nlength of $\\sim$ 4 h each, at seven optical telescopes. We measured multiband\noptical flux and colour variations on diverse timescales. We also investigated\nits spectral energy distribution using B, V, R, I, J and K pass-band data. We\ndiscuss possible physical causes of the observed spectral variability.\n", "  The incorporation of bulk viscosity process to General Relativity leads to\nthe appearance of nonsingular backgrounds that, at early and late times, depict\nan accelerated universe. These backgrounds could be analytically calculated and\nmimicked, in the context of General Relativity, by a single scalar field whose\npotential could also be obtained analytically. We will show that, we can build\nviable backgrounds that, at early times, depict an inflationary universe\nleading to a power spectrum of cosmological perturbations which match with\ncurrent observational data, and after leaving the inflationary phase, the\nuniverse suffers a phase transition needed to explain the reheating of the\nuniverse via gravitational particle production, and finally, at late times, it\nenters into the de Sitter phase that can explain the current cosmic\nacceleration.\n", "  We present the peculiar in-plane velocities derived from the LAMOST red clump\nstars. From the variations of the in-plane velocity with the Galactocentric\nradius for the young and old red clump stars, we are able to identify two types\nof peculiar velocities: 1) both the two red clump populations show that the\nradial velocity is negative within $R=9.0$\\,kpc and becomes positive beyond\n(denoted as the \\emph{long-wave} mode); and 2) the young red clump stars show\nlarger mean radial velocity than the old population by about 3\\,km$\\rm s^{-1}$\nbetween $R=9$ and 12\\,kpc (denoted as the \\emph{short-wave} mode). We find that\nthe elliptical disk induced by the rotating bar can well explain the\n\\emph{long-wave} mode peculiar velocity. The axis ratio of the elliptical disk\nis around 0.8-0.95 and the disk keeps circular at $R=9.24\\pm0.2$\\,kpc, which\nshould be the location of the outer Lindblad resonance radius (OLR). Adopting\nthe circular speed of 238\\,km$\\rm s^{-1}$, the pattern speed of the bar is then\nderived as $48\\pm3$\\,km$\\rm s^{-1}$kpc$^{-1}$ from the location of OLR. On the\nother hand, the \\emph{short-wave} mode is likely the perturbation of the spiral\narms as density waves.\n", "  Dark plasma is an intriguing form of self-interacting dark matter with an\neffective fluid-like behavior, which is well motivated by various theoretical\nparticle physics models. We aim to find an explanation for an isolated mass\nclump in the Abell 520 system, which cannot be explained by traditional models\nof dark matter, but has been detected in weak lensing observations. We\nperformed N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy cluster\ncollisions with a two component model of dark matter, which is assumed to\nconsist of a predominant non-interacting dark matter component and a 10-40\npercent mass fraction of dark plasma. The mass of a possible dark clump was\ncalculated for each simulation in a parameter scan over the underlying model\nparameters. In two higher resolution simulations shock-waves and Mach cones\nwere observed to form in the dark plasma halos. By choosing suitable simulation\nparameters, the observed distributions of dark matter in both the Bullet\nCluster (1E 0657-558) and Abell 520 (MS 0451.5+0250) can be qualitatively\nreproduced.\n", "  We present results of $^{23}$Na and $^{19}$F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nmeasurements on NaCaCo$_2$F$_7$, a frustrated pyrochlore magnet with a\nCurie-Weiss temperature, $T_{cw}$ ~-140 K, and intrinsic bond disorder. Below\n3.6 K both the $^{23}$Na and $^{19}$F spectra broaden substantially in\ncomparison to higher temperatures accompanied by a considerable reduction (80\n\\%) of the NMR signal intensity: This proves a broad quasi-static field\ndistribution. The $^{19}$F spin-lattice relaxation rate $^{19}(1/T_1$) exhibits\na peak at 2.9 K already starting to develop below 10 K. We attribute the spin\nfreezing to the presence of bond disorder. This is corroborated by large-scale\nMonte-Carlo simulations of a classical bond-disordered XY model on the\npyrochlore lattice. The low freezing temperature, together with the very short\nmagnetic correlation length not captured by the simulations, suggesting that\nquantum effects play a decisive role in NaCaCo$_2$F$_7$.\n", "  I consider here acceleration and heating of relativistic outflow by local\nmagnetic energy dissipation process in Poynting flux dominated outflow.\nAdopting the standard assumption that the reconnection rate scales with the\nAlfven speed, I show here that the fraction of energy dissipated as thermal\nphotons cannot exceed (13 $\\hat \\gamma -14)^{-1} = 30$% (for adiabatic index\n$\\hat \\gamma = 4/3$) of the kinetic energy at the photosphere. Even in the most\nradiatively efficient scenario, the energy released as non-thermal photons\nduring the prompt phase is at most equal to the kinetic energy of the outflow.\nThese results imply that calorimetry of the kinetic energy that can be done\nduring the afterglow phase, could be used to constrain the magnetization of\ngamma-ray bursts (GRB) outflows. I discuss the recent observational status, and\nits implications on constraining the magnetization in GRB outflows.\n", "  The dynamical organization of membrane-bound organelles along intracellular\ntransport pathways relies on vesicular exchange between organelles and on\nbiochemical maturation of the organelle content by specific enzymes. The\nrelative importance of each mechanism in controlling organelle dynamics remains\ncontroversial, in particular for transport through the Golgi apparatus. Using a\nstochastic model, we show that full maturation of membrane-bound compartments\ncan be seen as the stochastic escape from a steady-state in which export is\ndominated by vesicular exchange. We show that full maturation can contribute a\nsignificant fraction of the total out-flux for small organelles such as\nendosomes and Golgi cisternae.\n", "  Thin films of Amorphous indium oxide undergo a magnetic field driven\nsuperconducting to insulator quantum phase transition. In the insulating phase,\nthe current-voltage characteristics show large current discontinuities due to\noverheating of electrons. We show that the onset voltage for the\ndiscontinuities vanishes as we approach the quantum critical point.\n  As a result the insulating phase becomes unstable with respect to any applied\nvoltage making it, at least experimentally, immeasurable.\n  We emphasize that unlike previous reports of the absence of linear response\nnear quantum phase transitions, in our system, the departure from equilibrium\nis discontinuous. Because the conditions for these discontinuities are\nsatisfied in most insulators at low temperatures, and due to the decay of all\ncharacteristic energy scales near quantum phase transitions, we believe that\nthis instability is general and should occur in various systems while\napproaching their quantum critical point. Accounting for this instability is\ncrucial for determining the critical behavior of systems near the transition.\n", "  Blazars can be divided into two sub-classes namely high energy and low energy\npeaked blazars. In spectral energy distribution, the first synchrotron hump of\nthe former class peaks in UV/X-rays and in IR/optical bands for the latter\nclass. The peak of the spectral energy distribution seems to be responsible for\nvariability properties of these classes of blazars in X-ray and optical bands.\nSince, in low energy peaked blazars, the X-ray bands lies well below the\nsynchrotron hump, one expects that the highest energy electrons available for\nthe synchrotron emission would have slower effect of variability on X-ray\nintra-day timescale. In this paper, by taking the advantage of a sample of 12\nlow energy peaked blazars with total 50 observations from XMM$-$Newton since\nits launch, we confirm that this class is less variable in X-ray bands. We\nfound that out of 50 observational light curves, genuine intra-day variability\nis present in only two of light curves i.e 4%. Similar results we obtained from\nour earlier optical intra-day variability studies of high energy peaked blazars\nwhere out of 144 light curves, only genuine intra-day variability was detected\nin 6 light curves i.e ~ 4%. Since, X-ray bands lie below the peak of the\nspectral energy distribution of LSPs where inverse Compton mechanism is\ndominating rather than synchrotron radiation at the peak of the optical band,\nleads to slower variability in the X-ray bands. Hence, reducing their intra-day\nvariability in X-ray bands as compared to the variability in optical bands.\n", "  The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) began\nobservations in July 2014. It pursues three core programs: APOGEE-2, MaNGA, and\neBOSS. In addition, eBOSS contains two major subprograms: TDSS and SPIDERS.\nThis paper describes the first data release from SDSS-IV, Data Release 13\n(DR13), which contains new data, reanalysis of existing data sets and, like all\nSDSS data releases, is inclusive of previously released data. DR13 makes\npublicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of\nnearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It\nincludes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to\ntargeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected\nobjects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new\nreductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric\ncalibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the\nAPOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously\nincluded and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For\nthe SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric\ncalibrations. Several value-added catalogs are being released in tandem with\nDR13, in particular target catalogs relevant for eBOSS, TDSS, and SPIDERS, and\nan updated red-clump catalog for APOGEE. This paper describes the location and\nformat of the data now publicly available, as well as providing references to\nthe important technical papers that describe the targeting, observing, and data\nreduction. The SDSS website, http://www.sdss.org, provides links to the data,\ntutorials and examples of data access, and extensive documentation of the\nreduction and analysis procedures. DR13 is the first of a scheduled set that\nwill contain new data and analyses from the planned ~6-year operations of\nSDSS-IV.\n", "  We further investigate postulates for realist versions of relativistic\nquantum theory and quantum field theory in Minkowski space and other background\nspace-times. According to these postulates, quantum theory is supplemented by\nlocal variables that depend on possible outcomes of hypothetical measurements\non the late time electromagnetic field in spacelike separated regions. We\nillustrate the implications in simple examples using photon wave mechanics, and\ndiscuss possible extensions to quantum field theory.\n", "  We report electron-hole conduction asymmetry in monolayer graphene.\nPreviously, it has been claimed that electron-hole conduction asymmetry is due\nto imbalanced carrier injection from metallic electrodes. Here, we show that\nmetallic contacts have negligible impact on asymmetric conduction and may be\neither sample or device-dependent phenomena. Electrical measurements show that\nmonolayer graphene based devices exhibit suppressed electron conduction\ncompared to hole conduction due to the presence of donor impurities which\nscatter electrons more efficiently. This can be explained by the relativistic\nnature of charge carriers in a graphene monolayer and can be reconciled with\nthe fact that in a relativistic quantum system transport cross section does\ndepend on the sign of scattering potential in contrast to a nonrelativistic\nquantum system.\n", "  A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk creates a gap. This process\nis important for both theory and observations. Using results of a survey for a\nwide parameter range with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we\nconstructed an empirical formula for the gap structure (i.e., the radial\nsurface density distribution), which can reproduce the gap width and depth\nobtained by two-dimensional simulations. This formula enables us to judge\nwhether an observed gap is likely to be caused by an embedded planet or not.\nThe propagation of waves launched by the planet is closely connected to the gap\nstructure. It makes the gap wider and shallower as compared with the case where\nan instantaneous wave damping is assumed. The hydrodynamic simulations shows\nthat the waves do not decay immediately at the launching point of waves, even\nwhen the planet is as massive as Jupiter. Based on the results of hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we also obtained an empirical model of wave propagation and\ndamping for the cases of deep gaps. The one-dimensional gap model with our wave\npropagation model is able to well reproduce the gap structures in hydrodynamic\nsimulations. In the case of a Jupiter-mass planet, we also found that the waves\nwith smaller wavenumber (e.g., $m=2$) are excited and transport the angular\nmomentum to the location far away from the planet. The wave with $m=2$ is\nclosely related with a secondary wave launched by the site opposite from the\nplanet.\n", "  Gravitational lensing by large-scale structure significantly impacts\nobservations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): it smooths the acoustic\npeaks in temperature and $E$-mode polarization power spectra, correlating\npreviously uncorrelated modes; and it converts $E$-mode polarization into\n$B$-mode polarization. The act of measuring and removing the effect of lensing\nfrom CMB maps, or delensing, has been well studied in the context of $B$ modes,\nbut little attention has been given to the delensing of the temperature and $E$\nmodes. In this paper, we model the expected delensed $T$ and $E$ power spectra\nto all orders in the lensing potential, demonstrating the sharpening of the\nacoustic peaks and a significant reduction in lens-induced power spectrum\ncovariances. We then perform cosmological forecasts, demonstrating that\ndelensing will yield improved sensitivity to parameters with upcoming surveys.\nWe highlight the breaking of the degeneracy between the effective number of\nneutrino species and primordial helium fraction as a concrete application. We\nalso show that delensing increases cosmological information as long as the\nmeasured lensing reconstruction is included in the analysis. We conclude that\nwith future data, delensing will be crucial not only for primordial $B$-mode\nscience but for a range of other observables as well.\n", "  The realization of an elementary quantum network that is intrinsically secure\nand operates over long distances requires the interconnection of several\nquantum modules performing different tasks. In this work we report the\ninterconnection of four different quantum modules: (i) a random polarization\nqubit generator, (ii) a free-space quantum communication channel, (iii) an\nultra-low noise portable quantum memory and (iv) a qubit decoder, in a\nfunctional elementary quantum network possessing all capabilities needed for\nquantum information distribution protocols. We create weak coherent pulses at\nthe single photon level encoding polarization states $|H\\rangle, |V\\rangle,\n|D\\rangle, |A\\rangle$ in a randomized sequence. The random qubits are sent over\na free-space link and coupled into a dual rail room temperature quantum memory\nand after storage and retrieval are analyzed in a four detector polarization\nanalysis akin to the requirements of the BB84 protocol. We also show ultra-low\nnoise and fully-portable operation, paving the way towards memory assisted\nall-environment free space quantum cryptographic networks.\n", "  Geometrical properties of energy bands underlie fascinating phenomena in a\nwide-range of systems, including solid-state materials, ultracold gases and\nphotonics. Most famously, local geometrical characteristics like the Berry\ncurvature can be related to global topological invariants such as those\nclassifying quantum Hall states or topological insulators. Regardless of the\nband topology, however, any non-zero Berry curvature can have important\nconsequences, such as in the semi-classical evolution of a wave packet. Here,\nwe experimentally demonstrate for the first time that wave packet dynamics can\nbe used to directly map out the Berry curvature. To this end, we use optical\npulses in two coupled fibre loops to study the discrete time-evolution of a\nwave packet in a 1D geometrical \"charge\" pump, where the Berry curvature leads\nto an anomalous displacement of the wave packet under pumping. This is both the\nfirst direct observation of Berry curvature effects in an optical system, and,\nmore generally, the proof-of-principle demonstration that semi-classical\ndynamics can serve as a high-resolution tool for mapping out geometrical\nproperties.\n", "  We present the first results from an optical reverberation mapping campaign\nexecuted in 2014, targeting the active galactic nuclei (AGN) MCG+08-11-011, NGC\n2617, NGC 4051, 3C 382, and Mrk 374. Our targets have diverse and interesting\nobservational properties, including a \"changing look\" AGN and a broad-line\nradio galaxy. Based on continuum-H$\\beta$ lags, we measure black hole masses\nfor all five targets. We also obtain H$\\gamma$ and He{\\sc ii}\\,$\\lambda 4686$\nlags for all objects except 3C 382. The He{\\sc ii}\\,$\\lambda 4686$ lags\nindicate radial stratification of the BLR, and the masses derived from\ndifferent emission lines are in general agreement. The relative responsivities\nof these lines are also in qualitative agreement with photoionization models.\nThese spectra have extremely high signal-to-noise ratios (100--300 per pixel)\nand there are excellent prospects for obtaining velocity-resolved reverberation\nsignatures.\n", "  The quantum Rabi model describing the fundamental interaction between light\nand matter is a cornerstone of quantum physics. It predicts exotic phenomena\nlike quantum phase transitions and ground-state entanglement in the\nultrastrong-coupling (USC) regime, where coupling strengths are comparable to\nsubsystem energies. Despite progress in many experimental platforms, the few\nexperiments reaching USC have been limited to spectroscopy: demonstrating USC\ndynamics remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we employ a circuit QED chip\nwith moderate coupling between a resonator and transmon qubit to realise\naccurate digital quantum simulation of USC dynamics. We advance the state of\nthe art in solid-state digital quantum simulation by using up to 90\nsecond-order Trotter steps and probing both subsystems in a combined Hilbert\nspace dimension $\\sim80$, demonstrating the Schr\\\"odinger-cat like entanglement\nand build-up of large photon numbers characteristic of deep USC. This work\nopens the door to exploring extreme USC regimes, quantum phase transitions and\nmany-body effects in the Dicke model.\n", "  We propose to develop mean field theory in combination with Glauber\nalgorithm, to model and interpret protein dynamics and structure formation in\nsmall to wide angle x-ray scattering (S/WAXS) experiments. We develop the\nmethodology by analysing the Engrailed homeodomain protein as an example. We\ndemonstrate how to interpret S/WAXS data with a good precision and over an\nextended temperature range. We explain experimentally observed phenomena in\nterms of protein phase structure, and we make predictions for future\nexperiments how the scattering data behaves at different ambient temperature\nvalues. We conclude that a combination of mean field theory with Glauber\nalgorithm has the potential to develop into a highly accurate, computationally\neffective and predictive tool for analysing S/WAXS data. Finally, we compare\nour results with those obtained previously in an all-atom molecular dynamics\nsimulation.\n", "  We developed a modification to the calculation of the two-point correlation\nfunction commonly used in the analysis of large scale structure in cosmology.\nAn estimator of the two-point correlation function is constructed by\ncontrasting the observed distribution of galaxies with that of a uniformly\npopulated random catalog. Using the assumption that the distribution of random\ngalaxies in redshift is independent of angular position allows us to replace\npairwise combinatorics with fast integration over probability maps. The new\nmethod significantly reduces the computation time while simultaneously\nincreasing the precision of the calculation. It also allows to introduce\ncosmological parameters only at the last and least computationally expensive\nstage, which is helpful when exploring various choices for these parameters.\n", "  We perform a theoretical analysis of the observational dependence between\nangular momentum of the galaxy clusters and their mass (richness), based on the\nmethod introduced in our previous paper. For that we obtain the distribution\nfunction of astronomical objects (like galaxies and/or smooth halos of\ndifferent kinds) gravitational fields due to their tidal interaction. Within\nthe statistical method of Chandrasekhar we are able to show that the\ndistribution function is determined by the form of interaction between objects\nand for multipole (tidal) interaction it is never Gaussian. Our calculation\npermits to demonstrate how the alignment of galaxies angular momenta depend on\nthe cluster richness. The specific form of the corresponding dependence is due\nto assumptions made about cluster morphology. Our approach also predicts the\ntime evolution of stellar objects angular momenta within CDM and $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodels. Namely, we have shown that angular momentum of galaxies increases with\ntime.\n", "  Why does a microwave oven work? How does biological tissue absorb\nelectromagnetic radiation? Astonishingly, we do not have a definite answer to\nthese simple questions because the microscopic processes governing the\nabsorption of electromagnetic waves by water are largely unclarified. This\nabsorption can be quantified by dielectric loss spectra, which reveal a huge\npeak at a frequency of the exciting electric field of about 20 GHz and a\ngradual tailing off towards higher frequencies. The microscopic interpretation\nof such spectra is highly controversial and various superpositions of\nrelaxation and resonance processes ascribed to single-molecule or\nmolecule-cluster motions have been proposed for their analysis. By combining\ndielectric, microwave, THz, and far-infrared spectroscopy, here we provide\nnearly continuous temperature-dependent broadband spectra of water. Moreover,\nwe find that corresponding spectra for aqueous solutions reveal the same\nfeatures as pure water. However, in contrast to the latter, crystallization in\nthese solutions can be avoided by supercooling. As different spectral\ncontributions tend to disentangle at low temperatures, this enables to\ndeconvolute them when approaching the glass transition under cooling. We find\nthat the overall spectral development, including the 20 GHz feature (employed\nfor microwave heating), closely resembles the behavior known for common\nsupercooled liquids. Thus, water's absorption of electromagnetic waves at room\ntemperature is not unusual but very similar to that of glass-forming liquids at\nelevated temperatures, deep in the low-viscosity liquid regime, and should be\ninterpreted along similar lines.\n", "  Superconducting-gravimeter measurements are used to test the local Lorentz\ninvariance of the gravitational interaction and of matter-gravity couplings.\nThe best laboratory sensitivities to date are achieved via a maximum-reach\nanalysis for 13 Lorentz-violating operators, with some improvements exceeding\nan order of magnitude.\n", "  We present an upgrade to the particle-in-cell ion beam simulation code OPAL\nthat enables us to run highly realistic simulations of the spiral inflector\nsystem of a compact cyclotron. This upgrade includes a new geometry class and\nfield solver that can handle the complicated boundary conditions posed by the\nelectrode system in the central region of the cyclotron both in terms of\nparticle termination, and calculation of self-fields. Results are benchmarked\nagainst the analytical solution of a coasting beam. As a practical example, the\nspiral inflector and the first revolution in a 1 MeV/amu test cyclotron,\nlocated at Best Cyclotron Systems, Inc., are modeled and compared to the\nsimulation results. We find that OPAL can now handle arbitrary boundary\ngeometries with relative ease. Comparison of simulated injection efficiencies,\nand beam shape compare well with measured efficiencies and a preliminary\nmeasurement of the beam distribution after injection.\n", "  We present a Bayesian reconstruction algorithm that infers the\nthree-dimensional large-scale matter distribution from the weak gravitational\nlensing effects measured in the image shapes of galaxies. The algorithm is\ndesigned to also work with non-Gaussian posterior distributions which arise,\nfor example, from a non-Gaussian prior distribution. In this work, we use a\nlognormal prior and compare the reconstruction results to a Gaussian prior in a\nsuite of increasingly realistic tests on mock data. We find that in cases of\nhigh noise levels (i.e. for low source galaxy densities and/or high shape\nmeasurement uncertainties), both normal and lognormal priors lead to\nreconstructions of comparable quality, but with the lognormal reconstruction\nbeing prone to mass-sheet degeneracy. In the low-noise regime and on small\nscales, the lognormal model produces better reconstructions than the normal\nmodel: The lognormal model 1) enforces non-negative densities, while negative\ndensities are present when a normal prior is employed, 2) better traces the\nextremal values and the skewness of the true underlying distribution, and 3)\nyields a higher pixel-wise correlation between the reconstruction and the true\ndensity.\n", "  We have recently suggested that dust growth in the cold gas phase dominates\nthe dust abundance in elliptical galaxies while dust is efficiently destroyed\nin the hot X-ray emitting plasma (hot gas). In order to understand the dust\nevolution in elliptical galaxies, we construct a simple model that includes\ndust growth in the cold gas and dust destruction in the hot gas. We also take\ninto account the effect of mass exchange between these two gas components\ninduced by active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. We survey reasonable ranges\nof the relevant parameters in the model and find that AGN feedback cycles\nactually produce a variety in cold gas mass and dust-to-gas ratio. By comparing\nwith an observational sample of nearby elliptical galaxies, we find that,\nalthough the dust-to-gas ratio varies by an order of magnitude in our model,\nthe entire range of the observed dust-to-gas ratios is difficult to be\nreproduced under a single parameter set. Variation of the dust growth\nefficiency is the most probable solution to explain the large variety in\ndust-to-gas ratio of the observational sample. Therefore, dust growth can play\na central role in creating the variation in dust-to-gas ratio through the AGN\nfeedback cycle and through the variation in dust growth efficiency.\n", "  We investigate the renormalization group (RG) running of the effective\npotential and the pole mass in the broken symmetry phase of the $R_{\\xi }$ and\nthe $\\overline{R_{\\xi }}$ gauges which have different RG running for the\neffective potential in the symmetric phase and show that if the vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV) is expressed as a function of the other parameters of\nthe theory by solving the minimization condition, then the effective potential\nin the broken symmetry phase in both gauges satisfies the same RG equation as\none in the symmetric phase of the $\\overline{R_{\\xi }}$ gauge. The pole masses\nin the broken symmetry phase of both gauges are RG invariant with respect to\nthe RG funtions of the symmetric phase and are shown to be the same at one-loop\norder.\n", "  Spin transfer torque nano-oscillators are potential candidates for replacing\nthe traditional inductor based voltage controlled oscillators in modern\ncommunication devices. Typical oscillator designs are based on trilayer\nmagnetic tunnel junctions which are disadvantaged by low power outputs and poor\nconversion efficiencies. In this letter, we theoretically propose to use\nresonant spin filtering in pentalayer magnetic tunnel junctions as a possible\nroute to alleviate these issues and present device designs geared toward a high\nmicrowave output power and an efficient conversion of the d.c. input power. We\nattribute these robust qualities to the resulting non-trivial spin current\nprofiles and the ultra high tunnel magnetoresistance, both arising from\nresonant spin filtering. The device designs are based on the nonequilibrium\nGreen's function spin transport formalism self-consistently coupled with the\nstochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski's equation and the Poisson's\nequation. We demonstrate that the proposed structures facilitate oscillator\ndesigns featuring a large enhancement in microwave power of around $775\\%$ and\nan efficiency enhancement of over $1300\\%$ in comparison with typical trilayer\ndesigns. We also rationalize the optimum operating regions via an analysis of\nthe dynamic and static device resistances. This work sets stage for pentalyer\nspin transfer torque nano-oscillator device designs that extenuate most of the\nissues faced by the typical trilayer designs.\n", "  Recent localization of the repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) 121102 revealed\nthe distance of its host galaxy and luminosities of the bursts. We investigated\nconstraints on the young neutron star (NS) model, that (a) the FRB intrinsic\nluminosity is supported by the spin-down energy, and (b) the FRB duration is\nshorter than the NS rotation period. In the case of a circular cone emission\ngeometry, conditions (a) and (b) determine the NS parameters within very small\nranges, compared with that from only condition (a) discussed in previous works.\nAnisotropy of the pulsed emission does not affect the area of the allowed\nparameter region by virtue of condition (b). The determined parameters are\nconsistent with those independently limited by the properties of the possible\npersistent radio counterpart and the circumburst environments such as\nsurrounding materials. Since the NS in the allowed parameter region is older\nthan the spin-down timescale, the hypothetical GRP-like model expects a rapid\nradio flux decay of $\\lesssim1$ Jy within a few years as the spin-down\nluminosity decreases. The continuous monitoring will give a hint of\ndiscrimination of the models. If no flux evolution will be seen, we need to\nconsider an alternative model, e.g., the magnetically powered flare.\n", "  We show how the presence of entanglement in a bipartite Gaussian state can be\ndetected by the amount of work extracted by a continuos variable Szilard-like\ndevice, where the bipartite state serves as the working medium of the engine.\nWe provide an expression for the work extracted in such a process and\nspecialize it to the case of Gaussian states. The extractable work provides a\nsufficient condition to witness entanglement in generic two-mode states,\nbecoming also necessary for squeezed thermal states. We extend the protocol to\ntripartite Gaussian states, and show that the full structure of inseparability\nclasses cannot be discriminated based on the extractable work. This suggests\nthat bipartite entanglement is the fundamental resource underpinning work\nextraction.\n", "  High resolution submm observations are important in probing the morphology,\ncolumn density and dynamics of obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs). With\nhigh resolution (0.06 x 0.05) ALMA 690 GHz observations we have found bright\n(TB >80 K) and compact (FWHM 10x7 pc) CO 6-5 line emission in the nucleus of\nthe extremely radio-quiet galaxy NGC1377. The integrated CO 6-5 intensity is\naligned with the previously discovered jet/outflow of NGC1377 and is tracing\nthe dense (n>1e4 cm-3), hot gas at the base of the outflow. The velocity\nstructure is complex and shifts across the jet/outflow are discussed in terms\nof jet-rotation or separate, overlapping kinematical components. High velocity\ngas (deltaV +-145 km/s) is detected inside r<2-3 pc and we suggest that it is\nemerging from an inclined rotating disk or torus of position angle PA=140+-20\ndeg with a dynamical mass of approx 3e6 Msun. This mass is consistent with that\nof a supermassive black hole (SMBH), as inferred from the M-sigma relation. The\ngas mass of the proposed disk/torus constitutes <3% of the nuclear dynamical\nmass. In contrast to the intense CO 6-5 line emission, we do not detect dust\ncontinuum with an upper limit of S(690GHz)<2mJy. The corresponding, 5 pc, H2\ncolumn density is estimated to N(H2)<3e23 cm-2, which is inconsistent with a\nCompton Thick (CT) source. We discuss the possibility that CT obscuration may\nbe occuring on small (subparsec) or larger scales. From SED fitting we suggest\nthat half of the IR emission of NGC1377 is nuclear and the rest (mostly the\nfar-infrared (FIR)) is more extended. The extreme radio quietness, and the lack\nof emission from other star formation tracers, raise questions on the origin of\nthe FIR emission. We discuss the possibility that it is arising from the\ndissipation of shocks in the molecular jet/outflow or from irradiation by the\nnuclear source along the poles.\n", "  The interfacial phase-change memory (iPCM) GeTe/Sb2Te3, promising candidates\nfor the next generation non-volatile random-access memories, exhibits\nfascinating topological properties. Depending on the atomic-layer-stacking\nsequence of the GeTe block, the iPCM can be either in the SET (Ge-Te-Ge-Te) or\nRESET (Te-Ge-Ge-Te) states, where the former exhibits ferroelectric\npolarization and electrical conductivity two orders of magnitude larger than\nthat of the RESET state. But, its origin remains elusive. Here, we predict the\nemergence of a Weyl semimetal phase in the SET state induced by the\nferroelectric polarization which breaks the crystal inversion symmetry. We show\nthat the giant conductivity enhancement of the SET phase is due to the\nappearance of gapless Weyl nodes. The Ge-Te- or Sb-Te-terminated surfaces of\nWeyl semimetal iPCM produce surface states with completely distinctive\ntopology, where the former consists solely of Fermi arcs while the latter\nconsists of both closed Fermi surface and open Fermi arcs. The iPCM with van\nder Waals interfaces offers an ideal platform for exploiting the exotic Weyl\nproperties for future memory device applications.\n", "  Time measured by an ideal clock crucially depends on the gravitational\npotential and velocity of the clock according to general relativity.\nTechnological advances in manufacturing high-precision atomic clocks have\nrapidly improved their accuracy and stability over the last decade that\napproached the level of 10$^{-18}$. Based on a fully relativistic description\nof the background gravitational physics, we discuss the impact of those\nhighly-precise clocks on the realization of reference frames and time scales\nused in geodesy. We discuss the current definitions of basic geodetic concepts\nand come to the conclusion that the advances in clocks and other metrological\ntechnologies will soon require the re-definition of time scales or, at least,\nclarification to ensure their continuity and consistent use in practice. The\nrelative frequency shift between two clocks is directly related to the\ndifference in the values of the gravity potential at the points of clock's\nlocalization. According to general relativity the relative accuracy of clocks\nin 10$^{-18}$ is equivalent to measuring the gravitational red shift effect\nbetween two clocks with the height difference amounting to 1 cm. We show how\nclock measurements can provide geopotential numbers for the realization of\ngravity-field-related height systems and can resolve discrepancies in\nclassically-determined height systems as well as between national height\nsystems. Another application of clocks is the direct use of observed potential\ndifferences for the improved recovery of regional gravity field solutions.\nFinally, clock measurements for space-borne gravimetry are analyzed along with\nclosely-related deficiencies of this method like an extra-ordinary knowledge of\nthe spacecraft velocity, etc. For all these applications besides the\nnear-future prospects, we also discuss the challenges that are related to using\nthose novel clock data in geodesy.\n", "  We investigate the distribution of relative velocities between small heavy\nparticles of different sizes in turbulence by analysing a statistical model for\nbidisperse turbulent suspensions, containing particles with two different\nStokes numbers. This number, ${\\rm St}$, is a measure of particle inertia which\nin turn depends on particle size. When the Stokes numbers are similar, the\ndistribution exhibits power-law tails, just as in the case of equal ${\\rm St}$.\nThe power-law exponent is a non-analytic function of the mean Stokes number\n$\\overline{\\rm St}$, so that the exponent cannot be calculated in perturbation\ntheory around the advective limit. When the Stokes-number difference is larger,\nthe power law disappears, but the tails of the distribution still dominate the\nrelative-velocity moments, if $\\overline{\\rm St}$ is large enough.\n", "  The main results of our work is determining the differences between limiting\nproperties in various models of quantum stochastic walks. In particular, we\nprove that in the case of strongly connected and a class of weakly connected\ndirected graphs, local environment interaction evolution is relaxing, and in\nthe case of undirected graphs, global environment interaction evolution is\nconvergent. For other classes of directed graphs we show, that the character of\nconnectivity large influence on the limiting properties. We also study the\nlimiting properties for the non-moralizing global interaction case. We\ndemonstrate that the digraph observance is recovered in this case.\n", "  A linear unsaturating magnetoresistance at high perpendicular magnetic\nfields, together with a quadratic positive magnetoresistance at low fields, has\nbeen seen in many different experimental materials, ranging from silver\nchalcogenides and thin films of InSb to topological materials like graphene and\nDirac semimetals. In the literature, two very different theoretical approaches\nhave been used to explain this classical magnetoresistance as a consequence of\nsample disorder. The phenomenological Random Resistor Network model constructs\na grid of four-terminal resistors, each with a varying random resistance. The\nEffective Medium Theory model imagines a smoothly varying disorder potential\nthat causes a continuous variation of the local conductivity. Here, we\ndemonstrate numerically that both models belong to the same universality class\nand that a restricted class of the Random Resistor Network is actually\nequivalent to the Effective Medium Theory. Both models are also in good\nagreement with experiments on a diverse range of materials. Moreover, we show\nthat in both cases, a single parameter, i.e. the ratio of the fluctuations in\nthe carrier density to the average carrier density, completely determines the\nmagnetoresistance profile.\n", "  We review the lives, deaths and nucleosynthetic signatures of intermediate\nmass stars in the range approximately 6.5-12 Msun, which form super-AGB stars\nnear the end of their lives. We examine the critical mass boundaries both\nbetween different types of massive white dwarfs (CO, CO-Ne, ONe) and between\nwhite dwarfs and supernovae and discuss the relative fraction of super-AGB\nstars that end life as either an ONe white dwarf or as a neutron star (or an\nONeFe white dwarf), after undergoing an electron capture supernova. We also\ndiscuss the contribution of the other potential single-star channels to\nelectron-capture supernovae, that of the failed massive stars. We describe the\nfactors that influence these different final fates and mass limits, such as\ncomposition, the efficiency of convection, rotation, nuclear reaction rates,\nmass loss rates, and third dredge-up efficiency. We stress the importance of\nthe binary evolution channels for producing electron-capture supernovae. We\ndiscuss recent nucleosynthesis calculations and elemental yield results and\npresent a new set of s-process heavy element yield predictions. We assess the\ncontribution from super-AGB star nucleosynthesis in a Galactic perspective, and\nconsider the (super-)AGB scenario in the context of the multiple stellar\npopulations seen in globular clusters. A brief summary of recent works on dust\nproduction is included. Lastly we conclude with a discussion of the\nobservational constraints and potential future advances for study into these\nstars on the low mass/high mass star boundary.\n", "  A geometric entropy is defined as the Riemannian volume of the parameter\nspace of a statistical manifold associated with a given network. As such it can\nbe a good candidate for measuring networks complexity. Here we investigate its\nability to single out topological features of networks proceeding in a\nbottom-up manner: first we consider small size networks by analytical methods\nand then large size networks by numerical techniques. Two different classes of\nnetworks, the random graphs and the scale--free networks, are investigated\ncomputing their Betti numbers and then showing the capability of geometric\nentropy of detecting homologies.\n", "  In this work, we study the transmission properties of one dimensional finite\nperiodic systems with $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. A simple closed form expression\nis obtained for the total transmittance from a lattice of N cells, that allows\nus to describe the transmission minima (maxima) when the system is in the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken (broken) phase. Utilizing this expression, we provide\nthe necessary conditions, \\textit{independent} of the number of cells, for the\noccurrence of a CPA-laser for any finite $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric periodic\npotential. Under this conditions, we provide a recipe for building finite\nperiodic structures with near perfect absorption and extremely large\namplification.\n", "  We study the topological properties of magnon excitations in\nthree-dimensional antiferromagnets, where the ground state configuration is\ninvariant under time-reversal followed by space-inversion ($PT$-symmetry). We\nprove that Dirac points and nodal lines, the former being the limiting case of\nthe latter, are the generic forms of symmetry-protected band crossings between\nmagnon branches. As a concrete example, we study a Heisenberg spin model for a\n\"spin-web\" compound, Cu$_3$TeO$_6$, and show the presence of the magnon Dirac\npoints assuming a collinear magnetic structure. Upon turning on\nsymmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions, which introduce a small\nnon-collinearity in the ground state configuration, we find that the Dirac\npoints expand into nodal lines with nontrivial $Z_2$-topological charge, a new\ntype of nodal lines unpredicted in any materials so far.\n", "  Black holes are extraordinary massive objects which can be described\nclassically by general relativity, and topological insulators are new orders of\nmatter that could be use to built a topological quantum computer. They seem to\nbe different objects, but in this paper, we claim that the black hole can be\nconsidered as kind of topological insulator. For BTZ black hole in three\ndimensional $AdS_3$ spacetime we give two evidences to support this claim: the\nfirst evidence comes from the black hole \"membrane paradigm\", which says that\nthe horizon of black hole behaves like an electrical conductor. On the other\nhand, the vacuum can be considered as an insulator. The second evidence comes\nfrom the fact that the horizon of BTZ black hole can support two chiral\nmassless scalar field with opposite chirality. Those are two key properties of\n2D topological insulator. We also consider the coupling with the\nelectromagnetic field to show that the boundary modes can conduct the\nelectricity. For higher dimensional black hole the first evidence is still\nvalid. So we conjecture that the higher dimensional black hole can also be\nconsidered as higher dimensional topological insulators. This conjecture will\nhave far-reaching influences on our understanding of quantum black hole and the\nnature of gravity.\n", "  The low-energy description of wrapped M5 branes in compactifications of\nM-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold times a circle is given by a conformal field\ntheory studied by Maldacena, Strominger and Witten and known as the MSW CFT.\nTaking the threefold to be T$^6$ or K3xT$^2$, we construct a map between a\nsub-sector of this CFT and a sub-sector of the D1-D5 CFT. We demonstrate this\nmap by considering a set of D1-D5 CFT states that have smooth horizonless bulk\nduals, and explicitly constructing the supergravity solutions dual to the\ncorresponding states of the MSW CFT. We thus obtain the largest known class of\nsolutions dual to MSW CFT microstates, and demonstrate that five-dimensional\nungauged supergravity admits much larger families of smooth horizonless\nsolutions than previously known.\n", "  The multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio is provably the lowest variance\nunbiased estimator of both free energies and ensemble averages, and has a\nnumber of important advantages over previous methods, such as WHAM. Despite its\nadvantages, the original MBAR paper was rather dense and mathematically\ncomplicated, limiting the extent to which people could expand and apply it. We\npresent here a different way to think about MBAR that is much more intuitive\nand makes it clearer why the method works so well.\n", "  We describe the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation package of the Borexino detector\nand discuss the agreement of its output with data. The Borexino MC 'ab initio'\nsimulates the energy loss of particles in all detector components and generates\nthe resulting scintillation photons and their propagation within the liquid\nscintillator volume. The simulation accounts for absorption, reemission, and\nscattering of the optical photons and tracks them until they either are\nabsorbed or reach the photocathode of one of the photomultiplier tubes. Photon\ndetection is followed by a comprehensive simulation of the readout electronics\nresponse. The algorithm proceeds with a detailed simulation of the electronics\nchain. The MC is tuned using data collected with radioactive calibration\nsources deployed inside and around the scintillator volume. The simulation\nreproduces the energy response of the detector, its uniformity within the\nfiducial scintillator volume relevant to neutrino physics, and the time\ndistribution of detected photons to better than 1% between 100 keV and several\nMeV. The techniques developed to simulate the Borexino detector and their level\nof refinement are of possible interest to the neutrino community, especially\nfor current and future large-volume liquid scintillator experiments such as\nKamland-Zen, SNO+, and Juno.\n", "  Most sub-mm emission line studies of galaxies to date have targeted sources\nwith known redshifts where the frequencies of the lines are well constrained.\nRecent blind line scans circumvent the spectroscopic redshift requirement,\nwhich could represent a selection bias.\n  Our aim is to detect emission lines present in continuum oriented\nobservations. The detection of such lines provides spectroscopic redshift and\nyields properties of the galaxies.\n  We perform a search for emission lines in the ALMA observations of five\nFrontier Fields clusters and assess the reliability of our detection by\nassociating line candidates with detected galaxies in deep near-infrared\nimaging.\n  We find 26 significant emission lines candidates, with observed line fluxes\nbetween 0.2-4.6 Jy km s$^{-1}$ and velocity dispersions (FWHM) of 25-600 km\ns$^{-1}$. Nine of these candidates lie nearby to near-infrared sources,\nboosting their reliability; in six cases the observed line frequency and\nstrength are consistent with expectations given the photometric redshift and\nproperties of the galaxy counterparts. We present redshift identifications,\nmagnifications and molecular gas estimates for the galaxies with identified\nlines. We show that two of these candidates likely originate from starburst\ngalaxies, one of which is a jellyfish galaxy, while another two are consistent\nwith being main sequence galaxies based in their depletion times.\n  This work highlights the degree to which serendipitous emission lines can be\ndiscovered in large mosaic continuum observations when deep ancillary data are\navailable. The low number of high-significance line detections, however,\nconfirms that such surveys are not as optimal as blind line scans. We stress\nthat Monte Carlo simulations should be used to assess the line detections\nsignificances, since using the negative noise suffers from stochasticity and\nincurs larger uncertainties.\n", "  Photonic quantum technology relies on efficient sources of coherent single\nphotons, the ideal carriers of quantum information. Heralded single photons\nfrom parametric down-conversion can approximate on-demand single photons to a\ndesired degree, with high spectral purities achieved through group-velocity\nmatching and tailored crystal nonlinearities.\n  Here we propose crystal nonlinearity engineering techniques with\nsub-coherence-length domains. We first introduce a combination of two existing\nmethods: a deterministic approach with coherence-length domains and\nprobabilistic domain-width annealing. We then show how the same deterministic\ndomain-flip approach can be implemented with sub-coherence length domains. Both\nof these complementary techniques create highly pure photons, outperforming\nprevious methods, in particular for short nonlinear crystals matched to\nfemtosecond lasers.\n", "  We report the discovery of a post-mass transfer Gamma Doradus/Delta Scuti\nhybrid pulsator in the eclipsing binary KIC~9592855. This binary has a circular\norbit, an orbital period of 1.2 days, and contains two stars of almost\nidentical masses ($M_1=1.72M_{\\odot}, M_2=1.71M_{\\odot}$). However, the cooler\nsecondary star is more evolved ($R_2=1.96R_{\\odot}$) while the hotter primary\nis still on the zero-age-main-sequence ($R_1=1.53R_{\\odot}$). Coeval models\nfrom single star evolution cannot explain the observed masses and radii, and\nbinary evolution with mass-transfer needs to be invoked. After subtracting the\nbinary light curve, the Fourier spectrum shows low-order pressure-mode\npulsations, and more dominantly, a cluster of low-frequency gravity modes at\nabout $2$ day$^{-1}$. These g-modes are nearly equally-spaced in period, and\nthe period spacing pattern has a negative slope. We identify these g-modes as\nprograde dipole modes and find that they stem from the secondary star. The\nfrequency range of unstable p-modes also agrees with that of the secondary. We\nderive the internal rotation rate of the convective core and the asymptotic\nperiod spacing from the observed g-modes. The resulting values suggest that the\ncore and envelope rotate nearly uniformly, i.e., their rotation rates are both\nsimilar to the orbital frequency of this synchronized binary.\n", "  We investigate the pseudoscalar (PS) meson ($\\pi$ and $K$) quasi-distribution\namplitude (QDA), which is supposed to be an asymptotic analog to the meson\ndistribution amplitude (DA) $\\phi_{\\pi,K}(x)$ in the limit of the large\nlongitudinal PS-meson momentum, i.e. $p_3\\to\\infty$, in the nonperturbative\nregion. For this purpose, we employ the nonlocal chiral-quark model (NLChQM) in\nthe light-front formalism with a minimal Fock-state for the mesons $\\sim\nq\\bar{q}$ at the low-energy scale parameter of the model $\\Lambda\\sim1$ GeV. As\na trial, we extract the transverse-momentum distribution amplitude (TMDA) from\nthe light-front wave function within the model, and convert it to QDA with help\nof the virtuality-distribution amplitude. By doing that, we derive an\nanalytical expression for the nonperturbative QDA with the current-quark mass\ncorrection up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta m_q)$. Numerically, we confirm that the\nobtained TMDA reproduces the experimental data for the photon-pion transition\nform factor $F_{\\gamma\\gamma^*\\pi^0}(Q^2)$ at the low-$Q^2$ qualitatively well.\nWe also observe that the obtained QDA approaches to DA as $p_3$ increases,\nshowing the symmetric and asymmetric curves with respect to $x$ for the pion\nand kaon, respectively, due to the current-quark mass difference $m_{u,d}\\ll\nm_s$. Assigning $\\xi\\equiv2x-1$, the moments $\\langle\\xi^n\\rangle_{\\pi,K}$ are\ncomputed, using the pion and kaon QDAs, and there appear only a few percent\ndeviations in the moments for $p_3\\gtrsim30\\Lambda$ in comparison to the values\ncalculated directly from DAs. It turns out that the higher moments are more\nsensitive to the change of $p_3$, whereas the lower ones depend less on it.\n", "  The nature of the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the \\emph{Fermi} bubbles is\nunknown. Both hadronic and leptonic models have been formulated to explain the\npeculiar $\\gamma$-ray signal observed by the Fermi-LAT between 0.1-500~GeV. If\nthis emission continues above $\\sim$30~TeV, hadronic models of the \\emph{Fermi}\nbubbles would provide a significant contribution to the high-energy neutrino\nflux detected by the IceCube observatory. Even in models where leptonic\n$\\gamma$-rays produce the \\emph{Fermi} bubbles flux at GeV energies, a hadronic\ncomponent may be observable at very high energies. The combination of IceCube\nand HAWC measurements have the ability to distinguish these scenarios through a\ncomparison of the neutrino and $\\gamma$-ray fluxes at a similar energy scale.\nWe examine the most recent four-year dataset produced by the IceCube\ncollaboration and find no evidence for neutrino emission originating from the\n\\emph{Fermi} bubbles. In particular, we find that previously suggested excesses\nare consistent with the diffuse astrophysical background with a p-value of 0.22\n(0.05 in an extreme scenario that all the IceCube events that overlap with the\nbubbles come from them). Moreover, we show that existing and upcoming HAWC\nobservations provide independent constraints on any neutrino emission from the\n\\emph{Fermi} bubbles, due to the close correlation between the $\\gamma$-ray and\nneutrino fluxes in hadronic interactions. The combination of these results\ndisfavors a significant contribution from the \\emph{Fermi} bubbles to the\nIceCube neutrino flux.\n", "  We revisit the constraints on inflation models by using the current\ncosmological observations involving the latest local measurement of the Hubble\nconstant ($H_{0} = 73.00\\pm 1.75$ km s $^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$). We constrain the\nprimordial power spectra of both scalar and tensor perturbations with the\nobservational data including the Planck 2015 CMB full data, the BICEP2 and Keck\nArray CMB B-mode data, the BAO data, and the direct measurement of $H_0$. In\norder to relieve the tension between the local determination of the Hubble\nconstant and the other astrophysical observations, we consider the additional\nparameter $N_{\\rm eff}$ in the cosmological model. We find that, for the\n$\\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$N_{\\rm eff}$ model, the scale invariance is only excluded at\nthe 3.3$\\sigma$ level, and $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}>0$ is favored at the 1.6$\\sigma$\nlevel. Comparing the obtained 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ contours of $(n_s,r)$\nwith the theoretical predictions of selected inflation models, we find that\nboth the convex and concave potentials are favored at 2$\\sigma$ level, the\nnatural inflation model is excluded at more than 2$\\sigma$ level, the\nStarobinsky $R^2$ inflation model is only favored at around 2$\\sigma$ level,\nand the spontaneously broken SUSY inflation model is now the most favored\nmodel.\n", "  We show that, in general, the translational average over a spatial\nvariable---discussed by Backus \\cite{backus}, and referred to as the\nequivalent-medium average---and the rotational average over a symmetry group at\na point---discussed by Gazis et al. \\cite{gazis}, and referred to as the\neffective-medium average---do not commute. However, they do commute in special\ncases of particular symmetry classes, which correspond to special relations\namong the elasticity parameters. We also show that this noncommutativity is a\nfunction of the strength of anisotropy. Surprisingly, a perturbation of the\nelasticity parameters about a point of weak anisotropy results in the\ncommutator of the two types of averaging being of the order of the {\\it\nsquare\\/} of this perturbation. Thus, these averages nearly commute in the case\nof weak anisotropy, which is of interest in such disciplines as quantitative\nseismology, where the weak-anisotropy assumption results in empirically\nadequate models.\n", "  We investigate laser-induced quantum interference phenomena in superradiance\nprocesses and in an ensemble of initially excited $\\Lambda-$type closely packed\nthree-level emitters. The lower doublet levels are pumped with a coherent laser\nfield. Due to constructive quantum interference effects, the superradiance\noccurs on a much weaker atomic transition which is not the case in the absence\nof the coherent driving. This result may be of visible relevance for enhancing\nultraweak transitions in atomic or atomic-like systems, respectively, or for\nhigh-frequency lasing effects.\n", "  The semi-inclusive deep inelastic electron scattering off transversely\npolarized $^3$He, i.e. the process, $e + \\vec{^3 {\\rm He}} \\to e' + h+X$, with\n$h$ a detected fast hadron, is studied beyond the plane wave impulse\napproximation. To this end, a distorted spin-dependent spectral function of a\nnucleon inside an A=3 nucleus is actually evaluated through a generalized\neikonal approximation, in order to take into account the final state\ninteractions between the hadronizing system and the (A-1) nucleon spectator\none. Our realistic description of both nuclear target and final state is a\nsubstantial step forward for achieving a reliable extraction of the Sivers and\nCollins single spin asymmetries of the free neutron. To illustrate how and to\nwhat extent the model dependence due to the treatment of the nuclear effects is\nunder control, we apply our approach to the extraction procedure of the neutron\nsingle spin asymmetries from those measured for $^3$He for values of the\nkinematical variables relevant both for forthcoming experiments at Jefferson\nLab and, with an exploratory purpose, for the future Electron Ion Collider.\n", "  The physical properties of polycrystalline materials depend on their\nmicrostructure, which is the nano-to-centimeter-scale arrangement of phases and\ndefects in their interior. Such microstructure depends on the shape,\ncrystallographic phase and orientation, and interfacing of the grains\nconstituting the material. This article presents a new non-destructive 3D\ntechnique to study bulk samples with sizes in the cm range with a resolution of\nhundred micrometers: time-of-flight three-dimensional neutron diffraction (ToF\n3DND). Compared to existing analogous X-ray diffraction techniques, ToF 3DND\nenables studies of samples that can be both larger in size and made of heavier\nelements. Moreover, ToF 3DND facilitates the use of complicated sample\nenvironments. The basic ToF 3DND setup, utilizing an imaging detector with high\nspatial and temporal resolution, can easily be implemented at a time-of-flight\nneutron beamline. The technique was developed and tested with data collected at\nthe Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility of the Japan Proton\nAccelerator Complex (J-PARC) for an iron sample. We successfully reconstructed\nthe shape of 108 grains and developed an indexing procedure. The reconstruction\nalgorithms have been validated by reconstructing two stacked Co-Ni-Ga single\ncrystals and by comparison with a grain map obtained by post-mortem electron\nbackscatter diffraction (EBSD).\n", "  The investigation of thermal transport properties of novel two dimensional\nmaterials is crucially important in order to assess their potential to be used\nin future technological applications, such as thermoelectric power generation.\nIn this respect, lattice thermal transport properties of monolayer structures\nof the group \\textrm{VA} elements (P, As, Sb, Bi, PAs, PSb, PBi, AsSb, AsBi,\nSbBi, P$_{3}$As$_{1}$, P$_{3}$Sb$_{1}$, P$_{1}$As$_{3}$, As$_{3}$Sb$_{1}$) with\nblack phosphorus like puckered structure were systematically investigated by\nfirst principles calculations and an iterative solution of the Phonon Boltzmann\ntransport equation. Phosphorene was found to have the highest lattice thermal\nconductivity, $\\kappa$, due to its low average atomic mass and strong\ninteratomic bonding character. As a matter of course, anisotropic $\\kappa$ were\nobtained for all the considered materials, owing to anisotropy in phonon group\nvelocities and scattering rates (relaxation times) calculated for these\nstructures. However, the determined linear correlation between the anisotropy\nin $\\kappa$ of P, As, and Sb is significant. The results corresponding to the\nstudied compound structures clearly point out that thermal (electronic)\nconductivity of pristine monolayers might be suppressed (improved) by alloying\nthem with the same group elements. For instance, the room temperature $\\kappa$\nof PBi along armchair direction was predicted as low as 1.5 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$,\nwhereas that of P was predicted to be 21 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$. In spite of the\napparent differences in structural and vibrational properties, we peculiarly\nrevealed an intriguing correlation between the $\\kappa$ of all the considered\nmaterials as $\\kappa$=c$_{1}$ + c$_{2}$/$m^{2}$, in particular along zigzag\ndirection.\n", "  We prove that quantum information encoded in some topological excitations,\nincluding certain Majorana zero modes, is protected in closed systems for a\ntime scale exponentially long in system parameters. This protection holds even\nat infinite temperature. At lower temperatures the decay time becomes even\nlonger, with a temperature dependence controlled by an effective gap that is\nparametrically larger than the actual energy gap of the system. This\nnon-equilibrium dynamical phenomenon is a form of prethermalization, and occurs\nbecause of obstructions to the equilibriation of edge or defect degrees of\nfreedom with the bulk. We analyze the ramifications for ordered and topological\nphases in one, two, and three dimensions, with examples including Majorana and\nparafermionic zero modes in interacting spin chains. Our results are based on a\nnon-perturbative analysis valid in any dimension, and they are illustrated by\nnumerical simulations in one dimension. We discuss the implications for\nexperiments on quantum-dot chains tuned into a regime supporting end Majorana\nzero modes, and on trapped ion chains.\n", "  We study the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations in a two-qutrit\nsystem coupled to independent reservoirs. In particular, we addressed the\ndifferences in the dynamics of Markovian and non-Markovian regimes and show\nthat for specific initial states, classical correlations exhibit abrupt changes\nalong the dynamics. A particular sudden change occurs when the classical\ncorrelations freezes to a certain value at a given time, revealing the\napparition of a pointer-state basis. After this given time, the decoherence\nonly affects quantum correlations. Here we identify two regimes in the\ndecoherence dynamics: a mixed regime when both classical and quantum\ncorrelations decay and a quantum regime when only quantum correlations decay.\nWe show that the freezing of classical correlations can be stable or metastable\ndepending on the system-reservoirs parameters. In the long-time limit, we find\nanalytical expressions for the pointer-state basis the system settles in, and\nconsequently for classical and quantum correlations.\n", "  We consider the canonical ensemble of multilayered constrained Erdos-Renyi\nnetworks (CERN) and regular random graphs (RRG), where each layer represents\ngraph vertices painted in a specific color. We study the critical behavior in\nsuch networks under changing the fugacity, $\\mu$, which controls the number of\nmonochromatic triads of nodes. The behavior of considered systems is\ninvestigated via the spectral properties of the adjacency and Laplacian\nmatrices of corresponding networks. For some wide region of $\\mu$ we find the\nformation of a finite plateau in the number of the intercolor links, which\nexactly matches the finite plateau for the algebraic connectivity of the\nnetwork (the value of the first non-vanishing eigenvalue of the Laplacian\nmatrix, $\\lambda_2$). We claim that at the plateau the restoring of the\nspontaneously broken $Z_2$ symmetry by the mechanism of modes collectivization\nin clusters of different colors occurs. The phenomena of a finite plateau\nformation holds for the polychromatic (multilayer) networks with $M>2$ colors.\n", "  Jordan operator algebras are norm-closed spaces of operators on a Hilbert\nspace which are closed under the Jordan product. The discovery of the present\npaper is that there exists a huge and tractable theory of possibly\nnonselfadjoint Jordan operator algebras; they are far more similar to\nassociative operator algebras than was suspected. We initiate the theory of\nsuch algebras.\n", "  The evolution of electromagnetic and thermodynamic fields in a non-ideal\nfluid are studied in the framework of ultrarelativistic transverse\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which is essentially characterized by electric and\nmagnetic fields being transverse to the fluid velocity. Extending the method of\nself-similar solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics to the case of\nnon-conserved charges, the differential equations of non-ideal transverse MHD\nare solved, and two novel sets of self-similar solutions are derived. The first\nset turns out to be a boost-invariant and exact solution, which is\ncharacterized by non-rotating electric and magnetic fields. The second set is a\nnon-boost-invariant solution, which is characterized by rotating electric and\nmagnetic fields. The rotation occurs with increasing rapidity $\\eta$, as the\nangular velocity is defined by\n$\\omega_{0}\\equiv\\frac{\\partial\\zeta}{\\partial\\eta}=\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\eta}$,\nwith $\\zeta$ and $\\phi$ being the angles of electric and magnetic vectors with\nrespect to a certain axis in the local rest frame of the fluid. For both sets\nof solutions, the electric and magnetic fields are either parallel or\nanti-parallel to each other. Performing a complete numerical analysis, the\neffects of finite electric conductivity as well as electric and magnetic\nsusceptibilities of the medium on the evolution of rotating and non-rotating\nMHD solutions are explored, and the interplay between the angular velocity\n$\\omega_{0}$ and these quantities is scrutinized. The lifetime of\nelectromagnetic fields and the evolution of the temperature of the\nelectromagnetized fluid are shown to be affected by $\\omega_{0}$.\n", "  We perform dark-matter-only simulations of 28 relaxed massive cluster-sized\nhaloes for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM)\nmodels, to study structural differences between the models at large radii,\nwhere the impact of baryonic physics is expected to be very limited. We find\nthat the distributions for the radial profiles of the density, ellipsoidal axis\nratios, and velocity anisotropies ($\\beta$) of the haloes differ considerably\nbetween the models (at the $\\sim1\\sigma$ level), even at $\\gtrsim10\\%$ of the\nvirial radius, if the self-scattering cross section is $\\sigma/m_\\chi=1$ cm$^2$\ngr$^{-1}$. Direct comparison with observationally inferred density profiles\ndisfavours SIDM for $\\sigma/m_\\chi=1$ cm$^2$ gr$^{-1}$, but in an intermediate\nradial range ($\\sim3\\%$ of the virial radius), where the impact of baryonic\nphysics is uncertain. At this level of the cross section, we find a narrower\n$\\beta$ distribution in SIDM, clearly skewed towards isotropic orbits, with no\nSIDM (90\\% of CDM) haloes having $\\beta>0.12$ at $7\\%$ of the virial radius. We\nestimate that with an observational sample of $\\sim30$ ($\\sim10^{15}$\nM$_\\odot$) relaxed clusters, $\\beta$ can potentially be used to put competitive\nconstraints on SIDM, once observational uncertainties improve by a factor of a\nfew. We study the suppression of the memory of halo assembly history in SIDM\nclusters. For $\\sigma/m_\\chi=1$ cm$^2$ gr$^{-1}$, we find that this happens\nonly in the central halo regions ($\\sim1/4$ of the scale radius of the halo),\nand only for haloes that assembled their mass within this region earlier than a\nformation redshift $z_f\\sim2$. Otherwise, the memory of assembly remains and is\nreflected in ways similar to CDM, albeit with weaker trends.\n", "  We study electric transport along an integer quantum Hall edge where the\nproximity effect is induced due to a coupling to a superconductor. Such an edge\nexhibits two Majorana-Weyl fermions with different group velocities set by the\ninduced superconducting pairing. We show that this structure of the spectrum\nresults in interference fringes that can be observed in both the two-terminal\nconductance and shot noise. We develop a complete analytical theory of such\nfringes for an arbitrary smooth profile of the induced pairing.\n", "  Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising absorbers and emitters\nto enable novel photonic and optoelectronic applications but are also known to\nseverely suffer from low optical quantum yields. Here we demonstrate SWCNTs\nexcitons coupled to plasmonic nanocavities reaching deeply into the Purcell\nregime with FP=234 (average FP=76), near unity quantum yields of 70% (average\n41%), and a photon emission rate of 1.7 MHz into the first lens. The measured\nultra-narrow exciton linewidth (18 micro eV) implies furthermore generation of\nindistinguishable single photons from a SWCNT. To demonstrate utility beyond\nquantum light sources we show that nanocavity-coupled SWCNTs perform as\nsingle-molecule thermometers detecting plasmonically induced heat (Delta\nT=150K) in a unique interplay of excitons, phonons, and plasmons at the\nnanoscale.\n", "  Delensing, the removal of the limiting lensing B-mode background, is crucial\nfor the success of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys in\nconstraining inflationary gravitational waves (IGWs). In recent work, delensing\nwith large-scale structure tracers has emerged as a promising method both for\nimproving constraints on IGWs and for testing delensing methods for future use.\nHowever, the delensing fractions (i.e., the fraction of the lensing-B mode\npower removed) achieved by recent efforts have been only $20-30\\%$. In this\nwork, we provide a detailed characterization of a full-sky, dust-cleaned cosmic\ninfrared background (CIB) map for delensing and construct a further-improved\ndelensing template by adding additional tracers to increase delensing\nperformance. In particular, we build a multitracer delensing template by\ncombining the dust-cleaned Planck CIB map with a reconstructed CMB lensing map\nfrom Planck and a galaxy number density map from the Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE) satellite. For this combination, we calculate the relevant\nweightings by fitting smooth templates to measurements of all the cross- and\nauto-spectra of these maps. On a large fraction of the sky\n($f_\\mathrm{sky}=0.43$), we demonstrate that our maps are capable of providing\na delensing factor of $43 \\pm 1\\%$; using a more restrictive mask\n($f_\\mathrm{sky}=0.11$), the delensing factor reaches $48 \\pm 1\\%$. For\nlow-noise surveys, our delensing maps, which cover much of the sky, can thus\nimprove constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) by nearly a factor of\n2. The delensing tracer maps are made publicly available, and we encourage\ntheir use in ongoing and upcoming B-mode surveys.\n", "  We have examined 40 NuSTAR light curves (LCs) of five TeV emitting high\nsynchrotron peaked blazars: 1ES 0229+200, Mrk 421, Mrk 501, 1ES 1959+650 and\nPKS 2155-304. Four of the blazars showed intraday variability in the NuSTAR\nenergy range of 3-79 keV. Using an auto correlation function analysis we\nsearched for intraday variability timescales in these LCs and found indications\nof several between 2.5 and 32.8 ks in eight LCs of Mrk 421, a timescale around\n8.0 ks for one LC of Mrk 501, and timescales of 29.6 ks and 57.4 ks in two LCs\nof PKS 2155-304. The other two blazars' LCs do not show any evidence for\nintraday variability timescales shorter than the lengths of those observations,\nhowever, the data was both sparser and noisier, for them. We found positive\ncorrelations with zero lag between soft (3-10 keV) and hard (10-79 keV) bands\nfor most of the LCs, indicating that their emissions originate from the same\nelectron population. We examined spectral variability using a hardness ratio\nanalysis and noticed a general \"harder-when-brighter\" behavior. The 22 LCs of\nMrk 421 observed between July 2012 and April 2013 show that this source was in\na quiescent state for an extended period of time and then underwent an\nunprecedented double peaked outburst while monitored on a daily basis during 10\n- 16 April 2013. We briefly discuss models capable of explaining these blazar\nemissions.\n", "  Bipartite entanglement entropy of a segment with the length $l$ in $1+1$\ndimensional conformal field theories (CFT) follows the formula\n$S=\\frac{c}{3}\\ln l+\\gamma$, where $c$ is the central charge of the CFT and\n$\\gamma$ is a cut-off dependent constant which diverges in the absence of an\nultraviolet cutoff. According to this formula, systems with larger central\ncharges have {\\it{more}} bipartite entanglement entropy. Using quantum Fisher\ninformation (QFI), we argue that systems with bigger central charges not only\nhave larger bipartite entanglement entropy but also have more multipartite\nentanglement content. In particular, we argue that since systems with smaller\n{\\it{smallest scaling dimension}} have bigger QFI, the multipartite\nentanglement content of a CFT is dependent on the value of the smallest scaling\ndimension present in the spectrum of the system. We show that our argument\nseems to be consistent with some of the existing results regarding the von\nNeumann entropy, negativity, and localizable entanglement in $1+1$ dimensions.\nFurthermore, we also argue that the QFI decays under renormalization group (RG)\nflow between two unitary CFTs. Finally, we also comment on the non-conformal\nbut scale invariant systems.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the low-temperature phase of the recently\nsynthesized Lu$_2$Mo$_2$O$_5$N$_2$ material, an extraordinarily rare\nrealization of a $S=1/2$ three-dimensional pyrochlore Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet in which Mo$^{5+}$ are the $S=1/2$ magnetic species. Despite a\nCurie-Weiss temperature ($\\Theta_{\\rm CW}$) of $-121(1)$ K, experiments have\nfound no signature of magnetic ordering $or$ spin freezing down to\n$T^*\\approx0.5$ K. Using density functional theory, we find that the compound\nis well described by a Heisenberg model with exchange parameters up to third\nnearest neighbors. The analysis of this model via the pseudofermion functional\nrenormalization group method reveals paramagnetic behavior down to a\ntemperature of at least $T=|\\Theta_{\\rm CW}|/100$, in agreement with the\nexperimental findings hinting at a possible three-dimensional quantum spin\nliquid. The spin susceptibility profile in reciprocal space shows\nmomentum-dependent features forming a \"gearwheel\" pattern, characterizing what\nmay be viewed as a molten version of a chiral noncoplanar incommensurate spiral\norder under the action of quantum fluctuations. Our calculated reciprocal space\nsusceptibility maps provide benchmarks for future neutron scattering\nexperiments on single crystals of Lu$_2$Mo$_2$O$_5$N$_2$.\n", "  The mass and the lifetime of a gluon are evaluated from first principles at\nfinite temperature across the deconfinement transition of pure SU(3) Yang-Mills\ntheory, by a direct calculation of the pole of the propagator in the complex\nplane, using the finite temperature extension of a massive expansion in the\nLandau gauge. Even at T=0 the quasigluon lifetime is finite and the gluon is\ncanceled from the asymptotic states, yielding a microscopic proof of\nconfinement from first principles. Above the transition the damping rate is a\nlinear increasing function of temperature as predicted by standard perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of fermionic polar molecules in a bilayer system,\nwith an imbalance of molecular densities of the layers. For the imbalance\nexceeding a critical value the system undergoes a transition from the uniform\ninterlayer superfluid to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state with\na stripe structure, and at sufficiently large imbalance a transition from the\nFFLO to normal phase. Compared to the case of contact interactions, the FFLO\nregime is enhanced by the long-range character of the interlayer dipolar\ninteraction, which can combine the s-wave and p-wave pairing in the order\nparameter.\n", "  We investigate the superconducting ternary lithium borohydride phase diagram\nat pressures of 0 and 200$\\,$GPa using methods for evolutionary crystal\nstructure prediction and linear-response calculations for the electron-phonon\ncoupling. Our calculations show that the ground state phase at ambient\npressure, LiBH$_4$, stays in the $Pnma$ space group and remains a wide band-gap\ninsulator at all pressures investigated. Other phases along the 1:1:$x$ Li:B:H\nline are also insulating. However, a full search of the ternary phase diagram\nat 200$\\,$GPa revealed a metallic Li$_2$BH$_6$ phase, which is\nthermodynamically stable down to 100$\\,$GPa. This {\\em superhydride} phase,\ncrystallizing in a $Fm\\bar{3}m$ space group, is characterized by six-fold\nhydrogen-coordinated boron atoms occupying the $fcc$ sites of the unit cell.\nDue to strong hydrogen-boron bonding this phase displays a critical temperature\nof $\\sim$ 100$\\,$K between 100 and 200$\\,$GPa. Our investigations confirm that\nternary compounds used in hydrogen-storage applications are a suitable choice\nfor observing high-$T_\\text{c}$ conventional superconductivity in diamond anvil\ncell experiments, and suggest a viable route to optimize the critical\ntemperature of high-pressure hydrides.\n", "  Magnetic monopoles, if they exist, would be produced amply in strong magnetic\nfields and high temperatures via the thermal Schwinger process. Such\ncircumstances arise in heavy ion collisions and in neutron stars, both of which\nimply lower bounds on the mass of possible magnetic monopoles. In showing this,\nwe construct the cross section for pair production of magnetic monopoles in\nheavy ion collisions, which indicates that they are particularly promising for\nexperimental searches such as MoEDAL.\n", "  We present polarisation spectra of seven stars in the lines-of-sight towards\nthe Sco OB1 association. Our spectra were obtained within the framework of the\nLarge Interstellar Polarization Survey carried out with the FORS instrument of\nthe ESO VLT. We have modelled the wavelength-dependence of extinction and\nlinear polarisation with a dust model for the diffuse interstellar medium which\nconsists of a mixture of particles with size ranging from the molecular domain\nof 0.5 nm up to 350 nm. We have included stochastically heated small dust\ngrains with radii between 0.5 and 6 nm made of graphite and silicate, as well\nas polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs), and we have assumed that\nlarger particles are prolate spheroids made of amorphous carbon and silicate.\nOverall, a dust model with eight free parameters best reproduces the\nobservations. Reducing the number of free parameters leads to results that are\ninconsistent with cosmic abundance constraints. We found that aligned silicates\nare the dominant contributor to the observed polarisation, and that the\npolarisation spectra are best-fit by a lower limit of the equivolume sphere\nradius of aligned grains of 70 - 200nm.\n", "  Coherent many-body quantum dynamics lies at the heart of quantum simulation\nand quantum computation. Both require coherent evolution in the exponentially\nlarge Hilbert space of an interacting many-body system. To date, trapped ions\nhave defined the state of the art in terms of achievable coherence times in\ninteracting spin chains. Here, we establish an alternative platform by\nreporting on the observation of coherent, fully interaction-driven quantum\nrevivals of the magnetization in Rydberg-dressed Ising spin chains of atoms\ntrapped in an optical lattice. We identify partial many-body revivals at up to\nabout ten times the characteristic time scale set by the interactions. At the\nsame time, single-site-resolved correlation measurements link the magnetization\ndynamics with inter-spin correlations appearing at different distances during\nthe evolution. These results mark an enabling step towards the implementation\nof Rydberg atom based quantum annealers, quantum simulations of higher\ndimensional complex magnetic Hamiltonians, and itinerant long-range interacting\nquantum matter.\n", "  Quantum complexity of a thermofield double state in a strongly coupled\nquantum field theory has been argued to be holographically related to the\naction evaluated on the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. The growth rate of quantum\ncomplexity in systems dual to Einstein-Hilbert gravity saturates a bound which\nfollows from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We consider corrections to\nthe growth rate in models with flavor degrees of freedom. They are realized by\nadding a small number of flavor branes to the system. Holographically, such\ncorrections come from the DBI action of the flavor branes evaluated on the\nWheeler-DeWitt patch. We relate corrections to the growth of quantum complexity\nto corrections to the mass of the system, and observe that the bound on the\ngrowth rate is never violated.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics and the chemical potential for a five-dimensional\ncharged AdS black hole by treating the cosmological constant as the number of\ncolors $N$ in the boundary gauge theory and its conjugate quantity as the\nassociated chemical potential $\\mu$. It is found that there exists a\nsmall-large black hole phase transition. The critical phenomena are\ninvestigated in the $N^{2}$-$\\mu$ chart. In particular, in the reduced\nparameter space, all the thermodynamic quantities can be rescaled with the\nblack hole charge such that these reduced quantities are charge-independent.\nThen we obtain the coexistence curve and the phase diagram. The latent heat is\nalso numerically calculated. Moreover, the heat capacity and the thermodynamic\nscalar are studied. The result indicates that the information of the\nfirst-order black hole phase transition is encoded in the heat capacity and\nscalar. However, the phase transition point cannot be directly calculated with\nthem. Nevertheless, the critical point linked to a second-order phase\ntransition can be determined by either the heat capacity or the scalar. In\naddition, we calculate the critical exponents of the heat capacity and the\nscalar for the saturated small and large black holes near the critical point.\n", "  Holonomic quantum computation is a quantum computation strategy that promises\nsome built-in noise-resilience features. Here, we propose a scheme for\nnonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with nitrogen-vacancy center\nelectron spins, which are characterized by fast quantum gates and long qubit\ncoherence times. By varying the detuning, amplitudes, and phase difference of\nlasers applied to a nitrogen-vacancy center, one can directly realize an\narbitrary single-qubit holonomic gate on the spin. Meanwhile, with the help of\ncavity-assisted interactions, a nontrivial two-qubit holonomic quantum gate can\nalso be induced. The distinct merit of this scheme is that all the quantum\ngates are obtained via an all-optical geometric manipulation of the solid-state\nspins. Therefore, our scheme opens the possibility for robust quantum\ncomputation using solid-state spins in an all-optical way.\n", "  Photonic platforms represent a promising technology for the realization of\nseveral quantum communication protocols and for experiments of quantum\nsimulation. Moreover, large-scale integrated interferometers have recently\ngained a relevant role for restricted models of quantum computing, specifically\nwith Boson Sampling devices. Indeed, various linear optical schemes have been\nproposed for the implementation of unitary transformations, each one suitable\nfor a specific task. Notwithstanding, so far a comprehensive analysis of the\nstate of the art under broader and realistic conditions is still lacking. In\nthe present work we address this gap, providing in a unified framework a\nquantitative comparison of the three main photonic architectures, namely the\nones with triangular and square designs and the so-called fast transformations.\nAll layouts have been analyzed in presence of losses and imperfect control over\nthe reflectivities and phases of the inner structure. Our results represent a\nfurther step ahead towards the implementation of quantum information protocols\non large-scale integrated photonic devices.\n", "  We study the classification of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases\nwith crystalline symmetry (cSPT phases). Focusing on bosonic cSPT phases in two\nand three dimensions, we introduce a simple family of cSPT states, where the\nsystem is comprised of decoupled lower-dimensional building blocks that are\nthemselves SPT states. We introduce a procedure to classify these block states,\nwhich surprisingly reproduces a classification of cSPT phases recently obtained\nby Thorngren and Else using very different methods, for all wallpaper and space\ngroups. The explicit constructions underlying our results clarify the physical\nproperties of the phases classified by Thorngren and Else, and expose\nadditional structure in the classification. Moreover, the states we classify\ncan be completely characterized by point group SPT (pgSPT) invariants and\nrelated weak pgSPT invariants that we introduce. In many cases, the weak\ninvariants can be visualized in terms of translation-symmetric stacking of\nlower-dimensional pgSPT states. We apply our classification to propose a\nLieb-Shultz-Mattis type constraint for two-dimensional spin systems with only\ncrystalline symmetry, and establish this constraint by a dimensional reduction\nargument. Finally, the surprising matching with the Thorngren-Else\nclassification leads us to conjecture that all SPT phases protected only by\ncrystalline symmetry can be built from lower-dimensional blocks of invertible\ntopological states. We argue that this conjecture holds if we make a certain\nphysically reasonable but unproven assumption.\n", "  We analyse Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of a set of galaxy clusters\nselected by the South Pole Telescope using a new publicly-available\nforward-modelling projection code, MBProj2, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium.\nBy fitting a powerlaw plus constant entropy model we find no evidence for a\ncentral entropy floor in the lowest-entropy systems. A model of the underlying\ncentral entropy distribution shows a narrow peak close to zero entropy which\naccounts for 60 per cent of the systems, and a second broader peak around 130\nkeV cm^2. We look for evolution over the 0.28 to 1.2 redshift range of the\nsample in density, pressure, entropy and cooling time at 0.015 R_500 and at 10\nkpc radius. By modelling the evolution of the central quantities with a simple\nmodel, we find no evidence for a non-zero slope with redshift. In addition, a\nnon-parametric sliding median shows no significant change. The fraction of\ncool-core clusters with central cooling times below 2 Gyr is consistent above\nand below z=0.6 (~30-40 per cent). Both by comparing the median thermodynamic\nprofiles, centrally biased towards cool cores, in two redshift bins, and by\nmodelling the evolution of the unbiased average profile as a function of\nredshift, we find no significant evolution beyond self-similar scaling in any\nof our examined quantities. Our average modelled radial density, entropy and\ncooling-time profiles appear as powerlaws with breaks around 0.2 R_500. The\ndispersion in these quantities rises inwards of this radius to around 0.4 dex,\nalthough some of this scatter can be fit by a bimodal model.\n", "  We consider the geometric Titius-Bode rule for the semimajor axes of\nplanetary orbits. We derive an equivalent rule for the midpoints of the\nsegments between consecutive orbits along the radial direction and we interpret\nit physically in terms of the work done in the gravitational field of the Sun\nby particles whose orbits are perturbed around each planetary orbit. On such\nenergetic grounds, it is not surprising that some exoplanets in multiple-planet\nextrasolar systems obey the same relation. But it is surprising that this\nsimple interpretation of the Titius-Bode rule also reveals new properties of\nthe bound closed orbits predicted by Bertrand's theorem and known since 1873.\n", "  The Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey mission\n(ARIEL) is one of the three present candidates for the ESA M4 (the fourth\nmedium mission) launch opportunity. The proposed Payload will perform a large\nunbiased spectroscopic survey from space concerning the nature of exoplanets\natmospheres and their interiors to determine the key factors affecting the\nformation and evolution of planetary systems. ARIEL will observe a large number\n(>500) of warm and hot transiting gas giants, Neptunes and super-Earths around\na wide range of host star types, targeting planets hotter than 600 K to take\nadvantage of their well-mixed atmospheres. It will exploit primary and\nsecondary transits spectroscopy in the 1.2-8 um spectral range and broad-band\nphotometry in the optical and Near IR (NIR). The main instrument of the ARIEL\nPayload is the IR Spectrometer (AIRS) providing low-resolution spectroscopy in\ntwo IR channels: Channel 0 (CH0) for the 1.95-3.90 um band and Channel 1 (CH1)\nfor the 3.90-7.80 um range. It is located at the intermediate focal plane of\nthe telescope and common optical system and it hosts two IR sensors and two\ncold front-end electronics (CFEE) for detectors readout, a well defined process\ncalibrated for the selected target brightness and driven by the Payload's\nInstrument Control Unit (ICU).\n", "  Despite the fact that the first-order beam dynamics models allow an\napproximated evaluation of the beam properties, their contribution is essential\nduring the conceptual design of an accelerator or beamline. However, during the\ncommissioning some of their limitations appear in the comparison against\nmeasurements. The extension of the linear model to higher order effects is,\ntherefore, demanded. In this paper, the effects of particle-matter interaction\nhave been included in the model of the transport lines in the proton therapy\nfacility at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Switzerland. To improve the\nperformance of the facility, a more precise model was required and has been\ndeveloped with the multi-particle open source beam dynamics code called OPAL\n(Object oriented Particle Accelerator Library). In OPAL, the Monte Carlo\nsimulations of Coulomb scattering and energy loss are performed seamless with\nthe particle tracking. Beside the linear optics, the influence of the passive\nelements (e.g. degrader, collimators, scattering foils and air gaps) on the\nbeam emittance and energy spread can be analysed in the new model. This allows\nfor a significantly improved precision in the prediction of beam transmission\nand beam properties. The accuracy of the OPAL model has been confirmed by\nnumerous measurements.\n", "  We theoretically analyse the ground-state cooling of optically levitated\nnanosphere in unresolved- sideband regime by introducing a coupled\nhigh-quality-factor cavity. On account of the quantum interference stemming\nfrom the presence of the coupled cavity, the spectral density of the optical\nforce exerting on the nanosphere gets changed and then the symmetry between the\nheating and the cooling processes is broken. Through adjusting the detuning of\nstrong-dissipative cavity mode, one obtains an enhanced net cooling rate for\nthe nanosphere. It is illustrated that the ground state cooling can be realized\nin the unresolved sideband regime even if the effective optomechanical coupling\nis weaker than the frequency of the nanosphere, which can be understood by the\npicture that the effective interplay of the nanosphere and the auxiliary cavity\nmode brings the system back to an effective resolved regime. Besides, the\ncoupled cavity refines the dynamical stability of the system.\n", "  We calculate the pure dephasing time of three-electron exchange-only qubits\ndue to interaction with the nuclear hyperfine field. Within the $S=S_z=1/2$\nspin subspace, we derive formulas for the dephasing time in the $(1,1,1)$\ncharge region and in the neighboring charge sectors coupled by tunneling. The\nnuclear field and the tunneling are taken into account in a second order\napproximation. The analytical solutions accurately reproduce the numerical\nevaluation of the full problem, and in comparison with existing experimental\ndata, we find that the dephasing times are longer but on the same timescale as\nfor single spins. Our analysis also applies to the resonant exchange (RX),\nalways-on exchange-only (AEON) and hybrid qubits.\n", "  Cooling mechanical resonators is of great importance for both fundamental\nstudy and applied science. We investigate the hybrid optomechanical cooling\nwith a three-level atomic ensemble fixed in a strong excited optical cavity. By\nusing the quantum noise approach, we find the upper bound of the noise spectrum\nand further present three optimal parameter conditions, which can yield a small\nheating coefficient, a large cooling coefficient, and thus a small final phonon\nnumber. Moreover, through the covariance matrix approach, results of numerical\nsimulation are obtained, which are consistent with the theoretical\nexpectations. It is demonstrated that our scheme can achieve ground state\ncooling in the highly unresolved sideband regime, within the current\nexperimental technologies. Compared with the previous cooling methods, in our\nscheme, there are fewer constraints on the drive strength of atomic ensemble\nand number of atoms in the ensemble. In addition, the tolerable ranges of\nparameters for ground state cooling are extended. As a result, our scheme is\nvery suitable for experiments and can be a guideline for the research of hybrid\noptomechanical cooling.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate that the in-plane magnetization induced quantum\nanomalous Hall effect (QAHE) can be realized in atomic crystal layers of\ngroup-V elements with buckled honeycomb lattice. We first construct a general\ntight-binding Hamiltonian with $sp^3$ orbitals via Slater-Koster two-center\napproximation, and then numerically show that for weak and strong spin-orbit\ncouplings the systems harbor QAHEs with Chern numbers of $\\mathcal{C}=\\pm1$ and\n$\\pm2$ , respectively. For the $\\mathcal{C}=\\pm1$ phases, we find the critical\nphase-transition magnetization from a trivial insulator to QAHE can become\nextremely small by tuning the spin-orbit coupling strength. Although the\nresulting band gap is small, it can be remarkably enhanced by orders via\ntilting the magnetization slightly away from the in-plane orientation. For the\n$\\mathcal{C}=\\pm2$ phases, we find that the band gap is large enough for the\nroom-temperature observation. Although the critical magnetization is relatively\nlarge, it can be effectively decreased by applying a strain. All these suggest\nthat it is experimentally feasible to realize high-temperature QAHE from\nin-plane magnetization in atomic crystal layers of group-V elements.\n", "  Recent progress in nanoscale optical physics is associated with the\ndevelopment of a new branch of nanophotonics exploring strong Mie resonances in\ndielectric nanoparticles with high refractive index. The high-index resonant\ndielectric nanostructures form building blocks for novel photonic metadevices\nwith low losses and advanced functionalities. However, unlike extensively\nstudied cavities in photonic crystals, such dielectric resonators demonstrate\nlow quality factors (Q-factors). Here, we uncover a novel mechanism for\nachieving giant Q-factors of subwavelength nanoscale resonators by realizing\nthe regime of bound states in the continuum. We reveal strong mode coupling and\nFano resonances in high-index dielectric finite-length nanorods resulting in\nhigh-Q factors at the nanoscale. Thus, high-index dielectric resonators\nrepresent the simplest example of nanophotonic supercavities, expanding\nsubstantially the range of applications of all-dielectric resonant\nnanophotonics and meta-optics.\n", "  We study universality of geometric gauge sectors in the string landscape in\nthe context of F-theory compactifications. A finite time construction algorithm\nis presented for $\\frac43 \\times 2.96 \\times 10^{755}$ F-theory geometries that\nare connected by a network of topological transitions in a connected moduli\nspace. High probability geometric assumptions uncover universal structures in\nthe ensemble without explicitly constructing it. For example, non-Higgsable\nclusters of seven-branes with intricate gauge sectors occur with probability\nabove $1-1.01\\times 10^{-755}$, and the geometric gauge group rank is above\n$160$ with probability $.999995$. In the latter case there are at least $10$\n$E_8$ factors, the structure of which fixes the gauge groups on certain nearby\nseven-branes. Visible sectors may arise from $E_6$ or $SU(3)$ seven-branes,\nwhich occur in certain random samples with probability $\\simeq 1/200$.\n", "  We present the extension of the effective field theory framework to the\nmildly non-linear scales. The effective field theory approach has been\nsuccessfully applied to the late time cosmic acceleration phenomenon and it has\nbeen shown to be a powerful method to obtain predictions about cosmological\nobservables on linear scales. However, mildly non-linear scales need to be\nconsistently considered when testing gravity theories because a large part of\nthe data comes from those scales. Thus, non-linear corrections to predictions\non observables coming from the linear analysis can help in discriminating among\ndifferent gravity theories. We proceed firstly by identifying the necessary\noperators which need to be included in the effective field theory Lagrangian in\norder to go beyond the linear order in perturbations and then we construct the\ncorresponding non-linear action. Moreover, we present the complete recipe to\nmap any single field dark energy and modified gravity models into the\nnon-linear effective field theory framework by considering a general action in\nthe Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism. In order to illustrate this recipe we\nproceed to map the beyond-Horndeski theory and low-energy Horava gravity into\nthe effective field theory formalism. As a final step we derived the 4th order\naction in term of the curvature perturbation. This allowed us to identify the\nnon-linear contributions coming from the linear order perturbations which at\nthe next order act like source terms. Moreover, we confirm that the stability\nrequirements, ensuring the positivity of the kinetic term and the speed of\npropagation for scalar mode, are automatically satisfied once the viability of\nthe theory is demanded at linear level. The approach we present here will allow\nto construct, in a model independent way, all the relevant predictions on\nobservables at mildly non-linear scales.\n", "  As spiral waves driven by a planet in a gaseous disk steepen into a shock,\nthey deposit angular momentum, opening a gap in the disk. This has been well\nstudied using both linear theory and numerical simulations, but so far, only\nfor the primary spiral arm -- the one directly attached to the planet. Using\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the secondary and\ntertiary arms driven by a planet can also open gaps as they steepen into\nshocks. The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with\ntime in a low viscosity disk ($\\alpha = 5\\times10^{-5}$), so even low-mass\nplanets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open\nmultiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed. Applying\nour results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet\nembedded in the ring at 68.8~au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the\npositions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly\nreproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm\ncontinuum. The positions of secondary/tertiary gaps are found to be sensitive\nto the planetary mass and the disk temperature profile, so with accurate\nobservational measurements of the temperature structure the positions of\nmultiple gaps can be used to constrain the mass of the planet. We also comment\non the gaps seen in the TW Hya and HD~163296 disk.\n", "  We use BOSS DR9 quasars to constrain 2 cases of dark matter models:\ncold-plus-warm (C+WDM) where the warm component is a thermal relic, and sterile\nneutrinos resonantly produced in the presence of a lepton asymmetry (RPSN). We\nestablish constraints on the relic mass m_x and its relative abundance\n$F=\\Omega_{wdm}/\\Omega_{dm}$ using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in 28\nC+WDM configurations. We find that the 3 sigma bounds approximately follow F ~\n$0.35 (keV/m_x)^{-1.37}$ from BOSS alone. We also establish constraints on\nsterile neutrino mass and mixing angle by producing the non-linear flux power\nspectrum of 8 RPSN models, where the input linear power spectrum is computed\ndirectly from the particles distribution functions. We find values of lepton\nasymmetries for which sterile neutrinos as light as 6.5 keV (resp. 3.5 keV) are\nconsistent with BOSS at the 2 sigma (resp. 3sigma) level. These limits tighten\nby close to a factor of 2 for lepton asymmetries departing from those yielding\nthe coolest distribution functions.\n  Our Ly-a forest bounds can be strengthened if we include higher-resolution\ndata from XQ-100, HIRES and MIKE. At these smaller scales, the flux power\nspectrum exhibits a suppression that can be due to Doppler broadening, IGM\npressure smoothing or free-streaming of WDM particles. In the current work, we\nshow that if one extrapolates temperatures from lower redshifts via broken\npower laws in T_0 and gamma, then our 3 sigma C+WDM bounds strengthen to F~\n$0.20 (keV/m_x)^{-1.37}$, and the lightest RPSN consistent with our extended\ndata set have masses of 7.0 keV at the 3 sigma level. Using dedicated\nhydrodynamical simulations, we show that a 7 keV sterile neutrino produced in a\nlepton asymmetry $L = 8 \\times 10^{-6}$ is consistent at 1.9 sigma (resp. 3.1\nsigma) with BOSS (resp. BOSS + higher-resolution), for the thermal history\nmodels tested in this work.\n", "  A correlation between the change in magnetic susceptibility\n({\\Delta}\\c{hi}exp) upon crystallization of Cu-Zr, Hf metallic glasses (MG)\nwith their glass forming ability (GFA) observed recently is found to apply to\nCu-Ti and Zr-Ni alloys, too. In particular, a small {\\Delta}\\c{hi}exp , which\nreflects similar electronic structures, ES, of glassy and corresponding\ncrystalline alloys, corresponds to high GFA. Here, we studied {\\Delta}\\c{hi}exp\nin five Cu-Ti and four Cu-Zr and Ni-Zr MGs. The fully crystalline final state\nof all alloys was verified from X-ray diffraction patterns. The variation of\nGFA with composition in Cu-Ti, Cu-Zr and Cu-Hf MGs was established from the\nvariation of the corresponding critical casting thickness, dc. Due to the\nabsence of data for dc in Ni-Zr MGs their GFA was described by using empirical\ncriteria, such as the reduced glass transition temperature. A very good\ncorrelation between {\\Delta}\\c{hi}exp and dc (and/or other criteria for GFA)\nwas observed for all alloys studied. The correlation between the ES and GFA\nshowed up best for Cu-Zr and NiZr2 alloys where direct data for the change in\nES ({\\Delta}ES) upon crystallization are available. The applicability of the\n{\\Delta}\\c{hi}exp ({\\Delta}ES) criterion for high GFA (which provides a simple\nway to select the compositions with high GFA) to other metal-metal MGs\n(including ternary and multicomponent bulk MGs) is briefly discussed.\n", "  In this work we investigate the equilibrium configurations of white dwarfs in\na modified gravity theory, na\\-mely, $f(R,T)$ gravity, for which $R$ and $T$\nstand for the Ricci scalar and trace of the energy-momentum tensor,\nrespectively. Considering the functional form $f(R,T)=R+2\\lambda T$, with\n$\\lambda$ being a constant, we obtain the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for\nthe theory. Some physical properties of white dwarfs, such as: mass, radius,\npressure and energy density, as well as their dependence on the parameter\n$\\lambda$ are derived. More massive and larger white dwarfs are found for\nnegative values of $\\lambda$ when it decreases. The equilibrium configurations\npredict a maximum mass limit for white dwarfs slightly above the Chandrasekhar\nlimit, with larger radii and lower central densities when compared to standard\ngravity outcomes. The most important effect of $f(R,T)$ theory for massive\nwhite dwarfs is the increase of the radius in comparison with GR and also\n$f(R)$ results. By comparing our results with some observational data of\nmassive white dwarfs we also find a lower limit for $\\lambda$, namely, $\\lambda\n>- 3\\times 10^{-4}$.\n", "  As astronomers increasingly exploit the information available in the time\ndomain, spectroscopic variability in particular opens broad new channels of\ninvestigation. Here we describe the selection algorithms for all targets\nintended for repeat spectroscopy in the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey\n(TDSS), part of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey within the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey-IV. Also discussed are the scientific rationale and\ntechnical constraints leading to these target selections. The TDSS includes a\nlarge \"Repeat Quasar Spectroscopy\" (RQS) program delivering ~13,000 repeat\nspectra of confirmed SDSS quasars, and several smaller \"Few-Epoch Spectroscopy\"\n(FES) programs targeting specific classes of quasars as well as stars. The RQS\nprogram aims to provide a large and diverse quasar data set for studying\nvariations in quasar spectra on timescales of years, a comparison sample for\nthe FES quasar programs, and opportunity for discovering rare, serendipitous\nevents. The FES programs cover a wide variety of phenomena in both quasars and\nstars. Quasar FES programs target broad absorption line quasars, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio normal broad line quasars, quasars with double-peaked or\nvery asymmetric broad emission line profiles, binary supermassive black hole\ncandidates, and the most photometrically variable quasars. Strongly variable\nstars are also targeted for repeat spectroscopy, encompassing many types of\neclipsing binary systems, and classical pulsators like RR Lyrae. Other stellar\nFES programs allow spectroscopic variability studies of active ultracool dwarf\nstars, dwarf carbon stars, and white dwarf/M dwarf spectroscopic binaries. We\npresent example TDSS spectra and describe anticipated sample sizes and results.\n", "  In the last decade, over a million stars were monitored to detect transiting\nplanets. Manual interpretation of potential exoplanet candidates is labor\nintensive and subject to human error, the results of which are difficult to\nquantify. Here we present a new method of detecting exoplanet candidates in\nlarge planetary search projects which, unlike current methods uses a neural\nnetwork. Neural networks, also called \"deep learning\" or \"deep nets\" are\ndesigned to give a computer perception into a specific problem by training it\nto recognize patterns. Unlike past transit detection algorithms deep nets learn\nto recognize planet features instead of relying on hand-coded metrics that\nhumans perceive as the most representative. Our convolutional neural network is\ncapable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in noisy time-series data with a\ngreater accuracy than a least-squares method. Deep nets are highly\ngeneralizable allowing data to be evaluated from different time series after\ninterpolation without compromising performance. As validated by our deep net\nanalysis of Kepler light curves, we detect periodic transits consistent with\nthe true period without any model fitting. Our study indicates that machine\nlearning will facilitate the characterization of exoplanets in future analysis\nof large astronomy data sets.\n", "  We perform three-dimensional radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulations and investigate the impact of the Hall effect on the angular\nmomentum evolution in the collapsing cloud cores in which the magnetic field\n$\\magB$ and angular momentum $\\angJ$ are misaligned with each other. We find\nthat the Hall effect notably changes the magnetic torques in the pseudo-disk,\nand strengthens and weakens the magnetic braking in cores with an acute and\nobtuse relative angles between $\\magB$ and $\\angJ$, respectively. This suggests\nthat the bimodal evolution of the disk size may occur in early disk\nevolutionary phase even if $\\magB$ and $\\angJ$ are randomly distributed. We\nshow that a counter-rotating envelope form in the upper envelope of the\npseudo-disk in cloud cores with obtuse relative angles. We also find that a\ncounter-rotating region forms at the midplane of the pseudo-disk in cloud cores\nwith acute relative angles. The former and latter types of counter-rotating\nenvelopes may be associated with the YSOs with a large ($r\\sim100$ AU) and\nsmall ($r\\lesssim10$ AU) disks, respectively.\n", "  Muons can be created in nascent neutron stars (NSs) due to the high electron\nchemical potentials and the high temperatures. Because of their relatively\nlower abundance compared to electrons, their role has so far been ignored in\nnumerical simulations of stellar core collapse and NS formation. However, the\nappearance of muons softens the NS equation of state, triggers faster NS\ncontraction and thus leads to higher luminosities and mean energies of the\nemitted neutrinos. This strengthens the postshock heating by neutrinos and can\nfacilitate explosions by the neutrino-driven mechanism.\n", "  We examine the relevance of tidal heating for large Trans-Neptunian Objects,\nwith a focus on its potential to melt and maintain layers of subsurface liquid\nwater. Depending on their past orbital evolution, tidal heating may be an\nimportant part of the heat budget for a number of discovered and hypothetical\nTNO systems and may enable formation of, and increased access to, subsurface\nliquid water. Tidal heating induced by the process of despinning is found to be\nparticularly able to compete with heating due to radionuclide decay in a number\nof different scenarios. In cases where radiogenic heating alone may establish\nsubsurface conditions for liquid water, we focus on the extent by which tidal\nactivity lifts the depth of such conditions closer to the surface. While it is\ncommon for strong tidal heating and long lived tides to be mutually exclusive,\nwe find this is not always the case, and highlight when these two traits occur\ntogether.\n", "  The dark exciton state in semiconductor quantum dots constitutes a long-lived\nsolid-state qubit which has the potential to play an important role in\nimplementations of solid-state based quantum information architectures. In this\nwork, we exploit deterministically fabricated QD microlenses with enhanced\nphoton extraction, to optically prepare and readout the dark exciton spin and\nobserve its coherent precession. The optical access to the dark exciton is\nprovided via spin-blockaded metastable biexciton states acting as heralding\nstate, which are identified deploying polarization-sensitive spectroscopy as\nwell as time-resolved photon cross-correlation experiments. Our experiments\nreveal a spin-precession period of the dark exciton of $(0.82\\pm0.01)\\,$ns\ncorresponding to a fine-structure splitting of $(5.0\\pm0.7)\\,\\mu$eV between its\neigenstates $\\left|\\uparrow\\Uparrow\\pm\\downarrow\\Downarrow\\right\\rangle$. By\nexploiting microlenses deterministically fabricated above pre-selected QDs, our\nwork demonstrates the possibility to scale up implementations of quantum\ninformation processing schemes using the QD-confined dark exciton spin qubit,\nsuch as the generation of photonic cluster states or the realization of a\nsolid-state-based quantum memory.\n", "  Realistic oxide materials are often semiconductors, in particular at elevated\ntemperatures, and their surfaces contain undercoordiated atoms at structural\ndefects such as steps and corners. Using hybrid density-functional theory and\nab initio atomistic thermodynamics, we investigate the interplay of\nbond-making, bond-breaking, and charge-carrier trapping at the corner defects\nat the (100) surface of a p-doped MgO in thermodynamic equilibrium with an O2\natmosphere. We show that by manipulating the coordination of surface atoms one\ncan drastically change and even reverse the order of stability of reduced\nversus oxidized surface sites.\n", "  An important hurdle to be faced by any model proposing a resolution to the\ncosmological constant problem is Weinberg's venerable no go theorem. This\ntheorem states that no local field equations including classical gravity can\nhave a flat Minkowski solution for generic values of the parameters, in other\nwords, the no go theorem forbids the existence of any solution to the\ncosmological constant problem within local field theories without fine tuning.\nThough the original Weinberg theorem is valid only in classical gravity, in\nthis article we prove that this theorem holds even in quantum gravity. Our\nproof is very general since it makes use of the BRST invariance emerging after\ngauge-fixing of general coordinate invariance and does not depend on the detail\nof quantum gravity.\n", "  We provide a nonperturbative theory for photoionization of transparent\nsolids. By applying a particular steepest-descent method, we derive analytical\nexpressions for the photoionization rate within the two-band structure model,\nwhich consistently account for the $selection$ $rules$ related to the parity of\nthe number of absorbed photons ($odd$ or $even$). We demonstrate the crucial\nrole of the interference of the transition amplitudes (saddle-points), which in\nthe semi-classical limit, can be interpreted in terms of interfering quantum\ntrajectories. Keldysh's foundational work of laser physics [Sov. Phys. JETP 20,\n1307 (1965)] disregarded this interference, resulting in the violation of\n$selection$ $rules$. We provide an improved Keldysh photoionization theory and\nshow its excellent agreement with measurements for the frequency dependence of\nthe two-photon absorption and nonlinear refractive index coefficients in\ndielectrics.\n", "  The evolution of the X-ray emitting gas mass fraction ($f_{gas}$) in massive\ngalaxy clusters can be used as an independent cosmological tool to probe the\nexpansion history of the Universe. Its use, however, depends upon a crucial\nquantity, i.e., the depletion factor $\\gamma$, which corresponds to the ratio\nby which $f_{gas}$ is depleted with respect to the universal baryonic mean.\nThis quantity is not directly observed and hydrodynamical simulations performed\nin a specific cosmological model (e.g., a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology) have\nbeen used to calibrate it. In this work, we obtain for the first time\nself-consistent observational constraints on the gas depletion factor combining\n40 X-ray emitting gas mass fraction measurements and luminosity distance\nmeasurements from type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Processes to reconstruct a\npossible redshift evolution of $\\gamma$, we find no evidence for such\nevolution, which confirms the current results from hydrodynamical simulations.\nMoreover, our constraints on $\\gamma$ can be seen as a data prior for\ncosmological analyses on different cosmological models. The current\nmeasurements are systematic limited, so future improvements will depend heavily\non a better mass calibration of galaxy clusters and their measured density\nprofiles.\n", "  The combination of ferromagnets with topological superconductors or\ninsulators allows for new phases of matter that support excitations such as\nchiral edge modes and Majorana fermions. EuS, a wide-band-gap ferromagnetic\ninsulator with a Curie temperature around 16 K, and SrTiO$_3$ (STO), an\nimportant substrate for engineering heterostructures, may support these phases.\nWe present scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\nmeasurements of EuS grown epitaxially on STO that reveal micron-scale\nvariations in ferromagnetism and paramagnetism. These variations are oriented\nalong the STO crystal axes and only change their configuration upon thermal\ncycling above the STO cubic-to-tetragonal structural transition temperature at\n105 K, indicating that the observed magnetic features are due to coupling\nbetween EuS and the STO tetragonal structure. We speculate that the STO\ntetragonal distortions may strain the EuS, altering the magnetic anisotropy on\na micron-scale. This result demonstrates that local variation in the induced\nmagnetic order from EuS grown on STO needs to be considered when engineering\nnew phases of matter that require spatially homogeneous exchange.\n", "  We introduce a framework for studying the effects of self-interaction on the\nconstruction of point particle initial data in General Relativity. Within this\nframework we rigorously prove the vanishing mass claim made by Arnowitt, Deser\nand Misner regarding point sources. We identify a geometric structure and a\nscaling parameter that allow one to determine, by controlling the effects of\nself-interaction, when one does or does not obtain a non-zero mass.\n", "  We derive the SFH of MS galaxies showing how the SFH peak of a galaxy depends\non its seed mass at e.g. z=5. Following the MS, galaxies undergo a drastic slow\ndown of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH.\nAccording to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM\nhalos which state could results in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies\nand thus could be at the origin of the limited stellar mass growth. As a\nresult, galaxies on the MS can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram\nwhile still forming stars. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to\nretrieve the SFR of galaxies from SED fitting is studied. Due to mathematical\nlimitations, the exp-declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR which\nstarts to be problematic at z>2. The exp-rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the\nopposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model\nstarburst galaxies, but not low values such as those expected at low redshift\nfor massive galaxies. We show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR\nof MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are,\nhowever, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS but\nall the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However,\nthese SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS which is\nnot exhibited by a simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real\ndata, using a sample of GOODS-South galaxies at 1.5<z<1.2. We propose a SFH\ncomposed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population plus a\nflexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR\nof MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all z. Furthermore, used on\nthe GOODS-South sample, the age gradient disappears, showing its dependency on\nthe SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.\n", "  Perturbatively around flat space, the scattering amplitudes of gravity are\nrelated to those of Yang-Mills by colour-kinematic duality, under which\ngravitational amplitudes are obtained as the 'double copy' of the corresponding\ngauge theory amplitudes. We consider the question of how to extend this\nrelationship to curved scattering backgrounds, focusing on certain 'sandwich'\nplane waves. We calculate the 3-point amplitudes on these backgrounds and find\nthat a notion of double copy remains in the presence of background curvature:\ngraviton amplitudes on a gravitational plane wave are the double copy of gluon\namplitudes on a gauge field plane wave. This is non-trivial in that it requires\na non-local replacement rule for the background fields and the momenta and\npolarization vectors of the fields scattering on the backgrounds. It must also\naccount for new 'tail' terms arising from scattering off the background. These\nencode a memory effect in the scattering amplitudes, which naturally double\ncopies as well.\n", "  The Quark-Hadron Chiral Parity-Doublet model (Q$\\chi$P) is applied to\ncalculate compact star properties in the presence of a deconfinement phase\ntransition. Within this model, a consistent description of nuclear matter\nproperties, chiral symmetry restoration, and a transition from hadronic to\nquark and gluonic degrees of freedom is possible within one unified approach.\nWe find that the equation of state obtained is consistent with recent\nperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results and is able to accommodate\nobservational constraints of massive and small neutron stars. Furthermore, we\nshow that important features of the equation of state, such as the symmetry\nenergy and its slope, are well within their observational constraints.\n", "  In this paper we present and characterize a nearest-neighbors color-matching\nphotometric redshift estimator that features a direct relationship between the\nprecision and accuracy of the input magnitudes and the output photometric\nredshifts. This aspect makes our estimator an ideal tool for evaluating the\nimpact of changes to LSST survey parameters that affect the measurement errors\nof the photometry, which is the main motivation of our work (i.e., it is not\nintended to provide the \"best\" photometric redshifts for LSST data). We show\nhow the photometric redshifts will improve with time over the 10-year LSST\nsurvey and confirm that the nominal distribution of visits per filter provides\nthe most accurate photo-$z$ results. The LSST survey strategy naturally\nproduces observations over a range of airmass, which offers the opportunity of\nusing an SED- and $z$-dependent atmospheric affect on the observed photometry\nas a color-independent redshift indicator. We show that measuring this airmass\neffect and including it as a prior has the potential to improve the photometric\nredshifts and can ameliorate extreme outliers, but that it will only be\nadequately measured for the brightest galaxies, which limits its overall impact\non LSST photometric redshifts. We furthermore demonstrate how this airmass\neffect can induce a bias in the photo-$z$ results, and caution against survey\nstrategies that prioritize high-airmass observations for the purpose of\nimproving this prior. Ultimately, we intend for this work to serve as a guide\nfor the expectations and preparations of the LSST science community with\nregards to the minimum quality of photo-$z$ as the survey progresses.\n", "  Recently, Ozawa and Berthier [J. Chem. Phys., 2017, 146, 014502] studied the\nconfigurational and vibrational entropies $S_c$ and $S_v$ from the relation\n$S_{tot}=S_c+S_v$ for polydisperse mixtures of spheres. They noticed that\nbecause $S_{tot}/N$ shall contain the mixing entropy per particle $k_B s_m$ and\n$S_v/N$ shall not, the configurational entropy per particle $S_c/N$ shall\ndiverge in the thermodynamic limit for continuous polydispersity due to the\ndiverging $s_m$. They also provided a resolution for this paradox and related\nproblems-it relies on a careful redefining of $S_c$ and $S_v$. Here, we note\nthat the relation $S_{tot}=S_c+S_v$ is essentially a geometric relation in the\nphase space and shall hold without redefining $S_c$ and $S_v$. We also note\nthat the total entropy per particle $S_{tot}/N$ diverges with $N \\to \\infty$\nwith continuous polydispersity as well. The usual way to avoid this and other\ndifficulties with $S_{tot}/N$ is to work with the excess entropy $\\Delta\nS_{tot}$ (relative to the ideal gas of the same polydispersity). Speedy [Mol.\nPhys., 1998, 95, 169] applied this approach to the relation above and wrote\nthis relation as $\\Delta S_{tot}=S_c+\\Delta S_v$. This form has flows as well,\nbecause $S_v/N$ does not contain the $k_B s_m$ term and the latter is\nintroduced into $\\Delta S_v/N$ instead. Here, we suggest that this relation\nshall actually be written as $\\Delta S_{tot}=\\Delta_c S_c+\\Delta_v S_v$, where\n$\\Delta=\\Delta_c+\\Delta_v$ while $\\Delta_c S_c=S_c-k_B N s_m$ and $\\Delta_v\nS_v=S_v-k_B N[1+\\ln(V/\\Lambda^d N)+U/N k_B T]$ with $\\Lambda$ standing for the\nde Broglie wavelength. In this form, all the terms per particle are always\nfinite for $N \\to \\infty$ and continuous when introducing a small\npolydispersity to a monodisperse system. We also suggest that the Adam-Gibbs\nand related relations shall in fact contain $\\Delta_c S_c/N$ instead of\n$S_c/N$.\n", "  We have studied the mass spectra of the hidden-charm/bottom $qc\\bar q\\bar c$,\n$sc\\bar s\\bar c$ and $qb\\bar q\\bar b$, $sb\\bar s\\bar b$ tetraquark states with\n$J^{PC}=0^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ in the framework of QCD sum rules. We construct\nten scalar and four tensor interpolating currents in a systematic way and\ncalculate the mass spectra for these tetraquark states. The $X^\\ast(3860)$ may\nbe either an isoscalar tetraquark state or $\\chi_{c0}(2P)$. If the\n$X^\\ast(3860)$ is a tetraquark candidate, our results prefer the $0^{++}$\noption over the $2^{++}$ one. The $X(4160)$ may be classified as either the\nscalar or tensor $qc\\bar q\\bar c$ tetraquark state while the $X(3915)$ favors a\n$0^{++}$ $qc\\bar q\\bar c$ or $sc\\bar s\\bar c$ tetraquark assignment over the\ntensor one. The $X(4350)$ can not be interpreted as a $sc\\bar s\\bar c$\ntetraquark with either $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ or $2^{++}$.\n", "  Supernova (SN) 2016bdu is an unusual transient resembling SN 2009ip. SN\n2009ip-like events are characterized by a long-lasting phase of erratic\nvariability which ends with two luminous outbursts a few weeks apart. The\nsecond outburst is significantly more luminous (about 3 mag) than the first. In\nthe case of SN 2016bdu, the first outburst (Event A) reached an absolute\nmagnitude M(r) ~ -15.3 mag, while the second one (Event B) occurred over one\nmonth later and reached M(r) ~ -18 mag. By inspecting archival data, a faint\nsource at the position of SN 2016bdu is detectable several times in the past\nfew years. We interpret these detections as signatures of a phase of erratic\nvariability, similar to that experienced by SN 2009ip between 2008 and\nmid-2012, and resembling the currently observed variability of the luminous\nblue variable SN 2000ch in NGC 3432. Spectroscopic monitoring of SN 2016bdu\nduring the second peak initially shows features typical of a SN IIn. One month\nafter the Event B maximum, the spectra develop broad Balmer lines with P Cygni\nprofiles and broad metal features. At these late phases, the spectra resemble\nthose of a typical Type II SN. All members of this SN 2009ip-like group are\nremarkably similar to the Type IIn SN 2005gl. For this object, the claim of a\nterminal SN explosion is supported by the disappearance of the progenitor star.\nThe similarity with SN 2005gl suggests that all members of this family may\nfinally explode as genuine SNe, although the unequivocal detection of\nnucleosynthesised elements in their nebular spectra is still missing.\n", "  Many classical results in relativity theory concerning spherically symmetric\nspace-times have easy generalizations to warped product space-times, with a\ntwo-dimensional Lorentzian base and arbitrary dimensional Riemannian fibers. We\nfirst give a systematic presentation of the main geometric constructions, with\nemphasis on the Kodama vector field and the Hawking energy; the construction is\nsignature independent. This leads to proofs of general Birkhoff-type theorems\nfor warped product manifolds; our theorems in particular apply to situations\nwhere the warped product manifold is not necessarily Einstein, and thus can be\napplied to solutions with matter content in general relativity. Next we\nspecialize to the Lorentzian case and study the propagation of null expansions\nunder the assumption of the dominant energy condition. We prove several\nnon-existence results relating to the Yamabe class of the fibers, in the spirit\nof the black-hole topology theorem of Hawking-Galloway-Schoen. Finally we\ndiscuss the effect of the warped product ansatz on matter models. In particular\nwe construct several cosmological solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations\nwhose spatial geometry is generally not isotropic.\n", "  We consider an arbitrary quantum system coupled non perturbatively to a large\narbitrary and fully quantum environment. In [G. Ithier and F. Benaych-Georges,\nPhys. Rev. A 96, 012108 (2017)] the typicality of the dynamics of such an\nembedded quantum system was established for several classes of random\ninteractions. In other words, the time evolution of its quantum state does not\ndepend on the microscopic details of the interaction. Focusing at the long time\nregime, we use this property to calculate analytically a new partition function\ncharacterizing the stationary state and involving the overlaps between\neigenvectors of a bare and a dressed Hamiltonian. This partition function\nprovides a new thermodynamical ensemble which includes the microcanonical and\ncanonical ensembles as particular cases. We check our predictions with\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  We present the minimal model of electroweak baryogenesis induced by fermions.\nThe model consists of an extension of the Standard Model with one electroweak\nsinglet fermion and one pair of vector like doublet fermions with\nrenormalizable couplings to the Higgs. A strong first order phase transition is\nradiatively induced by the singlet-doublet fermions, while the origin of the\nbaryon asymmetry is due to asymmetric reflection of the same set of fermions on\nthe expanding electroweak bubble wall. The singlet-doublet fermions are\nstabilized at the electroweak scale by chiral symmetries and the Higgs\npotential is stabilized by threshold corrections coming from a multi-TeV\nultraviolet completion which does not play any significant role in the phase\ntransition. We work in terms of background symmetry invariants and perform an\nanalytic semiclassical calculation of the baryon asymmetry, showing that the\nmodel may effectively generate the observed baryon asymmetry for percent level\nvalues of the unique invariant CP violating phase of the singlet-doublet\nsector. We include a detailed study of electron electric dipole moment and\nelectroweak precision limits, and for one typical benchmark scenario we also\nrecast existing collider constraints, showing that the model is consistent with\nall current experimental data. We point out that fermion induced electroweak\nbaryogenesis has irreducible phenomenology at the $13 \\, \\textrm{TeV}$ LHC\nsince the new fermions must be at the electroweak scale, have electroweak\nquantum numbers and couple strongly with the Higgs. The most promising searches\ninvolve topologies with multiple leptons and missing energy in the final state.\n", "  Searches for new phenomena in high-mass diphoton final states with the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC are presented. The analysis is based on $pp$ collision\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.7 fb$^{-1}$ at a\ncentre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016. Searches are\nperformed for resonances with spin 0, as predicted by theories with an extended\nHiggs sector, and for resonances with spin 2, using a warped extra-dimension\nmodel as a benchmark model, as well as for non-resonant signals, assuming a\nlarge extra-dimension scenario. No significant deviation from the Standard\nModel is observed. Upper limits are placed on the production cross section\ntimes branching ratio to two photons as a function of the resonance mass. In\naddition, lower limits are set on the ultraviolet cutoff scale in the large\nextra-dimensions model.\n", "  Based on the theory of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, we generalize the\nexpression of the Casimir force for nonreciprocal media. The essential\ningredient of this result is the Green's tensor between two nonreciprocal\nsemi-infinite slabs including a reflexion matrix with four coefficients that\nmixes optical polarizations. This Green's tensor does not obey Lorentz's\nreciprocity and thus violates time-reversal symmetry. The general result for\nthe Casimir force is analyzed in the retarded and nonretarded limits,\nconcentrating on the influences arising from reflections with or without change\nof polarization. In a second step we apply our general result to a photonic\ntopological insulator whose nonreciprocity stems from an anisotropic\npermittivity tensor, namely InSb. We show that there is a regime for the\ndistance between the slabs where the magnitude of the Casimir force is tunable\nby an external magnetic field. Furthermore the strength of this tuning depends\non the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the slab surfaces.\n", "  The high-temperature normal state of the unconventional cuprate\nsuperconductors has resistivity linear in temperature $T$, which persists to\nvalues well beyond the Mott-Ioffe-Regel upper bound. At low-temperature, within\nthe pseudogap phase, the resistivity is instead quadratic in $T$, as would be\nexpected from Fermi liquid theory. Developing an understanding of these normal\nphases of the cuprates is crucial to explain the unconventional\nsuperconductivity. We present a simple explanation for this behavior, in terms\nof umklapp scattering of electrons. This fits within the general picture\nemerging from functional renormalization group calculations that spurred the\nYang-Rice-Zhang ansatz: umklapp scattering is at the heart of the behavior in\nthe normal phase.\n", "  All existing quantum gravity proposals share the same deep problem. Their\npredictions are extremely hard to test in practice. Quantum effects in the\ngravitational field are exceptionally small, unlike those in the\nelectromagnetic field. The fundamental reason is that the gravitational\ncoupling constant is about 43 orders of magnitude smaller than the fine\nstructure constant, which governs light-matter interactions. For example, the\ndetection of gravitons -- the hypothetical quanta of energy of the\ngravitational field predicted by certain quantum-gravity proposals -- is deemed\nto be practically impossible. In this letter we adopt a radically different,\nquantum-information-theoretic approach which circumvents the problem that\nquantum gravity is hard to test. We propose an experiment to witness\nquantum-like features in the gravitational field, by probing it with two masses\neach in a superposition of two locations. First, we prove the fact that any\nsystem (e.g. a field) capable of mediating entanglement between two quantum\nsystems must itself be quantum. This argument is general and does not rely on\nany specific dynamics. Then, we propose an experiment to detect the\nentanglement generated between two masses via gravitational interaction. By our\nargument, the degree of entanglement between the masses is an indirect witness\nof the quantisation of the field mediating the interaction. Remarkably, this\nexperiment does not require any quantum control over gravity itself. It is also\ncloser to realisation than other proposals, such as detecting gravitons or\ndetecting quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations.\n", "  Understanding gravity in the framework of quantum mechanics is one of the\ngreat challenges in modern physics. Along this line, a prime question is to\nfind whether gravity is a quantum entity subject to the rules of quantum\nmechanics. It is fair to say that there are no feasible ideas yet to test the\nquantum coherent behaviour of gravity directly in a laboratory experiment.\nHere, we introduce an idea for such a test based on the principle that two\nobjects cannot be entangled without a quantum mediator. We show that despite\nthe weakness of gravity, the phase evolution induced by the gravitational\ninteraction of two micron size test masses in adjacent matter-wave\ninterferometers can detectably entangle them even when they are placed far\napart enough to keep Casimir-Polder forces at bay. We provide a prescription\nfor witnessing this entanglement, which certifies gravity as a quantum coherent\nmediator, through simple correlation measurements between two spins: one\nembedded in each test mass. Fundamentally, the above entanglement is shown to\ncertify the presence of non-zero off-diagonal terms in the coherent state basis\nof the gravitational field modes.\n", "  Weyl semimetals possess low energy excitations which act as monopoles of\nBerry curvature in momentum space. These emergent monopoles are at the heart of\nthe extensive novel transport properties that Weyl semimetals exhibit. The\nsingular nature of the Berry curvature around the nodal points in Weyl\nsemimetals allows for the possibility of large anomalous transport coefficients\nin zero applied magnetic field. Recently a new class, termed type-II Weyl\nsemimetals, has been demonstrated in a variety of materials, where the Weyl\nnodes are tilted. We present here a study of anomalous transport in this new\nclass of Weyl semimetals. We find that the parameter governing the tilt of\nthese type-II Weyl points is intimately related to the zero field transverse\ntransport properties. We also find that the temperature dependence of the\nchemical potential plays an important role in determining how the transport\ncoefficients can effectively probe the Berry curvature of the type-II Weyl\npoints. We also discuss the experimental implications of our work for\ntime-reversal breaking type-II Weyl semimetals.\n", "  We report on VLA measurements between 1 and 45 GHz of the evolving radio\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of SN 1986J, made in conjunction with VLBI\nimaging. The SED of SN 1986J is unique among supernovae, and shows an inversion\npoint and a high-frequency turnover. Both are due to the central component seen\nin the VLBI images, and both are progressing downward in frequency with time.\nThe optically-thin spectral index of the central component is almost the same\nas that of the shell. We fit a simple model to the evolving SED consisting of\nan optically-thin shell and a partly-absorbed central component. The evolution\nof the SED is consistent with that of a homologously expanding system. Both\ncomponents are fading, but the shell more rapidly. We conclude that the central\ncomponent is physically inside the expanding shell, and not a surface hot-spot\ncentral only in projection. Our observations are consistent with the central\ncomponent being due to interaction of the shock with the dense and\nhighly-structured circumstellar medium that resulted from a period of\ncommon-envelope evolution of the progenitor. However a young pulsar-wind nebula\nor emission from an accreting black hole can also not be ruled out at this\npoint.\n", "  Spin liquids are exotic quantum states characterized by the existence of\nfractional and deconfined quasiparticle excitations, referred to as spinons and\nvisons. Their fractional nature establishes topological properties such as a\nprotected ground-state degeneracy. This work investigates spin-orbit coupled\nspin liquids where, additionally, topology enters via non-trivial band\nstructures of the spinons. We revisit the $Z_2$ spin-liquid phases that have\nrecently been identified in a projective symmetry-group analysis on the square\nlattice when spin-rotation symmetry is maximally lifted [Phys. Rev. B 90,\n174417 (2014)]. We find that in the case of nearest neighbor couplings only,\n$Z_2$ spin liquids on the square lattice always exhibit trivial spinon bands.\nAdding second neighbor terms, the simplest projective symmetry-group solution\nclosely resembles the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for topological insulators.\nAssuming that the emergent gauge fields are static we investigate vison\nexcitations, which we confirm to be deconfined in all investigated spin phases.\nParticularly, if the spinon bands are topological, the spinons and visons form\nbound states consisting of several spinon-Majorana zero modes coupling to one\nvison. The existence of such zero modes follows from an exact mapping between\nthese spin phases and topological $p+ip$ superconductors with vortices. We\npropose experimental probes to detect such states in real materials.\n", "  We present a mode-coupling theory (MCT) for the high-density dynamics of\ntwo-dimensional spherical active Brownian particles (ABP). The theory is based\non the integration-through-transients (ITT) formalism and hence provides a\nstarting point for the calculation of non-equilibrium averages in\nactive-Brownian particle systems. The ABP are characterized by a\nself-propulsion velocity $v_0$, and by their translational and rotational\ndiffusion coefficients, $D_t$ and $D_r$. The theory treats both the\ntranslational and the orientational degrees of freedom of ABP explicitly. This\nallows to study the effect of self-propulsion of both weak and strong\npersistence of the swimming direction, also at high densities where the\npersistence length $\\ell_p=v_0/D_r$ is large compared to the typical\ninteraction length scale. While the low-density dynamics of ABP is\ncharacterized by a single P\\'eclet number, $Pe=v_0^2/D_rD_t$, close to the\nglass transition the dynamics is found to depend on $Pe$ and $\\ell_p$\nseparately. At fixed density, increasing the self-propulsion velocity causes\nstructural relaxatino to speed up, while decreasing the persistence length\nslows down the relaxation. The theory predicts a non-trivial\nidealized-glass-transition diagram in the three-dimensional parameter space of\ndensity, self-propulsion velocity and rotational diffusivity. The active-MCT\nglass is a nonergodic state where correlations of initial density fluctuations\nnever fully decay, but also an infinite memory of initial orientational\nfluctuations is retained in the positions.\n", "  Analytical formulation of sub-cycle modulation (SCM) of dielectrics including\nelectron excitation is presented. The SCM is sensitive to not only the\ntime-resolved dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect (Tr-DFKE) [T. Otobe, et al., Phys.\nRev. B 93, 045124 (2016)], which is the nonlinear response without the electron\nexcitation, but also the excited electrons. The excited electrons enhance the\nmodulation with even-harmonics of pump laser frequency, and generate the\nodd-harmonics components. The new aspect of SCM is a consequence of i) the\ninterference between the electrons excited by the pump laser and those excited\nby the probe pulse laser and ii) oscillation of the generated wave packed by\nthe pump laser. When the probe- and pump-pulse polarizations are parallel, the\nenhancement of the even harmonics and the generation of the odd harmonics\nmodulation appear. However, if the polarizations are orthogonal, the effect\narising from the electron excitations becomes weak. By comparing the parabolic\nand cosine band models, I found that the electrons under the intense laser\nfield move as quasi-free particles.\n", "  We present 2271 radial velocity measurements taken on 118 single-line binary\nstars, taken over eight years with the CORALIE spectrograph. The binaries\nconsist of F/G/K primaries and M-dwarf secondaries. They were initially\ndiscovered photometrically by the WASP planet survey, as their shallow eclipses\nmimic a hot-Jupiter transit. The observations we present permit a precise\ncharacterisation of the binary orbital elements and mass function. With\nmodelling of the primary star this mass function is converted to a mass of the\nsecondary star. In the future, this spectroscopic work will be combined with\nprecise photometric eclipses to draw an empirical mass/radius relation for the\nbottom of the mass sequence. This has applications in both stellar astrophysics\nand the growing number of exoplanet surveys around M-dwarfs. In particular, we\nhave discovered 34 systems with a secondary mass below $0.2 M_\\odot$, and so we\nwill ultimately double the known number of very low-mass stars with well\ncharacterised mass and radii.\n  We are able to detect eccentricities as small as 0.001 and orbital periods to\nsub-second precision. Our sample can revisit some earlier work on the tidal\nevolution of close binaries, extending it to low mass ratios. We find some\nbinaries that are eccentric at orbital periods < 3 days, while our longest\ncircular orbit has a period of 10.4 days.\n  By collating the EBLM binaries with published WASP planets and brown dwarfs,\nwe derive a mass spectrum with twice the resolution of previous work. We\ncompare the WASP/EBLM sample of tightly-bound orbits with work in the\nliterature on more distant companions up to 10 AU. We note that the brown dwarf\ndesert appears wider, as it carves into the planetary domain for our\nshort-period orbits. This would mean that a significantly reduced abundance of\nplanets begins at $\\sim 3M_{\\rm Jup}$, well before the Deuterium-burning limit.\n[abridged]\n", "  We use orthogonally polarized two-colour (OTC) laser pulses to separate\nquantum paths in multiphoton ionization of Ar atoms. Our OTC pulses consist of\n400~nm and 800~nm light at a relative intensity ratio of 10:1. We find a\nhitherto unobserved interference in the photoelectron momentum distribution,\nwhich exhibits a strong dependence on the relative phase of the OTC pulse.\nAnalysis of model calculations reveal that the interference is caused by\nquantum pathways from non-adjacent quarter cycles.\n", "  The determination of the neutrino mass ordering is currently pursued by\nseveral experiments and proposals. A very challenging one is its evaluation\nfrom reactor experiments based on the tiny interference effect between the\n$\\Delta m^2_{31}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{32}$ oscillations. Current analyses require\nseveral years of data taking and an extreme energy resolution to achieve anyhow\nless than 5 $\\sigma$. Referring to the JUNO experimental conditions we\ndeveloped a completely new technique that would provide a robust 5 $\\sigma$\nmeasurement in less than six years of running. The two orderings could be\ndiscriminated at the price of allowing for two different values of $\\Delta\nm^2_{31}$. This degeneracy on $\\Delta m^2_{31}$ (around $12\\times 10^{-5}$\neV$^2$) can however be measured at an unprecedented accuracy of much less than\n1\\%, i.e. $10^{-5}$ eV$^2$, within the same analysis. Analogies with the usual\n$\\chi^2$ analysis, where the $\\Delta m^2_{31}$ degeneracy is much more\nimportant, are discussed. Evaluation and inclusion of systematic errors and\nbackgrounds have been performed, the most relevant among them being the\naddition of the two remote reactor plants 250 km away. Baselines of each\ncontributing reactor core and its spatial resolution have been taken into\naccount. Possible results after two years of running and the foreseen\ninitially-reduced available reactor power have been studied, too. These results\nconfirm the very positive perspectives for JUNO to determine the mass ordering\nin a vacuum-oscillation dominated region.\n", "  This paper defines the amortized entanglement of a quantum channel as the\nlargest difference in entanglement between the output and the input of the\nchannel, where entanglement is quantified by an arbitrary entanglement measure.\nWe prove that the amortized entanglement of a channel obeys several desirable\nproperties, and we also consider special cases such as the amortized relative\nentropy of entanglement and the amortized Rains relative entropy. These latter\nquantities are shown to be single-letter upper bounds on the\nsecret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of a quantum channel,\nrespectively. Of especial interest is a uniform continuity bound for these\nlatter two special cases of amortized entanglement, in which the deviation\nbetween the amortized entanglement of two channels is bounded from above by a\nsimple function of the diamond norm of their difference and the output\ndimension of the channels. We then define approximately teleportation- and\npositive-partial-transpose-simulable (PPT-simulable) channels as those that are\nclose in diamond norm to a channel which is either exactly teleportation- or\nPPT-simulable, respectively. These results then lead to single-letter upper\nbounds on the secret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of\nchannels that are approximately teleportation- or PPT-simulable, respectively.\nFinally, we generalize many of the concepts in the paper to the setting of\ngeneral resource theories, defining the amortized resourcefulness of a channel\nand the notion of $\\nu$-freely-simulable channels, connecting these concepts in\nan operational way as well.\n", "  We investigate whether the intrinsic spin of neutron stars leaves an\nobservable imprint on the spectral properties of X-ray binaries. To evaluate\nthis we consider a sample of nine NSs for which the spins have been measured\nthat are not accreting pulsars (for which the accretion geometry will be\ndifferent). For each source, we perform spectroscopy on a majority of RXTE hard\nstate observations. Our sample of sources and observations spans the range of\nthe Eddington ratios Lx/Ledd ~0.005-0.100. We find a clear trend between key\nComptonization properties and the NS spin for a given accretion rate.\nSpecifically, at a given Lx/Ledd, for more rapidly rotating NSs we find lower\nseed photon temperatures and a general increase in Comptonization strength, as\nparametrised by the Comptonization y parameter and amplification factor A. This\nis in good agreement with the theoretical scenario whereby less energy is\nliberated in a boundary layer for more rapidly spinning NSs, resulting in a\nlower seed photon luminosity and, consequently, less Compton cooling in the\ncorona. This effect in extremis results in the hard states of the most rapidly\nspinning sources encroaching upon the regime of Comptonization properties\noccupied by BHs.\n", "  In models of inflation driven by an axion-like pseudoscalar field, the\ninflaton, a, may couple to the standard model hypercharge via a\nChern-Simons-type interaction, $L \\subset a/(4\\Lambda) F\\tilde{F}$. This\ncoupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation,\nespecially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological\nconsequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally\nhelical. It is thus capable of sourcing the generation of nonzero baryon\nnumber, via the standard model chiral anomaly, around the time of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. For another thing, the gauge field production during\ninflation feeds back into the primordial tensor power spectrum, leaving an\nimprint in the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this\npaper, we focus on the correlation between these two phenomena. Working in the\napproximation of instant reheating, we (1) update the investigation of\nbaryogenesis via hypermagnetic fields from pseudoscalar inflation and (2)\nexamine the corresponding implications for the GW spectrum. We find that\nsuccessful baryogenesis requires a suppression scale Lambda of around Lambda ~\n3 x 10^17 GeV, which corresponds to a relatively weakly coupled axion. The\ngauge field production at the end of inflation is then typically accompanied by\na peak in the GW spectrum at frequencies in the MHz range or above. The\ndetection of such a peak is out of reach of present-day technology; but in the\nfuture, it may serve as a smoking-gun signal for baryogenesis from pseudoscalar\ninflation. Conversely, models that do yield an observable GW signal suffer from\nthe overproduction of baryon number, unless the reheating temperature is lower\nthan the electroweak scale.\n", "  We probed the relation between properties of Seyfert nuclei and morphology of\ntheir host galaxies. We selected Seyfert galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey with redshifts less 0.2 identified by the V\\'{e}ron Catalog (13th). We\nused the \"{\\it{FracDev}}\" parameter from SDSS galaxy fitting models to\nrepresent the bulge fractions of the Seyfert host galaxies. We found that the\nhost galaxies of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 are dominated by large bulge\nfractions, and Seyfert 2 galaxies are more likely to be located in disk\ngalaxies whereas most of the Seyfert 1 galaxies are located in bulge-dominant\ngalaxies. These results indicate that the types of AGNs are related to their\nhost galaxies and can not be explained by the traditional unification model of\nSeyfert galaxies.\n", "  Dynamical properties of spherically symmetric galaxy models where both the\nstellar and total mass density distributions are described by the Jaffe (1983)\nprofile (with different scale-lenghts and masses), are presented. The orbital\nstructure of the stellar component is described by Osipkov--Merritt anisotropy,\nand a black hole (BH) is added at the center of the galaxy; the dark matter\nhalo is isotropic. First, the conditions required to have a nowhere negative\nand monothonically decreasing dark matter halo density profile, are derived. We\nthen show that the phase-space distribution function can be recovered by using\nthe Lambert-Euler $W$ function, while in absence of the central BH only\nelementary functions appears in the integrand of the inversion formula. The\nminimum value of the anisotropy radius for consistency is derived in terms of\nthe galaxy parameters. The Jeans equations for the stellar component are solved\nanalytically, and the projected velocity dispersion at the center and at large\nradii are also obtained analytically for generic values of the anisotropy\nradius. Finally, the relevant global quantities entering the Virial Theorem are\ncomputed analytically, and the fiducial anisotropy limit required to prevent\nthe onset of Radial Orbit Instability is determined as a function of the galaxy\nparameters. The presented models, even though highly idealized, represent a\nsubstantial generalization of the models presentd in Ciotti et al. (2009), and\ncan be useful as starting point for more advanced modeling the dynamics and the\nmass distribution of elliptical galaxies.\n", "  An extended test body moving in a curved spacetime does not typically follow\na geodesic, because of forces that arise from couplings between its multipole\nmoments and the ambient curvature. An illustration of this fact was provided by\nWisdom, who showed that the motion of a quasi-rigid body undergoing cyclic\nchanges of shape in a curved spacetime deviates, in general, from a geodesic.\nWisdom's analysis, however, was recently challenged on the grounds that the\nbody's motion should be described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations,\nand that these predict geodesic motion for the kind of body considered by\nWisdom. We attempt to shed some light on this matter by examining the motion of\nan internally-moving tripod in Schwarzschild spacetime, as viewed by a Fermi\nobserver moving on a timelike geodesic. We find that the description of the\nmotion depends sensitively on a choice of cycle for the tripod's internal\nmotions, but also on a choice of \"center of mass\" for the tripod; a sensible\n(though not unique) prescription for this \"center of mass\" produces a motion\nthat conforms with Wisdom's prediction: the tripod drifts away from the\nobserver, even when they are given identical initial conditions. We suggest\npathways of reconciliation between this conclusion and the null result that\napparently follows from the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations of motion.\n", "  The solution space of three-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter or flat\nEinstein gravity is given by the coadjoint representation of two copies of the\nVirasoro group in the former and the centrally extended BMS$_3$ group in the\nlatter case. Dynamical actions that control these solution spaces are usually\nconstructed by starting from the Chern-Simons formulation and imposing all\nboundary conditions. In this note, an alternative route is followed. We study\nin detail how to derive these actions from a group-theoretical viewpoint by\nconstructing geometric actions for each of the coadjoint orbits, including the\nappropriate Hamiltonians. We briefly sketch relevant generalizations and\npotential applications beyond three-dimensional gravity.\n", "  We report low-temperature transport measurements in strained\nInAs/Ga0.68In0.32Sb quantum wells, which supports time-reversal\nsymmetry-protected helical edge states. The temperature and bias voltage\ndependence of the helical edge conductance for devices of various sizes are\nconsistent with the theoretical expectation of a weakly interacting helical\nedge state. Moreover, we found that the magnetoresistance of the helical edge\nstates is related to the edge interaction effect and the disorder strength.\n", "  We propose a nanodevice for single-electron spin initialization. It is based\non a gated planar semiconductor heterostructure with a quantum well and with\npotentials generated by voltages applied to local gates. Initially we insert an\nelectron with arbitrary spin into the nanodevice. Next we perform a sequence of\nspin manipulations, after which the spin is set in a desired direction (e.g.,\nthe growth direction). The operations are done all-electrically, do not require\nany external fields and do not depend on the initial spin direction.\n", "  Using an enhanced optically heterodyned optical Kerr effect method and a\ntheoretical description of the interactions between an optical beam, a single\nlayer of graphene, and its substrate, we provide experimental answers to\nquestions raised by theoretical models of graphene third-order nonlinear\noptical response. In particular, we measure separately the time response of the\ntwo main tensor components of the nonlinear susceptibility, we validate the\nassumption that the out-of plane tensor components are small, and we quantify\nthe optical impact of the substrate on the measured coefficients. Our method\ncan be applied to other 2D materials, as it relies mainly on the small ratio\nbetween the thickness and the wavelength.\n", "  We perform a survey of the X-ray properties of 41 objects from the WISE/SDSS\nselected Hyper-luminous (WISSH) quasars sample, composed by 86 broad-line\nquasars (QSOs) with bolometric luminosity $L_{Bol}\\geq 2\\times 10^{47}\\,erg\\,\ns^{-1}$, at z~2-4. All but 3 QSOs show unabsorbed 2-10 keV luminosities\n$L_{2-10}\\geq10^{45} \\,erg \\,s^{-1}$. Thanks to their extreme radiative output\nacross the Mid-IR-to-X-ray range, WISSH QSOs offer the opportunity to\nsignificantly extend and validate the existing relations involving $L_{2-10}$.\nWe study $L_{2-10}$ as a function of (i) X-ray-to-Optical (X/O) flux ratio,\n(ii) mid-IR luminosity ($L_{MIR}$), (iii) $L_{Bol}$ as well as (iv)\n$\\alpha_{OX}$ vs. the 2500$\\mathring{A}$ luminosity. We find that WISSH QSOs\nshow very low X/O(<0.1) compared to typical AGN values; $L_{2-10}/L_{MIR}$\nratios significantly smaller than those derived for AGN with lower luminosity;\nlarge X-ray bolometric corrections $k_{\\rm Bol,X}\\sim$ 100-1000; and steep\n$-2<\\alpha_{OX}<-1.7$. These results lead to a scenario where the X-ray\nemission of hyper-luminous quasars is relatively weaker compared to\nlower-luminosity AGN. Models predict that such an X-ray weakness can be\nrelevant for the acceleration of powerful high-ionization emission line-driven\nwinds, commonly detected in the UV spectra of WISSH QSOs, which can in turn\nperturb the X-ray corona and weaken its emission. Accordingly, hyper-luminous\nQSOs represent the ideal laboratory to study the link between the AGN energy\noutput and wind acceleration. Additionally, WISSH QSOs show very large BH\nmasses ($\\log[M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}]$>9.5). This enables a more robust modeling\nof the $\\Gamma-M_{BH}$ relation by increasing the statistics at high masses. We\nderive a flatter $\\Gamma$ dependence than previously found over the broad range\n5 <$\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot})$ < 11.\n", "  We systematically studied the two-body loss in a two-component Fermi gas of\n$^6$Li atoms near a p-wave Feshbach resonance. The two-body loss rate constants\nwere measured for various temperatures and magnetic fields using atoms trapped\nin three-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional traps. Our results were nicely\nreproduced by a theoretical model that incorporates the two-body loss as an\nimaginary part to the inverse of the scattering volume in the scattering\namplitude expression. The observed loss suppression in quasi-two-dimensional\ntraps may provide a promising strategy to realize a p-wave superfluid in a\nsystem of ultracold atoms.\n", "  We measure the radial profiles of the stellar velocity dispersions,\n$\\sigma(R)$, for 90 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the MASSIVE survey, a\nvolume-limited integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) galaxy survey targeting all\nnorthern-sky ETGs with absolute $K$-band magnitude $M_K < -25.3$ mag, or\nstellar mass $M_* > 4 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$, within 108 Mpc. Our wide-field\n107\" $\\times$ 107\" IFS data cover radii as large as 40 kpc, for which we\nquantify separately the inner (2 kpc) and outer (20 kpc) logarithmic slopes\n$\\gamma_{\\rm inner}$ and $\\gamma_{\\rm outer}$ of $\\sigma(R)$. While\n$\\gamma_{\\rm inner}$ is mostly negative, of the 56 galaxies with sufficient\nradial coverage to determine $\\gamma_{\\rm outer}$ we find 36% to have rising\nouter dispersion profiles, 30% to be flat within the uncertainties, and 34% to\nbe falling. The fraction of galaxies with rising outer profiles increases with\n$M_*$ and in denser galaxy environment, with 10 of the 11 most massive galaxies\nin our sample having flat or rising dispersion profiles. The strongest\nenvironmental correlations are with local density and halo mass, but a weaker\ncorrelation with large-scale density also exists. The average $\\gamma_{\\rm\nouter}$ is similar for brightest group galaxies, satellites, and isolated\ngalaxies in our sample. We find a clear positive correlation between the\ngradients of the outer dispersion profile and the gradients of the velocity\nkurtosis $h_4$. Altogether, our kinematic results suggest that the increasing\nfraction of rising dispersion profiles in the most massive ETGs are caused (at\nleast in part) by variations in the total mass profiles rather than in the\nvelocity anisotropy alone.\n", "  We present a reentrant phase transition in a bridging model between two\ndifferent topological models: Kitaev and Haldane chains. This model is\nactivated by introducing a bond alternation into the Kitaev chain [A. Yu\nKitaev, Phys.-Usp. {\\bf 44} 131 (2001)]. Without the bond alternation, finite\npairing potential induces a topological state defined by zero-energy Majorana\nedge mode, while finite bond alternation without the pairing potential makes a\ndifferent topological state similar to the Haldane state, which is defined by\nlocal Berry phase in the bulk. The topologically-ordered state corresponds to\nthe Su-Schrieffer-Heeger state, which is classified as the same symmetry class.\nWe thus find a phase transition between the two topological phases with a\nreentrant phenomenon, and extend the phase diagram in the plane of the pairing\npotential and the bond alternation by using three techniques: recursive\nequation, fidelity, and Pfaffian. In addition, we find that the phase\ntransition is characterized by both the change of the position of Majorana\nzero-energy modes from one edge to the other edge and the emergence of a string\norder in the bulk, and that the reentrance is based on a sublattice U(1)\nrotation. Consequently, our study and model do not only open a direct way to\ndiscuss the bulk and edge topologies, but demonstrate an example of the\nreentrant topologies.\n", "  In this article, we present the results of the surveys on sunspots and\nauroral candidates in Rikkokushi, Japanese Official Histories from the early\n7th century to 887 to review the solar and auroral activities. In total, we\nfound one sunspot record and 13 auroral candidates in Rikkokushi. We then\nexamine the records of the sunspots and auroral candidates, compare the auroral\ncandidates with the lunar phase to estimate the reliability of the auroral\ncandidates, and compare the records of the sunspots and auroral candidates with\nthe contemporary total solar irradiance reconstructed from radioisotope data.\nWe also identify the locations of the observational sites to review possible\nequatorward expansion of auroral oval. These discussions suggest a major gap of\nauroral candidates from the late 7th to early 9th century, which includes the\nminimum number of candidates reconstructed from the radioisotope data, a\nsimilar tendency as the distributions of sunspot records in contemporary China,\nand a relatively high magnetic latitude with a higher potential for observing\naurorae more frequently than at present.\n", "  Layered electrides, as typified by Ca$_2$N, are a new class of\nquasi-two-dimensional materials with low work functions. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we have shown that a graphene layer deposited on Ca$_2$N is doped\nto $n=5\\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ with its Fermi level aligned with the\nlogarithmically divergent van Hove singularity in the graphene $\\pi^*$ band.\nFor bilayer graphene on Ca$_2$N, the inner graphene layer is doped to the same\nlevel, while the doping of the outer graphene layer is much more modest. This\nfinding opens an interesting possibility of using layered electrides for the\nexploration of van Hove physics. The work function changes nonmonotonically\nwith the number of graphene layers, which we explain in terms of the peculiar\nelectronic structures of the constituent materials and their bonding.\n", "  In disordered elastic systems, driven by displacing a parabolic confining\npotential adiabatically slowly, all advance of the system is in bursts, termed\navalanches. Avalanches have a finite extension in time, which is much smaller\nthan the waiting-time between them. Avalanches also have a finite extension\n$\\ell$ in space, i.e. only a part of the interface of size $\\ell$ moves during\nan avalanche. Here we study their spatial shape $\\left< S(x)\\right>_{\\ell}$\ngiven $\\ell$, as well as its fluctuations encoded in the second cumulant\n$\\left< S^{2}(x)\\right>_{\\ell}^{{\\rm c}}$. We establish scaling relations\ngoverning the behavior close to the boundary. We then give analytic results for\nthe Brownian force model, in which the microscopic disorder for each degree of\nfreedom is a random walk. Finally, we confirm these results with numerical\nsimulations. To do this properly we elucidate the influence of discretization\neffects, which also confirms the assumptions entering into the scaling ansatz.\nThis allows us to reach the scaling limit already for avalanches of moderate\nsize. We find excellent agreement for the universal shape, its fluctuations,\nincluding all amplitudes.\n", "  We searched for X-ray candidates of the gravitational wave (GW) event\nGW150914 with Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). MAXI observed the error\nregion of the GW event GW150914 from 4 minutes after the event and covered\nabout 90% of the error region in 25 minutes. No significant time variations on\ntimescales of 1 s to 4 days were found in the GW error region. The $3\\sigma$\nupper limits for the X-ray emission associated with the GW event in 2--20 keV\nwere 9.5 $\\times 10^{-10}$, 2.3 $\\times 10^{-10}$, and 0.8 $\\times 10^{-10}$\nergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for the time scale of $\\sim$ 1000 s, 1 day, and 10\ndays, respectively. If GW events are associated with short GRBs like GRB\n050709, MAXI will be able to detect X-ray emissions from the source.\n", "  The error region of the the gravitational-wave (GW) event GW151226 was\nobserved with Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). MAXI was operated at the\ntime of GW151226, and continuously observed to 4 minutes after the event. MAXI\ncovered about 84% of the 90 percent error region of the GW event during the\nfirst 92 minutes orbit after the event. No significant X-ray transient was\ndetected in the GW error region. A typical 3-$\\sigma$ GSC upper limit for a\nscan is 1.2 $\\times 10^{-9}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 2-20 keV. The\nauto-detection (MAXI nova-search) systems detected a short excess event with a\nlow significance (2.85$\\sigma$) from 5257 s to 5260 s after the GW trigger.\nFinally, we discuss the sensitivity of MAXI to long X-ray emissions of short\ngamma-ray bursts, which are expected to accompany GW events.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling is a single-particle phenomenon known to generate\ntopological order, and electron-electron interactions cause ordered many-body\nphases to exist. The rich interplay of these two mechanisms is present in a\nbroad range of materials, and has been the subject of considerable ongoing\nresearch and controversy. Here we demonstrate that interacting two-dimensional\nelectron systems with strong spin-orbit coupling exhibit a variety of time\nreversal symmetry breaking phases with unconventional spin alignment. We first\nprove that a Stoner-type criterion can be formulated for the spin polarization\nresponse to an electric field, which predicts that the spin polarization\nsusceptibility diverges at a certain value of the electron-electron interaction\nstrength. The divergence indicates the possibility of unconventional\nferromagnetic phases even in the absence of any applied electric or magnetic\nfield. This leads us, in the second part of this work, to study interacting\nRashba spin-orbit coupled semiconductors in equilibrium in the Hartree-Fock\napproximation as a generic minimal model. Using classical Monte-Carlo\nsimulations we construct the complete phase diagram of the system as a function\nof density and spin-orbit coupling strength. It includes both an out-of-plane\nspin polarized phase and in-plane spin-polarized phases with shifted Fermi\nsurfaces and rich spin textures, reminiscent of the Pomeranchuk instability, as\nwell as two different Fermi-liquid phases having one and two Fermi surfaces,\nrespectively, which are separated by a Lifshitz transition. We discuss\npossibilities for experimental observation and useful application of these\nnovel phases, especially in the context of electric-field-controlled\nmacroscopic spin polarizations.\n", "  Nanoelectronic devices embedded in the two-dimensional electron system (2DES)\nof a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure enable a large variety of applications from\nfundamental research to high speed transistors. Electrical circuits are thereby\ncommonly defined by creating barriers for carriers by selective depletion of a\npre-existing 2DES. Here we explore an alternative approach: we deplete the 2DES\nglobally by applying a negative voltage to a global top gate and screen the\nelectric field of the top gate only locally using nanoscale gates placed on the\nwafer surface between the plane of the 2DES and the top gate. Free carriers are\nlocated beneath the screen gates and their properties can be controlled by\nmeans of geometry and applied voltages. This method promises considerable\nadvantages for the definition of complex circuits by the electric field effect\nas it allows to reduce the number of gates and simplify gate geometries.\nExamples are carrier systems with ring topology or large arrays of quantum\ndots. Here, we present a first exploration of this method pursuing field\neffect, Hall effect and Aharonov-Bohm measurements to study electrostatic,\ndynamic and coherent properties.\n", "  The protoplanetary disk around HL Tau is so far the youngest candidate of\nplanet formation, and it is still embedded in a protostellar envelope with a\nsize of thousands of au. In this work, we study the gas kinematics in the\nenvelope and its possible influence on the embedded disk. We present our new\nALMA cycle 3 observational results of HL Tau in the 13CO (2-1) and C18O (2-1)\nemission at resolutions of 0.8\" (110 au), and we compare the observed velocity\npattern with models of different kinds of gas motions. Both the 13CO and C18O\nemission lines show a central compact component with a size of 2\" (280 au),\nwhich traces the protoplanetary disk. The disk is clearly resolved and shows a\nKeplerian motion, from which the protostellar mass of HL Tau is estimated to be\n1.8+/-0.3 M$_\\odot$, assuming the inclination angle of the disk to be 47 deg\nfrom the plane of the sky. The 13CO emission shows two arc structures with\nsizes of 1000-2000 au and masses of 3E-3 M$_\\odot$ connected to the central\ndisk. One is blueshifted and stretches from the northeast to the northwest, and\nthe other is redshifted and stretches from the southwest to the southeast. We\nfind that simple kinematical models of infalling and (counter-)rotating\nflattened envelopes cannot fully explain the observed velocity patterns in the\narc structures. The gas kinematics of the arc structures can be better\nexplained with three-dimensional infalling or outflowing motions. Nevertheless,\nthe observed velocity in the northwestern part of the blueshifted arc structure\nis ~60-70% higher than the expected free-fall velocity. We discuss two possible\norigins of the arc structures: (1) infalling flows externally compressed by an\nexpanding shell driven by XZ Tau and (2) outflowing gas clumps caused by\ngravitational instabilities in the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau.\n", "  Protein and lipid nanodomains are prevalent on the surface of mammalian\ncells. In particular, it has been recently recognized that ion channels\nassemble into surface nanoclusters in the soma of cultured neurons. However,\nthe interactions of these molecules with surface nanodomains display a\nconsiderable degree of heterogeneity. Here, we investigate this heterogeneity\nand develop statistical tools based on the recurrence of individual\ntrajectories to identify subpopulations within ion channels in the neuronal\nsurface. We specifically study the dynamics of the K$^+$ channel Kv1.4 and the\nNa$^+$ channel Nav1.6 on the surface of cultured hippocampal neurons at the\nsingle-molecule level. We find that both these molecules are expressed in two\ndifferent forms with distinct kinetics with regards to surface interactions,\nemphasizing the complex proteomic landscape of the neuronal surface. Further,\nthe tools presented in this work provide new methods for the analysis of\nmembrane nanodomains, transient confinement, and identification of populations\nwithin single-particle trajectories.\n", "  The phase-matching condition is a key aspect in nonlinear wavelength\nconversion processes, which requires the momenta of the photons involved in the\nprocesses to be conserved. Conventionally, nonlinear phase matching is achieved\nusing either birefringent or periodically poled nonlinear crystals, which\nrequires careful dispersion engineering and are usually narrowband. In recent\nyears, metasurfaces consisting of densely packed arrays of optical antennas\nhave been demonstrated to provide an effective optical momentum to bend light\nin arbitrary ways. Here, we demonstrate that gradient metasurface structures\nconsisting of phased array antennas are able to circumvent the phase-matching\nrequirement in on-chip nonlinear wavelength conversion. We experimentally\ndemonstrate phase-matching-free second harmonic generation over many coherent\nlengths in thin film lithium niobate waveguides patterned with the gradient\nmetasurfaces. Efficient second-harmonic generation (1660% W-1cm-2) in the\nmetasurface-based devices was observed over a wide range of pump wavelengths\n(1580-1650 nm).\n", "  In the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI), oscillation data\nare affected by a degeneracy which allows the solar mixing angle to be in the\nsecond octant (aka the dark side) and implies a sign flip of the atmospheric\nmass-squared difference. This leads to an ambiguity in the determination of the\nordering of neutrino masses, one of the main goals of the current and future\nexperimental neutrino program. We show that the recent observation of coherent\nneutrino--nucleus scattering by the COHERENT experiment, in combination with\nglobal oscillation data, excludes the NSI degeneracy at the $3.1\\sigma$\n($3.6\\sigma$) CL for NSI with up (down) quarks.\n", "  Galaxy systems with large magnitude gaps - defined as the difference in\nmagnitude between the central galaxy and the brightest satellite in the central\nregion - have been claimed to have earlier formation histories. In this study\nwe measure the mass concentration, as an indicator of early formation, of\nensembles of galaxy systems divided by redshift and magnitude gaps in the $r$\nband. We use cross-correlation weak lensing measurements with NFW parametric\nmass profiles to measure masses and concentrations of these ensembles from a\ncatalogue of systems built from the SDSS Coadd by the redMaPPer algorithm. The\nlensing shear data come from the CFHT Stripe 82 (CS82) survey, and consists of\n$i$-band images of the SDSS Stripe 82 region. We find that the stack made up of\nsystems with larger magnitude gaps has a high probability of being more\nconcentrated on average, in the lowest redshift slice ($0.2<z<0.4$), both when\ndividing in quartiles ($P=0.98$) and terciles ($P=0.85$). These results lend\ncredibility to the claim that the magnitude gap is an indicator of earlier\nformed systems.\n", "  Supermassive blackholes with masses of a billion solar masses or more are\nknown to exist up to $z=7$. However, the present-day environments of the\ndescendants of first quasars is not well understood and it is not known if they\nlive in massive galaxy clusters or more isolated galaxies at $z=0$. We use a\ndark matter-only realization (BTMassTracer) of the BlueTides cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulation to study the halo properties of the descendants of the\nmost massive black holes at $z=8$. We find that the descendants of the quasars\nwith most massive black holes are not amongst the most massive halos. They\nreside in halos of with group-like ($\\sim 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$) masses, while the\nmost massive halos in the simulations are rich clusters with masses $\\sim\n10^{15} M_{\\odot}$. The distribution of halo masses at low redshift is similar\nto that of the descendants of least massive black holes, for a similar range of\nhalo masses at $z=8$, which indicates that they are likely to exist in similar\nenvironments. By tracing back to the $z = 8$ progenitors of the most massive\n(cluster sized) halos at $z=0$; we find that their most likely black hole mass\nis less than $10^7 M_{\\odot}$; they are clearly not amongst the most massive\nblack holes. We also provide estimates for the likelihood of finding a high\nredshift quasar hosting a black hole with masses above $10^{7} M_{\\odot}$ for a\ngiven halo mass at $z=0$. For halos above $10^{15} M_{\\odot}$, there is only\n$20 \\%$ probability that their $z=8$ progenitors hosted a black hole with mass\nabove $10^{7} M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We present an analytical waveform family describing gravitational waves (GWs)\nfrom the inspiral, merger and ringdown of non-spinning black-hole binaries\nincluding the effect of several non-quadrupole modes [($\\ell = 2, m = \\pm 1),\n(\\ell = 3, m = \\pm 3), (\\ell = 4, m = \\pm 4)$ apart from $(\\ell = 2, m=\\pm2)$].\nWe first construct spin-weighted spherical harmonics modes of hybrid waveforms\nby matching numerical-relativity simulations (with mass ratio $1-10$)\ndescribing the late inspiral, merger and ringdown of the binary with\npost-Newtonian/effective-one-body waveforms describing the early inspiral. An\nanalytical waveform family is constructed in frequency domain by modeling the\nFourier transform of the hybrid waveforms making use of analytical functions\ninspired by perturbative calculations. The resulting highly accurate,\nready-to-use waveforms are highly faithful (unfaithfulness $\\simeq 10^{-4} -\n10^{-2}$) for observation of GWs from non-spinning black hole binaries and are\nextremely inexpensive to generate.\n", "  Segregated impurities at grain boundaries can dramatically change the\nmechanical behavior of metals, while the mechanism is still obscure in some\ncases. Here, we suggest an unified approach to investigate segregation and its\neffects on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline alloys using the\nexample of 3$sp$ impurities (Mg, Al, Si, P, or S) at a special type $\\Sigma\n5(310)[001]$ tilt grain boundary in Cu. We show that for these impurities\nsegregating to the grain boundary the strain contribution to the work of grain\nboundary decohesion is small and that the chemical contribution correlates with\nthe electronegativity difference between Cu and the impurity. The strain\ncontribution to the work of dislocation emission is calculated to be negative,\nwhile the chemical contribution to be always positive. Both the strain and\nchemical contributions to the work of dislocation emission generally become\nweaker with the increasing electronegativity from Mg to S. By combining these\ncontributions together we find, in agreement with experimental observations,\nthat a strong segregation of S can reduce the work of grain boundary separation\nbelow the work of dislocation emission, thus embrittling Cu, while such an\nembrittlement cannot be produced by a P segregation because it lowers the\nenergy barrier for dislocation emission relatively more than for work\nseparation.\n", "  Second-order topological insulators are crystalline insulators with a gapped\nbulk and gapped crystalline boundaries, but topologically protected gapless\nstates at the intersection of two boundaries. Without further spatial\nsymmetries, five of the ten Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes allow for the\nexistence of such second-order topological insulators in two and three\ndimensions. We show that reflection symmetry can be employed to systematically\ngenerate examples of second-order topological insulators and superconductors,\nalthough the topologically protected states at corners (in two dimensions) or\nat crystal edges (in three dimensions) continue to exist if reflection symmetry\nis broken. A three-dimensional second-order topological insulator with broken\ntime-reversal symmetry shows a Hall conductance quantized in units of $e^2/h$.\n", "  We extend the theory of dipole moments in crystalline insulators to higher\nmultipole moments. In this paper, we expand in great detail the theory\npresented in Ref. 1, and extend it to cover associated topological pumping\nphenomena, and a novel class of 3D insulator with chiral hinge states. In\nquantum-mechanical crystalline insulators, higher multipole bulk moments\nmanifest themselves by the presence of boundary-localized moments of lower\ndimension, in exact correspondence with the electromagnetic theory of classical\ncontinuous dielectrics. In the presence of certain symmetries, these moments\nare quantized, and their boundary signatures are fractionalized. These\nmultipole moments then correspond to new SPT phases. The topological structure\nof these phases is described by \"nested\" Wilson loops, which reflect the\nbulk-boundary correspondence in a way that makes evident a hierarchical\nclassification of the multipole moments. Just as a varying dipole generates\ncharge pumping, a varying quadrupole generates dipole pumping, and a varying\noctupole generates quadrupole pumping. For non-trivial adiabatic cycles, the\ntransport of these moments is quantized. An analysis of these interconnected\nphenomena leads to the conclusion that a new kind of Chern-type insulator\nexists, which has chiral, hinge-localized modes in 3D. We provide the minimal\nmodels for the quantized multipole moments, the non-trivial pumping processes\nand the hinge Chern insulator, and describe the topological invariants that\nprotect them.\n", "  A novel, unexplored nonperturbative deep-strong coupling (npDSC) achieved in\nsuperconducting circuits has been studied in the anisotropic Rabi model by the\ngeneralized squeezing rotating-wave approximation (GSRWA). Energy levels are\nevaluated analytically from the reformulated Hamiltonian and agree well with\nnumerical ones under a wide range of coupling strength. Such improvement\nascribes to deformation effects in the displaced-squeezed state presented by\nthe squeezed momentum variance, which are omitted in the previous displaced\nstate. The population dynamics confirm the validity of our approach for the\nnpDSC strength. Our approach paves a way to the exploration of analysis in\nqubit-oscillator experiments for the npDSC strength by the displaced-squeezed\nstate.\n", "  Narrow resonances decaying into $WW$, $WZ$ or $ZZ$ boson pairs are searched\nfor in 36.7 fb $^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large\nHadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The diboson system is reconstructed using\npairs of large-radius jets with high transverse momentum and tagged as\ncompatible with the hadronic decay of high-momentum $W$ or $Z$ bosons, using\njet mass and substructure properties. The search is sensitive to diboson\nresonances with masses in the range 1.2-5.0 TeV. No significant excess is\nobserved in any signal region. Exclusion limits are set at the 95% confidence\nlevel on the production cross section times branching ratio to dibosons for a\nrange of theories beyond the Standard Model. Model-dependent lower limits on\nthe mass of new gauge bosons are set, with the highest limit set at 3.5 TeV in\nthe context of mass-degenerate resonances that couple predominantly to bosons.\n", "  In search of new prospects for thermoelectric materials, using ab-initio\ncalculations and semi-classical Boltzmann theory, we have systematically\ninvestigated the electronic structure and transport properties of 18-valence\nelectron count cobalt based half-Heusler alloys with prime focus on CoVSn,\nCoNbSn, CoTaSn, CoMoIn, and CoWIn. The effect of doping on transport properties\nhas been studied under the rigid band approximation. The maximum power factor,\nS$^2\\sigma$, for all systems is obtained on hole doping and is comparable to\nthe existing thermoelectric material CoTiSb. The stability of all the systems\nis verified by phonon calculations. Based on our calculations, we suggest that\nCoVSn, CoNbSn, CoTaSn, CoMoIn and CoWIn could be potential candidates for high\ntemperature thermoelectric materials.\n", "  Template directed replication of nucleic acids is at the essence of all\nliving beings and a major milestone for any origin of life scenario. We here\npresent an idealized model of prebiotic sequence replication, where binary\npolymers act as templates for their autocatalytic replication, thereby serving\nas each others reactants and products in an intertwined molecular ecology. Our\nmodel demonstrates how autocatalysis alters the qualitative and quantitative\nsystem dynamics in counter-intuitive ways. Most notably, numerical simulations\nreveal a very strong intrinsic selection mechanism that favours the appearance\nof a few population structures with highly ordered and repetitive sequence\npatterns when starting from a pool of monomers. We demonstrate both\nanalytically and through simulation how this \"selection of the dullest\" is\ncaused by continued symmetry breaking through random fluctuations in the\ntransient dynamics that are amplified by autocatalysis and eventually propagate\nto the population level. The impact of these observations on related prebiotic\nmathematical models is discussed.\n", "  Recent magnetoconductance measurements performed on magnetic topological\ninsulator candidates have revealed butterfly-shaped hysteresis. This hysteresis\nhas been attributed to the formation of gapless chiral domain-wall bound states\nduring a magnetic field sweep. We treat this phenomenon theoretically,\nproviding a link between microscopic magnetization dynamics and butterfly\nhysteresis in magnetoconductance. Further, we illustrate how a spatially\nresolved conductance measurement can probe the most striking feature of the\ndomain-wall bound states: their chirality. This work establishes a regime where\na definitive link between butterfly hysteresis in longitudinal\nmagneto-conductance and domain-wall bound states can be made. This analysis\nprovides an important tool for the identification of magnetic topological\ninsulators.\n", "  We report on a laser locked to a silicon cavity operating continuously at 4 K\nwith $1 \\times 10^{-16}$ instability and a median linewidth of 17 mHz at 1542\nnm. This is a ten-fold improvement in short-term instability, and a $10^4$\nimprovement in linewidth, over previous sub-10 K systems. Operating at low\ntemperatures reduces the thermal noise floor, and thus is advantageous toward\nreaching an instability of $10^{-18}$, a long-sought goal of the optical clock\ncommunity. The performance of this system demonstrates the technical readiness\nfor the development of the next generation of ultrastable lasers that operate\nwith ultranarrow linewidth and long-term stability without user intervention.\n", "  The ubiquity of Lyman alpha (Ly$\\alpha$) emission in a sample of four bright\n[O III]-strong star-forming galaxies with redshifts above 7 has led to the\nsuggestion that such luminous sources represent a distinct population compared\nto their fainter, more numerous, counterparts. The presence of Ly$\\alpha$\nemission within the reionization era could indicate that these sources created\nearly ionized bubbles due to their unusually strong radiation, possibly due to\nthe presence of active galactic nuclei. To test this hypothesis we have secured\nlong integration spectra with XSHOOTER on the VLT for three $z\\simeq$7 sources\nselected to have similar luminosities and prominent excess fluxes in the IRAC\n3.6 or 4.5$\\mu$m band, usually attributed to strong [O III] emission. We\nsecured additional spectroscopy for one of these galaxies at $z$=7.15 using\nMOSFIRE at the Keck telescope. For this, the most well-studied source in our\nsample with the strongest IRAC excess, we detect prominent nebular emission\nfrom He II and NV indicative of a non-thermal source. For the other two sources\nat $z$=6.81 and $z$=6.85, for which no previous optical/near infrared\nspectroscopy was initially available, Ly$\\alpha$ is seen in one and CIII]\nemission in the other. Although a modest sample, our results further support\nthe hypothesis that the phenomenon of intense [O III] emission is associated\npreferentially with sources lying in early ionized bubbles. However, even\nthough one of our sources at $z$=7.15 clearly indicates the presence of\nnon-thermal radiation, such ionized bubbles may not uniquely arise in this\nmanner. We discuss the unique advantages of extending such challenging\ndiagnostic studies with JWST.\n", "  We present the prospects for photoassociation, optical control of\ninterspecies scattering lengths and finally, the production of ultracold\nabsolute ground state molecules in the Rb+Hg system. We use the \"gold standard\"\nab initio methods for the calculations of ground (CCSD(T)) and excited state\n(EOM-CCSD) potential curves. The RbHg system, thanks to the wide range of\nstable Hg bosonic isotopes, offers possibilities for mass-tuning of ground\nstate interactions. The optical lengths describing the strengths of optical\nFeshbach resonances near the Rb transitions are favorable even at large laser\ndetunings. Ground state RbHg molecules can be produced with efficiencies\nranging from about 20% for deeply bound to at least 50% for weakly bound states\nclose to the dissociation limit. Finally, electronic transitions with favorable\nFranck-Condon factors can be found for the purposes of a STIRAP transfer of the\nweakly bound RbHg molecules to the absolute ground state using commercially\navailable lasers.\n", "  We consider the transport of conserved charges in spatially inhomogeneous\nquantum systems with a discrete lattice symmetry. We analyse the retarded two\npoint functions involving the charge and the associated currents at long\nwavelengths, compared to the scale of the lattice, and, when the DC\nconductivity is finite, extract the hydrodynamic modes associated with charge\ndiffusion. We show that the dispersion relations of these modes are related to\nthe eigenvalues of a specific matrix constructed from the DC conductivity and\ncertain thermodynamic susceptibilities, thus obtaining generalised Einstein\nrelations. We illustrate these general results in the specific context of\nrelativistic hydrodynamics where translation invariance is broken using\nspatially inhomogeneous and periodic deformations of the stress tensor and the\nconserved $U(1)$ currents. Equivalently, this corresponds to considering\nhydrodynamics on a curved manifold, with a spatially periodic metric and\nchemical potential.\n", "  Oscillation modes of isolated compact stars can, in principle, be a\nfingerprint of the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. We study the\nnon-radial high-frequency l=2 spheroidal modes of neutron stars and strange\nquark stars, adopting a two-component model (core and crust) for these two\ntypes of stars. Using perturbed fluid equations in the relativistic Cowling\napproximation, we explore the effect of a strangelet or hadronic crust on the\noscillation modes of strange stars. The results differ from the case of neutron\nstars with a crust. In comparison to fluid-only configurations, we find that a\nsolid crust on top of a neutron star increases the p-mode frequency slightly\nwith little effect on the f-mode frequency, whereas for strange stars, a\nstrangelet crust on top of a quark core significantly increases the f-mode\nfrequency with little effect on the p-mode frequency.\n", "  The Boulby Underground Germanium Suite (BUGS) comprises three low background,\nhigh-purity germanium detectors operating in the Boulby Underground Laboratory,\nlocated 1.1 km underground in the north-east of England, UK. BUGS utilises\nthree types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput\nradioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search\nexperiments. A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to\nlow-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th. A Small Anode\nGermanium (SAGe) well-type detector is employed for efficient screening of\nsmall samples. Finally, a standard p-type coaxial detector provides fast\nscreening of standard samples. This paper presents the steps used to\ncharacterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample\ngeometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing\neffects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain. In denser\nmaterials, where gamma-ray self-absorption increases, sensitivity is\ndemonstrated to specific activities of 0.9 mBq/kg for 226Ra, 1.1 mBq/kg for 228\nRa, 0.3 mBq/kg for 224Ra, and 8.6 mBq/kg for 40K with all upper limits at a 90%\nconfidence level. These meet the requirements of most screening campaigns\npresently under way for rare-event search experiments, such as the LUX-ZEPLIN\n(LZ) dark matter experiment. We also highlight the ability of the BEGe detector\nto probe the X-ray fluorescence region which can be important to identify the\npresence of radioisotopes associated with neutron production; this is of\nparticular relevance in experiments sensitive to nuclear recoils.\n", "  In this work, we demonstrate a new way to perform classical multiparty\ncomputing amongst parties with limited computational resources. Our method\nharnesses quantum resources to increase the computational power of the\nindividual parties. We show how a set of clients restricted to linear classical\nprocessing are able to jointly compute a non-linear multivariable function that\nlies beyond their individual capabilities. The clients are only allowed to\nperform classical XOR gates and single-qubit gates on quantum states. We also\nexamine the type of security that can be achieved in this limited setting.\nFinally, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation using photonic qubits,\nthat allows four clients to compute a specific example of a multiparty\nfunction, the pairwise AND.\n", "  We study a frustrated spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\n$J_{1}$--$J_{2}$--$J_{3}$--$J_{1}^{\\perp}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on an\n$AA$-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice. In each layer we consider\nnearest-neighbor (NN), next-nearest-neighbor, and next-next-nearest-neighbor\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange couplings $J_{1}$, $J_{2}$, and $J_{3}$,\nrespectively. The two layers are coupled with an AFM NN exchange coupling\n$J_{1}^{\\perp}\\equiv\\delta J_{1}$. The model is studied for arbitrary values of\n$\\delta$ along the line $J_{3}=J_{2}\\equiv\\alpha J_{1}$ that includes the most\nhighly frustrated point at $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$, where the classical ground\nstate is macroscopically degenerate. The coupled cluster method is used at high\norders of approximation to calculate the magnetic order parameter and the\ntriplet spin gap. We are thereby able to give an accurate description of the\nquantum phase diagram of the model in the $\\alpha\\delta$ plane in the window $0\n\\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$, $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 1$. This includes two AFM phases with\nN\\'eel and striped order, and an intermediate gapped paramagnetic phase that\nexhibits various forms of valence-bond crystalline order. We obtain accurate\nestimations of the two phase boundaries, $\\delta = \\delta_{c_{i}}(\\alpha)$, or\nequivalently, $\\alpha = \\alpha_{c_{i}}(\\delta)$, with $i=1$ (N\\'eel) and 2\n(striped). The two boundaries exhibit an \"avoided crossing\" behavior with both\ncurves being reentrant.\n", "  Deep optical imaging with both Hyper Suprime-Cam and Suprime-Cam on the 8.2 m\nSubaru Telescope reveals a number of outer faint structures around the\narchetypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 (M 77). We find three ultra diffuse\nobjects (UDOs) around NGC 1068. Since these UDOs are located within the\nprojected distance of 45 kpc from the center of NGC 1068, they appear to be\nassociated with NGC 1068. Hereafter, we call them UDO-SW, UDO-NE, and UDO-SE\nwhere UDO = Ultra Diffuse Object, SW = south west, NE = north west, and SE =\nsouth east; note that UDO-SE was already found in the SDSS Stripe 82 data.\nAmong them, both UDO-NE and UDO-SW appear to show a loop or stream structure\naround the main body of NGC 1068, providing evidence for the physical\nconnection to NGC 1068. We consider that UDO-SE may be a tidal dwarf galaxy. We\nalso find another UDO-like object that is 2 magnitudes fainter and smaller by a\nfactor of 3 to 5 than those of the three UDOs. This object may belong to a\nclass of low surface brightness galaxy. Since this object is located along the\nline connecting UDO-NE and UDO-SW, it is suggested that this object is related\nto the past interaction event that formed the loop by UDO-NE and UDO-SW, thus\nimplying the physical connection to NGC 1068. Another newly-discovered feature\nis an asymmetric outer one-arm structure emanated from the western edge of the\noutermost disk of NGC 1068 together with a ripple-like structure at the\nopposite side. These structures are expected to arise in a late phase of a\nminor merger according to published numerical simulations of minor mergers. All\nthese lines of evidence show that NGC 1068 experienced a minor merger several\nbillions years ago. We then discuss the minor-merger driven triggering of\nnuclear activity in the case of NGC 1068.\n", "  In asteroid rendezvous missions, the dynamical environment near the\nasteroid's surface should be made clear prior to the mission launch. However,\nmost of the asteroids have irregular shapes, which lower the efficiency of\ncalculating their gravitational field by adopting the traditional polyhedral\nmethod. In this work, we propose a method to partition the space near the\nasteroid adaptively along three spherical coordinates and use Chebyshev\npolynomials interpolation to represent the gravitational acceleration in each\ncell. Moreover, we compare four different interpolation schemes to obtain the\nbest precision with the identical initial parameters. An error-adaptive octree\ndivision is combined to improve the interpolation precision near the surface.\nAs an example, we take the typical irregular-shaped near-Earth asteroid 4179\nToutatis to show the advantage of this method, as a result, we show that the\nefficiency can be increased by hundreds to thousands times with our method. In\na word, this method can be applicable to other irregular-shaped asteroids and\ncan greatly improve the evaluation efficiency.\n", "  Through the integration of the power spectral density, we obtain temperature\nprofiles of both multi-segment harmonic and anharmonic systems, showing the\npresence of an anomalous negative temperature gradient inside the interfacial\nsegment. Via investigating patterns of the power spectral density, we found\nthat the counterintuitive phenomenon comes from the presence of interfacial\nlocalized phonon modes. Two out-band localized modes of the harmonic model,\nwhich make no contributions to local temperature due to the absence of phonon\ninteractions, result in the concave temperature profile and over-cooling\neffect. For the anharmonic model, thanks to the phonon-phonon interactions, the\nlocalized modes are excited and make considerable contributions to interfacial\ntemperature, which is clearly shown by examining the temperature accumulation\nfunction. When anharmonicity is considerably large, the negative temperature\ngradient is absent since the localized phonon modes are fully mixed. The\npresence of localized modes are evidently demonstrated by the inverse\nparticipation ratio and normal mode analysis for the isolated harmonic model.\n", "  We compute the running of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in\nString Gas Cosmology, making use of a smooth parametrization of the transition\nbetween the early Hagedorn phase and the later radiation phase. We find that\nthe running has the same sign as in simple models of single scalar field\ninflation. Its magnitude is proportional to $(1 - n_s)$ ($n_s$ being the slope\nindex of the spectrum), and it is thus parametrically larger than for\ninflationary cosmology, where it is proportional to $(1 - n_s)^2$.\n", "  We investigate the interplay between the (light-light quark) chiral\ncondensate and heavy-light quark condensate induced by the QCD Kondo effect,\nwhich is described by an effective Lagrangian with four-point interactions and\nthe mean-field approximation. We find that the appearance of Kondo condensates\ndecreases the critical chemical potential of the chiral condensate. In the\nregion near the critical chemical potential, a coexistence phase with two kinds\nof condensates can appear. The behavior of such an interplay at finite\ntemperature and with nonzero current light-quark mass is also discussed.\n", "  We present the results of Suzaku and Chandra observations of the galaxy\ncluster RXC J1053.7+5453 ($z=0.0704$), which contains a radio relic. The radio\nrelic is located at the distance of $\\sim 540$ kpc from the X-ray peak toward\nthe west. We measured the temperature of this cluster for the first time. The\nresultant temperature in the center is $ \\sim 1.3$ keV, which is lower than the\nvalue expected from the X-ray luminosity - temperature and the velocity\ndispersion - temperature relation. Though we did not find a significant\ntemperature jump at the outer edge of the relic, our results suggest that the\ntemperature decreases outward across the relic. Assuming the existence of the\nshock at the relic, its Mach number becomes $M \\simeq 1.4 $. A possible spatial\nvariation of Mach number along the relic is suggested. Additionally, a sharp\nsurface brightness edge is found at the distance of $\\sim 160$ kpc from the\nX-ray peak toward the west in the Chandra image. We performed X-ray spectral\nand surface brightness analyses around the edge with Suzaku and Chandra data,\nrespectively. The obtained surface brightness and temperature profiles suggest\nthat this edge is not a shock but likely a cold front. Alternatively, it cannot\nbe ruled out that thermal pressure is really discontinuous across the edge. In\nthis case, if the pressure across the surface brightness edge is in\nequilibrium, other forms of pressure sources, such as cosmic-rays, are\nnecessary. We searched for the non-thermal inverse Compton component in the\nrelic region. Assuming the photon index $ \\Gamma = 2.0$, the resultant upper\nlimit of the flux is $1.9 \\times 10^{-14} {\\rm erg \\ s^{-1} \\ cm^{-2}}$ for\n$4.50 \\times 10^{-3} {\\rm \\ deg^{2}}$ area in the 0.3-10 keV band, which\nimplies that the lower limit of magnetic field strength becomes $ 0.7 {\\rm \\\n\\mu G}$.\n", "  Spin-memory loss (SML) of electrons traversing\nferromagnetic-metal/heavy-metal (FM/HM), FM/normal-metal (FM/NM) and HM/NM\ninterfaces is a fundamental phenomenon that must be invoked to explain\nconsistently large number of spintronic experiments. However, its strength\nextracted by fitting experimental data to phenomenological semiclassical\ntheory, which replaces each interface by a fictitious bulk diffusive layer, is\npoorly understood from a microscopic quantum framework and/or materials\nproperties. Here we describe an ensemble of flowing spin quantum states using\nspin-density matrix, so that SML is measured like any decoherence process by\nthe decay of its off-diagonal elements or, equivalently, by the reduction of\nthe magnitude of polarization vector. By combining this framework with density\nfunctional theory (DFT), we examine how all three components of the\npolarization vector change at Co/Ta, Co/Pt, Co/Cu, Pt/Cu and Pt/Au interfaces\nembedded within Cu/FM/HM/Cu vertical heterostructures. In addition, we use ab\ninitio Green's functions to compute spectral functions and spin textures over\nFM, HM and NM monolayers around these interfaces which quantify interfacial\nspin-orbit coupling and explain the microscopic origin of SML in long-standing\npuzzles, such as why it is nonzero at Co/Cu interface; why it is very large at\nPt/Cu interface; and why it occurs even in the absence of disorder, intermixing\nand magnons at the interface.\n", "  For the first time a principle-component analysis is used to separate out\ndifferent orthogonal modes of the two-particle correlation matrix from heavy\nion collisions. The analysis uses data from sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV PbPb and\nsqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV pPb collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the\nLHC. Two-particle azimuthal correlations have been extensively used to study\nhydrodynamic flow in heavy ion collisions. Recently it has been shown that the\nexpected factorization of two-particle results into a product of the\nconstituent single-particle anisotropies is broken. The new information\nprovided by these modes may shed light on the breakdown of flow factorization\nin heavy ion collisions. The first two modes (\"leading\" and \"subleading\") of\ntwo-particle correlations are presented for elliptical and triangular\nanisotropies in PbPb and pPb collisions as a function of pt over a wide range\nof event activity. The leading mode is found to be essentially equivalent to\nthe anisotropy harmonic previously extracted from two-particle correlation\nmethods. The subleading mode represents a new experimental observable and is\nshown to account for a large fraction of the factorization breaking recently\nobserved at high transverse momentum. The principle-component analysis\ntechnique has also been applied to multiplicity fluctuations. These also show a\nsubleading mode. The connection of these new results to previous studies of\nfactorization is discussed.\n", "  We compute the gravitational leptogenesis generated from the parity-violating\ngravitational waves sourced by an abelian gauge field coupled to a\npseudo-scalar inflation. We show that, once the CMB bound on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is enforced, the lepton asymmetry produced by this\nmechanism during inflation is too small to account for the observed baryon\nasymmetry of the universe, irrespectively of the inflaton potential, the\nstrength of its coupling to the gauge field, and the details of reheating.\n", "  The compression property of regolith reflects the strength and porosity of\nthe regolith layer on small bodies and their variations in the layer that\nlargely influence the collisional and thermal evolution of the bodies. We\nconducted compression experiments and investigated the relationship between the\nporosity and the compression using fluffy granular samples. We focused on a\nlow-pressure and high-porosity regime. We used tens of {\\mu}m-sized irregular\nand spherical powders as analogs of porous regolith. The initial porosity of\nthe samples ranged from 0.80 to 0.53. The uniaxial pressure applied to the\nsamples lays in the range from 30 to 4x10^5 Pa. The porosity of the samples\nremained at their initial values below a threshold pressure and then decreased\nwhen the pressure exceeded the threshold. We defined this uniaxial pressure at\nthe threshold as \"yield strength\". The yield strength increased as the initial\nporosity of a sample decreased. The yield strengths of samples consisting of\nirregular particles did not significantly depend on their size distributions\nwhen the samples had the same initial porosity. We compared the results of our\nexperiments with a previously proposed theoretical model. We calculated the\naverage interparticle force acting on contact points of constituent particles\nunder the uniaxial pressure of yield strength using the theoretical model and\ncompared it with theoretically estimated forces required to roll or slide the\nparticles. The calculated interparticle force was larger than the rolling\nfriction force and smaller than the sliding friction force. The yield strength\nof regolith may be constrained by these forces. Our results may be useful for\nplanetary scientists to estimate the depth above which the porosity of a\nregolith layer is almost equal to that of the regolith surface and to interpret\nthe compression property of an asteroid surface obtained by a lander.\n", "  We argue that comparison with observations of theoretical models for the\nvelocity distribution of pulsars must be done directly with the observed\nquantities, i.e. parallax and the two components of proper motion. We develop a\nformalism to do so, and apply it to pulsars with accurate VLBI measurements. We\nfind that a distribution with two maxwellians improves significantly on a\nsingle maxwellian. The `mixed' model takes into account that pulsars move away\nfrom their place of birth, a narrow region around the galactic plane. The best\nmodel has 42% of the pulsars in a maxwellian with average velocity sigma\nsqrt{8/pi}=120 km/s, and 58% in a maxwellian with average velocity 540 km/s.\nAbout 5% of the pulsars has a velocity at birth less than 60\\,km/s. For the\nyoungest pulsars (tau_c<10 Myr), these numbers are 32% with 130 km/s, 68% with\n520 km/s, and 3%, with appreciable uncertainties.\n", "  The vector leptoquark representation, $U_\\mu = (3,1,2/3)$, was recently\nidentified as an exceptional single mediator model to address experimental\nhints on lepton flavour universality violation in semileptonic $B$-meson\ndecays, both in neutral ($b \\to s \\mu \\mu$) and charged ($b \\to c \\tau \\nu$)\ncurrent processes. Nonetheless, it is well-known that massive vectors crave an\nultraviolet (UV) completion. We present the first full-fledged UV complete and\ncalculable gauge model which incorporates this scenario while remaining in\nagreement with all other indirect flavour and electroweak precision\nmeasurements, as well as, direct searches at high-$p_T$. The model is based on\na new non-abelian gauge group spontaneously broken at the TeV scale, and a\nspecific flavour structure suppressing flavour violation in $\\Delta F = 2$\nprocesses while inducing sizeable semileptonic transitions.\n", "  A search is presented for narrow heavy resonances decaying to a top quark and\na bottom quark using data collected by the CMS experiment at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV\nin 2016. The data set analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\ninverse femtobarns. Final states that include a single lepton (e, mu), multiple\njets, and missing transverse momentum are analyzed. No evidence is found for\nthe production of a W' boson, and the production of right-handed W' bosons is\nexcluded at 95% confidence level for masses up to 3.6 TeV depending on the\nscenario considered. Exclusion limits for W' bosons are also presented as a\nfunction of their coupling strength to left- and right-handed fermions. These\nlimits on a W' boson decaying via a top and a bottom quark are the most\nstringent published to date.\n", "  We study Dirac fermionic dark matter (DM, $\\chi^0$) and confront it with\nrecent data. To evade the stringent direct search limits from PandaX-II,\nXENON1T and LUX experiments, the quantum numbers of the Dirac DM are taken to\nbe $I_3=Y=0$ to remove the tree-level $Z$-exchange diagram. Loop amplitudes can\ncontribute to the elastic scattering cross section. We find that there are\ncancellations in the one-loop diagrams, which largely reduce the cross section\nand make the Dirac DM viable in the direct search. For a generic isospin $I$,\nwe survey the Dirac DM mass constrained by the latest results of PandaX-II,\nXENON1T and LUX experiments, the observed DM relic density, and the H.E.S.S.\nand the Fermi-LAT astrophysical observations. Sommerfeld enhancement effects on\nDM annihilation processes are investigated. We find that the cross section of\n$\\chi^0\\bar\\chi^0$ annihilating to the standard model (SM) gauge bosons are in\ngeneral significantly enhanced, and the Fermi-LAT, the H.E.S.S. upper limits on\n$\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle({W^+W^-,\\gamma\\gamma})$ and the observed relic density\nbecome serious constraints on the Dirac DM mass. The $I<4$ cases are ruled out\nand for $I\\geq 4$, the lower bound on Dirac DM mass are forced to be $\\gtrsim$\n60 TeV. The elastic scattering cross section for $m_\\chi$ of few tens TeV with\na generic $I$ is found to be $\\sigma^{SI}\\simeq\nI^2(I+1)^2\\times7\\times10^{-49}$~cm$^2$. The predicted $\\langle\\sigma\n(\\chi^0\\bar\\chi^0\\to Z^0Z^0, Z^0\\gamma, \\gamma\\gamma)v\\rangle$ and\n$\\sigma^{SI}$ are sizable and they will be useful to search for DM in\nastrophysical observation and in direct search in near future.\n", "  We study the realization of anyon-permuting symmetries of topological phases\non the lattice using tensor networks. Working on the virtual level of a\nprojected entangled pair state, we find matrix product operators (MPOs) that\nrealize all unitary topological symmetries for the toric and color codes. These\noperators act as domain walls that enact the symmetry transformation on anyons\nas they cross. By considering open boundary conditions for these domain wall\nMPOs, we show how to introduce symmetry twists and defect lines into the state.\n", "  We present numerical measurements of the power spectrum response function of\nthe gravitational growth of cosmic structures, defined as the functional\nderivative of the nonlinear spectrum with respect to the linear counterpart,\nbased on $1,400$ cosmological simulations. We develop a simple analytical model\nbased on a regularization of the standard perturbative calculation. Using the\nmodel prediction, we show that this function gives a natural way to interpolate\nthe nonlinear power spectrum over cosmological parameter space from single or\nmulti-step interpolations. We demonstrate that once an accurate numerical\nspectrum template is available for one (or a small number of) cosmological\nmodel(s), it doubles the range in $k$ for which percent level accuracy can be\nobtained even for large change in the cosmological parameters. The python\npackage RESPRESSO we developed to make those predictions is publicly available.\n", "  We examine the top squark (stop) and gluino reach of the proposed 33 TeV\nenergy upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC33) in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with light higgsinos and relatively heavy\nelectroweak gauginos. In our analysis, we assume that stops decay to higgsinos\nvia ${\\tilde t}_1 \\to t {\\tilde{Z}}_1$, $\\tilde{t}_1 \\to t\\tilde{Z}_2$ and\n$\\tilde{t}$$_1 \\to b\\tilde{W}_1$ with branching fractions in the ratio 1:1:2\n(expected if the decay occurs dominantly via the superpotential Yukawa\ncoupling) while gluinos decay via $\\tilde{g}\\to t\\tilde{t}_1$ or via three-body\ndecays to third generation quarks plus higgsinos. These decay patterns are\nmotivated by models of natural supersymmetry where higgsinos are expected to be\nclose in mass to $m_Z$, but gluinos may be as heavy as $5 - 6$ TeV and stops\nmay have masses up to $\\sim 3 $ TeV. We devise cuts to optimize the signals\nfrom stop and gluino pair production at LHC33. We find that experiments at\nLHC33 should be able to discover stops with $> 5\\sigma$ significance if\n$m_{\\tilde{t}_1} < 2.3 \\ (2.8) \\ [3.2]$ TeV for an integrated luminosity of 0.3\n(1)[3] ab$^{-1}$. The corresponding reach for gluinos extends to 5 (5.5) [6]\nTeV. These results imply that experiments at LHC33 should be able to discover\nat least one of the stop or gluino pair signals even with an integrated\nluminosity of 0.3 ab$^{-1}$ for natural SUSY models with no worse than 3%\nelectroweak fine-tuning, and quite likely both gluinos and stops for an\nintegrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$.\n", "  The results of Suzaku observations of the outskirts of Abell 3395 including a\nlarge-scale structure filament toward Abell 3391 are presented. We measured\ntemperature and abundance distributions from the southern outskirt of Abell\n3395 to the north at the virial radius, where a filament structure has been\nfound in the former X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect observations between\nAbell 3391 and 3395. The overall temperature structure is consistent with the\nuniversal profile proposed by Okabe et al.(2014) for relaxed clusters except\nfor the filament region. A hint of the ICM heating is found between the two\nclusters, which might be due to the interaction of them in the early phase of a\ncluster merger. Although we obtained relatively low metal abundance of\n$Z=0.169^{+0.164+0.009+0.018 }_{-0.150-0.004-0.015 }$ solar, where the first,\nsecond, and third errors are statistical, cosmic X-ray background systematic,\nand non X-ray background systematic, respectively, at the virial radius in the\nfilament, our results are still consistent with the former results of other\nclusters ($Z \\sim 0.3$ solar) within errors. Therefore, our results are also\nconsistent with the early enrichment scenario. We estimated Compton $y$\nparameters only from X-ray results in the region between Abell 3391 and 3395\nassuming a simple geometry. They are smaller than the previous SZ results with\nPlanck satellite. The difference could be attributed to a more elaborate\ngeometry such as a filament inclined to the line-of-sight direction, or\nunderestimation of the X-ray temperature because of the unresolved\nmulti-temperature structures or undetected hot X-ray emission of the shock\nheated gas.\n", "  In recent years it was shown both theoretically and experimentally that in\ncertain systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion the time and ensemble average\nmean squared displacement are remarkably different. The ensemble average\ndiffusivity is obtained from a scaling Green-Kubo relation, which connects the\nscale invariant non-stationary velocity correlation function with the transport\ncoefficient. Here we obtain the relation between time averaged diffusivity,\nusually recorded in single particle tracking experiments, and the underlying\nscale invariant velocity correlation function. The time averaged mean squared\ndisplacement is given by $\\overline{\\delta^2} \\sim 2 D_\\nu\nt^{\\beta}\\Delta^{\\nu-\\beta}$ where $t$ is the total measurement time and\n$\\Delta$ the lag time. Here $\\nu>1$ is the anomalous diffusion exponent\nobtained from ensemble averaged measurements $\\langle x^2 \\rangle \\sim t^\\nu$\nwhile $\\beta\\ge -1$ marks the growth or decline of the kinetic energy $\\langle\nv^2 \\rangle \\sim t^\\beta$. Thus we establish a connection between exponents\nwhich can be read off the asymptotic properties of the velocity correlation\nfunction and similarly for the transport constant $D_\\nu$. We demonstrate our\nresults with non-stationary scale invariant stochastic and deterministic\nmodels, thereby highlighting that systems with equivalent behavior in the\nensemble average can differ strongly in their time average. This is the case,\nfor example, if averaged kinetic energy is finite, i.e. $\\beta=0$, where\n$\\langle \\overline{\\delta^2}\\rangle \\neq \\langle x^2\\rangle$.\n", "  To better understand the LBV phenomenon, we analyze multi-epoch and\nmulti-wavelength spectra and photometry of R71. Pre-outburst spectra are\nanalyzed with the radiative transfer code CMFGEN to determine the star's\nfundamental stellar parameters. During quiescence, R71 has an effective\ntemperature of $T_\\mathrm{{eff}} = 15\\,500~K$ and a luminosity of\nlog$(L_*/L_{\\odot})$ = 5.78 and is thus a classical LBV, but at the lower\nluminosity end of this group. We determine its mass-loss rate to $4.0 \\times\n10^{-6}~M_{\\odot}~$yr$^{-1}$. We present R71's spectral energy distribution\nfrom the near-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared during its present outburst.\nMid-infrared observations suggest that we are witnessing dust formation and\ngrain evolution. Semi-regular oscillatory variability in the star's light curve\nis observed during the current outburst. Absorption lines develop a second blue\ncomponent on a timescale twice that length. The variability may consist of one\n(quasi-)periodic component with P ~ 425/850 d with additional variations\nsuperimposed. During its current S Doradus outburst, R71 occupies a region in\nthe HR diagram at the high-luminosity extension of the Cepheid instability\nstrip and exhibits similar irregular variations as RV Tau variables. LBVs do\nnot pass the Cepheid instability strip because of core evolution, but they\ndevelop comparable cool, low-mass, extended atmospheres in which convective\ninstabilities may occur. As in the case of RV Tau variables, the occurrence of\ndouble absorption lines with an apparent regular cycle may be due to shocks\nwithin the atmosphere and period doubling may explain the factor of two in the\nlengths of the photometric and spectroscopic cycles.\n", "  Aims. Narrow-angle tailed (NAT) sources in clusters of galaxies can show on\nthe large scale very narrow tails that are unresolved even at arcsecond\nresolution. These sources could therefore be classified as one-sided jets. The\naim of this paper is to gain new insight into the structure of these sources,\nand establish whether they are genuine one-sided objects, or if they are\ntwo-sided sources. Methods. We observed a sample of apparently one-sided NAT\nsources at subarcsecond resolution to obtain detailed information on their\nstructure in the nuclear regions of radio galaxies. Results. Most radio\ngalaxies are found to show two-sided jets with sharp bends, and therefore the\nsources are similar to the more classical NATs, which are affected by strong\nprojection effects.\n", "  We investigate to what degree local physical and chemical conditions are\nrelated to the evolutionary status of various objects in star-forming media.\nrho Oph A displays the entire sequence of low-mass star formation in a small\nvolume of space. Using spectrophotometric line maps of H2, H2O, NH3, N2H+, O2,\nOI, CO, and CS, we examine the distribution of the atomic and molecular gas in\nthis dense molecular core. The physical parameters of these species are\nderived, as are their relative abundances in rho Oph A. Using radiative\ntransfer models, we examine the infall status of the cold dense cores from\ntheir resolved line profiles of the ground state lines of H2O and NH3, where\nfor the latter no contamination from the VLA 1623 outflow is observed and line\noverlap of the hyperfine components is explicitly taken into account. The\nstratified structure of this photon dominated region (PDR), seen edge-on, is\nclearly displayed. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and OI are seen\nthroughout the region around the exciting star S1. At the interface to the\nmolecular core 0.05 pc away, atomic hydrogen is rapidly converted into H2,\nwhereas OI protrudes further into the molecular core. This provides oxygen\natoms for the gas-phase formation of O2 in the core SM1, where X(O2)~ 5.e-8.\nThere, the ratio of the O2 to H2O abundance [X(H2O)~ 5.e-9] is significantly\nhigher than unity. Away from the core, O2 experiences a dramatic decrease due\nto increasing H2O formation. Outside the molecular core, on the far side as\nseen from S1, the intense radiation from the 0.5 pc distant early B-type star\nHD147889 destroys the molecules. Towards the dark core SM1, the observed\nabundance ratio X(O2)/X(H2O)>1, which suggests that this object is extremely\nyoung, which would explain why O2 is such an elusive molecule outside the solar\nsystem.\n", "  We propose a dissipative method for the preparation of many-body steady\nentangled states in spin and fermionic chains. The scheme is accomplished by\nmeans of an engineered set of Lindbladians acting over the eigenmodes of the\nsystem, whose spectrum is assumed to be resolvable. We apply this idea to\nprepare a particular entangled state of a spin chain described by the XY model,\nemphasizing its generality and experimental feasibility. Our results show that\nour proposal is capable of achieving high fidelities and purities for a given\ntarget state even when dephasing and thermal dissipative processes are taken\ninto account. Moreover, the method exhibits a remarkable robustness against\nfluctuations in the model parameters.\n", "  Hypervelocity ejection of material by impact spallation is considered a\nplausible mechanism for material exchange between two planetary bodies. We have\nmodeled the spallation process during vertical impacts over a range of impact\nvelocities from 6 to 21 km/s using both grid- and particle-based hydrocode\nmodels. The Tillotson equations of state, which are able to treat the nonlinear\ndependence of density on pressure and thermal pressure in the strongly shocked\nmatter, were used to study the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic response after\nimpacts. The effects of material strength and gravitational acceleration were\nnot considered. A two-dimensional time-dependent pressure field within a\n1.5-fold projectile radius from the impact point was investigated in\ncylindrical coordinates to address the generation of spalled material. A\nresolution test was also performed to reject ejected materials with peak\npressures that were too low due to artificial viscosity. The relationship\nbetween ejection velocity veject and peak pressure Ppeak was also derived. Our\napproach shows that late stage acceleration in an ejecta curtain occurs due to\nthe compressible nature of the ejecta, resulting in an ejection velocity that\ncan be higher than the ideal maximum of the resultant particle velocity after\npassage of a shock wave. We also calculate the ejecta mass that can escape from\na planet like Mars (i.e., veject higher than 5 km/s) that matches the\npetrographic constraints from Martian meteorites, and which occurs when Ppeak\nfrom 30-50 GPa. Although the mass of such ejecta is limited to from 0.1-1\npercent of the projectile mass in vertical impacts, this is sufficient for\nspallation to have been a plausible mechanism for the ejection of Martian\nmeteorites. Finally, we propose that impact spallation is a plausible mechanism\nfor the generation of tektites.\n", "  We examine the relation between breaks in the surface brightness profiles and\nradial abundance gradients within the optical radius in the discs of 134 spiral\ngalaxies from the CALIFA survey. The distribution of the radial abundance (in\nlogarithmic scale) in each galaxy was fitted by simple and broken linear\nrelations. The surface brightness profile was fitted assuming pure and broken\nexponents for the disc. We find that the maximum absolute difference between\nthe abundances in a disc given by broken and pure linear relations is less than\n0.05 dex in the majority of our galaxies and exceeds the scatter in abundances\nfor 26 out of 134 galaxies considered. The scatter in abundances around the\nbroken linear relation is close (within a few percent) to that around the pure\nlinear relation. The breaks in the surface brightness profiles are more\nprominent. The scatter around the broken exponent in a number of galaxies is\nlower by a factor of two or more than that around the pure exponent. The shapes\nof the abundance gradients and surface brightness profiles within the optical\nradius in a galaxy may be different. A pure exponential surface brightness\nprofile may be accompanied by a broken abundance gradient and vise versa. There\nis no correlation between the break radii of the abundance gradients and\nsurface brightness profiles. Thus, a break in the surface brightness profile\ndoes not need to be accompanied by a break in the abundance gradient.\n", "  Many excited charmed strange baryons such as $\\Xi_c(2790)$, $\\Xi_c(2815)$,\n$\\Xi_c(2930)$, $\\Xi_c(2980)$, $\\Xi_c(3055)$, $\\Xi_c(3080)$ and $\\Xi_c(3123)$\nhave been observed. In order to understand their internal structure and to\ndetermine their spin-parities, the strong decay properties of these baryons as\npossible $P$-wave excited $\\Xi_c$ candidates have been systematically studied\nin a $^3P_0$ model. The configurations and $J^P$ assignments of $\\Xi_c(2790)$,\n$\\Xi_c(2815)$, $\\Xi_c(2930)$, $\\Xi_c(2980)$, $\\Xi_c(3055)$, $\\Xi_c(3080)$ and\n$\\Xi_c(3123)$ have been explored based on recent experimental data. In our\nanalyses, $\\Xi_c(3055)$, $\\Xi_c(3080)$ and $\\Xi_c(3123)$ seem impossible to be\nthe $P$-wave excited $\\Xi_c$. $\\Xi_c(2790)$, $\\Xi_c(2815)$, $\\Xi_c(2930)$ and\n$\\Xi_c(2980)$ may be the $P$-wave excited $\\Xi_c$. In particular, $\\Xi_c(2790)$\nand $\\Xi_c(2815)$ are very possibly the $P$-wave excited $\\Xi_{c1}(1/2^-)$ and\n$\\Xi_{c1}(3/2^-)$, respectively. $\\Xi_c(2980)$ may be the $P$-wave excited\n$\\Xi_{c1}^{'}(\\frac{1}{2}^-)$. $\\Xi_c(2930)$ may be the $P$-wave\n$\\Xi_{c0}^{'}(\\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\\tilde{\\Xi}_{c0}(\\frac{1}{2}^-)$,\n$\\Xi_{c2}^{'}(\\frac{3}{2}^-)$, $\\Xi_{c2}^{'}(\\frac{5}{2}^-)$,\n$\\tilde{\\Xi}_{c2}(\\frac{3}{2}^-)$ or $\\tilde{\\Xi}_{c2}(\\frac{5}{2}^-)$.\nFurthermore, some branching fraction ratios related to the internal structure\nand quark configuration of $P$-wave $\\Xi_c$ have also been computed.\nMeasurements of these ratios in the future will be helpful to understand these\nexcited $\\Xi_c$.\n", "  Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) are characterized by a remarkable\nvariability in the X-ray domain, widely ascribed to the accretion from a clumpy\nstellar wind. In this paper we performed a systematic and homogeneous analysis\nof sufficiently bright X-ray flares from the SFXTs observed with XMM-Newton to\nprobe spectral variations on timescales as short as a few hundred of seconds.\nOur ultimate goal is to investigate if SFXT flares and outbursts are triggered\nby the presence of clumps and eventually reveal whether strongly or mildly\ndense clumps are required. For all sources, we employ a technique developed by\nour group, making use of an adaptive rebinned hardness ratio to optimally\nselect the time intervals for the spectral extraction. A total of twelve\nobservations performed in the direction of five SFXTs are reported. We show\nthat both strongly and mildly dense clumps can trigger these events. In the\nformer case, the local absorption column density may increase by a factor of\n>>3, while in the latter case, the increase is only by a factor of 2-3 (or\nlower). Overall, there seems to be no obvious correlation between the dynamic\nranges in the X-ray fluxes and absorption column densities in SFXTs, with an\nindication that lower densities are recorded at the highest fluxes. This can be\nexplained by the presence of accretion inhibition mechanism(s). We propose a\nclassification of the flares/outbursts from these sources to drive future\nobservational investigations. We suggest that the difference between the\nclasses of flares/outbursts is related to the fact that the mechanism(s)\ninhibiting accretion can be overcome more easily in some sources compared to\nothers. We also investigate the possibility that different stellar wind\nstructures, rather than clumps, could provide the means to temporarily overcome\nthe inhibition of accretion in SFXTs.\n", "  The multi-planetary system HD 106315 was recently found in K2 data . The\nplanets have periods of $P_b \\sim9.55$ and $P_c \\sim 21.06\\,$days, and radii of\n$ r_b = 2.44 \\pm 0.17\\, $ and $r_c = 4.35 \\pm 0.23\\, $ $R_{\\oplus}$. The\nbrightness of the host star (V=9.0 mag) makes it an excellent target for\ntransmission spectroscopy. However, to interpret transmission spectra it is\ncrucial to measure the planetary masses. We obtained high precision radial\nvelocities for HD~106315 to determine the mass of the two transiting planets\ndiscovered with Kepler K2. Our successful observation strategy was carefully\ntailored to mitigate the effect of stellar variability. We modelled the new\nradial velocity data together with the K2 transit photometry and a new\nground-based partial transit of HD 106315c to derive system parameters. We\nestimate the mass of HD 106315b to be 12.6 $\\pm$ 3.2 $M_{\\oplus}$ and the\ndensity to be $4.7 \\pm 1.7\\, g\\,cm^{-3}$, while for HD 106315c we estimate a\nmass of 15.2 $\\pm$ 3.7 $M_{\\oplus}$ and a density of $1.01 \\pm 0.29\\,\n$g\\,cm$^{-3}$. Hence, despite planet c having a radius almost twice as large as\nplanet b, their masses are consistent with one another. We conclude that HD\n106315c has a thick hydrogen-helium gaseous envelope. A detailed investigation\nof HD 106315b using a planetary interior model constrains the core mass\nfraction to be 5-29\\%, and the water mass fraction to be 10-50\\%. An\nalternative, not considered by our model, is that HD 106315b is composed of a\nlarge rocky core with a thick H-He envelope. Transmission spectroscopy of these\nplanets will give insight into their atmospheric compositions and also help\nconstrain their core compositions.\n", "  We report on a 95 GHz ($8_0-7_1$ A$^{+}$) methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission survey\nwith the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 13.7 m telescope. Eight supernova\nremnants (SNRs) with angular size $\\lesssim$ 10' were observed, but emission\nwas only detected in three SNRs near the Galactic center (Sgr A East, G\n0.1-0.1, and G 359.92-0.09). CH$_3$OH emission mainly surrounds the SNRs and\ncan be decomposed into nine spatial peaks with velocity range of eight peaks\nbeing (-30, 70) km s$^{-1}$, and the other (70, 120) km s$^{-1}$. They are\nprobably excited by interaction with these SNRs and adjacent molecular gas in\nthe central molecular zone (CMZ), although star formation may play an important\nrole in exciting CH$_3$OH emission in some regions of CMZ. We infer that tidal\naction is unlikely to be an excitation source for CH$_3$OH emission.\n", "  We report an extensive study on the zero field ground state of a powder\nsample of the pyrochlore $\\mathrm{Yb_2Ti_2O_7}$. A sharp heat capacity anomaly\nthat labels a low temperature phase transition in this material is observed at\n280 mK. Neutron diffraction shows that a \\emph{quasi-collinear} ferromagnetic\norder develops below $T_\\mathrm{c}$ with a magnetic moment of\n$0.87(2)\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$. High resolution inelastic neutron scattering\nmeasurements show, below the phase transition temperature, sharp gapped\nlow-lying magnetic excitations coexisting with a remnant quasielastic\ncontribution likely associated with persistent spin fluctuations. Moreover, a\nbroad inelastic continuum of excitations at $\\sim0.6$ meV is observed from the\nlowest measured temperature up to at least 2.5 K. At 10 K, the continuum has\nvanished and a broad quasielastic conventional paramagnetic scattering takes\nplace at the observed energy range. Finally, we show that the exchange\nparameters obtained within the framework of linear spin-wave theory do not\naccurately describe the observed zero field inelastic neutron scattering data.\n", "  We study the temperature dependence ($77$ K - $475$ K) of the longitudinal\nresistivity and Hall coefficient of thin films (thickness $20$ nm) of three\ndimensional topological Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi grown via molecular beam\nepitaxy (MBE). The temperature-dependent Hall coefficient is electron-like at\nlow temperature, but transitions to hole-like transport around $200$ K. We\ndevelop a model of a Dirac band with electron-hole asymmetry in Fermi velocity\nand mobility (assumed proportional to the square of Fermi velocity) which\nexplains well the magnitude and temperature dependence of the Hall resistivity.\nWe find that the hole mobility is about $7$ times larger than the electron\nmobility. In addition, we find that the electron mobility decreases\nsignificantly with increasing temperature, suggesting electron-phonon\nscattering strongly limits the room temperature mobility.\n", "  In the context of a discrete analogue of the classical Heisenberg model, we\ninvestigate critical behavior of the icosahedron model, where the interaction\nenergy is defined as the inner product of neighboring vector spins of unit\nlength pointing to vertices of the icosahedron. Effective correlation length\nand magnetization of the model are calculated by means of the corner-transfer\nmatrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method. Scaling analysis with respect to\nthe cutoff dimension $m$ in CTMRG reveals the second-order phase transition\ncharacterized by the exponents $\\nu = 1.62\\pm0.02$ and $\\beta = 0.12\\pm0.01$.\nWe also extract the central charge from the classical analogue of the\nentanglement entropy as $c = 1.90\\pm0.02$, which cannot be explained by the\nminimal series of conformal field theory.\n", "  X-ray continuum spectra of super-Eddington accretion flow are studied by\nmeans of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations based on the radiation\nhydrodynamic simulation data, in which both of thermal and bulk Compton\nscatterings are taken into account. We compare the calculated spectra of\naccretion flow around black holes with masses of $M_{\\rm BH} = 10, 10^2, 10^3$,\nand $10^4 M_\\odot$ for a fixed mass injection rate (from the computational\nboundary at $10^3 r_{\\rm s}$) of $10^3 L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$ (with $r_{\\rm s}$,\n$L_{\\rm Edd}$, and $c$ being the Schwarzschild radius, the Eddington\nluminosity, and the speed of light, respectively). The soft X-ray spectra\nexhibit mass dependence in accordance with the standard-disk relation; the\nmaximum surface temperature is scaled as $T \\propto M_{\\rm BH}^{-1/4}$. The\nspectra in the hard X-ray bands, by contrast, look quite similar among\ndifferent models, if we normalize the radiation luminosity by $M_{\\rm BH}$.\nThis reflects that the hard component is created by thermal and bulk Compton\nscattering of soft photons originating from an accretion flow in the\nover-heated and/or funnel regions, the temperatures of which have no mass\ndependence. The hard X-ray spectra can be reproduced by a Wien spectrum with\ntemperature of $T\\sim 3$ keV accompanied by a hard excess at photon energy\nabove several keV. The excess spectrum can be well fitted with a power law with\na photon index of $\\Gamma \\sim 3$. This feature is in good agreement with that\nof the recent NuSTAR observations of ULX (Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources).\n", "  As revealed by its peculiar Kepler light curve, the enigmatic star KIC\n8462852 undergoes short and deep flux dimmings at a priori unrelated epochs. It\npresents nonetheless all other characteristics of a quiet 1 Gyr old F3V star.\nThese dimmings resemble the absorption features expected for the transit of\ndust cometary tails. The exocomet scenario is therefore most commonly\nadvocated. We reanalyzed the Kepler data and extracted a new high-quality light\ncurve to allow for the search of shallow signature of single or a few\nexocomets. We discovered that among the 22 flux dimming events that we\nidentified, two events present a striking similarity. These events occurred\n928.25 days apart, lasted for 4.4 days with a drop of the star brightness by\n1000 ppm. We show that the light curve of these events is well explained by the\noccultation of the star by a giant ring system, or the transit of a string of\nhalf a dozen of exocomets with a typical dust production rate of 10$^5$-10$^6$\nkg/s. Assuming that these two similar events are related to the transit of the\nsame object, we derive a period of 928.25 days. The following transit was\nexpected in March 2017 but bad weather prohibited us to detect it from\nground-based spectroscopy. We predict that the next event will occur from the\n3rd to the 8th of October 2019.\n", "  We present a new calculation of the neutrino flux received at Earth from a\nmassive star in the $\\sim 24$ hours of evolution prior to its explosion as a\nsupernova (presupernova). Using the stellar evolution code MESA, the neutrino\nemissivity in each flavor is calculated at many radial zones and time steps. In\naddition to thermal processes, neutrino production via beta processes is\nmodeled in detail, using a network of 204 isotopes. We find that the total\nproduced $\\nu_{e}$ flux has a high energy spectrum tail, at $E \\gtrsim 3 - 4$\nMeV, which is mostly due to decay and electron capture on isotopes with $A = 50\n- 60$. In a tentative window of observability of $E \\gtrsim 0.5$ MeV and $t <\n2$ hours pre-collapse, the contribution of beta processes to the $\\nu_{e}$ flux\nis at the level of $\\sim90\\%$ . For a star at $D=1$ kpc distance, a 17 kt\nliquid scintillator detector would typically observe several tens of events\nfrom a presupernova, of which up to $\\sim 30\\%$ due to beta processes. These\nprocesses dominate the signal at a liquid argon detector, thus greatly\nenhancing its sensitivity to a presupernova.\n", "  Advanced LIGO achieved the first detection of the gravitational wave, which\nwas from a merging binary black hole (BBH). In the near future, more merger\nevents will be observed, and the mass distribution of them will become\navailable. The mass distribution of merger events reflects the evolutionary\npath of BBHs: dynamical formation in dense star clusters or common envelope\nevolution from primordial binaries. In this paper, we estimate the detection\nrate of merging BBHs which dynamically formed in dense star clusters by\ncombining the results of $N$-body simulations, modeling of globular clusters,\nand cosmic star-cluster formation history. We estimate that the merger rate\ndensity in the local universe within the redshift of 0.1 is 13--57 Gpc$^{-3}$\nyr$^{-1}$. We find that the detection rate is 0.23--4.6 per year for the\ncurrent sensitivity limit and that it would increase to 5.1--99 per year for\nthe designed sensitivity which will be achieved in 2019. The distribution of\nmerger rate density in the local universe as a function of redshifted chirp\nmass has a peak close to the low-mass end.The chirp mass function of the\ndetected mergers, on the other hand, has a peak at the high-mass end, but is\nalmost flat. This difference is simply because the detection range is larger\nfor more massive BBHs.\n", "  In the expanding universe, two interacting fields are no longer in thermal\ncontact when the interaction rate becomes smaller than the Hubble expansion\nrate. After decoupling, two subsystems are usually treated separately in\naccordance with equilibrium thermodynamics and the thermodynamic entropy gives\na fiducial quantity conserved in each subsystem. In this paper, we discuss a\ncorrection to this paradigm from quantum entanglement of two coupled fields.\nThe thermodynamic entropy is generalized to the entanglement entropy. We\nformulate a perturbation theory to derive the entanglement entropy and present\nFeynman rules in diagrammatic calculations. For specific models to illustrate\nour formulation, an interacting scalar-scalar system, quantum electrodynamics,\nand the Yukawa theory are considered. We calculate the entanglement entropy in\nthese models and find a quantum correction to the thermodynamic entropy. The\ncorrection is revealed to be important in circumstances of instantaneous\ndecoupling.\n", "  Future searches for biomarkers on habitable exoplanets will rely on telescope\ninstruments that achieve extremely high contrast at small planet-to-star\nangular separations. Coronagraphy is a promising starlight suppression\ntechnique, providing excellent contrast and throughput for off-axis sources on\nclear apertures. However, the complexity of space- and ground-based telescope\napertures goes on increasing over time, owing to the combination of primary\nmirror segmentation, secondary mirror, and support structures. These\ndiscontinuities in the telescope aperture limit the coronagraph performance. In\nthis paper, we present ACAD-OSM, a novel active method to correct for the\ndiffractive effects of aperture discontinuities in the final image plane of a\ncoronagraph. Active methods use one or several deformable mirrors that are\ncontrolled with an interaction matrix to correct for the aberrations in the\npupil. However, they are often limited by the amount of aberrations introduced\nby aperture discontinuities. This algorithm relies on the recalibration of the\ninteraction matrix during the correction process to overcome this limitation.\nWe first describe the ACAD-OSM technique and compare it to the previous active\nmethods for the correction of aperture discontinuities. We then show its\nperformance in terms of contrast and off-axis throughput for static aperture\ndiscontinuities (segmentation, struts) and for some aberrations evolving over\nthe life of the instrument (residual phase aberrations, artifacts in the\naperture, misalignments in the coronagraph design). This technique can now\nobtain the earth-like planet detection threshold of 10^(-10) contrast on any\ngiven aperture over at least a 10% spectral bandwidth, with several coronagraph\ndesigns.\n", "  We report on the variation in the optical polarization of the blazar PKS\n1749+096 observed in 2008--2015. The degree of polarization (PD) tends to\nincrease in short flares having a time-scale of a few days. The object favors a\npolarization angle (PA) of $40^\\circ$--$50^\\circ$ at the flare maxima, which is\nclose to the position angle of the jet ($20^\\circ$--$40^\\circ$). Three clear\npolarization rotations were detected in the negative PA direction associated\nwith flares. In addition, a rapid and large decrease in the PA was observed in\nthe other two flares, while another two flares showed no large PA variation.\nThe light curve maxima of the flares possibly tend to lag behind the PD maxima\nand color-index minima. The PA became $-50^\\circ$ to $-20^\\circ$ in the decay\nphase of active states, which is almost perpendicular to the jet position\nangle. We propose a scenario to explain these observational features, where\ntransverse shocks propagate along curved trajectories. The favored PA at the\nflare maxima suggests that the observed variations were governed by the\nvariations in the Doppler factor, $\\delta$. Based on this scenario, the minimum\nviewing angle of the source, $\\theta_\\mathrm{min}=4.8^\\circ$--$6.6^\\circ$, and\nthe location of the source, $\\Delta r\\gtrsim 0.1$pc, from the central black\nhole were estimated. In addition, the acceleration of electrons by the shock\nand synchrotron cooling would have a time-scale similar to that of the change\nin $\\delta$. The combined effect of the variation in $\\delta$ and\nacceleration/cooling of electrons is probably responsible for the observed\ndiversity of the polarization variations in the flares.\n", "  The study of elastic membranes carrying topological defects has a\nlongstanding history, going back at least to the 1950s. When allowed to buckle\nin three-dimensional space, membranes with defects can totally relieve their\nin-plane strain, remaining with a bending energy, whose rigidity modulus is\nsmall compared to the stretching modulus. In this paper, we study membranes\nwith a single edge-dislocation. We prove that the minimum bending energy\nassociated with strain-free configurations diverges logarithmically with the\nsize of the system.\n", "  The impossibility of an indeterministic evolution for standard relativistic\nquantum field theories, that is, theories in which all fields satisfy the\ncondition that the generators of spacetime translation have spectrum in the\nforward light-cone, is demonstrated. The demonstration proceeds by arguing that\na relativistically invariant theory must have a stable vacuum, and then showing\nthat stability of the vacuum, together with the requirements imposed by\nrelativistic causality, entails deterministic evolution, if all degrees of\nfreedom are standard degrees of freedom.\n", "  Monolayer photonic materials offer a tremendous potential for on-chip\noptoelectronic devices. Their realization requires knowledge of optical\ncoherence properties of excitons and trions that have so far been limited to\nnonlinear optical experiments carried out with strongly inhomogenously\nbroadened material. Here we employ h-BN encapsulated and electrically gated\nMoSe2 to reveal coherence properties of trion-species directly in the linear\noptical response. Autocorrelation measurements reveal long dephasing times up\nto T2=1.16+-0.05 ps for positively charged excitons. Gate dependent\nmeasurements provide evidence that the positively-charged trion forms via\nspatially localized hole states making this trion less prone to dephasing in\nthe presence of elevated hole carrier concentrations. Quantum beat signatures\ndemonstrate coherent coupling between excitons and trions that have a dephasing\ntime up to 0.6 ps, a two-fold increase over those in previous reports. A key\nmerit of the prolonged exciton/trion coherences is that they were achieved in a\nlinear optical experiment, and thus are directly relevant to applications in\nnanolasers, coherent control, and on-chip quantum information processing\nrequiring long photon coherence.\n", "  We explore the use of galaxy bispectrum induced by the nonlinear\ngravitational evolution as a possible probe to test general scalar-tensor\ntheories with second-order equations of motion. We find that time dependence of\nthe leading second-order kernel is approximately characterized by one\nparameter, the second-order index, which is expected to trace the higher-order\ngrowth history of the Universe. We show that our new parameter can\nsignificantly carry new information about the non-linear growth of structure.\nWe forecast future constraints on the second-order index as well as the\nequation-of-state parameter and the growth index.\n", "  We present analytical compact solution for the density matrix and correlation\nfunctions of two collective-macroscopic spins evolving via Ising-like\nHamiltonian in the presence of particle losses. The losses introduce non-local\nphase noise which destroys highly entangled states arising in the evolution. On\nthe other hand, the states appearing at relatively short timescales, possessing\nEPR-like entanglement will survive. Applying our solutions to the recently\nproposed scheme to entangle two Bose-Einstein condensates, we estimate the\noptimal number of atoms for EPR correlations.\n", "  A recently developed variational resummation technique, incorporating\nrenormalization group properties consistently, has been shown to solve the\nscale dependence problem that plagues the evaluation of thermodynamical\nquantities, e.g., within the framework of approximations such as in the\nhard-thermal-loop resummed perturbation theory. This method is used in the\npresent work to evaluate thermodynamical quantities within the two-dimensional\nnonlinear sigma model, which, apart from providing a technically simpler\ntesting ground, shares some common features with Yang-Mills theories, like\nasymptotic freedom, trace anomaly and the nonperturbative generation of a mass\ngap. The present application confirms that nonperturbative results can be\nreadily generated solely by considering the lowest-order (quasi-particle)\ncontribution to the thermodynamic effective potential, when this quantity is\nrequired to be renormalization group invariant. We also show that when the\nnext-to-leading correction from the method is accounted for, the results\nindicate convergence, apart from optimally preserving, within the\napproximations here considered, the sought-after scale invariance.\n", "  Directly tracking an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) by widely\nseparated spacecrafts is a great challenge. However, such an event could\nprovide us a good opportunity to study the evolution of embedded Alfv\\'enic\nfluctuations (AFs) inside ICME and their contributions to local plasma heating\ndirectly. In this study, an ICME observed by Wind at 1.0 au on March 4-6 1998\nis tracked to the location of Ulysess at 5.4 au. AFs are commonly found inside\nthe ICME at 1.0 au, with an occurrence rate of 21.7% and at broadband\nfrequencies from 4$\\times 10^{-4}$ to 5$\\times 10^{-2}$ Hz. When the ICME\npropagates to 5.4 au, the Aflv\\'enicity decreases significantly, and AFs are\nrare and only found at few localized frequencies with the occurrence rate\ndecreasing to 3.0%. At the same time, the magnetic field intensity at the\nAF-rich region has an extra magnetic dissipation except ICME expansion effect.\nThe energetics of the ICME at different radial distance is also investigated\nhere. Under similar magnetic field intensity situations at 1.0 au, the\nturbulence cascade rate at the AF-rich region is much larger than the value at\nthe AF-lack region. Moreover, it can maintain as the decrease of magnetic field\nintensity if there is lack of AFs. However, when there exists many AFs, it\nreduces significantly as the AFs disappear. The turbulence cascade dissipation\nrate within the ICME is inferred to be 1622.3 $J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$,\nwhich satisfies the requirement of local ICME plasma heating rate, 1653.2\n$J\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot s^{-1}$. We suggest that AF dissipation is responsible for\nextra magnetic dissipation and local plasma heating inside ICME.\n", "  Random numbers are required for a variety of applications from secure\ncommunications to Monte-Carlo simulation. Yet randomness is an asymptotic\nproperty and no output string generated by a physical device can be strictly\nproven to be random. We report an experimental realization of a quantum random\nnumber generator (QRNG) with randomness certified by quantum contextuality and\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem. The certification is not performed in a\ndevice-independent way but through a rigorous theoretical proof of each outcome\nbeing value-indefinite even in the presence of experimental imperfections. The\nanalysis of the generated data confirms the incomputable nature of our QRNG.\n", "  Hard X-ray ($\\geq 10$ keV) observations of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can\nshed light on some of the most obscured episodes of accretion onto supermassive\nblack holes. The 70-month Swift/BAT all-sky survey, which probes the 14-195 keV\nenergy range, has currently detected 838 AGN. We report here on the broad-band\nX-ray (0.3-150 keV) characteristics of these AGN, obtained by combining\nXMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, ASCA, Chandra, and Suzaku observations in the soft X-ray\nband ($\\leq 10$ keV) with 70-month averaged Swift/BAT data. The non-blazar AGN\nof our sample are almost equally divided into unobscured ($N_{\\rm H}<\n10^{22}\\rm cm^{-2}$) and obscured ($N_{\\rm H}\\geq 10^{22}\\rm cm^{-2}$) AGN, and\ntheir Swift/BAT continuum is systematically steeper than the 0.3-10 keV\nemission, which suggests that the presence of a high-energy cutoff is almost\nubiquitous. We discuss the main X-ray spectral parameters obtained, such as the\nphoton index, the reflection parameter, the energy of the cutoff, neutral and\nionized absorbers, and the soft excess for both obscured and unobscured AGN.\n", "  The decays $\\chi_{c1} \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and $\\chi_{c2}\n\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ are observed and used to study the resonance\nparameters of the $\\chi_{c1}$ and $\\chi_{c2}$ mesons. The masses of these\nstates are measured to be m(\\chi_{c1}) = 3510.71 \\pm 0.04(stat) \\pm\n0.09(syst)MeV\\,, m(\\chi_{c2}) = 3556.10 \\pm 0.06(stat) \\pm 0.11(syst)MeV\\,,\nwhere the knowledge of the momentum scale for charged particles dominates the\nsystematic uncertainty. The momentum-scale uncertainties largely cancel in the\nmass difference m(\\chi_{c2}) - m(\\chi_{c1}) = 45.39 \\pm 0.07(stat) \\pm\n0.03(syst)MeV\\,. The natural width of the $\\chi_{c2}$ meson is measured to be\n$$\\Gamma(\\chi_{c2}) = 2.10 \\pm 0.20(stat) \\pm 0.02(syst)MeV\\,.$$ These results\nare in good agreement with and have comparable precision to the current world\naverages.\n", "  (abridged) We present the IRAM-30m observations of multiple-J CO and CI line\nemission in a sample of redshift ~2-4 Herschel-ATLAS SMGs. A non-negligible\neffect of differential lensing is found for the CO emission lines, which could\nhave caused significant underestimations of the linewidths, hence of the\ndynamical masses. The CO SLEDs are found to be similar to those of the local\nstarburst-dominated ULIRGs and of the previously studied SMGs. After correcting\nfor lensing amplification, we derived the global properties of the bulk of\nmolecular gas in the SMGs using non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. The gas\nthermal pressure is found to be correlated with star formation efficiency.\nFurther decomposing the CO SLEDs into two excitation components, we find a\nlow-excitation component, which is less correlated with star formation, and a\nhigh-excitation one which is tightly related to the on-going star-forming\nactivity. Additionally, tight linear correlations between the FIR and CO line\nluminosities have been confirmed for the $J \\ge 5$ CO lines, implying that\nthese CO lines are good tracers of star formation. The [CI](2-1) lines follow\nthe tight linear correlation between the luminosities of the [CI](2-1) and the\nCO(1-0) line found in local starbursts, indicating that CI lines could serve as\ngood total molecular gas mass tracers for high-redshift SMGs. The total mass of\nthe molecular gas reservoir, $(1-30) \\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$, suggests a\ntypical molecular gas depletion time ~20-100 Myr and a gas to dust mass ratio\n${\\delta}_{\\rm GDR}$~30-100. The ratio between CO line luminosity and the dust\nmass appears to be slowly increasing with redshift for the SMGs, which need to\nbe further confirmed. Finally, through comparing the linewidth of CO and H2O\nlines, we find that they agree well in almost all our SMGs, confirming that the\nemitting regions are co-spatially located.\n", "  A fully quantum mechanical description of the precessional damping of Pt/Co\nbilayer is presented in the framework of the Keldysh Green function approach\nusing {\\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations. In contrast to\nprevious calculations of classical Gilbert damping ($\\alpha_{GD}$), we\ndemonstrate that $\\alpha_{GD}$ in the quantum case does not diverge in the\nballistic regime due to the finite size of the total spin, $S$. In the limit of\n$S\\rightarrow\\infty$ we show that the formalism recovers the torque correlation\nexpression for $\\alpha_{GD}$ which we decompose into spin-pumping and\nspin-orbital torque correlation contributions. The formalism is generalized to\ntake into account a self consistently determined dephasing mechanism which\npreserves the conservation laws and allows the investigation of the effect of\ndisorder. The dependence of $\\alpha_{GD}$ on Pt thickness and disorder strength\nis calculated and the spin diffusion length of Pt and spin mixing conductance\nof the bilayer are determined and compared with experiments.\n", "  Our knowledge of the Solar System, encourages us to beleive that we might\nexpect exomoons to be present around some of the known exoplanets. With present\nhardware and existing optical astronomy methods we shall not be able to find\nexomoons at least 10 years from now and even then, it will be a hard task to\ndetect them. Using data from the Exoplanet Orbit Database (EOD) we find stars\nwith Jovian exoplanets within 50 light years. Most of them will be fully\naccessible by the new radio telescope, The Five-hundred-meter Aperture\nSpherical radio Telescope (FAST) under construction, now in the test phase. We\nsuggest radio astronomy based methods to search for possible exomoons around\ntwo exoplanets.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions of plasma and magnetic\nfield from the low solar corona into interplanetary space. These eruptions are\noften associated with the acceleration of energetic electrons which produce\nvarious sources of high intensity plasma emission. In relatively rare cases,\nthe energetic electrons may also produce gyrosynchrotron emission from within\nthe CME itself, allowing for a diagnostic of the CME magnetic field strength.\nSuch a magnetic field diagnostic is important for evaluating the total magnetic\nenergy content of the CME, which is ultimately what drives the eruption. Here\nwe report on an unusually large source of gyrosynchrotron radiation in the form\nof a type IV radio burst associated with a CME occurring on 2014-September-01,\nobserved using instrumentation from the Nan\\c{c}ay Radio Astronomy Facility. A\ncombination of spectral flux density measurements from the Nan\\c{c}ay\ninstruments and the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) from 300MHz to 5 GHz\nreveals a gyrosynchrotron spectrum with a peak flux density at $>$1 GHz. Using\nthis radio analysis, a model for gyrosynchrotron radiation, a non-thermal\nelectron density diagnostic using the Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and\nimages of the eruption from the GOES Soft X-ray Imager (SXI), we are able to\ncalculate both the magnetic field strength and the properties of the X-ray and\nradio emitting energetic electrons within the CME. We find the radio emission\nis produced by non-thermal electrons of energies >1MeV with a spectral index of\n$\\delta$$\\sim$3 in a CME magnetic field of 4.4 G at a height of 1.3\nR$_{\\odot}$, while the X-ray emission is produced from a similar distribution\nof electrons but with much lower energies on the order of 10 keV. We conclude\nby comparing X-ray and radio-emitting electron distributions and how such an\nanalysis can be used to define the plasma properties of a CME.\n", "  The coherent process that a single photon simultaneously excites two qubits\nhas recently been theoretically predicted by\n[https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.043601 {Phys. Rev. Lett. 117,\n043601 (2016)}]. We propose a different approach to observe a similar dynamical\nprocess based on a superconducting quantum circuit, where two coupled flux\nqubits longitudinally interact with the same resonator. We show that this\nsimultaneous excitation of two qubits (assuming that the sum of their\ntransition frequencies is close to the cavity frequency) is related to the\ncounter-rotating terms in the dipole-dipole coupling between two qubits, and\nthe standard rotating-wave approximation is not valid here. By numerically\nsimulating the adiabatic Landau-Zener transition and Rabi-oscillation effects,\nwe clearly verify that the energy of a single photon can excite two qubits via\nhigher-order transitions induced by the longitudinal couplings and the\ncounter-rotating terms. Compared with previous studies, the coherent dynamics\nin our system only involves one intermediate state and, thus, exhibits a much\nfaster rate. We also find transition paths which can interfere. Finally, by\ndiscussing how to control the two longitudinal-coupling strengths, we find a\nmethod to observe both constructive and destructive interference phenomena in\nour system.\n", "  We report on the design and first year of operations of the DEdicated MONitor\nof EXotransits and Transients (DEMONEXT). DEMONEXT is a 20 inch (0.5-m) robotic\ntelescope using a PlaneWave CDK20 telescope on a Mathis instruments MI-750/1000\nfork mount. DEMONEXT is equipped with a $2048\\times2048$ pixel Finger Lakes\nInstruments (FLI) detector, a 10-position filter wheel with an electronic\nfocuser and $B$, $V$, $R$, $I$, $g'$, $r'$, $i'$, $z'$, and clear filters.\nDEMONEXT operates in a continuous observing mode and achieves 2-4 mmag raw,\nunbinned, precision on bright $V<13$ targets with 20-120 second exposures, and\n1 mmag precision achieved by binning on 5-6 minute timescales. DEMONEXT\nmaintains sub-pixel ($<0.5$ pixels) target position stability on the CCD over 8\nhours in good observing conditions, with degraded performance in poor weather\n($<1$ pixel). DEMONEXT achieves 1-10% photometry on single-epoch targets with\n$V<17$ in 5 minute exposures, with detection thresholds of $V\\approx21$. The\nDEMONEXT automated software has produced 143 planetary candidate transit light\ncurves for the KELT collaboration, and 48 supernovae and transient light curves\nfor the ASAS-SN supernovae group in the first year of operation. DEMONEXT has\nalso observed for a number of ancillary science projects including Galactic\nmicrolensing, active galactic nuclei, stellar variability, and stellar\nrotation.\n", "  The resonant line shape from driving a transition between two states,\n$|\\rm{a}\\rangle$ and $|\\rm{b}\\rangle$, can be distorted due to a\nquantum-mechanical interference effect involving a resonance between two\ndifferent states, $|\\rm{c}\\rangle$ and $|\\rm{d}\\rangle$, if $|\\rm{c}\\rangle$\nhas a decay path to $|\\rm{a}\\rangle$ and $|\\rm{d}\\rangle$ has a decay path to\n$|\\rm{b}\\rangle$. This interference can cause a shift of the measured\nresonance, despite the fact that the two resonances do not have a common\ninitial or final state. As an example, we demonstrate that such a shift affects\nmeasurements of the atomic hydrogen 2S$_{1/2}$-to-2P$_{1/2}$ Lamb-shift\ntransition due to 3S-to-3P transitions if the 3S$_{1/2}$ state has some initial\npopulation.\n", "  We establish an analogy between superconductor-metal interfaces and the\nquantum physics of a black hole, using the proximity effect. We show that the\nmetal-superconductor interface can be thought of as an event horizon and\nAndreev reflection from the interface is analogous to the Hawking radiation in\nblack holes. We describe quantum information transfer in Andreev reflection\nwith a final state projection model similar to the Horowitz-Maldacena model for\nblack hole evaporation. We also propose the Andreev reflection-analogue of\nHayden and Preskill's description of a black hole final state, where the black\nhole is described as an information mirror. The analogy between Crossed Andreev\nReflections and Einstein-Rosen bridges is discussed: our proposal gives a\nprecise mechanism for the apparent loss of quantum information in a black hole\nby the process of nonlocal Andreev reflection, transferring the quantum\ninformation through a wormhole and into another universe. Given these\nestablished connections, we conjecture that the final quantum state of a black\nhole is exactly the same as the ground state wavefunction of the\nsuperconductor/superfluid in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of\nsuperconductivity; in particular, the infalling matter and the infalling\nHawking quanta, described in the Horowitz-Maldacena model, forms a Cooper\npair-like singlet state inside the black hole. A black hole evaporating and\nshrinking in size can be thought of as the analogue of Andreev reflection by a\nhole where the superconductor loses a Cooper pair. Our model does not suffer\nfrom the black hole information problem since Andreev reflection is unitary. We\nalso relate the thermodynamic properties of a black hole to that of a\nsuperconductor, and propose an experiment which can demonstrate the negative\nspecific heat feature of black holes in a growing/evaporating condensate.\n", "  Here we study how coherence appears in a system driven by noise at small\nscales. In the wave turbulence modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, we observe states with correlation scales less than the\nsystem size but much larger than the excitation scale. We call such state\nprecondensate to distinguish it from condensate defined as a system-wide\ncoherent state. Both condensate and precondensate are characterized by large\nscale phase coherence and narrow distribution of amplitudes. When one excites\nsmall scales, precondensate is achieved relatively quickly by an inverse\ncascade heating quasi-equilibrium distribution of large-scale modes. The\ntransition from the precondensate to the system-wide condensate requires much\nlonger time. The spectra of precondensate differ from quasi-equilibrium and are\ncharacterized by two bending points, one on the scale of the average distance\nbetween vortex pairs, and the other on the scale of the distance between\nvortices in a pair. We suggest temporal evolution laws for both lengths and use\nthem to predict the probability of the transition to condensate.\n", "  We recently formulated a model of the universe based on an underlying\nW3-symmetry. It allows the creation of the universe from nothing and the\ncreation of baby universes and wormholes for spacetimes of dimension 2, 3, 4, 6\nand 10. Here we show that the classical large time and large space limit of\nthese universes is one of exponential fast expansion without the need of a\ncosmological constant. Under a number of simplifying assumptions our model\npredicts that w=-1.2 in the case of four-dimensional spacetime. The possibility\nof obtaining a w-value less than -1 is linked to the ability of our model to\ncreate baby universes and wormholes.\n", "  A new method is presented for describing vibrational effects in x-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)\nusing a combination of the classical Franck-Condon (FC) approximation and\nclassical trajectories run on the core-excited state. The formulation of RIXS\nis an extension of the semiclassical Kramers-Heisenberg (SCKH) formalism of\nRef. {Ljungberg_2010} to the resonant case, retaining approximately the same\ncomputational cost. To overcome difficulties with connecting the absorption and\nemission processes in RIXS the classical FC approximation is used for the\nabsorption, which is seen to work well provided that a zero-point-energy\ncorrection is included.\n  In the case of core-excited states with dissociative character the method is\ncapable of closely reproducing the main features for one-dimensional test\nsystems, compared to the quantum mechanical formulation. Due to the good\naccuracy combined with the relatively low computational cost, the method has\nlarge potential of being used for complex systems with many degrees of freedom,\nsuch as liquids and surface adsorbates.\n", "  The integrating factor and exponential time differencing methods are\nimplemented and tested for solving the time-dependent Kohn--Sham equations.\nPopular time propagation methods used in physics, as well as other robust\nnumerical approaches, are compared to these exponential integrator methods in\norder to judge the relative merit of the computational schemes. We determine an\nimprovement in accuracy of multiple orders of magnitude when describing\ndynamics driven primarily by a nonlinear potential. For cases of dynamics\ndriven by a time-dependent external potential, the accuracy of the exponential\nintegrator methods are less enhanced but still match or outperform the best of\nthe conventional methods tested.\n", "  We compute exact Hamiltonian (and corresponding Dirac brackets) for spinning\nparticle with gravimagnetic moment $\\kappa$ in an arbitrary gravitational\nbackground. $\\kappa=0$ corresponds to the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon\n(MPTD) equations. $\\kappa=1$ leads to modified MPTD equations with reasonable\nbehavior in the ultrarelativistic limit. So we study the modified equations in\nthe leading post-Newtonian approximation. Rotating body with unit gravimagnetic\nmoment has qualitatively different behavior as compared with MPTD body: A) If a\nnumber of gyroscopes with various rotation axes are freely traveling together,\nthe angles between the axes change with time. B) For specific binary systems,\ngravimagnetic moment gives a contribution to frame-dragging effect with the\nmagnitude, that turns out to be comparable with that of Schiff frame dragging.\n", "  Aims: The physics driving features such as breaks observed in galaxy surface\nbrightness (SB) profiles remains contentious. Here, we assess the importance of\nstellar radial motions in shaping their characteristics. Methods: We use the\nsimulated Milky Way-mass, cosmological discs, from the Ramses Disc Environment\nStudy (RaDES) to characterise the radial redistribution of stars in galaxies\ndisplaying type I (pure exponentials), II (downbending), and III (upbending) SB\nprofiles. We compare radial profiles of the mass fractions and the velocity\ndispersions of different sub-populations of stars according to their birth and\ncurrent locations. Results: Radial redistribution of stars is important in all\ngalaxies regardless of their light profiles. Type II breaks seem to be a\nconsequence of the combined effects of outward-moving and accreted stars. The\nformer produces shallower inner profiles (lack of stars in the inner disc) and\naccumulate material around the break radius and beyond, strengthening the\nbreak; the latter can weaken or even convert the break into a pure exponential.\nFurther accretion from satellites can concentrate material in the outermost\nparts, leading to type III breaks that can coexist with type II breaks, but\nsituated further out. Type III galaxies would be the result of an important\nradial redistribution of material throughout the entire disc, as well as a\nconcentration of accreted material in the outskirts. In addition, type III\ngalaxies display the most efficient radial redistribution and the largest\nnumber of accreted stars, followed by type I and II systems, suggesting that\ntype I galaxies may be an intermediate case between types II and III. In\ngeneral, the velocity dispersion profiles of all galaxies tend to flatten or\neven ncrease around the locations where the breaks are found. The age and\nmetallicity profiles are also affected, exhibiting...[abridged]\n", "  We compare $237$ Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Ly$\\alpha$) spectra of the \"MUSE-Wide\nsurvey\" (Herenz et al. 2017) to a suite of radiative transfer simulations\nconsisting of a central luminous source within a concentric, moving shell of\nneutral gas, and dust. This six parameter shell-model has been used numerously\nin previous studies, however, on significantly smaller data-sets. We find that\nthe shell-model can reproduce the observed spectral shape very well - better\nthan the also common `Gaussian-minus-Gaussian' model which we also fitted to\nthe dataset. Specifically, we find that $\\sim 94\\%$ of the fits possess a\ngoodness-of-fit value of $p(\\chi^2)>0.1$. The large number of spectra allows us\nto robustly characterize the shell-model parameter range, and consequently, the\nspectral shapes typical for realistic spectra. We find that the vast majority\nof the Ly$\\alpha$ spectral shapes require an outflow and only $\\sim 5\\%$ are\nwell-fitted through an inflowing shell. In addition, we find $\\sim 46\\%$ of the\nspectra to be consistent with a neutral hydrogen column density\n$<10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ - suggestive of a non-negligible fraction of\ncontinuum leakers in the MUSE-Wide sample. Furthermore, we correlate the\nspectral against the Ly$\\alpha$ halo properties against each other but do not\nfind any strong correlation.\n", "  Scalar tensor theories can be expressed in different frames, such as the\ncommonly-used Einstein and Jordan frames, and it is generally accepted that\ncosmological observables are the same in these frames. We revisit this by\nmaking a detailed side-by-side comparison of the quantities and equations in\ntwo conformally related frames, from the actions and fully covariant field\nequations to the linearised equations in both real and Fourier spaces. This\nconfirms that the field and conservation equations are equivalent in the two\nframes, in the sense that we can always re-express equations in one frame using\nrelevant transformations of variables to derive the corresponding equations in\nthe other. We show, with both analytical derivation and a numerical example,\nthat the line-of-sight integration to calculate CMB temperature anisotropies\ncan be done using either Einstein frame or Jordan frame quantities, and the\nresults are identical, provided the correct redshift is used in the Einstein\nframe ($1+z\\neq1/a$).\n", "  A three-dimensional (3D) nodal-loop semimetal phase is exploited to engineer\na number of intriguing phases featuring different peculiar topological surface\nstates. In particular, by introducing various two-dimensional gap terms to a 3D\ntight-binding model of a nodal-loop semimetal, we obtain a rich variety of\ntopological phases of great interest to ongoing theoretical and experimental\nstudies, including chiral insulator, degenerate-surface-loop insulator,\nsecond-order topological insulator, as well as Weyl semimetal with tunable\nFermi arc profiles. The unique concept underlying our approach is to engineer\ntopological surface states that inherit their dispersion relations from a gap\nterm. The results provide one rather unified principle for the creation of\nnovel topological phases and can guide the search for new topological\nmaterials. Two-terminal transport studies are also carried out to distinguish\nthe engineered topological phases.\n", "  The magnetoelectric effects in the surface states of the 3D TI are extremely\nstrong due to the full spin-momentum locking. Here the microscopic theory of\nS/3D TI bilayer structures in terms of quasiclassical Green's functions is\ndeveloped. On the basis of the developed formalism it is shown that the DOS in\nthe S/TI bilayer manifests giant magnetoelectric behavior and, as a result,\nS/3D TI heterostructures can work as non-magnetic fully electrically\ncontrollable spin filters. It is shown that due to the full spin-momentum\nlocking the amplitudes of the odd-frequency singlet and triplet components of\nthe consensate wave function are equal. The same is valid for the even\nfrequency singlet and triplet components. We unveil the connection between the\nodd-frequency pairing in S/3D TI heterostructures and magnetoelectric effects\nin the DOS.\n", "  To observationally study spin-period changes of accreting pulsars caused by\nthe accretion torque, the present work analyzes X-ray light curves of 12 Be\nbinary pulsars obtained by the MAXI/GSC all-sky survey and their pulse periods\nmeasured by the Fermi/GBM pulsar project, both covering more than 6 years from\n2009 August to 2016 March. The 12 objects were selected because they are\naccompanied by clear optical identification, and accurate measurements of\nsurface magnetic fields. The luminosity $L$ and the spin-frequency derivatives\n$\\dot{\\nu}$, measured during large outbursts with $L\\gtrsim 1\\times 10^{37}$\nerg s$^{-1}$, were found to approximately follow the theoretical relations in\nthe accretion torque models, represented by $\\dot{\\nu} \\propto L^{\\alpha}$\n($\\alpha\\simeq 1$), and the coefficient of proportionality between $\\dot{\\nu}$\nand $L^{\\alpha}$, agrees, within a factor of $\\sim 3$, with that proposed by\nGhosh & Lamb (1979). In the course of the present study, the orbital elements\nof several sources were refined.\n", "  This paper is the first of a series of papers constraining cosmological\nparameters with weak lensing peak statistics using $\\sim 450~\\rm deg^2$ of\nimaging data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-450). We measure high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR: $\\nu$) weak lensing convergence peaks in the range\nof $3<\\nu<5$, and employ theoretical models to derive expected values. These\nmodels are validated using a suite of simulations. We take into account two\nmajor systematic effects, the boost factor and the effect of baryons on the\nmass-concentration relation of dark matter haloes. In addition, we investigate\nthe impacts of other potential astrophysical systematics including the\nprojection effects of large scale structures, intrinsic galaxy alignments, as\nwell as residual measurement uncertainties in the shear and redshift\ncalibration. Assuming a flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find constraints for\n$S_{\\rm 8}=\\sigma_{\\rm 8}(\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.746^{+0.046}_{-0.107}$\naccording to the degeneracy direction of the cosmic shear analysis and\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm 8}=\\sigma_{\\rm 8}(\\Omega_{\\rm\nm}/0.3)^{0.38}=0.696^{+0.048}_{-0.050}$ based on the derived degeneracy\ndirection of our high-SNR peak statistics. The difference between the power\nindex of $S_{\\rm 8}$ and in $\\Sigma_{\\rm 8}$ indicates that combining the two\nprobes has the potential to break the degeneracy in $\\sigma_{\\rm 8}$ and\n$\\Omega_{\\rm m}$. Our results are consistent with the cosmic shear tomographic\ncorrelation analysis of the same dataset and $\\sim 2\\sigma$ lower than the\nPlanck 2016 results.\n", "  We study the statistics of peaks in a weak lensing reconstructed mass map of\nthe first 450 square degrees of the Kilo Degree Survey. The map is computed\nwith aperture masses directly applied to the shear field with an NFW-like\ncompensated filter. We compare the peak statistics in the observations with\nthat of simulations for various cosmologies to constrain the cosmological\nparameter $S_8 = \\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3}$, which probes the\n($\\Omega_{\\rm m}, \\sigma_8$) plane perpendicularly to its main degeneracy. We\nestimate $S_8=0.750\\pm0.059$, using peaks in the signal-to-noise range $0 \\leq\n{\\rm S/N} \\leq 4$, and accounting for various systematics, such as\nmultiplicative shear bias, mean redshift bias, baryon feedback, intrinsic\nalignment, and shear-position coupling. These constraints are $\\sim25\\%$\ntighter than the constraints from the high significance peaks alone ($3 \\leq\n{\\rm S/N} \\leq 4$) which typically trace single-massive halos. This\ndemonstrates the gain of information from low-S/N peaks. However we find that\nincluding ${\\rm S/N} < 0$ peaks does not add further information. Our results\nare in good agreement with the tomographic shear two-point correlation function\nmeasurement in KiDS-450. Combining shear peaks with non-tomographic\nmeasurements of the shear two-point correlation functions yields a $\\sim20\\%$\nimprovement in the uncertainty on $S_8$ compared to the shear two-point\ncorrelation functions alone, highlighting the great potential of peaks as a\ncosmological probe.\n", "  The status of searches for possible variation in the constants of nature from\nastronomical observation of molecules is reviewed, focusing on the\ndimensionless constant representing the proton-electron mass ratio\n$\\mu=m_p/m_e$. The optical detection of H$_2$ and CO molecules with large\nground-based telescopes (as the ESO-VLT and the Keck telescopes), as well as\nthe detection of H$_2$ with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble\nSpace Telescope is discussed in the context of varying constants, and in\nconnection to different theoretical scenarios. Radio astronomy provides an\nalternative search strategy bearing the advantage that molecules as NH$_3$\n(ammonia) and CH$_3$OH (methanol) can be used, which are much more sensitive to\na varying $\\mu$ than diatomic molecules. Current constraints are\n$|\\Delta\\mu/\\mu| < 5 \\times 10^{-6}$ for redshift $z=2.0-4.2$, corresponding to\nlook-back times of 10-12.5 Gyrs, and $|\\Delta\\mu/\\mu| < 1.5 \\times 10^{-7}$ for\n$z=0.88$, corresponding to half the age of the Universe (both at 3$\\sigma$\nstatistical significance). Existing bottlenecks and prospects for future\nimprovement with novel instrumentation are discussed.\n", "  We have systematically investigated the ground-state hyperfine structure for\nalkali-metal atoms ^{87}Rb, ^{133}Cs, ^{211}Fr and alkali-metal-like ions\n^{135}Ba^+, ^{225}Ra^+, which are of particular interest for parity violation\nstudies. The quantum electrodynamic one-loop radiative corrections have been\nrigorously evaluated within an extended Furry picture employing core-Hartree\nand Kohn-Sham atomic potentials. Moreover, the effect of the nuclear\nmagnetization distribution on the hyperfine structure intervals has been\nstudied in detail and its uncertainty has been estimated. Finally, the\ntheoretical description of the hyperfine structure has been completed with full\nmany-body calculations performed in the all-orders correlation potential\nmethod.\n", "  We searched for dust or debris rings in the Pluto-Charon system before,\nduring, and after the New Horizons encounter. Methodologies included searching\nfor back-scattered light during the approach to Pluto (phase $\\sim15^\\circ$),\nin situ detection of impacting particles, a search for stellar occultations\nnear the time of closest approach, and by forward-scattered light during\ndeparture (phase $\\sim165^\\circ$). A search using HST prior to the encounter\nalso contributed to the results. No rings, debris, or dust features were\nobserved, but our detection limits provide an improved picture of the\nenvironment throughout the Pluto-Charon system. Searches for rings in\nback-scattered light covered 35,000-250,000 km from the system barycenter, a\nzone that starts interior to the orbit of Styx, and extends to four times the\norbital radius of Hydra. We obtained our firmest limits using the NH LORRI\ncamera in the inner half of this region. Our limits on the normal $I/F$ of an\nunseen ring depends on the radial scale of the rings: $2\\times10^{-8}$\n($3\\sigma$) for 1500 km wide rings, $1\\times10^{-8}$ for 6000 km rings, and\n$7\\times10^{-9}$ for 12,000 km rings. Beyond $\\sim100,000$ km from Pluto, HST\nobservations limit normal $I/F$ to $\\sim8\\times10^{-8}$. Searches for dust from\nforward-scattered light extended from the surface of Pluto to the Pluto-Charon\nHill sphere ($r_{\\rm Hill}=6.4\\times10^6$ km). No evidence for rings or dust\nwas detected to normal $I/F$ limits of $\\sim8.9\\times10^{-7}$ on $\\sim10^4$ km\nscales. Four occulation observations also probed the space interior to Hydra,\nbut again no dust or debris was detected. Elsewhere in the solar system, small\nmoons commonly share their orbits with faint dust rings. Our results suggest\nthat small grains are quickly lost from the system due to solar radiation\npressure, whereas larger particles are unstable due to perturbations by the\nknown moons.\n", "  We report that in a $\\beta$-Mn-type chiral magnet Co$_9$Zn$_9$Mn$_2$,\nskyrmions are realized as a metastable state over a wide temperature range,\nincluding room temperature, via field-cooling through the thermodynamic\nequilibrium skyrmion phase that exists below a transition temperature\n$T_\\mathrm{c}$ $\\sim$ 400 K. The once-created metastable skyrmions survive at\nzero magnetic field both at and above room temperature. Such robust skyrmions\nin a wide temperature and magnetic field region demonstrate the key role of\ntopology, and provide a significant step toward technological applications of\nskyrmions in bulk chiral magnets.\n", "  WD 1145+017 was observed from 2016 November through 2017 June for the purpose\nof further characterizing the transit behavior of the dusty debris clouds\norbiting this white dwarf. The optical observations were carried out with a\nsmall ground-based telescope run by an amateur astronomer, and covered 53\ndifferent nights over the 8-month interval. We have found that the optical\nactivity has increased to the highest level observed since its discovery with\nKepler K2, with approximately 17% of the optical flux extinguished per orbit.\nThe source exhibits some transits with depths of up to 55% and durations as\nlong as two hours. The dominant period of the orbiting dust clouds during\n2016-2017 is 4.49126 hours. We present 'waterfall' images for the entire\n2016-2017 and 2015-2016 observing seasons. In addition, the white dwarf was\nobserved with the Chandra X-ray Observatory for 10-ksec on each of four\ndifferent occasions, separated by about a month each. The upper limit on the\naverage X-ray flux from WD 1145+017 is ~5 x 10^{-15} ergs/cm^2/s (unabsorbed\nover the range 0.1-100 keV), which translates to an upper limit on the X-ray\nluminosity, Lx, of ~2 x 10^{28} ergs/s. If Lx = G Mwd Mdot/Rwd, where Mwd and\nRwd are the mass and radius of the white dwarf, and Mdot is the accretion rate,\nthen Mdot < 2 x 10^{11} g/s. This is just consistent with the value of Mdot\nthat is inferred from the level of dust activity.\n", "  This paper reports circular spectropolarimetry and X-ray observations of\nseveral polluted white dwarfs including WD 1145+017, with the aim to constrain\nthe behavior of disk material and instantaneous accretion rates in these\nevolved planetary systems. Two stars with previously observed Zeeman splitting,\nWD 0322-019 and WD 2105-820, are detected above 5 sigma and <Bz> > 1 kG, while\nWD 1145+017, WD 1929+011, and WD 2326+049 yield (null) detections below this\nminimum level of confidence. For these latter three stars, high-resolution\nspectra and atmospheric modeling are used to obtain limits on magnetic field\nstrengths via the absence of Zeeman splitting, finding B* < 20 kG based on data\nwith resolving power R near 40 000. An analytical framework is presented for\nbulk Earth composition material falling onto the magnetic polar regions of\nwhite dwarfs, where X-rays and cyclotron radiation may contribute to accretion\nluminosity. This analysis is applied to X-ray data for WD 1145+017, WD\n1729+371, and WD 2326+049, and the upper bound count rates are modeled with\nspectra for a range of plasma kT = 1 - 10 keV in both the magnetic and\nnon-magnetic accretion regimes. The results for all three stars are consistent\nwith a typical dusty white dwarf in a steady-state at 1e8 - 1e9 g/s. In\nparticular, the non-magnetic limits for WD 1145+017 are found to be well below\nprevious estimates of up to 1e12 g/s, and likely below 1e10 g/s, thus\nsuggesting the star-disk system may be average in its evolutionary state, and\nonly special in viewing geometry.\n", "  Core collapse supernova (CCSN) rates suffer from large uncertainties as many\nCCSNe exploding in regions of bright background emission and significant dust\nextinction remain unobserved. Such a shortfall is particularly prominent in\nluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), which have high star formation (and thus\nCCSN) rates and host bright and crowded nuclear regions, where large\nextinctions and reduced search detection efficiency likely lead to a\nsignificant fraction of CCSNe remaining undiscovered. We present the first\nresults of project SUNBIRD (Supernovae UNmasked By Infra-Red Detection), where\nwe aim to uncover CCSNe that otherwise would remain hidden in the complex\nnuclear regions of LIRGs, and in this way improve the constraints on the\nfraction that is missed by optical seeing-limited surveys. We observe in the\nnear-infrared 2.15 {\\mu}m $K_s$-band, which is less affected by dust extinction\ncompared to the optical, using the multi-conjugate adaptive optics imager\nGeMS/GSAOI on Gemini South, allowing us to achieve a spatial resolution that\nlets us probe close in to the nuclear regions. During our pilot program and\nsubsequent first full year we have discovered three CCSNe and one candidate\nwith projected nuclear offsets as small as 200 pc. When compared to the total\nsample of LIRG CCSNe discovered in the near-IR and optical, we show that our\nmethod is singularly effective in uncovering CCSNe in nuclear regions and we\nconclude that the majority of CCSNe exploding in LIRGs are not detected as a\nresult of dust obscuration and poor spatial resolution.\n", "  Inspired by a recent work [Reiter, Reeb, and S{\\o}rensen, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf117}, 040501 (2016)], we present a simplified proposal for dissipatively\npreparing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state of three Rydberg atoms in a\ncavity. The $Z$ pumping is implemented under the action of the spontaneous\nemission of $\\Lambda$-type atoms and the quantum Zeno dynamics induced by\nstrong continuous coupling. In the meantime, a dissipative Rydberg pumping\nbreaks up the stability of the state $|{\\rm GHZ}_+\\rangle$ in the process of\n$Z$ pumping, making $|{\\rm GHZ}_-\\rangle$ be the unique steady state of system.\nCompared with the former scheme, the number of driving fields acting on atoms\nis greatly reduced and only a single-mode cavity is required. The numerical\nsimulation of the full master equation reveals that a high fidelity $\\sim98\\%$\ncan be obtained with the currently achievable parameters in the\nRydberg-atom-cavity system.\n", "  We investigate graviton radiation in gravitational scattering at small impact\nparameters $b<R\\equiv 2G\\sqrt{s}$ and extreme energies $s\\gg M_P^2$, a regime\nin which classical collapse is thought to occur, and thus radiation may be\nsuppressed also. Here however, by analyzing the soft-based representation of\nradiation recently proposed in the semiclassical ACV framework, we argue that\ngravitons can be efficiently produced in the untrapped region\n$|\\boldsymbol{x}|\\gtrsim R>b$, so as to suggest a possible completion of the\nunitarity sum. In fact, such energy radiation at large distances turns out to\ncompensate and to gradually reduce to nothing the amount of energy $E'$ being\ntrapped at small-$b$'s, by thus avoiding the quantum tunneling suppression of\nthe elastic scattering and suggesting a unitary evolution. We finally look at\nthe coherent radiation sample so obtained and we find that, by energy\nconservation, it develops an exponential frequency damping corresponding to a\n\"quasi-temperature\" of order $\\hbar/R$, which is naturally related to a Hawking\nradiation and is suggestive of a black-hole signal at quantum level.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the $\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\pi\\eta$ process from\nthe threshold up to 1.4 GeV in the $\\pi\\eta$ invariant mass. For the s-wave\n$a_0(980)$ resonance state we adopt a dispersive formalism using a\ncoupled-channel Omn\\`es representation, while the d-wave $a_2(1320)$ state is\ndescribed as a Breit-Wigner resonance. An analytic continuation to the\n$a_0(980)$ pole position allows us to extract its two-photon decay width as\n$\\Gamma_{a_0\\to\\gamma\\gamma}=0.27(4)$ keV.\n", "  It is now possible for hydrodynamical simulations to reproduce a\nrepresentative galaxy population. Accordingly, it is timely to assess\ncritically some of the assumptions of traditional semi-analytic galaxy\nformation models. We use the Eagle simulations to assess assumptions built into\nthe Galform semi-analytic model, focussing on those relating to baryon cycling,\nangular momentum and feedback. We show that the assumption in Galform that\nnewly formed stars have the same specific angular momentum as the total disc\nleads to a significant overestimate of the total stellar specific angular\nmomentum of disc galaxies. In Eagle, stars form preferentially out of low\nspecific angular momentum gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the\nassumed gas density threshold for stars to form, leading to more realistic\ngalaxy sizes. We find that stellar mass assembly is similar between Galform and\nEagle but that the evolution of gas properties is different, with various\nindications that the rate of baryon cycling in Eagle is slower than is assumed\nin Galform. Finally, by matching individual galaxies between Eagle and Galform,\nwe find that an artificial dependence of AGN feedback and gas infall rates on\nhalo mass doubling events in Galform drives most of the scatter in stellar mass\nbetween individual objects. Put together our results suggest that the Galform\nsemi-analytic model can be significantly improved in light of recent advances.\n", "  We study how the entanglement dynamics between two-level atoms is impacted by\nrandom fluctuations of the light cone. In our model the two-atom system is\nenvisaged as an open system coupled with an electromagnetic field in the vacuum\nstate. We employ the quantum master equation in the Born-Markov approximation\nin order to describe the completely positive time evolution of the atomic\nsystem. We restrict our investigations to the situation in which the atoms are\ncoupled individually to two spatially separated cavities, one of which\ndisplaying the emergence of light-cone fluctuations. In such a disordered\ncavity, we assume that the coefficients of the Klein-Gordon equation are random\nfunctions of the spatial coordinates. The disordered medium is modeled by a\ncentered, stationary and Gaussian process. We demonstrate that disorder has the\neffect of slowing down the entanglement decay. We conjecture that in a strong\ndisorder environment the mean life of entangled states can be enhanced in such\na way as to almost completely suppress quantum nonlocal decoherence.\n", "  We propose a novel high resolution microscopy technique for enantio-specific\ndetection of chiral samples down to sub-100 nm size, based on force\nmeasurement. We delve into the differential photo-induced optical force exerted\non an achiral probe in the vicinity of a chiral sample, when left and right\ncircularly polarized beams separately excite the sample-probe interactive\nsystem. We analytically prove that the differential force is entangled with the\nenantiomer type of the sample enabling enantio-specific detection of chiral\ninclusions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the differential force is linearly\ndependent on both the chiral response of the sample and the electric response\nof the tip and is inversely related to the quartic power of probe-sample\ndistance. We provide physical insight into the transfer of optical activity\nfrom the chiral sample to the achiral tip based on a rigorous analytical\napproach. We support our theoretical achievements by several numerical\nexamples, highlighting the potential application of the derived analytic\nproperties. Lastly, we demonstrate the sensitivity of our method to\nenantio-specify nanoscale chiral samples with chirality parameter in the order\nof 0.01, and discuss how this could be further improved.\n", "  We report the discovery, spectroscopic confirmation, and mass modelling of\nthe gravitationally lensed quasar system PS J0630-1201. The lens was discovered\nby matching a photometric quasar catalogue compiled from Pan-STARRS and WISE\nphotometry to the Gaia DR1 catalogue, exploiting the high spatial resolution of\nthe latter (FWHM $\\sim $0.1\") to identify the three brightest components of the\nlens. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the WHT confirm the multiple\nobjects are quasars at redshift $z_{q}=3.34$. Further follow-up with Keck AO\nhigh-resolution imaging reveals that the system is composed of two lensing\ngalaxies and the quasar is lensed into a $\\sim$2.8\" separation four-image cusp\nconfiguration with a fifth image clearly visible, and a 1.0\" arc due to the\nlensed quasar host galaxy. The system is well-modelled with two singular\nisothermal ellipsoids, reproducing the position of the fifth image. We discuss\nfuture prospects for measuring time delays between the images and constraining\nany offset between mass and light using the faintly detected Einstein arcs\nassociated with the quasar host galaxy.\n", "  We show that two intriguing features of mesoscopic transport, namely the\nmodulation of Coulomb blockade peak-heights and the transmission phase-lapses\noccurring between subsequent peaks, are closely related. Our analytic arguments\nare corroborated by numerical simulations for chaotic ballistic quantum dots.\nThe correlations between the two properties are experimentally testable. The\nstatistical distribution of the partial-width amplitude, at the heart of the\nprevious relationship, is determined, and its characteristic parameters are\nestimated from simple models.\n", "  We consider a linear sigma model describing $2N_f^2$ bosons ($\\sigma$, ${\\bf\na_0}$, $\\eta '$ and ${\\bf \\pi}$) as an approximate effective theory for a\n$SU(3)$ local gauge theory with $N_f$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental\nrepresentation. The model has a renormalizable $U(N_f)_L\\bigotimes U(N_f)_R$\ninvariant part, which has an approximate $O(2N_f^2)$ symmetry, and two\nadditional terms, one describing the effects of a $SU(N_f)_V$ invariant mass\nterm and the other the effects of the axial anomaly. We calculate the spectrum\nfor arbitrary $N_f$. Using preliminary and published lattice results from the\nLatKMI collaboration, we found combinations of the masses that vary slowly with\nthe explicit chiral symmetry breaking and $N_f$. This suggests that the anomaly\nterm plays a leading role in the mass spectrum and that simple formulas such as\n$M_\\sigma^2\\simeq (2/N_f-C_\\sigma)M_{\\eta '}^2$ should apply in the chiral\nlimit. Lattice measurements of $M_{\\eta '}^2$ and of approximate constants such\nas $C_\\sigma$ could help locating the boundary of the conformal window. We show\nthat our calculation can be adapted for arbitrary representations of the gauge\ngroup and in particular to the minimal model with two sextets, where similar\npatterns are likely to apply.\n", "  Under conditions prevailing in certain classes of compact astrophysical\nsystems, the active magnetosphere of a rotating black hole becomes\ncharge-starved, giving rise to formation of a spark gap in which plasma is\ncontinuously produced. The plasma production process is accompanied by\ncurvature and inverse Compton emission of gamma rays in the GeV-TeV band, that\nmay be detectable by current and future experiments. The properties of the gap\nemission have been studied recently using a fully general relativistic model of\na local steady gap. However, this model requires artificial adjustment of the\nelectric current which is determined, in reality, by the global properties of\nthe magnetosphere. In this paper we map the parameter regime in which steady\ngap solutions exist, using a steady-state gap model in Kerr geometry, and show\nthat such solutions are allowed only under restrictive conditions that may not\napply to most astrophysical systems. We further argue that even the allowed\nsolutions are inconsistent with the global magnetospheric structure. We\nconclude that magnetospheric gaps are inherently intermittent, and point out\nthat this may drastically change their emission properties.\n", "  The half-life of $^{19}$Ne has been measured using a real-time digital\nmultiparametric acquisition system providing an accurate time-stamp and\nrelevant information on the detectors signals for each decay event. An\nexhaustive offline analysis of the data gave unique access to experimental\neffects potentially biasing the measurement. After establishing the influence\nfactors impacting the measurement such as after-pulses, pile-up, gain and base\nline fluctuations, their effects were accurately estimated and the event\nselection optimized. The resulting half-life,\n$17.2569\\pm0.0019_{(stat)}\\pm0.0009_{(syst)}$~s, is the most precise up to now\nfor $^{19}$Ne. It is found in agreement with two recent precise measurements\nand not consistent with the most recent one [L.J. Broussard {\\it et al.}, Phys.\nRev. Lett. {\\bf112}, 212301 (2014)] by 3.0 standard deviations. The full\npotential of the technique for nuclei with half-lives of a few seconds is\ndiscussed.\n", "  The observations of solar photosphere from the ground encounter significant\nproblems due to the presence of Earth's turbulent atmosphere. Prior to applying\nimage reconstruction techniques, the frames obtained in most favorable\natmospheric conditions (so-called lucky frames) have to be carefully selected.\nHowever, the estimation of the quality of images containing complex\nphotospheric structures is not a trivial task and the standard routines applied\nin night-time Lucky Imaging observations are not applicable. In this paper we\nevaluate 36 methods dedicated for the assessment of image quality which were\npresented in the rich literature over last 40 years. We compare their\neffectiveness on simulated solar observations of both active regions and\ngranulation patches, using reference data obtained by the Solar Optical\nTelescope on the Hindoe satellite. To create the images affected by a known\ndegree of atmospheric degradation, we employ the Random Wave Vector method\nwhich faithfully models all the seeing characteristics. The results provide\nuseful information about the methods performance depending on the average\nseeing conditions expressed by the ratio of the telescope's aperture to the\nFried parameter, $D/r_0$. The comparison identifies three methods for\nconsideration by observers: Helmli and Scherer's Mean, Median Filter Gradient\nSimilarity, and Discrete Cosine Transform Energy Ratio. While the first one\nrequires less computational effort and can be used effectively virtually in any\natmospherics conditions, the second one shows its superiority at good seeing\n($D/r_0<4$). The last one should be considered mainly for the post-processing\nof strongly blurred images.\n", "  We calculate the branching ratios and polarization fractions of the $B \\to\na_1 b_1$ decays in the perturbative QCD(pQCD) approach at leading order, where\n$a_1$($b_1$) stands for the axial-vector $a_1(1260)[b_1(1235)]$ state. By\ncombining the phenomenological analyses with the perturbative calculations, we\nfind the following results: (a) the large decay rates around $10^{-5}$ to\n$10^{-6}$ of the $B \\to a_1 b_1$ decays dominated by the longitudinal\npolarization(except for the $B^+ \\to b_1^+ a_1^0$ mode) are predicted and\nbasically consistent with those in the QCD factorization(QCDF) within errors,\nwhich are expected to be tested by the Large Hadron Collider and Belle-II\nexperiments. The large $B^0 \\to a_1^0 b_1^0$ branching ratio could provide\nhints to help explore the mechanism of the color-suppressed decays. (b) the\nrather different QCD behaviors between the $a_1$ and $b_1$ mesons result in the\ndestructive(constructive) contributions in the nonfactorizable spectator\ndiagrams with $a_1(b_1)$ emission. Therefore, an interesting pattern of the\nbranching ratios appears for the color-suppressed $B^0 \\to a_1^0 a_1^0, a_1^0\nb_1^0,$ and $b_1^0 b_1^0$ modes in the pQCD approach, $Br(B^0 \\to b_1^0 b_1^0)\n> Br(B^0 \\to a_1^0 b_1^0) \\gtrsim Br(B^0 \\to a_1^0 a_1^0)$, which is different\nfrom $Br(B^0 \\to b_1^0 b_1^0) \\sim Br(B^0 \\to a_1^0 b_1^0) \\gtrsim Br(B^0 \\to\na_1^0 a_1^0)$ in the QCDF and would be verified at future experiments. (c) the\nlarge naive factorization breaking effects are observed in these $B \\to a_1\nb_1$ decays. Specifically, the large nonfactorizable spectator(weak\nannihilation) amplitudes contribute to the $B^0 \\to b_1^+ a_1^-(B^+ \\to a_1^+\nb_1^0\\; {\\rm and}\\; B^+ \\to b_1^+ a_1^0)$ mode(s), which demand confirmations\nvia the precise measurements.\n", "  Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) in combination\nwith density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to study the\nsurface and subsurface properties of the metastable phase of the phase change\nmaterial Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$ as grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The (111)\nsurface is covered by an intact Te layer, which nevertheless allows to detect\nthe more disordered subsurface layer made of Ge and Sb atoms. Centrally, we\nfind that the subsurface layer is significantly more ordered than expected for\nmetastable Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Te$_{5}$. Firstly, we show that vacancies are nearly\nabsent within the subsurface layer. Secondly, the potential fluctuation,\ntracked by the spatial variation of the valence band onset, is significantly\nless than expected for a random distribution of atoms and vacancies in the\nsubsurface layer. The strength of the fluctuation is compatible with the\npotential distribution of charged acceptors without being influenced by other\ntypes of defects. Thirdly, DFT calculations predict a partially tetrahedral Ge\nbonding within a disordered subsurface layer, exhibiting a clear fingerprint in\nthe local density of states as a peak close to the conduction band onset. This\npeak is absent in the STS data implying the absence of tetrahedral Ge, which is\nlikely due to the missing vacancies required for structural relaxation around\nthe shorter tetrahedral Ge bonds. Finally, isolated defect configurations with\na low density of $~10^{-4}$/nm$^2$ are identified by comparison of STM and DFT\ndata, which corroborates the significantly improved order in the epitaxial\nfilms driven by the build-up of vacancy layers.\n", "  In the 1-2.5 micron range, spectroscopic observations are made on the\nAcuA-spec asteroids, whose spectra were obtained in a continuous covered mode\nbetween 2.5-5.0 micron by AKARI. Based on the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy (DeMeo et al.\n2009, Icarus, 202, 160), all the AcuA-spec asteroids are classified, using the\npublished and our observational data. Additionally, taking advantage of the\nBus-DeMeo taxonomy characteristics, we constrain the characteristic each\nspectral type by combining the taxonomy results with the other physical\nobservational data from colorimetry, polarimetry, radar, and radiometry. As a\nresult, it is suggested that certain C-, Cb-, B-type, dark X-, and D-complex\nasteroids have spectral properties compatible with those of anhydrous\ninterplanetary dust particles with tiny bright material, such as water ice.\nThis supports the proposal regarding the C-complex asteroids (Vernazza et al.\n2015, ApJ, 806, 204; 2017, AJ, 153, 72). A combination of the Bus-DeMeo\ntaxonomy for AcuA-spec asteroids and the presumptions with other physical clues\nsuch as the polarimetric inversion angle, radar albedo, and mid-infrared\nspectroscopic spectra will be beneficial for surface material constraints, from\nthe AcuA-spec asteroid observations.\n", "  We introduce parametrizations of hadronic three-body $B$ and $D$ weak decay\namplitudes that can be readily implemented in experimental analyses and are a\nsound alternative to the simplistic and widely used sum of Breit-Wigner type\namplitudes, also known as the isobar model. These parametrizations can be\nparticularly useful in the interpretation of CP asymmetries in the Dalitz\nplots. They are derived from previous calculations based on a quasi-two-body\nfactorization approach in which two-body hadronic final state interactions are\nfully taken into account in terms of unitary $S$- and $P$-wave $\\pi\\pi$, $\\pi\nK$ and $K \\bar K$ form factors. These form factors can be determined\nrigorously, fulfilling fundamental properties of quantum field-theory\namplitudes such as analyticity and unitarity, and are in agreement with the\nlow-energy behaviour predicted by effective theories of QCD. They are derived\nfrom sets of coupled-channel equations using $T$-matrix elements constrained by\nexperimental meson-meson phase shifts and inelasticities, chiral symmetry and\nasymptotic QCD. We provide explicit amplitude expressions for the decays $B^\\pm\n\\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^\\pm$, $B \\to K \\ \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, $B^\\pm \\to K^+ K^-K^\\pm$,\n$D^+ \\to \\pi^- \\pi^+ \\pi^+ $, $D^+ \\to K^- \\pi^+ \\ \\pi^+ $, $D^0 \\to K^0_S \\\n\\pi^+\\ \\pi^- $, for which we have shown in previous studies that this approach\nis phenomenologically successful, in addition, we provide expressions for the\n$D^0 \\to K^0_S \\ K^+ K^-$ decay. Other three-body hadronic channels can be\nparametrized likewise.\n", "  We calculate the contribution of the non-perturbative Pauli couplings in the\nquark-photon and quark-gluon vertices to the single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). We describe the nucleon using\nthe spectator model with scalar and axial-vector diquarks. Both of the new\ncouplings can cause the helicity flip of the struck quark. The helicity flip\nand the rescattering induced by the non-perturbative gluon exchange between the\nstruck quark and diquark lead to the SSAs. Their azimuthal dependencies are the\nsame as that usually ascribed to the Collins and Sivers effects. Our numerical\nresults, based on the instanton model for the QCD vacuum, show that the\nnon-perturbative quark-gluon and quark-photon interactions have a strong\ninfluence on these asymmetries.\n", "  The development of novel quantum bits is key to extend the scope of\nsolid-state quantum information science and technology. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we propose that large metal ion - vacancy complexes are promising\nqubit candidates in two binary crystals: 4H-SiC and w-AlN. In particular, we\nfound that the formation of neutral Hf- and Zr-vacancy complexes is\nenergetically favorable in both solids; these defects have spin-triplet ground\nstates, with electronic structures similar to those of the diamond NV center\nand the SiC di-vacancy. Interestingly, they exhibit different spin-strain\ncoupling characteristics, and the nature of heavy metal ions may allow for easy\ndefect implantation in desired lattice locations and ensure stability against\ndefect diffusion. In order to support future experimental identification of the\nproposed defects, we report predictions of their optical zero-phonon line,\nzero-field splitting and hyperfine parameters. The defect design concept\nidentified here may be generalized to other binary semiconductors to facilitate\nthe exploration of new solid-state qubits.\n", "  Solvability of the ubiquitous quantum harmonic oscillator relies on a\nspectrum generating osp(1|2) superconformal symmetry. We study the problem of\nconstructing all quantum mechanical models with a hidden osp(1|2) symmetry on a\ngiven space of states. This problem stems from interacting higher spin models\ncoupled to gravity. In one dimension, we show that the solution to this problem\nis the Plyushchay family of quantum mechanical models with hidden\nsuperconformal symmetry obtained by viewing the harmonic oscillator as a one\ndimensional Dirac system, so that Grassmann parity equals wavefunction parity.\nThese models--both oscillator and particle-like--realize all possible unitary\nirreducible representations of osp(1|2).\n", "  Low-dimensional electron systems often show a delicate interplay between\nelectron-phonon and electron-electron interactions, giving rise to interesting\nquantum phases such as the charge density wave (CDW) and magnetism. Using the\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) calculations with the semilocal and hybrid\nexchange-correlation functionals as well as the exact-exchange plus correlation\nin the random-phase approximation (EX + cRPA), we systematically investigate\nthe ground state of the metallic atom wires containing dangling-bond (DB)\nelectrons, fabricated by partially hydrogenating the GaN(10${\\overline{1}}$0)\nand ZnO(10${\\overline{1}}$0) surfaces. We find that the CDW or\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) order has an electronic energy gain due to a band-gap\nopening, thereby being more stabilized compared to the metallic state. Our\nsemilocal DFT calculation predicts that both DB wires in\nGaN(10${\\overline{1}}$0) and ZnO(10${\\overline{1}}$0) have the same CDW ground\nstate, whereas the hybrid DFT and EX+cRPA calculations predict the AFM ground\nstate for the former DB wire and the CDW ground state for the latter one. It is\nrevealed that more localized Ga DB electrons in GaN(10${\\overline{1}}$0) prefer\nthe AFM order, while less localized Zn DB electrons in ZnO(10${\\overline{1}}$0)\nthe CDW formation. Our findings demonstrate that the drastically different\nground states are competing in the DB wires created on the two representative\ncompound semiconductor surfaces.\n", "  Planets in young clusters are powerful probes of the evolution of planetary\nsystems. Here we report the discovery of three planets transiting K2-136 (EPIC\n247589423), a late K dwarf in the Hyades (~800 Myr) cluster, and robust\ndetection limits for additional planets in the system. The planets were\nidentified from their K2 light curves, as part of our survey of young clusters\nand star forming regions. The smallest planet has a radius comparable to Earth\n(0.99 +/- 0.05 Earth radii), making it one of the few Earth-sized planets with\na known, young age. The two larger planets are likely a mini-Neptune and a\nsuper-Earth, with radii of 2.91+/-0.11 and 1.45+/-0.10 Earth radii,\nrespectively. The predicted radial velocity signals from these planets are\nbetween 0.4 and 2 m/s, achievable with modern precision RV spectrographs.\nBecause the target star is bright (V=11.2) and has relatively low-amplitude\nstellar variability for a young star (2-6 mmag), EPIC 247589423 hosts the best\nplanets known in a young open cluster for precise radial velocity follow-up,\nenabling a robust test of earlier claims that young planets are less dense than\ntheir older counterparts.\n", "  We develop nonequilibribrium Green's function based transport theory, which\nincludes effects of nonadiabatic nuclear motion in the calculation of the\nelectric current in molecular junctions. Our approach is based on the\nseparation of slow and fast timescales in the equations of motion for the\nGreen's functions by means of the Wigner representation. Time derivatives with\nrespect to central time serves as a small parameter in the perturbative\nexpansion enabling the computation of nonadiabatic corrections to molecular\nGreen's functions. Consequently, we produce series of analytic expressions for\nnon-adiabatic electronic Green's functions (up to the second order in the\ncentral time derivatives); which depend not solely on instantaneous molecular\ngeometry but likewise on nuclear velocities and accelerations. Extended formula\nfor electric current is derived which accounts for the non-adiabatic\ncorrections. This theory is concisely illustrated by the calculations on a\nmodel molecular junction.\n", "  We consider Casimir-Polder and Casimir forces with finite dissipation by\ncoupling heat baths to the dipoles introducing, this way, dissipation from\n'first principles'. We derive a representation of the free energy as an\nintegral over real frequencies, which can be viewd as an generalization of the\n'remarkable formula' introduced by Ford et. al. 1985. For instance, we obtain a\nnonperturbative representation for the atom-atom and atom-wall interactions. We\ninvestigate several limiting cases. From the limit $T\\to0$ we show that the\nthird law of thermodynamics cannot be violated within the given approach, where\nthe dissipation parameter cannot depend on temperature 'by construction'. We\nconclude, that the given approach is insufficient to resolve the thermodynamic\npuzzle connected with the Drude model when inserted into the Lifshitz formula.\nFurther we consider the transition to Matsubara representation and discuss\nmodifications of the contribution from the zeroth Matsubara frequency.\n", "  Background: Applications of nuclear time-dependent density functional theory\n(TDDFT) are often capable of providing quantitative description of heavy ion\nreactions. However, the structure of pre-compound states produced in heavy ion\nreactions are difficult to assess theoretically in TDDFT as the s.p. density\nalone is a weak indicator of shell structure and cluster states. Purpose: We\nemploy the time-dependent nucleon localization function (NLF) to reveal\nstructure of pre-compound states in nuclear reactions involving light and\nmedium-mass ions. We primarily focus on spin saturated systems with N = Z.\nFurthermore, we study reactions with oxygen and carbon ions, for which\nexperimental evidence for {\\alpha} clustering in pre-compound states exists.\nMethod: We utilize the symmetry-free TDDFT approach and compute the NLFs to\ndescribe $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{40}$Ca, and\n$^{16,18}$O + $^{12}$C collisions at energies above the Coulomb barrier.\nResults: We show that NLFs reveal a variety of time-dependent modes involving\ncluster structures. For instance, the $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O collision results in\na vibrational mode of a quasi-molecular \\alpha-$^{12}$C-$^{12}$C-\\alpha{}\nstate. For heavier ions, a variety of cluster configurations are predicted. For\nthe collision of $^{16,18}$O + $^{12}$C, we showed that the pre-compound system\nhas a tendency to form {\\alpha} clusters. This result supports the experimental\nfindings that the presence of cluster structures in the projectile and target\nnuclei gives rise to strong entrance channel effects and enhanced {\\alpha}\nemission. Conclusion: The time-dependent NLF is a good indicator of clusters\nstructures in complex pre-compound states formed in heavy-ion fusion reactions.\nThe localization reveals the presence of collective vibrations involving\ncluster structures, which dominate the initial dynamics of the fusing system.\n", "  Certain bulk properties of neutron stars, in particular their moment of\ninertia, rotational quadrupole moment and tidal Love number, when properly\nnormalized, are related to one another in a nearly equation of state\nindependent way. The goal of this paper is to test these relations with extreme\nequations of state at supranuclear densities constrained to satisfy only a\nhandful of generic, physically sensible conditions. By requiring that the\nequation of state be (i) barotropic and (ii) its associated speed of sound be\nreal, we construct a piecewise function that matches a tabulated equation of\nstate at low densities, while matching a stiff equation of state parametrized\nby its sound speed in the high-density region. We show that the I-Love-Q\nrelations hold to 1 percent with this class of equations of state, even in the\nextreme case where the speed of sound becomes superluminal and independently of\nthe transition density. We also find further support for the interpretation of\nthe I-Love-Q relations as an emergent symmetry due to the nearly constant\neccentricity of isodensity contours inside the star. These results reinforce\nthe robustness of the I-Love-Q relations against our current incomplete picture\nof physics at supranuclear densities, while strengthening our confidence in the\napplicability of these relations in neutron star astrophysics.\n", "  In a framework where galaxies form hierarchically, extended stellar haloes\nare predicted to be an ubiquitous feature around Milky Way-like galaxies and to\nconsist mainly of the shredded stellar component of smaller galactic systems.\nThe type of accreted stellar systems are expected to vary according to the\nspecific accretion and merging history of a given galaxy, and so is the\nfraction of stars formed in-situ versus accreted. Analysis of the chemical\nproperties of Milky Way halo stars out to large Galactocentric radii can\nprovide important insights into the properties of the environment in which the\nstars that contributed to the build-up of different regions of the Milky Way\nstellar halo formed. In this work we focus on the outer regions of the Milky\nWay stellar halo, by determining chemical abundances of halo stars with large\npresent-day Galactocentric distances, $>$15 kpc. The data-set we acquired\nconsists of high resolution HET/HRS, Magellan/MIKE and VLT/UVES spectra for 28\nred giant branch stars covering a wide metallicity range, $-3.1\n\\lesssim$[Fe/H]$\\lesssim -0.6$. We show that the ratio of $\\alpha$-elements\nover Fe as a function of [Fe/H] for our sample of outer halo stars is not\ndissimilar from the pattern shown by MW halo stars from solar neighborhood\nsamples. On the other hand, significant differences appear at [Fe/H]$\\gtrsim\n-1.5$ when considering chemical abundance ratios such as [Ba/Fe], [Na/Fe],\n[Ni/Fe], [Eu/Fe], [Ba/Y]. Qualitatively, this type of chemical abundance trends\nare observed in massive dwarf galaxies, such as Sagittarius and the Large\nMagellanic Cloud. This appears to suggest a larger contribution in the outer\nhalo of stars formed in an environment with high initial star formation rate\nand already polluted by asymptotic giant branch stars with respect to inner\nhalo samples.\n", "  The Sun shows a global magnetic field cycle traditionally best visible in the\nphotosphere as a changing sunspot cycle featuring roughly an 11 year period. In\naddition we know that our host star also harbours small-scale magnetic fields\noften seen as strong concentrations of magnetic flux reaching kG field\nstrengths. These features are situated in inter-granular lanes where they show\nup bright as so-called magnetic bright points (MBPs). In this short paper we\nwish to analyse a homogenous nearly 10 year long synoptic Hinode image data set\nrecorded from November 2006 up to February 2016 in the G-band to inspect the\nrelationship between the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre and the\nrelative sunspot number.\n  Our findings suggest that indeed the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre\nis correlated to the relative sunspot number, but with the particular feature\nof showing two different temporal shifts between the decreasing phase of cycle\n23 including the minimum and the increasing phase of cycle 24 including the\nmaximum. While the former is shifted by about 22 months the later is only\nshifted by less than 12 months. Moreover, we introduce and discuss an\nanalytical model to predict the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre purely\ndepending on the evolution of the relative sunspot number as well as the\ntemporal change of the relative sunspot number and two background parameters\ndescribing a possibly acting surface dynamo as well as the strength of the\nmagnetic field diffusion. Finally, we are able to confirm the plausibility of\nthe temporal shifts by a simplistic random walk model.\n  The main conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the injection of\nmagnetic flux, coming from active regions as represented by sunspots, happens\non faster time scales than the removal of small-scale magnetic flux elements\nlater on.\n", "  The fraction of Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters among the galaxy population has been\nfound to increase from $z\\sim0$ to $z\\sim6$ and drop dramatically at $z>6$.\nThis drop has been interpreted as an effect of an increasingly neutral\nintergalactic medium with increasing redshift, while a LyC escape fraction\nevolving with redshift. We report the result of a large VLT/FORS2 program\naiming to confirm spectroscopically a large galaxy sample at $z\\geq6$ that has\nbeen selected in several independent fields through the Lyman Break technique.\nCombining those data with archival data, we create a large and homogeneous\nsample of $z\\sim6$ galaxies ($N=127$), complete in terms of Ly$\\alpha$\ndetection at $>95\\%$ for EW(Ly$\\alpha)\\geq25\\AA$. We use this sample to derive\na new measurement of the LAE fraction at $z\\sim6$ and derive the physical\nproperties of these galaxies through spectral energy distribution fitting. We\nfind a median LAE fraction at $z\\sim6$ lower than in previous studies. The main\ndifference between LAEs and non-LAEs is that the latter are significantly\ndustier. Using predictions of our SED fitting code accounting for nebular\nemission, we find an effective Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction\n$f^{eff}_{esc}(Ly\\alpha)=0.23^{+0.36}_{-0.17}$ remarkably consistent with the\nvalue derived by comparing UV luminosity function with Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity\nfunction. We conclude that the drop in the LAE fraction from $z\\sim6$ to $z>6$\nis less dramatic than previously found and the effect of an increasing IGM\nneutral fraction is possibly observed at $5<z<6$. Based on our derived\n$f^{eff}_{esc}(Ly\\alpha)$, we find that the IGM has a relatively small impact\non Ly$\\alpha$ photon visibility at $z\\sim6$, with a lower limit for the IGM\ntransmission to \\lya\\ photons, $T_{IGM}\\gtrsim0.20$, likely due to the presence\nof outflows. [abdridged]\n", "  We have acquired radio continuum data between 70\\,MHz and 48\\,GHz for a\nsample of 19 southern starburst galaxies at moderate redshifts ($0.067 < z <\n0.227$) with the aim of separating synchrotron and free-free emission\ncomponents. Using a Bayesian framework we find the radio continuum is rarely\ncharacterised well by a single power law, instead often exhibiting low\nfrequency turnovers below 500\\,MHz, steepening at mid-to-high frequencies, and\na flattening at high frequencies where free-free emission begins to dominate\nover the synchrotron emission. These higher order curvature components may be\nattributed to free-free absorption across multiple regions of star formation\nwith varying optical depths. The decomposed synchrotron and free-free emission\ncomponents in our sample of galaxies form strong correlations with the\ntotal-infrared bolometric luminosities. Finally, we find that without\naccounting for free-free absorption with turnovers between 90 to 500\\,MHz the\nradio-continuum at low frequency ($\\nu < 200$\\,MHz) could be overestimated by\nupwards of a factor of twelve if a simple power law extrapolation is used from\nhigher frequencies. The mean synchrotron spectral index of our sample is\nconstrained to be $\\alpha=-1.06$, which is steeper then the canonical value of\n$-0.8$ for normal galaxies. We suggest this may be caused by an intrinsically\nsteeper cosmic ray distribution.\n", "  Motivated by recent observational constraints on dust reprocessed emission in\nstar forming galaxies at $z\\sim 6$ and above we use the very-large cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation \\bluetides\\ to explore predictions for the amount of\ndust obscured star formation in the early Universe ($z>8$). \\bluetides\\ matches\ncurrent observational constraints on both the UV luminosity function and galaxy\nstellar mass function and predicts that approximately $90\\%$ of the star\nformation in high-mass ($M_{*}>10^{10}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) galaxies at $z=8$ is\nalready obscured by dust. The relationship between dust attenuation and stellar\nmass predicted by \\bluetides\\ is consistent with that observed at lower\nredshift. However, observations of several individual objects at $z>6$ are\ndiscrepant with the predictions, though it is possible their uncertainties may\nhave been underestimated. We find that the predicted surface density of $z\\ge\n8$ sub-mm sources is below that accessible to current {\\em Herschel}, SCUBA-2,\nand ALMA sub-mm surveys. However, as ALMA continues to accrue additional\nsurface area the population of $z>8$ dust-obscured galaxies may become\naccessible in the near future.\n", "  The observation of GeV neutrinos coming from the Sun would be an unmistakable\nsignal of dark matter. Current neutrino detectors have so far failed to detect\nsuch a signal, however, and bounds from direct and indirect dark matter\nsearches may significantly restrict the possibility of observing it in future\nexperiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande or IceCube-Gen2. In this work, we assess\nin the light of current data and of expected experimental sensitivities, the\nprospects for the detection of a neutrino signal from dark matter annihilations\nin the Sun. To be as general as possible, equilibrium between the capture and\nthe annihilation rates in the Sun is not assumed in our analysis; instead, the\ndark matter scattering and annihilation cross sections are taken as free and\nindependent parameters. We consider capture via both spin-dependent and\nspin-independent interactions, and annihilations into three representative\nfinal states: $b\\bar b$, $W^+W^-$, and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$. We find that when the\ncapture in the Sun is dominated by spin-independent interactions, current\ndirect detection bounds already preclude the observation of a neutrino signal\nin future experiments. For capture via spin-dependent interactions, a strong\ncomplementarity is observed, over most of the parameter space, between future\nneutrino detectors and planned direct and indirect dark matter detection\nexperiments, such as PICO-500 and CTA. In this case, we also identify some\nregions of the parameter space that can be probed, via the neutrino flux from\nthe Sun, only by future neutrino experiments.\n", "  High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy provide unique constraints for\nexoplanet formation models as well as for planetary atmosphere models.\nInstrumentation techniques in this field have greatly improved over the last\ntwo decades, with the development of stellar coronagraphy, in parallel with\nspecific methods of wavefront sensing and control. Next generation space- and\nground-based telescopes will allow the characterization cold solar-system like\nplanets for the first time and maybe even in situ detection of bio-markers.\nHowever, the growth of primary mirror diameters, necessary for these detection,\ncomes with an increase of their complexity (segmentation, secondary mirror\nfeatures). These discontinuities in the aperture can greatly limit the\nperformance of coronagraphic instruments. In this context, we introduced a new\ntechnique, Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities - Optimized Stroke\nMinimization (ACAD-OSM), to correct for the diffractive effects of aperture\ndiscontinuities in the final image plane of a coronagraph, using deformable\nmirrors. In this paper, we present several tools that can be used to optimize\nthe performance of this technique for its application to future large missions.\nIn particular, we analyze the influence of the deformable setup (size and\nseparating distance) and found that there is an optimal point for this setup,\noptimizing the performance of the instrument in contrast and throughput while\nminimizing the strokes applied to the deformable mirrors. These results will\nhelp us design future coronagraphic instruments to obtain the best performance.\n", "  Polarimetric studies of light transmitted through interstellar clouds may\ngive constraints on the properties of the interstellar dust grains.\nTraditionally, broadband linear polarisation (BBLP) measurements have been\nconsidered an important diagnostic tool for the study of the interstellar dust,\nwhile comparatively less attention has been paid to spectropolarimetric\nmeasurements. However, spectropolarimetry may offer stronger constraints than\nBBLP, for example by revealing narrowband features, and by allowing us to\ndistinguish the contribution of dust from the contribution of interstellar gas.\nTherefore, we have decided to carry out a Large Interstellar Polarisation\nSurvey (LIPS) using spectropolarimetric facilities in both hemispheres. Here we\npresent the results obtained in the Southern Hemisphere with the FORS2\ninstrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope. Our spectra cover the wavelength\nrange 380--950\\,nm at a spectral resolving power of about 880. We have produced\na publicly available catalogue of 127 linear polarisation spectra of 101\ntargets. We also provide the Serkowski-curve parameters, as well as the\nwavelength gradient of the polarisation position angle for the interstellar\npolarisation along 76 different lines of sight. In agreement with previous\nliterature, we found that the best-fit parameters of the Serkowski-curve are\nnot independent of each other. However, the relationships that we obtained are\nnot always consistent with what was found in previous studies.\n", "  Cosmic rays have extremely high particle energies (up to $10^{20} \\;\n\\text{eV}$) and can be used to search for violations of Lorentz invariance. We\nconsider isotropic nonbirefringent Lorentz violation in the photon sector for\nthe case of a photon velocity larger than the maximum attainable velocity of\nthe standard fermions. Up to now, Earth-based bounds on this type of Lorentz\nviolation have been determined from observations of TeV gamma rays. Here, we\nelaborate on a novel approach to test Lorentz invariance with greatly improved\nsensitivity. This approach is based on investigating extensive air showers\nwhich are induced by cosmic-ray particles in the Earth's atmosphere. We study\nthe impact of two Lorentz-violating decay processes on the longitudinal\ndevelopment of air showers, notably the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum\n$X_\\text{max}$. Specifically, the two Lorentz-violating decay processes\nconsidered are photon decay into an electron-positron pair and modified\nneutral-pion decay into two photons. We use Monte Carlo simulations performed\nwith the CONEX code which was extended to include these two Lorentz-violating\ndecay processes at a magnitude allowed by the best previous Earth-based bound.\nCompared to standard physics, these Lorentz-violating decay processes reduce\nthe average $X_\\text{max}$ for showers with primary energies above\n$10^{18}\\;\\text{eV}$ by an amount that is significantly larger than the average\nresolution of current air shower experiments. Comparing the simulations of the\naverage $X_\\text{max}$ to observations, new Earth-based bounds on this type of\nLorentz violation are obtained, which are better than the previous bounds by\nmore than three orders of magnitude. Prospects of further studies are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We employ newly computed grids of spectra reprocessed by dust for estimating\nthe total dust production rate (DPR) of carbon stars in the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC). For the first time, the grids of spectra are computed as a\nfunction of the main stellar parameters, i.e. mass-loss rate, luminosity,\neffective temperature, current stellar mass and element abundances at the\nphotosphere, following a consistent, physically grounded scheme of dust growth\ncoupled with stationary wind outflow. The model accounts for the dust growth of\nvarious dust species formed in the circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars,\nsuch as carbon dust, silicon carbide and metallic iron. In particular, we\nemploy some selected combinations of optical constants and grain sizes for\ncarbon dust which have been shown to reproduce simultaneously the most relevant\ncolor-color diagrams in the SMC. By employing our grids of models, we fit the\nspectral energy distributions of $\\approx$3100 carbon stars in the SMC,\nconsistently deriving some important dust and stellar properties, i.e.\nluminosities, mass-loss rates, gas-to-dust ratios, expansion velocities and\ndust chemistry. We discuss these properties and we compare some of them with\nobservations in the Galaxy and LMC. We compute the DPR of carbon stars in the\nSMC, finding that the estimates provided by our method can be significantly\ndifferent, between a factor $\\approx2-5$, than the ones available in the\nliterature. Our grids of models, including the spectra and other relevant dust\nand stellar quantities, are publicly available at\nhttp://starkey.astro.unipd.it/web/guest/dustymodels\n", "  In this work we explore a new cosmological solution for an universe filled\nwith one dissipative fluid, described by a barotropic EoS $p = \\omega \\rho$, in\nthe framework of the full Israel-Stewart theory. The form of the bulk viscosity\nhas been assumed of the form $\\xi = \\xi_{0}\\rho^{1/2}$. The relaxation time is\ntaken to be a function of the EoS, the bulk viscosity and the speed of bulk\nviscous perturbations, $c_{b}$. The solution presents an initial singularity,\nwhere the curvature scalar diverges as the scale factor goes to zero. Depending\non the values for $\\omega$, $\\xi_{0}$, $c_{b}$ accelerated and decelerated\ncosmic expansion can be obtained. In the case of accelerated expansion, the\nviscosity drives the effective EoS to be of quintessence type, for the single\nfluid with positive pressure. Nevertheless, we show that only the solution with\ndecelerated expansion satisfies the thermodynamics conditions $dS/dt > 0$\n(growth of the entropy) and $d^{2}S/dt^{2} < 0$ (convexity condition). We show\nthat an exact stiff matter EoS is not allowed in the framework of the full\ncausal thermodynamic approach; and in the case of a EoS very close to the stiff\nmatter regime, we found that dissipative effects becomes negligible so the\nentropy remains constant. Finally, we show numerically that the solution is\nstable under small perturbations.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength investigation of the HII region G25.8700+0.1350,\nlocated in the inner part of the Galaxy. In radio continuum emission, the\nregion is seen as a bright arc-shaped structure. An analysis of the HI line\nsuggests that G25.8700+0.1350 lies at a distance of 6.5 kpc. The ionized gas is\nbordered by a photodissociation region which is encircled by a molecular\nstructure where four molecular clumps are detected. At infrared wavelengths,\nthe region is also very conspicuous. Given the high level of visual absorption\nin the region, the exciting stars should be searched for in the infrared band.\nIn this context, we found in the literature one Wolf-Rayet and one red\nsupergiant which, together with 37 2MASS sources candidates to be O-type stars,\ncould be related to the origin of G25.8700+0.1350. Finally, as expanding HII\nregions are hypothesized to trigger star formation, we used different infrared\npoint source catalogues to search for young stellar object candidates (cYSOs).\nA total of 45 cYSOs were identified projected onto the molecular clouds.\n", "  We use linked-cluster expansions to analyze the quantum phase transitions\nbetween symmetry unbroken trivial and topological Haldane phases in two\ndifferent spin-one chains. The first model is the spin-one Heisenberg chain in\nthe presence of a single-ion anisotropy while the second one is the dimerized\nspin-one Heisenberg chain. For both models we determine the ground-state energy\nand the one-particle gap inside the non-topological phase as a high-order\nseries using perturbative continuous unitary transformations. Extrapolations of\nthe gap series are applied to locate the quantum critical point and to extract\nthe associated critical exponent. We find that this approach works\nunsatisfactory for the anisotropic chain, since the quality of the\nextrapolation appears insufficient due to the large correlation length\nexponent. In contrast, extrapolation schemes display very good convergence for\nthe gap closing in the case of the dimerized spin-one Heisenberg chain.\n", "  Multiwavelength deep observations are a key tool to understand the origin of\nthe diffuse light in clusters of galaxies: the intra-cluster light (ICL). For\nthis reason, we take advantage of the Hubble Frontier Fields survey to\ninvestigate the properties of the stellar populations of the ICL of its 6\nmassive intermediate redshift (0.3<z<0.6) clusters. We carry on this analysis\ndown to a radial distance of ~120 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy. We\nfound that the average metallicity of the ICL is [Fe/H] ~-0.5, compatible with\nthe value of the outskirts of the Milky Way. The mean stellar ages of the ICL\nare between 2 to 6 Gyr younger than the most massive galaxies of the clusters.\nThose results suggest that the ICL of these massive (> 10^15 Msol) clusters is\nformed by the stripping of MW-like objects that have been accreted at z<1, in\nagreement with current simulations. We do not find any significant increase in\nthe fraction of light of the ICL with cosmic time, although the redshift range\nexplored is narrow to derive any strong conclusion. When exploring the slope of\nthe stellar mass density profile, we found that the ICL of the HFF clusters\nfollows the shape of their underlying dark matter haloes, in agreement with the\nidea that the ICL is the result of the stripping of galaxies at recent times.\n", "  Using a Multiple Scattering Theory algorithm, we investigate numerically the\ntransmission of ultrasonic waves through a disordered locally resonant\nmetamaterial containing only monopolar resonators. By comparing the cases of a\nperfectly random medium with its pair correlated counterpart, we show that the\nintroduction of short range correlation can substantially impact the effective\nparameters of the sample. We report, notably, the opening of an acoustic\ntransparency window in the region of the hybridization band gap. Interestingly,\nthe transparency window is found to be associated with negative values of both\neffective compressibility and density. Despite this feature being unexpected\nfor a disordered medium of monopolar resonators, we show that it can be fully\ndescribed analytically and that it gives rise to negative refraction of waves.\n", "  We present a multi-component structural analysis of the internal structure of\n$1074$ high redshift massive galaxies at $1<z<3$ from the CANDELS HST Survey.\nIn particular we examine galaxies best-fit by two structural components, and\nthus likely forming discs and bulges. We examine the stellar mass, star\nformation rates, and colours of both the inner `bulge' and outer `disc'\ncomponents for these systems using SED information from the resolved ACS+WFC3\nHST imaging. We find that the majority of both inner and outer components lie\nin the star-forming region of UVJ space ($68$ and $90$ per cent respectively).\nHowever, the inner portions, or the likely forming bulges, are dominated by\ndusty star formation. Furthermore, we show that the outer components of these\nsystems have a higher star formation rate than their inner regions, and the\nratio of star formation rate between `disc' and `bulge' increases at lower\nredshifts. Despite the higher star formation rate of the outer component, the\nstellar mass ratio of inner to outer component remains constant through this\nepoch. This suggests that there is mass transfer from the outer to inner\ncomponents for typical two component forming systems, thus building bulges from\ndisks. Finally, using Chandra data we find that the presence of an AGN is more\ncommon in both $1$-component spheroid-like galaxies and $2$-component systems\n($13\\pm3$ and $11\\pm2$ per cent) than in $1$-component disc-like galaxies\n($3\\pm1$ per cent), demonstrating that the formation of a central\ninner-component likely triggers the formation of central massive black holes in\nthese galaxies.\n", "  We study the presence of tidal features associated with ultra diffuse\ngalaxies (UDGs) in galaxy clusters. Specifically, we stack deep Subaru images\nof UDGs in the Coma cluster to determine whether they show position angle\ntwists at large radii. Selecting galaxies with central surface brightness\n(g-band) >24 magarcsec^{-2} and projected half-light radius >1.5 kpc, we\nidentify 287 UDGs in the Yagi et al. 2016 catalog of low surface brightness\nComa objects. The UDGs have apparent spheroidal shapes with median Sersic index\n~ 0.8 and median axis-ratio ~ 0.7. The images are processed by masking all\nbackground objects and rotating to align the major axis before stacking them in\nbins of properties such as axis ratio, angle of major axis with respect to the\ncluster center and separation from cluster center. Our image stacks reach\nfurther than 7 kpc (~4r_e). Analysis of the isophotes of the stacks reveal that\nthe ellipticity remains constant up to the last measured point, which means\nthat the individual galaxies have a non-varying position angle and axis ratio\nand show no evidence for tidal disruption out to ~ 4r_e. We demonstrate this\nexplicitly by comparing our stacks with stacks of model UDGs with and without\ntidal features in their outskirts. We infer that the average tidal radius of\nthe Coma UDGs is >7 kpc and estimate that the average dark matter fraction\nwithin the tidal radius of the UDGs inhabiting the innermost 0.5 Mpc of Coma is\n> 99%.\n", "  Using new APEX and JCMT spectroscopy of the CO 2-1 line, we undertake a\ncontrolled study of cold molecular gas in moderately luminous Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) and inactive galaxies from the Luminous Local AGN with Matched\nAnalogs (LLAMA) survey. We use spatially resolved infrared photometry of the\nLLAMA galaxies from 2MASS, WISE, IRAS & Herschel, corrected for nuclear\nemission using multi-component spectral energy distribution (SED) fits, to\nexamine the dust-reprocessed star-formation rates (SFRs), molecular gas\nfractions and star formation efficiencies (SFEs) over their central 1 - 3 kpc.\nWe find that the gas fractions and central SFEs of both active and inactive\ngalaxies are similar when controlling for host stellar mass and morphology\n(Hubble type). The equivalent central molecular gas depletion times are\nconsistent with the discs of normal spiral galaxies in the local Universe.\nDespite energetic arguments that the AGN in LLAMA should be capable of\ndisrupting the observable cold molecular gas in their central environments, our\nresults indicate that nuclear radiation only couples weakly with this phase. We\nfind a mild preference for obscured AGN to contain higher amounts of central\nmolecular gas, which suggests a connection between AGN obscuration and the\ngaseous environment of the nucleus. Systems with depressed SFEs are not found\namong the LLAMA AGN. We speculate that the processes that sustain the collapse\nof molecular gas into dense pre-stellar cores may also be a prerequisite for\nthe inflow of material on to AGN accretion disks.\n", "  The first hydrostatic core (FHSC) is the first stable object to form in\nsimulations of star formation. This stage has yet to be observed definitively,\nalthough several candidate FHSCs have been reported. We have produced synthetic\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 3D hydrodynamical simulations of\npre-stellar cores undergoing gravitational collapse for a variety of initial\nconditions. Variations in the initial rotation rate, radius and mass lead to\ndifferences in the location of the SED peak and far-infrared flux. Secondly, we\nattempt to fit the SEDs of five FHSC candidates from the literature and five\nnewly identified FHSC candidates located in the Serpens South molecular cloud\nwith simulated SEDs. The most promising FHSC candidates are fitted by a limited\nnumber of model SEDs with consistent properties, which suggests the SED can be\nuseful for placing constraints on the age and rotation rate of the source. The\nsources we consider most likely to be in FHSC phase are B1-bN, CB17-MMS,\nAqu-MM1 and Serpens South candidate K242. We were unable to fit SerpS-MM22,\nPer-Bolo 58 and Chamaeleon-MMS1 with reasonable parameters, which indicates\nthat they are likely to be more evolved.\n", "  We report results of 6.7 GHz methanol maser monitoring of 139 star-forming\nsites with the Torun 32 m radio telescope from June 2009 to February 2013. The\ntargets were observed at least once a month, with higher cadences of 2-4\nmeasurements per week for circumpolar objects. Nearly 80 percent of the sources\ndisplay variability greater than 10 per cent on a time-scale between a week and\na few years but about three quarters of the sample have only 1-3 spectral\nfeatures which vary significantly. Irregular intensity fluctuation is the\ndominant type of variability and only nine objects show evidence for cyclic\nvariations with periods of 120 to 416 d. Synchronised and anti-correlated\nvariations of maser features are detected in four sources with a disc-like\nmorphology. Rapid and high amplitude bursts of individual features are seen on\n3-5 occasions in five sources. Long (>50 d to 20 months) lasting bursts are\nobserved mostly for individual or groups of features in 19 sources and only one\nsource experienced a remarkable global flare. A few flaring features display a\nstrong anti-correlation between intensity and line-width that is expected for\nunsaturated amplification. There is a weak anti-correlation between the maser\nfeature luminosity and variability measure, i.e. maser features with low\nluminosity tend to be more variable than those with high luminosity. The\nanalysis of the spectral energy distribution and continuum radio emission\nreveals that the variability of the maser features increases when the\nbolometric luminosity and Lyman flux of the exciting object decreases. Our\nresults support the concept of a major role for infrared pumping photons in\ntriggering outburst activity of maser emission.\n", "  Studies of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies in nearby clusters have\nrevealed a sub-population of extremely diffuse galaxies with central surface\nbrightness $\\mu_{0,g'}$ > 24 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and effective radius between 1.5\nkpc < R$_{e}$ < 10 kpc. The origin of these Ultra Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) is\nstill unclear, although several theories have been suggested. We exploit the\ndeep g', r' and i'-band images of the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), in order to\nidentify LSB galaxies in the center of the Fornax cluster. We identified\nvisually all extended structures having r'-band central surface brightness of\n$\\mu_{0,r'}$ > 23 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We classified the objects based on their\nappearance and performed 2D S\\'ersic model fitting with GALFIT. We analyzed\ntheir distribution and orientations in the cluster, and studied their colors\nand compared the LSB galaxies in Fornax with those in other environments. Our\nsample consists of 205 galaxies of which 196 are LSB dwarfs (with R$_e$ <\n1.5kpc) and nine are UDGs (R$_e$ > 1.5 kpc). We show that the UDGs have g'-r'\ncolors similar to those of LSB dwarfs. The largest UDGs in our sample appear\ndifferent from the other LSB galaxies, in that they are significantly more\nelongated and extended, whereas the smaller UDGs differ from the LSB dwarfs\nonly by their effective radii. We do not find clear differences between the\nstructural parameters of the UDGs in our sample and those of UDGs in other\ngalaxy environments. We find that the dwarf LSB galaxies in our sample are less\nconcentrated in the cluster center than the galaxies with higher surface\nbrightness, and that their number density drops in the core of the cluster. Our\nfindings are consistent with the small UDGs forming the tail of a continuous\ndistribution of less extended LSB galaxies. However, the elongated and\ndistorted shapes of the large UDGs could imply that they are tidally disturbed\ngalaxies.\n", "  The origin and survival of the Smith high-velocity HI cloud has so far defied\nexplanation. This object has several remarkable properties: (i) its prograde\norbit is ~100 km/s faster than the underlying Galactic rotation; (ii) its total\ngas mass ($\\gtrsim 4 \\times 10^6 ~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) exceeds the mass of all\nother high-velocity clouds (HVC) outside of the Magellanic Stream; (iii) its\nhead-tail morphology extends to the Galactic HI disc, indicating some sort of\ninteraction. The Smith Cloud's kinetic energy rules out models based on\nejection from the disc. We construct a dynamically self-consistent, multi-phase\nmodel of the Galaxy with a view to exploring whether the Smith Cloud can be\nunderstood in terms of an infalling, compact HVC that has transited the\nGalactic disc. We show that while a dark-matter (DM) free HVC of sufficient\nmass and density can reach the disc, it does not survive the transit. The most\nimportant ingredient to survival during a transit is a confining DM subhalo\naround the cloud; radiative gas cooling and high spatial resolution ($\\lesssim$\n10 pc) are also essential. In our model, the cloud develops a head-tail\nmorphology within ~10 Myr before and after its first disc crossing; after the\nevent, the tail is left behind and accretes onto the disc within ~400 Myr. In\nour interpretation, the Smith Cloud corresponds to a gas 'streamer' that\ndetaches, falls back and fades after the DM subhalo, distorted by the disc\npassage, has moved on. We conclude that subhalos with ${\\rm M}_{\\rm DM}\n\\lesssim 10^9 ~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ have accreted $\\sim10^9 ~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ of\ngas into the Galaxy over cosmic time - a small fraction of the total baryon\nbudget.\n", "  We explore simple semi-analytic fits to the bolometric light curve of\nGaia17biu/SN 2017egm, the most nearby hydrogen-deficient superluminous\nsupernova (SLSN I) yet discovered. SN 2017egm has a quasi-bolometric light\ncurve that is uncharacteristic of other SLSN I by having a nearly linear rise\nto maximum and decline from peak, with a very sharp transition. Magnetar models\nhave difficulty explaining the sharp peak and may tend to be too bright 20 d\nafter maximum. Light curves powered only by radioactive decay of nickel fail on\nsimilar grounds and because they demand greater nickel mass than ejecta mass.\nSimple models based on circumstellar interaction do have a sharp peak\ncorresponding to the epoch when the forward shock breaks out of the\noptically-thick circumstellar medium or the reverse shock reaches the inside of\nthe ejecta. We find that models based on circumstellar interaction with a\nconstant-density shell provide an interesting fit to the bolometric light curve\nfrom 15 d before to 15 d after peak light of SN 2017egm and that both magnetar\nand radioactive decay models fail to fit the sharp peak. Future photometric\nobservations should easily discriminate basic CSI models from basic magnetar\nmodels. The implications of a CSI model are briefly discussed.\n", "  Simulations generally show that non-self-gravitating clouds have a lognormal\ncolumn density ($\\Sigma$) probability distribution function (PDF), while\nself-gravitating clouds with active star formation develop a distinct power-law\ntail at high column density. Although the growth of the power law can be\nattributed to gravitational contraction leading to the formation of condensed\ncores, it is often debated if an observed lognormal shape is a direct\nconsequence of supersonic turbulence alone, or even if it is really observed in\nmolecular clouds. In this paper we run three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations including ambipolar diffusion with different initial conditions to\nsee the effect of strong magnetic fields and nonlinear initial velocity\nperturbations on the evolution of the column density PDFs. Our simulations show\nthat column density PDFs of clouds with supercritical mass-to-flux ratio, with\neither linear perturbations or nonlinear turbulence, quickly develop a\npower-law tail such that $dN/d \\log \\Sigma \\propto \\Sigma^{-\\alpha}$ with index\n$\\alpha \\simeq 2$. Interestingly, clouds with subcritical mass-to-flux ratio\nalso proceed directly to a power-law PDF, but with a much steeper index $\\alpha\n\\simeq 4$. This is a result of gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion.\nHowever, for nonlinear perturbations with a turbulent spectrum ($v_{k}^{2}\n\\propto k^{-4}$), the column density PDFs of subcritical clouds do retain a\nlognormal shape for a major part of the cloud evolution, and only develop a\ndistinct power-law tail with index $\\alpha \\simeq 2$ at greater column density\nwhen supercritical pockets are formed.\n", "  We report the design of silica-based 1D phononic crystals (PnCs) with\ntopologically distinct complete phononic bandgaps (PnBGs) and the observation\nof a topologically protected state of elastic waves at their interface. By\nchoosing different structural parameters of unit cells, two PnCs can possess a\ncommon PnBG with different topological nature. At the interface between the two\nPnCs, a topological interface mode with a quality factor of ~5,650 is observed\nin the PnBG. Spatial confinement of the interface mode is also confirmed by\nusing photoelastic imaging technique. Such topologically protected elastic\nstates are potentially applicable for constructing novel phononic devices.\n", "  On 17 August 2017, a gravitational wave event (GW170817) and an associated\nshort gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) from a binary neutron star merger had been\ndetected. The followup optical/infrared observations also identified the\nmacronova/kilonova emission (AT2017gfo). In this work we discuss some\nimplications of the remarkable GW170817/GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo association. We\nshow that the $\\sim 1.7$s time delay between the gravitational wave (GW) and\nGRB signals imposes very tight constraint on the superluminal movement of\ngravitational waves (i.e., the relative departure of GW velocity from the speed\nof light is $\\leq 4.3\\times 10^{-16}$) or the possible violation of weak\nequivalence principle (i.e., the difference of the gamma-ray and GW\ntrajectories in the gravitational field of the galaxy and the local universe\nshould be within a factor of $\\sim 3.4\\times 10^{-9}$). The so-called Dark\nMatter Emulators and a class of contender models for cosmic acceleration\n(\"Covariant Galileon\") are ruled out, too. The successful identification of\nLanthanide elements in the macronova/kilonova spectrum also excludes the\npossibility that the progenitors of GRB 170817A are a binary strange star\nsystem. The high neutron star merger rate (inferred from both the local sGRB\ndata and the gravitational wave data) together with the significant ejected\nmass strongly suggest that such mergers are the prime sites of heavy r-process\nnucleosynthesis.\n", "  Recent advances in graphene nanoribbon-based research have demonstrated the\ncontrolled synthesis of chiral graphene nanoribbons (cGNR) with atomic\nprecision using strategies of on-surface chemistry. However their electronic\ncharacterization, including typical figures of merit like band gap or frontier\nbands effective masses, has not yet been reported. In this work, we provide a\ndetailed characterization of (3,1)-cGNRs on Au(111). The structure and epitaxy,\nas well as the electronic band structure of the ribbons, are analyzed by means\nof scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, angle resolved photoemission\nand density functional theory.\n", "  The Oort cloud (OC) probably formed more than 4$\\,$Gyr ago and has been\nmoving with the Sun in the Galaxy since, exposed to external influences, most\nprominently to the Galactic tide and passing field stars. Theories suggest that\nother stars might posses exocomets distributed similarly to our OC. We study\nthe erosion of the OC and the possibility for capturing exocomets during the\nencounters with such field stars. We carry out simulations of flybys, where\nboth stars are surrounded by a cloud of comets. We measure how many exocomets\nare transferred to the OC, how many OC's comets are lost, and how this depends\non the other star's mass, velocity and impact parameter. Exocomets are\ntransferred to the OC only during relatively slow\n($\\lesssim0.5\\,$km$\\,$s$^{-1}$) and close ($\\lesssim10^5\\,$AU) flybys and these\nare expected to be extremely rare. Assuming that all passing stars are\nsurrounded by a cloud of exocomets, we derive that the fraction of exocomets in\nthe OC has been about $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$. Finally we simulate the OC for the\nwhole lifetime of the Sun, taking into account the encounters and the tidal\neffects. The OC has lost 25--65% of its mass, mainly due to stellar encounters,\nand at most 10% (and usually much less) of its mass can be captured. However,\nexocomets are often lost shortly after the encounter that delivers them, due to\nthe Galactic tide and consecutive encounters.\n", "  We present a comparative analysis of the properties of passive, star-forming\nand transition (green valley) galaxies, in four discrete environments: field,\ngroups, the outskirts and the core of X-ray clusters. We construct samples of\ngalaxies from the SDSS in these environments so that they are bound to have\nsimilar redshift distributions. The classification of galaxies into the three\nsequences is based on the UV-optical colour $NUV-r$. We study a number of\ngalaxy properties: stellar mass, morphology, specific star formation rate and\nthe history of star formation. The analysis of green valley galaxies reveals\nthat the physical mechanisms responsible for external quenching become more\nefficient moving from the field to denser environments. We confirm previous\nfindings that green valley galaxies have intermediate morphologies, moreover,\nwe find that this appears to be independent of the environment. Regarding the\nstellar mass of green valley galaxies, we find that they tend to be more\nmassive in the field than in denser environments. On average, green valley\ngalaxies account for $\\sim 20\\%$ of all galaxies in groups and X-ray clusters.\nWe find evidence that the field environment is inefficient in transforming low\nmass galaxies. Green valley galaxies have average star formation histories\nintermediate between passive and star forming galaxies, and have a clear and\nconsistent dependence on the environment: both, the quenching time, and the\namplitude of the star formation rate, decrease towards higher density\nenvironments.\n", "  Using high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of idealized,\nnon-cosmological galaxies, we investigate how cooling, star formation, and\nstellar feedback affect galactic magnetic fields. We find that the\namplification histories, saturation values, and morphologies of the magnetic\nfields vary considerably depending on the baryonic physics employed, primarily\nbecause of differences in the gas density distribution. In particular,\nadiabatic runs and runs with a sub-grid (effective equation of state) stellar\nfeedback model yield lower saturation values and morphologies that exhibit\ngreater large-scale order compared with runs that adopt explicit stellar\nfeedback and runs with cooling and star formation but no feedback. The\ndiscrepancies mostly lie in gas denser than the galactic average, which\nrequires cooling and explicit fragmentation to capture. Independent of the\nbaryonic physics included, the magnetic field strength scales with gas density\nas $B\\propto n^{2/3}$, suggesting isotropic flux freezing or equipartition\nbetween the magnetic and gravitational energies during the field amplification.\nWe conclude that accurate treatments of cooling, star formation, and stellar\nfeedback are crucial for obtaining the correct magnetic field strength and\nmorphology in dense gas, which, in turn, is essential for properly modeling\nother physical processes that depend on the magnetic field, such as cosmic ray\nfeedback.\n", "  The relationship between the integrated H$\\beta$ line luminosity and the\nvelocity dispersion of the ionized gas of HII galaxies and giant HII regions\nrepresents an exciting standard candle that presently can be used up to\nredshifts z ~ 4. Locally it is used to obtain precise measurements of the\nHubble constant by combining the slope of the relation obtained from nearby ($z\n\\leq $ 0.2) HII galaxies with the zero point determined from giant HII regions\nbelonging to an `anchor sample' of galaxies for which accurate\nredshift-independent distance moduli are available. We present new data for 36\ngiant HII regions in 13 galaxies of the anchor sample that includes the\nmegamaser galaxy NGC 4258. Our data is the result of the first four years of\nobservation of our primary sample of 130 giant HII regions in 73 galaxies with\nCepheid determined distances. Our best estimate of the Hubble parameter is\n$71.0\\pm2.8(random)\\pm2.1(systematic)$ km /s Mpc This result is the product of\nan independent approach and, although at present less precise than the latest\nSNIa results, it is amenable to substantial improvement.\n", "  The shell-type supernova remnant HESS J1731$-$347 emits TeV gamma-rays, and\nis a key object for the study of the cosmic ray acceleration potential of\nsupernova remnants. We use 0.5-1 arcminute Mopra CO/CS(1-0) data in conjunction\nwith HI data to calculate column densities towards the HESS J1731$-$347 region.\nWe trace gas within at least four Galactic arms, typically tracing total\n(atomic+molecular) line-of-sight H column densities of 2-3$\\times$10$^{22}$\ncm$^{-2}$. Assuming standard X-factor values and that most of the HI/CO\nemission seen towards HESS J1731$-$347 is on the near-side of the Galaxy, X-ray\nabsorption column densities are consistent with HI+CO-derived column densities\nforeground to, but not beyond, the Scutum-Crux Galactic arm, suggesting a\nkinematic distance of $\\sim$3.2 kpc for HESS J1731$-$347. At this kinematic\ndistance, we also find dense, infrared-dark gas traced by CS(1-0) emission\ncoincident with the north of HESS J1731$-$347, the nearby HII region\nG353.43$-$0.37 and the nearby unidentified gamma-ray source HESS J1729$-$345.\nThis dense gas lends weight to the idea that HESS J1729$-$345 and HESS\nJ1731-347 are connected, perhaps via escaping cosmic-rays.\n", "  We devise a functional renormalization group treatment for a chain of\ninteracting spinless fermions which is correct up to second order in the\ninteraction strength. We treat both inhomogeneous systems in real-space as well\nas the translational invariant case in a k-space formalism. The strengths and\nshortcomings of the different schemes as well as technical details of their\nimplementation are discussed. We use the method to study two proof-of-principle\nproblems in the realm of Luttinger liquid physics, namely reflection at\ninterfaces and power laws in the occupation number as a function of crystal\nmomentum.\n", "  Measuring and calibrating relations between cluster observables is critical\nfor resource-limited studies. The mass-richness relation of clusters offers an\nobservationally inexpensive way of estimating masses. Its calibration is\nessential for cluster and cosmological studies, especially for high-redshift\nclusters. Weak gravitational lensing magnification is a promising and\ncomplementary method to shear studies, that can be applied at higher redshifts.\nWe employed the weak lensing magnification method to calibrate the\nmass-richness relation up to a redshift of 1.4. We used the Spitzer Adaptation\nof the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS) galaxy cluster candidates\n($0.2<z<1.4$) and optical data from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)\nto test whether magnification can be effectively used to constrain the mass of\nhigh-redshift clusters. Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) selected using the $u$-band\ndropout technique and their colours were used as a background sample of\nsources. LBG positions were cross-correlated with the centres of the sample of\nSpARCS clusters to estimate the magnification signal measured for cluster\nsub-samples, binned in both redshift and richness. We detected a weak lensing\nmagnification signal for all bins at a detection significance of\n2.6-5.5$\\sigma$. In particular, the significance of the measurement for\nclusters with $z>1.0$ is 4.1$\\sigma$; for the entire cluster sample we obtained\nan average M$_{200}$ of $1.28^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ $\\times 10^{14} \\,\n\\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$. Our measurements demonstrated the feasibility of using\nweak lensing magnification as a viable tool for determining the average halo\nmasses for samples of high redshift galaxy clusters. The results also\nestablished the success of using galaxy over-densities to select massive\nclusters at $z > 1$. Additional studies are necessary for further modelling of\nthe various systematic effects we discussed.\n", "  Ultraluminous X-ray sources are non-nuclear point sources exceeding the\nEddington luminosity of a 10 Solar mass black hole. Modern consensus for a\nmajority of the ULX population is that they are powered by stellar-mass black\nholes or neutron stars accreting well above the Eddington limit. Theoretical\nmodels of super-Eddington accretion predict existence of powerful outflows of\nmoderately ionised gas at mildly relativistic velocities. So far, these winds\nhave been found in 3 systems: NGC 1313 X-1, NGC 5408 X-1, NGC 55 ULX. In this\nwork, we create a sample of all ULXs with usable archival high resolution X-ray\ndata, with 10 sources in total, in which we aim to find more signatures of\noutflows. We perform Gaussian line scans to find any narrow spectral\nsignatures, and physical wind model scans where possible. We tentatively\nidentify an outflow in NGC 5204 X-1, blueshifted to 0.34c, which produces\nemission features with a total significance of at least 3$\\sigma$. Next we\ncompare ULXs with similar hardness ratios. Holmberg IX X-1 shows absorption\nfeatures which could be associated with a photoionized outflowing absorber,\nsimilar to that seen in NGC 1313 X-1. The spectrum of Holmberg II X-1 possesses\nfeatures similar to NGC 5408 X-1 and NGC 6946 X-1 shows O VIII rest-frame\nemission. All other sources from the sample also show tentative evidence of\nspectral features in their high resolution spectra. Further observations with\nthe XMM-Newton and Chandra gratings will place stronger constraints. Future\nmissions like XARM and Athena will be able to detect them at larger distances\nand increase our sample.\n", "  Here I report the scaling relation between the baryonic masses and the scale\nlengths of stellar discs from $\\sim$1000 morphologically late-type galaxies.\nThe baryonic mass-size relation is a single power-law $R_\\ast \\propto\nM_b^{0.38}$ across $\\sim$3 orders of magnitude in baryonic mass. The scatter in\nsize at fixed baryonic mass is nearly constant and there is essentially no\noutlier. The baryonic mass-size relation provides a more fundamental\ndescription of the structure of the discs than the stellar mass-size relation.\nThe slope and the scatter of the stellar mass-size relation can be understood\nin the context of the baryonic mass-size relation. For gas-rich galaxies, the\nstars is no longer a good tracer for the baryons. High baryonic mass, gas-rich\ngalaxies appear to be much larger at fixed stellar mass because most of the\nbaryonic content is gas. The stellar mass-size relation thus deviates from the\npower law baryonic relation and the scatter increases at the low stellar mass\nend. Those extremely gas-rich low-mass galaxies can be classified as Ultra\nDiffuse Galaxies based on the structure.\n", "  Transit spectroscopy is one of the most commonly used methods to characterize\nexoplanets atmospheres. From the ground, these observations are very\nchallenging due to the terrestrial atmosphere and its intrinsic variations, but\nhigh-spectral resolution observations overcome this difficulty by resolving the\nspectral lines and taking advantage of the different Doppler velocities of the\nEarth, the host star and the exoplanet. We analyze the transmission spectrum\naround the Na I doublet at 589 nm of the exoplanet WASP-69b, a hot Jupiter\norbiting a K-type star with a period of 3.868 days, and compare the analysis to\nthat of the well-know hot Jupiter HD 189733b. We also present the analysis of\nthe Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for WASP-69b. Two transits of WASP-69b were\nobserved with the HARPS-North spectrograph (R = 115 000) at the TNG telescope.\nWe perform a telluric contamination subtraction based on the comparison between\nthe observed spectra and a telluric water model. Then, the common steps of the\ndifferential spectroscopy are followed to extract the transmission spectrum.\nThe method is tested with archival transit data of the extensively studied\nexoplanet HD 189733b, obtained with the HARPS-South spectrograph at ESO 3.6m\ntelescope, and then applied to WASP-69b data. For HD 189733b, we spectrally\nresolve the Na I doublet and measure line contrasts of $0.72\\pm0.05\\%$ (D2) and\n$0.51\\pm0.05\\%$ (D1), and FWHMs of $0.64\\pm0.04${\\AA} (D2) and\n$0.60\\pm0.06${\\AA} (D1), in agreement with previously published results. A net\nblueshift of ${\\sim}0.04${\\AA} is measured. For WASP-69b only the contrast of\nthe D2 line is measured ($5.8\\pm0.3\\%$). Even if this corresponds to a\ndetection at the $5\\sigma$-level of excess absorption of $0.5\\pm0.1\\%$ in a\npassband of $1.5${\\AA}, more transits are needed to fully characterize the\nlines profiles and retrieve accurate atmospheric properties.\n", "  OO Dra is a short-period Algol system with a $\\delta$ Sct-like pulsator. We\nobtained time-series spectra between 2016 February and May to derive the\nfundamental parameters of the binary star and to study its evolutionary\nscenario. The radial velocity (RV) curves for both components were presented,\nand the effective temperature of the hotter and more massive primary was\ndetermined to be $T_{\\rm eff,1}$ = 8260 $\\pm$ 210 K by comparing the\ndisentangling spectrum and the Kurucz models. Our RV measurements were solved\nwith the $BV$ light curves of Zhang et al. (2014) using the Wilson-Devinney\nbinary code. The absolute dimensions of each component are determined as\nfollows: $M_1$ = 2.03 $\\pm$ 0.06 M$_\\odot$, $M_2$ = 0.19 $\\pm$ 0.01 M$_\\odot$,\n$R_1$ = 2.08 $\\pm$ 0.03 R$_\\odot$, $R_2$ = 1.20 $\\pm$ 0.02 R$_\\odot$, $L_1$ =\n18 $\\pm$ 2 L$_\\odot$, and $L_2$ = 2.0 $\\pm$ 0.2 L$_\\odot$. Comparison with\nstellar evolution models indicated that the primary star resides inside the\n$\\delta$ Sct instability strip on the main sequence, while the cool secondary\ncomponent is noticeably overluminous and oversized. We demonstrated that OO Dra\nis an oscillating post-mass transfer R CMa-type binary; the originally more\nmassive star became the low-mass secondary component through mass loss caused\nby stellar wind and mass transfer, and the gainer became the pulsating primary\nas the result of mass accretion. The R CMa stars, such as OO Dra, are thought\nto have formed by non-conservative binary evolution and ultimately to evolve\ninto EL CVn stars.\n", "  Although now routinely incorporated into hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy\nevolution, the true importance of the feedback effect of the outflows driven by\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) remains uncertain from an observational\nperspective. This is due to a lack of accurate information on the densities,\nradial scales and level of dust extinction of the outflow regions. Here we use\nthe unique capabilities of VLT/Xshooter to investigate the warm outflows in a\nrepresentative sample of 9 local (0.06 $<$ z $<$ 0.15) ULIRGs with AGN nuclei\nand, for the first time, accurately quantify the key outflow properties. We\nfind that the outflows are compact (0.05 $<$ R$_{[OIII]}$ $<$ 1.2 kpc),\nsignificantly reddened (median E(B-V)$\\sim$0.5 magnitudes), and have relatively\nhigh electron densities (3.4 $<$ log$_{10}$ n$_e$ (cm$^{-3}$) $<$ 4.8). It is\nnotable that the latter densities -- obtained using trans-auroral [SII] and\n[OII] emission-line ratios -- exceed those typically assumed for the warm,\nemission-line outflows in active galaxies, but are similar to those estimated\nfor broad and narrow absorption line outflow systems detected in some type 1\nAGN. Even if we make the most optimistic assumptions about the true\n(deprojected) outflow velocities, we find relatively modest mass outflow rates\n($0.07 < \\dot{M} < 11$ M$_{sol}$ yr$^{-1}$) and kinetic powers measured as a\nfraction of the AGN bolometric luminosities ($4\\times10^{-4} < \\dot{E}/L_{BOL}\n<1$%). Therefore, although warm, AGN-driven outflows have the potential to\nstrongly affect the star formation histories in the inner bulge regions ($r\n\\sim$ 1kpc) of nearby ULIRGs, we lack evidence that they have a significant\nimpact on the evolution of these rapidly evolving systems on larger scales.\n", "  (Abridged) We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and\nasteroseismic data for 415 dwarfs and subgiants. Asteroseismic data have been\nobtained by Kepler in short cadence. The spectroscopic parameters are based on\nspectra taken as part of APOGEE and correspond to DR13 of SDSS. We analyze our\ndata using two Teff scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those\nderived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results\narising from these choices as a test of systematic Teff, and find that they can\nlead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties.\nDeterminations of surface gravity ($\\log{g}$), mean density ($\\rho$), radius\n($R$), mass ($M$), and age ($\\tau$) for the whole sample have been carried out\nwith stellar grid-based modeling. We have assessed random and systematic error\nsources in the spectroscopic and seismic data, as well as in the grid-based\nmodeling determination of the stellar quantities in the catalog. We provide\nstellar properties for both Teff scales. The median combined (random and\nsystematic) uncertainties are 2% (0.01 dex; $\\log{g}$), 3.4% ($\\rho$), 2.6%\n($R$), 5.1% ($M$), and 19% ($\\tau$) for the photometric Teff scale and 2%\n($\\log{g}$), 3.5% ($\\rho$), 2.7% ($R$), 6.3% ($M$), and 23% ($\\tau$) for the\nspectroscopic scale. Comparisons with stellar quantities in the catalog by\nChaplin et al.(2014) highlight the importance of metallicity measurements for\ndetermining stellar parameters accurately. We compare our results with those\nfrom other sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and\nasteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good\nagreement in all cases. Comparisons give strong support to the determination of\nstellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future\nmissions such as TESS and PLATO. Table 5 corrected (wrongly listed SDSS Teff\nbefore).\n", "  The total star formation budget of galaxies consists of the sum of the\nunobscured star formation, as observed in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV),\ntogether with the obscured component that is absorbed and re-radiated by dust\ngrains in the infrared. We explore how the fraction of obscured star formation\ndepends on stellar mass for mass-complete samples of galaxies at $0<z<2.5$. We\ncombine GALEX and WISE photometry for SDSS-selected galaxies with the 3D-HST\ntreasury program and Spitzer/MIPS 24$\\mu$m photometry in the well-studied 5\nextragalactic CANDELS fields. We find a strong dependence of the fraction of\nobscured star formation\n($f_{\\mathrm{obscured}}$=SFR$_{\\mathrm{IR}}$/SFR$_{\\mathrm{UV+IR}}$) on stellar\nmass, with remarkably little evolution in this fraction with redshift out to\n$z$=2.5. 50\\% of star formation is obscured for galaxies with\nlog(M/M$_{\\odot}$)=9.4; although unobscured star formation dominates the budget\nat lower masses, there exists a tail of low mass extremely obscured\nstar-forming galaxies at $z>1$. For log(M/M$_{\\odot}$)$>$10.5, $>$90\\% of star\nformation is obscured at all redshifts. We also show that at fixed total SFR,\n$f_{\\mathrm{obscured}}$ is lower at higher redshift. At fixed mass,\nhigh-redshift galaxies are observed to have more compact sizes and much higher\nstar formation rates, gas fractions and hence surface densities (implying\nhigher dust obscuration), yet we observe no redshift evolution in\n$f_{\\mathrm{obscured}}$ with stellar mass. This poses a challenge to\ntheoretical models to reproduce, where the observed compact sizes at high\nredshift seem in tension with lower dust obscuration.\n", "  The enhancement of mobility at the surface of an amorphous alloy is studied\nusing a combination of molecular dynamic simulations and normal mode analysis\nof the non-uniform distribution of Debye-Waller factors. The increased mobility\nat the surface is found to be associated with the appearance of Arrhenius\ntemperature dependence. We show that the transverse Debye-Waller factor\nexhibits a peak at the surface. Over the accessible temperature range, we find\nthat the bulk and surface diffusion coefficients obey the same empirical\nrelationship with the respective Debye-Waller factors. Extrapolating this\nrelationship to lower T, we argue that the observed decrease in the constraint\nat the surface is sufficient to account for the experimentally observed surface\nenhancement of mobility.\n", "  Assuming that the pion-pion scattering amplitude and its absorptive part are\nanalytic inside an ellipse in $t$- plane with foci $t=0$, $u=0$ and right\nextremity $t=4 m_{\\pi}^2 +\\epsilon $, ($\\epsilon > 0$), except for cuts\nprescribed by Mandelstam representation for $t\\geq 4 m_{\\pi}^2$, $u\\geq 4\nm_{\\pi}^2$ , and bounded by $s^N$ on the boundary of this domain, we prove that\nfor $s\\rightarrow \\infty$, \\sigma_{inel} (s) > \\frac{Const}{s^{5/2} }\\exp\n{[-\\frac{\\sqrt{s}}{4} (N+5/2) \\ln {s} ]}.\n", "  We present the detection of [$3.6~\\mu$m] photometric variability in two\nyoung, L/T transition brown dwarfs, WISE J004701.06+680352.1 (W0047) and 2MASS\nJ2244316+204343 (2M2244) using the \\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}. We find a\nperiod of $16.4\\pm0.2~$hr and a peak-to-peak amplitude of $1.07\\pm0.04\\%$ for\nW0047, and a period of $11\\pm2~$hr and amplitude of $0.8\\pm 0.2\\%$ for 2M2244.\nThis period is significantly longer than that measured previously during a\nshorter observation. {We additionally detect significant $J$-band variability\nin 2M2244 using the Wide-Field Camera on UKIRT. } We determine the radial and\nrotational velocities of both objects using Keck NIRSPEC data. We find a radial\nvelocity of $-16.0_{-0.9}^{+0.8}~$km s$^{-1}$ for 2M2244, and confirm it as a\nbona fide member of the AB Doradus moving group. We find rotational velocities\nof $v \\sin i=9.8\\pm0.3~$km s$^{-1}$and $14.3^{+1.4}_{-1.5}~$km s$^{-1}$ for\nW0047 and 2M2244, respectively. With inclination angles of $85 ^{+5\\circ}_{-9}$\nand $76 ^{+14\\circ}_{-20}$, W0047 and 2M2244 are viewed roughly equator-on.\nTheir remarkably similar colours, spectra and inclinations are consistent with\nthe possibility that viewing angle may influence atmospheric appearance. We\nadditionally present \\textit{Spitzer} $[4.5~\\mu\\mathrm{m}]$ monitoring of the\nyoung, T5.5 object SDSS111010+011613 (SDSS1110) where we detect no variability.\nFor periods $<18~$hr, we place an upper limit of $1.25\\%$ on the peak-to-peak\nvariability amplitude of SDSS1110.\n", "  This is the first of a series of papers presenting the results from our\nsurvey of 25 Galactic globular clusters with the MUSE integral-field\nspectrograph. In combination with our dedicated algorithm for source\ndeblending, MUSE provides unique multiplex capabilities in crowded stellar\nfields and allows us to acquire samples of up to 20 000 stars within the\nhalf-light radius of each cluster. The present paper focuses on the analysis of\nthe internal dynamics of 22 out of the 25 clusters, using about 500 000 spectra\nof 200 000 individual stars. Thanks to the large stellar samples per cluster,\nwe are able to perform a detailed analysis of the central rotation and\ndispersion fields using both radial profiles and two-dimensional maps. The\nvelocity dispersion profiles we derive show a good general agreement with\nexisting radial velocity studies but typically reach closer to the cluster\ncentres. By comparison with proper motion data we derive or update the\ndynamical distance estimates to 14 clusters. Compared to previous dynamical\ndistance estimates for 47 Tuc, our value is in much better agreement with other\nmethods. We further find significant (>3sigma) rotation in the majority (13/22)\nof our clusters. Our analysis seems to confirm earlier findings of a link\nbetween rotation and the ellipticities of globular clusters. In addition, we\nfind a correlation between the strengths of internal rotation and the\nrelaxation times of the clusters, suggesting that the central rotation fields\nare relics of the cluster formation that are gradually dissipated via two-body\nrelaxation.\n", "  We report the discovery of the ultracompact hot subdwarf (sdOB) binary OW\nJ074106.0-294811.0 with an orbital period of P$_{\\rm\norb}=44.66279\\pm1.16\\times10^{-4}$ min, making it the most compact hot subdwarf\nbinary known. Spectroscopic observations using the VLT, Gemini and Keck\ntelescopes revealed a He-sdOB primary with an intermediate helium abundance,\nT$_{\\rm eff}=39 400\\pm500$ K and log(g)=$5.74\\pm0.09$. High signal-to-noise\nratio lightcurves show strong ellipsoidal modulation resulting in a derived\nsdOB mass $M_{\\rm sdOB}=0.23\\pm0.12$ M$_\\odot$ with a WD companion ($M_{\\rm\nWD}=0.72\\pm0.17$ M$_\\odot$). The mass ratio was found to be $q = M_{\\rm\nsdOB}/M_{\\rm WD}=0.32\\pm0.10$. The derived mass for the He-sdOB is inconsistent\nwith the canonical mass for hot sbudwarfs of $\\approx0.47$ M$_\\odot$.\n  To put constraints on the structure and evolutionary history of the sdOB star\nwe compared the derived T$_{\\rm eff}$, log(g) and sdOB mass to evolutionary\ntracks of helium stars and helium white dwarfs calculated with Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). We find that the best fitting model\nis a helium white dwarf with a mass of $0.320$ M$_\\odot$, which left the common\nenvelope ${\\approx}1.1$ Myr ago, is consistent with the observations. As a\nhelium white dwarf with a massive white dwarf companion the object will reach\ncontact in 17.6 Myr at an orbital period of 5 min. Depending on the spin-orbit\nsynchronization timescale the object will either merge to form an R CrB star or\nend up as a stably accreting AM CVn-type system with a helium white dwarf\ndonor.\n", "  We have revisited the sdB+K-star long-period binary PG 1018-047 based on 20\nnew high-resolution VLT/UVES spectra that provided regular coverage over a\nperiod of more than 26 months. We refine the period and establish that the\norbit is significantly eccentric ($P=751.6\\pm1.9\\rm{d}$ and $e=0.049\\pm0.008$).\nA simultaneous fit derived from the narrow metal lines visible in the spectrum\nof the sdB star and the metal lines in the red part of the spectrum that\noriginate from the companion provides the mass ratio, $M_{\\rm MS}/M_{\\rm sdB} =\n1.52 \\pm 0.04$, for the system. From an NLTE model atmosphere analysis of the\ncombined spectra, we find $T_{\\rm eff}$=29900$\\pm$330K, log$g$=\n5.65$\\pm$0.06dex and log($n_{\\rm He}$/$n_{\\rm H}$)=-3.98$\\pm$0.16dex for the\nprimary, consistent with a B-type hot subdwarf star. The spectral contribution\nof the companion is consistent with a K5V-type star. With the companion having\na mass of only $\\sim$0.7$\\rm M_{\\odot}$ this system lies close to the boundary\nbelow which stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) cannot be supported. To model the\nevolution of such a system, we have extended earlier MESA models towards lower\ncompanion masses. We find that both phase-dependent mass loss during RLOF, when\n30 to 40\\% of the available mass is lost through the outer Lagrange point, and\nphase-dependent mass loss during RLOF in combination with a circumbinary disk\nof maximum $M_{\\rm CB} = 0.001\\rm M_{\\odot}$ could have formed the PG1018-047\nbinary system.\n", "  We present the analysis of the XMM-Newton data of the Circum-Galactic Medium\nof MASsive Spirals (CGM-MASS) sample of six extremely massive spiral galaxies\nin the local Universe. All the CGM-MASS galaxies have diffuse X-ray emission\nfrom hot gas detected above the background extending $\\sim(30-100)\\rm~kpc$ from\nthe galactic center. This doubles the existing detection of such extended hot\nCGM around massive spiral galaxies. The radial soft X-ray intensity profile of\nhot gas can be fitted with a $\\beta$-function with the slope typically in the\nrange of $\\beta=0.35-0.55$. This range, as well as those $\\beta$ values\nmeasured for other massive spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way (MW), are\nin general consistent with X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies of similar hot\ngas luminosity and temperature, and with those predicted from a hydrostatic\nisothermal gaseous halo. Hot gas in such massive spiral galaxy tends to have\ntemperature comparable to its virial value, indicating the importance of\ngravitational heating. This is in contrast to lower mass galaxies where hot gas\ntemperature tends to be systematically higher than the virial one. The ratio of\nthe radiative cooling to free fall timescales of hot gas is much larger than\nthe critical value of $\\sim10$ throughout the entire halos of all the CGM-MASS\ngalaxies, indicating the inefficiency of gas cooling and precipitation in the\nCGM. The hot CGM in these massive spiral galaxies is thus most likely in a\nhydrostatic state, with the feedback material mixed with the CGM, instead of\nescaping out of the halo or falling back to the disk. We also homogenize and\ncompare the halo X-ray luminosity measured for the CGM-MASS galaxies and other\ngalaxy samples and discuss the \"missing\" galactic feedback detected in these\nmassive spiral galaxies.\n", "  Trumpet geometries play an important role in numerical simulations of black\nhole spacetimes, which are usually performed under the assumption of asymptotic\nflatness. Our Universe is not asymptotically flat, however, which has motivated\nnumerical studies of black holes in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. We\nderive analytical expressions for trumpet geometries in Schwarzschild-de Sitter\nspacetimes by first generalizing the static maximal trumpet slicing of the\nSchwarzschild spacetime to static constant mean curvature trumpet slicings of\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. We then switch to a comoving isotropic\nradial coordinate which results in a coordinate system analogous to McVittie\ncoordinates. At large distances from the black hole the resulting metric\nasymptotes to a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric with an\nexponentially-expanding scale factor. While McVittie coordinates have another\nasymptotically de Sitter end as the radial coordinate goes to zero, so that\nthey generalize the notion of a \"wormhole\" geometry, our new coordinates\napproach a horizon-penetrating trumpet geometry in the same limit. Our\nanalytical expressions clarify the role of time-dependence, boundary conditions\nand coordinate conditions for trumpet slices in a cosmological context, and\nprovide a useful test for black hole simulations in asymptotically de Sitter\nspacetimes.\n", "  The low-lying structure of $^{55}$Sc has been investigated using in-beam\n$\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy with the $^{9}$Be($^{56}$Ti,$^{55}$Sc+$\\gamma$)$X$\none-proton removal and $^{9}$Be($^{55}$Sc,$^{55}$Sc+$\\gamma$)$X$\ninelastic-scattering reactions at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory.\nTransitions with energies of 572(4), 695(5), 1539(10), 1730(20), 1854(27),\n2091(19), 2452(26), and 3241(39) keV are reported, and a level scheme has been\nconstructed using $\\gamma\\gamma$ coincidence relationships and $\\gamma$-ray\nrelative intensities. The results are compared to large-scale shell-model\ncalculations in the $sd$-$pf$ model space, which account for positive-parity\nstates from proton-hole cross-shell excitations, and to it ab initio\nshell-model calculations from the in-medium similarity renormalization group\nthat includes three-nucleon forces explicitly. The results of proton-removal\nreaction theory with the eikonal model approach were adopted to aid\nidentification of positive-parity states in the level scheme; experimental\ncounterparts of theoretical $1/2^{+}_{1}$ and $3/2^{+}_{1}$ states are\nsuggested from measured decay patterns. The energy of the first $3/2^{-}$\nstate, which is sensitive to the neutron shell gap at the Fermi surface, was\ndetermined. The result indicates a rapid weakening of the $N=34$ subshell\nclosure in $pf$-shell nuclei at $Z>20$, even when only a single proton occupies\nthe $\\pi f_{7/2}$ orbital.\n", "  The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), located in Western Australia, is one of\nthe low-frequency precursors of the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA)\nproject. In addition to pursuing its own ambitious science program, it is also\na testbed for wide range of future SKA activities ranging from hardware,\nsoftware to data analysis. The key science programs for the MWA and SKA require\nvery high dynamic ranges, which challenges calibration and imaging systems.\nCorrect calibration of the instrument and accurate measurements of source flux\ndensities and polarisations require precise characterisation of the telescope's\nprimary beam. Recent results from the MWA GaLactic Extragalactic All-sky MWA\n(GLEAM) survey show that the previously implemented Average Embedded Element\n(AEE) model still leaves residual polarisations errors of up to 10-20 % in\nStokes Q. We present a new simulation-based Full Embedded Element (FEE) model\nwhich is the most rigorous realisation yet of the MWA's primary beam model. It\nenables efficient calculation of the MWA beam response in arbitrary directions\nwithout necessity of spatial interpolation. In the new model, every dipole in\nthe MWA tile (4 x 4 bow-tie dipoles) is simulated separately, taking into\naccount all mutual coupling, ground screen and soil effects, and therefore\naccounts for the different properties of the individual dipoles within a tile.\nWe have applied the FEE beam model to GLEAM observations at 200 - 231 MHz and\nused false Stokes parameter leakage as a metric to compare the models. We have\ndetermined that the FEE model reduced the magnitude and declination-dependent\nbehaviour of false polarisation in Stokes Q and V while retaining low levels of\nfalse polarisation in Stokes U.\n", "  The star-forming ability of a molecular cloud depends on the fraction of gas\nit can cycle into the dense-phase. Consequently, one of the crucial questions\nin reconciling star-formation in clouds is to understand the factors that\ncontrol this process. While it is widely accepted that the variation in ambient\nconditions can alter significantly the ability of a cloud to spawn stars, the\nobserved variation in the star-formation rate in nearby clouds that experience\nsimilar ambient conditions, presents an interesting question. In this work we\nattempted to reconcile this variation within the paradigm of colliding flows.\nTo this end we develop self-gravitating, hydrodynamic realisations of identical\nflows, but allowed to collide off-centre. Typical observational diagnostics\nsuch as the gas-velocity dispersion, the fraction of dense-gas, the column\ndensity distribution ({\\small N-PDF}), the distribution of gas mass as a\nfunction of $K$-band extinction and the strength of compressional/solenoidal\nmodes in the post-collision cloud were deduced for different choices of the\nimpact parameter of collision. We find that a strongly sheared cloud is\nterribly inefficient in cycling gas into the dense phase and that such a cloud\ncan possibly reconcile the sluggish nature of star-formation reported for some\nclouds. Within the paradigm of cloud-formation via colliding flows this is\npossible in case of flows colliding with a relatively large impact parameter.\nWe conclude that compressional modes - though probably essential - are\ninsufficient to ensure a relatively higher star-formation efficiency in a\ncloud.\n", "  We discuss the role of pairing anti-halo effect in the observed odd-even\nstaggering in reaction cross sections for $^{30,31,32}$Ne and $^{36,37,38}$Mg\nisotopes by taking into account the ground state deformation of these nuclei.\nTo this end, we construct the ground state density for the $^{30,31}$Ne and\n$^{36,37}$Mg nuclei based on a deformed Woods-Saxon potential, while for the\n$^{32}$Ne and $^{38}$Mg nuclei we also take into account the pairing\ncorrelation using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method. We demonstrate that, when\nthe one-neutron separation energy is small for the odd-mass nuclei, a\nsignificant odd-even staggering still appears even with finite deformation,\nalthough the degree of staggering is somewhat reduced compared to the spherical\ncase. This implies that the pairing anti-halo effect in general plays an\nimportant role in generating the odd-even staggering in reaction cross sections\nfor weakly bound nuclei.\n", "  The unexpected nearby gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A associated with the LIGO\nbinary neutron star merger event GW170817 presents a challenge to the current\nunderstanding of the emission physics of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The\nevent's low luminosity but similar peak energy compared to standard short GRBs\nare difficult to explain with current models, challenging our understanding of\nthe GRB emission process. Emission models invoking synchrotron radiation from\nelectrons accelerated in shocks and photospheric emission are particularly\nchallenging explanations for this burst.\n", "  The synchrotron peak of the X-ray bright High Energy Peaked Blazar (HBL) PKS\n2155$-$304 occurs in the UV-EUV region and hence its X-ray emission (0.6--10\nkeV) lies mostly in the falling part of the synchrotron hump. We aim to study\nthe X-ray emission of PKS 2155$-$304 during different intensity states in\n2009$-$2014 using XMM$-$Newton satellite. We studied the spectral curvature of\nall of the observations to provide crucial information on the energy\ndistribution of the non-thermal particles. Most of the observations show\ncurvature or deviation from a single power-law and can be well modeled by a log\nparabola model. In some of the observations, we find spectral flattening after\n6 keV. In order to find the possible origin of the X-ray excess, we built the\nMulti-band Spectral Energy distribution (SED). We find that the X-ray excess in\nPKS 2155--304 is difficult to fit in the one zone model but, could be easily\nreconciled in the spine/layer jet structure. The hard X-ray excess can be\nexplained by the inverse Comptonization of the synchrotron photons (from the\nlayer) by the spine electrons.\n", "  In this paper, we present unique observations of a blowout coronal jet that\npossibly triggered a two-ribbon confined C1.2 flare in a bipolar solar active\nregion NOAA 12615 on 2016 December 5. The jet activity initiates at\nchromospheric/transition-region heights with a small brightening that\neventually grows in a larger volume with well developed standard morphological\njet features, viz., base and spire. The spire widens up with a collimated\neruption of cool and hot plasma components, observed in the 304 and 94 A\nchannels of AIA, respectively. The speed of the plasma ejection, which forms\nthe jet's spire, was higher for the hot component (~200 km/s) than the cooler\none (~130 km/s). The NLFF model of coronal fields at pre- and post-jet phases\nsuccessfully reveal opening of previously closed magnetic field lines with a\nrather inclined/low-lying jet structure. The peak phase of the jet emission is\nfollowed by the development of a two-ribbon flare that shows coronal loop\nemission in HXRs up to ~25 keV energy. The coronal magnetic fields rooted at\nthe location of EUV flare ribbons, derived from the NLFF model, demonstrate the\npre-flare phase to exhibit an \"X-type\" configuration while the magnetic fields\nat the post-flare phase are more or less parallel oriented. The comparisons of\nmulti-wavelength measurements with the magnetic field extrapolations suggest\nthat the jet activity likely triggered the two-ribbon flare by perturbing the\nfield in the interior of the active region.\n", "  It is well known that external magnetic fields and magnetic moments of\nimpurities both suppress superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate that their\ncombined effect enhances the superconductivity of a few atomic layer thick Pb\nfilms grown on a cleaved GaAs(110) surface. A Ce-doped film, where\nsuperconductivity is totally suppressed at zero-field, actually turns\nsuperconducting when an external magnetic field is applied parallel to the\nconducting plane. For films with Mn adatoms, the screening of the magnetic\nmoment by conduction electrons, i.e., the Kondo singlet formation, becomes\nimportant. We found that the degree of screening can be reduced by capping the\nPb film with a Au layer, and observed the positive magnetic field dependence of\nthe superconducting transition temperature.\n", "  We study M1-transitions involving mesons: $B_c(1s)$, $B_c^*(1s)$, $B_c(2s)$,\n$B_c^*(2s)$, $B_c(3s)$ and $B_c^*(3s)$ in the relativistic independent quark\n(RIQ) model based on a flavor independent average potential in the\nscalar-vector harmonic form. The transition form factor for $B_c^*\\to\nB_c\\gamma$ is found to have analytical continuation from spacelike to physical\ntimelike region. Our predicted coupling constant $g_{B_c^* B_c}$ = 0.34\nGe$V^{-1}$ and decay width $\\Gamma(B_c^*\\to B_c\\gamma)$ = 23 eV agree with\nother model predictions. In view of possible observation of $B_c$ and $B_c^*$\ns-wave states at LHC and Z-factory and potential use of theoretical estimate on\nM1-transitions, we investigate the allowed as well as hindered transitions of\norbitally excited $B_c$-meson states and predict their decay widths in overall\nagreement with other model predictions. We consider the typical case of\n$B_c^*(1s)\\to B_c(1s)\\gamma$, where our predicted decay width which is found\nquite sensitive to the mass difference between $B_c^*$ and $B_c$ mesons may\nhelp in determining the mass of $B_c^*$ experimentally.\n", "  Considering four-point correlation functions of color-singlet quark\nbilinears, we investigate, in the large-$N_{\\mathrm{c}}$ limit of QCD, the\nsubleading diagrams that involve, in the $s$-channel of meson-meson scattering\namplitudes, two-quark--two-antiquark intermediate states. The latter\ncontribute, together with gluon exchanges, to the formation, at the hadronic\nlevel, of two-meson and tetraquark intermediate states. It is shown that the\ntwo-meson contributions, which are predictable, in general, from leading-order\n$N_{\\mathrm{c}}$-behaviors, consistently satisfy the constraints resulting from\nthe $1/N_{\\mathrm{c}}$ expansion procedure and thus provide a firm basis for\nthe extraction of tetraquark properties from $N_{\\mathrm{c}}$-subleading\ndiagrams. We find that, in general, tetraquarks, if they exist in compact form,\nshould have narrow decay widths, of the order of $N_{\\mathrm{c}}^{-2}$. For the\nparticular case of exotic tetraquarks, involving four different quark flavors,\ntwo different types of tetraquark are needed, each having a preferred decay\nchannel, to satisfy the consistency constraints.\n", "  We present MUSE observations of the field of the quasar Q0152$-$020 whose\nspectrum shows a Lyman limit system (LLS) at redshift $z_{\\rm abs} = 0.38$,\nwith a metallicity Z $\\gtrsim 0.06$ Z$_\\odot$. The low ionization metal lines\nassociated with the LLS present two narrow distinct absorption components with\na velocity separation of 26 km ${\\rm s}^{-1}$. We detect six galaxies within\n600 km ${\\rm s}^{-1}$ from the absorption redshift; their projected distances\nfrom the quasar sightline range from 60 to 200 kpc. The optical spectra of five\nof these galaxies exhibit prominent nebular emission lines, from which we\ndeduce extinction-corrected star formation rates in the range SFR = 0.06-1.3\nM$_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, and metallicities between 0.2 Z$_\\odot$ and Z$_\\odot$. The\nsixth galaxy is only detected in the stellar continuum. By combining our data\nwith archival Keck/HIRES spectroscopy of the quasar and HST/WFPC2 imaging of\nthe field, we can relate absorption line and galaxy kinematics; we conclude\nthat the LLS is most likely associated with the galaxy closest to the quasar\nsight-line (galaxy \"a\"). Our morphokinematic analysis of galaxy \"a\" combined\nwith the absorption line kinematics supports the interpretation that one of the\nabsorption components originates from an extension of the stellar disk of\ngalaxy \"a\", while the other component may arise in accreting gas in a warped\ndisk with specific angular momentum $\\sim 3$ times larger than the specific\nangular momentum of the galaxy halo. Such warped disks are common features in\nhydrodynamical simulations of cold-flow accretion onto galaxies; the data\npresented here provide observational evidence in favour of this scenario.\n", "  We have developed a new X-ray absorption model, called {\\tt IONeq}, which\ncomputes the optical depth $\\tau(E)$ simultaneously for ions of all abundant\nelements, assuming ionization equilibrium and taking into account turbulent\nbroadening. We use this model to analyze the interstellar medium (ISM)\nabsorption features in the Milky Way for a sample of 18 galactic (LMXBs) and 42\nextragalactic sources (mainly Blazars). The absorbing ISM was modeled as a\ncombination of three components/phases - neutral ($T\\lesssim1\\times10^{4}$ K),\nwarm ($T\\sim5\\times 10^{4}$ K) and hot ($T\\sim2\\times10^{6}$ K). We found that\nthe spatial distribution of both, neutral and warm components, are difficult to\ndescribe using smooth profiles due to nonuniform distribution of the column\ndensities over the sky. For the hot phase we used a combination of a flattened\ndisk and a halo, finding comparable column densities for both spatial\ncomponents, in the order of $\\sim 6-7\\times10^{18}\\;{\\rm cm^{-2}}$, although\nthis conclusion depends on the adopted parametrization. If the halo component\nhas sub-solar abundance $Z$, then the column density has be scaled up by a\nfactor $\\frac{Z_\\odot}{Z}$. The vertically integrated column densities of the\ndisk components suggests the following mass fractions for these three ISM\nphases in the Galactic disk: neutral $\\sim~89\\%$, warm $\\sim 8\\%$ and hot $\\sim\n3\\%$ components, respectively. The constraints on the radial distribution of\nthe halo component of the hot component are weak.\n", "  The stellar velocity ellipsoid of the solar neighbour is re-examined using\nintermediate-old mono-abundances stellar groups with high quality chemistry\ndata together with parallaxes and proper motions from Gaia DR1. We find the\naverage velocity dispersion values for the three space velocity components for\nthe thin and thick disc of (\\sigma_{U},\\sigma_{V},\\sigma_{W})_{thin} = (33 \\pm\n4, 28 \\pm 2, 23 \\pm 2) and (\\sigma_{U},\\sigma_{V},\\sigma_{W})_{thick} = (57 \\pm\n6, 38 \\pm 5, 37 \\pm 4) km s^{-1}, respectively. The mean values of the ratio\nbetween the semi-axes of the velocity ellipsoid for the thin disc are found to\nbe, \\sigma_{V}/\\sigma_{U} = 0.70 \\pm 0.13 and \\sigma_{W}/\\sigma_{U} is 0.64 \\pm\n0.08, while for the thick disc \\sigma_{V}/\\sigma_{U} = 0.67 \\pm 0.11 and\n\\sigma_{W}/\\sigma_{U} is 0.66 \\pm 0.11. Inputting these dispersions into the\nlinear Str\\\"omberg relation for the thin disc groups, we find the Sun's\nvelocity with respect to the LSR in Galactic rotation to be V_{\\sun} = 13.9 \\pm\n3.4 km s^{-1}. A relation is found between the vertex deviation and the\nchemical abundances for the thin disc, ranging from -5 to +40^{\\circ} as\niron-abundance increases. For the thick disc we find a vertex deviation of\nl_{uv} \\sim -15^{\\circ}. The tilt angle (l_{uw}) in the U-W plane for the thin\ndisc groups ranges from -10 to +15^\\circ, but there is no evident relation\nbetween l_{uw} and the mean abundances. However we find a weak relation for\nl_{uw} as a function of iron abundances and \\alpha-elements for most of the\ngroups in the thick disc, where the tilt angle decreases from -5 to -20^\\circ\nwhen [Fe/H] decreases and [\\alpha/Fe] increases. The velocity anisotropy\nparameter is independent of the chemical group abundances and its value is\nnearly constant for both discs (\\beta \\sim 0.5), suggesting that the combined\ndisc is dynamically relaxed.\n", "  Euclid and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are poised to\ndramatically change the astronomy landscape early in the next decade. The\ncombination of high cadence, deep, wide-field optical photometry from LSST with\nhigh resolution, wide-field optical photometry and near-infrared photometry and\nspectroscopy from Euclid will be powerful for addressing a wide range of\nastrophysical questions. We explore Euclid/LSST synergy, ignoring the political\nissues associated with data access to focus on the scientific, technical, and\nfinancial benefits of coordination. We focus primarily on dark energy\ncosmology, but also discuss galaxy evolution, transient objects, solar system\nscience, and galaxy cluster studies. We concentrate on synergies that require\ncoordination in cadence or survey overlap, or would benefit from pixel-level\nco-processing that is beyond the scope of what is currently planned, rather\nthan scientific programs that could be accomplished only at the catalog level\nwithout coordination in data processing or survey strategies. We provide two\nquantitative examples of scientific synergies: the decrease in photo-z errors\n(benefitting many science cases) when high resolution Euclid data are used for\nLSST photo-z determination, and the resulting increase in weak lensing\nsignal-to-noise ratio from smaller photo-z errors. We briefly discuss other\nareas of coordination, including high performance computing resources and\ncalibration data. Finally, we address concerns about the loss of independence\nand potential cross-checks between the two missions and potential consequences\nof not collaborating.\n", "  To investigate the connection between radio activity and AGN outflows, we\npresent a study of ionized gas kinematics based on [O III] $\\lambda$5007\nemission line along the large-scale radio jet for six radio AGNs. These AGNs\nare selected based on the radio activity (i.e., $\\mathrm{L_{1.4GHz}}$\n$\\geqslant$ 10$^{39.8}$ erg s$^{-1}$) as well as optical emission line\nproperties as type 2 AGNs. Using the Red Channel Cross Dispersed Echellette\nSpectrograph at the Multiple Mirror Telescope, we investigate in detail the [O\nIII] and stellar kinematics. We spatially resolve and probe the central\nAGN-photoionization sizes, which is important in understanding the structures\nand evolutions of galaxies. We find that the typical central\nAGN-photoionization radius of our targets are in range of 0.9$-$1.6 kpc,\nconsistent with the size-luminosity relation of [O III] in the previous\nstudies. We investigate the [O III] kinematics along the large-scale radio jets\nto test whether there is a link between gas outflows in the narrow-line region\nand extended radio jet emissions. Contrary to our expectation, we find no\nevidence that the gas outflows are directly connected to the large scale radio\njets.\n", "  We establish the well-posedness, the finite speed propagation, and a\nregularity result for Maxwell's equations in media consisting of dispersive\n(frequency dependent) metamaterials. Two typical examples for such\nmetamaterials are materials obeying Drude's and Lorentz' models. The causality\nand the passivity are the two main assumptions and play a crucial role in the\nanalysis. It is worth noting that by contrast the well-posedness in the\nfrequency domain is not ensured in general. We also provide some numerical\nexperiments using the Drude's model to illustrate its dispersive behaviour.\n", "  A large fraction of stars are in binary systems, yet the evolution of\nproto-planetary discs in binaries has been little explored from the theoretical\nside. In this paper we investigate the evolution of the discs surrounding the\nprimary and secondary components of binary systems on the assumption that this\nis driven by photoevaporation induced by X-rays from the respective star. We\nshow how for close enough separations (20-30 AU for average X-ray luminosities)\nthe tidal torque of the companion changes the qualitative behaviour of disc\ndispersal from inside out to outside in. Fewer transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation are thus expected in binaries. We also demonstrate that in\nclose binaries the reduction in viscous time leads to accelerated disc clearing\naround both components, consistent with $\\textit{unresolved}$ observations.\nWhen looking at the $\\textit{differential}$ disc evolution around the two\ncomponents, in close binaries discs around the secondary clear first due to the\nshorter viscous timescale associated with the smaller outer radius. In wide\nbinaries instead the difference in photo-evaporation rate makes the secondaries\nlonger lived, though this is somewhat dependent on the assumed scaling of\nviscosity with stellar mass. We find that our models are broadly compatible\nwith the growing sample of $\\textit{resolved}$ observations of discs in\nbinaries. We also predict that binaries have higher accretion rates than single\nstars for the same disc mass. Thus binaries probably contribute to the observed\nscatter in the relationship between disc mass and accretion rate in young\nstars.\n", "  We use results of our 3 year polarimetric monitoring program to investigate\nthe previously suggested connection between rotations of the polarization plane\nin the optical emission of blazars and their gamma-ray flares in the GeV band.\nThe homogeneous set of 40 rotation events in 24 sources detected by {\\em\nRoboPol} is analysed together with the gamma-ray data provided by {\\em\nFermi}-LAT. We confirm that polarization plane rotations are indeed related to\nthe closest gamma-ray flares in blazars and the time lags between these events\nare consistent with zero. Amplitudes of the rotations are anticorrelated with\namplitudes of the gamma-ray flares. This is presumably caused by higher\nrelativistic boosting (higher Doppler factors) in blazars that exhibit smaller\namplitude polarization plane rotations. Moreover, the time scales of rotations\nand flares are marginally correlated.\n", "  We present DECam imaging for the peculiar Galactic globular clusters NGC1851,\nNGC1904 (M79), NGC2298 and NGC2808. Our deep photometry reveals that all the\nclusters have an important contribution of stars beyond their King tidal radii\nand present tails with different morphologies. We have also explored the\nsurroundings of the clusters where the presence of the Canis Major overdensity\nand/or the low Galactic latitude Monoceros ring at d~8kpc is evident. A second\nstellar system is found at d~17kpc and spans at least 18deg x 15deg in the sky.\nAs one of the possible scenarios to explain that feature, we propose that the\nunveiled system is part of Monoceros explained as a density wave moving towards\nthe outer Milky Way. Alternatively, the unveiled system might be connected with\nother known halo substructures or associated with the progenitor dwarf galaxy\nof NGC1851 and NGC1904, which are widely considered accreted globular clusters.\n", "  The fully nonlinear gravitationally induced trajectories of a nearly complete\nset of galaxies, groups, and clusters in the Local Supercluster are constructed\nin a Numerical Action Method (NAM) model constrained by data from the\nCosmicFlows survey and various distance indicators. We add the gravity field\ndue to inhomogeneities external to the sample sphere by making use of larger\nscale peculiar flow measurements. Assignments of total masses were made to find\nthe best overall set of mutual attractions, as determined by a goodness\ncriterion based on present day radial velocities, individually for the Virgo\nCluster, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and via a mass-to-light ratio\nrelationship for other masses. The low median chi-square found indicates the\nmodel fits the present day velocity flow well, but a slightly high mean\nchi-square may indicate that some masses underwent complex orbits. The best\nfit, when setting the value of $H_0$ to the CosmicFlows value of 75 km/s/Mpc\nand the WMAP value for $\\Omega_m=0.244$ consistent with that $H_0$, occurs with\nthe following parameters: $\\Omega_{orphan} = 0.077\\pm0.016$, $M/L_K $= $40 \\pm\n2$ $L_{10}^{0.15}$ $M_\\odot/L_\\odot$ ($L_{10}$ is K-band luminosity in units of\n$10^{10} L_\\odot$), a Virgo mass of $6.3\\pm0.8 \\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$ ($M/L_K\n= 113\\pm15 M_\\odot/L_\\odot$), and a mass for the MW plus M31 of $5.15\\pm0.35\n\\times 10^{12} M_\\odot$. The best constant mass-to-light ratio is $M/L_K =\n58\\pm3 M_\\odot/L_\\odot$. The Virgocentric turnaround radius is $7.3\\pm0.3$ Mpc.\nWe explain several interesting trends in peculiar motions for various regions\nnow that we can construct the 3D orbital histories.\n", "  We theoretically study cooling of flexural modes of a mechanical oscillator\nby Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) atoms (Rb87) trapped in a magnetic trap. The\nmechanical oscillator with a tiny magnet attached on one of its free ends\nproduces an oscillating magnetic field. When its oscillating frequency matches\ncertain hyperfine Zeeman energy of Rb87 atoms, the trapped BEC atoms are\ncoupled out of the magnetic trap by the mechanical oscillator, flying away from\nthe trap with stolen energy from the mechanical oscillator. Thus the mode\ntemperature of the mechanical oscillator is reduced. The mode temperature of\nthe steady state of a mechanical oscillator, measured by the mean steady-state\nphonon number in the flexural mode of the mechanical oscillator, is analyzed.\nIt is found that ground state (phonon number less than 1) may be accessible\nwith optimal parameters of the hybrid system of a mechanical oscillator and\ntrapped BEC atoms.\n", "  Motivated by recent observational searches of sub-structure in starless\nmolecular cloud cores, we investigate the evolution of density perturbations on\nscales smaller than the Jeans length embedded in contracting isothermal clouds,\nadopting the same formalism developed for the expanding Universe and the solar\nwind. We find that initially small amplitude, Jeans-stable perturbations\n(propagating as sound waves in the absence of a magnetic field), are amplified\nadiabatically during the contraction, approximately conserving the wave action\ndensity, until they either become nonlinear and steepen into shocks at a time\n$t_{\\rm nl}$, or become gravitationally unstable when the Jeans length\ndecreases below the scale of the perturbations at a time $t_{\\rm gr}$. We\nevaluate analytically the time $t_{\\rm nl}$ at which the perturbations enter\nthe non-linear stage using a Burgers' equation approach, and we verify\nnumerically that this time marks the beginning of the phase of rapid\ndissipation of the kinetic energy of the perturbations. We then show that for\ntypical values of the rms Mach number in molecular cloud cores, $t_{\\rm nl}$ is\nsmaller than $t_{\\rm gr}$, and therefore density perturbations likely dissipate\nbefore becoming gravitational unstable. Solenoidal modes grow at a faster rate\nthan compressible modes, and may eventually promote fragmentation through the\nformation of vortical structures.\n", "  Stellar flares have been extensively studied in soft X-rays (SXR) by\nbasically every X-ray mission. Hard X-ray (HXR) emission from stellar\nsuperflares, however, have only been detected from a handful of objects over\nthe past years. One very extreme event was the superflare from the young\nM-dwarf DG CVn binary star system, which triggered Swift/BAT as if it was a\n$\\gamma$-ray burst (GRB). In this work, we estimate the expected $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from DG CVn and the most extreme stellar flares by extrapolating from\nsolar flares based on measured solar energetic particles (SEPs), as well as\nthermal and non-thermal emission properties. We find that ions are plausibly\naccelerated in stellar superflares to 100 GeV energies, and possibly up to TeV\nenergies in the associated coronal mass ejections. The corresponding\n$\\pi^0$-decay $\\gamma$-ray emission could be detectable from stellar\nsuperflares with ground-based $\\gamma$-ray telescopes. On the other hand, the\ndetection of $\\gamma$-ray emission implies particle densities high enough that\nions suffer significant losses due to inelastic proton-proton scattering. The\nnext-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should be able to probe\nsuperflares from M-dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood and constrain the energy\nin interacting cosmic rays and/or their maximum energy. The detection of\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from stellar flares would open a new window for the study\nof stellar physics, the underlying physical processes in flares and their\nimpact on habitability of planetary systems.\n", "  We present Lightning, a new spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting\nprocedure, capable of quickly and reliably recovering star formation history\n(SFH) and extinction parameters. The SFH is modeled as discrete steps in time.\nIn this work, we assumed lookback times of 0-10 Myr, 10-100 Myr, 0.1-1 Gyr, 1-5\nGyr, and 5-13.6 Gyr. Lightning consists of a fully vectorized inversion\nalgorithm to determine SFH step intensities and combines this with a grid-based\napproach to determine three extinction parameters. We apply our procedure to\nthe extensive FUV-to-FIR photometric data of M51, convolved to a common spatial\nresolution and pixel scale, and make the resulting maps publicly available. We\nrecover, for M51a, a peak star formation rate (SFR) between 0.1 and 5 Gyr ago,\nwith much lower star formation activity over the last 100 Myr. For M51b, we\nfind a declining SFR toward the present day. In the outskirt regions of M51a,\nwhich includes regions between M51a and M51b, we recover a SFR peak between 0.1\nand 1 Gyr ago, which corresponds to the effects of the interaction between M51a\nand M51b. We utilize our results to (1) illustrate how UV+IR hybrid SFR laws\nvary across M51, and (2) provide first-order estimates for how the IR\nluminosity per unit stellar mass varies as a function of the stellar age. From\nthe latter result, we find that IR emission from dust heated by stars is not\nalways associated with young stars, and that the IR emission from M51b is\nprimarily powered by stars older than 5 Gyr.\n", "  We present a new technique for empirically calibrating how the X-ray\nluminosity function (XLF) of X-ray binary (XRB) populations evolves following a\nstar-formation event. We first utilize detailed stellar population synthesis\nmodeling of far-UV to far-IR photometry of the nearby face-on spiral galaxy M51\nto construct maps of the star-formation histories (SFHs) on subgalactic (~400\npc) scales. Next, we use the ~850 ks cumulative Chandra exposure of M51 to\nidentify and isolate 2-7 keV detected point sources within the galaxy, and we\nuse our SFH maps to recover the local properties of the stellar populations in\nwhich each X-ray source is located. We then divide the galaxy into various\nsubregions based on their SFH properties (e.g., star-formation rate [SFR] per\nstellar mass [M*] and mass-weighted stellar age) and group the X-ray point\nsources according to the characteristics of the regions in which they are\nfound. Finally, we construct and fit a parameterized XLF model that quantifies\nhow the XLF shape and normalization evolves as a function of the XRB population\nage. Our best-fit model indicates the XRB XLF per unit stellar mass declines in\nnormalization, by ~3-3.5 dex, and steepens in slope from ~10 Myr to ~10 Gyr. We\nfind that our technique recovers results from past studies of how XRB XLFs and\nXRB luminosity scaling relations vary with age and provides a self-consistent\npicture for how the XRB XLF evolves with age.\n", "  Massive black hole binaries (BHBs) are expected to form as the result of\ngalaxy mergers; they shrink via dynamical friction and stellar scatterings,\nuntil gravitational waves (GWs) bring them to the final coalescence. It has\nbeen argued that BHBs may stall at a parsec scale and never enter the GW stage\nif stars are not continuously supplied to the BHB loss cone. Here we perform\nseveral N-body experiments to study the effect of an 80,000 solar masses\nstellar cluster (SC) infalling on a parsec-scale BHB. We explore different\norbital elements for the SC and we perform runs both with and without\naccounting for the influence of a rigid stellar cusp (modelled as a rigid\nDehnen potential). We find that the semi-major axis of the BHB shrinks by more\nthan 10 per cent if the SC is on a nearly radial orbit; the shrinking is more\nefficient when a Dehnen potential is included and the orbital plane of the SC\ncoincides with that of the BHB. In contrast, if the SC orbit has non-zero\nangular momentum, only a few stars enter the BHB loss cone and the resulting\nBHB shrinking is negligible. Our results indicate that SC disruption might\nsignificantly contribute to the shrinking of a parsec-scale BHB only if the SC\napproaches the BHB on a nearly radial orbit.\n", "  We present Keck/OSIRIS adaptive optics observations with 150-400 pc spatial\nsampling of 7 turbulent, clumpy disc galaxies from the DYNAMO sample\n($0.07<z<0.2$). DYNAMO galaxies have previously been shown to be well matched\nin properties to main sequence galaxies at $z\\sim1.5$. Integral field\nspectroscopy observations using adaptive optics are subject to a number of\nsystematics including a variable PSF and spatial sampling, which we account for\nin our analysis. We present gas velocity dispersion maps corrected for these\neffects, and confirm that DYNAMO galaxies do have high gas velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma=40-80$\\kms), even at high spatial sampling. We find statistically\nsignificant structure in 6 out of 7 galaxies. The most common distance between\nthe peaks in velocity dispersion and emission line peaks is $\\sim0.5$~kpc, we\nnote this is very similar to the average size of a clump measured with HST\nH$\\alpha$ maps. This could suggest that the peaks in velocity dispersion in\nclumpy galaxies likely arise due to some interaction between the clump and the\nsurrounding ISM of the galaxy, though our observations cannot distinguish\nbetween outflows, inflows or velocity shear. Observations covering a wider area\nof the galaxies will be needed to confirm this result.\n", "  To understand the conditions that produce white-light (WL) enhancements in\nsolar flares, a statistical analysis of visible continuum data as observed by\nHinode/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) was performed. In this study,\napproximately 100 flare events from M- and X-class flares were selected. The\ntime period during which the data were recorded spans from January 2011 to\nFebruary 2016. Of these events, approximately half are classified as\nwhite-light flares (WLFs), whereas the remaining events do not show any\nenhancements of the visible continuum (non-WLF; NWL). In order to determine the\nexistence of WL emission, running difference images of not only the Hinode/SOT\nWL (G-band, blue, green, and red filter) data but also the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager continuum data are used. A\ncomparison between these two groups of WL data in terms of duration,\ntemperature, emission measure of GOES soft X-rays, distance between EUV flare\nribbons, strength of hard X-rays, and photospheric magnetic field strength was\nundertaken. In this statistical study, WLF events are characterized by a\nshorter time-scale and shorter ribbon distance compared with NWL events. From\nthe scatter plots of the duration of soft X-rays and the energy of non-thermal\nelectrons, a clear distinction between WLF and NWL events can be made. It is\nfound that the precipitation of large amounts of accelerated electrons within a\nshort time period plays a key role in generating WL enhancements. Finally, it\nwas demonstrated that the coronal magnetic field strength in the flare region\nis one of the most important factors that allow the individual identification\nof WLF events from NWL events.\n", "  Atomic nanolines are one dimensional systems realized by assembling many\natoms on a substrate into long arrays. The electronic properties of the\nnanolines depend on those of the substrate. Here, we demonstrate that to fully\nunderstand the electronic properties of Bi nanolines on clean Si(001) several\ndifferent contributions must be accounted for. Scanning tunneling microscopy\nreveals a variety of different patterns along the nanolines as the imaging bias\nis varied. We observe an electronic phase shift of the Bi dimers, associated\nwith imaging atomic p-orbitals, and an electronic coupling between the Bi\nnanoline and neighbouring Si dimers, which influences the appearance of both.\nUnderstanding the interplay between the Bi nanolines and Si substrate could\nopen a novel route to modifying the electronic properties of the nanolines.\n", "  Using density functional theory calculations, we have found an enhanced\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect in Fe/insulator interfaces. The results of our\nstudy indicate that interfacial Fe atoms in the Fe films have a low-dimensional\nnature, which causes the following two effects: (i) The diagonal component\n$\\sigma_{xx}$ of the optical conductivity decreases dramatically because the\nhopping integral for electrons between Fe atoms is suppressed by the low\ndimensionality. (ii) The off-diagonal component $\\sigma_{xy}$ of the optical\nconductivity does not change at low photon energies, but it is enhanced at\nphoton energies around 2 eV, where we obtain enhanced orbital magnetic moments\nand spin-orbit correlations for the interfacial Fe atoms. A large Kerr angle\ndevelops in proportion to the ratio $\\sigma_{xy}/\\sigma_{xx}$. Our findings\nindicate an efficient way to enhance the effect of spin-orbit coupling at\nmetal/insulator interfaces without using heavy elements.\n", "  We present data for 16 galaxies in the overdensity JKCS 041 at $z \\simeq\n1.80$ as part of the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) Cluster Survey\n(KCS). With 20-hour integrations, we have obtained deep absorption-line spectra\nfrom which we derived velocity dispersions for seven quiescent galaxies. We\ncombined photometric parameters derived from Hubble Space Telescope images with\nthe dispersions to construct a fundamental plane (FP) for quiescent galaxies in\nJKCS 041. From the zero-point evolution of the FP, we derived a formation\nredshift for the galaxies of $z_{form} = 3.0\\pm0.3$, corresponding to a mean\nage of $1.4\\pm0.2$ Gyrs. We tested the effect of structural and velocity\ndispersion evolution on our FP zero point and found a negligible contribution\nwhen using dynamical mass-normalized parameters ($\\sim 3\\%$), but a significant\ncontribution from stellar-mass-normalized parameters ($\\sim 42 \\%$). From the\nrelative velocities of the galaxies, we probed the three-dimensional structure\nof these 16 confirmed members of JKCS 041, and found that a group of galaxies\nin the south west of the overdensity had systematically higher velocities. We\nderived ages for the galaxies in the different groups from the FP. We found the\neast-extending group had typically older galaxies ($2.1\\substack{+0.3\\\\-0.2}$\nGyrs), than those in the south-west group ($0.3\\pm0.2$ Gyrs). Although based on\nsmall numbers, the overdensity dynamics, morphology, and age results could\nindicate that JKCS 041 is in formation and may comprise two merging groups of\ngalaxies. The result could link large-scale structure to ages of galaxies for\nthe first time at this redshift.\n", "  We have performed ground-based transmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter\norbiting the cool dwarf WASP-80 using the ACAM instrument on the William\nHerschel Telescope (WHT) as part of the LRG-BEASTS programme. This is the third\npaper of a ground-based transmission spectroscopy survey of hot Jupiters using\nlow-resolution grism spectrographs. We observed two transits of the planet and\nhave constructed transmission spectra spanning a wavelength range of\n4640-8840A. Our transmission spectrum is inconsistent with a previously claimed\ndetection of potassium in WASP-80b's atmosphere, and is instead most consistent\nwith a haze. We also do not see evidence for sodium absorption at a resolution\nof 100A.\n", "  The ability to perform detailed chemical analysis of Sun-like F-, G-, and\nK-type stars is a powerful tool with many applications including studying the\nchemical evolution of the Galaxy and constraining planet formation theories.\nUnfortunately, complications in modeling cooler stellar atmospheres hinders\nsimilar analysis of M-dwarf stars. Empirically-calibrated methods to measure M\ndwarf metallicity from moderate-resolution spectra are currently limited to\nmeasuring overall metallicity and rely on astrophysical abundance correlations\nin stellar populations. We present a new, empirical calibration of synthetic M\ndwarf spectra that can be used to infer effective temperature, Fe abundance,\nand Ti abundance. We obtained high-resolution (R~25,000), Y-band (~1 micron)\nspectra of 29 M dwarfs with NIRSPEC on Keck II. Using the PHOENIX stellar\natmosphere modeling code (version 15.5), we generated a grid of synthetic\nspectra covering a range of temperatures, metallicities, and\nalpha-enhancements. From our observed and synthetic spectra, we measured the\nequivalent widths of multiple Fe I and Ti I lines and a temperature-sensitive\nindex based on the FeH bandhead. We used abundances measured from\nwidely-separated solar-type companions to empirically calibrate transformations\nto the observed indices and equivalent widths that force agreement with the\nmodels. Our calibration achieves precisions in Teff, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] of 60\nK, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively and is calibrated for 3200 K < Teff <\n4100 K, -0.7 < [Fe/H] < +0.3, and -0.05 < [Ti/Fe] < +0.3. This work is a step\ntoward detailed chemical analysis of M dwarfs at a similar precision achieved\nfor FGK stars.\n", "  With typical periods of order 10 minutes, the pulsation signatures of ZZ Ceti\nvariables (pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarf stars) are severely\nundersampled by long-cadence (29.42 minutes per exposure) K2 observations.\nNyquist aliasing renders the intrinsic frequencies ambiguous, stifling\nprecision asteroseismology. We report the discovery of two new ZZ Cetis in\nlong-cadence K2 data: EPIC 210377280 and EPIC 220274129. Guided by 3-4 nights\nof follow-up, high-speed (<=30 s) photometry from McDonald Observatory, we\nrecover accurate pulsation frequencies for K2 signals that reflected 4-5 times\noff the Nyquist with the full precision of over 70 days of monitoring (~0.01\nmuHz). In turn, the K2 observations enable us to select the correct peaks from\nthe alias structure of the ground-based signals caused by gaps in the\nobservations. We identify at least seven independent pulsation modes in the\nlight curves of each of these stars. For EPIC 220274129, we detect three\ncomplete sets of rotationally split ell=1 (dipole mode) triplets, which we use\nto asteroseismically infer the stellar rotation period of 12.7+/-1.3 hr. We\nalso detect two sub-Nyquist K2 signals that are likely combination (difference)\nfrequencies. We attribute our inability to match some of the K2 signals to the\nground-based data to changes in pulsation amplitudes between epochs of\nobservation. Model fits to SOAR spectroscopy place both EPIC 210377280 and EPIC\n220274129 near the middle of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, with Teff =\n11590+/-200 K and 11810+/-210 K, and masses 0.57+/-0.03 Msun and 0.62+/-0.03\nMsun, respectively.\n", "  We present B and V time series photometry of the M31 satellite galaxy\nAndromeda XXVII (And XXVII) that we observed with the Large Binocular Cameras\nof the Large Binocular Telescope. In the field of And XXVII we have discovered\na total of 90 variables: 89 RR Lyrae stars and 1 Anomalous Cepheid. The average\nperiod of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars (RRab) $\\langle$P$_{\\rm\nab}\\rangle$=0.59 d ($\\sigma$=0.05 d) and the period-amplitude diagram place And\nXXVII in the class of Oosterhoff I/Intermediate objects. Combining information\nfrom the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and the variable stars we find evidence\nfor a single old and metal poor stellar population with [Fe/H]$\\sim -1.8$ dex\nand t$\\sim$13 Gyr in And XXVII. The spatial distribution of RR Lyrae and red\ngiant branch (RGB) stars gives clear indication that And XXVII is a completely\ndisrupted system. This is also supported by the spread observed along the line\nof sight in the distance to the RR Lyrae stars. The highest concentration of\nRGB and RR Lyrae stars is found in a circular area of 4 arcmin in radius,\ncentered about 0.2 degrees in south-east direction from Richardson et al.\n(2011) center coordinates of And XXVII. The CMD of this region is well defined\nwith a prominent RGB and 15 RR Lyrae stars (out of the 18 found in the region)\ntracing a very tight horizontal branch at $\\langle V(RR) \\rangle$ = 25.24 mag\n$\\sigma$= 0.06 mag (average over 15 stars). We show that And XXVII well\nproposes as a candidate building block of the M31 halo.\n", "  The evolution of protoplanetary discs embedded in stellar clusters depends on\nthe age and the stellar density in which they are embedded. Stellar clusters of\nyoung age and high stellar surface density destroy protoplanetary discs by\nexternal photoevaporation and stellar encounters. Here we consider the effect\nof background heating from newly formed stellar clusters on the structure of\nprotoplanetary discs and how it affects the formation of planets in these\ndiscs. Our planet formation model is build on the core accretion scenario\nincluding pebble accretion. We synthesize planet populations that we compare to\nobservations. The giant planets in our simulations migrate over large distances\ndue to the fast type-II migration regime induced by a high disc viscosity\n($\\alpha=5.4 \\times 10^{-3}$). Cold Jupiters (r>1 AU) originate preferably from\nthe outer disc, while hot Jupiters (r<0.1 AU) preferably form in the inner\ndisc. We find that the formation of gas giants via pebble accretion is in\nagreement with the metallicity correlation, meaning that more gas giants are\nformed at larger metallicity. However, our synthetic population of isolated\nstars host a significant amount of giant planets even at low metallicity, in\ncontradiction to observations where giant planets are preferably found around\nhigh metallicity stars, indicating that pebble accretion is very efficient in\nthe standard pebble accretion framework. On the other hand, discs around stars\nembedded in cluster environments hardly form any giant planets at low\nmetallicity in agreement with observations, where these changes originate from\nthe increased temperature in the outer parts of the disc, which prolongs the\ncore accretion time-scale of the planet. We therefore conclude that the outer\ndisc structure and the planet's formation location determines the giant planet\noccurrence rate and the formation efficiency of cold and hot Jupiters.\n", "  We investigate the mass-metallicity relations for the gaseous (MZRgas) and\nstellar components (MZRstar) of local star-forming galaxies based on a\nrepresentative sample from SDSS DR12. The mass-weighted average stellar\nmetallicities are systematically lower than the gas metallicities. This\ndifference in metallicity increases toward galaxies with lower masses and\nreaches 0.4-0.8 dex at 10^9 Msun (depending on the gas metallicity\ncalibration). As a result, the MZRstar is much steeper than the MZRgas. The\nmuch lower metallicities in stars compared to the gas in low mass galaxies\nimplies dramatic metallicity evolution with suppressed metal enrichment at\nearly times. The aim of this paper is to explain the observed large difference\nin gas and stellar metallicity and to infer the origin of the mass-metallicity\nrelations. To this end we develop a galactic chemical evolution model\naccounting for star formation, gas inflow and outflow. By combining the\nobserved mass-metallicity relation for both gas and stellar components to\nconstrain the models, we find that only two scenarios are able to reproduce the\nobservations. Either strong metal outflow or a steep IMF slope at early epochs\nof galaxy evolution is needed. Based on these two scenarios, for the first time\nwe successfully reproduce the observed MZRgas and MZRstar simultaneously,\ntogether with other independent observational constraints in the local\nuniverse. Our model also naturally reproduces the flattening of the MZRgas at\nthe high mass end leaving the MZRstar intact, as seen in observational data.\n", "  We present a phenomological model of the Cosmic Spectral Energy Distribution\n(CSED) and the integrated galactic light (IGL) over all cosmic time. This\nmodel, based on an earlier model by Driver et al. (2013), attributes the cosmic\nstar formation history to two processes -- firstly, chaotic clump accretion and\nmajor mergers, resulting in the early-time formation of bulges and secondly,\ncold gas accretion, resulting in late-time disc formation. Under the assumption\nof a Universal Chabrier initial mass function, we combine the Bruzual & Charlot\n(2003) stellar libraries, the Charlot & Fall (2000) dust attenuation\nprescription and template spectra for emission by dust and active galactic\nnuclei to predict the CSED -- pre- and post-dust attenuation -- and the IGL\nthroughout cosmic time. The phenomological model, as constructed, adopts a\nnumber of basic axioms and empirical results and has minimal free parameters.\nWe compare the model output, as well as predictions from the semi-analytic\nmodel GALFORM to recent estimates of the CSED out to $z=1$. By construction,\nour empirical model reproduces the full energy output of the Universe from the\nultraviolet to the far-infrared extremely well. We use the model to derive\npredictions of the stellar and dust mass densities, again finding good\nagreement. We find that GALFORM predicts the CSED for $z < 0.3$ in good\nagreement with the observations. This agreement becomes increasingly poor\ntowards $z = 1$, when the model CSED is $\\sim$50 per cent fainter. The latter\nis consistent with the model underpredicting the cosmic star formation history.\nAs a consequence, GALFORM predicts a $\\sim$30 per cent fainter IGL.\n", "  We experimentally investigate Andreev transport through the interface between\nan indium superconductor and the edge of the InAs/GaSb bilayer. To cover all\npossible regimes of InAs/GaSb spectrum, we study samples with 10 nm, 12 nm, and\n14 nm thick InAs quantum wells. For the trivial case of a direct band insulator\nin 10~nm samples, differential resistance demonstrates standard Andreev\nreflection. For InAs/GaSb structures with band inversion (12~nm and 14 nm\nsamples), we observe distinct low-energy structures, which we regard as direct\nevidence for the proximity-induced superconductivity within the\ncurrent-carrying edge state. For 14~nm InAs well samples, we additionally\nobserve mesoscopic-like resistance fluctuations, which are subjected to\nthreshold suppression in low magnetic fields.\n", "  A linear gyrokinetic particle-in-cell scheme, which is valid for arbitrary\nperpendicular wavelength $k_\\perp\\rho_i$ and includes the parallel dynamic\nalong the field line, is developed to study the local electrostatic drift modes\nin point and ring dipole plasmas. We find the most unstable mode in this system\ncan be either electron mode or ion mode. The properties and relations of these\nmodes are studied in detail as a function of $k_\\perp\\rho_i$, the density\ngradient $\\kappa_n$, the temperature gradient $\\kappa_T$, electron to ion\ntemperature ratio $\\tau=T_e/T_i$, and mass ratio $m_i/m_e$. For conventional\nweak gradient parameters, the mode is on ground state (with eigenstate number\n$l=0$) and especially $k_\\parallel\\sim0$ for small $k_\\perp\\rho_i$. Thus,\nbounce averaged dispersion relation is also derived for comparison. For strong\ngradient and large $k_\\perp\\rho_i$, most interestingly, higher order eigenstate\nmodes with even (e.g., $l=2,4$) or odd (e.g., $l=1$) parity can be most\nunstable, which is not expected by previous studies. High order eigenstate can\nalso easily be most unstable at weak gradient when $\\tau>10$. This work can be\nparticularly important to understand the turbulent transport in laboratory and\nspace magnetosphere.\n", "  Recent observations have shown that coronal shocks driven by coronal mass\nejections can develop and accelerate particles within several solar radii in\nlarge solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Motivated by this, we present an\nSEP acceleration study including the process that a fast shock propagates\nthrough a streamer-like magnetic field with both closed and open field lines in\nthe low corona region. The acceleration of protons is modeled by numerically\nsolving the Parker transport equation with spatial diffusion both along and\nacross the magnetic field. We show that particles can be sufficiently\naccelerated to up to several hundred MeV within 2-3 solar radii. When the shock\npropagates through a streamer-like magnetic field, particles are more\nefficiently accelerated compared to the case with a simple radial magnetic\nfield, mainly due to perpendicular shock geometry and the natural trapping\neffect of closed magnetic fields. Our results suggest that the coronal magnetic\nfield configuration is an important factor for producing large SEP events. We\nfurther show that the coronal magnetic field configuration strongly influences\nthe distribution of energetic particles, leading to different locations of\nsource regions along the shock front where most of high energy particles are\nconcentrated. This work may have strong implications to SEP observations. The\nupcoming Parker Solar Probe will provide in situ observations for the\ndistribution of energetic particles in the coronal shock region, and test the\nresults of the study.\n", "  We present the first effort to aggregate, homogenize, and uniformly model the\ncombined ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared dataset for the\nelectromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star merger GW170817. By\nassembling all of the available data from 18 different papers and 46 different\ninstruments, we are able to identify and mitigate systematic offsets between\nindividual datasets, and to identify clear outlying measurements, with the\nresulting pruned and adjusted dataset offering an opportunity to expand the\nstudy of the kilonova. The unified dataset includes 647 individual flux\nmeasurements, spanning 0.45 to 29.4 days post-merger, and thus has greater\nconstraining power for physical models than any single dataset. We test a\nnumber of semi-analytical models and find that the data are well modeled with a\nthree-component kilonova model: a \"blue\" lanthanide-poor component with\nMej~0.020 Msol and vej~0.27c; an intermediate opacity \"purple\" component with\nMej~0.047 Msol and vej~0.15c; and a \"red\" lanthanide-rich component with\nMej~0.011 Msol and vej~0.14c. We further explore the possibility of ejecta\nasymmetry and its impact on the estimated parameters. From the inferred\nparameters we draw conclusions about the physical mechanisms responsible for\nthe various ejecta components, the properties of the neutron stars, and,\ncombined with an up-to-date merger rate, the implications for r-process\nenrichment via this channel. To facilitate future studies of this keystone\nevent we make the unified dataset and our modeling code public.\n", "  The Broad Line Region (BLR) in AGN is composed of dense gas ($\\sim 10^{11}$\ncm$^{-3}$) on sub-pc scale, which absorbs about 30 per cent of the ionising\ncontinuum. The outer size of the BLR is likely set by dust sublimation, and its\ndensity by the incident radiation pressure compression (RPC). But, what is the\norigin of this gas, and what sets its covering factor (CF)? Czerny & Hryniewicz\n(2011) suggested that the BLR is a failed dusty wind from the outer accretion\ndisc. We explore the expected dust properties, and the implied BLR structure.\nWe find that graphite grains sublimate only at $T\\simeq 2000$ K at the\npredicted density of $\\sim 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$, and therefore large graphite\ngrains ($\\ge 0.3$ $\\mu$m) survive down to the observed size of the BLR, $R_{\\rm\nBLR}$. The dust opacity in the accretion disc atmosphere is $\\sim 50$ times\nlarger than previously assumed, and leads to an inflated torus-like structure,\nwith a predicted peak height at $R_{\\rm BLR}$. The illuminated surface of this\ntorus-like structure is a natural place for the BLR. The BLR CF is mostly set\nby the gas metallicity, the radiative accretion efficiency, a dynamic\nconfiguration, and ablation by the incident optical-UV continuum. This model\npredicts that the BLR should extend inwards of $R_{\\rm BLR}$ to the disc radius\nwhere the surface temperature is $\\simeq 2000$ K, which occurs at $R_{\\rm\nin}\\simeq 0.18 R_{\\rm BLR}$. The value of $R_{\\rm in}$ can be tested by\nreverberation mapping of the higher ionisation lines, predicted by RPC to peak\nwell inside $R_{\\rm BLR}$. The dust inflated disc scenario can also be tested\nbased on the predicted response of $R_{\\rm BLR}$ and the CF to changes in the\nAGN luminosity and accretion rate.\n", "  We report the analysis of 5 NuSTAR observations of SGR 1806-20 spread over a\nyear from April 2015 to April 2016, more than 11 years following its Giant\nFlare (GF) of 2004. The source spin frequency during the NuSTAR observations\nfollows a linear trend with a frequency derivative\n$\\dot{\\nu}=(-1.25\\pm0.03)\\times10^{-12}$ Hz s$^{-1}$, implying a surface dipole\nequatorial magnetic field $B\\approx7.7\\times10^{14}$ G. Thus, SGR 1806-20 has\nfinally returned to its historical minimum torque level measured between 1993\nand 1998. The source showed strong timing noise for at least 12 years starting\nin 2000, with $\\dot{\\nu}$ increasing one order of magnitude between 2005 and\n2011, following its 2004 major bursting episode and GF. SGR 1806-20 has not\nshown strong transient activity since 2009 and we do not find short bursts in\nthe NuSTAR data. The pulse profile is complex with a pulsed fraction of\n$\\sim8\\%$ with no indication of energy dependence. The NuSTAR spectra are well\nfit with an absorbed blackbody, $kT=0.62\\pm0.06$ keV, plus a power-law,\n$\\Gamma=1.33\\pm0.03$. We find no evidence for variability among the 5\nobservations, indicating that SGR 1806-20 has reached a persistent and\npotentially its quiescent X-ray flux level after its 2004 major bursting\nepisode. Extrapolating the NuSTAR model to lower energies, we find that the\n0.5-10 keV flux decay follows an exponential form with a characteristic\ntimescale $\\tau=543\\pm75$ days. Interestingly, the NuSTAR flux in this energy\nrange is a factor of $\\sim2$ weaker than the long-term average measured between\n1993 and 2003, a behavior also exhibited in SGR $1900+14$. We discuss our\nfindings in the context of the magnetar model.\n", "  The underlying origin of solar eruptive events (SEEs), ranging from giant\ncoronal mass ejections to small coronal-hole jets, is that the lowest-lying\nmagnetic flux in the Sun's corona undergoes the continual buildup of stress and\nfree energy. This magnetic stress has long been observed as the phenomenon of\n\"filament channels:\" strongly sheared magnetic field localized around\nphotospheric polarity inversion lines. However, the mechanism for the stress\nbuildup - the formation of filament channels - is still debated. We present\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of a coronal volume that is driven by\ntransient, cellular boundary flows designed to model the processes by which the\nphotosphere drives the corona. The key feature of our simulations is that they\naccurately preserve magnetic helicity, the topological quantity that is\nconserved even in the presence of ubiquitous magnetic reconnection. Although\nsmall-scale random stress is injected everywhere at the photosphere, driving\nstochastic reconnection throughout the corona, the net result of the magnetic\nevolution is a coherent shearing of the lowest-lying field lines. This highly\ncounter-intuitive result - magnetic stress builds up locally rather than\nspreading out to attain a minimum energy state - explains the formation of\nfilament channels and is the fundamental mechanism underlying SEEs.\nFurthermore, this mechanism may be relevant to other astrophysical or\nlaboratory plasmas.\n", "  JWST$'$s large aperture and wide wavelength coverage will enable it to\ncollect the highest quality transit spectra observed so far. For exoplanetary\natmospheres we expect to retrieve the abundance of the most abundant molecules,\nsuch as H$_2$O, CO, and CH$_4$. Other molecules, such as H$_2$S and PH$_3$,\nhave been observed in Jupiter and Saturn but their chemistry and detectability\nin strongly irradiated planets is highly unknown. In this paper, we make the\nfirst effort to study their spectral features in solar composition atmospheres,\nand evaluate their detectability with JWST. We model the chemistry of\nphosphorus and sulfur in solar composition atmospheres. Our model includes the\neffect of vertical transport. Photochemistry effects are not included in our\ncalculations. Using the abundance profiles, we model the JWST transmission and\nemission spectra for K=6.8 G-type star and for planets with cloud-free solar\ncomposition atmospheres. We find PH$_3$ is detectable at 3 sigma from\ntransmission spectra of the simulated atmosphere with $T_{\\rm eq}$ $<$ 500K\nusing the NIRCam LW grism F444W mode with a total observing time of 28.8 hrs.\nH$_2$S is detectable at 3 sigma in the transmission and emission spectra for\nthe simulated planet with $T_{\\rm eq}$ $>$ 1500K using the NIRCam LW grism\nF322W2 mode with a total observing time of 24.0 hrs. Our results specifically\nhighlight the importance of including H$_2$S for future abundances retrieval\nwith JWST. The presence of clouds and hazes challenges the detections of PH$_3$\nand H$_2$S, but H$_2$S features are still expected to be present in the\nemission spectra.\n", "  In view of the upcoming observations with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT),\nwe present our thoughts on the immediate environment of an astrophysical black\nhole. We are concerned that two approximations used in general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations, namely numerical density floors\nimplemented near the base of the black hole jet, and a magnetic field that\ncomes from large distances, may mislead our interpretation of the observations.\nWe predict that three physical processes will manifest themselves in EHT\nobservations, namely dynamic pair formation just above the horizon,\nelectromagnetic energy dissipation along the boundary of the black hole jet,\nand a region of weak magnetic field separating the black hole jet from the disk\nwind.\n", "  We adopt and analyze results on the incidence and physical properties of\ndamped Ly$\\alpha$ systems (DLAs) to predict the astrophysical impact of gas in\ngalaxies on observations of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Three DLA measures form\nthe basis of this analysis: (i) the HI column density distribution,\nparameterized as a double power-law; (ii) the incidence of DLAs with redshift\n(derived here), $\\ell(z)=A+B \\arctan(z-C)$ with $A=0.236_{-0.021}^{+0.016},\nB=0.168_{-0.017}^{+0.010}, C=2.87_{-0.13}^{+0.17}$ and (iii) the electron\ndensity, parameterized as a log-normal deviate with mean $10^{-2.6} cm^{-3}$\nand dispersion 0.3dex. Synthesizing these results, we estimate that the average\nrest-frame dispersion measure from the neutral medium of a single, intersecting\ngalaxy is DM$^{NM}_{DLA}=0.25$ pc/cm^3. Analysis of AlIII and CII* absorption\nlimits the putative warm ionized medium to contribute\nDM$^{WIM}_{DLA}<20$pc/cm^3. Given the low incidence of DLAs, we find that a\npopulation of FRBs at z=2 will incur DM(z=2)=0.01 pc/cm^3 on average, with a\n99% c.l. upper bound of 0.22 pc/cm^3. Assuming that turbulence of the ISM in\nexternal galaxies is qualitatively similar to our Galaxy, we estimate that the\nangular broadening of an FRB by intersecting galaxies is negligible\n($\\theta<0.1$mas). The temporal broadening is also predicted to be small, $\\tau\n\\approx 0.3$ms for a z=1 galaxy intersecting a z=2 FRB for an observing\nfrequency of $\\nu=1$GHz. Even with $\\nu=600$MHz, the fraction of sightlines\nbroadened beyond 25ms is only approximately 0.1%. We conclude that gas within\nthe ISM of intervening galaxies has a minor effect on the detection of FRBs and\ntheir resultant DM distributions.

Our goal is to study Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)\nfeeding and feedback processes from near-infrared integral-field spectra, that\ninclude both ionized (HII) and hot molecular (H$_2$) emission. This sample is\ncomplemented by other 9 Seyfert galaxies previously observed with NIFS. We show\nthat the host galaxy properties (absolute magnitudes $M_B$, $M_H$, central\nstellar velocity dispersion and axial ratio) show a similar distribution to\nthose of the 69 BAT AGN. For the 20 galaxies already observed, we present\nsurface mass density ($\\Sigma$) profiles for HII and H$_2$ in their inner\n$\\sim$500 pc, showing that HII emission presents a steeper radial gradient than\nH$_2$. This can be attributed to the different excitation mechanisms:\nionization by AGN radiation for HII and heating by X-rays for H$_2$. The mean\nsurface mass densities are in the range ($0.2\\le \\Sigma_{HII} \\le\n35.9$)M$_\\odot$pc$^{-2}$, and ($0.2\\le \\Sigma_{H2} \\le\n13.9$)$\\times10^{-3}$M$_\\odot$pc$^{-2}$, while the ratios between the HII and\nH$_2$ masses range between $\\sim$200 to 8000. The sample presented here will be\nused in future papers to map AGN gas excitation and kinematics, providing a\ncensus of the mass inflow and outflow rates and power as well as their relation\nwith the AGN luminosity.\n", "  We report results from the preliminary trials of Colibri, a dedicated\nfast-photometry array for the detection of small Kuiper belt objects through\nserendipitous stellar occultations. Colibri's novel data processing pipeline\nanalyzed 4000 star hours with two overlapping-field EMCCD cameras, detecting no\nKuiper belt objects and one false positive occultation event in a high ecliptic\nlatitude field. No occultations would be expected at these latitudes, allowing\nthese results to provide a control sample for the upcoming main Colibri\ncampaign. The empirical false positive rate found by the processing pipeline is\nconsistent with the 0.002% simulation-determined false positive rate. We also\ndescribe Colibri's software design, kernel sets for modeling stellar\noccultations, and method for retrieving occultation parameters from noisy\ndiffraction curves. Colibri's main campaign will begin in mid-2018, operating\nat a 40 Hz sampling rate.\n", "  GOES soft X-ray light curves are used to measure the timing and duration of\nsolar flare emission. The timing and duration of the magnetic reconnection and\nsubsequent energy release which drives solar flares are unknown, though the\nlight curves are presumably related. It is therefore critical to understand the\nphysics which connects the two: how does the time scale of reconnection produce\nan observed GOES light curve? In this work, we model the formation and\nexpansion of an arcade of loops with a hydrodynamic model, which we then use to\nsynthesize GOES light curves. We calculate the FWHM and the e-folding decay\ntime of the light curves and compare them to the separation of the centroids of\nthe two ribbons which the arcade spans, which is representative of the size\nscale of the loops. We reproduce a linear relation between the two, as found\nobservationally in previous work. We show that this demonstrates a direct\nconnection between the duration of energy release and the evolution of these\nlight curves. We also show that the cooling processes of individual loops\ncomprising the flare arcade directly affect the measured time scales. From the\nclear consistency between the observed and modeled linearity, we conclude that\nthe primary factors that control the flare time scales are the duration of\nreconnection and the loop lengths.\n", "  Time-variable absorption by water vapor in Earth's atmosphere presents an\nimportant source of systematic error for a wide range of ground-based\nastronomical measurements, particularly at near-infrared wavelengths. We\npresent results from the first study on the temporal and spatial variability of\nwater vapor absorption at Apache Point Observatory (APO). We analyze\n$\\sim$400,000 high-resolution, near-infrared ($H$-band) spectra of hot stars\ncollected as calibration data for the APO Galactic Evolution Explorer (APOGEE)\nsurvey. We fit for the optical depths of telluric water vapor absorption\nfeatures in APOGEE spectra and convert these optical depths to Precipitable\nWater Vapor (PWV) using contemporaneous data from a GPS-based PWV monitoring\nstation at APO. Based on simultaneous measurements obtained over a 3$^{\\circ}$\nfield of view, we estimate that our PWV measurement precision is $\\pm0.11$ mm.\nWe explore the statistics of PWV variations over a range of timescales from\nless than an hour to days. We find that the amplitude of PWV variations within\nan hour is less than 1 mm for most (96.5%) APOGEE field visits. By considering\nAPOGEE observations that are close in time but separated by large distances on\nthe sky, we find that PWV is homogeneous across the sky at a given epoch, with\n90% of measurements taken up to 70$^{\\circ}$ apart within 1.5 hr having\n$\\Delta\\,\\rm{PWV}<1.0$ mm. Our results can be used to help simulate the impact\nof water vapor absorption on upcoming surveys at continental observing sites\nlike APO, and also to help plan for simultaneous water vapor metrology that may\nbe carried out in support of upcoming photometric and spectroscopic surveys.\n", "  We present visible spectra of Ag-like ($4d^{10}4f$) and Cd-like\n($4d^{10}4f^2$) ions of Ho (atomic number $Z=67$), Er (68), and Tm (69)\nobserved with a compact electron beam ion trap. For Ag-like ions, prominent\nemission corresponding to the M1 transitions between the ground state fine\nstructure splitting $4f_{5/2}$--$4f_{7/2}$ is identified. For Cd-like ions,\nseveral M1 transitions in the ground state configuration are identified. The\ntransition wavelength and the transition probability are calculated with the\nrelativistic many-body perturbation theory and the relativistic CI + all-order\napproach. Comparisons between the experiments and the calculations show good\nagreement.\n", "  The Kepler observations indicate that many exoplanets are super-Earths, which\nbrings about a puzzle for the core-accretion scenario. Since observed\nsuper-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas\nefficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to\nbe rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we\npropose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat\ntransport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is\ninvestigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate\npseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the\nradiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling\nluminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for\nthe turbulent diffusivity, $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$. If $\\nu_{\\rm turb}>\\nu_{\\rm\ncritical} $, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet\nwould become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant. We find that even a small\nvalue of turbulent diffusion has influential effects on evolutions of\nsuper-Earths. $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$ increases with the core mass. We further\nascertain that, within the minimum mass extrasolar nebula (MMEN), $\\nu_{\\rm\ncritical}$ increases with the semi-major axis. This may explain the feature\nthat super-Earths are common in inner PPD regions, while gas giants are common\nin the outer PPD regions. The predicted envelope mass fraction (EMF) is not\nfully consistent with observations. We discuss physical processes, such as late\ncore assembly and mass loss mechanisms, that may be operating during\nsuper-Earth formation.\n", "  In this article we demonstrate the injection locking of recently demonstrated\nspintronic feedback nano oscillator to microwave magnetic fields at integers as\nwell fractional multiples of its auto oscillation frequency. Feedback\noscillators have delay as a new degree of freedom which is absent for\nspin-transfer torque based oscillators, which gives rise to side peaks along\nwith a main peak. We show that it is also possible to lock the oscillator on\nits side band peaks, which opens a new avenue to phase locked oscillators with\nlarge frequency differences. We observe that for low driving fields, side band\nlocking improves the quality factor of the main peak, whereas for higher\ndriving fields the main peak is suppressed. Further, measurements at two field\nangles provide some insight into the role of symmetry of oscillation orbit in\ndetermining the fractional locking.\n", "  We present the results of a multi-frequency, time-averaged analysis of\nblazars included in the Candidate Gamma-ray Blazar Survey catalog. Our sample\nconsists of 324 $\\gamma$-ray detected ($\\gamma$-ray loud) and 191 non\n$\\gamma$-ray detected ($\\gamma$-ray quiet) blazars, and we consider all the\ndata up to 2016 April 1. We find that both the $\\gamma$-ray loud and the\n$\\gamma$-ray quiet blazar populations occupy similar regions in the WISE\ncolor-color diagram, and in the radio and X-ray bands $\\gamma$-ray loud sources\nare brighter. A simple one-zone synchrotron inverse-Compton emission model is\napplied to derive the physical properties of both populations. We find that the\ncentral black hole mass and the accretion disk luminosity ($L_{\\rm disk}$)\ncomputed from the modeling of the optical-UV emission with a Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk reasonably matches with that estimated from the optical spectroscopic\nemission-line information. A significantly larger Doppler boosting in the\n$\\gamma$-ray loud blazars is noted, and their jets are more radiatively\nefficient. On the other hand, the $\\gamma$-ray quiet objects are more\nMeV-peaked, thus could be potential targets for next-generation MeV missions.\nOur results confirm the earlier findings about the accretion-jet connection in\nblazars; however, many of the $\\gamma$-ray quiet blazars tend to deviate from\nthe recent claim that the jet power exceeds $L_{\\rm disk}$ in blazars. A\nbroadband study, considering a larger set of $\\gamma$-ray quiet objects and\nalso including BL Lacs, will be needed to confirm/reject this hypothesis and\nalso to verify the evolution of the powerful high-redshift blazars into their\nlow-power nearby counterparts.\n", "  The spatial velocities of the stars with high-precision positions, proper\nmotions and parallaxes from the Gaia TGAS catalog and line-of-sight velocities\nfrom the RAVE5 catalog are considered. From the sample of 92395 stars with the\nage estimates we have obtained the following kinematic parameters:\n(U,V,W)=(9.42,20.34,7.21)+/-0.12,0.10,0.09) km/s, \\Omega=26.29+/-0.39 km/s/kpc\nand \\Omega'=-3.89+/-0.08 km/s/kpc^2, where V0=210+/-6 km/s (for adopted\nR0=8.0+/-0.2 kpc), and the Oort constants A=15.57+/-0.31 km/s/kpc and\nB=-10.72+/-0.50 km/s/kpc. It is shown that the parameters \\Omega and \\Omega'\nare stable to the star age. A comparative analysis of the Bottlinger model\nparameters obtained separately from the RAVE5 catalog line-of-sight velocities\nand the Gaia TGAS, UCAC4 and PPMXL catalogs proper motion has been made. It is\nshown that these parameters are in good agreement with each other when derived\nfrom the proper motions of both the terrestrial catalogs and catalog Gaia TGAS.\nAt the same time, it was established that the values of the Bottlinger model\nparameters obtained from the line-of-sight velocities can differ from the\ncorresponding parameters obtained from the proper motions. The reduction of the\nline-of-sight velocities from the RAVE5 catalog is proposed for eliminating\nthese differences.\n", "  HESS J1614$-$518 and HESS J1616$-$508 are two tera-electron volt (TeV)\n$\\gamma$-ray sources that are not firmly associated with any known counterparts\nat other wavelengths. We investigate the distribution of interstellar medium\ntowards the TeV $\\gamma$-ray sources using results from a 7 mm-wavelength Mopra\nstudy, the Mopra Southern Galactic Plane CO Survey, the Millimetre Astronomer's\nLegacy Team - 45 GHz survey and [CI] data from the HEAT telescope. Data in the\nCO(1$-$0) transition lines reveal diffuse gas overlapping the two TeV sources\nat several velocities along the line of sight, while observations in the\nCS(1$-$0) transition line reveal several interesting dense gas features. To\naccount for the diffuse atomic gas, archival HI data was taken from the\nSouthern Galactic Plane Survey. The observations reveal gas components with\nmasses $\\sim10^3$ to $10^5$ M$_\\odot$ and with densities $\\sim10^2$ to $10^3$\ncm$^{-3}$ overlapping the two TeV sources. Several origin scenarios potentially\nassociated with the TeV $\\gamma$-ray sources are discussed in light of the\ndistribution of the local interstellar medium. We find no strong convincing\nevidence linking any counterpart with HESS J1614$-$518 or HESS J1616$-$508.\n", "  Understanding the early stages of star formation is a research field of\nongoing development, both theoretically and observationally. In this context,\nmolecular data have been continuously providing observational constraints on\nthe gas dynamics at different excitation conditions and depths in the sources.\nWe have investigated the Barnard 59 core, the only active site of star\nformation in the Pipe Nebula, to achieve a comprehensive view of the kinematic\nproperties of the source. These information were derived by simultaneously\nfitting ammonia inversion transition lines (1,1) and (2,2). Our analysis\nunveils the imprint of protostellar feedback, such as increasing line widths,\ntemperature and turbulent motions in our molecular data. Combined with\ncomplementary observations of dust thermal emission, we estimate that the core\nis gravitationally bound following a virial analysis. If the core is not\ncontracting, another source of internal pressure, most likely the magnetic\nfield, is supporting it against gravitational collapse and limits its star\nformation efficiency.\n", "  Her X-1 is an accreting neutron star in an intermediate-mass X-ray binary.\nLike low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), it accretes via Roche-lobe overflow, but\nsimilar to many high-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star, Her X-1 has\na strong magnetic field and slow spin. Here, we present the discovery of radio\nemission from Her X-1 with the Very Large Array. During the radio observation,\nthe central X-ray source was partially obscured by a warped disk. We measure a\nradio flux density of $38.7 \\pm 4.8$ $\\mu$Jy at $9$ GHz but can not constrain\nthe spectral shape. We discuss possible origins of the radio emission, and\nconclude that coherent emission, a stellar wind, shocks and a propeller outflow\nare all unlikely explanations. A jet, as seen in LMXBs, is consistent with the\nobserved radio properties. We consider the implications of the presence of a\njet in Her X-1 on jet formation mechanisms and on the launcing of jets by\nneutron stars with strong magnetic fields.\n", "  We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the likely\nstellar counterpart to the unassociated \\emph{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT)\n$\\gamma$-ray source 2FGL J0846.0+2820, selected for study based on positional\ncoincidences of optical variables with unassociated LAT sources. Using optical\nspectroscopy from the SOAR telescope, we have identified a late-G giant in an\neccentric ($e$ = 0.06) 8.133 day orbit with an invisible primary. Modeling the\nspectroscopy and photometry together lead us to infer a heavy neutron star\nprimary of $\\sim 2 M_{\\odot}$ and a partially stripped giant secondary of $\\sim\n0.8 M_{\\odot}$. H$\\alpha$ emission is observed in some of the spectra, perhaps\nconsistent with the presence of a faint accretion disk. We find the\n$\\gamma$-ray flux of 2FGL J0846.0+2820 dropped substantially in mid-2009,\naccompanied by an increased variation in the optical brightness, and since then\nit has not been detected by \\emph{Fermi}. The long period and giant secondary\nare reminiscent of the $\\gamma$-ray bright binary 1FGL J1417.7--4407, which\nhosts a millisecond pulsar apparently in the final stages of the pulsar\nrecycling process. The discovery of 2FGL J0846.0+2820 suggests the\nidentification of a new subclass of millisecond pulsar binaries that are the\nlikely progenitors of typical field millisecond pulsars.\n", "  Exoplanet properties depend on how well the host star is characterized. For\ninstance, the stellar atmospheric parameters (i.e., effective temperature,\nsurface gravity and overall metallicity) are needed to derive the stellar mass\nand radius by using evolutionary stellar models or empirical calibrations. I\nstudied how the stellar uncertainties impact the determination of planetary\ncharacteristics. By using high-resolution spectra and iSpec, I evaluated how\ndiscrepancies between two different spectroscopic approaches (the equivalent\nmethod and the synthetic spectral fitting technique) can significantly affect\nthe stellar radius estimation, hence, the exoplanet radius and its possible\nchemical composition.\n", "  We perform two-dimensional simulations to study how the wind strength changes\nwith accretion rate. We take into account bremsstrahlung, synchrotron radiation\nand the Comptonization. We find that when the accretion rate is low, radiative\ncooling is not important, the accretion flow is hot accretion flow. For the hot\naccretion flow, wind is very strong. The mass flux of wind can be $\\sim 50\\%$\nof the mass inflow rate. When the accretion rate increases to a value at which\nradiative cooling rate is roughly equal to or slightly larger than viscous\nheating rate, cold clumps can form around the equatorial plane. In this case,\nthe gas pressure gradient force is small and wind is very weak. Our results may\nbe useful for the sub-grid model of active galactic nuclear feedback study.\n", "  We study the occurrence of spectroscopic binaries in young star-forming\nregions using the INfrared Spectroscopy of Young Nebulous Clusters(IN-SYNC)\nsurvey, carried out in SDSS-III with the APOGEE spectrograph. Multi-epoch\nobservations of thousands of low-mass stars in Orion A, NGC 2264, NGC 1333, IC\n348, and the Pleiades have been carried out, yielding H-band spectra with a\nnominal resolution of R=22,500 for sources with H $\\le$ 12 mag. Radial velocity\nprecisions of $\\sim$0.3 $km\\:s^{-1}$ were achieved, which we use to identify\nradial velocity variations indicative of undetected companions. We use Monte\nCarlo simulations to assess the types of spectroscopic binaries to which we are\nsensitive, finding sensitivity to binaries with orbital periods $< 10^{4}$ d,\nfor stars with $2500 {\\rm K} \\le T_\\mathrm{eff} \\le 6000 {\\rm K}$ and $\\it{v}\n\\sin \\it{i}$ $\\le$ 100 $km\\:s^{-1}$. Using Bayesian inference, we find evidence\nfor a decline in the spectroscopic binary fraction, by a factor of 3-4 from the\nage of our pre-main-sequence sample to the Pleiades age . The significance of\nthis decline is weakened if spot-induced radial-velocity jitter is strong in\nthe sample, and is only marginally significant when comparing any one of the\npre-main-sequence clusters against the Pleiades. However, the same decline in\nboth sense and magnitude is found for each of the five pre-main-sequence\nclusters, and the decline reaches statistical significance of greater than 95%\nconfidence when considering the pre-main-sequence clusters jointly. Our results\nsuggest that dynamical processes disrupt the widest spectroscopic binaries\n($P_{\\rm orb} \\approx 10^3 - 10^4$ d) as clusters age, indicating that this\noccurs early in the stars' evolution, while they still reside within their\nnascent clusters.\n", "  1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua), a recently discovered asteroid in a hyperbolic orbit,\nis likely the first macroscopic object of extrasolar origin identified in the\nsolar system. Here, we present imaging and spectroscopic observations of\n\\textquoteleft Oumuamua using the Palomar Hale Telescope as well as a search of\nmeteor activity potentially linked to this object using the Canadian Meteor\nOrbit Radar. We find that \\textquoteleft Oumuamua exhibits a moderate spectral\ngradient of $10\\%\\pm6\\%~(100~\\mathrm{nm})^{-1}$, a value significantly lower\nthan that of outer solar system bodies, indicative of a formation and/or\nprevious residence in a warmer environment. Imaging observation and spectral\nline analysis show no evidence that \\textquoteleft Oumuamua is presently\nactive. Negative meteor observation is as expected, since ejection driven by\nsublimation of commonly-known cometary species such as CO requires an extreme\nejection speed of $\\sim40$ m s$^{-1}$ at $\\sim100$ au in order to reach the\nEarth. No obvious candidate stars are proposed as the point of origin for\n\\textquoteleft Oumuamua. Given a mean free path of $\\sim10^9$ ly in the solar\nneighborhood, \\textquoteleft Oumuamua has likely spent a very long time in the\ninterstellar space before encountering the solar system.\n", "  While a variety of fundamental differences are known to separate\ntwo-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fluid flows, it is not well\nunderstood how they are related. Conventionally, dimensional reduction is\njustified by an \\emph{a priori} geometrical framework; i.e., 2D flows occur\nunder some geometrical constraint such as shallowness. However, deeper inquiry\ninto 3D flow often finds the presence of local 2D-like structures without such\na constraint, where 2D-like behavior may be identified by the integrability of\nvortex lines or vanishing local helicity. Here we propose a new paradigm of\nflow structure by introducing an intermediate class, termed epi-2-dimensional\nflow, and thereby build a topological bridge between 2D and 3D flows. The\nepi-2D property is local, and is preserved in fluid elements obeying ideal\n(inviscid and barotropic) mechanics; a local epi-2D flow may be regarded as a\n`particle' carrying a generalized enstrophy as its charge. A finite viscosity\nmay cause `fusion' of two epi-2D particles, generating helicity from their\ncharges giving rise to 3D flow.\n", "  In a recent study, we took advantage of a highly tilted coronal neutral sheet\nto show that density structures, extending radially over several solar radii\n(Rs), are released in the forming slow solar wind approximately 4-5 Rs above\nthe solar surface (Sanchez-Diaz et al. 2017). We related the signatures of this\nformation process to intermittent magnetic reconnection occurring continuously\nabove helmet streamers. We now exploit the heliospheric imagery from the Solar\nTerrestrial Relation Observatory (STEREO) to map the spatial and temporal\ndistribution of the ejected structures. We demonstrate that streamers\nexperience quasi-periodic bursts of activity with the simultaneous outpouring\nof small transients over a large range of latitudes in the corona. This cyclic\nactivity leads to the emergence of well-defined and broad structures.\nDerivation of the trajectories and kinematic properties of the individual small\ntransients that make up these large-scale structures confirms their association\nwith the forming Slow Solar Wind (SSW). We find that these transients are\nreleased, on average, every 19.5 hours, simultaneously at all latitudes with a\ntypical radial size of 12 Rs. Their spatial distribution, release rate and\nthree-dimensional extent are used to estimate the contribution of this cyclic\nactivity to the mass flux carried outward by the SSW. Our results suggest that,\nin interplanetary space, the global structure of the heliospheric current sheet\nis dominated by a succession of blobs and associated flux ropes. We\ndemonstrated this with an example event using STEREO-A in-situ measurements.\n", "  Solar eruptions are the most spectacular events in our solar system and are\nassociated with many different signatures of energy release including solar\nflares, coronal mass ejections, global waves, radio emission and accelerated\nparticles. Here, we apply the Coronal Pulse Identification and Tracking\nAlgorithm (CorPITA) to the high cadence synoptic data provided by the Solar\nDynamic Observatory (SDO) to identify and track global waves observed by SDO.\n164 of the 362 solar flare events studied (45%) are found to have associated\nglobal waves with no waves found for the remaining 198 (55%). A clear linear\nrelationship was found between the median initial velocity and the acceleration\nof the waves, with faster waves exhibiting a stronger deceleration (consistent\nwith previous results). No clear relationship was found between global waves\nand type II radio bursts, electrons or protons detected in-situ near Earth.\nWhile no relationship was found between the wave properties and the associated\nflare size (with waves produced by flares from B to X-class), more than a\nquarter of the active regions studied were found to produce more than one wave\nevent. These results suggest that the presence of a global wave in a solar\neruption is most likely determined by the structure and connectivity of the\nerupting active region and the surrounding quiet solar corona rather than by\nthe amount of free energy available within the active region.\n", "  Radio emission from protostellar jets is usually dominated by free-free\nemission from thermal electrons. However, in some cases, it has been proposed\nthat non-thermal emission could also be present. This additional contribution\nfrom non-thermal emission has been inferred through negative spectral indices\nat centimeter wavelengths in some regions of the radio jets. In the case of HH\n80-81, one of the most powerful protostellar jets known, linearly polarized\nemission has also been detected, revealing that the non-thermal emission is of\nsynchrotron nature from a population of relativistic particles in the jet. This\nresult implies that an acceleration mechanism should be taking place in some\nparts of the jet. Here, we present new high sensitivity and high angular\nresolution radio observations at several wavelengths (in the 3-20 cm range) of\nthe HH80-81 radio jet. These new observations represent an improvement in\nsensitivity and angular resolution by a factor of $\\sim$10 with respect to\nprevious observations. This allows us to resolve the morphology of the radio\njet, and to study the different emission mechanisms involved through spectral\nindex maps. We conclude that synchrotron emission in this jet arises from an\nextended component detected at low frequencies and from the termination points\nof the jet, where strong shocks against the ambient medium can produce\nefficient particle acceleration.\n", "  A search for temporal changes on Pluto and Charon was motivated by (1) the\ndiscovery of young surfaces in the Pluto system that imply ongoing or recent\ngeologic activity, (2) the detection of active plumes on Triton during the\nVoyager 2 flyby, and (3) the abundant and detailed information that observing\ngeologic processes in action provides about the processes. A thorough search\nfor temporal changes using New Horizons images was completed. Images that\ncovered the same region were blinked and manually inspected for any differences\nin appearance. The search included full-disk images such that all illuminated\nregions of both bodies were investigated and higher resolution images such that\nparts of the encounter hemispheres were investigated at finer spatial scales.\nChanges of appearance between different images were observed but in all cases\nwere attributed to variability of the imaging parameters (especially geometry)\nor artifacts. No differences of appearance that are strongly indicative of a\ntemporal change were found on the surface or in the atmosphere of either Pluto\nor Charon. Limits on temporal changes as a function of spatial scale and\ntemporal interval during the New Horizons encounter are determined. The longest\ntime interval constraint is one Pluto/Charon rotation period (~6.4 Earth days).\nContrast reversal and high-phase bright features that change in appearance with\nsolar phase angle are identified. The change of appearance of these features is\nmost likely due to the change in phase angle rather than a temporal change. Had\nactive plumes analogous to the plumes discovered on Triton been present on the\nencounter hemispheres of either Pluto or Charon, they would have been detected.\nThe absence of active plumes may be due to temporal variability (i.e., plumes\ndo occur but none were active on the encounter hemispheres during the epoch of\nthe New Horizons encounter ...\n", "  The geodesics on the $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime are considered\nstudying how their parameters are determined by the conserved quantities in the\nconformal Euclidean, Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker, de\nSitter-Painlev\\'e and static local charts with Cartesian space coordinates.\nMoreover, it is shown that there exist a special static chart in which the\ngeodesics are genuine hyperbolas whose asymptotes are given by the conserved\nmomentum and the associated dual momentum.\n", "  The UV spectra of Galactic and extragalactic sightlines often show OVI\nabsorption lines at a range of redshifts, and from a variety of sources from\nthe Galactic circumgalactic medium to AGN outflows. Inner shell OVI absorption\nis also observed in X-ray spectra (at lambda=22.03 AA), but the column density\ninferred from the X-ray line was consistently larger than that from the UV\nline. Here we present a solution to this discrepancy for the z=0 systems. The\nOII K-beta line ^4S^0 --> (^3D)3p ^4P at 562.40 eV (==22.04 AA) is blended with\nthe OVI K-alpha line in X-ray spectra. We estimate the strength of this OII\nline in two different ways and show that in most cases the OII line accounts\nfor the entire blended line. The small amount of OVI equivalent width present\nin some cases has column density entirely consistent with the UV value. This\nsolution to the OVI discrepancy, however, does not apply to the high column\ndensity systems like AGN outflows. We discuss other possible causes to explain\ntheir UV/X-ray mismatch. The OVI and OII lines will be resolved by gratings\non-board the proposed mission Arcus and the concept mission Lynx and would\nallow detection of weak OVI lines not just at z=0 but also at higher redshift.\n", "  The asymmetric quantum Rabi model with broken parity invariance shows\nspectral degeneracies in the integer case, that is when the asymmetry parameter\nequals an integer multiple of half the oscillator frequency, thus hinting at a\nhidden symmetry and accompanying integrability of the model. We study the\nexpectation values of spin observables for each eigenstate and observe\ncharacteristic differences between the integer and noninteger cases for the\nasymptotics in the deep strong coupling regime, which can be understood from a\nperturbative expansion in the qubit splitting. We also construct a parent\nHamiltonian whose exact eigenstates possess the same symmetries as the\nperturbative eigenstates of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model in the integer\ncase.\n", "  In this paper we report suspended silicon waveguides operating at a\nwavelength of 7.67 mm with a propagation loss of 3.1 ? 0.3 dB/cm. To our\nknowledge this is the first demonstration of low loss silicon waveguides at\nsuch a long wavelength, with loss comparable to other platforms that use more\nexotic materials. The suspended Si waveguide core is supported by a\nsubwavelength grating that provides lateral optical confinement, while also\nallowing access to the buried oxide layer so that it can be wet etched using\nhydrofluoric acid. We also demonstrate low loss waveguide bends and s-bends.\n", "  The sunspot position from Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR), US Air\nForce Solar Optical Observing Network and National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (USAF/NOAA), and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) data\nbases in the period 1874 to 2016 were used to calculate yearly values of the\nsolar differential-rotation parameters $A$ and $B$. The calculated\ndifferential-rotation parameters were compared with the solar-activity level.\nWe found that the Sun rotates more differentially at the minimum than at the\nmaximum of activity during the 1977 - 2016 epoch. An inverse correlation\nbetween equatorial rotation and solar activity was found using the recently\nrevised sunspot number. The secular decrease of equatorial rotation rate\naccompanying the increase of activity stopped in the last part of the 20th\ncentury. It was noted that when a significant peak of equatorial rotation\nvelocity is observed during minimum of activity, the strength of the next\nmaximum is smaller than the previous one.\n", "  We use the first data release of the Gaia mission to explore the three\ndimensional arrangement and the age ordering of the many stellar groups towards\nthe Orion OB association, aiming at a new classification and characterization\nof the stellar population. We make use of the parallaxes and proper motions\nprovided in the Tycho Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) sub-set of the Gaia\ncatalogue, and of the combination of Gaia and 2MASS photometry. In TGAS we find\nevidence for the presence of a young population, at a parallax $\\varpi \\sim\n2.65 \\, \\mathrm{mas}$, loosely distributed around some known clusters: 25 Ori,\n$\\epsilon$ Ori and $\\sigma$ Ori, and NGC 1980 ($\\iota$ Ori). The low mass\ncounterpart of this population is visible in the color-magnitude diagrams\nconstructed by combining Gaia and 2MASS photometry. We study the density\ndistribution of the young sources in the sky. We find the same groups as in\nTGAS, and also some other density enhancements that might be related to the\nrecently discovered Orion X group, the Orion dust ring, and to the $\\lambda$\nOri complex. We estimate the ages of this population and we infer the presence\nof an age gradient going from 25 Ori (13-15 Myr) to the ONC (1-2 Myr). We\nconfirm this age ordering by repeating the Bayesian fit using the Pan-STARRS1\ndata. The estimated ages towards the NGC 1980 cluster span a broad range of\nvalues. This can either be due to the presence of two populations coming from\ntwo different episodes of star formation or to a large spread along the line of\nsight of the same population. Our results form the first step towards using the\nGaia data to unravel the complex star formation history of the Orion region in\nterms of the different star formation episodes, their duration, and their\neffects on the surrounding interstellar medium.\n", "  Nuclear burning and its dependence on the mass accretion rate are fundamental\ningredients for describing the complicated observational phenomenology of\nneutron stars in binary systems. Motivated by high quality burst rate data\nemerging from large statistical studies, we report general calculations\nrelating bursting rate to mass accretion rate and neutron star rotation\nfrequency. In this first work we neglect general relativistic effects and\naccretion topology, though we discuss where their inclusion should play a role.\nThe relations we derive are suitable for different burning regimes and provide\na direct link between parameters predicted by theory and what is to be expected\nin observations. We illustrate this for analytical relations of different\nunstable burning regimes that operate on the surface of an accreting neutron\nstar. We also use the observed behaviour of burst rate to suggest new\nconstraints on burning parameters. We are able to provide an explanation for\nthe long standing problem of the observed decrease of burst rate with\nincreasing mass accretion that follows naturally from these calculations: when\naccretion rate crosses a certain threshold, ignition moves away from its\ninitially preferential site and this can cause a net reduction of the burst\nrate due to the effects of local conditions that set local differences in both\nburst rate and stabilization criteria. We show under which conditions this can\nhappen even if locally the burst rate keeps increasing with accretion.\n", "  We calculate at the leading order in $\\alpha_s$ the QCD amplitude for\nexclusive neutrino production of a $D^*$ or $D_s^*$ charmed vector meson on a\nnucleon. We work in the framework of the collinear QCD approach where\ngeneralized parton distributions (GPDs) factorize from perturbatively\ncalculable coefficient functions. We include $O(m_c)$ terms in the coefficient\nfunctions and $O(m_D)$ term in the definition of heavy meson distribution\namplitudes. The show that the analysis of the angular distribution of the decay\n$D_{(s)}^*\\to D_{(s)} \\pi$ allows to access the transversity gluon GPDs.\n", "  The Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX) mission has recently studied the\nflow of interstellar neutral He atoms through the solar system, and discovered\nthe existence of a secondary He flow likely originating in the outer\nheliosheath. We find evidence for this secondary component in Ulysses data. By\ncoadding hundreds of Ulysses He beam maps together to maximize signal-to-noise,\nwe identify a weak signal that is credibly associated with the secondary\ncomponent. Assuming a laminar flow from infinity, we infer the following He\nflow parameters: V=12.8+/-1.9 km/s, lambda=74.4+/-1.8 deg, beta=-10.5+/-4.1\ndeg, and T=3000+/-1100 K; where lambda and beta are the ecliptic longitude and\nlatitude direction in J2000 coordinates. The secondary component has a density\nthat is 4.9+/-0.9% that of the primary component. These measurements are\nreasonably consistent with measurements from IBEX, with the exception of\ntemperature, where our temperature is much lower than IBEX's T=9500 K. Even the\nhigher IBEX temperature is suspiciously low compared to expectactions for the\nouter heliosheath source region. The implausibly low temperatures are due to\nthe incorrect assumption of a laminar flow instead of a diverging one, given\nthat the flow in the outer heliosheath source region will be deflecting around\nthe heliopause. As for why the IBEX and Ulysses T values are different,\ndifficulties with background subtraction in the Ulysses data are a potential\nsource of concern, but the discrepancy may also be another effect of the\nimproper laminar flow assumption, which could affect the IBEX and Ulysses\nanalyses differently.\n", "  Many stars, active galactic nuclei, accretion discs etc. are affected by the\nstochastic variations of temperature, turbulent gas motions, magnetic fields,\nnumber densities of atoms and dust grains. These stochastic variations\ninfluence on the extinction factors, Doppler widths of lines and so on. The\npresence of many reasons for fluctuations gives rise to Gaussian distribution\nof fluctuations. The usual models leave out of account the fluctuations. In\nmany cases the consideration of fluctuations improves the coincidence of\ntheoretical values with the observed data. The objective of this paper is the\ninvestigation of the influence of the number density fluctuations on the form\nof radiative transfer equations. We consider non-magnetized atmosphere in\ncontinuum.\n", "  Aims. In this paper, we aim to measure the strength of the surface magnetic\nfields for a sample of five intermediate mass T Tauri stars and one low mass T\nTauri star from late-F to mid-K spectral types. While magnetic fields of T\nTauri stars at the low mass range have been extensively characterized, our work\ncomplements previous studies towards the intermediate mass range; this\ncomplementary study is key to evaluate how magnetic fields evolve during the\ntransition from a convective to a radiative core.\n  Methods. We studied the Zeeman broadening of magnetically sensitive spectral\nlines in the H-band spectra obtained with the CRIRES high-resolution\nnear-infrared spectrometer. These data are modelled using magnetic spectral\nsynthesis and model atmospheres. Additional constraints on non-magnetic line\nbroadening mechanisms are obtained from modelling molecular lines in the K band\nor atomic lines in the optical wavelength region.\n  Results. We detect and measure mean surface magnetic fields for five of the\nsix stars in our sample: CHXR 28, COUP 107, V2062 Oph, V1149 Sco, and Par 2441.\nMagnetic field strengths inferred from the most magnetically sensitive\ndiagnostic line range from 0.8 to 1.8 kG. We also estimate a magnetic field\nstrength of 1.9 kG for COUP 107 from an alternative diagnostic. The magnetic\nfield on YLW 19 is the weakest in our sample and is marginally detected, with a\nstrength of 0.8 kG.\n  Conclusions. We populate an uncharted area of the pre-main-sequence HR\ndiagram with mean magnetic field measurements from high-resolution\nnear-infrared spectra. Our sample of intermediate mass T Tauri stars in general\nexhibits weaker magnetic fields than their lower mass counterparts. Our\nmeasurements will be used in combination with other spectropolarimetric studies\nof intermediate mass and lower mass T Tauri stars to provide input into\npre-main-sequence stellar evolutionary models.\n", "  Impact bombardment on Mercury in the solar system late accretion phase (ca.\n4.4 to 3.8 Ga) caused considerable mechanical, chemical and thermal reworking\nof its silicate reservoirs (crust and mantle). Depending on the frequency, size\nand velocity of such impactors, effects included regional and global scale\ncrustal melting, and thermal perturbations of the mercurian mantle. We use a 3D\ntransient heating model to test the effects of two bombardment scenarios on\nearly (pre Tolstojan) Mercury mantle and crust. Results show that rare impacts\nby the largest (greater than 100 km diameter) bodies deliver sufficient heat to\nthe shallow mercurian mantle producing high-temperature ultra-magnesian\n(komatiitic s.s.) melts. Impact heating leading to effusive (flood) volcanism\ncan account for eponymous High-Magnesium Region (HMR) observed during the\nMErcury Surface, Space Environment, GEochemistry Ranging (MESSENGER) mission.\nWe find that late accretion to Mercury induced volumetrically significant\ncrustal melting (less than 58 vol.percent), mantle heating and melt production,\nwhich, combined with extensive resurfacing (less than 100 percent), also\nexplains why its oldest cratering record was effectively erased, consistent\nwith crater-counting statistics.\n", "  We incorporate clockwork mechanism into the Standard Model flavour sector and\nshow that the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing can be obtained\nwithout any unnaturally small or large parameter in the fundamental theory. By\nintroducing $N_f$ pairs of vectorlike fermions, as clockwork gears, for each\ngeneration of the Standard Model fermions and setting up a characteristic\nclockwork potential, it is shown that the inter-generational mass hierarchies\nare determined by $N_f$. For a given type of fermions, strong or mild hierarchy\nin the masses and mixing parameters can be obtained by taking the large or\nsmall value of $N_f$. The mechanism is shown to lead to a generalized version\nof the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism as an effective description.\n", "  The Antartica Search for Transiting Extrasolar Planets (ASTEP), an\nautomatized 400 mm telescope located at Concordia station in Antarctica,\nmonitored beta Pictoris continuously to detect any variability linked to the\ntransit of the Hill sphere of its planet beta Pictoris b. The long observation\nsequence, from March to September 2017, combined with the quality and high\nlevel duty cycle of our data, enables us to detect and analyse the delta Scuti\npulsations of the star. Time series photometric data were obtained using\naperture photometry by telescope defocussing. The 66 418 data points were\nanalysed using the software package Period04. We only selected frequencies with\namplitudes that exceed four times the local noise level in the amplitude\nspectrum. We detect 31 delta Scuti pulsation frequencies, 28 of which are new\ndetections. All the frequencies detected are in the interval 34.76-75.68 d-1 .\nWe also find that beta Pictoris exhibits at least one pulsation mode that\nvaries in amplitude over our monitoring duration of seven months.\n", "  Bright and eclipsing, the high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 offers a unique\nopportunity to study accretion onto a neutron star from clumpy winds of O/B\nstars and to disentangle the complex accretion geometry of these systems. In\nChandra-HETGS spectroscopy at orbital phase ~0.25, when our line of sight\ntowards the source does not pass through the large-scale accretion structure\nsuch as the accretion wake, we observe changes in overall spectral shape on\ntimescales of a few kiloseconds. This spectral variability is, at least in\npart, caused by changes in overall absorption and we show that such strongly\nvariable absorption cannot be caused by unperturbed clumpy winds of O/B stars.\nWe detect line features from high and low ionization species of silicon,\nmagnesium and neon whose strengths and presence depend on the overall level of\nabsorption. They imply a co-existence of cool and hot gas phases in the system\nthat we interpret as a highly variable, structured accretion flow close to the\ncompact object such as has been recently seen in simulations of wind accretion\nin high-mass X-ray binaries.\n", "  To study exotic excitations described by parafermions in the possible spin\nliquid states of SU($n$) spin systems, we introduce a parafermion parton\napproach. The SU($n$) spin operators can be represented by clock and shift\nmatrices, which are shown to be the polynomials of parafermion operators in the\nparafermion representation. We find that SU($n$) spins can be decomposed into\n$n$ parafermion matrices of degree one. In this decomposition, the spin has a\n$\\{\\bigotimes{\\rm SU}(n)\\}^{n-1}$ gauge symmetry. As an application, we study\nthe one-dimensional three-state clock model and generalized Kitaev model by a\nmean-field theory, both of them have been proved to be related to parafermion\nexcitations. We find that with the symmetries of translations, $6$-fold\nrotation and combination of parity and time reversal, there are $9$ types and\n$102$ solutions for two-dimensional $Z_3$ parafermion spin liquids on the\nhoneycomb lattice. On the contrast, there are $9$ types and $36$ solutions if\nboth parity and time-reversal symmetries are present. Our results provide a\nnovel route for the systematic search of new types of spin liquids with exotic\nanyon excitations.\n", "  We determined the spin value of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) with investigated ultraviolet-to-optical spectral energy\ndistribution, presented in the sample of Shang et al. (2005). The estimates of\nthe spin values have been produced at the base of the standard geometrically\nthin accretion disk model and with using the results of the polarimetric\nobservations. The polarimetric observations are very important for determining\nthe inclination angle of AGN disk. We presented the results of our\ndeterminations of the radiation efficiency of the accretion flow and values of\nthe spins of SMBHs, that derives the coefficient of radiation efficiency. The\nmajority of SMBHs of AGNs from Shang et al. (2005) sample are to be the Kerr\nblack holes with the high spin value.\n", "  Pulsar magnetospheres have strong magnetic fields and large amounts of\nplasma. The structures of these magnetospheres are studied using force-free\nelectrodynamics. To understand pulsar magnetospheres, discussions must include\ntheir outer region. However, force-free electrodynamics is limited in it does\nnot handle dissipation. Therefore, a resistive pulsar magnetic field model is\nneeded. To break the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) condition $E \\cdot B = 0$,\nOhm's law is used. In this work, I introduce resistivity depending upon the\ndistance from the star and obtain a self-consistent steady state by time\nintegration. Poloidal current circuits form in the magnetosphere while the\ntoroidal magnetic-field region expands beyond the light cylinder and the\nPoynting flux radiation appears. High electric resistivity causes a large space\nscale poloidal current circuit and the magnetosphere radiates a larger Poynting\nflux than the linear increase outside of the light cylinder radius. The formed\npoloidal current circuit has width, which grows with the electric conductivity.\nThis result contributes to a more concrete dissipative pulsar magnetosphere\nmodel.\n", "  We compare element and isotopic fractionations measured in solar wind samples\ncollected by NASA's Genesis mission with those predicted from models\nincorporating both the ponderomotive force in the chromosphere and conservation\nof the first adiabatic invariant in the low corona. Generally good agreement is\nfound, suggesting that these factors are consistent with the process of solar\nwind fractionation. Based on bulk wind measurements, we also consider in more\ndetail the isotopic and elemental abundances of O. We find mild support for an\nO abundance in the range 8.75 - 8.83, with a value as low as 8.69 disfavored. A\nstronger conclusion must await solar wind regime specific measurements from the\nGenesis samples.\n", "  This paper is the first in the series of papers aiming to study interaction\nof the electro-magnetic precursor waves generated at the front of a\nrelativistic shock with the upstream flow. It is motivated by a simple\nconsideration showing that the absorption of such an electro-magnetic precursor\ncould yield an efficient transformation of the kinetic energy of the upstream\nflow to the energy of accelerated particles. Taking into account that the\nprecursor is a strong wave, in which electrons oscillate with relativistic\nvelocities, the standard plasma-radiation interaction processes should be\nreconsidered. In this paper, I calculate the synchrotron absorption of strong\nelectro-magnetic waves.\n", "  Observations of a relation between continuum intensity and magnetic field\nstrength in sunspots have been made during nearly five decades. This work\npresents full-Stokes measurements of the full-split (g = 3) line Fe I 1564.85\nnm with spatial resolution of 0.5\" obtained with the GREGOR Infrared\nSpectrograph in three large sunspots. The continuum intensity is corrected for\ninstrumental scattered light and the brightness temperature is calculated.\nMagnetic field strength and inclination are derived directly from the line\nsplit and the ratio of Stokes components. The continuum intensity (temperature)\nrelations to the field strength are studied separately in the umbra, light\nbridges, and penumbra. The results are consistent with previous studies and it\nwas found that the scatter of values in the relations increases with increasing\nspatial resolution thanks to resolved fine structures. The observed relations\nshow trends common for the umbra, light bridges, and the inner penumbra, while\nthe outer penumbra has a weaker magnetic field compared to the inner penumbra\nat equal continuum intensities. This fact can be interpreted in terms of the\ninterlocking comb magnetic structure of the penumbra. A comparison with data\nobtained from numerical simulations was made. The simulated data have a\ngenerally stronger magnetic field and a weaker continuum intensity than the\nobservations, which may be explained by stray light and limited spatial\nresolution of the observations and by photometric inaccuracies of the\nsimulations.\n", "  Using a two-band double-exchange model with Jahn-Teller lattice distortions\nand super-exchange interactions, supplemented by quenched disorder, at electron\ndensity $n=0.65$, we explicitly demonstrate the coexistence of the $n$ =\n1/2-type ($\\pi, \\pi$) charge-ordered and the ferromagnetic nanoclusters above\nthe ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ in colossal\nmagnetoresistive (CMR) manganites. The resistivity increases due to the\nenhancement of the volume fraction of the charge-ordered and the ferromagnetic\nnanoclusters with decreasing the temperature down to $T_{\\rm c}$. The\nferromagnetic nanoclusters start to grow and merge, and the volume fraction of\nthe charge-ordered nanoclusters decreases below $T_{\\rm c}$, leading to the\nsharp drop in the resistivity. By applying a small external magnetic field $h$,\nwe show that the resistivity above $T_{\\rm c}$ increases, as compared with the\ncase when $h=0$, a fact which further confirms the coexistence of the\ncharge-ordered and the ferromagnetic nanoclusters. In addition, we show that\nthe volume fraction of the charge-ordered nanoclusters decreases with\nincreasing the bandwidth and consequently the resistivity hump diminishes for\nlarge bandwidth manganites, in good qualitative agreement with experiments. The\nobtained insights from our calculations provide a complete pathway to\nunderstand the phase competition in CMR manganites.\n", "  The average stellar mass (Mstar) of high-mass galaxies (Mstar > 3e11 Msun) is\nexpected to grow by ~30% since z~1, largely through ongoing mergers that are\nalso invoked to explain the observed increase in galaxy sizes. Direct evidence\nfor the corresponding growth in stellar mass has been elusive, however, in part\nbecause the volumes sampled by previous redshift surveys have been too small to\nyield reliable statistics. In this work, we make use of the Stripe 82 Massive\nGalaxy Catalog to build a mass-limited sample of 41,770 galaxies (Mstar >\n1.6e11) with optical to near-IR photometry and a large fraction (>55%) of\nspectroscopic redshifts. Our sample spans 139 square degrees, significantly\nlarger than most previous efforts. After accounting for a number of potential\nsystematic errors, including the effects of Mstar scatter, we measure galaxy\nstellar mass functions over 0.3 < z < 0.65 and detect no growth in the typical\nMstar of massive galaxies with an uncertainty of 9%. This confidence level is\ndominated by uncertainties in the star formation history assumed for Mstar\nestimates, although our inability to characterize low surface-brightness\noutskirts may be the most important limitation of our study. Even among these\nhigh-mass galaxies, we find evidence for differential evolution when splitting\nthe sample by recent star formation (SF) activity. While low-SF systems appear\nto become completely passive, we find a mostly sub-dominant population of\ngalaxies with residual, but low rates of star formation (~1 Msun/yr) number\ndensity does not evolve. Interestingly, these galaxies become more prominent at\nhigher Mstar, representing ~10% of all galaxies at Mstar ~ 1e12 Msun and\nperhaps dominating at even larger masses.\n", "  Context. On September 2016 the first data from Gaia were released (DR1). The\nfirst release included photometry for over 10^9 sources in the very broad G\nsystem. Aims. To test the correspondence between G magnitudes in DR1 and the\nsynthetic equivalents derived using spectral energy distributions from observed\nand model spectrophotometry. To correct the G passband curve and to measure the\nzero point in the Vega system. Methods. I have computed the synthetic G and\nTycho-2 BV photometry for a sample of stars using the Next Generation Spectral\nLibrary (NGSL) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) CALSPEC spectroscopic\nstandards. Results. I have found that the nominal G passband curve is too blue\nfor the DR1 photometry, as shown by the presence of a color term in the\ncomparison between observed and synthetic magnitudes. A correction to the\npassband applying a power law in lambda with an exponent of 0.783 eliminates\nthe color term. The corrected passband has a Vega zero point of 0.070$\\pm$0.004\nmagnitudes.\n", "  We numerically study the behavior of self-propelled liquid droplets whose\nmotion is triggered by a Marangoni-like flow. This latter is generated by\nvariations of surfactant concentration which affect the droplet surface tension\npromoting its motion. In the present paper a model for droplets with a third\namphiphilic component is adopted. The dynamics is described by Navier-Stokes\nand convection-diffusion equations, solved by lattice Boltzmann method coupled\nwith finite-difference schemes. We focus on two cases. First the study of\nself-propulsion of an isolated droplet is carried on and, then, the interaction\nof two self-propelled droplets is investigated. In both cases, when the\nsurfactant migrates towards the interface, a quadrupolar vortex of the velocity\nfield forms inside the droplet and causes the motion. A weaker dipolar field\nemerges instead when the surfactant is mainly diluted in the bulk. The dynamics\nof two interacting droplets is more complex and strongly depends on their\nreciprocal distance. If, in a head-on collision, droplets are close enough, the\nvelocity field initially attracts them until a motionless steady state is\nachieved. If the droplets are vertically shifted, the hydrodynamic field leads\nto an initial reciprocal attraction followed by a scattering along opposite\ndirections. This hydrodynamic interaction acts on a separation of some droplet\nradii otherwise it becomes negligible and droplets motion is only driven by\nMarangoni effect. Finally, if one of the droplets is passive, this latter is\ngenerally advected by the fluid flow generated by the active one.\n", "  Excited states of the $N=32$ nucleus $^{54}$Ti have been studied, via both\ninverse-kinematics proton scattering and one-neutron knockout from $^{55}$Ti by\na liquid hydrogen target, using the GRETINA $\\gamma$-ray tracking array.\nInelastic proton-scattering cross sections and deformation lengths have been\ndetermined. A low-lying octupole state has been tentatively identified in\n$^{54}$Ti for the first time. A comparison of $(p,p')$ results on low-energy\noctupole states in the neutron-rich Ca and Ti isotopes with the results of\nRandom Phase Approximation calculations demonstrates that the observed\nsystematic behavior of these states is unexpected.\n", "  The influence of individual impurities of Fe on the electronic properties of\ntopological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is studied by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.\nThe microscope tip is used in order to remotely charge/discharge Fe impurities.\nThe charging process is shown to depend on the impurity location in the\ncrystallographic unit cell, on the presence of other Fe impurities in the close\nvicinity, as well as on the overall doping level of the crystal. We present a\nqualitative explanation of the observed phenomena in terms of tip-induced local\nband bending. Our observations evidence that the specific impurity neighborhood\nand the position of the Fermi energy with respect to the Dirac point and bulk\nbands have both to be taken into account when considering the electron\nscattering on the disorder in topological insulators.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) of 10 eV\nto 2.5 keV from the downwind hemisphere of the heliosphere. These ENAs are\nbelieved to originate mostly from pickup protons and solar wind protons in the\ninner heliosheath. This study includes all low-energy observations made with\nthe Interstellar Boundary Explorer over the first 8 years. Since the protons\naround 0.1 keV dominate the plasma pressure in the inner heliosheath in\ndownwind direction, these ENA observations offer the unique opportunity to\nconstrain the plasma properties and dimensions of the heliosheath where no\nin-situ observations are available.\n  We first derive energy spectra of ENA intensities averaged over time for 49\nmacropixels covering the entire downwind hemisphere. The results confirm\nprevious studies regarding integral intensities and the roll-over around 0.1\nkeV energy. With the expanded dataset we now find that ENA intensities at 0.2\nand 0.1 keV seem to anti-correlate with solar activity. We then derive the\nproduct of total plasma pressure and emission thickness of protons in the\nheliosheath to estimate lower limits on the thickness of the inner heliosheath.\nThe temporally averaged ENA intensities support a rather spherical shape of the\ntermination shock and a heliosheath thickness between 150 and 210 au for most\nregions of the downwind hemisphere. Around the nominal downwind direction of\n76{\\deg} ecliptic longitude, the heliosheath is at least 280 au thick. There,\nthe neutral hydrogen density seems to be depleted compared to upwind directions\nby roughly a factor of 2.\n", "  Studies of the most luminous quasars at high redshift directly probe the\nevolution of the most massive black holes in the early Universe and their\nconnection to massive galaxy formation. However, extremely luminous quasars at\nhigh redshift are very rare objects. Only wide area surveys have a chance to\nconstrain their population. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has so far\nprovided the most widely adopted measurements of the quasar luminosity function\n(QLF) at $z>3$. However, a careful re-examination of the SDSS quasar sample\nrevealed that the SDSS quasar selection is in fact missing a significant\nfraction of $z\\gtrsim3$ quasars at the brightest end. We have identified the\npurely optical color selection of SDSS, where quasars at these redshifts are\nstrongly contaminated by late-type dwarfs, and the spectroscopic incompleteness\nof the SDSS footprint as the main reasons. Therefore we have designed the\nExtremely Luminous Quasar Survey (ELQS), based on a novel near-infrared JKW2\ncolor cut using WISE AllWISE and 2MASS all-sky photometry, to yield high\ncompleteness for very bright ($m_{\\rm{i}} < 18.0$) quasars in the redshift\nrange of $3.0\\leq z\\leq5.0$. It effectively uses random forest machine-learning\nalgorithms on SDSS and WISE photometry for quasar-star classification and\nphotometric redshift estimation. The ELQS will spectroscopically follow-up\n$\\sim 230$ new quasar candidates in an area of $\\sim12000\\,\\rm{deg}^2$ in the\nSDSS footprint, to obtain a well-defined and complete quasars sample for an\naccurate measurement of the bright-end quasar luminosity function at $3.0\\leq\nz\\leq5.0$. In this paper we present the quasar selection algorithm and the\nquasar candidate catalog.\n", "  Here we present a Multiple Observer Probability Analysis (MOPA) for the\npurpose of clarifying topics in experimental Bell scenarios. Because Bell\nscenarios are interested in quantum effects between nonlocal measurement\ndevices, we assign an observer to each device: Alice and Bob. Given that the\nobservers are stationary and space-like separated, each observer is privy to\ndifferent information along their shared equi-temporal lines due to\npermutations in the order they observe events. Therefore, each observer is\ninclined to assign different probability distributions to the same set of\npropositions due to these informational differences. The observers are\nobligated to update their probability distributions on the basis of locally\nobserved events, and in this sense, factuality is informational locality. In\nthis framework, only local variables or detections may be factual, but nothing\nprevents an observer from inquiring or making if-then inferences on the\ncounterfactual basis of a nonlocal proposition being true. Indeed the objects\npertaining to these nonlocal counterfactual propositions may be far outside an\nobserver's light cone. The MOPA arrives at the conclusion that the CHSH\ninequality is only nonlocally violated \"counterfactually\" by each observer\nwhereas local violations of the CHSH may be factual or counterfactual. We\nbelieve the MOPA to better gel probability theory (and thus QM) with Special\nRelativity than does the standard locality conditions imposed in the Bell and\nCHSH inequalities. The no-signaling condition is reinterpreted, and perhaps\nfurther clarified, in the MOPA and statements about counterfactuality and\nobserver dependent QM are made.\n", "  Planetary systems with several planets in compact orbital configurations such\nas TRAPPIST-1 are surely affected by tidal effects. Its study provides us with\nimportant insight about its evolution. We developed a second generation of a\nN-body code based on the tidal model used in Mercury-T, re-implementing and\nimproving its functionalities using Rust as programming language (including a\nPython interface for easy use) and the WHFAST integrator. The new open source\ncode ensures memory safety, reproducibility of numerical N-body experiments, it\nimproves the spin integration compared to Mercury-T and allows to take into\naccount a new prescription for the dissipation of tidal inertial waves in the\nconvective envelope of stars. Posidonius is also suitable for binary system\nsimulations with evolving stars.\n", "  Unification of dark matter and dark energy as short- and long-range\nmanifestations of a single cosmological substance is possible in models\ndescribed by the generalized Chaplygin gas equation of state. We show it admits\nhalo-like structures and discuss their density profiles, the resulting\nspace-time geometry and the rotational velocity profiles expected in these\nmodels.\n", "  We monitored BL Lacertae frequently during 2014 - 2016 when it was generally\nin a high state. We searched for intra-day variability for 43 nights using\nquasi-simultaneous measurements in the B, V, R, and I bands (totaling 143 light\ncurves); the typical sampling interval was about eight minutes. On hour-like\ntimescales, BL Lac exhibited significant variations during 13 nights in various\noptical bands. Significant spectral variations are seen during most of these\nnights such that the optical spectrum becomes bluer when brighter. The\namplitude of variability is usually greater for longer observations but is\nlower when BL Lac is brighter. No evidence for periodicities or characteristic\nvariability time-scales in the light curves was found. The color variations are\nmildly chromatic on long timescales.\n", "  Perovskite structured materials contain myriad tunable ordered phases of\nelectronic and magnetic origin with proven technological importance and strong\npromise for a variety of energy solutions. An always-contributing influence\nbeneath these cooperative and competing interactions is the lattice, whose\nphysics may be obscured in complex perovskites by the many coupled degrees of\nfreedom which makes these systems interesting. Here we report signatures of an\napproach to a quantum phase transition very near the ground state of the\nnonmagnetic, ionic insulating, simple cubic perovskite material ScF3 and show\nthat its physical properties are strongly effected as much as 100 K above the\nputative transition. Spatial and temporal correlations in the high-symmetry\ncubic phase determined using energy- and momentum-resolved inelastic X-ray\nscattering as well as X-ray diffraction reveal that soft mode, central peak and\nthermal expansion phenomena are all strongly influenced by the transition.\n", "  We report on the properties of 11 early B stars observed with gratings on\nboard XMM-Newton and Chandra, thereby doubling the number of B stars analysed\nat high resolution. The spectra typically appear soft, with temperatures of\n0.2--0.6 keV, and moderately bright (log[L_{X}/L_{BOL}]~ -7) with lower values\nfor later type stars. In line with previous studies, we also find an absence of\ncircumstellar absorption, negligible line broadening, no line shift, and\nformation radii in the range 2 - 7 R*. From the X-ray brightnesses, we derived\nthe hot mass-loss rate for each of our targets and compared these values to\npredictions or values derived in the optical domain: in some cases, the hot\nfraction of the wind can be non-negligible. The derived X-ray abundances were\ncompared to values obtained from the optical data, with a fair agreement found\nbetween them. Finally, half of the sample presents temporal variations, either\nin the long-term, short-term, or both. In particular, HD44743 is found to be\nthe second example of an X-ray pulsator, and we detect a flare-like activity in\nthe binary HD79351, which also displays a high-energy tail and one of the\nbrightest X-ray emissions in the sample.\n", "  Probabilities of photon counts at the output of a multiport optical device\nare generalised for optical sources of arbitrary quantum states in partially\ndistinguishable optical modes. For the single-mode photon sources, the\ngenerating function for the probabilities is a linear combination of the matrix\npermanents of positive semi-definite Hermitian matrices, where each Hermitian\nmatrix is a Hadamard product of a submatrix of the multiport matrix and a\nHermitian matrix describing partial distinguishability. For the multi-mode\nsources the generating function is given by an integral of the Husimi functions\nof the sources. When each photon source outputs exactly a Fock state, the\nobtained expression reduces to the probability formula derived for partially\ndistinguishable photons, \\textit{Physical Review A \\textbf{91}, 013844 (2015)}.\nThe derived probability formula can be useful in analysing experiments with\npartially distinguishable sources and error bounds of experimental Boson\nSampling devices.\n", "  Online social networks have increasing influence on our society, they may\nplay decisive roles in politics and can be crucial for the fate of companies.\nSuch services compete with each other and some may even break down rapidly.\nUsing social network datasets we show the main factors leading to such a\ndramatic collapse. At early stage mostly the loosely bound users disappear,\nlater collective effects play the main role leading to cascading failures. We\npresent a theory based on a generalised threshold model to explain the findings\nand show how the collapse time can be estimated in advance using the dynamics\nof the churning users. Our results shed light to possible mechanisms of\ninstabilities in other competing social processes.\n", "  While the saturated magnetic energy is independent of viscosity in dynamo\nexperiments, it remains viscosity-dependent in state-of-the-art 3D direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS). Extrapolating such viscous scaling-laws to\nrealistic parameter values leads to an underestimation of the magnetic energy\nby several orders of magnitude. The origin of this discrepancy is that fully 3D\nDNS cannot reach low enough values of the magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$. To\nbypass this limitation and investigate dynamo saturation at very low $Pm$, we\nfocus on the vicinity of the dynamo threshold in a rapidly rotating flow: the\nvelocity field then depends on two spatial coordinates only, while the magnetic\nfield consists of a single Fourier mode in the third direction. We perform\nnumerical simulations of the resulting set of reduced equations for $Pm$ down\nto $2\\cdot 10^{-5}$. This parameter regime is currently out of reach to fully\n3D DNS. We show that the magnetic energy transitions from a high-$Pm$ viscous\nscaling regime to a low-$Pm$ turbulent scaling regime, the latter being\nindependent of viscosity. The transition to the turbulent saturation regime\noccurs at a low value of the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm \\simeq 10^{-3}$,\nwhich explains why it has been overlooked by numerical studies so far.\n", "  We report the discovery of a kiloparsec-scale triple supermassive black hole\nsystem at $z=0.256$: SDSS J1056+5516, discovered by our systematic search for\nbinary quasars. The system contains three strong emission-line nuclei, which\nare offset by $<250~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ and by 15-18 kpc in projected separation,\nsuggesting that the nuclei belong to the same physical structure. The system\nincludes a tidal arm feature spanning $\\sim100$ kpc in projected distance at\nthe systems' redshift, inhabiting an ongoing or recent galaxy merger. Based on\nour results, such a structure can only satisfy one of the three scenarios; a\ntriple supermasive black hole (SMBH) interacting system, a triple AGN, or a\nrecoiling SMBH. Each of these scenarios is unique for our understanding of the\nhierarchical growth of galaxies, AGN triggering, and gravitational waves.\n", "  Why time is a one-way corridor? What's the origin of the arrow of time? We\nattribute the thermodynamic arrow of time as the direction of increasing\nquantum state complexity. Inspired by the work of Nielsen, Susskind and\nMicadei, we checked this hypothesis on both a simple two qubit and a three\nqubit quantum system. The result shows that in the two qubit system, the\nthermodynamic arrow of time always points in the direction of increasing\nquantum state complexity. For the three qubit system, the heat flow pattern\namong subsystems is closely correlated with the quantum state complexity of the\nsubsystems. We propose that besides its impact on macroscopic spatial geometry,\nquantum state complexity might also generate the thermodynamic arrow of time.\n", "  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) currently hosts around 23 high mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs) of which most are Be/X-ray binaries. The LMC XMM-Newton survey\nprovided follow-up observations of previously known X-ray sources that were\nlikely HMXBs, as well as identifying new HMXB candidates. In total 19 candidate\nHMXBs were selected based on their X-ray hardness ratios. In this paper we\npresent red and blue optical spectroscopy, obtained with SALT and the SAAO\n1.9-m telescope, plus a timing analysis of the long term optical light curves\nfrom OGLE to confirm the nature of these candidates. We find that 9 of the\ncandidates are new Be/X-ray Binaries, substantially increasing the LMC Be/X-ray\nbinary population. Furthermore, we present the optical properties of these new\nsystems, both individually and as a group of all the BeXBs identified by the\nXMM-Newton survey of the LMC.\n", "  We study the potential of the LHC accelerator, and a future 33 TeV proton\ncollider, to observe the production of a light top squark pair in association\nwith the lightest Higgs boson (${\\tilde t}_1 {\\tilde t}_1 h_1$), as predicted\nby the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). We scan randomly\nabout ten million points of the NMSSM parameter space, allowing all possible\ndecays of the lightest top squark and lightest Higgs boson, with no assumptions\nabout their decay rates, except for known physical constraints such as\nperturbative bounds, Dark matter relic density consistent with recent Planck\nexperiment measurements, Higgs mass bounds on the next to lightest Higgs boson,\n$h_2$, assuming it is consistent with LHC measurements for the Standard Model\nHiggs boson, LEP bounds for the chargino mass and Z invisible width,\nexperimental bounds on B meson rare decays and some LHC experimental bounds on\nSUSY particle spectra different to the particles involved in our study. We find\nthat for low mass top-squark, the dominating decay mode is ${\\tilde t}_1\n\\rightarrow b \\tilde{\\chi}_1^{\\pm}$ with $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^{\\pm} \\rightarrow\nW^{\\pm} \\tilde{\\chi}_1^0 $. We use three bench mark points with the highest\ncross sections, which naturally fall within the compressed spectra of the top\nsquark, and make a phenomenological analysis to determine the optimal event\nselection that maximizes the signal significance over backgrounds. We focus on\nthe leptonic decays of both $W$'s and the decay of lightest Higgs boson into\nb-quarks ($h_1 \\rightarrow b \\bar b$). Our results show that the high\nluminosity LHC will have limitations to observe the studied signal and only a\nproton collider with higher energy will be able to observe the SUSY scenario\nstudied with more than three standard deviations over background.\n", "  We study a holographic dark energy model in the framework of Brans-Dicke (BD)\ntheory with taking into account the interaction between dark matter and\nholographic dark energy. We use the recent observational data sets, namely SN\nIa compressed Joint Light-Analysis(cJLA) compilation, Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAO) from BOSS DR12 and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) of\nPlanck 2015. After calculating the evolution of the equation of state as well\nas the deceleration parameters, we find that with a logarithmic form for the BD\nscalar field the phantom crossing can be achieved in the late time of cosmic\nevolution. Unlike the conventional theory of holographic dark energy in\nstandard cosmology ($\\omega_D=0$), our model results a late time accelerated\nexpansion. It is also shown that the cosmic coincidence problem may be resolved\nin the proposed model. We execute the statefinder and Om diagnostic tools and\ndemonstrate that interaction term does not play a significant role. Based on\nthe observational data sets used in this paper it seems that the best value\nwith $1\\sigma$ and $2\\sigma$ confidence interval are\n$\\Omega_m=0.268^{+0.008~+0.010}_{-0.007~-0.009}$, $\n\\alpha=3.361^{+0.332~+0.483}_{-0.401~-0.522}$,\n$\\beta=5.560^{+0.541~+0.780}_{-0.510~-0.729}$,\n$c=0.777^{+0.023~+0.029}_{-0.017~-0.023}$ and $b^2 =0.045$, according to which\nwe find that the proposed model in the presence of interaction is compatible\nwith the recent observational data.\n", "  The surprising discovery of a ring system around the Centaur 10199 Chariklo\nin 2013 led to a reanalysis of archival stellar occultation data for the\nCentaur 2060 Chiron by Ortiz et al. One possible interpretation of that data is\nthat a system of rings exists around Chiron. In this work, we study the\ndynamical history of the proposed Chiron ring system by integrating nearly\n36,000 clones of the Centaur backward in time for 100 Myr under the influence\nof the Sun and the four giant planets. The severity of all close encounters\nbetween the clones and planets while the clones are in the Centaur region is\nrecorded, along with the mean time between close encounters. We find that\nsevere and extreme close encounters are very rare, making it possible that the\nChiron ring system has remained intact since its injection into the Centaur\nregion, which we find likely occurred within the past 8.5 Myr. Our simulations\nyield a backward dynamical half-life for Chiron of 0.7 Myr. The dynamical\nclasses of a sample of clones are found. It is found that, on average, the\nCentaur lifetimes of resonance hopping clones are twice those of random-walk\nclones because of resonance sticking in mean motion resonances. In addition, we\npresent MEGNO and chaotic lifetime maps of the region bound by 13 au $\\le a\n\\le$14 au and e $\\le$0.5. We confirm that the current mean orbital parameters\nof Chiron are located in a highly chaotic region of a-e phase space.\n", "  Bogoliubov quasiparticles moving in the background of superfluid\n$\\text{He}^3$-A see an apparently curved space-time metric when the background\nsuperfluid vacuum is in motion. We study how this curvature couples with the\nspins of the effectively massless quasiparticles. First, we set up the problem\nin null Fermi coordinates for radial as well as circular geodesics and then use\nit in the context of the analog metric seen by the quasiparticles. We obtain an\neffective magnetic interaction due to curvature coupling, and provide numerical\nestimates. Some possible implications of these results are then pointed out.\n", "  In a previous work [16], a new model was introduced, taking into account the\nrole of the Fermi weak force due to neutrinos coupled to magnetohydrodynamic\nplasmas. The resulting neutrino-magnetohydrodynamics was investigated in a\nparticular geometry associated with the magnetosonic wave, where the ambient\nmagnetic field and the wavevector are perpendicular. The corresponding fast,\nshort wavelength neutrino beam instability was then obtained in the context of\nsupernova parameters. The present communication generalizes these results,\nallowing for arbitrary direction of wave propagation, including fast and slow\nmagnetohydrodynamic waves and the intermediate cases of oblique angles. The\nnumerical estimates of the neutrino-plasma instabilities are derived in extreme\nastrophysical environments where dense neutrino beams exist.\n", "  We analyze the role of collisional effects on the coupling between\nion-acoustic waves and neutrino flavor oscillations, discussing its relevance\nfor plasma instabilities in extreme plasma environments like in type II\nsupernovae, where intense neutrino bursts exist. Electrons (leptons) are\ncoupled to the electron-neutrino fluid through the weak Fermi force, but the\nelectron-neutrinos are allowed to convert to other neutrino flavors and\nvice-versa. Due to the typically slow frequency of neutrino flavor\noscillations, many orders smaller than e.g. the plasma frequency, an effective\nenergy transfer between plasma waves and neutrino flavor oscillations take\nplace at the low-frequency electrostatic branch, viz. the ion-acoustic mode. We\nshow the destabilization of ion-acoustic waves in dense astrophysical\nscenarios, with a focus on the collisional effects mediated by electron-ion\nscattering. The maximal instability growth-rate is evaluated and compared to\ncharacteristic inverse times of type II supernova explosions. The results can\nbe used for independent experimental verification of the non-zero neutrino\nmass, in a plasma physics context.\n", "  Warm Absorbers (WAs), as an important form of AGN outflows, show absorption\nin both UV and X-ray band. Using XSTAR generated photoionization models, for\nthe first time we present a joint fit to the simultaneous observations of\nHST/COS and Chandra/HETGS on NGC 3783. A total of five WAs explain well all\nabsorption features from the AGN outflows, which are spread over a wide range\nof parameters: ionization parameter log{\\xi} from 0.6 to 3.8, column density\nlog N_H from 19.5 to 22.3 cm^{-2}, velocity v from 380 to 1060 km s^{-1}, and\ncovering factor from 0.33 to 0.75. Not all the five WAs are consistent in\npressure. Two of them are likely different parts of the same absorbing gas, and\ntwo of the other WAs may be smaller discrete clouds that are blown out from the\ninner region of the torus at different periods. The five WAs suggest a total\nmass outflowing rate within the range of 0.22-4.1 solar mass per year.\n", "  Gravitational wave astronomy opened dramatically in September 2015 with the\nLIGO discovery of a distant and massive binary black hole coalescence. The more\nrecent discovery of a binary neutron star merger, followed by a gamma ray burst\nand a kilonova, reinforces the excitement of this new era, in which we may soon\nsee other sources of gravitational waves, including continuous, nearly\nmonochromatic signals. Potential continuous wave (CW) sources include rapidly\nspinning galactic neutron stars and more exotic possibilities, such as emission\nfrom axion Bose Einstein \"clouds\" surrounding black holes. Recent searches in\nAdvanced LIGO data are presented, and prospects for more sensitive future\nsearches discussed.\n", "  He atom scattering has been shown to be a sensitive probe of electron-phonon\ninteraction properties at surfaces. Here it is shown that measurements of the\nthermal attenuation of the specular He atom diffraction peak (the Debye-Waller\neffect) can determine the electron-phonon coupling constant $\\lambda$ for\nultrathin films of metal overlayers on various close-packed metal substrates.\nValues of $\\lambda$ obtained for single and multiple monolayers of alkali\nmetals, and for Pb layers on Cu(111), extrapolated to large thicknesses, agree\nfavorably with known bulk values. This demonstrates that He atom scattering can\nmeasure the electron-phonon coupling strength as a function of film thickness\non a layer-by-layer basis.\n", "  In this thesis, we have studied the generation and evolution of the magnetic\nfield in the early Universe. We investigated the generation of magnetic fields\nin the presence of chiral symmetry and gravitational anomaly. We have used\nmodified kinetic theory by Berry curvature and derived expressions for magnetic\nand vortical conductivities. We have also shown that there are two length\nscales: kinetic and viscous, which is one of the important results. In the\nlatter part of the thesis, we have shown the effect of second-order viscous\neffects on the modes of the magnetic fields.\n", "  This thesis investigates algorithms regarding their applicability for highly\nnonlinear model fitting on big datasets. Various mathematical methods are\npresented with which a model fit using the least squares criterion is possible.\nSpecial requirements regarding the processing of large data sets as a basis for\nsuch a model fit are discussed.\n  The specific example of the search for gravitational wave signals in\nsimulated data of the ESA satellite mission Gaia is used to demonstrate how a\nmodel fit is possible, even with complex models and large amount of data. For\nthis purpose, a highly parallel prototype of a future search software is\nimplemented. The resulting prototype uses a hybrid algorithm which utilizes a\nlinear search, an evolutionary algorithm and a classical iterative Gauss-Newton\nfit. The performance and behavior of its components are investigated in detail.\n  With the help of software presented in this work it has been possible for the\nfirst time to detect gravitational wave signals in simulated astrometric data,\nand to determine their parameters. Furthermore, it can be concluded from the\nruntime behavior of the software that such a search is also possible in real\ndata of the Gaia mission.\n", "  Spectroscopy is the most fundamental instruments in almost every field of\nmodern science. Conventional spectrometer is based on the dispersion elements\nsuch as various gratings. An alternative way is based on the filters such as\ninterference filters, plasmonic nanoresonators, or quantum dots. However, for\nany of the above two spectrometers, the high-precision grating or the\nabsorption filter should be elaborately designed and makes it expensive. Here,\nwe propose a third spectrometer principle-pupil diffraction spectrometer (PDS).\nSince the high-precision grating and the elaborately designed absorption filter\nare abandoned, the whole structure of the PDS is just as simple as a CCD\ndetector. Thus, compared with the above two spectrometer, the structure of the\nspectrometer is greatly simplified and the cost of the spectrometer is sharply\nreduced. In addition, the PDS can ensure the spectral range and resolution\nsimultaneously due to the reconstruction its reconstruction algorithm. A series\nof simulation results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the PDS\nprinciple. Further, the effectiveness of the PDS principle in the noisy\ncondition is also tested. Owing to this merits small size, light weight, and\nlow cost, we expect the inventions of PDS has great application potential such\nas putting on the satellite to perform space exploration, and integrates to the\nsmartphone to realize the detection pesticide residue in the food and clinical\ndiagnose of the disease.\n", "  Logical and information aspects of friction and wetting (including the\nadhesion, capillarity, and superhydrophobicity) are discussed. Friction\ninvolves paradoxes, such as the Painlev\\'e paradoxes of non-existence or\nnon-uniqueness of solutions in mechanical systems of rigid bodies with dry\nfriction. These paradoxes can be treated by introducing ternary logic with the\nthree basic states: rest-motion-undefined. When elastic deformation is\nintroduced, the paradoxical solutions correspond to frictional instabilities\nleading to rest-motion-unstable as three states of a system. The dynamic\nevolution of a frictional interface towards a limit cycle can be viewed as a\nprocess of erasing the information about the interface due to the\ninstabilities. Furthermore, while friction force is universal, it is not\ntreated as a fundamental force and can be considered as an epiphenomenon of\nvarious synergetic mechanisms. This further relates friction to other surface\neffects, including the capillarity, with its binary logic of wetting states and\na possibility of droplet computation for lab-on-a-chip microfluidic reactors.\nWe discuss the logical foundation of biomimetic superhydrophobic surface design\nand how it is different from the conventional design. Both friction and wetting\ncan be used for novel unconventional logical and computational devices.\n", "  In the hierarchical paradigm of structure formation, galaxy clusters are the\nlargest objects ever to virialize. They are thought to grow by accreting mass\nthrough large scale, strong virial shocks. Such a collisionless shock is\nexpected to accelerate relativistic electrons, thus generating a spectrally\nflat leptonic virial ring. However attempts to detect virial rings have all\nfailed, leaving the shock paradigm unconfirmed. Here we identify a virial\n$\\gamma$-ray signal by stacking Fermi-LAT data for 112 clusters, enhancing the\nring sensitivity by rescaling clusters to their virial radii and utilizing the\nanticipated spectrum. In addition to a central unresolved, hard signal\n(detected at the nominal $5.8\\sigma$ confidence level), probably dominated by\nactive galactic nuclei, we identify ($5.9\\sigma$) a bright, spectrally flat\n$\\gamma$-ray ring at the expected shock position. It corresponds to $\\sim\n0.6\\%$ (with an uncertainty factor $\\sim2$) thermal energy deposition in\nrelativistic electrons over a Hubble time. This result validates the shock\nparadigm, calibrates its parameters, and indicates that the cumulative emission\nfrom such shocks significantly contributes to the diffuse extragalactic\n$\\gamma$-ray and radio backgrounds.\n", "  We discuss universal signals of consistent models of pseudoscalar mediators\nfor collider searches for Dark Matter. Keeping only the degrees of freedom that\ncan not be decoupled due to consistency conditions, we present a universality\nclass of simplified models with pseudoscalar mediators and renormalizable\ncouplings to Standard Model fields. We compute stability and perturbativity\nconstraints, constraints from electroweak precision measurements, collider\nsearches for new heavy particles as well as constraints from relic density\nmeasurements and indirect detection experiments searching for signals of Dark\nMatter annihilation into photons. We find that the mono-$Z$ final state is the\nstrongest, universal signal of this class of models, with additional signatures\npresent in the different ultraviolet completions that can be used to\ndistinguish between them.\n", "  The rate of major galaxy-galaxy merging is theoretically predicted to\nsteadily increase with redshift during the peak epoch of massive galaxy\ndevelopment ($1{\\leq}z{\\leq}3$). We use close-pair statistics to objectively\nstudy the incidence of massive galaxies (stellar\n$M_{1}{\\geq}2{\\times}10^{10}M_{\\odot}$) hosting major companions\n($1{\\leq}M_{1}/M_{2}{\\leq}4$; i.e., $<$4:1) at six epochs spanning $0{<}z{<}3$.\nWe select companions from a nearly complete, mass-limited\n($\\geq5{\\times}10^{9}M_{\\odot}$) sample of 23,696 galaxies in the five CANDELS\nfields and the SDSS. Using $5-50$ kpc projected separation and close redshift\nproximity criteria, we find that the major companion fraction\n$f_{\\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ based on stellar mass-ratio (MR) selection increases from\n6% ($z{\\sim}0$) to 16% ($z{\\sim}0.8$), then turns over at $z{\\sim}1$ and\ndecreases to 7% ($z{\\sim}3$). Instead, if we use a major F160W flux ratio (FR)\nselection, we find that $f_{\\mathrm{mc}}(z)$ increases steadily until $z=3$\nowing to increasing contamination from minor (MR$>$4:1) companions at $z>1$. We\nshow that these evolutionary trends are statistically robust to changes in\ncompanion proximity. We find disagreements between published results are\nresolved when selection criteria are closely matched. If we compute merger\nrates using constant fraction-to-rate conversion factors\n($C_{\\mathrm{merg,pair}}{=}0.6$ and\n$T_{\\mathrm{obs,pair}}{=}0.65\\mathrm{Gyr}$), we find that MR rates disagree\nwith theoretical predictions at $z{>}1.5$. Instead, if we use an evolving\n$T_{\\mathrm{obs,pair}}(z){\\propto}(1+z)^{-2}$ from Snyder et al., our MR-based\nrates agree with theory at $0{<}z{<}3$. Our analysis underscores the need for\ndetailed calibration of $C_{\\mathrm{merg,pair}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{obs,pair}}$ as\na function of redshift, mass and companion selection criteria to better\nconstrain the empirical major merger history.\n", "  We study the solar photospheric abundance of singly ionized neodymium (Nd II)\nusing high resolution spectroscopic data obtained by Fourier transform\nspectrograph (FTS). Based on the Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (LTE)\nassumption, a new value of Nd abundance is derived. We succeed to select of 51\nsolar Nd II lines with accurate transition probabilities measured\nexperimentally by Den Hartog et al. (2003) and with accurate damping parameters\nare determined from literature. Relying on atomic data of Opacity Distribution\nFunction (ODF), we construct theoretical photospheric solar model. The mean\nsolar photospheric abundance obtained from all 51 Nd II lines is log\n{\\epsilon}Nd=1.45 +- 0.08, which is mostly similar to the meteoric value.\n", "  Two recent short term dimmings of KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's Star) exhibit clear\nreddening in the B, r' and i' photometric passbands. We show that the intensity\nratios of the three pass bands agree well with cooling of an approximately 6800\nK black body by about 30K. This agreement, together with other recent findings\non the timing and longer term dimmings of this star, support our previous\nargument that the star's photometric behavior is caused by internal storage of\nimpeded convective flux, rather than by external sources of obscuration such\nthe ISM or circumstellar material.\n", "  The angle between the spin of a star and its planets' orbital planes traces\nthe history of the planetary system. Exoplanets orbiting close to cool stars\nare expected to be on circular, aligned orbits because of strong tidal\ninteractions with the stellar convective envelope. Spin-orbit alignment can be\nmeasured when the planet transits its star, but such ground-based spectroscopic\nmeasurements are challenging for cool, slowly-rotating stars. Here we report\nthe characterization of a planet three-dimensional trajectory around an M dwarf\nstar, derived by mapping the spectrum of the stellar photosphere along the\nchord transited by the planet. We find that the eccentric orbit of the\nNeptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b is nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator.\nBoth eccentricity and misalignment, surprising around a cool star, can result\nfrom dynamical interactions (via Kozai migration) with a yet-undetected outer\ncompanion. This inward migration of GJ 436b could have triggered the\natmospheric escape that now sustains its giant exosphere. Eccentric, misaligned\nexoplanets orbiting close to cool stars might thus hint at the presence of\nunseen perturbers and illustrate the diversity of orbital architectures seen in\nexoplanetary systems.\n", "  We have previously argued that targeted interstellar communication has a\nphysical optimum at narrowband X-ray wavelengths $\\lambda\\approx1\\,$nm, limited\nby the surface roughness of focusing devices at the atomic level\n(arXiv:1711.05761). We search 24,247 archival X-ray spectra (of 6,454 unique\nobjects) for such features and present 19 sources with monochromatic signals.\nClose examination reveals that these are most likely of natural origin. The\nratio of artificial to natural sources must be <0.01%. This first limit can be\nimproved in future X-ray surveys.\n", "  Up to now searches for Dark Matter (DM) detection have not been successful,\neither because our paradigm in how DM signals should look like are wrong or the\ndetector sensitivity is still too low in spite of the large progress made in\nrecent years. We discuss both possibilities starting with what we know about DM\nfrom cosmology and why Supersymmetry provides such an interesting paradigm for\ncosmology and particle physics in order to appreciate what it means to give up\nthis paradigm. In addition, we compare the predicted cross sections for direct\nand indirect DM detection with observations with emphasis on the latest\ndevelopments. Especially, we discuss the possible origins of the two hotly\ndebated candidates for a DM annihilation signal, namely the positron excess and\nthe Fermi GeV excess, which are unfortunately incompatible with each other and\nmore mundane astrophysical explanations exist.\n", "  Modeling nuclear quantum effects is required for accurate molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations of molecules. The community has paid special attention to\nwater and other biomolecules that show hydrogen bonding. Standard methods of\nmodeling nuclear quantum effects like Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD)\nare computationally costlier than running classical trajectories. A force-field\nfunctor (FFF) is an alternative method that computes an effective force field\nwhich replicates quantum properties of the original force field. In this work,\nwe propose an efficient method of computing FFF using the Wigner-Kirkwood\nexpansion. As a test case, we calculate a range of thermodynamic properties of\nNeon, obtaining the same level of accuracy as RPMD, but with the shorter\nruntime of classical simulations. By modifying existing MD programs, the\nproposed method could be used in the future to increase the efficiency and\naccuracy of MD simulations involving water and proteins.\n", "  We present low resolution, visible light spectra of 41 star clusters in the\nspiral galaxy M101, taken with the Gemini/GMOS instrument. We measure Lick\nindices for each cluster and compare with BaSTI models to estimate their ages\nand metallicities. We also measure the line-of-sight velocities. We find that\n25 of the clusters are fairly young massive clusters (YMCs) with ages of\nhundreds of Myr, and 16 appear to be older, globular clusters (GCs). There are\nat least four GCs with best fit ages of approximately 1-3 Gyr and eight with\nbest fit ages of approximately 5-10 Gyr. The mean metallicity of the YMCs is\n[Fe/H] of approximately -0.1 and for the GCs is [Fe/H] of approximately -0.9.\nWe find a near-continuous spread in both age and metallicity for our sample,\nwhich may indicate that M101 had a more-or-less continuous history of cluster\nand star formation. From the kinematics, we find that the YMCs rotate with the\nHI gas fairly well, while the GCs do not. We cannot definitively say whether\nthe GCs sampled here lie in an inner halo, thick disk, or bulge/psuedobulge\ncomponent, although given the very small bulge in M101, the last seems\nunlikely. The kinematics and ages of the YMCs suggest that M101 may have\nundergone heating of its disk or possibly a continuous merger/accretion history\nfor the galaxy.\n", "  Surface recombination affects both light-to-electricity and\nelectricity-to-light conversion in solar cells (SCs). Therefore, quantitative\nanalysis and reduction of surface recombination is an important direction in SC\nresearch. In this work, electroluminescence (EL) intensity and photoconversion\nefficiency of a set of 93 large-area (239\\,cm$^2$) a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction\nSCs (HJSCs) are measured under AM1.5 conditions at 298 K. The HJSC samples\ndiffered only in surface recombination velocity, $S$, but otherwise were\nidentical. Variation in $S$ was due to the variation of the chemical conditions\nunder which the samples were treated. It is established that EL quantum\nefficiency, is affected by $S$ much more strongly than photoconversion\nefficiency, $\\eta$: namely, the reduction of the latter from 20.5\\% to 18\\% due\nto an increase of $S$ is accompanied by a decrease of the former by more than\nan order of magnitude. In HJSCs with well passivated surfaces, i.e. low $S$, EL\nefficiency reached 2.1\\%, which is notably higher than the known values in\nsilicon homojunction diodes. For temperature-dependent measurements of EL and\ndark I-V curves, one of the samples was cut into small-area (1 cm$^2$) pieces.\nIt was found that EL intensity as a function of temperature develops a maximum\nat $T$ = 223 K. At low temperatures, the current at weak bias is shown to be\ndue to tunneling mechanism. A theoretical model is developed that explains all\nthese findings quantitatively.\n", "  The hybrid Tibet AS array was successfully constructed in 2014. It has 4500\nm$^{2}$ underground water Cherenkov pools used as the muon detector (MD) and\n789 scintillator detectors covering 36900 m$^{2}$ as the surface array. At 100\nTeV, cosmic-ray background events can be rejected by approximately 99.99\\%,\naccording to the full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for $\\gamma$-ray\nobservations. In order to use the muon detector efficiently, we propose to\nextend the surface array area to 72900 m$^{2}$ by adding 120 scintillator\ndetectors around the current array to increase the effective detection area. A\nnew prototype scintillator detector is developed via optimizing the detector\ngeometry and its optical surface, by selecting the reflective material and\nadopting dynode readout. This detector can meet our physics requirements with a\npositional non-uniformity of the output charge within 10\\% (with reference to\nthe center of the scintillator), time resolution FWHM of $\\sim$2.2 ns, and\ndynamic range from 1 to 500 minimum ionization particles.\n", "  We report on the energy level alignment evolution of valence and conduction\nbands of armchair-oriented graphene nanoribbons (aGNR) as their band gap\nshrinks with increasing width. We use 4,4-dibromo-para-terphenyl as molecular\nprecursor on Au(111) to form extended poly-para-phenylene nanowires, which can\nbe fused sideways to form atomically precise aGNRs of varying widths. We\nmeasure the frontier bands by means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy,\ncorroborating that the nanoribbons band gap is inversely proportional to their\nwidth. Interestingly, valence bands are found to show Fermi level pinning as\nthe band gap decreases below a threshold value around 1.7 eV. Such behavior is\nof critical importance to understand the properties of potential contacts in\ngraphene nanoribbon-based devices. Our measurements further reveal a\nparticularly interesting system for studying Fermi level pinning by modifying\nan adsorbates band gap while maintaining an almost unchanged interface\nchemistry defined by substrate and adsorbate.\n", "  In this thesis we will address three different phenomena related to neutrino\nphysics: mass models, detection of the cosmic neutrino background and the\nneutrino background in Dark Matter searches, considering the different\ncharacteristics in each case. In the study of neutrino mass models, we will\nconsider models for both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos; specifically, we will\nprobe the neutrinophilic two-Higgs-doublet model. Regarding the detection of\nrelic neutrinos, we will analyse the consequences of the existence of physics\nbeyond the Standard Model in the capture rate by tritium. Finally, we will\nscrutinize the impact of neutrinos in Direct Detection searches of Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMP) including Standard Model plus additional\ninteractions in the form of simplified models.\n", "  We present atomistic simulations of conductive bridging random access memory\n(CBRAM) cells from first-principles combining density-functional theory and the\nNon-equilibrium Green's Function formalism. Realistic device structures with an\natomic-scale filament connecting two metallic contacts have been constructed.\nTheir transport properties have been studied in the ballistic limit and in the\npresence of electron-phonon scattering, showing good agreement with\nexperimental data. It has been found that the relocation of few atoms is\nsufficient to change the resistance of the CBRAM by 6 orders of magnitude, that\nthe electron trajectories strongly depend on the filament morphology, and that\nself-heating does not affect the device performance at currents below 1 $\\mu$A.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of the N\\'eel skyrmion size and stability on\nperpendicular magnetic field in ultrathin circular magnetic dots with\nout-of-plane anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange\ninteraction. Our results show the existence of two distinct dependencies of the\nskyrmion radius on the applied field and dot size. In the case of skyrmions\nstable at zero field, their radius strongly increases with the field applied\nparallel to the skyrmion core until skyrmion reaches the metastability region\nand this dependence slows down. More common metastable skyrmions demonstrate a\nweaker increase of their size as a function of the field until some critical\nfield value at which these skyrmions drastically increase in size showing a\nhysteretic behavior with coexistence of small and large radius skyrmions and\nsmall energy barriers between them. The first case is also characterized by a\nstrong dependence of the skyrmion radius on the dot diameter, while in the\nsecond case this dependence is very weak.\n", "  We review recent advances towards the realization of quantum networks based\non atom-like solid-state quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic devices.\nSpecifically, we focus on experiments involving the negatively charged\nsilicon-vacancy color center in diamond. These emitters combine homogeneous,\ncoherent optical transitions and a long-lived electronic spin quantum memory.\nWe discuss optical and spin properties of this system at cryogenic temperatures\nand describe experiments where silicon-vacancy centers are coupled to\nnanophotonic devices. Finally, we discuss experiments demonstrating quantum\nnonlinearities at the single-photon level and two-emitter entanglement in a\nsingle nanophotonic device.\n", "  The $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in the quantum dimer model on the\nKagom\\'e-lattice is a candidate for the description of the low-energy physics\nof the anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the same lattice. We study the\nextend of the topological phase by interpolating between the exactly solvable\nparent Hamiltonian of the topological phase and an effective low-energy\ndescription of the Heisenberg model in terms of a quantum-dimer Hamiltonian.\nTherefore, we perform a perturbative treatment of the low-energy excitations in\nthe topological phase including free and interacting quasi-particles. We find a\nphase transition out of the topological phase far from the Heisenberg point.\nThe resulting phase is characterized by a spontaneously broken rotational\nsymmetry and a unit cell involving six sites.\n", "  In this work we study the the sensitivity of the T2HKK experiment to probe\nnon-standard interaction in neutrino propagation. As this experiment will be\nstatistically dominated due to its large detector volume and high beam-power,\nit is expected that the sensitivity will be affected by systematics. This\nmotivates us to study the effect of systematics in probing the non-standard\ninteraction. We also compare our results with the other future proposed\nexperiments i.e., T2HK, HK and DUNE.\n", "  The topology of Weyl semimetals requires the existence of unique surface\nstates. Surface states have been visualized in spectroscopy measurements, but\ntheir connection to the topological character of the material remains largely\nunexplored. 1T'-MoTe2, presents a unique opportunity to study this connection.\nThis material undergoes a phase transition at 240K that changes the structure\nfrom orthorhombic (putative Weyl semimetal) to monoclinic (trivial metal),\nwhile largely maintaining its bulk electronic structure. Here we show from\ntemperature-dependent quasiparticle interference measurements that this\nstructural transition also acts as a topological switch for surface states in\n1T'-MoTe2. At low temperature, we observe strong quasiparticle scattering,\nconsistent with theoretical predictions and photoemission measurements for the\nsurface states in this material. In contrast, measurements performed at room\ntemperature show the complete absence of the scattering wavevectors associated\nwith the trivial surface states. These distinct quasiparticle scattering\nbehaviors show that 1T'-MoTe2 is ideal for separating topological and trivial\nelectronic phenomena via temperature dependent measurements.\n", "  The first hint of neutrino mass hierarchy is expected to come from the\nNO$\\nu$A experiment in Fermilab as the present best-fit parameter space i.e.,\nnormal hierarchy and $\\delta_{CP}=-90^\\circ$ is the favourable parameter space\nfor NO$\\nu$A where there is no degeneracy. But this situation may change if the\nstandard three flavour framework is not complete and there is existence of new\nphysics. In this work we consider the presence of an extra light sterile\nneutrino at the eV scale and study the new degeneracies which are absent in the\nstandard three flavour framework. We also study the effect of these new\ndegeneracies on the hierarchy measurement of NO$\\nu$A.\n", "  We have synthesized a new layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6. From\nsynchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement, the crystal structure of\nLa2O2Bi3AgS6 was refined using a model of the P4/nmm space group with a =\n4.0644(1) {\\AA} and c = 19.412(1) {\\AA}, which is similar to the related\ncompound LaOBiPbS3, while the interlayer bonds (M2-S1 bonds) are apparently\nshorter in La2O2Bi3AgS6. The tunneling electron microscopy (TEM) image\nconfirmed the lattice constant derived from Rietveld refinement (c ~ 20 {\\AA}).\nThe electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient suggested that the\nelectronic states of La2O2Bi3AgS6 are more metallic than those of LaOBiS2 and\nLaOBiPbS3. The insertion of a rock-salt-type chalcogenide into the van der\nWaals gap of BiS2-based layered compounds, such as LaOBiS2, will be a useful\nstrategy for designing new layered functional materials in the layered\nchalcogenide family.\n", "  Interface charge transfer and electron-phonon coupling have been suggested to\nplay a crucial role in the recently discovered high-temperature\nsuperconductivity of single unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO3. However, their\norigin remains elusive. Here, using ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy\n(UPS) and element-sensitive X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), we identify\nthe strengthened Ti-O bond that contributes to the interface enhanced\nelectron-phonon coupling and unveil the band bending at the FeSe/SrTiO3\ninterface that leads to the charge transfer from SrTiO3 to FeSe films. We also\nobserve band renormalization that accompanies the onset of superconductivity.\nOur results not only provide valuable insights into the mechanism of the\ninterface-enhanced superconductivity, but also point out a promising route\ntowards designing novel superconductors in heterostructures with band-bending\ninduced charge transfer and interfacial enhanced electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  We consider magnetic fields on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ which are parallel to a\nconformal Killing field. When the latter generates a simple rotation we show\nthat a Weyl-Dirac operator with such a magnetic field cannot have a zero mode.\nIn particular this allows us to expand the class of non zero mode producing\nmagnetic fields to include examples of non-trivial smooth compactly supported\nfields.\n", "  In the paper, the EPR paradox is explored by the approach of quantum\nsupervaluationism that leads to a \"gappy\" semantics with the propositions\ngiving rise to truth-value gaps. Within this approach, the statement, which\nasserts that in the singlet state the system of two (i.e., A and B) spin-1/2\nparticles possesses the a priori property \"spin A is up and spin B is down\nalong the same axis\" or \"spin A is down and spin B is up along the same axis\",\ndoes not have the truth-value at all. Consequently, after the verification of,\nsay, the proposition \"spin A is up along the z-axis\", the statistical\npopulation describing the valuation of the logical connective \"spin B is down\nalong the z-axis and spin B is up (down) along the x-axis\" would have no\nelements.\n", "  Time-series photometry taken from ground-based facilities is improved with\nthe use of comparison stars due to the short timescales of atmospheric-induced\nvariability. However, the sky is bright in the thermal infrared (3-5 um), and\nthe correspondingly small fields-of-view of available detectors make it highly\nunusual to have a calibration star in the same field as a science target. Here\nwe present a new method of obtaining differential photometry by simultaneously\nimaging a science target and a calibrator star, separated by <2 amin, onto a\n10x10 asec field-of-view detector. We do this by taking advantage of the LBT's\nunique binocular design to point the two co-mounted telescopes apart and\nsimultaneously obtain both targets in three sets of observations. Results\nindicate that the achievable scatter in Ls-band (3.3 um) is at the percent\nlevel for bright targets, and possibly better with heavier sampling and\ncharacterization of the systematics.\n", "  Recent years have seen the rapid discovery of solids whose low-energy\nelectrons have a massless, linear dispersion, such as Weyl, line-node, and\nDirac semimetals. The remarkable optical properties predicted in these\nmaterials show their versatile potential for optoelectronic uses. However,\nlittle is known of their response in the picoseconds after absorbing a photon.\nHere we measure the ultrafast dynamics of four materials that share non-trivial\nband structure topology but that differ chemically, structurally, and in their\nlow-energy band structures: ZrSiS, which hosts a Dirac line node and Dirac\npoints; TaAs and NbP, which are Weyl semimetals; and\nSr$_{1-y}$Mn$_{1-z}$Sb$_2$, in which Dirac fermions coexist with broken\ntime-reversal symmetry. After photoexcitation by a short pulse, all four relax\nin two stages, first sub-picosecond, and then few-picosecond. Their rapid\nrelaxation suggests that these and related materials may be suited for optical\nswitches and fast infrared detectors. The complex change of refractive index\nshows that photoexcited carrier populations persist for a few picoseconds.\n", "  The Sun emits radiation at several wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum. In the optical band, the solar radius is 695,700 km and this is what\ndefines the photosphere, the visible surface of the Sun. However, as the\naltitude increases, the electromagnetic radiation is produced at other\nfrequencies, causing the solar radius to change as function of wavelength.\nThese measurements enable a better understanding of the solar atmosphere and\nthe radius dependence on the solar cycle is a good indicator of the changes\nthat occur in the atmospheric structure. We measure the solar radius at the\nsubterahertz frequencies of 0.212 and 0.405 THz -- i.e., the altitude where\nthese emissions are primarily generated -- and also analyse the radius\nvariation over the 11-year solar activity cycle. For this, we used radio maps\nof the solar disk for the period between 1999 and 2017, reconstructed from\ndaily scans made by the Solar Submillimeter-wave Telescope (SST), installed at\nEl Leoncito Astronomical Complex (CASLEO) in the Argentinean Andes. Our\nmeasurements yield radii of 966.5\" $\\pm$ 2.8\" for 0.2 THz and 966.5\" $\\pm$ 2.7\"\nfor 0.4 THz. This implies a height of $(5.0 \\pm 2.0 \\times 10^6)$ m above the\nphotosphere. Furthermore, we also observed strong anti-correlation between the\nradius variation and the solar activity at both frequencies.\n", "  In this talk, we will discuss phenomenology of new physics associated with\nneutrinos, in particular, non-standard neutrino interactions, non-unitarity of\nthe lepton mixing matrix, and secret neutrino interactions mediated by a light\nfield.\n", "  We propose a Partial Lorentz Transformation (PLT) test for detecting\nentanglement in a two qubit system. One can expand the density matrix of a two\nqubit system in terms of a tensor product of $(\\mathbb{I}, \\vec{\\sigma})$. The\nmatrix $A$ of the coefficients that appears in such an expansion can be\n\"squared\" to form a $4\\times4$ matrix $B$. It can be shown that the eigenvalues\n$\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$ of $B$ are positive. With the\nchoice of $\\lambda_0$ as the dominant eigenvalue, the separable states satisfy\n$\\sqrt{\\lambda_1}+\\sqrt{\\lambda_2}+\\sqrt{\\lambda_3}\\leq \\sqrt{\\lambda_0}$.\nViolation of this inequality is a test of entanglement. Thus, this condition is\nboth necessary and sufficient and serves as an alternative to the celebrated\nPositive Partial Transpose (PPT) test for entanglement detection. We illustrate\nthis test by considering some explicit examples.\n", "  Fermi has detected over 200 pulsars above 100 MeV. In a previous work, using\n3 years of LAT data (1FHL catalog) we reported that 28 of these pulsars show\nemission above 10 GeV; only three of these, however, were millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs). The recently-released Third Catalog of Hard Fermi-LAT Sources (3FHL)\ncontains over 1500 sources showing emission above 10 GeV, 17 of which are\nassociated with gamma-ray MSPs. Using three times as much data as in our\nprevious study (1FHL), we report on a systematic analysis of these pulsars to\ndetermine the highest energy (pulsed) emission fromMSPs and discuss the best\npossible candidates for follow-up observations with ground-based TeV\ninstruments (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS, and the upcoming CTA).\n", "  Based on weak measurement technology, we propose the first three-observer\ndimension witness protocol in a prepare-and-measure setup. By applying the\ndimension witness inequality based on the quantum random access code and the\nnonlinear determinant value, we demonstrate that double classical dimension\nwitness violation is achievable if we choose appropriate weak measurement\nparameters. Analysis of the results will shed new light on the interplay\nbetween the multi-observer quantum dimension witness and the weak measurement\ntechnology, which can also be applied in the generation of\nsemi-device-independent quantum random numbers and quantum key distribution\nprotocols.\n", "  The plasma membrane of living cells is compartmentalized at multiple spatial\nscales ranging from the nano- to the meso-scale. This non-random organization\nis crucial for a large number of cellular functions. At the nanoscale, cell\nmembranes organize into dynamic nano-assemblies enriched by cholesterol,\nsphingolipids and certain types of proteins. Investigating these\nnano-assemblies known as lipid rafts is of paramount interest in fundamental\ncell biology. However, this goal requires simultaneous nanometer spatial\nprecision and microsecond temporal resolution which is beyond the reach of\ncommon microscopes. Optical antennas based on metallic nanostructures\nefficiently enhance and confine light into nanometer dimensions, breaching the\ndiffraction limit of light. In this Perspective, we discuss recent progress\ncombining optical antennas with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to\nmonitor microsecond dynamics at nanoscale spatial dimensions. These new\ndevelopments offer numerous opportunities to investigate lipid and protein\ndynamics in both mimetic and native biological membranes.\n", "  Based on thermodynamic considerations we derive a set of equations relating\nthe seepage velocities of the fluid components in immiscible and incompressible\ntwo-phase flow in porous media. They necessitate the introduction of a new\nvelocity function, the co-moving velocity. This velocity function is a\ncharacteristic of the porous medium. Together with a constitutive relation\nbetween the velocities and the driving forces, such as the pressure gradient,\nthese equations form a closed set. We solve four versions of the capillary tube\nmodel analytically using this theory. We test the theory numerically on a\nnetwork model.\n", "  Correlated color temperature (CCT) is a semi-quantitative system that roughly\ndescribes the spectra of lamps. This parameter gives the temperature (measured\nin kelvins) of the black body that would show the hue more similar to that of\nthe light emitted by the lamp. Modern lamps for indoor and outdoor lighting\ndisplay many spectral energy distributions, most of them extremely different to\nthose of black bodies, what makes CCT to be far from a perfect descriptor from\nthe physical point of view. The spectral index system presented in this work\nprovides an accurate, objective, quantitative procedure to characterize the\nspectral properties of lamps, with just a few numbers. The system is an\nadaptation to lighting technology of the classical procedures of multi-band\nastronomical photometry with wide and intermediate-band filters. We describe\nthe basic concepts and we apply the system to a representative set of lamps of\nmany kinds. The results lead to interesting, sometimes surprising conclusions.\nThe spectral index system is extremely easy to implement from the spectral data\nthat are routinely measured at laboratories. Thus, including this kind of\ncomputations in the standard protocols for the certification of lamps will be\nreally straightforward, and will enrich the technical description of lighting\ndevices.\n", "  Immiscible fluids flowing at high capillary numbers in porous media may be\ncharacterized by an effective viscosity. We demonstrate that the effective\nviscosity is well described by the Lichtenecker-Rother equation. The exponent\n$\\alpha$ in this equation takes either the value 1 or 0.6 in two- and 0.5 in\nthree-dimensional systems depending on the pore geometry. Our arguments are\nbased on analytical and numerical methods.\n", "  We analyze spectropolarimetric observations of the chromospheric Ca II 8542\nline taken by the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn\nSolar Telescope and photospheric Fe I 6302 lines obtained with the Solar\nOptical Telescope (SOT) of Spectro-polarimeter (SP) on board the Hinode\nsatellite. The data were obtained on 2012 January 29 targeting NOAA active\nregion (AR) 11408 and AR 11410. By using the center-of-gravity (COG) method we\ncompute the line-of-sight (LOS) field strength for observed lines of Fe I\n6301.5/6302.5 with SP spacecraft at every places in the active region. Also, we\nconstruct a COG map for the chromospheric IBIS data of Ca II 8542 line in\ncomparison with COG maps derived from the SP of field strength. We found the\nphotospheric field strength ranges up to 2 kG in plages and up to 2 kG or\nhigher values inside the umbral region. In the case of chromospheric field\nstrength, the LOS field inside the umbral region increases up to 800 G, and the\nfield strength decreases toward the edges of sunspot.\n", "  We analyze spectropolarimetric observations of the chromospheric Ca II 8542 A\nline taken by the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn\nSolar Telescope. The data were observed on 2012 January 29 for the NOAA active\nregion 11408. Adopting the center-of-gravity (COG) approach we obtain the\nline-of-sight (LOS) field strength for the chromospheric IBIS data of Ca II\n8542 A line. The LOS strength of the magnetic field is determined in the target\nactive region inside a field of view 45 x 95 arcsec. The LOS field values were\nfound to be increase up to 800 G inside the umbral region and decrease\nsystematically toward the edges of a sunspot. Under the weak field\napproximation (WFA), the horizontal, vertical magnetic field components and\nazimuthal field vector are obtained.\n", "  We present the first detailed three-dimensional hydrodynamic implicit large\neddy simulations of turbulent convection for carbon burning. The simulations\nstart with an initial radial profile mapped from a carbon burning shell within\na 15 solar mass stellar evolution model. We considered 4 resolutions from 128^3\nto 1024^3 zones. These simulations confirm that convective boundary mixing\n(CBM) occurs via turbulent entrainment as in the case of oxygen burning. The\nexpansion of the boundary into the surrounding stable region and the\nentrainment rate are smaller at the bottom boundary because it is stiffer than\nthe upper boundary. The results of this and similar studies call for improved\nCBM prescriptions in 1D stellar evolution models.\n", "  Unpredictable Kirkendall void formation at the interface of circuit\ninterconnections underlies degradation in electronics, yet there is a lack of\neffective approaches to curb the amount of these voids. Here we developed a\nstrain-anneal method to tailor grain size distributions in the copper substrate\nof interconnections, and demonstrate quantitatively that not only the removal\nof the impurities but also an increase in the grain size of the substrates\nleads to an appreciable decline in the void density. The interconnections on\nthe substrate recrystallized at a high annealing temperature show the massive\nporosity and the increased sensitivity of the voiding to the grain size. Our\nfindings have broad implications for manipulation of void propensity in many\nother hetero-interfaces and are essential for high-performance circuit bonding\nin high temperature/high power electronic devices based on wide band gap\nsemiconductors.\n", "  We present a pedagogical review of the fundamental concepts in thermodynamics\nof information, by focusing on the second law of thermodynamics and the entropy\nproduction. Especially, we discuss the relationship among thermodynamic\nreversibility, logical reversibility, and heat emission in the context of the\nLandauer principle and clarify that these three concepts are fundamentally\ndistinct to each other. We also discuss thermodynamics of measurement and\nfeedback control by Maxwell's demon. We clarify that the demon and the second\nlaw are indeed consistent in the measurement and the feedback processes\nindividually, by including the mutual information to the entropy production.\n", "  The chemical mixing at the Fe-on-Ti and Ti-on-Fe, i.e. the bottom and top\ninterfaces of Fe in atomically deposited layers, were studied experimentally\nand by molecular dynamics simulations of the layer growth. The basic structure\nand chemical composition of the layers were explored in cross-sections using\ntransmission electron microscopy. The calculations show a concentration\ndistribution along the layer growth direction which is atomically sharp at the\nTi-on-Fe interface for the (001) and (110) crystallographic orientations of the\nFe layer, while it varies over a few atomic layers for Fe(111) substrate and at\nthe Fe-on-Ti interface for all studied substrate orientations. Conversion\nelectron M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray reflectometry measurements indicate\nan even larger asymmetry of the bottom and top Fe interface in Ti/Fe/Ti\ntrilayers grown over Si(111) substrate by vacuum evaporation.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the electromagnetic field generated in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions on the dissociation of $\\Upsilon$ mesons. The\nelectromagnetic field is calculated using a simple model which characterizes\nthe emerging quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by its conductivity only. A numerical\nestimate of the field strength experienced by $\\Upsilon$ mesons embedded in the\nexpanding QGP and its consequences on the $\\Upsilon$ dissociation is made. The\nelectromagnetic field effects prove to be negligible compared to the\nestablished strong-interaction suppression mechanisms.\n", "  Bright Active Galactic Nuclei are powered by accretion of mass onto the super\nmassive black holes at the centers of the host galaxies. For fainter objects\nstar formation may significantly contribute to the luminosity. We summarize\nexperimental indicators of the accretion processes in Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN), i.e., observable activity indicators that allow us to conclude on the\nnature of accretion. The Galactic Center is the closest galactic nucleus that\ncan be studied with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity.\nTherefore, here we also include the presentation of recent observational\nresults on Sagittarius A* and the conditions for star formation in the central\nstellar cluster. We cover results across the electromagnetic spectrum and find\nthat the Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) system is well ordered with respect to its\ngeometrical orientation and its emission processes of which we assume to\nreflect the accretion process onto the super massive black hole.\n", "  The graviton solutions for the glueball spectrum of ref.\n\\cite{Rinaldi:2017wdn} interpreted in a different manner lead to very\ninteresting results which we describe in this comment.\n", "  The method of self-similar root approximants has earlier been shown to\nprovide accurate interpolating formulas for functions for which small-variable\nexpansions are given and the behaviour of the functions at large variables is\nknown. Now this method is generalized for the purpose of extrapolating\nsmall-variable expansions to the region of finite and large variables, where\nthe sought function exhibits critical behaviour. The procedure of calculating\ncritical indices is formulated and illustrated by a variety of physical\nproblems.\n", "  A variant of the parallel tempering method is proposed in terms of a\nstochastic switching process for the coupled dynamics of replica configuration\nand temperature permutation. This formulation is shown to facilitate the\nanalysis of the convergence properties of parallel tempering by large deviation\ntheory, which indicates that the method should be operated in the infinite\nswapping limit to maximize sampling efficiency. The effective equation for the\nreplica alone that arises in this infinite swapping limit simply involves\nreplacing the original potential by a mixture potential. The analysis of the\ngeometric properties of this potential offers a new perspective on the issues\nof how to choose of temperature ladder, and why many temperatures should\ntypically be introduced to boost the sampling efficiency. It is also shown how\nto simulate the effective equation in this many temperature regime using\nmultiscale integrators. Finally, similar ideas are also used to discuss\nextensions of the infinite swapping limits to the technique of simulated\ntempering.\n", "  The objective of the SPHERE Data Center is to optimize the scientific return\nof SPHERE at the VLT, by providing optimized reduction procedures, services to\nusers and publicly available reduced data. This paper describes our motivation,\nthe implementation of the service (partners, infrastructure and developments),\nservices, description of the on-line data, and future developments. The SPHERE\nData Center is operational and has already provided reduced data with a good\nreactivity to many observers. The first public reduced data have been made\navailable in 2017. The SPHERE Data Center is gathering a strong expertise on\nSPHERE data and is in a very good position to propose new reduced data in the\nfuture, as well as improved reduction procedures.\n", "  Magnetic twist is thought to play an important role in many structures of the\nsolar atmosphere. One of the effects of twist is to modify the properties of\nthe eigenmodes of magnetic tubes. In the linear regime standing kink solutions\nare characterized by a change in polarization of the transverse displacement\nalong the twisted tube. In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the\ndevelopment of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is\noscillating laterally. These Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced\neither by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of\nthe sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube, or\neither by the continuous small length-scales produced by phase-mixing when\nthere is a smooth inhomogeneous layer. In this work the effect of twist is\nconsistently investigated by solving the time-dependent problem including the\nprocess of energy transfer to the inhomogeneous layer. It is found that twist\nalways delays the appearance of the shear instability but for tubes with thin\ninhomogeneous layers the effect is relatively small for moderate values of\ntwist. On the contrary, for tubes with thick layers, the effect of twist is\nmuch stronger. This can have some important implications regarding observations\nof transverse kink modes and the KHI itself.\n", "  The interval of a flat Minkowski space is invariant with respect to the\npreviously found three-dimensional transformation for point rotating coordinate\nsystems. The assumption that our space is an object of point rotation at a\nfrequency initiates the appearance of a new term in the Dirac equation. The\nupper boundary for this frequency is determined from shifts of the degenerate\nlevels of the hydrogen atom. The boundary is about 2.9 kHz.\n", "  Based on the SIMBAD database, we collected necessary information on the\ncomparison stars used by E. Schenfeld in observations of variable stars in the\n19th century.\n", "  We report on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a\nmonolayer of GdAg2, forming a moir\\'e pattern on Ag(111). Combining scanning\ntunneling microscopy and ab-initio spin-polarized calculations, we show that\nthe electronic band structure can be shifted linearly via thermal dependent\nstrain of the intra-layer atomic distance in a range between 1-7%, leading to\nlateral hetero-structuring. Furthermore, the coupling of the incommensurable\nGdAg2 alloy layer to the Ag(111) substrate leads to spatially varying atomic\nrelaxation causing subsurface layer buckling, texturing of the electronic and\nspin properties, and inhomogeneity of the magnetic anisotropy energy across the\nlayer. These results provide perspectives for a control of electronic\nproperties and magnetic ordering in atomically-thin layers.\n", "  The mass per unit length of a cylindrical system can be found from its\nexternal metric as can its angular momentum. Can the fluxes of energy, momentum\nand angular momentum along the cylinder also be so found? We derive the metric\nof a beam of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation from the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations. We show how the uniform plane wave solutions miss\nthe angular momentum carried by the wave. We study the energy, momentum,\nangular momentum and their fluxes along the cylinder both for this beam and in\ngeneral. The three Killing vectors of any stationary cylindrical system give\nthree Komar flux vectors which in turn give six conserved fluxes. We elucidate\nKomar's mysterious factor 2 by evaluating Komar integrals for systems that have\nno trace to their stress tensors. The Tolman-Komar formula gives twice the\nenergy for such systems which also have twice the gravity. For other\ncylindrical systems their formula gives correct results.\n", "  The energetic particle environment on the Martian surface is influenced by\nsolar and heliospheric modulation and changes in the local atmospheric pressure\n(or column depth). The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) on board the Mars\nScience Laboratory rover Curiosity on the surface of Mars has been measuring\nthis effect for over four Earth years (about two Martian years). The\nanticorrelation between the recorded surface Galactic Cosmic Ray-induced dose\nrates and pressure changes has been investigated by Rafkin et al. (2014) and\nthe long-term solar modulation has also been empirically analyzed and modeled\nby Guo et al. (2015). This paper employs the newly updated HZETRN2015 code to\nmodel the Martian atmospheric shielding effect on the accumulated dose rates\nand the change of this effect under different solar modulation and atmospheric\nconditions. The modeled results are compared with the most up-to-date (from 14\nAugust 2012 to 29 June 2016) observations of the RAD instrument on the surface\nof Mars. Both model and measurements agree reasonably well and show the\natmospheric shielding effect under weak solar modulation conditions and the\ndecline of this effect as solar modulation becomes stronger. This result is\nimportant for better risk estimations of future human explorations to Mars\nunder different heliospheric and Martian atmospheric conditions.\n", "  The present paper reports on results of quantum dynamics calculations for\nStark-chirp rapid-adiabatic passage (SCRAP) in two-level systems with electric\nfields computed with the optimal control theory. The Pontryagin maximum\nprinciple is used to determine the robust optimal control fields in the\npresence of time-varying and spatially-inhomogeneous perturbing electric\nfields. The concept of a non-adiabatic correction to the Bloch vector dynamics\nis introduced and discussed. The existence of a non-zero geometric phase is\nproved for certain adiabatic paths, which correspond to the complete population\nreturn in the rapid-adiabatic passage. A connection is shown between the\ngeometric phase and a measure of the non-adiabatic effects in the time\nevolution of the state vector during SCRAP. Different cost functionals used in\nthe optimal control scheme are shown to correlate with different topologies of\nthe paths followed by the parameters of the Hamiltonian, which tightly relates\nto the values of the geometric phase acquired by the adiabatic wavefunction.\n", "  The axiomatic theory of quantum first-kind measurements is developed in a\nrigorous form based on five Postulates. The measurement theory for observable\nwith continuous spectrum is given in a rigged Hilbert space. This approach also\ndescribes the measurements with non-ideal initial conditions. It yields the\nsurvival effect in the position measurement of the particles. It is also found\nthat no such survival effect in the momentum measurement of the particles. The\nPostulates of axiomatic theory yield the survival effect which violates the\nHeisenberg uncertainty relation. This theoretical result is demonstrated by the\nwave function with minimum of position and momentum uncertainty of the\nparticle.\n", "  Due to the increasing availability of large-scale observation and simulation\ndatasets, data-driven representations arise as efficient and relevant\ncomputation representations of dynamical systems for a wide range of\napplications, where model-driven models based on ordinary differential equation\nremain the state-of-the-art approaches. In this work, we investigate neural\nnetworks (NN) as physically-sound data-driven representations of such systems.\nReinterpreting Runge-Kutta methods as graphical models, we consider a residual\nNN architecture and introduce bilinear layers to embed non-linearities which\nare intrinsic features of dynamical systems. From numerical experiments for\nclassic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed\nNN-based architecture both in terms of forecasting performance and model\nidentification.\n", "  The preceding paper (Nissen 2017) shows multiphasic profiles, straight lines\nseparated by discontinuous transitions, for the ion activities of NaCl and KCl\nat 15, 25, 35 and 45oC based on very precise tabular data of Lee et al. (2002).\nIn addition, references are given to previous findings of multiphasic profiles\nfor a variety of processes and phenomena, starting with the uptake of sulfate\nby roots and leaf slices of barley (Nissen 1971).\n  In a continuation, the present paper shows multiphasic profiles for the ion\nactivities of NaBr and KBr for data also from Lee et al. (2002).\n", "  We describe some recent results on the evolution of accretion disks around\nblack holes and neutron stars obtained in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations\nin general relativity (GR) with the inclusion of radiation (GRRMHD).\n", "  There is a significant amount of online human activity which is either\nclandestine or illicit in nature, and hence where individuals operate under\nfear of exposure or capture. Yet there is little theoretical understanding of\nwhat models best describe the resulting dynamics. Here we address this gap, by\nanalyzing the evolutionary dynamics of the supporters behind the 95 pro-ISIS\nonline communities (i.e. self-organized social media groups) that appeared\nrecently on a global social media site. We show that although they do not\nfollow a conventional (i.e. size-based) preferential attachment (PA) model,\ntheir dynamical evolution can be explained by a new variant that we introduce\nhere, which we refer to as active attraction model (AA). This AA model takes\ninto account the locality and group heterogeneity which undoubtedly feature in\nhumans' online behavior under pressure, but which are not contained in\nconventional PA models. The AA model captures both group-specific and\nmacroscopic observations over all size ranges -- as opposed to just the tail\nfor large groups or groups' initial growth -- suggesting that heterogeneity and\nlocality play a crucial role in the dynamics of online extremist support. We\nderive approximate expressions for the group size distributions in two simple\nsystems that involve simultaneously the mechanisms of group joining (governed\nby either PA or AA), group leaving, and account banning, and show how these\nprocesses influence the group size distributions. We believe this work will\nserve in helping understand a broad spectrum of online human activities which\nare either clandestine or illicit in nature, and hence where individuals\noperate under fear of exposure or capture.\n", "  The measurements of the two-photon production of the Higgs boson and of\n$W^{\\pm}$ boson pairs in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at the Future Circular\nCollider (FCC-ee) are investigated. The processes\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\xrightarrow{\\gamma \\gamma}e^+\\,{\\rm H}\\,e^-,e^+\\,{\\rm W^+W^-}\\,e^-$\nare computed using the effective photon approximation for electron-positron\nbeams, and studied in their ${\\rm H}\\to b\\bar{b}$ and ${\\rm W^+W^-}\\to 4j$\ndecay final-states including parton showering and hadronization, jet\nreconstruction, $e^\\pm$ forward tagging, and realistic experimental cuts. After\nselection criteria, up to 75 Higgs bosons and 6600 $\\rm W^{\\pm}$ pairs will be\nreconstructed on top of controllable continuum backgrounds at $\\sqrt{s} = $240\nand 350 GeV for the total expected integrated luminosities, by tagging the\nscattered $e^\\pm$ with near-beam detectors. A 5$\\sigma$ observation of $\\gamma\n\\gamma \\to$H is thereby warranted, as well as high-statistics studies of triple\n$\\rm \\gamma WW$ and quartic $\\rm \\gamma\\gamma WW$ electroweak couplings,\nimproving by at least factors of 2 and 10 the current limits on dimension-6\nanomalous quartic gauge couplings.\n", "  Controlled formation of porous silicon has been of primary importance for\nnumerous landmark applications such as light emitting sources, sensors,\nactuators, drug delivery systems, and energy storage applications. Frequently\nexplored methods to form the structures have long relied on selective etching\nof silicon, which still stands as the most controllable and reliable methods to\nhighlight essence of the applications. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented\napproach to form silicon framework, which is spontaneously formed with\natomistic arrangement of silicon without gravimetric loss via single\nelectrochemical (de)alloying with lithium. Carefully controlling bare\ncrystallinity of Si and composite/electrode designs, we reveal that the key\nprerequisite to forming the structure lies in using unique dealloying dynamics\nof crystalline-amorphous phase transformations at room temperature. Using the\nfeature, we clearly highlight that commercially available nano-structured\nsilicon particles can abruptly yet uniformly transform into continuous sub-2 nm\nspherical silicon frameworks with size-tunable pores.\n", "  We present in this article the work of Henri B\\'enard (1874-1939), French\nphysicist who began the systematic experimental study of two hydrodynamic\nsystems: the thermal convection of fluids heated from below (the\nRayleigh-B\\'enard convection and the B\\'enard-Marangoni convection) and the\nperiodical vortex shedding behind a bluff body in a flow (the\nB\\'enard-K\\'arm\\'an vortex street). Across his scientific biography, we review\nthe interplay between experiments and theory in these two major subjects of\nfluid mechanics.\n", "  Stark deceleration is a technique that uses time-varying inhomogeneous\nelectric fields to decelerate polar molecules for various molecular beam and\ntrapping experiments. New ring-geometry Stark decelerators with continuously\nvarying voltages offer a method to produce a more intense source of molecules\nin a technique called traveling-wave Stark deceleration. However, this type of\ndeceleration is more experimentally challenging than the more typically used\ncrossed-pin geometry decelerators with pulsed voltages. Here, we present an\nexperimental realization of a ring-geometry Stark decelerator using either\ncontinuously varying or discrete voltages. Pulsed-ring Stark deceleration using\ndiscrete voltages is easier to implement and, under certain circumstances, is\nmore efficient than traveling-wave Stark deceleration. A comparison of\nexperimental and simulated results between traveling-wave and pulsed-ring Stark\ndeceleration is presented along with a simple model for determining when each\nmode is more efficient.\n", "  Micromagnetic sensors play a major role towards the miniaturization in the\nindustrial society. The adoption of new and emerging sensor technologies like\nanisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) sensors are mainly driven by their integrability and\nenhanced sensitivity. At the core of such sensors, a microstructured\nferromagnetic thin film element transduces the magnetic signal. Such elements\nusually switch via multi-domain, C- or S-shaped magnetization states and,\ntherefore, often exhibit an open non-linear hysteresis curve. Linearity and\nhysteretic effects, as well as magnetic noise are key features in the\nimprovement of such sensors. Here, we report on the physical origin of these\ndisturbing factors and the inherent connection of noise and hysteresis.\nCritical noise sources are identified by means of analytic and micromagnetic\nmodels. The dominant noise source is due to irreproducible magnetic switching\nof the transducer element at external fields close to the Stoner Wohlfarth\nswitching field. Furthermore, a solution is presented to overcome these\nlimiting factors: a disruptive sensor design is proposed and analyzed which\nrealizes a topologically protected magnetic vortex state in the transducer\nelement. Compared to state of the art sensors the proposed sensor layout has\nnegligible hysteresis, a linear regime about an order of magnitude higher and\nlower magnetic noise making the sensor ideal candidate for applications ranging\nfrom automotive industry to biological application.\n", "  We consider the equations $u_{yy} = u_y u_{xx} - (u_x + u)u_{xy} + u_x u_y$\nand $u_{yy} = (u_x + x)u_{xy} - (u_{xx} + 2)u_y$ that arise as reductions of\nthe universal hierarchy and rdDym equations, respectively, and describe the Lie\nalgebras of nonlocal symmetries in infinite-dimensional coverings naturally\nassociated to these equations.\n", "  In 1982, in his classical work, L. Rayleigh considered the instability of a\ncylinder of viscous liquid under capillary force, the so-called\nPlateau-Rayleigh instability. In this work, in linear approximation, he\nobtained a dispersion equation describing the increment of this instability as\na function of wavelength, the radius of cylinder, the mass density, surface\ntension, and viscosity of the liquid. Hundreds of authors referred to this\nwork, but none of them used his dispersion equation in its complete form; they\nused only the asymptotic solutions of his equation for zero and infinitely\nlarge viscousities. A reason for this is, probably, that Rayleigh's writing is\nvery difficult and his dispersion equation is quite complex. Then, in 1961, S\nChandrasekhar, in his monograph, also considered the stability of a viscous\ncylindrical jet and obtained his dispersion equation which is also quite\ncomplex and differs from the one obtained by Rayleigh. As in the case of\nRayleigh's dispersion equation, other works use only the asymptotic solution of\nChandrasekhar's equation that corresponds to the case where the viscosity is\nvery large in comparison to inertia. In this paper, I demonstrate that\nChandrasekhar's dispersion equation is equivalent to Rayleigh's and then\nsimplify their dispersion equations to a form which can be easily solved\nnumerically for arbitrary values of viscosity. I also present Mathematica code\nto calculate the maximum increment of the Plateau-Rayleigh instability for\ngiven parameters of the jet. To illustrate how the code works, I apply it to a\ncylindrical jet to estimate its breakup.\n", "  The Rouse number is commonly used to estimate the mode of the sediment\ntransports in turbulent flows with large Reynolds number. However, in\nmicrochannels such as in modern inkjet systems, the liquid flows are usually\nlaminar. In this paper, I modify the Rouse number by expanding it to the case\nof weakly turbulent and laminar flows and construct a calculator to estimate\nthe modes of sediment transport in microchannels. To illustrate the\napplicability of the modified Rouse number, I apply it to the transport of\nsediments in an inkjet system and compare theoretical results with experimental\nobservations. The modified Rouse number constructed in this paper can be used\nin other application as well.\n", "  In this note we consider M-theory compactified on a warped Calabi-Yau\nfourfold including the eight-derivative terms in the eleven-dimensional action\nknown in the literature. We dimensionally reduce this theory on geometries with\none Kahler modulus and determine the resulting three-dimensional Kahler\npotential and complex coordinate. The logarithmic form of the corrections\nsuggests that they might admit a physical interpretation in terms of one-loop\ncorrections to the effective action. Including only the known terms the\nno-scale condition in three dimensions is broken, but we discuss caveats to\nthis conclusion. In particular, we consider additional new eight-derivative\nterms in eleven dimensions and show that they are strongly constrained by\ncompatibility with the Calabi-Yau threefold reduction. We examine their impact\non the Calabi-Yau fourfold reduction and the restoration of the no-scale\nproperty.\n", "  We study ${\\mathcal N}=(1,0)$ six-dimensional theories living on defects of\nnon-geometric backgrounds of the $E_8\\times E_8$ and the\n$\\text{Spin}(32)/{\\mathbb Z}_2$ heterotic strings. Such configurations can be\nanalyzed by dualizing to F-theory on elliptic K3-fibered non-compact Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds. The majority of the resulting dual threefolds turn out to contain\nsingularities which do not admit a crepant resolution. When the singularities\ncan be resolved crepantly, the theories living on the defect are explicitly\ndetermined and reveal a form of duality in which distinct defects are described\nby the same IR fixed point. In particular, a subclass of non-geometric defects\ncorresponds to SCFTs/LSTs arising from small heterotic instantons on ADE\nsingularities.\n", "  Long-term measurements (1972-2015) of the reflectivity of Uranus at 472 and\n551 nm display variability that is incompletely explained by seasonal effects.\nSpectral analysis shows this non-seasonal variability tracks the 11-year solar\ncycle. Two mechanisms could cause solar modulation, (a) nucleation onto ions or\nelectrons created by galactic cosmic rays (GCR), or (b) UV-induced aerosol\ncolour changes. Ion-aerosol theory is used to identify expected relationships\nbetween reflectivity fluctuations and GCR flux, tested with multiple regression\nand compared to the linear response predicted between reflectivity and solar UV\nflux. The statistics show that 24%of the variance in reflectivity fluctuations\nat 472 nm is explained by GCR ion-induced nucleation, compared to 22% for a\nUV-only mechanism. Similar GCR-related variability exists in Neptune's\natmosphere, hence the effects found at Uranus provide the first example of\ncommon variability in two planetary atmospheres driven through energetic\nparticle modulation by their host star.\n", "  Cosmological observations are a powerful probe of neutrino properties, and in\nparticular of their mass. In this review, we first discuss the role of\nneutrinos in shaping the cosmological evolution at both the background and\nperturbation level, and describe their effects on cosmological observables such\nas the cosmic microwave background and the distribution of matter at large\nscale. We then present the state of the art concerning the constraints on\nneutrino masses from those observables, and also review the prospects for\nfuture experiments. We also briefly discuss the prospects for determining the\nneutrino hierarchy from cosmology, the complementarity with laboratory\nexperiments, and the constraints on neutrino properties beyond their mass.\n", "  Surface plasmons at metal interfaces are collective excitations of the\nconduction electrons and the electromagnetic field. They exist in \"curved\nthree-dimensional space-times\" defined by the shape of the metal surface and\nthe spatial distribution of the dielectric constant near the surface. Here we\nshow that surface plasmon toy models of many non-trivial space-time metrics,\nsuch as wormholes and black holes, can be easily built and studied in\nexperiments. For example, a droplet of dielectric on the metal surface behaves\nas a black hole for surface plasmons within a substantial frequency range. On\nthe other hand, a nanohole in a thin metal membrane may be treated as a\nwormhole connecting two \"flat\" surface plasmon worlds located on the opposite\ninterfaces of the membrane.\n", "  To help understand why different published analyses of the Super-Kamiokande\nsolar neutrino data arrive at different conclusions, we have applied six\ndifferent methods to a standardized problem. The key difference between the\nvarious methods rests in the amount of information that each processes. A\nLomb-Scargle analysis that uses the mid times of the time bins and ignores\nexperimental error estimates uses the least information. A likelihood analysis\nthat uses the start times, end times, and mean live times, and takes account of\nthe experimental error estimates, makes the greatest use of the available\ninformation. We carry out power-spectrum analyses of the Super-Kamiokande 5-day\nsolar neutrino data, using each method in turn, for a standard search band (0\nto 50 yr-1). For each method, we also carry out a fixed number (10,000) of\nMonte-Carlo simulations for the purpose of estimating the significance of the\nleading peak in each power spectrum. We find that, with one exception, the\nresults of these calculations are compatible with those of previously published\nanalyses. (We are unable to replicate Koshio's recent results.) We find that\nthe significance of the peaks at 9.43 yr-1 and at 43.72 yr-1 increases\nprogressively as one incorporates more information into the analysis procedure.\n"]}
