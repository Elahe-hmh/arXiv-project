We discuss tunneling of both charged and uncharged scalar particles\nfrom the event horizons. For this purpose, we use the Klein-Gordon equation and\nfind the tunneling probability of outging scalar particles. The procedure gives\nHawking temperature for rotating charged black strings as well.\n", "  This note fills a gap in the article with title above [1]. We provide the\nproof of Equation (82) of Lemma 5 in [1] and thereby complete its power\ncounting analysis with a more precise next-to-leading-order estimate.\n", "  We study Hawking radiation from three-dimensional black holes. For this\npurpose the emission of charged scalar and charged fermionic particles is\ninvestigated from charged BTZ black holes, with and without rotation. We use\nthe quantum tunneling approach incorporating WKB approximation and spacetime\nsymmetries. Another class of black hole which is asymptotic to a Sol\nthree-manifold has also been investigated. This procedure gives us the\ntunneling probability of outgoing particles, and we compute the temperature of\nthe radiation for these black holes. We also consider the quantum tunneling of\nparticles from black hole asymptotic to Sol geometry.\n", "  Small (~50km scale), irregular features seen in Cassini images to be\nemanating from Saturn's F ring have been termed mini-jets by Attree et al.\n(2012). One particular mini-jet was tracked over half an orbital period,\nrevealing its evolution with time and suggesting a collision with a local\nmoonlet as its origin. In addition to these data we present here a much more\ndetailed analysis of the full catalogue of over 800 F ring mini-jets, examining\ntheir distribution, morphology and lifetimes in order to place constraints on\nthe underlying moonlet population. We find mini-jets randomly located in\nlongitude around the ring, with little correlation to the moon Prometheus, and\nrandomly distributed in time, over the full Cassini tour to date. They have a\ntendency to cluster together, forming complicated `multiple' structures, and\nhave typical lifetimes of ~1d. Repeated observations of some features show\nsignificant evolution, including the creation of new mini-jets, implying\nrepeated collisions by the same object. This suggests a population of <~1km\nradius objects with some internal strength and orbits spread over 100km in\nsemi-major axis relative to the F ring but with the majority within 20km. These\nobjects likely formed in the ring under, and were subsequently scattered onto\ndiffering orbits by, the perturbing action of Prometheus. This reinforces the\nidea of the F ring as a region with a complex balance between collisions,\ndisruption and accretion.\n", "  This paper showed how a simple lumped parameter model of a circuit can yield\ncorrect quantum mechanical predictions of its behavior, even when there is\nquantum entanglement between components of that circuit. It addresses an\nimportant example, the circuit of the original Bell's Theorem experiments for\nideal polarizers. Correct predictions emerge from two alternative simple but\ntime-symmetric models based on classical Markov Random Field across space time.\nExact agreement here does not violate Bell's Theorem itself, because the\ninterplay between initial and final outcomes in these calculations does not\nfall within the CHSH definition of time forwards causality. Both models raise\ninteresting questions for future research. The final section discusses several\npossible directions for following up on these results, both in lumped system\nmodeling and in more general approaches. The final section proposed a new\nexperiment with three-photon entanglement which could tell us which is true,\nlocal realistic MRF models and time-symmetric physics, or conventional\npredictions assuming the usual collapse of the wave function. The appendix\nworked out what the conventional predictions would be for the proposed\nexperiment, and also gives a simple master equation version of the collapse\nassumption which does not involve metaphysical observers. Section A.4 gives the\nprediction for the new models.\n", "  A search is presented for new particles in an extension to the Standard Model\nthat includes a heavy Higgs boson H0, an intermediate charged Higgs boson pair\nH+-, and a light Higgs boson h0. The analysis searches for events involving the\nproduction of a single heavy neutral Higgs boson which decays to the charged\nHiggs boson and a W boson, where the charged Higgs boson subsequently decays\ninto a W boson and the lightest neutral Higgs boson decaying to a\nbottom--antibottom-quark pair. Such a cascade results in a W-boson pair and a\nbottom--antibottom-quark pair in the final state. Events with exactly one\nlepton, missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets are selected from a\ndata sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3/fb, collected by\nthe ATLAS detector in proton--proton collisions at sort(s)=8 TeV at the LHC.\nThe data are found to be consistent with Standard Model predictions, and 95%\nconfidence-level upper limits are set on the product of cross section and\nbranching ratio. These limits range from 0.065 pb to 43 pb as a function of H0\nand H+- masses, with m(h0) fixed at 125 GeV.\n", "  We consider spin-3/2 particles on the background of general accelerating\nblack holes and C-metric. The Rarita-Schwinger equations of spin-3/2 particles\nare analyzed on these backgrounds. The emission and absorption probabilities of\nthe spin-3/2 particles on these spacetimes are calculated. These backgrounds\nwhich we analyze contain both black hole horizon and acceleration horizon, and\nhave general electric and magnetic charges, rotation, and acceleration\nparameter. The properties of the spin-3/2 field near the acceleration horizon\nare also computed.\n", "  In this article we investigate the role of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)\ninteraction as a useful resource to distil the bound entanglement in two\nqutrits. Here we study the distillability of Jurkowski et al. bound entangled\nstates. We consider the close system of two qutrits prepared initially in bound\nentangled states and an auxiliary qutrit prepared in pure state. The auxiliary\nqutrit interacts with any one of the qutrit of the closed system through DM\ninteraction. The composite system evolve under unitary dynamics. Taking the\npartial trace operation over the auxiliary qutrit, we show the distillability\nof Jurkowski et al. bound entangled states under DM interaction. It is\ninteresting to investigate that probability amplitude of auxiliary qutrit do\nnot play the role in dynamics, while DM interaction strength is responsible to\nfree the bound entangled states, which can be further distilled. In this work\nwe have used the computable cross norm realignment criteria to detect the bound\nentanglement and negativity have been used to measure the free entanglement.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the synchronization of a vortex based spin\ntransfer oscillator to an external rf current whose frequency is at multiple\nintegers, as well as half integer, of the oscillator frequency. Through a\ntheoretical study of the locking process, we highlight both the crucial role of\nthe symmetries of the spin torques acting on the magnetic vortex and the\nnonlinear properties of the oscillator on the phase locking process. Through\nthe achievement of a perfect injection locking state, we report a record phase\nnoise reduction down to -90dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset frequency. The phase noise of\nthese nanoscale oscillators is demonstrating as being low and controllable\nwhich is of significant importance for real applications using spin transfer\ndevices.\n", "  We present a quantum algorithm for the simulation of molecular systems that\nis asymptotically more efficient than all previous algorithms in the literature\nin terms of the main problem parameters. As in previous work [Babbush et al.,\nNew Journal of Physics 18, 033032 (2016)], we employ a recently developed\ntechnique for simulating Hamiltonian evolution, using a truncated Taylor series\nto obtain logarithmic scaling with the inverse of the desired precision. The\nalgorithm of this paper involves simulation under an oracle for the sparse,\nfirst-quantized representation of the molecular Hamiltonian known as the\nconfiguration interaction (CI) matrix. We construct and query the CI matrix\noracle to allow for on-the-fly computation of molecular integrals in a way that\nis exponentially more efficient than classical numerical methods. Whereas\nsecond-quantized representations of the wavefunction require $\\widetilde{\\cal\nO}(N)$ qubits, where $N$ is the number of single-particle spin-orbitals, the CI\nmatrix representation requires $\\widetilde{\\cal O}(\\eta)$ qubits where $\\eta\n\\ll N$ is the number of electrons in the molecule of interest. We show that the\ngate count of our algorithm scales at most as $\\widetilde{\\cal O}(\\eta^2 N^3\nt)$.\n", "  We report Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data for both the In(1) and In(2)\nsites in the heavy fermion material CeRhIn$_5$ under hydrostatic pressure. The\nKnight shift data reveal a suppression of the hyperfine coupling to the In(1)\nsite as a function of pressure, and the electric field gradient,\n$\\nu_{\\alpha\\alpha}$, at the In(2) site exhibits a change of slope,\n$d\\nu_{\\alpha\\alpha}/dP$, at $P_{c1} = 1.75$ GPa. These changes to these\ncoupling constants reflect alterations to the electronic structure at the\nquantum critical point.\n", "  Single crystals of $(Cd_{1-x} Zn_x)_3 As_2$ were synthesized from\nhigh-temperature solutions and characterized in terms of their structural and\nelectrical properties. Based on the measurements of resistivity and Hall\nsignals, we revealed a chemical-doping-controlled transition from a three\ndimensional Dirac semimetal to a semiconductor with a critical point $x_c/sim\n0.38$. We observed structural transitions from a body-center tetragonal phase\nto a primary tetragonal phase then back to a body-center tetragonal phase in\nthe solid solutions as well, which are irrelevant to the topological phase\ntransition. This continuously tunable system controlled by chemical doping\nprovides a platform for investigating the topological quantum phase transition\nof 3D Dirac electrons.\n", "  We report detailed Knight shift measurements of the two indium sites in the\nheavy fermion compound CeIrIn$_5$ as a function of temperature and field\norientation. We find that the Knight shift anomaly is orientation-dependent,\nwith a crossover temperature $T^*$ that varies by 50% as the field is rotated\nfrom (001) to (100). This result suggests that the hybridization between the Ce\n4f states and the itinerant conduction electrons is anisotropic, a result that\nreflects its collective origin, and may lead to anisotropic Kondo liquid\nbehavior and unconventional superconductivity.\n", "  The concept of spin torque driven high frequency magnetization dynamics has\nopened up the field of spintronics to non-linear physics, potentially in\ncomplex networks of dynamical systems. In the scarce demonstrations of\nsynchronized spin-torque oscillators, the local nature of the magnetic coupling\nthat is used have largely hampered a good understanding and thus the control of\nthe synchronization process. Here we take advantage of the non-local nature of\nan electrical coupling to mutually synchronize spin-torque oscillators through\ntheir self-emitted microwave currents. The control of the synchronized state is\nachieved at the nanoscale through two active components of spin transfer\ntorques, but also externally through an electrical delay line. These additional\nlevels of control of the synchronization capability provide new approaches to\nunderlie a large variety of nanoscale collective dynamics in complex networks.\n", "  We analyze the evolution of an entangled many-body state in a Josephson\ntunneling junction. A N00N state, which is a superposition of two complementary\nFock states, appears in the evolution with sufficient probability only for a\nmoderate many-body interaction on an intermediate time scale. This time scale\nis inversely proportional to the tunneling rate. Interaction between particles\nsupports entanglement: The probability for creating an entangled state decays\nexponentially with the number of non-interacting particles, whereas it decays\nonly like the inverse square root of the number of interacting particles.\n", "  We introduce a framework suitable for describing pattern recognition task\nusing the mathematical language of density matrices. In particular, we provide\na one-to-one correspondence between patterns and pure density operators. This\ncorrespondence enables us to: i) represent the Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC) in\nterms of quantum objects, ii) introduce a Quantum Classifier (QC). By comparing\nthe QC with the NMC on different 2D datasets, we show the first classifier can\nprovide additional information that are particularly beneficial on a classical\ncomputer with respect to the second classifier.\n", "  In the presented note we aim at exploring the possibility of abandoning\ncomplex numbers in the representation of quantum states and operations. We\ndemonstrate a simplified version of quantum mechanics in which the states are\nrepresented using real numbers only. The main advantage of this approach is\nthat the simulation of the $n$-dimensional quantum system requires $n^2$ real\nnumbers, in contrast to the standard case where $n^4$ real numbers are\nrequired. The main disadvantage is the lack of hermicity in the representation\nof quantum states. Using Mathematica computer algebra system we develop a set\nof functions for manipulating real-only quantum states. With the help of this\ntool we study the properties of the introduced representation and the induced\nrepresentation of quantum channels.\n", "  We present a detailed asymptotic analysis of the point indentation of an\nunpressurized, spherical elastic shell. Previous analyses of this classic\nproblem have assumed that for sufficiently large indentation depths, such a\nshell deforms by `mirror buckling' --- a portion of the shell inverts to become\na spherical cap with equal but opposite curvature to the undeformed shell. The\nenergy of deformation is then localized in a ridge in which the deformed and\nundeformed portions of the shell join together, commonly referred to as\nPogorelov's ridge. Rather than using an energy formulation, we revisit this\nproblem from the point of view of the shallow shell equations and perform an\nasymptotic analysis that exploits the largeness of the indentation depth. This\nreveals first that the stress profile associated with mirror buckling is\nsingular as the indenter is approached. This consequence of point indentation\nmeans that mirror buckling must be modified to incorporate the shell's bending\nstiffness close to the indenter and gives rise to an intricate asymptotic\nstructure with seven different spatial regions. This is in contrast with the\nthree regions (mirror-buckled, ridge and undeformed) that are usually assumed\nand yields new insight into the large compressive hoop stress that ultimately\ncauses the shell to buckle azimuthally.\n", "  Formation mechanism of speed-dependent ice bandings in freezing colloidal\nsuspensions, of significance in frost heaving and materials science, remains a\nmystery. With quantitative experiments, we propose a possible mechanism of\nspeed-dependent ice bandings by focusing on the particle packing density and\ndynamic interface undercooling. The particle packing density ahead of the\nfreezing interface decreases with increasing pulling speeds, attributed to the\nspeed-dependent packing of particles. Through affecting the curvature\nundercooling of pore ices, the speed-dependent packing of particles can be used\nto explain speed-dependent thicknesses of ice bandings. The dynamic interface\nundercooling was obtained to explore curvature undercooling of pore ices and\nquantitative details of transient interface positions, speeds and undercooling\nwere given. All the evidences imply that the speed-dependent particle packing\nand dynamic interface undercooling are responsible for speed-dependent ice\nbandings.\n", "  The electron dynamics in metals are usually well described by the\nsemiclassical approximation for long-lived quasiparticles. However, in some\nmetals, the scattering rate of the electrons at elevated temperatures becomes\ncomparable to the Fermi energy; then, this approximation breaks down, and the\nfull quantum-mechanical nature of the electrons must be considered. In this\nwork, we study a solvable, large-$N$ electron-phonon model, which at high\ntemperatures enters the non-quasiparticle regime. In this regime, the model\nexhibits \"resistivity saturation\" to a temperature-independent value of the\norder of the quantum of resistivity - the first analytically tractable model to\ndo so. The saturation is not due to a fundamental limit on the electron\nlifetime, but rather to the appearance of a second conductivity channel. This\nis suggestive of the phenomenological \"parallel resistor formula\", known to\ndescribe the resistivity of a variety of saturating metals.\n", "  The work of Ansumali \\textit{et al.}\\cite{Ansumali} is extended to Two\nDimensional Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in which energy is cascaded to\nsmall spatial scales and thus requires subgrid modeling. Applying large eddy\nsimulation (LES) modeling of the macroscopic fluid equations results in the\nneed to apply ad-hoc closure schemes. LES is applied to a suitable mesoscopic\nlattice Boltzmann representation from which one can recover the MHD equations\nin the long wavelength, long time scale Chapman-Enskog limit (i.e., the Knudsen\nlimit). Thus on first performing filter width expansions on the lattice\nBoltzmann equations followed by the standard small Knudsen expansion on the\nfiltered lattice Boltzmann system results in a closed set of MHD turbulence\nequations provided we enforce the physical constraint that the subgrid effects\nfirst enter the dynamics at the transport time scales. In particular, a\nmulti-time relaxation collision operator is considered for the density\ndistribution function and a single relaxation collision operator for the vector\nmagnetic distribution function. The LES does not destroy the property that\n$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf B = 0$ automatically without the need for divergence\ncleaning.\n", "  We have identified a mechanism of collective nuclear de-excitation in a\nBose-Einstein condensate of $^{135}$Cs atoms in their isomeric states,\n$^{135m}$Cs, suitable for the generation of coherent gamma photons. The process\ndescribed here does not correspond to single-pass amplification, which cannot\noccur in atomic systems due to the large shift between absorption and emission\nlines, nor does it require the large densities associated to standard Dicke\nsuper-radiance. It thus overcome the limitations that have been hindering the\ngeneration of coherent gamma rays in many systems. Therefore, we propose an\napproach for generation of coherent gamma rays, which relies on a combination\nof well established techniques of nuclear and atomic physics, and can be\nrealized with currently available technology.\n", "  One of the most important developments in Monte Carlo simulation of collider\nevents for the LHC has been the arrival of schemes and codes for matching of\nparton showers to matrix elements calculated at next-to-leading order in the\nQCD coupling. The POWHEG scheme, and particularly its implementation in the\nPOWHEG-BOX code, has attracted most attention due to ease of use and effective\nportability between parton shower algorithms.\n  But formal accuracy to NLO does not guarantee predictivity, and the\nbeyond-fixed-order corrections associated with the shower may be large.\nFurther, there are open questions over which is the \"best\" variant of the\nPOWHEG matching procedure to use, and how to evaluate systematic uncertainties\ndue to the degrees of freedom in the scheme.\n  In this paper we empirically explore the scheme variations allowed in Pythia8\nmatching to POWHEG-BOX dijet events, demonstrating the effects of both discrete\nand continuous freedoms in emission vetoing details for both tuning to data and\nfor estimation of systematic uncertainties from the matching and parton shower\naspects of the POWHEG-BOX+Pythia8 generator combination.\n", "  We consider the effects of inhomogeneous initial conditions in both the\nscalar field profile and the extrinsic curvature on different inflationary\nmodels. In particular, we compare the robustness of small field inflation to\nthat of large field inflation, using numerical simulations with Einstein\ngravity in 3+1 dimensions. We find that small field inflation can fail in the\npresence of subdominant gradient energies, suggesting that it is much less\nrobust to inhomogeneities than large field inflation, which withstands dominant\ngradient energies. However, we also show that small field inflation can be\nsuccessful even if some regions of spacetime start out in the region of the\npotential that does not support inflation. In the large field case, we confirm\nprevious results that inflation is robust if the inflaton occupies the\ninflationary part of the potential. Furthermore, we show that increasing\ninitial scalar gradients will not form sufficiently massive inflation-ending\nblack holes if the initial hypersurface is approximately flat. Finally, we\nconsider the large field case with a varying extrinsic curvature K, such that\nsome regions are initially collapsing. We find that this may again lead to\nlocal black holes, but overall the spacetime remains inflationary if the\nspacetime is open, which confirms previous theoretical studies.\n", "  Betweenness Centrality (BC) is an important measure used widely in complex\nnetwork analysis, such as social network, web page search, etc. Computing the\nexact BC values is highly time consuming. Currently the fastest exact BC\ndetermining algorithm is given by Brandes, taking $O(nm)$ time for unweighted\ngraphs and $O(nm+n^2\\log n)$ time for weighted graphs, where $n$ is the number\nof vertices and $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. Due to the extreme\ndifficulty of reducing the time complexity of exact BC determining problem,\nmany researchers have considered the possibility of any satisfactory BC\napproximation algorithms, especially those based on samplings. Bader et al.\ngive the currently best BC approximation algorithm, with a high probability to\nsuccessfully estimate the BC of one vertex within a factor of $1/\\varepsilon$\nusing $\\varepsilon t$ samples, where $t$ is the ratio between $n^2$ and the BC\nvalue of the vertex. However, some of the algorithmic parameters in Bader's\nwork are not yet tightly bounded, leaving some space to improve their\nalgorithm. In this project, we revisit Bader's algorithm, give more tight\nbounds on the estimations, and improve the performance of the approximation\nalgorithm, i.e., fewer samples and lower factors. On the other hand, Riondato\nproposes a non-adaptive BC approximation method with samplings on shortest\npaths. We investigate the possibility to give an adaptive algorithm with\nsamplings on vertices. With rigorous reasoning, we show that this algorithm can\nalso give bounded approximation factors and number of samplings. To evaluate\nour results, we also conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets,\nand find that both our algorithms can achieve acceptable performance. We verify\nthat our work can improve the current BC approximation algorithm with better\nparameters, i.e., higher successful probabilities, lower factors and fewer\nsamples.\n", "  We consider expansions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of models of quantum\nfield theory. For a class of models known as generalized spin boson model we\nprove the existence of asymptotic expansions of the ground state and the ground\nstate energy to arbitrary order. We need a mild but very natural infrared\nassumption, which is weaker than the assumption usually needed for other\nmethods such as operator theoretic renormalization to be applicable. The result\ncomplements previously shown analyticity properties.\n", "  A unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) for multi-scale and multi-component\nplasma transport is constructed. The current scheme is a direct modeling\nmethod, where the time evolution solutions from the Vlasov-BGK equations of\nelectron and ion and the Maxwell equations are used to construct a\nscale-dependent plasma simulation model. As a result, with the changing of\nmodeling scales of mesh size and time step and with a variation of Knudsen\nnumber and Larmor radius, the discretized governing equations for a wide range\nof plasma evolution regimes can be obtained. The physics recovered in UGKS\nranges from the Vlasov equation in the kinetic scale to different-type\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the hydrodynamic scale. The key\ndynamics in UGKS is the un-splitting treatment of particle collision,\nacceleration, and transport in the construction of numerical flux across a cell\ninterface. At the same time, the plasma evolution is coupled with the Maxwell\nequations in an implicit way, which automatically provides a smooth transition\nbetween the Ampere's law and the Ohm's law for the calculation of electric\nfield. The time step of UGKS is not limited by the relaxation time, the\ncyclotron period, and the speed of light in the MHD regime. The UGKS is\nvalidated by numerical test cases, such as the Landau damping and two stream\ninstability in the kinetic regime, and the Brio-Wu shock tube problem and the\nOrszag- Tang MHD turbulence problem in the hydrodynamic regime. The scheme is\nalso used to study the geospace environment modeling (GEM), such as the\nchallenging magnetic reconnection problem in the transition regime. Overall,\nthe UGKS is a physically reliable multi-scale plasma simulation method. It\nprovides a powerful and unified approach for the study of plasma physics.\n", "  A measurement of electron antineutrino oscillation by the Daya Bay Reactor\nNeutrino Experiment is described in detail. Six 2.9-GW$_{\\rm\n  th}$ nuclear power reactors of the Daya Bay and Ling Ao nuclear power\nfacilities served as intense sources of $\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$'s. Comparison of\nthe $\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$ rate and energy spectrum measured by antineutrino\ndetectors far from the nuclear reactors ($\\sim$1500-1950 m) relative to\ndetectors near the reactors ($\\sim$350-600 m) allowed a precise measurement of\n$\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$ disappearance. More than 2.5 million $\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$\ninverse beta decay interactions were observed, based on the combination of 217\ndays of operation of six antineutrino detectors (Dec. 2011--Jul. 2012) with a\nsubsequent 1013 days using the complete configuration of eight detectors (Oct.\n2012--Jul. 2015). The $\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$ rate observed at the far detectors\nrelative to the near detectors showed a significant deficit, $R=0.949 \\pm\n0.002(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm 0.002(\\mathrm{syst.})$. The energy dependence of\n$\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$ disappearance showed the distinct variation predicted by\nneutrino oscillation. Analysis using an approximation for the three-flavor\noscillation probability yielded the flavor-mixing angle\n$\\sin^22\\theta_{13}=0.0841 \\pm 0.0027(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm\n0.0019(\\mathrm{syst.})$ and the effective neutrino mass-squared difference of\n$\\left|{\\Delta}m^2_{\\mathrm{ee}}\\right|=(2.50 \\pm 0.06(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm\n0.06(\\mathrm{syst.})) \\times 10^{-3}\\ {\\rm eV}^2$. Analysis using the exact\nthree-flavor probability found ${\\Delta}m^2_{32}=(2.45 \\pm 0.06(\\mathrm{stat.})\n\\pm 0.06(\\mathrm{syst.})) \\times 10^{-3}\\ {\\rm eV}^2$ assuming the normal\nneutrino mass hierarchy and ${\\Delta}m^2_{32}=(-2.56 \\pm 0.06(\\mathrm{stat.})\n\\pm 0.06(\\mathrm{syst.})) \\times 10^{-3}\\ {\\rm eV}^2$ for the inverted\nhierarchy.\n", "  The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a general purpose detector, designed to\nrun at the highest luminosity at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its\ndistinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6-m-diameter\nby 12.5-m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10,000-ton return yoke made of\nconstruction steel. The flux return yoke consists of five dodecagonal\nthree-layered barrel wheels and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of\nsteel blocks up to 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon\ndetection system. To measure the field in and around the steel, a system of 22\nflux loops and 82 3-D Hall sensors is installed on the return yoke blocks. A\nTOSCA 3-D model of the CMS magnet is developed to describe the magnetic field\neverywhere outside the tracking volume that was measured with the field-mapping\nmachine. The voltages induced in the flux loops by the magnetic flux changing\nduring the CMS magnet standard ramps down are measured with six 16-bit DAQ\nmodules. The off-line integration of the induced voltages reconstructs the\nmagnetic flux density in the yoke steel blocks at the operational magnet\ncurrent of 18.164 kA. The results of the flux loop measurements during three\nmagnet ramps down are presented and discussed.\n", "  We study the local optimality of Simple Cubic, Body-Centred-Cubic and\nFace-Centred-Cubic lattices among Bravais lattices of fixed density for some\nfinite energy per point. Following the work of Ennola [Math. Proc. Cambridge,\n60:855--875, 1964], we prove that these lattices are critical points of all the\nenergies, we write the second derivatives in a simple way and we investigate\nthe local optimality of these lattices for the theta function and the\nLennard-Jones-type energies. In particular, we prove the local minimality of\nthe FCC lattice (resp. BCC lattice) for large enough (resp. small enough)\nvalues of its scaling parameter and we also prove the fact that the simple\ncubic lattice is a saddle point of the energy. Furthermore, we prove the local\nminimality of the FCC and the BCC lattices at high density (with an optimal\nexplicit bound) and its local maximality at low density in the\nLennard-Jones-type potential case. We then show the local minimality of FCC and\nBCC lattices among all the Bravais lattices (without a density constraint). The\nlargest possible open interval of density's values where the Simple Cubic\nlattice is a local minimizer is also computed.\n", "  Calculating the degree of non-Markovianity of a dissipative process is a\ndifficult task, even for the dynamics of a single qubit, given the complex\nmaximization problem. In this work, focusing on the entanglement-based\nquantifier of non-Markovianity, we present an analytical solution for such an\noptimization problem. We then propose a computable non-Markovianity measure\nbased on generalized robustness of entanglement, an entanglement measure that\ncan be readily calculated by a semidefinite programming method. We show that\nthe non-Markovianity, in a given interval of time, can be witnessed by\ncalculating the expectation value of an observable, making it attractive for\nexperimental investigations.\n", "  If a device like a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) has all its four corners\nattached to electric current leads, the device becomes a quantum junction\nthrough which two electrical circuits can interact. We study such system\ntheoretically for stationary currents. The 4-point energy-dependent conductance\nmatrix of the nanostructure and the classical resistors in the circuits are\nparameters of the model. The two bias voltages in the circuits are the control\nvariables of the studied system while the electrochemical potentials at the\ndevice's terminals are non-trivially dependent on the voltages. For the special\ncase of the linear-response regime analytical formulae for the operation of the\ncoupled quantum-classical device are derived and applied. For higher bias\nvoltages numerical solutions are obtained. The effects of non-equilibrium Fermi\nlevels are captured using a recursive algorithm in which self-consistency\nbetween the electrochemical potentials and the currents is reached within few\niterations. The developed approach allows to study scenarios ranging from\nindependent circuits to strongly coupled ones. For the chosen model of the GNR\nwith highly conductive zigzag edges we determine the regime in which the single\ndevice carries two almost independent currents.\n", "  In this paper we define a quantum stochastic walk on arbitrary directed graph\nwith super-diffusive propagation on a line graph. Our model is based on global\nenvironment interaction QSW, which is known to have ballistic propagation.\nHowever we discovered, that in this case additional amplitude transitions\noccur, hence graph topology is changed into moral graph. Because of that we\ncall the effect a spontaneous moralization. We propose a general correction\nscheme, which is proved to remove unnecessary transition and thus to preserve\nthe graph topology. In the end we numerically show, that super-diffusive\npropagation is preserved. Because of that our new model may be applied as\neffective evolution on arbitrary directed graph.\n", "  Gasper & Rahman's multivariate $q$-Racah polynomials are shown to arise as\nconnection coefficients between families of multivariate $q$-Hahn or $q$-Jacobi\npolynomials. The families of $q$-Hahn polynomials are constructed as nested\nClebsch--Gordan coefficients for the positive-discrete series representations\nof the quantum algebra $su_q(1,1)$. This gives an interpretation of the\nmultivariate $q$-Racah polynomials in terms of $3nj$ symbols. It is shown that\nthe families of $q$-Hahn polynomials also arise in wavefunctions of\n$q$-deformed quantum Calogero--Gaudin superintegrable systems.\n", "  We study the problem of constructing positive representations of complex\nmeasures. In this paper we consider complex densities on a direct product of\n$U(1)$ groups and look for representations by probability distributions on the\ncomplexification of those groups. After identifying general necessary and\nsufficient conditions we propose several concrete realizations. Finally we\nstudy some of those realizations in examples representing problems in abelian\nlattice gauge theories.\n", "  We study spin transport in a boundary driven XXZ spin chain. Driving at the\nchain boundaries is modeled by two additional spin chains prepared in\noppositely polarized states. Emergent behavior, both in the transient dynamics\nand in the long-time quasi-steady state, is demonstrated. Time-dependent\nmatrix-product-state simulations of the system-bath state show ballistic spin\ntransport below the Heisenberg isotropic point. Indications of exponentially\nvanishing transport are found above the Heisenberg point for low energy initial\nstates while the current decays asymptotically as a power law for high energy\nstates. Precisely at the critical point, non-ballistic transport is observed.\nFinally, it is found that the sensitivity of the quasi-stationary state on the\ninitial state of the chain is a good witness of the different transport phases.\n", "  It is commonly accepted that states in a conformal field theory correspond to\nclassical spacetimes with Anti-de-Sitter asymptotics. In this work we give a\nprescription for the CFT states with a dual classical spacetime and, using\nbasic holographic rules, show that they are holographically connected to\ncoherent states in the large-N limit, or by considering linearized\nperturbations. We also point out implications in the spacetime emergence\nmechanism, for instance, the (entangled) state dual to the black hole should be\nproperly described as a quantum superposition of products of these states. This\nalso complements the quantum interpretation of the Hawking-Page transition.\n", "  Quantum kinetic equations of motion for the description of the exciton spin\ndynamics in II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum wells with laser\ndriving are derived. The model includes the magnetic as well as the nonmagnetic\ncarrier-impurity interaction, the Coulomb interaction, Zeeman terms, and the\nlight-matter coupling, allowing for an explicit treatment of arbitrary\nexcitation pulses. Based on a dynamics-controlled truncation scheme,\ncontributions to the equations of motion up to second order in the generating\nlaser field are taken into account. The correlations between the carrier and\nthe impurity subsystems are treated within the framework of a correlation\nexpansion. For vanishing magnetic field, the Markov limit of the quantum\nkinetic equations formulated in the exciton basis agrees with existing theories\nbased on Fermi's golden rule. For narrow quantum wells excited at the $1s$\nexciton resonance, numerical quantum kinetic simulations reveal pronounced\ndeviations from the Markovian behavior. In particular, the spin decays\ninitially with approximately half the Markovian rate and a non-monotonic decay\nin the form of an overshoot of up to $10\\,\\%$ of the initial spin polarization\nis predicted.\n", "  Background: The accurate determination of atomic final states following\nnuclear $\\beta$ decay plays an important role in many experiments. In\nparticular, the charge state distributions of ions following nuclear $\\beta$\ndecay are important for determinations of the $\\beta-\\nu$ angular correlation\nwith improved precision. Purpose: Our measurement aims at providing benchmarks\nto test theoretical calculations. Method: The kinematics of Li$^{n+}$ ions\nproduced following the $\\beta$ decay of $^6{\\rm He}$ within an electric field\nwere measured using $^6{\\rm He}$ atoms in the metastable $(1s2s,~{^3S_1})$ and\nin the $(1s2p,~{^3P_2})$ states confined by a magneto-optical trap. The\nelectron shake-off probabilities were deduced including their dependence on ion\nenergy. Results: We find significant discrepancies on the fractions of Li ions\nin the different charge states with respect to a recent calculation and discuss\na plausible explanation. We also point out that there is no explanation for a\nlarge discrepancy between the same calculation and a previous measurement of\nthe Li-ion energy dependence of the charge distribution from decays of the\nelectronic ground state.\n", "  Fully autonomous precise control of qubits is crucial for quantum information\nprocessing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing applications. It\nrequires minimal human intervention on the ability to model, to predict and to\nanticipate the quantum dynamics [1,2], as well as to precisely control and\ncalibrate single qubit operations. Here, we demonstrate single qubit autonomous\ncalibrations via closed-loop optimisations of electron spin quantum operations\nin diamond. The operations are examined by quantum state and process\ntomographic measurements at room temperature, and their performances against\nsystematic errors are iteratively rectified by an optimal pulse engineering\nalgorithm. We achieve an autonomous calibrated fidelity up to 1.00 on a time\nscale of minutes for a spin population inversion and up to 0.98 on a time scale\nof hours for a Hadamard gate within the experimental error of 2%. These results\nmanifest a full potential for versatile quantum nanotechnologies.\n", "  We show that for an infinite, uniformly charged plate no well defined\nelectric field exists in the framework of electrostatics, because it cannot be\ndefined as a mathematically consistent limit of a solution for a finite plate.\nWe discuss an infinite wire and an infinite stripe as examples of infinite\ncharge distributions for which the electric field can be determined as a limit\nin a formal, mathematical way. We also propose a didactic framework that can\nhelp students understand subtleties related to the problems of limits in\nelectrostatics. The framework consists of heuristic tools (claims) that help to\nalign intuitions in the spirit of a rigorous definition of an integral. We\nthoroughly discuss to what degree the solution for a finite plate agrees with\nthe traditional but unfortunately ill-defined solution for an infinite plate.\nPhysics is a science of approximations. One can ask why the use of\nmathematically ill-defined formulae and objects should be forbidden if they\nmake life simpler. In our opinion, approximations should have solid physical\nand mathematical foundations.\n", "  An accurate calculation of proton ranges in phantoms or detector geometries\nis crucial for decision making in proton therapy and proton imaging. To this\nend, several parameterizations of the range-energy relationship exist, with\ndifferent levels of complexity and accuracy. In this study we compare the\naccuracy four different parameterizations models: Two analytical models derived\nfrom the Bethe equation, and two different interpolation schemes applied to\nrange-energy tables. In conclusion, a spline interpolation scheme yields the\nhighest reproduction accuracy, while the shape of the energy loss-curve is best\nreproduced with the differentiated Bragg-Kleeman equation.\n", "  During 2003--2015, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) has searched for\n$a\\to\\gamma$ conversion in the 9 T magnetic field of a refurbished LHC test\nmagnet that can be directed toward the Sun. In its final phase of solar axion\nsearches (2013--2015), CAST has returned to evacuated magnet pipes, which is\noptimal for small axion masses. The absence of a significant signal above\nbackground provides a world leading limit of $g_{a\\gamma} < 0.66 \\times\n10^{-10} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ (95% C.L.) on the axion-photon coupling strength for\n$m_a \\lesssim 0.02$ eV. Compared with the first vacuum phase (2003--2004), the\nsensitivity was vastly increased with low-background x-ray detectors and a new\nx-ray telescope. These innovations also serve as pathfinders for a possible\nnext-generation axion helioscope.\n", "  We report a comprehensive analysis of the light and strange disconnected-sea\nquarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment, charge radius, and the\nelectric and magnetic form factors. The lattice QCD calculation includes\nensembles across several lattice volumes and lattice spacings with one of the\nensembles at the physical pion mass. We adopt a model-independent extrapolation\nof the nucleon magnetic moment and the charge radius. We have performed a\nsimultaneous chiral, infinite volume, and continuum extrapolation in a global\nfit to calculate results in the continuum limit. We find that the combined\nlight and strange disconnected-sea quarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic\nmoment is $\\mu_M\\,(\\text{DI})=-0.022(11)(09)\\,\\mu_N$ and to the nucleon mean\nsquare charge radius is $\\langle r^2\\rangle_E\\,\\text{(DI)}=-0.019(05)(05)$\nfm$^2$ which is about $1/3$ of the difference between the $\\langle\nr_p^2\\rangle_E$ of electron-proton scattering and that of muonic atom and so\ncannot be ignored in obtaining the proton charge radius in the lattice QCD\ncalculation. The most important outcome of this lattice QCD calculation is that\nwhile the combined light-sea and strange quarks contribution to the nucleon\nmagnetic moment is small at about $1\\%$, a negative $2.5(9)\\%$ contribution to\nthe proton mean square charge radius and a relatively larger positive\n$16.3(6.1)\\%$ contribution to the neutron mean square charge radius come from\nthe sea quarks in the nucleon. For the first time, by performing global fits,\nwe also give predictions of the light and strange disconnected-sea quarks\ncontributions to the nucleon electric and magnetic form factors at the physical\npoint and in the continuum and infinite volume limits in the momentum transfer\nrange of $0\\leq Q^2\\leq 0.5$ GeV$^2$.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of two-dimensional Dirac-Rashba systems in\nthe presence of disorder and external perturbations. We unveil a set of exact\nsymmetry relations (Ward identities) that impose strong constraints on the spin\ndynamics of Dirac fermions subject to proximity-induced interactions. This\nallows us to demonstrate that an arbitrary dilute concentration of scalar\nimpurities results in the total suppression of nonequilibrium spin Hall\ncurrents when only Rashba spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, a finite\nspin Hall conductivity is restored when the minimal Dirac-Rashba model is\nsupplemented with a spin-valley interaction. The Ward identities provide a\nsystematic way to predict the emergence of the spin Hall effect in a wider\nclass of Dirac-Rashba systems of experimental relevance and represent an\nimportant benchmark for testing the validity of numerical methodologies.\n", "  In the previous paper Ref.[1], it was claimed that the black hole can be\nconsidered as a kind of topological insulator. For BTZ black hole in three\ndimensional $AdS_3$ spacetime two evidences were given to support this claim:\nthe first evidence comes from the black hole \"membrane paradigm\", and the\nsecond evidence comes from the fact that the horizon of BTZ black hole can\nsupport two chiral massless scalar field with opposite chirality. Those are two\nkey properties of 2D topological insulator. For higher dimensional black hole\nthe first evidence is still valid but the second fails. In this paper, starting\nfrom the boundary BF theory, which can be used to describe the boundary degrees\nof freedom of black hole in arbitrary dimension, we shown that the isolated\nhorizon of $3+1-$D black hole can support massless scalar field and vector\nfield. Those two fields can be used to construct a massless Dirac field through\nthe $2+1-$dimensional bosonization, which also appears on the boundary of\n$3+1-$D topological insulators.\n", "  We explore the intermediate dark matter mass regime of the inert Higgs\ndoublet model (IHDM) by extending the model with three copies of right handed\nsinglet neutrinos. The in built discrete $Z_2$ symmetry of the model allows\nthese right handed neutrinos to couple to the usual lepton doublets through the\ninert Higgs doublet allowing the possibility of radiative neutrino mass in the\nscotogenic fashion. Apart from generating non-zero neutrino mass, such an\nextension can also revive the intermediate dark matter mass regime, between $W$\nboson mass to a few hundred GeV's where pure IHDM can not give rise to correct\ndark matter relic abundance. The late decay of the lightest right handed\nneutrino to dark matter makes it possible for the usual thermally\nunder-abundant dark matter in this intermediate mass regime to satisfy the\ncorrect relic abundance limit. The revival of this wide intermediate mass range\ncan not only have relevance for direct search experiments but also for neutrino\nexperiments as the long lifetime of the lightest right handed neutrino also\nresults in almost vanishing lightest neutrino mass.\n", "  We determine the asymptotic forms of work distributions at arbitrary times\n$T$, in a class of driven stochastic systems using a theory developed by Engel\nand Nickelsen (EN theory) (arXiv:1102.4505v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech]), which is\nbased on the contraction principle of large deviation theory. In this paper, we\nextend the theory, previously applied in the context of deterministically\ndriven systems, to a model in which the driving is stochastic. The models we\nstudy are described by overdamped Langevin equations and the work distributions\nin the path integral form, are characterised by having quadratic actions. We\nfirst illustrate EN theory, for a deterministically driven system - the\nbreathing parabola model, and show that within its framework, the Crooks\nflucutation theorem manifests itself as a reflection symmetry property of a\ncertain characteristic polynomial function. We then extend our analysis to a\nstochastically driven system, studied in ( arXiv:1212.0704v2\n[cond-mat.stat-mech], arXiv:1402.5777v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech]) using a\nmoment-generating-function method, for both equilibrium and non - equilibrium\nsteady state initial distributions. In both cases we obtain new analytic\nsolutions for the asymptotic forms of (dissipated) work distributions at\narbitrary $T$. For dissipated work in the steady state, we compare the large\n$T$ asymptotic behaviour of our solution to that already obtained in (\narXiv:1402.5777v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech]). In all cases, special emphasis is\nplaced on the computation of the pre-exponential factor and the results show\nexcellent agreement with the numerical simulations. Our solutions are exact in\nthe low noise limit.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the problem of assessing local clustering in\ncomplex networks. Various definitions for this measure have been proposed for\nthe cases of networks having weighted edges, but less attention has been paid\nto both weighted and directed networks. We provide a new local clustering\ncoefficient for this kind of networks, starting from those existing in the\nliterature for the weighted and undirected case. Furthermore, we extract from\nour coefficient four specific components, in order to separately consider\ndifferent link patterns of triangles. Empirical applications on several real\nnetworks from different frameworks and with different order are provided. The\nperformance of our coefficient is also compared with that of existing\ncoefficients in the literature.\n", "  Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry as it is\nideally suited to learn representations for structured data and speed up the\nexploration of chemical space. While convolutional neural networks have proven\nto be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules\nare not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain\nessential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we\npropose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local\ncorrelations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers\nin SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in\nmolecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces\nthat follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. This includes\nrotationally invariant energy predictions and a smooth, differentiable\npotential energy surface. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics\ntrajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical\nand structural variations that suggests the path for further work.\n", "  Thermoelectric power generation has been recognized as one of the most\nimportant technologies, and high-performance thermoelectric materials have long\nbeen pursued. However, because of the large number of candidate materials, this\nquest is extremely challenging, and it has become clear that a firm theoretical\nconcept from the viewpoint of band-structure engineering is needed. In this\nstudy, we theoretically demonstrate that pnictogen-dichalcogenide layered\ncompounds, which originally attracted attention as a family of superconductors\nand have recently been investigated as thermoelectric materials, can exhibit\nvery high thermoelectric performance with elemental substitution. In\nparticular, we clarify a promising guiding principle for materials design and\nfind that LaOAsSe$_2$, a material that has yet to be synthesized, has a\npowerfactor that is six times as large as that of the known compound LaOBiS$_2$\nand can exhibit a very large $ZT$ under some plausible assumptions. This large\nenhancement of the thermoelectric performance originates from the\nquasi-one-dimensional gapped Dirac-like band dispersion, which is realized by\nthe square-lattice network. Our study offers one ideal limit of the band\nstructure for thermoelectric materials. Because our target materials have high\ncontrollability of constituent elements and feasibility of carrier doping,\nexperimental studies along this line are strongly awaited.\n", "  The Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature data are best fit\nwith a LCDM model that is in mild tension with constraints from other\ncosmological probes. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) 2540 $\\text{deg}^2$ SPT-SZ\nsurvey offers measurements on sub-degree angular scales (multipoles $650 \\leq\n\\ell \\leq 2500$) with sufficient precision to use as an independent check of\nthe Planck data. Here we build on the recent joint analysis of the SPT-SZ and\nPlanck data in \\citet{hou17} by comparing LCDM parameter estimates using the\ntemperature power spectrum from both data sets in the SPT-SZ survey region. We\nalso restrict the multipole range used in parameter fitting to focus on modes\nmeasured well by both SPT and Planck, thereby greatly reducing sample variance\nas a driver of parameter differences and creating a stringent test for\nsystematic errors. We find no evidence of systematic errors from such tests.\nWhen we expand the maximum multipole of SPT data used, we see low-significance\nshifts in the angular scale of the sound horizon and the physical baryon and\ncold dark matter densities, with a resulting trend to higher Hubble constant.\nWhen we compare SPT and Planck data on the SPT-SZ sky patch to Planck full-sky\ndata but keep the multipole range restricted, we find differences in the\nparameters $n_s$ and $A_se^{-2\\tau}$. We perform further checks, investigating\ninstrumental effects and modeling assumptions, and we find no evidence that the\neffects investigated are responsible for any of the parameter shifts. Taken\ntogether, these tests reveal no evidence for systematic errors in SPT or Planck\ndata in the overlapping sky coverage and multipole range and, at most, weak\nevidence for a breakdown of LCDM or systematic errors influencing either the\nPlanck data outside the SPT-SZ survey area or the SPT data at $\\ell >2000$.\n", "  We report on the magnetic properties of monovacancy defects in\nneutron-irradiated graphite, probed by $^{13}$C nuclear magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy. The bulk paramagnetism of the defect moments is revealed by the\ntemperature dependence of the NMR frequency shift and spectral linewidth, both\nof which follow a Curie behavior, in agreement with measurements of the\nmacroscopic magnetization. Compared to pristine graphite, the fluctuating\nhyperfine fields generated by the defect moments lead to an enhancement of the\n$^{13}$C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$ by about two orders of\nmagnitude. With an applied magnetic field of 7.1 T, the temperature dependence\nof $1/T_{1}$ below about 10 K can well be described by a thermally activated\nform, $1/T_{1}\\propto\\exp(-\\Delta/k_{B}T)$, yielding a singular Zeeman energy\nof ($0.41\\pm0.01$) meV, in excellent agreement with the sole presence of\npolarized, non-interacting defect moments.\n", "  By using magnetization and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)\nmeasurements, we have investigated the magnetic behavior of Mn_{1-x}Ir_{x}Si\nsystem to explore the effect of increased carrier density and spin-orbit\ninteraction on the magnetic properties of MnSi. We determine estimates of the\nspin wave stiffness and the Dzyalloshinski-Moria, DM, interaction strength and\ncompare with Mn_{1-x}Co_{x}Si and Mn_{1-x}Fe_{x}Si. Despite the large\ndifferences in atomic mass and size of the substituted elements,\nMn_{1-x}Co_{x}Si and Mn_{1-x}Ir_{x}Si show nearly identical variations in their\nmagnetic properties with substitution. We find a systematic dependence of the\ntransition temperature, the ordered moment, the helix period and the DM\ninteraction strength with electron count for Mn{1-x}Ir{x}Si, Mn_{1-x}Co_{x}Si,\nand Mn_{1-x}Fe_{x}Si indicating that the magnetic behavior is primarily\ndependent upon the additional carrier density rather than on the mass or size\nof the substituting species. This indicates that the variation in magnetic\nproperties, including the DM interaction strength, are primarily controlled by\nthe electronic structure as Co and Ir are isovalent. Our work suggests that\nalthough the rigid band model of electronic structure along with Moira's model\nof weak itinerant magnetism describe this system surprisingly well,\nphenomenological models for the DM interaction strength are not adequate to\ndescribe this system.\n", "  Coulomb branches of a set of $3d\\ \\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge\ntheories are closures of nilpotent orbits of the algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(n)$.\nFrom the point of view of string theory, these quantum field theories can be\nunderstood as effective gauge theories describing the low energy dynamics of a\nbrane configuration with the presence of orientifold planes. The presence of\nthe orientifold planes raises the question to whether the orthogonal factors of\na the gauge group are indeed orthogonal $O(N)$ or special orthogonal $SO(N)$.\nIn order to investigate this problem, we compute the Hilbert series for the\nCoulomb branch of $T^\\sigma(SO(n)^\\vee)$ theories, utilizing the monopole\nformula. The results for all nilpotent orbits from $\\mathfrak {so} (3)$ to\n$\\mathfrak{so}(10)$ which are special and normal are presented. A new\nrelationship between the choice of $SO/O(N)$ factors in the gauge group and the\nLusztig's Canonical Quotient of the corresponding nilpotent orbit is observed.\nWe also provide a new way of projecting several magnetic lattices of different\n$SO(N)$ gauge group factors by the simultaneous action of a $\\mathbb Z_2$\ngroup.\n", "  We study many-body localization in a one dimensional optical lattice filled\nwith bosons. The interaction between bosons is assumed to be random, which can\nbe realized for atoms close to a microchip exposed to a spatially fluctuating\nmagnetic field. Close to a Feshbach resonance, such controlled fluctuations can\nbe transfered to the interaction strength. We show that the system reveals an\ninverted mobility edge, with mobile particles at the lower edge of the\nspectrum. A statistical analysis of level spacings allows us to characterize\nthe transition between localized and excited states. The existence of the\nmobility edge is confirmed in large systems, by time dependent numerical\nsimulations using tDMRG. A simple analytical model predicts the long time\nbehavior of the system.\n", "  We propose a minimal supersymmetric Twin Higgs model that can accommodate\ntuning of the electroweak scale for heavy stops better than 10% with high\nmediation scales of supersymmetry breaking. A crucial ingredient of this model\nis a new SU(2)_X gauge symmetry which provides a D-term potential that\ngenerates a large SU(4) invariant coupling for the Higgs sector and only small\nset of particles charged under SU(2)_X, which allows the model to be\nperturbative around the Planck scale. The new gauge interaction drives the top\nyukawa coupling small at higher energy scales, which also reduces the tuning.\n", "  We introduce simulations aimed at assessing how well weak gravitational\nlensing of 21cm radiation from the Epoch of Reionization ($z \\sim 8$) can be\nmeasured by an SKA-like radio telescope. A simulation pipeline has been\nimplemented to study the performance of lensing reconstruction techniques. We\nshow how well the lensing signal can be reconstructed using the\nthree-dimensional quadratic lensing estimator in Fourier space assuming\ndifferent survey strategies. The numerical code introduced in this work is\ncapable of dealing with issues that can not be treated analytically such as the\ndiscreteness of visibility measurements and the inclusion of a realistic model\nfor the antennae distribution. This paves the way for future numerical studies\nimplementing more realistic reionization models, foreground subtraction\nschemes, and testing the performance of lensing estimators that take into\naccount the non-Gaussian distribution of HI after reionization. If multiple\nfrequency channels covering $z \\sim 7-11.6$ are combined, Phase 1 of SKA-Low\nshould be able to obtain good quality images of the lensing potential with a\ntotal resolution of $\\sim 1.6$ arcmin. The SKA-Low Phase 2 should be capable of\nproviding images with high-fidelity even using data from $z\\sim 7.7 - 8.3$. We\nperform tests aimed at evaluating the numerical implementation of the mapping\nreconstruction. We also discuss the possibility of measuring an accurate\nlensing power spectrum. Combining data from $z \\sim 7-11.6$ using the SKA2-Low\ntelescope model, we find constraints comparable to sample variance in the range\n$L<1000$, even for survey areas as small as $25\\mbox{ deg}^2$.\n", "  Plasmon coupling and hybridization in complex nanostructures constitutes a\nfertile playground for controlling light at the nanoscale. Here, we present a\nsemi-analytical model to describe the emergence of hybrid plasmon modes guided\nalong 2D nano-slits. In particular, we find two new coupled plasmonic\nresonances arising from symmetric and antisymmetric hybridizations of the edge\nplasmons of the constituent half-sheets. These give rise to an antibonding and\na bonding mode, lying above and below the energy of the bare edge plasmon. Our\ntreatment is notably generic, being able to account for slits of arbitrary\nwidth, and remains valid irrespective of the 2D conductive material (e.g.,\ndoped graphene, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, or phosphorene). We derive\nthe dispersion relation of the hybrid modes of a 2D nano-slit along with the\ncorresponding induced potential and electric field distributions. We also\ndiscuss the plasmonic spectrum of a 2D slit together with the one from its\ncomplementarity structure, that is, a ribbon. Finally, the case of a nano-slit\nmade from an anisotropic 2D material is considered. Focusing on black\nphosphorus (which is highly anisotropic), we investigate the features of its\nplasmonic spectrum along the two main crystal axes. Our results offer insights\ninto the interaction of plasmons in complex 2D nanostructures, thereby\nexpanding the current toolkit of plasmonic resonances in 2D materials, and\npaving the way for the emergence of future compact devices based on atomically\nthin plasmonics.\n", "  In this work we review the theory of the spherical collapse model and\ncritically analyse the aspects of the numerical implementation of its\nfundamental equations. By extending a recent work by Herrera et al. 2017, we\nshow how different aspects, such as the initial integration time, the\ndefinition of constant infinity and the criterion for the extrapolation method\n(how close the inverse of the overdensity has to be to zero at the collapse\ntime) can lead to an erroneous estimation (a few per mill error which\ntranslates to a few percent in the mass function) of the key quantity in the\nspherical collapse model: the linear critical overdensity $\\delta_{\\rm c}$,\nwhich plays a crucial role for the mass function of halos. We provide a better\nrecipe to adopt in designing a code suitable to a generic smooth dark energy\nmodel and we compare our numerical results with analytic predictions for the\nEdS and the $\\Lambda$CDM models. We further discuss the evolution of\n$\\delta_{\\rm c}$ for selected classes of dark energy models as a general test\nof the robustness of our implementation. We finally outline which modifications\nneed to be taken into account to extend the code to more general classes of\nmodels, such as clustering dark energy models and non-minimally coupled models.\n", "  We derive expressions for the total Hamiltonian energy of gravitating systems\nin higher dimensional theories in terms of the Riemann tensor, allowing a\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Our analysis covers\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, asymptotically flat spacetimes, as\nwell as Kaluza-Klein asymptotically flat spacetimes. We show that the Komar\nmass equals the ADM mass in asymptotically flat space-times in all dimensions,\ngeneralising the four-dimensional result of Beig, and that this is not true\nanymore with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics. We show that the Hamiltonian mass does\nnot necessarily coincide with the ADM mass in Kaluza-Klein asymptotically flat\nspace-times, and that the Witten positivity argument provides a lower bound for\nthe Hamiltonian mass, and not for the ADM mass, in terms of the electric\ncharge. We illustrate our results on the Rasheed Kaluza-Klein vacuum metrics,\nwhich we study in some detail, pointing out restrictions that arise from the\nrequirement of regularity, seemingly unnoticed so far in the literature.\n", "  We have systematically investigated the spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ to\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ doubly charmed baryon transition magnetic moments to the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory\n(HBChPT). Numerical results of transition magnetic moments and decay widths are\npresented to the next-to-leading order:\n$\\mu_{\\Xi_{cc}^{*++}\\rightarrow\\Xi_{cc}^{++}}=-2.35\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\mu_{\\Xi_{cc}^{*+}\\rightarrow\\Xi_{cc}^{+}}=1.55\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\mu_{\\Omega_{cc}^{*+}\\rightarrow\\Omega_{cc}^{+}}=1.54\\mu_{N}$,\n$\\Gamma_{\\Xi_{cc}^{*++}\\rightarrow\\Xi_{cc}^{++}}=22.0$ keV,\n$\\Gamma_{\\Xi_{cc}^{*+}\\rightarrow\\Xi_{cc}^{+}}=9.57$ keV,\n$\\Gamma_{\\Omega_{cc}^{*+}\\rightarrow\\Omega_{cc}^{+}}=9.45$ keV.\n", "  We prove the following theorem: axisymmetric, stationary solutions of the\nEinstein field equations formed from classical gravitational collapse of matter\nobeying the null energy condition, that are everywhere smooth and ultracompact\n(i.e., they have a light ring) must have at least two light rings, and one of\nthem is stable. It has been argued that stable light rings generally lead to\nnonlinear spacetime instabilities. Our result implies that smooth, physically\nand dynamically reasonable ultracompact objects are not viable as observational\nalternatives to black holes whenever these instabilities occur on\nastrophysically short time scales. The proof of the theorem has two parts: (i)\nWe show that light rings always come in pairs, one being a saddle point and the\nother a local extremum of an effective potential. This result follows from a\ntopological argument based on the Brouwer degree of a continuous map, with no\nassumptions on the spacetime dynamics, and hence it is applicable to any metric\ngravity theory where photons follow null geodesics. (ii) Assuming Einstein's\nequations, we show that the extremum is a local minimum of the potential (i.e.,\na stable light ring) if the energy-momentum tensor satisfies the null energy\ncondition.\n", "  We compute the tensor and scalar spectral index $n_t$, $n_s$, the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, the consistency relation $n_t/r$ in the general\nmonomial multifield slow-roll inflation models with potentials $V\n\\sim\\sum_i\\lambda_i \\left|\\phi_i\\right|^{p_i}$. The general models give a novel\nrelation that $n_t$, $n_s$ and $n_t/r$ are all proportional to the logarithm of\nthe number of fields $N_f$ when $N_f$ is getting extremely large with the order\nof magnitude around $\\mathcal{O}(10^{40})$. An upper bound $N_f\\lesssim\nN_*e^{ZN_*}$ is given by requiring the slow variation parameter small enough\nwhere $N_*$ is the e-folding number and $Z$ is a function of distributions of\n$\\lambda_i$ and $p_i$. Besides, $n_t/r$ differs from the single-field result\n$-1/8$ with substantial probability except for a few very special cases.\nFinally, we derive theoretical bounds $r>2/N_*$ ($r\\gtrsim0.03$) and for $n_t$\nwhich can be tested by observation in the near future.\n", "  The existence and properties of low Mach-number ($M \\gtrsim 1$) electrostatic\ncollisionless shocks are investigated with a semi-analytical solution for the\nshock structure. We show that the properties of the shock obtained in the\nsemi-analytical model can be well reproduced in fully kinetic Eulerian\nVlasov-Poisson simulations, where the shock is generated by the decay of an\ninitial density discontinuity. Using this semi-analytical model, we study the\neffect of electron-to-ion temperature ratio and presence of impurities on both\nthe maximum shock potential and Mach number. We find that even a small amount\nof impurities can influence the shock properties significantly, including the\nreflected light ion fraction, which can change several orders of magnitude.\nElectrostatic shocks in heavy ion plasmas reflect most of the hydrogen impurity\nions.\n", "  We perform Feshbach spectroscopy in an ultracold mixture of $^{23}$Na and\n$^{40}$K with different spin-state combinations. We have observed 24 new\ninterspecies Feshbach resonances at magnetic field up to 350 G. A full\ncoupled-channel calculation is performed to assign these resonances. Among\nthem, 12 resonances are identified as d-wave Feshbach resonances. These d-wave\nFeshbach resonances are about 5 G systematically smaller than the predications\nbased on previous model potential. Taking into account these new experimental\nresults, we improve the Born-Oppenheimer potentials between Na and K, and\nachieve good agreement between the theory and experiment for all the observed\nFeshbach resonances.\n", "  The existing molecular relaxation models based on both parallel relaxation\ntheory and series relaxation theory cannot extract the contributions of gas\ncompositions to acoustic relaxation absorption in mixtures. In this paper, we\npropose an analytical model to predict acoustic relaxation absorption and\nclarify composition relaxation contributions based on the rate-determining\nenergy transfer processes in molecular relaxation in excitable gases. By\ncombining parallel and series relaxation theory, the proposed model suggests\nthat the vibration-translation process of the lowest vibrational mode in each\ncomposition provides the primary deexcitation path of the relaxation energy,\nand the rate-determining vibration-vibration processes between the lowest mode\nand others dominate the coupling energy transfer between different modes. Thus,\neach gas composition contributes directly one single relaxation process to the\nmolecular relaxation in mixture, which can be illustrated by the decomposed\nacoustic relaxation absorption spectrum of the single relaxation process. The\nproposed model is validated by simulation results in good agreement with\nexperimental data such as $\\mathrm{N_2}$, $\\mathrm{O_2}$, $\\mathrm{CO_2}$,\n$\\mathrm{CH_4}$ and their mixtures.\n", "  Statistical mechanics is founded on the assumption that a system can reach\nthermal equilibrium, regardless of the starting state. Interactions between\nparticles facilitate thermalization, but, can interacting systems always\nequilibrate regardless of parameter values\\,? The energy spectrum of a system\ncan answer this question and reveal the nature of the underlying phases.\nHowever, most experimental techniques only indirectly probe the many-body\nenergy spectrum. Using a chain of nine superconducting qubits, we implement a\nnovel technique for directly resolving the energy levels of interacting\nphotons. We benchmark this method by capturing the intricate energy spectrum\npredicted for 2D electrons in a magnetic field, the Hofstadter butterfly. By\nincreasing disorder, the spatial extent of energy eigenstates at the edge of\nthe energy band shrink, suggesting the formation of a mobility edge. At strong\ndisorder, the energy levels cease to repel one another and their statistics\napproaches a Poisson distribution - the hallmark of transition from the\nthermalized to the many-body localized phase. Our work introduces a new\nmany-body spectroscopy technique to study quantum phases of matter.\n", "  We formulate a numerical method for predicting the tensorial linear response\nof a rigid, asymmetrically charged body to an applied electric field. This\nprediction requires calculating the response of the fluid to the Stokes drag\nforces on the moving body and on the countercharges near its surface. To\ndetermine the fluid's motion, we represent both the body and the countercharges\nusing many point sources of drag known as stokeslets. Finding the correct flow\nfield amounts to finding the set of drag forces on the stokeslets that is\nconsistent with the relative velocities experienced by each stokeslet. The\nmethod rigorously satisfies the condition that the object moves with no\ntransfer of momentum to the fluid. We demonstrate that a sphere represented by\n1999 well-separated stokeslets on its surface produces flow and drag force like\na solid sphere to one-percent accuracy. We show that a uniformly-charged sphere\nwith 3998 body and countercharge stokeslets obeys the Smoluchowski prediction\n\\cite{Morrison} for electrophoretic mobility when the countercharges lie close\nto the sphere. Spheres with dipolar and quadrupolar charge distributions rotate\nand translate as predicted analytically to four percent accuracy or better. We\ndescribe how the method can treat general asymmetric shapes and charge\ndistributions. This method offers promise as a way to characterize and\nmanipulate asymmetrically charged colloid-scale objects from biology (e.g.\nviruses) and technology (e.g. self-assembled clusters).\n", "  We study the effect of common noise on coupled active rotators. While such a\nnoise always facilitates synchrony, coupling may be attractive or repulsing. We\ndevelop an analytical approach based on a transformation to approximate\nangle-action variables and averaging over fast rotations. For identical\nrotators, we describe a transition from full to partial synchrony at a critical\nvalue of repulsive coupling. For nonidentical rotators, the most nontrivial\neffect occurs at moderate repulsive coupling, where a juxtaposition of phase\nlocking with frequency repulsion (anti-entrainment) is observed. We show that\nthe frequency repulsion obeys a nontrivial power law.\n", "  In LIGO's O1 and O2 observational runs, the detectors were sensitive to\nstellar mass binary black hole coalescences with component masses up to\n$100\\,M_\\odot$, with binaries with primary masses above $40\\,M_\\odot$\nrepresenting $\\gtrsim90\\%$ of the total accessible sensitive volume.\nNonetheless, of the 5.9 detections (GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, GW170104,\nGW170608, GW170814) reported by LIGO-Virgo, the most massive binary detected\nwas GW150914 with a primary component mass of $\\sim36\\,M_\\odot$, far below the\ndetection mass limit. Furthermore, there are theoretical arguments in favor of\nan upper mass gap, predicting an absence of black holes in the mass range\n$50\\lesssim M\\lesssim135\\,M_\\odot$. We argue that the absence of detected\nbinary systems with component masses heavier than $\\sim40\\,M_\\odot$ may be\npreliminary evidence for this upper mass gap. By allowing for the presence of a\nmass gap, we find weaker constraints on the shape of the underlying mass\ndistribution of binary black holes. We fit a power-law distribution with an\nupper mass cutoff to real and simulated BBH mass measurements, finding that the\nfirst 3.9 BBHs favor shallow power law slopes $\\alpha \\lesssim 3$ and an upper\nmass cutoff $M_\\mathrm{max} \\sim 40\\,M_\\odot$. This inferred distribution is\nentirely consistent with the two recently reported detections, GW170608 and\nGW170814. We show that with $\\sim10$ additional LIGO-Virgo BBH detections,\nfitting the BH mass distribution will provide strong evidence for an upper mass\ngap if one exists.\n", "  This paper presents a triangular lattice photonic crystal fiber with very\nhigh nonlinear coefficient. Finite element method (FEM) is used to scrutinize\ndifferent optical properties of proposed highly nonlinear photonic crystal\nfiber (HNL-PCF). The HNL-PCF exhibits a high nonlinearity up to $10\\times10^{4}\nW^{-1}km^{-1}$ over the wavelength of 1500 nm to 1700 nm. Moreover, proposed\nHNL-PCF shows a very low confinement loss of $10^{-3} dB/km$ at 1550 nm\nwavelength. Furthermore, chromatic dispersion, dispersion slope, effective area\netc. are also analyzed thoroughly. The proposed fiber will be a suitable\ncandidate for broadband dispersion compensation, sensor devices and\nsupercontinuum generation.\n", "  Quasi-two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) exhibit dramatic\nproperties that may transform electronic and photonic devices. We report on how\nthe anomalously large magnetoresistance (MR) observed under high magnetic field\nin MoTe$_2$, a type II Weyl semimetal, can be reversibly controlled under\ntensile strain. The MR is enhanced by as much as ~ 30 % at low temperatures and\nhigh magnetic fields, when uniaxial strain is applied along the\n$a$-crystallographic direction and reduced by about the same amount when strain\nis applied along the $b$-direction. We show that the large in-plane electric\nanisotropy is coupled with the structural transition from the 1T' monoclinic to\nthe Td orthorhombic Weyl phase. A shift of the Td - 1T' phase boundary is\nachieved by minimal tensile strain. The sensitivity of the MR to tensile strain\nsuggests the possibility of a nontrivial spin-orbital texture of the electron\nand hole pockets in the vicinity of Weyl points. Our ab initio calculations\nindeed show a significant orbital mixing on the Fermi surface, which is\nmodified by the tensile strains.\n", "  Novel triangular lattice photonic crystal fiber with a very large negative\nflattened dispersion over the S+C+L band, and very high birefringence is\noffered here. To investigate different optical properties of the proposed\nfiber, finite element method (FEM) is deployed. The fiber presents a flattened\nnegative dispersion of $-698.5\\pm 5 ps/(nm-km)$ over the wavelength of $1440\nnm$ to $1600 nm$. Besides, the proposed photonic crystal fiber (PCF) exhibits a\nhigh birefringence of $1.886\\times10^{-2}$ at the wavelength of $1550 nm$.\nFurthermore, the nonlinearity, single modeness, effective area etc. of the\nproposed PCF are thoroughly discussed. The fiber would have important\napplications in broadband residual dispersion compensation as well as\npolarization maintaining applications.\n", "  We show that in scalar-field cosmology, a dust fluid follows as quantum\ncorrections from solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation generated by Lie\nsymmetries. The energy density of the dust fluid is related with the frequency\nof the wavefunction.\n", "  In this paper, a central-moment-based lattice Boltzmann (CLB) method for\nincompressible thermal flows is proposed. In the method, the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations and the convection-diffusion equation for the\ntemperature field are sloved separately by two different CLB equations. Through\nthe Chapman-Enskog analysis, the macroscopic governing equations for\nincompressible thermal flows can be reproduced. For the flow field, the tedious\nimplementation for CLB method is simplified by using the shift matrix with a\nsimplified central-moment set, and the consistent forcing scheme is adopted to\nincorporate forcing effects. Compared with several D2Q5\nmultiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann methods for the temperature\nequation, the proposed method is shown to be better Galilean invariant through\nmeasuring the thermal diffusivities on a moving reference frame. Thus a higher\nMach number can be used for convection flows, which decreases the computational\nload significantly. Numerical simulations for several typical problems confirm\nthe accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the present method. The grid\nconvergence tests indicate that the proposed CLB method for incompressible\nthermal flows is of second-order accuracy in space.\n", "  We introduce the SPlit-and-conQueR (SPQR) model, a coarse-grained\nrepresentation of RNA designed for structure prediction and refinement. In our\napproach, the representation of a nucleotide consists of a point particle for\nthe phosphate group and an anisotropic particle for the nucleoside. The\ninteractions are, in principle, knowledge-based potentials inspired by the\nESCORE function, a base-centered scoring function. However, a special treatment\nis given to base-pairing interactions and certain geometrical conformations\nwhich are lost in a raw knowledge-base model. This results in a representation\nable to describe planar canonical and non-canonical base pairs and\nbase-phosphate interactions and to distinguish sugar puckers and glycosidic\ntorsion conformations. The model is applied to the folding of several\nstructures, including duplexes with internal loops of non-canonical base pairs,\ntetraloops, junctions and a pseudoknot. For the majority of these systems,\nexperimental structures are correctly predicted at the level of individual\ncontacts. We also propose a method for efficiently reintroducing atomistic\ndetail from the coarse-grained representation.\n", "  We report preliminary results of the analysis of the proper motion of the\nbright radio pulsar B1727$-$47. Using archival Parkes timing data, as well as\noriginal and archival ATCA interferometry observations, we, for the first time,\nconstrain the pulsar proper motion at the level of 148$\\pm$11 mas yr$^{-1}$.\nThe backward extrapolation of the proper motion vector to the pulsar birth\nepoch points at the center of the Galactic supernova remnant RCW 114 suggesting\nthe genuine association between the two objects. We discuss the implications of\nthe association and argue that the distance to the system is less than $1$ kpc.\nThis value is at least two times lower than the dispersion measure distance\nestimates. This suggests that the existing Galaxy electron density models are\nincomplete in the direction to the pulsar.\n", "  The theories of field electron emission from perfectly planar and smooth\ncanonical surfaces are well understood, but they are not suitable for\ndescribing emission from rough, irregular surfaces arising in modern nanoscale\nelectron sources. Moreover, the existing models rely on Sommerfeld's\nfree-electron theory for the description of electronic distribution which is\nnot a valid assumption for modern materials with nonparabolic energy\ndispersion. In this paper, we derive analytically a generalized Fowler-Nordheim\n(FN) type equation that takes into account the reduced space-dimensionality\nseen by the quantum mechanically tunneling electron at a rough, irregular\nemission surface. We also consider the effects of non-parabolic energy\ndispersion on field-emission from narrow-gap semiconductors and few-layer\ngraphene using Kane's band model. The traditional FN equation is shown to be a\nlimiting case of our model in the limit of a perfectly flat surface of a\nmaterial with parabolic dispersion. The fractional-dimension parameter used in\nthis model can be experimentally calculated from appropriate current-voltage\ndata plot. By applying this model to experimental data, the standard\nfield-emission parameters can be deduced with better accuracy than by using the\nconventional FN equation.\n", "  We provide a security analysis of continuous-variable quantum key\ndistribution (CVQKD) with discrete modulation against general attacks in a\nrealistic finite-size regime. To realize this goal, we first prove security of\nthe continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol with discrete\nmodulation against collective attacks by using the reliable tomography of the\ncovariance matrix, leading to the reliable and tight error bounds in the\nderived confidence regions. Combining the proof with de Finetti reduction, the\ndiscrete-modulation-based continuous-variable quantum key distribution\n(DM-CVQKD) is proved to be secure even exposing to general attacks. Specially,\nwe use an energy test to truncate the Hilbert space globally to provide\nsecurity.\n", "  Associated varieties of vertex algebras are analogue of the associated\nvarieties of primitive ideals of the universal enveloping algebras of\nsemisimple Lie algebras. They not only capture some of the important properties\nof vertex algebras but also have interesting relationship with the Higgs\nbranches of four-dimensional $N=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs). As a\nconsequence, one can deduce the modular invariance of Schur indices of 4d $N=2$\nSCFTs from the theory of vertex algebras.\n", "  We consider a spin belonging to a many body system in a magnetically ordered\nphase, which initial state is a symmetry broken ground state. We assume that in\nthis system a sudden quench of the Hamiltonian induces an evolution. We show\nthat the long time behavior of the spin state, can be approximated by the one\nof an open two level system in which the evolution preserves all the symmetries\nof the Hamiltonian. Exploiting such a result we analyze the geometric phase\nassociated with the evolution of the single spin state and we prove\nanalytically that its long time behavior depends on the physical phase realized\nafter the quench. When the system arrives in a paramagnetic phase, the\ngeometric phase shows a periodic behavior that is absent in the case in which\nthe system remains in the initial ordered phase. Such a difference also\nsurvives in finite size systems until boundary effects come into play. We also\ndiscuss the effects of a explicit violation of the parity symmetry of the\nHamiltonian and possible applications to the problem of the entanglement\nthermalization.\n", "  A systematic study is conducted on the fluorination-enriched essential\nproperties of 2D graphene and 1D graphene nanoribbons using the\nfirst-principles method. The combined effects, which arise from the significant\nchemical bonds in C-C, F-C and F-F bonds, the finite-size quantum confinement,\nand the edge structure, can greatly diversify geometric structures, electronic\nproperties and magnetic configurations. By the detailed analyses, the critical\norbital hybridizations in determining the essential properties are accurately\nidentified from the atom-dominated energy bands, the spatial charge\ndistributions, and the orbital-projected density of states. The top-site F-C\nbonds, with the multi-orbital hybridizations, create the non-uniform buckled\nhoneycomb lattice. There exist the C-, F- and (C, F)-dominated energy bands.\nFluorinated graphene belongs either to the p-type metals (with/without the\nferromagnetic spin arrangement) or to the large-gap semiconductors (without\nmagnetism), depending on the concentration and distribution of adatoms.\nSpecially, fluorinated graphene nanoribbons, with armchair/zigzag edge,\npresents five kinds of spin-dependent properties, covering the non-magnetic and\nferromagnetic metals, non-magnetic semiconductors, and anti-ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors with/without the spin splitting. The various band-edge states in\n2D and 1D systems appear as the rich and unique structures in density of\nstates. Part of theoretical predictions are consistent with the experimental\nmeasurements, and the others are worthy of the further examinations. Also, the\nfluorination-created diverse properties clearly indicate the high potentials in\nvarious applications that will be discussed in detail, e.g., electronic and\nspintronic nanodevices.\n", "  This contribution to the volume \"From My Vast Repertoire - The Legacy of\nGuido Altarelli\" discusses the state of our knowledge of the strong coupling.\n", "  For the incompressible and the isentropic compressible Euler equations in\narbitrary space dimension, we establish the principle of localised relative\nenergy, thus generalising the well-known relative energy method. To this end,\nwe adapt classical arguments of C. Dafermos to the Euler equations. We give\nseveral applications to the behaviour of weak solutions, like local weak-strong\nuniqueness, local preservation of smoothness, and finite speed of propagation\nfor the isentropic system.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the history of relationalism and its present use\nin some interpretations of quantum mechanics. In the first part of this article\nwe will provide a conceptual analysis of the relation between substantivalism,\nrelationalism and relativism in the history of both physics and philosophy. In\nthe second part, we will address some relational interpretations of quantum\nmechanics, namely, Bohr's relational approach, the modal interpretation by\nKochen, the perspectival modal version by Bene and Dieks and the relational\ninterpretation by Rovelli. We will argue that all these interpretations ground\ntheir understanding of relations in epistemological terms. By taking into\naccount the analysis on the first part of our work, we intend to highlight the\nfact that there is a different possibility for understanding quantum mechanics\nin relational terms which has not been yet considered within the foundational\nliterature. This possibility is to consider relations in (non-relativist)\nontological terms. We will argue that such an understanding might be capable of\nproviding a novel approach to the problem of representing what quantum\nmechanics is really talking about.\n", "  Synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators is known to be largely\ndetermined by the spectral and symmetry properties of the interaction network.\nHere we leverage this relation to study a class of networks for which the\nthreshold coupling strength for global synchronization is the lowest among all\nnetworks with the same number of nodes and links. These networks, defined as\nbeing uniform, complete, and multi-partite (UCM), appear at each of an infinite\nsequence of network-complement transitions in a larger class of networks\ncharacterized by having near-optimal thresholds for global synchronization. We\nshow that the distinct symmetry structure of the UCM networks, which by design\nare optimized for global synchronizability, often leads to formation of\nclusters of synchronous oscillators, and that such states can coexist with the\nstate of global synchronization.\n", "  As a dedicated solar radio interferometer, the MingantU SpEctral\nRadioHeliograph (MUSER) generates massive observational data in the frequency\nrange of 400 MHz -- 15 GHz. High-performance imaging forms a significantly\nimportant aspect of MUSER's massive data processing requirements. In this\nstudy, we implement a practical high-performance imaging pipeline for MUSER\ndata processing. At first, the specifications of the MUSER are introduced and\nits imaging requirements are analyzed. Referring to the most commonly used\nradio astronomy software such as CASA and MIRIAD, we then implement a\nhigh-performance imaging pipeline based on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)\ntechnology with respect to the current operational status of the MUSER. A\nseries of critical algorithms and their pseudo codes, i.e., detection of the\nsolar disk and sky brightness, automatic centering of the solar disk and\nestimation of the number of iterations for clean algorithms, are proposed in\ndetail. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the proposed imaging\napproach significantly increases the processing performance of MUSER and\ngenerates images with high-quality, which can meet the requirements of the\nMUSER data processing.\n", "  $\\textit{Swift}$'s rapid slewing, flexible planning, and multi-wavelength\ninstruments make it the most capable space-based follow-up engine for finding\npoorly localized sources. During O1 and O2 $\\textit{Swift}$ successfully tiled\nhundreds of square-degrees of sky in the LVC localization regions, searching\nfor, and identifying, possible X-ray and UV/O transients in the field.\n$\\textit{Swift}$ made important contributions to the discovery and\ncharacterization of the kilonova AT 2017gfo, discovering the UV emission and\nproviding the deepest X-ray upper limits in the first 24 hours after the\ntrigger, strongly constraining the dynamics and geometry of the counterpart.\n$\\textit{Swift}$ tiled 92% of the galaxy convolved error region down to average\nX-ray flux sensitivities of $10^{-12}$ erg $\\mbox{cm}^{-2}$ $\\mbox{s}^{-1}$,\nsignificantly increasing our confidence that AT 2017gfo is indeed the\ncounterpart to GW 170817 and sGRB 170817. However, there remains significant\nroom for improvement of $\\textit{Swift}$'s follow-up in preparation for O3.\nThis will take the form of both revised observation strategy based on detailed\nanalysis of the results from O2, and significant changes to $\\textit{Swift}$'s\noperational capabilities. These improvements are necessary both for maximizing\nthe likelihood that $\\textit{Swift}$ finds a counterpart, and minimizing the\nimpact that follow-up activities have on other $\\textit{Swift}$ science\npriorities. We outline areas of improvement to the observing strategy itself\nfor optimal tiling of the LVC localization regions. We also discuss ongoing\nwork on operational upgrades that will decrease latency in our response time,\nand minimize impact on pre-planned observations, while maintaining spacecraft\nhealth and safety.\n", "  Josephson junctions operated in the dynamical Coulomb blockade regime\nrecently gained an significant amount of attention as central building block in\nconcepts to demonstrate the non-Abelian character of Majorana fermions. Its\nphysical properties are strongly affected by the intimate interplay of\nintrinsic quantum fluctuations and environmentally-induced quantum fluctuations\neach of which promoting different Cooper pair transport mechanisms at small\nvoltages around zero. To shed light on the detailed transport mechanisms\noccurring in this type of junction, we performed voltage-biased measurements on\nthe small-capacitance Josephson junction of a scanning tunneling microscope at\nmilli-Kelvin temperatures. The low voltage-regime of experimental\ncurrent-voltage characteristics can be modeled by the two complementary\ndescriptions of phase coherent and incoherent Cooper pair transport, signaling\nthe occurrence of qualitatively different transport mechanisms. This\nobservation receives further support from analyzing the calculated Fano factor\nof the current noise as a probe for correlations in Cooper pair transport,\nfollowing a theoretical proposal. Together our experimental observations and\nrelated data analysis provide a clear signature of coherent Cooper pair\ntransport along with the absence of perfect charge quantized transport around\nzero voltage, as well as of incoherent Cooper pair transport towards higher\nvoltages.\n", "  We discuss and briefly overview recent progress with studying fluctuations in\nscattering on a resonance state coupled to the background of many chaotic\nstates. Such a problem arises naturally, e.g., when dealing with wave\npropagation in the presence of a complex environment. Using a statistical model\nbased on random matrix theory, we obtain a number of nonperturbative results\nfor various statistics of scattering characteristics. This includes the joint\nand marginal distributions of the reflection and transmission intensities and\nphases, which are derived exactly at arbitrary coupling to the background with\nfinite absorption. The intensities and phases are found to exhibit highly\nnon-trivial statistical correlations, which remain essential even in the limit\nof strong absorption. In the latter case, we also consider the relevant\napproximations and their accuracy. As an application, we briefly discuss the\nstatistics of the phase rigidity (or mode complexness) in such a scattering\nsituation.\n", "  In a recent paper \"Probing gravitational wave polarizations with signals from\ncompact binary coalescences\" (arXiv:1710.03794 [gr-qc]) the authors argue that\na single detection of gravitational wave by the LIGO-Virgo network is capable\nto distinguish between pure tensor and pure vector polarizations of\ngravitational waves. Here we point out a mistake in the author's analysis and\nshow that such differentiation is possible only in the unlikely event when\ngravitational wave propagates in the direction of interferometer zero response\nfor the tensor or vector polarizations. Nevertheless, the LIGO-Virgo network\ncan distinguish between pure tensor and pure vector polarizations by collecting\nstatistics, as we showed in Phys. Scr. 92, 125001 (2017).\n", "  The discovery of the exoplanet Proxima b highlights the potential for the\ncoming generation of giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) to characterize\nterrestrial --- potentially habitable --- planets orbiting nearby stars with\ndirect imaging. This will require continued development and implementation of\noptimized adaptive optics systems feeding coronagraphs on the GSMTs. Such\ndevelopment should proceed with an understanding of the fundamental limits\nimposed by atmospheric turbulence. Here we seek to address this question with a\nsemi-analytic framework for calculating the post-coronagraph contrast in a\nclosed-loop AO system. We do this starting with the temporal power spectra of\nthe Fourier basis calculated assuming frozen flow turbulence, and then apply\nclosed-loop transfer functions. We include the benefits of a simple predictive\ncontroller, which we show could provide over a factor of 1400 gain in raw PSF\ncontrast at 1 $\\lambda/D$ on bright stars, and more than a factor of 30 gain on\nan I = 7.5 mag star such as Proxima. More sophisticated predictive control can\nbe expected to improve this even further. Assuming a photon noise limited\nobserving technique such as High Dispersion Coronagraphy, these gains in raw\ncontrast will decrease integration times by the same large factors. Predictive\ncontrol of atmospheric turbulence should therefore be seen as one of the key\ntechnologies which will enable ground-based telescopes to characterize\nterrrestrial planets.\n", "  In August 2015 the cryptographic world was shaken by a sudden and surprising\nannouncement by the US National Security Agency NSA concerning plans to\ntransition to post-quantum algorithms. Since this announcement post-quantum\ncryptography has become a topic of primary interest for several standardization\nbodies. The transition from the currently deployed public-key algorithms to\npost-quantum algorithms has been found to be challenging in many aspects. In\nparticular the problem of evaluating the quantum-bit security of such\npost-quantum cryptosystems remains vastly open. Of course this question is of\nprimarily concern in the process of standardizing the post-quantum\ncryptosystems. In this paper we consider the quantum security of the problem of\nsolving a system of {\\it $m$ Boolean multivariate quadratic equations in $n$\nvariables} (\\MQb); a central problem in post-quantum cryptography. When $n=m$,\nunder a natural algebraic assumption, we present a Las-Vegas quantum algorithm\nsolving \\MQb{} that requires the evaluation of, on average, $O(2^{0.462n})$\nquantum gates. To our knowledge this is the fastest algorithm for solving\n\\MQb{}.\n", "  Passive microrheology typically deduces shear elastic loss and storage moduli\nfrom displacement time series or mean-squared displacement (MSD) of thermally\nfluctuating probe particles in equilibrium materials. Common data analysis\nmethods use either Kramers-Kronig (KK) transformations or functional fitting to\ncalculate frequency-dependent loss and storage moduli. We propose a new\nanalysis method for passive microrheology that avoids the limitations of both\nof these approaches. In this method, we determine both real and imaginary\ncomponents of the complex, frequency-dependent response function $\\chi(\\omega)\n= \\chi^{\\prime}(\\omega)+i\\chi^{\\prime\\prime}(\\omega)$ as direct integral\ntransforms of the MSD of thermal particle motion. This procedure significantly\nimproves the high-frequency fidelity of $\\chi(\\omega)$ relative to the use of\nKK transformation, which has been shown to lead to artifacts in\n$\\chi^{\\prime}(\\omega)$. We test our method on both model data and experimental\ndata. Experiments were performed on solutions of worm-like micelles and dilute\ncollagen solutions. While the present method agrees well with established\nKK-based methods at low frequencies, we demonstrate significant improvement at\nhigh frequencies using our symmetric analysis method, up to almost the\nfundamental Nyquist limit.\n", "  The light quark $uds$ mesons have been a foundation of our understanding of\nthe strong interaction for decades. New experiments with modern detectors and\nlarge data sets are furthering our understanding of the spectrum and dynamics\nof these states. In this paper, I review several recent results on the\nspectroscopy of light mesons and discuss the future of this field.\n", "  We describe a framework for constructing the Ricci-flat metrics on the total\nspace of the canonical bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# \\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$\n(the del Pezzo surface of rank one). We construct explicitly the first-order\ndeformation of the so-called `orthotoric metric' on this manifold. We also show\nthat the deformation of the corresponding conformal Killing-Yano form does not\nexist.\n", "  We study ionic liquids interacting with electrified interfaces. The ionic\nfluid is modeled as a Coulomb lattice gas. We compare the ionic density\nprofiles calculated using a popular modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation with\nthe explicit Monte Carlo simulations. The modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory\nfails to capture the structural features of the double layer and is also unable\nto correctly predict the ionic density at the electrified interface. The\nlattice Monte Carlo simulations qualitatively capture the coarse-grained\nstructure of the double layer in the continuum. We propose a convolution\nrelation that semiquantitatively relates the ionic density profiles of a\ncontinuum ionic liquid and its lattice counterpart near an electrified\ninterface.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are small swirling topological defects in the\nmagnetization texture stabilized by the protection due to their topology. In\nmost cases they are induced by chiral interactions between atomic spins\nexisting in non-centrosymmetric magnetic compounds or in thin films in which\ninversion symmetry is broken by the presence of an interface. The skyrmions can\nbe extremely small with diameters in the nanometer range and, importantly, they\nbehave as particles that can be moved, created or annihilated, making them\nsuitable for abacus-type applications in information storage, logic or\nneuro-inspired technologies. Up to the last years skyrmions were observed only\nat low temperature (and in most cases under large applied fields) but important\nefforts of research has been recently devoted to find thin film and\nmultilayered structures in which skyrmions are stabilized above room\ntemperature and manipulated by current. This article focuses on these recent\nadvances on the route to devices prototypes.\n", "  We study a pair of infinite dimensional dynamical systems naturally\nassociated with the study of minimizing/maximizing functions for the Strichartz\ninequalities for the Schr\\\"odinger equation. One system is of gradient type and\nthe other one is a Hamiltonian system. For both systems, the corresponding sets\nof critical points, their stability, and the relation between the two are\ninvestigated. By a combination of numerical and analytical methods we argue\nthat the Gaussian is a maximizer in a class of Strichartz inequalities for\ndimensions one, two and three. The argument reduces to verification of an\napparently new combinatorial inequality involving binomial coefficients.\n", "  We show that the rate of pollution of white dwarfs by asteroidal material\nimplies a concomitant rate of material ejection that can contribute\nsignificantly to the population of interstellar minor bodies. We note also that\nthe irradiation during post main sequence evolution implies that much of this\nejected material may lose volatiles, providing a rationale for the curious\nproperties of the recently discovered interstellar object Oumuamua.\n", "  The most heavily-obscured, luminous quasars might represent a specific phase\nof the evolution of actively accreting supermassive black holes and their host\ngalaxies, possibly related to mergers. We investigated a sample of the most\nluminous quasars at $z\\approx 1-3$ in the GOODS fields, selected in the\nmid-infrared band through detailed spectral energy distribution (SED)\ndecomposition. The vast majority of these quasars (~80%) are obscured in the\nX-ray band and ~30% of them to such an extent, that they are undetected in some\nof the deepest (2 and 4 Ms) Chandra X-ray data. Although no clear relation is\nfound between the star-formation rate of the host galaxies and the X-ray\nobscuration, we find a higher incidence of heavily-obscured quasars in\ndisturbed/merging galaxies compared to the unobscured ones, thus possibly\nrepresenting an earlier stage of evolution, after which the system is relaxing\nand becoming unobscured.\n", "  Heterostructures play significant roles in modern semiconductor devices and\nmicro/nanosystems in a plethora of applications in electronics,\noptoelectronics, and transducers. While state-of-the-art heterostructures often\ninvolve stacks of crystalline epi-layers each down to a few nanometers thick,\nthe intriguing limit would be heterto-atomic-layer structures. Here we report\nthe first experimental demonstration of freestanding van der Waals\nheterostructures and their functional nanomechanical devices. By stacking\nsingle-layer (1L) MoS2 on top of suspended single-, bi-, tri- and four-layer\n(1L to 4L) graphene sheets, we realize array of MoS2-graphene heterostructures\nwith varying thickness and size. These heterostructures all exhibit robust\nnanomechanical resonances in the very high frequency (VHF) band (up to ~100\nMHz). We observe that fundamental-mode resonance frequencies of the\nheterostructure devices fall between the values of graphene and MoS2 devices.\nQuality (Q) factors of heterostructure resonators are lower than those of\ngraphene but comparable to those of MoS2 devices, suggesting interface damping\nrelated to interlayer interactions in the van der Waals heterostructures. This\nstudy validates suspended atomic layer heterostructures as an effective device\nplatform and opens opportunities for exploiting mechanically coupled effects\nand interlayer interactions in such devices.\n", "  In-plane ordering of Cs+ layers in Helmhotlz planes was studied on Pt(111)\nsurface in 0.1 M CsF electrolyte solutions with synchtrotron surface x-ray\nscattering techniques. The ordering was measured in a new transmission cell,\ndesigned for in situ and non situ measurements and high-temperature sample\nannealing all in the cell without sample transfer steps. At -850 mV vs.\nAg/AgCl, (2x2) in-plane scattering peaks were weak under in situ condition and\ngrew rapidly under non situ condition as the surface emersed from the\nelectrolyte. The models for the (2x2) structures are presented and differences\nbetween in situ and non situ conditions are discussed.\n", "  White-light flares are the flares with emissions visible in the optical\ncontinuum. They are thought to be rare and pose the most stringent requirements\nin energy transport and heating in the lower atmosphere. Here we present a\nnearly circular white-light flare on 2015 March 10 that was well observed by\nthe Optical and Near-infrared Solar Eruption Tracer and Solar Dynamics\nObservatory. In this flare, there appear simultaneously both impulsive and\ngradual white-light kernels. The generally accepted thick-target model would be\nresponsible for the impulsive kernels but not sufficient to interpret the\ngradual kernels. Some other mechanisms including soft X-ray backwarming or\ndownward-propagating Alfven waves, acting jointly with electron beam\nbombardment, provide a possible interpretation. However, the origin of this\nkind of white-light kernels is still an open question that induces more\nobservations and researches in the future to decipher it.\n", "  By using Araki's relative entropy, Lieb's convexity and the theory of\nsingular integrals, we compute the mutual information associated with free\nfermions, and we deduce many results about entropies for chiral CFT's which are\nembedded into free fermions, and their extensions. Such relative entropies in\nCFT are here computed explicitly for the first time in a mathematical rigorous\nway. Our results agree with previous computations by physicists based on\nheuristic arguments; in addition we uncover a surprising connection with the\ntheory of subfactors, in particular by showing that a certain duality, which is\nargued to be true on physical grounds, is in fact violated if the global\ndimension of the conformal net is greater than $1.$\n", "  We establish a connection between continuous-variable quantum computing and\nhigh-dimensional integration by showing that the outcome probabilities of\ncontinuous-variable instantaneous quantum polynomial (CV-IQP) circuits are\ngiven by integrals of oscillating functions in large dimensions. We prove two\nresults related to the classical hardness of evaluating these integrals: (i) we\nshow that there exist circuits such that these integrals are approximations of\na weighted sum of #P-hard problems and (ii) we prove that calculating these\nintegrals is as hard as calculating integrals of arbitrary bounded functions.\nWe then leverage these results to show that, given a plausible conjecture about\nthe hardness of computing the integrals, approximate sampling from CV-IQP\ncircuits cannot be done in polynomial time on a classical computer unless the\npolynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Our results hold even in the\npresence of finite squeezing and limited measurement precision, without an\nexplicit need for fault-tolerance.\n", "  The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from\nEarth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (~ 1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation\nspeed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of\nmagnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts cause the so-called\nForbush decrease, which can be de- tected as a reduction of galactic cosmic\nrays measured on-ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from\nin-situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and B as well as GCR\nmeasurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard Mars\nScience Laboratory (MSL) on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been\nselected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or B) and Mars locations\nwere nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane\n(so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs'\ntransit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the\ncorresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the\nevolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit\nand find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the\nambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial\nvariance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic\nand diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are\ncompared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely\nthe Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.\n", "  Metasurfaces offer great potential to control near- and far-fields through\nengineering of optical properties of elementary cells or meta-atoms. Such\nperspective opens a route to efficient manipulation of the optical signals both\nat nanoscale and in photonics applications. In this paper we show that by using\nan effective surface conductivity tensor it is possible to unambigiously\ndescribe optical properties of an anisotropic metasurface in the far- and\nnear-field regimes. We begin with retrieving the effective surface conductivity\ntensor from the comparative analysis of experimental and numerical reflectance\nspectra of a metasurface composed of elliptical gold nanoparticles. Afterwards\nrestored conductivities are validated in the crosscheck versus semianalytic\nparameters obtained with the discrete dipole model with and without dipoles\ninteraction contribution. The obtained effective parameters are further used\nfor the dispersion analysis of surface plasmons localized at the metasurface.\nThe effective medium model predicts existence of both TE- and TM-polarized\nplasmons in a wide range of optical frequencies and describes peculiarities of\ntheir dispersion, in particularly, topological transition from the elliptical\nto hyperbolic regime with eligible accuracy. The analysis in question offers a\nsimple practical way to describe properties of metasurfaces including ones in\nthe near-field zone by extracting effective parameters from the convenient\nfar-field characterisation.\n", "  In the short letter, we explain an improved transform theory for\ncolloidal-probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM). CP-AFM can measure a force\ncurve between the colloidal probe and a wall surface in a colloidal dispersion.\nThe transform theory can estimate the normalized number density distribution of\nthe colloidal particles on the wall from the force curve measured by CP-AFM.\nThe transform theory is important for study of the stratification of the\ncolloidal particles on the wall, which is related to fundamental studies of\ncolloidal crystal and glass.\n", "  We survey a number of results regarding the representation theory of\n$W$-algebras and their connection with the resent development of the four\ndimensional $N=2$ superconformal field theories in physics.\n", "  The work is devoted to modeling of the processes occurring in ion-plasma\ntreatment of polyurethane and forming on its surface a special carbonized\nlayer. The mechanisms affecting the formation of wave-like relief in the\ncarbonized layer are examined. The boundary value problem for the heat equation\nfor modeling the effect of temperature component was solved. Using the finite\nelement method the deformation of the polyurethane sample during ion-plasma\ntreatment was calculated. On the basis of calculations conclusion about the\nimpact of these factors on the formation of wave-like relief in the carbonized\nlayer was made.\n", "  Using the transfer-matrix approach and solving time-domain differential\nequations, we analyze the loss compensation mechanism in multilayer systems\ncomposed of an absorbing transparent conductive oxide and dielectric doped with\nan active material. We reveal also another regime with the possibility of\nenhanced transmission with suppressed reflection originating from the resonant\nproperties of the multilayers. For obliquely incident and evanescent waves,\nsuch enhanced transmission under suppressed reflection turns into the\nreflectionless regime, which is similar to that observed in the PT-symmetric\nstructures, but does not require PT symmetry. We infer that the reflectionless\ntransmission is due to the full loss compensation at the resonant wavelengths\nof the multilayers.\n", "  We have performed a numerical simulation of a two-dimensional Eden model with\nrandom-size particles. In the present model, the particle radii are generated\nfrom a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$.\nFirst, we have examined the bulk packing fraction for the Eden cluster and\ninvestigated the effects of the standard deviation and the total number of\nparticles $N_{\\mathrm{T}}$. We show that the bulk packing fraction depends on\nthe number of particles and the standard deviation. In particular, for the\ndependence on the standard deviation, we have determined the asymptotic value\nof the bulk packing fraction in the limit of the dimensionless standard\ndeviation. This value is larger than the packing fraction obtained in a\nprevious study of the Eden model with uniform-size particles. Secondly, we have\ninvestigated the packing fraction of the entire Eden cluster including the\neffect of the interface fluctuation. We find that the entire packing fraction\ndepends on the number of particles while it is independent of the standard\ndeviation, in contrast to the bulk packing fraction. In a similar way to the\nbulk packing fraction, we have obtained the asymptotic value of the entire\npacking fraction in the limit $N_{\\mathrm{T}} \\to \\infty$. The obtained value\nof the entire packing fraction is smaller than that of the bulk value. This\nfact suggests that the interface fluctuation of the Eden cluster influences the\npacking fraction.\n", "  Conservation of angular momentum depends on the existence of rotational\nsymmetry. However, even in systems where this symmetry is broken, flipping\nbetween angular momentum eigenstates often requires an activation energy. Here\nwe discuss an example of superfluid flow in a toroidal potential, which shows\nsustained oscillations between two different rotation directions. The energy\nrequired to change the direction of rotation is taken out of and temporarily\nrestored into the rotational and intra-component interaction energies of the\nsystem.\n", "  We have theoretically investigated the elastic properties of three\ntopologically identical zeolitic imidazolate frameworks: ZIF-4, ZIF-62 and\nTIF-4, by means of ab initio calculations. The ZIFs are a subset of metal\norganic frameworks (MOFs), whose versatile functionality is providing exciting\nopportunities in solid state science. Understanding the relationship between\nstructure and elastic properties of hybrid materials is making it possible to\ndevelop a new generation of functional materials. In this work we have\ndetermined the bulk ($K$), shear ($G$) and Young's moduli ($E$), together with\nPoisson's ratio($\\upsilon$), and the universal elastic anisotropy index\n($A$$^{\\textbf{U}}$) from the computed elastic coefficients. Tensorial analysis\nof the elastic constants reveals unusual and highly anisotropic elastic\nbehaviour. All three materials exhibit low Young's and shear moduli. In\naddition, their flexibility incorporates regions of negative Poisson's ratio\n(NPR) and negative linear compressibility (NLC). The elastic properties of\nthese ZIF crystals are are affected by the substituted organic linkages.\n", "  The technique presented here for the measurement of electrical conductivity\nis based on the principle that the current converges on a small disk electrode.\nMost of the ohmic resistance therefore lies within a narrow region surrounding\nthe disk. If the reference electrode is kept outside this zone, the potential\ndifference between the working and the reference electrode includes practically\nall ohmic potential drops occurring in the solution. Moreover, this ohmic drop\ncan be related to the conductivity of the solution by an analytical expression\nderived by Newman. At sufficiently high overpotentials, the rate of charge\ntransfer is limited by the conduction of current from the bulk solution to the\nelectrode. In this regime, the current varies linearly with the electrode\npotential and the conductivity of the solution can be estimated from the slope\nof the voltammogram using Newman's expression. The electrochemical reaction\nused for measuring conductivity of solutions of salts is the cathodic reduction\nof water and that used for aqueous acids is the cathodic reduction of hydrogen\nions. The technique has been used to measure conductivity of several common\naqueous electrolytes. A good agreement is found between the present technique\nand the conventional technique based on AC impedance analysis.\n", "  Context: We describe the new SEPIA (Swedish-ESO PI Instrument for APEX)\nreceiver, which was designed and built by the Group for Advanced Receiver\nDevelopment (GARD), at Onsala Space Observatory (OSO) in collaboration with\nESO. It was installed and commissioned at the APEX telescope during 2015 with\nan ALMA Band 5 receiver channel and updated with a new frequency channel (ALMA\nBand 9) in February 2016. Aims: This manuscript aims to provide, for observers\nwho use the SEPIA receiver, a reference in terms of the hardware description,\noptics and performance as well as the commissioning results. Methods: Out of\nthree available receiver cartridge positions in SEPIA, the two current\nfrequency channels, corresponding to ALMA Band 5, the RF band 158--211 GHz, and\nBand 9, the RF band 600--722 GHz, provide state-of-the-art dual polarization\nreceivers. The Band 5 frequency channel uses 2SB SIS mixers with an average SSB\nnoise temperature around 45K with IF (intermediate frequency) band 4--8 GHz for\neach sideband providing total 4x4 GHz IF band. The Band 9 frequency channel\nuses DSB SIS mixers with a noise temperature of 75--125K with IF band 4--12 GHz\nfor each polarization. Results: Both current SEPIA receiver channels are\navailable to all APEX observers.\n", "  We prove the equivalence of two tensor products over a category of\nW*-algebras with normal (not necessarily unital) *-homomorphisms, defined by\nGuichardet and Dauns, respectively. This structure differs from the standard\ntensor product construction by Misonou--Takeda--Turumaru, which is based on\nweak topological completion, and does not have a categorical universality\nproperty.\n", "  Magnetic fields have been detected in most if not all types of stars across\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Where present, these fields have the potential\nto significantly impact the evolution of their host stars. Furthermore, they\nthemselves are affected by the various structural changes which occur in a star\nduring its life. For example, the significant radius expansion during the\npost-main-sequence phase, due to flux conservation, may lead to a decrease in\nsurface magnetic field strength, to a point where the magnetic field may no\nlonger be detectable. As a result, it is a challenge to link the magnetic\nfields observed in main sequence (MS) stars with those observed in very late\nstage stars and even to those in post-MS stars. In this review, I present what\nwe know, from observations, about magnetic stars at various stages of stellar\nevolution.\n", "  We review the results in our recent works on the generation of strong\nmagnetic fields in compact stars driven by the parity violating electroweak\ninteractions between background fermions. The cases of a neutron star, a hybrid\nstar, and a quark star are considered. We formulate the system of kinetic\nequations for the description of the spectra of the magnetic energy and the\nmagnetic helicity, as well as for the chiral imbalances. Turbulence effects,\nwhich can be important for the evolution of small-scale magnetic field, are\nalso taken into account. We find the numerical solution of these equations in\ncase of large- and small-scale magnetic fields in quark matter. The\napplications of the obtained results for the generation of large-scale magnetic\nfields in magnetars and for the explanation of magnetar bursts are discussed.\n", "  We construct a complete and minimal basis of subleading-power N-jet operators\nin position-space soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) and discuss how the\nLow-Burnett-Kroll amplitude is recovered in this framework. We begin a\nsystematic investigation of the anomalous dimension of next-to-leading power\nN-jet operators in view of resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms in\npartonic cross sections and discuss the explicit result at the one-loop order\nfor fermion-number two N-jet operators at the second order in the power\nexpansion parameter of SCET.\n", "  We study two-phase flow for Darcy and Brinkman regimes. To reduce the\ncomputational complexity for flow in vertical equilibrium various simplified\nmodels have been suggested. Examples are dimensional reduction by vertical\nintegration, the multiscale model approach in [Guo et al., 2014] or the\nasymptotic approach in [Yortsos, 1995]. The latter approach uses a geometrical\nscaling. We show the efficiency of the approach in asymptotically flat domains\nfor Darcy regimes. Moreover, we prove that it is vastly equivalent to the\nmultiscale model approach.\n  We apply then asymptotic analysis to the two-phase flow model in Brinkman\nregimes. The limit model is a single nonlocal evolution law with a\npseudo-parabolic extension. Its computational efficiency is demonstrated using\nnumerical examples. Finally, we show that the new limit model exhibits\novershoot behaviour as it has been observed for dynamical capillarity laws\n[Hassanizadeh and Gray, 1993].\n", "  A tessellation of a graph is a partition of its vertices into vertex disjoint\ncliques. A tessellation cover of a graph is a set of tessellations that covers\nall of its edges. The $t$-tessellability problem aims to decide whether there\nis a tessellation cover of the graph with $t$ tessellations. This problem is\nmotivated by its applications to quantum walk models, in especial, the\nevolution operator of the staggered model is obtained from a graph tessellation\ncover. We establish upper bounds on the tessellation cover number given by the\nminimum between the chromatic index of the graph and the chromatic number of\nits clique graph and we show graph classes for which these bounds are tight. We\nprove $\\mathcal{NP}$-completeness for $t$-tessellability if the instance is\nrestricted to planar graphs, chordal (2,1)-graphs, (1,2)-graphs, diamond-free\ngraphs with diameter five, or for any fixed $t$ at least 3. On the other hand,\nwe improve the complexity for 2-tessellability to a linear-time algorithm.\n", "  We treat 3-qubits states with maximally disordered subsystems, by using\nHilbert-Schmidt decompositions.By using unfolding methods, the tensors are\nconverted into matrices and by applying singular values decompositions to these\nmatrices the number 27 of the Hilbert Schmidt parameters, is reduced to 9 and\nunder the condition that the sum of absolute values of these parameters is not\nlarger than 1, we conclude that the density matrix is fully separable . In\nanother method we divide the 27 Hilbert Schmidt parameters into 9 triads where\nfor each triad we calculate the Frobenius norm of 3 Hilbert-Schmidt parameters.\nIf the sum of nine norms is not larger than 1 then we conclude that the density\nmatrix is fully separable . The condition for biseparability of maximally\ndisordered density matrices is obtained by the use of one qubit density matrix\nmultiplied by Bell entangled states of the other two qubits. If the sum of the\nnine Frobenius norms for these different triads is not larger than 1, we\nconclude that the density matrix is biseparable. We analyze the relations\nbetween three qubits maximally disordered subsystems density matrices and the\nmethod of high order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) and show that this\nmethod may improve the sufficient condition for full separability. For three\nqubits states which include multiplication with the unit matrix we find a\nsimple way to reduce the sum of the absolute values of the Hilbert Schmidt\nparameters absolute values and get better conditions for their full\nseparability for special cases.\n", "  We consider causal 3-dimensional triangulations with the topology of\n$S^2\\times [0,1]$ or $D^2\\times [0,1]$ where $S^2$ and $D^2$ are the\ntwo-dimensional sphere and disc, respectively. These triangulations consist of\nslices and we show that these slices can be mapped bijectively onto a set of\ncertain coloured two-dimensional cell complexes satisfying simple conditions.\nThe cell complexes arise as the cross section of the individual slices.\n", "  The cosmological model is at present not tested between the redshift of the\nfarthest observed supernovae (z ~ 1.4) and that of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (z ~ 1,100). Here we introduce a new method to measure the\ncosmological parameters: we show that quasars can be used as \"standard candles\"\nby employing the non-linear relation between their intrinsic UV and X-ray\nemission as an absolute distance indicator. We built a sample of ~ 1,900\nquasars with available UV and X-ray observations, and produced a Hubble Diagram\nup to z ~ 5. The analysis of the quasar Hubble Diagram, when used in\ncombination with supernovae, provides robust constraints on the matter and\nenergy content in the cosmos. The application of this method to forthcoming,\nlarger quasar samples, will also provide tight constraints on the dark energy\nequation of state and its possible evolution with time.\n", "  Hydrodynamic instabilities in miscible fluids are ubiquitous, from natural\nphenomena up to geological scales, to industrial and technological\napplications, where they represent the only way to control and promote mixing\nat low Reynolds numbers, well below the transition from laminar to turbulent\nflow. As for immiscible fluids, the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in\nmiscible fluids is directly related to the physics of their interfaces. The\nfocus of this review is therefore on the general mechanisms driving the growth\nof disturbances at the boundary between miscible fluids, under a variety of\nforcing conditions. In the absence of a regularizing mechanism, these\ndisturbances would grow indefinitely. For immiscible fluids, interfacial\ntension provides such a regularizing mechanism, because of the energy cost\nassociated to the creation of new interface by a growing disturbance. For\nmiscible fluids, however, the very existence of interfacial stresses that mimic\nan effective surface tension is debated. Other mechanisms, however, may also be\nrelevant, such as viscous dissipation. We shall review the stabilizing\nmechanisms that control the most common hydrodynamic instabilities,\nhighlighting those cases for which the lack of an effective interfacial tension\nposes deep conceptual problems in the mathematical formulation of a linear\nstability analysis. Finally, we provide a short overview on the ongoing\nresearch on the effective, out of equilibrium interfacial tension between\nmiscible fluids.\n", "  Nonlinear second-harmonic magnetic response (M2) was used to characterize an\naqueous colloidal solution of dextran-coated magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles.\nData analysis with the formalism based on Gilbert-Landau-Lifshitz equation for\nstochastic dynamics of superparamagnetic (SP) particles ensured extensive\nquantifying of the system via a set of magnetic and magnetodynamic parameters,\nsuch as the mean magnetic moment, the damping constant, the longitudinal\nrelaxation time, the magnetic anisotropy field and energy, and others. Combined\nwith transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, M2\ntechnique allowed obtaining additional parameters, viz., the dextran-coating\nthickness and the interparticle magnetic dipolar energy. Aggregated colloidal\nnanoparticles were shown to be magnetically correlated inside the aggregate due\nto magnetic dipole-dipole (d-d) coupling within the correlation radius ~50 nm.\nWith the d-d coupling account, the volume distribution of the aggregates\nrecovered from M2 measurements is well consistent with electron microscopy\nresults. From electron magnetic resonance, abrupt change of SP dynamics with\nincreasing external magnetic field was observed and explained. The presented\nstudy exemplifies a novel M2-based procedure of comprehensive quantitative\ncharacterization applicable for a wide variety of SP systems.\n", "  We present a tight-binding parametrization for penta-graphene that correctly\ndescribes its electronic band structure and linear optical response. The set of\nparameters is validated by comparing to ab-initio density functional theory\ncalculations for single-layer penta-graphene, showing a very good global\nagreement. We apply this parameterization to penta-graphene nanoribbons,\nachieving an adequate description of quantum-size effects. Additionally, a\nsymmetry-based analysis of the energy band structure and the optical\ntransitions involved in the absorption spectra is introduced, allowing for the\ninterpretation of the optoelectronic features of these systems.\n", "  We present numerical results for the nonplanar lightlike cusp and collinear\nanomalous dimension at four loops in ${\\mathcal N} = 4$ SYM theory, which we\ninfer from a calculation of the Sudakov form factor. The latter is expressed as\na rational linear combination of uniformly transcendental integrals for\narbitrary colour factor. Numerical integration in the nonplanar sector reveals\nexplicitly the breakdown of quadratic Casimir scaling at the four-loop order. A\nthorough analysis of the reported numerical uncertainties is carried out.\n", "  In this PhD thesis we extend the twistor formalism to encompass (partially)\noff-shell quantities. We describe all gauge-invariant local composite operators\nin twistor space and show that they immediately generate all tree-level form\nfactors of the MHV type. We use the formalism to compute form factors at NMHV\nand higher NkMHV level in parallel to how this had been done for amplitudes\npreviously. Finally, we move on to integrability by computing the one-loop\ndilatation operator in the scalar sector of the theory in twistor space.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the entanglement swapping\nbetween two independent nonperfect cavities consisting of an atom with finite\nlifetime of atomic levels (as two independent sources of dissipation) which\ninteracts with a quantized electromagnetic field in the presence of detuning\nand Kerr medium. In fact, there is no direct interaction between the two atoms,\ntherefore, no entanglement exists between them. We use the Bell state\nmeasurement performing on the photons leaving the cavities to swap the\nentanglement stored between the atom-fields in each cavity into atom-atom. Our\nmotivation is arisen from the fact that two-qubit entangled states are of\nenough interest for quantum information science and technologies. We discuss\nthe effect of initial state of the system, detuning parameter, the Kerr medium\nand the two dissipation sources on the swapped entanglement to atom-atom. We\ninterestingly find that when the atomic decay rates and photonic leakages from\nthe cavities are equal, our system behaves as an ideal system with no\ndissipation. Our results show that it is possible to create a long-living\natom-atom maximally entangled state in the presence of Kerr effect and\ndissipation; we determine these conditions in detail and also establish the\nfinal atom-atom Bell state.\n", "  We consider the derivatives of Horn hypergeometric functions of any number\nvariables with respect to their parameters. The derivative of the function in\n$n$ variables is expressed as a Horn hypergeometric series of $n+1$ infinite\nsummations depending on the same variables and with the same region of\nconvergence as for original Horn function. The derivatives of Appell functions,\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions, confluent and non-confluent Lauricella\nseries and generalized Lauricella series are explicitly presented. Applications\nto the calculation of Feynman diagrams are discussed, especially the series\nexpansion in $\\epsilon$ within dimensional regularization. Connections with\nother classes of special functions are discussed as well.\n", "  We study the stability of non-relativistic polytropic stars within two\nmodified gravity theories i.e., Beyond Horndeski gravity and Eddington inspired\nBorn Infeld theories using the configuration entropy method. We use spatially\nlocalized bounded function of energy density as solutions from stellar\neffective equations to construct the corresponding configuration entropy. We\nuse the same argument as the one used by the authors of Refs. [1,2] that the\nstars are stable if there is peak in configuration entropy as a function of\nadiabatic index curve. Specifically, the boundary between stable and unstable\nregions which corresponds to Chandrasekhar stability bound is indicated from\nthe existence of the maximum peak while the most stable polytropic stars is\nindicated by minimum peak in the corresponding curve. We have found that the\nvalue of critical adiabatic indexes of Chandrasekhar stability bound and the\nmost stable polytropic stars predicted by non-relativistic limit of Beyond\nHorndeski Gravity and Eddington inspired Born Infeld theories are different to\nthose predicted by general relativity where the corresponding differences\ndepend on the free parameter of both theories.\n", "  We review the developments of the statistical physics of fracture and\nearthquake over the last four decades. We argue that major progress has been\nmade in this field and that the key concepts should now become integral part of\nthe (under-) graduate level text books in condensed matter physics. For arguing\nin favor of this, we compare the development (citations) with the same for some\nother related topics in condensed matter, for which Nobel prizes have already\nbeen awarded.\n", "  General relativity (GR) characterizes gravity as a geometric properly\nexhibited as curvature on spacetime. Teleprallelism describes gravity through\ntorsional properties, and can reproduce GR at the level of equations. Similar\nto f(R) gravity, on taking a generalization, f(T) gravity can produce various\nmodifications its gravitational mechanism. The resulting field equations are\ninherently distinct to f(R) gravity in that they are second order. In the\npresent work, f(T) gravity is examined in the cosmological context with a\nnumber of solutions reconstructed by means of an auxiliary scalar field. To do\nthis, various forms of the Hubble parameter are considered with an f(T)\nlagrangian emerging for each instance. In addition, the inhomogeneous equation\nof state (EoS) is investigated with a particular Hubble parameter model used to\nshow how this can be used to reconstruct the f(T) lagrangian. Observationally,\nboth the auxiliary scalar field or exotic terms in the FRW field equations give\nthe same results, meaning that the variation in the Hubble parameter may be\ninterpreted as the need to reformulate gravity in some way as is done in f(T)\ngravity.\n", "  Addition of solutes is commonly used to stabilize nanocrystalline materials\nagainst grain growth. However, segregating at grain boundaries, these solutes\nalso affect the process of dislocation nucleation from grain boundaries under\napplied stress. Using atomistic simulations we demonstrate that the effect of\nsolutes on the dislocation nucleation strongly depends on the distribution of\nsolutes at the grain boundary, which can vary dramatically depending on the\nsolute type. In particular, our results indicate that the solutes with a\nsmaller size mismatch can be more effective in suppressing dislocation emission\nfrom grain boundaries. Bearing in mind that dislocation slip originating from\ngrain boundaries or their triple junctions is the dominant mechanism of plastic\ndeformation when grain sizes are reduced to the nanoscale, we emphasize the\nimportance of the search for the optimal solute additions, which would\nstabilize the nanocrystalline material against grain growth and, at the same\ntime, effectively suppress the dislocation nucleation from the grain\nboundaries.\n", "  In an effort to understand the dynamics of the Arctic sea-ice edge, we\npresent a simple model of heat and mass transfer in the Fram Strait that\nreveals some fundamental mechanisms controlling sea-ice extent in the marginal\nseas and the depth and properties of the Arctic mixed layer. We identify and\nstudy key mechanisms relating to the sea-ice wedge described by Untersteiner, a\nboundary-layer structure near the ice edge, demonstrating how ice thickness and\nextent depend on ice-export rates, atmospheric forcing and the properties of\nincoming warm and salty Atlantic water in the West Spitsbergen Current. Our\ntime-dependent results demonstrate a seasonal asymmetry between the rates of\nice advance and retreat and explain the significant variations in the Southerly\nextent of sea ice across the Fram Strait, with a long ice tongue corresponding\nwith the East Greenland Current. Our simple model indicates that thinning of\nthe Arctic sea-ice cover will lead to warming and freshening of the North\nAtlantic, which would give a de-stabilizing feedback to the Arctic ice cover,\nleading to a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.\n", "  We discuss the most general necessary and sufficient condition for three\nmassless light neutrinos in variants of the type I seesaw mechanism in which we\nintroduce an arbitrary number of fermionic gauge singlets. We find that having\nmassless light neutrinos is equivalent to enforcing the conservation of lepton\nnumber. As a consequence, any symmetry that leads to massless light neutrinos\nwill contain as an unbroken subgroup a conserved lepton number. This will be\nimportant for searches for heavy sterile neutrinos since in general the light\nneutrino masses will be proportional to small lepton number violating\nparameters that will also suppress lepton number violating signatures.\n", "  In this paper we study controllability of a $d$-level atom interacting with\nthe electromagnetic field in a cavity. The system is modelled by an ordered\ngraph $\\Gamma$. The vertices of $\\Gamma$ describe the energy levels and the\nedges allowed transitions. To each edge of $\\Gamma$ we associate a harmonic\noscillator representing one mode of the electromagnetic field. The dynamics of\nthe system (drift) is given by a natural generalization of the Jaynes-Cummings\nHamiltonian. If we add in addition sufficient control over the atom, the\noverall system (atom and em-field) becomes strongly controllable, i.e. each\nunitary on the system Hilbert space can be approximated with arbitrary\nprecision in the strong topology by control unitaries. A key role in the proof\nis played by a topological *-algebra which is (roughly speaking) a\nrepresentation of the path algebra of $\\Gamma$. It contains crucial structural\ninformation about the control problem, and is therefore an important tool for\nthe implementation of control tasks like preparing a particular state from the\nground state. This is demonstrated by a detailed discussion of different\nversions of three-level systems.\n", "  We demonstrate manipulation of quantum interference by controlling the\ncompetitions between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) via\nvariation of the gate voltages of double- gate amorphous InGaZnO thin-film\ntransistors. Our study unveils the full profile of an intriguing universal\ndependence of the respective WL and WAL contributions on the channel\nconductivity. This universality is discovered to be robust against interface\ndisorder.\n", "  The experimental data taken from both Drell-Yan and deep-inelastic scattering\n(DIS) experiments suggest a sign-change in $\\bar d(x) - \\bar u(x)$ flavor\nasymmetry in the proton at large values of momentum fraction $x$. In this work,\nwe present a phenomenological study of $\\bar d(x) - \\bar u(x)$ flavor\nasymmetry. First, we extract the $\\bar d(x)-\\bar u(x)$ distribution using the\nmore recent data from the BONuS experiment at Jefferson Lab on the ratio of\nneutron to proton structure functions, $F_2^n/F_2^p$, and show that it\nundergoes a sing-change and becomes negative at large values of momentum\nfraction $x$, as expected. The stability and reliability of our obtained\nresults have been examined by including target mass corrections (TMCs) as well\nas higher twist (HT) terms which are particularly important at the large-$x$\nregion at low Q$^2$. Then, we calculate the $\\bar d(x) - \\bar u(x)$\ndistribution using the Brodsky, Hoyer, Peterson, and Sakai (BHPS) model and\nshow that if one chooses a mass for the down quark smaller than the one for the\nup quark it leads to a better description for the Fermilab E866 data. In order\nto prove this claim, we determine the masses of down and up sea quarks by\nfitting to the available and up-to-date experimental data for the $\\bar\nd(x)-\\bar u(x)$ distribution. In this respect, unlike the previous performed\ntheoretical studies, we have shown that this distribution has a sign-change at\n$x>0.3$ after evolution to the scale of available experimental data.\n", "  This paper studies the resonances of Schr\\\"odinger operators with bounded,\ncompactly supported, real-valued potentials on d-dimensional Euclidean space,\nwhere d is even. If the potential V is non-trivial and d is not 4 then the\nmeromorphic continuation of the resolvent of the Schr\\\"odinger operator has\ninfinitely many poles, with a quantitative lower bound on their density. A\nsomewhat weaker statement holds if d =4. We prove several inverse-type results.\nIf the meromorphic continuations of the resolvents of two Schr\\\"odinger\noperators $-\\Delta +V_1$ and $-\\Delta +V_2$ have the same poles, with both\npotentials bounded, compactly supported and real-valued, if k is a natural\nnumber and if $V_1\\in H^k({\\mathbb R}^d; {\\mathbb R})$, then $V_2\\in H^k$ as\nwell. Moreover, we prove that certain sets of isoresonant potentials are\ncompact. We also show that the poles of the resolvent for a smooth potential\ndetermine the heat coefficients and that the (resolvent) resonance sets of two\nbounded, real-valued potentials with compact support cannot differ by a nonzero\nfinite number of elements away from $0$.\n", "  We study the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion self-energy in massless\nand massive $QED_2$, in the ladder approximation. When the fermion is massless\n(and the photon massless or massive), we check the reliability of this\napproximation by comparing its solutions with the exact ones. They agree only\nwhen the photon is massless. For a massive fermion and massless photon, we show\nthat there is no consistent solution at all, the infrared divergences\nintroduced by the approximation forbidding even the trivial solution. When both\nfermion and photon are massive, we find a non-perturbative (extra) fermion mass\ngeneration (which survives in the limit when the bare mass of the fermion tends\nto zero). We argue that, in this case, the ladder approximation will provide\nreliable results if the bare masses of the fields are large compared with the\n(dimensionful) coupling constant.\n"]}
