The entanglement entropy in a\nstrip geometry at such QCPs can be obtained via the \"Shannon entropy\" of a 1D\nspin chain with open boundary conditions. The Shannon entropy of the XXZ chain\nis found to have a logarithmic term that implies, for the QCP of the\nsquare-lattice quantum dimer model, a logarithm with universal coefficient $\\pm\n0.25$. However, the logarithm in the Shannon entropy of the transverse-field\nIsing model, which corresponds to entanglement in the 2D Ising conformal QCP,\nis found to have a singular dependence on replica or R\\'enyi index resulting\nfrom flows to different boundary conditions at the entanglement cut.\n", "  Context. Maser emission is a strong tool for studying high mass star forming\nregions and their evolutionary stages. OH masers in particular can trace the\ncircumstellar material around protostars and determine their magnetic field\nstrengths at milliarcsecond resolution.\n  Aims. Imaging OH maser mission towards high mass protostellar objects to\ndetermine their evolutionary stages and to locate the detected maser emission\nin the process of high mass star formation.\n  Methods. In 2007, we surveyed OH maser towards 217 high mass protostellar\nobjects to study its presence. In this paper, we present a follow up MERLIN\nobservations of a ground state OH maser emission towards one of these objects,\nIRAS 19092+0841.\n  Results. Emission from the two OH main spectral lines, 1665 and 1667 MHz,\nwere detected close to the central object. The positions and velocities of the\nOH maser features have been determined. The masers are distributed over a\nregion of ~ 500 corresponding to 22400 AU (or ~ 0.1 pc) at a distance of 4.48\nkpc. The polarization properties of the OH maser features were determined as\nwell. We identify three Zeeman pairs from which we inferred a magnetic field\nstrength of ~ 4:4mG pointing towards the observer.\n  Conclusions. The relatively small velocity spread and the relatively wide\nspacial distribution of the OH maser features support the suggestion that this\nobject could be in an early evolutionary state before the presence of disk\nand/or jet/outfows.\n", "  The statistics of photons emitted by single multilevel systems is\ninvestigated with emphasis on the nonrenewal characteristics of the\nphoton-arrival times. We consider the correlation between consecutive\ninterphoton times and present closed form expressions for the corresponding\nmultiple moment analysis. Based on the moments a memory measure is proposed\nwhich provides an easy way of gaging the non-renewal statistics. Monte-Carlo\nsimulations demonstrate that the experimental verification of non-renewal\nstatistics is feasible.\n", "  We propose a superfield method to construct off-shell actions for N-extended\nconformal supergravity theories in three space-time dimensions. It makes use of\nthe superform technique to engineer supersymmetric invariants. The method is\nspecifically applied to the case of N=1 conformal supergravity and provides a\nnew realization for the actions of conformal and topologically massive\nsupergravities.\n", "  Trying to identify the entropy production within a cell has been part of\ndebates and studies in the last century. First the idea was to make a\nresemblance of a cell with a Carnot engine, which is the most thermodynamically\nperfect machine. This approach was clearly not the best, since the yield\nachieved within a cell cannot be ideal, but can we even measure it? Several\nmodels approach the living cell, since the very simple one (e.g. Prigogine\nmodel) to more elaborated proposals. The concept of entropy has been the centre\nof discussions within several scientific fields. To interpret how entropy is\nproduced in the complicated system of a cell is as hard as to understand how\nlife originated at the first place. Understanding the way a cell works is key\nin biology, medicine, and multiple other scientific fields. Thermodynamics is\nessential in multitude of processes around us. I give here an insight of what\nhas been done and a personal opinion about the topic, focusing in the results\nfrom Himeoka and Kaneko paper.\n", "  Electric quadrupole strength functions have been deduced from averages of a\nlarge number of $E2$ transition strengths calculated within the shell model for\nthe nuclides $^{94}$Mo and $^{95}$Mo. These strength functions are at variance\nwith phenomenological approximations as provided by the Reference Input\nParameter Library RIPL-3 for calculations of reaction rates on the basis of the\nstatistical model.\n", "  In this article we present a simple repeater scheme based on the\nnegatively-charged nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond (NV-). Each repeater node\nis built from simple modules comprising an optical cavity containing a single\nNV-, with one nuclear spin from 15N as quantum memory. The operation in the\nmodule only uses deterministic processes and interactions and achieves high\nfidelity (>99%) operation, and modules are connected by optical fiber. In the\nrepeater node architecture, the processes between modules by photons can be in\nprinciple deterministic, however current limitations on optical components lead\nto the processes to be probabilistic but heralded. The most resource modest\nrepeater architecture contains at least two modules at each node, and the\nrepeater nodes are than connected by telecom wavelength entangled photon pairs.\nWe discuss the performance of quantum repeaters starting from the\nminimum-resource strategy with several modules (~10) and then incorporating\nmore resource-intense strategies step by step. Our architecture enables\nlarge-scale quantum information networks with existing technology.\n", "  A stable generalized complex structure is one that is generically symplectic\nbut degenerates along a real codimension two submanifold, where it defines a\ngeneralized Calabi-Yau structure. We introduce a Lie algebroid which allows us\nto view such structures as symplectic forms. This allows us to construct new\nexamples of stable structures, and also to define period maps for their\ndeformations in which the background three-form flux is either fixed or not,\nproving the unobstructedness of both deformation problems. We then use the same\ntools to establish local normal forms for the degeneracy locus and for\nLagrangian branes. Applying our normal forms to the four-dimensional case, we\nprove that any compact stable generalized complex 4-manifold has a symplectic\ncompletion, in the sense that it can be modified near its degeneracy locus to\nproduce a compact symplectic 4-manifold.\n", "  We introduce a general model of dimer coverings of certain plane bipartite\ngraphs, which we call rail yard graphs (RYG). The transfer matrices used to\ncompute the partition function are shown to be isomorphic to certain operators\narising in the so-called boson-fermion correspondence. This allows to\nreformulate the RYG dimer model as a Schur process, i.e. as a random sequence\nof integer partitions subject to some interlacing conditions.\n  Beyond the computation of the partition function, we provide an explicit\nexpression for all correlation functions or, equivalently, for the inverse\nKasteleyn matrix of the RYG dimer model. This expression, which is amenable to\nasymptotic analysis, follows from an exact combinatorial description of the\noperators localizing dimers in the transfer-matrix formalism, and then a\nsuitable application of Wick's theorem.\n  Plane partitions, domino tilings of the Aztec diamond, pyramid partitions,\nand steep tilings arise as particular cases of the RYG dimer model. For the\nAztec diamond, we provide new derivations of the edge-probability generating\nfunction, of the biased creation rate, of the inverse Kasteleyn matrix and of\nthe arctic circle theorem.\n", "  The early steps of photosynthesis involve the photo-excitation of reaction\ncentres (RCs) and light-harvesting (LH) units. Here, we show that the\n--historically overlooked-- excitonic delocalisation across RC and LH pigments\nresults in a redistribution of dipole strengths that benefits the absorption\ncross section of the optical bands associated with the RC of several species.\nWhile we prove that this redistribution is robust to the microscopic details of\nthe dephasing between these units in the purple bacterium Rhodospirillum\nrubrum, we are able to show that the redistribution witnesses a more fragile,\nbut persistent, coherent population dynamics which directs excitations from the\nLH towards the RC units under incoherent illumination and physiological\nconditions. Stochastic optimisation allows us to delineate clear guidelines and\ndevelop simple analytic expressions, in order to achieve directed coherent\npopulation dynamics in artificial nano-structures.\n", "  Most centralities proposed for identifying influential spreaders on social\nnetworks to either spread a message or to stop an epidemic require the full\ntopological information of the network on which spreading occurs. In practice,\nhowever, collecting all connections between agents in social networks can be\nhardly achieved. As a result, such metrics could be difficult to apply to real\nsocial networks. Consequently, a new approach for identifying influential\npeople without the explicit network information is demanded in order to provide\nan efficient immunization or spreading strategy, in a practical sense. In this\nstudy, we seek a possible way for finding influential spreaders by using the\nsocial mechanisms of how social connections are formed in real networks. We\nfind that a reliable immunization scheme can be achieved by asking people how\nthey interact with each other. From these surveys we find that the\nprobabilistic tendency to connect to a hub has the strongest predictive power\nfor influential spreaders among tested social mechanisms. Our observation also\nsuggests that people who connect different communities is more likely to be an\ninfluential spreader when a network has a strong modular structure. Our finding\nimplies that not only the effect of network location but also the behavior of\nindividuals is important to design optimal immunization or spreading schemes.\n", "  Searches for both resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production are\nperformed in the $hh\\to bb\\tau\\tau, \\gamma\\gamma WW^*$ final states using 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded\nwith the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of their\nproduction is observed and 95\\% confidence level upper limits on the production\ncross sections are set. These results are then combined with the published\nresults of the $hh\\to \\gamma\\gamma bb, bbbb$ analyses. An upper limit of 0.69\n(0.47) pb on the non-resonant Standard Model like $hh$ production is observed\n(expected), corresponding to 70 (48) times of the SM $gg\\to hh$ cross section.\nFor production via narrow resonances, cross section limits of $hh$ production\nfrom a heavy Higgs boson decay are set as a function of the heavy Higgs boson\nmass. The observed (expected) limits range from 2.1 (1.1) pb at 260 GeV to\n0.011 (0.018) pb at 1000 GeV. These results are interpreted in the context of\ntwo simplified scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.\n", "  In this letter we show that there emerges a gauge field for two attractive\nparticles moving on a curved surface when they form a chiral bound state. By\nsolving a two-body problem on a sphere, we show explicitly that the\ncenter-of-mass wave functions of such deeply bound states are monopole\nharmonics instead of spherical harmonics. This indicates that the bound state\nexperiences a gauge field identical to a magnetic monopole at the center of the\nsphere, with the monopole charge equal to the quantized relative angular\nmomentum of this bound state. We show that this emergent gauge field is due to\nthe coupling between the center-of-mass and the relative motion on curved\nsurfaces. Our results can be generalized to an arbitrary curved surface where\nthe emergent magnetic field is exactly the local Gaussian curvature. This\nresult establishes an intriguing connection between space curvature and gauge\nfield, paves an alternative way to engineer topological state with space\ncurvature, and may be observed in cold atom system.\n", "  Quantum technologies will ultimately require manipulating many-body quantum\nsystems with high precision. Cold atom experiments represent a stepping stone\nin that direction: a high degree of control has been achieved on systems of\nincreasing complexity, however, this control is still sub-optimal. Optimal\ncontrol theory is the ideal candidate to bridge the gap between early stage and\noptimal experimental protocols, particularly since it was extended to encompass\nmany-body quantum dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate optimal control\napplied to two dynamical processes subject to interactions: the coherent\nmanipulation of motional states of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate and the\ncrossing of a quantum phase transition in small systems of cold atoms in\noptical lattices. We show theoretically that these transformations can be made\nfast and robust with respect to perturbations, including temperature and atom\nnumber fluctuations, resulting in a good agreement between theoretical\npredictions and experimental results.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the creation of squeezed states of a\nBose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) trapped in a magnetic double well potential. The\nnumber or phase squeezed states are created by modulating the tunnel coupling\nbetween the two wells periodically with twice the Josephson frequency, i.e.,\nthrough parametric amplification. Simulations are performed with the multi\nconfigurational Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). We employ optimal control\ntheory to bring the condensate to a complete halt at a final time, thus\ncreating a highly squeezed state (squeezing factor of 0.12, $\\xi_S^2=-18$ dB)\nsuitable for atom interferometry.\n", "  We write the Dirac equation in curved 4-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime\nusing concepts from the analysis of partial differential equations as opposed\nto geometric concepts.\n", "  This paper was given to mark the centenary of the death of David Gill, the\nforemost British astronomer in the last quarter of the 19th century and into\nthe 20th century. Gill abandoned a successful career as a clock and watchmaker.\nHis speciality was in astrometry, an area of astronomy of both practical and\nscientific importance that tended to be eclipsed in the 20th century by the\nrise of astrophysics. As Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope for\n27 years, David Gill was admired for his prolific contribution to highly\naccurate and trustworthy results. David Gill's collaboration was desired by\nleading astronomers of the day and he was the only southern hemisphere\nrepresentative on the hugely important Conference Internationale des Etoiles\nFondamentales of 1896. He created with Jacobus Kapteyn the first extensive star\ncatalogue derived from photographic plates (the CPD), including over 450,000\nstars. He was an initiator of the biggest multi-national and multi-observatory\nproject of the century, taking on the role of President of the International\nCommission overseeing the Carte du Ciel project. David Gill raised the Cape of\nGood Hope observatory from a rather run-down jobbing observatory of the\nAdmiralty to the best observatory in the Southern hemisphere. He acquired in\nthe process the reputation of an expert in precision instrument design. He also\nmade a substantial name for himself as semi-official director of the geodetic\nsurvey of South Africa. Overall David Gill was highly influential, respected\nand well liked. With the resurgence of interest in astrometry, the contribution\nof David Gill to astronomy is due for a re-assessment a century after he died.\n", "  The structure of a sentence can be represented as a network where vertices\nare words and edges indicate syntactic dependencies. Interestingly, crossing\nsyntactic dependencies have been observed to be infrequent in human languages.\nThis leads to the question of whether the scarcity of crossings in languages\narises from an independent and specific constraint on crossings. We provide\nstatistical evidence suggesting that this is not the case, as the proportion of\ndependency crossings of sentences from a wide range of languages can be\naccurately estimated by a simple predictor based on a null hypothesis on the\nlocal probability that two dependencies cross given their lengths. The relative\nerror of this predictor never exceeds 5% on average, whereas the error of a\nbaseline predictor assuming a random ordering of the words of a sentence is at\nleast 6 times greater. Our results suggest that the low frequency of crossings\nin natural languages is neither originated by hidden knowledge of language nor\nby the undesirability of crossings per se, but as a mere side effect of the\nprinciple of dependency length minimization.\n", "  Understanding the fundamental limits on the precision to which an optical\nphase can be estimated is of key interest for many investigative techniques\nutilized across science and technology. We study the estimation of a fixed\noptical phase shift due to a sample which has an associated optical loss, and\ncompare phase estimation strategies using classical and non-classical probe\nstates. These comparisons are based on the attainable (quantum) Fisher\ninformation calculated per number of photons absorbed or scattered by the\nsample throughout the sensing process. We find that, for a given number of\nincident photons upon the unknown phase, non-classical techniques in principle\nprovide less than a 20% reduction in root-mean-square-error (RMSE) in\ncomparison with ideal classical techniques in multi-pass optical setups. Using\nclassical techniques in a new optical setup we analyze, which incorporates\nadditional stages of interference during the sensing process, the achievable\nreduction in RMSE afforded by non-classical techniques falls to only ~4%. We\nexplain how these conclusions change when non-classical techniques are compared\nto classical probe states in non-ideal multi-pass optical setups, with\nadditional photon losses due to the measurement apparatus.\n", "  The purpose of the present work is twofold. First, we develop the theory of\ngeneral self-similar growth-fragmentation processes by focusing on martingales\nwhich appear naturally in this setting and by recasting classical results for\nbranching random walks in this framework. In particular, we establish\nmany-to-one formulas for growth-fragmentations and define the notion of\nintrinsic area of a growth-fragmentation. Second, we identify a distinguished\nfamily of growth-fragmentations closely related to stable L\\'evy processes,\nwhich are then shown to arise as the scaling limit of the perimeter process in\nMarkovian explorations of certain random planar maps with large degrees (which\nare, roughly speaking, the dual maps of the stable maps of Le Gall & Miermont.\nAs a consequence of this result, we are able to identify the law of the\nintrinsic area of these distinguished growth-fragmentations. This generalizes a\ngeometric connection between large Boltzmann triangulations and a certain\ngrowth-fragmentation process, which was established in arXiv:1507.02265 .\n", "  The development of the new RFQ Cooler, called SHIRaC, was carried out. As a\npart of SPIRAL 2 facility, SHIRaC aims to handle and cool typical SPIRAL 2\nbeams with large emittances (up to 80 pi.mm.mrad) and high currents (up to 1\nuA). Its purposes are to enhance as much as possible the beam quality\n(transverse geometric emittance of less than 3 pi.mm.mrad and longitudinal\nenergy spread close to 1 eV) and to transmit more than 60 % of ions.\n  Numerical simulations and experimental studies have shown that the required\nbeam quality can be reached only in term of the emittance. The energy spread is\nvery far from expected values. It is sensitive to the space charge and the\nbuffer gas diffusion and more importantly to the RF field derivative effect.\nThe latter arises at the RFQ exit and increases with the RF parameters (the\nfrequency and the amplitude of the RF voltage).\n  Studies allowing to enhance the cooled beam quality, mainly the energy spread\nreduction, are presented and discussed along this paper. They consist in\nimplementing a miniature RFQ at the RFQ exit. Using this method, it becomes\npossible to improve the cooled beam quality and to reach 1 eV of longitudinal\nenergy spread and around 1.75 {\\pi}.mm.mrad of transverse geometric emittance\nfor beam currents going up to 1 uA.\n  The transport of the cooled beam from SHIRaC towards a HRS has been done with\nan electrostatic quadrupole triplet. Simulations and first experimental tests\nshowed that more than 95 % of cooled beams can reach the HRS.\n  Finally, developments related to the nuclearization protection methods aiming\nto avoid the escape of any nuclear matter from the SHIRaC beamline are studied.\n", "  We consider novel implementation of quantum teleportation protocol of unknown\nqubit with entangled hybrid state. Coherent components of the entangled hybrid\nstate displace the teleported qubit at the same absolute but opposite in sign\nvalues, so that any information about amount by which the qubit is displaced is\nlost despite the fact that one of these events has definitely occurred. Alice\nunambiguously distinguishes her measurement outcomes and Bob obtains at his\ndisposal states of a single photon in superposition of two modes with\ncontrollable amplitude distortions. We consider the implementation of this\nprotocol with a third participant who off-line prepares amplitude modulated\nunknown qubits and hand them to Alice for teleportation. In this\ninterpretation, the success probability of the teleportation depends on the\nabsolute value of the amplitude of the unknown qubit. In particular, highly\nunbalanced unknown qubits can be teleported with success probability close to\none. We also consider some ways of demodulating amplitude modulated states by\nthe receiver in order to increase the success probability of the teleportation\nof unknown qubits.\n", "  In the framework of certain general probability theories of single systems,\nwe identify various nonclassical features such as incompatibility, multiple\npure-state decomposability, measurement disturbance, no-cloning and the\nimpossibility of certain universal operations, with the non-simpliciality of\nthe state space. This is shown to naturally suggest an underlying simplex as an\nontological model. Contextuality turns out to be an independent nonclassical\nfeature, arising from the intransitivity of compatibility.\n", "  In this article we present a numerical study of the dynamics of two disks\nsettling in a narrow vertical channel filled with Oldroyd-B fluid. Two kinds of\nparticle dynamics are obtained: (i) periodic interaction between two disks and\n(ii) the chain formation of two disks. For the periodic interaction of two\ndisks, two different motions are obtained: (a) two disks stay far apart and\ninteract periodically and (b) two disks interact closely and then far apart in\na periodic way, like the drafting, kissing and tumbling of two disks\nsedimenting in Newtonian fluid, due to the lack of strong enough elastic force.\nFor the formation of two disk chain occurred at higher values of the elasticity\nnumber, it is either a tilted chain or a vertical chain. The tilted chain can\nbe obtained for either that the elasticity number is less than the critical\nvalue for having the vertical chain or that the Mach number is greater than the\ncritical value for a long body to fall broadside-on. Hence the values of the\nelasticity number and the Mach number determine whether the the chain can be\nformed and the orientation of the chain.\n", "  We report 13 high-precision light curves of eight transits of the exoplanet\nWASP-52b, obtained by using four medium-class telescopes, through different\nfilters, and adopting the defocussing technique. One transit was recorded\nsimultaneously from two different observatories and another one from the same\nsite but with two different instruments, including a multi-band camera.\nAnomalies were clearly detected in five light curves and modelled as starspots\nocculted by the planet during the transit events. We fitted the clean light\ncurves with the jktebop code, and those with the anomalies with the prism+gemc\ncodes in order to simultaneously model the photometric parameters of the\ntransits and the position, size and contrast of each starspot. We used these\nnew light curves and some from the literature to revise the physical properties\nof the WASP-52 system. Starspots with similar characteristics were detected in\nfour transits over a period of 43 days. In the hypothesis that we are dealing\nwith the same starspot, periodically occulted by the transiting planet, we\nestimated the projected orbital obliquity of WASP-52b to be lambda = 3.8 \\pm\n8.4 degree. We also determined the true orbital obliquity, psi = 20 \\pm 50\ndegree, which is, although very uncertain, the first measurement of psi purely\nfrom starspot crossings. We finally assembled an optical transmission spectrum\nof the planet and searched for variations of its radius as a function of\nwavelength. Our analysis suggests a flat transmission spectrum within the\nexperimental uncertainties.\n", "  Motivated by the simple toroidal compactification of extra-dimensional SUSY\ntheories, we investigate on a partially $N=2$ supersymmetric (SUSY) extension\nof the standard model which has an $N=2$ SUSY sector and an $N=1$ SUSY sector.\nWe point out that below the scale of the partially breaking of $N=2$ to $N=1$,\nthe ratio of Yukawa to gauge couplings embedded in the original $N=2$ gauge\ninteraction in the $N=2$ sector becomes greater due to a fixed point. Since at\nthe partially breaking scale the sfermion masses in the $N=2$ sector is\nsuppressed due to the $N=2$ non-renormalization theorem, the anomaly mediation\neffect becomes important. If dominant, the anomaly induced masses for the\nsfermions in the $N=2$ sector are almost UV-insensitive due to the fixed point.\nInterestingly, these masses are always positive, i.e. no tachyonic slepton\nproblem. From an example model, we show interesting phenomena differing from\nthe ordinary MSSM. In particular, the dark matter can be a sbino, i.e. the\nscalar component of the $N=2$ vector multiplet of $\\rm U(1)_Y$. To obtain the\ncorrect dark matter abundance, the mass of sbino, as well as the MSSM\nsparticles in the $N=2$ sector which have a typical mass pattern of anomaly\nmediation, is required to be small. Therefore, this scenario can be tested and\nconfirmed in the LHC and may be further confirmed by the measurement of the\n$N=2$ Yukawa couplings in future colliders. This model can explain dark matter,\nmuon $g-2$ anomaly, gauge coupling unification and relaxes some ordinary\nproblems within the MSSM. Also, it is compatible with thermal leptogenesis.\n", "  The idea of renormalization and scale invariance is pervasive across\ndisciplines. It has not only drawn numerous surprising connections between\nphysical systems under the guise of holographic duality, but has also inspired\nthe development of wavelet theory now widely used in signal processing.\nSynergizing on these two developments, we describe in this paper a generalized\nexact holographic mapping that maps a generic N-dimensional lattice system to a\nN+1-dimensional holographic dual, with the emergent dimension representing\nscale. In previous works, this was achieved via the iterations of the simplest\nof all unitary mappings, the Haar mapping, which fails to preserve the form of\nmost Hamiltonians. By taking advantage of the full generality of biorthogonal\nwavelets, our new generalized holographic mapping framework is able to preserve\nthe form of a large class of lattice Hamiltonians. By explicitly separating\nfeatures that are fundamentally associated with the physical system from those\nthat are basis-specific, we also obtain a clearer understanding of how the\nresultant bulk geometry arises. For instance, the number of nonvanishing\nmoments of the high pass wavelet filter is revealed to be proportional to the\nradius of the dual Anti deSitter (AdS) space geometry. We conclude by proposing\nmodifications to the mapping for systems with generic Fermi pockets.\n", "  The theory of quantum games permits players to choose strategies that prepare\nand measure quantum states. Whereas conventional game theory provides\nguarantees for fixed-point stability in non-cooperative games, so-called Nash\nequilibria, we find this guarantee is not provided for quantum games. In\nparticular, we show the conditions for Glickberg's fixed-point theorem do not\napply to pure quantum games when the payoff is a physical observable. We\nfurther show that Nash equilibrium can be guaranteed when the payoff is defined\nwith respect to state preparation.\n", "  We investigated the transient relaxation of a Discontinuous Shear Thickening\nsuspension of cornstarch in water. We performed 2 types of relaxation\nexperiments starting from a steady shear in a parallel plate rheometer,\nfollowed by either stopping the top plate rotation and measuring the transient\ntorque relaxation, or removing the torque on the plate and measuring the\ntransient tool rotation. We found that at low weight fraction\n$\\phi_{eff}<58.8\\pm0.4\\%$, the suspensions exhibited a relaxation behavior\nconsistent with a generalized Newtonian fluid. However, for larger weight\nfraction $58.8\\% < \\phi_{eff} < 61.0\\%$, near the liquid-solid transition\n$\\phi_c=61.0\\pm0.7\\%$, we found relaxation behaviors different from the\ngeneralized Newtonian model. The relaxation time in this range scales with the\ninverse of the critical shear rate at the onset of shear thickening. In this\nrange the relaxation time was the same in both stress and rate controlled\nexperiments, rather than the viscosity calculated from the relaxation time\nwhich is expected to be intrinsic material parameter in the generalized\nNewtonian model. The discrepancy between the measured relaxation times and the\ngeneralized Newtonian prediction was found to be up to $10^4$, and\nextrapolations diverge in the limit of $\\phi_c$ as the generalized Newtonian\nprediction approaches 0. At the highest weight fractions, the relaxation time\nscales were measured to be on the order of $\\sim 1$ s. The fact that this\ntimescale is resolvable by the naked eye may be important to understanding some\nof the dynamic phenomenon commonly observed in these systems. We also showed\nthat using the critical shear rate $\\dot\\gamma_c$ at the onset of shear\nthickening to characterize the effective weight fraction can more precisely\ncharacterize material properties near the critical point $\\phi_c$, allowing us\nto resolve this transition so close to $\\phi_c$.\n", "  We study interplay between confinement/deconfinement and chiral properties.\nWe derive some analytical relations of the Dirac modes with the confinement\nquantities, such as the Polyakov loop, its susceptibility and the string\ntension. For the confinement quantities, the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes are\nfound to give negligible contribution, while they are essential for chiral\nsymmetry breaking. This indicates no direct, one-to-one correspondence between\nconfinement/deconfinement and chiral properties in QCD. We also investigate the\nPolyakov loop in terms of the eigenmodes of the Wilson, the clover and the\ndomain-wall fermion kernels, respectively.\n", "  What are topological phases of matter? First, they are phases of matter at\nzero temperature. Second, they have a non-zero energy gap for the excitations\nabove the ground state. Third, they are disordered liquids that seem have no\nfeature. But those disordered liquids actually can have rich patterns of\nmany-body entanglement representing new kinds of order. This paper will give a\nsimple introduction and a brief survey of topological phases of matter. We will\nfirst discuss topological phases that have topological order (ie with long\nrange entanglement). Then we will cover topological phases that have no\ntopological order (ie with only short-range entanglement).\n", "  The influence of wave function symmetry on statistical correlation is studied\nfor the case of three non-interacting spin-free quantum particles in a\nunidimensional box, in position and in momentum space. Higher-order statistical\ncorrelations occurring among the three particles in this quantum system is\nquantified via higher-order mutual information and compared to the correlation\nbetween pairs of variables in this model, and to the correlation in the\ntwo-particle system. The results for the higher-order mutual information show\nthat there are states where the symmetric wave functions are more correlated\nthan the antisymmetric ones with same quantum numbers. This holds in position\nas well as in momentum space. This behavior is opposite to that observed for\nthe correlation between pairs of variables in this model, and the two-particle\nsystem, where the antisymmetric wave functions are in general more correlated.\nThese results are also consistent with those observed in a system of three\nuncoupled oscillators. The use of higher-order mutual information as a\ncorrelation measure, is monitored and examined by considering a superposition\nof states or systems with two Slater determinants.\n", "  We present a study of optical quantum states generated by subtraction of\nphotons from the thermal state. Some aspects of their photon number and\nquadrature distributions are discussed and checked experimentally. We\ndemonstrate an original method of up to ten photon subtracted state preparation\nwith use of just one single-photon detector. All the states where measured with\nuse of balanced homodyne technique, and the corresponding density matrices\nwhere reconstructed. The fidelity between desired and reconstructed states\nexceeds 99%\n", "  Nonequilibrium quasiparticles represent a significant source of decoherence\nin superconducting quantum circuits. Here we investigate the mechanism of\nquasiparticle poisoning in devices subjected to local quasiparticle injection.\nWe find that quasiparticle poisoning is dominated by the propagation of\npair-breaking phonons across the chip. We characterize the energy dependence of\nthe timescale for quasiparticle poisoning. Finally, we observe that\nincorporation of extensive normal metal quasiparticle traps leads to a more\nthan order of magnitude reduction in quasiparticle loss for a given injected\nquasiparticle power.\n", "  A novel method to obtain hierarchical and overlapping clusters from network\ndata -i.e., a set of nodes endowed with pairwise dissimilarities- is presented.\nThe introduced method is hierarchical in the sense that it outputs a nested\ncollection of groupings of the node set depending on the resolution or degree\nof similarity desired, and it is overlapping since it allows nodes to belong to\nmore than one group. Our construction is rooted on the facts that a\nhierarchical (non-overlapping) clustering of a network can be equivalently\nrepresented by a finite ultrametric space and that a convex combination of\nultrametrics results in a cut metric. By applying a hierarchical\n(non-overlapping) clustering method to multiple dithered versions of a given\nnetwork and then convexly combining the resulting ultrametrics, we obtain a cut\nmetric associated to the network of interest. We then show how to extract a\nhierarchical overlapping clustering structure from the aforementioned cut\nmetric. Furthermore, the so-called overlapping function is presented as a tool\nfor gaining insights about the data by identifying meaningful resolutions of\nthe obtained hierarchical structure. Additionally, we explore hierarchical\noverlapping quasi-clustering methods that preserve the asymmetry of the data\ncontained in directed networks. Finally, the presented method is illustrated\nvia synthetic and real-world classification problems including handwritten\ndigit classification and authorship attribution of famous plays.\n", "  The goal of this report is to give a comprehensive overview of the rich field\nof forward physics, with a special attention to the topics that can be studied\nat the LHC. The report starts presenting a selection of the Monte Carlo\nsimulation tools currently available, chapter 2, then enters the rich\nphenomenology of QCD at low, chapter 3, and high, chapter 4, momentum transfer,\nwhile the unique scattering conditions of central exclusive production are\nanalyzed in chapter 5. The last two experimental topics, Cosmic Ray and Heavy\nIon physics are presented in the chapter 6 and 7 respectively. Chapter 8 is\ndedicated to the BFKL dynamics, multiparton interactions, and saturation. The\nreport ends with an overview of the forward detectors at LHC. Each chapter is\ncorrelated with a comprehensive bibliography, attempting to provide to the\ninterested reader with a wide opportunity for further studies.\n", "  We develop an approximation formula for the cross-validation error (CVE) of a\nsparse linear regression penalized by $\\ell_1$-norm and total variation terms,\nwhich is based on a perturbative expansion utilizing the largeness of both the\ndata dimensionality and the model. The developed formula allows us to reduce\nthe necessary computational cost of the CVE evaluation significantly. The\npracticality of the formula is tested through application to simulated\nblack-hole image reconstruction on the event-horizon scale with super\nresolution. The results demonstrate that our approximation reproduces the CVE\nvalues obtained via literally conducted cross-validation with reasonably good\nprecision.\n", "  In this work, we propose a flexible architecture of microwave resonators with\ntunable couplings to perform quantum simulations of problems from the field of\nmolecular chemistry. The architecture builds on the experience of the D-Wave\ndesign, working with nearly harmonic circuits instead of qubits. This\narchitecture, or modifications of it, can be used to emulate molecular\nprocesses such as vibronic transitions. Furthermore, we discuss several aspects\nof these emulations, such as dynamical ranges of the physical parameters,\nquenching times necessary for diabaticity, and, finally, the possibility of\nimplementing anharmonic corrections to the force fields by exploiting certain\nnonlinear features of superconducting devices.\n", "  Experimentally measuring the elastic properties of thin biological surfaces\nis non-trivial, particularly when they are curved. One technique that may be\nused is the indentation of a thin sheet of material by a rigid indenter, whilst\nmeasuring the applied force and displacement. This gives immediate information\non the fracture strength of the material (from the force required to puncture),\nbut it is also theoretically possible to determine the elastic properties by\ncomparing the resulting force-displacement curves with a mathematical model.\nExisting mathematical studies generally assume that the elastic surface is\ninitially flat, which is often not the case for biological membranes. We\npreviously outlined a theory for the indentation of curved isotropic,\nincompressible, hyperelastic membranes (with no bending stiffness) which breaks\ndown for highly curved surfaces, as the entire membrane becomes wrinkled. Here\nwe introduce the effect of bending stiffness, ensuring that energy is required\nto change the shell shape without stretching, and find that commonly neglected\nterms in the shell equilibrium equation must be included. The theory presented\nhere allows for the estimation of shape- and size-independent elastic\nproperties of highly curved surfaces via indentation experiments, and is\nparticularly relevant for biological surfaces.\n", "  We apply modern techniques from quantum optics and quantum information\nscience to Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) in order to study, for the first\ntime, the quantum decoherence of phonons of isolated BECs. In the last few\nyears, major advances in the manipulation and control of phonons have\nhighlighted their potential as carriers of quantum information in quantum\ntechnologies, particularly in quantum processing and quantum communication.\nAlthough most of these studies have focused on trapped ion and crystalline\nsystems, another promising system that has remained relatively unexplored is\nBECs. The potential benefits in using this system have been emphasized recently\nwith proposals of relativistic quantum devices that exploit quantum states of\nphonons in BECs to achieve, in principle, superior performance over standard\nnon-relativistic devices. Quantum decoherence is often the limiting factor in\nthe practical realization of quantum technologies, but here we show that\nquantum decoherence of phonons is not expected to heavily constrain the\nperformance of these proposed relativistic quantum devices.\n", "  The Extended Fermi-Hubbard model is a rather studied Hamiltonian due to both\nits many applications and a rich phase diagram. Here we prove that all the\nphase transitions encoded in its one dimensional version are detectable via\nnon-local operators related to charge and spin fluctuations. The main advantage\nin using them is that, in contrast to usual local operators, their asymptotic\naverage value is finite only in the appropriate gapped phases. This makes them\npowerful and accurate probes to detect quantum phase transitions. Our results\nindeed confirm that they are able to properly capture both the nature and the\nlocation of the transitions. Relevantly, this happens also for conducting\nphases with a spin gap, thus providing an order parameter for the\nidentification of superconducting and paired superfluid phases\n", "  We present final statistics from a survey for intervening MgII absorption\ntowards 100 quasars with emission redshifts between $z=3.55$ and $z=7.08$.\nUsing infrared spectra from Magellan/FIRE, we detect 279 cosmological MgII\nabsorbers, and confirm that the incidence rate of $W_r>0.3 \\AA$ MgII absorption\nper comoving path length does not evolve measurably between $z=0.25$ and $z=7$.\nThis is consistent with our detection of seven new MgII systems at $z>6$, a\nredshift range that was not covered in prior searches. Restricting to\nrelatively strong MgII systems ($W_r>1$\\AA), there is significant evidence for\nredshift evolution. These systems roughly double in number density between\n$z=0$ and $z=2$-$3$, but decline by an order of magnitude from this peak by\n$z\\sim 6$. This evolution mirrors that of the global star formation rate\ndensity, which could reflect a connection between star formation feedback and\nstrong MgII absorbers. We compared our results to the Illustris cosmological\nsimulation at $z=2$-$4$ by assigning absorption to catalogued dark-matter halos\nand by direct extraction of spectra from the simulation volume. To reproduce\nour results using the halo catalogs, we require circumgalactic (CGM) MgII\nenvelopes within halos of progressively smaller mass at earlier times. This\noccurs naturally if we define the lower integration cutoff using SFR rather\nthan mass. MgII profiles calculated directly from the Illustris volume yield\nfar too few strong absorbers. We argue that this arises from unresolved phase\nspace structure of CGM gas, particularly from turbulent velocities on sub-mesh\nscales. The presence of CGM MgII at $z>6$-- just $\\sim 250$ Myr after the\nreionization redshift implied by Planck--suggests that enrichment of intra-halo\ngas may have begun before the presumed host galaxies' stellar populations were\nmature and dynamically relaxed. [abridged]\n", "  The Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture states that for generic initial data\nto Einstein's field equations, the maximal globally hyperbolic development is\ninextendible. We prove this conjecture in the class of orthogonal Bianchi class\nB perfect fluids and vacuum spacetimes, by showing that unboundedness of\ncertain curvature invariants such as the Kretschmann scalar is a generic\nproperty. The only spacetimes where this scalar remains bounded exhibit local\nrotational symmetry or are of plane wave equilibrium type.\n  We further investigate the qualitative behaviour of solutions towards the\ninitial singularity. To this end, we work in the expansion-normalised variables\nintroduced by Hewitt-Wainwright and show that a set of full measure, which is\nalso a countable intersection of open and dense sets in the state space, yields\nconvergence to a specific subarc of the Kasner parabola. We further give an\nexplicit construction enabling the translation between these variables and\ngeometric initial data to Einstein's equations.\n", "  The decays of $\\chi_{c2}\\to K^{+}K^{-}\\pi^{0}$, $K_{S} K^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$ and\n$\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{0}$ are studied with the $\\psi(3686)$ data samples\ncollected with the Beijing Spectrometer (BESIII). For the first time, the\nbranching fractions of $\\chi_{c2}\\to K^{\\ast}\\overline{K}$, $\\chi_{c2}\\to\na_{2}^{\\pm}(1320)\\pi^{\\mp}/a_{2}^{0}(1320)\\pi^{0}$ and $\\chi_{c2}\\to\n\\rho(770)^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$ are measured. Here $K^{\\ast}\\overline{K}$ denotes\nboth $K^{\\ast\\pm}K^{\\mp}$ and $K^{\\ast 0}\\overline{K}{}^{0}+c.c.$, and\n$K^{\\ast}$ denotes the resonances $K^{\\ast}(892)$, $K^{\\ast}_{2}(1430)$ and\n$K^{\\ast}_{3}(1780)$. The observations indicate a strong violation of the\nhelicity selection rule in $\\chi_{c2}$ decays into vector and pseudoscalar\nmeson pairs. The measured branching fractions of $\\chi_{c2}\\to\nK^{\\ast}(892)\\overline{K}$ are more than 10 times larger than the upper limit\nof $\\chi_{c2}\\to \\rho(770)^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$, which is so far the first direct\nobservation of a significant $U$-spin symmetry breaking effect in charmonium\ndecays.\n", "  We predict a strong-field ultrafast optical Faraday effect, where a\ncircularly polarized ultrashort optical pulse induces transient chirality in an\nachiral transparent dielectric. This effect is attractive for time-resolved\nmeasurements because it gives access to the non-instantaneity of the nonlinear\nmedium response, and also because it represents relaxation of time-reversal\nsymmetry by all-optical means. We propose probing the induced transient\nchirality with a weak linearly polarized ultraviolet pulse that is shorter than\nthe near-infrared pump pulse. The predicted effects are ultrafast: the induced\nchirality vanishes for probe delays exceeding the duration of the near-infrared\npulse. This opens up possibilities for applications in ultrafast\ncircular-polarization modulators and analyzers.\n", "  We study the early-universe cosmology of a Kaluza-Klein (KK) tower of scalar\nfields in the presence of a mass-generating phase transition, focusing on the\ntime-development of the total tower energy density (or relic abundance) as well\nas its distribution across the different KK modes. We find that both of these\nfeatures are extremely sensitive to the details of the phase transition and can\nbehave in a variety of ways significant for late-time cosmology. In particular,\nwe find that the interplay between the temporal properties of the phase\ntransition and the mixing it generates are responsible for both enhancements\nand suppressions in the late-time abundances, sometimes by many orders of\nmagnitude. We map out the complete model parameter space and determine where\ntraditional analytical approximations are valid and where they fail. In the\nlatter cases we also provide new analytical approximations which successfully\nmodel our results. Finally, we apply this machinery to the example of an\naxion-like field in the bulk, mapping these phenomena over an enlarged axion\nparameter space that extends beyond those accessible to standard treatments. An\nimportant by-product of our analysis is the development of an alternate\n\"UV-based\" effective truncation of KK theories which has a number of\ninteresting theoretical properties that distinguish it from the more\ntraditional \"IR-based\" truncation typically used in the extra-dimension\nliterature.\n", "  Light WIMPs are dark matter particle candidates with weak scale interaction\nwith the known particles, and mass in the GeV to 10's of GeV range. Hints of\nlight WIMPs have appeared in several dark matter searches in the last decade.\nThe unprecedented possible coincidence into tantalizingly close regions of mass\nand cross section of four separate direct detection experimental hints and a\npotential indirect detection signal in gamma rays from the galactic center,\naroused considerable interest in our field. Even if these hints did not so far\nresult in a discovery, they have had a significant impact in our field. Here we\nreview the evidence for and against light WIMPs as dark matter candidates and\ndiscuss future relevant experiments and observations\n", "  We present results of three-dimensional, multi-physics simulations of an AGN\njet colliding with an intergalactic cloud. The purpose of these simulations is\nto assess the degree of \"positive feedback,\" i.e. jet-induced star formation,\nthat results. We have specifically tailored our simulation parameters to\nfacilitate comparison with recent observations of Minkowski's Object (M.O.), a\nstellar nursery located at the termination point of a radio jet coming from\ngalaxy NGC 541. As shown in our simulations, such a collision triggers shocks\nwhich propagate around and through the cloud. These shocks condense the gas and\nunder the right circumstances may trigger cooling instabilities, creating\nrunaway increases in density, to the point that individual clumps can become\nJeans unstable. Our simulations provide information about the expected star\nformation rate, total mass converted to \\ion{H}{1}, H$_2$, and stars, and the\nrelative velocity of the stars and gas. Our results confirm the possibility of\njet-induced star formation, and agree well with the observations of M.O.\n", "  A radiative mechanism is proposed for magnetic flares near luminous accreting\nblack holes. It is based on recent first-principle simulations of magnetic\nreconnection, which show a hierarchical chain of fast-moving plasmoids. The\nreconnection occurs in a compact region (comparable to the black hole radius),\nand the chain experiences fast Compton cooling accompanied by electron-positron\npair creation. The distribution of plasmoid speeds is shaped by radiative\nlosses, and the self-regulated chain radiates its energy in hard X-rays. The\nmechanism is illustrated by Monte-Carlo simulations of the transfer of seed\nsoft photons through the reconnection layer. The emerging radiation spectrum\nhas a cutoff near 100 keV similar to the hard-state spectra of X-ray binaries\nand AGN. We discuss how the chain cooling differs from previous\nphenomenological emission models, and suggest that it can explain the hard\nX-ray activity of accreting black holes from first principles. Particles\naccelerated at the X-points of the chain produce an additional high-energy\ncomponent, explaining \"hybrid Comptonization\" observed in Cyg X-1.\n", "  We use EAGLE to quantify the effect galaxy mergers have on the stellar\nspecific angular momentum of galaxies, $j_{\\rm stars}$. We split mergers into:\ndry (gas-poor)/wet (gas-rich), major/minor, and different spin alignments and\norbital parameters. Wet (dry) mergers have an average neutral gas-to-stellar\nmass ratio of $1.1$ ($0.02$), while major (minor) mergers are those with\nstellar mass ratios $\\ge 0.3$ ($0.1-0.3$). We correlate the positions of\ngalaxies in the $j_{\\rm stars}$-stellar mass plane at $z=0$ with their merger\nhistory, and find that galaxies of low spins suffered dry mergers, while\ngalaxies of normal/high spins suffered predominantly wet mergers, if any. The\nradial $j_{\\rm stars}$ profiles of galaxies that went through dry mergers are\ndeficient by $\\approx 0.3$~dex at $r\\lesssim 10\\,r_{50}$ (with $r_{50}$ being\nthe half-stellar mass radius), compared to galaxies that went through wet\nmergers. Studying the merger remnants reveals that dry mergers reduce $j_{\\rm\nstars}$ by $\\approx 30$\\%, while wet mergers increase it by $\\approx 10$\\%, on\naverage. The latter is connected to the build-up of the bulge by newly formed\nstars of high rotational speed. Moving from minor to major mergers accentuates\nthese effects. When the spin vectors of the galaxies prior to the dry merger\nare misaligned, $j_{\\rm stars}$ decreases to a greater magnitude, while in wet\nmergers co-rotation and high orbital angular momentum efficiently spun-up\ngalaxies. We predict what would be the observational signatures in the $j_{\\rm\nstars}$ profiles driven by dry mergers: (i) shallow radial profiles and (ii)\nprofiles that rise beyond $\\approx 10\\,r_{50}$, both of which are significantly\ndifferent from spiral galaxies.\n", "  We present an analysis of archival ISO observations of pure-rotational lines\nof H2 in three pointings in the central 3 parsecs of the Galaxy: toward the\nSouthwest region and Northeast region of the Galactic center Circumnuclear\nDisk, and toward the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. We detect pure rotational\nlines from 0-0 S(0) to S(13), as well as a number of rovibrationally excited\ntransitions. From the pure rotational lines, we are able to describe the\nmolecular gas with three discrete temperature components: a `hot' component\nbetween 500-600 K, a `hotter' component at 1250-1350 K, and a `hottest'\ncomponent at > 2600 K. Toward Sgr A*, likely due to a combination of poorer\nbaselines and weaker emission, we only detect a single hot component, at 1100\nK. The observed excitation is consistent with heating via C-shocks. We also fit\na continuous temperature distribution to the the S(1) through S(7) lines by\nassuming a power-law distribution of temperatures. We measure power law indices\nof n = 3.22 for the Northeast region and n = 2.83 for the Southwest region,\nwith a smaller index indicating a higher fraction of warm gas. These indices\nare lower than those measured for other galaxies or other Galactic center\nclouds, which are measured to have n= 4-6. If we extrapolate this temperature\ndistribution down to a cutoff temperature of 50 K, then the total molecular gas\nmass that we would measure for the Southwest (Northeast) region is 32 (140) %\nof the total molecular gas mass inferred from the dust emission, and 26 (125) %\nof the total molecular gas mass inferred from the CO emission for these\nregions. Ultimately, we find that the disagreement in the amount of mass\nrecovered for these two regions means that this method cannot yet be verified\nto yield a reliable and independent estimate of the mass in the local region of\nthe Circumnuclear Disk.\n", "  We present ALMA and VLA detections of the dense molecular gas tracers HCN,\nHCO$^+$ and HNC in two lensed, high-redshift starbursts selected from the {\\it\nHerschel}-ATLAS survey: {\\it H}-ATLAS\\,J090740.0$-$004200 (SDP.9, $z \\sim 1.6$)\nand {\\it H}-ATLAS\\,J091043.1$-$000321 (SDP.11, $z \\sim 1.8$). ALMA observed the\n$J = 3-2$ transitions in both sources, while the VLA observed the $J = 1-0$\ntransitions in SDP.9. We have detected all observed HCN and HCO$^+$ lines in\nSDP.9 and SDP.11, and also HNC(3--2) in SDP.9. The amplification factors for\nboth galaxies have been determined from sub-arcsec resolution CO and dust\nemission observations carried out with NOEMA and the SMA. The\nHNC(1--0)/HCN(1--0) line ratio in SDP.9 suggests the presence of\nphoton-dominated regions, as it happens to most local (U)LIRGs. The CO, HCN and\nHCO$^+$ SLEDs of SDP.9 are compatible to those found for many local, infrared\n(IR) bright galaxies, indicating that the molecular gas in local and\nhigh-redshift dusty starbursts can have similar excitation conditions. We\nobtain that the correlation between total IR ($L_{\\rm IR}$) and dense line\n($L_{\\rm dense}$) luminosity in SDP.9 and SDP.11 and local star-forming\ngalaxies can be represented by a single relation. The scatter of the $L_{\\rm\nIR} - L_{\\rm dense}$ correlation, together with the lack of sensitive dense\nmolecular gas tracer observations for a homogeneous sample of high-redshift\ngalaxies, prevents us from distinguishing differential trends with redshift.\nOur results suggest that the intense star formation found in some high-redshift\ndusty, luminous starbursts is associated with more massive dense molecular gas\nreservoirs and higher dense molecular gas fractions.\n", "  If the very early Universe is dominated by the non-minimally coupled Higgs\nfield and Starobinsky's curvature-squared term together, the potential diagram\nwould mimic the landscape of a valley, serving as a cosmological attractor. The\ninflationary dynamics along this valley is studied, model parameters are\nconstrained against observational data, and the isocurvature perturbation is\nevaluated.\n", "  We investigate the dust distribution in the crescent disk around HD 142527\nbased on the continuum emission at $890 \\mathrm{\\ \\mu m}$ obtained by ALMA\nCycle 0. The map is divided into $18$ azimuthal sectors, and the radial\nintensity profile in each sector is reproduced with a 2D disk model. Our model\ntakes account of scattering and inclination of the disk as well as the\nazimuthal dependence in intensity. When the dust is assumed to have the\nconventional composition and maximum size of $1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, the northwestern\nregion ($PA=329^{\\circ}-29^{\\circ}$) cannot be reproduced. This is because the\nmodel intensity gets insensitive to the increase in surface density due to\nheavy self-scattering, reaching its ceiling much lower than the observed\nintensity. The ceiling depends on the position angle. When the scattering\nopacity is reduced by a factor of $10$, the intensity distribution is\nreproduced successfully in all the sectors including those in the northwestern\nregion. The best fit model parameters depend little on the scattering opacity\nin the southern region where the disk is optically thin. The contrast of dust\nsurface density along $PA$ is derived to be about $40$, much smaller than the\nvalue for the cases of conventional opacities ($70-130$). These results\nstrongly suggest that the albedo is lower than considered by some reasons at\nleast in the northwestern region.\n", "  It has been a long-standing problem how the transverse M5-branes are\ndescribed in the matrix-model formulations of M-theory. We consider this\nproblem for M-theory on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave geometry, which\nadmits transverse spherical M5-branes with zero light-cone energy. By using the\nlocalization, we directly analyze the strong coupling region of the\ncorresponding matrix theory called the plane wave matrix model (PWMM). Under\nthe assumption that the low energy modes of the scalar fields in PWMM become\nmutually commuting in the strong coupling region, we show that the eigenvalue\ndensity of the $SO(6)$ scalars in the low energy region exactly agrees with the\nshape of the spherical M5-branes in the decoupling limit. This result gives a\nstrong evidence that the transverse M5-branes are indeed contained in the\nmatrix theory and the theory realizes a second quantization of the M-theory.\n", "  We present a general form of Renormalization operator $\\mathcal{R}$ acting on\npotentials $V:\\{0,1\\}^\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We exhibit the analytical\nexpression of the fixed point potential $V$ for such operator $\\mathcal{R}$.\nThis potential can be expressed in a naturally way in terms of a certain\nintegral over the Hausdorff probability on a Cantor type set on the interval\n$[0,1]$. This result generalizes a previous one by A. Baraviera, R. Leplaideur\nand A. Lopes where the fixed point potential $V$ was of Hofbauer type.\n  For the potentials of Hofbauer type (a well known case of phase transition)\nthe decay is like $n^{-\\gamma}$, $\\gamma>0$.\n  Among other things we present the estimation of the decay of correlation of\nthe equilibrium probability associated to the fixed potential $V$ of our\ngeneral renormalization procedure. In some cases we get polynomial decay like\n$n^{-\\gamma}$, $\\gamma>0$, and in others a decay faster than $n \\,e^{ -\\,\n\\sqrt{n}}$, when $n \\to \\infty$.\n  The potentials $g$ we consider here are elements of the so called family of\nWalters potentials on $\\{0,1\\}^\\mathbb{N} $ which generalizes the potentials\nconsidered initially by F. Hofbauer. For these potentials some explicit\nexpressions for the eigenfunctions are known.\n  In a final section we also show that given any choice $d_n \\to 0$ of real\nnumbers varying with $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ there exist a potential $g$ on the\nclass defined by Walters which has a invariant probability with such numbers as\nthe coefficients of correlation (for a certain explicit observable function).\n", "  We apply the bosonization technique to derive the phase diagram of a balanced\nunit density two-component dipolar Fermi gas in a one dimensional lattice\ngeometry. The considered interaction processes are of the usual contact and\ndipolar long-range density-density type together with peculiar correlated\nhopping terms which can be generated dynamically. Rigorous bounds for the\ntransition lines are obtained in the weak coupling regime. In addition to the\nstandard bosonization description, we derive the low energy phase diagram\ntaking place when part of the interaction is embodied non-perturbatively in the\nsingle component Hamiltonians. In this case the Luttinger liquid regime is\nshown to become unstable with respect to the opening of further gapped phases,\namong which insulating bond ordered wave and Haldane phases, the latter with\ndegenerate edge modes.\n", "  A scheme for strong coupling between a single atomic spin and the rotational\nmode of levitating nanoparticles is proposed. The idea is based on spin\nread-out of NV centers embedded in aspherical nanodiamonds levitating in an ion\ntrap. We show that the asymmetry of the diamond induces a rotational\nconfinement in the ion trap. Using a weak homogeneous magnetic field and a\nstrong microwave driving we then demonstrate that the spin of the NV center can\nbe strongly coupled to the rotational motion of the diamond.\n", "  We consider the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation of quasi-equilibrium\nmagnons which leads to a spin superfluidity, the coherent quantum transfer of\nmagnetization in magnetic materials. These phenomena are beyond the classical\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert paradigm. The critical conditions for excited magnon\ndensity for ferro- and antiferromagnets, bulk and thin films are estimated and\ndiscussed. The BEC should occur in the antiferromagnetic hematite at much lower\nexcited magnon density compared to the ferromagnetic YIG.\n", "  The fraction of $J/\\psi$ mesons which come from B-meson decay,\n$\\textrm{F}_{B{\\rightarrow}J/\\psi}$, is measured for J/$\\psi$ rapidity\n\\mbox{$1.2<|y|<2.2$} and $p_T>0$ in $p$+$p$ and Cu+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV with the PHENIX detector. The extracted fraction is\n$\\textrm{F}_{B{\\rightarrow}J/\\psi}$ = 0.025 $\\pm$ 0.006(stat) $\\pm$ 0.010(syst)\nfor $p$+$p$ collisions. For Cu+Au collisions,\n$\\textrm{F}_{B{\\rightarrow}J/\\psi}$ is 0.094 $\\pm$ 0.028(stat) $\\pm$\n0.037(syst) in the Au-going direction ($-2.2<y<-1.2$) and 0.089 $\\pm$\n0.026(stat) $\\pm$ 0.040(syst) in the Cu-going direction ($1.2<y<2.2$). The\nnuclear modification factor, $R_{\\rm CuAu}$, of B mesons in Cu+Au collisions is\nconsistent with binary scaling of measured yields in $p$+$p$ at both forward\nand backward rapidity.\n", "  Many-degree-scale gamma-ray halos are expected to surround extragalactic\nhigh-energy gamma ray sources. These arise from the inverse Compton emission of\nan intergalactic population of relativistic electron/positron pairs generated\nby the annihilation of >100 GeV gamma rays on the extragalactic background\nlight. These are typically anisotropic due to the jetted structure from which\nthey originate or the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields. Here we\npropose a novel method for detecting these inverse-Compton gamma-ray halos\nbased upon this anisotropic structure. Specifically, we show that by stacking\nsuitably defined angular power spectra instead of images it is possible to\nrobustly detect gamma-ray halos with existing Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)\nobservations for a broad class of intergalactic magnetic fields. Importantly,\nthese are largely insensitive to systematic uncertainties within the LAT\ninstrumental response or associated with contaminating astronomical sources.\n", "  We explore the limitations and validity of semi-classically formulated spin\nequations of motion. Using a single-molecule magnet as a test model, we employ\nthree qualitatively different approximation schemes. From a microscopic model,\nwe derive a generalized spin equation of motion in which the parameters have a\nnon-local time-dependence. This dynamical equation is simplified to the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with i) time-dependent, and ii)\ntime-independent parameters. We show that transient dynamics is essentially\nnon-existing in the latter approximation, while the former breaks down in the\nregime of strong coupling between the spin and the itinerant electrons.\n", "  The free fermion nature of interacting spins in one dimensional (1D) spin\nchains still lacks a rigorous study. In this letter we show that the length-$1$\nspin strings significantly dominate critical properties of spinons, magnons and\nfree fermions in the 1D antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain. Using the Bethe\nansatz solution we analytically calculate exact scaling functions of thermal\nand magnetic properties of the model, providing a rigorous understanding of the\nquantum criticality of spinons. It turns out that the double peaks in specific\nheat elegantly mark two crossover temperatures fanning out from the critical\npoint, indicating three quantum phases: the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL),\nquantum critical and fully polarized ferromagnetic phases. For the TLL phase,\nthe Wilson ratio $R_W=4K_s$ remains almost temperature-independent, here $K_s$\nis the Luttinger parameter. Furthermore, applying our results we precisely\ndetermine the quantum scalings and critical exponents of all magnetic\nproperties in the ideal 1D spin-1/2 antiferromagnet\nCu(C${}_4$H${}_4$N${}_2$)(NO${}_3$)${}_2$ recently studied in Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 114}, 037202 (2015)]. We further find that the magnetization peak used in\nexperiments is not a good quantity to map out the finite temperature TLL phase\nboundary.\n", "  On February 17 2016, the IceCube real-time neutrino search identified, for\nthe first time, three muon neutrino candidates arriving within 100 s of one\nanother, consistent with coming from the same point in the sky. Such a triplet\nis expected once every 13.7 years as a random coincidence of background events.\nHowever, considering the lifetime of the follow-up program the probability of\ndetecting at least one triplet from atmospheric background is 32%. Follow-up\nobservatories were notified in order to search for an electromagnetic\ncounterpart. Observations were obtained by Swift's X-ray telescope, by ASAS-SN,\nLCO and MASTER at optical wavelengths, and by VERITAS in the very-high-energy\ngamma-ray regime. Moreover, the Swift BAT serendipitously observed the location\n100 s after the first neutrino was detected, and data from the Fermi LAT and\nHAWC observatory were analyzed. We present details of the neutrino triplet and\nthe follow-up observations. No likely electromagnetic counterpart was detected,\nand we discuss the implications of these constraints on candidate neutrino\nsources such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae and active galactic\nnucleus flares. This study illustrates the potential of and challenges for\nfuture follow-up campaigns.\n", "  For pure symmetric 3-qubit states there are only three algebraically\nindependent entanglement measures; one choice is the pairwise concurrence\n$\\mathcal C$, the 3-tangle $\\tau$, and the Kempe invariant $\\kappa$. Using a\ncanonical form for symmetric $N$-qubit states derived from their Majorana\nrepresentation, we derive the explicit achievable region of triples $(\\mathcal\nC,\\tau,\\kappa)$.\n", "  Homogeneous nucleation process of polyethylene (PE) is studied with full-atom\nmolecular dynamic simulation. To account the complex shape with low symmetry\nand the peculiar intra-chain conformational order of polymer, we introduce a\nshape descriptor OCB coupling conformational order and inter-chain rotational\nsymmetry, which is able to differentiate hexagonal and orthorhombic clusters\nfrom melt. With the shape descriptor OCB, we find that coupling between\nconformational and inter-chain rotational orderings results in the formation of\nhexagonal clusters first, which is dynamic in nature. Whilst nucleation of\northorhombic structure occurs inside of hexagonal clusters later, which\nproceeds via the coalescence of neighboring hexagonal clusters rather than\nstandard stepwise growth process. This demonstrates that nucleation of PE\ncrystal is a two-step process with the assistance of OCB order, which is\ndifferent from early models for polymer crystallization but similar with that\nproposed for spherical 'atoms' like colloid and metal.\n", "  We propose a method inspired from discrete light cone quantization (DLCQ) to\ndetermine the heat kernel for a Schr\\\"odinger field theory (Galilean boost\ninvariant with $z=2$ anisotropic scaling symmetry) living in $d+1$ dimensions,\ncoupled to a curved Newton-Cartan background starting from a heat kernel of a\nrelativistic conformal field theory ($z=1$) living in $d+2$ dimensions. We use\nthis method to show the Schr\\\"odinger field theory of a complex scalar field\ncannot have any Weyl anomalies. To be precise, we show that the Weyl anomaly\n$\\mathcal{A}^{G}_{d+1}$ for Schr\\\"odinger theory is related to the Weyl anomaly\nof a free relativistic scalar CFT $\\mathcal{A}^{R}_{d+2}$ via\n$\\mathcal{A}^{G}_{d+1}= 2\\pi \\delta (m) \\mathcal{A}^{R}_{d+2}$ where $m$ is the\ncharge of the scalar field under particle number symmetry. We provide further\nevidence of vanishing anomaly by evaluating Feynman diagrams in all orders of\nperturbation theory. We present an explicit calculation of the anomaly using a\nregulated Schr\\\"odinger operator, without using the null cone reduction\ntechnique. We generalise our method to show that a similar result holds for one\ntime derivative theories with even $z>2$.\n", "  Nonlinear systems, whose outputs are not directly proportional to their\ninputs, are well known to exhibit many interesting and important phenomena\nwhich have profoundly changed our technological landscape over the last 50\nyears. Recently the ability to engineer quantum metamaterials through\nhybridisation has allowed to explore these nonlinear effects in systems with no\nnatural analogue. Here we investigate amplitude bistability, which is one of\nthe most fundamental nonlinear phenomena, in a hybrid system composed of a\nsuperconducting resonator inductively coupled to an ensemble of\nnitrogen-vacancy centres. One of the exciting properties of this spin system is\nits extremely long spin life-time, more than ten orders of magnitude longer\nthan other relevant timescales of the hybrid system. This allows us to\ndynamically explore this nonlinear regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics\n(cQED) and demonstrate a critical slowing down of the cavity population on the\norder of several tens of thousands of seconds - a timescale much longer than\nobserved so far for this effect. Our results provide the foundation for future\nquantum technologies based on nonlinear phenomena.\n", "  We consider a closed region $R$ of 3d quantum space modeled by $SU(2)$\nspin-networks. Using the concentration of measure phenomenon we prove that,\nwhenever the ratio between the boundary $\\partial R$ and the bulk edges of the\ngraph overcomes a finite threshold, the state of the boundary is always\nthermal, with an entropy proportional to its area. The emergence of a thermal\nstate of the boundary can be traced back to a large amount of entanglement\nbetween boundary and bulk degrees of freedom. Using the dual geometric\ninterpretation provided by loop quantum gravity, we interprete such phenomenon\nas a pre-geometric analogue of Thorne's \"Hoop conjecture\", at the core of the\nformation of a horizon in General Relativity.\n", "  In string compactifications, frequently there appears the anomalous U(1)\ngauge symmetry which belonged to E8$\\times$E8 of the heterotic string. This\nanomalous U(1) gauge boson obtains mass at the compactification scale, just\nbelow $10^{18\\,}$GeV, by absorbing one pseudoscalar (corresponding to the\nmodel-independent axion) from the second rank anti-symmetric tensor field\n$B_{MN}$.\n  Below the compactification scale, there results a global symmetry U(1)$_{\\rm\nanom}$ whose charge $Q_{\\rm anom}$ is the original gauge U(1) charge. This is\nthe most natural global symmetry, realizing the \"invisible\" axion. This global\nsymmetry U(1)$_{\\rm anom}$ is suitable for a flavor symmetry. In the simplest\ncompactification model with the flipped SU(5) grand unification, we calculate\nall the low energy parameters in terms of the vacuum expectation values of the\nstandard model singlets.\n", "  Electron-electron (e-e) collisions can impact transport in a variety of\nsurprising and sometimes counterintuitive ways. Despite strong interest,\nexperiments on the subject proved challenging because of the simultaneous\npresence of different scattering mechanisms that suppress or obscure\nconsequences of e-e scattering. Only recently, sufficiently clean electron\nsystems with transport dominated by e-e collisions have become available,\nshowing behavior characteristic of highly viscous fluids. Here we study\nelectron transport through graphene constrictions and show that their\nconductance below 150 K increases with increasing temperature, in stark\ncontrast to the metallic character of doped graphene. Notably, the measured\nconductance exceeds the maximum conductance possible for free electrons. This\nanomalous behavior is attributed to collective movement of interacting\nelectrons, which 'shields' individual carriers from momentum loss at sample\nboundaries. The measurements allow us to identify the conductance contribution\narising due to electron viscosity and determine its temperature dependence.\nBesides fundamental interest, our work shows that viscous effects can\nfacilitate high-mobility transport at elevated temperatures, a potentially\nuseful behavior for designing graphene-based devices.\n", "  Recently, Chamseddine and Mukhanov introduced a higher-derivative\nscalar-tensor theory which leads to a modified Friedmann equation allowing for\nbouncing solutions. As we note in the present work, this Friedmann equation\nturns out to reproduce exactly the loop quantum cosmology effective dynamics\nfor a flat isotropic and homogeneous space-time. We generalize this result to\nobtain a class of scalar-tensor theories, belonging to the family of mimetic\ngravity, which all reproduce the loop quantum cosmology effective dynamics for\nflat, closed and open isotropic and homogeneous space-times.\n", "  Achieving high charge carrier mobility is the holy grail of organic\nelectronics. In this letter we report a record charge carrier mobility of 14.93\ncm$^2$ V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ through a coronene stack encapsulated in a single\nwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) by using a multiscale modeling technique which\ncombines MD simulations, first principle calculations and Kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations. For the CNT having a diameter of 1.56 nm we find a highly ordered\ndefect free organization of coronene molecules inside the CNT which is\nresponsible for the high charge carrier mobility. The encapsulated coronene\nmolecules are correlated with a large correlation length of $\\sim $18 {\\AA}\nwhich is independent of the length of the coronene column. Our simulation\nfurther suggests that coronene molecules can spontaneously enter the CNT,\nsuggesting that the encapsulation is experimentally realizable.\n", "  We argue that the preferred classical variables that emerge from a pure\nquantum state are determined by its entanglement structure in the form of\nredundant records: information shared between many subsystems. Focusing on the\nearly universe, we ask how classical metric perturbations emerge from vacuum\nfluctuations in an inflationary background. We show that the squeezing of the\nquantum state for super-horizon modes, along with minimal gravitational\ninteractions, leads to decoherence and to an exponential number of records of\nmetric fluctuations on very large scales, $\\lambda/\\lambda_{\\rm\nHubble}>\\Delta_\\zeta^{-2/3}$, where $\\Delta_\\zeta\\lesssim 10^{-5}$ is the\namplitude of scalar metric fluctuations. This determines a preferred\ndecomposition of the inflationary wavefunction into orthogonal \"branches\"\ncorresponding to classical metric perturbations, which defines an inflationary\nentropy production rate and accounts for the emergence of stochastic,\ninhomogeneous spacetime geometry.\n", "  This paper considers the non-Hermitian Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) scattering\nproblem which forms the basis for defining the SU$(2)$-nonlinear Fourier\ntransformation (NFT). The theoretical underpinnings of this generalization of\nthe conventional Fourier transformation is quite well established in the\nAblowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) formalism; however, efficient numerical\nalgorithms that could be employed in practical applications are still\nunavailable.\n  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the forward and inverse NFT\nusing exponential one-step methods which are amenable to FFT-based fast\npolynomial arithmetic. Within this discrete framework, we propose a fast\nDarboux transformation (FDT) algorithm having an operational complexity of\n$\\mathscr{O}\\left(KN+N\\log^2N\\right)$ such that the error in the computed\n$N$-samples of the $K$-soliton vanishes as $\\mathscr{O}\\left(N^{-p}\\right)$\nwhere $p$ is the order of convergence of the underlying one-step method. For\nfixed $N$, this algorithm outperforms the the classical DT (CDT) algorithm\nwhich has a complexity of $\\mathscr{O}\\left(K^2N\\right)$. We further present\nextension of these algorithms to the general version of DT which allows one to\nadd solitons to arbitrary profiles that are admissible as scattering potentials\nin the ZS-problem. The general CDT/FDT algorithms have the same operational\ncomplexity as that of the $K$-soliton case and the order of convergence matches\nthat of the underlying one-step method. A comparative study of these algorithms\nis presented through exhaustive numerical tests.\n", "  What are the conditions on a field theoretic model leading to a finite\nentanglement entropy density? We prove two very general results: 1) Ultraviolet\nfiniteness of a theory does not guarantee finiteness of the entropy density; 2)\nIf the spectral dimension of the spatial boundary across which the entropy is\ncalculated is non-negative at all scales, then the entanglement entropy cannot\nbe finite. These conclusions, which we verify in several examples, negatively\naffect all quantum-gravity models, since their spectral dimension is always\npositive. Possible ways out are considered, including abandoning the definition\nof the entanglement entropy in terms of the boundary return probability or\nadmitting an analytic continuation (not a regularization) of the usual\ndefinition. In the second case, one can get a finite entanglement entropy\ndensity in multi-fractional theories and causal dynamical triangulations.\n", "  We revisit the subtelties of computing the high temperature spin stiffness\n$D$ of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain using exact diagonalization to analyze its\ndependence on system symmetries and ensemble. Within the canonical ensemble and\nfor states with zero magnetization, we find $D$ vanishes exactly due to\nspin-inversion symmetry for all but the anisotropies $\\tilde \\Delta_{MN} =\n\\cos(\\pi M /N)$ with $N > M$ and coprime, provided system sizes $L \\ge 2N$, for\nwhich states with different spin-inversion signature become degenerate due to\nthe underlying $sl_2$ loop algebra symmetry. All these loop-algebra degenerate\nstates carry finite currents which we conjecture [based on $L$ and anisotropies\n$\\tilde \\Delta_{MN}$ (with $N<L/2$) available to us] to dominate the\ngrand-canonical ensemble evaluation of $D$ in the thermodynamic limit.\nIncluding a magnetic flux not only breaks spin-inversion in the zero\nmagnetization sector but also lifts the loop-algebra degeneracies in all\nsymmetry sectors --- this effect is more pertinent at smaller $\\Delta$ due to\nthe larger contributions to $D$ coming from the low-magnetization sectors which\nare more sensitive to the system's symmetries. Thus we generically find a\nfinite $D$ for fluxed rings and arbitrary $0<\\Delta<1$ in both ensembles. In\ncontrast, at the isotropic point and in the gapped phase ($\\Delta \\ge 1$) $D$\nis found to vanish in the thermodynamic limit, independent of symmetry or\nensemble. Our analysis demonstrates how convergence to the thermodynamic limit\nwithin the gapless phase ($\\Delta < 1$) may be accelerated and the finite-size\nanomalies overcome: $D$ extrapolates nicely in the thermodynamic limit to\neither the recently computed lower-bound or the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz\nresult provided both spin-inversion is broken and the additional degeneracies\nat the $\\tilde \\Delta_{MN}$ anisotropies are lifted.\n", "  We study the heating mechanisms and Ly{\\alpha} escape fractions of 35\nLy{\\alpha} blobs (LABs) at z = 3.1 in the SSA22 field. Dust continuum sources\nhave been identified in 11 of the 35 LABs, all with star formation rates (SFRs)\nabove 100 Msun/yr. Likely radio counterparts are detected in 9 out of 29\ninvestigated LABs. The detection of submm dust emission is more linked to the\nphysical size of the Ly{\\alpha} emission than to the Ly{\\alpha} luminosities of\nthe LABs. A radio excess in the submm/radio detected LABs is common, hinting at\nthe presence of active galactic nuclei. Most radio sources without X-ray\ncounterparts are located at the centers of the LABs. However, all X-ray\ncounterparts avoid the central regions. This may be explained by absorption due\nto exceptionally large column densities along the line-of-sight or by LAB\nmorphologies, which are highly orientation dependent. The median Ly{\\alpha}\nescape fraction is about 3\\% among the submm-detected LABs, which is lower than\na lower limit of 11\\% for the submm-undetected LABs. We suspect that the large\ndifference is due to the high dust attenuation supported by the large SFRs, the\ndense large-scale environment as well as large uncertainties in the extinction\ncorrections required to apply when interpreting optical data.\n", "  (abbreviated) We aim to constrain the dust formation histories in the winds\nof oxygen-rich AGB stars. We have obtained ALMA observations with a spatial\nresolution of 120x150 mas tracing the dust formation region of a low mass-loss\nrate and a high mass-loss rate AGB star, R Dor and IK Tau. Emission line\nprofiles of AlO, AlOH and AlCl are detected and are used to derive a lower\nlimit of atomic aluminium incorporated in molecules. We show that the gas-phase\naluminium chemistry is completely different in both stars, with a remarkable\ndifference in the AlO and AlOH abundance stratification. The amount of\naluminium locked up in these 3 molecules is small, <=1.1e-7, for both stars,\ni.e. only <=2% of the total aluminium budget. This leaves ample of room for\naluminium to be incorporated in grains. A fundamental result is that AlO and\nAlOH, being the direct precursors of alumina grains, are detected well beyond\nthe onset of the dust condensation proving that the aluminium oxide\ncondensation cycle is not fully efficient. The ALMA observations allow us to\nquantitatively assess the current generation of theoretical dynamical-chemical\nmodels for AGB winds. We discuss how the current proposed scenario of aluminium\ndust condensation for low mass-loss rate AGB stars at a distance of ~1.5 Rstar,\nin particular for the stars R Dor and W Hya, poses a challenge if one wishes to\nexplain both the dust spectral features in the spectral energy distribution\n(SED), in interferometric data, and in polarized light signal. In particular,\nthe estimated grain temperature of Al2O3 is too high for the grains to retain\ntheir amorphous structure. We propose that large gas-phase (Al2O3)n-clusters\n(n>34) can be the potential agents of the broad 11 micron feature in the SED\nand in the interferometric data and we explain how these large clusters can be\nformed.\n", "  Connectivity - or the lack thereof - is crucial for the function of many\nman-made systems, from financial and economic networks over epidemic spreading\nin social networks to technical infrastructure. Often, connections are\ndeliberately established or removed to induce, maintain, or destroy global\nconnectivity. Thus, there has been a great interest in understanding how to\ncontrol percolation, the transition to large-scale connectivity. Previous work,\nhowever, studied control strategies assuming unlimited resources. Here, we\ndepart from this unrealistic assumption and consider the effect of limited\nresources on the effectiveness of control. We show that, even for scarce\nresources, percolation can be controlled with an efficient intervention\nstrategy. We derive this strategy and study its implications, revealing a\ndiscontinuous transition as an unintended side-effect of optimal control.\n", "  The direct observation of gravitational waves with Advanced LIGO and Advanced\nVirgo offers novel opportunities to test general relativity in strong-field,\nhighly dynamical regimes. One such opportunity is the measurement of\ngravitational-wave polarizations. While general relativity predicts only two\ntensor gravitational-wave polarizations, general metric theories of gravity\nallow for up to four additional vector and scalar modes. The detection of these\nalternative polarizations would represent a clear violation of general\nrelativity. The LIGO-Virgo detection of the binary black hole merger GW170814\nhas recently offered the first direct constraints on the polarization of\ngravitational waves. The current generation of ground-based detectors, however,\nis limited in its ability to sensitively determine the polarization content of\ntransient gravitational-wave signals. Observation of the stochastic\ngravitational-wave background, in contrast, offers a means of directly\nmeasuring generic gravitational-wave polarizations. The stochastic background,\narising from the superposition of many individually unresolvable\ngravitational-wave signals, may be detectable by Advanced LIGO at\ndesign-sensitivity. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method with which to\ndetect and characterize the polarization of the stochastic background. We\nexplore prospects for estimating parameters of the background, and quantify the\nlimits that Advanced LIGO can place on vector and scalar polarizations in the\nabsence of a detection. Finally, we investigate how the introduction of new\nterrestrial detectors like Advanced Virgo aid in our ability to detect or\nconstrain alternative polarizations in the stochastic background. We find that,\nalthough the addition of Advanced Virgo does not notably improve detection\nprospects, it may dramatically improve our ability to estimate the parameters\nof backgrounds of mixed polarization.\n", "  The technical details of a balloon stratospheric mission that is aimed at\nmeasuring the Schumann resonances are described. The gondola is designed\nspecifically for the measuring of faint effects of ELF (Extremely Low Frequency\nelectromagnetic waves) phenomena. The prototype met the design requirements.\nThe ELF measuring system worked properly for entire mission; however, the level\nof signal amplification that was chosen taking into account ground-level\nmeasurements was too high. Movement of the gondola in the Earth magnetic field\ninduced the signal in the antenna that saturated the measuring system. This\neffect will be taken into account in the planning of future missions. A large\ntelemetry dataset was gathered during the experiment and is currently under\nprocessing. The payload consists also of biological material as well as\nelectronic equipment that was tested under extreme conditions.\n", "  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are versatile candidates for many\nquantum information processing tasks, ranging from quantum imaging and sensing\nthrough to quantum communication and fault-tolerant quantum computers. Critical\nto almost every potential application is an efficient mechanism for the high\nfidelity readout of the state of the electronic and nuclear spins. Typically\nsuch readout has been achieved through an optically resonant fluorescence\nmeasurement, but the presence of decay through a meta-stable state will limit\nits efficiency to the order of 99%. While this is good enough for many\napplications, it is insufficient for large scale quantum networks and\nfault-tolerant computational tasks. Here we explore an alternative approach\nbased on dipole induced transparency (state-dependent reflection) in an NV\ncenter cavity QED system, using the most recent knowledge of the NV center's\nparameters to determine its feasibility, including the decay channels through\nthe meta-stable subspace and photon ionization. We find that single-shot\nmeasurements above fault-tolerant thresholds should be available in the strong\ncoupling regime for a wide range of cavity-center cooperativities, using a\nmajority voting approach utilizing single photon detection. Furthermore,\nextremely high fidelity measurements are possible using weak optical pulses.\n", "  The magnetism of ordered and disordered La$_2$NiMnO$_6$ is explained using a\nmodel involving double exchange and superexchange. The concept of majority spin\nhybridization in the large coupling limit is used to explain the ferromagnetism\nof La$_2$NiMnO$_6$ as compared to the ferrimagnetism of Sr$_{2}$FeMoO$_{6}$.\nThe ferromagnetic insulating ground state in the ordered phase is explained.\nThe essential role played by the Ni-Mn superexchange between the Ni $e_{g}$\nelectron spins and the Mn $t_{2g}$ core electron spins in realizing this ground\nstate, is outlined. In presence of antisite disorder, the model system is found\nto exhibit a tendency of becoming a spin-glass at low temperatures, while it\ncontinues to retain a ferromagnetic transition at higher temperatures, similar\nto recent experimental observations [D. Choudhury .et.al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n108, 127201 (2012)]. This reentrant spin-glass or reentrant ferromagnetic\nbehaviour is explained in terms of the competition of the ferromagnetic double\nexchange between the Ni $e_{g}$ and the Mn $e_{g}$ electrons, and the\nferromagnetic Ni-Mn superexchange, with the antiferromagnetic antisite Mn-Mn\nsuperexchange.\n", "  We present a calculation of the matter power spectrum covariance matrix ${\\rm\nCov}(\\bf{k}_1,\\bf{k}_2)$ that uses power spectrum responses to accurately\ndescribe the coupling between large- and small-scale modes beyond the\nperturbative regime. These response functions can be measured with\n(small-volume) N-body simulations, which is why the response contributions to\nthe covariance remain valid and predictive at all orders in perturbation\ntheory. A novel and key step presented here is the use of responses to compute\nloop contributions with soft loop momenta, which extends the application of the\nresponse approach beyond that of previously considered squeezed $n$-point\nfunctions. The calculation presented here does not involve any fitting\nparameters. When including response-type terms up to 1-loop order in\nperturbation theory, we find that our calculation captures the bulk of the\ntotal covariance as estimated from simulations up to values of $k_1, k_2 \\sim\n1\\ h/{\\rm Mpc}$. Moreover, the prediction is guaranteed to be accurate whenever\nthe softer mode is sufficiently linear, ${\\rm min}\\{k_1,k_2\\} \\lesssim 0.08\\\nh/{\\rm Mpc}$. We identify and discuss straightforward improvements in the\ncontext of the response approach, which are expected to further increase the\naccuracy of the calculation presented here.\n", "  We derive the extended renormalized entanglement entropy (EREE) and the\nFisher information metric in the case of closed bosonic strings in homogeneous\nplane wave background. Our investigations are conducted within the framework of\nThermo Field Dynamics (TFD). The formalism is also illustrated on the example\nof some particular models in condensed matter physics and the non-equilibrium\ncase for system with dissipations.\n", "  The production of a $Z$ boson and a photon in association with a high-mass\ndijet system is studied using 20.2fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at\na centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector\nin 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider. Final states with a photon and a Z boson\ndecaying into a pair of either electrons, muons, or neutrinos are analysed.\nElectroweak and total $pp \\to Z\\gamma j j$ cross-sections are extracted in two\nfiducial regions with different sensitivities to electroweak production\nprocesses. Quartic couplings of vector bosons are studied in regions of phase\nspace with an enhanced contribution from pure electroweak production, sensitive\nto vector-boson scattering processes $VV \\to Z\\gamma$. No deviations from\nStandard Model predictions are observed and constraints are placed on anomalous\ncouplings parameterized by higher-dimensional operators using effective field\ntheory.\n", "  We employ a tight-binding parametrization based on the Slater Koster model in\norder to fit the band structures of single-layer, bilayer and bulk black\nphosphorus obtained from first-principles calculations. We find that our model,\nwhich includes 9 or 17 parameters depending on whether overlap is included or\nnot, reproduces quite well the ab-initio band structures over a wide energy\nrange, especially the occupied bands. We also find that the inclusion of\noverlap parameters improves the quality of the fit for the conduction bands. On\nthe other hand, hopping and on-site energies are consistent throughout the\ndifferent systems, which is an indication that our model is suitable for\ncalculations on multilayer black phosphorus and more complex situations in\nwhich first-principles calculations become prohibitive, such as disordered\nsystems and heterostructures with a large lattice mismatch. We also discuss the\nlimitations of the model and how the fit procedure can be improved for a more\naccurate description of bands in the vicinity of the Fermi energy.\n", "  We measure the branching fraction and $CP$ violation asymmetry in the decay\n$B^{0}\\to \\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}$, using a data sample of $752\\times 10^{6}$ $B\\bar{B}$\npairs collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the\nKEKB $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. The obtained branching fraction and direct $CP$\nasymmetry are $ \\mathcal{B}(B\\to \\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}) = [1.31 \\pm 0.19~\n\\text{(stat.)} \\pm 0.19~ \\text{(syst.)}] \\times 10^{-6}$ and $\n  A_{CP} = +0.14 \\pm 0.36~ \\text{(stat.)} \\pm 0.10~ \\text{(syst.)}, $\nrespectively. The signal significance, including the systematic uncertainty, is\n6.4 standard deviations. We combine these results with Belle's earlier\nmeasurements of $B^{0}\\to \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ and $B^{\\pm} \\to \\pi^{\\pm} \\pi^{0}$\nto exclude the $CP$-violating parameter $\\phi_{2}$ from the range $15.5^{\\circ}\n< \\phi_{2} < 75.0^{\\circ}$ at 95\\% confidence level.\n", "  Ultra long linear carbon chains of more than 6000 carbon atoms have recently\nbeen synthesized within double-walled carbon nanotubes, and they show a\npromising new route to one--atom--wide semiconductors with a direct band gap.\nTheoretical studies predicted that this band gap can be tuned by the length of\nthe chains, the end groups, and their interactions with the environment.\nHowever, different density functionals lead to very different values of the\nband gap of infinitely long carbyne. In this work, we applied resonant Raman\nexcitation spectroscopy with more than 50 laser wavelengths to determine for\nthe first time the band gap of long carbon chains encapsulated inside DWCNTs.\nThe experimentally determined band gaps ranging from 2.253 to 1.848 eV follow a\nlinear relation with Raman frequency. This lower bound is the smallest band gap\nof linear carbon chains observed so far. The comparison with experimental data\nobtained for short chains in gas phase or in solution demonstrates the effect\nof the DWCNT encapsulation, leading to an essential downshift of the band gap.\nThis is explained by the interaction between the carbon chain and the host\ntube, which greatly modifies the chain's bond length alternation.\n", "  We experimentally study magnetic resonances in the helical and conical\nmagnetic phases of the chiral magnetic insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at the\ntemperature $T$=5 K. Using a broadband microwave spectroscopy technique based\non vector network analysis, we identify three distinct sets of helimagnon\nresonances in the frequency range 2 GHz $\\leq f \\leq$ 20 GHz. The extracted\nresonance frequencies are in accordance with calculations of the helimagnon\nbandstructure found in an intrinsic chiral magnonic crystal. The periodic\nmodulation of the equilibrium spin direction that leads to the formation of the\nmagnonic crystal is a direct consequence of the chiral magnetic ordering caused\nby the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The opening of magnon band-gaps\nallows for excitation of helimagnons with wave vectors that are multiples of\nthe spiral wave vector.\n", "  We present AMICO (Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects), a new\nalgorithm for the detection of galaxy clusters in photometric surveys. AMICO is\nbased on the Optimal Filtering technique, which allows to maximise the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the clusters. In this work we focus on the new\niterative approach to the extraction of cluster candidates from the map\nproduced by the filter. In particular, we provide a definition of membership\nprobability for the galaxies close to any cluster candidate, which allows us to\nremove its imprint from the map, allowing the detection of smaller structures.\nAs demonstrated in our tests, this method allows the deblending of close-by and\naligned structures in more than $50\\%$ of the cases for objects at radial\ndistance equal to $0.5 \\times R_{200}$ or redshift distance equal to $2 \\times\n\\sigma_z$, being $\\sigma_z$ the typical uncertainty of photometric redshifts.\nRunning AMICO on mocks derived from N-body simulations and semi-analytical\nmodelling of the galaxy evolution, we obtain a consistent mass-amplitude\nrelation through the redshift range $0.3 < z < 1$, with a logarithmic slope\n$\\sim 0.55$ and a logarithmic scatter $\\sim 0.14$. The fraction of false\ndetections is steeply decreasing with S/N, and negligible at S/N > 5.\n", "  Even after elaborate investigations for 30 years, we still do not know well\nhow the progenitor of SN 1987A has evolved. To explain unusual red-to-blue\nevolution, previous studies suggest that in a red giant stage either the\nincrease of surface He abundance or the envelope mass was necessary. It is\nusually supposed that the He enhancement is caused by the rotational mixing,\nand the mass increase is by a binary merger. Thus, we have investigated these\nscenarios thoroughly. The obtained findings are that rotating single star\nmodels do not satisfy all the observational constraints and that the\nenhancement of envelope mass alone does not explain observations. Here, we\nconsider a slow merger scenario in which both the He abundance and the envelope\nmass enhancements are expected to occur. We indeed show that most observational\nconstraints such as the red-to-blue evolution, lifetime, total mass, position\nin the HR diagram at collapse, and the chemical anomalies are well reproduced\nby the merger model of 14 and 9 M$_{\\odot}$ stars. We also discuss the effects\nof the added envelope spin in the merger scenarios.\n", "  Planets in the mass range from 2 to 15 MEarth are very diverse. Some of them\nhave low densities, while others are very dense. By measuring the masses and\nradii, the mean densities, structure, and composition of the planets are\nconstrained. These parameters also give us important information about their\nformation and evolution, and about possible processes for atmospheric loss.We\ndetermined the masses, radii, and mean densities for the two transiting planets\norbiting K2-106. The inner planet has an ultra-short period of 0.57 days. The\nperiod of the outer planet is 13.3 days.Although the two planets have similar\nmasses, their densities are very different. For K2-106b we derive\nMb=8.36-0.94+0.96 MEarh, Rb=1.52+/-0.16 REarth, and a high density of\n13.1-3.6+5.4 gcm-3. For K2-106c, we find Mc=5.8-3.0+3.3 MEarth,\nRc=2.50-0.26+0.27 REarth and a relatively low density of 2.0-1.1+1.6\ngcm-3.Since the system contains two planets of almost the same mass, but\ndifferent distances from the host star, it is an excellent laboratory to study\natmospheric escape. In agreement with the theory of atmospheric-loss processes,\nit is likely that the outer planet has a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. The\nmass and radius of the inner planet is in agreement with theoretical models\npredicting an iron core containing 80+20-30% of its mass. Such a high metal\ncontent is surprising, particularly given that the star has an ordinary (solar)\nmetal abundance. We discuss various possible formation scenarios for this\nunusual planet.\n", "  Phase recovery from intensity-only measurements forms the heart of coherent\nimaging techniques and holography. Here we demonstrate that a neural network\ncan learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after\nappropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely\nnew framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image\nand self-interference related spatial artifacts. Compared to existing\napproaches, this neural network based method is significantly faster to\ncompute, and reconstructs improved phase and amplitude images of the objects\nusing only one hologram, i.e., requires less number of measurements in addition\nto being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing\nphase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears,\nand tissue sections. These results are broadly applicable to any phase recovery\nproblem, and highlight that through machine learning challenging problems in\nimaging science can be overcome, providing new avenues to design powerful\ncomputational imaging systems.\n", "  The observation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in optical\nmicroresonators provides, on the applied side, compact sources of coherent\noptical frequency combs that have already been applied in coherent\ncommunications, dual comb spectroscopy and metrology. On a fundamental level,\nit enables the study of soliton physics in driven nonlinear cavities.\nMicroresonators are commonly multimode and, as a result, inter-mode\ninteractions inherently occur among mode families - a condition referred to as\n\"avoided mode crossings\". Avoided mode crossings can cause soliton decay, but\ncan also modify the soliton spectrum, leading to e.g. the formation of\ndispersive wave and inducing a spectral recoil. Yet, to date, the entailing\ntemporal soliton dynamics from inter-mode interactions has rarely been studied,\nbut is critical to understand regimes of soliton-stability. Here we report the\ndiscovery of an inter-mode breather soliton. Such breathing dynamics occurs\nwithin a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary dissipative\nsolitons are expected. We demonstrate experimentally the phenomenon in two\nmicroresonator platforms (crystalline magnesium fluoride and photonic\nchip-based silicon nitride microresonators), and theoretically describe the\ndynamics based on a pair of coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations. We demonstrate\nexperimentally that the breathing is associated with a periodic energy exchange\nbetween the soliton and another optical mode family. We further show that\ninter-mode interactions can be modeled by a response function acting on\ndissipative solitons. The observation of breathing dynamics in the\nconventionally stable soliton regime is critical to applications, ranging from\nlow-noise microwave generation, frequency synthesis to spectroscopy. On a\nfundamental level, our results provide new understandings of the rich\ndissipative soliton dynamics in multimode nonlinear cavities.\n", "  The quantum limit can be easily reached in the Dirac semimetals under the\nmagnetic field, which will lead to some exotic many-body physics due to the\nhigh degeneracy of the topological zeroth Landau bands (LBs). By solving the\neffective Hamiltonian, which is derived by tracing out the high energy degrees\nof freedom, at the self-consistent mean field level, we have systematically\nstudied the instability of Dirac semimetal under a strong magnetic field. A\ncharge density wave (CDW) phase and a polarized nematic phase formed by\n\"exciton condensation\" are predicted as the ground state for the tilted and\nuntilted bands, respectively. Furthermore, we propose that, distinguished from\nthe CDW phase, the polarized nematic phase can be identified in experiments by\nanisotropic transport and Raman scattering.\n", "  Recently it was shown that molecules rotating in superfluid helium can be\ndescribed in terms of the angulon quasiparticles (Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 095301\n(2017)). Here we demonstrate that in the experimentally realized regime the\nangulon can be seen as a point charge on a 2-sphere interacting with a gauge\nfield of a non-abelian magnetic monopole. Unlike in several other settings, the\ngauge fields of the angulon problem emerge in the real coordinate space, as\nopposed to the momentum space or some effective parameter space. Furthermore,\nwe find a topological transition associated with making the monopole abelian,\nwhich takes place in the vicinity of the previously reported angulon\ninstabilities. These results pave the way for studying topological phenomena in\nexperiments on molecules trapped in superfluid helium nanodroplets, as well as\non other realizations of orbital impurity problems.\n", "  The merger of binary neutron stars, or of a neutron star and a stellar-mass\nblack hole, can result in the formation of a massive rotating torus around a\nspinning black hole. In addition to providing collimating media for gamma-ray\nburst jets, unbound outflows from these disks are an important source of mass\nejection and rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We present the\nfirst three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)\nsimulations of neutrino-cooled accretion disks in neutron star mergers,\nincluding a realistic equation of state valid at low densities and\ntemperatures, self-consistent evolution of the electron fraction, and neutrino\ncooling through an approximate leakage scheme. After initial magnetic field\namplification by magnetic winding, we witness the vigorous onset of turbulence\ndriven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). The disk quickly reaches a\nbalance between heating from MRI-driven turbulence and neutrino cooling, which\nregulates the midplane electron fraction to a low equilibrium value $Y_\\text{e}\n\\approx 0.1$. Over the 380 ms duration of the simulation, we find that a\nfraction $\\approx 20\\%$ of the initial torus mass is unbound in powerful\noutflows with velocities $v \\approx 0.03-0.1\\,c$ and electron fractions\n$Y_\\text{e} \\approx 0.1-0.25$. Post-processing the outflows through a nuclear\nreaction network shows the production of a robust second and third peak\nr-process. Though broadly consistent with the results of previous axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations, extrapolation of our results to late times suggests\nthat the total ejecta mass from GRMHD disks is significantly higher. Our\nresults provide strong evidence that post-merger disk outflows are an important\nsite for the r-process.\n", "  We propose a new approach to circumvent the sign problem in which the\nintegration path is optimized to control the sign problem. We give a trial\nfunction specifying the integration path in the complex plane and tune it to\noptimize the cost function which represents the seriousness of the sign\nproblem. We call it the path optimization method. In this method, we do not\nneed to solve the gradient flow required in the Lefschetz-thimble method and\nthen the construction of the integration-path contour arrives at the\noptimization problem where several efficient methods can be applied. In a\nsimple model with a serious sign problem, the path optimization method is\ndemonstrated to work well; the residual sign problem is resolved and precise\nresults can be obtained even in the region where the global sign problem is\nserious.\n", "  This paper is devoted to investigate the recently introduced\n$f(\\mathcal{G},\\textit{T})$ theory of gravity, where $\\mathcal{G}$ is the\nGauss-Bonnet term, and ${\\textit{T}}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum\ntensor. For this purpose, anisotropic background is chosen and a power law\n$f(\\mathcal{G},\\textit{T})$ gravity model is used to find the exact solutions\nof field equations. In particular, a general solution is obtained which is\nfurther used to reconstruct some important solutions in cosmological contexts.\nThe physical quantities like energy density, pressure, and equation of state\nparameter are calculated. A Starobinsky Like $f_2(\\textit{T})$ model is\nproposed which is used to analyze the behavior of universe for different values\nof equation of state parameter. It is concluded that presence of term\n$\\textit{T}$ in the bivariate function $f(\\mathcal{G},\\textit{T})$ may give\nmany cosmologically important solutions of the field equations.\n", "  We characterize the stellar and gas volume density, potential, and\ngravitational field profiles in the central $\\sim$ 0.5 pc of the Orion Nebula\nCluster (ONC), the nearest embedded star cluster (or rather, proto-cluster)\nhosting massive star formation available for detailed observational scrutiny.\nWe find that the stellar volume density is well characterized by a Plummer\nprofile $\\rho_{stars}(r) = 5755\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm\npc}^{-3}\\,(1+(r/a)^2)^{-5/2}$, where $a = 0.36$ pc. The gas density follows a\ncylindrical power law $\\rho_{gas}(R) = 25.9\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm\npc}^{-3}\\,(R/{\\rm pc})^{-1.775}$. The stellar density profile dominates over\nthe gas density profile inside $r\\,\\sim\\,1$ pc. The gravitational field is\ngas-dominated at all radii, but the contribution to the total field by the\nstars is nearly equal to that of the gas at $r\\,\\sim\\,a$. This fact alone\ndemonstrates that the proto-cluster cannot be considered a gas-free system or a\nvirialized system dominated by its own gravity. The stellar proto-cluster core\nis dynamically young, with an age of $\\sim$ 2-3 Myr, a 1D velocity dispersion\nof $\\sigma_{\\rm obs} = 2.6$ km s$^{-1}$, and a crossing time of $\\sim$ 0.55\nMyr. This timescale is almost identical to the gas filament oscillation\ntimescale estimated recently by Stutz & Gould (2016). This provides strong\nevidence that the proto-cluster structure is regulated by the gas filament. The\nproto-cluster structure may be set by tidal forces due to the oscillating\nfilamentary gas potential. Such forces could naturally suppress low density\nstellar structures on scales $\\gtrsim\\,a$. The analysis presented here leads to\na new suggestion that clusters form by an analog of the \"slingshot mechanism\"\npreviously proposed for stars.\n", "  The improving sensitivity of measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(SZ) effect opens a new window into the thermodynamic properties of the baryons\nin halos. We propose a methodology to constrain these thermodynamic properties\nby combining the kinetic SZ, which is an unbiased probe of the free electron\ndensity, and the thermal SZ, which probes their thermal pressure. We forecast\nthat our method constrains the average thermodynamic processes that govern the\nenergetics of galaxy evolution like energetic feedback across all redshift\nranges where viable halos sample are available. Current Stage-3 cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) experiments like AdvACT and SPT-3G can measure the\nkSZ and tSZ to greater than 100$\\sigma$ if combined with a DESI-like\nspectroscopic survey. Such measurements translate into percent-level\nconstraints on the baryonic density and pressure profiles and on the feedback\nand non-thermal pressure support parameters for a given ICM model. This in turn\nwill provide critical thermodynamic tests for sub-grid models of feedback in\ncosmological simulations of galaxy formation. The high fidelity measurements\npromised by the next generation CMB experiment, CMB-S4, allow one to further\nsub-divide these constraints beyond redshift into other classifications, like\nstellar mass or galaxy type.\n", "  Robustness of helical edge states in 2D topological insulators (TI) against\nstrong interactions remains an intriguing issue. Here, by performing the first\nsign-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba\nmodel which describes an interacting 2D TI with two-particle backscattering on\nedges, we verify that the gapless helical edge states are robust against a\nfinite range of two-particle backscattering when the Coulomb repulsion is not\nstrong. However, when the Coulomb repulsion is strong enough, the helical edge\nstates can be gapped by infinitesimal two-particle backscattering, resulting in\nedge magnetic order. We further reveal universal properties of the magnetic\nedge quantum critical point (EQCP). At magnetic domain walls on edges, we find\nthat a fractionalized charge of e/2 emerges. Implications of our results to\nrecent transport experiments in the InAs/GaSb quantum well, which is a 2D TI\nwith strong interactions, will also be discussed.\n", "  We present results for the form factors of the isovector axial vector current\nin the nucleon state using large scale simulations of lattice QCD. The\ncalculations were done using eight ensembles of gauge configurations generated\nby the MILC collaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors.\nThese ensembles span three lattice spacings $a \\approx 0.06, 0.09$ and $0.12$\nfm and light-quark masses corresponding to the pion masses $M_\\pi \\approx 135,\n225$ and $310$ MeV. High-statistics estimates allow us to quantify systematic\nuncertainties in the extraction of $G_A(Q^2)$ and the induced pseudoscalar form\nfactor $\\tilde{G}_P(Q^2)$. We perform a simultaneous extrapolation in the\nlattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses of the axial charge\nradius $r_A$ data to obtain physical estimates. Using the dipole ansatz to fit\nthe $Q^2$ behavior we obtain $r_A|_{\\rm dipole} = 0.49(3)$ fm, which\ncorresponds to ${\\cal M}_A = 1.39(9)$ GeV, and is consistent with ${\\cal M}_A =\n1.35(17)$ GeV obtained by the miniBooNE collaboration. The estimate obtained\nusing the $z$-expansion is $r_A|_{z-{\\rm expansion}} = 0.46(6)$ fm, and the\ncombined result is $r_A|_{\\rm combined} = 0.48(4)$ fm. Analysis of the induced\npseudoscalar form factor $\\tilde{G}_P(Q^2)$ yields low estimates for $g_P^\\ast$\nand $g_{\\pi {\\rm NN}}$ compared to their phenomenological values. To understand\nthese, we analyze the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation by also\ncalculating the pseudoscalar form factor. We find that these low values are due\nto large deviations in the PCAC relation between the three form factors and\nfrom the pion-pole dominance hypothesis.\n", "  Experiments with ultracold atoms provide a highly controllable laboratory\nsetting with many unique opportunities for precision exploration of quantum\nmany-body phenomena. The nature of such systems, with strong interaction and\nquantum entanglement, makes reliable theoretical calculations challenging.\nEspecially difficult are excitation and dynamical properties, which are often\nthe most directly relevant to experiment. We carry out exact numerical\ncalculations, by Monte Carlo sampling of imaginary-time propagation of Slater\ndeterminants, to compute the pairing gap in the two-dimensional Fermi gas from\nfirst principles. Applying state-of-art analytic continuation techniques, we\nobtain the spectral function, and the density and spin structure factors\nproviding unique tools to visualize the BEC-BCS crossover. These quantities\nwill allow for a direct comparison with experiments.\n", "  Localized-surface plasmon resonance is of importance in both fundamental and\napplied physics for the subwavelength confinement of optical field, but\nrealization of quantum coherent processes is confronted with challenges due to\nstrong dissipation. Here we propose to engineer the electromagnetic environment\nof metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) using optical microcavities. An analytical\nquantum model is built to describe the MNP-microcavity interaction, revealing\nthe significantly enhanced dipolar radiation and consequentially reduced Ohmic\ndissipation of the plasmonic modes. As a result, when interacting with a\nquantum emitter, the microcavity-engineered MNP enhances the quantum yield over\n40 folds and the radiative power over one order of magnitude. Moreover, the\nsystem can enter the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics,\nproviding a promising platform for the study of plasmonic quantum\nelectrodynamics, quantum information processing, precise sensing and\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We have investigated the electronic structure of Na$_x$Ca$_{1-x}$Cr$_2$O$_4$\nusing x-ray absorption spectroscopy together with Anderson impurity model\ncalculations with full multiplets. We show Na$_x$Ca$_{1-x}$Cr$_2$O$_4$ taking a\nnovel mixed-valence electronic state in which the positive charge-transfer (CT)\nand the negative self-doped states coexist. While CaCr$_2$O$_4$ (one end\nmember) exhibits a typical CT nature with strong covalent character, Na\nsubstitution causes a self-doped state with an oxygen hole. In NaCr$_2$O$_4$\n(the other end member), positive CT and negative self-doped states coexist with\nequal weight. This unusual electronic state is in sharp contrast to the\nconventional mixed-valence description, in which the ground state can be\ndescribed by the mixture of Cr$^{3+}$ ($3d^3$) and Cr$^{4+}$ ($3d^2$).\n", "  Starting from a very accurate model for density-in-cells statistics of dark\nmatter based on large deviation theory, a bias model for the tracer density in\nspheres is formulated. It adopts a mean bias relation based on a quadratic bias\nmodel to relate the log-densities of dark matter to those of mass-weighted dark\nhaloes in real and redshift space. The validity of the parametrised bias model\nis established using a parametrisation-independent extraction of the bias\nfunction. This average bias model is then combined with the dark matter PDF,\nneglecting any scatter around it: it nevertheless yields an excellent model for\ndensities-in-cells statistics of mass tracers that is parametrised in terms of\nthe underlying dark matter variance and three bias parameters. The procedure is\nvalidated on measurements of both the one and two point statistics of subhalo\ndensities in the state-of-the-art Horizon Run 4 simulation showing excellent\nagreement for measured dark matter variance and bias parameters. Finally, it is\ndemonstrated that this formalism allows for a joint estimation of the nonlinear\ndark matter variance and the bias parameters using solely the statistics of\nsubhaloes. Having verified that galaxy counts in hydrodynamical simulations\nsampled on a scale of 10 Mpc/h closely resemble those of subhaloes, this work\nprovides important steps towards making theoretical predictions for\ndensity-in-cells statistics applicable to upcoming galaxy surveys like Euclid\nor WFIRST.\n", "  We compare a large suite of theoretical cosmological models to observational\ndata from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation\nmeasurements of expansion, Type Ia SNe measurements of expansion, redshift\nspace distortion measurements of the growth of structure, and the local Hubble\nconstant. Our theoretical models include parametrizations of dark energy as\nwell as physical models of dark energy and modified gravity. We determine the\nconstraints on the model parameters, incorporating the redshift space\ndistortion data directly in the analysis. To determine whether models can be\nruled out, we evaluate the $p$ value (the probability under the model of\nobtaining data as bad or worse than the observed data). In our comparison, we\nfind the well known tension of H$_0$ with the other data; no model resolves\nthis tension successfully. Among the models we consider, the large scale growth\nof structure data does not affect the modified gravity models as a category\nparticularly differently than dark energy models; it matters for some modified\ngravity models but not others, and the same is true for dark energy models. We\ncompute predicted observables for each model under current observational\nconstraints, and identify models for which future observational constraints\nwill be particularly informative.\n", "  We release the AllWISE counterparts and Gaia matches to 106,573 and 17,665\nX-ray sources detected in the ROSAT 2RXS and XMMSL2 surveys with |b|>15. These\nare the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, but their position uncertainties\nand the sparse multi-wavelength coverage until now rendered the identification\nof their counterparts a demanding task with uncertain results. New all-sky\nmulti-wavelength surveys of sufficient depth, like AllWISE and Gaia, and a new\nBayesian statistics based algorithm, NWAY, allow us, for the first time, to\nprovide reliable counterpart associations. NWAY extends previous distance and\nsky density based association methods and, using one or more priors (e.g.,\ncolors, magnitudes), weights the probability that sources from two or more\ncatalogues are simultaneously associated on the basis of their observable\ncharacteristics. Here, counterparts have been determined using a WISE\ncolor-magnitude prior. A reference sample of 4524 XMM/Chandra and Swift X-ray\nsources demonstrates a reliability of ~ 94.7% (2RXS) and 97.4% (XMMSL2).\nCombining our results with Chandra-COSMOS data, we propose a new separation\nbetween stars and AGN in the X-ray/WISE flux-magnitude plane, valid over six\norders of magnitude. We also release the NWAY code and its user manual. NWAY\nwas extensively tested with XMM-COSMOS data. Using two different sets of\npriors, we find an agreement of 96% and 99% with published Likelihood Ratio\nmethods. Our results were achieved faster and without any follow-up visual\ninspection. With the advent of deep and wide area surveys in X-rays (e.g.\nSRG/eROSITA, Athena/WFI) and radio (ASKAP/EMU, LOFAR, APERTIF, etc.) NWAY will\nprovide a powerful and reliable counterpart identification tool.\n", "  Recently, Prakash et. al. have discovered bulk superconductivity in single\ncrystals of bismuth, which is a semi metal with extremely low carrier density.\nAt such low density, we argue that conventional electron-phonon coupling is too\nweak to be responsible for the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs. We study\na dynamically screened Coulomb interaction with effective attraction generated\non the scale of the collective plasma modes. We model the electronic states in\nbismuth to include three Dirac pockets with high velocity and one hole pocket\nwith a significantly smaller velocity. We find a weak coupling instability,\nwhich is greatly enhanced by the presence of the hole pocket. Therefore, we\nargue that bismuth is the first material to exhibit superconductivity driven by\nretardation effects of Coulomb repulsion alone. By using realistic parameters\nfor bismuth we find that the acoustic plasma mode does not play the central\nrole in pairing. We also discuss a matrix element effect, resulting from the\nDirac nature of the conduction band, which may affect $T_c$ in the $s$-wave\nchannel without breaking time-reversal symmetry.\n", "  We report the discovery and multi-wavelength data analysis of the peculiar\noptical transient, ATLAS17aeu. This transient was identified in the skymap of\nthe LIGO gravitational wave event GW170104 by our ATLAS and Pan-STARRS\ncoverage. ATLAS17aeu was discovered 23.1hrs after GW170104 and rapidly faded\nover the next 3 nights, with a spectrum revealing a blue featureless continuum.\nThe transient was also detected as a fading x-ray source by Swift and in the\nradio at 6 and 15 GHz. A gamma ray burst GRB170105A was detected by 3\nsatellites 19.04hrs after GW170104 and 4.10hrs before our first optical\ndetection. We analyse the multi-wavelength fluxes in the context of the known\nGRB population and discuss the observed sky rates of GRBs and their afterglows.\nWe find it statistically likely that ATLAS17aeu is an afterglow associated with\nGRB170105A, with a chance coincidence ruled out at the 99\\% confidence or\n2.6$\\sigma$. A long, soft GRB within a redshift range of $1 \\lesssim z \\lesssim\n2.9$ would be consistent with all the observed multi-wavelength data. The\nPoisson probability of a chance occurrence of GW170104 and ATLAS17aeu is\n$p=0.04$. This is the probability of a chance coincidence in 2D sky location\nand in time. These observations indicate that ATLAS17aeu is plausibly a normal\nGRB afterglow at significantly higher redshift than the distance constraint for\nGW170104 and therefore a chance coincidence. However if a redshift of the faint\nhost were to place it within the GW170104 distance range, then physical\nassociation with GW170104 should be considered.\n", "  We present results from consistent dynamo simulations, where the electrically\nconducting and incompressible flow inside a cylinder vessel is forced by moving\nimpellers numerically implemented by a penalization method. The numerical\nscheme models jumps of magnetic permeability for the solid impellers,\nresembling various configurations tested experimentally in the von-Karman\nSodium experiment. The most striking experimental observations are reproduced\nin our set of simulations. In particular, we report on the existence of an\naxisymmetric dynamo mode, self-consistently generated when the magnetic\npermeability of the impellers exceeds a threshold. We describe a possible\nscenario involving both the turbulent flow in the vicinity of the impellers and\nthe high magnetic permeability of the impellers.\n", "  We study a five dimensional Horava-Lifshitz like scalar QED with dynamical\nexponent z=2. Consistency of the renormalization procedure requires the\npresence of four quartic and one six-fold scalar couplings besides the terms\nbilinear in the scalar fields. We compute one-loop radiative corrections to the\nparameters in the original Lagrangian employing dimensional regularization in\nthe spacial part of the Feynman integrals and prove the relevant Ward\nidentities. By using renormalization group methods, we determine the behavior\nof the coupling constants with changes in the energy and discuss the emergence\nof Lorentz symmetry at low energies.\n", "  The Bessel-inspired behavior of parton densities at small Bjorken $x$ values,\nobtained in the case of the flat initial conditions for DGLAP evolution\nequations, is used along with \"frozen\" and analytic modifications of the strong\ncoupling constant to study the so-called EMC effect. Among other results, this\napproach allowed predicting small $x$ behavior of the gluon density in nuclei.\n", "  Threshold of the transverse mode coupling instability is calculated in\nframeworks of the square well model at arbitrary value of space charge tune\nshift. A new method of calculation is developed beyond the traditional\nexpansion technique. The square, resistive, and exponential wakes are\ninvestigated. It is shown that the instability threshold goes up without limit\nwhen the tune shift increases. A resemblance of the results to conventional\ncase of the parabolic potential well is demonstrated and explained.\n", "  Determining the gas density and temperature structures of protoplanetary\ndisks is a fundamental task to constrain planet formation theories. This is a\nchallenging procedure and most determinations are based on model-dependent\nassumptions. We attempt a direct determination of the radial and vertical\ntemperature structure of the Flying Saucer disk, thanks to its favorable\ninclination of 90 degrees. We present a method based on the tomographic study\nof an edge-on disk. Using ALMA, we observe at 0.5$\"$ resolution the Flying\nSaucer in CO J=2-1 and CS J=5-4. This edge-on disk appears in silhouette\nagainst the CO J=2-1 emission from background molecular clouds in $\\rho$ Oph.\nThe combination of velocity gradients due to the Keplerian rotation of the disk\nand intensity variations in the CO background as a function of velocity provide\na direct measure of the gas temperature as a function of radius and height\nabove the disk mid-plane. The overall thermal structure is consistent with\nmodel predictions, with a cold ($< 15-12 $~K), CO-depleted mid-plane, and a\nwarmer disk atmosphere. However, we find evidence for CO gas along the\nmid-plane beyond a radius of about 200\\,au, coincident with a change of grain\nproperties. Such a behavior is expected in case of efficient rise of UV\npenetration re-heating the disk and thus allowing CO thermal desorption or\nfavoring direct CO photo-desorption. CO is also detected up to 3-4 scale\nheights while CS is confined around 1 scale height above the mid-plane. The\nlimits of the method due to finite spatial and spectral resolutions are also\ndiscussed. This method appears to be very promising to determine the gas\nstructure of planet-forming disks, provided that the molecular data have an\nangular resolution which is high enough, of the order of $0.3 - 0.1\"$ at the\ndistance of the nearest star forming regions.\n", "  The emergence of intellectual property as an academic issue opens a big gate\nto a cross-disciplinary field. Different disciplines start a dialogue in the\nframework of the international multilateral treaties in the early 90's. As\nglobal economy demands new knowledge on intellectual property, Science grows at\nits own pace. However, the degree of consolidation of cross-disciplinary\nacademic communities is not clear. In order to know how closely related are\nthese communities, this paper proposes a mixed methodology to find invisible\ncolleges in the production about intellectual property. The articles examined\nin this paper were extracted from Web of Science. The analyzed period was from\n1994 to 2016, taking into account the signature of the agreement on\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in the early 90's. A\ntotal amount of 1580 papers were processed through co-citation network\nanalysis. An especial technique, which combine algorithms of community\ndetection and defining population of articles through thresholds of shared\nreferences, was applied. In order to contrast the invisible colleges that\nemerged with the existence of formal institutional relations, it was made a\nqualitative tracking of the authors with respect to their institutional\naffiliation, lines of research and meeting places. Both methods show that the\nsubjects of interest can be grouped into 13 different issues related to\nintellectual property field. Even though most of them are related to Laws and\nEconomics, there are weak linkages between disciplines which could indicate the\nconstruction of a cross-disciplinary field.\n", "  The spectral approach to infinite disordered crystals is applied to an\nAnderson-type Hamiltonian to demonstrate the existence of extended states for\nnonzero disorder in 2D lattices of different geometries. The numerical\nsimulations shown prove that extended states exist for disordered honeycomb,\ntriangular, and square crystals. This observation stands in contrast to the\npredictions of scaling theory, and aligns with experiments in photonic lattices\nand electron systems. The method used is the only theoretical approach aimed at\nshowing delocalization. A comparison of the results for the three geometries\nindicates that the triangular and honeycomb lattices experience transition in\nthe transport behavior for same amount of disorder, which is to be expected\nfrom planar duality. This provides justification for the use of\nartificially-prepared triangular lattices as analogues for honeycomb materials,\nsuch as graphene. The analysis also shows that the transition in the honeycomb\ncase happens more abruptly as compared to the other two geometries, which can\nbe attributed to the number of nearest neighbors. We outline the advantages of\nthe spectral approach as a viable alternative to scaling theory and discuss its\napplicability to transport problems in both quantum and classical 2D systems.\n", "  The spectrum of primordial gravitational waves is one of the most robust\ninflationary observables, often thought of as a direct probe of the energy\nscale of inflation. We present a simple model, where the dynamics controlling\nthis observable is very different than in the standard paradigm of inflation.\nThe model is based on a peculiar finite density phase---the magnetic\ngaugid---which stems from a highly non-linear effective theory of a triplet of\nabelian gauge fields. The gaugid extends the notion of homogeneous isotropic\nsolid, in that its spectrum of fluctuations includes helicity-2 phonons. We\nshow how, upon implementing the gaugid to drive inflation, the helicity-2\nphonon mixes with the graviton, significantly affecting the size of the\nprimordial tensor spectrum. The rest of the features of the theory, in\nparticular the vector and scalar perturbations, closely resemble those of solid\ninflation.\n", "  Metrological AFM measurements are performed on the silica glass interfaces of\nphotonic band-gap fibres and hollow capillaries. The freezing of attenuated\nout-of-equilibrium capillary waves during the drawing process is shown to\nresult in a reduced surface roughness. The roughness attenuation with respect\nto the expected thermodynamical limit is determined to vary with the drawing\nstress following a power law. A striking anisotropic character of the height\ncorrelation is observed: glass surfaces thus retain a structural record of the\ndirection of the flow to which the liquid was submitted.\n", "  We study a class of disordered continuous classical spin systems including\nthe kagome Heisenberg magnet. While each term in its local Hamiltonian can be\nindependently minimised, we find {\\it discrete} degenerate ground states whose\nnumber grows exponentially with system size. These states do not exhibit\nzero-energy `excitations' characteristic of highly frustrated magnets but\ninstead are local minima of the energy landscape, albeit with an anomalously\nsoft excitation spectrum. This represents a spin liquid version of the\nphenomenon of jamming familiar from granular media and structural glasses.\nCorrelations of this jammed spin liquid, which upon increasing the disorder\nstrength gives way to a conventional spin glass, may be algebraic\n(Coulomb-type) or exponential.\n", "  Dynamical phase transitions are defined as non-analytic points of the large\ndeviation function of current fluctuations. We show that for boundary driven\nsystems, many dynamical phase transitions can be identified using the\ngeometrical structure of an effective potential of a Hamiltonian, recovered\nfrom the macroscopic fluctuation theory description. Using this method we\nidentify new dynamical phase transitions that could not be recovered using\nexisting perturbative methods. Moreover, using the Hamiltonian picture, an\nexperimental scheme is suggested to demonstrate an analog of dynamical phase\ntransitions in linear, rather than exponential, time.\n", "  We present the design, characterization, and testing of a laboratory\nprototype radiological search and localization system. The system, based on\ntime-encoded imaging, uses the attenuation signature of neutrons in time,\ninduced by the geometrical layout and motion of the system. We have\ndemonstrated the ability to detect a ~1 mCi Cf-252 radiological source at 100 m\nstandoff with 90% detection efficiency and 10% false positives against\nbackground in 12 min. This same detection efficiency is met at 15 s for a 40 m\nstandoff, and 1.2 s for a 20 m standoff.\n", "  We report the first measurement of differential and total cross sections for\nthe ${\\gamma}d \\to K^0{\\Lambda}(p)$ reaction, using data from the CLAS detector\nat the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Data collected during\ntwo separate experimental runs were studied with photon-energy coverage 0.8 -\n3.6 GeV and 0.5 - 2.6 GeV, respectively. The two measurements are consistent\ngiving confidence in the method and determination of systematic uncertainties.\nThe cross sections are compared with predictions from the KAON-MAID theoretical\nmodel (without kaon exchange), which deviate from the data at higher W and at\nforward kaon angles. These data, along with previously published cross sections\nfor $K^+ {\\Lambda}$ photoproduction, provide essential constraints on the\nnucleon resonance spectrum. A first partial wave analysis has been performed\nthat describes the data without the introduction of new resonances.\n", "  We present a quantitative model for magneto-optical traps operating on narrow\ntransitions, where the transition linewidth and the recoil shift are\ncomparable. We combine a quantum treatment of the light scattering process with\na Monte-Carlo simulation of the atomic motion. By comparing our model to an\nexperiment operating on the $5\\rm{s}^2~^1\\rm{S}_0 \\rightarrow\n5\\rm{s}5\\rm{p}~^3\\rm{P}_1$ transition in strontium, we show that it\nquantitatively reproduces the cloud size, position, temperature and dynamics\nover a wide range of operating conditions, without any adjustable parameters.\nWe also present an extension of the model that quantitatively reproduces the\ntransfer of atoms into a far off-resonance dipole trap (FORT), highlighting its\nuse as a tool for optimising complex cold atom experiments.\n", "  We present the analysis of KIC 8164262, a heartbeat star with a\nhigh-amplitude (~1 mmag), tidally resonant pulsation (a mode in resonance with\nthe orbit) at 229 times the orbital frequency and a plethora of tidally induced\ng-mode pulsations (modes excited by the orbit). The analysis combines Kepler\nlight curves with follow-up spectroscopic data from the Keck telescope, KPNO\n(Kitt Peak National Observatory) 4-m Mayal telescope and the 2.7-m telescope at\nthe McDonald observatory. We apply the binary modelling software, PHOEBE, to\nthe Kepler light curve and radial velocity data to determine a detailed binary\nstar model that includes the prominent pulsation and Doppler boosting,\nalongside the usual attributes of a binary star model (including tidal\ndistortion and reflection). The results show that the system contains a\nslightly evolved F star with an M secondary companion in a highly eccentric\norbit (e = 0.886). We use the results of the binary star model in a companion\npaper (Fuller et al., 2017) where we show that the prominent pulsation can be\nexplained by a tidally excited oscillation mode held near resonance by a\nresonance locking mechanism.\n", "  Flow of particles of two different species through a narrow channel with\nsolely two discrete spatial positions is analyzed with respect to the species'\ncapability to cooperate or compete for transport. In contrast to mean field\napproaches, spatial correlations are explicitly conserved. A strong repulsive\ninteraction between particles of the same kind and a very attractive channel\nimply a strong entanglement of transport of both species. This is reflected by\nthe magnitude of transition flows in state space which in the extreme case of\nperfect coupling are restricted to a cyclic sub space. Entanglement of\ntransport implies that the species mutually exert entropic forces on each\nother. For parallel directed concentration gradients this implies that the\nspecies' ability to cooperate increases with the degree of entanglement. Thus,\nthe gradient of one species reciprocally induce a higher flow of the other\nspecies when compared to that in its absence. The opposite holds for\nantiparallel gradients where species mutually hamper their transport. For a\nsufficient strong coupling, the species under the influence of the stronger\nconcentration gradient drives the other against its gradient, i.e. flow and\ngradient of the driven species become antiparallel. Hence, besides the positive\nentropy production generated by the driving species a negative component of\nentropy production of the driven species emerges. The sources of both, positive\nand negative entropy production, can be localized in state space. The stronger\nthe coupling of transport the higher is the degree of efficiency, i.e. the\namount of negative entropy production on cost of the positive one.\n", "  Despite more than 20 years since the discovery of the first gas giant planet\nwith an anomalously large radius, the mechanism for planet inflation remains\nunknown. Here, we report the discovery of EPIC228754001.01, an inflated gas\ngiant planet found with the NASA K2 Mission, and a revised mass for another\ninflated planet, K2-97b. These planets reside on ~9 day orbits around host\nstars which recently evolved into red giants. We constrain the irradiation\nhistory of these planets using models constrained by asteroseismology and\nKeck/HIRES spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements. We measure planet\nradii of 1.31 +\\- 0.11 Rjup and and 1.30 +\\- 0.07 Rjup, respectively. These\nradii are typical for planets receiving the current irradiation, but not the\nformer, zero age main sequence irradiation of these planets. This suggests that\nthe current sizes of these planets are directly correlated to their current\nirradiation. Our precise constraints of the masses and radii of the stars and\nplanets in these systems allow us to constrain the planetary heating efficiency\nof both systems as 0.03% +0.03%/-0.02%. These results are consistent with a\nplanet re-inflation scenario, but suggest the efficiency of planet re-inflation\nmay be lower than previously theorized. Finally, we discuss the agreement\nwithin 10% of stellar masses and radii, and planet masses, radii, and orbital\nperiods of both systems and speculate that this may be due to selection bias in\nsearching for planets around evolved stars.\n", "  The search for metal-free stars has so far been unsuccessful, proving that if\nthere are surviving stars from the first generation, they are rare, they have\nbeen polluted, or we have been looking in the wrong place. To predict the\nlikely location of Population~III (Pop~III) survivors, we semi-analytically\nmodel early star formation in progenitors of Milky Way-like galaxies and their\nenvironments. We base our model on merger trees from the high-resolution dark\nmatter only simulation suite \\textit{Caterpillar}. Radiative and chemical\nfeedback are taken into account self-consistently, based on the spatial\ndistribution of the haloes. Our results are consistent with the non-detection\nof Pop III survivors in the Milky Way today. We find that possible surviving\nPopulation III stars are more common in Milky Way satellites than in the main\nGalaxy. In particular, low mass Milky Way satellites contain a much larger\nfraction of Pop~III stars than the Milky Way. Such nearby, low mass Milky Way\nsatellites are promising targets for future attempts to find Pop~III survivors,\nespecially for high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic\nobservations. We provide the probabilities for finding a Pop~III survivor in\nthe red giant branch phase for all known Milky Way satellites to guide future\nobservations.\n", "  We examine the spatial field of orientations of slender fibers that are\nadvected by a two-dimensional fluid flow. The orientation field of these\npassive directors are important in a wide range of industrial and geophysical\nflows. We introduce emergent scar lines as the dominant coherent structures in\nthe orientation field of passive directors in chaotic flows. Previous work has\nidentified the existence of scar lines where the orientation rotates by {\\pi}\nover short distances, but the lines that were identified disappeared as time\nprogressed. As a result, earlier work focused on topological singularities in\nthe orientation field which we find to play a negligible role at long times. We\nuse the standard map as a simple time-periodic two-dimensional (2D) flow that\nproduces Lagrangian chaos. This class of flows produce persistent patterns in\npassive scalar advection, and we find that a different kind of persistent\npattern develops in the passive director orientation field. We identify the\nmechanism by which emergent scar lines grow to dominate these patterns at long\ntimes in complex flows. Emergent scar lines form where the recent stretching of\nthe fluid element is perpendicular to earlier stretching. Thus these scar lines\ncan be labeled by their age, defined as the time since their stretching reached\na maximum.\n", "  The event detection rates for the WIMP (a dark matter candidate) are\ncalculated with $^{73}$Ge as the detector. The calculations are performed\nwithin the deformed shell model (DSM) based on Hartree-Fock states. First the\nenergy levels and magnetic moment for the ground state and two low lying\npositive parity states for this nucleus are calculated and compared with\nexperiment. The agreement is quite satisfactory. Then the nuclear wave\nfunctions are used to investigate the elastic and inelastic scattering of WIMP\nfrom $^{73}$Ge. The nuclear structure factors which are independent of\nsupersymmetric model are also calculated as a function of WIMP mass. The event\nrates are calculated for a given set of SUSY parameters. The calculation shows\nthat $^{73}$Ge is a good detector for detecting dark matter.\n", "  We study the imprint of non-standard dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM)\nmodels on the 21cm intensity map power spectra from high-redshift neutral\nhydrogen (HI) gas. To this purpose we use halo catalogs from N-body simulations\nof dynamical DE models and DM scenarios which are statistically\nindistinguishable from the standard Cold Dark Matter model with Cosmological\nConstant (LCDM) using currently available cosmological observations. We limit\nour analysis to halo catalogs at redshift z = 1 and 2.3 which are common to all\nsimulations. For each catalog we model the HI distribution by using a simple\nprescription to associate the HI gas mass to N-body halos. We find that the DE\nmodels leave a distinct signature on the HI spectra across a wide range of\nscales, which correlates with differences in the halo mass function and the\nonset of the non-linear regime of clustering. In the case of the non-standard\nDM model significant differences of the HI spectra with respect to the LCDM\nmodel only arise from the suppressed abundance of low mass halos. These\ncosmological model dependent features also appear in the 21cm spectra. In\nparticular, we find that future SKA measurements can distinguish the imprints\nof DE and DM models at high statistical significance.\n", "  Galaxy clusters represent excellent laboratories to search for Axion-Like\nParticles (ALPs). They contain magnetic fields which can induce\nquasi-sinusoidal oscillations in the X-ray spectra of AGNs situated in or\nbehind them. Due to its excellent energy resolution, the X-ray Integral Field\nUnit (X-IFU) instrument onboard the Athena X-ray Observatory will be far more\nsensitive to ALP-induced modulations than current detectors. As a first\nanalysis of the sensitivity of Athena to the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a \\gamma\n\\gamma}$, we simulate observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC1275 in the Perseus\ncluster using the SIXTE simulation software. We estimate that for a 200ks\nexposure, a non-observation of spectral modulations will constrain\n${g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}\\lesssim1.5\\times10^{-13}\\rm{GeV}^{-1}}$ for $m_a \\lesssim\n10^{-12} \\rm{eV}$, representing an order of magnitude improvement over\nconstraints derived using the current generation of satellites.\n", "  Recently we have studied in great detail a model of Hybrid Natural Inflation\n(HNI) by constructing two simple effective field theories. These two versions\nof the model allow inflationary energy scales as small as the electroweak scale\nin one of them or as large as the Grand Unification scale in the other,\ntherefore covering the whole range of possible energy scales. In any case the\ninflationary sector of the model is of the form $V(\\phi)=V_0 \\left(1+a\n\\cos(\\phi/f)\\right)$ where $0\\leq a<1$ and the end of inflation is triggered by\nan independent waterfall field. One interesting characteristic of this model is\nthat the slow-roll parameter $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ is a non-monotonic function of\n$\\phi$ presenting a {\\it maximum} close to the inflection point of the\npotential. Because the scalar spectrum $\\mathcal{P}_s(k)$ of density\nfluctuations when written in terms of the potential is inversely proportional\nto $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ we find that $\\mathcal{P}_s(k)$ presents a {\\it minimum} at\n$\\phi_{min}$. The origin of the HNI potential can be traced to a symmetry\nbreaking phenomenon occurring at some energy scale $f$ which gives rise to a\n(massless) Goldstone boson. Non-perturbative physics at some temperature $T<f$\nmight occur which provides a potential (and a small mass) to the originally\nmassless boson to become the inflaton (a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson). Thus\nthe inflaton energy scale $\\Delta$ is bounded by the symmetry breaking scale,\n$\\Delta\\equiv V_H^{1/4} <f.$ To have such a well defined origin and hierarchy\nof scales in inflationary models is not common. We use this property of HNI to\ndetermine bounds for the inflationary energy scale $\\Delta$ and for the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.\n", "  The SHINE program is a large high-contrast near-infrared survey of 600 young,\nnearby stars. It is aimed at searching for and characterizing new planetary\nsystems using VLT/SPHERE's unprecedented high-contrast and high-angular\nresolution imaging capabilities. It also intends at placing statistical\nconstraints on the occurrence and orbital properties of the giant planet\npopulation at large orbits as a function of the stellar host mass and age to\ntest planet formation theories. We use the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS\nintegral field spectrograph of SPHERE to acquire high-constrast coronagraphic\ndifferential near-infrared images and spectra of the young A2 star HIP65426. It\nis a member of the ~17 Myr old Lower Centaurus-Crux association. At a\nseparation of 830 mas (92 au projected) from the star, we detect a faint red\ncompanion. Multi-epoch observations confirm that it shares common proper motion\nwith HIP65426. Spectro-photometric measurements extracted with IFS and IRDIS\nbetween 0.95 and 2.2um indicate a warm, dusty atmosphere characteristic of\nyoung low surface-gravity L5-L7 dwarfs. Hot-start evolutionary models predict a\nluminosity consistent with a 6-12 MJup, Teff=1300-1600 K and R=1.5 RJup giant\nplanet. Finally, the comparison with Exo-REM and PHOENIX BT-Settl synthetic\natmosphere models gives consistent effective temperatures but with slightly\nhigher surface gravity solutions of log(g)=4.0-5.0 with smaller radii (1.0-1.3\nRJup). Given its physical and spectral properties, HIP65426b occupies a rather\nunique placement in terms of age, mass and spectral-type among the currently\nknown imaged planets. It represents a particularly interesting case to study\nthe presence of clouds as a function of particle size, composition, and\nlocation in the atmosphere, to search for signatures of non-equilibrium\nchemistry, and finally to test the theory of planet formation and evolution.\n", "  The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter is an essential ingredient for\nnumerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. The\nproperties of matter near and above nuclear saturation density are uncertain,\nwhich translates into uncertainties in astrophysical simulations and their\nmulti-messenger signatures. Therefore, a wide range of EOSs spanning the\nallowed range of nuclear interactions are necessary for determining the\nsensitivity of these astrophysical phenomena and their signatures to variations\nin input microphysics. We present a new set of finite temperature EOSs based on\nexperimentally allowed Skyrme forces. We employ a liquid drop model of nuclei\nto capture the non-uniform phase of nuclear matter at sub-saturation density,\nwhich is blended into a nuclear statistical equilibrium EOS at lower densities.\nWe also provide a new, open-source code for calculating EOSs for arbitrary\nSkyrme parametrizations. We then study the effects of different Skyrme\nparametrizations on thermodynamical properties of dense astrophysical matter,\nthe neutron star mass-radius relationship, and the core collapse of 15 and 40\nsolar mass stars.\n", "  The signaling between two observers in 3+1 dimensional flat spacetime coupled\nlocally to a non-local field is considered. We show that in the case where two\nobservers are purely timelike related -- so that an exchange of on-shell\nmassless quanta cannot occur -- signaling is still possible because of a\nviolation of Huygens' principle. In particular, we show that the signaling is\nexponentially suppressed by the non-locality scale. Furthermore, we consider\nthe case in which the two observers are light-like related and show that the\nnon-local modification to the local result is polynomially suppressed in the\nnon-locality scale. This may have implications for phenomenological tests of\nnon-local theories.\n", "  The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large spectroscopic survey that provides a\nunique opportunity to study the distribution of spectroscopic multiple systems\namong different populations of the Galaxy. We aim at detecting\nbinarity/multiplicity for stars targeted by the GES from the analysis of the\ncross-correlation functions (CCFs) of the GES spectra with spectral templates.\nWe develop a method based on the computation of the CCF successive derivatives\nto detect multiple peaks and determine their radial velocities, even when the\npeaks are strongly blended. The parameters of the detection of extrema (DOE)\ncode have been optimized for each GES GIRAFFE and UVES setup to maximize\ndetection. This code therefore allows to automatically detect multiple line\nspectroscopic binaries (SBn, n>1). We apply this method on the fourth GES\ninternal data release and detect 354 SBn candidates (342 SB2, 11 SB3 and even\none SB4), including only 9 SB2 known in the literature. This implies that about\n98% of these SBn candidates are new (because of their faint visual magnitude\nthat can reach V=19). Visual inspection of the SBn candidate spectra reveals\nthat the most probable candidates have indeed a composite spectrum. Among SB2\ncandidates, an orbital solution could be computed for two previously unknown\nbinaries: 06404608+0949173 (known as V642 Mon) in NGC 2264 and 19013257-0027338\nin Berkeley 81. A detailed analysis of the unique SB4 (four peaks in the CCF)\nreveals that HD 74438 in the open cluster IC 2391 is a physically bound stellar\nquadruple system. The SB candidates belonging to stellar clusters are reviewed\nin detail to discard false detections. We warn against the use of atmospheric\nparameters for these system components rather than by SB-specific pipelines.\nOur implementation of an automatic detection of spectroscopic binaries within\nthe GES has allowed an efficient discovery of many new multiple systems.\n", "  We present a version of soft glassy rheology that includes thermalized strain\ndegrees of freedom. It fully specifies systems' strain-history-dependent\npositions on their energy landscapes and therefore allows for quantitative\nanalysis of their heterogeneous yielding dynamics and nonequilibrium\ndeformation thermodynamics. As a demonstration of the method, we illustrate the\nvery different characteristics of fully-thermal and nearly-athermal plasticity\nby comparing results for thermalized and nonthermalized plastic flow.\n", "  Tidal dissipation inside giant planets is important for the orbital evolution\nof their natural satellites. It is conventionally treated by parameterized\nequilibrium tidal theory, in which the tidal torque declines rapidly with\ndistance, and orbital expansion was faster in the past. However, Lainey et al.\n(2017) find that some Saturnian satellites are currently migrating outward\nfaster than predicted by equilibrium tidal theory. Resonance locking between\nsatellites and internal oscillations of Saturn, proposed by Fuller et al.\n(2016), naturally matches the observed migration rates. Here, we show that the\nresonance locking theory predicts dynamical tidal perturbations to Saturn's\ngravitational field in addition to those produced by equilibrium tidal bulges.\nWe show that these perturbations can likely be detected during Cassini's\nproximal orbits if migration of satellites results from resonant gravity modes,\nbut will likely be undetectable if migration results from inertial wave\nattractors or dissipation of the equilibrium tide. Additionally, we show that\nthe detection of gravity modes would place constraints on the size of the\nhypothetical stably stratified region in Saturn.\n", "  We report results of a deep all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves\nfrom isolated neutron stars in data from the first Advanced LIGO observing run.\nThis search investigates the low frequency range of Advanced LIGO data, between\n20 and 100 Hz, much of which was not explored in initial LIGO. The search was\nmade possible by the computing power provided by the volunteers of the\nEinstein@Home project. We find no significant signal candidate and set the most\nstringent upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational wave signals\nfrom the target population, corresponding to a sensitivity depth of 48.7\n[1/$\\sqrt{{\\textrm{Hz}}}$]. At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near\n100 Hz, we set 90% confidence upper limits of $1.8 \\times 10^{-25}$. At the low\nend of our frequency range, 20 Hz, we achieve upper limits of $3.9 \\times\n10^{-24}$. At 55 Hz we can exclude sources with ellipticities greater than\n$10^{-5}$ within 100 pc of Earth with fiducial value of the principal moment of\ninertia of $10^{38} \\textrm{kg m}^2$.\n", "  A noncommutative extension of an ideal (Hamiltonian) fluid model in\n$3+1$-dimensions is proposed. The model enjoys several interesting features: it\nallows a multi-parameter central extension in Galilean boost algebra (which is\nsignificant being contrary to existing belief that similar feature can appear\nonly in $2+1$-dim.); noncommutativity generates vorticity in a canonically\nirrotational fluid; it induces a non-barotropic pressure leading to a\nnon-isentropic system. (Barotropic fluids are entropy preserving as pressure\ndepends only on matter density.)\n  Our fluid model is termed \"Exotic\" since it has close resemblance with the\nextensively studied planar (2+1-dim.) Exotic models and Exotic (noncommutative)\nfield theories.\n", "  The cosmological coincidences between the matter and radiation energy\ndensities at recombination as well as between the densities of matter and the\ncosmological constant at present time are well known. We point out that\nmoreover the third intersection between the energy densities of radiation and\nthe cosmological constant coincides with the reionization epoch. To quantify\nthe statistical relevance of this concurrence, we compute the Bayes factor\nbetween the concordance cosmology with free Thomson scattering optical depth\nand a model for which this parameter is inferred from imposing a match between\nthe time of density equality and the epoch of reionization. This is to\ncharacterize the potential explanatory gain if one were to find a\nparameter-free physical connection. We find a very strong preference for such a\nconcurrence on the Jeffreys scale from current cosmological observations. We\nfurthermore discuss the effect of choice of priors, changes in reionization\nhistory, and free sum of neutrino masses. We also estimate the impact of adding\nintermediate polarization data from the Planck High Frequency Instrument and\nprospects for future 21 cm surveys. In the first case, preference for the\ncorrelation remains substantial, whereas future data may give results more\ndecisive in pro or substantial in contra. Finally, we provide a discussion on\ndifferent interpretations of these findings. In particular, we show how a\nconnection between the star-formation history and the cosmological background\ndynamics can give rise to this concurrence.\n", "  Iridates supply fertile grounds for unconventional phenomena and exotic\nelectronic phases. With respect to well-studied octahedrally-coordinated\niridates, we pay our attention to a rather unexplored iridate, Na4IrO4, showing\nan unusual square-planar coordination. The latter is key to rationalize the\nelectronic structure and magnetic property of Na4IrO4, which is here explored\nby first-principles density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Due\nto the uncommon square-planar crystal field, Ir 5d states adopt\nintermediate-spin state with double occupation of dz2 orbital, leading to a\nsizable local spin moment, at variance with many other iridates. The\nsquare-planar crystal field splitting is also crucial in opening a robust\ninsulating gap in Na4IrO4, irrespective of the specific magnetic ordering or\ntreatment of electronic correlations. Spin-orbit coupling plays a minor role in\nshaping the electronic structure, but leads to a strong magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy. The easy axis perpendicular to the IrO4 plaquette, well explained\nusing perturbation theory, is again closely related to the square-planar\ncoordination. Finally, the large single-ion anisotropy suppresses the spin\nfrustration and stabilizes a collinear antiferromagnetic long-range magnetic\nordering, as confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations predicting a quite low N\\'eel\ntemperature, expected from almost isolated IrO4 square-planar units as\ncrystalline building blocks.\n", "  The next generation of CMB experiments (CMB Stage-4) will produce a\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster catalog containing $\\sim10^{5}$ objects, two\norders of magnitudes more than currently available. In this paper, we discuss\nthe detectability of the polarized signal generated by scattering of the CMB\nquadrupole on the cluster electron gas using this catalog. We discuss the\npossibility of using this signal to measure the relationship between cluster\noptical depth and mass. We find that the area of observation of S4 maximizes\nthe signal-to-noise (S/N) on the polarized signal but that this S/N is\nextremely small for an individual cluster, of order 0.5% for a typical cluster\nin our catalog, the main source of noise being the residual primordial E-mode\nsignal. However, we find that the signal could be detected using the full\ncluster catalog and that the significance of the result will increase linearly\nwith the size of the CMB S4 telescope mirror.\n", "  We present a new veto procedure to distinguish between continuous\ngravitational wave (CW) signals and the detector artifacts that can mimic their\nbehavior. The veto procedure exploits the fact that a long-lasting coherent\ndisturbance is less likely than a real signal to exhibit a Doppler modulation\nof astrophysical origin. Therefore, in the presence of an outlier from a\nsearch, we perform a multi-step search around the frequency of the outlier with\nthe Doppler modulation turned off (DM-off), and compare these results with the\nresults from the original (DM-on) search. If the results from the DM-off search\nare more significant than those from the DM-on search, the outlier is most\nlikely due to an artifact rather than a signal. We tune the veto procedure so\nthat it has a very low false dismissal rate. With this veto, we are able to\nidentify as coherent disturbances >99.9% of the 6349 candidates from the recent\nall-sky low-frequency Einstein@Home search on the data from the Advanced LIGO\nO1 observing run [1]. We present the details of each identified disturbance in\nthe Appendix.\n", "  Polymorph of 8-Pmmn borophene exhibits anisotropic tilted Dirac cones. In\nthis work, we explore the consequences of the tilted Dirac cones in\nmagnetotransport properties of a periodically modulated borophene. We evaluate\nmodulation induced diffusive conductivity by using linear response theory in\nlow temperature regime. The application of weak modulation (electric/magnetic\nor both) gives rise to the magnetic field dependent non-zero oscillatory drift\nvelocity which causes Weiss oscillation in the longitudinal conductivity at low\nmagnetic field. The Weiss oscillation is studied in presence of an weak spatial\nelectric, magnetic and both modulations individually. The tilting of the Dirac\ncones gives rise to additional contribution to the Weiss oscillation in\nlongitudinal conductivity. Moreover, it also enhances the frequency of the\nWeiss oscillation and modifies its amplitude too. Most remarkably, It is found\nthat the presence of out-of phase both i.e., electric and magnetic modulations\ncan cause a sizable valley polarization in diffusive conductivity. The origin\nof valley polarization lies in the opposite tilting of the two Dirac cones at\ntwo valleys.\n", "  We report on two NuSTAR observations of the HMXB A 0535+26 taken toward the\nend of its normal 2015 outburst at very low $3-50$ keV luminosities of\n${\\sim}1.4\\times10^{36}$ erg/s and ${\\sim}5\\times10^{35}$ erg/s which are\ncomplemented by 9 Swift observations. The data clearly confirm indications seen\nin earlier data that the source's spectral shape softens as it becomes fainter.\nThe smooth, exponential rollover at high energies present in the first\nobservation evolves to a much more abrupt steepening of the spectrum at $20-30$\nkeV. The continuum evolution can be well described with emission from a\nmagnetized accretion column, modeled using the compmag model modified by an\nadditional Gaussian emission component for the fainter observation. Between the\ntwo observations, the optical depth changes from $0.75\\pm0.04$ to\n$0.56^{+0.01}_{-0.04}$, the electron temperature remains constant, and there is\nan indication that the column decreases in radius. Since the energy resolved\npulse profiles remain virtually unchanged in shape between the two\nobservations, the emission properties of the accretion column, however, reflect\nthe same accretion regime. This conclusion is also confirmed by our result that\nthe energy of the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at ${\\sim}45$\nkeV is independent of the luminosity, implying that the magnetic field in the\nregion in which the observed radiation is produced is the same in both\nobservations. Finally, we also constrain the evolution of the continuum\nparameters with rotational phase of the neutron star. The width of the CRSF\ncould only be constrained for the brighter observation. Based on Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of CRSF formation in single accretion columns, its pulse phase\ndependence supports a simplified fan beam emission pattern. The evolution of\nthe CRSF width is very similar to that of the CRSF depth, which is in\ndisagreement with expectations.\n", "  Gamma-ray binaries are thought to be composed of a young pulsar in orbit\naround a massive O or Be star, with their gamma-ray emission powered by pulsar\nspindown. The number of such systems in our Galaxy is not known. We aim to\nestimate the total number of gamma-ray binaries in our Galaxy and to evaluate\nthe prospects for new detections in the GeV and TeV energy range, taking into\naccount that their gamma-ray emission is modulated on the orbital period. We\nmodel the population of gamma-ray binaries and evaluate the fraction of\ndetected systems in surveys with the Fermi-LAT (GeV), HESS, HAWC and CTA (TeV)\nusing observation-based and synthetic template lightcurves. The detected\nfraction depends more on the orbit-average flux than on the lightcurve shape.\nOur best estimate for the number of gamma-ray binaries is 101$_{-52}^{+89}$\nsystems. A handful of discoveries are expected by pursuing the Fermi-LAT\nsurvey. Discoveries in TeV surveys are less likely. However, this depends on\nthe relative amounts of power emitted in GeV and TeV domains. There could be as\nmany as $\\approx$200 HESS J0632+057-like systems with a high ratio of TeV to\nGeV emission compared to other gamma-ray binaries. Statistics allow for as many\nas three discoveries in five years of HAWC observations and five discoveries in\nthe first two years of the CTA Galactic Plane survey. Continued Fermi-LAT\nobservations are favoured over ground-based TeV surveys to find new gamma-ray\nbinaries. Gamma-ray observations are most sensitive to short orbital period\nsystems with a high spindown pulsar power. Radio pulsar surveys (SKA) are\nlikely to be more efficient in detecting long orbital period systems, providing\na complementary probe into the gamma-ray binary population.\n", "  Thermal phase curves of short-period planets on circular orbits provide joint\nconstraints on the fraction of incoming energy that is reflected (Bond albedo)\nand the fraction of absorbed energy radiated by the night hemisphere (heat\nrecirculation efficiency). Many empirical studies of hot Jupiters have\nimplicitly assumed that the dayside is the hottest hemisphere and the nightside\nis the coldest hemisphere. For a given eclipse depth and phase amplitude, an\norbital lag between a planet's peak brightness and its eclipse---a phase\noffset---implies that planet's nightside emits greater flux. To quantify how\nphase offsets impact the energy budgets of short-period planets, we compile all\ninfrared observations of the nine planets with multi-band eclipse depths and\nphase curves. Accounting for phase offsets shifts planets to lower Bond albedo\nand greater day--night heat transport, usually by $\\lesssim 1\\sigma$. For\nWASP-12b, the published phase variations have been analyzed in two different\nways, and the inferred energy budget depends sensitively on which analysis one\nadopts.\\ Our fiducial scenario supports a Bond albedo of\n$0.27^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$, significantly higher than the published optical\ngeometric albedo, and a recirculation efficiency of $0.03^{+0.07}_{-0.02}$,\nfollowing the trend of larger day--night temperature contrast with greater\nstellar irradiation. If instead we adopt the alternative analysis, then\nWASP-12b has a Bond albedo consistent with zero and a much higher recirculation\nefficiency. To definitively determine the energy budget of WASP-12b, new\nobservational analyses will be necessary.\n", "  It has recently been proposed (Loureiro & Boldyrev 2017; Mallet et al. 2017)\nthat the inertial interval in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is\nterminated at small scales not by a Kolmogorov-like dissipation region, but\nrather by a new sub-inertial interval mediated by tearing instability. However,\nmany astrophysical plasmas are nearly collisionless so that the MHD\napproximation is not applicable to turbulence at small scales. In this Letter,\nwe propose the extension of the theory of reconnection-mediated turbulence to\nplasmas which are so weakly collisional that the reconnection occurring in the\nturbulent eddies is caused by electron inertia rather than by resistivity. We\nfind that the transition scale to reconnection-mediated turbulence depends on\nthe plasma beta and on the assumptions of the plasma turbulence model. However,\nin all cases analyzed, the energy spectra in the reconnection-mediated interval\nrange from $E(k)dk\\propto k^{-8/3}dk$ to $E(k)dk\\propto k^{-3}dk$.\n", "  We propose a \"matter-antimatter coexistence method\" for finite-density\nlattice QCD, aiming at a possible solution of the sign problem. In this method,\nwe consider matter and anti-matter systems on two parallel ${\\bf R}^4$-sheets\nin five-dimensional Euclidean space-time. For the matter system $M$ with a\nchemical potential $\\mu \\in {\\bf C}$ on a ${\\bf R}^4$-sheet, we also prepare\nthe anti-matter system $\\bar M$ with $-\\mu^*$ on the other ${\\bf R}^4$-sheet\nshifted in the fifth direction. In the lattice QCD formalism, we introduce a\ncorrelation term between the gauge variables $U_\\nu \\equiv e^{iagA_\\nu}$ in $M$\nand $\\tilde U_\\nu \\equiv e^{iag \\tilde A_\\nu}$ in $\\bar M$, such as $S_\\lambda\n\\equiv \\sum_{x,\\nu} 2\\lambda \\{N_c-{\\rm Re~tr} [U_\\nu(x) \\tilde\nU_\\nu^\\dagger(x)]\\} \\simeq \\sum_x \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda a^2 \\{A_\\nu^a(x)-\\tilde\nA_\\nu^a(x)\\}^2$ with a real parameter $\\lambda$. In the limit of $\\lambda\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, a strong constraint $\\tilde U_\\nu(x)=U_\\nu(x)$ is\nrealized, and the total fermionic determinant is real and non-negative. In the\nlimit of $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$, this system goes to two separated ordinary\nQCD systems with the chemical potential of $\\mu$ and $-\\mu^*$. On a\nfinite-volume lattice, if one takes an enough large value of $\\lambda$, $\\tilde\nU_\\nu(x) \\simeq U_\\nu(x)$ is realized and there occurs a phase cancellation\napproximately between two fermionic determinants in $M$ and $\\bar M$, which is\nexpected to suppress the sign problem and to make the lattice calculation\npossible. For the obtained gauge configurations of the coexistence system,\nmatter-side quantities are evaluated through their measurement only for the\nmatter part $M$. By the calculations with gradually decreasing $\\lambda$ and\ntheir extrapolation to $\\lambda=0$, physical quantities in finite density QCD\nare expected to be estimated.\n", "  In this paper we present the results of the SPHERE observation of the HD\n284149 system, aimed at a more detailed characterisation of both the primary\nand its brown dwarf companion. We observed HD 284149 in the near-infrared with\nSPHERE, using the imaging mode (IRDIS+IFS) and the long-slit spectroscopy mode\n(IRDIS-LSS). The data were reduced using the dedicated SPHERE pipeline, and\nalgorithms such as PCA and TLOCI were applied to reduce the speckle pattern.\nThe IFS images revealed a previously unknown low-mass (~0.16$M_{\\odot}$)\nstellar companion (HD 294149 B) at ~0.1$^{\\prime\\prime}$, compatible with\npreviously observed radial velocity differences, as well as proper motion\ndifferences between Gaia and Tycho-2 measurements. The known brown dwarf\ncompanion (HD 284149 b) is clearly visible in the IRDIS images. This allowed us\nto refine both its photometry and astrometry. The analysis of the medium\nresolution IRDIS long slit spectra also allowed a refinement of temperature and\nspectral type estimates. A full reassessment of the age and distance of the\nsystem was also performed, leading to more precise values of both mass and\nsemi-major axis. As a result of this study, HD 284149 ABb therefore becomes the\nlatest addition to the (short) list of brown dwarfs on wide circumbinary\norbits, providing new evidence to support recent claims that object in such\nconfiguration occur with a similar frequency to wide companions to single\nstars.\n", "  We propose a design of a THz-frequency signal generator based on a layered\nstructure consisting of a current-driven platinum (Pt) layer and a layer of an\nantiferromagnet (AFM) with easy-plane anisotropy, where the magnetization\nvectors of the AFM sublattices are canted inside the easy plane by the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). The DC electric current flowing in the\nPt layer creates, due to the spin-Hall effect, a perpendicular spin current\nthat, being injected in the AFM layer, tilts the DMI-canted AFM sublattices out\nof the easy plane, thus exposing them to the action of a strong internal\nexchange magnetic field of the AFM. The sublattice magnetizations, along with\nthe small net magnetization vector $\\textbf{m}_{\\rm DMI}$ of the canted AFM,\nstart to rotate about the hard anisotropy axis of the AFM with the THz\nfrequency proportional to the injected spin current and the AFM exchange field.\nThe rotation of the small net magnetization $\\textbf{m}_{\\rm DMI}$ results in\nthe THz-frequency dipolar radiation that can be directly received by an\nadjacent (e.g. dielectric) resonator. We demonstrate theoretically that the\nradiation frequencies in the range $f=0.05-2$~THz are possible at the\nexperimentally reachable magnitudes of the driving current density, and\nevaluate the power of the signal radiated into different types of resonators,\nshowing that this power increases with the increase of frequency $f$, and that\nit could exceed 1~$\\mu$W at $f \\sim 0.5$~THz for a typical dielectric resonator\nof the electric permittivity $\\varepsilon \\sim 10$ and quality factor $Q \\sim\n750$.\n", "  We study the effects of the repulsive on-site interactions on the broadening\nof the localized Wannier functions used for calculating the parameters to\ndescribe ultracold atoms in optical lattices. For this, we replace the common\nsingle-particle Wannier functions, which do not contain any information about\nthe interactions, by two-particle Wannier functions (\"Twonniers\") obtained from\nan exact solution which takes the interactions into account. We then use these\ninteraction-dependent basis functions to calculate the Bose--Hubbard model\nparameters, showing that they are substantially different both at low and high\nlattice depths, from the ones calculated using single-particle Wannier\nfunctions. Our results suggest that density effects are not negligible for many\nparameter ranges and need to be taken into account in metrology experiments.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of dark matter decay assuming that it is\ninduced by non-minimal coupling to gravity, when the dark matter mass is in the\nsub-GeV range, i.e. below the QCD confinement scale. We show that the decay of\nthe singlet scalar dark matter candidate produces sharp features in the photon\nspectrum, in the form of lines, boxes, and also in the form of a novel spectral\nfeature, characterized by the decay into $e^+e^- \\gamma$ through a contact\ninteraction, with decay branching fractions depending only on a single\nparameter, namely the dark matter mass. We also derive upper limits on the\nstrength of the gravity portal from the non-observation of sharp features in\nthe isotropic diffuse gamma-ray spectra measured by COMPTEL, EGRET and\nFermi-LAT, and the X-ray spectrum measured by INTEGRAL. Finally, we briefly\ncomment on the impact of dark matter decay via non-minimal coupling to gravity\non the reionization history of the Universe.\n", "  We study the most luminous known supernova (SN) associated with a gamma-ray\nburst (GRB), SN 2011kl. The photospheric velocity of SN 2011kl around peak\nbrightness is $21,000\\pm7,000$ km s$^{-1}$. Owing to different assumptions\nrelated to the light-curve (LC) evolution (broken or unbroken power-law\nfunction) of the optical afterglow of GRB 111209A, different techniques for the\nLC decomposition, and different methods (with or without a near-infrared\ncontribution), three groups derived three different bolometric LCs for SN\n2011kl. Previous studies have shown that the LCs without an early-time excess\npreferred a magnetar model, a magnetar+$^{56}$Ni model, or a white dwarf tidal\ndisruption event model rather than the radioactive heating model. On the other\nhand, the LC shows an early-time excess and dip that cannot be reproduced by\nthe aforementioned models, and hence the blue-supergiant model was proposed to\nexplain it. Here we reinvestigate the energy sources powering SN 2011kl. We\nfind that the two LCs without the early-time excess of SN 2011kl can be\nexplained by the magnetar+$^{56}$Ni model, and the LC showing the early excess\ncan be explained by the magnetar+$^{56}$Ni model taking into account the\ncooling emission from the shock-heated envelope of the SN progenitor,\ndemonstrating that this SN might primarily be powered by a nascent magnetar.\n", "  We present a principal component analysis method which tracks and compensates\nfor short-timescale variability in pulsar profiles, with a goal of improving\npulsar timing precision. We couple this with a fast likelihood technique for\ndetermining pulse time of arrival, marginalizing over the principal component\namplitudes. This allows accurate estimation of timing errors in the presence of\npulsar variability.\n  We apply the algorithm to the slow pulsar PSR J2139+0040 using an archived\nset of untargeted raster-scan observations at arbitrary epochs across four\nyears, obtaining an improved timing solution. The method permits accurate\npulsar timing in data sets with short contiguous on-source observations,\nopening opportunities for commensality between pulsar timing and mapping\nsurveys.\n", "  The success of LISA Pathfinder in demonstrating the LISA drag-free\nrequirement paved the road of using space missions for detecting low-frequency\nand middle-frequency GWs. The new LISA GW mission proposes to use arm length of\n2.5 Gm (1 Gm = 106 km). The TAIJI GW mission proposes to use arm length of 3\nGm. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity, laser frequency noise must be\nsuppressed to below the secondary noises such as the optical path noise,\nacceleration noise etc. In previous papers, we have performed the numerical\nsimulation of the time delay interferometry (TDI) for original LISA, ASTROD-GW\nand eLISA together with a LISA-type mission with a nominal arm length of 2 Gm\nusing the CGC 2.7/CGC2.7.1 ephemeris framework. In this paper, we follow the\nsame procedure to simulate the time delay interferometry numerically for the\nnew LISA mission and the TAIJI mission together with LISA-like missions of arm\nlength 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 Gm. The resulting optical path differences of the\nsecond-generation TDI calculated for new LISA, TAIJI, and LISA-like missions or\narm length 1, 2, 4, 5 & 6 Gm are well below their respective limits which the\nlaser frequency noise is required to be suppressed. However, for of the first\ngeneration X, Y, and Z TDI configurations, the original requirements need to be\nrelaxed by 3 to 30 fold to be satisfied. For the new LISA and TAIJI, about one\norder of magnitude relaxation would be good and recommended; this could be\nborne on the laser stability requirement in view of recent progress in laser\nstability. Compared with X, Y and Z, the X+Y+Z configuration does have a good\ncancellation of path length differences and could serve as a null string\ndetection check. We compile and compare the resulting differences of various\nTDI configurations due to the different arm lengths for various LISA-like\nmission proposals and for the ASTROD-GW mission proposal.\n", "  We introduce a new family of quantum circuits in Continuous Variables and we\nshow that, relying on the widely accepted conjecture that the polynomial\nhierarchy of complexity classes does not collapse, their output probability\ndistribution cannot be efficiently simulated by a classical computer. These\ncircuits are composed of input photon-subtracted (or photon-added) squeezed\nstates, passive linear optics evolution, and eight-port homodyne detection. We\naddress the proof of hardness for the exact probability distribution of these\nquantum circuits by exploiting mappings onto different architectures of\nsub-universal quantum computers. We obtain both a worst-case and an\naverage-case hardness result. Hardness of Boson Sampling with eight-port\nhomodyne detection is obtained as the zero squeezing limit of our model. We\nconclude with a discussion on the relevance and interest of the present model\nin connection to experimental applications and classical simulations.\n", "  An implementation of the Polynomial Chaos Expansion is introduced here as a\nfast solver of the equations of beam and spin motion inside an RF Wien filter.\nThe device shall be used to search for the deuteron electric dipole moment in\nthe COSY storage ring. The new approach is based on the stochastic Galerkin\nmethod, and it is shown that this constitutes a new and very powerful\nalternative to the commonly used Monte-Carlo methods.\n", "  Simple joint measurements of pairs of observables reveal that states\nconsidered universally as classical-like, such as SU(2) spin coherent states,\nGlauber coherent states, and thermal states are actually nonclassical. We show\nthat this holds because we can find a joint measurement the statistics of which\nis not separable. Eventually this may be extended to all states different from\nthe maximally mixed state.\n", "  Recently, two reports have demonstrated the amazing possibility to probe\nvibrational excitations from nanoparticles with a spatial resolution much\nsmaller than the corresponding free-space phonon wavelength using electron\nenergy loss spectroscopy (EELS). While Lagos et al. evidenced a strong spatial\nand spectral modulation of the EELS signal over a nanoparticle, Krivanek et al.\ndid not. Here, we show that discrepancies among different EELS experiments as\nwell as their relation to optical near- and far-field optical experiments can\nbe understood by introducing the concept of confined bright and dark\nFuchs-Kliewer modes, whose density of states is probed by EELS. Such a concise\nformalism is the vibrational counterpart of the broadly used formalism for\nlocalized surface plasmons; it makes it straightforward to predict or interpret\nphenomena already known for localized surface plasmons such as\nenvironment-related energy shifts or the possibility of 3D mapping of the\nrelated surface charge densities.\n", "  Metal abundance and its evolution are studied for Mg II quasar absorption\nline systems from their weak, unsaturated spectral lines using stacked spectra\nfrom the archived data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey. They show an abundance\npattern that resembles that of Galactic halo or Small Magellanic Cloud, with\nmetallicity [Z/H] showing an evolution from redshift z=2 to 0.5: metallicity\nbecomes approximately solar or even larger at z~0. We show that the evolution\nof the metal abundance traces the cumulative amount of the hydrogen fuel\nconsumed in star formation in galaxies. With the aid of a spectroscopic\nsimulation code, we infer the median gas density of the cloud to be roughly 0.3\n$\\rm cm^{-3}$, with which the elemental abundance in various ionization stages,\nin particular C I, is consistently explained. This gas density implies that the\nsize of the Mg II clouds is of the order of 0.03 kpc, which suggests that\nindividual Mg II clouds around a galaxy are of a baryonic mass typically $\\rm\n10^{3} \\, M_{\\odot}$. This means that Mg II clouds are numerous and `foamy',\nrather than the large entity that covers a sizable fraction of galaxies with a\nsingle cloud.\n", "  We use paramagnetic Faraday rotation to study spin noise spectrum from\nunpolarized Rb vapor in a tightly focused probe beam in the presence of N$_2$\nbuffer gas. We derive an analytical form for the diffusion component of the\nspin noise time-correlation function in a Gaussian probe beam. We also obtain\nanalytical forms for the frequency spectrum of the spin noise in the limit of a\ntightly focused or a collimated Gaussian beam in the presence of diffusion. In\nparticular, we find that in a tightly focused probe beam the spectral lineshape\ncan be independent of the buffer gas pressure. Experimentally, we find good\nagreement between the calculated and measured spin noise spectra for N$_2$ gas\npressures ranging from 56 to 820 torr.\n", "  This paper defines the UK Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT) Hemisphere Survey (UHS)\nand release of the remaining ~12,700 sq.deg of J-band survey data products. The\nUHS will provide continuous J and K-band coverage in the northern hemisphere\nfrom a declination of 0 deg to 60 deg by combining the existing Large Area\nSurvey, Galactic Plane Survey and Galactic Clusters Survey conducted under the\nUKIRT Infra-red Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) programme with this new additional\narea not covered by UKIDSS. The released data includes J-band imaging and\nsource catalogues over the new area, which, together with UKIDSS, completes the\nJ-band UHS coverage over the full ~17,900 sq.deg area. 98 per cent of the data\nin this release have passed quality control criteria, the remaining 2 per cent\nbeing scheduled for re-observation. The median 5-sigma point source sensitivity\nof the released data is 19.6 mag (Vega). The median full width at half-maximum\nof the point spread function across the dataset is 0.75 arcsec. In this paper,\nwe outline the survey management, data acquisition, processing and calibration,\nquality control and archiving as well as summarising the characteristics of the\nreleased data products. The data are initially available to a limited\nconsortium with a world-wide release scheduled for August 2018.\n", "  Precise atmospheric observations have been made for a growing sample of warm\nNeptunes. Here we investigate the correlations between these observations and a\nlarge number of system parameters to show that, at 95% confidence, the\namplitude of a warm Neptune's spectral features in transmission correlates with\neither its equilibrium temperature (T_eq) or its bulk H/He mass fraction\n(f_HHe) --- in addition to the standard kT/mg scaling. These correlations could\nindicate either more optically-thick, photochemically-produced hazes at lower\nT_eq and/or higher-metallicity atmospheres for planets with smaller radii and\nlower f_HHe. %Since hazes must exist in some of these planets, we favor the\nformer explanation. We derive an analytic relation to estimate the observing\ntime needed with JWST/NIRISS to confidently distinguish a nominal gas giant's\ntransmission spectrum from a flat line. Using this tool, we show that these\npossible atmospheric trends could reduce the number of expected TESS planets\naccessible to JWST spectroscopy by up to a factor of eight. Additional\nobservations of a larger sample of planets are required to confirm these trends\nin atmospheric properties as a function of planet or system quantities. If\nthese trends can be confidently identified, the community will be\nwell-positioned to prioritize new targets for atmospheric study and eventually\nbreak the complex degeneracies between atmospheric chemistry, composition, and\ncloud properties.\n", "  Testing Lorentz invariance is essential as it is one of the pillars of modern\nphysics. Moreover, its violation is foreseen in several popular Quantum Gravity\nmodels. Several authors study the effects of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV)\nin the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. These particles are the\nmost energetic events ever detected and therefore represent a promising\nframework to test LIV. In this work we present an analytic calculation of the\nin-elasticity for any $a+b \\rightarrow c+d$ interaction using first order\nperturbation in the dispersion relation that violates Lorentz invariance. The\ninelasticity can be calculated by solving a third-order polynomial equation\ncontaining: a) the kinematics of the interaction, b) the LIV term for each\nparticle and c) the geometry of the interaction. We use the inelasticity we\ncalculate to investigate the proton propagation in the intergalactic media. The\nphotopion production of the proton interaction with the CMB is taken into\naccount using the inelasticity and the attenuation length in different LIV\nscenarios. We show how the allowed phase space for the photopion production\nchanges when LIV is considered for the interaction. The calculations presented\nhere are going to be extended in order to calculated the modified ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays spectrum and compare it to the data.\n", "  In this letter, we address the chiral properties of valley exciton-polaritons\nin a monolayer of WS2 in the regime of strong light-matter coupling with a\nTamm-Plasmon resonance. We observe that the valley polarization, which\nmanifests in the circular polarization of the emitted photoluminescence, is\nstrongly enhanced in comparison to bare WS2 monolayers, and can even be\nobserved under non-resonant excitation at ambient conditions. We study the\nrelaxation and decay dynamics of exciton-polaritons in our device, and present\na microscopic model to explain the wave vector-dependent valley depolarization\nas an interplay of bright and dark states, electron-hole exchange interaction\nand the linear polarization splitting inherent to the microcavity.\n", "  A key objective of the ESA Gaia satellite is the realization of a\nquasi-inertial reference frame at visual wavelengths by means of global\nastrometric techniques. This requires an accurate mathematical and numerical\nmodeling of relativistic light propagation, as well as double-blind-like\nprocedures for the internal validation of the results, before they are released\nto the scientific community at large. Aim of this work is to specialize the\nTime Transfer Functions (TTF) formalism to the case of the Gaia observer and\nprove its applicability to the task of Global Sphere Reconstruction (GSR), in\nanticipation of its inclusion in the GSR system, already featuring the suite of\nRAMOD models, as an additional semi-external validation of the forthcoming Gaia\nbaseline astrometric solutions. We extend the current GSR framework and\nsoftware infrastructure (GSR2) to include TTF relativistic observation\nequations compatible with Gaia's operations. We use simulated data generated by\nthe Gaia Data Reduction and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) to obtain different\nleast-squares estimations of the full stellar spheres and gauge results. These\nare compared to analogous solutions obtained with the current RAMOD model in\nGSR2 and to the catalog generated with GREM, the model baselined for Gaia and\nused to generate the DPAC synthetic data. Linearized least-squares TTF\nsolutions are based on spheres of about 132,000 primary stars uniformly\ndistributed on the sky and simulated observations spanning the entire 5-yr\nrange of Gaia's nominal operational lifetime. The statistical properties of the\nresults compare well with those of GREM. Finally, comparisons to RAMOD@GSR2\nsolutions confirmed the known lower accuracy of that model and allowed us to\nestablish firm limits on the quality of the linearization point outside of\nwhich an iteration for non-linearity is required for its proper convergence.\n", "  The fractional quantum Hall effect is the paradigmatic example of\ntopologically ordered phases. One of its most fascinating aspects is the large\nvariety of different topological orders that may be realized, in particular\nnonabelian ones. Here we analyze a class of nonabelian fractional quantum Hall\nmodel states which are generalizations of the abelian Haldane-Halperin\nhierarchy. We derive their topological properties and show that the\nquasiparticles obey nonabelian fusion rules of type su(q)_k. For a subset of\nthese states we are able to derive the conformal field theory description that\nmakes the topological properties - in particular braiding - of the state\nmanifest. The model states we study provide explicit wave functions for a large\nvariety of interesting topological orders, which may be relevant for certain\nfractional quantum Hall states observed in the first excited Landau level.\n", "  This paper continues a series in which we predict the main observable\ncharacteristics of exoplanets based on their formation. In Paper I we described\nour global planet formation and evolution model. In Paper II we studied the\nplanetary mass-radius relationship. Here we present an extensive study of the\nstatistics of planetary luminosities during both formation and evolution. Our\nresults can be compared with individual directly imaged (proto)planets as well\nas statistical results from surveys. We calculated three synthetic planet\npopulations assuming different efficiencies of the accretional heating by gas\nand planetesimals. We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary\nmass-luminosity relation. We study the shock and internal luminosity during\nformation. We predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus\nentropy \"tuning fork\" diagram. We find high nominal post-formation luminosities\nfor hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation histories can still lead\nto a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass.\nHowever, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the\npost-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot states. As a key result\nwe predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep\nincrease towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of\nlow-mass planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an\nestimate of the planet mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the gas\naccretion rate can be estimated. Due to the \"core-mass effect\" planets that\nunderwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies. Once\nthe number of directly imaged exoplanets with known ages and luminosities\nincreases, the observed distributions may be compared with our predictions.\n", "  In this work we study the stochastic resonance (SR) effect in a driven\ndissipative Jaynes-Cummings model. The SR effect is systematically studied in\nthe semiclassical and full quantum frameworks and in both cases we find that\nSRs simultaneously occur for the optical and atomic freedoms. In particular, at\nzero temperature quantum SR can be induced merely by vacuum fluctuations. The\nqualitative features of semiclassical SR and quantum SR are similar, but the\nparameter region of quantum SR are shifted from the semiclassical region due to\nthe widely-used factorization in obtaining semiclassical equations of motion.\nOur results provide a theoretical basis for experimentally observing and\nstudying the SR phenomenon of the Jaynes-Cummings model in the quantum regime.\n", "  We study the small frequency behavior of the bulk viscosity spectral function\nusing stochastic fluid dynamics. We obtain a number of model independent\nresults, including the long-time tail of the bulk stress correlation function,\nand the leading non-analyticity of the spectral function at small frequency. We\nalso establish a lower bound on the bulk viscosity which is weakly dependent on\nassumptions regarding the range of applicability of fluid dynamics. The bound\non the bulk viscosity $\\zeta$ scales as $\\zeta_{\\it min} \\sim\n(P-\\frac{2}{3}{\\cal E})^2 \\sum_i D_i^{-2}$, where $D_i$ are the diffusion\nconstants for energy and momentum, and $P-\\frac{2}{3}{\\cal E}$, where $P$ is\nthe pressure and ${\\cal E}$ is the energy density, is a measure of scale\nbreaking. Applied to the cold Fermi gas near unitarity, $|\\lambda/a_s|\\geq 1$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the thermal de Broglie wave length and $a_s$ is the $s$-wave\nscattering length, this bound implies that the ratio of bulk viscosity to\nentropy density satisfies $\\zeta/s \\geq 0.1\\hbar/k_B$. Here, $\\hbar$ is\nPlanck's constant and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant.\n", "  We study the effective field theory (EFT) description of the virtual particle\neffects in quasi-single field inflation, which unifies the previous results on\nlarge mass and large mixing cases. By using a horizon crossing approximation\nand matching with known limits, approximate expressions for the power spectrum\nand the spectral index are obtained. The error of the approximate solution is\nwithin 10% in dominate parts of the parameter space, which corresponds to\nless-than-0.1% error in the $n_s$-$r$ diagram. The quasi-single field\ncorrections on the $n_s$-$r$ diagram are plotted for a few inflation models.\nEspecially, the quasi-single field correction drives $m^2\\phi^2$ inflation to\nthe best fit region on the $n_s$-$r$ diagram, with an amount of equilateral\nnon-Gaussianity which can be tested in future experiments.\n", "  We consider the problem of singular beams in optics as a part of the general\nquestions of interactions, shaping and transformations of vortex states with\nfractional topological charges in physics, in particular, in hydrodynamic and\nquantum mechanic. Starting from the representation of the fractional-order\nvortex states as a superposition of infinite number of integer-order vortices\nwith distinctive energy distributions (the vortex spectra) we showed that the\nsmooth wave front of the fractional vortex beam can either decay into an\nasymmetric array of integer-order vortices or, vice versa, the array of optical\nvortices can be gathered together forming a smooth wave front with a\nhelicoid-shaped phase distribution under propagation in free space. We revealed\nthat a simple superposition of a finite number of the fractional-order vortex\nbeams enables us to shape symmetric singular beams with the integer-order\nvortices of the desired topological charges.\n", "  We study the entropy production of a system with a finite number of states\nconnected by random transition rates. The stationary entropy production, driven\nout of equilibrium both by asymmetric transition rates and by an external\nprobability current, is shown to be composed of two contributions whose exact\ndistributions are calculated in the large system size and close to equilibrium.\nThe first contribution is related to Joule's law for the heat dissipated in a\nclassical electrical circuit whereas the second one has a Gaussian distribution\nwith an extensive average and a finite variance.\n", "  The mass function of galaxy clusters is a sensitive tracer of the\ngravitational evolution of the cosmic large-scale structure and serves as an\nimportant census of the fraction of matter bound in large structures. We obtain\nthe mass function by fitting the observed cluster X-ray luminosity distribution\nfrom the REFLEX galaxy cluster survey to models of cosmological structure\nformation. We marginalise over uncertainties in the cosmological parameters as\nwell as those of the relevant galaxy cluster scaling relations. The mass\nfunction is determined with an uncertainty less than 10% in the mass range 3 x\n10^12 to 5 x 10^14 M$_\\odot$. For the cumulative mass function we find a slope\nat the low mass end consistent with a value of -1, while the mass rich end\ncut-off is milder than a Schechter function with an exponential term exp($-\nM^\\delta$) with $\\delta$ smaller than 1. Changing the Hubble parameter in the\nrange $H_0 = 67 - 73 km s^-1 Mpc^{-1}$ or allowing the total neutrino mass to\nhave a value between 0 - 0.4 eV causes variations less than the uncertainties.\nWe estimate the fraction of mass locked up in galaxy clusters: about 4.4% of\nthe matter in the Universe is bound in clusters (inside $r_200$) with a mass\nlarger than 10^14 M$_\\odot$ and 14% to clusters and groups with a mass larger\nthan 10^13 M$_\\odot$ at the present Universe. We also discuss the evolution of\nthe galaxy cluster population with redshift. Our results imply that there is\nhardly any clusters with a mass > 10^15 M$_\\odot$ above a redshift of z = 1.\n", "  We explore the Floquet band-structure and electronic transport in\nlaser-illuminated bilayer graphene. By using a bias voltage perpendicular to\nthe graphene bilayer we show how to get one-way charge and valley transport\namong two unbiased leads. In contrast to quantum pumping, our proposal uses a\ndifferent mechanism based on generating a non-reciprocal bandstructure with a\nbuilt-in directionality. The Floquet states at one edge of a graphene layer\nbecome hybridized with the continuum on the other layer, and so the resulting\nbandstructure allows for one-way transport as in an \\textit{isolator}. Our\nproof-of-concept may serve as a building block for devices exploiting one-way\nstates.\n", "  In a previous paper (Kato 2017a) we have examined how the self-trapping of\ng-mode oscillations in geometrically thin relativistic disks is affected by the\npresence of uniform vertical magnetic fields. Disks considered are isothermal\nin the vertical direction and are truncated at a certain height by presence of\nhot corona. After a correction of simple analytical error, we showed (Kato\n2017b) that the self-trapping of axisymmetric g-mode oscillations in\nnon-magnetized disks is destroyed by weak magnetic fields as Fu and Lai (2009)\nshowed. In this paper, however, we re-examine the same problem by imposing a\ndifferent more relevant boundary condition on the disk-corona surface and find\nthat the self-trapping of axisymmetric g-mode oscillations seems to still exist\nlike the case of non-magnetized disks.\n", "  Ecosystems display a complex spatial organization. Ecologists have long tried\nto characterize them by looking at how different measures of biodiversity\nchange across spatial scales. Ecological neutral theory has provided simple\npredictions accounting for general empirical patterns in communities of\ncompeting species. However, while neutral theory in well-mixed ecosystems is\nmathematically well understood, spatial models still present several open\nproblems, limiting the quantitative understanding of spatial biodiversity. In\nthis review, we discuss the state of the art in spatial neutral theory. We\nemphasize the connection between spatial ecological models and the physics of\nnon-equilibrium phase transitions and how concepts developed in statistical\nphysics translate in population dynamics, and vice versa. We focus on\nnon-trivial scaling laws arising at the critical dimension D = 2 of spatial\nneutral models, and their relevance for biological populations inhabiting\ntwo-dimensional environments. We conclude by discussing models incorporating\nnon-neutral effects in the form of spatial and temporal disorder, and analyze\nhow their predictions deviate from those of purely neutral theories.\n", "  Combustion stabilization and enhancement of the flammability limits are\nmandatory objectives to improve nowadays combustion chambers. At this purpose,\nthe use of an electric field in the flame region provides a solution which is,\nat the same time, easy to implement and effective to modify the flame\nstructure. The present work describes an efficient flamelet progress-variable\napproach developed to model the fluid dynamics of flames immersed in an\nelectric field. The main feature of this model is that it can use complex\nionization mechanisms without increasing the computational cost of the\nsimulation. The model is based on the assumption that the combustion process is\nnot directly influenced by the electric field and has been tested using two\nchemi-ionization mechanisms of different complexity in order to examine its\nbehavior with and without the presence of heavy anions in the mixture. Using a\none- and two-dimensional numerical test cases, the present approach has been\nable to reproduce all the major aspects encountered when a flame is subject to\nan imposed electric field and the main effects of the different chemical\nmechanisms. Moreover, the proposed model is shown to produce a large reduction\nin the computational cost, being able to shorten the time needed to perform a\nsimulation up to 40 times.\n", "  Dark matter subhalos are the remnants of (incomplete) halo mergers.\nIdentifying them and establishing their evolutionary links in the form of\nmerger trees is one of the most important applications of cosmological\nsimulations. The Hierachical Bound-Tracing (HBT) code identifies halos as they\nform and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting\nsubhalos and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation\nof this approach, HBT+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more\nphysically complete than the original code. Applying HBT+ to cosmological\nsimulations we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass\nfunction are well fit by similar double-Schechter functions.The ratio between\nthe two is highest at the high mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive\nsubhalos that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal\nstripping. The radial distribution of the most massive subhalos is more\nconcentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhalos.\nSubhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the\nmasses of massive subhalos, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This\nmay explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhalos in galaxy cluster\ncentres inferred from recent lensing observations. We demonstrate that the\npeak-mass function is a powerful diagnostic of merger tree defects, and the\nmerger trees constructed using HBT+ do not suffer from the missing or switched\nlinks that tend to afflict merger trees constructed from more conventional halo\nfinders. We make the HBT+ code publicly available.\n", "  The Bayesian data analysis framework has been proven to be a systematic and\neffective method of parameter inference and model selection for stochastic\nprocesses. In this work we introduce an information content model check which\nmay serve as a goodness-of-fit, like the chi-square procedure, to complement\nconventional Bayesian analysis. We demonstrate this extended Bayesian framework\non a system of Langevin equations, where coordinate dependent mobilities and\nmeasurement noise hinder the normal mean squared displacement approach.\n", "  Deep optical imaging is used to study time-domain properties of young brown\ndwarfs in sigma Orionis over typical rotational time-scales and to search for\nnew substellar and planetary-mass cluster members. We used VIMOS at the VLT to\nmonitor a 24 arcmin x 16 arcmin field in the I-band. Using the individual\nimages from this run we investigated the photometric time series of nine\nsubstellar cluster members with masses from 10 to 60 Mj. The deep stacked image\nshows cluster members down to $\\approx$ 5 Mj. We search for new planetary mass\nobjects by combining our deep I-band photometry with public J-band magnitudes\nand by examining the nearby environment of known very low mass members for\npossible companions. We find two brown dwarfs, with significantly variable,\naperiodic light curves, both with masses around 50 Mj, one of which was\npreviously unknown to be variable. The physical mechanism responsible for the\nobserved variability is likely different for the two objects. The variability\nof the first object, a single-lined spectroscopic binary, is most likely linked\nto its accretion disc, the second may be caused by variable extinction by large\ngrains. We find five new candidate members from the colour-magnitude diagram\nand three from a search for companions within 2000 au. We rule all eight\nsources out as potential members based on non-stellar shape and/or infrared\ncolours. The I-band photometry is made available as a public dataset. We\npresent two variable brown dwarfs. One is consistent with ongoing accretion,\nthe other, exhibiting apparent transient variability without presence of an\naccretion disc. Our analysis confirms the existing census of substellar cluster\nmembers down to $\\approx$ 7 Mj. The zero result from our companion search\nagrees with the low occurrence rate of wide companions to brown dwarfs found in\nother works.\n", "  Context. In the context of an in-depth understanding of GRBs and their\npossible use in cosmology, some important correlations between the parameters\nthat describe their emission have been discovered, among which the \"Ep,i-Eiso\"\ncorrelation is the most studied. Because of this, it is fundamental to shed\nlight on the peculiar behaviour of a few events, namely GRB 980425 and GRB\n031203, that appear to be important outliers of the Ep,i-Eiso correlation.\nAims. In this paper we investigate if the locations of GRB 980425 and GRB\n031203, the two (apparent) outliers of the correlation, may be due to an\nobservational bias caused by the lacking detection of the soft X-ray emissions\nassociated with these GRBs, from respectively the BATSE detector on-board the\nCompton Gamma-Ray Observer and INTEGRAL, that were operating at the epoch of\nthe observations. We analyse the observed emission of other similar\nsub-energetic bursts (GRBs 060218, 100316D and 161219B) observed by Swift and\nwhose integrated emissions match the Ep,i-Eiso relation. We simulate their\nintegrated and time-resolved emissions as would have been observed by the same\ndetectors that observed GRB 980425 and GRB 031203, aimed at reconstructing the\nlight curve and spectra of these bursts. Results. If observed by old generation\ninstruments, GRB 060218, 100316D and 161219B would appear as outliers of the\nEp,i-Eiso relation, while if observed with Swift or WFM GRB 060218 would\nperfectly match the correlation. We also note that the instrument BAT alone\n(15-150 keV) actually measured 060218 as an outlier. Conclusions. We suggest\nthat if GRB 980425 and GRB 031203 would have been observed by Swift and by eXTP\nthey may have matched the Ep,i-Eiso relation. This provides strong support to\nthe idea that instrumental biases can make some events in the lower-left corner\nof the Ep,i-Eiso plane appearing as outliers of the \"Amati relation\".\n", "  Monitoring a quantum observable continuously in time produces a stochastic\nmeasurement record that noisily tracks the observable. For a classical process\nsuch noise may be reduced to recover an average signal by minimizing the mean\nsquared error between the noisy record and a smooth dynamical estimate. We show\nthat for a monitored qubit this usual procedure returns unusual results. While\nthe record seems centered on the expectation value of the observable during\ncausal generation, examining the collected past record reveals that it better\napproximates a moving-mean Gaussian stochastic process centered at a distinct\n(smoothed) observable estimate. We show that this shifted mean converges to the\nreal part of a generalized weak value in the time-continuous limit without\nadditional postselection. We verify that this smoothed estimate minimizes the\nmean squared error even for individual measurement realizations. We go on to\nshow that if a second observable is weakly monitored concurrently, then that\nsecond record is consistent with the smoothed estimate of the second observable\nbased solely on the information contained in the first observable record.\nMoreover, we show that such a smoothed estimate made from incomplete\ninformation can still outperform estimates made using full knowledge of the\ncausal quantum state.\n", "  We study the mass spectra and radiative decays of doubly heavy baryons within\nthe diquark picture in a relativized quark model. The mass of the $J^P=1/2^+$\n$\\Xi_{cc}$ ground state is predicted to be 3606 MeV, which is consistent with\nthe mass of $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}(3621)$ newly observed by the LHCb collaboration. The\npredicted mass gap between two $S$ wave states, $\\Xi_{cc}^*$ ($J^P=3/2^+$) and\n$\\Xi_{cc}$ ($J^P=1/2^+$), is 69 MeV. Furthermore, the radiative transitions of\ndoubly heavy baryons are also estimated by using the realistic wave functions\nobtained from relativized quark model. The radiative decay widths of\n$\\Xi_{cc}^{*++} \\to \\Xi_{cc}^{++}\\gamma$ and $\\Xi_{cc}^{*+} \\to\n\\Xi_{cc}^+\\gamma$ are predicted to be about 7 and 4 keV, respectively. These\npredictions of doubly heavy baryons can provide helpful information for future\nexperimental searches.\n", "  Galaxy metallicity scaling relations provide a powerful tool for\nunderstanding galaxy evolution, but obtaining unbiased global galaxy gas-phase\noxygen abundances requires proper treatment of the various line-emitting\nsources within spectroscopic apertures. We present a model framework that\ntreats galaxies as ensembles of HII and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) regions of\nvarying metallicities. These models are based upon empirical relations between\nline ratios and electron temperature for HII regions, and DIG strong-line ratio\nrelations from SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU data. Flux-weighting effects and DIG\ncontamination can significantly affect properties inferred from global galaxy\nspectra, biasing metallicity estimates by more than 0.3 dex in some cases. We\nuse observationally-motivated inputs to construct a model matched to typical\nlocal star-forming galaxies, and quantify the biases in strong-line ratios,\nelectron temperatures, and direct-method metallicities as inferred from global\ngalaxy spectra relative to the median values of the HII region distributions in\neach galaxy. We also provide a generalized set of models that can be applied to\nindividual galaxies or galaxy samples in atypical regions of parameter space.\nWe use these models to correct for the effects of flux-weighting and DIG\ncontamination in the local direct-method mass-metallicity and fundamental\nmetallicity relations, and in the mass-metallicity relation based on\nstrong-line metallicities. Future photoionization models of galaxy line\nemission need to include DIG emission and represent galaxies as ensembles of\nemitting regions with varying metallicity, instead of as single HII regions\nwith effective properties, in order to obtain unbiased estimates of key\nunderlying physical properties.\n", "  In the colliding-wind region of massive binaries, non-thermal radio emission\noccurs. This non-thermal radio emission (due to synchrotron radiation) has so\nfar been observed at centimetre wavelengths. At millimetre wavelengths, the\nstellar winds and the colliding-wind region emit more thermal free-free\nradiation, and it is expected that any non-thermal contribution will be\ndifficult or impossible to detect. We aim to determine if the material in the\ncolliding-wind region contributes substantially to the observed millimetre\nfluxes of a colliding-wind binary. We also try to distinguish the synchrotron\nemission from the free-free emission. We monitored the massive binary Cyg OB2\n#8A at 3 mm with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer\nof the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM). The data were\ncollected in 14 separate observing runs (in 2014 and 2016), and provide good\ncoverage of the orbital period. The observed millimetre fluxes range between\n1.1 and 2.3 mJy, and show phase-locked variability, clearly indicating that a\nlarge part of the emission is due to the colliding-wind region. A simple\nsynchrotron model gives fluxes with the correct order of magnitude, but with a\nmaximum that is phase-shifted with respect to the observations. Qualitatively\nthis phase shift can be explained by our neglect of orbital motion on the shape\nof the colliding-wind region. A model using only free-free emission results in\nonly a slightly worse explanation of the observations. Additionally, on the map\nof our observations we also detect the O6.5 III star Cyg OB2 #8B, for which we\ndetermine a 3 mm flux of 0.21 +- 0.033 mJy. The question of whether synchrotron\nradiation or free-free emission dominates the millimetre fluxes of Cyg OB2 #8A\nremains open. More detailed modelling of this system, based on solving the\nhydrodynamical equations, is required to give a definite answer.\n", "  We constrain the history of reionization using the data from Planck 2015\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy\nobservations. We also use prior constraints on the reionization history at\nredshifts $\\sim7-8$ obtained from Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission observations. Using\nthe free electron fractions at different redshifts as free parameters, we\nconstruct the complete reionization history using polynomials. Our construction\nprovides an extremely flexible framework to search for the history of\nreionization as a function of redshifts. We present a conservative and an\noptimistic constraint on reionization that are categorized by the flexibilities\nof the models and datasets used to constrain them, and we report that CMB data\nmarginally favors extended reionization histories. In both the cases, we find\nthe mean values of optical depth to be larger ($\\approx0.09$ and $0.1$) than\nwhat we find in standard steplike reionization histories ($0.079\\pm0.017$). At\nthe same time we also find that the maximum free electron fraction allowed by\nthe data for redshifts more than 15 is $\\sim0.25$ at 95.4\\% confidence limit in\nthe case of optimistic constraint.\n", "  We use an elliptic system of equations with complex coefficients for a set of\ncomplex-valued tensor fields as a tool to construct infinite-dimensional\nfamilies of non-singular stationary black holes, real-valued Lorentzian\nsolutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-scalar\nfields-Yang-Mills-Higgs-Chern-Simons-$f(R)$ equations with a negative\ncosmological constant. The families include an infinite-dimensional family of\nsolutions with the usual AdS conformal structure at conformal infinity.\n", "  We present bolometric fluxes and angular diameters for over 1.6 million stars\nin the {\\it Tycho-2} catalog, determined using previously-determined empirical\ncolor-temperature and color-flux relations. We vet these relations via full\nfits to the full broadband spectral energy distributions for a subset of\nbenchmark stars, and perform quality checks against the large set of stars for\nwhich spectroscopically-determined parameters are available from LAMOST, RAVE,\nand/or APOGEE. We then estimate radii for the 355,502 {\\it Tycho-2} stars in\nour sample whose \\emph{Gaia} DR1 parallaxes are precise to $\\lesssim$10\\%. For\nthe 64,960 of these stars with external spectroscopic information, we achieve\nmedian uncertainties on the effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, angular\ndiameters, and radii of $1.0\\%$, $1.4\\%$, $2.4\\%$, and $7.5\\%$, respectively.\nFor the 290,542 remaining stars, we achieve median uncertainties of $0.9\\%$,\n$1.3\\%$, $2.2\\%$, and $7.5\\%$, respectively. These stellar parameters are shown\nto be reliable for stars with $T_{\\rm eff}\\lesssim$7000~K. The over half a\nmillion bolometric fluxes and angular diameters presented here will serve as an\nimmediate trove of empirical stellar radii with the {\\it Gaia\\/} second data\nrelease, at which point effective temperature uncertainties will dominate the\nradius uncertainties. Already, dwarf, subgiant, and giant populations are\nreadily identifiable in our purely empirical luminosity-effective temperature\n(theoretical) Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams.\n", "  We consider the design and modeling of metasurfaces that couple energy from\nguided waves to propagating wavefronts. This is a first step towards a\ncomprehensive, multiscale modeling platform for metasurface antennas-large\narrays of metamaterial elements embedded in a waveguide structure that radiates\ninto free-space--in which the detailed electromagnetic responses of\nmetamaterial elements are replaced by polarizable dipoles. We present two\nmethods to extract the effective polarizability of a metamaterial element\nembedded in a one- or two-dimensional waveguide. The first method invokes\nsurface equivalence principles, averaging over the effective surface currents\nand charges within an element to obtain the effective dipole moments; the\nsecond method is based on computing the coefficients of the scattered waves\nwithin the waveguide, from which the effective polarizability can be inferred.\nWe demonstrate these methods on several variants of waveguide-fed metasurface\nelements, finding excellent agreement between the two, as well as with\nanalytical expressions derived for irises with simpler geometries. Extending\nthe polarizability extraction technique to higher order multipoles, we confirm\nthe validity of the dipole approximation for common metamaterial elements. With\nthe effective polarizabilities of the metamaterial elements accurately\ndetermined, the radiated fields generated by a metasurface antenna (inside and\noutside the antenna) can be found self-consistently by including the\ninteractions between polarizable dipoles. The dipole description provides an\nalternative language and computational framework for engineering metasurface\nantennas, holograms, lenses, beam-forming arrays, and other electrically large,\nwaveguide-fed metasurface structures.\n", "  Given an $\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory, we reconsider the Schur\nindex $\\mathcal{I}_L(q)$ in the presence of a half line defect $L$. Recently\nCordova-Gaiotto-Shao found that $\\mathcal{I}_L(q)$ admits an expansion in terms\nof characters of the chiral algebra $\\mathcal{A}$ introduced by Beem et al.,\nwith simple coefficients $v_{L,\\beta}(q)$. We report a puzzling new feature of\nthis expansion: the $q \\to 1$ limit of the coefficients $v_{L_,\\beta}(q)$ is\nlinearly related to the vacuum expectation values $\\langle L \\rangle$ in\n$U(1)_r$-invariant vacua of the theory compactified on $S^1$. This relation can\nbe expressed algebraically as a commutative diagram involving three algebras:\nthe algebra generated by line defects, the algebra of functions on\n$U(1)_r$-invariant vacua, and a Verlinde-like algebra associated to\n$\\mathcal{A}$. Our evidence is experimental, by direct computation in the\nArgyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,A_2)$, $(A_1,A_4)$, $(A_1, A_6)$, $(A_1,\nD_3)$ and $(A_1, D_5)$. In the latter two theories, which have flavor\nsymmetries, the Verlinde-like algebra which appears is a new deformation of\nalgebras previously considered.\n", "  We investigate the stability of N\\'eel skyrmions against tilted magnetic\nfields, in polar magnets with uniaxial anisotropy ranging from easy-plane to\neasy-axis type. We construct the corresponding phase diagrams and investigate\nthe internal structure of skewed skyrmions with displaced cores. We find that\nmoderate easy-plane anisotropy increases the stability range of N\\'eel\nskyrmions for fields along the symmetry axis, while moderate easy-axis\nanisotropy enhances their robustness against tilted magnetic fields. We stress\nthat the direction, along which the skyrmion cores are shifted, depends on the\nsymmetry of the underlying crystal lattice. The cores of N\\'eel skyrmions,\nrealized in polar magnets with C$_{nv}$ symmetry, are displaced either along or\nopposite to the off-axis (in-plane) component of the magnetic field depending\non the rotation sense of the magnetization, dictated by the sign of the\nDzyaloshinskii constant. The core shift of antiskyrmions, present in chiral\nmagnets with D$_{2d}$ symmetry, depends on the in-plane orientation of the\nmagnetic field and can be parallel, anti-parallel, or perpendicular to it. We\nargue that the role of anisotropy in magnets with axially symmetric crystal\nstructure is different from that in cubic helimagnets. Our results can be\napplied to address recent experiments on polar magnets with C$_{3v}$ symmetry,\nGaV$_4$S$_8$ and GaV$_4$Se$_8$.\n", "  The spectacular success of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in SN-cosmology is\nbased on the assumption that their photometric and spectroscopic properties are\ninvariant with redshift. However, this fundamental assumption needs to be\ntested with observations of high-z SNe Ia. To date, the majority of SNe Ia\nobserved at moderate to large redshifts (0.4 < z < 1.0) are faint, and the\nresultant analyses are based on observations with modest signal-to-noise ratios\nthat impart a degree of ambiguity in their determined properties. In rare cases\nhowever, the Universe offers a helping hand: to date a few SNe Ia have been\nobserved that have had their luminosities magnified by intervening galaxies and\ngalaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses. In this paper we present\nlong-slit spectroscopy of the lensed SNe Ia 2016geu, which occurred at a\nredshift of z=0.409, and was magnified by a factor of ~55 by a galaxy located\nat z=0.216. We compared our spectra, which were obtained a couple weeks to a\ncouple months past peak light, with the spectroscopic properties of\nwell-observed, nearby SNe Ia, finding that SN 2016geu's properties are\ncommensurate with those of SNe Ia in the local universe. Based primarily on the\nvelocity and strength of the Si II 6355 absorption feature, we find that SN\n2016geu can be classified as a high-velocity, high-velocity gradient and\n\"core-normal\" SN Ia. The strength of various features (measured though their\npseudo-equivalent widths) argue against SN 2016geu being a faint, broad-lined,\ncool or shallow-silicon SN Ia. We conclude that the spectroscopic properties of\nSN 2016geu imply that it is a normal SN Ia, and when taking previous results by\nother authors into consideration, there is very little, if any, evolution in\nthe observational properties of SNe Ia up to z~0.4. [Abridged]\n", "  The quantitative knowledge of heavy nuclei's partonic structure is currently\nlimited to rather large values of momentum fraction $x$ -- robust experimental\nconstraints below $x \\sim 10^{-2}$ at low resolution scale $Q^2$ are\nparticularly scarce. This is in sharp contrast to the free proton's structure\nwhich has been probed in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) measurements down to\n$x \\sim 10^{-5}$ at perturbative resolution scales. The construction of an\nElectron-Ion Collider (EIC) with a possibility to operate with a wide variety\nof nuclei, will allow one to explore the low-$x$ region in much greater detail.\nIn the present paper we simulate the extraction of the nuclear structure\nfunctions from measurements of inclusive and charm reduced cross sections at an\nEIC. The potential constraints are studied by analyzing simulated data directly\nin a next-to-leading order global fit of nuclear parton distribution functions\nbased on the recent EPPS16 analysis. A special emphasis is placed on studying\nthe impact an EIC would have on extracting the nuclear gluon PDF, the partonic\ncomponent most prone to non-linear effects at low $Q^2$. In comparison to the\ncurrent knowledge, we find that the gluon PDF can be measured at an EIC with\nsignificantly reduced uncertainties.\n", "  We spectroscopically characterize the atmosphere of HD 106906b, a young\nlow-mass companion near the deuterium burning limit. The wide separation from\nits host star of 7.1\" makes it an ideal candidate for high S/N and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy. We aim to derive new constraints on the spectral\ntype, effective temperature, and luminosity of HD106906b and also to provide a\nhigh S/N template spectrum for future characterization of extrasolar planets.\nWe obtained 1.1-2.5 $\\mu$m integral field spectroscopy with the VLT/SINFONI\ninstrument with a spectral resolution of R~2000-4000. New estimates of the\nparameters of HD 106906b are derived by analyzing spectral features, comparing\nthe extracted spectra to spectral catalogs of other low-mass objects, and\nfitting with theoretical isochrones. We identify several spectral absorption\nlines that are consistent with a low mass for HD 106906b. We derive a new\nspectral type of L1.5$\\pm$1.0, one subclass earlier than previous estimates.\nThrough comparison with other young low-mass objects, this translates to a\nluminosity of log($L/L_\\odot$)=$-3.65\\pm0.08$ and an effective temperature of\nTeff=$1820\\pm240$ K. Our new mass estimates range between $M=11.9^{+1.7}_{-0.8}\nM_{\\rm Jup}$ (hot start) and $M=14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.5} M_{\\rm Jup}$ (cold start).\nThese limits take into account a possibly finite formation time, i.e., HD\n106906b is allowed to be 0--3 Myr younger than its host star. We exclude\naccretion onto HD 106906b at rates $\\dot{M}>4.8\\times10^{-10} M_{\\rm\nJup}$yr$^{-1}$ based on the fact that we observe no hydrogen (Paschen-$\\beta$,\nBrackett-$\\gamma$) emission. This is indicative of little or no circumplanetary\ngas. With our new observations, HD 106906b is the planetary-mass object with\none of the highest S/N spectra yet. We make the spectrum available for future\ncomparison with data from existing and next-generation (e.g., ELT and JWST)\nspectrographs.\n", "  Background: The interacting boson model (IBM) has been used extensively to\ncalculate the matrix elements governing neutrinoless double-beta decay. Studies\nwithin other models indicate that a good description of neutron-proton pairing\nis essential for accurate calculations of those matrix elements. The usual\ninteracting boson model is based only on like-particle pairs, however, and the\nextent to which it captures neutron-proton pairing is not clear.\n  Purpose: To determine whether neutron-proton pairing should be explicitly\nincluded as neutron-proton bosons in IBM calculations of neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay matrix elements.\n  Method: An isospin-invariant version of the nucleon-pair shell model is\napplied to carry out shell-model calculations in a large space and in a\ncollective subspace, and to define effective operators in the latter. A\ndemocratic mapping is then used to define corresponding boson operators for the\nIBM, with and without an isoscalar neutron-proton pair boson.\n  Results: IBM calculations with and without the isoscalar boson are carried\nout for nuclei near the beginning of the $pf$ shell, with a realistic\nshell-model Hamiltonian and neutrinoless double-beta-decay operator as the\nstarting point. Energy spectra and double-beta matrix elements are compared to\nthose obtained in the underlying shell model.\n  Conclusions: The isoscalar boson does not improve energy spectra but does\nimprove double-beta matrix elements. To be useful at the level of precision we\nneed, the mapping procedure must be further developed to better determine the\ndependence of the boson Hamiltonian and decay operator on particle number and\nisospin. But the benefits provided by the isoscalar boson suggest that through\nan appropriate combination of mappings and fitting, it would make IBM matrix\nelements more accurate for the heavier nuclei used in experiments.\n", "  A separable form of the Gogny pairing force is implemented in tilted axis\ncranking covariant density functional theory for the description of rotational\nbands in open shell nuclei. The developed method is used to investigate the\nyrast sequence of 109Ag for an example. The experimental energy spectrum,\nangular momenta, and electromagnetic transition probabilities are well\nreproduced by taking into account pairing correlations with the separable\npairing force. An abrupt transition of the rotational axis from the\nlong-intermediate plane to the long-short one is obtained and discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  We investigate the properties of a sunspot light-bridge, focusing on the\nchanges produced by the impact of a plasma blob ejected from a C-class flare.\nWe observed a sunspot in active region NOAA 12544 using spectropolarimetric\nraster maps of the four Fe I lines around 15655 \\AA\\ with the GREGOR Infrared\nSpectrograph (GRIS), narrow-band intensity images sampling the Fe I 6173 \\AA\\\nline with the GREGOR Fabry-P\\'erot Interferometer (GFPI), and intensity broad\nband images in G-band and Ca II H band with the High-resolution Fast Imager\n(HiFI). All these instruments are located at the GREGOR telescope at the\nObservatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. The data cover the time before,\nduring, and after the flare event. The analysis is complemented with\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)\ndata from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The physical parameters of the\natmosphere at differents heights were inferred using spectral-line inversion\ntechniques. We identify photospheric and chromospheric brightenings, heating\nevents, and changes in the Stokes profiles associated to the flare eruption and\nthe subsequent arrival of the plasma blob to the light bridge, after traveling\nalong an active region loop. The measurements suggest that these phenomena are\nthe result of reconnection events driven by the interaction of the plasma blob\nwith the magnetic field topology of the light bridge.\n", "  We investigate three aspects of the importance of nodes with respect to\nSusceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) disease dynamics: influence maximization\n(the expected outbreak size given a set of seed nodes), the effect of\nvaccination (how much deleting nodes would reduce the expected outbreak size)\nand sentinel surveillance (how early an outbreak could be detected with sensors\nat a set of nodes). We calculate the exact expressions of these quantities, as\nfunctions of the SIR parameters, for all connected graphs of three to seven\nnodes. We obtain the smallest graphs where the optimal node sets are not\noverlapping. We find that: node separation is more important than centrality\nfor more than one active node, that vaccination and influence maximization are\nthe most different aspects of importance, and that the three aspects are more\nsimilar when the infection rate is low.\n", "  It is well known that the observables in a single-channel scattering problem\nremain invariant once the amplitude is multiplied by an overall energy- and\nangle-dependent phase. This invariance is called the continuum ambiguity and\nacts on the infinite partial wave set. It has also long been known that, in the\ncase of a truncated partial wave set, another invariance exists, originating\nfrom the replacement of the roots of partial wave amplitudes with their complex\nconjugate values. This discrete ambiguity is also known as the\nOmelaenko-Gersten-type ambiguity. In this paper, we show that for scalar\nparticles, discrete ambiguities are just a subset of continuum ambiguities with\na specific phase and thus mix partial waves, as the continuum ambiguity does.\nWe present the main features of both, continuum and discrete ambiguities, and\ndescribe a numerical method which establishes the relevant phase connection.\n", "  Context: Low-mass stars and extrasolar planets have ultra-cool atmospheres\nwhere a rich chemistry occurs and clouds form. The increasing amount of\nspectroscopic observations for extrasolar planets requires self-consistent\nmodel atmosphere simulations to consistently include the formation processes\nthat determine cloud formation and their feedback onto the atmosphere.\n  Aims: Complement the MARCS model atmosphere suit with simulations applicable\nto low-mass stars and exoplanets in preparation of E-ELT, JWST, PLATO and other\nupcoming facilities.\n  Methods: The MARCS code calculates stellar atmosphere models, providing\nself-consistent solutions of the radiative transfer and the atmospheric\nstructure and chemistry. We combine MARCS with DRIFT, a kinetic model that\ndescribes cloud formation in ultra-cool atmospheres (seed formation, growth/\nevaporation, gravitational settling, convective mixing, element depletion).\n  Results: We present a small grid of self-consistently calculated atmosphere\nmodels for $T_ \\text{eff} = 2000 - 3000$ K with solar initial abundances and\n$\\log(g) = 4.5$. Cloud formation in stellar and sub-stellar atmospheres appears\nfor $T_\\text{eff} < 2700$ K and has a significant effect on the structure and\nthe spectrum of the atmosphere for $T_\\text{eff} < 2400$ K. We have compared\nthe synthetic spectra of our models with observed spectra and found that they\nfit the spectra of mid to late type M-dwarfs and early type L-dwarfs well. We\nalso test DRIFT-MARCS for an example exoplanet and demonstrate that our\nsimulations reproduce the Spitzer observations for WASP-19b rather well for\n$T_{\\rm eff}=2600$ K, $\\log(g)=3.2$ and solar abundances. Our model points at\nan exoplanet with a deep cloud-free atmosphere with a substantial day-night\nenergy transport and no temperature inversion.\n", "  The benchmark exoplanet GJ 1214b is one of the best studied transiting\nplanets in the transition zone between rocky Earth-sized planets and gas or ice\ngiants. This class of super-Earth/mini-Neptune planets is unknown in our Solar\nSystem, yet is one of the most frequently detected classes of exoplanets.\nUnderstanding the transition from rocky to gaseous planets is a crucial step in\nthe exploration of extrasolar planetary systems, in particular with regard to\nthe potential habitability of this class of planets. GJ 1214b has already been\nstudied in detail from various platforms at many different wavelengths. Our\nairborne observations with SOFIA add information in the Paschen-alpha cont. 1.9\nmicron infrared wavelength band, which is not accessible by any other current\nground- or space-based instrument due to telluric absorption or limited\nspectral coverage. We used FLIPO and FPI+ on SOFIA to comprehensively analyse\nthe transmission signal of the possible water-world GJ 1214b through\nphotometric observations during transit in three optical and one infrared\nchannels. We present four simultaneous light curves and corresponding transit\ndepths in three optical and one infrared channel, which we compare to previous\nobservations and state-of-the-art synthetic atmospheric models of GJ 1214b. The\nfinal precision in transit depth is between 1.5 and 2.5 times the theoretical\nphoton noise limit, not sensitive enough to constrain the theoretical models\nany better than previous observations. This is the first exoplanet observation\nwith SOFIA that uses its full set of instruments available to exoplanet\nspectrophotometry. Therefore we use these results to evaluate SOFIA's potential\nin this field and suggest future improvements.\n", "  We evaluate the efficiency of axion production from spatially random initial\nconditions in the axion field, so a network of axionic strings is present. For\nthe first time, we perform numerical simulations which fully account for the\nlarge short-distance contributions to the axionic string tension, and the\nresulting dense network of high-tension axionic strings. We find nevertheless\nthat the total axion production is somewhat less efficient than in the\nangle-averaged misalignment case. Combining our results with a recent\ndetermination of the hot QCD topological susceptibility (Borsanyi et al 2016),\nwe find that if the axion makes up all of the dark matter, then the axion mass\nis m_a = 26.2 +-3.4 micro-electron volts.\n", "  We investigate the migration of a low-mass ($\\lesssim 10 M_\\oplus$) planet\nnear the inner edge of a protoplanetary disc using two-dimensional viscous\nhydrodynamics simulations. We employ an inner boundary condition representing\nthe truncation of the disc at the stellar corotation radius. As described by\nTsang (2011), wave reflection at the inner disc boundary modifies the Type I\nmigration torque on the planet, allowing migration to be halted before the\nplanet reaches the inner edge of the disc. For low-viscosity discs ($\\alpha\n\\lesssim 10^{-3}$), planets may be trapped with semi-major axes as large as\n$3-5$ times the inner disc radius. In general, planets are trapped closer to\nthe inner edge as either the planet mass or the disc viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha$ increases, and farther from the inner edge as the disc thickness is\nincreased. This planet trapping mechanism may impact the formation and\nmigration history of close-in compact multiplanet systems.\n", "  A search for a signal consistent with the type-III seesaw mechanism in events\nwith three or more electrons or muons is presented. The data sample consists of\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at\nthe LHC in 2016 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse\nfemtobarns. Selection criteria based on the number of leptons and the invariant\nmass of opposite-sign lepton pairs are used to distinguish the signal from the\nstandard model background. The observations are consistent with the\nexpectations from standard model processes. The results are used to place\nlimits on the production of heavy fermions of the type-III seesaw model as a\nfunction of the branching ratio to each lepton flavor. In the scenario of equal\nbranching fractions to each lepton flavor, heavy fermions with masses below 840\nGeV are excluded. This is the most sensitive probe to date of the type-III\nseesaw mechanism.\n", "  The early stages of low-mass star formation are likely to be subject to\nintense ionization by protostellar energetic MeV particles. As a result, the\nsurrounding gas is enriched in molecular ions, such as HCO$^{+}$ and\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$. Nonetheless, this phenomenon remains poorly understood for\nClass 0 objects. Recently, based on Herschel observations taken as part of the\nkey program Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS), a very\nlow HCO$^{+}$/N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio of about 3-4, has been reported\ntoward the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4. This finding suggests a cosmic-ray\nionization rate in excess of 10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$, much higher than the\ncanonical value of $\\zeta$ = 3$\\times$10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ (value expected in\nquiescent dense clouds). To assess the specificity of OMC-2 FIR4, we have\nextended this study to a sample of sources in low- and intermediate mass. More\nspecifically, we seek to measure the HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratio\nfrom high energy lines (J $\\ge$ 6) toward this source sample in order to infer\nthe flux of energetic particles in the warm and dense gas surrounding the\nprotostars. We use observations performed with the Heterodyne Instrument for\nthe FarInfrared spectrometer on board the Herschel Space Observatory toward a\nsample of 9 protostars. We report HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ abundance ratios in\nthe range of 5 up to 73 toward our source sample. The large error bars do not\nallow us to conclude whether OMC-2~FIR4 is a peculiar source. Nonetheless, an\nimportant result is that the measured HCO$^{+}$/N$_2$H$^{+}$ ratio does not\nvary with the source luminosity. At the present time, OMC-2 FIR4 remains the\nonly source where a high flux of energetic particles is clearly evident. More\nsensitive and higher angular resolution observations are required to further\ninvestigate this process.\n", "  Aim: We have collected the most complete multi-wavelength ($6.0 - 6.0 \\times\n10^{-18} cm$) dataset of very high energy (VHE) $\\gamma$-ray emitting (TeV) BL\nLacs, which are the most numerous extragalactic VHE sources. Using significant\ncorrelations between different bands, we aim to identify the best TeV BL Lac\ncandidates that can be discovered by the current and next generation of imaging\nair Cherenkov telescopes.\n  Methods: We formed five datasets from lower energy data, i.e. radio,\nmid-infrared, optical, X-rays, and GeV $\\gamma$-ray, and five VHE $\\gamma$-ray\ndatasets to perform a correlation study between different bands and to\nconstruct the prediction method. The low energy datasets were averaged for\nindividual sources, while the VHE $\\gamma$-ray data were divided into subsets\naccording to the flux state of the source. We then looked for significant\ncorrelations and determined their best-fit parameters. Using the best-fit\nparameters we predicted the level of VHE $\\gamma$-ray flux for a sample of 182\nBL Lacs, which have not been detected at TeV energies. We identified the most\npromising TeV BL Lac candidates based on the predicted VHE $\\gamma$-ray flux\nfor each source.\n  Results: We found 14 significant correlations between radio, mid-infrared,\noptical, $\\gamma$-ray, and VHE $\\gamma$-ray bands. The correlation between\noptical and VHE $\\gamma$-ray luminosity is established for the first time. We\nattribute this to the more complete sample and more accurate handling of host\ngalaxy flux in our work. We found nine BL Lac candidates whose predicted VHE\n$\\gamma$-ray flux is high enough for detection in less than 25 hours with\ncurrent imaging air Cherenkov telescopes.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown that the high temperature incommensurate (I)\ncharge density wave (CDW) phase of 1T-TaS2 can be photoinduced from the lower\ntemperature, nearly commensurate (NC) CDW state. Here we report a time-resolved\nx-ray diffraction study of the growth process of the photoinduced I-CDW\ndomains. The layered nature of the material results in a marked anisotropy in\nthe size of the photoinduced domains of the I-phase. These are found to grow\nself-similarly, their shape remaining unchanged throughout the growth process.\nThe photoinduced dynamics of the newly formed I-CDW phase was probed at various\nstages of the growth process using a double pump scheme, where a first pump\ncreates I-CDW domains and a second pump excites the newly formed I-CDW state.\nWe observe larger magnitudes of the coherently excited I-CDW amplitude mode in\nsmaller domains, which suggests that the incommensurate lattice distortion is\nless stable for smaller domain sizes.\n", "  We present high-resolution (sub-parsec) observations of a giant molecular\ncloud in the nearest star-forming galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. ALMA Band\n6 observations trace the bulk of the molecular gas in $^{12}$CO(2-1) and high\ncolumn density regions in $^{13}$CO(2-1). Our target is a quiescent cloud (PGCC\nG282.98-32.40, which we refer to as the \"Planck cold cloud\" or PCC) in the\nsouthern outskirts of the galaxy where star-formation activity is very low and\nlargely confined to one location. We decompose the cloud into structures using\na dendrogram and apply an identical analysis to matched-resolution cubes of the\n30 Doradus molecular cloud (located near intense star formation) for\ncomparison. Structures in the PCC exhibit roughly 10 times lower surface\ndensity and 5 times lower velocity dispersion than comparably sized structures\nin 30 Dor, underscoring the non-universality of molecular cloud properties. In\nboth clouds, structures with relatively higher surface density lie closer to\nsimple virial equilibrium, whereas lower surface density structures tend to\nexhibit super-virial line widths. In the PCC, relatively high line widths are\nfound in the vicinity of an infrared source whose properties are consistent\nwith a luminous young stellar object. More generally, we find that the smallest\nresolved structures (\"leaves\") of the dendrogram span close to the full range\nof line widths observed across all scales. As a result, while the bulk of the\nkinetic energy is found on the largest scales, the small-scale energetics tend\nto be dominated by only a few structures, leading to substantial scatter in\nobserved size-linewidth relationships.\n", "  The thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) can serve as a\nsensitive probe of cosmological heat sources and sinks. We employ it to limit\ninteractions between dark matter and baryons. After reionization the IGM\ntemperature is set by the balance between photoheating and adiabatic cooling.\nWe use measurements of the IGM temperature from Lyman-$\\alpha$-forest data to\nconstrain the cross-section $\\sigma$ between dark matter and baryons, finding\n$\\sigma < 10^{-20}$ cm$^2$ for dark-matter masses $m_\\chi\\leq 1$ GeV. This\nprovides the first direct constraint on scattering between dark matter and\nbaryons at redshift $z\\sim5$.\n", "  In antiferromagnetic materials the order parameter exhibits resonant modes at\nfrequencies that can be in the terahertz range, making them interesting\ncomponents for spintronic devices. Here, it is shown that antiferromagnetic\nresonance can be excited using the inverse spin-Hall effect in a system\nconsisting of an antiferromagnetic insulator coupled to a normal-metal\nwaveguide. The time-dependent interplay between spin-torque, ac\nspin-accumulation and magnetic degrees of freedom is studied. It is found that\nthe dynamics of the antiferromagnet effects the frequency-dependent\nconductivity of the normal metal. Further, it is shown that in\nantiferromagnetic insulators, the resonant excitation by ac spin-currents can\nbe orders of magnitude more efficient than excitation by the current-induced\nOersted field.\n", "  Multi-hydrogenated species with proper symmetry properties can present\ndifferent spin configurations, and thus exist under different spin symmetry\nforms, labeled as para and ortho for two-hydrogen molecules. We investigated\nhere the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of H$_2$Cl$^+$ in the light of new\nobservations performed in the z=0.89 absorber toward the lensed quasar PKS\n1830-211 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Two\nindependent lines of sight were observed, to the southwest (SW) and northeast\n(NE) images of the quasar, with OPR values found to be $3.15 \\pm 0.13$ and $3.1\n\\pm 0.5$ in each region, respectively, in agreement with a spin statistical\nweight of 3:1. An OPR of 3:1 for a molecule containing two identical hydrogen\nnuclei can refer to either a statistical result or a high-temperature limit\ndepending on the reaction mechanism leading to its formation. It is thus\ncrucial to identify rigorously how OPRs are produced in order to constrain the\ninformation that these probes can provide. To understand the production of the\nH$_2$Cl$^+$ OPR, we undertook a careful theoretical study of the reaction\nmechanisms involved with the aid of quasi-classical trajectory calculations on\na new global potential energy surface fit to a large number of high-level ab\ninitio data. Our study shows that the major formation reaction for H$_2$Cl$^+$\nproduces this ion via a hydrogen abstraction rather than a scrambling\nmechanism. Such a mechanism leads to a 3:1 OPR, which is not changed by\ndestruction and possible thermalization reactions for H$_2$Cl$^+$ and is thus\nlikely to be the cause of observed 3:1 OPR ratios, contrary to the normal\nassumption of scrambling.\n", "  Within the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP) sample, we\nidentified an ongoing 1:1 merger between two galaxies and the consequent\nformation of a tidal dwarf galaxy (TDG). The system is observed at z = 0.05043\nand is part of a poor group. Exploiting the exquisite quality of the MUSE/VLT\ndata, we present the spatially resolved kinematics and physical properties of\ngas and stars of this object and describe its evolutionary history. An old\n(luminosity weighted age ~2x10^9yr), gas poor, early-type-like galaxy is\nmerging with a younger (luminosity weighted age ~2.5x10^8 yr), gas rich,\nlate-type galaxy . The system has a quite strong metallicity gradient,\nindicative of an early-stage phase. Comparing the spatial extension of the star\nformation at different epochs, we date the beginning of the merger between\n~10^7 yr<t<5.7x10^8 yr ago. The gas kinematic pattern reflects that of the\nlate-type object and is distorted in correspondence to the location of the\nimpact. The stellar kinematic instead is more chaotic, as expected for mergers.\nThe gas redistribution in the system induces high levels of star formation\nbetween the two components, where we indeed detect the birth of the TDG. This\nstellar structure has a mass of ~6x10^9 M_sun, a radius of ~2 kpc and, even\nthough it has already accreted large quantities of gas and stars, it is still\nlocated within the disk of the progenitor, is characterized by a high velocity\ndispersion, indicating that it is still forming, is dusty and has high levels\nof star formation SFR~0.3 M_sun/yr). This TDG is originated in an early-stage\nmerger, while these structures usually form in more evolved systems.\n", "  Recently, orthorhombic CuMnAs has been proposed to be a magnetic material\nwhere topological fermions exist around the Fermi level. Here we report the\nmagnetic structure of the orthorhombic Cu0.95MnAs and Cu0.98Mn0.96As single\ncrystals. While Cu0.95MnAs is a commensurate antiferromagnet (C-AFM) below 360\nK with a propagation vector of k = 0, Cu0.98Mn0.96As undergoes a second-order\nparamagnetic to incommensurate antiferromagnetic (IC-AFM) phase transition at\n320 K with k = (0.1,0,0), followed by a second-order IC-AFM to C-AFM phase\ntransition at 230 K. In the C-AFM state, the Mn spins order parallel to the\nb-axis but antiparallel to their nearest-neighbors with the easy axis along the\nb axis. This magnetic order breaks Ry gliding and S2z rotational symmetries,\nthe two crucial for symmetry analysis, resulting in finite band gaps at the\ncrossing point and the disappearance of the massless topological fermions.\nHowever, the spin-polarized surface states and signature induced by non-trivial\ntopology still can be observed in this system, which makes orthorhombic CuMnAs\npromising in antiferromagnetic spintronics.\n", "  (Abridged) Blue compact galaxies (BCG) are gas-rich, low-mass, small systems\nthat form stars at unusually high rates. This makes them excellent laboratories\nfor investigating the process of star-formation (SF) at galactic scales and the\neffects of massive stellar feedback on the interstellar (and intergalactic)\nmedium.\n  We analyzed the BCG Tololo 1937-423 using optical integral field spectroscopy\nwith VIMOS at the Very Large Telescope to probe its morphology, stellar\ncontent, nebular excitation and ionization properties, and the kinematics of\nits warm ionized gas.\n  We found that Tololo 1937-423 is currently undergoing an extended starburst,\nwith nine major $H\\alpha$ clumps. The galaxy presents a single continuum peak\nthat is not cospatial with any knot in emission lines, indicating at least two\nrelatively recent episodes of SF. The inhomogeneous dust distribution reaches\nits maximum roughly at the position of the continuum peak. We found shocked\nregions in the galaxy outer regions and at the edges of the SF knots. The\noxygen abundance is similar in all the SF regions, suggesting a chemically\nhomogeneous ionized interstellar medium over spatial scales of several kpc. The\nionized gas kinematics displays an overall regular rotation around a\nnorthwest-southeast axis.\n  The morphology of the galaxy and the two different episodes of SF suggest a\nscenario of triggered (induced by supernova shock waves) SF acting in Tololo\n1937-423. The inferred ages for the different SF episodes (~13-80 Myr for the\ncentral post-starburst and 5-7 Myr for the ongoing SF) are consistent with\ntriggered SF, with the most recent SF episode caused by the collective effect\nof stellar winds and supernova explosions from the central post-starburst. The\nvelocity dispersion pattern, with higher velocity dispersions found at the\nedges of the SF regions, and shocked regions in the galaxy, also favor this\nscenario.\n", "  The coherent charge transport through an illuminated graphene ribbon is\nstudied as function of electronic doping, frequency and strength of the\nelectromagnetic driving, for monochromatic circularly polarized light. We focus\non the DC current carried by 2D bulk carriers which is dominant (over edge\ntransport) for short and wide enough samples. Broad dips in conductance are\npredicted for one-photon and multi-photon resonances between the valence and\nconductance bands. The residual conductance can be associated with evanescent\nstates and related to dynamical gaps in the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum.\n", "  In a series of the experiments at different time-of-flight spectrometers of\nheavy ions we have observed manifestations of a new at least ternary decay\nchannel of low excited heavy nuclei. Due to specific features of the effect, it\nwas called collinear cluster tri-partition (CCT). The experimental results\nobtained initiated a number of theoretical articles dedicated to different\naspects of the CCT. We compare theoretical predictions with our experimental\ndata, only partially published so far. The model of one of the most populated\nCCT modes that gives rise to the so called \"Ni-bump\" is discussed. Detection of\nthe 68-72Ni fission fragments with a kinetic energy E<25 MeV at the\nmass-separator Lohengrin is proposed for an independent experimental\nverification of the CCT.\n", "  The substellar companion HD206893b has recently been discovered by direct\nimaging of its disc-bearing host star with the SPHERE instrument. We\ninvestigate the atypical properties of the companion, which has the reddest\nnear-infrared colours among all known substellar objects, either orbiting a\nstar or isolated, and we provide a comprehensive characterisation of the host\nstar-disc-companion system.\n  We conducted a follow-up of the companion with adaptive optics imaging and\nspectro-imaging with SPHERE, and a multiinstrument follow-up of its host star.\nWe obtain a R=30 spectrum from 0.95 to 1.64 micron of the companion and\nadditional photometry at 2.11 and 2.25 micron. We carried out extensive\natmosphere model fitting for the companions and the host star in order to\nderive their age, mass, and metallicity.\n  We found no additional companion in the system in spite of exquisite\nobserving conditions resulting in sensitivity to 6MJup (2MJup) at 0.5\" for an\nage of 300 Myr (50 Myr). We detect orbital motion over more than one year and\ncharacterise the possible Keplerian orbits. We constrain the age of the system\nto a minimum of 50 Myr and a maximum of 700 Myr, and determine that the\nhost-star metallicity is nearly solar. The comparison of the companion spectrum\nand photometry to model atmospheres indicates that the companion is an\nextremely dusty late L dwarf, with an intermediate gravity (log g 4.5-5.0)\nwhich is compatible with the independent age estimate of the system.\n  Though our best fit corresponds to a brown dwarf of 15-30 MJup aged 100-300\nMyr, our analysis is also compatible with a range of masses and ages going from\na 50 Myr 12MJup planetary-mass object to a 50 MJup Hyades-age brown dwarf...\n", "  A colloidal particle placed in an inhomogeneous solution of smaller\nnon-adsorbing polymers will move towards regions of lower polymer\nconcentration, in order to reduce the free energy of the interface between the\nsurface of the particle and the solution. This phenomenon is known as\ndiffusiophoresis. Treating the polymer as penetrable hard spheres, as in the\nAsakura-Oosawa model, a simple analytic expression for the diffusiophoretic\ndrift velocity can be obtained. In the context of drying films we show that\ndiffusiophoresis by this mechanism can lead to stratification under easily\naccessible experimental conditions. By stratification we mean spontaneous\nformation of a layer of polymer on top of a layer of the colloid. Transposed to\nthe case of binary colloidal mixtures, this offers an explanation for the\nstratification observed recently in these systems [A. Fortini et al, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 116, 118301 (2016)]. Our results emphasise the importance of treating\nsolvent dynamics explicitly in these problems, and caution against the neglect\nof hydrodynamic interactions or the use of implicit solvent models in which the\nabsence of solvent backflow results in an unbalanced osmotic force which gives\nrise to large but unphysical effects.\n", "  Atomistic simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of\naliphatic chain length in tetraalkylphosphonium cations on liquid morphologies,\nmicroscopic ionic structures and dynamical properties of tetraalkylphosphonium\nchloride ionic liquids. The liquid morphologies are characterized by\nsponge-like interpenetrating polar and apolar networks in ionic liquids\nconsisting of tetraalkylphosphonium cations with short aliphatic chains. The\nlengthening aliphatic chains in tetraalkylphosphonium cations leads to polar\ndomains consisting of chloride anions and central polar groups in cations being\npartially or totally segregated in ionic liquid matrices due to a progressive\nexpansion of apolar domains in between. Prominent polarity alternation peaks\nand adjacency correlation peaks are observed at low and high $q$ range in total\nX-ray scattering structural functions, respectively, and their peak positions\ngradually shift to lower q values with lengthening aliphatic chains in\ntetraalkylphosphonium cations. The charge alternation peaks registered in\nintermediate q range exhibit complicated tendencies due to the complete\ncancellations of peaks and anti-peaks in partial structural functions for ionic\nsubcomponents. The particular microstructures and liquid morphologies in\ntetraalkylphosphonium chloride ionic liquids intrinsically contribute to\ndistinct dynamics characterized by translational diffusion coefficients, van\nHove correlation functions, and non-Gaussian parameters for ionic species in\nheterogeneous ionic environment. The increase of aliphatic chain length in\ntetraalkylphosphonium cations leads to concomitant shift of van Hove\ncorrelation functions and non-Gaussian parameters to larger radial distances\nand longer timescales, respectively, indicating the enhanced translational\ndynamical heterogeneities of tetraalkylphosphonium cations and the\ncorresponding chloride anions.\n", "  NGC 6791 is one of the most studied open clusters, it is massive\n($\\sim5000\\,M_{\\odot}$), located at the solar circle, old ($~8\\,$Gyr) and yet\nthe most metal-rich cluster (${\\rm [Fe/H]}\\simeq0.4$) known in the Milky Way.\nBy performing an orbital analysis within a Galactic model including spiral arms\nand a bar, we found that it is plausible that NGC 6791 formed in the inner thin\ndisc or in the bulge, and later displaced by radial migration to its current\norbit. We apply different tools to simulate NGC 6791, including direct $N$-body\nsummation in time-varying potentials, to test its survivability when going\nthrough different Galactic environments. In order to survive the 8 Gyr journey\nmoving on a migrating orbit, NGC 6791 must have been more massive, $M_0 \\geq\n5\\times10^4 M_{\\odot}$, when formed. We find independent confirmation of this\ninitial mass in the stellar mass function, which is observed to be flat; this\ncan only be explained if the average tidal field strength experienced by the\ncluster is stronger than what it is at its current orbit. Therefore, the birth\nplace and journeys of NGC 6791 are imprinted in its chemical composition, in\nits mass loss, and in its flat stellar mass function, supporting its origin in\nthe inner thin disc or in the bulge.\n", "  We entertain the possibility that neutrino masses and dark matter (DM)\noriginate from a common composite dark sector. A minimal effective theory can\nbe constructed based on a dark $SU(3)_D$ interaction with three flavors of\nmassless dark quarks; electroweak symmetry breaking gives masses to the dark\nquarks. By assigning a $\\mathbb Z_2$ charge to one flavor, a stable \"dark kaon\"\ncan provide a good thermal relic DM candidate. We find that \"dark neutrons\" may\nbe identified as right handed Dirac neutrinos. Some level of\n\"neutron-anti-neutron\" oscillation in the dark sector can then result in\nnon-zero Majorana masses for light Standard Model neutrinos. A simple\nultraviolet completion is presented, involving additional heavy\n$SU(3)_D$-charged particles with electroweak and lepton Yukawa couplings. At\nour benchmark point, there are \"dark pions\" that are much lighter than the\nHiggs and we expect spectacular collider signals arising from the UV framework.\nThis includes the decay of the Higgs boson to $\\tau \\tau \\ell \\ell^{\\prime}$,\nwhere $\\ell$($\\ell'$) can be any lepton, with displaced vertices. We discuss\nthe observational signatures of this UV framework in dark matter searches and\nprimordial gravitational wave experiments; the latter signature is potentially\ncorrelated with the $H \\to \\tau \\tau \\ell \\ell^{\\prime}$ decay.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that the incidence rate of intervening strong\nMgII absorbers towards GRBs were a factor of 2 - 4 higher than towards quasars.\nExploring the similar sized and uniformly selected legacy data sets XQ-100 and\nXSGRB, each consisting of 100 quasar and 81 GRB afterglow spectra obtained with\na single instrument (VLT/X-shooter), we demonstrate that there is no\ndisagreement in the number density of strong MgII absorbers with rest-frame\nequivalent widths $W_r^{2796} >$ 1 {\\AA} towards GRBs and quasars in the\nredshift range 0.1 < z < 5. With large and similar sample sizes, and path\nlength coverages of $\\Delta$z = 57.8 and 254.4 for GRBs and quasars,\nrespectively, the incidences of intervening absorbers are consistent within 1\nsigma uncertainty levels at all redshifts. For absorbers at z < 2.3 the\nincidence towards GRBs is a factor of 1.5$\\pm$0.4 higher than the expected\nnumber of strong MgII absorbers in SDSS quasar spectra, while for quasar\nabsorbers observed with X-shooter we find an excess factor of 1.4$\\pm$0.2\nrelative to SDSS quasars. Conversely, the incidence rates agree at all\nredshifts with reported high spectral resolution quasar data, and no excess is\nfound. The only remaining discrepancy in incidences is between SDSS MgII\ncatalogues and high spectral resolution studies. The rest-frame equivalent\nwidth distribution also agrees to within 1 sigma uncertainty levels between the\nGRB and quasar samples. Intervening strong MgII absorbers towards GRBs are\ntherefore neither unusually frequent, nor unusually strong.\n", "  In this third paper of the Hawaii SCUBA-2 Lensing Cluster Survey series, we\npresent Submillimeter Array (SMA) detections of six intrinsically faint 850\n$\\mu$m sources detected in SCUBA-2 images of the lensing cluster fields, A1689,\nA2390, A370, MACS J0717.5+3745, and MACS J1423.8+2404. Two of the SCUBA-2\nsources split into doublets, yielding a total of eight SMA detections. The\nintrinsic 870 $\\mu$m flux densities of these submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are\n$\\sim$ 1 mJy. Five of the eight SMGs are not detected in optical or\nnear-infrared (NIR) images. The NIR-to-submillimeter flux ratios of these faint\nSMGs suggest that most of them are extremely dusty and/or at very high\nredshifts. Combining these SMGs and several other samples from the literature,\nwe find a bimodal distribution for the faint sources in the space of\nsubmillimeter flux versus NIR-to-submillimeter flux ratio. While most of the\nSMA-detected lensed sources are very obscured, the other SMGs with similar flux\ndensities are mostly bright in the NIR. Future ALMA observations of a large\nsample of SCUBA-2 sources in cluster fields will allow us to decide whether the\nbimodality we observe here really exists.\n", "  To investigate the inner regions of protoplanetary disks, we performed\nnear-infrared interferometric observations of the classical TTauri binary\nsystem S CrA. We present the first VLTI-GRAVITY high spectral resolution\n($R\\sim$4000) observations of a classical TTauri binary, S CrA (composed of S\nCrA N and S CrA S and separated by $\\sim$1.4\"), combining the four 8-m\ntelescopes in dual-field mode. Our observations in the near-infrared K-band\ncontinuum reveal a disk around each binary component, with similar half-flux\nradii of about 0.1 au at d$\\sim$130 pc, inclinations ($i=$28$\\pm$3$^o$\\ and\n$i=$22$\\pm$6$^o$), and position angles (PA=0$^o\\pm$6$^o$ and\nPA=-2$^o\\pm$12$^o$), suggesting that they formed from the fragmentation of a\ncommon disk. The S CrA N spectrum shows bright HeI and Br$\\gamma$ line emission\nexhibiting inverse P-Cygni profiles, typically associated with infalling gas.\nThe continuum-compensated Br$\\gamma$ line visibilities of S CrA N show the\npresence of a compact Br$\\gamma$ emitting region the radius of which is about\n$\\sim$0.06 au, which is twice as big as the truncation radius. This component\nis mostly tracing a wind. Moreover, a slight radius change between the blue-\nand red-shifted Br$\\gamma$ line components is marginally detected. The presence\nof an inverse P-Cygni profile in the HeI and Br$\\gamma$ lines, along with the\ntentative detection of a slightly larger size of the blue-shifted Br$\\gamma$\nline component, hint at the simultaneous presence of a wind and magnetospheric\naccretion in S CrA N.\n", "  We study an antiferromagnetic order in the ground state of the half-filled\nHubbard model on the Penrose lattice and investigate the effects of\nquasiperiodic lattice structure. In the limit of infinitesimal Coulomb\nrepulsion $U \\rightarrow +0$, the staggered magnetizations persist to be\nfinite, and their values are determined by confined states, which are strictly\nlocalized with thermodynamics degeneracy. The magnetizations exhibit an exotic\nspatial pattern, and have the same sign in each of cluster regions, the size of\nwhich ranges from 31 sites to infinity. With increasing $U$, they continuously\nevolve to those of the corresponding spin model in the $U=\\infty$ limit. In\nboth limits of $U$, local magnetizations exhibit a fairly intricate spatial\npattern that reflects the quasiperiodic structure, but the pattern differs\nbetween the two limits. We have analyzed this pattern change by a mode analysis\nby the singular value decomposition method for the fractal-like magnetization\npattern projected into the perpendicular space.\n", "  We explore single-particle Anderson localization due to nonrandom\nquasiperiodic potentials in two and three dimensions. We introduce a class of\nself-dual models that generalize the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\\'e model to\nhigher dimensions. In three dimensions (3D) we find that the Anderson\nlocalization transitions appear to be in the same universality class as for\nrandom potentials. In scaling or renormalization group terms, this means that\nrandomness of the potential is irrelevant at the Anderson localization\ntransitions in 3D. In two dimensions (2D) we also explore the Ando model, which\nis in the symplectic symmetry class and shows an Anderson localization\ntransition for random potentials. Here, unlike in 3D, we find that the\nuniversality class changes when we instead use a quasiperiodic potential.\n", "  We report on the discovery of three transiting planets around GJ~9827. The\nplanets have radii of 1.75$_{-0.12}^{+0.11 }$, 1.36$_{- 0.09 }^{+ 0.09}$, and\n2.10$_{- 0.15 }^{+ 0.15 }$~R$_{\\oplus}$, and periods of 1.20896, 3.6480, and\n6.2014 days, respectively. The detection was made in Campaign 12 observations\nas part of our K2 survey of nearby stars. GJ~9827 is a $V = 10.39$~mag K6V star\nat distance of 30.3 parsecs and the nearest star to be found hosting planets by\nKepler and K2. The radial velocity follow-up, high resolution imaging, and\ndetection of multiple transiting objects near commensurability drastically\nreduce the false positive probability. The orbital periods of GJ~9827~b, c and\nd planets are very close to the 1:3:5 mean motion resonance. Our preliminary\nanalysis shows that GJ~9827 planets are excellent candidates for atmospheric\nobservations. Besides, the planetary radii span both sides of the rocky and\ngaseous divide, hence the system will be an asset in expanding our\nunderstanding of the threshold.\n", "  We report the results of high-angular-resolution observations that search for\nexozodiacal light in a sample of main sequence stars and sub-giants. Using the\n\"jouvence\" of the fiber linked unit for optical recombination (JouFLU) at the\ncenter for high angular resolution astronomy (CHARA) telescope array, we have\nobserved a total of 44 stars. Out of the 44 stars, 33 are new stars added to\nthe initial, previously published survey of 42 stars performed at CHARA with\nthe fiber linked unit for optical recombiation (FLUOR). Since the start of the\nsurvey extension, we have detected a K-band circumstellar excess for six new\nstars at the ~ 1\\% level or higher, four of which are known or candidate\nbinaries, and two for which the excess could be attributed to exozodiacal dust.\nWe have also performed follow-up observations of 11 of the stars observed in\nthe previously published survey and found generally consistent results. We do\nhowever detect a significantly larger excess on three of these follow-up\ntargets: Altair, $\\upsilon$ And and $\\kappa$ CrB. Interestingly, the last two\nare known exoplanet host stars. We perform a statistical analysis of the JouFLU\nand FLUOR samples combined, which yields an overall exozodi detection rate of\n$21.7^{+5.7}_{-4.1}\\%$. We also find that the K-band excess in FGK-type stars\ncorrelates with the existence of an outer reservoir of cold ($\\lesssim 100\\,$K)\ndust at the $99\\%$ confidence level, while the same cannot be said for A-type\nstars.\n", "  We demonstrate the emergence of universal Efimov physics for interacting\nphotons in cold gases of Rydberg atoms. We consider the behavior of three\nphotons injected into the gas in their propagating frame, where a paraxial\napproximation allows us to consider them as massive particles. In contrast to\natoms and nuclei, the photons have a large anisotropy between their\nlongitudinal mass, arising from dispersion, and their transverse mass, arising\nfrom diffraction. Nevertheless, we show that in suitably rescaled coordinates\nthe effective interactions become dominated by s-wave scattering near threshold\nand, as a result, give rise to an Efimov effect near unitarity. We show that\nthe three-body loss of these Efimov trimers can be strongly suppressed and\ndetermine conditions under which these states are observable in current\nexperiments. These effects can be naturally extended to probe few-body\nuniversality beyond three bodies, as well as the role of Efimov physics in the\nnon-equilbrium, many-body regime.\n", "  The temporal covariance between seismic waves measured at two locations on\nthe solar surface is the fundamental observable in time-distance\nhelioseismology. Above the acoustic cut-off frequency ($\\sim$5.3~mHz), waves\nare not trapped in the solar interior and the covariance function can be used\nto probe the upper atmosphere. We wish to implement appropriate radiative\nboundary conditions for computing the propagation of high-frequency waves in\nthe solar atmosphere. We consider the radiative boundary conditions recently\ndeveloped by Barucq et al. (2017) for atmospheres in which sound-speed is\nconstant and density decreases exponentially with radius. We compute the\ncross-covariance function using a finite element method in spherical geometry\nand in the frequency domain. The ratio between first- and second-skip\namplitudes in the time-distance diagram is used as a diagnostic to compare\nboundary conditions and to compare with observations. We find that a boundary\ncondition applied 500 km above the photosphere and derived under the\napproximation of small angles of incidence accurately reproduces the `infinite\natmosphere' solution for high-frequency waves. When the radiative boundary\ncondition is applied 2 Mm above the photosphere, we find that the choice of\natmospheric model affects the time-distance diagram. In particular, the\ntime-distance diagram exhibits double-ridge structure when using a VAL\natmospheric model.\n", "  We present results of searches for vector and pseudo-scalar bosonic\nsuper-WIMPs, which are dark matter candidates with masses at the keV-scale,\nwith the XENON100 experiment. XENON100 is a dual-phase xenon time projection\nchamber operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. A profile\nlikelihood analysis of data with an exposure of 224.6 live days $\\times$ 34\\,kg\nshowed no evidence for a signal above the expected background. We thus obtain\nnew and stringent upper limits in the $(8-125)$\\,keV/c$^2$ mass range,\nexcluding couplings to electrons with coupling constants of $g_{ae} >\n3\\times10^{-13}$ for pseudo-scalar and $\\alpha'/\\alpha > 2\\times10^{-28}$ for\nvector super-WIMPs, respectively. These limits are derived under the assumption\nthat super-WIMPs constitute all of the dark matter in our galaxy.\n", "  The two-dimensional electron gas occurring between the band insulators\nSrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$ continues to attract considerable interest, due to the\npossibility of dynamic control over the carrier density, and the ensuing\nphenomena such as magnetism and superconductivity. The formation of this\nconducting interface is sensitive to the growth conditions, but despite\nnumerous investigations, there are still questions about the details of the\nphysics involved. In particular, not much is known about the electronic\nstructure of the growing LaAlO$_3$ layer at the growth temperature (around 800\n$^o$C) in oxygen (pressure around $5\\times 10^{-5}$ mbar), since analysis\ntechniques at these conditions are not readily available. We developed a pulsed\nlaser deposition system inside a low-energy electron microscope in order to\nstudy this issue. The setup allows for layer-by-layer growth control and\nin-situ measurements of the angle-dependent electron reflection intensity,\nwhich can be used as a fingerprint of the electronic structure of the surface\nlayers during growth. By using different substrate terminations and growth\nconditions we observe two families of reflectivity maps, which we can connect\neither to samples with an AlO$_2$-rich surface and a conducting interface; or\nto samples with a LaO-rich surface and an insulating interface. Our\nobservations emphasize that substrate termination and stoichiometry determine\nthe electronic structure of the growing layer, and thereby the conductance of\nthe interface.\n", "  The Hercules stream is a group of co-moving stars in the Solar neighbourhood,\nwhich can potentially be explained as a signature of either the outer Lindblad\nresonance (OLR) of a fast Galactic bar or the corotation resonance of a slower\nbar. In either case, the feature should be present over a large area of the\ndisc. With the recent commissioning of the APOGEE-2 Southern spectrograph we\ncan search for the Hercules stream at $(l,b)=(270^\\circ,0)$, a direction in\nwhich the Hercules stream, if caused by the bar's OLR, would be strong enough\nto be detected using only the line-of-sight velocities. We clearly detect a\nnarrow, Hercules-like feature in the data that can be traced from the solar\nneighbourhood to a distance of about 4 kpc. The detected feature matches well\nthe line-of-sight velocity distribution from the fast-bar (OLR) model.\nConfronting the data with a model where the Hercules stream is caused by the\ncorotation resonance of a slower bar leads to a poorer match, as the corotation\nmodel does not predict clearly separated modes, possibly because the slow-bar\nmodel is too hot.\n", "  The very high precision of current measurements and theory predictions of\nspectral lines in few-electron atoms allows to efficiently probe the existence\nof exotic forces between electrons, neutrons and protons. We investigate the\nsensitivity to new spin-independent interactions in transition frequencies (and\ntheir isotopic shifts) of hydrogen, helium and some helium-like ions. We find\nthat present data probe new regions of the force-carrier couplings to electrons\nand neutrons around the MeV mass range. We also find that, below few keV, the\nsensitivity to the electron coupling in precision spectroscopy of helium and\npositronium is comparable to that of the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nelectron. Finally, we interpret our results in the dark-photon model where a\nnew gauge boson is kinetically mixed with the photon. There, we show that\nhelium transitions, combined with the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nelectron, provide the strongest indirect bound from laboratory experiments\nabove 100keV.\n", "  Context: Cepheids are excellent tracers of young stellar populations. They\nplay a crucial role in astrophysics as standard candles. The chemistry of\nclassical Cepheids in the Milky Way is now quite well-known. Despite a much\nlarger sample, the chemical composition of Magellanic Cepheids has been only\nscarcely investigated. Aims: For the first time, we study the chemical\ncomposition of several Cepheids located in the same populous cluster: NGC 1866,\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). To also investigate the chemical\ncomposition of Cepheids at lower metallicity, four targets are located in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample allows us to increase the number of\nCepheids with known metallicities in the LMC/SMC by 20%/25% and the number of\nCepheids with detailed chemical composition in the LMC/SMC by 46%/50%. Methods:\nWe use canonical spectroscopic analysis to determine the chemical composition\nof Cepheids and provide abundances for a good number of $\\alpha$, iron-peak and\nneutron-capture elements. Results: We find that six Cepheids in the LMC cluster\nNGC 1866 have a very homogeneous chemical composition, also consistent with red\ngiant branch (RGB) stars in the cluster. Period--age relations that include no\nor average rotation indicate that all the Cepheids in NGC 1866 have a similar\nage and therefore belong to the same stellar population. Our results are in\ngood agreement with theoretical models accounting for luminosity and radial\nvelocity variations. Using distances based on period-luminosity relations in\nthe near- or mid-infrared, we investigate for the first time the metallicity\ndistribution of the young population in the SMC in the depth direction.\nPreliminary results show no metallicity gradient along the SMC main body, but\nour sample is small and does not contain Cepheids in the inner few degrees of\nthe SMC.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional system combining local magnetic moments and a\ndelocalized metallic band on top of a superconducting substrate. This system\ncan describe a chain of magnetic impurities with both localized polarized\norbitals and delocalized s-like orbitals or a conducting wire with embedded\nmagnetic impurities. We study the interplay between the one-dimensional Shiba\nband physics arising from the interplay between magnetic moments and the\nsubstrate and the delocalized wire-like conduction band on top of the\nsuperconductor. We derive an effective low-energy Hamiltonian in terms of two\ncoupled asymmetric Kitaev-like Hamiltonians and analyze its topological\nproperties. We have found that this system can host multiple Majorana bound\nstates at its extremities provided a magnetic mirror symmetry is present. We\ncompute the phase diagram of the system depending on the magnetic exchange\ninteractions, the impurity distance and especially the coupling between both\nbands. In presence of inhomogeneities which typically break this magnetic\nmirror symmetry, we show that the coexistence of a Shiba and wire delocalized\ntopological band can drive the system into a non-topological regime with a\nsplitting of Majorana bound states.\n", "  We report the physical properties of orthorhombic o-CuMnAs single crystal,\nwhich is predicted to be a topological Dirac semimetal with magnetic ground\nstate and inversion symmetry broken. o-CuMnAs exhibits an antiferromagnetic\ntransition with TN ~ 312 K. Further characterizations of magnetic properties\nsuggest that the AFM order may be canted with the spin orientation in the bc\nplane. Small isotropic MR and linearly field-dependent Hall resistivity with\npositive slope indicate that single hole-type carries with high density and low\nmobility dominate the transport properties of o-CuMnAs. Furthermore, the result\nof low-temperature heat capacity shows that the effective mass of carriers is\nmuch larger than those in typical topological semimetals. These results imply\nthat the carriers in o-CuMnAs exhibit remarkably different features from those\nof Dirac fermions predicted in theory.\n", "  We extend the idea of fermion bags to Hamiltonian lattice field theories in\nthe continuous time formulation. Using a class of models we argue that the\ntemperature is a parameter that splits the fermion dynamics into small spatial\nregions that can be used to identify fermion bags. Using this idea we construct\na continuous time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm and compute critical exponents\nin the 3d Ising Gross-Neveu universality class using a single flavor of\nmassless Hamiltonian staggered fermions. We find $\\eta$=0.54(6) and\n$\\nu$=0.88(2) using lattices up to N=2304 sites. We argue that even sizes up to\nN=10,000 sites should be accessible with supercomputers available today.\n", "  A major question in galaxy formation is how the gas supply that fuels\nactivity in galaxies is modulated by their environment. We use spectroscopy of\na set of well characterized clusters and groups at $0.4<z<0.8$ from the ESO\nDistant Cluster Survey (EDisCS) and compare it to identically selected field\ngalaxies. Our spectroscopy allows us to isolate galaxies that are dominated by\nold stellar populations. Here we study a stellar-mass limited sample\n($\\log(M_*/M_\\odot)>10.4$) of these old galaxies with weak [OII] emission. We\nuse line ratios and compare to studies of local early type galaxies to conclude\nthat this gas is likely excited by post-AGB stars and hence represents a\ndiffuse gas component in the galaxies. For cluster and group galaxies the\nfraction with EW([OII])$>5$\\AA\\ is $f_{[OII]}=0.08^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ and\n$f_{[OII]}=0.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$ respectively. For field galaxies we find\n$f_{[OII]}=0.27^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, representing a 2.8$\\sigma$ difference between\nthe [OII] fractions for old galaxies between the different environments. We\nconclude that a population of old galaxies in all environments has ionized gas\nthat likely stems from stellar mass loss. In the field galaxies also experience\ngas accretion from the cosmic web and in groups and clusters these galaxies\nhave had their gas accretion shut off by their environment. Additionally,\ngalaxies with emission preferentially avoid the virialized region of the\ncluster in position-velocity space. We discuss the implications of our results,\namong which is that gas accretion shutoff is likely effective at group halo\nmasses (log~${\\cal M}/$\\msol$>12.8$) and that there are likely multiple gas\nremoval processes happening in dense environments.\n", "  The basic parameters for calculations of radiative neutron capture , photon\nstrength functions and nuclear level densities near the neutron separation\nenergy are determined based on experimental data without an ad-hoc assumption\nabout axial symmetry - at variance to previous analysis. Surprisingly few\nglobal fit parameters are needed in addition to information on nuclear\ndeformation, taken from Hartree Fock Bogolyubov (HFB) calculations with the\nGogny force, and the generator coordinator method (GCM) assures properly\ndefined angular momentum. For a large number of nuclei the GDR shapes and the\nphoton strength are described by the sum of three Lorentzians (TLO),\nextrapolated to low energies and normalized in accordance to the dipole sum\nrule. Level densities are influenced strongly by the significant collective\nenhancement based on the breaking of shape symmetry. The replacement of axial\nsymmetry by the less stringent requirement of invariance against rotation by\n180 degree leads to a novel prediction for radiative neutron capture. It\ncompares well to recent compilations of average radiative widths and Maxwellian\naverage cross sections for neutron capture by even target nuclei. An extension\nto higher spin promises a reliable prediction for various compound nuclear\nreactions also outside the valley of stability. Such predictions are of high\nimportance for future nuclear energy systems and waste transmutation as well as\nfor the understanding of the cosmic synthesis of heavy elements.\n", "  The observable spectrum of an unresolved binary star system is a\nsuperposition of two single-star spectra. Even without a detectable velocity\noffset between the two stellar components, the combined spectrum of a binary\nsystem is in general different from that of either component, and fitting it\nwith single-star models may yield inaccurate stellar parameters and abundances.\nWe perform simple experiments with synthetic spectra to investigate the effect\nof unresolved main-sequence binaries on spectral fitting, modeling spectra\nsimilar to those collected by the APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST surveys. We find\nthat fitting unresolved binaries with single-star models introduces systematic\nbiases in the derived stellar parameters and abundances that are modest but\ncertainly not negligible, with typical systematic errors of $300\\,\\rm K$ in\n$T_{\\rm eff}$, 0.1 dex in $\\log g$, and 0.1 dex in $[\\rm Fe/H]$ for APOGEE-like\nspectra of solar-type stars. These biases are smaller for spectra at optical\nwavelengths than in the near-infrared. We show that biases can be corrected by\nfitting spectra with a binary model, which adds only two labels to the fit and\nincludes single-star models as a special case. Our model provides a promising\nnew method to constrain the Galactic binary population, including systems with\nsingle-epoch spectra and no detectable velocity offset between the two stars.\n", "  {Context}. The HIFI instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory performed\nover 9100 astronomical observations, almost 900 of which were calibration\nobservations in the course of the nearly four-year Herschel mission. The data\nfrom each observation had to be converted from raw telemetry into calibrated\nproducts and were included in the Herschel Science Archive. {Aims}. The HIFI\npipeline was designed to provide robust conversion from raw telemetry into\ncalibrated data throughout all phases of the HIFI missions. Pre-launch\nlaboratory testing was supported as were routine mission operations. {Methods}.\nA modular software design allowed components to be easily added, removed,\namended and/or extended as the understanding of the HIFI data developed during\nand after mission operations. {Results}. The HIFI pipeline processed data from\nall HIFI observing modes within the Herschel automated processing environment\nas well as within an interactive environment. The same software can be used by\nthe general astronomical community to reprocess any standard HIFI observation.\nThe pipeline also recorded the consistency of processing results and provided\nautomated quality reports. Many pipeline modules were in use since the HIFI\npre-launch instrument level testing. {Conclusions}. Processing in steps\nfacilitated data analysis to discover and address instrument artefacts and\nuncertainties. The availability of the same pipeline components from pre-launch\nthroughout the mission made for well-understood, tested, and stable processing.\nA smooth transition from one phase to the next significantly enhanced\nprocessing reliability and robustness.\n", "  In this paper, an improved thermal lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is proposed\nfor simulating liquid-vapor phase change, which is aimed at improving an\nexisting thermal LB model for liquid-vapor phase change [S. Gong and P. Cheng,\nInt. J. Heat Mass Transfer 55, 4923 (2012)]. First, we emphasize that the\nreplacement of \\[{\\left( {\\rho {c_V}} \\right)^{ - 1}}\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\n{\\lambda \\nabla T} \\right)\\] with \\[\\nabla \\cdot \\left( {\\chi \\nabla T}\n\\right)\\] is an inappropriate treatment for diffuse interface modeling of\nliquid-vapor phase change. Furthermore, the error terms ${\\partial_{t0}}\\left(\n{Tv} \\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\left( {Tvv} \\right)$, which exist in the\nmacroscopic temperature equation recovered from the standard thermal LB\nequation, are eliminated in the present model through a way that is consistent\nwith the philosophy of the LB method. In addition, the discrete effect of the\nsource term is also eliminated in the present model. Numerical simulations are\nperformed for droplet evaporation and bubble nucleation to validate the\ncapability of the improved model for simulating liquid-vapor phase change.\nNumerical comparisons show that the aforementioned replacement leads to\nsignificant numerical errors and the error terms in the recovered macroscopic\ntemperature equation also result in considerable errors.\n", "  The absence of a physically motivated model for large scale profiles of\ncosmic voids limits our ability to extract valuable cosmological information\nfrom their study. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the\nspherically compensated cosmic regions, named CoSpheres. Such cosmic regions\nare identified around local extrema in the density field and admit a unique\ncompensation radius $R_1$ where the internal spherical mass is exactly\ncompensated. Their origin is studied by extending the standard peak model and\nimplementing the compensation condition. Since the compensation radius evolves\nas the Universe itself, $R_1(t)\\propto a(t)$, CoSpheres behave as bubble\nUniverses with fixed comoving volume. Using the spherical collapse model, we\nreconstruct their profiles with a very high accuracy until $z=0$ in N-body\nsimulations. CoSpheres are symmetrically defined and reconstructed for both\ncentral maximum (seeding haloes and galaxies) and minimum (identified with\ncosmic voids). We show that the full non linear dynamics can be solved\nanalytically around this particular compensation radius, providing useful\npredictions for cosmology. This formalism highlights original correlations\nbetween local extremum and their large scale cosmic environment. The\nstatistical properties of these spherically compensated cosmic regions and the\npossibilities to constrain efficiently both cosmology and gravity will be\ninvestigated in companion papers.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to investigate the detection by GRAVITY of\ndifferent relativistic effects affecting the astrometric and/or spectroscopic\nobservations of S2 such as the transverse Doppler shift, the gravitational\nredshift, the pericenter advance and higher-order general relativistic (GR)\neffects, in particular the Lense-Thirring effect due to the angular momentum of\nthe black hole. We showed that the combination of S2 observations obtained with\nthe GRAVITY instrument and the spectrograph SINFONI (Spectrograph for INtegral\nField Observations in the Near Infrared) also installed at the VLT (Very Large\nTelescope) will lead to the detection of various relativistic effects. Such\ndetections will be possible with S2 monitorings obtained within a few months or\nyears, depending on the effect. Strong constraints on the angular momentum of\nSgr~A* (e.g., at $1\\sigma~=~0.1$) with the S2 star will be possible with a\nsimple stellar-orbit model without using a ray-tracing code but with\napproximating the gravitational lensing effect. However, long monitorings are\nnecessary, and we thus must rely on the discovery of closer-in stars near\nSgr~A* if we want to efficiently constrain the black hole parameters with\nstellar orbits in a short time, or monitor the flares if they orbit around the\nblack hole.\n", "  Until recently, determining the rotational properties of galaxies in the\nearly universe (z>4, Universe age <1.5Gyr) was impractical, with the exception\nof a few strongly lensed systems. Combining the high resolution and sensitivity\nof ALMA at (sub-) millimeter wavelengths with the typically high strength of\nthe [CII] 158um emission line from galaxies and long-developed dynamical\nmodeling tools raises the possibility of characterizing the gas dynamics in\nboth extreme starburst galaxies and normal star forming disk galaxies at z~4-7.\nUsing a procedure centered around GIPSY's ROTCUR task, we have fit tilted ring\nmodels to some of the best available ALMA [CII] data of a small set of\ngalaxies: the MS galaxies HZ9 & HZ10, the Damped Lyman-alpha Absorber (DLA)\nhost galaxy ALMA J0817+1351, the submm galaxies AzTEC/C159 and COSMOS\nJ1000+0234, and the quasar host galaxy ULAS J1319+0950. This procedure directly\nderives rotation curves and dynamical masses as functions of radius for each\nobject. In one case, we present evidence for a dark matter halo of O(10^11)\nsolar masses. We present an analysis of the possible velocity dispersions of\nAzTEC/C159 and ULAS J1319+0950 based on matching simulated observations to the\nintegrated [CII] line profiles. Finally, we test the effects of observation\nresolution and sensitivity on our results. While the conclusions remain limited\nat the resolution and signal-to-noise ratios of these observations, the results\ndemonstrate the viability of the modeling tools at high redshift, and the\nexciting potential for detailed dynamical analysis of the earliest galaxies, as\nALMA achieves full observational capabilities.\n", "  We study the variability of solar activity using new photospheric proxies\noriginally developed for the analysis of stellar magnetism with the CoRoT and\nKepler photometric observations. These proxies are obtained by tracking the\ntemporal modulations in the observations associated to the spots and magnetic\nfeatures as the Sun rotates. We analyze here 21 years, spanning solar cycles 23\nand 24, of the observations collected by the space-based photometric VIRGO and\nradial velocity GOLF instruments on board the SoHO satellite. The photospheric\nactivity proxy Sph is then calculated for each of the three VIRGO photometers\nas well as the associated Svel proxy from the radial velocity GOLF\nobservations. Comparisons with several standard solar activity proxies\nsensitive to different layers of the Sun demonstrate that these new activity\nproxies, Sph and Svel, provide a new manner to monitor solar activity. We show\nthat both the long- and short-term magnetic variabilities respectively\nassociated to the 11-year cycle and the quasi-biennial oscillation are well\nmonitored, and that the magnetic field interaction between the subsurface, the\nphotosphere, and the chromosphere of the Sun, was modified between Cycle 24 and\nCycle 23. Furthermore, the photometric proxies show a wavelength dependence of\nthe response function of the solar photosphere among the three channels of the\nVIRGO photometers, providing inputs for the study of the stellar magnetism of\nSun-like stars.\n", "  We demonstrate quantum entanglement of two trapped atomic ion qubits using a\nsequence of ultrafast laser pulses. Unlike previous demonstrations of\nentanglement mediated by the Coulomb interaction, this scheme does not require\nconfinement to the Lamb-Dicke regime and can be less sensitive to ambient noise\ndue to its speed. To elucidate the physics of an ultrafast phase gate, we\ngenerate a high entanglement rate using just 10 pulses, each of $\\sim20$ ps\nduration, and demonstrate an entangled Bell-state with $(76\\pm1)$% fidelity.\nThese results pave the way for entanglement operations within a large\ncollection of qubits by exciting only local modes of motion.\n", "  We investigate students' sense of ownership of multiweek final projects in an\nupper-division optics lab course. Using a multiple case study approach, we\ndescribe three student projects in detail. Within-case analyses focused on\nidentifying key issues in each project, and constructing chronological\ndescriptions of those events. Cross-case analysis focused on identifying\nemergent themes with respect to five dimensions of project ownership: student\nagency, instructor mentorship, peer collaboration, interest and value, and\naffective responses. Our within- and cross-case analyses yielded three major\nfindings. First, coupling division of labor with collective brainstorming can\nhelp balance student agency, instructor mentorship, and peer collaboration.\nSecond, students' interest in the project and perceptions of its value can\nincrease over time; initial student interest in the project topic is not a\nnecessary condition for student ownership of the project. Third, student\nownership is characterized by a wide range of emotions that fluctuate as\nstudents alternate between extended periods of struggle and moments of success\nwhile working on their projects. These findings not only extend the literature\non student ownership into a new educational domain---namely, upper-division\nphysics labs---they also have concrete implications for the design of\nexperimental physics projects in courses for which student ownership is a\ndesired learning outcome. We describe the course and projects in sufficient\ndetail that others can adapt our results to their particular contexts.\n", "  The effective potential V in a massless self-coupled scalar theory and\nmassless scalar electrodynamics is considered. Both the MS and Coleman-Weinberg\nrenormalization schemes are examined. The renormalization scheme dependence of\nV is determined. Upon summing all of the logarithmic contributions to V, it is\nshown that the implicit and explicit dependence on the renormalization scale\n{\\mu} cancels. In addition, if there is spontaneous symmetry breaking, then the\ndependence on the background field {\\Phi} cancels, leaving V flat but with\nnon-perturbative contributions. The quartic scalar coupling in the\nColeman-Weinberg renormalization scheme consequently vanishes.\n", "  We theoretically study the creation of knot structures in the polar phase of\nspin-1 BECs using the counterdiabatic protocol in an unusual fashion. We\nprovide an analytic solution to the evolution of the external magnetic field\nthat is used to imprint the knots. As confirmed by our simulations using the\nfull three-dimensional spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii equation, our method allows for\nthe precise control of the Hopf charge as well as the creation time of the\nknots. The knots with Hopf charge exceeding unity display multiple nested Hopf\nlinks.\n", "  We propose a new method to numerically compute the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices for\ndisordered topological insulators in Kitaev's periodic table. All of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices are known to be derived from the index formulae which\nare expressed in terms of a pair of projections introduced by Avron, Seiler,\nand Simon. For a given pair of projections, the corresponding index is\ndetermined by the spectrum of the difference between the two projections. This\ndifference exhibits remarkable and useful properties, as it is compact and has\na supersymmetric structure in the spectrum. These properties make it possible\nto numerically determine the indices of disordered topological insulators\nhighly efficiently. The method is demonstrated for the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang\nand Wilson-Dirac models whose topological phases are characterized by a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ index in two and three dimensions, respectively.\n", "  Using the example of a two dimensional four-fermion lattice field theory we\ndemonstrate that Feynman diagrams can generate a mass gap when massless\nfermions interact via a marginally relevant coupling. We introduce an infrared\ncutoff through the finite system size so that the perturbation series for the\npartition function and observables become convergent. We then use the Monte\nCarlo approach to sample sufficiently high orders of diagrams to expose the\npresence of a mass gap in the lattice model.\n", "  The dynamical diquark picture asserts that exotic hadrons can be formed from\nwidely separated colored diquark or triquark components. We use the\nBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation to study the spectrum of states thus\nconstructed, both in the basis of diquark spins and in the basis of heavy\nquark-antiquark spins. We develop a compact notation for naming these states,\nand use the results of lattice simulations for hybrid mesons to predict the\nlowest expected BO potentials for both tetraquarks and pentaquarks. We then\ncompare to the set of exotic candidates with experimentally determined quantum\nnumbers, and find that all of them can be accommodated. Once decay modes are\nalso considered, one can develop selection rules of both exact ($J^{PC}$\nconservation) and approximate (within the context of the BO approximation)\ntypes and test their effectiveness. We find that the most appealing way to\nsatisfy both sets of selection rules requires including additional low-lying BO\npotentials, a hypothesis that can be checked on the lattice.\n", "  We obtain several exact results for universal distributions involving the\nmaximum of the Airy$_2$ process minus a parabola and plus a Brownian motion,\nwith applications to the 1D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) stochastic growth\nuniversality class. This allows to obtain (i) the universal limit, for large\ntime separation, of the two-time height correlation for droplet initial\nconditions, e.g. $C_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t_2/t_1 \\to +\\infty} \\overline{h(t_1)\nh(t_2)}^c/\\overline{h(t_1)^2}^c$, with $C_{\\infty} \\approx 0.623$, as well as\nconditional moments, which quantify ergodicity breaking in the time evolution;\n(ii) in the same limit, the distribution of the midpoint position $x(t_1)$ of a\ndirected polymer of length $t_2$, and (iii) the height distribution in\nstationary KPZ with a step. These results are derived from the replica Bethe\nansatz for the KPZ continuum equation, with a \"decoupling assumption\" in the\nlarge time limit. They agree and confirm, whenever they can be compared, with\n(i) our recent tail results for two-time KPZ with de Nardis, checked in\nexperiments with Takeuchi, (ii) a recent result of Maes and Thiery on midpoint\nposition.\n", "  We examine the reconstruction of galaxy cluster radial density profiles\nobtained from Chandra and XMM X-ray observations, using high quality data for a\nsample of twelve objects covering a range of morphologies and redshifts. By\ncomparing the results obtained from the two observatories and by varying key\naspects of the analysis procedure, we examine the impact of instrumental\neffects and of differences in the methodology used in the recovery of the\ndensity profiles. We find that the final density profile shape is particularly\nrobust. We adapt the photon weighting vignetting correction method developed\nfor XMM for use with Chandra data, and confirm that the resulting Chandra\nprofiles are consistent with those corrected a posteriori for vignetting\neffects. Profiles obtained from direct deprojection and those derived using\nparametric models are consistent at the 1% level. At radii larger than\n$\\sim$6\", the agreement between Chandra and XMM is better than 1%, confirming\nan excellent understanding of the XMM PSF. We find no significant energy\ndependence. The impact of the well-known offset between Chandra and XMM gas\ntemperature determinations on the density profiles is found to be negligible.\nHowever, we find an overall normalisation offset in density profiles of the\norder of $\\sim$2.5%, which is linked to absolute flux cross-calibration issues.\nAs a final result, the weighted ratios of Chandra to XMM gas masses computed at\nR2500 and R500 are r=1.03$\\pm$0.01 and r=1.03$\\pm$0.03, respectively. Our study\nconfirms that the radial density profiles are robustly recovered, and that any\ndifferences between Chandra and XMM can be constrained to the $\\sim$ 2.5%\nlevel, regardless of the exact data analysis details. These encouraging results\nopen the way for the true combination of X-ray observations of galaxy clusters,\nfully leveraging the high resolution of Chandra and the high throughput of XMM.\n", "  We study small-scale brightenings in Ca II 8542 \\AA\\ line-core images to\ndetermine their nature and effect on localized heating and mass transfer in\nactive regions. High-resolution 2D spectroscopic observations of an active\nregion in the Ca II 8542 \\AA\\ line were acquired with the GFPI attached to the\n1.5-meter GREGOR telescope. Inversions of the spectra were carried out using\nNICOLE. We identified three brightenings of sizes up to 2\"x2\". We found\nevidence that the brightenings belonged to the footpoints of a microflare (MF).\nThe properties of the observed brightenings disqualified the scenarios of\nEllerman bombs or IRIS bombs. However, this MF shared some common properties\nwith flaring active-region fibrils or flaring arch filaments (FAFs): (1) FAFs\nand MFs are both apparent in chromospheric and coronal layers according to the\nAIA channels, and (2) both show flaring arches with lifetimes of about 3.0-3.5\nmin and lengths of about 20\". The inversions revealed heating by 600 K at the\nfootpoint location in the ambient chromosphere during the impulsive phase.\nConnecting the footpoints, a dark filamentary structure appeared in the Ca II\nline-core images. Before the start of the MF, the spectra of this structure\nalready indicated average blueshifts, meaning upward motions of the plasma\nalong the LOS. During the impulsive phase, these velocities increased up to\n-2.2 km/s. Downflows dominated at the footpoints. However, in the upper\nphotosphere, slight upflows occurred during the impulsive phase. Hence,\nbidirectional flows are present in the footpoints of the MF. Conclusions: We\ndetected Ca II brightenings that coincided with the footpoint location of an\nMF. The MF event led to a rise of plasma in the upper photosphere, both before\nand during the impulsive phase. Excess mass, previously raised to at most\nchromospheric layers, slowly drained downward along arches toward the\nfootpoints of the MF.\n", "  The velocity distribution of stars in the Solar neighbourhood is\ninhomogeneous and rich with stellar streams and kinematic structures. These may\nretain important clues of the formation and dynamical history of the Milky Way.\nHowever, the nature and origin of many of the streams and structures is\nunclear, hindering our understanding of how the Milky Way formed and evolved.\nWe aim to study the velocity distribution of stars of the Solar neighbourhood\nand investigate the properties of individual kinematic structures in order to\nimprove our understanding of their origins.\n  Using the astrometric data provided by Gaia DR1/TGAS and radial velocities\nfrom RAVE DR5 we perform a wavelet analysis with the `a trous algorithm to\n55831 stars that have U and V velocity uncertainties less than 4 km/s. An\nauto-convolution histogram method is used to filter the output data, and we\nthen run Monte Carlo simulations to verify that the detected structures are\nreal due to velocity uncertainties. Additionally we analysed our stellar sample\nby splitting all stars into a nearby sample (<300 pc) and a distant sample\n(>300 pc), and two chemically defined samples that to a first degree represent\nthe thin and the thick disks.\n  With the much enlarged stellar sample and much increased precision in\ndistances, proper motions, provided by Gaia DR1 TGAS we have shown that the\nvelocity distribution of stars in the Solar neighbourhood contains more\nstructures than previously known. A new feature is discovered and three\nrecently detected groups are confirmed at high confidence level. Dividing the\nsample based on distance and/or metallicity shows that there are variety of\nstructures which are as large-scale and small-scale groups, some of them have\nclear trends on metallicities, others are a mixture of both disk stars and\nbased on that we discuss possible origin of each group.\n", "  We present rest-frame optical spectra of 12 nitrogen-loud quasars at z ~ 2.2,\nwhose rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra show strong nitrogen broad emission\nlines. To investigate their narrow-line region (NLR) metallicities, we measure\nthe equivalent width (EW) of the [OIII]5007 emission line: if the NLR\nmetallicity is remarkably high as suggested by strong UV nitrogen lines, the\n[OIII]5007 line flux should be very week due to the low equilibrium temperature\nof the ionized gas owing to significant metal cooling. In the result, we found\nthat our spectra show moderate EW of the [OIII]5007 line similar to general\nquasars. This indicates nitrogen-loud quasars do not have extremely metal-rich\ngas clouds in NLRs. This suggests that strong nitrogen lines from broad-line\nregions (BLRs) are originated by exceptionally high abundances of nitrogen\nrelative to oxygen without very high BLR metallicities. This result indicates\nthat broad-emission lines of nitrogen are not good indicators of the BLR\nmetallicity in some cases. On the other hand, we also investigate virial\nblack-hole masses and Eddington ratios by using the Hbeta and CIV1549 lines for\nour sample. As a result, we found that black-hole masses and Eddington ratios\nof nitrogen-loud quasars tend to be low and high relative to normal quasars,\nsuggesting that nitrogen-loud quasars seem to be in a rapidly-accreting phase.\nThis can be explained in terms of a positive correlation between Eddington\nratios and nitrogen abundances of quasars, that is probably caused by the\nconnection between the mass accretion onto black holes and nuclear star\nformation.\n", "  Stringent constraints from direct detection experiments and the Large Hadron\nCollider motivate us to consider models in which the dark matter does not\ndirectly couple to the Standard Model, but that instead annihilates into hidden\nsector particles which ultimately decay through small couplings to the Standard\nModel. We calculate the gamma-ray emission generated within the context of\nseveral such hidden sector models, including those in which the hidden sector\ncouples to the Standard Model through the vector portal (kinetic mixing with\nStandard Model hypercharge), through the Higgs portal (mixing with the Standard\nModel Higgs boson), or both. In each case, we identify broad regions of\nparameter space in which the observed spectrum and intensity of the Galactic\nCenter gamma-ray excess can easily be accommodated, while providing an\nacceptable thermal relic abundance and remaining consistent with all current\nconstraints. We also point out that cosmic-ray antiproton measurements could\npotentially discriminate some hidden sector models from more conventional dark\nmatter scenarios.\n", "  We establish the multiparameter quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound for simultaneously\nestimating the centroid, the separation, and the relative intensities of two\nincoherent optical point sources using alinear imaging system. For equally\nbright sources, the Cram\\'er-Rao bound is independent of the source separation,\nwhich confirms that the Rayleigh resolution limit is just an artifact of the\nconventional direct imaging and can be overcome with an adequate strategy. For\nthe general case of unequally bright sources, the amount of information one can\ngain about the separation falls to zero, but we show that there is always a\nquadratic improvement in an optimal detection in comparison with the intensity\nmeasurements. This advantage can be of utmost important in realistic scenarios,\nsuch as observational astronomy.\n", "  RGG 118 (SDSS 1523+1145) is a nearby ($z=0.0243$), dwarf disk galaxy\n($M_{\\ast}\\approx2\\times10^{9} M_{\\odot}$) found to host an active $\\sim50,000$\nsolar mass black hole at its core (Baldassare et al. 2015). RGG 118 is one of a\ngrowing collective sample of dwarf galaxies known to contain active galactic\nnuclei -- a group which, until recently, contained only a handful of objects.\nHere, we report on new \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} Wide Field Camera 3 UVIS\nand IR imaging of RGG 118, with the main goal of analyzing its structure. Using\n2-D parametric modeling, we find that the morphology of RGG 118 is best\ndescribed by an outer spiral disk, inner component consistent with a\npseudobulge, and central PSF. The luminosity of the PSF is consistent with the\ncentral point source being dominated by the AGN. We measure the luminosity and\nmass of the \"pseudobulge\" and confirm that the central black hole in RGG 118 is\nunder-massive with respect to the $M_{BH}-M_{\\rm bulge}$ and $M_{BH}-L_{\\rm\nbulge}$ relations. This result is consistent with a picture in which black\nholes in disk-dominated galaxies grow primarily through secular processes.\n", "  We present deep high-resolution (R~15,000) and high-quality UVES optical\nspectrophotometry of nine planetary nebulae with dual-dust chemistry. We\ncompute physical conditions from several diagnostics. Ionic abundances for a\nlarge number of ions of N, O, Ne, S, Cl, Ar, K, Fe and Kr are derived from\ncollisionally excited lines. Elemental abundances are computed using\nstate-of-the-art ionization correction factors. We derive accurate C/O ratios\nfrom optical recombination lines. We have re-analyzed additional high-quality\nspectra of 14 PNe from the literature following the same methodology.\nComparison with asymptotic giant branch models reveals that about half of the\ntotal sample objects are consistent with being descendants of low-mass\nprogenitor stars (M < 1.5 Msun). Given the observed N/O, C/O, and He/H ratios,\nwe cannot discard that some of the objects come from more massive progenitor\nstars (M > 3--4 Msun) that have suffered a mild HBB. None of the objects seem\nto be a descendant of very massive progenitors. We propose that in most of the\nplanetary nebulae studied here, the PAHs have been formed through the\ndissociation of the CO molecule. The hypothesis of a last thermal pulse that\nturns O-rich PNe into C-rich PNe is discarded, except in three objects, that\nshow C/O > 1. We also discuss the possibility of a He pre-enrichment to explain\nthe most He-enriched objects. We cannot discard other scenarios like extra\nmixing, stellar rotation or binary interactions to explain the chemical\nabundances behaviour observed in our sample.\n", "  The diffusion in the comb structures is a popular model of geometrically\ninduced anomalous diffusion. In the present work we concentrate on the\ndiffusion along the backbone in a system where sidebranches are planes, and the\ndiffusion thereon is anomalous and described by continuous time random walks\n(CTRW). We show that the mean squared displacement (MSD) in the backbone of the\ncomb behaves differently depending on whether the waiting time periods in the\nsidebranches are reset after the step in the backbone is done (a rejuvenating\njunction model), or not (a non-rejuvenating junction model). In the\nrejuvenating case the subdiffusion in the sidebranches only changes the\nprefactor in the ultra-slow (logarithmic) diffusion along the backbone, while\nin the non-rejuvenating case the ultraslow, logarithmic subdiffusion is changed\nto a much faster power-law subdiffusion (with a logarithmic correction) as it\nwas found earlier by Iomin and Mendez [Chaos Solitons and Fractals 2016;\n82:142]. Moreover, in the first case the result does not change if the\ndiffusion in the backbone is itself anomalous, while in the second case it\ndoes. Two of the special cases of the considered models (the non-rejuvenating\njunction under normal diffusion in the backbone, and rejuvenating junction for\nthe same waiting time distribution in the sidebranches and in junction points)\nwere also investigated within the approach based on the corresponding\ngeneralized Fokker-Planck equations.\n", "  Nanofiller particles, such as carbon nanotubes or metal wires, are used in\nfunctional polymer composites to make them conduct electricity. They are often\nnot perfectly straight cylinders, but may be tortuous or exhibit kinks.\nTherefore we investigate the effect of shape deformations of the rodlike\nnanofillers on the geometric percolation threshold of the dispersion. We do\nthis by using connectedness percolation theory within a Parsons-Lee type of\napproximation, in combination with Monte Carlo integration for the average\noverlap volume in the isotropic fluid phase. We find that a deviation from a\nperfect rodlike shape has very little effect on the percolation threshold,\nunless the particles are strongly deformed. This demonstrates that idealized\nrod models are useful even for nanofillers that superficially seem imperfect.\nIn addition, we show that for small or moderate rod deformations, the universal\nscaling of the percolation threshold is only weakly affected by the precise\nparticle shape.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) represents the most advanced facility\ndesigned for Cherenkov Astronomy. ASTRI SST-2M has been developed as a\ndemonstrator for the Small Size Telescope in the context of the upcoming CTA.\nIts main innovation consists in the optical layout which implements the\nSchwarzschild-Couder configuration and is fully validated for the first time.\nThe ASTRI SST-2M optical system represents the first qualified example for two\nmirrors telescope for Cherenkov Astronomy.\n  This configuration permits to (i) maintain a high optical quality across a\nlarge FoV (ii) de-magnify the plate scale, (iii) exploit new technological\nsolutions for focal plane sensors. The goal of the paper is to present the\noptical qualification of the ASTRI SST-2M telescope. The qualification has been\nobtained measuring the PSF sizes generated in the focal plane at various\ndistance from the optical axis. These values have been compared with the\nperformances expected by design.\n  After an introduction on the Gamma Astronomy from the ground, the optical\ndesign and how it has been implemented for ASTRI SST-2M is discussed. Moreover\nthe description of the setup used to qualify the telescope over the full field\nof view is shown.\n  We report the results of the first--light optical qualification. The required\nspecification of a flat PSF of $\\sim 10$ arcmin in a large field of view ~10\ndeg has been demonstrated. These results validate the design specifications,\nopening a new scenario for Cherenkov Gamma ray Astronomy and, in particular,\nfor the detection of high energy (5 - 300 TeV) gamma rays and wide-field\nobservations with CTA.\n", "  We present a photometric analysis of 65 galaxies in the rich cluster Abell\n1689 at $z=0.183$, using the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys\narchive images in the rest-frame $V$-band. We perform two-dimensional\nmulti-component photometric decomposition of each galaxy adopting different\nmodels of the surface-brightness distribution. We present an accurate\nmorphological classification for each of the sample galaxies. For 50 early-type\ngalaxies, we fit both a de Vaucouleurs and S\\'ersic law; S0s are modelled by\nalso including a disc component described by an exponential law. Bars of SB0s\nare described by the profile of a Ferrers ellipsoid. For the 15 spirals, we\nmodel a S\\'ersic bulge, exponential disc, and, when required, a Ferrers bar\ncomponent. We derive the Fundamental Plane by fitting 40 early-type galaxies in\nthe sample, using different surface-brightness distributions. We find that the\ntightest plane is that derived by S\\'ersic bulges. We find that bulges of\nspirals lie on the same relation. The Fundamental Plane is better defined by\nthe bulges alone rather than the entire galaxies. Comparison with local samples\nshows both an offset and rotation in the Fundamental Plane of Abell 1689.\n", "  The magnetic line ratio (MLR) method has been extensively used in the\nmeasurement of photospheric magnetic field strength. It was devised for the\nneutral iron line pair at 5247.1 A and 5250.2 A (5250 A pair). Other line pairs\nas well-suited as this pair been have not been reported in the literature. The\naim of the present work is to identify new line pairs useful for the MLR\ntechnique and to test their reliability. We use a three dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation representing the quiet Sun atmosphere to\nsynthesize the Stokes profiles. Then, we apply the MLR technique to the Stokes\nV profiles to recover the fields in the MHD cube both, at original resolution\nand after degrading with a point spread function. In both these cases, we aim\nto empirically represent the field strengths returned by the MLR method in\nterms of the field strengths in the MHD cube. We have identified two new line\npairs that are very well adapted to be used for MLR measurements. The first\npair is in the visible, Fe I 6820 A - 6842 A (whose intensity profiles have\nearlier been used to measure stellar magnetic fields), and the other is in the\ninfrared (IR), Fe I 15534 A - 15542 A. The lines in these pairs reproduce the\nmagnetic fields in the MHD cube rather well, partially better than the original\n5250 A pair. The newly identified line pairs complement the old pairs. The\nlines in the new IR pair, due to their higher Zeeman sensitivity, are ideal for\nthe measurement of weak fields. The new visible pair works best above 300 G.\nThe new IR pair, due to its large Stokes V signal samples more fields in the\nMHD cube than the old IR pair at $1.56\\,\\mu$m, even in the presence of noise,\nand hence likely also on the real Sun. Owing to their low formation heights\n(100-200 km above tau_5000=1), both the new line pairs are well suited for\nprobing magnetic fields in the lower photosphere.\n", "  From our sample of spotted late-type stars showing surface differential\nrotation we find that the relationship between the rotation period and the\nsurface shear coefficient $\\alpha=\\Delta\\Omega/\\Omega_{\\rm eq}$ is\nsignificantly different for single stars compared to members in close binaries.\nSingle stars follow a general trend that $\\alpha$ increases with the rotation\nperiod. However, differential rotation of stars in close binary systems shows\nmuch weaker dependence on the rotation, if any, suggesting that in such systems\ntidal forces operate as a controlling mechanism of differential rotation.\n", "  The Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld (EiBI) model is reformulated within the\nmimetic approach. In the presence of a mimetic field, the model contains\nnon-trivial vacuum solutions which could be free of spacetime singularity\nbecause of the Born-Infeld nature of the theory. We study a realistic\nprimordial vacuum universe and prove the existence of regular solutions, such\nas primordial inflationary solutions of de Sitter type or bouncing solutions.\nBesides, the linear instabilities present in the EiBI model are found to be\navoidable for some interesting bouncing solutions in which the physical metric\nas well as the auxiliary metric are regular at the background level.\n", "  We investigate the properties of a set of solar flares originating from a\nsingle active region (AR) that exhibit QPPs, and look for signs of the QPP\nperiods relating to AR properties. The AR studied, best known as NOAA 12192,\nwas unusually long-lived and produced 181 flares. Data from the GOES, EVE,\nFermi, Vernov and NoRH observatories were used to determine if QPPs were\npresent in the flares. For the soft X-ray GOES and EVE data, the time\nderivative of the signal was used. Power spectra of the time series data\n(without any form of detrending) were inspected, and flares with a peak above\nthe 95% confidence level in the spectrum were labelled as having candidate\nQPPs. The confidence levels were determined taking account of uncertainties and\nthe possible presence of red noise. AR properties were determined using HMI\nline of sight magnetograms. A total of 37 flares (20% of the sample) show good\nevidence of having QPPs, and some of the pulsations can be seen in data from\nmultiple instruments and in different wavebands. The QPP periods show a weak\ncorrelation with the flare amplitude and duration, but this may be due to an\nobservational bias. A stronger correlation was found between the QPP period and\nduration of the QPP signal, which can be partially but not entirely explained\nby observational constraints. No correlations were found with the AR area,\nbipole separation, or average magnetic field strength. The fact that a\nsubstantial fraction of the flare sample showed evidence of QPPs using a strict\ndetection method with minimal processing of the data demonstrates that these\nQPPs are a real phenomenon, which cannot be explained by the presence of red\nnoise or the superposition of multiple unrelated flares. The lack of\ncorrelation between the QPP periods and AR properties implies that the\nsmall-scale structure of the AR is important, and/or that different QPP\nmechanisms act in different cases.\n", "  When binary systems of neutron stars merge, a very small fraction of their\nrest mass is ejected, either dynamically or secularly. This material is\nneutron-rich and its nucleosynthesis could provide the astrophysical site for\nthe production of heavy elements in the universe, together with a kilonova\nsignal confirming neutron-star mergers as the origin of short gamma-ray bursts.\nWe perform full general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron-star mergers\nemploying three different nuclear-physics EOSs, considering both equal- and\nunequal-mass configurations, and adopting a leakage scheme to account for\nneutrino radiative losses. Using a combination of techniques, we carry out an\nextensive and systematic study of the hydrodynamical, thermodynamical, and\ngeometrical properties of the matter ejected dynamically, employing the WinNet\nnuclear-reaction network to recover the relative abundances of heavy elements\nproduced by each configurations. Among the results obtained, three are\nparticularly important. First, we find that both the properties of the\ndynamical ejecta and the nucleosynthesis yields are robust against variations\nof the EOS and masses, and match very well the observed chemical abundances.\nSecond, using a conservative but robust criterion for unbound matter, we find\nthat the amount of ejected mass is $\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\,M_{\\odot}$, hence at\nleast one order of magnitude smaller than what normally assumed in modelling\nkilonova signals. Finally, using a simplified and gray-opacity model we assess\nthe observability of the infrared kilonova emission finding, that for all\nbinaries the luminosity peaks around $\\sim1/2$ day in the $H$-band, reaching a\nmaximum magnitude of $-13$, and decreasing rapidly after one day. These rather\nlow luminosities make the prospects for detecting kilonovae less promising than\nwhat assumed so far.\n", "  The collision of black holes and the emission of gravitational radiation in\nhigher-dimensional spacetimes are of interest in various research areas,\nincluding the gauge-gravity duality, the TeV gravity scenarios evoked for the\nexplanation of the hierarchy problem, and the large-dimensionality limit of\ngeneral relativity. We present numerical simulations of head-on collisions of\nnonspinning, unequal-mass black holes starting from rest in general relativity\nwith $4 \\leq D\\leq 10$ spacetime dimensions. We compare the energy and linear\nmomentum radiated in gravitational waves with perturbative predictions in the\nextreme mass ratio limit, demonstrating the strength and limitations of\nblack-hole perturbation theory in this context.\n", "  Hot Jupiters (HJs) are short-period giant planets that are observed around ~\n1% of solar-type field stars. One possible formation scenario for HJs is\nhigh-eccentricity (high-e) migration, in which the planet forms at much larger\nradii, is excited to high eccentricity by some mechanism, and migrates to its\ncurrent orbit due to tidal dissipation occurring near periapsis. We consider\nhigh-e migration in dense stellar systems such as the cores of globular\nclusters (GCs), in which encounters with passing stars can excite planets to\nthe high eccentricities needed to initiate migration. We study this process via\nMonte Carlo simulations of encounters with a star+planet system including the\neffects of tidal dissipation, using an efficient regularized restricted\nthree-body code. HJs are produced in our simulations over a significant range\nof the stellar number density n_*. Assuming the planet is initially on a\nlow-eccentricity orbit with semimajor axis 1 au, for n_* < 1e3 pc^{-3} the\nencounter rate is too low to induce orbital migration, whereas for n_* > 1e6\npc^{-3} HJ formation is suppressed because the planet is more likely ejected\nfrom its host star, tidally disrupted, or transferred to a perturbing star. The\nfraction of planets that are converted to HJs peaks at ~ 2% for intermediate\nnumber densities of ~ 4e4 pc^{-3}. Warm Jupiters, giant planets with periods\nbetween 10 and 100 days, are produced in our simulations with an efficiency of\nup to ~ 0.5%. Our results suggest that HJs can form through high-e migration\ninduced by stellar encounters in the centers of of dense GCs, but not in their\noutskirts where the densities are lower.\n", "  Planetesimal formation stage represents a major gap in our understanding of\nthe planet formation process. The late-stage planet accretion models typically\nmake arbitrary assumptions about planetesimals and pebbles distribution while\nthe dust evolution models predict that planetesimal formation is only possible\nat some orbital distances. We want to test the importance of water snow line\nfor triggering formation of the first planetesimals during the gas-rich phase\nof protoplanetary disk, when cores of giant planets have to form. We connect\nprescriptions for gas disk evolution, dust growth and fragmentation, water ice\nevaporation and recondensation, as well as transport of both solids and water\nvapor, and planetesimal formation via streaming instability into a single,\none-dimensional model for protoplanetary disk evolution. We find that processes\ntaking place around the snow line facilitate planetesimal formation in two\nways. First, due to the change of sticking properties between wet and dry\naggregates, there is a \"traffic jam\" inside of the snow line that slows down\nthe fall of solids onto the star. Second, ice evaporation and outward diffusion\nof water followed by its recondensation increases the abundance of icy pebbles\nthat trigger planetesimal formation via streaming instability just outside of\nthe snow line. Planetesimal formation is hindered by growth barriers and radial\ndrift and thus requires particular conditions to take place. Snow line is a\nfavorable location where planetesimal formation is possible for a wide range of\nconditions, but still not in every protoplanetary disk model. This process is\nparticularly promoted in large, cool disks with low intrinsic turbulence and\nincreased initial dust-to-gas ratio.\n", "  Nanoscale magnetic skyrmions have interesting static and transport properties\nthat make them candidates for future spintronic devices. Control and\nmanipulation of the size and behavior of skyrmions is thus of crucial\nimportance. Using a Ginzburg-Landau approach, we show theoretically that\nskyrmions and skyrmion lattices can be stabilized by a spatial modulation of\nthe uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in a thin film of centro-symmetric\nferromagnet. Remarkably, the skyrmion size is determined by the ratio of the\nexchange length and the period of the spatial modulation of the anisotropy, at\nvariance with conventional skyrmions stabilized by dipolar and\nDzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions (DMIs).\n", "  Charged defects in 2D materials have emerging applications in quantum\ntechnologies such as quantum emitters and quantum computation. Advancement of\nthese technologies requires rational design of ideal defect centers, demanding\nreliable computation methods for quantitatively accurate prediction of defect\nproperties. We present an accurate, parameter-free and efficient procedure to\nevaluate quasiparticle defect states and thermodynamic charge transition levels\nof defects in 2D materials. Importantly, we solve critical issues that stem\nfrom the strongly anisotropic screening in 2D materials, that have so far\nprecluded accurate prediction of charge transition levels in these materials.\nUsing this procedure, we investigate various defects in monolayer hexagonal\nboron nitride (h-BN) for their charge transition levels, stable spin states and\noptical excitations. We identify $C_BN_V$ (nitrogen vacancy adjacent to carbon\nsubstitution of boron) to be the most promising defect candidate for scalable\nquantum bit and emitter applications.\n", "  In the era of vast spectroscopic surveys focusing on Galactic stellar\npopulations, astronomers want to exploit the large quantity and good quality of\ndata to derive their atmospheric parameters without losing precision from\nautomatic procedures. In this work, we developed a new spectral package, FASMA,\nto estimate the stellar atmospheric parameters (namely effective temperature,\nsurface gravity, and metallicity) in a fast and robust way. This method is\nsuitable for spectra of FGK-type stars in medium and high resolution. The\nspectroscopic analysis is based on the spectral synthesis technique using the\nradiative transfer code, MOOG. The line list is comprised of mainly iron lines\nin the optical spectrum. The atomic data are calibrated after the Sun and\nArcturus. We use two comparison samples to test our method, i) a sample of 451\nFGK-type dwarfs from the high resolution HARPS spectrograph, and ii) the\nGaia-ESO benchmark stars using both high and medium resolution spectra. We\nexplore biases in our method from the analysis of synthetic spectra covering\nthe parameter space of our interest. We show that our spectral package is able\nto provide reliable results for a wide range of stellar parameters, different\nrotational velocities, different instrumental resolutions, and for different\nspectral regions of the VLT-GIRAFFE spectrographs, used among others for the\nGaia-ESO survey. FASMA estimates stellar parameters in less than 15 min for\nhigh resolution and 3 min for medium resolution spectra. The complete package\nis publicly available to the community.\n", "  In this paper we study the direct CP asymmetry of the doubly\nCabibbo-suppressed decay mode $D^0 \\to K^+ \\pi^- $ within standard model and\ntwo Higgs doublet model with generic Yukawa structure. In the standard model we\nderive the corrections to the tree level amplitude, generated from the box and\ndi-penguin diagrams, required for generating the weak CP violating phases. We\nshow that these phases are so tiny leading to a direct CP asymmetry of order\n$10^{-9}$. Regarding the two Higgs doublet model with generic Yukawa structure\nwe derive the Wilson coefficients relevant to $D^0 \\to K^+ \\pi^- $. After\ntaking into account all constraints on the parameter space of the model we show\nthat charged Higgs couplings to quarks can lead to a direct CP asymmetry of\norder $10^{-3}$ which is $6$ orders of magnitude larger than the standard model\nprediction.\n", "  We present an exact solution in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity describing a\nspacetime with an anisotropic Kasner-type singularity and Lifshitz asymptotics.\nThis configuration can also be supported by a phantom scalar while still\nsatisfying the Null Energy Condition. For certain parameters of this solution,\nnull geodesics can have an infinitely deep effective potential, thus trapping\nphotons in a finite region along the radial direction. Some examples of\nperiodic null geodesics are obtained. A particularly interesting special case\nof this solution is a regular, soliton-type metric that retains its Lifshitz\nscaling in the time coordinate.\n", "  There exists a significant challenge in developing efficient magnetic tunnel\njunctions with low write currents for non-volatile memory devices. With the aim\nof analysing potential materials for efficient current-operated magnetic\njunctions we have developed a multi-scale methodology combining the ab initio\ncalculations of spin-transfer torque with large-scale time-dependent\nsimulations using atomistic spin dynamics. In this work we introduce our\nmulti-scale approach including a discussion on a number of possible mapping\nschemes the ab initio spin torques into the spin dynamics. We demonstrate this\nmethodology on a prototype Co/MgO/Co/Cu tunnel junction showing that the spin\ntorques are primarily acting at the interface between the Co free layer and\nMgO. Using spin dynamics we then calculate the reversal switching times for the\nfree layer and the critical voltages and currents required for such switching.\nOur work provides an efficient, accurate and versatile framework for designing\nnovel current-operated magnetic devices, where all the materials details are\ntake into account.\n", "  Aims. The aim of this work is to study the dynamical effects of the Galaxy on\nbinary star systems with physical and orbital charac- teristics similar to\nthose of the population of known wide binary stars with exoplanets. As\nsecondary goal we analyse the possible consequences on the stability of a\nhypothetical planetary system orbiting one of the stellar components. Methods.\nWe numerically reproduced the temporal evolution of a sample of 3 * 10 5 binary\nstar systems disturbed by the Galactic potential and passing stars in an\nenvironment similar to the solar neighbourhood. Results. Our results show that\nthe dynamical evolution of the population of wide binary stars with exoplanets\nin the solar neigh- bourhood is modelled by the process of disruption of binary\nstar systems induced by the Galaxy. We found that this process depends mainly\non the separation between both stars, whereas it is almost independent of the\ninitial orbital configuration. Moreover, our calcu- lations are in agreement\nwith the results of previous works regarding the indirect influence of the\nGalaxy on the stability of planetary systems in wide binary stars. However, the\neffects on the planetary region show a dependence on the initial configuration\nof binary stars. Finally, we obtain an indirect test of the impulse\napproximation model for dynamical studies of binary star systems.\n", "  We study the statistics of the lasing output from a single atom quantum heat\nengine, which was originally proposed by Scovil and Schulz-DuBois (SSDB). In\nthis heat engine model, a single three-level atom is strongly coupled with an\noptical cavity, and contacted with a hot and a cold heat bath together. We\nderive a fully quantum laser equation for this heat engine model, and obtain\nthe photon number distribution for both below and above the lasing threshold.\nWith the increase of the hot bath temperature, the population is inverted and\nlasing light comes out. However, we notice that if the hot bath temperature\nkeeps increasing, the atomic decay rate is also enhanced, which weakens the\nlasing gain. As a result, another critical point appears at a very high\ntemperature of the hot bath, after which the output light become thermal\nradiation again. To avoid this double-threshold behavior, we introduce a\nfour-level heat engine model, where the atomic decay rate does not depend on\nthe hot bath temperature. In this case, the lasing threshold is much easier to\nachieve, and the double-threshold behavior disappears.\n", "  The paradigm in which magnetic fields play a crucial role in\nlaunching/collimating outflows in many astrophysical objects continues to gain\nsupport. However, semi-analytical models including the effect of magnetic\nfields on the dynamics and morphology of jets are still missing due to the\nintrinsic difficulties in integrating the equations describing a collimated,\nrelativistic flow in the presence of gravity. Only few solutions have been\nfound so far, due to the highly nonlinear character of the equations together\nwith the need to blindly search for singularities. These numerical problems\nprevented a full exploration of the parameter space. We present a new\nintegration scheme to solve r-self-similar, stationary, axisymmetric\nmagnetohydrodynamics equations describing collimated, relativistic outflows\ncrossing smoothly all the singular points (Alfven point and modified slow/fast\npoints). For the first time, we are able to integrate from the disk mid-plane\nto downstream of the modified fast point. We discuss an ensemble of jet\nsolutions, emphasising trends and features that can be compared to observables.\nWe present, for the first time with a semi-analytical MHD model, solutions\nshowing counter-rotation of the jet for a substantial fraction of its extent.\nWe find diverse jet configurations with bulk Lorentz factors up to 10 and\npotential sites for recollimation between $10^3-10^7$ gravitational radii. Such\nextended coverage of the intervals of quantities, such as magnetic-to-thermal\nenergy ratios at the base or the heights/widths of the recollimation region,\nmakes our solutions suitable for application to many different systems where\njets are launched.\n", "  The influence of magnetic fields (B-fields) in the formation and evolution of\nbipolar bubbles, due to the expanding ionization fronts (I-fronts) driven by\nthe Hii regions that are formed and embedded in filamentary molecular clouds,\nhas not been well-studied yet. In addition to the anisotropic expansion of\nI-fronts into a filament, B-fields are expected to introduce an additional\nanisotropic pressure which might favor expansion and propagation of I-fronts to\nform a bipolar bubble. We present results based on near-infrared polarimetric\nobservations towards the central $\\sim$8'$\\times$8' area of the star-forming\nregion RCW57A which hosts an Hii region, a filament, and a bipolar bubble.\nPolarization measurements of 178 reddened background stars, out of the 919\ndetected sources in the JHKs-bands, reveal B-fields that thread perpendicular\nto the filament long axis. The B-fields exhibit an hour-glass morphology that\nclosely follows the structure of the bipolar bubble. The mean B-field strength,\nestimated using the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, is 91$\\pm$8 {\\mu}G. B-field\npressure dominates over turbulent and thermal pressures. Thermal pressure might\nact in the same orientation as those of B-fields to accelerate the expansion of\nthose I-fronts. The observed morphological correspondence among the B-fields,\nfilament, and bipolar bubble demonstrate that the B-fields are important to the\ncloud contraction that formed the filament, gravitational collapse and star\nformation in it, and in feedback processes. The latter include the formation\nand evolution of mid-infrared bubbles by means of B-field supported propagation\nand expansion of I-fronts. These may shed light on preexisting conditions\nfavoring the formation of the massive stellar cluster in RCW57A.\n", "  Magnetically-driven disk winds would alter the surface density slope of gas\nin the inner region of a protoplanetary disk $(r \\lesssim 1 {\\rm au})$. This in\nturn affects planet formation. Recently, the effect of disk wind torque has\nbeen considered with the suggestion that it would carve out the surface density\nof the disk from inside and would induce global gas flows (wind-driven\naccretion). We aim to investigate effects of global gas flows on type I\nmigration and also examine planet formation. A simplified approach was taken to\naddress this issue, and N-body simulations with isolation-mass planets were\nalso performed. In previous studies, the effect of gas flow induced by\nturbulence-driven accretion has been taken into account for its desaturation\neffect of the corotation torque. If more rapid gas flows (e.g., wind-driven\naccretion) are considered, the desaturation effect can be modified. In\nMRI-inactive disks, in which the wind-driven accretion dominates the disk\nevolution, the gas flow at the midplane plays an important role. If this flow\nis fast, the corotation torque is efficiently desaturated. Then, the fact that\nthe surface density slope can be positive in the inner region due to the wind\ntorque can generate an outward migration region extended to super-Earth mass\nplanets. In this case, we observe that no planets fall onto the central star in\nN-body simulations with migration forces imposed to reproduce such migration\npattern. We also see that super-Earth mass planets can undergo outward\nmigration. Relatively rapid gas flows affects type I migration and thus the\nformation of close-in planets.\n", "  Based on the rate of expansion of the solar wind, the plasma should cool\nrapidly as a function of distance to the Sun. Observations show this is not the\ncase. In this work, a magnetic pumping model is developed as a possible\nexplanation for the heating and the generation of power-law distribution\nfunctions observed in the solar wind plasma. Most previous studies in this area\nfocus on the role that the dissipation of turbulent energy on microscopic\nkinetic scales plays in the overall heating of the plasma. However, with\nmagnetic pumping particles are energized by the largest scale turbulent\nfluctuations, thus bypassing the energy cascade. In contrast to other models,\nwe include the pressure anisotropy term, providing a channel for the large\nscale fluctuations to heat the plasma directly. In this work a complete set of\ncoupled differential equations describing the evolution, and energization, of\nthe distribution function are derived, as well as an approximate closed form\nsolution. Numerical simulations using the VPIC kinetic code are applied to\nverify the model's analytical predictions. The results of the model for\nrealistic solar wind scenario are computed, where thermal streaming of\nparticles are important for generating a phase shift between the magnetic\nperturbations and the pressure anisotropy. In turn, averaged over a pump cycle,\nthe phase shift permits mechanical work to be converted directly to heat in the\nplasma. The results of this scenario show that magnetic pumping may account for\na significant portion of the solar wind energization.\n", "  Using the data samples of $(1310.6\\pm7.2 )\\times 10^{6}$ $J/\\psi$ events and\n$(448.1\\pm2.9)\\times 10^{6}$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII\ndetector, we search for the rare decays $J/\\psi \\to D^{0} e^{+}e^{-} +c.c.$ and\n$\\psi(3686) \\to D^{0} e^{+}e^{-} +c.c.$. No significant signals are observed\nand the corresponding upper limits on the branching fractions at the $90\\%$\nconfidence level are determined to be $Br(J/\\psi \\to D^{0} e^{+}e^{-} +c.c.)<\n8.5\\times 10^{-8}$ and $Br (\\psi(3686) \\to D^{0} e^{+}e^{-} +c.c.)<1.4\\times\n10^{-7}$, respectively. Our limit on $Br(J/\\psi \\to D^{0} e^{+}e^{-} +c.c.)$ is\nmore stringent by two orders of magnitude than the previous results, and the\n$Br(\\psi(3686) \\to D^{0} e^{+}e^{-} +c.c.)$ is measured for the first time.\n", "  Photometric time series of the $\\gamma$ Dor star 43 Cyg obtained with the\nBRITE-Constellation nano-satellites allow us to study its pulsational\nproperties in detail and to constrain its interior structure. We aim to find a\ng-mode period spacing pattern that allows us to determine the near-core\nrotation rate of 43 Cyg and redetermine the star's fundamental atmospheric\nparameters and chemical composition. We conducted a frequency analysis using\nthe 156-days long data set obtained with the BRITE-Toronto satellite and\nemployed a suite of MESA/GYRE models to derive the mode identification,\nasymptotic period spacing and near-core rotation rate. We also used\nhigh-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopic data obtained at the\n1.2m Mercator telescope with the HERMES spectrograph to redetermine the\nfundamental atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of 43 Cyg using the\nsoftware Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME). We detected 43 intrinsic pulsation\nfrequencies and identified 18 of them to be part of a period spacing pattern\nconsisting of prograde dipole modes with an asymptotic period spacing $\\Delta\n\\Pi_{l=1}$ of $2970^{+700}_{-570} \\rm s$. The near-core rotation rate was\ndetermined to be $f_{\\rm rot} = 0.56^{+0.12}_{-0.14}\\,\\rm d^{-1}$. The\natmosphere of 43 Cyg shows solar chemical composition at an effective\ntemperature of 7150 $\\pm$ 150 K, a log g of 4.2 $\\pm$ 0.6 dex and a projected\nrotational velocity, $v {\\rm sin}i$, of 44 $\\pm$ 4 kms$^{-1}$. The morphology\nof the observed period spacing patterns shows indications of the presence of a\nsignificant chemical gradient in the stellar interior.\n", "  We present the ionized gas properties of infrared (IR)-bright dust-obscured\ngalaxies (DOGs) that show an extreme optical/IR color, $(i - [22])_{\\rm AB} >\n7.0$, selected with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wide-field Infrared\nSurvey Explorer (WISE). For 36 IR-bright DOGs that show [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\nemission in the SDSS spectra, we performed a detailed spectral analysis to\ninvestigate their ionized gas properties. In particular, we measured the\nvelocity offset (the velocity with respect to the systemic velocity measured\nfrom the stellar absorption lines) and the velocity dispersion of the [OIII]\nline. We found that the derived velocity offset and dispersion of most\nIR-bright DOGs are larger than those of Seyfert 2 galaxies (Sy2s) at $z < 0.3$,\nmeaning that the IR-bright DOGs show relatively strong outflows compared to\nSy2s. This can be explained by the difference of IR luminosity contributed from\nactive galactic nucleus, $L_{\\rm IR}$ (AGN), because we found that (i) $L_{\\rm\nIR}$ (AGN) correlates with the velocity offset and dispersion of [OIII] and\n(ii) our IR-bright DOGs sample has larger $L_{\\rm IR}$ (AGN) than Sy2s.\nNevertheless, the fact that about 75% IR-bright DOGs have a large ($>$ 300 km\ns$^{-1}$) velocity dispersion, which is a larger fraction compared to other AGN\npopulations, suggests that IR-bright DOGs are good laboratories to investigate\nAGN feedback. The velocity offset and dispersion of [OIII] and\n[NeIII]$\\lambda$3869 are larger than those of [OII]$\\lambda$3727, which\nindicates that the highly ionized gas tends to show more stronger outflows.\n", "  The role of the cosmic web in shaping galaxy properties is investigated in\nthe GAMA spectroscopic survey in the redshift range $0.03 \\leq z \\leq 0.25$.\nThe stellar mass, $u - r$ dust corrected colour and specific star formation\nrate (sSFR) of galaxies are analysed as a function of their distances to the 3D\ncosmic web features, such as nodes, filaments and walls, as reconstructed by\nDisPerSE. Significant mass and type/colour gradients are found for the whole\npopulation, with more massive and/or passive galaxies being located closer to\nthe filament and wall than their less massive and/or star-forming counterparts.\nMass segregation persists among the star-forming population alone. The red\nfraction of galaxies increases when closing in on nodes, and on filaments\nregardless of the distance to nodes. Similarly, the star-forming population\nreddens (or lowers its sSFR) at fixed mass when closing in on filament,\nimplying that some quenching takes place. Comparable trends are also found in\nthe state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN. These results\nsuggest that on top of stellar mass and large-scale density, the traceless\ncomponent of the tides from the anisotropic large-scale environment also shapes\ngalactic properties. An extension of excursion theory accounting for\nfilamentary tides provides a qualitative explanation in terms of anisotropic\nassembly bias: at a given mass, the accretion rate varies with the orientation\nand distance to filaments. It also explains the absence of type/colour\ngradients in the data on smaller, non-linear scales.\n", "  We consider a helical system of fermions with a generic spin (or pseudospin)\norbit coupling. Using the equation of motion approach for the single-particle\ndistribution functions, and a mean-field decoupling of the higher order\ndistribution functions, we find a closed form for the charge and spin density\nfluctuations in terms of the charge and spin density linear response functions.\nApproximating the nonlocal exchange term with a Hubbard-like local-field\nfactor, we obtain coupled spin and charge density response matrix beyond the\nrandom phase approximation, whose poles give the dispersion of four collective\nspin-charge modes. We apply our generic technique to the well-explored\ntwo-dimensional system with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and illustrate how it\ngives results for the collective modes, Drude weight, and spin-Hall\nconductivity which are in very good agreement with the results obtained from\nother more sophisticated approaches.\n", "  We study Quadratic Inflation with the inflaton field $\\phi$ coupled\nnon-minimally to the curvature scalar $R$, so that the potential during\ninflation is of the form $V\\propto m^2\\phi^2+\\xi R\\phi^2$. We show that with a\nsuitable choice of the non-minimal coupling strength,\n$\\xi=\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, one can resurrect the success of the scenario when\ncompared against the Planck and BICEP2/Keck Array data, and that in the region\nof the parameter space which is still allowed the model predicts values of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.01\\leq r < 0.12$, making it possible to\neither confirm the scenario or rule it out already by the current or\nnear-future experiments, such as BICEP3 or LiteBIRD. However, we show that in\nthis case the near-future observations are unlikely to be able to distinguish\nbetween the metric and Palatini formulations of gravity.\n", "  We present the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Survey, a mosaic of nine MUSE fields\ncovering 90\\% of the entire HUDF region with a 10-hour deep exposure time, plus\na deeper 31-hour exposure in a single 1.15 arcmin2 field. The improved\nobserving strategy and advanced data reduction results in datacubes with\nsub-arcsecond spatial resolution (0.65 arcsec at 7000 A) and accurate\nastrometry (0.07 arcsec rms). We compare the broadband photometric properties\nof the datacubes to HST photometry, finding a good agreement in zeropoint up to\nmAB=28 but with an increasing scatter for faint objects. We have investigated\nthe noise properties and developed an empirical way to account for the impact\nof the correlation introduced by the 3D drizzle interpolation. The achieved 3\nsigma emission line detection limit for a point source is 1.5 and 3.1 10-19\nerg.s-1.cm-2 for the single ultra-deep datacube and the mosaic, respectively.\nWe extracted 6288 sources using an optimal extraction scheme that takes the\npublished HST source locations as prior. In parallel, we performed a blind\nsearch of emission line galaxies using an original method based on advanced\ntest statistics and filter matching. The blind search results in 1251 emission\nline galaxy candidates in the mosaic and 306 in the ultradeep datacube,\nincluding 72 sources without HST counterparts (mAB>31). In addition 88 sources\nmissed in the HST catalog but with clear HST counterparts were identified. This\ndata set is the deepest spectroscopic survey ever performed. In just over 100\nhours of integration time, it provides nearly an order of magnitude more\nspectroscopic redshifts compared to the data that has been accumulated on the\nUDF over the past decade. The depth and high quality of these datacubes enables\nnew and detailed studies of the physical properties of the galaxy population\nand their environments over a large redshift range.\n", "  We analyze the evolution of the dual AGN in ESO 509-IG066, a galaxy pair\nlocated at z=0.034 whose nuclei are separated by 11 kpc. Previous observations\nwith XMM-Newton on this dual AGN found evidence for two moderately obscured\n($N_H\\sim10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) X-ray luminous ($L_X\\sim10^{43}$ erg/s) nuclear\nsources. We present an analysis of subsequent Chandra, NuSTAR and Swift/XRT\nobservations that show one source has dropped in flux by a factor of 10 between\n2004 and 2011, which could be explained by either an increase in the absorbing\ncolumn or an intrinsic fading of the central engine possibly due to a decrease\nin mass accretion. Both of these scenarios are predicted by galaxy merger\nsimulations. The source which has dropped in flux is not detected by NuSTAR,\nwhich argues against absorption, unless it is extreme. However, new Keck/LRIS\noptical spectroscopy reveals a previously unreported broad H-alpha line which\nis highly unlikely to be visible under the extreme absorption scenario. We\ntherefore conclude that the black hole in this nucleus has undergone a dramatic\ndrop in accretion rate. From AO-assisted near-infrared integral-field\nspectroscopy of the other nucleus, we find evidence that the galaxy merger is\nhaving a direct effect on the kinematics of the gas close to the nucleus of the\ngalaxy, providing a direct observational link between the galaxy merger and the\nmass accretion rate on to the black hole.\n", "  We present interferometric and single-dish molecular line observations of the\ninterstellar bullet-outflow source IRAS 05506+2414, whose wide-angle bullet\nspray is similar to the Orion BN/KL explosive outflow and likely arises from an\nentirely different mechanism than the classical accretion-disk-driven bipolar\nflows in young stellar objects. The bullet-outflow source is associated with a\nlarge pseudo-disk and three molecular outflows -- a high-velocity outflow\n(HVO), a medium-velocity outflow (MVO), and a slow, extended outflow (SEO). The\nsize (mass) of the pseudo-disk is 10,350 AU x 6,400 AU (0.64-0.17 Msun); from a\nmodel-fit assuming infall and rotation we derive a central stellar mass of\n8--19 Msun. The HVO (MVO) has an angular size ~5180 (~3330) AU, and a projected\noutflow velocity of ~140 km/s (~30 km/s). The SEO size (outflow speed) is ~0.9\npc (~6 km/s). The HVO's axis is aligned with (orthogonal to) that of the SEO\n(pseudo-disk). The velocity structure of the MVO is unresolved. The scalar\nmomenta in the HVO and SEO are very similar, suggesting that the SEO has\nresulted from the HVO interacting with ambient cloud material. The bullet spray\nshares a common axis with the pseudo-disk, and has an age comparable to that of\nMVO (few hundred years), suggesting that these three structures are intimately\nlinked together. We discuss several models for the outflows in IRAS 05506+2414\n(including dynamical decay of a stellar cluster, chance encounter of a runaway\nstar with a dense cloud, and close passage of two protostars), and conclude\nthat 2nd-epoch imaging to derive proper motions of the bullets and nearby stars\ncan help to discriminate between them.\n", "  We show that the previously unreported ternary $\\sigma$-phase material\nNb$_{20.4}$Ru$_{5.7}$Ge$_{3.9}$ is a superconductor with a critical temperature\nof 2.2 K. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, resistance, and\nspecific heat measurements were used to characterize the superconducting\ntransition. The Sommerfeld constant $\\gamma$ for\nNb$_{20.4}$Ru$_{5.7}$Ge$_{3.9}$ is 91 mJ mol-f.u.$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ and the\nspecific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition,\n$\\Delta$C/$\\gamma$T$_c$, is approximately 1.38. The zero-temperature upper\ncritical field ($\\mu_0$H$_{c2}$(0)) was estimated to be 2 T by resistance data.\nField-dependent magnetization data analysis estimated $\\mu_0$H$_{c1}$(0) to be\n5.5 mT. Thus, the characterization shows Nb$_{20.4}$Ru$_{5.7}$Ge$_{3.9}$ to be\na type II BCS superconductor. This material appears to be the first reported\nternary phase in the Nb-Ru-Ge system, and the fact that there are no previously\nreported binary Nb-Ru, Nb-Ge, or Ru-Ge $\\sigma$-phases shows that all three\nelements are necessary to stabilize the material. A $\\sigma$-phase in the\nTa-Ru-Ge system was synthesized but did not display superconductivity above 1.7\nK, which suggests that electron count cannot govern the superconductivity\nobserved. Preliminary characterization of a possible superconducting\n$\\sigma$-phase in the Nb-Ru-Ga system is also reported.\n", "  We report on the detection and follow-up multi-wavelength observations of the\nnew X-ray transient MAXI J1807+132 with the MAXI/GSC, Swift, and ground-based\noptical telescopes. The source was first recognized with the MAXI/GSC on 2017\nMarch 13. About a week later, it reached the maximum intensity ($\\sim$10 mCrab\nin 2-10 keV), and then gradually faded in $\\sim$10 days by more than one order\nof magnitude. Time-averaged Swift/XRT spectra in the decaying phase can be\ndescribed by a blackbody with a relatively low temperature (0.1-0.5 keV), plus\na hard power-law component with a photon index of $\\sim$2. These spectral\nproperties are similar to those of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)\nin their dim periods. The blackbody temperature and the radius of the emission\nregion varied in a complex manner as the source became dimmer. The source was\ndetected in the optical wavelength on March 27-31 as well. The optical flux\ndecreased monotonically as the X-ray flux decayed. The correlation between the\nX-ray and optical fluxes is found to be consistent with those of known neutron\nstar LMXBs, supporting the idea that the source is likely to be a transient\nneutron star LMXB.\n", "  HARPS-N spectra with S/N > 250 and MARCS model atmospheres were used to\nderive abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y in ten\nstars from the Kepler LEGACY sample (including the binary pair 16 Cyg A and B)\nselected to have metallicities in the range -0.15 < [Fe/H] < +0.15 and ages\nbetween 1 and 7 Gyr. Stellar gravities were obtained from seismic data and\neffective temperatures were determined by comparing non-LTE iron abundances\nderived from FeI and FeII lines. Available non-LTE corrections were also\napplied when deriving abundances of the other elements. The results support the\n[X/Fe]-age relations previously found for solar twins. [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and\n[Zn/Fe] decrease by ~0.1 dex over the lifetime of the Galactic thin disk due to\ndelayed contribution of iron from Type Ia supernovae relative to prompt\nproduction of Mg, Al, and Zn in Type II supernovae. [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al], on the\nother hand, increase by ~0.3 dex, which can be explained by an increasing\ncontribution of s-process elements from low-mass AGB stars as time goes on. The\ntrends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] are more complicated due to variations of the ratio\nbetween refractory and volatile elements among stars of similar age. Two stars\nwith about the same age as the Sun show very different trends of [X/H] as a\nfunction of elemental condensation temperature Tc and for 16 Cyg, the two\ncomponents have an abundance difference, which increases with Tc. These\nanomalies may be connected to planet-star interactions.\n", "  Turbulence is the leading candidate for angular momentum transport in\nprotoplanetary disks and therefore influences disk lifetimes and planet\nformation timescales. However, the turbulent properties of protoplanetary disks\nare poorly constrained observationally. Recent studies have found turbulent\nspeeds smaller than what fully-developed MRI would produce (Flaherty et al.\n2015, 2017). However, existing studies assumed a constant CO/H2 ratio of 0.0001\nin locations where CO is not frozen-out or photo-dissociated. Our previous\nstudies of evolving disk chemistry indicate that CO is depleted by\nincorporation into complex organic molecules well inside the freeze-out radius\nof CO. We consider the effects of this chemical depletion on measurements of\nturbulence. Simon et al. (2015) suggested that the ratio of the peak line flux\nto the flux at line center of the CO J=3-2 transition is a reasonable\ndiagnostic of turbulence, so we focus on that metric, while adding some\nanalysis of the more complex effects on spatial distribution. We simulate the\nemission lines of CO based on chemical evolution models presented in Yu et al.\n(2016), and find that the peak-to-trough ratio changes as a function of time as\nCO is destroyed. Specifically, a CO-depleted disk with high turbulent velocity\nmimics the peak-to-trough ratios of a non-CO-depleted disk with lower turbulent\nvelocity. We suggest that disk observers and modelers take into account the\npossibility of CO depletion when using line peak-to-trough ratios to constrain\nthe degree of turbulence in disks. Assuming that CO/H2 = 0.0001 at all disk\nradii can lead to underestimates of turbulent speeds in the disk by at least\n0.2 km/s.\n", "  The Smith Purcell effect, observed when an electron beam passes in the\nvicinity of a periodic structure, is a promising platform for the generation of\nelectromagnetic radiation in previously-unreachable spectral ranges. However,\nmost of the studies of this radiation were performed on simple periodic\ngratings, whose radiation spectrum exhibits a single peak and its higher\nharmonics predicted by a well-established dispersion relation. Here, we propose\na method to shape the spatial and spectral far-field distribution of the\nradiation using complex periodic and aperiodic gratings. We show, theoretically\nand experimentally, that engineering multiple peak spectra with controlled\nwidths located at desired wavelengths is achievable using Smith-Purcell\nradiation. Our method opens the way to free-electron driven sources with\ntailored angular and spectral response, and gives rise to focusing\nfunctionality for spectral ranges where lenses are unavailable or inefficient.\n", "  We have conducted a two-layered spectroscopic survey (1'x1' ultra deep and\n3'x3' deep regions) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) with the Multi Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). The combination of a large field of view, high\nsensitivity, and wide wavelength coverage provides an order of magnitude\nimprovement in spectroscopically confirmed redshifts in the HUDF; i.e., 1206\nsecure spectroscopic redshifts for HST continuum selected objects, which\ncorresponds to 15% of the total (7904). The redshift distribution extends well\nbeyond z>3 and to HST/F775W magnitudes as faint as ~30 mag (AB, 1-sigma). In\naddition, 132 secure redshifts were obtained for sources with no HST\ncounterparts that were discovered in the MUSE data cubes by a blind search for\nemission-line features. In total, we present 1338 high quality redshifts, which\nis a factor of eight increase compared with the previously known spectroscopic\nredshifts in the same field. We assessed redshifts mainly with the spectral\nfeatures [OII] at z<1.5 (473 objects) and Lya at 2.9<z<6.7 (692 objects). With\nrespect to F775W magnitude, a 50% completeness is reached at 26.5 mag for ultra\ndeep and 25.5 mag for deep fields, and the completeness remains >~20% up to\n28-29 mag and ~27 mag, respectively. We used the determined redshifts to test\ncontinuum color selection (dropout) diagrams of high-z galaxies. The selection\ncondition for F336W dropouts successfully captures ~80% of the targeted z~2.7\ngalaxies. However, for higher redshift selections (F435W, F606W, and F775W\ndropouts), the success rates decrease to ~20-40%. We empirically redefine the\nselection boundaries to make an attempt to improve them to ~60%. The revised\nboundaries allow bluer colors that capture Lya emitters with high Lya\nequivalent widths falling in the broadbands used for the color-color selection.\nAlong with this paper, we release the redshift and line flux catalog.\n", "  Formation of the triangular skyrmion-lattice is found in a tetragonal polar\nmagnet VOSe$_2$O$_5$. By magnetization and small-angle neutron scattering\nmeasurements on the single crystals, we identify a cycloidal spin state at zero\nfield and a N\\'eel-type skyrmion-lattice phase under a magnetic field along the\npolar axis. Adjacent to this phase, another magnetic phase of an incommensurate\nspin texture is identified at lower temperatures, tentatively assigned to a\nsquare skyrmion-lattice phase. These findings exemplify the versatile features\nof N\\'eel-type skyrmions in bulk materials, and provide a unique occasion to\nexplore the physics of topological spin textures in polar magnets.\n", "  It is widely believed that the cool gas clouds traced by MgII absorption,\nwithin a velocity offset of 5000 km/s relative to the background quasar are\nmostly associated with the quasar itself, whereas the absorbers seen at larger\nvelocity offsets towards us are intervening absorber systems and hence their\nexistence is completely independent of the background quasar. Recent evidence\nby Bergeron et al. (2011, hereinafter BBM) has seriously questioned this\nparadigm, by showing that the number density of intervening MgII absorbers\ntowards the 45 blazars in their sample is nearly 2 times the expectation based\non the MgII absorption systems seen towards normal QSOs. Given its serious\nimplications, it becomes important to revisit this finding, by enlarging the\nblazar sample and subjecting it to an independent analysis. Here, we first\nreport the outcome of our re-analysis of the available spectroscopic data for\nthe BBM sample itself. Our analysis of the BBM sample reproduces their claimed\nfactor of 2 excess of dN/dz along blazar sightlines, vis-a-vis normal QSOs. We\nhave also assembled a ~3 times larger sample of blazars, albeit with moderately\nsensitive optical spectra. Using this sample together with the BBM sample, our\nanalysis shows that the dN/dz of the MgII absorbers statistically matches that\nknown for normal QSO sightlines. Further, the analysis indicates that\nassociated absorbers might be contributing significantly to the estimated dN/dz\nupto offset speeds \\Delta v ~0.2c relative to the blazar.\n", "  We report direct evidence of pre-processing of the galaxies residing in\ngalaxy groups falling into galaxy clusters drawn from the Local Cluster\nSubstructure Survey (LoCuSS). 34 groups have been identified via their X-ray\nemission in the infall regions of 23 massive ($\\rm \\langle M_{200}\\rangle =\n10^{15}\\,M_{\\odot}$) clusters at $0.15<z<0.3$. Highly complete spectroscopic\ncoverage combined with 24 $\\rm\\mu$m imaging from Spitzer allows us to make a\nconsistent and robust selection of cluster and group members including star\nforming galaxies down to a stellar mass limit of $\\rm M_{\\star} =\n2\\times10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$. The fraction $\\rm f_{SF}$ of star forming galaxies\nin infalling groups is lower and with a flatter trend with respect to\nclustercentric radius when compared to the rest of the cluster galaxy\npopulation. At $\\rm R\\approx1.3\\,r_{200}$ the fraction of star forming galaxies\nin infalling groups is half that in the cluster galaxy population. This is\ndirect evidence that star formation quenching is effective in galaxies already\nprior to them settling in the cluster potential, and that groups are favourable\nlocations for this process.\n", "  We update the experimental moments for the charm quark as computed in\narXiv:hep-ph/0702103. and used in arXiv:0907.2110 and arXiv:1010.6157 for the\ndetermination of the charm-quark mass. The new value for the MSbar charm-quark\nmass reads mc(3GeV)=0.993+/-0.008 GeV.\n", "  Stars with hot Jupiters have obliquities ranging from 0-180 degrees, but\nrelatively little is known about the obliquities of stars with smaller planets.\nUsing data from the California-Kepler Survey, we investigate the obliquities of\nstars with planets spanning a wide range of sizes, most of which are smaller\nthan Neptune. First, we identify 156 planet hosts for which measurements of the\nprojected rotation velocity (vsini) and rotation period are both available. By\ncombining estimates of v and vsini, we find nearly all the stars to be\ncompatible with high inclination, and hence, low obliquity (less than about 20\ndegrees). Second, we focus on a sample of 159 hot stars (> 6000K) for which\nvsini is available but not necessarily the rotation period. We find 6 stars for\nwhich vsini is anomalously low, an indicator of high obliquity. Half of these\nhave hot Jupiters, even though only 3% of the stars that were searched have hot\nJupiters. We also compare the vsini distribution of the hot stars with planets\nto that of 83 control stars selected without prior knowledge of planets. The\nmean vsini of the control stars is lower than that of the planet hosts by a\nfactor of approximately pi/4, as one would expect if the planet hosts have low\nobliquities. All these findings suggest that the Kepler planet-hosting stars\ngenerally have low obliquities, with the exception of hot stars with hot\nJupiters.\n", "  The effective temperature, one of the most fundamental atmospheric parameters\nof a star, can be estimated using various methods, and here we focus on the\nmethod using line-depth ratios (LDRs). This method combines low- and\nhigh-excitation lines and makes use of relations between LDRs of these line\npairs and the effective temperature. It has an advantage, for example, of being\nminimally affected by interstellar reddening, which changes stellar colours. We\nreport 81 relations between LDRs and the effective temperature established with\nhigh-resolution, $\\lambda /\\Delta \\lambda \\sim 28,000$, spectra of nine G- to\nM-type giants in Y and J bands. Our analysis gives the first comprehensive set\nof LDR relations for this wavelength range. The combination of all these\nrelations can be used to determine the effective temperatures of stars that\nhave 3700<Teff<5400K and -0.5<[Fe/H]<+0.3dex to the precision of $\\pm $10K in\nthe best cases.\n", "  A significant fraction of main sequence stars are part of a triple system. We\nstudy the long-term stability and dynamical outcomes of triple stellar systems\nusing a large number of long-term direct N-body integrations with relativistic\nprecession. We find that the previously proposed stability criteria by Eggleton\n& Kiseleva 1995 and Mardling & Aarseth 2001 predict the stability against\nejections reasonably well for a wide range of parameters. Assuming that the\ntriple stellar systems follow orbital and mass distributions from FGK binary\nstars in the field, we find that in ~1% and ~0.5% of the triple systems lead to\na direct head-on collision (impact velocity ~ escape velocity) between main\nsequence (MS) stars and between a MS star and a stellar-mass compact object,\nrespectively. We conclude that triple interactions are the dominant channel for\ndirect collisions involving a MS star in the field with a rate of one event\nevery ~100 years in the Milky Way. We estimate that the fraction of triple\nsystems that forms short-period binaries is up to ~23% with only up to ~13%\nbeing the result of three-body interactions with tidal dissipation, which is\nconsistent with previous work using a secular code.\n", "  We present 12 new transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-46b obtained\nwith the 1.54-m telescope at Estaci\\'on Astrof\\'isica de Bosque Alegre (EABA,\nArgentina) and the 0.40-m Horacio Ghielmetti and 2.15-m Jorge Sahade telescopes\nat Complejo Astron\\'omico El Leoncito (CASLEO, Argentina). We analyse them\ntogether with 37 light curves from the literature to re-determine the physical\nparameters and search for additional planets via transit timing variations\n(TTVs). We consider the 31 transits with uncertainties in their mid-transit\ntimes ($e_\\mathrm{T_{0}}$) $<$ 1 minute, to perform the first homogeneous study\nof TTVs for the system, finding a dispersion of $\\sigma= 1.66$ minutes over a 6\nyear baseline. Since no periodic variations are found, our interpretation for\nthis relatively high value of $\\sigma$ is that the stellar activity could be\naffecting the measured mid-transit times. This value of dispersion allows us to\nrule out the presence of additional bodies with masses larger than 2.3, 4.6, 7,\nand 9.3 $M_{\\mathrm{\\bigoplus}}$ at the first-order mean-motion resonances 2:1,\n3:2, 4:3, and 5:4 with the transiting planet, respectively. Despite the 6 year\nbaseline and a typical light curve precision of $2 \\times 10^{-3}$, we find\nthat we cannot significantly demonstrate a slow decrease of the orbital period\nof WASP-46b. We place a lower limit of Q$_{\\star}$ > $7 \\times 10^{3}$ on the\ntidal quality factor and determine that an additional 6 year baseline is\nrequired to rule out Q$_{\\star}$ < $10^{5}$.\n", "  The Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0419-577 hosts a $\\sim$kpc extended outflow that is\nevident in the [\\ion{O}{iii}] image and that is also detected as a warm\nabsorber in the UV/X-ray spectrum. Here, we analyze a $\\sim$30 ks Chandra-ACIS\nX-ray image, with the aim of resolving the diffuse extranuclear X-ray emission\nand of investigating its relationship with the galactic outflow. Thanks to its\nsub-arcsecond spatial resolution, Chandra resolves the circumnuclear X-ray\nemission, which extends up to a projected distance of at least $\\sim$16 kpc\nfrom the center. The morphology of the diffuse X-ray emission is spherically\nsymmetrical. We could not recover a morphological resemblance between the soft\nX-ray emission and the ionization bicone that is traced by the [\\ion{O}{iii}]\noutflow. we argue that the photoionized gas nebula must be distributed mostly\nalong the polar directions, outside our line of sight. In this geometry, the\nX-ray/UV warm absorber must trace a different gas component, physically\ndisconnected from the emitting gas, and located closer to the equatorial plane.\n", "  The dynamic activity in massive star forming regions prior to the formation\nof bright protostars is still not fully investigated. In this work we present\nobservations of HCO+ J=1-0 and N2H+ J=1-0 made with the IRAM 30m telescope\ntowards a sample of 16 Herschel-identified massive 70 micron quiet clumps\nassociated with infrared dark clouds. The clumps span a mass range from 300\nM_sun to 2000 M_sun. The N2H+ data show that the regions have significant\nnon-thermal motions with velocity dispersion between 0.28 km s^-1 and 1.5 km\ns^-1, corresponding to Mach numbers between 2.6 and 11.5. The majority of the\n70 micron quiet clumps have asymmetric HCO+ line profiles, indicative of\nsignificant dynamical activity. We show that there is a correlation between the\ndegree of line asymmetry and the surface density Sigma of the clumps, with\nclumps of Sigma>=0.1 g cm^-2 having more asymmetric line profiles, and so are\nmore dynamically active, than clumps with lower Sigma. We explore the\nrelationship between velocity dispersion, radius and Sigma and show how it can\nbe interpreted as a relationship between an acceleration generated by the\ngravitational field a_G, and the measured kinetic acceleration, a_k, consistent\nwith the majority of the non-thermal motions originating from self-gravity.\nFinally, we consider the role of external pressure and magnetic fields in the\ninterplay of forces.\n", "  Spinning small silicate grains were recently invoked to account for the\nGalactic foreground anomalous microwave emission. These grains, if present,\nwill absorb starlight in the far ultraviolet (UV). There is also renewed\ninterest in attributing the enigmatic 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction\nbump to small silicates. To probe the role of silicon in the UV extinction, we\nexplore the relations between the amount of silicon required to be locked up in\nsilicates [Si/H]_{dust} and the 2175 Angstrom bump or the far-UV extinction\nrise, based on an analysis of the extinction curves along 46 Galactic\nsightlines for which the gas-phase silicon abundance [Si/H]_{gas} is known. We\nderive [Si/H]_{dust} either from {[Si/H]_{ISM} - [Si/H]_{gas}} or from the\nKramers-Kronig relation which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to\nthe total dust volume, where [Si/H]_{ISM} is the interstellar silicon reference\nabundance and taken to be that of proto-Sun or B stars. We also derive\n[Si/H]_{dust} from fitting the observed extinction curves with a mixture of\namorphous silicates and graphitic grains. We find that in all three cases\n[Si/H]_{dust} shows no correlation with the 2175 Angstrom bump, while the\ncarbon depletion [C/H]_{dust} tends to correlate with the 2175 Angstrom bump.\nThis supports carbon grains instead of silicates as the possible carrier of the\n2175 Angstrom bump. We also find that neither [Si/H]_{dust} nor [C/H]_{dust}\nalone correlates with the far-UV extinction, suggesting that the far-UV\nextinction is a combined effect of small carbon grains and silicates.\n", "  Deep exposure imaging of early-type galaxies (ETGs) are revealing the\nsecond-order complexity of these objects, which have been long considered\nuniform, dispersion-supported spheroidals. \"Fine structure\" features (e.g.\nripples, plumes, tidal tails, rings) as well as depleted stellar cores (i.e.\ncentral light deficits) characterize a number of massive ETG galaxies, and can\nbe interpreted as the result of galaxy-galaxy interactions. We discuss how the\ntimescale for the evolution of cores and fine structures are comparable, and\nhence it is expected that they develop in parallel after the major interaction\nevent which shaped the ETG. Using archival data, we compare the \"depleted\nstellar mass\" (i.e. the mass missing from the depleted stellar core) against\nthe prominence of the fine structure features, and observe that they correlate\ninversely. This result confirms our expectation that, while the Super Massive\nBlack Hole (SMBH) binary (constituted by the SMBHs of the merger progenitors)\nexcavates the core via three-body interactions, the gravitational potential of\nthe newborn galaxy relaxes, and the fine structures fade below detection\nlevels. We expect the inverse correlation to hold at least within the first Gyr\nfrom the merger which created the SMBH binary; after then, the fine structure\nevolves independently.\n", "  We construct average spectra of host galaxies of slower, faster, bluer, and\nredder Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from the SDSS-II supernova survey. The\naverage spectrum of slower declining (broader light-curve width or higher\nstretch) SN Ia hosts shows stronger emission lines compared to the average\nspectrum of faster declining (narrower light-curve width or lower stretch) SN\nIa hosts. Using pPXF, we find that hosts of slower declining SNe Ia have\nmetallicities that are, on average, 0.24 dex lower than average metallicities\nof faster declining SN Ia hosts. Similarly, redder SN Ia hosts have slightly\nhigher metallicities than bluer SN Ia hosts. Lick index analysis of metallic\nlines and Balmer lines show that faster declining SN Ia hosts have relatively\nhigher metal content and have relatively older stellar populations compared\nwith slower declining SN Ia hosts. We calculate average $\\rm H_{\\alpha}$ Star\nFormation Rate (SFR), stellar mass, and the specific-SFR (sSFR) of host\ngalaxies in these subgroups of SNe Ia. We find that slower declining SN Ia\nhosts have significantly higher ($>5\\sigma$) sSFR than faster declining SN Ia\nhosts. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that these two types of hosts originate\nfrom different parent distributions. Our results, when compared with the models\nof \\cite{childress14}, indicate that slower declining SNe Ia, being hosted in\nactively star-forming galaxies, are young (prompt) SNe Ia, originating from\nsimilar progenitor age groups.\n", "  The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) detected, on 2017 August 17, an\nexceptional gravitational-wave (GW) event temporally consistent within\n$\\sim\\,1.7 \\, \\rm s$ with the GRB 1708117A observed by Fermi-GBM and INTEGRAL.\nThe event turns out to be compatible with a neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS)\ncoalescence that subsequently produced a radio/optical/X-ray transient detected\nat later times. We report the main results of the observations by the AGILE\nsatellite of the GW170817 localization region (LR) and its electromagnetic\n(e.m.) counterpart. At the LVC detection time $T_0$, the GW170817 LR was\nocculted by the Earth. The AGILE instrument collected useful data before and\nafter the GW-GRB event because in its spinning observation mode it can scan a\ngiven source many times per hour. The earliest exposure of the GW170817 LR by\nthe gamma-ray imaging detector (GRID) started about 935 s after $T_0$. No\nsignificant X-ray or gamma-ray emission was detected from the LR that was\nrepeatedly exposed over timescales of minutes, hours, and days before and after\nGW170817, also considering Mini-calorimeter and Super-AGILE data. Our\nmeasurements are among the earliest ones obtained by space satellites on\nGW170817 and provide useful constraints on the precursor and delayed emission\nproperties of the NS-NS coalescence event. We can exclude with high confidence\nthe existence of an X-ray/gamma-ray emitting magnetar-like object with a large\nmagnetic field of $10^{15} \\, \\rm G$. Our data are particularly significant\nduring the early stage of evolution of the e.m. remnant.\n", "  Star-forming Compact Dwarf Galaxies (CDGs) resemble the expected pristine\nconditions of the first galaxies in the Universe and are the best systems to\ntest models on primordial galaxy formation and evolution. Here we report on one\nof such CDGs, Tololo 1214-277, which presents a broad, single peaked, highly\nsymmetric Ly$\\alpha$ emission line that had evaded theoretical interpretation\nso far. In this paper we reproduce for the first time these line features with\ntwo different physically motivated kinematic models: an interstellar medium\ncomposed by outflowing clumps with random motions and an homogeneous gaseous\nsphere undergoing solid body rotation. The multiphase model requires a clump\nvelocity dispersion of $54.3\\pm 0.6$ km s$^{-1}$ with outflows of $54.3\\pm 5.1$\nkm s$^{-1}$, while the bulk rotation velocity is constrained to be\n$348^{+75}_{-48}$ km s$^{-1}$. We argue that the results from the multiphase\nmodel provide a correct interpretation of the data. In that case the clump\nvelocity dispersion implies a dynamical mass of $2\\times 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$,\nten times its baryonic mass. If future kinematic maps of Tololo 1214-277\nconfirm the velocities suggested by the multiphase model, it would provide\nadditional support to expect such kinematic state in primordial galaxies,\nopening the opportunity to use the models and methods presented in this paper\nto constrain the physics of star formation and feedback in the early generation\nof Ly-$\\alpha$ emitting galaxies.\n", "  In Debattista et al. (2015), we proposed that a kiloparsec-scale nuclear disc\nis responsible for the high-velocity secondary peak in the stellar\nline-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) seen at positive longitudes in\nthe bulge by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment\n(APOGEE). Here, we make further qualitative but distinctive predictions of the\nkinematic properties of a nuclear disc, including for the LOSVDs at negative\nlongitudes (which APOGEE-2 will observe) and examine the proper motions\nthroughout the disc. Since a nuclear ring is also able to produce similar\nhigh-velocity LOSVD peaks, we present predictions for the proper motion\nsignatures which distinguish between a nuclear disc and a nuclear ring. We also\ndemonstrate that the stars in a nuclear disc, which would be on x2 orbits\nperpendicular to the bar, can remain on these orbits for a long time and can\ntherefore be old. We show that such (old) nuclear discs of comparable size\nexist in external galaxies.\n", "  The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observatories recently discovered\ngravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral. A short gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) that followed the merger of this binary was also recorded by the\nFermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and the Anticoincidence Shield for\nthe Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory\n(INTEGRAL), indicating particle acceleration by the source. The precise\nlocation of the event was determined by optical detections of emission\nfollowing the merger. We searched for high-energy neutrinos from the merger in\nthe GeV--EeV energy range using the ANTARES, IceCube, and Pierre Auger\nObservatories. No neutrinos directionally coincident with the source were\ndetected within $\\pm500$ s around the merger time. Additionally, no MeV\nneutrino burst signal was detected coincident with the merger. We further\ncarried out an extended search in the direction of the source for high-energy\nneutrinos within the 14-day period following the merger, but found no evidence\nof emission. We used these results to probe dissipation mechanisms in\nrelativistic outflows driven by the binary neutron star merger. The\nnon-detection is consistent with model predictions of short GRBs observed at a\nlarge off-axis angle.\n", "  Very recently, the gravitational-wave (GW) event GW170817 was discovered to\nbe associated with the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 170817A. Multi-wavelength\nfollow-up observations were carried out, and X-ray, optical, and radio\ncounterparts to GW170817 were detected. The observations undoubtedly indicate\nthat GRB 170817A originates from a binary neutron star merger. However, the GRB\nfalls into the low-luminosity class that could have a higher statistical\noccurrence rate and detection probability than the normal (high-luminosity)\nclass. This implies the possibility that GRB 170817A is intrinsically powerful,\nbut we are off-axis and only observe its side emission. In this Letter, we\nprovide a timely modeling of the multi-wavelength afterglow emission from this\nGRB and the associated kilonova signal from the merger ejecta, under the\nassumption of a structured jet, a two-component jet, and an intrinsically\nless-energetic quasi-isotropic fireball, respectively. Comparing the afterglow\nproperties with the multi-wavelength follow-up observations, we can distinguish\nbetween these three models. Furthermore, a few model parameters (e.g., the\nejecta mass and velocity) can be constrained.\n", "  Planets are born in protostellar disks, which are now observed with enough\nresolution to address questions about internal gas flows. Candidates for\ndriving the flows include magnetic forces, but ionization state estimates\nsuggest much of the gas mass decouples from magnetic fields. Thus,\nhydrodynamical instabilities could play a major role. We investigate disk\ndynamics under conditions typical for a T Tauri system, using global 3D\nradiation hydrodynamics simulations with embedded particles and a resolution of\n70 cells per scale height. Stellar irradiation heating is included with\nrealistic dust opacities. The disk starts in joint radiative balance and\nhydrostatic equilibrium. The vertical shear instability (VSI) develops into\nturbulence that persists up to at least 1600 inner orbits (143 outer orbits).\nTurbulent speeds are a few percent of the local sound speed at the midplane,\nincreasing to 20%, or 100 m/s, in the corona. These are consistent with recent\nupper limits on turbulent speeds from optically thin and thick molecular line\nobservations of TW Hya and HD 163296. The predominantly vertical motions\ninduced by the VSI efficiently lift particles upwards. Grains 0.1 and 1 mm in\nsize achieve scale heights greater than expected in isotropic turbulence. We\nconclude that while kinematic constraints from molecular line emission do not\ndirectly discriminate between magnetic and nonmagnetic disk models, the small\ndust scale heights measured in HL Tau and HD 163296 favor turbulent magnetic\nmodels, which reach lower ratios of the vertical kinetic energy density to the\naccretion stress.\n", "  We study the behavior of dark energy (DE) in the scope of anisotropic Bianchi\ntype V (BV) space-time. First we derive Friedmann-Like Equations, then we\ncompare the dark energy equation of state (EoS) parameter for viscous and\nnon-viscous dark energy and make a correspondence between DE and quintessence\nand phantom descriptions of non-viscous and viscous dark energy and reconstruct\nthe potential of these two scalar fields. The late time behavior of EoS\nparameter through a thermodynamical study has also been investigated. Finally,\nwe investigate the conditions under which BV space-time can be mapped into the\nFRW and how the bulk viscose coefficient may affect dark energy EoS parameter\nof our $\\omega\\mbox{BV}$ Model with constraints from 28 Hubble parameter,\n$H(z)$, measurements at intermediate redshifts $0.07\\leq z\\leq 2.3$.\n", "  We obtain scatter broadened images of the Crab Nebula at 80 MHz as it\ntransits through the inner solar wind in June 2016 and 2017. These images are\nanisotropic, with the major axis oriented perpendicular to the radially outward\ncoronal magnetic field. Using these data, we deduce that the density modulation\nindex (\\delta N_e/N_e) caused by turbulent density fluctuations in the solar\nwind ranges from 1.9 \\times 10^{-3} to 7.7 \\times 10^{-3} between 9-20\nR_{\\odot}. We also find that the heating rate of solar wind protons at these\ndistances ranges from 2.2 \\times 10^{-13} to 1.0 \\times 10^{-11}\n~erg~cm^{-3}~s^{-1}. On two occasions, the line of sight intercepted a coronal\nstreamer. We find that the presence of the streamer approximately doubles the\nthickness of the scattering screen.\n", "  Many asteroid databases with lightcurve brightness measurements (e.g. WISE,\nPan-STARRS1) contain enormous amounts of data for asteroid shape and spin\nmodelling. While lightcurve inversion is not plausible for individual targets\nwith scarce data, it is possible for large populations with thousands of\nasteroids, where the distributions of the shape and spin characteristics of the\npopulations are obtainable.\n  We aim to introduce a software implementation of a method that computes the\njoint shape elongation p and spin latitude beta distributions for a population,\nwith the brightness observations given in an asteroid database. Other main\ngoals are to include a method for performing validity checks of the algorithm,\nand a tool for a statistical comparison of populations.\n  The LEADER software package read the brightness measurement data for a\nuser-defined subpopulation from a given database. The observations were used to\ncompute estimates of the brightness variations of the population members. A\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) was constructed of these estimates. A\nsuperposition of known analytical basis functions yielded this CDF as a\nfunction of the (shape, spin) distribution. The joint distribution can be\nreconstructed by solving a linear constrained inverse problem. To test the\nvalidity of the method, the algorithm can be run with synthetic asteroid\nmodels, where the shape and spin characteristics are known, and by using the\ngeometries taken from the examined database.\n  LEADER is a fast and robust software package for solving shape and spin\ndistributions for large populations. There are major differences in the quality\nand coverage of measurements depending on the database used, so synthetic\nsimulations are always necessary before a database can be reliably used. We\nshow examples of differences in the results when switching to another database.\n", "  The C III] 1907,1909 emission doublet has been proposed as an alternative to\nLyman-alpha in redshift confirmations of galaxies at z > 6 since it is not\nattenuated by the largely neutral intergalactic medium at these redshifts and\nis believed to be strong in the young, vigorously star-forming galaxies present\nat these early cosmic times. We present a statistical sample of 17 C\nIII]-emitting galaxies beyond z~1.5 using 30 hour deep VLT/MUSE integral field\nspectroscopy covering 2 square arcminutes in the Hubble Deep Field South (HDFS)\nand Ultra Deep Field (UDF), achieving C III] sensitivities of ~2e-17 erg/s/cm^2\nin the HDFS and ~7e-18 erg/s/cm^2 in the UDF. The rest-frame equivalent widths\nrange from 2 to 19 Angstroms. These 17 galaxies represent ~3% of the total\nsample of galaxies found between 1.5 < z < 4. They also show elevated star\nformation rates, lower dust attenuation, and younger mass-weighted ages than\nthe general population of galaxies at the same redshifts. Combined with deep\nslitless grism spectroscopy from the HST/WFC3 in the UDF, we can tie the\nrest-frame ultraviolet C III] emission to rest-frame optical emission lines,\nnamely [O III] 5007, finding a strong correlation between the two. Down to the\nflux limits that we observe (~1e-18 erg/s/cm^2 with the grism data in the UDF),\nall objects with a rest-frame [O III] 4959,5007 equivalent width in excess of\n250 Angstroms, the so-called Extreme Emission Line Galaxies, have detections of\nC III] in our MUSE data. More detailed studies of the C III]-emitting\npopulation at these intermediate redshifts will be crucial to understand the\nphysical conditions in galaxies at early cosmic times and to determine the\nutility of C III] as a redshift tracer.\n", "  We present deep, wide-field Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry of two\nrecently discovered satellites of the Milky Way (MW): Columba I and Triangulum\nII. The color magnitude diagrams of both objects point to exclusively old and\nmetal-poor stellar populations. We re-derive structural parameters and\nluminosities of these satellites, and find $M_{\\rm V, Col~I} = -4.2\\pm0.2$ for\nCol I and $M_{\\rm V, Tri~II} = -1.2\\pm0.4$ for Tri II, with corresponding\nhalf-light radii of $r_{\\rm h, Col~I} = 117\\pm17$ pc and $r_{\\rm h, Tri~II} =\n21\\pm4$ pc. The properties of both systems are consistent with observed scaling\nrelations for MW dwarf galaxies. Based on archival data, we derive upper limits\non the neutral gas content of these dwarfs, and find that they lack HI, as do\nthe majority of observed satellites within the MW virial radius. Neither\nsatellite shows evidence of tidal stripping in the form of extensions or\ndistortions in matched-filter stellar density maps or surface density profiles.\nHowever, the smaller Tri II system is relatively metal-rich for its luminosity\n(compared to other MW satellites), possibly because it has been tidally\nstripped. Through a suite of orbit simulations, we show that Tri II is\napproaching pericenter of its eccentric orbit, a stage at which tidal debris is\nunlikely to be seen. In addition, we find that Tri II may be on its first\ninfall into the MW, which helps explain its unique properties among MW dwarfs.\nFurther evidence that Tri II is likely an ultra-faint dwarf comes from its\nstellar mass function, which is similar to those of other MW dwarfs.\n", "  This paper presents the model-based design and evaluation of an instrument\nthat estimates incident neutron direction using the kinematics of neutron\nscattering by hydrogen-1 nuclei in an organic scintillator. The instrument\ndesign uses a single, nearly contiguous volume of organic scintillator that is\ninternally subdivided only as necessary to create optically isolated pillars.\nScintillation light emitted in a given pillar is confined to that pillar by a\ncombination of total internal reflection and a specular reflector applied to\nthe four sides of the pillar transverse to its long axis. The scintillation\nlight is collected at each end of the pillar using a photodetector. In this\noptically segmented design, the (x, y) position of scintillation light emission\n(where the x and y coordinates are transverse to the long axis of the pillars)\nis estimated as the pillar's (x, y) position in the scintillator \"block\", and\nthe z-position (the position along the pillar's long axis) is estimated from\nthe amplitude and relative timing of the signals produced by the photodetectors\nat each end of the pillar. For proton recoils greater than 1 MeV, we show that\nthe (x, y, z)-position of neutron-proton scattering can be estimated with < 1\ncm root-mean-squared [RMS] error and the proton recoil energy can be estimated\nwith < 50 keV RMS error by fitting the photodetectors' response time history to\nmodels of optical photon transport within the scintillator pillars. Finally, we\nevaluate several alternative designs of this proposed single-volume scatter\ncamera made of pillars of plastic scintillator (SVSC-PiPS), studying the effect\nof pillar dimensions, scintillator material, and photodetector response vs.\ntime. Specifically, we conclude that an SVSC-PiPS constructed using EJ-204 and\nan MCP-PM will produce the most precise estimates of incident neutron direction\nand energy.\n", "  We study the behavior of eight diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in different\ninterstellar environments, as characterized by the fraction of hydrogen in\nmolecular form [$f$(H$_2$)], with comparisons to the corresponding behavior of\nvarious known atomic and molecular species. The equivalent widths of the five\n\"normal\" DIBs ($\\lambda\\lambda$5780.5, 5797.1, 6196.0, 6283.8, and 6613.6),\nnormalized to $E(B-V)$, show a \"Lambda-shaped\" behavior: they increase at low\n$f$(H$_2$), peak at $f$(H$_2$) ~ 0.3, and then decrease. The similarly\nnormalized column densities of Ca, Ca$^+$, Ti$^+$, and CH$^+$ also decline for\n$f$(H$_2$) > 0.3. In contrast, the normalized column densities of Na, K, CH,\nCN, and CO increase monotonically with $f$(H$_2$), and the trends exhibited by\nthe three C$_2$ DIBs ($\\lambda\\lambda$4726.8, 4963.9, and 4984.8) lie between\nthose two general behaviors. These trends with $f$(H$_2$) are accompanied by\ncosmic scatter, the dispersion at any given $f$(H$_2$) being significantly\nlarger than the individual errors of measurement. The Lambda-shaped trends\nsuggest the balance between creation and destruction of the DIB carriers\ndiffers dramatically between diffuse atomic and diffuse molecular clouds;\nadditional processes besides ionization and shielding are needed to explain\nthose observed trends. Except for several special cases, the highest\n$W$(5780)/$W$(5797) ratios, characterizing the so-called \"sigma-zeta effect\",\noccur only at $f$(H$_2$) < 0.2. We propose a sequence of DIBs based on trends\nin their pair-wise strength ratios with increasing $f$(H$_2$). In order of\nincreasing environmental density, we find the $\\lambda$6283.8 and\n$\\lambda$5780.5 DIBs, the $\\lambda$6196.0 DIB, the $\\lambda$6613.6 DIB, the\n$\\lambda$5797.1 DIB, and the C$_2$ DIBs.\n", "  Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are regarded as the basic building blocks in the\nformation of larger galaxies and are believed to be the most dark matter\ndominated systems known in the Universe. There are several models that attempt\nto explain their formation and evolution, but they have problems to model the\nformation of isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Here, we will explain a\npossible formation scenario in which star clusters form inside the dark matter\nhalo of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Those star clusters suffer from low star\nformation efficiency and dissolve while orbiting inside the dark matter halo.\nThereby, they build the faint luminous components that we observe in dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies. In this paper we study this model by adding different star\nformation histories to the simulations to compare the results with our previous\nwork and observational data to show that we can explain the formation of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies.\n", "  We study the rheology of dense granular flows for frictionless\nspherocylinders by means of 3D numerical simulations. As in the case of\nspherical particles, the effective friction $\\mu$ is an increasing function of\nthe inertial number $I$, and we systematically investigate the dependence of\n$\\mu$ on the particle aspect ratio $Q$, as well as that of the normal stress\ndifferences, the volume fraction and the coordination number. We show in\nparticular that the quasi-static friction coefficient is non-monotonic with\n$Q$: from the spherical case $Q=1$, it first sharply increases, reaches a\nmaximum around $Q \\simeq 1.05$, and then gently decreases, reaching back its\ninitial value for $Q \\simeq 2$. We provide a microscopic interpretation for\nthis unexpected behavior through the analysis of the distribution of\ndissipative contacts around the particles: as compared to spheres, slightly\nelongated grains enhance contacts in their central cylindrical band, whereas at\nlarger aspect ratios particles tend to align and dissipate by preferential\ncontacts at their hemispherical caps.\n", "  We introduce a new, powerful method to constrain properties of neutron stars\n(NSs). We show that the total mass of GW170817 provides a reliable constraint\non the stellar radius if the merger did not result in a prompt collapse as\nsuggested by the interpretation of associated electromagnetic emission. The\nradius R_1.6 of nonrotating NSs with a mass of 1.6 M_sun can be constrained to\nbe larger than 10.68_{-0.04}^{+0.15} km, and the radius R_max of the\nnonrotating maximum mass configuration must be larger than 9.60_{-0.03}^{+0.14}\nkm. We point out that detections of future events will further improve these\nconstraints. Moreover, we show that a future event with a signature of a prompt\ncollapse of the merger remnant will establish even stronger constraints on the\nNS radius from above and the maximum mass M_max of NSs from above. These\nconstraints are particularly robust because they only require a measurement of\nthe chirp mass and a distinction between prompt and delayed collapse of the\nmerger remnant, which may be inferred from the electromagnetic signal or even\nfrom the presence/absence of a ringdown gravitational-wave (GW) signal. This\nprospect strengthens the case of our novel method of constraining NS\nproperties, which is directly applicable to future GW events with accompanying\nelectromagnetic counterpart observations. We emphasize that this procedure is a\nnew way of constraining NS radii from GW detections independent of existing\nefforts to infer radius information from the late inspiral phase or postmerger\noscillations, and it does not require particularly loud GW events.\n", "  SiH has long been observed in the spectrum of our Sun and other cool stars.\nComputed line lists for the main isotopologues of silicon monohydride,\n$^{28}$SiH, $^{29}$SiH, $^{30}$SiH and $^{28}$SiD are presented. These line\nlists consider rotation-vibration transitions within the ground $X$ $^{2}\\Pi$\nelectronic state as well as transitions to the low-lying $A$ $^{2}\\Delta$ and\n$a$ $^{4}\\Sigma^-$ states. Ab initio potential energy (PECs) and dipole moment\ncurves (DMCs) along with spin-orbit and electronic-angular-momentum couplings\nbetween them are calculated using the MRCI level of theory with the MOLPRO\npackage. The PEC for the ground X $^2\\Pi$ state is refined to available\nexperimental data with a typical accuracy of around 0.01 cm$^{-1}$ or better.\nThe $^{28}$SiH line list includes 11,785 rovibronic states and 1,724,841\ntransitions with associated Einstein-A coefficients for angular momentum $J$ up\nto $82.5$ and covering wavenumbers up to 31340 cm$^{-1}$ ($\\lambda$ $<$ 0.319\n$\\mu$m). Spectra are simulated using the new line list and comparisons made\nwith various experimental spectra. These line lists are applicable up to\ntemperatures of ~5000 K, making them relevant to astrophysical objects such as\nexoplanetary atmospheres and cool stars and opening up the possibility of\ndetection in the interstellar medium. These line lists are available at the\nExoMol www.exomol.com and CDS database websites.\n", "  We explore the scenario of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) being the cause of\nthe observed continuous X-ray absorption of the August 30 1997 superflare on\nthe eclipsing binary Algol (the Demon Star). The temporal decay of the\nabsorption is consistent with absorption by a CME undergoing self-similar\nevolution with uniform expansion velocity. We investigate the kinematic and\nenergetic properties of the CME using the ice-cream cone model for its\nthree-dimensional structure in combination with the observed profile of the\nhydrogen column density decline with time. Different physically justified\nlength scales were used that allowed us to estimate lower and upper limits of\nthe possible CME characteristics. Further consideration of the maximum\navailable magnetic energy in starspots leads us to quantify its mass as likely\nlying in the range $2\\times 10^{21}$-$2\\times 10^{22}$ g and kinetic energy in\nthe range $7\\times 10^{35}$-$3\\times 10^{38}$ erg. The results are in\nreasonable agreement with extrapolated relations between flare X-ray fluence\nand CME mass and kinetic energy derived for solar CMEs.\n", "  [Abridged] The Lupus I cloud is found between the Upper-Scorpius and the\nUpper-Centaurus-Lupus sub-groups, where the expanding USco HI shell appears to\ninteract with a bubble currently driven by the winds of the remaining B-stars\nof UCL. We investigate if the Lupus I molecular could have formed in a\ncolliding flow, and how the kinematics of the cloud might have been influenced\nby the larger scale gas dynamics. We performed APEX 13CO and C18O observations\nof three parts of Lupus. We compare these results to the atomic hydrogen data\nfrom the GASS HI survey and our dust emission results presented in the previous\npaper. Based on the velocity information, we present a geometric model for the\ninteraction zone between the USco shell and the UCL wind bubble. We present\nevidence that the molecular gas of Lupus I is tightly linked to the atomic\nmaterial of the USco shell. The CO emission in Lupus I is found mainly at\nvelocities in the same range as the HI velocities. Thus, the molecular cloud is\nco-moving with the expanding USco atomic Hi shell. The gas in the cloud shows a\ncomplex kinematic structure with several line-of-sight components that overlay\neach other. The non-thermal velocity dispersion is in the transonic regime in\nall parts of the cloud and could be injected by external compression. Our\nobservations and the derived geometric model agree with a scenario where Lupus\nI is located in the interaction zone between the USco shell and the UCL wind\nbubble. The kinematics observations are consistent with a scenario where the\nLupus I cloud formed via shell instabilities. The particular location of Lupus\nI between USco and UCL suggests that counter-pressure from the UCL wind bubble\nand pre-existing density enhancements, perhaps left over from the gas stream\nthat formed the stellar subgroups, may have played a role in its formation.\n", "  Galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been invoked to\nplay a fundamental role in the co-evolution between supermassive black holes\nand their host galaxies. Finding observational evidence of such feedback\nmechanisms is of crucial importance and it requires a multi-wavelength approach\nin order to compare winds at different scales and phases. In Tombesi et al.\n(2015) we reported the detection of a powerful ultra-fast outflow (UFO) in the\nSuzaku X-ray spectrum of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy IRAS F11119$+$3257.\nThe comparison with a galaxy-scale OH molecular outflow observed with Herschel\nin the same source supported the energy-conserving scenario for AGN feedback.\nThe main objective of this work is to perform an independent check of the\nSuzaku results using the higher sensitivity and wider X-ray continuum coverage\nof NuSTAR. We clearly detect a highly ionized Fe K UFO in the 100ks NuSTAR\nspectrum with parameters $N_H = (3.2\\pm1.5)\\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$,\nlog$\\xi$$=$$4.0^{+1.2}_{-0.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm, and $v_{\\text{out}} =\n0.253^{+0.061}_{-0.118}$ c. The launching radius is likely at a distance of $r\n\\ge 16$ $r_s$ from the black hole. The mass outflow rate is in the range\n$\\dot{M}_{out}$$\\simeq$0.5-2 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The UFO momentum rate and\npower are $\\dot{P}_{out} \\simeq$0.5-2 $L_{AGN}/c$ and $\\dot{E}_{out}\n\\simeq$7-27\\% $L_{AGN}$, respectively. The UFO parameters are consistent\nbetween the 2013 Suzaku and the 2015 NuSTAR observations. Only the column\ndensity is found to be variable, possibly suggesting a clumpy wind. The\ncomparison with the energetics of molecular outflows estimated in infrared and\nmillimeter wavelengths support a connection between the nuclear and\ngalaxy-scale winds in luminous AGN.\n", "  The reionization of cosmic hydrogen marks a critical juncture in the history\nof structure formation in the universe. Here we present a new formulation of\nthe standard reionization equation for the evolution of the volume-averaged HII\nfraction that is more consistent with the accepted conceptual model of\ninhomogeneous intergalactic absorption. The revised equation retains the basic\nterminology and simplicity of the classic calculation but explicitly accounts\nfor the presence of the optically thick \"Lyman-limit systems\" that are known to\ndetermine the mean free path of ionizing radiation after overlap. Integration\nof this equation provides a better characterization of the timing of\nreionization by smoothly linking the pre-overlap with the post-overlap phases\nof such process. We confirm the validity of the quasi-instantaneous\napproximation as predictor of reionization completion/maintenance, and discuss\nnew insights on the sources of cosmic reionization using the improved\nformalism. A constant emission rate into the intergalactic medium (IGM) of 3\nLyman continuum (LyC) photons per atom per Gyr leads to a reionization history\nthat is consistent with a number of observational constraints on the ionization\nstate of the z=5-9 universe and with the reduced Thomson scattering optical\ndepth recently reported by the Planck Collaboration. While star-forming\ngalaxies can dominate the reionization process if the luminosity-weighted\nfraction of LyC photons that escape into the IGM, f_esc, exceeds 15% (for a\nfaint magnitude cut-off of the galaxy UV luminosity function of M_lim=-13 and a\nLyC photon yield per unit 1500 AA luminosity of xi_ion=10^{25.3} Hz/erg, simple\nmodels where the product of the two unknowns f_esc xi_ion is not evolving with\nredshift fail to reproduce the changing neutrality of the IGM observed at these\nepochs.\n", "  Recent observations of the low-mass rotation distributions of the Pleiades\nand Praesepe clusters have revealed a ubiquitous correlation between mass and\nrotation, such that late M dwarfs rotate an order-of-magnitude faster than\nearly M dwarfs. In this paper, we demonstrate that this mass-rotation\ncorrelation is present in the 10 Myr Upper Scorpius association, as revealed by\nnew ${\\it K2}$ rotation measurements. Using rotational evolution models we show\nthat the low-mass ($0.1-0.6 M_{\\odot}$) rotation distribution of the 125 Myr\nPleiades cluster can only be produced if it hosted an equally strong\nmass-rotation correlation at 10 Myr. This suggests that physical processes\nimportant in the early pre-main sequence (star formation, accretion,\ndisk-locking) are primarily responsible for the M dwarf rotation morphology,\nand not quirks of later angular momentum evolution. Such early mass trends must\nbe taken into account when constructing initial conditions for future studies\nof stellar rotation. Finally, we show that the average M star loses $\\sim\n25-40$% of its angular momentum between 10 and 125 Myr, a figure accurately and\ngenerically predicted by modern solar-calibrated wind models. Their success\nrules out a lossless pre-main sequence, and validates the extrapolation of\nmagnetic wind laws designed for solar-type stars to the low-mass regime at\nearly times.\n", "  The spatial distribution of satellite galaxies around pairs of galaxies in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have been found to bulge significantly\ntowards the respective partner. Highly anisotropic, planar distributions of\nsatellite galaxies are in conflict with expectations derived from cosmological\nsimulations. Does the lopsided distribution of satellite systems around host\ngalaxy pairs constitute a similar challenge to the standard model of cosmology?\nWe investigate whether such satellite distributions are present around stacked\npairs of hosts extracted from the $\\Lambda$CDM simulations Millennium-I,\nMillennium-II, ELVIS, and Illustris-1. By utilizing this set of simulations\ncovering different volumes, resolutions, and physics, we implicitly test\nwhether a lopsided signal exists for different ranges of satellite galaxy\nmasses, and whether the inclusion of hydrodynamical effects produces\nsignificantly different results. All simulations display a lopsidedness similar\nto the observed situation. The signal is highly significant for simulations\ncontaining a sufficient number of hosts and resolved satellite galaxies (up to\n$5\\,\\sigma$ for Millennium-II). We find a projected signal that is up to twice\nas strong as that reported for the SDSS systems for certain opening angles\n($\\sim16\\%$ more satellites in the direction between the pair than expected for\nuniform distributions). Considering that the SDSS signal is a lower limit owing\nto likely back- and foreground contamination, the $\\Lambda$CDM simulations\nappear to be consistent with this particular empirical property of galaxy\npairs.\n", "  We investigate the lack of observed low mass black hole binary systems at\nshort periods ( < 4 hours) by comparing the observed orbital period\ndistribution of 17 confirmed low mass Black hole X-ray Binaries (BHXBs) with\ntheir implied period distribution after correcting for the effects of\nextinction of the optical counterpart, absorption of the X-ray outburst and the\nprobability of detecting a source in outburst. We also draw samples from two\nsimple orbital period distributions and compare the simulated and observed\norbital period distributions. We predict that there are >200 and <3000 binaries\nin the Galaxy with periods between 2 and 3 hours, with an additional ~600\nobjects between 3 and 10 hours\n", "  We present spatially resolved stellar kinematic maps, for the first time, for\na sample of 17 intermediate redshift galaxies (0.2 < z < 0.8). We used deep\nMUSE/VLT integral field spectroscopic observations in the Hubble Deep Field\nSouth (HDFS) and Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), resulting from ~30h\nintegration time per field, each covering 1'x1' field of view, with ~0.65\"\nspatial resolution. We selected all galaxies brighter than 25mag in the I band\nand for which the stellar continuum is detected over an area that is at least\ntwo times larger than the spatial resolution. The resulting sample contains\nmostly late-type disk, main-sequence star-forming galaxies with 10^8.5 -\n10^10.5 Msun. Using a full-spectrum fitting technique, we derive\ntwo-dimensional maps of the stellar and gas kinematics, including the radial\nvelocity V and velocity dispersion sigma. We find that most galaxies in the\nsample are consistent with having rotating stellar disks with roughly constant\nvelocity dispersions and that the Vrms=sqrt{V^2+sigma^2} of the gas and stars,\na scaling proxy for the galaxy gravitational potential, compare well to each\nother. These spatially resolved observations of intermediate redshift galaxies\nsuggest that the regular stellar kinematics of disk galaxies that is observed\nin the local Universe was already in place 4 - 7 Gyr ago and that their gas\nkinematics traces the gravitational potential of the galaxy, thus is not\ndominated by shocks and turbulent motions. Finally, we build dynamical\naxisymmetric Jeans models constrained by the derived stellar kinematics for two\nspecific galaxies and derive their dynamical masses. These are in good\nagreement (within 25%) with those derived from simple exponential disk models\nbased on the gas kinematics. The obtained mass-to-light ratios hint towards\ndark matter dominated systems within a few effective radii.\n", "  Based on the new findings on the turbulent dynamo in \\citet{XL16}, we examine\nthe magnetic field amplification in the context of supernova remnants. Due to\nthe strong ion-neutral collisional damping in the weakly-ionized interstellar\nmedium, the dynamo in the preshock turbulence remains in the damping kinematic\nregime, which leads to {\\it a linear-in-time growth of the magnetic field\nstrength}. The resultant magnetic field structure enables effective diffusion\nupstream and shock acceleration of cosmic rays to energies above the \"knee\".\nDifferently, the nonlinear dynamo in the postshock turbulence leads to {\\it a\nlinear-in-time growth of the magnetic energy} due to the turbulent magnetic\ndiffusion. Given a weak initial field strength in the postshock region, the\nmagnetic field saturates at a significant distance from the shock front as a\nresult of the inefficiency of the nonlinear dynamo. This result is in a good\nagreement with existing numerical simulations and well explains the X-ray spots\ndetected far behind the shock front.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of impulsively generated magnetic swirls in\nan isolated flux tube which is rooted in the solar photosphere. These swirls\nare triggered by an initial pulse in a horizontal component of the velocity.\nThe initial pulse is launched either: (a) centrally, within the localized\nmagnetic flux tube; or (b) off-central, in the ambient medium. The evolution\nand dynamics of the flux tube is described by three-dimensional, ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations. These equations are numerically solved to reveal\nthat in case (a) dipole-like swirls associated with the fast magnetoacoustic\nkink and $m=1$ Alfv\\'en waves are generated. In case (b), the fast\nmagnetoacoustic kink and $m=0$ Alfv\\'en modes are excited. In both these cases,\nthe excited fast magnetoacoustic kink and Alfv\\'en waves consist of similar\nflow pattern and magnetic shells are also generated with clockwise and\ncounter-clockwise rotating plasma within them, which can be the proxy of\ndipole-shaped chromospheric swirls. The complex dynamics of vortices and wave\nperturbations reveals the channelling of sufficient amount of energy to fulfill\nenergy losses in the chromosphere ($\\sim$ 10$^{4}$ W m$^{-1}$) and in the\ncorona ($\\sim$ 10$^{2}$ W m$^{-1}$). Some of these numerical findings are\nreminiscent of signatures in recent observational data.\n", "  Mid-infrared properties are reported of the west hot spot of the radio galaxy\nPictor A with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The mid-infrared\ncounterpart to the hot spot, WISE J051926.26-454554.1, is listed in the AllWISE\nsource catalog. The source was detected in all the four WISE photometric bands.\nA comparison between the WISE and radio images reinforces the physical\nassociation of the \\wise\\ source to the hot spot. The WISE flux density of the\nsource was carefully evaluated. A close investigation of the multi-wavelength\nsynchrotron spectral energy distribution from the object reveals a mid-infrared\nexcess at the wavelength of $\\lambda=22$ $\\mu$m with a statistical significance\nof $4.8 \\sigma$ over the simple power-law extrapolation from the synchrotron\nradio spectrum. The excess is reinforced by single and double cutoff power-law\nmodeling of the radio-to-optical spectral energy distribution. The synchrotron\ncutoff frequency of the main and excess components was evaluated as $7.1 \\times\n10^{14}$ Hz and $5.5 \\times 10^{13}$ Hz, respectively. From the cutoff\nfrequency, the magnetic field of the emission region was constrained as a\nfunction of the region size. In order to interpret the excess component, an\nelectron population different from the main one dominating the observed radio\nspectrum is necessary. The excess emission is proposed to originate in a sub\nstructure within the hot spot, in which the magnetic field is by a factor of a\nfew stronger than that in the minimum energy condition. The relation of the\nmid-infrared excess to the X-ray emission is briefly discussed.\n", "  Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations at 230 GHz are combined with Very\nLong Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at 86 GHz and high resolution\nHubble Space Telescope optical observations in order to constrain the broadband\nspectrum of the emission from the base of the jet in M87. The recent VLBI\nobservations of Hada et al provide much stricter limits on the 86 GHz\nluminosity and component acceleration in the jet base than was available to\nprevious modelers. They reveal an almost hollow jet on sub-mas scales. Thus,\ntubular models of the jet base emanating from the innermost accretion disk are\nconsidered within the region responsible for the EHT correlated flux. There is\nsubstantial synchrotron self absorbed opacity at 86 GHz. A parametric analysis\nindicates that the jet dimensions and power depend strongly on the 86 GHz flux\ndensity and the black hole spin, but weakly on other parameters such as jet\nspeed, 230 GHz flux density and optical flux. The entire power budget of the\nM87 jet, $\\lesssim 10^{44}\\rm{ergs/sec}$, can be accommodated by the tubular\njet. No invisible, powerful spine is required. Even though this analysis never\nemploys the resolution of the EHT, the spectral shape implies a dimension\ntransverse to the jet direction of 12-21 $\\mu \\rm{as}$ ($\\sim$24-27$\\, \\mu\n\\rm{as}$) for $0.99 > a/M > 0.95$ ($a/M\\sim 0.7 $), where $M$ is the mass and\n$a$ is the angular momentum per unit mass of the central black hole.\n", "  Stellar flares are a frequent occurrence on young low-mass stars around which\nmany detected exoplanets orbit. Flares are energetic, impulsive events, and\ntheir impact on exoplanetary atmospheres needs to be taken into account when\ninterpreting transit observations. We have developed a model to describe the\nupper atmosphere of Extrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs) orbiting flaring stars. The\nmodel simulates thermal escape from the upper atmospheres of close-in EGPs.\nIonisation by solar radiation and electron impact is included and photochemical\nand diffusive transport processes are simulated. This model is used to study\nthe effect of stellar flares from the solar-like G star HD209458 and the young\nK star HD189733 on their respective planets. A hypothetical HD209458b-like\nplanet orbiting the active M star AU Mic is also simulated. We find that the\nneutral upper atmosphere of EGPs is not significantly affected by typical\nflares. Therefore, stellar flares alone would not cause large enough changes in\nplanetary mass loss to explain the variations in HD189733b transit depth seen\nin previous studies, although we show that it may be possible that an extreme\nstellar proton event could result in the required mass loss. Our simulations do\nhowever reveal an enhancement in electron number density in the ionosphere of\nthese planets, the peak of which is located in the layer where stellar X-rays\nare absorbed. Electron densities are found to reach 2.2 to 3.5 times pre-flare\nlevels and enhanced electron densities last from about 3 to 10 hours after the\nonset of the flare. The strength of the flare and the width of its spectral\nenergy distribution affect the range of altitudes that see enhancements in\nionisation. A large broadband continuum component in the XUV portion of the\nflaring spectrum in very young flare stars, such as AU Mic, results in a broad\nrange of altitudes affected in planets orbiting this star.\n", "  We report the simultaneous presence of chromospheric umbral flashes and\nassociated umbral waves, and propagating coronal disturbances, in a sunspot and\nrelated active region. We have analyzed time-distance maps obtained using the\nobservations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO). These maps show the simultaneous occurrence of different\nsunspot oscillation and waves such as umbral flashes, umbral waves, and coronal\nwaves. Analysis of the original light curves, i.e., without implementing any\nFourier filtering on them, show that the amplitudes of different sunspot waves\nobserved at different atmospheric layers change in synchronization with the\nlight curves obtained from the umbral flash region, thus demonstrating that\nthese oscillations are modulated by umbral flashes. This study provides the\nfirst observational evidence of the influence of sunspot oscillations within\nthe umbra on other sunspot waves extending up to the corona. The properties of\nthese waves and oscillations can be utilized to study the inherent magnetic\ncoupling among different layers of the solar atmosphere above sunspots.\n", "  We have used HST/COS to obtain a series of 4 FUV (915-2148A) spectroscopic\nobservations of the prototypical dwarf nova U Geminorum during its cooling\nfollowing a two-week outburst. Our FUV spectral analysis of the data indicates\nthat the white dwarf (WD) cools from a temperature of 41,500 K, 15 days after\nthe peak of the outburst, to 36,250 K, 56 days after the peak of the outburst,\nassuming a massive WD (log(g)=8.8) and a distance of 100.4 pc. These results\nare self-consistent with a 1.1 solar mass WD with a 5,000 km radius. The\nspectra show many absorption lines of but no emission features. We find\nsupra-solar abundances of nitrogen confirming the anomalous high N/C ratio. The\nFUV lightcurve reveals a 5% modulation with the orbital phase, showing dips\nnear phase 0.25 and 0.75, where the spectra exhibit an increase in the depth of\nsome absorption lines and in particular strong absorption lines from Si, Al,\nand Ar. The phase dependence we observe is consistent with material overflowing\nthe disk rim at the hot spot, reaching a maximum elevation near phase 0.75,\nfalling back at smaller radii near phase 0.5 where it bounces off the disk\nsurface and again rising above the disk near phase 0.25. There is a large\nscatter in the absorption lines' velocities, especially for the silicon lines,\nwhile the carbon lines seem to match more closely the orbital velocity of the\nWD. This indicates that many absorption lines are affected by- or form in- the\noverflowing stream material veiling the WD, making the analysis of the WD\nspectra more difficult.\n", "  We study the role of cold gas in quenching star formation in the green valley\nby analysing ALMA $^{12}$CO (1-0) observations of three galaxies with resolved\noptical spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey. We present resolution-matched maps\nof the star formation rate and molecular gas mass. These data are used to\ncalculate the star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas fraction ($f_{\\rm~gas}$)\nfor these galaxies separately in the central `bulge' regions and outer disks.\nWe find that, for the two galaxies whose global specific star formation rate\n(sSFR) deviates most from the star formation main sequence, the gas fraction in\nthe bulges is significantly lower than that in their disks, supporting an\n`inside-out' model of galaxy quenching. For the two galaxies where SFE can be\nreliably determined in the central regions, the bulges and disks share similar\nSFEs. This suggests that a decline in $f_{\\rm~gas}$ is the main driver of\nlowered sSFR in bulges compared to disks in green valley galaxies. Within the\ndisks, there exist common correlations between the sSFR and SFE and between\nsSFR and $f_{\\rm~gas}$ on kpc scales -- the local SFE or $f_{\\rm~gas}$ in the\ndisks declines with local sSFR. Our results support a picture in which the sSFR\nin bulges is primarily controlled by $f_{\\rm~gas}$, whereas both SFE and\n$f_{\\rm~gas}$ play a role in lowering the sSFR in disks. A larger sample is\nrequired to confirm if the trend established in this work is representative of\ngreen valley as a whole.\n", "  We conjecture that observed protoplanetary disc accretion rates may be\nexplained with low viscosities which could be the result of hydrodynamic\nturbulence. We show that viscosities parameterized in the usual way with\n$\\alpha \\gtrsim 10^{-4}$, comparable to values suggested for hydrodynamic\nturbulence, can explain the observed accretion rates and lifetimes with\nplausible inner disc surface densities. Our models are also in better agreement\nwith surface density estimates of the minimum mass solar nebula than models\nwith rapid transport for a given mass accretion rate, such as recent models of\naccretion driven by magnetic winds. The required surface densities are a\nnatural result of the protostellar infall phase, as long as non-gravitational\ntransport is limited. We argue that, in addition to possible non-ideal magnetic\ntransport due to disc winds possibly modified by the Hall effect, the effects\nof low-viscosity hydrodynamic accretion deserve more consideration.\n", "  The ideal MHD theorem on the conservation of the magnetic connections between\nplasma elements is generalized to relativistic plasmas in curved spacetime. The\nconnections between plasma elements, which are established by a covariant\nconnection equation, display a particularly complex structure in curved\nspacetime. Nevertheless, it is shown that these connections can be interpreted\nin terms of magnetic field lines alone by adopting a $3+1$ foliation of\nspacetime.\n", "  Axion stars are hypothetical objects formed of axions, obtained as localized\nand coherently oscillating solutions to their classical equation of motion.\nDepending on the value of the field amplitude at the core $|\\theta_0| \\equiv\n|\\theta(r=0)|$, the equilibrium of the system arises from the balance of the\nkinetic pressure and either self-gravity or axion self-interactions. Starting\nfrom a general relativistic framework, we obtain the set of equations\ndescribing the configuration of the axion star, which we solve as a function of\n$|\\theta_0|$. For small $|\\theta_0| \\lesssim 1$, we reproduce results\npreviously obtained in the literature, and we provide arguments for the\nstability of such configurations in terms of first principles. We compare\nqualitative analytical results with a numerical calculation. For large\namplitudes $|\\theta_0| \\gtrsim 1$, the axion field probes the full non-harmonic\nQCD chiral potential and the axion star enters the {\\it dense} branch. Our\nnumerical solutions show that in this latter regime the axions are\nrelativistic, and that one should not use a single frequency approximation, as\npreviously applied in the literature. We employ a multi-harmonic expansion to\nsolve the relativistic equation for the axion field in the star, and\ndemonstrate that higher modes cannot be neglected in the dense regime. We\ninterpret the solutions in the dense regime as pseudo-breathers, and show that\nthe life-time of such configurations is much smaller than any cosmological time\nscale.\n", "  We present a census of variable stars in six M31 dwarf spheroidal satellites\nobserved with the Hubble Space Telescope. We detect 870 RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in\nthe fields of And I (296), II (251), III (111), XV (117), XVI (8), XXVIII (87).\nWe also detect a total of 15 Anomalous Cepheids, three Eclipsing Binaries, and\nseven field RRL stars compatible with being members of the M31 halo or the\nGiant Stellar Stream. We derive robust and homogeneous distances to the six\ngalaxies using different methods based on the properties of the RRL stars.\nWorking with the up-to-date set of Period-Wesenheit ($I$, $B$ - $I$) relations\npublished by Marconi et al., we obtain distance moduli of $\\mu_0$ = [24.49,\n24.16, 24.36, 24.42, 23.70, 24.43] mag (respectively), with systematic\nuncertainties of 0.08 mag and statistical uncertainties $<$ 0.11 mag. We have\nconsidered an enlarged sample of sixteen M31 satellites with published\nvariability studies, and compared their pulsational observables (e.g., periods,\namplitudes), with those of fifteen Milky Way satellites for which similar data\nare available. The properties of the (strictly old) RRL in both satellite\nsystems do not show any significant difference. In particular, we found a\nstrikingly similar correlation between the mean period distribution of the\nfundamental RRL pulsators (RRab) and the mean metallicities of the galaxies.\nThis indicates that the old RRL progenitors were similar at the early stage in\nthe two environments, suggesting very similar characteristics for the earliest\nstages of evolution of both satellite systems.\n", "  We present a new algorithm to estimate quasar photometric redshifts\n(photo-$z$s), by considering the asymmetries in the relative flux distributions\nof quasars. The relative flux models are built with multivariate Skew-t\ndistributions in the multi-dimensional space of relative fluxes as a function\nof redshift and magnitude. For 151,392 quasars in the SDSS, we achieve a\nphoto-$z$ accuracy, defined as the fraction of quasars with the difference\nbetween the photo-$z$ $z_p$ and the spectroscopic redshift $z_s$, $|\\Delta z| =\n|z_s-z_p|/(1+z_s)$ within 0.1, of 74%. Combining the WISE W1 and W2 infrared\ndata with the SDSS data, the photo-$z$ accuracy is enhanced to 87%. Using the\nPan-STARRS1 or DECaLS photometry with WISE W1 and W2 data, the photo-$z$\naccuracies are 79% and 72%, respectively. The prior probabilities as a function\nof magnitude for quasars, stars and galaxies are calculated respectively based\non (1) the quasar luminosity function; (2) the Milky Way synthetic simulation\nwith the Besan\\c{c}on model; (3) the Bayesian Galaxy Photometric Redshift\nestimation. The relative fluxes of stars are obtained with the Padova\nisochrones, and the relative fluxes of galaxies are modeled through galaxy\ntemplates. We test our classification method to select quasars using the DECaLS\n$g$, $r$, $z$, and WISE W1 and W2 photometry. The quasar selection completeness\nis higher than 70% for a wide redshift range $0.5<z<4.5$, and a wide magnitude\nrange $18<r<21.5$ mag. Our photo-$z$ regression and classification method has\nthe potential to extend to future surveys. The photo-$z$ code will be publicly\navailable.\n", "  Non-resonant FeII* 2365, 2396, 2612, 2626 emission can potentially trace\ngalactic winds in emission and provide useful constraints to wind models. From\nthe 3'x3' mosaic of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) obtained with the\nVLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph, we identify a statistical sample of 40\nFeII* emitters and 50 MgII 2796, 2803 emitters from a sample of 271 [OII] 3726,\n3729 emitters with reliable redshifts from z = 0.85 - 1.5 down to 2E-18 (3\nsigma) ergs/s/cm^2 (for [OII]), covering the stellar mass range 10^8 - 10^11\nMsun. The FeII* and MgII emitters follow the galaxy main sequence, but with a\nclear dichotomy. Galaxies with masses below 10^9 Msun and star formation rates\n(SFRs) of <1 Msun/year have MgII emission without accompanying FeII* emission,\nwhereas galaxies with masses above 10^10 Msun and SFRs >10 Msun/year have FeII*\nemission without accompanying MgII emission. Between these two regimes,\ngalaxies have both MgII and FeII* emission, typically with MgII P-Cygni\nprofiles. Indeed, the MgII profile shows a progression along the main sequence\nfrom pure emission to P-Cygni profiles to strong absorption, due to resonant\ntrapping. Combining the deep MUSE data with HST ancillary information, we find\nthat galaxies with pure MgII emission profiles have lower star formation rate\nsurface densities than those with either MgII P-Cygni profiles or FeII*\nemission. These spectral signatures produced through continuum scattering and\nfluorescence, MgII P-Cygni profiles and FeII* emission, are better candidates\nfor tracing galactic outflows than pure MgII emission, which may originate from\nHII regions. We compare the absorption and emission rest-frame equivalent\nwidths for pairs of FeII transitions to predictions from outflow models and\nfind that the observations consistently have less total re-emission than\nabsorption, suggesting either dust extinction or non-isotropic outflow\ngeometries.\n", "  The formation and evolution of gravitationally bound, star forming\nsubstructures in tidal tails of interacting galaxies, called tidal dwarf\ngalaxies (TDG), has been studied, until now, only in idealised simulations of\nindividual pairs of interacting galaxies for pre-determined orbits, mass\nratios, and gas fractions. Here, we present the first identification of TDG\ncandidates in fully cosmological simulations, specifically the high-resolution\nsimulations of the EAGLE suite. The finite resolution of the simulation limits\ntheir ability to predict the exact formation rate and survival timescale of\nTDGs, but we show that gravitationally bound baryonic structures in tidal arms\nalready form in current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. In this\ncase, the orbital parameter, disc orientations as well as stellar and gas\nmasses and the specific angular momentum of the TDG forming galaxies are a\ndirect consequence of cosmic structure formation. We identify TDG candidates in\na wide range of environments, such as multiple galaxy mergers, clumpy\nhigh-redshift (up to z = 2) galaxies, high-speed encounters, and tidal\ninteractions with gas-poor galaxies. We present selection methods, the\nproperties of the identified TDG candidates and a roadmap for more quantitative\nanalyses using future high-resolution simulations.\n", "  We present a spectral-variability analysis of the low-redshift quasar PDS 456\nusing principal component analysis. In the XMM-Newton data, we find a strong\npeak in the first principal component at the energy of the Fe absorption line\nfrom the highly blueshifted outflow. This indicates that the absorption feature\nis more variable than the continuum, and that it is responding to the\ncontinuum. We find qualitatively different behaviour in the Suzaku data, which\nis dominated by changes in the column density of neutral absorption. In this\ncase, we find no evidence of the absorption produced by the highly ionized gas\nbeing correlated with this variability. Additionally, we perform simulations of\nthe source variability, and demonstrate that PCA can trivially distinguish\nbetween outflow variability correlated, anti-correlated, and un-correlated with\nthe continuum flux. Here, the observed anti-correlation between the absorption\nline equivalent width and the continuum flux may be due to the ionization of\nthe wind responding to the continuum. Finally, we compare our results with\nthose found in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 IRAS 13224-3809. We find that the Fe K\nUFO feature is sharper and more prominent in PDS 456, but that it lacks the\nlower energy features from lighter elements found in IRAS 13224-3809,\npresumably due to differences in ionization.\n", "  We model the intracluster medium as a weakly collisional plasma that is a\nbinary mixture of the hydrogen and the helium ions, along with free electrons.\nWhen, owing to the helium sedimentation, the gradient of the mean molecular\nweight (or equivalently, composition or helium ions' concentration) of the\nplasma is not negligible, it can have appreciable influence on the stability\ncriteria of the thermal convective instabilities, e.g., the heat-flux-buoyancy\ninstability and the magnetothermal instability (MTI). These instabilities are\nconsequences of the anisotropic heat conduction occurring preferentially along\nthe magnetic field lines. In this paper, without ignoring the magnetic tension,\nwe first present the mathematical criterion for the onset of composition\ngradient modified MTI. Subsequently, we relax the commonly adopted equilibrium\nstate in which the plasma is at rest, and assume that the plasma is in a\nsheared state which may be due to differential rotation. We discuss how the\nconcentration gradient affects the coupling between the Kelvin--Helmholtz\ninstability and the MTI in rendering the plasma unstable or stable. We derive\nexact stability criterion by working with the sharp boundary case in which the\nphysical variables---temperature, mean molecular weight, density, and magnetic\nfield---change discontinuously from one constant value to another on crossing\nthe boundary. Finally, we perform the linear stability analysis for the case of\nthe differentially rotating plasma that is thermally and compositionally\nstratified as well. By assuming axisymmetric perturbations, we find the\ncorresponding dispersion relation and the explicit mathematical expression\ndetermining the onset of the modified MTI.\n", "  We demonstrate an interface-sensitive NMR in a semiconducting nanostructure,\nwhere an NMR signal from the minute heterojunction region of a model\nheterojunction structure (In$_{0.48}$Ga$_{0.52}$P/GaAs) is detected by using\nnuclear hyperpolarization created by optical pumping. The key to the detection\nis the use of minute lattice distortions occurring at the heterojunction due to\nthe lattice mismatch, which enables us to create and localize hyperpolarization\nat the heterojunction and distinguish it from the other parts. In particular,\nthe suppression of nuclear spin diffusion by the spatial variation in the\nstrain and the resultant unexpectedly stable hyperpolarization at the\nheterojunction are the keys to successful detection.\n", "  Strong decays of $\\Xi_c$ baryons with radial or orbital excitations with\npositive parity have been studied in a $^3P_0$ model. As candidates of these\n$Xi_c$, possible configurations and $J^P$ of $\\Xi_c(2930)$, $\\Xi_c(2980)$,\n$\\Xi_c(3055)$, $\\Xi_c(3080)$ and $\\Xi_c(3123)$ have been assigned. There are\n$40$ kinds of configurations to describe these excited $\\Xi_c$. In these\nassignments, $\\Xi_c(2930)$ may be a $2S$-wave excited\n$\\tilde{\\Xi}_{c1}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$ or $\\tilde{\\Xi}_{c1}(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$, or a\n$D$-wave excited $\\hat\\Xi_{c1}^{' }(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$, $\\check\\Xi_{c1}^{\\\n0}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$, $\\check\\Xi_{c1}^{\\ 2}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$, $\\hat\\Xi_{c1}^{'\n}(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$, $\\check\\Xi_{c1}^{\\ 0}(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$ or $\\check\\Xi_{c1}^{\\\n2}(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$. $\\Xi_c(2980)^+$ may be a $2S$-wave excited\n$\\tilde{\\Xi}_{c1}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$ or $\\tilde{\\Xi}_{c0}^{'}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$ with\n$J^P={1\\over 2}^+$, or a $D$-wave excited $\\check\\Xi_{c0}^{'0}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$\nor $\\check\\Xi_{c1}^{\\ 0}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$ with $J^P={1\\over 2}^+$.\n$\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ may be a $2S$-wave excited\n$\\acute{\\Xi}_{c1}^{'}(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$ or $\\acute{\\Xi}_{c0}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$. It\nmay be a $D$-wave excited $\\Xi_{c1}^{' }(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$, $\\Xi_{c2}^{'\n}(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$, $\\Xi_{c2}^{ }(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$ or $\\Xi_{c2}^{\n}(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$. $\\Xi_c(3080)^+$ is very possibly a $2S$-wave excited\n$\\acute{\\Xi}_{c0}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$, and seems not a $D$-wave excitation of\n$\\Xi_c$. For the poor experimental information of $\\Xi_c(3123)$, it is\nimpossible to identify this state at present. It is found that the channel\n$\\Lambda D$ vanishes in the strong decay of $P$-wave, $D$-wave and $2S$-wave\nexcited $\\Xi_c$ without $\\rho$- mode excitation between the two light quarks\n($n_\\rho=L_\\rho=0$). Some branching fraction ratios have been computed and can\nbe employed to distinguish different configurations in forthcoming experiments.\n", "  The 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope K-band (KFPA) receiver was used\nto perform a high-sensitivity search for rotational emission lines from complex\norganic molecules in the cold interstellar medium towards TMC-1 (cyanopolyyne\npeak), focussing on the identification of new carbon-chain-bearing species as\nwell as molecules of possible prebiotic relevance. We report a detection of the\ncarbon-chain oxide species HC$_7$O and derive a column density of\n$(7.8\\pm0.9)\\times10^{11}$~cm$^{-2}$. This species is theorized to form as a\nresult of associative electron detachment reactions between oxygen atoms and\nC$_7$H$^-$, and/or reaction of C$_6$H$_2$$^+$ with CO (followed by dissociative\nelectron recombination). Upper limits are given for the related HC$_6$O, C$_6$O\nand C$_7$O molecules. In addition, we obtained the first detections of emission\nfrom individual $^{13}$C isotopologues of HC$_7$N, and derive abundance ratios\nHC$_7$N/HCCC$^{13}$CCCCN = $110\\pm16$ and HC$_7$N/HCCCC$^{13}$CCCN = $96\\pm\n11$, indicative of significant $^{13}$C depletion in this species relative to\nthe local interstellar elemental $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of 60-70. The observed\nspectral region covered two transitions of HC$_{11}$N, but emission from this\nspecies was not detected, and the corresponding column density upper limit is\n$7.4\\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ (at 95% confidence). This is significantly lower\nthan the value of $2.8\\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ previously claimed by Bell et\nal. (1997) and confirms the recent non-detection of HC$_{11}$N in TMC-1 by\nLoomis et al. (2016). Upper limits were also obtained for the column densities\nof malononitrile and the nitrogen heterocycles quinoline, isoquinoline and\npyrimidine.\n", "  We report the detection of extended Lyman-alpha (Lya) haloes around 145\nindividual star-forming galaxies at redshifts 3<z<6 in the Hubble Ultra Deep\nField observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer at ESO-VLT. Our\nsample consists of continuum-faint (-15> M_{UV}> -22) Lya emitters (LAEs).\nUsing a 2D, two-component decomposition of Lya emission assuming circular\nexponential distributions, we measure scale lengths and luminosities of Lya\nhaloes. We find that 80% of our objects having reliable Lya halo measurements\nshow Lya emission that is significantly more extended than the UV continuum\ndetected by HST (by a factor ~4 to >20). The median exponential scale length of\nthe Lya haloes in our sample is ~4.5 kpc. By comparing the maximal detected\nextent of the Lya emission with the predicted dark matter halo virial radii of\nsimulated galaxies, we show that the detected Lya emission of our selected\nsample of LAEs probes a significant portion of the cold circum-galactic medium\n(CGM) of these galaxies (>50% in average). This result shows that there must be\nsignificant HI reservoirs in the CGM and reinforces the idea that Lya haloes\nare ubiquitous around high-redshift Lya emitting galaxies. Our characterization\nof the Lya haloes indicates that the majority of the Lya flux comes from the\nhalo (~65%) and that their scale lengths seem to be linked to the UV properties\nof the galaxies. We do not observe a significant Lya halo size evolution with\nredshift. We also find that the Lya lines cover a large range of full width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) from 118 to 512 km/s. While the FWHM does not seem to be\ncorrelated to the Lya scale length, most compact Lya haloes and those that are\nnot detected with high significance tend to have narrower Lya profiles.\nFinally, we investigate the origin of the extended Lya emission but we conclude\nthat our data do not allow us to disentangle the possible processes.\n", "  The invariants of an attractor have been the most used resource to\ncharacterize a nonlinear dynamics. Their estimation is a challenging endeavor\nin short-time series and/or in presence of noise. In this article we present\ntwo new coarse-grained estimators for the correlation dimension and for the\ncorrelation entropy. They can be easily estimated from the calculation of two\nU-correlation integrals. We have also developed an algorithm that is able to\nautomatically obtain these invariants and the noise level in order to process\nlarge data sets. This method has been statistically tested through simulations\nin low-dimensional systems. The results show that it is robust in presence of\nnoise and short data lengths. In comparison with similar approaches, our\nalgorithm outperforms the estimation of the correlation entropy.\n", "  Complex organic molecules have been observed for decades in the interstellar\nmedium. Some of them might be considered as small bricks of the macromolecules\nat the base of terrestrial life. It is hence particularly important to\nunderstand organic chemistry in Solar-like star forming regions. In this\narticle, we present a new observational project: SOLIS (Seeds Of Life In\nSpace). This is a Large Project at the IRAM-NOEMA interferometer, and its scope\nis to image the emission of several crucial organic molecules in a sample of\nSolar-like star forming regions in different evolutionary stage and\nenvironments. Here, we report the first SOLIS results, obtained from analysing\nthe spectra of different regions of the Class 0 source NGC1333-IRAS4A, the\nprotocluster OMC-2 FIR4, and the shock site L1157-B1. The different regions\nwere identified based on the images of formamide (NH2CHO) and cyanodiacetylene\n(HC5N) lines. We discuss the observed large diversity in the molecular and\norganic content, both on large (3000-10000 au) and relatively small (300-1000\nau) scales. Finally, we derive upper limits to the methoxy fractional abundance\nin the three observed regions of the same order of magnitude of that measured\nin few cold prestellar objects, namely ~10^-12-10^-11 with respect to H2\nmolecules.\n", "  Multi-epoch observations with ACS and WFC3 on HST provide a unique and\ncomprehensive probe of stellar dynamics within 47 Tucanae. We confront analytic\nmodels of the globular cluster with the observed stellar proper motions that\nprobe along the main sequence from just above 0.8 to 0.1M$_\\odot$ as well as\nwhite dwarfs younger than one gigayear. One field lies just beyond the\nhalf-light radius where dynamical models (\\eg lowered Maxwellian distributions)\nmake robust predictions for the stellar proper motions. The observed proper\nmotions in this outer field show evidence for anisotropy in the velocity\ndistribution as well as skewness; the latter is evidence of rotation. The\nmeasured velocity dispersions and surface brightness distributions agree in\ndetail with a rotating, anisotropic model of the stellar distribution function\nwith mild dependence of the proper-motion dispersion on mass. However, the best\nfitting models under-predict the rotation and skewness of the stellar\nvelocities. In the second field, centered on the core of the cluster, the mass\nsegregation in proper motion is much stronger. Nevertheless the model developed\nin the outer field can be extended inward by taking this mass segregation into\naccount in a heuristic fashion. The proper motions of the main-sequence stars\nyield a mass estimate of the cluster of $1.31 \\pm 0.02 \\times 10^6\n\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ at a distance of 4.7 kpc. By comparing the proper motions of\na sample of giant and sub-giant stars with the observed radial velocities we\nestimate the distance to the cluster kinematically to be $4.29 \\pm 0.47$ kpc.\n", "  Nonlinear electrostatic interaction between the surface ions of\nelectrochemical nature and ferroelectric dipoles gives rise to the coupled\nferroionic states in nanoscale ferroelectrics. Here, we investigated the role\nof the surface ions formation energy value on the polarization states and\npolarization reversal mechanisms, domain structure and corresponding phase\ndiagrams of ferroelectric thin films. Using 3D finite elements modeling we\nanalyze the distribution and hysteresis loops of ferroelectric polarization and\nionic charge, and dynamics of the domain states. These calculations performed\nover large parameter space delineate the regions of single- and poly- domain\nferroelectric, ferroionic, antiferroionic and non-ferroelectric states as a\nfunction of surface ions formation energy, film thickness, applied voltage and\ntemperature. We further map the analytical theory for 1D system onto effective\nLandau-Ginzburg free energy and establish the correspondence between the 3D\nnumerical and 1D analytical results. This approach allows performing the\noverview of the phase diagrams of ferroionic systems and exploring the specific\nof switching and domain evolution phenomena.\n", "  We have obtained single-phase near-infrared (NIR) magnitudes in the J- and\nK-bands for 77 RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. We\nhave used different theoretical and empirical NIR period-luminosity-metallicity\ncalibrations for RRL stars to derive their absolute magnitudes, and found a\ntrue, reddening-corrected distance modulus of 20.818 +/- 0.015 (statistical)\n+/- 0.116 (systematic) mag. This value is in excellent agreement with the\nresults obtained within the Araucaria Project from the NIR photometry of red\nclump stars (20.858 +/- 0.013 mag), the tip of the red giant branch (20.84 +/-\n0.04 +/- 0.14 mag), as well as with other independent distance determinations\nto this galaxy. The effect of metallicity and reddening is substantially\nreduced in the NIR domain, making this method a robust tool for accurate\ndistance determination at the 5 percent level. This precision is expected to\nreach the level of 3 percent once the zero points of distance calibrations are\nrefined thanks to the Gaia mission. NIR period-luminosity-metallicity relations\nof RRL stars are particularly useful for distance determinations to galaxies\nand globular clusters up to 300 kpc, that lack young standard candles, like\nCepheids.\n", "  Bell's theorem is reformulated and proved in the pure mathematical terms of\nautomata theory, avoiding any physical or ontological notions. It is stated\nthat no pair of finite probabilistic sequential machines can reproduce in its\noutput the statistical results of the quantum-physical Bell test experiment if\neach machine is independent of the respective remote input.\n", "  We investigate regular and chaotic two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional\n(3D) orbits of stars in models of a galactic potential consisting in a disk, a\nhalo and a bar, to find the origin of boxy components, which are part of the\nbar or (almost) the bar itself. Our models originate in snapshots of an N-body\nsimulation, which develops a strong bar. We consider three snapshots of the\nsimulation and for the orbital study we treat each snapshot independently, as\nan autonomous Hamiltonian system. The calculated corotation-to-bar-length\nratios indicate that in all three cases the bar rotates slowly, while the\norientation of the orbits of the main family of periodic orbits changes along\nits characteristic. We characterize the orbits as regular, sticky, or chaotic\nafter integrating them for a 10 Gyr period by using the GALI$_2$ index.\nBoxiness in the equatorial plane is associated either with quasi-periodic\norbits in the outer parts of stability islands, or with sticky orbits around\nthem, which can be found in a large range of energies. We indicate the location\nof such orbits in diagrams, which include the characteristic of the main\nfamily. They are always found about the transition region from order to chaos.\nBy perturbing such orbits in the vertical direction we find a class of 3D\nnon-periodic orbits, which have boxy projections both in their face-on and\nside-on views.\n", "  Upon its discovery in 2006, the young L7.5 companion to the solar analog HD\n203030 was found to be unusual in being $\\approx$200 K cooler than older late-L\ndwarfs. HD 203030B offered the first clear indication that the effective\ntemperature at the L-to-T spectral type transition depends on surface gravity:\nnow a well-known characteristic of low-gravity ultra-cool dwarfs. An initial\nage analysis of the G8V primary star indicated that the system was 130--400 Myr\nold, and so the companion between 12--31 $M_{\\rm Jup}$. Using moderate\nresolution near-infrared spectra of HD 203030B, we now find features of very\nlow gravity comparable to those of 10--150 Myr-old L7--L8 dwarfs. We also\nobtained more accurate near infrared and {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC photometry, and\nfind a $(J-K)_{\\rm MKO}$ color of $2.56\\pm0.13$ mag---comparable to those\nobserved in other young planetary-mass objects---and a luminosity of\nlog($L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\odot}$)$\\,=\\,-4.75\\pm0.04$ dex. We further reassess the\nevidence for the young age of the host star, HD 203030, with a more\ncomprehensive analysis of the photometry and updated stellar activity\nmeasurements and age calibrations. Summarizing the age diagnostics for both\ncomponents of the binary, we adopt an age of 100 Myr for HD 203030B and an age\nrange of 30--150 Myr. Using cloudy evolutionary models, the new companion age\nrange and luminosity result in a mass of 11 $M_{\\rm Jup}$ with a range of 8--15\n$M_{\\rm Jup}$, and an effective temperature of $1040\\pm50$ K.\n", "  Recent observational work has indicated that mechanisms for accretion and\noutflow in Herbig Ae/Be star-disk systems may differ from magnetospheric\naccretion (MA) as it is thought to occur in T Tauri star-disk systems. In this\nwork, we assess the temporal evolution of spectral lines probing accretion and\nmass loss in Herbig Ae/Be systems and test for consistency with the MA\nparadigm. For two Herbig Ae/Be stars, HD 98922 (B9e) and V1295 Aql (A2e), we\nhave gathered multi-epoch (~years) and high-cadence (~minutes) high-resolution\noptical spectra to probe a wide range of kinematic processes. Employing a line\nequivalent width evolution correlation metric introduced here, we identify\nspecies co-evolving (indicative of common line origin) via novel visualization.\nWe interferometrically constrain often problematically degenerate parameters,\ninclination and inner disk radius, allowing us to focus on the structure of the\nwind, magnetosphere, and inner gaseous disk in radiative transfer models. Over\nall timescales sampled, the strongest variability occurs within the blueshifted\nabsorption components of the Balmer series lines; the strength of variability\nincreases with the cadence of the observations. Finally, high-resolution\nspectra allow us to probe substructure within the Balmer series' blueshifted\nabsorption components: we observe static, low-velocity features and\ntime-evolving features at higher velocities. Overall, we find the observed line\nmorphologies and variability are inconsistent with a scaled-up T Tauri MA\nscenario. We suggest that as magnetic field structure and strength change\ndramatically with increasing stellar mass from T Tauri to Herbig Ae/Be stars,\nso too may accretion and outflow processes.\n", "  We derive a formalism to describe the scattering of polarized radiation over\nthe full spectral range encompassed by atomic transitions belonging to the same\nspectral series (e.g., the H I Lyman and Balmer series, the UV multiplets of Fe\nI and Fe II). This allows us to study the role of radiation-induced coherence\namong the upper terms of the spectral series, and its contribution to Rayleigh\nscattering and the polarization of the solar continuum. We rely on previous\ntheoretical results for the emissivity of a three-term atom of the\n$\\Lambda$-type taking into account partially coherent scattering, and\ngeneralize its expression in order to describe a \"multiple $\\Lambda$\" atomic\nsystem underlying the formation of a spectral series. Our study shows that\nimportant polarization effects must be expected because of the combined action\nof partial frequency redistribution and radiation-induced coherence among the\nterms of the series. In particular, our model predicts the correct asymptotic\nlimit of 100% polarization in the far wings of a \\emph{complete} (i.e., $\\Delta\nL=0,\\pm 1$) group of transitions, which must be expected on the basis of the\nprinciple of spectroscopic stability.\n", "  Our understanding of the brown dwarf population in star forming regions is\ndependent on knowing distances and proper motions, and therefore will be\nimproved through the Gaia space mission. In this paper, we select new samples\nof very low mass objects (VLMOs) in Upper Scorpius using UKIDSS colors and\noptimised proper motions calculated using Gaia DR1. The scatter in proper\nmotions from VLMOs in Upper Scorpius is now (for the first time) dominated by\nthe kinematic spread of the region itself, not by the positional uncertainties.\nWith age and mass estimates updated using Gaia parallaxes for early type stars\nin the same region, we determine masses for all VLMOs. Our final most complete\nsample includes 453 VLMOs of which $\\sim$125 are expected to be brown dwarfs.\nThe cleanest sample is comprised of 131 VLMOs, with $\\sim$105 brown dwarfs. We\nalso compile a joint sample from the literature which includes 415 VLMOs, out\nof which 152 are likely brown dwarfs. The disc fraction among low-mass brown\ndwarfs ($M<0.05 M_{\\odot}$) is substantially higher than in more massive\nobjects, indicating that discs around low-mass brown dwarfs survive longer than\nin low-mass stars overall. The mass function for $0.01<M<0.1$ $M_{\\odot}$ is\nconsistent with the Kroupa IMF. We investigate the possibility that some\n'proper motion outliers' have undergone a dynamical ejection early in their\nevolution. Our analysis shows that the color-magnitude cuts used when selecting\nsamples introduce strong bias into the population statistics due to varying\nlevel of contamination and completeness.\n", "  HD 100546 is one of the few known pre-main-sequence stars that may host a\nplanetary system in its disk. We analyze new VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric\nimages of HD 100546 with filters in H$\\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum. We\nhave probed the disk gap and the surface layers of the outer disk, covering a\nregion < 500 mas (< 55 au at 109 pc) from the star, at an angular resolution of\n~ 20 mas. Our data show an asymmetry: the SE and NW regions of the outer disk\nare more polarized than the SW and NE. This can be explained from a\npreferential scattering angle close to 90$^o$, consistent with previous\npolarization images. The outer disk extends from 13 $\\pm$ 2 to 45 $\\pm$ 9 au,\nwith a position angle and inclination of 137 $\\pm$ 5$^o$ and 44 $\\pm$ 8$^o$.\nThe comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could\nincrease with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements\nare still consistent within the error bars. In addition, no direct signature of\nthe innermost candidate companion is detected from polarimetry, confirming\nrecent results based on intensity imagery. We set an upper limit to its mass\naccretion rate < 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr for a sub-stellar mass of\n15M$_{Jup}$. Finally, we report the first detection (> 3$\\sigma$) of a ~ 20 au\nbar-like structure that crosses the gap through the central region of HD\n100546. It is tentatively suggested that the bar could be dust dragged by\ninfalling gas that radially flows from the outer disk. This could represent an\nexceptional case in which a small-scale radial inflow is observed in a single\nsystem. If this scenario is confirmed, it could explain the presence of atomic\ngas in the inner disk that would otherwise accrete on to the central star on a\ntimescale of a few months/years, as previously indicated from\nspectro-interferometric data, and could be related with additional (undetected)\nplanets.\n", "  Solar flare ribbons provide an important clue to the magnetic reconnection\nprocess and associated magnetic field topology in the solar corona. We detected\na large-scale secondary flare ribbon of a circular shape that developed in\nassociation with two successive M-class flares and one CME. The ribbon revealed\ninteresting properties such as 1) a quasi-circular shape and enclosing the\ncentral active region; 2) the size as large as 500\\arcsec\\, by 650\\arcsec\\,, 3)\nsuccessive brightenings in the clockwise direction at a speed of \\kms{160}\nstarting from the nearest position to the flaring sunspots, 4) radial\ncontraction and expansion in the northern and the southern part, respectively\nat speeds of $\\leq$ \\kms{10}. Using multi-wavelength data from \\textit{SDO},\n\\textit{RHESSI}, XRT, and Nobeyama, along with magnetic field extrapolations,\nwe found that: 1) the secondary ribbon location is consistent with the field\nline footpoints of a fan-shaped magnetic structure that connects the flaring\nregion and the ambient decaying field; 2) the second M2.6 flare occurred when\nthe expanding coronal loops driven by the first M2.0 flare encountered the\nbackground decayed field. 3) Immediately after the second flare, the secondary\nribbon developed along with dimming regions. Based on our findings, we suggest\nthat interaction between the expanding sigmoid field and the overlying\nfan-shaped field triggered the secondary reconnection that resulted in the\nfield opening and formation of the quasi-circular secondary ribbon. We thus\nconclude that interaction between the active region and the ambient large-scale\nfields should be taken into account to fully understand the entire eruption\nprocess.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to investigate the physical nature of galaxies in\nthe redshift range $0.02<z<0.15$ that have strong excess emission at mid-IR\nwavelengths and to determine whether they host a population of accreting black\nholes that cannot be identified using optical emission lines. We show that at\nfixed stellar mass $M_*$ and $D_n(4000)$, the distribution of [3.4]-[4.6]\n$\\mu$m (WISE W1-W2 band) colours is sharply peaked, with a long tail to much\nredder W1-W2 colours. We introduce a procedure to pull out the red outlier\npopulation based on a combination of three stellar population diagnostics. When\ncompared with optically-selected AGN, red outliers are more likely to be found\nin massive galaxies, and they tend to have lower stellar mass densities,\nyounger stellar ages and higher dust content than optically-selected AGN hosts.\nThey are twice as likely to be detected at radio wavelengths. We examine W1-W2\ncolour profiles for a subset of the nearest, reddest outliers and find that\nmost are not centrally peaked, indicating that the hot dust emission is spread\nthroughout the galaxy. We find that radio luminosity is the quantity that is\nmost predictive of a redder central W1-W2 colour. Radio-loud galaxies with\ncentrally concentrated hot dust emission are almost always morphologically\ndisturbed, with compact, unresolved emission at 1.4 Ghz. Eighty percent of such\nsystems are identifiable as AGN using optical emission line diagnostics.\n", "  Dim red aurora at low magnetic latitudes is a visual and recognized\nmanifestation of geomagnetic storms. The great low-latitude auroral displays\nseen throughout East Asia on 16-18 September 1770 are considered to manifest\none of the greatest storms. Recently found 111 historical documents in East\nAsia attest that these low-latitude auroral displays were succeeding for almost\n9 nights during 10-19 September 1770 in the lowest magnetic latitude areas (<\n30{\\deg}). This suggests that the duration of the great magnetic storm is much\nlonger than usual. Sunspot drawings from 1770 reveals the fact that sunspots\narea was twice as large as those observed in another great storm of 1859, which\nsubstantiates this unusual storm activities in 1770. These spots likely ejected\nseveral huge, sequential magnetic structures in short duration into\ninterplanetary space, resulting in spectacular world-wide aurorae in\nmid-September 1770. These findings provide new insights about the history,\nduration, and effects of extreme magnetic storms that may be valuable for those\nwho need to mitigate against extreme events.\n", "  We consider whether the asymptotic distributions for the log-likelihood ratio\ntest statistic are expected to be Gaussian or chi-squared. Two straightforward\nexamples provide insight on the difference.\n", "  The chemical composition of stars that have orbiting planets provides\nimportant clues about the frequency, architecture, and composition of exoplanet\nsystems. We explore the possibility that stars from different galactic\npopulations that have different intrinsic abundance ratios may produce planets\nwith a different overall composition. We compiled abundances for Fe, O, C, Mg,\nand Si in a large sample of solar neighbourhood stars that belong to different\ngalactic populations. We then used a simple stoichiometric model to predict the\nexpected iron-to-silicate mass fraction and water mass fraction of the planet\nbuilding blocks, as well as the summed mass percentage of all heavy elements in\nthe disc. Assuming that overall the chemical composition of the planet building\nblocks will be reflected in the composition of the formed planets, we show that\naccording to our model, discs around stars from different galactic populations,\nas well as around stars from different regions in the Galaxy, are expected to\nform rocky planets with significantly different iron-to-silicate mass\nfractions. The available water mass fraction also changes significantly from\none galactic population to another. The results may be used to set constraints\nfor models of planet formation and chemical composition. Furthermore, the\nresults may have impact on our understanding of the frequency of planets in the\nGalaxy, as well as on the existence of conditions for habitability.\n", "  We perform a short comparison between the local and linear constitutive\ntensor $\\chi^{\\lambda\\nu\\sigma\\kappa}$ in four-dimensional electrodynamics\n(Sec.2), the elasticity tensor $c^{ijkl}$ in three-dimensional elasticity\ntheory (Sec.3), and the DeWitt metric $G^{abcd}$ in general relativity, with\n${a,b,\\dots=1,2,3}$ (Sec.4). We find that the DeWitt metric has only six\nindependent components.\n", "  We present $^{77}$Se-NMR measurements on single-crystalline FeSe under\npressures up to 2 GPa. Based on the observation of the splitting and broadening\nof the NMR spectrum due to structural twin domains, we discovered that static,\nlocal nematic ordering exists well above the bulk nematic ordering temperature,\n$T_{\\rm s}$. The static, local nematic order and the low-energy stripe-type\nantiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, as revealed by NMR spin-lattice relaxation\nrate measurements, are both insensitive to pressure application. These NMR\nresults provide clear evidence for the microscopic cooperation between\nmagnetism and local nematicity in FeSe.\n", "  We follow the eruption of two related intermediate filaments observed in\nH$\\alpha$ (from GONG) and in EUV (from SDO/AIA) and the resulting\nlarge-amplitude longitudinal oscillations of the plasma in the filament\nchannels. The events occurred in and around the decayed active region AR12486\non 2016 January 26. Our detailed study of the oscillation reveals that the\nperiods of the oscillations are about one hour. In H$\\alpha$ the period\ndecreases with time and exhibits strong damping. The analysis of 171~\\AA\\\nimages shows that the oscillation has two phases, an initial long period phase\nand a subsequent oscillation with a shorter period. In this wavelength the\ndamping appears weaker than in H$\\alpha$. The velocity is the largest ever\ndetected in a prominence oscillation, approximately 100 $\\mathrm{\\, km \\,\ns^{-1}}$. Using SDO/HMI magnetograms we reconstruct the magnetic field of the\nfilaments modeled as flux ropes by using a flux-rope insertion method. Applying\nseismological techniques we determine that the radii of curvature of the field\nlines in which cool plasma is condensed are in the range 75-120~Mm, in\nagreement with the reconstructed field. In addition, we infer a field strength\nof $\\ge7$ to 30 gauss, depending on the electron density assumed; that is also\nin agreement with the values from the reconstruction (8-20 gauss). The poloidal\nflux is zero and the axis flux is of the order of 10$^{20}$ to 10$^{21}$ Mx,\nconfirming the high shear existing even in a non-active filament.\n", "  We present observations with the Submillimeter Array of the continuum\nemission at $\\lambda = 1.3$ mm from 62 young stars surrounded by a\nprotoplanetary disk in the Serpens star-forming region. The typical angular\nresolution for the survey in terms of beam size is $3.5^{\\prime\n\\prime}\\times2.5^{\\prime \\prime}$ with a median rms noise level of 1.6 mJy\nbeam$^{-1}$. These data are used to infer the dust content in disks around\nlow-mass stars $(0.1$-$2.5\\,M_{\\odot})$ at a median stellar age of $1$-$3$ Myr.\nThirteen sources were detected in the 1.3 mm dust continuum with inferred dust\nmasses of ${\\approx} 10$-$260\\,M_{\\oplus}$ and an upper limit to the median\ndust mass of $5.1_{-4.3}^{+6.1}\\,M_{\\oplus}$, derived using survival analysis.\nComparing the protoplanetary disk population in Serpens to those of other\nnearby star-forming regions, we find that the populations of dust disks in\nSerpens and Taurus, which have a similar age, are statistically\nindistinguishable. This is potentially surprising since Serpens has a stellar\nsurface density two orders of magnitude in excess of Taurus. Hence, we find no\nevidence that dust disks in Serpens have been dispersed as a result of more\nfrequent and/or stronger tidal interactions due its elevated stellar density.\nWe also report that the fraction of Serpens disks with $M_{\\rm{dust}} \\geq\n10\\,M_{\\oplus}$ is less than 20%, which supports the notion that the formation\nof giant planets is likely inherently rare or has substantially progressed by a\nfew Myrs.\n", "  A main goal of NASA's Kepler Mission is to establish the frequency of\npotentially habitable Earth-size planets (eta Earth). Relatively few such\ncandidates identified by the mission can be confirmed to be rocky via dynamical\nmeasurement of their mass. Here we report an effort to validate 18 of them\nstatistically using the BLENDER technique, by showing that the likelihood they\nare true planets is far greater than that of a false positive. Our analysis\nincorporates follow-up observations including high-resolution optical and\nnear-infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and information from the\nanalysis of the flux centroids of the Kepler observations themselves. While\nmany of these candidates have been previously validated by others, the\nconfidence levels reported typically ignore the possibility that the planet may\ntransit a different star than the target along the same line of sight. If that\nwere the case, a planet that appears small enough to be rocky may actually be\nconsiderably larger and therefore less interesting from the point of view of\nhabitability. We take this into consideration here, and are able to validate 15\nof our candidates at a 99.73% (3 sigma) significance level or higher, and the\nother three at slightly lower confidence. We characterize the GKM host stars\nusing available ground-based observations and provide updated parameters for\nthe planets, with sizes between 0.8 and 2.9 Earth radii. Seven of them\n(KOI-0438.02, 0463.01, 2418.01, 2626.01, 3282.01, 4036.01, and 5856.01) have a\nbetter than 50% chance of being smaller than 2 Earth radii and being in the\nhabitable zone of their host stars.\n", "  Observations of exoplanet transit spectra are essential to understanding the\nphysics and chemistry of distant worlds. The effects of opacity sources and\nmany physical processes combine to set the shape of a transit spectrum. Two\nsuch key processes - refraction and cloud and/or haze forward scattering - have\nseen substantial recent study. However, models of these processes are typically\ncomplex, which prevents their incorporation into observational analyses and\nstandard transit spectrum tools. In this work, we develop analytic expressions\nthat allow for the efficient parameterization of forward scattering and\nrefraction effects in transit spectra. We derive an effective slant optical\ndepth that includes a correction for forward scattered light, and present an\nanalytic form of this correction. We validate our correction against a\nfull-physics transit spectrum model that includes scattering, and we explore\nthe extent to which the omission of forward scattering effects may bias models.\nAlso, we verify a common analytic expression for the location of a refractive\nboundary, which we express in terms of the maximum pressure probed in a transit\nspectrum. This expression is designed to be easily incorporated into existing\ntools, and we discuss how the detection of a refractive boundary could help\nindicate the background atmospheric composition by constraining the bulk\nrefractivity of the atmosphere. Finally, we show that opacity from Rayleigh\nscattering and collision induced absorption will outweigh the effects of\nrefraction for Jupiter-like atmospheres whose equilibrium temperatures are\nabove 400-500 K.\n", "  By linking widely separated radio dishes, the technique of very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) can greatly enhance angular resolution in radio\nastronomy. However, at any given moment, a VLBI array only sparsely samples the\ninformation necessary to form an image. Conventional imaging techniques\npartially overcome this limitation by making the assumption that the observed\ncosmic source structure does not evolve over the duration of an observation,\nwhich enables VLBI networks to accumulate information as the Earth rotates and\nchanges the projected array geometry. Although this assumption is appropriate\nfor nearly all VLBI, it is almost certainly violated for submillimeter\nobservations of the Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*\n(Sgr A*), which has a gravitational timescale of only ~20 seconds and exhibits\nintra-hour variability. To address this challenge, we develop several\ntechniques to reconstruct dynamical images (\"movies\") from interferometric\ndata. Our techniques are applicable to both single-epoch and multi-epoch\nvariability studies, and they are suitable for exploring many different\nphysical processes including flaring regions, stable images with small\ntime-dependent perturbations, steady accretion dynamics, or kinematics of\nrelativistic jets. Moreover, dynamical imaging can be used to estimate\ntime-averaged images from time-variable data, eliminating many spurious image\nartifacts that arise when using standard imaging methods. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our techniques using synthetic observations of simulated black\nhole systems and 7mm Very Long Baseline Array observations of M87, and we show\nthat dynamical imaging is feasible for Event Horizon Telescope observations of\nSgr A*.\n", "  The recently discovered minor body 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua) is the first known\nobject in our Solar System that is not bound by the Sun's gravity. Its\nhyperbolic orbit (eccentricity greater than unity) strongly suggests that it\noriginated outside our Solar System; its red color is consistent with\nsubstantial space weathering experienced over a long interstellar journey. We\ncarry out an simple calculation of the probability of detecting such an object.\nWe find that the observed detection rate of 1I-like objects can be satisfied if\nthe average mass of ejected material from nearby stars during the process of\nplanetary formation is ~20 Earth masses, similar to the expected value for our\nSolar System. The current detection rate of such interstellar interlopers is\nestimated to be 0.2/year, and the expected number of detections over the past\nfew years is almost exactly one. When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\nbegins its wide, fast, deep all-sky survey the detection rate will increase to\n1/year. Those expected detections will provide further constraints on nearby\nplanetary system formation through a better estimate of the number and\nproperties of interstellar objects.\n", "  We present a Chandra Director's Discretionary Time observation of PSR\nJ1119-6127 and its compact X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) obtained on 27\nOctober 2016, three months after the Fermi and Swift detection of millisecond\nbursts in hard X-rays, accompanied by >160 times increase in flux. This\nmagnetar-like activity, the first observed from a rotation-powered radio\npulsar, provides an important probe of the physical processes that\ndifferentiate radio pulsars from magnetars. The post-burst X-ray spectrum of\nthe pulsar can be described by a single powerlaw model with a photon index of\n2.0\\pm0.2 and an unabsorbed flux of 5.7e-12 ergs/cm^2/s in the 0.5-7.0 keV\nenergy range. At the time of Chandra observations, the pulsar was still\nbrighter by a factor of ~22 in comparison with its quiescence. The X-ray images\nreveal a nebula brighter than in the pre-burst Chandra observations (from 2002\nand 2004), with an unabsorbed flux of 2.2e-13 ergs/cm^-2/s. This implies a\ncurrent X-ray efficiency of ~0.001 at a distance of 8.4 kpc. In addition, a\nfaint torus-like structure is visible along the southeast-northwest direction\nand a jet-like feature perpendicular to the torus towards the southwest. The\nPWN is best fitted by an absorbed powerlaw with a photon index of 2.2\\pm0.5\n(post-burst). While the pulsar can still be energetically powered by rotation,\nthe observed changes in PSR~J1119-6127 and its PWN following the magnetar-like\nbursts point to an additional source of energy powered by its high-magnetic\nfield.\n", "  We present rest-frame Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) of 417 Ly$\\alpha$\nemitters (LAEs) detected with Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the\nVery Large Telescope (VLT) at $2.9 < z < 6.6$ in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.\nBased on the deep MUSE spectroscopy and ancillary Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nphotometry data, we carefully measured EW values taking into account extended\nLy$\\alpha$ emission and UV continuum slopes ($\\beta$). Our LAEs reach\nunprecedented depths, both in Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities and UV absolute\nmagnitudes, from log($L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$/erg s$^{-1}$) $\\sim$41.0 to 43.0 and\nfrom Muv $\\sim$ -16 to -21 (0.01-1.0 $L^{*}_{\\rm z=3}$). The EW values span the\nrange of $\\sim$ 5 to 240 \\AA\\ or larger, and their distribution can be well\nfitted by an exponential law $N = N_{\\rm 0}$ exp($-$EW/$w_{\\rm 0}$). Owing to\nthe high dynamic range in Muv, we find that the scale factor, $w_{\\rm 0}$,\ndepends on Muv in the sense that including fainter Muv objects increases\n$w_{\\rm 0}$, i.e., the Ando effect. The results indicate that selection\nfunctions affect the EW scale factor. Taking these effects into account, we\nfind that our $w_{\\rm 0}$ values are consistent with those in the literature\nwithin $1\\sigma$ uncertainties at $2.9 < z < 6.6$ at a given threshold of Muv\nand $L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$. Interestingly, we find 12 objects with EW $>200$ \\AA\\\nabove $1\\sigma$ uncertainties. Two of these 12 LAEs show signatures of merger\nor AGN activity: the weak CIV $\\lambda 1549$ emission line. For the remaining\n10 very large EW LAEs, we find that the EW values can be reproduced by young\nstellar ages ($< 100$ Myr) and low metallicities ($\\lesssim 0.02$ $Z_{\\rm\n\\odot}$). Otherwise, at least part of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission in these LAEs\nneeds to arise from anisotropic radiative transfer effects, fluorescence by\nhidden AGN or quasi-stellar object activity, or gravitational cooling.\n", "  Measuring the physical properties of galaxies such as redshift frequently\nrequires the use of Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). SED template sets\nare, however, often small in number and cover limited portions of photometric\ncolor space. Here we present a new method to estimate SEDs as a function of\ncolor from a small training set of template SEDs. We first cover the\nmathematical background behind the technique before demonstrating our ability\nto reconstruct spectra based upon colors and then compare to other common\ninterpolation and extrapolation methods. When the photometric filters and\nspectra overlap we show reduction of error in the estimated spectra of over 65%\ncompared to the more commonly used techniques. We also show an expansion of the\nmethod to wavelengths beyond the range of the photometric filters. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the usefulness of our technique by generating 50 additional SED\ntemplates from an original set of 10 and applying the new set to photometric\nredshift estimation. We are able to reduce the photometric redshifts standard\ndeviation by at least 22.0% and the outlier rejected bias by over 86.2%\ncompared to original set for z $\\leq$ 3.\n", "  Assuming that the early optical emission is dominated by the external reverse\nshock (RS) in the standard model of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), we intend to\nconstrain RS models with the initial Lorentz factor $\\Gamma_0$ of the outflows\nbased on the ROTSE-III observations. We consider two cases of the RS behavior:\nthe relativistic shock and the non-relativistic shock. For homogeneous\ninterstellar medium (ISM) and wind circum-burst environment, the constraints\ncan be achieved by the fact that the peak flux $F_{\\rm \\nu}$ at the RS crossing\ntime should be lower than the observed upper limit $F_{\\rm \\nu,limit}$. We\nconsider the different spectral regimes that the observed optical frequency\n$\\nu_{\\rm opt}$ may locate in, which are divided by the orders for the minimum\nsynchrotron frequency $\\nu_{\\rm m}$ and the cooling frequency $\\nu_{\\rm c}$.\n{\\bf Considering the homogeneous and wind environment around GRBs, we find that\nthe relativistic RS case can be constrained by the (upper and lower) limits of\n$\\Gamma_0$ in a large range from about hundreds to thousands for 36 GRBs\nreported by ROTSE-III. The constraints on the non-relativistic RS case are\nachieved with limits of $\\Gamma_0$ for 26 bursts ranging from $\\sim 30$ to\n$\\sim 350$.} The lower limits of $\\Gamma_0$ achieved for the relativistic RS\nmodel is disfavored based on the previously discovered correlation between the\ninitial Lorentz factor $\\Gamma_0$ and the isotropic gamma-ray energy $E_{\\rm\n\\gamma, iso}$ released in prompt phase.\n", "  The inhibition of small-scale convection in the Sun dominates the long-term\nradial velocity (RV) variability: it therefore has a critical effect on light\nexoplanet detectability using RV techniques. We here extend our previous\nanalysis of stellar convective blueshift and its dependence on magnetic\nactivity to a larger sample of stars in order to extend the Teff range, to\nstudy the impact of other stellar properties, and finally to improve the\ncomparison between observed RV jitter and expected RV variations. We estimate a\ndifferential velocity shift for Fe and Ti lines of different depths and derive\nan absolute convective blueshift using the Sun as a reference for a sample of\n360 F7-K4 stars with different properties (age, Teff, metallicity). We confirm\nthe strong variation in convective blueshift with Teff and its dependence on\n(as shown in the line list in Paper I) activity level. Although we do not\nobserve a significant effect of age or cyclic activity, stars with a higher\nmetallicity tend to have a lower convective blueshift, with a larger effect\nthan expected from numerical simulations. Finally, we estimate that for 71% of\nthe stars in our sample the RV and LogR'HK variations are compatible with the\neffect of activity on convection, as observed in the solar case, while for the\nother stars, other sources (such as binarity or companions) must be invoked to\nexplain the large RV variations. We also confirm a relationship between LogR'HK\nand metallicity, which may affect discussions of the possible relationship\nbetween metallicity and exoplanets, as RV surveys are biased toward low LogR'HK\nand possibly toward high-metallicity stars. We conclude that activity and\nmetallicity strongly affect the small-scale convection levels in stars in the\nF7-K4 range, with a lower amplitude for the lower mass stars and a larger\namplitude for low-metallicity stars.\n", "  The reflection spectroscopic model RELXILL is commonly implemented in\nstudying relativistic X-ray reflection from accretion disks around black holes.\nWe present a systematic study of the model's capability to constrain the\ndimensionless spin and ionization parameters from $\\sim$6,000 NuSTAR\nsimulations of a bright X-ray source employing the lamppost geometry. We employ\nhigh count spectra to show the limitations in the model without being confused\nwith limitations in signal-to-noise. We find that both parameters are\nwell-recovered at 90% confidence with improving constraints at higher\nreflection fraction, high spin, and low source height. We test spectra across a\nbroad range - first at 10$^6-$10$^7$ and then $\\sim$10$^5$ total source counts\nacross the effective 3-79 keV band of NuSTAR, and discover a strong dependence\nof the results on how fits are performed around the starting parameters, owing\nto the complexity of the model itself. A blind fit chosen over an approach that\ncarries some estimates of the actual parameter values can lead to significantly\nworse recovery of model parameters. We further stress on the importance to span\nthe space of nonlinear-behaving parameters like $log~\\xi$ carefully and\nthoroughly for the model to avoid misleading results. In light of selecting\nfitting procedures, we recall the necessity to pay attention to the choice of\ndata binning and fit statistics used to test the goodness of fit by\ndemonstrating the effect on the photon index $\\Gamma$. We re-emphasize and\nimplore the need to account for the detector resolution while binning X-ray\ndata and using Poisson fit statistics instead while analyzing Poissonian data.\n", "  This paper explores the uniqueness of ESA Rosetta mission operations from the\nAlice instrument point of view, documents lessons learned, and suggests\noperations ideas for future missions. The Alice instrument mounted on the\nRosetta orbiter is an imaging spectrograph optimized for cometary\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy with the scientific objectives of measuring\nproperties of the escaping gas and dust, and studying the surface properties,\nincluding searching for exposed ices. We describe the operations processes\nduring the comet encounter period, the many interfaces to contend with, the\nconstraints that impacted Alice, and how the Alice science goals of measuring\nthe cometary gas characteristics and their evolution were achieved. We provide\ndetails that are relevant to the use and interpretation of Alice data and\npublished results. All these flight experiences and lessons learned will be\nuseful for future cometary missions that include ultraviolet spectrographs in\nparticular, and multi-instrument international payloads in general.\n", "  Timing analysis provides information about the dynamics of matter accreting\non to neutron stars and black holes, and hence is crucial for studying the\nphysics of the accretion flow around these objects. It is difficult, however,\nto associate the different variability components with each of the spectral\ncomponents of the accretion flow. We apply several new methods to two Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer observations of the black hole binary GRS 1915+105 during\nits heartbeat state to explore the origin of the X-ray variability and the\ninteractions of the accretion-flow components. We offer a promising window into\nthe disc--corona interaction through analysing the formation regions of the\ndisc aperiodic variabilities with different time-scales via comparing the\ncorresponding transition energies of the amplitude-ratio spectra. In a previous\npaper, we analysed the Fourier power density as a function of energy and\nfrequency to study the origin of the aperiodic variability, and combined that\nanalysis with the phase lag as a function of frequency to derive a picture of\nthe disc--corona interaction in this source. We here, for the first time,\ninvestigate the phase lag as a function of energy and frequency, and display\nsome interesting details of the disc--corona interaction. Besides, the results\nfrom the shape of amplitude-ratio spectrum and from several other aspects\nsuggest that the quasi-periodic oscillation originates from the corona.\n", "  Galactic and extragalactic studies have shown that metal-rich globular\nclusters (GCs) are approximately three times more likely to host bright\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) than metal-poor GCs. There is no satisfactory\nexplanation for this metallicity effect. We tested the hypothesis that the\nnumber density of red giant branch (RGB) stars is larger in metal-rich GCs, and\nthus potentially the cause of the metallicity effect. Using Hubble Space\nTelescope photometry for 109 unique Milky Way GCs, we investigated whether RGB\nstar density was correlated with GC metallicity. Isochrone fitting was used to\ncalculate the number of RGB stars, which were normalized by the GC mass and\nfraction of observed GC luminosity, and determined density using the volume at\nthe half-light radius $r_{h}$. The RGB star number density was weakly\ncorrelated with metallicity [Fe/H], giving Spearman and Kendall Rank test\n$p$-values of 0.00016 and 0.00021 and coefficients $r_{s} = 0.35$ and $\\tau =\n0.24$ respectively. This correlation may be biased by a possible dependence of\n$r_{h}$ on [Fe/H], although studies have shown that $r_{h}$ is correlated with\nGalactocentric distance and independent of [Fe/H]. The dynamical origin of the\n$r_{h}$-metallicity correlation (tidal stripping) suggests that metal-rich GCs\nmay have had more active dynamical histories, which would promote LMXB\nformation. No correlation between the RGB star number density and metallicity\nwas found when using only the GCs that hosted quiescent LMXBs. A complete\ncensus of quiescent LMXBs in our Galaxy is needed to further probe the\nmetallicity effect, which will be possible with the upcoming launch of eROSITA.\n", "  Context. RV Tauri-type variables are pulsating post-AGB stars that evolve\nrapidly through the instability strip after leaving the Asymptotic Giant\nBranch. Their light variability is dominated by radial pulsations. Members of\nthe RVb subclass show an additional variability in form of a long-term\nmodulation of the mean brightness, for which the most popular theories all\nassume binarity and some kind of circumstellar dust. Here we address if the\namplitude modulations are consistent with the dust obscuration model. Aims. We\nmeasure and interpret the overall changes of the mean amplitude of the\npulsations along the RVb variability. Methods. We compiled long-term\nphotometric data for RVb-type stars, including visual observations of the\nAmerican Association of Variable Star Observers, ground-based CCD photometry\nfrom the OGLE and ASAS projects and ultra-precise space photometry of one star,\nDF Cygni, from the Kepler space telescope. After converting all the\nobservations to flux units, we measure the cycle-to-cycle variations of the\npulsation amplitude and correlate them to the actual mean fluxes. Results. We\nfind a surprisingly uniform correlation between the pulsation amplitude and the\nmean flux: they scale linearly with each other for a wide range of fluxes and\namplitudes. It means that the pulsation amplitude actually remains constant\nwhen measured relative to the system flux level. The apparent amplitude\ndecrease in the faint states has long been noted in the literature but it was\nalways claimed to be difficult to explain with the actual models of the RVb\nphenomenon. Here we show that when fluxes are used instead of magnitudes, the\namplitude attenuation is naturally explained by periodic obscuration from a\nlarge opaque screen, one most likely corresponding to a circumbinary dusty disk\nthat surrounds the whole system.\n", "  We present a novel strategy to uncover the Galactic population of quiescent\nblack holes (BHs). This is based on a new concept, the photometric mass\nfunction (PMF), which opens up the possibility of an efficient identification\nof dynamical BHs in large fields-of-view. This exploits the width of the disc\nHalpha emission line, combined with orbital period information. We here show\nthat Halpha widths can be recovered using a combination of customized Halpha\nfilters. By setting a width cut-off at 2200 km/s we are able to cleanly remove\nother Galactic populations of Halpha emitters, including ~99.9% of cataclysmic\nvariables (CVs). Only short period (Porb<2.1 h) eclipsing CVs and AGNs will\ncontaminate the sample but these can be easily flagged through photometric\nvariability and, in the latter case, also mid-IR colours. We also describe the\nstrategy of a deep (r=22) Galactic plane survey based on the concept of PMFs:\nHAWKs, the HAlpha-Width Kilo-deg Survey. We estimate that ~800 sqr deg are\nrequired to unveil ~50 new dynamical BHs, a three-fold improvement over the\nknown population. For comparison, a century would be needed to produce an\nenlarged sample of 50 dynamical BHs from X-ray transients at the current\ndiscovery rate.\n", "  We describe a device (adapter) for off-axis guiding and photometric\ncalibration of wide-angle spectrographs operating in the prime focus of the 6-m\ntelescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of\nSciences. To compensate coma in off-axis star images an achromatic lens\ncorrector is used, which ensures maintaining image quality (FWHM) at a level of\nabout 1'' within 15' from the optical axis. The device has two 54'-diameter\nmovable guiding fields, which can move in 10' x 4'.5 rectangular areas. The\ndevice can perform automatic search for guiding stars, use them to control the\nvariations of atmospheric transmittance, and focus the telescope during\nexposure. The limiting magnitude of potential guiding stars is mR ~17 mag. The\ncalibration path whose optical arrangement meets the telecentrism condition\nallows the spectrograph to be illuminated both by a source of line spectrum (a\nHe-Ne-Ar filled lamp) and by a source of continuum spectrum. The latter is\nusually represented either by a halogen lamp or a set of light-emitting diodes,\nwhich provide illumination of approximately uniform intensity over the\nwavelength interval from 350 to 900 nm. The adapter is used for observations\nwith SCORPIO-2 multimode focal reducer.\n", "  Magnetic activity is known to be correlated to the rotation period for\nmoderately active main sequence solar-like stars. In turn, the stellar rotation\nperiod evolves as a result of magnetised stellar winds that carry away angular\nmomentum. Understanding the interplay between magnetic activity and stellar\nrotation is therefore a central task for stellar astrophysics. Angular momentum\nevolution models typically employ spin-down torques that are formulated in\nterms of the surface magnetic field strength. However, these formulations fail\nto account for the magnetic field geometry, unlike those that are expressed in\nterms of the open flux, i.e. the magnetic flux along which stellar winds flow.\n  In this work, we model the angular momentum evolution of main sequence\nsolar-mass stars using a torque law formulated in terms of the open flux. This\nis done using a potential field source surface model in conjunction with the\nZeeman-Doppler magnetograms of a sample of roughly solar-mass stars. We explore\nhow the open flux of these stars varies with stellar rotation and choice of\nsource surface radii. We also explore the effect of field geometry by using two\nmethods of determining the open flux. The first method only accounts for the\ndipole component while the second accounts for the full set of spherical\nharmonics available in the Zeeman-Doppler magnetogram. We find only a small\ndifference between the two methods, demonstrating that the open flux, and\nindeed the spin-down, of main sequence solar-mass stars is likely dominated by\nthe dipolar component of the magnetic field.\n", "  The detection of a kilo/macronova electromagnetic counterpart (AT2017gfo) of\nthe first gravitational wave signal compatible with the merger of two neutron\nstars (GW170817) has confirmed the occurrence of r-process nucleosynthesis in\nthis kind of events. The blue and red components of AT2017gfo have been\ninterpreted as the signature of multi-component ejecta in the merger dynamics.\nHowever, the explanation of AT2017gfo in terms of the properties of the ejecta\nand of the ejection mechanisms is still incomplete. In this work, we analyse\nAT2017gfo with a new semi-analytic model of kilo/macronova inferred from\ngeneral relativistic simulations of the merger and long-term numerical models\nof the merger aftermath. The model accounts for the anisotropic emission from\nthe three known mass ejecta components: dynamic, winds and secular outflows\nfrom the disk. The early multi-band light-curves of AT2017gfo can only be\nexplained by the presence of a relatively low opacity component of the ejecta\nat high latitudes. This points to the key role of weak interactions in setting\nthe ejecta properties and determining the nucleosynthetic yields. Our model\nconstrains also the total ejected mass associated to AT2017gfo to be between\n$0.042$ and $0.077 M_{\\odot}$; the observation angle of the source to be\nbetween $\\pi/12$ and $7\\pi/36 $; and the mass of the disk to be $ \\gtrsim 0.08\nM_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We present comprehensive spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the\ndetached eclipsing binary KIC 12418816, which is composed of two very similar\nand young main sequence stars of spectral type K0 on a circular orbit.\nCombining spectroscopic and photometric modelling, we find masses and radii of\nthe components as 0.88+-0.06 Msun and 0.84+-0.05 Msun, and 0.85+-0.02 Rsun, and\n0.84+-0.02 Rsun for the primary and the secondary, respectively. Both\ncomponents exhibit narrow emission features superposed on the cores of the Ca\nII H&K lines, while H alpha and H beta photospheric absoprtion is more\ncompletely infilled by broader emission. Very high precision Kepler photometry\nreveals remarkable sinusoidal light variation at out-of-eclipse phases,\nindicating strong spot activity, presumably on the surface of the secondary\ncomponent. Spots on the secondary component appear to migrate towards\ndecreasing orbital phases with a migration period of 0.72+-0.05 year. Besides\nthe sinusoidal variation, we detect 81 flares, and find that both components\npossess flare activity. Our analysis shows that 25 flares among 81 come exhibit\nvery high energies with lower frequency, while the rest of them are very\nfrequent with lower energies.\n", "  It is suggested that fast radio bursts can probe gravitational lensing by\nclumpy dark matter objects that range in mass from $10^{-3}M_{\\odot}$ to $10^2\nM_{\\odot}$. They may provide a more sensitive probe than observations of\nlensing of objects in the Magellanic Clouds, and could find or rule out clumpy\ndark matter with an extended mass spectrum.\n", "  The rapid neutron-capture process or r-process is thought to produce the\nmajority of the heavy elements (Z > 30) in extremely metal-poor stars. The same\nprocess is also responsible for a significant fraction of the heavy elements in\nthe Sun. This universality of the r-process is one of its characteristic\nfeatures as well as one of the most important clues to its astrophysical\norigin. We report the discovery of an extremely metal-poor field giant with\n[Sr,Ba/H] $\\approx$ -6.0 and [Sr, Ba/Fe] $\\approx$ -3.0, the lowest abundances\nof strontium and barium relative to iron ever observed. Despite its low\nabundances, the star 2MASS J151113.24-213003.0 has [Sr/Ba] = -0.11 +/- 0.14 and\ntherefore its neutron-capture abundances are consistent with the main solar\nr-process pattern that has [Sr/Ba] = -0.25. It has been suggested that\nextremely low neutron-capture abundances are a characteristic of dwarf\ngalaxies, and we find that this star is on a highly-eccentric orbit with\napocenter $\\gtrsim$100 kpc that lies in the disk of satellites in the halo of\nthe Milky Way. We show that other extremely metal-poor stars with low [Sr,Ba/H]\nand [Sr,Ba/Fe] plus solar [Sr/Ba] tend to have orbits with large apocenters,\nconsistent with a dwarf galaxy origin for this class of object. The\nnucleosynthesis event that produced the neutron-capture elements in 2MASS\nJ151113.24-213003.0 must produce both strontium and barium together in the\nsolar ratio. We exclude contributions from the s-process in intermediate-mass\nAGB or fast-rotating massive metal-poor stars, pair-instability supernovae, the\nweak r-process, and neutron-star mergers. We argue that the event was a Pop III\nor extreme Pop II core-collapse supernova explosion.\n", "  Radial velocity observations from three instruments reveal the presence of a\n4 M_jup planet candidate orbiting the K giant HD 76920. HD 76920b has an\norbital eccentricity of 0.856$\\pm$0.009, making it the most eccentric planet\nknown to orbit an evolved star. There is no indication that HD 76920 has an\nunseen binary companion, suggesting a scattering event rather than Kozai\noscillations as a probable culprit for the observed eccentricity. The candidate\nplanet currently approaches to about four stellar radii from its host star, and\nis predicted to be engulfed on a $\\sim$100 Myr timescale due to the combined\neffects of stellar evolution and tidal interactions.\n", "  We present observations of the interstellar interloper 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua)\ntaken during its 2017 October flyby of Earth. The optical colors B-V =\n0.70$\\pm$0.06, V-R = 0.45$\\pm$0.05, overlap those of the D-type Jovian Trojan\nasteroids and are incompatible with the ultrared objects which are abundant in\nthe Kuiper belt. With a mean absolute magnitude $H_V$ = 22.95 and assuming a\ngeometric albedo $p_V$ = 0.1, we find an average radius of 55 m. No coma is\napparent; we deduce a limit to the dust mass production rate of only $\\sim$\n2$\\times$10$^{-4}$ kg s$^{-1}$, ruling out the existence of exposed ice\ncovering more than a few m$^2$ of the surface. Volatiles in this body, if they\nexist, must lie beneath an involatile surface mantle $\\gtrsim$0.5 m thick,\nperhaps a product of prolonged cosmic ray processing in the interstellar\nmedium. The lightcurve range is unusually large at $\\sim$2.0$\\pm$0.2\nmagnitudes. Interpreted as a rotational lightcurve the body has semi-axes\n$\\sim$230 m $\\times$ 35 m. A $\\sim$6:1 axis ratio is extreme relative to most\nsmall solar system asteroids and suggests that albedo variations may\nadditionally contribute to the variability. The lightcurve is consistent with a\ntwo-peaked period $\\sim$8.26 hr but the period is non-unique as a result of\naliasing in the data. Except for its unusually elongated shape, 1I/2017 U1 is a\nphysically unremarkable, sub-kilometer, slightly red, rotating object from\nanother planetary system. The steady-state population of similar, $\\sim$100 m\nscale interstellar objects inside the orbit of Neptune is $\\sim$10$^4$, each\nwith a residence time $\\sim$10 yr.\n", "  We present properties of the low-surface-brightness galaxy KDG 218 observed\nwith the HST/ACS. The galaxy has a half-light (effective) diameter of $a_e\n=47^{\\prime\\prime}$ and a central surface brightness of $SB_V(0) =\n24.4^m/sq^{\\prime\\prime}$. The galaxy remains unresolved with the HST/ACS,\nwhich implies its distance of {$D > 13.1$ Mpc} and linear effective diameter of\n$A_e >3.0$ kpc. We notice that KDG 218 is most likely associated with a galaxy\ngroup around the massive lenticular NGC 4958 galaxy at approximately $22$ Mpc,\nor with the Virgo Southern Extension filament at approximately $16.5$ Mpc. At\nthese distances, the galaxy is classified as an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG)\nsimilar to those found in the Virgo, Fornax, and Coma clusters. We also present\na sample of 15 UDG candidates in the Local Volume. These sample galaxies have\nthe following mean parameters: $\\langle D\\rangle = 5.1$ Mpc, $\\langle\nA_e\\rangle = 4.8$ kpc, and $\\langle SB_B (e) \\rangle =\n27.4^m/sq^{\\prime\\prime}$. All the local UDG candidates reside near massive\ngalaxies located in the regions with the mean stellar mass density (within 1\nMpc) about 50 times greater than the average cosmic density. The local fraction\nof UDGs does not exceed 1.5% of the Local Volume population. We notice that the\npresented sample of local UDGs is a heterogeneous one containing irregular,\ntransition, and tidal types, as well as objects consisting of an old stellar\npopulation.\n", "  We report a different type of three-minute chromospheric oscillations above a\nsunspot in association with a small-scale impulsive event in a light bridge.\nDuring our observations, we found a transient brightening in the light bridge.\nThe brightening was composed of elementary bursts that may be a manifestation\nof fast repetitive magnetic reconnections in the light bridge. Interestingly,\nthe oscillations in the nearby sunspot umbra were impulsively excited when the\nintensity of the brightening reached its peak. The initial period of the\noscillations was about 2.3 minutes and then gradually increased to 3.0 minutes\nwith time. In addition, we found that the amplitude of the excited oscillations\nwas twice the amplitude of oscillations before the brightening. Based on our\nresults, we propose that magnetic reconnection occurring in a light bridge can\nexcite of oscillations in the nearby sunspot umbra.\n", "  We show that nonuniform superconductors of the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) type conduct electric current in the\nway which is very different from the usual case. We discuss both equilibrium\nand nonequilibrium properties using a modified Ginzburg-Landau formalism. Among\nthe novel features are the existence of two different critical currents and two\ndistinct stable states able to carry a given current, the possibility of\nsuperconducting domain walls, and also a spontaneous supercurrent in a ring\ngeometry.\n", "  Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites offer a unique combination\nof in-plane specific strength and stiffness. They, however, suffer from a\nrelatively poor out-of plane performance. Improving this requires a thorough\nunderstanding of their behavior to out-of-plane loadings such as impact. Their\nimpact response is very complex in nature due to their strain-rate dependent\nproperties, progressive damage during impact, and their many failure modes such\nas delamination, fiber or matrix failure, and fiber crush. In this work,\nresponse of plain woven CFRP laminates are studied via experiments and\nnumerical simulations using the finite element package LS-DYNA. Quasi-static\nand dynamic tests were conducted to provide the materials parameters for the\nmaterial model; MAT162. Once the simulations were validated, the response of\nthe CFRP to impact was investigated in terms of different material properties,\nenergy absorption, and damage modes. Based on these results strategies are\nsuggested to improve the behavior of CFRPs under impact loadings.\n", "  Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are sporadically emitting pulsars\ndetectable only through searches for single pulses. While over 100 RRATs have\nbeen detected, only a small fraction (roughly 20\\%) have phase-connected timing\nsolutions, which are critical for determining how they relate to other neutron\nstar populations. Detecting more pulses in order to achieve solutions is a key\nto understanding their physical nature. Astronomical signals collected by radio\ntelescopes contain noise from many sources, making the detection of weak pulses\ndifficult. Applying a denoising method to raw time series prior to performing a\nsingle-pulse search typically leads to a more accurate estimation of their\ntimes of arrival (TOAs). Taking into account some features of RRAT pulses and\nnoise, we present a denoising method based on wavelet data analysis, an\nimage-processing technique. Assuming that the spin period of an RRAT is known,\nwe estimate the frequency spectrum components contributing to the composition\nof RRAT pulses. This allows us to suppress the noise, which contributes to\nother frequencies. We apply the wavelet denoising method including selective\nwavelet reconstruction and wavelet shrinkage to the de-dispersed time series of\neight RRATs with existing timing solutions. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of\nmost pulses are improved after wavelet denoising. Compared to the conventional\napproach, we measure 12% to 69% more TOAs for the eight RRATs. The new timing\nsolutions for the eight RRATs show 16% to 90% smaller estimation error of most\nparameters. Thus, we conclude that wavelet analysis is an effective tool for\ndenoising RRATs signal.\n", "  The recent Nobel-prize-winning detections of gravitational waves from merging\nblack holes and the subsequent detection of the collision of two neutron stars\nin coincidence with electromagnetic observations have inaugurated a new era of\nmultimessenger astrophysics. To enhance the scope of this emergent science, we\nproposed the use of deep convolutional neural networks for the detection and\ncharacterization of gravitational wave signals in real-time. This method, Deep\nFiltering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this\narticle, we present the extension of Deep Filtering using real data from the\nfirst observing run of LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of\ngravitational waves from binary black hole mergers with continuous data streams\nfrom multiple LIGO detectors. We show for the first time that machine learning\ncan detect and estimate the true parameters of a real GW event observed by\nLIGO. Our comparisons show that Deep Filtering is far more computationally\nefficient than matched-filtering, while retaining similar sensitivity and lower\nerrors, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in\nnon-stationary non-Gaussian noise, with minimal resources, and also enables the\ndetection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed\nwith existing detection algorithms. This approach is uniquely suited to enable\ncoincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger\ncounterparts in real-time.\n", "  Randomized benchmarking is a useful scheme for evaluation the average\nfidelity of a noisy quantum circuit. However, it is insensitive to the unitary\nerror. Here, we propose a method of randomized benchmarking in which a unitary\nt-design is applied and by which the unitary error estimation can be converted\nto analysis of pseudo-randomness on a set of unitary operators. We give a bound\non the number of randomized benchmarking sequences, when performing a unitary\nt-design on n-qubit d-dimensional system. By applying local random unitary\noperators, a decomposition of a unitary t-design, the bound is more practical\nthan the previous bound for multi-qubit circuit. We also give a rigorous bound\nof a diamond norm between arbitrary and uniform distributions of a set of\nunitary operators to form an \\epsilon-approximate unitary t-design. It can be\nused to quantitatively analyze the corresponding average fidelity and errors in\na large-scale quantum circuit.\n", "  Neutrinos interact only very weakly, so they are extremely penetrating.\nHowever, the theoretical neutrino-nucleon interaction cross section rises with\nenergy such that, at energies above 40 TeV, neutrinos are expected to be\nabsorbed as they pass through the Earth. Experimentally, the cross section has\nbeen measured only at the relatively low energies (below 400 GeV) available at\nneutrino beams from accelerators \\cite{Agashe:2014kda, Formaggio:2013kya}. Here\nwe report the first measurement of neutrino absorption in the Earth, using a\nsample of 10,784 energetic upward-going neutrino-induced muons observed with\nthe IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The flux of high-energy neutrinos transiting\nlong paths through the Earth is attenuated compared to a reference sample that\nfollows shorter trajectories through the Earth. Using a fit to the\ntwo-dimensional distribution of muon energy and zenith angle, we determine the\ncross section for neutrino energies between 6.3 TeV and 980 TeV, more than an\norder of magnitude higher in energy than previous measurements. The measured\ncross section is $1.30^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$ (stat.) $^{+0.39}_{-0.43}$ (syst.)\ntimes the prediction of the Standard Model \\cite{CooperSarkar:2011pa},\nconsistent with the expectation for charged and neutral current interactions.\nWe do not observe a dramatic increase in the cross section, expected in some\nspeculative models, including those invoking new compact dimensions\n\\cite{AlvarezMuniz:2002ga} or the production of leptoquarks\n\\cite{Romero:2009vu}.\n", "  We address side-channel leakage in a trusted preparation station of\ncontinuous-variable quantum key distribution with coherent and squeezed states.\nWe consider two different scenaria: multimode Gaussian modulation, directly\naccessible to an eavesdropper, or side-channel loss of the signal states prior\nto the modulation stage. We show the negative impact of excessive modulation on\nboth the coherent- and squeezed-state protocols. The impact is more pronounced\nfor squeezed-state protocols and may require optimization of squeezing in the\ncase of noisy quantum channels. Further, we demonstrate that coherent-state\nprotocol is immune to side-channel signal state leakage prior to modulation,\nwhile the squeezed-state protocol is vulnerable to such attacks, becoming more\nsensitive to the noise in the channel. In the general case of noisy quantum\nchannels the signal squeezing can be optimized to provide best performance of\nthe protocol in the presence of side-channel leakage prior to modulation. Our\nresults demonstrate that leakage from the trusted source in continuous-variable\nquantum key distribution should not be underestimated and squeezing\noptimization is needed to overcome coherent state protocols.\n", "  Hybrid morphology radio sources are a rare type of radio galaxy that display\ndifferent Fanaroff-Riley classes on opposite sides of their nuclei. To enhance\nthe statistical analysis of hybrid morphology radio sources, we embarked on a\nlarge-scale search of these sources within the international citizen science\nproject, Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ). Here, we present 25 new candidate hybrid\nmorphology radio galaxies. Our selected candidates are moderate power radio\ngalaxies (L_median = 4.7x10^{24} W/(Hz sr) at redshifts 0.14<z<1.0. Hosts of\nnine candidates have spectroscopic observations, of which six are classified as\nquasars, one as high- and two as low-excitation galaxies. Two candidate HyMoRS\nare giant (>1Mpc) radio galaxies, one resides at a centre of a galaxy cluster,\nand one is hosted by a rare green bean galaxy. Although the origin of the\nhybrid morphology radio galaxies is still unclear, this type of radio source\nstarts depicting itself as a rather diverse class. We discuss hybrid radio\nmorphology formation in terms of the radio source environment (nurture) and\nintrinsically occurring phenomena (nature; activity cessation and\namplification), showing that these peculiar radio galaxies can be formed by\nboth mechanisms. While high angular resolution follow-up observations are still\nnecessary to confirm our candidates, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Radio\nGalaxy Zoo in the pre-selection of these sources from all-sky radio surveys,\nand report the reliability of citizen scientists in identifying and classifying\ncomplex radio sources.\n", "  When recording spectra from the ground, atmospheric turbulence causes\ndegradation of the spatial resolution. We present a data reduction method that\nrestores the spatial resolution of the spectra to their undegraded state. By\nassuming that the point spread function (PSF) estimated from a strictly\nsynchronized, broadband slit-jaw camera is the same as the PSF that spatially\ndegraded the spectra, we can quantify what linear combination of undegraded\nspectra is present in each degraded data point. The set of equations obtained\nin this way is found to be generally well-conditioned and sufficiently diagonal\nto be solved using an iterative linear solver. The resulting solution has\nregained a spatial resolution comparable to that of the restored slit-jaw\nimages.\n", "  Meaningful topological invariants for mixed quantum states are challenging to\nidentify as there is no unique way to define them, and most choices do not\ndirectly relate to physical observables. Here, we propose a simple pragmatic\napproach to construct topological invariants of mixed states while preserving a\nconnection to physical observables, by continuously deforming known topological\ninvariants for pure (ground) states. Our approach relies on expectation values\nof many-body operators, with no reference to single-particle (e.g., Bloch)\nwavefunctions. To illustrate it, we examine extensions to mixed states of\n$U(1)$ geometric (Berry) phases and their corresponding topological invariant\n(winding or Chern number). We discuss measurement schemes, and provide a\ndetailed construction of invariants for thermal or more general mixed states of\nquantum systems with (at least) $U(1)$ charge-conservation symmetry, such as\nquantum Hall insulators.\n", "  In this thesis we present some computations made in both sides of the AdS/CFT\nholographic correspondence using the integrability of both theories.\n  Regarding the string theory side, this thesis is focused in the computation\nof the dispersion relation of closed spinning strings in some deformed $AdS_3\n\\times S^3$ backgrounds. In particular we are going to focus in the deformation\nprovided by the mixing of R-R and NS-NS fluxes and the so-called\n$\\eta$-deformation. These computations are made using the classical\nintegrability of these two deformed string theories, which is provided by the\npresence of a set of conserved quantities called \"Uhlenbeck constants\". The\nexistence of the Uhlenbeck constants is central for the method used to derive\nthe dispersion relations.\n  Regarding the gauge theory side, we are interested in the computation of two\nand three-point correlation functions. Concerning the two-point function a\ncomputation of correlation functions involving different operators and\ndifferent number of excitations is performed using the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz\nand the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. These results are compared with\ncomputations done with the Coordinate Bethe Ansatz and with\nZamolodchikov-Faddeev operators. Concerning the three-point functions, we will\nexplore the novel construction given by the hexagon framework. In particular we\nare going to start from the already proposed hexagon form factor and rewrite it\nin a language more resembling of the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz. For this intent we\nconstruct an invariant vertex using Zamolodchikov-Faddeev operators, which is\nchecked for some simple cases.\n", "  We report the discovery of 11 bipolar outflows within a projected distance of\n1pc from Sgr A* based on deep ALMA observations of $^{13}$CO, H30$\\alpha$ and\nSiO (5-4) lines with sub-arcsecond and $\\sim1.3$ km/s, resolutions. These\nunambiguous signatures of young protostars manifest as approaching and receding\nlobes of dense gas swept up by the jets created during the formation and early\nevolution of stars. The lobe masses and momentum transfer rates are consistent\nwith young protostellar outflows found throughout the disk of the Galaxy. The\nmean dynamical age of the outflow population is estimated to be\n$6.5^{+8.1}_{-3.6}\\times10^3$ years. The rate of star formation is\n$\\sim5\\times10^{-4}$\\msol\\,yr$^{-1}$ assuming a mean stellar mass of $\\sim0.3$\n\\msol. This discovery provides evidence that star formation is taking place\nwithin clouds surprisingly close to Sgr A*, perhaps due to events that compress\nthe host cloud, creating condensations with sufficient self-gravity to resist\ntidal disruption by Sgr A*. Low-mass star formation over the past few billion\nyears at this level would contribute significantly to the stellar mass budget\nin the central few pc of the Galaxy. The presence of many dense clumps of\nmolecular material within 1pc of Sgr A* suggests that star formation could take\nplace in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of\nexternal galaxies\n", "  In this article, we construct the\nscalar-diquark-axialvector-diquark-antiquark type interpolating currents, and\nstudy the masses and pole residues of the $J^{P}=\\frac{3}{2}^{\\pm}$\nhidden-charmed pentaquark states with the QCD sum rules. In calculations, we\nuse the formula $\\mu=\\sqrt{M^2_{P}-(2{\\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ to determine the\nenergy scales of the QCD spectral densities. We obtain the masses of the\nhidden-charm pentaquark states with the strangeness $S=-1$ and $S=-2$, which\ncan be confronted to the experimental data in the future.\n", "  We present a description of vacuum polarization in a circular Dirac quantum\ndot in two spatial dimensions assuming $\\alpha$ - the relative strength of the\nCoulomb interaction small enough to render an approximation with a single\nelectron (hole) lowest energy level relevant. Applying this approximation, we\nfind that for $ \\alpha_c \\approx 1.05$ the lowest level is half-filled\nirrespective of the number of flavors that are present. The ground state can be\nrepresented as a superposition of particular (even number) excitonic states\nwhich constitute an excitonic cloud that evolves in a crossover manner. The\nground state is degenerate with an intervalley excitonic state at $ \\alpha_c\n\\approx 1.05$, a critical strength, that in our approximation marks a point\nwith single electron and exciton resonances.\n", "  Azobenzene based molecules have the property of isomerizing when illuminated.\nIn relation with that photoisomerization property, azobenzene containing\nmaterials are the subject of unexplained massive mass transport. In this work\nwe use an idealised rectangular chromophore model to study the dependence of\nthe isomerization induced transport on the chromophore dimensions. Our results\nshow the presence of a motor arm length threshold for induced transport, which\ncorresponds to the host molecule size. Above the threshold, the diffusive\nmotions increase proportionally to the chromophore length. Intriguingly, we\nfind only a very small chromophore width dependence of the induced diffusive\nmotions. Our very simplified motor reproduces relatively well the behavior\nobserved using the real DR1 motor molecule, suggesting that the complex closing\nprocedure and the detailed shape of the motor are not necessary to induce the\nmolecular motions.\n", "  A complex collective emerging behavior characterized by coexisting coherent\nand incoherent do- mains is termed as a chimera state. We bring out the\nexistence of a new type of chimera in a nonlocally coupled ensemble of\nidentical oscillators driven by a common dynamic environment. The latter\nfacilitates the onset of phase-flip bifurcation/transitions among the coupled\noscillators of the ensemble, while the nonlocal coupling induces a partial\nasynchronization among the out-of-phase synchronized oscillators at this onset.\nThis leads to the manifestation of coexisting out-of-phase synchronized\ncoherent domains interspersed by asynchronous incoherent domains elucidating\nthe existence of a different type of chimera state. In addition to this, a rich\nvariety of other collective behaviors such as clusters with phase-flip\ntransition, conventional chimera, solitary state and com- plete synchronized\nstate which have been reported using different coupling architectures are found\nto be induced by the employed couplings for appropriate coupling strengths. The\nrobustness of the resulting dynamics is demonstrated in ensembles of two\nparadigmatic models, namely R\\\"ossler oscillators and Stuart-Landau\noscillators.\n", "  In inboard-limited plasmas, foreseen to be used in future fusion reactors\nstart-up and ramp down phases, the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) exhibits two regions:\nthe \"near\" and \"far\" SOL. The steep radial gradient of the parallel heat flux\nassociated with the near SOL can result in excessive thermal loads onto the\nsolid surfaces, damaging them and/or limiting the operational space of a fusion\nreactor. In this article, leveraging the results presented in [F. Nespoli et\nal., Nuclear Fusion 2017], we propose a technique for the mitigation and\nsuppression of the near SOL heat flux feature by impurity seeding. First\nsuccessful experimental results from the TCV tokamak are presented and\ndiscussed.\n", "  Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the N K edge reveals clearly resolved\nharmonics of the anion plane vibrations in the kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3\nspin-liquid insulator. Tuning the incoming light energy at the K edge of two\ndistinct N sites permits to excite different sets of phonon modes. Cyanide CN\nstretching mode is selected at the edge of the ordered N sites which are more\nstrongly connected to the BEDT-TTF molecules, while positionally disordered N\nsites show multi-mode excitation. Combining measurements with calculations on\nan anion plane cluster permits to estimate the sitedependent electron-phonon\ncoupling of the modes related to nitrogen excitation.\n", "  We have investigated and applied machine-learning algorithms for Infrared\nColour Selection of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) candidates. Objects taken from the\nGLIMPSE catalogue of the infrared objects in the Galactic plane can be\nclassified into different stellar populations based on the colours inferred\nfrom their broadband photometric magnitudes ($J$, $H$ and $K_s$ from 2MASS, and\nthe four \\textit{Spitzer}/IRAC bands). The algorithms tested in this pilot\nstudy are variants of the $k$-Nearest Neighbours ($k$-NN) approach, which is\nideal for exploratory studies of classification problems where interrelations\nbetween variables and classes are complicated. The aims of this study are (1)\nto provide an automated tool to select reliable WR candidates and potentially\nother classes of objects, (2) to measure the efficiency of infrared colour\nselection at performing these tasks and, (3) to lay the groundwork for\nstatistically inferring the total number of WR stars in our Galaxy. We report\nthe performance results obtained over a set of known objects and selected\ncandidates for which we have carried out follow-up spectroscopic observations,\nand confirm the discovery of 4 new WR stars.\n", "  The multipartite polarization entangled states of bright optical beams\ndirectly associating with the spin states of atomic ensembles are one of the\nessential resources in the future quantum information networks, which can be\nconveniently utilized to transfer and convert quantum states across a network\ncomposed of many atomic nodes. In this letter, we present the experimental\ndemonstration of tripartite polarization entanglement described by Stokes\noperators of optical field. The tripartite entangled states of light at the\nfrequency resonant with D1 line of Rubidium atoms are transformed into the\ncontinuous variable polarization entanglement among three bright optical beams\nvia an optical beam splitter network. The obtained entanglement is confirmed by\nthe extended criterion for polarization entanglement of multipartite quantized\noptical modes.\n", "  2H-TaSe2 is a model transition metal dichalcogenide material that develops\ncharge density waves (CDWs).Here we present variable-temperature Raman\nspectroscopy study on both incommensurate charge density waves (ICDW) and\noptical phonon modes of 2H-TaSe2 thin layers exfoliated onto SiO2 substrate.\nRaman scattering intensities of all modes reach a maximum when the sample\nthickness is about 11 nm. This phenomenon can be explained by optical\ninterference effect between the sample and the substrate. The E2gICDW amplitude\nmodes experience redshift as temperature increases. We extract ICDW transition\ntemperature (TICDW) from temperature dependence of the frequency of E2gICDW\nmode. We find that TICDW increases in thinner flakes,which could be due to a\nresult of significantly enhanced electron-phonon interactions. Our results open\nup a new window for search and control of CDW of two-dimensional matter.\n", "  The tentative 1.4 TeV excess in the $e^+e^-$ spectrum measured by The DArk\nMatter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) motivates the possible existence of one or\nmore local dark matter concentrated regions. In particular, Ultra-compact Micro\nHalos (UCMHs) seeded by large density perturbations in the early universe,\nallocated within ~0.3 kpc from the solar system, could provide the potential\nsource of electrons and positrons produced from dark matter annihilation,\nenough to explain the DAMPE signal. Here we consider a UCMH with density\nprofile assuming radial in-fall and explore the preferred halo parameters to\nexplain the 1.4 TeV \"DAMPE excess\". We find that typical parameter space of\nUCMHs can easily explain the \"DAMPE excess\" with usual thermal-averaged\nannihilation cross section of WIMP. The fraction of dark matter stored in such\nUCMHs in the Galactic-scale halo can be reduced to as small as $O(10^{-5})$,\nwell within the current cosmological and astrophysical constraints.\n", "  Accretion flows toward black holes can be of a quite different nature,\ndescribed as an optically thick cool gas flow in a disk for high accretion\nrates or as a hot coronal optically thin gas flow for low accretion rates,\npossibly affected by outflowing gas. The detection of broad iron emission lines\nin active galactic nuclei (AGN) indicates the coexistence of corona and disk.\nThe appearance and relative strength of such flows essentially depends on their\ninteraction. Liu et al. suggested that condensation of gas from the corona to\nthe disk allows to understand accretion flows of comparable strength of\nemission. Matter inflow due to gravitational capture of gas is important for\nthe condensation process. We discuss observational features predicted by the\nmodel. Data from simultaneous observations of AGN with {\\it {Swift's}} X-ray\nand UV-optical telescopes are compared with the theoretical predictions. The\nfrequent detection of broad iron K$\\alpha$ emission lines and the dependence of\nthe emitted spectra on the Eddington ratio, described by the values of the\nphoton index $\\Gamma$ and the two-point spectral index $\\alpha_{\\rm{ox}}$ are\nin approximate agreement with the predictions of the condensation model; the\nlatter, however, with a large scatter. The model further yields a coronal\nemission concentrated in a narrow inner region as is also deduced from the\nanalysis of emissivity profiles. The accretion flows in bright AGN could be\ndescribed by the accretion of stellar wind or interstellar medium and its\ncondensation into a thin disk.\n", "  We present recent results on short-lived hadronic resonances obtained by the\nALICE experiment in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies, including\nthe most recent measurements of $\\Lambda(1520)$ and $\\Xi(1530)^{0}$ resonances.\n", "  For the two-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation, the general form of the point\ntransformations such that the result can be interpreted as a Schr\\\"odinger\nequation with effective (i.e. position dependent) mass is studied. A wide class\nof such models with different forms of mass function is obtained in this way.\nStarting from the solvable two-dimensional model, the variety of solvable\npartner models with effective mass can be built. Several illustrating examples\nnot amenable to the conventional separation of variables are given.\n", "  We reported a systematic study of spin-orbit torque biased magnetic sensors\nbased on NiFe/Pt bilayers through both macro-spin modeling and experiments. The\nsimulation results show that it is possible to achieve a linear sensor with a\ndynamic range of 0.1 - 10 Oe, power consumption of 1uW - 1 mW, and sensitivity\nof 0.1-0.5 Ohm/Oe. These characteristics can be controlled by varying the\nsensor dimension and current density in the Pt layer. The latter is in the\nrange of 1 x 10^5 - 10^7 A/cm^2. Experimental results of fabricated sensors\nwith selected sizes agree well with the simulation results. For a Wheatstone\nbridge sensor comprising of four sensing elements, a sensitivity up to 0.548\nOhm/Oe, linearity error below 6%, and detectivity of about 2.8 nT/Sqrt(Hz) were\nobtained. The simple structure and ultrathin thickness greatly facilitate the\nintegration of these sensors for on-chip applications. As a proof-of-concept\nexperiment, we demonstrate its application in detection of current flowing in\nan on-chip Cu wire.\n", "  Spaniol and Andrade introduced grvitoelectromagnetism in TEGR by considering\nsuperpotentials, times the determinant of tetrads, as the\ngravitoelectromagnetic fields. However, since this defined\ngravitoelectromagnetic field strength does not give rise to a complete set of\nMaxwell-like equations, we propose an alternative definition of the\ngravitoelectromagnetic field strength: instead of superpotentials, torsions are\ntaken as the gravitoelectromagnetic field strengths. Based on this new proposal\nwe are able to derive a complete set of Maxwell-like equations. We then apply\nthem to obtain explicit expressions of the gravitoelectromagnetic fields both\nin Schwarzchilds spacetime and for gravitational waves.\n", "  A phenomenological model for the interface between trivial and topological\ntwo-dimensional insulators possessing the same band gap is presented. The model\ndepends on three measurable parameters, the energy gap $E_g$, the Fermi\nvelocity of the metallic edge states $v_F$ and the thickness of the interface\n$\\Delta$ where the gap inversion occurs, and can be reduced to the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for the modified P\\\"oschl-Teller potential, which admits\nan analytical solution. It is demonstrated that the underlying physics is\ndetermined by the adimensional parameter $\\alpha=E_g\\Delta/2\\hbar v_F$, whose\nintegral part determines the number of massive bound states at the interface.\nFurthermore, when $\\alpha$ is exactly an integer, waves incident on the\ninterface are never reflected. Results for parameters chosen in the typical\nscale of condensed matter systems are briefly discussed.\n", "  In our previous article [Rad16], we investigated the asymptotic behaviour of\northogonal Bianchi class B perfect fluids close to the initial singularity and\nproved the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in this setting. In several of\nthe statements, the case of a stiff fluid had to be excluded. The present paper\nfills this gap.\n  We work in expansion-normalised variables introduced by Hewitt-Wainwright and\nfind that solutions converge, but show a convergence behaviour very different\nfrom the non-stiff case: All solutions tend to limit points in the\ntwo-dimensional Jacobs set. A set of full measure, which is also a countable\nintersection of open and dense sets in the state space, yields convergence to a\nspecific subset of the Jacobs set.\n", "  We investigate the observability of the top anomalous $tqZ$ couplings via the\ntrilepton signatures at the Large Hadron Collider~(LHC) with the center-of-mass\nenergy of 14 TeV. We focus on signals of the $tZ$ associated production with\nthe decay mode $t\\to W^{+}b\\to b\\ell^{+}\\nu_{\\ell}$, $Z\\to \\ell^{+}\\ell^{-}$,\nand $t\\bar{t}$ production with the decay mode $\\bar{t}\\to Z(\\to\n\\ell^{+}\\ell^{-})\\bar{q}$ and $t\\to b\\ell^{+}\\nu_{\\ell}$, where $\\ell=e, \\mu$\nand $q$ reflects up and charm quarks. It is shown that at $3\\sigma$ level, the\nFCNC top quark decay branching ratios can be probed at, respectively, about\n$Br(t\\to uZ) \\leq 1.3\\times 10^{-4}$ and $Br(t\\to cZ) \\leq 4.2\\times 10^{-4}$\nwith the integrated luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$, and probed down to $Br(t\\to\nuZ) \\leq 2.2\\times 10^{-5}$ and $Br(t\\to cZ) \\leq 8\\times 10^{-5}$ for the\nhigh-luminosity LHC with 3000 fb$^{-1}$.\n", "  The long-lived, efficient storage and retrieval of a qubit encoded on a\nphoton is an important ingredient for future quantum networks. Although systems\nwith intrinsically long coherence times have been demonstrated, the combination\nwith an efficient light-matter interface remains an outstanding challenge. In\nfact, the coherence times of memories for photonic qubits are currently limited\nto a few milliseconds. Here we report on a qubit memory based on a single atom\ncoupled to a high-finesse optical resonator. By mapping and remapping the qubit\nbetween a basis used for light-matter interfacing and a basis which is less\nsusceptible to decoherence, a coherence time exceeding 100 ms has been measured\nwith a time-independant storage-and-retrieval efficiency of 22%. This\ndemonstrates the first photonic qubit memory with a coherence time that exceeds\nthe lower bound needed for teleporting qubits in a global quantum internet.\n", "  The optical scheme is proposed for realization of controlled phase quantum\ngate based on the off-resonant interaction of photon with three-level atom in\nsingle mode QED-cavity. Possible physical implementation of this scheme is\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper we propose new algorithm to reduce autocorrelation in Markov\nchain Monte-Carlo algorithms for euclidean field theories on the lattice. Our\nproposing algorithm is the Hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm (HMC) with restricted\nBoltzmann machine. We examine the validity of the algorithm by employing the\nphi-fourth theory in three dimension. We observe reduction of the\nautocorrelation both in symmetric and broken phase as well. Our proposing\nalgorithm provides consistent central values of expectation values of the\naction density and one-point Green's function with ones from the original HMC\nin both the symmetric phase and broken phase within the statistical error. On\nthe other hand, two-point Green's functions have slight difference between one\ncalculated by the HMC and one by our proposing algorithm in the symmetric\nphase. Furthermore, near the criticality, the distribution of the one-point\nGreen's function differs from the one from HMC. We discuss the origin of\ndiscrepancies and its improvement.\n", "  Unraveling the stratigraphic record is the key to understanding ancient\nclimate and past climate changes on Mars. River deposits when placed in\nstratigraphic order could constrain the number, magnitudes, and durations of\nthe wettest climates in Mars history. We establish the stratigraphic context of\nriver deposits in Aeolis Dorsa sedimentary basin, 10E of Gale crater. Here,\nwind has exhumed a stratigraphic section of >=4 unconformity-bounded\nsedimentary rock packages, recording >=3 distinct episodes of surface runoff.\nEarly deposits (>700m thick) are embayed by river deposits (>400m), which are\nin turn unconformably draped by fan-shaped deposits (<100m) which we interpret\nas alluvial fans. Yardang-forming deposits (>900 m) unconformably drape all\nprevious deposits. River deposits embay a dissected sedimentary-rock landscape,\nand comprise >=2 distinguishable units. The total interval spanned by river\ndeposits is >(1x10^6-2x10^7) yr; more if we include alluvial-fan deposits.\nAlluvial-fan deposits unconformably postdate thrust faults which crosscut river\ndeposits. We infer a relatively dry interval of >4x10^7 yr after river deposits\nformed and before fan-shaped deposits formed. The time gap between the end of\nriver deposition and the onset of yardang-forming deposits is constrained to\n>10^8 yr by the density of impact craters embedded at the unconformity. We\ncorrelate yardang-forming deposits to the upper layers of Gale crater's mound\n(Mt. Sharp/Aeolis Mons), and fan-shaped deposits to Peace Vallis fan.\nAlternations between periods of low vs. high mean obliquity may have modulated\nerosion-deposition cycling in Aeolis. This is consistent with results from an\nensemble of simulations of Solar System orbital evolution and the resulting\nhistory of Mars obliquity. Almost all simulations yield intervals of\ncontinuously low mean Mars obliquity that are long enough to match our\nunconformity data.\n", "  In this paper, we systematically calculate the polarization in soft X-rays\nemitted from magnetized neutron stars, which are expected to be observed by the\nnext-generation X-ray satellites. Magnetars are one of the targets for these\nobservations. This is because thermal radiation is normally observed in the\nsoft X-ray band, and it is thought to be linearly polarized because of\ndifferent opacities for two polarization modes of photons in the magnetized\natmosphere of neutron stars and the dielectric properties of the vacuum in\nstrong magnetic fields. In their previous study, Taverna et al. illustrated how\nstrong magnetic fields influence the behavior of the polarization observables\nfor radiation propagating in vacuo without addressing a precise, physical\nemission model. In this paper, we pay attention to the conversion of photon\npolarization modes that can occur in the presence of an atmospheric layer above\nthe neutron star surface, computing the polarization angle and fraction and\nsystematically changing the magnetic field strength, radii of the emission\nregion, temperature, mass, and radii of the neutron stars. We confirmed that if\nplasma is present, the effects of mode conversion cannot be neglected when the\nmagnetic field is relatively weak, $B \\sim 10^{13} \\mathrm{G}$. Our results\nindicate that strongly magnetized ($B \\gtrsim 10^{14} \\mathrm{G}$) neutron\nstars are suitable to detect polarizations, but not-so-strongly magnetized ($B\n\\sim 10^{13} \\mathrm{G}$) neutron stars will be the ones to confirm the mode\nconversion.\n", "  Solar energetic particles are a result of intense solar events such as solar\nflares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). These latter events all together can\ncause major disruptions to spacecraft that are in Earth's orbit and outside of\nthe magnetosphere. In this work we are interested in establishing the necessary\nconditions for a major geo-effective solar particle storm immediately after a\nmajor flare, namely the existence of a direct magnetic connection. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work that explores not only the correlations of\nGOES X-ray and proton channels, but also the correlations that happen across\nall the proton channels. We found that proton channels auto-correlations and\ncross-correlations may also be precursors to the occurrence of an SEP event. In\nthis paper, we tackle the problem of predicting >100 MeV SEP events from a\nmultivariate time series perspective using easily interpretable decision tree\nmodels.\n", "  We report a novel miniature Paul ion trap design with an integrated optical\nfibre cavity which can serve as a building block for a fibre-linked quantum\nnetwork. In such cavity quantum electrodynamic set-ups, the optimal coupling of\nthe ions to the cavity mode is of vital importance and this is achieved by\nmoving the ion relative to the cavity mode. The trap presented herein features\nan endcap-style design complemented with extra electrodes on which additional\nradiofrequency voltages are applied to fully control the pseudopotential\nminimum in three dimensions. This method lifts the need to use\nthree-dimensional translation stages for moving the fibre cavity with respect\nto the ion and achieves high integrability, mechanical rigidity and\nscalability. Not based on modifying the capacitive load of the trap, this\nmethod leads to precise control of the pseudopotential minimum allowing the ion\nto be moved with precisions limited only by the ion's position spread. We\ndemonstrate this by coupling the ion to the fibre cavity and probing the cavity\nmode profile.\n", "  The Bethe equation is a nonlinear differential equation that plays an\nimportant role in nuclear physics and a variety of applications related to it,\nsuch as the description of the behavior of an energetic particle when it\npenetrates into matter. Despite its importance, its unusual to find the exact\nsolution to this nonlinear equation in literature and practically all of them\nare of experimental nature. In this paper, we solve this equation and present a\nnew approach to obtain the solution through the combined use of the Adomian\nDecomposition Method and the Laplace Transform (LADM). In addition, we\nillustrate our approach solving three examples, in which initial conditions are\nconsidered within the typical numerical ranges derived from the applications.\nOur results indicate that LADM is highly accurate and can be considered a very\nuseful and valuable method.\n", "  One of the remarkable capabilities of ultrashort polarized laser pulses is\nthe generation of laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS). The origin\nof this phenomenon is largely attributed to the interference of the incident\nlaser wave and surface electromagnetic wave that creates a periodic absorption\npattern. Although, commonly, LIPSS are produced by repetitive irradiation of\nthe same area by multiple laser pulses in the regime of surface melting and\nresolidification, recent reports demonstrate the formation of LIPSS in the\nsingle pulse irradiation regime at laser fluences well above the ablation\nthreshold. In this paper, we report results of a large-scale molecular dynamics\nsimulation aimed at providing insights into the mechanisms of single pulse\nablative LIPSS formation. The simulation performed for a Cr target reveals an\ninterplay of material removal and redistribution in the course of spatially\nmodulated ablation, leading to the transient formation of an elongated liquid\nwall extending up to ~600 nm above the surface of the target at the locations\nof the minima of the laser energy deposition. The upper part of the liquid wall\ndisintegrates into droplets while the base of the wall solidifies on the\ntimescale of ~2 ns, producing a ~100 nm-long frozen surface feature extending\nabove the level of the initial surface of the target. The properties of the\nsurface region of the target are modified by the presence of high densities of\ndislocations and vacancies generated due to the rapid and highly nonequilibrium\nnature of the melting and resolidification processes. The insights into the\nLIPSS formation mechanisms may help in designing approaches for increasing the\nprocessing speed and improving the quality of the laser-patterned periodic\nsurface structures.\n", "  We describe a procedure in which elementary education students fabricate\n3-cell, $\\approx5 ~\\mathrm{Watt}$, $1.6~\\mathrm{V}$ solar panels. The panels\nare manufactured at a cost of about $\\$6$ each. The paper also describes a\nseries of characterization activities that we have had our students complete\nwith the panels once fabrication is complete. Specifically, our students have\ndetermined: the dependence of panel power on load resistance, the variation of\nopen-circuit panel voltage between different students' work, and energy capture\nefficiency. The activity also allows opportunities for discussion of\nmanufacturing and process improvement which can provide unusual connections to\nengineering and technology learning outcomes.\n", "  Designer heterostructures can now be assembled layer-by-layer with unmatched\nprecision thanks to the recently developed deterministic placement methods to\ntransfer two-dimensional (2D) materials. This possibility constitutes the birth\nof a very active research field on the so-called van der Waals\nheterostructures. Moreover, these deterministic placement methods also open the\ndoor to fabricate complex devices, which would be otherwise very difficult to\nachieve by conventional bottom-up nanofabrication approaches, and to fabricate\nfully-encapsulated devices with exquisite electronic properties. The\nintegration of 2D materials with existing technologies such as photonic and\nsuperconducting waveguides and fiber optics is another exciting possibility.\nHere, we review the state-of-the-art of the deterministic placement methods,\ndescribing and comparing the different alternative methods available in the\nliterature and we illustrate their potential to fabricate van der Waals\nheterostructures, to integrate 2D materials into complex devices and to\nfabricate artificial bilayer structures where the layers present a user-defined\nrotational twisting angle.\n", "  Additive manufacturing represents a revolution due to its unique capabilities\nfor freeform fabrication of near net shapes with strong reduction of waste\nmaterial and capital cost. These unfair advantages are especially relevant for\nexpensive and energy-demanding manufacturing processes of advanced ceramics\nsuch as Yttria-stabilized Zirconia, the state-of-the-art electrolyte in Solid\nOxide Fuel Cell applications. In this study, self-supported electrolytes of\nyttria-stabilized zirconia have been printed by using a stereolithography\nthree-dimensional printer. Printed electrolytes and complete cells fabricated\nwith cathode and anode layers of lanthanum strontium manganite- and nickel\noxide-yttria-stabilized zirconia composites, respectively, were electrochemical\ncharacterized showing full functionality. In addition, more complex\nconfigurations of the electrolyte have been printed yielding an increase of the\nperformance entirely based on geometrical aspects. Complementary, a numerical\nmodel has been developed and validated as predictive tool for designing more\nadvanced configurations that will enable highly performing and fully customized\ndevices in the next future\n", "  Complexity theory embodies some of the hardest, most fundamental and most\nchallenging open problems in modern science. The very term complexity is very\nelusive, so that the main goal of this theory is to find meaningful quantifiers\nfor it. In fact we need various measures to take into account the multiple\nfacets of this term. Here some biparametric Cr\\'amer-Rao and Heisenberg-R\\'enyi\nmeasures of complexity of continuous probability distributions are defined and\ndiscussed. Then, they are applied to the blackbody radiation at temperature T\nin a d-dimensional universe. It is found that these dimensionless quantities do\nnot depend on T nor on any physical constants. So, they have an universal\ncharacter in the sense that they only depend on the spatial dimensionality. To\ndetermine these complexity quantifiers we have calculated their dispersion\n(typical deviations) and entropy (R\\'enyi entropies and the generalized Fisher\ninformation) constituents. They are found to have a temperature-dependent\nbehavior similar to the celebrated Wien's displacement law of the dominant\nfrequency $\\nu_{max}$ at which the spectrum reaches its maximum. Moreover, they\nallow us to gain insights into new aspects of the d-dimensional blackbody\nspectrum and about the quantification of quantum effects associated with space\ndimensionality.\n", "  We examine the relationship between two different types of ranked data,\nfrequencies and magnitudes. We consider data that can be sorted out either way,\nthrough numbers of occurrences or size of the measures, as it is the case, say,\nof moon craters, earthquakes, billionaires, etc. We indicate that these two\ntypes of distributions are functional inverses of each other, and specify this\nlink, first in terms of the assumed parent probability distribution that\ngenerates the data samples, and then in terms of an analog (deterministic)\nnonlinear iterated map that reproduces them. For the particular case of\nhyperbolic decay with rank the distributions are identical, that is, the\nclassical Zipf plot, a pure power law. But their difference is largest when one\ndisplays logarithmic decay and its counterpart shows the inverse exponential\ndecay, as it is the case of Benford law, or viceversa. For all intermediate\ndecay rates generic differences appear not only between the power-law exponents\nfor the midway rank decline but also for small and large rank. We extend the\ntheoretical framework to include thermodynamic and statistical-mechanical\nconcepts, such as entropies and configuration.\n", "  We study the effects of expansion and viscous corrections on the\nhydrodynamical medium response to a high energy jet parton. More specifically,\nusing a semi-analytical Gubser solution to relativistic fluid dynamics,\nmodifications to the formed Mach cone, diffusive wake, and the momentum flow of\nthe medium response along and perpendicular to the jet particle, are analyzed\nmode-by-mode. This should provide intuition and guidance for analyses of the\nexperimentally measured jet sub-structure in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  In this work we introduce the many-body synchronization of an interacting\nqubit ensemble which allows one to switch dynamically from many-body-localized\n(MBL) to an ergodic state. We show that applying of $\\pi$-pulses with altering\nphases, one can effectively suppress the MBL phase and, hence, eliminate qubits\ndisorder. The findings are based on the analysis of the Loschmidt echo dynamics\nwhich shows a transition from a power-law decay to more rapid one indicating\nthe dynamical MBL-to-ergodic transition. The technique does not require to know\nthe microscopic details of the disorder.\n", "  We consider the evolution of an isentropic thermal instability in the atomic\nzone of a photodissociation region (PDR). In this zone, gas heating and cooling\nare associated mainly with photoelectric emission from dust grains and\nfine-structure lines ([\\ion{C}{ii}] 158, [\\ion{O}{i}] 63, and [\\ion{O}{i}] 146\n{\\micron}), respectively. The instability criterion has a multi-parametric\ndependence on the conditions of the interstellar medium. We found that\ninstability occurs when the intensity of the incident far-ultraviolet field\n$G_0$ and gas density $n$ are high. For example, we have $3\\times10^3<G_0<10^6$\nand $4.5\\times10^4<n<10^6$ {\\cmc} at temperatures $360 <T<10^4$ K for typical\ncarbon and oxygen abundances $\\xi_{\\rm C}=1.4\\times10^{-4}$ and $\\xi_{\\rm\nO}=3.2\\times10^{-4}$. The instability criterion depends on the relation between\n$\\xi_{\\rm C}$ and $\\xi_{\\rm O}$ abundances and line opacities. We also give\nexamples of observed PDRs where instability could occur. For these PDRs, the\ncharacteristic perturbation growth time is $t_{\\rm inst}\\sim10^3$ -- $10^4$ yr\nand the distance characterizing the formation of secondary waves is\n$L\\sim10^{-3}$ -- $5\\times10^{-2}$ pc. For objects that are older than $t_{\\rm\ninst}$ and have sizes of the atomic zone larger than $L$, we expect that\ninstability influences the PDR structure significantly. The presence of\nmultiple shock waves, turbulent velocities of several kilometers per second and\ninhomogeneities with higher density and temperature than the surrounding medium\ncan characterize isentropic thermal instability in PDRs.\n", "  In heavy-ion collisions, an interesting question of phenomenological\nrelevance is how the chiral imbalance generated at early times persists through\na fluctuating background of sphalerons in addition to other \"non-anomalous\"\ninteractions with the QGP. To address this question, we construct a\nrelativistic chiral kinetic theory using the world-line formulation of quantum\nfield theory. We outline how Berry's phase arises in this framework, and how\nits effects can be clearly distinguished from those arising from the chiral\nanomaly. We further outline how this framework can be matched to classical\nstatistical simulations at early times and to anomalous chiral hydrodynamics at\nlate times.\n", "  The spin Seebeck effect has recently been demonstrated as a viable method of\ndirect energy conversion that has potential to outperform energy conversion\nfrom the conventional Seebeck effect. In this study, a computational transport\nmodel is developed and validated that predicts the spin Seebeck voltage in\nspin-polarized materials using material parameter obtain from first principle\nground state density functional calculations. The transport model developed is\nbased on a 1D effective mass description coupled with a microscopic inverse\nspin Hall relationship. The model can predict both the spin current and voltage\ngenerated in a non-magnetic material placed on top of a ferromagnetic material\nin a transverse spin Seebeck configuration. The model is validated and verified\nwith available experimental data of La:YIG. Future applications of this model\ninclude the high-throughput exploration of new spin-based thermoelectric\nmaterials.\n", "  Quantum spin networks having engineered geometries and interactions are\neagerly pursued for quantum simulation and access to emergent quantum phenomena\nsuch as spin liquids. Spin-1/2 centers are particularly desirable because they\nreadily manifest coherent quantum fluctuations. Here we introduce a\ncontrollable spin-1/2 architecture consisting of titanium atoms on a magnesium\noxide surface. We tailor the spin interactions by atomic-precision positioning\nusing a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), and subsequently perform electron\nspin resonance (ESR) on individual atoms to drive transitions into and out of\nquantum eigenstates of the coupled-spin system. Interactions between the atoms\nare mapped over a range of distances extending from highly anisotropic dipole\ncoupling, to strong exchange coupling. The local magnetic field of the magnetic\nSTM tip serves to precisely tune the superposition states of a pair of spins.\nThe precise control of the spin-spin interactions and ability to probe the\nstates of the coupled-spin network by addressing individual spins will enable\nexploration of quantum many-body systems based on networks of spin-1/2 atoms on\nsurfaces.\n", "  Sides and medians are both Jacobi coordinate magnitudes, moreover then\nequably entering the spherical coordinates on Kendall's shape sphere and the\nHopf coordinates. This motivates treating medians on the same footing as sides\nin triangle geometry and the resulting Shape Theory. In this paper, we\nconsequently reformulate inequalities for the medians in terms of shape\nquantities, and proceed to find inequalities on the mass-weighted Jacobi\ncoordinates. This work moreover identifies the $4/3$ -- powers of which occur\nfrequently in the theory of medians -- as the ratio of Jacobi masses.\n  One of the Hopf coordinates is tetra-area. Another is anisoscelesness, which\nparametrizes whether triangles are left-or-right leaning as bounded by\nisoscelesness itself. The third is ellipticity, which parametrizes\ntallness-or-flatness of triangles as bounded by regular triangles. Whereas\ntetra-area is clearly cluster choice invariant, Jacobi coordinates,\nanisoscelesness and ellipticity are cluster choice dependent but can be\n`democratized' by averaging over all clusters. Democratized ellipticity\nmoreover trivializes, due to ellipticity being the difference of base-side and\nmedian second moments, whose averages are equal to each other. Thus we\nintroduce a distinct `linear ellipticity' quantifier of tallness-or-flatness of\ntriangles whose democratization is nontrivial, and find inequalities bounding\nthis. Some of this paper's inequalities are shape-independent bounds, whereas\nothers' bounds depend on the isoperimetric ratio and arithmetic-to-geometric\nside mean ratio shape variables.\n", "  We explore wave fronts of null geodesics in the Godel metric emitted from\npoint sources both at, and away from, the origin. For constant time wave fronts\nemitted by sources away from the origin, we find cusp ridges as well as blue\nsky metamorphoses where spatially disconnected portions of the wave front\nappear, connect to the main wave front, and then later break free and vanish.\nThese blue sky metamorphoses in the constant time wave fronts highlight the\nnon-causal features of the Godel metric. We introduce a concept of physical\ndistance along the null geodesics, and show that for wave fronts of constant\nphysical distance, the reorganization of the points making up the wave front\nleads to the removal of cusp ridges.\n", "  In this work we present the first attempt of modelling the deuterium\nchemistry in the massive young protostellar core NGC 2264 CMM3. We investigated\nthe sensitivity of this chemistry to the physical conditions in its surrounding\nenvironment. The results showed that deuteration, in the protostellar gas, is\naffected by variations in the core density, the amount of gas depletion onto\ngrain surfaces, the CR ionisation rate, but it is insensitive to variations in\nthe H$_2$ ortho-to-para ratio.\n  Our results, also, showed that deuteration is often enhanced in less-dense,\npartially depleted ($<$ 85\\%), or cores that are exerted to high CR ionisation\nrates ($\\ge$ 6.5 $\\times$ 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ ). However, in NGC 2264 CMM3,\ndecreasing the amount of gas depleted onto grains and enhancing the CR\nionisation rate are often overestimating the observed values in the core. The\nbest fit time to observations occurs around (1 - 5) $\\times$ 10$^4$ yrs for\ncore densities in the range (1 - 5) $\\times$ 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ with CR\nionisation rate between (1.7 - 6.5)$\\times$ 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. These values\nare in agreement with the results of the most recent theoretical chemical model\nof CMM3, and the time range of best fit is, also, in-line with the estimated\nage of young protostellar objects.\n  We conclude that deuterium chemistry in protostellar cores is: (i) sensitive\nto variations in the physical conditions in its environment, %(ii) deuteration\nin the protostellar gas is (ii) insensitive to changes in the H$_2$\northo-to-para ratio. %, but is sensitive to these variations in the dark cloud\nphase. We also conclude that the core NGC 2264 CMM3 is in its early stages of\nchemical evolution with an estimated age of (1 - 5) $\\times$ 10$^4$ yrs.\n", "  Parameter regulations of narrow-linewidth fiber lasers in frequency domain\nhas drawn considerable interests for widespread applications in the light\nquantum computing, precise coherent detection, and generation of micro-waves.\nAll-optical methods provide compact, precise and fast accesses to achieving\nthese lasers with wavelength-tunability. Here, the optical-thermal effects of\ngraphene is utilized to precisely control operations of free-running lasers\nwith a tuning speed of 140 MHz/ms. Assisted by the single-longitude-mode\noperation and linewidth suppression of stimulated Brillouin backscattering, we\nobtain an optical-controllable ~750 Hz fiber laser with a wavelength-tuning\nrange of 3.7 nm.\n", "  Synchrotron X-ray microtomography and skeletonisation method were used to\nstudy the true 3D network structures and morphologies of the Fe-rich\nintermetallic phases in Al-5.0%Cu-0.6%Mn alloys with 0.5% and 1.0% Fe. It was\nfound that, the Fe-phases in the 1.0%Fe alloy have node lengths of 5-25m; while\nthose in the 0.5%Fe alloy are of 3-17 m. The Fe-phases in the 1.0%Fe alloy also\ndeveloped sharper mean curvature with wider distribution than those in the\n0.5%Fe alloy. Combining SEM studies of the deeply-etched samples, the true 3D\nstructures of 4 different type Fe-phases in both alloys are also revealed and\ndemonstrated.\n", "  `Internal plateau' followed by a sharp decay is commonly seen in short\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves. The plateau component is usually\ninterpreted as the dipole emission from a supra-massive magnetar, and the sharp\ndecay may imply the collapse of the magnetar to a black hole (BH). Fall-back\naccretion onto the new-born BH could produce long-lasting activities via the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) process. The magnetic flux accumulated near the BH would\nbe confined by the accretion disks for a period of time. As the accretion rate\ndecreases, the magnetic flux is strong enough to obstruct gas infall, leading\nto a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD). Within this scenario, we show that the\nBZ process could produce two types of typical X-ray light curves: type I\nexhibits a long-lasting plateau, followed by a power-law decay with slopes\nranging from 5/3 to 40/9; type II shows roughly a single power-law decay with\nslope of 5/3. The former requires low magnetic filed strength, while the latter\ncorresponds to relatively high values. We search for such signatures of the\nnew-born BH from a sample of short GRBs with an internal plateau, and find two\ncandidates: GRB 101219A and GRB 160821B, corresponding to type II and type I\nlight curve, respectively. It is shown that our model can explain the data very\nwell.\n", "  We study the electronic structure of Tsai-type cluster-based quasicrystalline\napproximants, Au$_{64}$Ge$_{22}$Yb$_{14}$ (AGY-I),\nAu$_{63.5}$Ge$_{20.5}$Yb$_{16}$ (AGY-II), and Zn$_{85.4}$Yb$_{14.6}$ (Zn-Yb),\nby means of photoemission spectroscopy. In the valence band hard x-ray\nphotoemission spectra of AGY-II and Zn-Yb, we separately observe a fully\noccupied Yb 4$f$ state and a valence fluctuation derived Kondo resonance peak,\nreflecting two inequivalent Yb sites, a single Yb atom in the cluster center\nand its surrounding Yb icosahedron, respectively. The fully occupied 4$f$\nsignal is absent in AGY-I containing no Yb atom in the cluster center. The\nresults provide direct evidence for a heterogeneous valence state in AGY-II and\nZn-Yb.\n", "  With the goal of simplifying the access to science data to scientists and\ncitizens, ESA recently released ESASky (http://sky.esa.int), a new open-science\neasy-to-use portal with the science-ready Astronomy data from ESA and other\nmajor data providers. In this presentation, we announced version 2.0 of the\napplication, which includes access to all science-ready images, catalogues and\nspectra, a feature to help planning of future JWST observations, the\npossibility to search for data of all (targeted and serendipitously observed)\nSolar System Objects in Astronomy images, a first support to mobile devices and\nseveral other smaller usability features. We also discussed the future\nevolution of the portal and the lessons learnt from the 1+ year of operations\nfrom the point of view of access, visualization and manipulation of big\ndatasets (all sky maps, also called HiPS) and large catalogues (like e.g. the\nGaia DR1 catalogues or the Hubble Source Catalogue) and the design and\nvalidation principles for the development of friendly GUIs for thin layer web\nclients aimed at scientists.\n", "  Cementite-type carbides are of interest for magnetocaloric applications owing\nto their temperature- or pressure-induced magnetic phase transition. Here,\nusing first-principles calculations, we investigate the magnetism and the\nmagnetic phase transition in iron carbide (Fe3C) with the substitution of Cr\natoms at Fe sites with the strain effect. The presence of Cr atoms is found to\ngive rise to a second-order magnetic phase transition from a ferromagnetic\nphase for Fe3C to a nonmagnetic phase in chromium carbide (Cr3C).While the\nternary Fe2CrC and Cr2FeC compounds prefer the ferrimagnetic ground state, the\nmagnitudes of both the Fe and Cr spin moments, which are antiparallel in\norientation, decrease as x increases in Fe3-xCrxC (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3).\nFurthermore, the fixed spin-moment calculations indicate that the magnetization\nof Fe3-xCrxC compounds can be delicately altered via the strain effect and that\nthe magnetic-nonmagnetic phase transition occurs at an early stage of Cr\nsubstitution, x = 2.\n", "  The mass parameter of dilaton space-times is obtained as a function of the\nredshift-blueshift (zred, zblue) of photons emitted by particles orbiting in\ncircular motion around these objects and their corresponding radii.\nParticularly, we work with the generalized Chatterjee and Gibbons- Maeda\nspace-times. Both of them become the Schwarzschild black hole in certain limit\nof one of their parameters. Bounds for the values of these frequency shifts,\nthat may be observed for these metrics, are also determined.\n", "  In this paper, we study the acoustic black hole emerged from the nonextremal\nblack D3-brane, based on the holographic approaches in constructing the\nacoustic black hole in asymptotically Anti de-Sitter spacetime (AAdS) and the\neffective hydrodynamic description of the nonextremal black D3-brane. We show\nthat the holographic dual description of the acoustic black hole appeared on\nthe timelike cutoff surface in the nonextremal black D3-brane also exist. The\nduality includes the dynamical connection between the acoustic black hole and\nthe bulk gravity, a universal equation relating the Hawking-like temperature\nand the Hawking temperature, and a phonon/scalar channel quasinormal mode\ncorrespondence.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations combined with a semi-empirical van der\nWaals dispersion correction, we have investigated structural parameters, mixing\nenthalpies, and band gaps of buckled and planar few-layer In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N\nalloys. We predict that the free-standing buckled phases are less stable than\nthe planar ones. However, with hydrogen passivation, the buckled\nIn$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloys become more favorable. Their band gaps can be tuned\nfrom 6 eV to 1 eV with preservation of direct band gap and well-defined Bloch\ncharacter, making them promising candidate materials for future light-emitting\napplications. Unlike their bulk counterparts, the phase separation could be\nsuppressed in these two-dimensional systems due to reduced geometrical\nconstraints. In contrast, the disordered planar thin films undergo severe\nlattice distortion, nearly losing the Bloch character for valence bands;\nwhereas the ordered planar ones maintain the Bloch character yet with the\nhighest mixing enthalpies.\n", "  Indications of a discrepancy between simulations and data on the number of\nmuons in cosmic ray showers exist over a large span of energies. We focus on\nthe excess of multi-muon bundles observed by the DELPHI detector at LEP and on\nthe excess in the muon number in general reported by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. Even though the primary CR energies relevant for these experiments\ndiffer by orders of magnitude, we can find a single mechanism which can\nsimultaneously increase predicted muon counts for both, while not violating\nconstraints from accelerators or from the longitudinal shower development as\nobserved by the Pierre Auger Observatory. We present a brief motivation and\ndescribe a practical implementation of such a model, based on the addition of\nsoft particles to interactions above a chosen energy threshold. Results of an\nextensive set of simulations show the behavior of this model in various parts\nof a simplified parameter space.\n", "  The differential conductance map of a single electron transistor (SET)\nprovides information about a variety of parameters related to (quantum) dots,\nrelevant for semiconductor-based quantum computing schemes. However, in\nultra-scaled device architectures, identification of excited-state resonances\nof the quantum dot in the conductance map is often complicated by the\nappearance of features due to non-uniform density-of-states (DOS) of the source\nand drain reservoirs of the SET. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that the\npump-probe spectroscopic technique, originally introduced by Fujisawa et al.,\nallows the fingerprint of the reservoir-DOS to be completely suppressed while\npreserving the visibility of the excited state resonances. We also propose a\nspecific approach for performing DC Coulomb blockade spectroscopy, which can\neffectively eliminate the DOS-related features. The advantages and limitations\nof the two approaches are investigated in detail. The results demonstrated here\nmay provide an important optimization capability for emerging proposals of\ncomputer-automated control of large arrays of coupled but independently\ncontrolled charge and spin qubits.\n", "  Multifunctional smart superhydrophobic surface with full-spectrum tunable\nwettability control is fabricated through the self-assembly of the graphene and\ntitania nanofilm double-layer coating. Advanced microfluidic manipulative\nfunctions, including directional water transport, adhesion & spreading\ncontrols, droplet storage & transfer, and droplet sensing array, can be readily\nrealized on this smart surface. An in-depth mechanism study regarding the\nunderlying secrets of the tunable wettability and the UV-induced\nsuperhydrophilic conversion of anatase titania are also presented.\n", "  Ferroelectric anomalies in most classical ferroelectric materials such as\nBaTiO3 (BT) and related compounds tend to become diffuse and eventually vanish\nwhen the grain size decreases. This has led to question the very existence of\nferroelectricity for very small particles. However there are also reports in\nthe literature of ultra-high values of permittivity when specific processes or\ndoping are performed, for instance in the BT-family, or in the CaCu3Ti4O12-\nfamily and interpretations using (IBLC) have been proposed. We have considered\nthese effects in the framework of a core-shell model of ceramics. The ultrahigh\nvalues mentioned above could be reproduced by considering that the core (be it\ndielectric or ferroelectric) have non-zero conductivity. In particular a huge\nbackground of permittivity and a Maxwell Wagner relaxation were obtained in\nagreement with the experimental situation. Different types of inhomogeneity\n(grain size distribution, mixing of conductive and non-conductive phases,\nporosity) have also been considered and their effects are discussed. Finally we\nhave evaluated the potentiality of energy storage in IBLC compounds and\nobserved a reduction (compared with non-conductive ferroelectrics) by a factor\n2-4 depending on the structuration of the ceramic, which shows that the\nperformance of such compounds are lower than in optimal insulating core-shell\nstructures.\n", "  We present the appearance of negative differential resistance (NDR) in\nspin-dependent electron transport through a few-atom spin-chain. A chain of\nthree antiferromagnetically coupled Fe atoms(Fe trimer) was positioned on a\nCu2N/Cu(100) surface and contacted with the spin-polarized tip of a scanning\ntunneling microscope, thus coupling the Fe trimer to one non-magnetic and one\nmagnetic lead. Pronounced NDR appears at the low bias of 7 mV where inelastic\nelectron tunneling dynamically locks the atomic spin in a long-lived excited\nstate. This causes a rapid increase of the magnetoresistance between\nspin-polarized tip and Fe trimer and quenches elastic tunneling. By varying the\ncoupling strength between tip and Fe trimer we find that in this transport\nregime the dynamic locking of the Fe trimer competes with magnetic exchange\ninteraction, which statically forces the Fe trimer into the\nhigh-magnetoresistance state and removes the NDR.\n", "  The electrical properties of thin TiO2 films have recently been extensively\nexploited towards enabling a variety for metal-oxide electron devices:\nunipolar/bipolar semiconductor devices and/or memristors. In such efforts,\ninvestigations on the role of TiO2 as active material have been the main focus,\nhowever, electrode materials are equally important. In this work, we address\nthis need by presenting a systematic quantitative electrical characterisation\nstudy on the interface characteristics of Metal-TiO2-Metal structures. Our\nstudy employs typical contact materials that are used both as top and bottom\nelectrodes in a Metal-TiO2-Metal setting. This allows investigating the effect\nof Metal-TiO2 contacts as well as holistically studying an electrode's\ninfluence to the opposite interface, referred to as top/bottom electrodes\ncoupling. Our methodology comprises the recording of current-voltage (I-V)\ncharacteristics from a variety of solid-state prototypes in the temperature\nrange of 300-350 K and by analysing them through appropriate modelling. Clear\nfield and temperature dependent signature plots were also obtained towards\nshinning more light on the role of each material as top/bottom electrodes in\nMetal-TiO2-Metal structures. Our results provide a useful database for\nselecting appropriate electrode materials in Metal-TiO2 devices, offering new\ninsights in metal-oxide electronics applications.\n", "  We conducted $^{77}$Se-nuclear magnetic resonance studies of the iron-based\nsuperconductor FeSe in magnetic fields of 0.6 to 19 T to investigate the\nsuperconducting and normal-state properties. The nuclear spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate divided by the temperature $(T_1T)^{-1}$ increases below the\nstructural transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{s}$ but starts to be suppressed\nbelow $T^*$, well above the superconducting transition temperature\n$T_\\mathrm{c}(H)$, resulting in a broad maximum of $(T_1T)^{-1}$ at\n$T_\\mathrm{p}(H)$. This is similar to the pseudogap behavior in optimally doped\ncuprate superconductors. Because $T^*$ and $T_\\mathrm{p}(H)$ decrease in the\nsame manner as $T_\\mathrm{c}(H)$ with increasing $H$, the pseudogap behavior in\nFeSe is ascribed to superconducting fluctuations, which presumably originate\nfrom the theoretically predicted preformed pair above $T_\\mathrm{c}(H)$.\n", "  There is now abundant evidence that the luminosity of the Galactic\nsuper-massive black hole (SMBH) has not always been as low as it is nowadays.\nThe observation of varying non-thermal diffuse X-ray emission in molecular\ncomplexes in the central 300 pc has been interpreted as delayed reflection of a\npast illumination by bright outbursts of the SMBH. The observation of different\nvariability timescales of the reflected emission in the Sgr A molecular complex\ncan be well explained if the X-ray emission of at least two distinct and\nrelatively short events (i.e. about 10 years or less) is currently propagating\nthrough the region. The number of such events or the presence of a\nlong-duration illumination are open questions.\n  Variability of the reflected emission all over of the central 300 pc, in\nparticular in the 6.4 keV Fe Ka line, can bring strong constraints. To do so we\nperformed a deep scan of the inner 300 pc with XMM-Newton in 2012. Together\nwith all the archive data taken over the course of the mission, and in\nparticular a similar albeit more shallow scan performed in 2000-2001, this\nallows for a detailed study of variability of the 6.4 keV line emission in the\nregion, which we present here.\n  We show that the overall 6.4 keV emission does not strongly vary on average,\nbut variations are very pronounced on smaller scales. In particular, most\nregions showing bright reflection emission in 2000-2001 significantly decrease\nby 2012. We discuss those regions and present newly illuminated features. The\nabsence of bright steady emission argues against the presence of an echo from\nan event of multi-centennial duration and most, if not all, of the emission can\nlikely be explained by a limited number of relatively short (i.e. up to 10\nyears) events.\n", "  Phase diagram of Np-U-Zr, a key ternary alloy system of relevance for\nmetallic nuclear fuels, is still largely undetermined. Here a thermodynamic\nmodel for the Np-U-Zr system is developed based on Muggianu extrapolation of\nour models for the U-Zr, Np-Zr, and Np-U binary systems, all employing the\nCALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) method. This model reproduces available\nexperimental data for the high temperature phases reasonably well, but is\nuncertain for the lower temperature phases for which experimental data are\nscarce. Ab initio calculations are performed on the BCC phase of the Np-U-Zr\nsystem at 28 compositions employing density functional theory (DFT) both in its\nstandard form and the so-called DFT plus Hubbard U (DFT + U) modification. When\nreferencing to our CALPHAD model, standard DFT on average overestimates the\nenthalpy of mixing of the BCC phase by 0.093 eV/atom, while DFT + U reduces the\nerror to 0.009-0.036 eV/atom when the effective Hubbard U parameters are in the\nranges of single-structure optimized Ueff's determined in our previous studies\nof the Np-Zr and U-Zr systems (0.65-0.90 for Ueff(Np) and 0.99-1.49 eV for\nUeff(U), respectively). Our combined CALPHAD and ab initio modeling provides an\ninitial attempt to determine the phase diagram of the Np-U-Zr system but\nfurther work is needed for a reliable determination.\n", "  We pursue here the development of models for complex (viscoelastic) fluids in\nshallow free-surface gravity flows which was initiated by [Bouchut-Boyaval,\nM3AS (23) 2013] for 1D (translation invariant) cases. The models we propose are\nhyperbolic quasilinear systems that generalize Saint-Venant shallow-water\nequations to incompressible Maxwell fluids. The models are compatible with a\nformulation of the thermo-dynamics second principle. In comparison with\nSaint-Venant standard shallow-water model, the momentum balance includes\nextra-stresses associated with an elastic potential energy in addition to a\nhydrostatic pressure. The extra-stresses are determined by an additional tensor\nvariable solution to a differential equation with various possible time rates.\nFor the numerical evaluation of solutions to Cauchy problems, we also propose\nexplicit schemes discretizing our generalized Saint-Venant systems with\nFinite-Volume approximations that are entropy-consistent (under a CFL\nconstraint) in addition to satisfy exact (discrete) mass and momentum\nconservation laws. In comparison with most standard viscoelastic numerical\nmodels, our discrete models can be used for any retardation-time values (i.e.\nin the vanishing \"solvent-viscosity\" limit). We finally illustrate our\nhyperbolic viscoelastic flow models numerically using computer simulations in\nbenchmark test cases. On extending to Maxwell fluids some free-shear flow\ntestcases that are standard benchmarks for Newtonian fluids, we first show that\nour (numerical) models reproduce well the viscoelastic physics,\nphenomenologically at least, with zero retardation-time. Moreover, with a view\nto quantitative evaluations, numerical results in the lid-driven cavity\ntestcase show that, in fact, our models can be compared with standard\nviscoelastic flow models in sheared-flow benchmarks on adequately choosing the\nphysical parameters of our models. Analyzing our models asymptotics should\ntherefore shed new light on the famous High-Weissenberg Number Problem (HWNP),\nwhich is a limit for all the existing viscoelastic numerical models.\n", "  Understanding the dynamics during freezing of nanofluid droplets is of\nimportance from a fundamental and practical viewpoint. While the freezing of a\nwater droplet has been extensively studied, little information is available\nabout the characteristics of freezing a nanofluid droplet. Here, we report\nunique shape changes observed during the freezing process of a nanofluid\ndroplet. Instead of forming a pointy tip on the frozen deionized water droplet,\nwe found that the top of a frozen nanofluid droplet exhibits a flat plateau\nshape and such plateau becomes larger with increasing nanoparticle\nconcentration. We ascribe this characteristic shape change to an outward\nMarangoni flow which moves liquid from the droplet interior to its vertexes,\nthus engendering the volume redistribution and shape changes. Moreover, we also\nobserved a particle ring pattern formed during freezing of a nanofluid droplet,\nwhich is similar to the well-known coffee stain phenomenon occurring during\nevaporation of a water droplet with dispersed particles. We believe our\nreported phenomena are not only of fundamental interest but have potential\napplications in the freezing of nanofluids for energy storage and developing\nnanofluid based new microfabrication methods.\n", "  Isolated photons with high transverse energy have been studied in deep\ninelastic $ep$ scattering with the ZEUS detector at HERA, using an integrated\nluminosity of $326\\,$ pb$^{-1}$ in the range of exchanged-photon virtuality $10\n- 350$ GeV$^2$. Outgoing isolated photons with transverse energy $4<E_T^\\gamma<\n15$ GeV and pseudorapidity $-0.7 <\\eta^\\gamma< 0.9$ were measured with\naccompanying jets having transverse energy and pseudorapidity $2.5\n<E_T^{jet}<35$ GeV and $-1.5<\\eta^{jet}< 1.8$, respectively. Differential cross\nsections are presented for the following variables: the fraction of the\nincoming photon energy and momentum that is transferred to the outgoing photon\nand the leading jet; the fraction of the incoming proton energy transferred to\nthe photon and leading jet; the differences in azimuthal angle and\npseudorapidity between the outgoing photon and the leading jet and between the\noutgoing photon and the scattered electron. Comparisons are made with\ntheoretical predictions: a leading-logarithm Monte Carlo simulation, a\nnext-to-leading-order QCD prediction, and a prediction using the\n$k_T$-factorisation approach.\n", "  In opinion dynamics, how to model the enduring fragmentation phenomenon\n(disagreement, cleavage, and polarization) of social opinions has long\npossessed a central position. It is widely known that the confidence-based\nopinion dynamics provide an acceptant mechanism to produce fragmentation\nphenomenon. In this study, taking the famous confidence-based Hegselmann-Krause\n(HK) model, we examine the robustness of the fragmentation coming from HK\ndynamics and its variations with prejudiced and stubborn agents against random\nnoise. Prior to possible insightful explanations, the theoretical results in\nthis paper explicitly reveal that the well-appearing fragmentation of HK\ndynamics and its homogeneous variations finally vanishes in the presence of\narbitrarily tiny noise, while only the HK model with heterogenous prejudices\ndisplays a solid cleavage in noisy environment.\n", "  Methylene blue (MB) is a representative of a class of dyestuffs resistant to\nbiodegradation. This paper presents a novel photocatalytic degradation of\nmethylene blue (MB) by La modified M-type strontium hexaferrite\n(La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19) compound, which is a traditional permanent magnet and\ndisplays a large magnetic hysteresis (M-H) loop. The remnant magnetic moment\nand coercive field are determined to be 52emu/g and 5876Oe, respectively.\nUV-Visible optical spectroscopy reveals that La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 is\nsimultaneously a semiconductor, whose direct and indirect band gap energies are\ndetermined to be 1.47 eV and 0.88 eV, respectively. The near infrared band gap\nmakes it a good candidate to harvest sunlight for photocatalytic reaction or\nsolar cell devices. This magnetic compound demonstrates excellent\nphotocatalytic activity on degradation of MB under visible illumination. The\ncolour of MB dispersion solution changes from deep blue to pale white and the\nabsorbance decreases rapidly from 1.8 down to zero when the illumination\nduration extends to 6 hours. Five absorption bands did not make any blue shifts\nalong with the reaction time, suggesting a one-stepwise degradation process of\nMB, which makes La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 a unique magnetic catalyst and differs from\nTiO2 and other conventional catalysts.\n", "  In the dynamics of driven impurity models, there is a fundamental asymmetry\nbetween the processes of emission and absorption of environment excitations:\nmost of the emitted excitations are rapidly and irreversibly scattered away,\nand only a small amount of them is reabsorbed back. We propose to use a\nstochastic simulation of the irreversible quantum emission processes in\nreal-time dynamics, while taking into account the reabsorbed virtual\nexcitations by the bath discretization. The resulting method delivers a fast\nconvergence with respect to the number of bath sites, on a wide time interval,\nwithout the sign problem.\n", "  We employ the functional renormalization group to investigate the phase\ndiagram of the $t-t'$ Hubbard model on the square lattice with finite chemical\npotential $\\mu$ at zero temperature. A unified scheme to derive flow equations\nin the symmetric and symmetry broken regimes allows a consistent continuation\nof the renormalization flow in the symmetry broken regimes. At the transition\nfrom the symmetric regime to the symmetry broken regimes, our calculation\nreveals leading instabilities in the d-wave superconducting and\nantiferromagnetic channels. Furthermore, we find a first order transition\nbetween commensurate and incommensurate antiferromagnetism. In the symmetry\nbroken regimes our flow equations are able to renormalize around a changing\nFermi surface geometry. We find a coexistence of d-wave superconductivity and\nantiferromagnetism at intermediate momentum scales k. However, there is a\nmutual tendency of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism to repel each other\nat even smaller scales k, which leads to the eradication of the coexistence\nphase in the limit of macroscopic scales.\n", "  We consider the withdrawal of a ball from a fluid reservoir to understand the\nlongevity of the connection between that ball and the fluid it breaks away\nfrom, at intermediate Reynolds numbers. Scaling arguments based on the\nprocesses observed as the ball interacts with the fluid surface were applied to\nthe `pinch-off time', when the ball breaks its connection with the fluid from\nwhich it has been withdrawn, measured experimentally. At the lowest Reynolds\nnumbers tested, pinch-off occurs in a `surface seal' close to the reservoir\nsurface, where at larger Reynolds numbers pinch-off occurs in an `ejecta seal'\nclose to the ball. Our scaling analysis shows that the connection between ball\nand fluid is controlled by the fluid film draining from the ball as it\ncontinues to be winched away from the fluid reservoir. The draining flow itself\ndepends on the amount of fluid coating the ball on exit from the reservoir. We\nconsider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface\ntension driven Landau Levitch Derjaguin wetting of the surface; a\nvisco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid\nmoving with the ball through the reservoir. We show that although the pinch-off\nmechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a\ndifferent length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball\nwhen submersed.\n", "  We first propose a pedestrian review of the Coordinate Bethe Ansatz for the\n$\\delta$-Bose gas on an infinite axis. The scalar product of Bethe states,\nbriefly reviewed, provides the first keystone to compute a compact expression\nfor the Matrix Elements of the Particle Number Operator as conjectured by V.\nTerras, the main result of the following reflection.\n", "  The Fermi-LAT revealed that the census of the gamma-ray sky is dominated by\nblazars. Looking for a possible connection between radio and gamma-ray emission\nis a central issue for understanding the blazar physics, and various works were\ndedicated to this topic. However, while a strong and significant correlation\nwas found between radio and gamma-ray emission in the 0.1-100 GeV energy range,\nthe connection between radio and very high energy (VHE, E>0.1 TeV) emission is\nstill elusive. The main reason is the lack of a homogeneous VHE sky coverage,\ndue to the operational mode of the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.\nWith the present work we aim to quantify and assess the significance of the\npossible connection between high-resolution radio emission, on milliarcsecond\nscale, and GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission in blazars. For achieving our goal we\nextract two large and unbiased blazar samples from the 1FHL and 2FHL Fermi\ncatalogs, above 10 GeV and 50 GeV, respectively. To investigate how the\ncorrelation evolves as the gamma-ray energy increases, we perform the same\nanalysis by using the 0.1-300 GeV 3FGL gamma-ray energy fluxes. When we\nconsider the 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray energy range, we find a strong and\nsignificant correlation for all of the blazar sub-classes. Conversely, when we\nconsider the gamma-ray emission above 10 GeV the correlation with the radio\nemission vanishes, with the exception of the blazar sub-class of high\nsynchrotron peaked objects.\n", "  We here propose a new class of barotropic factor for matter, motivated by\nproperties of isotropic deformations of crystalline solids. Our approach is\ndubbed Anton-Schmidt's equation of state and provides a non-vanishing, albeit\nsmall, pressure term for matter. The corresponding pressure is thus\nproportional to the logarithm of universe's volume, i.e. to the density itself\nsince $V\\propto \\rho^{-1}$. In the context of solid state physics, we\ndemonstrate that by only invoking standard matter with such a property, we are\nable to frame the universe speed up in a suitable way, without invoking a dark\nenergy term by hand. Our model extends a recent class of dark energy paradigms\nnamed \\emph{logotropic} dark fluids and depends upon two free parameters,\nnamely $n$ and $B$. Within the Debye approximation, we find that $n$ and $B$\nare related to the Gr\\\"uneisen parameter and the bulk modulus of crystals. We\nthus show the main differences between our model and the logotropic scenario,\nand we highlight the most relevant properties of our new equation of state on\nthe background cosmology. Discussions on both kinematics and dynamics of our\nnew model have been presented. We demonstrate that the $\\Lambda$CDM model is\ninside our approach, as limiting case. Comparisons with CPL parametrization\nhave been also reported in the text. Finally, a Monte Carlo analysis on the\nmost recent low-redshift cosmological data allowed us to place constraints on\n$n$ and $B$. In particular, we found $n=-0.147^{+0.113}_{-0.107}$ and $B=3.54\n\\times 10^{-3}$.\n", "  The non-linear induction problem in ferromagnetic media is solved using the\nfixed-point iteration method, where the linearized problem at each iteration is\ntreated by means of a modal approach. The proposed approach does not require\nmeshing of the solution domain, which results in fast computations comparing to\nconventional mesh-based numerical techniques. Both harmonic and pulse\nexcitations are considered via Fourier and Laplace transform, respectively. An\nefficient method for the fast computation of the inverse Laplace transform of\nthe magnetic polarization signals is also devised based on the generalized\npencil-of-function (GPOF) method. Although being restricted to one dimensional\nconfigurations, the present work provide the tools for the treatment of two and\nthree dimensional problems, whose study is under way.\n", "  This paper presents the RF energy harvesting module (RECTENNA). The working\nrange of this module includes multiple bands i.e. GSM, ISM, WLAN, and UWB band.\nTo enhance the capturing RF power capability an array arrangement of coplanar\nmonopole antenna has been proposed. Wilkinson power combiner has also been\nimplemented to combine the powers of this antenna array. The RF DC converter\ncircuit having seven stages has also been integrated with this structure. This\nmodule produces the DC voltage of 1.8V with respect to +40dB RF input. It is\nthe unique module because it has no need of port connectors. The impedance\nmatching of antenna and converter has been fulfilled by incorporating the\npassive component at the combiners branch. The value of this passive component\nis kept equal to the existing value of impedance at input port of converter\ncircuit.\n", "  It is claimed that the paper by Zhong-Ying Fan and Xiaobao Wang [Phys. Rev. D\n94, 124027 (2016), arXiv: 1610.02636] on nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to\ngeneral relativity, being correct in general, in some respects repeats\npreviously obtained results without giving proper references. There is also an\nimportant point missing in this paper, but necessary for understanding the\nphysics of the system: in solutions with an electric charge, a regular center\nrequires a non-Maxwell behavior of the Lagrangian function $L(f),\\ (f=\nF_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu})$ at small $f$. Therefore, in all electric regular black\nhole solutions with a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om asymptotic, the Lagrangian $L(f)$ is\ndifferent in different parts of space, and the electromagnetic field behaves in\na singular way at surfaces where $L(f)$ suffers branching.\n", "  Composites of the type: metal - dielectrics and superconductor - dielectrics\nare studied in the quasistatic approximation. The dielectric response is\ndescribed by the spectral function $G(n,x)$, which contains effects of the\nconcentration x (of metallic resp. superconductive particles) on the dielectric\nfunction,and effects of the shape. The parameter n plays the role of the\ndepolarisation factor for dielectric materials, in metals it is a factor which\nincludes effects like shape, and a topology of the composite. There exists a\npercolation transition at $ x_{c}= \\frac{1}{3} $ which leads to a metallic-like\nfor the composite with the concentration $ x > x_{c}$. At low frequencies\ndivergence with frequency remains even when there are present dielectric\nparticles above the percolation concentration. In superconductor case the\nspectral function $G(n,x)$ may include also Josephson junction effects. We\nassume in both cases of composites two types of spheroidal particles, metal\n(superconducting) ones and dielectric ones. A dielectric function is constant\nin both cases for the dielectric material, and a dielectric function for the\nmetal and for the superconductor are used with well known form for metals and a\nclassical superconductor. A percolation transition at $ x_{c}$ leads to a\nmetallic-like absorption for the composite with $x>x_{c}$. Note that at low\nfrequencies divergence in frequency remains even when there are present\ndielectric particles above $x_{c}$. Below the percolation threshold dielectric\nproperties are modified by metalic particles. We obtain at very low\ntemperatures and low concentrations x of the superconductor the effective\ndielectric constant. The absorption part is zero in our simple case. The real\npart of the dielectric function increases with the concentration of the\nsuperconducting spheres. The frequency dependence is quadratic, it gives low\nfrequency tail.\n", "  How physical systems approach hydrodynamic behavior is governed by the decay\nof nonhydrodynamic modes. Here, we start from a relativistic kinetic theory\nthat encodes relaxation mechanisms governed by different timescales thus\nsharing essential features of generic weakly coupled nonequilib- rium systems.\nBy analytically solving for the retarded correlation functions, we clarify how\nbranch cuts arise generically from noncollective particle excitations, how they\ninterface with poles arising from collective hydrodynamic excitations, and to\nwhat extent the appearance of poles remains at best an ambiguous signature for\nthe onset of fluid dynamic behavior. We observe that processes that are slower\nthan the hydrodynamic relaxation timescale can make a system that has already\nreached fluid dynamic behavior to fall out of hydrodynamics at late times. In\naddition, the analytical control over this model allows us to explicitly\ndemonstrate how the hydrodynamic gradient expansion of the correlation\nfunctions can be Borel resummed such that the full nonperturbative information\nis recovered using perturbative input only.\n", "  An eigenstate decoherence hypothesis states that each individual eigenstate\nof a large closed system is locally classical-like. We extend this hypothesis\nto account for a typically extremely short time scale of decoherence. The\nextension implies that nondiagonal matrix elements of certain operators -\nquantumness witnesses - are suppressed as long as the energy difference between\ncorresponding eigenstates is smaller than the inverse decoherence time.\n", "  The spread of invasive species to new areas threatens the stability of\necosystems and causes major economic losses in agriculture and forestry. We\npropose a novel approach to minimizing the spread of an invasive species given\na limited intervention budget. We first model invasive species propagation\nusing Hawkes processes, and then derive closed-form expressions for\ncharacterizing the effect of an intervention action on the invasion process. We\nuse this to obtain an optimal intervention plan based on an integer programming\nformulation, and compare the optimal plan against several\necologically-motivated heuristic strategies used in practice. We present an\nempirical study of two variants of the invasive control problem: minimizing the\nfinal rate of invasions, and minimizing the number of invasions at the end of a\ngiven time horizon. Our results show that the optimized intervention achieves\nnearly the same level of control that would be attained by completely\neradicating the species, with a 20% cost saving. Additionally, we design a\nheuristic intervention strategy based on a combination of the density and life\nstage of the invasive individuals, and find that it comes surprisingly close to\nthe optimized strategy, suggesting that this could serve as a good rule of\nthumb in invasive species management.\n", "  We discuss efficient simulation and certification of the dynamics induced by\na quantum many-body Hamiltonian with short-ranged interactions, extending prior\nresults for one-dimensional systems [Osborne, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 157202\n(2006) and Lanyon, Maier et al, Nat. Phys. 13, 1158 (2017)] to lattices in\narbitrary spatial dimensions.\n", "  We find an agreement of equivariant indices of semi-classical homomorphisms\nbetween pairwise mirror branes in the GL(2) Higgs moduli space on a Riemann\nsurface. On one side we have the components of the Lagrangian brane of U(1,1)\nHiggs bundles whose mirror was proposed by Nigel Hitchin to be certain even\nexterior powers of the hyperholomorphic Dirac bundle on the SL(2) Higgs moduli\nspace. The agreement arises from a mysterious functional equation. This gives\nstrong computational evidence for Hitchin's proposal.\n", "  A plane algebraic curve whose Newton polygone contains d lattice points can\nbe given by d points it passes through. Then the coefficients of its equation\nPoisson commute having been regarded as functions of coordinates of those\npoints. It is observed in the work by O.Babelon and M.Talon, 2002. We formulate\na generalization of this fact in terms of separation of variables and prove\nrelations implying the Poisson commutativity. The examples of the integrable\nsystems obtained this way include coefficients of the Lagrange and Hermit\ninterpolation polynomials, coefficients of the Weierstrass models of curves.\n", "  We compute the single particle spectral function of a Bose liquid on a\nlattice, at integer filling, close to the superfluid-Mott transition. We use a\n`static path approximation' that retains all the classical thermal fluctuations\nin the problem, and a real space implementation of the random phase\napproximation (RPA) for the Green's functions on the thermally fluctuating\nbackgrounds. This leads to the standard RPA answers in the ground state but\ncaptures the progressive damping of the excitations with increasing\ntemperature. We focus on the momentum resolved lineshape across the superfluid\nto Bose liquid thermal transition. In the superfluid regime we observe a gapped\n`amplitude' mode, and gapless `phase' modes of positive and negative energy.\nThe dispersion and weight of these modes changes with interaction but are\nalmost temperature independent, even into the normal state, except near\ncritical coupling. The damping of the modes varies roughly as $T^{\\alpha}\nf_{\\bf k}$, where $T$ is the temperature and ${\\bf k}$ the momentum, with\n$\\alpha \\sim 0.5$ and $f_{\\bf k}$ having non trivial momentum dependence. The\nMott phase has gapped dispersive spectra. Near critical coupling the thermal\nBose `liquid' is gapped, with progressive widening of the gap with increasing\ntemperature, a feature that it shares with the Mott insulator.\n", "  This contribution is devoted to cover some technical aspects related to the\nuse of the recently proposed energy probability distribution zeros in the study\nof phase transitions. This method is based on the partial knowledge of the\npartition function zeros and has been shown to be extremely efficient to\nprecisely locate phase transition temperatures. It is based on an iterative\nmethod in such a way that the transition temperature can be approached at will.\nThe iterative method will be detailed and some convergence issues that has been\nobserved in its application to the 2D Ising model and to an artificial spin ice\nmodel will be shown, together with ways to circumvent them.\n"]}
