At first, we solve the eigen\nsolutions of a linear Dirac equation with complete eigen system, which\napproximately equals to the original equation. Take the eigen functions as base\nof Hilbert space, and expand the spinor on the bases, we convert the original\nproblem into solution of extremum of an algebraic function on the unit sphere\nof the coefficients. Then the problem can be easily solved. This is a standard\nfinite element method with strict theory for convergence and effectiveness.\n", "  If there is a null gradient field in 1+3 dimensional space-time, we can set\nup a kind of light-cone coordinate system in the space-time. In such coordinate\nsystem, the metric takes a simple form, which is much helpful for simplifying\nand solving the Einstein's field equation. This light-cone coordinate system\nhas wonderful properties and has been widely used in astrophysics to calculate\nparameters. In this paper, we give a detailed discussion for the structure of\nspace-time with light-cone coordinate system. We derive the conditions for\nexistence of such coordinate system, and show how to construct the light-cone\ncoordinate system from usual ones, then explain their geometrical and physical\nmeanings by examples.\n", "  We study up to second order the galaxy number over-density that depends on\nmagnification in redshift space on cosmological scales for a concordance model.\nThe result contains all general relativistic effects up to second order which\narise from observing on the past light cone, including all redshift and lensing\ndistortions, contributions from velocities, Sachs-Wolfe, integrated SW and\ntime-delay terms. We find several new terms and contributions that could be\npotentially important for an accurate calculation of the bias on estimates of\nnon-Gaussianity and on precision parameter estimates.\n", "  Trapped ion crystals have proved to be one of the most viable physical\nimplementations of quantum registers and a promising candidate for a scalable\nrealization of quantum networks. The latter will require the development of an\nefficient interface between trapped ions and photons. We describe two research\ndirections that are currently investigated to realize such photonic quantum\ninterfaces in free space using high numerical aperture optics. The first\napproach investigates how strong focusing of light onto a single ion can\nincrease the interaction strength to achieve efficient interaction between a\nphoton and the ion. The second approach uses a probabilistic measurement on\nscattered photons to generate entanglement between two ions that could be used\nto distribute information in a quantum network. For both approaches a higher\nnumerical aperture would increase the efficiency of the interface.\n", "  The discovery of a large number of supermassive black holes (SMBH) at\nredshifts $z > 6$, when the Universe was only 900 million years old, raises the\nquestion of how such massive compact objects could form in a cosmologically\nshort time interval. Each of the standard scenarios proposed, involving rapid\naccretion of seed black holes or black hole mergers, faces severe theoretical\ndifficulties in explaining the short-time formation of supermassive objects. In\nthis work we propose an alternative scenario for the formation of SMBH in the\nearly Universe, in which energy transfer from superconducting cosmic strings\npiercing small seed black holes is the main physical process leading to rapid\nmass increase. As a toy model, the accretion rate of a seed black hole pierced\nby two antipodal strings carrying constant current is considered. Using an\neffective action approach, which phenomenologically incorporates a large class\nof superconducting string models, we estimate the minimum current required to\nform SMBH with masses of order $M = 2 \\times 10^{9}M_{\\odot}$ by $z = 7.085$.\nThis corresponds to the mass of the central black hole powering the quasar ULAS\nJ112001.48+064124.3 and is taken as a test case scenario for early-epoch SMBH\nformation. For GUT scale strings, the required fractional increase in the\nstring energy density, due to the presence of the current, is of order\n$10^{-7}$, so that their existence remains consistent with current\nobservational bounds on the string tension. In addition, we consider an\n\"exotic\" scenario, in which an SMBH is generated when a small seed black hole\nis pierced by a higher-dimensional $F-$string, predicted by string theory. We\nfind that both topological defect strings and fundamental strings are able to\ncarry currents large enough to generate early-epoch SMBH via our proposed\nmechanism.\n", "  Given a constant magnetic field on Euclidean space ${\\mathbb R}^p$ determined\nby a skew-symmetric $(p\\times p)$ matrix $\\Theta$, and a ${\\mathbb\nZ}^p$-invariant probability measure $\\mu$ on the disorder set $\\Sigma$ which is\nby hypothesis a Cantor set, where the action is assumed to be minimal, the\ncorresponding Integrated Density of States of any self-adjoint operator\naffiliated to the twisted crossed product algebra $C(\\Sigma) \\rtimes_\\sigma\n{\\mathbb Z}^p$, where $\\sigma$ is the multiplier on ${\\mathbb Z}^p$ associated\nto $\\Theta$, takes on values on spectral gaps in the magnetic gap-labelling\ngroup. The magnetic frequency group is defined as an explicit countable\nsubgroup of $\\mathbb R$ involving Pfaffians of $\\Theta$ and its sub-matrices.\nWe conjecture that the magnetic gap labelling group is a subgroup of the\nmagnetic frequency group. We give evidence for the validity of our conjecture\nin 2D, 3D, the Jordan block diagonal case and the periodic case in all\ndimensions.\n", "  We present manifestly duality invariant, non-linear, equations of motion for\nmaximal depth, partially massless higher spins. These are based on a first\norder, Maxwell-like formulation of the known partially massless systems. Our\nmodels mimic Dirac-Born-Infeld theory but it is unclear whether they are\nLagrangian.\n", "  Complex network topologies and hyperbolic geometry seem specularly connected,\nand one of the most fascinating and challenging problems of recent complex\nnetwork theory is to map a given network to its hyperbolic space. The\nPopularity Similarity Optimization (PSO) model represents - at the moment - the\nclimax of this theory. It suggests that the trade-off between node popularity\nand similarity is a mechanism to explain how complex network topologies emerge\n- as discrete samples - from the continuous world of hyperbolic geometry. The\nhyperbolic space seems appropriate to represent real complex networks. In fact,\nit preserves many of their fundamental topological properties, and can be\nexploited for real applications such as, among others, link prediction and\ncommunity detection. Here, we observe for the first time that a\ntopological-based machine learning class of algorithms - for nonlinear\nunsupervised dimensionality reduction - can directly approximate the network's\nnode angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model into a two-dimensional space,\naccording to a similar topological organization that we named angular\ncoalescence. On the basis of this phenomenon, we propose a new class of\nalgorithms that offers fast and accurate coalescent embedding of networks in\nthe hyperbolic space even for graphs with thousands of nodes.\n", "  We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations aimed at studying the effect of\nthe magnetic suppression of turbulence (generated through various instabilities\nduring the formation of molecular clouds by converging) on the subsequent star\nformation (SF) activity. We study four magnetically supercritical models with\nmagnetic field strengths $B= 0$, 1, 2, and 3 $\\mu$G (corresponding to\nmass--to--flux ratios of $\\infty$, 4.76, 2.38, and 1.59 times the critical\nvalue), with the magnetic field, initially being aligned with the flows. We\nfind that, for increasing magnetic field strength, the clouds formed tend to be\nmore massive, denser, less turbulent, and with higher SF activity. This causes\nthe onset of star formation activity in the non--magnetic or more weakly\nmagnetized cases to be delayed by a few Myr in comparison to the more strongly\nmagnetized cases. We attribute this behavior to the suppression of the\nnonlinear thin shell instability (NTSI) by the magnetic field, previously found\nby Heitsch and coworkers. This result is contrary to the standard notion that\nthe magnetic field provides support to the clouds, thus reducing their star\nformation rate (SFR). However, our result is a completely nonlinear one, and\ncould not be foreseen from simple linear considerations.\n", "  In the framework of the minimal quartet-metric gravity/systogravity, a scalar\ngraviton/systolon is stated as a universal dark component, with supplementary\nmanifestations in the different contexts either as dark matter or dark energy.\nAn ensuing extension to the standard {\\Lambda}CDM model is developed. A\nmodification of the late expansion of the Universe, with an attractor of a\nscalar master equation defining an effective cosmological constant, which\nsupersedes the true one, is proposed. A new partial solution to the\ncosmological constant problem is discussed.\n", "  The experimental realization of time dependent ultracold lattice systems has\npaved the way towards the implementation of new Hubbard-like Hamiltonians. We\nshow that in a one dimensional two components lattice dipolar Fermi gas the\ncompetition between long range repulsion and correlated hopping induced by\nperiodically modulated on-site interaction allows for the formation of exotic\nhidden magnetic phases. The magnetism, characterized solely by string-like\nnonlocal order parameters, manifests itself both in the charge and, noticeably,\nin the spin degrees of freedom. Such behavior is enlighten by employing both\nLuttinger theory and numerical methods. Crucially the range of parameters for\nwhich hidden magnetism is present can be reached by means of the currently\navailable experimental setups and probes.\n", "  The discovery of extraterrestrial neutrinos in the $\\sim$ 30 TeV -- PeV\nenergy range by IceCube provides new constraints on high energy astrophysics.\nAn important background to the signal are the prompt neutrinos which originate\nfrom the decay of charm hadrons produced by high energy cosmic-ray particles\ninteracting in the Earth's atmosphere. It is conventional to use the\ncalculations of charm hadroproduction using gluon splitting $g \\to c \\bar c$\nalone. However, QCD predicts an additional \"intrinsic\" component of the heavy\nquark distribution which arises from diagrams where heavy quarks are multiply\nconnected to the proton's valence quarks. We estimate the prompt neutrino\nspectrum due to intrinsic charm. We find that the atmospheric prompt neutrino\nflux from intrinsic charm is comparable to those calculated using QCD\ncomputations not including intrinsic charm, once we normalize the intrinsic\ncharm differential cross sections to the ISR and the LEBC-MPS collaboration\ndata. In future, IceCube will constrain the intrinsic charm content of the\nproton and will contribute to one of the major questions in high energy physics\nphenomenology.\n", "  This bibliometric analysis focuses on the general history of climate change\nresearch and, more specifically, on the discovery of the greenhouse effect.\nFirst, the Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) is applied to a large\npublication set on climate change of 222,060 papers published between 1980 and\n2014. The references cited therein were extracted and analyzed with regard to\npublications, which are cited most frequently. Second, a new method for\nestablishing a more subject-specific publication set for applying RPYS (based\non the co-citations of a marker reference) is proposed (RPYS-CO). The RPYS of\nthe climate change literature focuses on the history of climate change research\nin total. We identified 35 highly-cited publications across all disciplines,\nwhich include fundamental early scientific works of the 19th century (with a\nweak connection to climate change) and some cornerstones of science with a\nstronger connection to climate change. By using the Arrhenius (1896) paper as a\nRPYS-CO marker paper, we selected only publications specifically discussing the\ndiscovery of the greenhouse effect and the role of carbon dioxide. Also, we\nfocused on the time period 1800-1850 to reveal the contributions of J.B.J\nFourier in terms of cited references. Using different RPYS approaches in this\nstudy, we were able to identify the complete range of works of the celebrated\nicons as well as many less known works relevant for the history of climate\nchange research. The analyses confirmed the potential of the RPYS method for\nhistorical studies: Seminal papers are detected on the basis of the references\ncited by the overall community without any further assumptions.\n", "  Mott insulators have surprised us many times by hosting new and diverse\nquantum phenomena when the frozen electrons are perturbed by various stimuli.\nSuperconductivity, metal-insulator transition, and colossal magnetoresistance\ninduced by element substitution, pressure, and magnetic field are prominent\nexamples. Here we report a novel phenomenon, namely giant diamagnetism, in the\nMott insulator Ca2RuO4 induced by electric current. With application of 1 A/cm2\ncurrent, the strongest diamagnetism among all nonsuperconducting materials is\ninduced as the system is tuned to a semimetallic state. The origin lies in the\nemergence of indirect Dirac cones in the many-body spectrum and associated\nmonopole-like anomaly in the momentum dependent susceptibility. This\nrecord-breaking and switchable diamagnetism is a new class of non-equilibrium\nquantum phenomena on the verge of Mott insulating states.\n", "  Motivated by our limited knowledge of the Higgs couplings to first two\ngeneration fermions, we analyze the collider phenomenology of a class of two\nHiggs doublet models (2HDMs) with a non-standard Yukawa sector. One Higgs\ndoublet is mainly responsible for the masses of the weak gauge bosons and the\nthird generation fermions, while the second Higgs doublet provides mass for the\nlighter fermion generations. The characteristic collider signatures of this\nsetup differ significantly from well-studied 2HDMs with natural flavor\nconservation, flavor alignment, or minimal flavor violation. New production\nmechanisms for the heavy scalar, pseudoscalar, and charged Higgs involving\nsecond generation quarks can become dominant. The most interesting decay modes\ninclude H/A -> cc, tc, {\\mu}{\\mu}, {\\tau}{\\mu} and H+ -> cb, cs, {\\mu}{\\nu}.\nSearches for low mass di-muon resonances are currently among the best probes of\nthe heavy Higgs bosons in this setup.\n", "  We review how the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) and the quest for\nlepton flavor violation are intimately correlated. Indeed the decay $\\mu \\to e\n\\gamma$ is induced by the same amplitude for different choices of in- and\noutgoing leptons. In this work, we try to address some intriguing questions\nsuch as: Which hierarchy in the charged lepton sector one should have in order\nto reconcile possible signals coming simultaneously from $g-2$ and lepton\nflavor violation? What can we learn if the $g-2$ anomaly is confirmed by the\nupcoming flagship experiments at FERMILAB and J-PARC, and no signal is seen in\nthe decay $\\mu \\rightarrow e\\gamma$ in the foreseeable future? On the other\nhand, if the $\\mu \\rightarrow e\\gamma$ decay is seen in the upcoming years, do\nwe need to necessarily observe a signal also in $g-2$?. In this attempt, we\ngenerally study the correlation between these observables in a detailed\nanalysis of simplified models. We derive master integrals and fully analytical\nand exact expressions for both phenomena, and adress other flavor violating\nsignals. We investigate under which conditions the observations can be made\ncompatible and discuss their implications. Lastly, we discuss in this context\nseveral extensions of the SM, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel, Left-Right symmetric model, $B-L$ model, scotogenic model, two Higgs\ndoublet model, Zee-Babu model, 331 model, and $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$, dark photon,\nseesaw models type~I, II and III, and also address the interplay with $\\mu \\to\neee$ decay and $\\mu-e$ conversion.\n", "  The mechanism underlying femtosecond laser pulse induced ultrafast\nmagnetization dynamics remains elusive despite two decades of intense research\non this phenomenon. Most experiments focused so far on characterizing\nmagnetization and charge carrier dynamics, while first direct measurements of\nstructural dynamics during ultrafast demagnetization were reported only very\nrecently. We here present our investigation of the infrared laser pulse induced\nultrafast demagnetization process in a thin Ni film, which characterizes\nsimultaneously magnetization and structural dynamics. This is achieved by\nemploying femtosecond time resolved X-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity\n(tr-XRMR) as probe technique. The experimental results reveal unambiguously\nthat the sub-picosecond magnetization quenching is accompanied by strong\nchanges in non-magnetic X-ray reflectivity. These changes vary with reflection\nangle and changes up to 30$\\%$ have been observed. Modeling the X-ray\nreflectivity of the investigated thin film, we can reproduce these changes by a\nvariation of the apparent Ni layer thickness of up to 1$\\%$. Extending these\nsimulations to larger incidence angles we show that tr-XRMR can be employed to\ndiscriminate experimentally between currently discussed models describing the\nultrafast demagnetization phenomenon.\n", "  Systems which can spontaneously reveal periodic evolution are dubbed time\ncrystals. This is in analogy with space crystals that display periodic behavior\nin configuration space. While space crystals are modelled with the help of\nspace periodic potentials, crystalline phenomena in time can be modelled by\nperiodically driven systems. Disorder in the periodic driving can lead to\nAnderson localization in time: the probability for detecting a system at a\nfixed point of configuration space becomes exponentially localized around a\ncertain moment in time. We here show that a three-dimensional system exposed to\na properly disordered pseudo-periodic driving may display a\nlocalized-delocalized Anderson transition in the time domain, in strong analogy\nwith the usual three-dimensional Anderson transition in disordered systems.\nSuch a transition could be experimentally observed with ultra-cold atomic\ngases.\n", "  Time-tag ultraviolet data obtained on the Hubble Space Telescope in 2013\nreveal interesting variability related to the white dwarf spin in the two\ncataclysmic variables RZ Leo and CC Scl. RZ Leo shows a period at 220s and its\nharmonic at 110s, thus identifying it as a likely Intermediate Polar (IP). The\nspin signal is not visible in a short single night of ground based data in\n2016, but the shorter exposures in that dataset indicate a possible partial\neclipse. The much larger UV amplitude of the spin signal in the known IP CC Scl\nallows the spin of 389s, previously only seen at outburst, to be visible at\nquiescence. Spectra created from the peaks and troughs of the spin times\nindicate a hotter temperature of several thousand degrees during the peak\nphases, with multiple components contributing to the UV light.\n", "  This article discusses the relationship between emergence and reductionism\nfrom the perspective of a condensed matter physicist. Reductionism and\nemergence play an intertwined role in the everyday life of the physicist, yet\nwe rarely stop to contemplate their relationship: indeed, the two are often\nregarded as conflicting world-views of science. I argue that in practice, they\ncompliment one-another, forming an awkward alliance in a fashion envisioned by\nthe Renaissance scientist, Francis Bacon. Looking at the historical record in\nclassical and quantum physics, I discuss how emergence fits into a reductionist\nview of nature. Often, a deep understanding of reductionist physics depends on\nthe understanding of its emergent consequences. Thus the concept of energy was\nunknown to Newton, Leibnitz, Lagrange or Hamilton, because they did not\nunderstand heat. Similarly, the understanding of the weak force awaited an\nunderstanding of the Meissner effect in superconductivity. Emergence can thus\nbe likened to an encrypted consequence of reductionism. Taking examples from\ncurrent research, including topological insulators and strange metals, I show\nthat the convection between emergence and reductionism continues to provide a\npowerful driver for frontier scientific research, linking the lab with the\ncosmos.\n", "  Density matrices and Discrete Wigner Functions are equally valid\nrepresentations of multiqubit quantum states. For density matrices, the partial\ntrace operation is used to obtain the quantum state of subsystems, but an\nanalogous prescription is not available for discrete Wigner Functions. Further,\nthe discrete Wigner function corresponding to a density matrix is not unique\nbut depends on the choice of the quantum net used for its reconstruction. In\nthe present work, we derive a reduction formula for discrete Wigner functions\nof a general multiqubit state which works for arbitrary quantum nets. These\nresults would be useful for the analysis and classification of entangled states\nand the study of decoherence purely in a discrete phase space setting and also\nin applications to quantum computing\n", "  The maximum entropy method (MEM) is a well known deconvolution technique in\nradio-interferometry. This method solves a non-linear optimization problem with\nan entropy regularization term. Other heuristics such as CLEAN are faster but\nhighly user dependent. Nevertheless, MEM has the following advantages: it is\nunsupervised, it has a statistical basis, it has a better resolution and better\nimage quality under certain conditions. This work presents a high performance\nGPU version of non-gridding MEM, which is tested using real and simulated data.\nWe propose a single-GPU and a multi-GPU implementation for single and\nmulti-spectral data, respectively. We also make use of the Peer-to-Peer and\nUnified Virtual Addressing features of newer GPUs which allows to exploit\ntransparently and efficiently multiple GPUs. Several ALMA data sets are used to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness in imaging and to evaluate GPU performance. The\nresults show that a speedup from 1000 to 5000 times faster than a sequential\nversion can be achieved, depending on data and image size. This allows to\nreconstruct the HD142527 CO(6-5) short baseline data set in 2.1 minutes,\ninstead of 2.5 days that takes a sequential version on CPU.\n", "  We compute semi-classical corrections to the energy of rotating Nambu-Goto\nstrings with masses at the ends, using methods from quantum field theory on\ncurved space-times. In the limit of large angular momentum, we recover the\nRegge intercept $a = 1 + \\frac{D-2}{24}$ for $D$ dimensional target space\npreviously found for the open and closed string. [Result is wrong and corrected\nin 1605.07928]\n", "  We show that due to the large coupling constant of the monopole-photon\ninteraction the annihilation of monopole-antimonopole and monopolium into many\nphotons must be considered experimentally. For monopole-antimonopole\nannihilation and lightly bound monopolium, even in the less favorable scenario,\nmulti-photon events (four and more photons in the final state) are dominant,\nwhile for strongly bound monopolium, although two photon events are important,\nfour and six photon events are also sizable.\n", "  In this paper we combine two powerful computational techniques, well-tempered\nmetadynamics and time lagged independent component analysis. The aim is to\ndevelop a new tool for studying rare events and exploring complex free energy\nlandscapes. Metadynamics is a well-established and widely used enhanced\nsampling method whose efficiency depends on an appropriate choice of collective\nvariables. Often the initial choice is not optimal leading to slow convergence.\nHowever by analyzing the dynamics generated in one such a run with a\ntime-lagged independent component analysis and the techniques recently\ndeveloped in the area of conformational dynamics, we obtain much more efficient\ncollective variables, that are also better capable of illuminating the physics\nof the system. We demonstrate the power of this approach in two paradigmatic\nexamples.\n", "  We discuss the implications of the recently reported $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$\nanomalies, the lepton flavor non-universality in the $B\\to K\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and\n$B\\to K^*\\ell^+\\ell^-$. Using two sets of hadronic inputs of form factors, we\nperform a fit of the new physics to the $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$ data, and\nsignificant new physics contributions are found. We suggest to study the lepton\nflavor universality in a number of related rare $B, B_s, B_c$ and $\\Lambda_b$\ndecay channels, and in particular we give the predictions for the $\\mu$-to-$e$\nratios of decay widths with different polarizations of the final state\nparticles, and of the $b\\to d\\ell^+\\ell^-$ processes which are presumably more\nsensitive to the structure of the underlying new physics. With the new physics\ncontributions embedded in Wilson coefficients, we present theoretical\npredictions for lepton flavor non-universality in these processes.\n", "  We propose new activity-dependent adaptive Boolean networks inspired by the\ncis-regulatory mechanism in gene regulatory networks. We analytically show that\nour model can be solved for stationary in-degree distribution for a wide class\nof update rules by employing the annealed approximation of Boolean network\ndynamics and that evolved Boolean networks have a preassigned average\nsensitivity that can be set independently of update rules if certain conditions\nare satisfied. In particular, when it is set to 1, our theory predicts that the\nproposed network rewiring algorithm drives Boolean networks towards\ncriticality. We verify that these analytic results agree well with numerical\nsimulations for four representative update rules. We also discuss the\nrelationship between sensitivity of update rules and stationary in-degree\ndistributions and compare it with that in real-world gene regulatory networks.\n", "  Qubit connectivity is an important property of a quantum processor, with an\nideal processor having random access -- the ability of arbitrary qubit pairs to\ninteract directly. Here, we implement a random access superconducting quantum\ninformation processor, demonstrating universal operations on a nine-bit quantum\nmemory, with a single transmon serving as the central processor. The quantum\nmemory uses the eigenmodes of a linear array of coupled superconducting\nresonators. The memory bits are superpositions of vacuum and single-photon\nstates, controlled by a single superconducting transmon coupled to the edge of\nthe array. We selectively stimulate single-photon vacuum Rabi oscillations\nbetween the transmon and individual eigenmodes through parametric flux\nmodulation of the transmon frequency, producing sidebands resonant with the\nmodes. Utilizing these oscillations for state transfer, we perform a universal\nset of single- and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs of modes, using only\nthe charge and flux bias of the transmon. Further, we prepare multimode\nentangled Bell and GHZ states of arbitrary modes. The fast and flexible\ncontrol, achieved with efficient use of cryogenic resources and control\nelectronics, in a scalable architecture compatible with state-of-the-art\nquantum memories is promising for quantum computation and simulation.\n", "  Nonsymmorphic symmetries, which involve fractional lattice translations in\ncrystalline materials, can generate exotic types of fermionic excitations that\nare robust against spin-orbit coupling. Here we report on a hourglass-type\ndispersion in the bulk of three-dimensional rhenium dioxide crystals, as\ndictated by its nonsymmorphic symmetries. Due to time reversal and inversion\nsymmetries, each band has an additional two-fold degeneracy, making the neck\ncrossing-point of the hourglass four-fold degenerate. Remarkably, close to the\nFermi level, the neck crossing-point traces out a Dirac chain--a chain of\nconnected four-fold-degenerate Dirac loops--in the momentum space. The symmetry\nprotection, the transformation under symmetry-breaking, and the associated\ntopological surface states of the hourglass Dirac chain are discussed.\n", "  We introduce exactly solvable gapless quantum systems in $d$ dimensions that\nsupport symmetry protected topological (SPT) edge modes. Our construction leads\nto long-range entangled, critical points or phases that can be interpreted as\ncritical condensates of domain walls \"decorated\" with dimension $(d-1)$ SPT\nsystems. Using a combination of field theory and exact lattice results, we\nargue that such gapless SPT systems have symmetry-protected topological edge\nmodes that can be either gapless or symmetry-broken, leading to unusual surface\ncritical properties. Despite the absence of a bulk gap, these edge modes are\nrobust against arbitrary symmetry-preserving local perturbations near the\nedges. In two dimensions, we construct wavefunctions that can also be\ninterpreted as unusual quantum critical points with diffusive scaling in the\nbulk but ballistic edge dynamics.\n", "  We analyze the 2.5--10 keV X-ray spectra of the luminous quasar 3C 273 and\nsimultaneous observations in UV wavelengths from XMM--Newton between 2000 and\n2015. The lowest flux level ever was observed in 2015. The continuum emission\nfrom 3C 273 is generally best described by an absorbed power-law but during\nextremely low states the addition of fluorescence from the K-shell iron line\nimproves the fit. We study the spectral evolution of the source during its\nextended quiescent state and also examine connections between the X-ray and\nultraviolet emissions, which have been seen in some, but not all, previous\nwork. We detect a possible anti-correlation between these two bands during the\nlow state that characterized 3C 273 for most of this period; however, this was\nnot present during a flaring state. A harder-when-brighter trend for the X-ray\nspectrum was observed in these long-term observations of 3C 273 for the first\ntime. We suggest that the X-ray emission in 3C 273 is the result of inverse\nCompton scattering of soft UV seed photons (emitted from the local environment\nof the AGN), most likely in a thermal corona. We can explain the significant\ntemporal variation of the spectral continuum as an outcome of changing optical\ndepth of the comptonizing medium, along the lines of the wind-shock model\nproposed by Courvoisier and Camenzind (1989).\n", "  The Kondo effect describes the spin-exchanging interaction between localized\nimpurity and the itinerant fermions. The ultracold alkaline-earth atomic gas\nprovides a natural platform for quantum simulation of the Kondo model,\nutilizing its long-lived clock state and the nuclear-spin exchanging\ninteraction between the clock state and the ground state. One of the key issue\nnow is whether the Kondo temperature can be high enough to be reached in\ncurrent experiment, for which we have proposed using a transverse confinement\nto confine atoms into a one-dimensional tube and to utilize the\nconfinement-induced resonance to enhance the Kondo coupling. In this work, we\nfurther consider the $1+0$ dimensional scattering problem when the clock state\nis further confined by an axial harmonic confinement. We show that this axial\nconfinement for the clock state atoms not only plays a role for localizing\nthem, but also can act as an additional control knob to reach the\nconfinement-induced resonance. We show that by combining both the transverse\nand the axial confinements, the confinement-induced resonance can be reached in\nthe practical conditions and the Kondo effect can be attainable in this system.\n", "  In the junction $\\Omega$ of several semi-infinite cylindrical waveguides we\nconsider the Dirichlet Laplacian whose continuous spectrum is the ray\n$[\\lambda_\\dagger, +\\infty)$ with a positive cut-off value $\\lambda_\\dagger$.\nWe give two different criteria for the threshold resonance generated by\nnontrivial bounded solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz\nequation $-\\Delta u=\\lambda_\\dagger u$ in $\\Omega$. The first criterion is\nquite simple and is convenient to disprove the existence of bounded solutions.\nThe second criterion is rather involved but can help to detect concrete shapes\nsupporting the resonance. Moreover, the latter distinguishes in a natural way\nbetween stabilizing, i.e., bounded but non-descending solutions and trapped\nmodes with exponential decay at infinity.\n", "  We show irreversibility of the renormalization group flow in non-unitary but\n${\\cal PT}$-invariant quantum field theory in two space-time dimensions. In\naddition to unbroken $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a positive energy spectrum, we\nassume standard properties of quantum field theory including a local\nenergy-momentum tensor and relativistic invariance. This generalizes\nZamolodchikov's $c$-theorem to ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric hamiltonians. Our proof\nfollows closely Zamolodchikov's arguments. We show that a function\n$c_{\\mathrm{eff}}(s)$ of the renormalization group parameter $s$ exists which\nis non-negative and monotonically decreasing along renormalization group flows.\nIts value at a critical point is the \"effective central charge\" entering the\nspecific free energy. At least in rational models, this equals\n$c_{\\mathrm{eff}}=c-24\\Delta$, where $c$ is the central charge and $\\Delta$ is\nthe lowest primary field dimension in the conformal field theory which\ndescribes the critical point.\n", "  I use Supergravity as a test case to study the role and uses of\nelegance/simplicity in formulating and evaluating physical models, whose sole\ncriterion is of course truth: an observationally verified description of Nature\nwithin a certain range of scales.\n", "  We present the measurement and interpretation of the angular power spectrum\nof nearby galaxies in the 2MASS Redshift Survey catalog with spectroscopic\nredshifts up to $z\\approx 0.1$. We detect the angular power spectrum up to a\nmultipole of $\\ell\\approx 1000$. We find that the measured power spectrum is\ndominated by galaxies living inside nearby galaxy clusters and groups. We use\nthe halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism to model the power spectrum,\nobtaining a fit with reasonable parameters. These HOD parameters are in\nagreement with the 2MASS galaxy distribution we measure toward the known nearby\ngalaxy clusters, confirming validity of our analysis.\n", "  We propose that superluminous transients that appear at central regions of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) such as CSS100217:102913+404220 (CSS100217) and\nPS16dtm, which reach near or super-Eddington luminosities of the central black\nholes, are powered by the interaction between accretion disk winds and clouds\nin broad-line regions (BLRs) surrounding them. If the disk luminosity temporary\nincreases by, e.g., limit-cycle oscillations, leading to a powerful radiatively\ndriven wind, strong shock waves propagate in the BLR. Because the dense clouds\nin the AGN BLRs typically have similar densities to those found in Type IIn\nsupernovae, strong radiative shocks emerge and efficiently convert the ejecta\nkinetic energy to radiation. As a result, transients similar to Type IIn\nsupernovae can be observed at AGN central regions. Since a typical black-hole\ndisk wind velocity is ~ 0.1c where c is the speed of light, the ejecta kinetic\nenergy is expected to be ~ 1e52 erg when ~ 1 Msun is ejected. This kinetic\nenergy is transformed to radiation energy in a timescale for the wind to sweep\nup a similar mass to itself in the BLR, which is a few hundred days. Therefore,\nboth luminosities (~ 1e44 erg/s) and timescales (~ 100 days) of the\nsuperluminous transients from AGN central regions match to those expected in\nour interaction model. If CSS100217 and PS16dtm are related to the AGN\nactivities triggered by limit-cycle oscillations, they become bright again in\ncoming years or decades.\n", "  Future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) satellite missions aim to use the\n$B$ mode polarization to measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ with a\nsensitivity of about $10^{-3}$. Achieving this goal will not only require\nsufficient detector array sensitivity but also unprecedented control of all\nsystematic errors inherent to CMB polarization measurements. Since polarization\nmeasurements derive from differences between observations at different times\nand from different sensors, detector response mismatches introduce leakages\nfrom intensity to polarization and thus lead to a spurious $B$ mode signal.\nBecause the expected primordial $B$ mode polarization signal is dwarfed by the\nknown unpolarized intensity signal, such leakages could contribute\nsubstantially to the final error budget for measuring $r.$ Using simulations we\nestimate the magnitude and angular spectrum of the spurious $B$ mode signal\nresulting from bandpass mismatch between different detectors. It is assumed\nhere that the detectors are calibrated, for example using the CMB dipole, so\nthat their sensitivity to the primordial CMB signal has been perfectly matched.\nConsequently the mismatch in the frequency bandpass shape between detectors\nintroduces difference in the relative calibration of galactic emission\ncomponents. We simulate using a range of scanning patterns being considered for\nfuture satellite missions. We find that the spurious contribution to $r$ from\nreionization bump on large angular scales ($\\ell < 10$) is $\\approx 10^{-3}$\nassuming large detector arrays and 20 percent of the sky masked. We show how\nthe amplitude of the leakage depends on the angular coverage per pixels that\nresults from the scan pattern.\n", "  Millimeter wavelength polarimetry of accreting black hole systems can provide\na tomographic probe of the accretion flow on a wide range of linear scales. We\nsearched for linear polarization in two low luminosity active galactic nuclei\n(LLAGN), M81 and M84, using the Combined Array for Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA)\nand the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We find upper limits of $\\sim 1 - 2\\%$\naveraging over the full bandwidth and with a rotation measure (RM) synthesis\ntechnique. These low polarization fractions, along with similar low values for\nLLAGN M87 and 3C84, suggest that LLAGN have qualitatively different\npolarization properties than radio-loud sources and Sgr A*. If the sources are\nintrinsically polarized and then depolarized by Faraday rotation then we place\nlower limits on the RM of a few times $10^7\\, {\\rm rad\\, m^{-2}}$ for the full\nbandwidth case and $\\sim 10^9\\, {\\rm rad\\, m^{-2}}$ for the RM synthesis\nanalysis. These limits are inconsistent with or marginally consistent with\nexpected accretion flow properties. Alternatively, the sources may be\ndepolarized by cold electrons within a few Schwarzschild radii from the black\nhole, as suggested by numerical models.\n", "  The ATLAS inner detector comprises three different sub-detectors: the pixel\ndetector, the silicon strip tracker, and the transition-radiation drift-tube\ntracker. The Insertable $B$-Layer, a new innermost pixel layer, was installed\nduring the shutdown period in 2014, together with modifications to the layout\nof the cables and support structures of the existing pixel detector. The\nmaterial in the inner detector is studied with several methods, using a\nlow-luminosity $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV $pp$ collision sample corresponding to around\n$2.0\\,\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ collected in 2015 with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.\nIn this paper, the material within the innermost barrel region is studied using\nreconstructed hadronic interaction and photon conversion vertices. For the\nforward rapidity region, the material is probed by a measurement of the\nefficiency with which single tracks reconstructed from pixel detector hits\nalone can be extended with hits on the track in the strip layers. The results\nof these studies have been taken into account in an improved description of the\nmaterial in the ATLAS inner detector simulation, resulting in a reduction in\nthe uncertainties associated with the charged-particle reconstruction\nefficiency determined from simulation.\n", "  We study primordial perturbations from hyperinflation, proposed recently and\nbased on a hyperbolic field-space. In the previous work, it was shown that the\nfield-space angular momentum supported by the negative curvature modifies the\nbackground dynamics and enhances fluctuations of the scalar fields\nqualitatively, assuming that the inflationary background is almost de Sitter.\nIn this work, we confirm and extend the analysis based on the standard approach\nof cosmological perturbation in multi-field inflation. At the background level,\nto quantify the deviation from de Sitter, we introduce the slow-varying\nparameters and show that steep potentials, which usually can not drive\ninflation, can drive inflation. At the linear perturbation level, we obtain the\npower spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation and express the spectral\ntilt and running in terms of the slow-varying parameters. We show that\nhyperinflation with power-law type potentials has already been excluded by the\nrecent Planck observations, while exponential-type potential with the exponent\nof order unity can be made consistent with observations as far as the power\nspectrum is concerned. We also argue that, in the context of a simple $D$-brane\ninflation, the hyperinflation requires exponentially large hyperbolic extra\ndimensions but that masses of Kaluza-Klein gravitons can be kept relatively\nheavy.\n", "  The tori around active galactic nuclei (AGN) are potential formation sites\nfor large amounts of dust, and they may help resolve the so-called dust budget\ncrisis at high redshift. We investigate the dust composition in 53 of the 87\nPalomar Green (PG) quasars showing the 9.7 micron silicate feature in emission.\nBy simultaneously fitting the mid-infrared spectroscopic features and the\nunderlying continuum, we estimate the mass fraction in various amorphous and\ncrystalline dust species. We find that the dust consists predominantly of\nalumina and amorphous silicates, with a small fraction in crystalline form. The\nmean crystallinity is 8 +/- 6%, with more than half of the crystallinities\ngreater than 5%, well above the upper limit determined for the Galaxy. Higher\nvalues of crystallinity are found for higher oxide fractions and for more\nluminous sources.\n", "  In the early-mid 20$^{\\rm th}$ century Dirac and Zel'dovich were among the\nfirst scientists to suggest an intimate connection between cosmology and atomic\nphysics. Though a revolutionary proposal for its time, Dirac's Large Number\nHypothesis (1937) adopted a standard assumption of the day, namely, the\nnon-existence of the cosmological constant term ($\\Lambda = 0$). As a result,\nits implementation necessitated extreme violence to the theory of general\nrelativity -- something few physicists were prepared to sacrifice in favour of\n`numerology' -- requiring a time-dependent gravitational coupling of the form\n$G(t) \\sim 1/t$. Zel'dovich's insight (1968) was to realise that a small but\nnonzero cosmological term ($\\Lambda > 0$) allowed the present day radius of the\nUniverse to be identified with the de Sitter radius, $r_{\\rm U} \\simeq l_{\\rm\ndS} \\simeq 1/{\\sqrt{\\Lambda}}$, which removed the need for time-dependence in\nthe fundamental couplings. Thus, he obtained the formula $\\Lambda \\simeq\nm^6G^2/\\hbar^4$, where $m$ is a mass scale characterising the relative\nstrengths of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, which he\nidentified with the proton mass $m_{\\rm p}$. In this paper, we review a number\nof recent arguments which, instead, suggest the identification $m = m_{\\rm\ne}/\\alpha_{\\rm e}$, where $m_{\\rm e}$ is the electron mass and $\\alpha_{\\rm e}\n= e^2/\\hbar c \\simeq 1/137$ is the usual fine structure constant. We note that\nthese are of a {\\it physical} nature and, therefore, represent an attempt to\nlift previous arguments \\emph{{\\` a} la} Dirac from the realm of numerology\ninto the realm of empirical science. If valid, such arguments suggest an\nintimate connection, not only between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds,\nbut, perhaps even more surprisingly, between the very essence of \"dark\" and\n\"light\" physics.\n", "  High visibility temporal ghost imaging with classical light is possible when\nsuperbunching pseudothermal light is employed. In the numerical simulation, the\nvisibility of temporal ghost imaging with pseudothermal light equaling ($4.7\\pm\n0.2$)\\% can be increased to ($75\\pm 8$)\\% in the same scheme with superbunching\npseudothermal light. The reasons for the difference in visibility and quality\nof the retrieved images in different situations are discussed in detail. It is\nconcluded that high visibility and high quality temporal ghost image can be\nobtained by collecting large enough number of data points. The results are\nhelpful to understand the difference between ghost imaging with classical light\nand entangled photon pairs. The superbunching pseudothermal light can be\nemployed to improve the image quality in ghost imaging applications.\n", "  Measurements of differential cross-sections of top-quark pair production in\nfiducial phase-spaces are presented as a function of top-quark and $t\\bar{t}$\nsystem kinematic observables in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV. The data set corresponds to an integrated\nluminosity of $3.2$ fb${}^{-1}$, recorded in 2015 with the ATLAS detector at\nthe CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events with exactly one electron or muon and at\nleast two jets in the final state are used for the measurement. Two separate\nselections are applied that each focus on different top-quark momentum regions,\nreferred to as resolved and boosted topologies of the $t\\bar{t}$ final state.\nThe measured spectra are corrected for detector effects and are compared to\nseveral Monte Carlo simulations by means of calculated $\\chi^2$ and $p$-values.\n", "  The existence and topological classification of lower-dimensional Fermi\nsurfaces is often tied to the crystal symmetries of the underlying lattice\nsystems. Artificially engineered lattices, such as heterostructures and other\nsuperlattices, provide promising avenues to realize desired crystal symmetries\nthat protect lower-dimensional Fermi surface, such as nodal lines. In this\nwork, we investigate a Weyl semimetal subjected to spatially periodic onsite\npotential, giving rise to several phases, including a nodal-line semimetal\nphase. In contrast to proposals that purely focus on lattice symmetries, the\nemergence of the nodal line in this setup does not require small spin-orbit\ncoupling, but rather relies on its presence. We show that the stability of the\nnodal line is understood from reflection symmetry and a combination of a\nfractional lattice translation and charge-conjugation symmetry. Depending on\nthe choice of parameters, this model exhibits drumhead surface states that are\nexponentially localized at the surface, or weakly localized surface states that\ndecay into the bulk at all energies.\n", "  We investigated the variation in the fraction of optical active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) hosts with stellar mass, as well as their local and global\nenvironments. Our sample is composed of cluster members and field galaxies at\n$z \\le 0.1$ and we consider only strong AGN. We find a strong variation in the\nAGN fraction ($F_{AGN}$) with stellar mass. The field population comprises a\nhigher AGN fraction compared to the global cluster population, especially for\nobjects with log $M_* > 10.6$. Hence, we restricted our analysis to more\nmassive objects. We detected a smooth variation in the $F_{AGN}$ with local\nstellar mass density for cluster objects, reaching a plateau in the field\nenvironment. As a function of clustercentric distance we verify that $F_{AGN}$\nis roughly constant for R $> $ R$_{200}$, but show a steep decline inwards. We\nhave also verified the dependence of the AGN population on cluster velocity\ndispersion, finding a constant behavior for low mass systems ($\\sigma_P\n\\lesssim 650-700$ km s$^{-1}$). However, there is a strong decline in $F_{AGN}$\nfor higher mass clusters ($>$ 700 km s$^{-1}$). When comparing the $F_{AGN}$ in\nclusters with or without substructure we only find different results for\nobjects at large radii (R $> $ R$_{200}$), in the sense that clusters with\nsubstructure present some excess in the AGN fraction. Finally, we have found\nthat the phase-space distribution of AGN cluster members is significantly\ndifferent than other populations. Due to the environmental dependence of\n$F_{AGN}$ and their phase-space distribution we interpret AGN to be the result\nof galaxy interactions, favored in environments where the relative velocities\nare low, typical of the field, low mass groups or cluster outskirts.\n", "  A probabilistic description is essential for understanding growth processes\nfar from equilibrium. In this paper, we compute time-dependent Probability\nDensity Functions (PDFs) in order to investigate stochastic logistic and\nGompertz models, which are two of the most popular growth models. We consider\ndifferent types of short-correlated internal (multiplicative) and external\n(additive) stochastic noises and compare the time-dependent PDFs in the two\nmodels, elucidating the effects of the additive and multiplicative noises on\nthe form of PDFs. We demonstrate an interesting transition from a unimodal to a\nbimodal PDF as the multiplicative noise increases for a fixed value of the\nadditive noise. A much weaker (leaky) attractor in the Gompertz model leads to\na significant (singular) growth of the population of a very small size. We\npoint out the limitation of using stationary PDFs, mean value and variance in\nunderstanding statistical properties of the growth far from equilibrium,\nhighlighting the importance of time-dependent PDFs. We further compare these\ntwo models from the perspective of information change that occurs during the\ngrowth process. Specifically, we define an infinitesimal distance at any time\nby comparing two PDFs at times infinitesimally apart and sum these distances in\ntime. The total distance along the trajectory quantifies the total number of\ndifferent states that the system undergoes in time, and is called the\ninformation length. We show that the time-evolution of the two models become\nmore similar when measured in units of the information length and point out the\nmerit of using the information length in unifying and understanding the dynamic\nevolution of different growth processes.\n", "  Two-dimensional atomic arrays exhibit a number of intriguing quantum optical\nphenomena, including subradiance, nearly perfect reflection of radiation and\nlong-lived topological edge states. Studies of emission and scattering of\nphotons in such lattices require complete treatment of the radiation pattern\nfrom individual atoms, including long-range interactions. We describe a\nsystematic approach to perform the calculations of collective energy shifts and\ndecay rates in the presence of such long-range interactions for arbitrary\ntwo-dimensional atomic lattices. As applications of our method, we investigate\nthe topological properties of atomic lattices both in free-space and near\nplasmonic surfaces.\n", "  The blazar 3C454.3 exhibited a strong flare seen in gamma-rays, X-rays, and\noptical/NIR bands during 3--12 December 2009. Emission in the V and J bands\nrose more gradually than did the gamma-rays and soft X-rays, though all peaked\nat nearly the same time. Optical polarization measurements showed dramatic\nchanges during the flare, with a strong anti-correlation between optical flux\nand degree of polarization (which rose from ~ 3% to ~ 20%) during the declining\nphase of the flare. The flare was accompanied by large rapid swings in\npolarization angle of ~ 170 degree. This combination of behaviors appear to be\nunique. We have cm-band radio data during the same period but they show no\ncorrelation with variations at higher frequencies. Such peculiar behavior may\nbe explained using jet models incorporating fully relativistic effects with a\ndominant source region moving along a helical path or by a shock-in-jet model\nincorporating three-dimensional radiation transfer if there is a dominant\nhelical magnetic field. We find that spectral energy distributions at different\ntimes during the flare can be fit using modified one-zone models where only the\nmagnetic field strength and particle break frequencies and normalizations need\nchange. An optical spectrum taken at nearly the same time provides an estimate\nfor the central black hole mass of ~ 2.3 * 10^9 M_sun. We also consider two\nweaker flares seen during the $\\sim 200$ d span over which multi-band data are\navailable. In one of them, the V and J bands appear to lead the $\\gamma$-ray\nand X-ray bands by a few days; in the other, all variations are simultaneous.\n", "  Dense assemblies of self-propelled particles undergo a nonequilibrium form of\nglassy dynamics. Physical intuition suggests that increasing departure from\nequilibrium due to active forces fluidifies a glassy system. We falsify this\nbelief by devising a model of self-propelled particles where increasing\ndeparture from equilibrium can both enhance or depress glassy dynamics,\ndepending on the chosen state point. We analyze a number of static and dynamic\nobservables and suggest that the location of the nonequilibrium glass\ntransition is primarily controlled by the evolution of two-point static density\ncorrelations due to active forces. The dependence of the density correlations\non the active forces varies non-trivially with the details of the system, and\nis difficult to predict theoretically. Our results emphasize the need to\ndevelop an accurate liquid state theory for nonequilibrium systems.\n", "  We studied the effects of the Tsallis distribution on the transverse momentum\nfluctuation in high energy collisions. The parton-hadron duality and the\nBose-Einstein type correlation between partons were assumed. The fluctuation\nwas calculated in the boost-invariant picture for the expectation value used in\nthe Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and for the expectation value used in the\nTsallis nonextensive statistics. It was shown that the fluctuation is a\nfunction of $\\eta$ which is the ratio of the inverse temperature to the\ncorrelation length. We found the following points: (1) the fluctuation depends\non the form of the distribution and depends weakly on the definition of the\nexpectation value used in the statistics,(2) the fluctuation increases as the\nentropic parameter value of the Tsallis distribution increases, and (3) the\nvariation of the fluctuation as a function of the entropic parameter for the\nexpectation value used in the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is larger than that\nfor the expectation value used in the Tsallis nonextensive statistics in the\nwide range of $\\eta$.\n", "  A combined resistivity and hard x-ray diffraction study of superconductivity\nand charge ordering in $\\mathrm{Ir_{1-x}Pt_xTe_2}$, as a function of Pt\nsubstitution and externally applied hydrostatic pressure, is presented.\nExperiments are focused on samples near the critical composition $x_c\\sim\n0.045$ where competition and switching between charge order and\nsuperconductivity is established. We show that charge order as a function of\npressure in $\\mathrm{Ir_{0.95}Pt_{0.05}Te_{2}}$ is preempted - and hence\ntriggered - by a structural transition. Charge ordering appears uniaxially\nalong the short crystallographic (1,0,1) domain axis with a\n$\\mathrm{(\\frac{1}{5},0,\\frac{1}{5})}$ modulation. Based on these results we\ndraw a charge-order phase diagram and discuss the relation between stripe\nordering and superconductivity.\n", "  We reexamine the equation of state for the nucleonic and hyperonic inner core\nof neutron stars that satisfies the 2$M_{\\odot}$ observations as well as the\nrecent determinations of stellar radii below 13 km, while fulfilling the\nsaturation properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei together with the\nconstraints on the high-density nuclear pressure coming from heavy-ion\ncollisions. The recent nucleonic FSU2R and hyperonic FSU2H models are fine\ntuned improving the density dependence of pure neutron matter at subsaturation\ndensities. The corresponding nuclear matter properties at saturation, the\nsymmetry energy and its slope turn out to be compatible with recent\nexperimental and theoretical determinations. We obtain the mass, radius and\ncomposition of neutron stars for the two updated models and study the impact on\nthese properties of the uncertainties in the hyperon-nucleon couplings\nestimated from hypernuclear data. We find that the onset of appearance of each\nhyperon strongly depends on the hyperon-nuclear uncertainties, whereas the\nmaximum masses for neutron stars differ by at most 0.1 $M_{\\odot}$, although a\nlarger deviation should be expected tied to the lack of knowledge of the\nhyperon potentials at the high densities present in the center of $2 M_\\odot$\nstars. For easier use, we provide tables with the results from the FSU2R and\nFSU2H models for the equation of state and the neutron star mass-radius\nrelation.\n", "  Relativistic numerical cosmology is most often based either on the exact\nsolutions of the Einstein equations, or perturbation theory, or weak-field\nlimit, or the BSSN formalism. The Silent Universe provides an alternative\napproach to investigate relativistic evolution of cosmological systems. The\nsilent universe is based on the solution of the Einstein equations in 1+3\ncomoving coordinates with additional constraints imposed. These constraints\ninclude: the gravitational field is sourced by dust and cosmological constant\nonly, both rotation and magnetic part of the Weyl tensor vanish, and the shear\nis diagnosable. This paper describes the code simsilun (free software\ndistributed under the terms of the reposi General Public License), which\nimplements the equations of the Silent Universe. The paper also discusses\napplications of the Silent Universe and it uses the Millennium simulation to\nset up the initial conditions for the code simsilun. The simulation obtained\nthis way consists of 16,777,216 worldlines, which are evolved from z=80 to z=0.\nInitially, the mean evolution (averaged over the whole domain) follows the\nevolution of the background $\\Lambda$CDM model. However, once the evolution of\ncosmic structures becomes nonlinear, the spatial curvature evolves from\n$\\Omega_K =0$ to $\\Omega_K \\approx 0.1$ at the present day. The emergence of\nthe spatial curvature is associated with $\\Omega_M$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ being\nsmaller by approximately 0.05 compared to the $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  Using the geometrical thermodynamic approach, we study phase transition of\nBrans--Dicke Born--Infeld black holes. We apply introduced methods and describe\ntheir shortcomings. We also use the recently proposed new method and compare\nits results with those of canonical ensemble. By considering the new method, we\nfind that its Ricci scalar diverges in the places of phase transition and bound\npoints. We also show that the bound point can be distinguished from the phase\ntransition points through the sign of thermodynamical Ricci scalar around its\ndivergencies.\n", "  Reflection states are introduced in the vertical and horizontal modules of\nthe Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra (quantum toroidal $\\mathfrak{gl}_1$). Webs\nof DIM representations are in correspondence with $(p,q)$-web diagrams of type\nIIB string theory, under the identification of the algebraic intertwiner of\nAwata, Feigin and Shiraishi with the refined topological vertex. Extending the\ncorrespondence to the vertical reflection states, it is possible to engineer\nthe $\\mathcal{N}=1$ quiver gauge theory of D-type (with unitary gauge groups).\nIn this way, the Nekrasov instanton partition function is reproduced from the\nevaluation of expectation values of intertwiners. This computation leads to the\nidentification of the vertical reflection state with the orientifold plane of\nstring theory. We also provide a translation of this construction in the\nIqbal-Kozcaz-Vafa refined topological vertex formalism.\n", "  We report on simultaneous wideband observations of Crab giant pulses with the\nParkes radio telescope and the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The\nobservations were conducted simultaneously at 732 and 3100 MHz with Parkes, and\nat 120.96, 165.76 and 210.56 MHz with the MWA. Flux density calibration of the\nMWA data was accomplished using a novel technique based on tied-array beam\nsimulations. We detected between 90-648 giant pulses in the 120.96-210.56 MHz\nMWA subbands above a $ 5.5\\sigma $ threshold while in the Parkes subbands we\ndetected 6344 and 231 giant pulses above a threshold of $ 6\\sigma $ at 732 and\n3100 MHz, respectively. We show, for the first time over a wide frequency\nrange, that the average spectrum of Crab giant pulses exhibits a significant\nflattening at low frequencies. The spectral index, $ \\alpha $, for giant pulses\nevolves from a steep, narrow distribution with a mean $ \\alpha=-2.6 $ and width\n$\\sigma_\\alpha=0.5 $ between 732 and 3100 MHz, to a wide, flat distribution of\nspectral indices with a mean $ \\alpha=-0.7 $ and width $ \\sigma_\\alpha=1.4 $\nbetween 120.96 and 165.76 MHz. We also comment on the plausibility of giant\npulse models for Fast Radio Bursts based on this spectral information.\n", "  Searches for anomalous $Zt$ and $\\gamma t$ production provide an excellent\nprobe of flavour-changing top interactions when the energies considered are\nvery large. In this note we estimate the sensitivity to these interactions at\nthe high luminosity phase of the LHC and a future 100 TeV $pp$ collider\n(FCC-hh). For the LHC, the expected limits on $t \\to uZ / u\\gamma $ branching\nratios from $Zt$ and $\\gamma t$ production will reach the $10^{-5}$ level, one\norder of magnitude better than the existing projections for $t \\to uZ$ from $t\n\\bar t$ production. For the FCC-hh, the limits on $t \\to uZ / u\\gamma$ could\nreach an impressive sensitivity at the $10^{-6}$ level, with limits on $t \\to\ncZ / c\\gamma$ at the $10^{-5}$ level.\n", "  The active galactic nuclei (AGN) lobe radio luminosities modelled in\nhydrodynamical simulations and most analytical models do not address the\nredistribution of the electron energies due to adiabatic expansion, synchrotron\nradiation and inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons. We present a\nsynchrotron emissivity model for resolved sources which includes a full\ntreatment of the loss mechanisms spatially across the lobe, and apply it to a\ndynamical radio source model with known pressure and volume expansion rates.\nThe bulk flow and dispersion of discrete electron packets is represented by\ntracer fields in hydrodynamical simulations; we show that the mixing of\ndifferent aged electrons strongly effects the spectrum at each point of the\nradio map in high-powered FR-II sources. The inclusion of this mixing leads to\na factor of a few discrepancy between the spectral age measured using impulsive\ninjection models (e.g. JP model) and the dynamical age. The observable\nproperties of radio sources are predicted to be strongly frequency dependent:\nFR-II lobes are expected to appear more elongated at higher frequencies, while\njetted FR-I sources appear less extended. The emerging FR0 class of radio\nsources, comprising gigahertz peaked and compact steep spectrum sources, can\npotentially be explained by a population of low-powered FR-Is. The extended\nemission from such sources is shown to be undetectable for objects within a few\norders of magnitude of the survey detection limit and to not contribute to the\ncurvature of the radio SED.\n", "  In our previous paper [H. K., J.Stat.Mech.(2015) P08020], we investigated an\ninteracting-particle model with infinite-range cosine potentials, and derived\nthe partition function which shows solid-fluid phase transition by exact\ncalculation. However, we could treat only simple lattice structures in which\nmore than one stable point exist in a primitive cell such as the triangular or\nface-centered cubic lattice. In the present paper, we generalize our previous\nscheme to more complicated lattice structures with two particles in a primitive\ncell. Generalization to more complicated lattice structures is straightforward.\n", "  Microstructure and mechanical properties of bulk polycristalline rhombohedral\nboron subnitride B13N2 synthesized by crystallization from the B-BN melt at 7\nGPa have been systematically studied by micro- and nanoindentation, atomic\nforce microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The obtained data on\nhardness, elastic properties and fracture toughness clearly indicate that B13N2\nbelongs to a family of superhard phases and can be considered as a promising\nsuperabrasive or binder for cubic boron nitride.\n", "  We introduce a nonlinear parity-time-symmetric dispersive coupler which\nadmits Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations. We show that, in spite of the\ngain and dissipation, the model has several conservation laws. The system also\nsupports a variety of exact solutions. We focus on exact bright solitons and\ndemonstrate numerically that they are dynamically stable in a wide parameter\nrange and undergo elastic interactions, thus manifesting nearly-integrable\ndynamics. Physical applications of the introduced model in the theory of\nBose-Einstein condensates in nonlinear lattices are discussed.\n", "  The production of $B^{\\pm}$ mesons is studied in $pp$ collisions at\ncentre-of-mass energies of 7 and 13 TeV, using $B^{\\pm}\\rightarrow J/\\psi\nK^{\\pm}$ decays and data samples corresponding to 1.0 fb$^{-1}$ and 0.3\nfb$^{-1}$, respectively. The production cross-sections summed over both charges\nand integrated over the transverse momentum range $0<p_{\\text{T}}< 40$ GeV/$c$\nand the rapidity range $2.0<y<4.5$ are measured to be $\\sigma(pp \\rightarrow\nB^{\\pm} X, \\sqrt{s} = \\text{7 TeV}) = 43.0 \\pm 0.2 \\pm 2.5 \\pm 1.7\\mu b,$\n$\\sigma(pp \\rightarrow B^{\\pm} X, \\sqrt{s} = \\text{13 TeV}) = 86.6 \\pm 0.5 \\pm\n5.4 \\pm 3.4\\mu b,$ where the first uncertainties are statistical, the second\nare systematic, and the third are due to the limited knowledge of the\n$B^{\\pm}\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^{\\pm}$ branching fraction. The ratio of the\ncross-section at 13 TeV to that at 7 TeV is determined to be\n$2.02\\pm0.02\\text{(stat)}\\pm0.12\\text{(syst)}$. Differential cross-sections are\nalso reported as functions of $p_{\\text{T}}$ and $y$. All results are in\nagreement with theoretical calculations based on the state-of-art fixed\nnext-to-leading order quantum chromodynamics.\n", "  The organization of the orbits of most minor bodies in the Solar system seems\nto follow random patterns, the result of billions of years of chaotic dynamical\nevolution. Much as heterogeneous orbital behaviour is ubiquitous, dynamically\ncoherent pairs and groups of objects are also present everywhere. Although\nfirst studied among the populations of asteroids and comets that inhabit or\ntraverse the inner Solar system, where they are very numerous, at least one\nasteroid family has been confirmed to exist in the outer Solar system and two\nother candidates have been proposed in the literature. Here, we perform a\nsystematic search for statistically significant pairs and groups of dynamically\ncorrelated objects through those with semimajor axis greater than 25 au,\napplying a novel technique that uses the angular separations of orbital poles\nand perihelia together with the differences in time of perihelion passage to\nsingle out pairs of relevant objects. Our analysis recovers well-known,\ndynamically coherent pairs and groups of comets and trans-Neptunian objects and\nuncovers a number of new ones, prime candidates for further spectroscopic\nstudy.\n", "  Spatial and momentum correlations are important in the analysis of the\nquantum states and different phases of trapped ultracold atom systems as a\nfunction of the strength of interatomic interactions. Identification and\nunderstanding of spin-resolved patterns exhibited in two-point correlations,\naccessible directly by experiments, are key for uncovering the symmetry and\nstructure of the many-body wave functions of the trapped system. Using the\nconfiguration interaction method for exact diagonalization of the many-body\nHamiltonian of $N=2-4$ fermionic atoms trapped in single, double, triple, and\nquadruple wells, we analyze both two-point momentum and space correlations, as\nwell as associated noise distributions, for a broad range of interparticle\ncontact repulsion strengths and interwell separations, unveiling\ncharacteristics allowing insights into the transition, via an intermediate\nphase, from the non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate to the weakly\ninteracting quasi-Bose-Einstein regime, and from the latter to the\nstrong-repulsion Tonks-Girardeau (TG) one. The ab-initio numerical predictions\nare shown to agree well with the results of a constructed analytical model\nemploying localized displaced Gaussian functions to represent the $N$ fermions.\nThe two-point momentum correlations are found to exhibit damped oscillatory\ndiffraction behavior. This diffraction behavior develops fully for atoms\ntrapped in a single well with strong interatomic repulsion in the TG regime, or\nfor atoms in well-separated multi-well traps. Additionally, the two-body\nmomentum correlation and noise distributions are found to exhibit\n\"shortsightedness\", with the main contribution coming from nearest-neighboring\nparticles.\n", "  In a seminal paper Haldane conjectured that topological phenomena are not\nparticular to quantum systems, and indeed experiments realized unidirectional,\nbackscattering-free edge modes with electromagnetic waves. This raises two\nimmediate questions: (1) Are there other topological effects in electromagnetic\nmedia? And (2) is Haldane's Quantum Hall Effect for light really analogous to\nthe Quantum Hall Effect?\n  We conclusively answer both of these questions by classifying topological\nphotonic crystals according to material (as opposed to crystallographic)\nsymmetries. It turns out there are four topologically distinct types of media,\nof which only one, gyrotropic media, is topologically non-trivial in $d = 2 ,\n3$. That means there are no as-of-yet undiscovered topological effects; in\nparticular, there is no analog of the Quantum Spin Hall Effect in classical\nelectromagnetism. Moreover, at least qualitatively, Haldane's Quantum Hall\nEffect for light is analogous to the Quantum Hall Effect from condensed matter\nphysics as both systems as in the same topological class, class A. Our ideas\nare directly applicable to other classical waves.\n", "  M. Christandl conjectured that the composition of any trace preserving PPT\nmap with itself is entanglement breaking. We prove that Christandl's conjecture\nholds asymptotically by showing that the distance between the iterates of any\nunital or trace preserving PPT map and the set of entanglement breaking maps\ntends to zero. Finally, for every graph we define a one-parameter family of\nmaps on matrices and determine the least value of the parameter such that the\nmap is variously, positive, completely positive, PPT and entanglement breaking\nin terms of properties of the graph. Our estimates are sharp enough to conclude\nthat Christandl's conjecture holds for these families.\n", "  We study a simple nonlinear model defined on the cubic lattice. We propose a\nbilinearization scheme for the field equations and demonstrate that the\nresulting system is closely related to the well-studied integrable models, such\nas the Hirota bilinear difference equation and the Ablowitz-Ladik system. This\nresult is used to derive the two sets of the N-soliton solutions.\n", "  Recent experiments on Weyl semimetals reveal that charged impurities may play\nan important role. We use a screened Coulomb disorder to model the charged\nimpurities, and study the magneto-transport in a two-node Weyl semimetal. It is\nfound that when the external magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric\nfield, the calculated longitudinal magnetoconductivity shows positive in the\nmagnetic field, which is just the negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity\n(LMR) observed in experiments. When the two fields are perpendicular to each\nother, the transverse magnetoconductivities are measured. It is found that the\nlongitudinal (transverse) magnetoconductivity is suppressed (enhanced)\nsensitively with increasing the screening length. This feature makes it hardly\nto observe the negative LMR in Weyl semimetals experimentally owing to a small\nscreening length. Our findings gain insight into further understanding on\nrecently actively debated magneto-transport behaviors in Weyl semimetals.\nFurthermore we studied the relative weight of the inter-valley scattering and\nthe intra-valley scattering. It shows that the former is as important as the\nlatter and even dominates in the case of strong magnetic fields and small\nscreening length. We emphasize that the discussions on inter-valley scattering\nis out of the realm of one-node model which has been studied.\n", "  The value of the upper critical field Hc2, a fundamental characteristic of\nthe superconducting state, has been subject to strong controversy in high-Tc\ncopper-oxides. Since the issue has been tackled almost exclusively by\nmacroscopic techniques so far, there is a clear need for local-probe\nmeasurements. Here, we use 17O NMR to measure the spin susceptibility\n$\\chi_{spin}$ of the CuO2 planes at low temperature in charge ordered\nYBa2Cu3Oy. We find that $\\chi_{spin}$ increases (most likely linearly) with\nmagnetic field H and saturates above field values ranging from 20 to 40 T. This\nresult is consistent with Hc2 values claimed by G. Grissonnanche et al. [Nat.\nCommun. 5, 3280 (2014)] and with the interpretation that the\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) reduces Hc2 in underdoped YBa2Cu3Oy. Furthermore, the\nabsence of marked deviation in $\\chi_{spin}(H)$ at the onset of long-range CDW\norder indicates that this Hc2 reduction and the Fermi-surface reconstruction\nare primarily rooted in the short-range CDW order already present in zero\nfield, not in the field-induced long-range CDWorder. Above Hc2, the relatively\nlow values of $\\chi_{spin}$ at T=2 K show that the pseudogap is a ground-state\nproperty, independent of the superconducting gap.\n", "  $\\tilde{\\delta}$ Gravity is a gravitational field model, where the geometry\nis governed by two symmetric tensors, $g_{\\mu \\nu}$ and $\\tilde{g}_{\\mu \\nu}$,\nand new matter fields ($\\tilde{\\delta}$ Matter fields) are added to the\noriginal matter fields. These new components appear motivated by a new\nsymmetry, called $\\tilde{\\delta}$ symmetry. In previous works, the model is\nused to explain the expansion of the Universe without Dark Energy and use\n$\\tilde{\\delta}$ Matter as a source of Dark Matter. In this paper, we will\ndeveloped an initial study of Schwarzschild geometry in $\\tilde{\\delta}$\nGravity to complement the Dark Matter analysis and introduce other phenomena.\nWe will get a modified deflection of light produced by the sun, the perihelion\nprecession and black hole solution.\n", "  $\\tilde{\\delta}$ Gravity is a gravitational field model, where the geometry\nis governed by two symmetric tensors, $g_{\\mu \\nu}$ and $\\tilde{g}_{\\mu \\nu}$,\nand new matter fields ($\\tilde{\\delta}$ Matter fields) are added to the\noriginal matter fields. These new components appear motivated by a new\nsymmetry, called $\\tilde{\\delta}$ symmetry. In previous works, the model is\nused to explain the expansion of the Universe without Dark Energy. This result\nand the additional contribution to the mass by $\\tilde{\\delta}$ Matter are\nmotivations to study the Dark Matter effect with $\\tilde{\\delta}$ Gravity. In\nthis work, we will derive the Non-Relativistic limit to obtain a correction to\nthe rotation velocity in a galaxy, then we will analyze the most common galaxy\ndensity profiles to describe Dark Matter.\n", "  We describe how a simple class of out of equilibrium, rotating and\nasymmetrical mass distributions evolve under their self-gravity to produce a\nquasi-planar spiral structure surrounding a virialized core, qualitatively\nresembling a spiral galaxy. The spiral structure is transient, but can survive\ntens of dynamical times, and further reproduces qualitatively noted features of\nspiral galaxies as the predominance of trailing two-armed spirals and large\npitch angles. As our models are highly idealized, a detailed comparison with\nobservations is not appropriate, but generic features of the velocity\ndistributions can be identified to be potential observational signatures of\nsuch a mechanism. Indeed, the mechanism leads generically to a characteristic\ntransition from predominantly rotational motion, in a region outside the core,\nto radial ballistic motion in the outermost parts. Such radial motions are\nexcluded in our Galaxy up to 15 kpc, but could be detected at larger scales in\nthe future by GAIA. We explore the apparent motions seen by external observers\nof the velocity distributions of our toy galaxies, and find that it is\ndifficult to distinguish them from those of a rotating disc with sub-dominant\nradial motions at levels typically inferred from observations. These simple\nmodels illustrate the possibility that the observed apparent motions of spiral\ngalaxies might be explained by non-trivial non-stationary mass and velocity\ndistributions without invoking a dark matter halo or modification of Newtonian\ngravity. In this scenario the observed phenomenological relation between the\ncentripetal and gravitational acceleration of the visible baryonic mass could\nhave a simple explanation.\n", "  The energy extinction cross section of a concentrically layered sphere varies\nwith velocity as the Doppler shift moves the spectral content of the incident\nsignal in the sphere's co-moving inertial reference frame toward or away from\nresonances of the sphere. Computations for hollow gold nanospheres show that\nthe energy extinction cross section is high when the Doppler shift moves the\nincident signal's spectral content in the co-moving frame near the wavelength\nof the sphere's localized surface plasmon resonance. The energy extinction\ncross section of a three-layer sphere consisting of an olivine-silicate core\nsurrounded by a porous and a magnetite layer, which is used to explain\nextinction caused by interstellar dust, also depends strongly on velocity. For\nthis sphere, computations show that the energy extinction cross section is high\nwhen the Doppler shift moves the spectral content of the incident signal near\neither of olivine-silicate's two localized surface phonon resonances at 9.7\n$\\mu$m and 18 $\\mu$m.\n", "  In this paper, we use deformation approach and obtain the corresponding\nLagrangian of charged test particle. Also, we show the effect of NC parameters\non the Lagrangian of test particle in HL background with charge and without\ncharge. Also, we see in case of $\\beta=\\theta$ and without charge, the deformed\nand non-deformed Lagrangian will be same. Also in case of $\\beta=\\theta$ and\nwith charge will be the same but the charge or field need some scaling.\nFinally, We show that two theories in case of $\\beta\\neq\\theta$ with charge is\ncompletely different. It means that in case of NC geometry in addition to have\ntime components of field we have $r$ and $x_{i}$ components.\n", "  An exact hairy asymptotically locally AdS black hole solution with a flat\nhorizon in the Einstein-nonlinear sigma model system in (3+1) dimensions is\nconstructed. The ansatz for the nonlinear $SU(2)$ field is regular everywhere\nand depends explicitly on Killing coordinates, but in such a way that its\nenergy-momentum tensor is compatible with a metric with Killing fields. The\nsolution is characterized by a discrete parameter which has neither topological\nnor Noether charge associated with it and therefore represents a hair. A $U(1)$\ngauge field interacting with Einstein gravity can also be included. The\nthermodynamics is analyzed. Interestingly, the hairy black hole is always\nthermodynamically favored with respect to the corresponding black hole with\nvanishing Pionic field.\n", "  We report a study of structural and electronic properties of a germanium\nlayer on Al(111) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron\ndiffraction and core-level photoelectron spectroscopy. Experimental results\nshow that a germanium layer can be formed at a relatively high substrate\ntemperature showing either (3$\\times$3) or\n($\\sqrt{7}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{7}$)R$\\pm$19.1{\\deg} reconstructions.\nFirst-principles calculations based on density functional theory suggest an\natomic model consisting of a strongly buckled (2$\\times$2) germanene layer,\nwhich is stable in two different orientations on Al(111). Simulated STM of both\norientations fit nicely with experimental STM images and the Ge 3d core-level\ndata decomposed into four components is consistent with the suggested model.\n", "  This thesis presents the design, analysis, and validation of a hierarchical\ntransactive control system that engages demand response resources to enhance\nthe integration of renewable electricity generation resources. This control\nsystem joins energy, capacity and regulation markets together in a unified\nhomeostatic and economically efficient electricity operation that increases\ntotal surplus while improving reliability and decreasing carbon emissions from\nfossil-based generation resources.\n  The work encompasses: (1) the derivation of a short-term demand response\nmodel suitable for transactive control systems and its validation with field\ndemonstration data; (2) an aggregate load model that enables effective control\nof large populations of thermal loads using a new type of thermostat (discrete\ntime with zero deadband); (3) a methodology for optimally controlling response\nto frequency deviations while tracking schedule area exports in areas that have\nhigh penetration of both intermittent renewable resources and fast-acting\ndemand response; and (4) the development of a system-wide (continental\ninterconnection) scale strategy for optimal power trajectory and resource\ndispatch based on a shift from primarily energy cost-based approach to a\nprimarily ramping cost-based one.\n  The results show that multi-layer transactive control systems can be\nconstructed, will enhance renewable resource utilization, and will operate in a\ncoordinated manner with bulk power systems that include both regions with and\nwithout organized power markets. Estimates of Western Electric Coordionating\nCouncil (WECC) system cost savings under target renewable energy generation\nlevels resulting from the proposed system exceed US$150B annually by the year\n2024, when compared to the existing control system.\n", "  It is suggested in the paper by A.J. Chambers {\\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett.\n118, 242001 (2017), arXiv:1703.01153) that the time-ordered current-curent\ncorrelator in the nucleon calculated on the lattice is to be identified as the\nforward Compton amplitude so that it is related to the sum of the even moments\nof the structure function as in the Minkowski space in the continuum. We point\nout two problems with this identification. First of all, the current-current\ncorrelator defined in the Euclidean space is not analytic everywhere on the\nrest of the complex $\\nu$ or $\\omega$ plane, besides the cuts on the real axis.\nAs such, there is no dispersion relation to relate it to its imaginary part and\nhence the moments of the structure function. On the lattice, there is an\nadditional difficulty in that the higher dimensional local operators from the\noperator production expansion (OPE) of the current-current product can mix with\nlower dimensional higher-twist operators which leads to divergences in the\npowers of inverse lattice spacing. This mixing needs to be removed before their\nmatrix elements can be identified as the moments of the structure function.\n", "  We consider two particles performing continuous-time nearest neighbor random\nwalk on $\\mathbb Z$ and interacting with each other when they are at\nneighboring positions. Typical examples are two particles in the partial\nexclusion process or in the inclusion process. We provide an exact formula for\nthe Laplace-Fourier transform of the transition probabilities of the\ntwo-particle dynamics. From this we derive a general scaling limit result,\nwhich shows that the possible scaling limits are coalescing Brownian motions,\nreflected Brownian motions, and sticky Brownian motions. In particle systems\nwith duality, the solution of the dynamics of two dual particles provides\nrelevant information. We apply the exact formula to the the symmetric inclusion\nprocess, that is self-dual, in the condensation regime. We thus obtain two\nresults. First, by computing the time-dependent covariance of the particle\noccupation number at two lattice sites we characterize the time-dependent\ncoarsening in infinite volume when the process is started from a homogeneous\nproduct measure. Second, we identify the limiting variance of the density field\nin the diffusive scaling limit, relating it to the local time of sticky\nBrownian motion.\n", "  It is shown that the irreversible behavior of classical systems of\ninteracting particles is a common property for both few-body and many-body\nsystems. It is due to the delay in the interactions between the particles.\n  PACS: 45.50.Jf Few- and many-body systems; 82.40.Bj Oscillations, chaos, and\nbifurcations; 05.70.-a Thermodynamics.\n  Keywords: irreversibility, interactions retardation.\n", "  Recently, spacetimes described by metrics with three parameters (mass,\nrotation and small quadrupole moment) was found, and in this paper, null\ngeodesics for these metrics are calculated and visualized. Light scattering, as\nwell as the role that the quadrupole moment plays in deforming these kinds of\nspacetimes are studied. This is a new application of a symbolic--numeric\nprogram that we previously used to study the Bonnor metric.\n", "  Perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells have made significant advances recently.\nIn this paper, we propose a bilayer heterojunction solar cell comprised of a\nperovskite layer combining with a IV-VI group semiconductor layer, which can\ngive a conversion efficiency even higher than the conventional perovskite solar\ncell. Such a scheme uses a property that the semiconductor layer with a direct\nband gap can be better in absorption of long wavelength light and is\ncomplementary to the perovskite layer. We studied the semiconducting layers\nsuch as GeSe, SnSe, GeS, and SnS, respectively, and found that GeSe is the\nbest, where the optical absorption efficiency in the perovskite/GeSe solar cell\nis dramatically increased. It turns out that the short circuit current density\nis enhanced 100% and the power conversion efficiency is promoted 42.7% (to a\nhigh value of 23.77%) larger than that in a solar cell with only single\nperovskite layer. The power conversion efficiency can be further promoted so\nlong as the fill factor and open-circuit voltage are improved. This strategy\nopens a new way on developing the solar cells with high performance and\npractical applications.\n", "  The thermoelectric performance of a topological energy converter is analyzed.\nThe H-shaped device is based on a combination of transverse topological effects\ninvolving the spin: the inverse spin Hall effect and the spin Nernst effect.\nThe device can convert a temperature drop in one arm into an electric power\noutput in the other arm. Analytical expressions for the output voltage, the\nfigure-of-merit (ZT) and energy converting efficiency are reported. We show\nthat the output voltage and the ZT can be tuned by the geometry of the device\nand the physical properties of the material. Importantly, contrary to a\nconventional thermoelectric device, here a low electric conductivity may in\nfact enhance the ZT value, thereby opening a path to new strategies in\noptimizing the figure-of-merit.\n", "  We have presented the results of our next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD\nanalysis of nuclear parton distribution functions (nuclear PDFs) [Phys. Rev. D\n93 (2016) 014026, arXiv:1601.00939 [hep-ph]] using all available neutral\ncurrent charged-lepton ($\\ell ^\\pm$ + nucleus) deeply inelastic scattering\n(DIS) data as well as Drell-Yan (DY) cross-section ratios $\\sigma_{\\rm\nDY}^{A}/\\sigma_{\\rm DY}^{A^\\prime}$ for a variety of nuclear targets. We have\nstudied in detail the parametrizations and the atomic mass (A) dependence of\nthe nuclear PDFs at NNLO at the input scale, $Q_0^2 = 2 \\, {\\rm GeV^2}$. Our\n{\\tt KA15} nuclear PDFs provides a complete set of nuclear PDFs, $f_i^{(A,\nZ)}(x, Q^2)$, with a full functional dependence on $x$, A, $Q^2$. The\nuncertainties of the obtained nuclear modification factors for each parton\nflavour as well as the corresponding observables are estimated using the\nwell-known Hessian method. The nuclear heavy quark contributions are also\nincluded into the analysis in the framework of zero-mass variable flavour\nnumber scheme (ZM-VFNS). We compare the results of our parametrization with all\navailable nuclear DIS data and the results of other nuclear PDFs groups. We\nhave found that our nuclear PDFs to be in reasonably good agreement with\nresults in the literature. The estimates of errors provided by our global\nanalysis ({\\tt KA15}) are rather smaller than those of other groups. We have\nbriefly reviewed different aspects of recent LHC heavy-ion collisions data\nincluding the first experimental data from the LHC proton+lead ($p-pb$) and\nlead+lead ($pb-pb$) run which can be used in the global fits of nuclear PDFs.\n", "  Intensity interferometry (II) exploits the second-order correlation to\nacquire the spatial frequency information of an object, which has been used to\nobserve distant stars since 1950s. However, due to unreliability of employed\nimaging reconstruction algorithms, II can only image simple and sparse objects\nsuch as double stars. We here develop a method that overcomes this\nunreliability problem and enables imaging complex objects by combing II and a\nptychography iterative algorithm. Different from previous ptychography\niterative-type algorithms that work only for diffractive objects using\ncoherence light sources, our method obtains the objects spatial spectrum from\nthe second-order correlation of intensity fluctuation by using an incoherent\nsource, which therefore largely simplifies the imaging process. Furthermore, by\nintroducing loose supports in the ptychography algorithm, a high-quality image\ncan be recovered without knowing the precise size and position of the scanning\nillumination, which is a strong requirement for traditional ptychography\niterative algorithm.\n", "  We analyze 494 main sequence turnoff and subgiant stars from the AMBRE:HARPS\nsurvey. These stars have accurate astrometric information from\n\\textit{Gaia}/DR1, providing reliable age estimates with relative uncertainties\nof $\\pm1-2$ Gyr and allowing precise orbital determinations. The sample is\nsplit based on chemistry into a low-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often\nidentified as thin disk stellar populations, and a high-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which\nare often associated with the thick disk. We find that the high-[Mg/Fe]\nchemical sequence has extended star formation for several Gyr and is coeval\nwith the oldest stars of the low-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence: both the low- and\nhigh-[Mg/Fe] sequences were forming stars at the same time. The high-[Mg/Fe]\nstellar populations are only vertically extended for the oldest, most-metal\npoor and highest [Mg/Fe] stars. When comparing vertical velocity dispersion for\nboth sequences, the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence has lower velocity dispersion than\nthe low-[Mg/Fe] sequence for stars of similar age. Identifying either group as\nthin or thick disk based on chemistry is misleading. The stars belonging to the\nhigh-[Mg/Fe] sequence have perigalacticons that originate in the inner disk,\nwhile the perigalacticons of stars on the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence are generally\naround the solar neighborhood. From the orbital properties of the stars, the\nhigh-and low-[Mg/Fe] sequences are most likely a reflection of the chemical\nenrichment history of the inner and outer disk populations; radial mixing\ncauses both populations to be observed in situ at the solar position. Based on\nthese results, we emphasize that it is important to be clear in defining what\npopulations are being referenced when using the terms thin and thick disk, and\nthat ideally the term thick disk should be reserved for purely geometric\ndefinitions to avoid confusion and be consistent with definitions in external\ngalaxies.\n", "  We present composite broad-line region (BLR) reverberation-mapping lag\nmeasurements for \\halpha, \\hbeta, \\HeII\\,$\\lambda4686$ and \\MgII\\ for a sample\nof 144, $z\\lesssim 1$ quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation\nMapping (SDSS-RM) project. Using only the 32-epoch spectroscopic light curves\nin the first 6-month season of SDSS-RM observations, we compile\ncorrelation-function measurements for individual objects and then coadd them to\nallow the measurement of the average lags for our sample at mean redshifts of\n$0.4$ (for \\halpha) and $\\sim 0.65$ (for the other lines). At similar quasar\nluminosities and redshifts, the sample-averaged lag decreases in the order of\n\\MgII, \\halpha, \\hbeta\\ and \\HeII. This decrease in lags is accompanied by an\nincrease in the mean line width of the four lines, and is roughly consistent\nwith the virialized motion for BLR gas in photoionization equilibrium. These\nare among the first RM measurements of stratified BLR structure at $z>0.3$.\nDividing our sample by luminosity, \\halpha\\ shows clear evidence of increasing\nlags with luminosity, consistent with the expectation from the measured BLR\nsize-luminosity relation based on \\hbeta. The other three lines do not show a\nclear luminosity trend in their average lags due to the limited dynamic range\nof luminosity probed and the poor average correlation signals in the divided\nsamples, a situation that will be improved with the incorporation of additional\nphotometric and spectroscopic data from SDSS-RM. We discuss the utility and\ncaveats of composite-lag measurements for large statistical quasar samples with\nreverberation-mapping data.\n", "  Though much work has been done on ensemble clustering in data mining, the\napplication of ensemble methods to community detection in networks is in its\ninfancy. In this paper, we propose two ensemble methods: ENDISCO and MEDOC.\nENDISCO performs disjoint community detection. In contrast, MEDOC performs\ndisjoint, overlapping, and fuzzy community detection and represents the first\never ensemble method for fuzzy and overlapping community detection. We run\nextensive experiments with both algorithms against both synthetic and several\nreal-world datasets for which community structures are known. We show that\nENDISCO and MEDOC both beat the best-known existing standalone community\ndetection algorithms (though we emphasize that they leverage them). In the case\nof disjoint community detection, we show that both ENDISCO and MEDOC beat an\nexisting ensemble community detection algorithm both in terms of multiple\naccuracy measures and run-time. We further show that our ensemble algorithms\ncan help explore core-periphery structure of network communities, identify\nstable communities in dynamic networks and help solve the \"degeneracy of\nsolutions\" problem, generating robust results.\n", "  The aim of our study is to investigate the dynamics of possible comets in the\nHD 10180 system. This investigation is motivated by the discovery of exocomets\nin various systems, especially $\\beta$ Pictoris, as well as in at least ten\nother systems. Detailed theoretical studies about the formation and evolution\nof star--planet systems indicate that exocomets should be quite common. Further\nobservational results are expected in the foreseeable future, in part due to\nthe availability of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Nonetheless, the Solar\nSystem represents the best studied example for comets, thus serving as a prime\nmotivation for investigating comets in HD 10180 as well. HD 10180 is strikingly\nsimilar to the Sun. This system contains six confirmed planets and (at least)\ntwo additional planets subject to final verification. In our studies, we\nconsider comets of different inclinations and eccentricities and find an array\nof different outcomes such as encounters with planets, captures, and escapes.\nComets with relatively large eccentricities are able to enter the inner region\nof the system facing early planetary encounters. Stable comets experience\nlong-term evolution of orbital elements, as expected. We also tried to\ndistinguish cometary families akin to our Solar System but no clear distinction\nbetween possible families was found. Generally, theoretical and observational\nstudies of exoplanets have a large range of ramifications, involving the\norigin, structure and evolution of systems as well as the proliferation of\nwater and prebiotic compounds to terrestrial planets, which will increase their\nchances of being habitable.\n", "  Polycrystalline samples of double perovskites Ba2BOsO6 (B = Sc, Y, In) were\nsynthesized by solid state reactions. They adopt the cubic double perovskite\nstructures (space group, Fm-3m) with ordered B and Os arrangements. Ba2BOsO6 (B\n= Sc, Y, In) show antiferromagnetic transitions at 93 K, 69 K, and 28 K,\nrespectively. The Weiss-temperatures are -590 K for Ba2ScOsO6, -571 K for\nBa2YOsO6, and -155 K for Ba2InOsO6. Sc3+ and Y3+ have the open-shell d0\nelectronic configuration, while In3+ has the closed-shell d10. This indicates\nthat a d0 B-type cation induces stronger overall magnetic exchange interactions\nin comparison to a d10. Comparison of Ba2BOsO6 (B = Sc, Y, In) to their Sr and\nCa analogues shows that the structural distortions weaken the overall magnetic\nexchange interactions.\n", "  CS 1246 is a hot subdwarf B star discovered in 2009 to exhibit a single,\nlarge-amplitude radial pulsation. An O-C diagram constructed from this mode\nrevealed reflex motion due to the presence of a low-mass M dwarf, as well as a\nlong-term trend consistent with a decrease in the pulsational period. The\norbital reflex motion was later confirmed with radial velocity measurements.\nUsing eight years of data collected with the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network,\nwe show that the pulsation amplitude of CS 1246 is decaying nonlinearly. We\nalso present an updated O-C diagram, which might now indicate a positive $\\dot\nP$ and a new $2.09 \\pm 0.05$ yr oscillation consistent with orbital reflex\nmotion of the entire inner sdB+dM binary, possibly due to the gravitational\ninfluence of a circumbinary planet with minimum mass $m\\sin i = 3.3 \\, \\pm \\,\n^{2.1}_{1.2}$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$. However, unlike the presence of the M dwarf, we\nhesitate to claim this object as a definitive detection since intrinsic\nvariability of the pulsation phase could theoretically produce a similar\neffect.\n", "  Surface-plasmon-polariton waves propagating at the interface between a metal\nand a dielectric, hold the key to future high-bandwidth, dense on-chip\nintegrated logic circuits overcoming the diffraction limitation of photonics.\nWhile recent advances in plasmonic logic have witnessed the demonstration of\nbasic and universal logic gates, these CMOS oriented digital logic gates cannot\nfully utilize the expressive power of this novel technology. Here, we aim at\nunraveling the true potential of plasmonics by exploiting an enhanced native\nfunctionality - the majority voter. Contrary to the state-of-the-art plasmonic\nlogic devices, we use the phase of the wave instead of the intensity as the\nstate or computational variable. We propose and demonstrate, via numerical\nsimulations, a comprehensive scheme for building a nanoscale cascadable\nplasmonic majority logic gate along with a novel referencing scheme that can\ndirectly translate the information encoded in the amplitude and phase of the\nwave into electric field intensity at the output. Our MIM-based 3-input\nmajority gate displays a highly improved overall area of only 0.636 {\\mu}m$^2$\nfor a single-stage compared with previous works on plasmonic logic. The\nproposed device demonstrates non-Boolean computational capability and can find\ndirect utility in highly parallel real-time signal processing applications like\npattern recognition.\n", "  In classical thermodynamics, irreversible processes are accomplished with an\nincrease of entropy and a release of heat into the environment. In the case of\nblack hole thermodynamics, instead, the increase of entropy is related with the\nabsorption of energy from the outside of the black hole. Based on this analogy,\nthe black hole is considered as a thermodynamic open system in the\nnon-equilibrium regime during the absorption. Applying a novel result, we\nobtain a detailed balance relation for the macroscopic absorption of an\nastronomical object by an static spherically symmetric black hole. Because of\nthe special characteristic of the thermodynamic system, it is necessary to\ninclude an additional term for the entropy produced by the absorption, allowing\nus to set a lower bound for the entropy production due to internal processes\nassociated to the fluctuation.\n", "  A numerical method is presented which conveniently computes upper bounds on\nheat transport and poloidal energy in plane layer convection for infinite and\nfinite Prandtl numbers. The bounds obtained for the heat transport coincide\nwith earlier results. These bounds imply upper bounds for the poloidal energy\nwhich follow directly from the definitions of dissipation and energy. The same\nconstraints used for computing upper bounds on the heat transport lead to\nimproved bounds for the poloidal energy.\n", "  Broad efforts are underway to capture metadata about research software and\nretain it across services; notable in this regard is the CodeMeta project. What\nmetadata are important to have about (research) software? What metadata are\nuseful for searching for codes? What would you like to learn about astronomy\nsoftware? This BoF sought to gather information on metadata most desired by\nresearchers and users of astro software and others interested in registering,\nindexing, capturing, and doing research on this software. Information from this\nBoF could conceivably result in changes to the Astrophysics Source Code Library\n(ASCL) or other resources for the benefit of the community or provide input\ninto other projects concerned with software metadata.\n", "  A sub-population of energetic rotation-powered pulsars show high fluxes of\npulsed non-thermal hard X-ray emission. While this MeV pulsar population\nincludes some radio-loud pulsars like the Crab, a significant number have no\ndetected radio or GeV emission, a mystery since gamma- ray emission is a common\ncharacteristic of pulsars with high spin-down power. Their steeply rising hard\nX-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggest peaks at 0.1 - 1 MeV but\nthey have not been detected above 200 keV. Several upcoming and planned\ntelescopes may shed light on the MeV pulsars. The Neutron star Interior\nComposition ExploreR (NICER) will observe pulsars in the 0.2 - 12 keV band and\nmay discover additional MeV pulsars. Planned telescopes, such as All-Sky\nMedium-Energy Gamma-Ray Observatory (AMEGO) and e-ASTROGAM, will detect\nemission above 0.2 MeV and polarization in the 0.2 - 10 MeV band. We present a\nmodel for the spectrum and polarization of MeV pulsars where the X-ray emission\ncomes from electron- positron pairs radiating in the outer magnetosphere and\ncurrent sheet. This model predicts that the peak of the SED increases with\nsurface magnetic field strength if the pairs are produced in polar cap\ncascades. For small inclination angles, a range of viewing angles can miss both\nthe radio pulse and the GeV pulse from particles accelerating near the current\nsheet. Characterizing the emission and geometry of MeV pulsars can thus provide\nclues to the source of pairs and acceleration in the magnetosphere.\n", "  Copper bromide vapor laser is the most successful sealed-off version of a\nplenty of copper vapor lasers launched, studied and produced for the last half\nof century. Being first reported in 1975, it became the leading and\nlong-lasting R&D&T project followed by the Laboratory of metal vapor lasers in\nInstitute of solid state physics of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences ever\nsince. This manuscript gathers major research & development results of the last\nstudies unfolding unexplored and unknown optical, electric and thermal\nproperties of CuBr laser held in the Laboratory of metal vapor lasers during\nforegoing 20+ years. Some of these new aftermaths are record-high power,\nefficiency and lifetime of CuBr laser; comprehensive studies of energy\ndissipation and dynamics of the electric field of CuBr laser; achievement of\nhigh-brightness diffraction-limited throughout-pulse emission of\nmaster-oscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) CuBr laser and high focusability of\nCuBr laser emission low-affected by beam profile intensity variations.\n", "  Motivated by the intriguing behavior displayed in a dynamic network that\nmodels a population of extreme introverts and extroverts (XIE), we consider the\nspectral properties of ensembles of random split graph adjacency matrices. We\ndiscover that, in general, a gap emerges in the bulk spectrum between -1 and 0\nthat contains a single eigenvalue. An analytic expression for the bulk\ndistribution is derived and verified with numerical analysis. We also examine\ntheir relation to chiral ensembles, which are associated with bipartite graphs.\n", "  Turbulent flows under transcritical conditions are present in regenerative\ncooling systems of rocker engines and extraction processes in chemical\nengineering. The turbulent flows and the corresponding heat transfer phenomena\nin these complex processes are still not well understood experimentally and\nnumerically. The objective of this work is to investigate the turbulent flows\nunder transcritical conditions using DNS of turbulent channel flows. A fully\ncompressible solver is used in conjunction with a Peng-Robinson real-fluid\nequation of state to describe the transcritical flows. A channel flow with two\nisothermal walls is simulated with one heated and one cooled boundary layers.\nThe grid resolution adopted in this study is slightly finer than that required\nfor DNS of incompressible channel flows. The simulations are conducted using\nboth fully (FC) and quasi-conservative (QC) schemes to assess their performance\nfor transcritical wall-bounded flows. The instantaneous flows and the\nstatistics are analyzed and compared with the canonical theories. It is found\nthat results from both FC and QC schemes qualitatively agree well with\nnoticeable difference near the top heated wall, where spurious oscillations in\nvelocity can be observed. Using the DNS data, we then examine the usefulness of\nTownsend attached eddy hypothesis in the context of flows at transcritical\nconditions. It is shown that the streamwise energy spectrum exhibits the\ninverse wavenumber scaling and that the streamwise velocity structure function\nfollows a logarithmic scaling, thus providing support to the attached eddy\nmodel at transcritical conditions.\n", "  The accurate and robust simulation of transcritical real-fluid flows is\ncrucial for many engineering applications. Diffused interface methods are\nfrequently employed and several numerical schemes have been developed for\nsimulating transcritical flows. These schemes can be categorized into two\ntypes, namely fully conservative and quasi-conservative schemes. An adaptive\nscheme which is a hybrid of the two is developed in this study. By considering\nseveral numerical test cases, it is shown that different schemes predict\ndistinctly different mixing behaviors. It is shown that the mixing processes\nfollow the isobaric-adiabatic and isobaric-isochoric mixing models for fully\nand quasi-conservative schemes, respectively, and the adaptive scheme yields a\nmixing behavior that spans both models. The distinct mixing behaviors are a\nconsequence of numerical diffusion instead of physical diffusion and can be\nattributed to insufficient numerical spatial resolution. This work provides a\nbetter understanding on the interpretation of numerical simulation results and\nthe mixing models that are commonly used to study transcritical flows.\n", "  We present filamentary structure analysis based on the CARMA Orion Project\nthrough which we obtained high resolution (0.01pc) and high dynamic range\n(2~deg in DEC) images of the Orion A molecular cloud. We show a preliminary\nemission map of the $^{13}$CO emission with the addition of identified\nfilaments. The data product resulted from 1500~hr of observing time at CARMA\ninterferometer, and the Nobeyama 45~m telescope. We address basic filament\nproperties along with calculated typical kinematical properties. Furthermore,\nwe present a pilot study where we compare the observed [C{\\sc II}] and [C{\\sc\nI}] emission to $^{13}$CO emission towards 6 selected filaments in Orion~A.\n", "  In this paper the production cross section $pp\\rightarrow (\\gamma, Z) \\to\n\\nu_\\tau \\bar \\nu_\\tau \\gamma+X$ in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=8, 13, 14,\n33TeV$ is presented. Furthermore, we estimate bounds at the $95\\%C. L.$ on the\ndipole moments of the tau-neutrino using integrated luminosity of ${\\cal L}=20,\n50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 3000 fb^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the\nLHC and we consider systematic uncertainties of $\\delta_{sys}=0, 5, 10\\%$. It\nis shown that the process under consideration is a good prospect for probing\nthe dipole moments of the tau-neutrino at the LHC.\n", "  Determining how much of the sensory information carried by a neural code\ncontributes to behavioral performance is key to understand sensory function and\nneural information flow. However, there are as yet no analytical tools to\ncompute this information that lies at the intersection between sensory coding\nand behavioral readout. Here we develop a novel measure, termed the\ninformation-theoretic intersection information $I_{II}(S;R;C)$, that quantifies\nhow much of the sensory information carried by a neural response R is used for\nbehavior during perceptual discrimination tasks. Building on the Partial\nInformation Decomposition framework, we define $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ as the part of\nthe mutual information between the stimulus S and the response R that also\ninforms the consequent behavioral choice C. We compute $I_{II}(S;R;C)$ in the\nanalysis of two experimental cortical datasets, to show how this measure can be\nused to compare quantitatively the contributions of spike timing and spike\nrates to task performance, and to identify brain areas or neural populations\nthat specifically transform sensory information into choice.\n", "  The formation of a star is a dynamic process fed by the gravitational\ncollapse of a molecular cloud core. Theoretical models and observations suggest\nthat the majority of this infalling material settles into a protoplanetary disk\nbefore reaching the (proto)star and therefore that disk accretion processes are\nresponsible for the rate at which the (proto)star grows. There is no\nfundamental reason why infall and disk accretion need to be instantaneously\nidentical. Indeed, even within the disk it might be anticipated that there are\nregions of strong and weak accretion. Together these facts suggest that\n(proto)stellar mass assembly should be both secular and stochastic and that the\nunderlying physical processes leading to these time-variable accretion rates\nshould manifest in observable time-dependent accretion luminosity variations.\n", "  The localized dielectric breakdown had been considered as the driving force\nfor growth of plasma electrolytic oxide (PEO) coatings for several decades.\nHowever, the TEM study here reveals the dielectric breakdown behavior has\nlittle contribution for coating thickening. The presented evidences show the\nnature of PEO coating growth in all three consecutive stages I-III is ionic\nmigration behavior inside the amorphous alumina layer (AAL) at the\ncoating/matrix interface. The evolution of morphological characterizations in\nthe PEO process is attributed to the interfacial reactions of AAL/alkaline\n(stage I), AAL/discharge-on-surface (stage II) and AAL/discharge-in-pore (stage\nIII).\n", "  Understanding infrared (IR) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the\ncosmic star formation history and AGN evolution. Japanese infrared satellite,\nAKARI, provided unique data sets to probe this both at low and high redshift;\nthe AKARI all sky survey in 6 bands (9-160 $\\mu$m), and the AKARI NEP survey in\n9 bands (2-24$\\mu$m). The AKARI performed all sky survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18,\n65, 90, 140, and 160 $\\mu$m) with 3-10 times better sensitivity than IRAS,\ncovering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission.\nCombined with a better spatial resolution, we measure the total infrared\nluminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies, and thus, the total infrared\nluminosity density of the local Universe much more precisely than previous\nwork. In the AKARI NEP wide field, AKARI has obtained deep images in the\nmid-infrared (IR), covering 5.4 deg$^2$. However, our previous work was limited\nto the central area of 0.25 deg$^2$ due to the lack of deep optical coverage.\nTo rectify the situation, we used the newly advent Subaru telescope's Hyper\nSuprime-Cam to obtain deep optical images over the entire 5.4 deg$^2$ of the\nAKARI NEP wide field.\n  With this deep and wide optical data, we, for the first time, can use the\nentire AKARI NEP wide data to construct restframe 8$\\mu$m, 12$\\mu$m, and total\ninfrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2. A continuous 9-band\nfilter coverage in the mid-IR wavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, and\n24$\\mu$m) by the AKARI satellite allowed us to estimate restframe 8$\\mu$m and\n12$\\mu$m luminosities without using a large extrapolation based on a SED fit,\nwhich was the largest uncertainty in previous work. By combining these two\nresults, we reveal dust-hidden cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution\nfrom z=0 to z=2.2, all probed by the AKARI satellite.\n", "  We determine the dynamical black hole mass in NGC404 including modeling of\nthe nuclear stellar populations. We combine \\hst/STIS spectroscopy with WFC3\nimages to create a local color-\\ml~relation derived from stellar population\nmodeling of the STIS data. We then use this to create a mass model for the\nnuclear region. We use Jeans modeling to fit this mass model to adaptive optics\nstellar kinematic observations from Gemini/NIFS. From our stellar dynamical\nmodeling, we find a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the black hole mass of\n$1.5\\times10^5$\\Msun.\n", "  A detector undergoing a huge acceleration measures a thermal distribution\nwith the Unruh temperature out of the Minkowski vacuum. Though such huge\naccelerations occur naturally in astrophysics and gravity, one may design\nuntraintense laser facility to detect the Unruh effect and simulate laboratory\nastrophysics. We derive the QED vacuum polarization and the vacuum persistence\namplitude as well as the Schwinger pair creation in an accelerating frame when\na constant electric field exists in the Minkowski spacetime. We advance a\nthermal interpretation of Schwinger pair creation in the Rindler space.\n", "  Further studies on the corner singularity of GS reconstruction are are\ncompiled in this paper. It's focused on solution of the Data Completion (DC)\nproblem with the Extended Hilbert Transform (EHT) over plane rectangular\nregion. Optimal selections of the regular parameters in{\\it Tikhonov} solution\nof corresponding DC problem are developed in this study. The 6-parameter\nregular solutions and the {\\it Jacobian} matrix and one {\\it Hessian} tensor to\nthe regular parameters are derived in this work. A concise formula for EHT in\nthe near field of corners, which shows property for EHT near the corner, are\nalso provided. It serves as the additional constraints for our parameter\noptimization problem (OP). Third, a nonlinear convex function defined by the\nregular solution and the corner constraints is introduced and is taken as the\nobject function for the OP of the 6 regular parameters on half-space\n$(\\mathbf{p}>0)$. Given an initial guess of $\\mathbf{p}_0$, the optimal\nparameters are solved from the OP through a well known constrained nonlinear\noptimization method. Last, the benchmark tests to the proposed solution\napproach are carried out, and detailed results from totally 9 different\nbench-cases are tabulated. In contrast to solutions with given regular\nparameters, our bench results demonstrate that an objective way for selection\nof the optimal $\\mathbf{p}$ is successfully laid out here. Robustness and\nefficiency of the suggested new approach are also highlighted in this study.\n", "  In this paper we study the relativistic bulk tensor, shear tensor and the\nshear stress viscosity of the relativistic accretion disks around the rotating\nblack holes. we calculate all non-zero components of the bulk tensor, shear\ntensor and shear stress viscosity in the equatorial plan in the BLF. We obtain\nthe relations of the relativistic bulk tensor, shear tensor and shear stress\nviscosity in the terms of components of four velocity and derivatives,\nChristoffel symbols and metric components. To see the behaviorr of the\ncomponents of relativistic bulk tensor, shear tensor and shear stress\nviscosity, we introduce a radial form for the radial component of the four\nvelocity in the LNRF then all components of the bulk tensor, shear tensor and\nshear stress viscosity are derived in BLF. Figures of non-zero components of\nthe bulk tensor, shear tensor and shear stress viscosity are shown for some\nstates. The importance and influence of the relativistic bulk viscosity in the\naccretion disks around the rotating black holes are studied in this paper.\n", "  Superconducting and topological states are two distinct quantum states of\nmatter. Superconductors with topologically nontrivial electronic states provide\na platform to study the interplay between them. Recent study revealed that a\nbulk superconductor PdTe2 is a topological Dirac semimetal with type-II Dirac\nfermions. However, the Dirac fermions in PdTe2 have no contribution to the\nsuperconducting pair because the Dirac points reside far below the Fermi level\n(EF). Here, we show that in the isostructural compounds (Ir1-xPtx)Te2, the\ntype-II Dirac points can be adjusted to EF by element substitution at x ~ 0.1,\nfor which the bulk superconductivity appears near 2 K. The (Ir1-xPtx)Te2\nsuperconductor with the Dirac points at EF paves the way for studying the\nrelevant exotic physical phenomena such as topological superconductivity in\nDirac semimetals.\n", "  We develop stability analysis for matter-wave solitons in a two-dimensional\n(2D) Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in an optical lattice (OL), to which\nperiodic time modulation is applied, in different forms. The stability is\nstudied by dint of the variational approximation and systematic simulations.\nFor solitons in the semi-infinite gap, well-defined stability patterns are\nproduced under the action of the attractive nonlinearity, clearly exhibiting\nthe presence of resonance frequencies. The analysis is reported for several\ntime-modulation formats, including the case of in-phase modulations of both\nquasi-1D sublattices, which build the 2D square-shaped OL, and setups with\nasynchronous modulation of the sublattices. In particular, when the modulations\nof two sublattices are phase-shifted by {\\delta}={\\pi}/2, the stability map is\nnot improved, as the originally well-structured stability pattern becomes fuzzy\nand the stability at high modulation frequencies is considerably reduced. Mixed\nresults are obtained for anti-phase modulations of the sublattices\n({\\delta}={\\pi}), where extended stability regions are found for low modulation\nfrequencies, but for high frequencies the stability is weakened. The analysis\nis also performed in the case of the repulsive nonlinearity, for solitons in\nthe first finite bandgap. It is concluded that, even though stability regions\nmay be found, distinct stability boundaries for the gap solitons cannot be\nidentified clearly. Finally, the stability is also explored for vortex solitons\nof both the \"square-shaped\" and \"rhombic\" types (i.e., off- and\non-site-centered ones).\n", "  The spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of low-temperature monoclinic\nFe3O4 was investigated by first-principles calculations.\n", "  A novel method is proposed here to precisely model the multi-dimensional\nfeatures of QCD multi-jet events in hadron collisions. The method relies on the\nschematization of high-pT QCD processes as 2->2 reactions made complex by\nsub-leading effects. The construction of libraries of hemispheres from\nexperimental data and the definition of a suitable nearest-neighbor-based\nassociation map allow for the generation of artificial events that reproduce\nwith surprising accuracy the kinematics of the QCD component of original data,\nwhile remaining insensitive to small signal contaminations. The method is\nsuccinctly described and its performance is tested in the case of the search\nfor the hh->bbbb process at the LHC.\n", "  We develop a virtual cycle approach towards generalized Donaldson-Thomas\ntheory of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be the moduli stack of\nGieseker semistable sheaves of fixed topological type on a Calabi-Yau threefold\n$W$. We construct an associated Deligne-Mumford stack $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}$\nwith an induced semi-perfect obstruction theory of virtual dimension zero and\ndefine the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant of $W$ via Kirwan blowups to\nbe the degree of the virtual cycle $[\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}]^{\\mathrm{vir}}$.\nWe show that it is invariant under deformations of the complex structure of\n$W$.\n", "  The increase of astronomical data produced by a new generation of\nobservational tools poses the need to distribute data and to bring computation\nclose to the data. Trying to answer this need, we set up a federated data and\ncomputing infrastructure involving an international cloud facility, EGI\nfederated, and a set of services implementing IVOA standards and\nrecommendations for authentication, data sharing and resource access. In this\npaper we describe technical problems faced, specifically we show the designing,\ntechnological and architectural solutions adopted. We depict our technological\noverall solution to bring data close to computation resources. Besides the\nadopted solutions, we propose some points for an open discussion on\nauthentication and authorization mechanisms.\n", "  We prove estimates for the Green's function of the discrete bilaplacian in\nsquares and cubes in two and three dimensions which are optimal except possibly\nnear the corners of the square and the edges and corners of the cube. The main\nidea is to transfer estimates for the continuous bilaplacian using a new\ndiscrete compactness argument and a discrete version of the Cacciopoli (or\nreverse Poincar\\'e) inequality. One application that we have in mind is the\nstudy of entropic repulsion for the membrane model from statistical physics.\n", "  The organic spinterface describes the spin-polarized properties that develop,\ndue to charge transfer, at the interface between a ferromagnetic metal (FM) and\nthe molecules of an organic semiconductor. Yet, if the latter is also magnetic\n(e.g. molecular spin chains), the interfacial magnetic coupling can generate\ncomplexity within magnetotransport experiments. Also, assembling this interface\nmay degrade the properties of its constituents (e.g. spin crossover or\nnon-sublimable molecules). To circumvent these issues, one can separate the\nmolecular and FM films using a less reactive nonmagnetic metal (NM).\nSpin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on the prototypical\nsystem Co(001)//Cu/Mnphthalocyanine (MnPc) reveal that the Cu/MnPc spinterface\natop ferromagnetic Co is highly spin-polarized at room temperature, up to Cu\nspacer thicknesses of at least 10 monolayers. Ab-initio theory describes a spin\npolarization of the topmost Cu layer after molecular hybridization that can be\naccompanied by magnetic hardening effects. This spinterface's unexpected\nrobustness paves the way for 1) integrating electronically fragile molecules\nwithin organic spinterfaces, and 2) manipulating molecular spin chains using\nthe well-documented spin transfer torque properties of the FM/NM bilayer.\n", "  In this proceedings application of a fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM)\nlearning algorithm, to classify mid-infrared (MIR) sources from the AKARI NEP\nDeep field into three classes: stars, galaxies and AGNs, is presented. FSVM is\nan improved version of the classical SVM algorithm, incorporating measurement\nerrors into the classification process; this is the first successful\napplication of this algorithm in the astronomy. We created reliable catalogues\nof galaxies, stars and AGNs consisting of objects with MIR measurements, some\nof them with no optical counterparts. Some examples of identified objects are\nshown, among them O-rich and C-rich AGB stars.\n", "  A joint project between the Canadian Astronomy Data Center of the National\nResearch Council Canada, and the italian Istituto Nazionale di\nAstrofisica-Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste (INAF-OATs), partially funded\nby the EGI-Engage H2020 European Project, is devoted to deploy an integrated\ninfrastructure, based on the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)\nstandards, to access and exploit astronomical data. Currently CADC-CANFAR\nprovides scientists with an access, storage and computation facility, based on\nsoftware libraries implementing a set of standards developed by the\nInternational Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). The deployment of a twin\ninfrastructure, basically built on the same open source software libraries, has\nbeen started at INAF-OATs. This new infrastructure now provides users with an\nAccess Control Service and a Storage Service. The final goal of the ongoing\nproject is to build an integrated infrastructure geographycally distributed\nproviding complete interoperability, both in users access control and data\nsharing. This paper describes the target infrastructure, the main user\nrequirements covered, the technical choices and the implemented solutions.\n", "  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a means of generating keys between a pair\nof computing hosts that is theoretically secure against cryptanalysis, even by\na quantum computer. Although there is much active research into improving the\nQKD technology itself, there is still significant work to be done to apply\nengineering methodology and determine how it can be practically built to scale\nwithin an enterprise IT environment. Significant challenges exist in building a\npractical key management service for use in a metropolitan network. QKD is\ngenerally a point-to-point technique only and is subject to steep performance\nconstraints. The integration of QKD into enterprise-level computing has been\nresearched, to enable quantum-safe communication. A novel method for\nconstructing a key management service is presented that allows arbitrary\ncomputing hosts on one site to establish multiple secure communication sessions\nwith the hosts of another site. A key exchange protocol is proposed where\nsymmetric private keys are granted to hosts while satisfying the scalability\nneeds of an enterprise population of users. The key management service operates\nwithin a layered architectural style that is able to interoperate with various\nunderlying QKD implementations. Variable levels of security for the host\npopulation are enforced through a policy engine. A network layer provides key\ngeneration across a network of nodes connected by quantum links. Scheduling and\nrouting functionality allows quantum key material to be relayed across trusted\nnodes. Optimizations are performed to match the real-time host demand for key\nmaterial with the capacity afforded by the infrastructure. The result is a\nflexible and scalable architecture that is suitable for enterprise use and\nindependent of any specific QKD technology.\n", "  The properties of circum-galactic gas in the halo of quasar host galaxies are\ninvestigated analyzing Mg II 2800 and C IV 1540 absorption-line systems along\nthe line of sight close to quasars. We used optical spectroscopy of closely\naligned pairs of quasars (projected distance $\\leq$ 200 kpc, but at very\ndifferent redshift) obtained at the VLT and Gran Telescopio Canarias to\ninvestigate the distribution of the absorbing gas for a sample of quasars at\nz$\\sim$1. Absorption systems of EW $\\geq$ 0.3 $\\rm{\\AA}$ associated with the\nforeground quasars are revealed up to 200 kpc from the centre of the host\ngalaxy, showing that the structure of the absorbing gas is patchy with a\ncovering fraction quickly decreasing beyond 100 kpc. In this contribution we\nuse optical and near-IR images obtained at VLT to investigate the relations\nbetween the properties of the circum-galactic medium of the host galaxies and\nof the large scale galaxy environments of the foreground quasars.\n", "  Vibrational energy transfer from photo-excited single-wall carbon nanotubes\n(SWCNTs) to coupled proteins is a key to engineer thermally induced biological\nreactions such as photothermal therapy. Here, we explored vibrational energy\ntransfer from the photo-excited SWCNTs to different adsorbed biological\nmaterials by means of a femtosecond pump-probe technique. We show that the\nvibrational relaxation time of the radial breathing modes (RBMs) in SWCNTs\nsignificantly depends on the structure of coupled materials, i.e. proteins or\nbiopolymers, indicating the vibrational energy transfer is governed by overlap\nof phonon density of states between the SWCNTs and coupled materials.\n", "  We report BRITE-Constellation photometry of the beta Cep pulsator xi 1 CMa.\nAnalysis of these data reveals a single pulsation period of 0.2095781(3) d,\nalong with its first and second harmonics. We find no evidence for any other\nfrequencies, limiting the value of this star as a target for\nmagneto-asteroseismology. We em- ploy the 17-year database of RV measurements\nof xi 1 CMa to evaluate evidence for the reported change in pulsation period,\nand interpret this period change in terms of stellar evolution. We measure a\nrate-of-change of the period equal to 0.009(1) s/yr, consistent with that\nreported in the literature.\n", "  Among the elements exhibiting non-mass dependent isotopic variations in\nmeteorites, chromium (Cr) has been central in arguing for an isotopic\nhomogeneity between the Earth and the Moon. However, the 54Cr isotope\ncomposition of the Moon relies on 2 samples only, which define an average value\nthat is slightly different from the terrestrial standard. Here, by determining\nthe Cr isotopic composition of 17 lunar, 9 terrestrial and 5 enstatite\nchondrite samples, we re-assess the isotopic similarity between these different\nplanetary bodies, and provide the first robust estimate for the Moon. In\naverage, terrestrial and enstatite samples show similar eps_54Cr. On the other\nhand, lunar samples show variables excesses of 53Cr and 54Cr compared to\nterrestrial and enstatite chondrites samples with correlated eps_53Cr and\neps_54Cr (per 10,000 deviation of the 53Cr/52Cr and 54Cr/52Cr ratios normalized\nto the 50Cr/52Cr ratio from Cr standard). Unlike previous suggestions, we show\nfor the first time that cosmic irradiation can affect significantly the Cr\nisotopic composition of lunar materials. Moreover, we also suggest that rather\nthan spallation reactions, neutron capture effects are the dominant process\ncontrolling the Cr isotope composition of lunar igneous rocks. This is\nsupported by the correlation between eps_53Cr and eps_54Cr, and 150Sm/152Sm\nratios. After correction of these effects, the average eps_54Cr of the Moon is\nindistinguishable from the terrestrial and enstatite chondrite materials\nreinforcing the idea of an Earth-Moon-Enstatite chondrite system homogeneity.\nThis is compatible with the most recent scenarios of Moon formation suggesting\nan efficient physical homogenization after a high-energy impact on a fast\nspinning Earth, and/or with an impactor originating from the same reservoir in\nthe inner proto-planetary disk as the Earth and enstatite chondrites and having\nsimilar composition.\n", "  In this work, we present a class of new designs for reversible binary and BCD\nadder circuits. The proposed designs are primarily optimized for the number of\nancilla inputs and the number of garbage outputs and are designed for possible\nbest values for the quantum cost and delay. First, we propose two new designs\nfor the reversible ripple carry adder: (i) one with no input carry $c_0$ and no\nancilla input bits, and (ii) one with input carry $c_0$ and no ancilla input\nbits. The proposed reversible ripple carry adder designs with no ancilla input\nbits have less quantum cost and logic depth (delay) compared to their existing\ncounterparts in the literature. In these designs, the quantum cost and delay\nare reduced by deriving designs based on the reversible Peres gate and the TR\ngate. Next, four new designs for the reversible BCD adder are presented based\non the following two approaches: (i) the addition is performed in binary mode\nand correction is applied to convert to BCD when required through detection and\ncorrection, and (ii) the addition is performed in binary mode and the result is\nalways converted using a binary to BCD converter. The proposed reversible\nbinary and BCD adders can be applied in a wide variety of digital signal\nprocessing applications and constitute important design components of\nreversible computing.\n", "  Purpose - The purpose of this work is to determine dependence of the\nseparative power of the Iguassu gas centrifuge (GC) on the velocity of the\nrotor.\n  Design/methodology/approach - The dependence is determined by means of\ncomputer simulation of the gas flow in the GC and numerical solution of the\ndiffusion equation for the light component of the binary mixture of uranium\nisotopes. 2D axisymmetric model with the sources/sinks of the mass, angular\nmomentum and energy reproducing the scoops was explored for the computer\nsimulation. Parameters of the model correspond to the parameters of the\nso-called Iguassu centrifuge. The separative power has been optimised in\nrelation to the pressure of the gas, temperature of the gas, the temperature\ndrop along the rotor, power of the source of angularmomentum and energy, feed\nflow and geometry of the lower baffle.\n  Findings - In the result, the optimised separative power depends only on the\nvelocity, length and diameter of the rotor. The dependence on the velocity is\ndescribed by the power law function with the power law index 2.6 which\ndemonstrate stronger dependence on the velocity than it follows from\nexperimental data. However, the separative power obtained with limitation on\nthe pressure growth with the velocity depends on the velocity on the power\nsimilar to 2 which well agree with the experiments.\n  Originality/value - For the first time, the optimised separative power of the\nGCs have been calculated via numerical simulation of the gas flow and diffusion\nof the binary mixture of isotope.\n", "  Magnetic properties of fcc structured ferromagnetic films with the number of\nspin layers up to seventy was described using third order perturbed Heisenberg\nHamiltonian. The variation of magnetic easy direction, magnetic energies in\neasy and hard directions, magnetic anisotropy energy and the angle between easy\nand hard directions was investigated by varying the number of spin layers. Spin\nexchange interaction, magnetic dipole interaction, second and fourth order\nmagnetic anisotropies, in and out of plane applied magnetic fields,\ndemagnetization factor and stress induced anisotropy were considered in the\nmodel. Because magnetic dipole interaction and demagnetization factor represent\nmicroscopic and macroscopic properties of the sample, respectively, both these\nterms were incorporated in our theoretical model. Although our model is a\nsemi-classical model, some discrete variations of angle of easy axis were\nobserved. Our theoretical data qualitatively agree with experimental data of Fe\nand Ni ferromagnetic films.\n", "  Relativistic bound state problem in hadron physics is studied. Mesons and\ntheir resonance excitations in the framework of Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\n(RQM) are investigated. Two-particle wave equation for the Lorentz scalar QCD\ninspired funnel-type potential with the coordinate dependent strong coupling\n$\\alpha_\\S(r)$ is derived. The concept of distance dependent particle mass is\ndeveloped. Two exact asymptotic expressions for the system's squared mass are\nobtained and used to derive the meson interpolating complex-mass formula. Free\nparticle hypothesis for the bound state is developed: quark and antiquark move\nas free particles in of the bound system. Practical applications of the model\nare given.\n", "  We are living through the dawn of the era of gravitational wave astronomy.\nOur first glances through this new window upon the sky has revealed a new\npopulation of objects. Since it first began observing in late 2015, the\nadvanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has\ndetected gravitational waves three times, along with an additional strong\ncandidate -- and there shall be orders of magnitude more in the years to come.\nIn all four cases, the waveform's signature is consistent with general\nrelativity's predictions for the merging of two black holes. Through parameter\nestimation studies, estimates on features such as the black holes' masses and\nspins have been determined. At least two of the black hole pairs lie above the\nmass range spanned by comparable black holes observed through traditional\nmeans. This suggests they constitute a separate population, either too elusive\nor rare to be found with traditional telescopes.\n  The most natural questions to ask about these black holes -- how did they\nform, how many of them are there, and how can they be categorized -- remain\nopen ended. We know black holes can form when massive stars die, so it's most\nnatural to claim stars as their progenitors. Since we now know black holes\nmerge into larger black holes, could it be the case that they formed from\nprevious mergers? Were the two black holes part of a binary from their birth,\nor did they become coupled later on in life? The measurements provided by LIGO\ncan help answer these questions and more.\n  Throughout this thesis, I will describe and demonstrate results from a number\nof novel methods whose purpose is to better understand these black holes and\ntheir progenitors. At their heart, these methods give answers to a few,\ncritical questions.\n  [truncated]\n", "  A new investigation of the variability of the SPB-type star 53 Per is\npresented. The analysis of the BRITE photometry allowed us to determine eight\nindependent frequencies and the combination one. Five of these frequencies and\nthe combination one were not known before. In addition, we gathered more than\n1800 new moderate and high-resolution spectra of 53 Per spread over\napproximately six months. Their frequency analysis revealed four independent\nfrequencies and the combination one, all consistent with the BRITE results.\n", "  We describe a new style of MOOC designed to engage students with an immersive\nmultimedia environment including text, images, video lectures, computer-based\nsimulations, animations, and tutorials. Quantum Mechanics for Everyone is\ncurrently running on EdX and has been successful by a number of different\nmeasures. It illustrates both how one can teach complex quantum phenomena to\nnonscientists and how one can develop high quality interactive computer\nsimulations that engage the students and can be widely deployed.\n", "  We describe simulations of Proteins and artificial pseudo-molecules\ninteracting and shaping lipid bilayer membranes. We extract protein diffusion\nParameters, membrane deformation profiles and the elastic properties of the\nused membrane models in preparation of calculations based on a large scale\ncontinuum model.\n", "  As \"Stern-Gerlach first\" becomes the new paradigm within the undergraduate\nquantum mechanics curriculum, we show how one can extend the treatment found in\nconventional textbooks to cover some of the exciting new developments within\nthe quantum field. Namely, we illustrate how one can employ Dirac notation and\nconventional quantum rules to describe a delayed choice variant of the quantum\neraser which is realized within the Stern-Gerlach framework. Covering this\nmaterial, allows the instructor to reinforce notions of changes of basis\nfunctions, quantum superpositions, quantum measurement, and the complementarity\nprinciple as expressed in whether we know \"which-way\" information or not. It\nalso allows the instructor to dispel common misconceptions of when a\nmeasurement occurs and when a system is in a superposition of states. We\ncomment at the end how a similar methodology can be employed when the more\nconventional two-slit experiment is treated.\n", "  Large orbital angular momentum can be generated in non-central heavy-ion\ncollisions, and part of it is expected to be converted into final particle's\npolarization due to the spin-orbit coupling. Within the framework of A\nMulti-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, we studied the vorticity-induced\npolarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons at the midrapidity region $|\\eta|<1$ in\nAu-Au collisions at energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7\\sim200$ GeV. Our results show\nthat the global polarization decreases with the collisional energies and is\nconsistent with the recent STAR measurements. This behavior can be understood\nby less asymmetry of participant matter in the midrapidity region due to faster\nexpansion of fireball at higher energies. As another evidence, we discuss how\nmuch the angular momentum is deposited in different rapidity region. The result\nsupports our asymmetry argument.\n", "  Auto-ignition process of stoichiometric mixture of methane-air is\ninvestigated using detailed chemical kinetics in a single-zone combustion\nchamber. Effect of initial temperature on start of combustion (SOC). The\nArrhenius expression for the specific reaction rate are calculated and\nauto-ignition was evaluated based on the species fractions and sensitivity\nanalysis. Our results suggest that the SOC is directly related to initial\ntemperature and the auto-ignition will not occur if the initial temperature low\nenough.\n", "  In this paper, a multilayer thermal infrared detector model has been achieved\nby finite element method (FEM). All contributions of the thermal conductance\nwere taken into account and calculated. In order to maximize the detector\nresponse, it is necessary to reduce the thermal conductance. Dynamic simulation\nin 3D was used to optimize this FEM model. The effect of the substrate\nproperties of the detector on its response has been studied. Moreover,\ndifferent boundary conditions have been analyzed. Optimal detector response\nvalues are obtained when the substrate thermal conductivity and its thickness\nare small. Moreover, a vacuum packing of the detector will be necessary to\nincrease the detector responsivity.\n", "  We present sensitive 870$\\mu$m continuum measurements from our ALMA\nprogrammes of 114 X-ray selected AGN in the CDF-S and COSMOS fields. We use\nthese observations in combination with data from Spitzer and Herschel to\nconstruct a sample of 86 X-ray selected AGN, 63 with ALMA constraints at\n$z=1.5-3.2$ with stellar mass $>2\\times10^{10}M_{\\odot}$. We constructed\nbroad-band spectral energy distributions in the infrared band (8 - 1000$\\mu$m)\nand constrain star-formation rates (SFRs) uncontaminated by the AGN. Using a\nhierarchical Bayesian method that takes into account the information from upper\nlimits, we fit SFR and specific SFR (sSFR) distributions. We explore these\ndistributions as a function of both X-ray luminosity and stellar mass. We\ncompare our measurements to two versions of the EAGLE hydrodynamical\nsimulations: the reference model with AGN feedback and the model without AGN.\nWe find good agreement between the observations and that predicted by the EAGLE\nreference model for the modes and widths of the sSFR distributions as a\nfunction of both X-ray luminosity and stellar mass; however, we found that the\nEAGLE model without AGN feedback predicts a significantly narrower width when\ncompared to the data. Overall, from the combination of the observations with\nthe model predictions, we conclude that (1) even with AGN feedback, we expect\nno strong relationship between the sSFR distribution parameters and\ninstantaneous AGN luminosity and (2) a signature of AGN feedback is a broad\ndistribution of sSFRs for all galaxies (not just those hosting an AGN) with\nstellar masses above $\\approx 10^{10}$M$_{\\odot}$.\n", "  Spin current has emerged as a leading candidate for manipulation of spins in\na nano-magnet. We here experimentally show another utility of spin current viz.\nit can be used for generation of phonons. Within the same experimental setup,\nwe also demonstrate the inverse effect of generation of spin current by\nphonons. To demonstrate them, we measured the scattering-matrix of a two-port\ndevice with interdigital transducers as one port and array of Ni/Pt lines as\nsecond port on piezoelectric substrate. The off-diagonal elements which\ncorrespond to transmission between the ports, were found to have 180 degree\nrelative phase shift. The transmission of electrical signal from port 2 to 1\ncorresponds to generation of phonons from spin-current, while transmission from\nport 1 to 2 corresponds to the inverse effect. These results could be useful\nfor designing spin-current based gyrators.\n", "  A fully renewable European power system comes with a variety of problems.\nMost of them are linked to the intermittent nature of renewable generation from\nthe sources of wind and photovoltaics. A possible solution to balance European\ngeneration and consumption are European hydro power with its seasonal and North\nAfrican Concentrated Solar Power with its daily storage characteristics. In\nthis paper, we investigate the interplay of hydro and CSP imports in a highly\nrenewable European power system. We use a large weather database and historical\nload data to model the interplay of renewable generation, consumption and\nimports for Europe. We introduce and compare different hydro usage strategies\nand show that hydro and CSP imports must serve different purposes to maximise\nbenefits for the total system. CSP imports should be used to cover daily\ndeficits, whereas hydro power can cover seasonal imbalances. If hydro is used\nin a \"Hydro First\" strategy, only around one quarter of North African Solar\nPower could be exported to Europe, whereas this number increases to around\n60\\%, if a cooperative hydro strategy is used.\n", "  In this thesis we study several problems in the context of AdS/CFT. The first\nis that of gravitational phase transitions between AdS and dS geometries in the\nGauss-Bonnet theory of gravity. Such transitions are mediated by thermalons and\ndo not require matter fields. The phenomenon is strongly expected to be generic\nin higher curvatures theories of gravity. The second problem is the generation\nof new Supergravity backgrounds and the study of their holographic duals. We\ngenerate new examples of supersymmetric flows from $AdS_5$ in the UV to $AdS_3$\nin the IR. The new solutions are found to be holographically related to long\nlinear quiver gauge theories. Finally we derive the Ward identities of 1+1 QFT\nusing AdS/CFT. This is achieved by holographic renormalization with special\nboundary terms. The resulting Ward identities are the same as in higher\ndimensions and they show the expected symmetry breaking for large N.\n", "  We study the Borel-Pad\\'e resummation of the asymptotic series for the string\nequation of the Lee-Yang edge singularity. Numerical methods are provided to\ncompute a high accuracy exact solution. We find the resummation matches the\nnumerical integration without need for further non-perturbative corrections.\n", "  We present a study of reentrant behavior in a composite formed by a Hight-T$\n_{c} $ superconductor, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$ _{7-\\delta}$ and Ammonium Terbium\nOxalate, Tb(H$_2$O)(C$ _2$O$_4$)$_2$ $\\cdot $NH$_4$. The composite has a\ntransition temperature about 92 K, and it presents a reentrant behaviour\nresulting of the coexistence between superconductivity and magnetism. According\nto this study the values and shape of the critical magnetic fields were\ndramatically reduced in a similar form as in other known reentrant\nsuperconductors.\n", "  The optical activity of achiral nonmagnetic uniaxial metasurfaces caused by\nthe extrinsic chirality arising from the mutual orientation of their anisotropy\naxis and the light plane of incidence is studied. The hyperbolic regime of the\nmetasurfaces manifests in the amplification of the polarization rotation in the\ntransmitted light and in the giant enhancement of the effect in the reflected\nlight. The transition to this regime is frequency dependent and has the\ntopological nature. The key role in the optical activity enhancement belongs to\nthe $\\sigma$-near-pole and hyperbolic $\\sigma$-near-zero regimes of the\nmetasurfaces. The hyperbolic metasurfaces based on graphene strips or metal\ndisks, and a black phosphorus thin film as a natural hyperbolic layer are\nconsidered. The efficiency of the predicted effects depends on the metasurfaces\nimplementation and the role of a substrate. By varying the metasurface\nparameters and choosing the physical realizations it is possible to design such\na hyperbolic metasurface polarizer for the THz, infrared, and visible working\nranges. Our findings may help to improve metasurface polarizers by using them\nin the hyperbolic regime.\n", "  To study the coupling system of space-time and Fermions, we need the explicit\nform of the energy-momentum tensor of spinors. The energy-momentum tensor is\nclosely related to the tetrad frames which cannot be uniquely determined by the\nmetric. This flexibility increases difficulties to derive the exact expression\nand easily leads to ambiguous results. In this paper, we give a detailed\nderivation for the energy-momentum tensor of Weyl and Dirac spinors. From the\nresults we find that, besides the usual kinetic energy momentum term, there are\nthree kinds of other additional terms. One is the nonlinear self-interactive\npotential, which acts like negative pressure. The other reflects the\ninteraction of momentum $p^\\mu$ with tetrad. The third is the spin-gravity\ncoupling term which is a higher order infinitesimal in weak field, but may be\nimportant in a neutron star. This term is also closely related with magnetic\nfield of a celestial body. These results are based on the decomposition of\nusual spin connection into geometrical part and dynamical part, which not only\nmakes calculation simpler, but also highlights their different physical\nmeanings. In addition, we get a new tensor $S^{\\mu\\nu}_{ab}$ in calculation of\ntetrad formalism, which plays an important role in the interaction of spinor\nwith gravity.\n"]}
