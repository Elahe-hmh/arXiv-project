The parent LaSiFe$_{12}$\nalloy has a shallow, double-well free energy function that is the basis of\nitinerant metamagnetism. On increasing the dopant concentration, the resulting\nlattice expansion causes an initial increase in magnetisation for all\ninterstitials that is only maintained at higher levels of doping in the case of\nhydrogen. Strong s-p band hybridisation occurs at high B,C and N\nconcentrations. We thus find that the electronic effects of hydrogen doping are\nmuch less pronounced than those of other interstitials, and result in the\ndouble-well structure of the free energy function being least sensitive to the\namount of hydrogen. This microscopic picture accounts for the vanishing first\norder nature of the transition by B,C, and N dopants as observed\nexperimentally. We use our calculated electronic density of states for\nLaSiFe$_{12}$ and the hydrogenated alloy to infer changes in magneto-elastic\ncoupling and in phonon entropy on heating through $T_C$ by calculating the\nfermionic entropy due to the itinerant electrons. Lastly, we predict the\nelectron thermopower in a spin-mixing, high temperature limit and compare our\nfindings to recent literature data.\n", "  A Linear Boltzmann Transport model within perturbative QCD is developed for\nthe study of parton propagation inside the quark-gluon plasma. Both leading\npartons and thermal recoil partons are tracked so that one can also study\njet-induced medium excitations. In this study, we implement the complete set of\nelastic parton scattering processes and investigate elastic parton energy loss,\ntransverse momentum broadening and their nontrivial energy and length\ndependence. We further investigate medium modifications of the jet shape and\nfragmentation functions of reconstructed jets. Contributions from thermal\nrecoil partons are found to have significant influences on jet shape,\nfragmentation functions and angular distribution of reconstructed jets.\n", "  A realistic grand unified model has never been constructed in the literature\ndue to three major difficulties: the seesaw mechanism without spoiling gauge\ncoupling unification, the doublet-triplet splitting and the proton decay\nsuppression. We propose a renormalizable supersymmetric SO(10) model with all\nthese difficulties solved naturally by imposing an extra discrete symmetry.\n", "  I consider two usages of the expression \"gauge theory\". On one, a gauge\ntheory is a theory with excess structure; on the other, a gauge theory is any\ntheory appropriately related to classical electromagnetism. I make precise one\nsense in which one formulation of electromagnetism, the paradigmatic gauge\ntheory on both usages, may be understood to have excess structure, and then\nargue that gauge theories on the second usage, including Yang-Mills theory and\ngeneral relativity, do not generally have excess structure in this sense.\n", "  The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) problem for vector bosons by the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau\n(DKP) formalism is analyzed. Depending on the values of the spin projection,\nthe relevant eigenvalue equation coming from the DKP formalism reveals an\nequivalence to the spin-$1/2$ AB problem. By using the self-adjoint extension\napproach, we examine the bound state scenario. The energy spectra are\nexplicitly computed as well as their dependencies on the magnetic flux\nparameter and also the conditions for the occurrence of bound states.\n", "  It was proposed that a dilute semimetal is unstable against the formation of\nan exciton insulator, however experimental confirmations have remained elusive.\nWe investigate the origin of bulk energy gap in inverted InAs/GaSb quantum\nwells (QWs) which naturally host spatially-separated electrons and holes, using\ncharge-neutral point density (no~po) in gated-device as a tuning parameter. We\nfind two distinct regimes of gap formation, that for I), no >> 5x1010/cm2, a\nsoft gap opens predominately by electron-hole hybridization; and for II),\napproaching the dilute limit no~ 5x1010/cm2, a hard gap opens leading to a true\nbulk insulator with quantized edge states. Moreover, the gap is dramatically\nreduced as the QWs are tuned to less dilute. We further examine the response of\ngaps to in-plane magnetic fields, and find that for I) the gap closes at B// >\n~ 10T, consistent with hybridization while for II) the gap opens continuously\nfor B// as high as 35T. Our analyses show that the hard gap in II) cannot be\nexplained by single-particle hybridization. The data are remarkably consistent\nwith the formation of a nontrivial exciton insulator in very dilute InAs/GaSb\nQWs.\n", "  The syntactic structure of sentences exhibits a striking regularity:\ndependencies tend to not cross when drawn above the sentence. We investigate\ntwo competing explanations. The traditional hypothesis is that this trend\narises from an independent principle of syntax that reduces crossings\npractically to zero. An alternative to this view is the hypothesis that\ncrossings are a side effect of dependency lengths, i.e. sentences with shorter\ndependency lengths should tend to have fewer crossings. We are able to reject\nthe traditional view in the majority of languages considered. The alternative\nhypothesis can lead to a more parsimonious theory of language.\n", "  Two principal definitions of a 3-velocity assigned to a test particle\nfollowing timelike trajectories in stationary spacetimes are introduced and\nanalyzed systematically. These definitions are based on the $1+3$ (threading)\nand $3+1$ (slicing) spacetime decomposition formalisms and defined relative to\ntwo different sets of observers. After showing that Synge's definition of\nspatial distance and 3-velocity are equivalent to those defined in the $1+3$\n(threading) formalism, we exemplify differences between the two definitions, by\ncalculating them for particles in circular orbits in axially symmetric\nstationary spacetimes. Illustrating its geometric nature, the relative linear\nvelocity between the corresponding observers is obtained in terms of the\nspacetime metric components. Circular particle orbits in the Kerr spacetime, as\nthe prototype and the most well known of stationary spacetimes, are examined\nwith respect to these definitions to highlight their observer-dependent nature.\nWe also examine the Kerr-NUT spacetime in which the NUT parameter contributing\nto the off-diagonal terms in the metric is mainly interpreted not as a rotation\nparameter but as a gravitomagnetic monopole charge. Finally, in a specific\nastrophysical setup which includes rotating black holes, it is shown how these\nlocal definitions are related to the velocity measurements made by distant\nobservers using spectral line shifts.\n", "  We derive X-ray mass, luminosity, and temperature profiles for 45 galaxy\nclusters to explore relationships between halo mass, AGN feedback, and central\ncooling time. We find that radio--mechanical feedback power (referred to here\nas \"AGN power\") in central cluster galaxies correlates with halo mass as\nP$_{\\rm mech}$ $\\propto$ M$^{1.55\\pm0.26}$, but only in halos with central\natmospheric cooling times shorter than 1 Gyr. The trend of AGN power with halo\nmass is consistent with the scaling expected from a self-regulating AGN\nfeedback loop, as well as with galaxy and central black hole co-evolution along\nthe $M_{\\rm BH} - \\sigma$ relation. AGN power in clusters with central\natmospheric cooling times longer than $\\sim 1$ Gyr typically lies two orders of\nmagnitude below those with shorter central cooling times. Galaxies centred in\nclusters with long central cooling times nevertheless experience ongoing and\noccasionally powerful AGN outbursts. We further investigate the impact of\nfeedback on cluster scaling relations. We find $L-T$, and $M-T$ relations in\nclusters with direct evidence of feedback which are steeper than self-similar,\nbut not atypical compared to previous studies of the full cluster population.\nWhile the gas mass rises, the stellar mass remains nearly constant with rising\ntotal mass, consistent with earlier studies. This trend is found regardless of\ncentral cooling time, implying tight regulation of star formation in central\ngalaxies as their halos grew, and long-term balance between AGN heating and\natmospheric cooling. Our scaling relations are presented in forms that can be\nincorporated easily into galaxy evolution models.\n", "  We consider the activated random walk model on general vertex-transitive\ngraphs. A central question in this model is whether the critical density\n$\\mu_c$ for sustained activity is strictly between 0 and 1. It was known that\n$\\mu_c>0$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\\geq 1$, and that $\\mu_c<1$ on $\\mathbb{Z}$ for\nsmall enough sleeping rate. We show that $\\mu_c\\to 0$ as $\\lambda\\to 0$ in all\nvertex-transitive transient graphs, implying that $\\mu_c<1$ for small enough\nsleeping rate. We also show that $\\mu_c<1$ for any sleeping rate in any\nvertex-transitive graph in which simple random walk has positive speed.\nFurthermore, we prove that $\\mu_c>0$ in any vertex-transitive amenable graph,\nand that $\\mu_c\\in(0,1)$ for any sleeping rate on regular trees.\n", "  Using experiments and simulations, we study the flow of soft particles\nthrough quasi-two-dimensional hoppers. The first experiment uses oil-in-water\nemulsion droplets in a thin sample chamber. Due to surfactants coating the\ndroplets, they easily slide past each other, approximating soft frictionless\ndisks. For these droplets, clogging at the hopper exit requires a narrow hopper\nopening only slightly larger than the droplet diameter. The second experiments\nuse soft hydrogel particles in a thin sample chamber, where we vary gravity by\nchanging the tilt angle of the chamber. For reduced gravity, clogging becomes\neasier, and can occur for larger hopper openings. Our simulations mimic the\nemulsion experiments and demonstrate that softness is a key factor controlling\nclogging: with stiffer particles or a weaker gravitational force, clogging is\neasier. The fractional amount a single particle is deformed under its own\nweight is a useful parameter measuring particle softness. Data from the\nsimulation and hydrogel experiments collapse when compared using this\nparameter. Our results suggest that prior studies using hard particles were in\na limit where the role of softness is negligible which causes clogging to occur\nwith significantly larger openings.\n", "  Turbulent flow separation induced by a protuberance on one of the walls of an\notherwise planar channel is investigated using Direct Numerical Simulations.\nDifferent bulge geometries and Reynolds numbers - with the highest friction\nReynolds number simulation reaching a peak of Re{\\tau} = 900 - are addressed to\nunderstand the effect of the wall curvature and of the Reynolds number on the\ndynamics of the recirculating bubble behind the bump. Most of the drag is due\nto the form contribution, whilst the friction contribution does not change\nappreciably with respect to an equivalent planar channel flow. The most bluff\ngeometry has a larger recirculation region, whilst the Reynolds number increase\nresults in a smaller recirculation bubble and a shear layer more attached to\nthe bump. The energy introduced by the pressure drop follows two routes: part\nof it is transferred towards the walls to be dissipated and part feeds the\nturbulent production hence the velocity fluctuations in the separating shear\nlayer. Spatial energy fluxes transfer the kinetic energy into the recirculation\nbubble and downstream near the wall where it is ultimately dissipated.\nConsistently, anisotropy concentrates at small scales near the walls\nirrespective of the value of the Reynolds number. In the bulk flow and in the\nrecirculation bubble, isotropy is restored at small scales and the isotropy\nrecovery rate is controlled by the Reynolds number. Anisotropy invariant maps\nare presented, showing the difficulty in developing suitable turbulence models\nto predict separated turbulent flow dynamics. Results shed light on the\nprocesses of production, transfer and dissipation of energy in this relatively\ncomplex turbulent flow where non-homogeneous effects overwhelm the classical\npicture of wall bounded turbulent flows which typically exploits streamwise\nhomogeneity.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the azimuthal magnetorotational instability (AMRI)\nalso works with radially increasing rotation rates contrary to the standard\nmagnetorotational instability for axial fields which requires negative shear.\nThe stability against nonaxisymmetric perturbations of a conducting\nTaylor-Couette flow with positive shear under the influence of a toroidal\nmagnetic field is considered if the background field between the cylinders is\ncurrent-free. For small magnetic Prandtl number Pm-->0 the curves of neutral\nstability converge in the Hartmann number/Reynolds number plane approximating\nthe stability curve obtained in the inductionless limit Pm=0. The numerical\nsolutions for Pm=0 indicate the existence of a lower limit of the shear rate.\nFor large Pm the curves scale with the magnetic Reynolds number of the outer\ncylinder but the flow is always stable for magnetic Prandtl number unity as is\ntypical for double-diffusive instabilities. We are particularly interested to\nknow the minimum Hartmann number for neutral stability. For models with resting\nor almost resting inner cylinder and with perfect-conducting cylinder material\nthe minimum Hartmann number occurs for a radius ratio of 0.9. The corresponding\ncritical Reynolds numbers are smaller than 10.000.\n", "  One of the main challenges in the field of quantum simulation and computation\nis to identify ways to certify the correct functioning of a device when a\nclassical efficient simulation is not available. Important cases are situations\nin which one cannot classically calculate local expectation values of state\npreparations efficiently. In this work, we develop weak-membership formulations\nof the certification of ground state preparations. We provide a non-interactive\nprotocol for certifying ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on\nsimple energy measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. This certification\nprotocol can be applied to classically intractable analog quantum simulations:\nFor example, using Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can encode universal\nquantum computation in such ground states. Moreover, our certification protocol\nis applicable to ground states encodings of IQP circuits demonstration of\nquantum supremacy. These can be certified efficiently when the error is\npolynomially bounded.\n", "  The minimum linear arrangement problem on a network consists of finding the\nminimum sum of edge lengths that can be achieved when the vertices are arranged\nlinearly. Although there are algorithms to solve this problem on trees in\npolynomial time, they have remained theoretical and have not been implemented\nin practical contexts to our knowledge. Here we use one of those algorithms to\ninvestigate the growth of this sum as a function of the size of the tree in\nuniformly random trees. We show that this sum is bounded above by its value in\na star tree. We also show that the mean edge length grows logarithmically in\noptimal linear arrangements, in stark contrast to the linear growth that is\nexpected on optimal arrangements of star trees or on random linear\narrangements.\n", "  In two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) the building blocks are given\nby chiral CFTs, i.e.~CFTs on the unit circle (compactified light-ray). They are\ngenerated by quantum fields depending on one light-ray coordinate only. There\nare two mathematical formulations of chiral CFT, the one based on vertex\noperator algebras (VOAs) and the one based on conformal nets. We describe some\nrecent results which, for first time, gives a general construction of conformal\nnets from (unitary) VOAs.\n", "  A review on current theories and observations of high-mass star formation is\ngiven. Particularly the influence of magnetic fields and feedback mechanisms,\nand of varying initial conditions on theories are discussed. The, in my biased\nview, most important observations to put strong constraints on models of\nhigh-mass star formation are pres ented, in particular bearing on the existence\nand properties of high-mass starless cores, the role of filaments in the mass\ntransport to high-mass cores, and the propertie s of disks around high-mass\nstars.\n", "  This paper is based on MacColl's [1] solution of the equation of motion for a\nlinear (harmonic) oscillator subject to the laws of special relativity in the\nrest frame of the center of attraction. MacColl's result can be extended to the\nquartic oscillator in this frame with one extremely simple adjustment of the\nlinearization map given in Anderson [2]. In fact, it can be extended to all the\nattractive oscillators in this frame.\n", "  The lacunar spinel GaV4S8 exhibits orbital ordering at 44 K and shows a\ncomplex magnetic phase diagram below 12.7 K, which includes ferromagnetic and\ncycloidal spin order. At low but finite external magnetic fields, N\\'eel-type\nskyrmions are formed in this material. Skyrmions are whirl-like spin vortices\nthat have received great theoretical interest because of their non-trivial spin\ntopology and that are also considered as basic entities for new data-storage\ntechnologies. Interestingly, we found that the orbitally ordered phase shows\nsizable ferroelectric polarization and that excess spin-driven polarizations\nappear in all magnetic phases, including the skyrmion-lattice phase. Hence,\nGaV4S8 shows simultaneous magnetic and polar order and belongs to the class of\nmultiferroics, materials that attracted enormous attention in recent years.\nHere, we summarize the existing experimental information on the magnetic,\nelectronic, and dielectric properties of GaV4S8. By performing detailed\nmagnetic susceptibility, resistivity, specific heat, and dielectric\nexperiments, we complement the low-temperature phase diagram. Specifically, we\nshow that the low-temperature and low-field ground state of GaV4S8 seems to\nhave a more complex spin configuration than purely collinear ferromagnetic spin\norder. In addition, at the structural Jahn-Teller transition the magnetic\nexchange interaction changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. We also\nprovide experimental evidence that the vanadium V4 clusters in GaV4S8 can be\nregarded as molecular units with spin 1/2. However, at high temperatures\ndeviations in the susceptibility show up, indicating that either the magnetic\nmoments of the vanadium atoms fluctuate independently or excited states of the\nV4 molecule become relevant.\n", "  How common is self-citation in scholarly publication, and does the practice\nvary by gender? Using novel methods and a data set of 1.5 million research\npapers in the scholarly database JSTOR published between 1779 and 2011, the\nauthors find that nearly 10 percent of references are self-citations by a\npaper's authors. The findings also show that between 1779 and 2011, men cited\ntheir own papers 56 percent more than did women. In the last two decades of\ndata, men self-cited 70 percent more than women. Women are also more than 10\npercentage points more likely than men to not cite their own previous work at\nall. While these patterns could result from differences in the number of papers\nthat men and women authors have published rather than gender-specific patterns\nof self-citation behavior, this gender gap in self-citation rates has remained\nstable over the last 50 years, despite increased representation of women in\nacademia. The authors break down self-citation patterns by academic field and\nnumber of authors and comment on potential mechanisms behind these\nobservations. These findings have important implications for scholarly\nvisibility and cumulative advantage in academic careers.\n", "  Under more consideration, it seems that bulk valley current mediated nonlocal\nresistance is inconsistent with Landau-Buttiker formalism. We believe\nLandau-Buttiker formalism is right and the declared bulk valley current\nmediated nonlocal resistance is questionable and the experimental signal should\nbe attributed to other origins.\n", "  Quantum networks of growing complexity play a key role as resources for\nquantum computation; the ability to identify the quality of their internal\ncorrelations will play a crucial role in addressing the buiding stage of such\nstates. We introduce a novel diagnostic scheme for multipartite networks of\nentangled particles, aimed at assessing the quality of the gates used for the\nengineering of their state. Using the information gathered from a set of\nsuitably chosen multiparticle Bell tests, we identify conditions bounding the\nquality of the entangled bonds among the elements of a register. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness, flexibility, and diagnostic power of the proposed\nmethodology by characterizing a quantum resource engineered combining\ntwo-photon hyperentanglement and photonic-chip technology. Our approach is\nfeasible for medium-sized networks due to the intrinsically modular nature of\ncluster states, and paves the way to section-by-section analysis of large\nphotonics resources.\n", "  The authors use an action research (AR) approach in a collegiate studio\nphysics class to investigate the power of partnerships via conferences as they\nrelate to issues of establishing a student/mentor rapport, empowering students\nto reduce inequity, and the successes and barriers to hearing students' voices.\nThe graduate teaching assistant (TA, Author 1) conducted one-on-one conferences\nwith 29 students, elicited student opinions about the progress of the course,\nand talked with faculty, TAs, and an undergraduate supplemental instructor for\nother sections of the course. At the end of the semester, the students reported\nincreased knowledge of the TA as a person and as an instructor, and vice versa.\nSixty-five percent of students reported no interest in changing circumstances\nto make it easier to talk about personal concerns with the TA. College students\nreluctantly voiced their opinions about the course, possibly due to the power\nstructure of the classroom. Other TAs in the department expressed mostly\ndisinterest in the project, while faculty members were interested in student\nlearning but skeptical of student empowerment. A case study of one student is\npresented, wherein his attendance improved in the course and he received\nadditional help outside class, both possibly as a result of the student/TA\nconferences. Students in this studio physics section were more likely to\ninteract directly with faculty or TAs during lectures, but less likely to do so\nduring lab sessions, than were students in a non-studio physics section.\n", "  We show that coherent inflation, namely quantum dynamics generated by\ninverted conservative potentials acting on the center of mass of a massive\nobject, is an enabling tool to prepare large spatial quantum superpositions in\na double-slit experiment. Combined with cryogenic, extreme high vacuum, and\nlow-vibration environments, we argue that it is experimentally feasible to\nexploit coherent inflation to prepare the center of mass of a micrometer-sized\nobject in a spatial quantum superposition comparable to its size. In such a\nhitherto unexplored parameter regime gravitationally-induced decoherence could\nbe unambiguously falsified. We present a protocol to implement coherent\ninflation in a double-slit experiment by letting a levitated microsphere\ntraverse a static potential landscape. Such a protocol could be experimentally\nimplemented with an all-magnetic scheme using superconducting microspheres.\n", "  In the recent years, there has been a drive towards the realization of\ntopological phases beyond conventional electronic materials, including phases\ndefined in more than three dimensions. We propose a way to realize 2nd Chern\nnumber topological phases with photonic crystals simply made up of defect\nresonators embedded within a regular lattice of resonators. In particular,\nthrough a novel quasiperiodic spatial modulations in the defect radii, a defect\nlattice possessing topologically nontrivial Chern bands with non-abelian berry\ncurvature living in four-dimensional synthetic space is proposed. This system\ncannot be factorized by a direct product of two 1st Chern number models,\ndistinguishing itself from the Hofstadter model. Such photonic systems can be\neasily experimentally realized with regular photonic crystals consisting of\ndielectric rods in air.\n", "  Passivity is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that demands a quantum\nsystem's energy cannot be lowered by any reversible, unitary process acting on\nthe system. In the limit of many such systems, passivity leads in turn to the\nconcept of complete passivity, thermal states, and the emergence of a\nthermodynamic temperature. In contrast, here we need only consider a single\nsystem and show that every passive state except the thermal state is unstable\nunder a weaker form of reversibility. More precisely, we show that given a\nsingle copy of any athermal quantum state we may extract a maximal amount of\nenergy from the state when we can use a machine that operates in a reversible\ncycle and whose state is left unchanged. This means that for individual systems\nthe only form of passivity that is stable under general reversible processes is\ncomplete passivity, and thus provides a single-shot and more physically\nmotivated identification of thermal states and the emergence of temperature.\nThe machine which extracts work from passive states exploits the fact that one\ncan find a subspace which acts as a virtual hot reservoir, and a subspace which\nacts as a virtual cold reservoir. We show that an optimal amount of work can be\nextracted, and that the machine operates at the Carnot efficiency between pairs\nof virtual reservoirs.\n", "  The time-domain technique for impedance spectroscopy consists of computing\nthe excitation voltage and current response Fourier images by fast or discrete\nFourier transformation and calculating their relation. Here we propose an\nalternative method for excitation voltage and current response processing for\nderiving a system impedance spectrum based on a fast and flexible adaptive\nfiltering method. We show the equivalence between the problem of adaptive\nfilter learning and deriving the system impedance spectrum. To be specific, we\nexpress the impedance via the adaptive filter weight coefficients. The\nnoise-canceling property of adaptive filtering is also justified. Using the RLC\ncircuit as a model system, we experimentally show that adaptive filtering\nyields correct admittance spectra and elements ratings in the high-noise\nconditions when the Fourier-transform technique fails. Providing the additional\nsensitivity of impedance spectroscopy, adaptive filtering can be applied to\notherwise impossible-to-interpret time-domain impedance data. The advantages of\nadaptive filtering are justified with practical living-cell impedance\nmeasurements.\n", "  The COBRA collaboration searches for neutrinoless double beta-decay\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay) using CdZnTe semiconductor detectors with a\ncoplanar-grid readout and a surrounding guard-ring structure. The operation of\nthe COBRA demonstrator at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS)\nindicates that alpha-induced lateral surface events are the dominant source of\nbackground events. By instrumenting the guard-ring electrode it is possible to\nsuppress this type of background. In laboratory measurements this method\nachieved a suppression factor of alpha-induced lateral surface events of\n$5300^{+2660}_{-1380}$, while retaining $85.3\\pm0.1\\%$ of gamma events\noccurring in the entire detector volume. This suppression is superior to the\npulse-shape analysis methods used so far in COBRA by three orders of magnitude.\n", "  Protein synthesis rates are determined, at the translational level, by\nproperties of the transcript's sequence. The efficiency of an mRNA can be tuned\nby varying the ribosome binding sites controlling the recruitment of the\nribosomes, or the codon usage establishing the speed of protein elongation. In\nthis work we propose transcript length as a further key determinant of\ntranslation efficiency. Based on a physical model that considers the kinetics\nof ribosomes advancing on the mRNA and diffusing in its surrounding, as well as\nmRNA circularisation and ribosome drop-off, we explain how the transcript\nlength may play a central role in establishing ribosome recruitment and the\noverall translation rate of an mRNA. According to our results, the proximity of\nthe 3' end to the ribosomal recruitment site of the mRNA could induce a\nfeedback in the translation process that would favour the recycling of\nribosomes. We also demonstrate how this process may be involved in shaping the\nexperimental ribosome density-gene length dependence. Finally, we argue that\ncells could exploit this mechanism to adjust and balance the usage of its\nribosomal resources.\n", "  We study the fission dynamics of 240Pu within an implementation of the\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) extended to superfluid systems and real-time\ndynamics. We demonstrate the critical role played by the pairing correlations.\nThe evolution is found to be much slower than previously expected in this fully\nnon-adiabatic treatment of nuclear dynamics, where there are no symmetry\nrestrictions and all collective degrees of freedom (CDOF) are allowed to\nparticipate in the dynamics.\n", "  We study the electronic transport across an electrostatically-gated lateral\njunction in a HgTe quantum well, a canonical 2D topological insulator, with and\nwithout applied magnetic field. We control carrier density inside and outside a\njunction region independently and hence tune the number and nature of 1D edge\nmodes propagating in each of those regions. Outside the 2D gap, magnetic field\ndrives the system to the quantum Hall regime, and chiral states propagate at\nthe edge. In this regime, we observe fractional plateaus which reflect the\nequilibration between 1D chiral modes across the junction. As carrier density\napproaches zero in the central region and at moderate fields, we observe\noscillations in resistance that we attribute to Fabry-Perot interference in the\nhelical states, enabled by the broken time reversal symmetry. At higher fields,\nthose oscillations disappear, in agreement with the expected absence of helical\nstates when band inversion is lifted.\n", "  We consider fourth order ordinary differential operator with compactly\nsupported coefficients on the line. We determine asymptotics of the number of\nresonances in complex discs at large radius. We consider resonances of an\nEuler-Bernoulli operator on the real line with the positive coefficients which\nare constants outside some finite interval. We show that the Euler-Bernoulli\noperator has no eigenvalues and resonances iff the positive coefficients are\nconstants on the whole axis.\n", "  The syntactic structure of a sentence can be modelled as a tree, where\nvertices correspond to words and edges indicate syntactic dependencies. It has\nbeen claimed recurrently that the number of edge crossings in real sentences is\nsmall. However, a baseline or null hypothesis has been lacking. Here we\nquantify the amount of crossings of real sentences and compare it to the\npredictions of a series of baselines. We conclude that crossings are really\nscarce in real sentences. Their scarcity is unexpected by the hubiness of the\ntrees. Indeed, real sentences are close to linear trees, where the potential\nnumber of crossings is maximized.\n", "  Edge states are studied for the two-dimensional Dirac equation in a circular\ngeometry. The properties of the two-component electromagnetic field are\ndiscussed in terms of the three-component polarization field, which can form a\nvortex structure near the Dirac node with a vorticity changing with the sign of\nthe Dirac mass. The Berry curvature of the polarization field is related to the\nBerry curvature of the Dirac spinor state. This quantity is sensitive to a\nchange of boundary conditions. In particular, it vanishes for a geometry with a\nsingle boundary but not for a geometry with two boundaries. This effect is\nrobust against the creation of a step-like edge inside the sample.\n", "  Coupled Linear Boltzmann Transport and hydrodynamics (CoLBT-hydro) is\ndeveloped for co-current and event-by-event simulations of jet transport and\njet-induced medium excitation (j.i.m.e.) in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.\nThis is made possible by a GPU parallelized (3+1)D hydrodynamics that has a\nsource term from the energy-momentum deposition by propagating jet shower\npartons and provides real time update of the bulk medium evolution for\nsubsequent jet transport. Hadron spectra in $\\gamma$-jet events of A+A\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC are calculated for the first time that include\nhadrons from both the modified jet and j.i.m.e.. CoLBT-hydro describes well\nexperimental data at RHIC on the suppression of leading hadrons due to parton\nenergy loss. It also predicts the enhancement of soft hadrons from j.i.m.e. The\nonset of soft hadron enhancement occurs at a constant transverse momentum due\nto the thermal nature of soft hadrons from j.i.m.e. which also have a\nsignificantly broadened azimuthal distribution relative to the jet direction.\nSoft hadrons in the $\\gamma$ direction are, on the other hand, depleted due to\na diffusion wake behind the jet.\n", "  The seesaw mechanism, which is responsible for the description of neutrino\nmasses and mixing, requires a scale lower than the unification scale. We\npropose a new model with spinor superfields playing important roles to generate\nthis seesaw scale, with special attention paid on the Goldstone mode of the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking.\n", "  We investigate the impurity scattering induced quasiparticle interference in\nthe ($\\pi, 0$) spin-density wave phase of the iron pnictides. We use a five\norbital tight binding model and our mean field theory in the clean limit\ncaptures key features of the Fermi surface observed in angle-resolved\nphotoemission. We use a t-matrix formalism to incorporate the effect of doping\ninduced impurities on this state. The impurities lead to a spatial modulation\nof the local density of states about the impurity site, with a periodicity of\n$\\sim 8a_{{\\rm Fe}-{\\rm Fe}}$ along the antiferromagnetic direction. The\nassociated momentum space quasiparticle interference pattern is anisotropic,\nwith major peaks located at $\\sim (\\pm \\pi/4,0)$, consistent with spectroscopic\nimaging scanning tunneling microscopy. We trace the origin of this pattern to\nan elliptical contour of constant energy around momentum (0,0), with major axis\noriented along the (0,1) direction, in the mean field electronic structure.\n", "  This paper outlines a methodological approach for designing adaptive agents\ndriving themselves near points of criticality. Using a synthetic approach we\nconstruct a conceptual model that, instead of specifying mechanistic\nrequirements to generate criticality, exploits the maintenance of an\norganizational structure capable of reproducing critical behavior. Our approach\nexploits the well-known principle of universality, which classifies critical\nphenomena inside a few universality classes of systems independently of their\nspecific mechanisms or topologies. In particular, we implement an artificial\nembodied agent controlled by a neural network maintaining a correlation\nstructure randomly sampled from a lattice Ising model at a critical point. We\nevaluate the agent in two classical reinforcement learning scenarios: the\nMountain Car benchmark and the Acrobot double pendulum, finding that in both\ncases the neural controller reaches a point of criticality, which coincides\nwith a transition point between two regimes of the agent's behaviour,\nmaximizing the mutual information between neurons and sensorimotor patterns.\nFinally, we discuss the possible applications of this synthetic approach to the\ncomprehension of deeper principles connected to the pervasive presence of\ncriticality in biological and cognitive systems.\n", "  Atoms interact with each other through the electromagnetic field, creating\ncollective states that can radiate faster or slower than a single atom, i.e.\nsuper- and sub-radiance. The generation and control of such states by\nengineering the dipolar interactions between atoms can enable new tools for\natomic-based technologies. Atom-atom interactions in free space are limited in\nrange, since the amplitude of the radiated field decreases inversely with\ndistance. When the field is confined to one dimension it enables infinite-range\ninteractions. This has been observed for atoms in an optical cavity, but\nremains to be proven in one-dimensional waveguides, where the extent of the\ninteractions is not limited by the cavity size. Here we present the first\nreport of infinite-range interactions between macroscopically separated atomic\ndipoles mediated by an optical waveguide. This is evidenced by the collective\nradiative decay of a single photon distributed between distant atoms. We use\ncold $^{87}$Rb atoms in the vicinity of a single-mode optical nanofiber (ONF)\nthat coherently exchange evanescently coupled photons through the ONF mode. In\nparticular, we observe super-radiance of a few atoms separated by hundreds of\nresonant wavelengths. This effect is not possible for atoms separated by more\nthan a wavelength interacting through free space. The same platform allows us\nto measure sub-radiance, a rarely observed effect, presenting a novel tool for\nquantum optics. This result constitutes a proof-of-principle for collective\nbehavior of macroscopically delocalized atomic states, a crucial element for\nnew proposals in quantum information and many-body physics. Given the\napplication of one-dimensional waveguides in photonic-based quantum\ntechnologies, we envision infinite-range interactions as the natural next step\ntowards interconnecting quantum systems on scales suitable for practical\napplications.\n", "  Clustered quantum materials provide a new platform for the experimental study\nof many-body entanglement. Here we address a simple model of a single-molecule\nnano-magnet featuring N interacting spins in a transverse field. The field can\ninduce an entanglement transition (ET). We calculate the magnetisation,\nlow-energy gap and neutron-scattering cross-section and find that the ET has\ndistinct signatures, detectable at temperatures as high as 5% of the\ninteraction strength. The signatures are stronger for smaller clusters.\n", "  After decades of progress and effort, obtaining a phase diagram for a\nstrongly-correlated topological system still remains a challenge. Although in\nprinciple one could turn to Wilson loops and long-range entanglement,\nevaluating these non-local observables at many points in phase space can be\nprohibitively costly. With growing excitement over topological quantum\ncomputation comes the need for an efficient approach for obtaining topological\nphase diagrams. Here we turn to machine learning using quantum loop topography\n(QLT), a notion we have recently introduced. Specifically, we propose a\nconstruction of QLT that is sensitive to quasi-particle statistics. We then use\nmutual statistics between the spinons and visons to detect a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$\nquantum spin liquid in a multi-parameter phase space. We successfully obtain\nthe quantum phase boundary between the topological and trivial phases using a\nsimple feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, we demonstrate advantages of\nour approach for the evaluation of phase diagrams relating to speed and\nstorage. Such statistics-based machine learning of topological phases opens new\nefficient routes to studying topological phase diagrams in strongly correlated\nsystems.\n", "  Using two-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations, we explore the nonlinear\n\"interruption\" of standing and traveling shear-Alfv\\'en waves in collisionless\nplasmas. Interruption involves a self-generated pressure anisotropy removing\nthe restoring force of a linearly polarized Alfv\\'enic perturbation, and occurs\nfor wave amplitudes $\\delta B_{\\perp}/B_{0}\\gtrsim \\beta^{\\,-1/2}$ (where\n$\\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure). We use highly elongated\ndomains to obtain maximal scale separation between the wave and the ion\ngyroscale. For standing waves above the amplitude limit, we find that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field of the wave decays rapidly. The dynamics are\nstrongly affected by the excitation of oblique firehose modes, which transition\ninto long-lived parallel fluctuations at the ion gyroscale and cause\nsignificant particle scattering. Traveling waves are damped more slowly, but\nare also influenced by small-scale parallel fluctuations created by the decay\nof firehose modes. Our results demonstrate that collisionless plasmas cannot\nsupport linearly polarized Alfv\\'en waves above $\\delta B_{\\perp}/B_{0}\\sim\n\\beta^{\\,-1/2}$. They also provide a vivid illustration of two key aspects of\nlow-collisionality plasma dynamics: (i) the importance of velocity-space\ninstabilities in regulating plasma dynamics at high $\\beta$, and (ii) how\nnonlinear collisionless processes can transfer mechanical energy directly from\nthe largest scales into thermal energy and microscale fluctuations, without the\nneed for a scale-by-scale turbulent cascade.\n", "  AGN feedback is regarded as an important non-gravitational process in galaxy\nclusters, providing useful constraints on large-scale structure formation. It\nmodifies the structure and energetics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and\nhence its understanding is crucially needed in order to use clusters as high\nprecision cosmological probes. In this context, particularly keeping in mind\nthe upcoming high quality radio data expected from radio surveys like SKA with\nits higher sensitivity, high spatial and spectral resolutions, we review our\ncurrent understanding of AGN feedback, its cosmological implications and the\nimpact that SKA can have in revolutionizing our understanding of AGN feedback\nin large-scale structures. Recent developments regarding the AGN outbursts and\nits possible contribution to excess entropy in the hot atmospheres of groups\nand clusters, its correlation with the feedback energy in ICM, quenching of\ncooling flows and the possible connection between cool core clusters and radio\nmini-halos, are discussed. We describe current major issues regarding modeling\nof AGN feedback and its impact on the surrounding medium. With regard to the\nfuture of AGN feedback studies, we examine the possible breakthroughs that can\nbe expected from SKA observations. In the context of cluster cosmology, for\nexample, we point out the importance of SKA observations for cluster mass\ncalibration by noting that most of $z>1$ clusters discovered by eROSITA X-ray\nmission can be expected to be followed up through a 1000 hour SKA-1 mid\nprogramme. Moreover, approximately $1000$ radio mini halos and $\\sim 2500$\nradio halos at $z<0.6$ can be potentially detected by SKA1 and SKA2 and used as\ntracers of galaxy clusters and determination of cluster selection function.\n", "  In this paper by using the path integral formulation of the background field\nmethod of QCD in the presence of SU(3) pure gauge background field we\nsimultaneously prove the renormalization of ultra violet (UV) divergences and\nthe factorization of infrared (IR) and collinear divergences in QCD at all\norders in coupling constant. We prove that although perturbative QCD is\nrenormalizable but due to confinement in QCD it is not necessary to renormalize\nQCD to study hadrons production at high energy colliders. This is consistent\nwith the fact that the partons are not directly experimentally observed but the\nhadrons are directly experimentally observed.\n", "  An exotic phase, the bond order wave, characterized by the spontaneous\ndimerization of the hopping, has been predicted to exist sandwiched between the\nband and Mott insulators in systems described by the ionic Hubbard model.\nDespite growing theoretical evidences, this phase still evades experimental\ndetection. Given the recent realization of the ionic Hubbard model in ultracold\natomic gases, we propose here to detect the bond order wave using superlattice\nmodulation spectroscopy. We demonstrate, with the help of time-dependent\ndensity-matrix renormalization group and bosonization, that this spectroscopic\napproach reveals characteristics of both the Ising and Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransitions signaling the presence of the bond order wave phase. This scheme\nalso provides insights into the excitation spectra of both the band and Mott\ninsulators.\n", "  We study a tight-binding model of interacting Majorana (Hermitian) modes on a\nsquare lattice. The model may have an experimental realization in a\nsuperconducting-film--topological-insulator heterostructure in a magnetic\nfield. We find a rich phase diagram, as a function of interaction strength,\nincluding a superfluid phase with spontaneous breaking of an emergent $U(1)$\nsymmetry, separated by a supersymmetric transition from a gapless normal phase.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of the MSSM extended by a single R-parity\nviolating coupling at the unification scale. For all R-parity violating\ncouplings, we discuss the evolution of the particle spectra through the\nrenormalization group equations and the nature of the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP) within the CMSSM, as an example of a specific complete\nsupersymmetric model. We use the nature of the LSP to classify the possible\nsignatures. For each possible scenario we present in detail the current LHC\nbounds on the supersymmetric particle masses, typically obtained using\nsimplified models. From this we determine the present coverage of R-parity\nviolating models at the LHC. We find several gaps, in particular for a\nstau-LSP, which is easily obtained in R-parity violating models. Using the\nprogram CheckMATE we recast existing LHC searches to set limits on the\nparameters of all R-parity violating CMSSMs. We find that virtually all of them\nare either more strongly constrained or similarly constrained in comparison to\nthe R-parity conserving CMSSM, including the $\\bar U\\bar D\\bar D$ models. For\neach R-parity violating CMSSM we then give the explicit lower mass bounds on\nall relevant supersymmetric particles.\n", "  The three-body general problem is formulated as a problem of geodesic\ntrajectories flows on the Riemannian manifold. It is proved that a curved space\nwith local coordinate system allows to detect new hidden symmetries of the\ninternal motion of a dynamical system and reduce the three-body problem to the\nsystem of 6\\emph{th} order. It is shown that the equivalence of the initial\nNewtonian three-body problem and the developed representation provides\ncoordinate transformations in combination with the underdetermined system of\nalgebraic equations. The latter makes a system of geodesic equations relative\nto the evolution parameter, i.e., to the arc length of the geodesic curve,\nirreversible. Equations of deviation of geodesic trajectories characterizing\nthe behavior of the dynamical system as a function of the initial parameters of\nthe problem are obtained. To describe the motion of a dynamical system\ninfluenced by the external regular and stochastic forces, a system of\nstochastic equations (SDE) is obtained. Using the system of SDE, a partial\ndifferential equation of the second order for the joint probability\ndistribution of the momentum and coordinate of dynamical system in the phase\nspace is obtained. A criterion for estimating the degree of deviation of\nprobabilistic current tubes of geodesic trajectories in the phase and\nconfiguration spaces is formulated. The mathematical expectation of the\ntransition probability between two asymptotic subspaces is determined taking\ninto account the multichannel character of the scattering.\n", "  We study the quantum quench problem for a class of bosonic conformal\ninterfaces by computing the Loschmidt echo and the bipartite fidelity. The\nquench can be viewed as a sudden change of boundary conditions parameterized by\n$\\theta$ when connecting two one-dimensional critical systems. They are\nclassified by $S(\\theta)$ matrices associated with the current scattering\nprocesses on the interface. The resulting Loschmidt echo of the quench has long\ntime algebraic decay $t^{-\\alpha}$, whose exponent also appears in the finite\nsize bipartite fidelity as $L^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$. We perform analytic and\nnumerical calculations of the exponent $\\alpha$, and find that it has a\nquadratic dependence on the change of $\\theta$ if the prior and post quench\nboundary conditions are of the same type of $S$, while remaining $\\frac{1}{4}$\notherwise. Possible physical realizations of these interfaces include, for\ninstance, connecting different quantum wires (Luttinger liquids), quench of the\ntopological phase edge states, etc. and the exponent can be detected in a X-ray\nedge singularity type experiment.\n", "  Transverse momentum spectra of charged pions, kaons, and protons are measured\nin proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the\nLHC. The particles, identified via their energy loss in the silicon tracker,\nare measured in the transverse momentum range of pt ~ 0.1-1.7 GeV and\nrapidities abs(y) < 1. The pt spectra and integrated yields are compared to\nprevious results at smaller sqrt(s) and to predictions of Monte Carlo event\ngenerators. The average pt increases with particle mass and charged particle\nmultiplicity of the event. Comparisons with previous CMS results at sqrt(s) =\n0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV show that the average pt and the ratios of hadron yields\nfeature very similar dependences on the particle multiplicity in the event,\nindependently of the center-of-mass energy of the pp collision.\n", "  We study the most general renormalizable couplings containing Higgs $H(10)$,\n$D(120)$, $\\overline{\\Delta}(\\overline{126})+ \\Delta(126)$, $A(45)$, $E(54)$\nand $\\Phi(210)$ in the supersymmetric SO(10) models. The Clebsch-Gordan\nCoefficients are calculated using the maximal subgroup $SU(5)\\times U(1)_X$.\n", "  A highly pure and stable single-photon source is prepared that comprises a\nwell-designed pillar array in which each pillar contains only a few InAs\nquantum dots. A nano-pillar in this array is in direct contact with a fiber end\nsurface and cooled in a liquid-He bath. Auto-correlation measurement shows that\nthis source provides an average $g^{(2)}(0)$ value of 0.0174 in the measured\nexcitation-power range. This photon source and fiber coupling are quite rigid\nagainst external disturbances such as cooling-heating cycles and vibration,\nwith long-term stability.\n", "  Mesons with masses below their lowest OZI-allowed strong-decay thresholds\nhave very small widths. Thus, it is usually believed that they can be safely\ntreated as pure quark-antiquark bound states in spectroscopy models. However,\nunitarised and coupled-channel models from decades ago already indicated that\nthis may not be the case, owing to significant virtual meson-loop\ncontributions. Recent unquenched lattice calculations that include two-meson\ninterpolators besides the usual $q\\bar{q}$ ones confirm the latter conclusion,\nin particular for the enigmatic narrow $D_{s0}^\\star(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$,\nand $X(3872)$ states. Here, we briefly review some predictions of some old and\nnew quark models that go beyond the static description of mesons, also in\ncomparison with up-to-date lattice results.\n", "  The existence of two kinematically and chemically distinct stellar\nsubpopulations in the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf galaxies offers the opportunity\nto constrain the density profile of their matter haloes by measuring the mass\ncontained within the well-separated half-light radii of the two metallicity\nsubpopulations. Walker and Penarrubia have used this approach to argue that\ndata for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their\ninner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high\nstatistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the\nvalidity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE (A Project Of\nSimulating The Local Environment) Lambda cold dark matter cosmological\nhydrodynamics simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all\nhave NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct\nmetallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a\nmethod analogous to that of Walker and Penarrubia to a sample of 53 simulated\ndwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant\ndetection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although\nmultiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of\nthe assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based.\nThe stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly\nelongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different\nasphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the\ndensity profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is\nviewed.\n", "  We study gauge dependence of gravitational waves produced from a first-order\nphase transition in classical scale-invariant $U(1)'$ models. Accidental gauge\nindependence of the one-loop effective potential in this class of models is\nspoiled by including thermal resummation. The gauge artifact in the resummed\neffective potential propagates to the gravitational wave spectrum and results\nin one order of magnitude uncertainties in the prediction under a specific\ngauge choice.\n", "  Quantum networks are natural scenarios for the communication of information\namong distributed parties, and the arena of promising schemes for distributed\nquantum computation. Measurement-based quantum computing is a prominent example\nof how quantum networking, embodied by the generation of a special class of\nmultipartite states called cluster states, can be used to achieve a powerful\nparadigm for quantum information processing. Here we analyze randomly generated\ncluster states in order to address the emergence of multipartite correlations\nas a function of the density of edges in a given underlying graph. We find that\nthe most widespread multipartite entanglement does not correspond to the\nhighest amount of edges in the cluster. We extend the analysis to higher\ndimensions, finding similar results, which suggest the establishment of small\nworld structures in the entanglement sharing of randomised cluster states,\nwhich can be exploited in engineering more efficient quantum information\ncarriers.\n", "  We investigate the effect of a global degeneracy in the distribution of\nentanglement spectrum in conformal field theories in one spatial dimension. We\nrelate the recently found universal expression for the entanglement hamiltonian\nto the distribution of the entanglement spectrum. The main tool to establish\nthis connection is the Cardy formula. It turns out that the Affleck-Ludwig\nnon-integer degeneracy, appearing because of the boundary conditions induced at\nthe entangling surface, can be directly read from the entanglement spectrum\ndistribution. We also clarify the effect of the non-integer degeneracy on the\nspectrum of the partial transpose, which is the central object for quantifying\nthe entanglement in mixed states. We show that the exact knowledge of the\nentanglement spectrum in some integrable spin-chains provides strong analytical\nevidences corroborating our results.\n", "  We propose a method for engineering spin dynamics in ensembles of\ninteger-spin atoms confined within a high-finesse optical cavity. Our proposal\nuses cavity-assisted Raman transitions to engineer a Dicke model for\ninteger-spin atoms, which, in a dispersive limit, reduces to effective\natom-atom interactions within the ensemble. This scheme offers a promising and\nflexible new avenue for the exploration of a wide range of spinor many-body\nphysics. As an example of this, we present results showing that this method can\nbe used to generate spin-nematic squeezing in an ensemble of spin-1 atoms. With\nrealistic parameters the scheme should enable substantial squeezing on time\nscales much shorter than current experiments with spin-1 Bose-Einstein\ncondensates.\n", "  There is mounting evidence suggesting that relativistic hydrodynamics becomes\nrelevant for the physics of quark-gluon plasma as the result of nonhydrodynamic\nmodes decaying to an attractor apparent even when the system is far from local\nequilibrium. Here we determine this attractor for Bjorken flow in N=4\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using Borel summation of the gradient\nexpansion of the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor. By comparing\nthe result to numerical simulations of the flow based on the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence we show that it provides an accurate and unambiguous\napproximation of the hydrodynamic attractor in this system. This development\nhas important implications for the formulation of effective theories of\nhydrodynamics.\n", "  We calculate the solar neutrino and antineutrino flux in the keV energy\nrange. The dominant thermal source processes are photoproduction ($\\gamma e\\to\ne \\nu\\bar\\nu$), bremsstrahlung ($e+Ze\\to Ze+e+\\nu\\bar\\nu$), plasmon decay\n($\\gamma\\to\\nu\\bar\\nu$), and $\\nu\\bar\\nu$ emission in free-bound and\nbound-bound transitions of partially ionized elements heavier than hydrogen and\nhelium. These latter processes dominate in the energy range of a few keV and\nthus carry information about the solar metallicity. To calculate their rate we\nuse libraries of monochromatic photon radiative opacities in analogy to a\nprevious calculation of solar axion emission. Our overall flux spectrum and\nmany details differ significantly from previous works. While this low-energy\nflux is not measurable with present-day technology, it could become a\nsignificant background for future direct searches for keV-mass sterile neutrino\ndark matter.\n", "  A search is presented for particles that decay producing a large jet\nmultiplicity and invisible particles. The event selection applies a veto on the\npresence of isolated electrons or muons and additional requirements on the\nnumber of b-tagged jets and the scalar sum of masses of large-radius jets.\nHaving explored the full ATLAS 2015-2016 dataset of LHC proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13~\\mathrm{TeV}$, which corresponds to 36.1 fb$^{-1}$\nof integrated luminosity, no evidence is found for physics beyond the Standard\nModel. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified models inspired\nby R-parity-conserving and R-parity-violating supersymmetry, where gluinos are\npair-produced. More generic models within the phenomenological minimal\nsupersymmetric Standard Model are also considered.\n", "  We introduce new Langevin-type equations describing the rotational and\ntranslational motion of rigid bodies interacting through conservative and\nnon-conservative forces, and hydrodynamic coupling. In the absence of\nnon-conservative forces the Langevin-type equations sample from the canonical\nensemble. The rotational degrees of freedom are described using quaternions,\nthe lengths of which are exactly preserved by the stochastic dynamics. For the\nproposed Langevin-type equations, we construct a weak 2nd order geometric\nintegrator which preserves the main geometric features of the continuous\ndynamics. The integrator uses Verlet-type splitting for the deterministic part\nof Langevin equations appropriately combined with an exactly integrated\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate\nboth the new Langevin model and the numerical method for it, as well as to\ndemonstrate how inertia and the coupling of rotational and translational motion\ncan introduce qualitatively distinct behaviours.\n", "  We use confocal microscopy to study the aging of a bidisperse colloidal glass\nnear rough and smooth boundaries. Near smooth boundaries, the particles form\nlayers, and particle motion is dramatically slower near the boundary as\ncompared to the bulk. Near rough boundaries, the layers nearly vanish, and\nparticle motion is nearly identical to that of the bulk. The gradient in\ndynamics near the boundaries is demonstrated to be a function of the gradient\nin structure for both types of boundaries.Our observations show that\nwall-induced layer structures strongly influence aging.\n", "  Three complementary methods have been implemented in the code Denovo that\naccelerate neutral particle transport calculations with methods that use\nleadership-class computers fully and effectively: a multigroup block (MG)\nKrylov solver, a Rayleigh Quotient Iteration (RQI) eigenvalue solver, and a\nmultigrid in energy (MGE) preconditioner. The MG Krylov solver converges more\nquickly than Gauss Seidel and enables energy decomposition such that Denovo can\nscale to hundreds of thousands of cores. RQI should converge in fewer\niterations than power iteration (PI) for large and challenging problems. RQI\ncreates shifted systems that would not be tractable without the MG Krylov\nsolver. It also creates ill-conditioned matrices. The MGE preconditioner\nreduces iteration count significantly when used with RQI and takes advantage of\nthe new energy decomposition such that it can scale efficiently. Each\nindividual method has been described before, but this is the first time they\nhave been demonstrated to work together effectively.\n  The combination of solvers enables the RQI eigenvalue solver to work better\nthan the other available solvers for large reactors problems on leadership\nclass machines. Using these methods together, RQI converged in fewer iterations\nand in less time than PI for a full pressurized water reactor core. These\nsolvers also performed better than an Arnoldi eigenvalue solver for a reactor\nbenchmark problem when energy decomposition is needed. The MG Krylov, MGE\npreconditioner, and RQI solver combination also scales well in energy. This\nsolver set is a strong choice for very large and challenging problems.\n", "  Current heavy-ion collision experiments might lead to the discovery of a\nfirst-order chiral symmetry breaking phase-transition line, ending in a\nsecond-order critical point. Nevertheless, the extraction of information about\nthe equilibrium thermodynamic properties of baryonic matter from the highly\ndynamic, small, noisy and fluctuating environment formed in such collisions is\nan extremely challenging task. We address some of the limitations present in\nthe experimental search for the QCD critical point.\n", "  Measurements of $CP$ observables in $B^\\pm \\rightarrow D^{(*)} K^\\pm$ and\n$B^\\pm \\rightarrow D^{(*)} \\pi^\\pm$ decays are presented, where $D^{(*)}$\nindicates a neutral $D$ or $D^*$ meson that is an admixture of $D^{(*)0}$ and\n$\\bar{D}^{(*)0}$ states. Decays of the $D^*$ meson to the $D\\pi^0$ and\n$D\\gamma$ final states are partially reconstructed without inclusion of the\nneutral pion or photon, resulting in distinctive shapes in the $B$ candidate\ninvariant mass distribution. Decays of the $D$ meson are fully reconstructed in\nthe $K^\\pm \\pi^\\mp$, $K^+ K^-$ and $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ final states. The analysis\nuses a sample of charged $B$ mesons produced in $pp$ collisions collected by\nthe LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.0, 1.0 and\n2.0 fb$^{-1}$ taken at centre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8 and 13 TeV,\nrespectively. The study of $B^{\\pm} \\to D^{*} K^{\\pm}$ and $B^{\\pm} \\to D^{*}\n\\pi^{\\pm}$ decays using a partial reconstruction method is the first of its\nkind, while the measurement of $B^{\\pm} \\to D K^{\\pm}$ and $B^{\\pm} \\to D\n\\pi^{\\pm}$ decays is an update of previous LHCb measurements. The $B^{\\pm} \\to\nD K^{\\pm}$ results are the most precise to date.\n", "  Taming the Terahertz waves (100 GHz-10 THz) is considered the next frontier\nin wireless communications. While components for the ultra-high bandwidth\nTerahertz wireless communications were in rapid development over the past\nseveral years, however, their commercial availability is still lacking.\nNevertheless, as we demonstrate in this paper, due to recent advances in the\nmicrowave and infrared photonics hardware, it is now possible to assemble high\nperformance hybrid THz communication systems for real-life applications. As an\nexample, in this work, we present design and performance evaluation of the\nphotonics-based Terahertz wireless communication system for the transmission of\nuncompressed 4K video feed that is built using all commercially available\nsystem components. In particular, two independent tunable lasers operating in\nthe infrared C-band are used as a source for generating the Terahertz carrier\nwave using frequency difference generation in a photomixer. One of the IR laser\nbeams carries the data which is intensity modulated using the LiNbO3\nelectro-optic modulator. A zero bias Schottky detector is used as the detector\nand demodulator of the data stream followed by the high-gain and low-noise\npre-amplifier. The Terahertz carrier frequency is fixed at 138 GHz and the\nsystem is characterized by measuring the bit error rate for the pseudo random\nbit sequences at 5.5 Gbps. By optimizing the link geometry and decision\nparameters, an error-free (BER<10-10) transmission at a link distance of 1m is\nachieved. Finally, we detail integration of a professional 4K camera into the\nTHz communication link, and demonstrate live streaming of the uncompressed HD\nand 4K video followed by analysis of the link quality.\n", "  We detail the application of bounding volume hierarchies to accelerate\nsecond-virial evaluations for arbitrary complex particles interacting through\nhard and soft finite-range potentials. This procedure, based on the\nconstruction of neighbour lists through the combined use of recursive\natom-decomposition techniques and binary overlap search schemes, is shown to\nscale sub-logarithmically with particle resolution in the case of molecular\nsystems with high aspect ratios. Its implementation within an efficient\nnumerical and theoretical framework based on classical density functional\ntheory enables us to investigate the cholesteric self-assembly of a wide range\nof experimentally-relevant particle models. We illustrate the method through\nthe determination of the cholesteric behaviour of hard, structurally-resolved\ntwisted cuboids, and report quantitative evidence of the long-predicted phase\nhandedness inversion with increasing particle thread angles near the\nphenomenological threshold value of $45^\\circ$. Our results further highlight\nthe complex relationship between microscopic structure and helical twisting\npower in such model systems, which may be attributed to subtle geometric\nvariations of their chiral excluded-volume manifold.\n", "  Stability analysis of interacting dark energy models generally divides its\nparameters space into two regions: (i) $w_x \\geq -1$ and $\\xi \\geq 0$ and (ii)\n$w_x \\leq -1$ and $\\xi \\leq 0$, where $w_x$ is the dark energy equation of\nstate and $\\xi$ is the coupling strength of the interaction. Due to this\nseparation, crucial information about the cosmology and phenomenology of these\nmodels may be lost. In a recent study it has been shown that one can unify the\ntwo regions with a coupling function which depends on the dark energy equation\nof state. In this work we introduce a new coupling function which also unifies\nthe two regions of the parameter space and generalises the previous proposal.\nWe analyse this scenario considering the equation of state of DE to be either\nconstant or dynamical. We study the cosmology of such models and constrain both\nscenarios with the use of latest astronomical data from both background\nevolution as well as large scale structures. Our analysis shows that a non-zero\nvalue of the coupling parameter $\\xi$ as well as the dark energy equation of\nstate other than `$-1$' are allowed. However, within $1\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel, $\\xi = 0$, and the dark energy equation of state equal to `$-1$' are\ncompatible with the current data. In other words, the observational data allow\na very small but nonzero deviation from the $\\Lambda$-cosmology, however,\nwithin $1\\sigma$ confidence-region the interacting models can mimick the\n$\\Lambda$-cosmology. In fact we observe that the models both at background and\nperturbative levels are very hard to distinguish form each other and from\n$\\Lambda$-cosmology as well. Finally, we offer a rigorous analysis on the\ncurrent tension on $H_0$ allowing different regions of the dark energy equation\nof state which shows that interacting dark energy models reasonably solve the\ncurrent tension on $H_0$.\n", "  Highly conductive solid electrolytes are one key component for the\ndevelopment of safe and high-power all-solid-state batteries. Enormous progress\nhas been achieved in the field of lithium solid electrolytes. Meanwhile, their\nion conductivities match those of liquid electrolytes used in commercial Li+\nion batteries. However, the future availability and the price of lithium are\npoints of concern, so that Na+ ion conductors have come into the spotlight in\nrecent years. Here we present the superionic conductor Na11Sn2PS12 consisting\nexclusively of abundant elements. This material exhibits a room temperature Na+\nion conductivity close to 4 mS/cm, the highest value known to date for\nsulfide-based solids. Importantly, the stoichiometry of this quaternary\ncompound differs from that of the Li analogues, in derogation from recent\ntheoretical and experimental works. Structure determination based on synchroton\nX-ray powder diffraction data proves the existence of Na+ vacancies in the\ntetragonal structure that speed up Na+ ion transport, an untypical mechanism in\nsuperion conductors. The results indicate that sodium electrolytes are about to\nequal the performance of their lithium counterparts. The major target\napplication is clean and safe energy storage, for which the lower energy\ndensity of Na+ ion batteries is not a concern, but long-term materials\navailability and costs are important prerequisites.\n", "  Muon imaging is one of the most promising non-invasive techniques for density\nstructure scanning, specially for large objects reaching the kilometre scale.\nIt has already interesting applications in different fields like geophysics or\nnuclear safety and has been proposed for some others like engineering or\narchaeology. One of the approaches of this technique is based on the well-known\nradiography principle, by reconstructing the incident direction of the detected\nmuons after crossing the studied objects. In this case, muons detected after a\nprevious forward scattering on the object surface represent an irreducible\nbackground noise, leading to a bias on the measurement and consequently on the\nreconstruction of the object mean density. Therefore, a prior characterization\nof this effect represents valuable information to conveniently correct the\nobtained results. Although the muon scattering process has been already\ntheoretically described, a general study of this process has been carried out\nbased on Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in a versatile tool to evaluate\nthis effect for different object geometries and compositions. As an example,\nthese simulations have been used to evaluate the impact of forward scattered\nmuons on two different applications of muon imaging: archaeology and\nvolcanology, revealing a significant impact on the latter case. The general way\nin which all the tools used have been developed can allow to make equivalent\nstudies in the future for other muon imaging applications following the same\nprocedure.\n", "  We show how to transform the mathematical expression of any monochromatic\nparaxial light beam into the expression of a pulsed beam whose diffraction is\nswitched from the axial direction to its temporal structure. We exemplify this\ntransformation with time-diffracting Gaussian beams. The conditions for the\nobtained diffraction-free wave to be physically meaningful are discussed.\n", "  Graphene oxide (GO) membranes continue to attract intense interest due to\ntheir unique molecular sieving properties combined with fast permeation rates.\nHowever, the membranes' use has been limited mostly to aqueous solutions\nbecause GO membranes appear to be impermeable to organic solvents, a phenomenon\nnot fully understood yet. Here, we report efficient and fast filtration of\norganic solutions through GO laminates containing smooth two-dimensional (2D)\ncapillaries made from flakes with large sizes of ~ 10-20 micron. Without\nsacrificing their sieving characteristics, such membranes can be made\nexceptionally thin, down to ~ 10 nm, which translates into fast permeation of\nnot only water but also organic solvents. We attribute the organic solvent\npermeation and sieving properties of ultrathin GO laminates to the presence of\nrandomly distributed pinholes that are interconnected by short graphene\nchannels with a width of 1 nm. With increasing the membrane thickness, the\norganic solvent permeation rates decay exponentially but water continues to\npermeate fast, in agreement with previous reports. The application potential of\nour ultrathin laminates for organic-solvent nanofiltration is demonstrated by\nshowing >99.9% rejection of various organic dyes with small molecular weights\ndissolved in methanol. Our work significantly expands possibilities for the use\nof GO membranes in purification, filtration and related technologies.\n", "  Assessing the quality of a multi-qubit state is a multi-faceted problem, It\ninvolves considering disparate aspects, and, while some of these are collective\nindicators such as purity and degree of entanglement, others look more in\ndetail at the form of the correlations between subsystems. Obtaining a\nvisualisation of these details would give at least a qualitative indication,\nbut the density matrix, with its large number of parameters, hardly offers\ninsights. Here we show how relying on the Wigner function of a multipartite\nsystem provides rich information on the state, both at an illustrative level,\nby choosing proper slicing on the phase space, and at a quantitative one, by\nintroducing new figures of merit for the state quality. We test this concept on\na GHZ and W state produced in a photonic architecture making use of the\nmultiple degrees of freedom of two photons.\n", "  We study the Schwartz class of initial-boundary value (IBV) problems for the\nintegrable Fokas-Lenells equation on the half-line via the Deift-Zhou's\nnonlinear descent method analysis of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem\nsuch that the asymptotics of the Schwartz class of IBV problems as t\\to\\infty\nis presented.\n", "  We solve the XXZ Gaudin model with generic boundary using the modified\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz. The diagonal and triangular cases have been recovered\nin this general framework. We show that the model for odd or even lengths has\ntwo different behaviors. The corresponding Bethe equations are computed for all\nthe cases. For the chain with even length, inhomogeneous Bethe equations are\nnecessary. The higher spin Gaudin models with generic boundary is also treated.\n", "  We test the possible deviation of the cosmic distance duality relation\n$D_A(z)(1+z)^2/D_L(z)\\equiv 1$ using the standard candles/rulers in a fully\nmodel-independent manner. Type-Ia supernovae are used as the standard candles\nto derive the luminosity distance $D_L(z)$, and ultra-compact radio sources are\nused as the standard rulers to obtain the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$.\nWe write the deviation of distance duality relation as\n$D_A(z)(1+z)^2/D_L(z)=\\eta(z)$. Specifically, we use two parameterizations of\n$\\eta(z)$, i.e. $\\eta_1(z)=1+\\eta_0 z$ and $\\eta_2(z)=1+\\eta_0 z/(1+z)$. The\nparameter $\\eta_0$ is obtained using the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods by\ncomparing $D_L(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ at the same redshift. The best-fitting results\nare $\\eta_0=-0.06\\pm 0.05$ and $-0.18\\pm 0.16$ for the first and second\nparameterizations, respectively. Our results depend on neither the cosmological\nmodels, nor the matter contents or the curvature of the universe.\n", "  This is a PhD dissertation. Ignited by the chiral anomaly of recently\ndiscovered Weyl (semi-)metals, we study the chiral magnetic effect and the\nnatural optical activity of noncentrosymmetric metals. Both phenomena are\nrelated to the linear-in-$\\mathbf{q}$ spatial dispersion of the optical\nconductivity tensor, and can be calculated within the formalism of the\nsemiclassical kinetic equation. Therefore, we calculate the dispersion of\noptical conductivity up to the linear order of the wave vector, in the low\nfrequency regime, with both the semiclassical Boltzmann equation and the Kubo\nformula. The two different methods of calculation provide us the same result.\nIn this result, the static and dynamic chiral magnetic effects are revealed to\nhave different origin: one comes from topology, related to Berry monopoles, and\nthe other has a geometric origin, which is determined by the orbital magnetic\nmoment. The Faraday rotation of the polarization of light transmitted through a\nslab of the sample provides us the most direct way to measure the magnitude of\ndynamic chiral magnetic effect. We develop an effective medium theory for\nelectromagnetic wave propagating through gapless nonuniform systems, to\ncalculate macroscopic sample inhomogeneities induced corrections to the chiral\nmagnetic conductivity. We show that, in metals with low carrier density, the\nway in which macroscopic fluctuations of the local conductivity affect the\nfrequency dependent of the measured optical polarization rotation angle: by\ncreating a sharp feature near the plasma edge, which can be detected by\nexperiments. Then we narrow down our research a bit further to the current\ninduced magnetization.\n", "  Magnetic nanoarray with special geometries exhibits nontrivial collective\nbehaviors similar to those observed in the spin ice materials. Here we present\na novel circuit model to describe the complex magnetotransport phenomena in\nartificial kagome spin ice. In this picture, the system can be viewed as a\nresistor network driven by voltage sources that are located at vertices of the\nhoneycomb array. The differential voltages across different terminals of these\nsources are related to the ice-rules that govern the local magnetization\nordering. The circuit model relates the transverse Hall voltage of kagome ice\nto the underlying spin correlations. Treating the magnetic nanoarray as\nmetamaterials, we present a mesoscopic constitutive equation relating the Hall\nresistance to magnetization components of the system. We further show that the\nHall signal is significantly enhanced when the kagome ice undergoes a\nmagnetic-charge ordering transition. Our analysis can be readily generalized to\nother lattice geometry, providing a quantitative method for the design of\nmagnetoresistance devices based on artificial spin ices.\n", "  We investigate universal properties of one-dimensional multi-component\nsystems comprised of fermions, bosons, or an arbitrary mixture, with contact\ninteractions and subjected to an external potential. The masses and the\ncoupling strengths between different types of particles are allowed to be\ndifferent and we also take into account the presence of an arbitrary magnetic\nfield. We show that the momentum distribution of these systems exhibits a\nuniversal $n_\\sigma(k) \\sim C_\\sigma/k^4$ decay with $C_\\sigma$ the contact of\nspecies $\\sigma$ which can be computed from the derivatives of an appropriate\nthermodynamic potential with respect to the scattering lengths. In the case of\nintegrable fermionic systems we argue that at fixed density and repulsive\ninteractions the total contact reaches its maximum in the balanced system and\nmonotonically decreases to zero as we increase the magnetic field. The converse\neffect is present in integrable bosonic systems: the contact is largest in the\nfully polarized state and reaches its minimum when all states are equally\npopulated. We obtain short distance expansions for the Green's function and\npair distribution function and show that the coefficients of these expansions\ncan be expressed in terms of the density, kinetic energy and contact. In\naddition we derive universal thermodynamic identities relating the total energy\nof the system, pressure, trapping energy and contact. Our results are valid at\nzero and finite temperature, for homogeneous or trapped systems and for\nfew-body or many-body states.\n", "  The translation of a bubble under the action of an acoustic forcing finds\napplications in fields ranging from drug delivery to sonoluminesce. This\nphenomenon has been widely studied for cases where the amplitude of the forcing\nremains constant over time. However, in many practical applications, the\nduration of the forcing is not long enough for the bubble to attain a constant\ntranslational velocity, mainly due to the effect of the history force. Here, we\ndevelop a formulation, valid in the limit of very viscous flow and\nsmall-amplitude acoustic forcing, that allows us to describe the transient\ndynamics of bubbles driven by acoustic pulses consisting of a finite number of\ncycles. We also present an asymptotic solution to this theory for the case of a\nfinite-duration sinusoidal pressure pulse. This solution takes into account\nboth the history integral term and the transient period that the bubble needs\nto achieve steady radial oscillations, being the former dominant during most of\nthe acceleration process. Moreover, by introducing some additional assumptions,\nwe derive a simplified formula that describes fairly well the time evolution of\nthe bubble velocity. Using this solution we show that the convergence to the\nsteady translational velocity, given by the so-called Bjerknes force, occurs\nrather slowly, namely as $\\tau^{-1/2}$, which explains the slow convergence of\nthe bubble velocity and stresses the importance of taking into account the\nhistory force.\n", "  In these notes we discuss various methods relevant to the numerical\nconstruction of stationary black hole solutions in General Relativity with\nnegative cosmological constant. We focus on solutions which explicitly break\ntranslational invariance along the boundary directions. Within the framework of\nthe gauge/gravity duality, these can be interpreted as lattices. They have\nfinite conductivity and thus help us move one step forward towards more\nrealistic scenarios in holography.\n", "  In the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) scheme, the success probability of\nquantum teleportation is given by ${n \\over n+1}$, wehre $2n$ is the number of\nthe ancilla qubits. For the high-fidelity approach in the KLM scheme, the\nsuccess probability is approximately given by $1-{1 \\over n^{2}}$ for large\n$n$. We give an explicit prescription to prepare an optimal ancilla state and\ngive an exact lower bound of the success probability for the high-fidelity\napproach for arbitrary $n$.\n", "  Micro-organisms expend energy moving through complex media. While propulsion\nspeed is an important property of locomotion, efficiency is another factor that\nmay determine the swimming gait adopted by a micro-organism in order to\nlocomote in an energetically favorable manner. The efficiency of swimming in a\nNewtonian fluid is well characterized for different biological and artificial\nswimmers. However, these swimmers often encounter biological fluids displaying\nshear-thinning viscosities. Little is known about how this nonlinear rheology\ninfluences the efficiency of locomotion. Does the shear-thinning rheology\nrender swimming more efficient or less? How does the swimming efficiency depend\non the propulsion mechanism of a swimmer and rheological properties of the\nsurrounding shear-thinning fluid? In this work, we address these fundamental\nquestions on the efficiency of locomotion in a shear-thinning fluid by\nconsidering the squirmer model as a general locomotion model to represent\ndifferent types of swimmers. Our analysis reveals how the choice of surface\nvelocity distribution on a squirmer may reduce or enhance the swimming\nefficiency. We determine optimal shear rates at which the swimming efficiency\ncan be substantially enhanced com- pared with the Newtonian case. The\nnon-trivial variations of swimming efficiency prompt questions on how\nmicro-organisms may tune their swimming gaits to exploit the shear-thinning\nrheology. The findings also provide insights into how artificial swimmers\nshould be designed to move through complex media efficiently.\n", "  The present-day orbit of 2017 UV43 resembles the average one of the fragments\nof comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Here, we present numerical evidence suggesting that\n2017 UV43 might be related to Shoemaker-Levy 9. With our exploratory results we\nintend to encourage a search for precovery images of 2017 UV43 and perhaps even\nfollow-up observations that may help in improving its poorly determined orbit\nso its true dynamical nature can be understood.\n", "  Differential equations are a powerful tool to tackle Feynman integrals. In\nthis talk we discuss recent progress, where the method of differential\nequations has been applied to Feynman integrals which are not expressible in\nterms of multiple polylogarithms.\n", "  W UMa-type contact binaries belong to close binary systems whose components\nexactly overflow their Roche lobes and share a common convective envelope\n(CCE). In the last twenty years, the long-term variations of their orbital\nperiods have been thought to depend on several mechanisms. Now, we suggest a\nnew mechanism: CCE-dominated mechanism. The CCE-dominated mechanism is found\nbased on our numerical result, especially at high mass ratios, that the orbital\nperiods (P) of contact binaries change very much with their fill-out factors\n(f). Because f is taken as a measurement of the thickness of CCE, the physical\ncause for the variation of P is a mass transfer between CCE and components.\nFurther, an f-dominated simplification model for this mechanism is introduced.\nAccording to it, P may change in a long-term oscillation way with a similar\ntime scale of the thermal modulation, meanwhile q is decreasing slowly till the\ntwo components merge. It could be also applied to explain the presence of\nextremely short period, high mass ratio and deep contact binaries. Moreover,\nthe CCE-dominated mechanism should always work due to mass transfer and mass\nloss both occurring via CCE. Therefor, the effect of CCE on the variations of\norbital periods may have been underestimated before.\n", "  We present the discovery of a binary millisecond pulsar (MSP), PSR\nJ2322$-$2650, found in the Southern section of the High Time Resolution\nUniverse survey. This system contains a 3.5-ms pulsar with a $\\sim10^{-3}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ companion in a 7.75-hour circular orbit. Follow-up observations at\nthe Parkes and Lovell telescopes have led to precise measurements of the\nastrometric and spin parameters, including the period derivative, timing\nparallax, and proper motion. PSR J2322$-$2650 has a parallax of $4.4\\pm1.2$\nmas, and is thus at an inferred distance of $230^{+90}_{-50}$ pc, making this\nsystem a candidate for optical studies. We have detected a source of\n$R\\approx26.4$ mag at the radio position in a single $R$-band observation with\nthe Keck Telescope, and this is consistent with the blackbody temperature we\nwould expect from the companion if it fills its Roche lobe. The intrinsic\nperiod derivative of PSR J2322$-$2650 is among the lowest known,\n$4.4(4)\\times10^{-22}$ s s$^{-1}$, implying a low surface magnetic field\nstrength, $4.0(4)\\times10^7$ G. Its mean radio flux density of 160 $\\mu$Jy\ncombined with the distance implies that its radio luminosity is the lowest ever\nmeasured, $0.008(5)$ mJy kpc$^2$. The inferred population of these systems in\nthe Galaxy may be very significant, suggesting that this is a common MSP\nevolutionary path.\n", "  In this thesis we give a pedagogical introduction to the construction of\nNS5-D6(-O6)-D8(-O8) brane setups in massive type IIA string theory and the\nsix-dimensional $(1,0)$ SCFT's they engineer. After describing how to introduce\nthe various ingredients (and their interplay) in type IIA, we explain how to\nread off an effective linear quiver description of the SCFT's from the brane\nsetups. We then explain in detail how to construct all AdS$_7$ solutions of\nmassive IIA supergravity which are dual to the field theories. We do this by\nexploiting the power of generalized complex geometry. We then show how to\nestablish a holographic dictionary between four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$\ncompactifications on a Riemann surface (without punctures) of the $(1,0)$\nSCFT's and a certain class of massive IIA AdS$_5$ solutions, which are in\none-to-one correspondence with the AdS$_7$ vacua. We provide evidence for the\nadvocated AdS$_7$/CFT$_6$ and AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ dualities by computing the\n(leading order of the) field theory $a$ conformal anomaly from supergravity.\nFinally, we briefly touch upon the construction of five-dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT's through fivebrane webs, and reduce the classification\nproblem of their type IIB AdS$_6$ duals to a system of two coupled PDEs.\n", "  We obtain the complete local solutions with 16 supersymmetries to Type IIB\nsupergravity on a space-time of the form $AdS_{2}\\times S^{6}$ warped over a\nRiemann surface $\\Sigma$ in terms of two locally holmorphic functions on\n$\\Sigma$. We construct the general Ansatz for the bosonic supergravity fields\nand supersymmetry generators compatible with the $SO(2,1)\\oplus SO(7)$ isometry\nalgebra of space-time, which extends to the corresponding real form of the\nexceptional Lie superalgebra $F(4)$. We reduce the BPS equations to this\nAnsatz, obtain their general local solutions, and show that these local\nsolutions solve the full Type IIB supergravity field equations and Bianchi\nidentities. We contrast the $AdS_{2}\\times S^{6}$ solution with the closely\nrelated $AdS_6\\times S^2$ case and present our results for both in parallel.\nFinally, we present a preliminary analysis of positivity and regularity\nconditions for $AdS_{2}\\times S^{6}$, but postpone the construction of globally\nregular solutions to a subsequent paper.\n", "  The unwinding inflation mechanism is studied in a type IIB flux\ncompactification where all moduli are stabilized using flux, non-perturbative\neffects, and the leading alpha' corrections of the large volume scenario. We\nconsider the backreaction on the geometry due to the presence of anti-D3 branes\nas well as the backreaction of inflation on the Kaehler moduli, and compute the\nresulting corrections to the slow-roll potential. By taking large flux numbers,\nwe are able to find inflationary epochs where backreaction effects are under\ncontrol, the inflaton traverses a super-Planckian field range, and the\nresulting amplitude of scalar perturbations is consistent with observation.\n", "  We show that a simple extension of the Standard Model involving the\nintroduction of vector-like quarks and heavy neutrinos, provides an explanation\nof the so called B-anomalies in $b\\to s\\ell\\bar\\ell$ transitions. Vector-like\nquarks can explain, in the context of a discrete flavour symmetry, all the\nrelevant characteristics of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa sector. It is in this\nframework that we study the requirements on the masses of the vector like\nquarks and the heavy neutrinos leading to viable models with sufficient\ndeviations of lepton flavour universality and which simultaneously avoid too\nlarge Flavour Changing Neutral Current effects. Related predictions on $b\\to\nd\\ell\\bar\\ell$ and $s\\to d\\ell\\bar\\ell$ transitions are also analysed in\ndetail.\n", "  We present a single candidate transit event around Proxima Centauri, found\nduring a blind transit search using a robotic 30\\,cm telescope at Las Campanas\nObservatory. The event lasted 1 hour, with an estimated depth of 5\\,mmag, and\nis inconsistent with the transit window predicted for the recently discovered\nplanet b. We modeled the lightcurve under the assumption that the event was\ncaused by a transiting exoplanet, and our model predicts the planet has a\nradius $R \\sim 1 R_{\\oplus}$. We encourage continued monitoring of Proxima to\nelucidate the origin of this event.\n", "  Titan's atmosphere is optically thick and hides the surface and the lower\nlayers from the view at almost all wavelengths. However, because gaseous\nabsorptions are spectrally selective, some narrow spectral intervals are\nrelatively transparent and allow to probe the surface. To use these intervals\n(called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once\ngas spectroscopic linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows\ndepends on the way the far wings of the methane absorption lines are cut-off.\nWe know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained with the same\ncut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 {\\mu}m. This discrepancy is\ngenerally treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off\ndescription for this specific window. This window is relatively transparent and\nsurface may have specific spectral signatures that could be detected. Thus, a\ngood knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope is to better\nunderstand what causes the difference between the 2 {\\mu}m window and the other\nwindows. In this work, we used scattered light at the limb and transmissions in\noccultation observed with VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) onboard\nCassini, around the 2 {\\mu}m window. Data shows an absorption feature that\nparticipates to the shape of this window. Our atmospheric model fits well the\nVIMS data at 2 {\\mu}m with the same cut-off than for the other windows,\nprovided an additional absorption is introduced in the middle of the window\naround ~2.065 {\\mu}m. It explains well the discrepancy between the cut-off used\nat 2 {\\mu}m, and we show that a gas with a fairly constant mixing ratio,\npossibly ethane, may be the cause of this absorption. Finally, we studied the\nimpact of this absorption on the retrieval of the surface reflectivity and\nfound that it is significant.\n", "  Wildland fire dynamics is a complex turbulent dimensional process. Cellular\nautomata (CA) is an efficient tool to predict fire dynamics, but the main\nparameters of the method are challenging to estimate. To overcome this\nchallenge, we compute statistical distributions of the key parameters of a CA\nmodel using infrared images from controlled burns. Moreover, we apply this\nanalysis to different spatial scales and compare the experimental results to a\nsimple statistical model. By performing this analysis and making this\ncomparison, several capabilities and limitations of CA are revealed.\n", "  In this work the theoretical basis for the famous formula of Macleod,\nrelating the surface tension of a liquid in equilibrium with its own vapor to\nthe one-particle densities in the two phases of the system, is derived. Using\nthe statistical- mechanical definition of the surface tension, it is proved\nthat this property is, at the first approximation, given by the Macleod\nformula.\n", "  Electrons in atoms and molecules are versatile physical systems covering a\nvast range of light-matter interactions, enabling the physics of Rydberg\nstates, photon-photon bound states, simulation of condensed matter\nHamiltonians, and quantum sources of light. A limitation on the versatility of\nsuch electronic systems for optical interactions would appear to arise from the\ndiscrete nature of the electronic transitions and from the limited ionization\nenergy, constraining the energy scale through which the rich physics of bound\nelectrons can be accessed. In this work, we propose the concept of shaping\nspatially confined electron wavepackets as superpositions of extended states in\nthe ionization continuum. These wavepackets enable customizable optical\nemission spectra transitions in the eV-keV range. We find that the specific\nshaping lengthens the diffraction lifetime of the wavepackets in exchange for\nincreasing their spatial spreads. Finally, we study the spontaneous radiative\ntransitions of these excited states, examining the influence of the wavepacket\nshape and size on the radiation rate of the excited state. We observe that the\nrate of radiative capture is primarily limited by the diffraction lifetime of\nthe wavepacket. The approach proposed in this work could have applications\ntowards developing designer emitters at tunable energy and length scales,\npotentially bringing the physics of Rydberg states to new energy scales and\nextending the range and versatility of emitters that can be developed using\nshaped electrons.\n", "  Simpler and more rapid approaches for therapeutic drug-level monitoring are\nhighly desirable to enable use at the point-of-care. We have developed an\nall-electronic approach for detection of the HIV drug tenofovir based on\nscalable fabrication of arrays of graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs)\nfunctionalized with a commercially available DNA aptamer. The shift in the\nDirac voltage of the GFETs varied systematically with the concentration of\ntenofovir in deionized water, with a detection limit less than 1 ng/mL. Tests\nagainst a set of negative controls confirmed the specificity of the sensor\nresponse. This approach offers the potential for further development into a\nrapid and convenient point-of-care tool with clinically relevant performance.\n", "  It is a long standing question whether or not one can change the nature of\nspontaneous emission by a free electron through shaping the electron\nwavefunction. On one hand, shaping the electron wavefunction changes the\nrespective charge and current densities of the electron. On the other hand,\nspontaneous emission of an electron is an incoherent process and can often be\ninsensitive to the shape of the electron wavefunction. In this work, we arrive\nat an affirmative answer examining Bremsstrahlung radiation by free electron\nsuperposition states. We find that the radiation can be markedly different from\nan incoherent sum of the radiations of the two states because of interference\nof the radiation amplitudes from the two components of the superposition. The\nability to control free electron spontaneous emission via interference may\neventually result in a new degree of control over radiation over the entire\nelectromagnetic spectrum in addition to the ability to deterministically\nintroduce quantum behavior into normally classical light emission processes.\n", "  Complex systems performing spiking dynamics are widespread in Nature. They\ncover from earthquakes, to neurons, variable stars, social networks, or stock\nmarkets. Understanding and characterizing their dynamics is relevant in order\nto detect transitions, or to predict unwanted extreme events. Here we study the\noutput intensity of a semiconductor laser with feedback, in a regime where it\ndevelops a complex spiking behavior, under an ordinal patterns analysis. We\nunveil that the complex dynamics presents two competing behaviors that can be\ndistinguished with a thresholding method, and we use temporal correlations to\nforecast the extreme events, and transitions between dynamics.\n", "  The pixel's classification of images obtained from random heterogeneous\nmaterials is a relevant step to compute their physical properties, like\nEffective Transport Coefficients (ETC), during a characterization process as\nstochastic reconstruction. A bad classification will impact on the computed\nproperties; however, the literature on the topic discusses mainly the\ncorrelation functions or the properties formulae, giving little or no attention\nto the classification; authors mention either the use of a threshold or, in few\ncases, the use of Otsu's method. This paper presents a classification approach\nbased on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a comparison with the Otsu's-based\napproach, based on accuracy and precision. The data used for the SVM training\nare the key for a better classification; these data are the grayscale value,\nthe magnitude and direction of pixels gradient. For instance, in the case\nstudy, the accuracy of the pixel's classification is 77.6% for the SVM method\nand 40.9% for Otsu's method. Finally, a discussion about the impact on the\ncorrelation functions is presented in order to show the benefits of the\nproposal.\n", "  This paper gives the first full proof of the justification of the linear\nBoltzmann equation from an underlying long range particle evolution. We suppose\nthat a tagged particle is interacting with a background via a two body\npotential that is decaying faster than $ C\\exp\\left(-C|x|^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)\n$, and that the background is initially distributed according to a function in\n$L^1((\\mathbb{R}^3,(1+|v|^2)\\mathrm{d}v)$ in velocity and uniformly in space.\nUnder finite mass and energy assumptions on the initial density, the tagged\nparticle density converges weak-$\\star$ in $L^\\infty$ to a solution of the\nlinear Boltzmann equation.\n  The proof uses estimates on two body scattering and on the relationship\nbetween long range dynamics and dynamics with a truncated interaction potential\nto explicitly estimate the error between densities for long and short range\ndynamics. To compare the difference between the short range dynamics and the\nlinear Boltzmann equation, we use a tree based structure to encode the\ncollisional history of the tagged particle.\n", "  Biophysical modeling is the mediator of evaluating the cellular structure of\nbiological tissues using diffusion-weighted MRI. It is however the bottleneck\nof microstructural MRI. Beyond the complexity of diffusion, the current\ndevelopment is hindered by the fact that biophysical models heavily rely on\ndiffusion-specific properties of diverse cellular compartments that are still\nunknown and must be measured in vivo. Obtaining such parameters by\nstraightforward fitting is hindered by the degenerated landscape of the\nlikelihood functions, in particular, the signal obtained for multiple diffusion\ndirections and moderate diffusion weighting strength is not enough to estimate\nthese parameters: different parameter constellations explain the signal equally\nwell. The aim of this study is to measure the central parameter of white matter\nmodels, namely the intra-axonal water diffusivity in the normal human brain.\nProper estimation of this parameter is complicated due to (i) the presence of\nboth intra- and extra-axonal water compartments and (ii) the orientation\ndispersion of axons. Our measurement involves an efficient suppression of\nextra-axonal space and all cellular processes oriented outside a narrow cone\naround the principal fiber direction. This is achieved using a planar water\nmobility filter -- a strong diffusion weighting that suppresses signal from all\nmolecules that are mobile in the plane transverse to the fiber bundle.\nFollowing the planar filter, the diffusivity in the remaining compartment is\nmeasured using linear and isotropic weighting. We find the specifically\naveraged intra-axonal diffusivity $D_0 = 2.25\\pm 0.03{\\,\\rm \\mu m^2/ms}$ for\nthe timing of the applied gradients. Extrapolation to the infinite diffusion\ntime gives $D_\\infty \\approx 2.0{\\,\\rm \\mu m^2/ms}$. This result imposes a\nstrong limitation on the parameter selection for biophysical modeling of\ndiffusion-weighted MRI.\n", "  Experimental data for integrated kaon multiplicities taken at HERMES and\nCOMPASS measurements look incompatible with each other. In this talk, we\ninvestigate the effects of hadron masses calculated at leading-order and\nleading twist at the kinematics of these two experiments. We present evidence\nthat Hadron Mass Corrections can fully reconcile the data for the $K^+/K^-$\nmultiplicity ratio, and can also sizeably reduce the apparent large discrepancy\nin the case of $K^+ + K^-$ data. Residual differences in the shape of the\nlatter one remains to be understood.\n", "  Around the nuclear Fermi momentum, there is a transition of nucleon momentum\ndistribution n(k) in nuclear matter, i.e., from a constant to the $1/k^{4}$\nnucleon momentum distribution. While nowadays the transition momentum of\nminority in asymmetric matter is rarely studied and thus undetermined. In the\nframework of the IBUU transport model, proton transition momentum in nuclei is\nfirst studied. It is found that the transition momentum of proton is sensitive\nto the $\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio as well as the energetic photon production in\nneutron-rich nuclear reaction. This result may push the study of how the proton\nmomentum is distributed in neutron-rich matter forward and help us to better\nunderstand the dynamics of both neutron-rich nuclear reactions and neutron\nstars.\n", "  The atom-light interaction in a three-level system has shown significant\nphysical phenomena, such as electromagnetically induced transparency and\nAutler{Townes splitting (ATS), for broad applications in classical and quantum\ninformation techniques. Here, we optimally demonstrated the ATS with a quantum\nstate manipulation method. The ATS in the dephasing-dominated diamond NV center\nsystem was successfully recovered by coherent microwave control, which cannot\nbe observed with traditional method. The dynamical process of ATS was\ninvestigated in detail, revealing a nontrivial quantum interference with\ngeometric phase modulations. Based on the quantum interference, the signal of\nthe optimal ATS is twice as intense as those with traditional observation\nmethod.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate and characterize a photonic platform containing\nheterogeneous topological phases. This platform is shown to support valley-spin\nlocked edge states that can be routed based on their spin and valley degrees of\nfreedom. The routing is accomplished by changing the topology of the valley\nphotonic crystal embedded inside a spin-Hall photonic crystal.\n", "  A mutual synchronization of spin-torque oscillators coupled through current\ninjection is studied theoretically. Models of electrical coupling in parallel\nand series circuits are proposed. Solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation,\nexcitation of in-phase or antiphase synchronization, depending on the ways the\noscillators are connected, is found. It is also found from both analytical and\nnumerical calculations that the current-frequency relations for both parallel\nand series circuits are the same as that for a single spin-torque oscillator.\n", "  We examine the bounds on resonantly-produced sterile neutrino dark matter\nfrom phase-space densities of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). The\nbounds result from a derivation of the dark matter coarse-grained phase-space\ndensity from the stellar kinematics, which allows us to explore bounds from\nsome of the most compact dSphs without suffering the resolution limitation from\nN-body simulations that conventional methods have. We find that the strongest\nconstraints come from very compact dSphs, such as Draco II and Segue 1. We\nadditionally forecast the constraining power of a few dSph candidates that do\nnot yet have associated stellar kinematic data, and show that they can improve\nthe bounds if they are confirmed to be highly dark matter dominated systems.\nOur results demonstrate that compact dSphs provide important constraints on\nsterile neutrino dark matter that are comparable to other methods using as\nMilky Way satellite counts. In particular, if more compact systems are\ndiscovered from current or future surveys such as LSST or HSC, it should be\npossible to test models that explain the 3.5 keV X-ray line signal with a 7.1\nkeV sterile neutrino particle decay.\n", "  A computationally efficient method is presented for approximate optimization\nof cutting pattern of frame-supported and pneumatic membrane structures. The\nplane cutting sheet is generated by minimizing the error from the shape\nobtained by reducing the stress from the desired curved shape. The equilibrium\nshape is obtained solving a minimization problem of total strain energy. The\nexternal work done by the pressure is also incorporated for analysis of\npneumatic membrane. An approximate method is also proposed for analysis of an\nEthylene TetraFluoroEthylene (ETFE) film, where elasto-plastic behavior is\nmodeled as a nonlinear elastic material under monotonic loading condition.\nEfficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through examples of a\nframe-supported PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) membrane structure and an air\npressured square ETFE film.\n", "  We theoretically and experimentally investigated the transition between\nmodulation instability and Raman gain in a small silica microcavity with a\nlarge free-spectral range (FSR), which reveals that we can selectively switch\nfrom a four-wave mixing dominant state to a stimulated Raman scattering\ndominant state. Both the theoretical analysis and the experiment show that a\nRaman-dominant region is present between transitions of Kerr combs with\ndifferent free-spectral range spacings. We can obtain a stable Kerr comb and a\nstable Raman state selectively by changing the driving power, coupling between\nthe cavity and the waveguide, and laser detuning. Such a controllable\ntransition is achieved thanks to the presence of gain competition between\nmodulation instability and Raman gain in silica whispering gallery mode\nmicrocavities.\n", "  One of the outstanding problems in star-formation theory concerns the\ntransfer of angular momentum such that mass can accrete onto a newly born young\nstellar object (YSO). From a theoretical standpoint, outflows and jets are\npredicted to play an essential role in angular momentum transfer and their\nrotation motions have been reported for both low- and high-mass YSOs. However,\nlittle quantitative discussion on outflow launching mechanisms have been\npresented for high-mass YSOs due to a lack of observational data. Here we\npresent a clear signature of rotation in the bipolar outflow driven by Orion\nSource I, a high-mass YSO candidate, using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). A rotational transition of silicon\nmonoxide (Si18O) reveals a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis\nwhich is consistent with that of the circumstellar disk traced by a\nhigh-excitation water (H2O) line. The launching radii and outward velocity of\nthe outflow are estimated to be >10 au and 10 km s-1, respectively. These\nparameters rule out a possibility that the observed outflow is produced by\nentrainment of a high-velocity jet, and that contribution from stellar-wind or\nX-wind which have smaller launching radii are significant in the case of Source\nI. Thus, present results provide a convincing evidence of a rotating outflow\ndirectly driven by the magneto-centrifugal disk wind launched by a high-mass\nYSO candidate.\n", "  This work aims to understand the monogamy of quantum entanglement from a\ngeometrical point of view. By regarding quantum entanglement as a geometrical\nstructure on the state space of quantum systems and attributing all\nentanglement related properties as emergent from this geometry of entanglement,\nwe assume there exists a genuine general monogamous relation of quantum\nentanglement w.r.t. a correspondent genuine entanglement measure Q* which\npossesses an underlying geometrical origin. We speculate that the monogamous\nrelations w.r.t. an entanglement measure Q can be understood by comparing the\ndifferent dimension dependencies of the measure Q and Q*. We gave evidences of\nour conjecture by readdressing two observed properties of the monogamy\nrelations from this geometrical standpoint. Besides the phenomenal explanation\nof the monogamy of entanglement, we also discussed a fibre bundle structure\nbased candidate solution for the geometry of entanglement and explained how\nthis idea is related to the ER=EPR conjecture and other interesting quantum\ninformation processing problems including monogamy of entanglement,\nentanglement distillation, bound entanglement and activation, and entanglement\ncatalyst.\n", "  We establish concrete criteria for fully supported absolutely continuous\nspectrum for ergodic CMV matrices and purely absolutely continuous spectrum for\nlimit-periodic CMV matrices. We proceed by proving several variational\nestimates on the measure of the spectrum and the vanishing set of the Lyapunov\nexponent for CMV matrices, which represent CMV analogues of results obtained\nfor Schr\\\"odinger operators due to Y.\\ Last in the early 1990s. Having done so,\nwe combine those estimates with results from inverse spectral theory to obtain\npurely absolutely continuous spectrum.\n", "  This talk provides a limited review of SUSY scenarios with the focus on the\nway electroweak symmetry breaking is achieved and understood under different\nassumptions. Various aspects of naturalness and their implications are\ndiscussed and compared.\n", "  Spontaneous and closely related to it gravitational baryogenesis are\ncritically analyzed. It is shown that the coupling of the curvature scalar to\nbaryonic current, which induces nonzero baryonic asymmetry of the universe,\nsimultaneously leads to higher order gravitational equations, which have\nexponentially unstable solutions. It is shown that this instability endangers\nthe standard cosmology.\n", "  Thermal equilibrium rate can play an important role in the energy deposition\nof beam to the fuel in fast ignition due to high temperature difference between\nprojectile ions and background plasma ions. In this study the temperature\nequilibration rate of a quasi-monoenergetic deuteron beam with an equimolar\nDeuterium-Tritium fusion plasma with a Maxwellian energy distribution is\ncalculated by kinetic theory equations. In this theory, binary collisions is\ndescribed by the Boltzman equation and collective effects is described by the\nLenard-Balescu equation. The obtained results show that at higher background\ntemperatures, $T_{b}=100 keV$, the ions interactions effect in the temperature\nequilibration rate increases because the deuteron beam exchanges most of its\nenergy with ions plasma\n", "  Percolation models describe the inside of a porous material. The theory\nemerged timidly in the middle of the twentieth century before becoming one of\nthe major objects of interest in probability and mathematical physics. The\ngolden age of percolation is probably the eighties, during which most of the\nmajor results were obtained for the most classical of these models, named\nBernoulli percolation, but it is really the two following decades which put\npercolation theory at the crossroad of several domains of mathematics. In this\nshort (and very partial) review, we propose to describe briefly some of the\nrecent progress as well as some famous challenges remaining in the field. This\nreview is not intended to probabilists (and a fortiori not to specialists in\npercolation theory): the target audience is mathematicians of all kinds.\n", "  Recently synthesized two-dimensional (2D) boron, borophene, exhibits a novel\nmetallic behavior rooted in the s-p orbital hybridization, distinctively\ndifferent from other 2D materials such as sulfides/selenides and semi-metallic\ngraphene. This unique feature of borophene implies new routes for charge\ndelocalization and band gap opening. Herein, using first-principles\ncalculations, we explore the routes to localize the carriers and open the band\ngap of borophene via chemical functionalization, ribbon construction, and\ndefect engineering. The metallicity of borophene is found to be remarkably\nrobust against H- and F-functionalization and the presence of vacancies.\nInterestingly, a strong odd-even oscillation of the electronic structure with\nwidth is revealed for H-functionalized borophene nanoribbons, while an\nultra-high work function (~ 7.83 eV) is found for the F-functionalized\nborophene due to its strong charge transfer to the atomic adsorbates.\n", "  The axial anomaly is responsible for the masses and mixing of the mesons\n$\\eta$ and $\\eta'$. An open question is if (and to what extent) it affects also\nother hadrons. We show that anomalous terms can be important to understand the\nspectroscopy of the pseudotensor mesons $\\eta_2 (1645)$ and $\\eta_2 (1870)$. In\nfact, pseudotensor mesons belong to a so-called heterochiral multiplet, for\nwhich a quadratic mixing term between nonstrange and strange isoscalar members\narises. On the contrary, for so-called homochiral multiplets, such as the\nground-state (axial-)vector and tensor mesons, this mixing is not possible,\nhence one can easily understand why the isoscalar members of these multiplets\nare almost purely nonstrange and strange, respectively. Moreover, the axial\nanomaly can be also coupled to baryons (within the mirror assignment), and thus\nit helps to explain the large decay width $ N^{\\ast }(1535)\\rightarrow N\\eta$\nand to clarify which baryons are chiral partners.\n", "  The pioneering realization of suspensions of ferroelectric nanoparticles in a\nnematic host was one of excellent contributions of Yuri Reznikov to the science\nof liquid crystals [Y. Reznikov et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 82 (2003) 191]. This\nachievement created great excitement as entailed the enhancement of materials\ndielectric properties and increase of the phase transition temperature between\nnematic and isotropic phase. In this contribution, we examine the spectrum of\nfundamental fluctuations in one of his ferroelectric suspensions by dynamic\nlight scattering measurements, which gives insight into the coupling between\nthe particles and the orientation of the liquid crystalline matrix. We set side\nby side these results with the equivalent ones obtained for the case of stable\nsuspensions of ferromagnetic nanoplatelets in a nematic matrix showing\nmacroscopic ferromagnetic ordering. The underlying origin of the difference\nbetween the particle-matrix coupling observed in both cases is discussed and\nits effect on the orientational fluctuations spectrum is compared.\n", "  Inspired by classical (\"actual\") Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ and Modal\nQuantum Theory (MQT), which is a model of Quantum Theory over certain finite\nfields, we introduce General Quantum Theory as a Quantum Theory -- in the\nK{\\o}benhavn interpretation -- over general division rings with involution, in\nwhich the inner product \"is\" a $(\\sigma,1)$-Hermitian form $\\varphi$. This\nunites all known such approaches in one and the same theory, and we show that\nmany of the known results such as no-cloning, no-deleting, quantum\nteleportation and super-dense quantum coding, which are known in classical\nQuantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ and in some MQTs, hold for any General Quantum\nTheory. On the other hand, in many General Quantum Theories, a geometrical\nobject which we call \"quantum kernel\" arises, which is invariant under the\nunitary group $\\mathbf{U}(V,\\varphi)$, and which carries the geometry of a\nso-called polar space. We use this object to construct new quantum\n(teleportation) coding schemes, which mix quantum theory with the geometry of\nthe quantum kernel (and the action of the unitary group). We also show that in\ncharacteristic $0$, every General Quantum Theory over an algebraically closed\nfield behaves like classical Quantum Theory over $\\mathbb{C}$ at many levels,\nand that all such theories share one model, which we pin down as the \"minimal\nmodel,\" which is countable and defined over $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Moreover,\nto make the analogy with classical Quantum Theory even more striking, we show\nthat Born's rule holds in any such theory. So all such theories are not modal\nat all. Finally, we obtain an extension theory for General Quantum Theories in\ncharacteristic $0$ which allows one to extend any such theory over\nalgebraically closed fields (such as classical complex Quantum Theory) to\nlarger theories in which a quantum kernel is present.\n", "  Photographic plate archives contain a wealth of information about positions\nand brightness celestial objects had decades ago. Plate digitization is\nnecessary to make this information accessible, but extracting it is a technical\nchallenge. We develop algorithms used to extract photometry with the accuracy\nof better than ~0.1m in the magnitude range 13<B<17 from photographic images\nobtained in 1948-1996 with the 40cm Sternberg institute's astrograph (30x30cm\nplate size, 10x10deg field of view) and digitized using a flatbed scanner. The\nextracted photographic lightcurves are used to identify thousands of new\nhigh-amplitude (>0.2m) variable stars. The algorithms are implemented in the\nfree software VaST available at http://scan.sai.msu.ru/vast/\n", "  The aim of present work is to consider in more details recently theoretically\nobserved exotic \"color charge glow\" effect and possible physical effects\nrelated to ensembles of color charged particles on the classical level. We\nstudy ways of occurrence of \"color charge glow\" in arbitrary systems of point\nmassive particles which could be split into elementary configurations like\ncolor charges and color dipoles. Also the impact of this effect on dynamics of\nsuch systems is studying. For the natural regularization of expressions we\nconsider collisions of particles with given impact factor. We show that with\nreasonable values of impact factor collisions could be quite of\n\"electrodynamical\" (Coloumb-like) regime and the contribution of \"glow\" turns\nout to be suppressed in comparison with \"electrodynamical\" picture. It follows\nfrom the analysis of \"color echo\" effect that this result is still correct if\nwe consider more complicated configurations of particles because hard gluon\nfields could arise only due to immediate collisions but not as a result of some\neffects like \"color echo\".\n", "  In this thesis, we investigate hidden symmetries for the Maldacena-Wilson\nloop in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, mainly focusing on its strong-coupling\ndescription as a minimal surface in $AdS_5$. In the discussion of the symmetry\nstructure of the underlying string model, we highlight the role of the master\nsymmetry which can be employed to construct all symmetries of the model. The\nalgebra of these symmetries is worked out. For the concrete case of minimal\nsurfaces in $AdS_5$, we discuss the deformation of the four-cusp solution,\nwhich provides the dual description of the four-gluon scattering amplitude.\nThis marks the first step toward transferring the master symmetry to scattering\namplitudes. Moreover, we compute the master and Yangian symmetry variations of\ngeneric, smooth boundary curves. The discussion clarifies why previous attempts\nto transfer the deformations of minimal surfaces in $AdS_3$ to weak coupling\nwere unsuccessful. We discuss several attempts to transfer the Yangian symmetry\nto weak or arbitrary coupling, but ultimately conclude that a Yangian symmetry\nof the Maldacena-Wilson loop seems not to be present. This is different for the\nnatural supersymmetric generalizations of the Maldacena--Wilson loop, Wilson\nloops in superspace. Their one-loop expectation value is known to be Yangian\ninvariant. We discuss the strong-coupling counterpart of this finding by\nconsidering minimal surfaces in the superspace of type IIB superstring theory\nin $AdS_5 \\times S^5$. The comparison of the strong-coupling invariance derived\nhere with the weak-coupling generators shows that the local term must depend on\nthe coupling in a non-trivial way. Additionally, we show that the higher-level\nrecurrences of the hypercharge generator, the so-called bonus symmetries, are\npresent in all higher levels of the Yangian.\n", "  In this article, a numerical analysis of the projector augmented-wave (PAW)\nmethod is presented, restricted to the case of dimension one with Dirac\npotentials modeling the nuclei in a periodic setting. The PAW method is widely\nused in electronic ab initio calculations, in conjunction with\npseudopotentials. It consists in replacing the original electronic Hamiltonian\n$H$ by a pseudo-Hamiltonian $H^{PAW}$ via the PAW transformation acting in\nballs around each nuclei. Formally, the new eigenvalue problem has the same\neigenvalues as $H$ and smoother eigenfunctions. In practice, the\npseudo-Hamiltonian $H^{PAW}$ has to be truncated, introducing an error that is\nrarely analyzed. In this paper, error estimates on the lowest PAW eigenvalue\nare proved for the one-dimensional periodic Schr\\\"odinger operator with double\nDirac potentials.\n", "  We present an efficient method for simulating Coulomb systems confined by\nmetal electrodes. The approach relies on Green functions techniques to obtain\nthe electrostatic potential for an infinite periodically replicated system.\nThis avoids the use of image charges or an explicit calculation of the induced\nsurface charge, both of which dramatically slows down the simulations. To\ndemonstrate the utility of the new method we use it to obtain the ionic density\nprofiles and the differential capacitances, which are of great practical and\nheoretical interest, for a lattice model of an ionic liquid.\n", "  Metal halide perovskites are attracting tremendous interest for a variety of\noptoelectronic applications. The ability to tune the perovskite bandgap by\ntweaking the chemical compositions opens up new applications as coloured\nemitters and as components of tandem photovoltaics. Nevertheless, non-radiative\nlosses are still limiting performance, with luminescence yields in\nstate-of-the-art perovskite solar cells still far from 100% under solar\nillumination conditions. Furthermore, in mixed halide perovskite systems\ndesigned for continuous bandgap tunability (bandgaps ~1.7-1.9 eV),\nphoto-induced ion segregation leads to bandgap instabilities. Here, we\nsubstantially mitigate both non-radiative losses and photo-induced ion\nmigration in perovskite structures by decorating the surfaces and grain\nboundaries with passivating potassium-halide interlayers. We demonstrate\nexternal photo-luminescence quantum yields of 66%, translating to internal\nyields exceeding 95%. The high luminescence yields are achieved while\nmaintaining high mobilities over 40 cm2V-1s-1, giving the elusive combination\nof both high luminescence and excellent charge transport. We find that the\nexternal luminescence yield when interfaced with electrodes in a solar cell\ndevice stack, a quantity that must be maximized to approach the efficiency\nlimits, remains as high as 15%, indicating very clean interfaces. We also\ndemonstrate the inhibition of photo-induced ion migration processes across a\nwide range of mixed halide perovskite bandgaps that otherwise show bandgap\ninstabilities. We validate these results in full operating solar cells,\nhighlighting the importance of stabilising luminescence in device structures.\nOur work represents a critical breakthrough in the construction of tunable\nhalide perovskite films and interfaces that can approach the efficiency limits\nin tandem solar cells and coloured LEDs.\n", "  For non-critical almost Mathieu operators with Diophantine frequency, we\nestablish exponential asymptotics on the size of spectral gaps, and show that\nthe spectrum is homogeneous. We also prove the homogeneity of the spectrum for\nSch\\\"odinger operators with (measure-theoretically) typical quasi-periodic\nanalytic potentials and fixed strong Diophantine frequency. As applications, we\nshow the discrete version of Deift's conjecture \\cite{Deift, Deift17} for\nsubcritical analytic quasi-periodic initial data and solve a series of open\nproblems of Damanik-Goldstein et al \\cite{BDGL, DGL1, dgsv, Go} and Kotani\n\\cite{Kot97}.\n", "  This work presents a combined experimental and theoretical study of dynamic\ncontact angle hysteresis using liquid bridges under cyclic compression and\nstretching between two identical plates. Under various loading rates, contact\nangle hysteresis for three different liquids was measured by examination of\nadvancing and receding angles in liquid bridges, and the capillary forces were\nrecorded. It is found that, for a given liquid, the hysteretic phenomenon of\nthe contact angle is more pronounced at higher loading rates. By unifying the\nbehaviour of the three liquids, power-law correlations were proposed to\ndescribe the relationship between the dynamic contact angle and the capillary\nnumber for advancing and receding cases. It is found that the exponents of\nobtained power-law correlations differ from those derived through earlier\nmethods (e.g., capillary rise), due to the different kinematics of the\ntriple-line. The various hysteretic loops of capillary force in liquid bridges\nunder varied cyclic loading rates were also observed, which can be captured\nquantitatively by the prediction of our developed model incorporating the\ndynamic contact angle hysteresis. These results illustrate the importance of\nvarying triple-line geometries during dynamic wetting and dewetting processes,\nand warrant an improved modelling approach for higher level phenomena involving\nthese processes, e.g., multiphase flow in porous media and liquid transfer\nbetween surfaces with moving contact lines.\n", "  A cascade of phase transitions from square to hexagonal lattice is studied in\n2D system of particles interacting via core-softened potential. Due to the\npresence of two length-scales of repulsion, different local configurations with\nfour, five, and six neighbors enable, leading to formation of complex crystals.\nThe previously proposed interpolation method is generalized for calculation of\npair correlations in crystals which elemental cell consists of more than one\nparticle. A high efficiency of the method is illustrated using a snub square\nlattice as a representative example. Using molecular dynamics simulations, it\nis found that the snub square lattice is being broken under heating, generating\nhigh density quasicrystalline phase with 12-fold symmetry. Simple theoretical\nmodel is proposed to explain the physical mechanism governing this phenomenon:\nWith density growth (from square to hexagonal phases), the concentrations of\ndifferent local configurations randomly realized through plane tilling are\nbeing changed that minimizes the energy of the system. The calculated phase\ndiagram in the intermediate region of densities justifies the existence of HD12\nphase and demonstrates a cascade of the first-order transitions \"square -- HD12\n-- hexagonal\" solid phases with the density growth. The results allow us to\nbetter understand the physical mechanisms responsive for formation of\nquasicrystals, and, therefore, should be of interest for broad community on\nmaterial science and soft matter.\n", "  The method of noisy multiqubit quantum circuits modeling is proposed. The\nanalytical formulas for the dependence of quantum algorithms accuracy on qubits\ncount and noise level are obtained for Grover algorithm and quantum Fourier\ntransform. It is shown that the proposed approach is very much in line with\nresults obtained by Monte Carlo statistical modeling method. The developed\ntheory makes it possible to predict the influence of quantum noise on the\naccuracy of the forward-looking multiqubit quantum systems under development.\n", "  We present the Recola2 library for the efficient generation and computation\nof one-loop amplitudes in Beyond-Standard-Model theories. Recola2 is based on\nRecola, an efficient one-loop amplitude generator for the Standard Model, and\nRept1l, a newly developed tool to generate one-loop model files for Recola2 in\na fully automated way. Recola2 is able to operate with non-trivial extensions\nof the SM, e.g. extended Higgs sectors and effective field theories. We discuss\nfirst applications to extended Higgs sectors and their renormalization.\n", "  We demonstrate that the generic charged rotating regular black hole solutions\nof general relativity coupled to non-linear electrodynamics, obtained by using\nthe alternate Newman-Janis algorithm, introduces only small (on level\n$10^{-2}$) inconsistency in the behaviour of the electrodynamics Lagrangian.\nThis approves application of these analytic and simple solutions as\nastrophysically relevant, sufficiently precise approximate solutions describing\nrotating regular black holes.\n", "  In the present paper, we consider the excitonic effects on the single\nparticle normal density of states (DOS) in the bilayer graphene (BLG). The\nlocal interlayer Coulomb interaction is considered between the particles on the\nnon-equivalent sublattice sites in different layers of the BLG. We show the\npresence of the excitonic shift of the neutrality point, even for the\nnoninteracting layers. Furthermore, for the interacting layers, a very large\nasymmetry in the DOS structure is shown between the particle and hole channels.\nAt the large values of the interlayer hopping amplitude, a large number of DOS\nat the Dirac's point indicates the existence of the strong excitonic coherence\neffects between the layers in the BLG and the enhancement of the excitonic\ncondensation. We have found different competing orders in the interacting BLG.\nParticularly, a phase transition from the hybridized excitonic insulator phase\nto the coherent condensate state is shown at the small values of the local\ninterlayer Coulomb interaction.\n", "  In this paper we present the results of a $\\sim$5 hour airborne gamma-ray\nsurvey carried out over the Tyrrhenian sea in which the height range (77-3066)\nm has been investigated. Gamma-ray spectroscopy measurements have been\nperformed by using the AGRS_16L detector, a module of four 4L NaI(Tl) crystals.\nThe experimental setup was mounted on the Radgyro, a prototype aircraft\ndesigned for multisensorial acquisitions in the field of proximal remote\nsensing. By acquiring high-statistics spectra over the sea (i.e. in the absence\nof signals having geological origin) and by spanning a wide spectrum of\naltitudes it has been possible to split the measured count rate into a constant\naircraft component and a cosmic component exponentially increasing with\nincreasing height. The monitoring of the count rate having pure cosmic origin\nin the >3 MeV energy region allowed to infer the background count rates in the\n$^{40}$K, $^{214}$Bi and $^{208}$Tl photopeaks, which need to be subtracted in\nprocessing airborne gamma-ray data in order to estimate the potassium, uranium\nand thorium abundances in the ground. Moreover, a calibration procedure has\nbeen carried out by implementing the CARI-6P and EXPACS dosimetry tools,\naccording to which the annual cosmic effective dose to human population has\nbeen linearly related to the measured cosmic count rates.\n", "  Spin-polarized transport through a quantum dot side attached to a topological\nsuperconductor and coupled to a pair of normal leads is discussed in Coulomb\nand Kondo regimes. For discussion of Coulomb range equation of motion method\nwith extended Hubbard I approximation is used and Kondo regime is analyzed by\nKotliar-Ruckenstein slave boson approach. Apart from the occurrence of zero\nbias anomaly the presence of Majorana states reflects also in splitting of\nCoulomb lines. In the region of Coulomb borders the spin dependent negative\ndifferential conductance is observed. Due to the low energy scale of Kondo\neffect this probe allows for detection of Majorana states even for extremely\nweak coupling with topological wire. In this range no signatures of Majorana\nstates appear in Coulomb blockade dominated transport.\n", "  We show that SIPS J2045-6332, a late M/early L object previously identified\nas a candidate spectral mix binary, shows an elongated image shape. Using shape\nmeasurement techniques originally developed for cosmological weak lensing\nsurveys on VISTA VHS images we show that this likely blended binary has an\nimplied position angle of ~290 degrees East of North with a secondary companion\nthat is likely to be a late L dwarf. This object would be a good follow-up\ntarget for high resolution imaging studies\n", "  We have established an iterative scheme to calculate with 15-digit accuracy\nthe numerical values of Ambartsumian-Chandrasekhar's H-functions for\nanisotropic scattering characterized by the four-term phase function: the\nmethod incorporates some advantageous features of the iterative procedure of\nKawabata (2015) and the double-exponential integration formula~(DE-formula) of\nTakahashi and Mori (1974), which proved highly effective in Kawabata (2016).\nActual calculations of the H-functions have been carried out employing 27\nselected cases of the phase function, 56 values of the single scattering albedo\n$\\varpi_0$, and 36 values of an angular variable $\\mu(=\\cos \\theta)$, with\n$\\theta$ being the zenith angle specifying the direction of incidence and/or\nemergence of radiation.\n  Partial results obtained for conservative isotropic scattering, Rayleigh\nscattering, and anisotropic scattering due to a full four-term phase function\nare presented. As a sample application of the isotropic scattering H-function,\nan attempt is made in Appendix to simulate by iteratively solving the\nAmbartsumian equation the values of the plane and spherical albedos of a\nsemi-infinite, homogeneous atmosphere calculated by Rogovtsov and Borovik\n(2016), who employed their analytical representations for these quantities and\nthe single-term and two-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions of appreciably\nhigh degrees of anisotropy, to find that our results are in satisfactory\nagreement with theirs.\n", "  $^{222}$Rn is a noble radioactive gas produced along the $^{238}$U decay\nchain, which is present in the majority of soils and rocks. As $^{222}$Rn is\nthe most relevant source of natural background radiation, understanding its\ndistribution in the environment is of great concern for investigating the\nhealth impacts of low-level radioactivity and for supporting regulation of\nhuman exposure to ionizing radiation in modern society. At the same time,\n$^{222}$Rn is a widespread atmospheric tracer whose spatial distribution is\ngenerally used as a proxy for climate and pollution studies. Airborne gamma-ray\nspectroscopy (AGRS) always treated $^{222}$Rn as a source of background since\nit affects the indirect estimate of equivalent $^{238}$U concentration. In this\nwork the AGRS method is used for the first time for quantifying the presence of\n$^{222}$Rn in the atmosphere and assessing its vertical profile. High\nstatistics radiometric data acquired during an offshore survey are fitted as a\nsuperposition of a constant component due to the experimental setup background\nradioactivity plus a height dependent contribution due to cosmic radiation and\natmospheric $^{222}$Rn. The refined statistical analysis provides not only a\nconclusive evidence of AGRS $^{222}$Rn detection but also a (0.96 $\\pm$ 0.07)\nBq/m$^{3}$ $^{222}$Rn concentration and a (1318 $\\pm$ 22) m atmospheric layer\ndepth fully compatible with literature data.\n", "  The instabilities of fluid interfaces represent both a limitation and an\nopportunity for the fabrication of small-scale devices. Just as non-uniform\ncapillary pressures can destroy micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS), so\nthey can guide the assembly of novel solid and fluid structures. In many such\napplications the interface appears during an evaporation process and is\ntherefore only present temporarily. It is commonly assumed that this\nevaporation simply guides the interface through a sequence of equilibrium\nconfigurations, and that the rate of evaporation only sets the timescale of\nthis sequence. Here, we use Lattice-Boltzmann simulations and a theoretical\nanalysis to show that, in fact, the rate of evaporation can be a factor in\ndetermining the onset and form of dynamical capillary instabilities. Our\nresults shed light on the role of evaporation in previous experiments, and open\nthe possibility of exploiting diffusive mass transfer to directly control\ncapillary flows in MEMS applications.\n", "  Scenario of formation of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is proposed. Just like\nradio pulsars, sources of FRBs are magnetized neutron stars. Appearance of\nstrong electric field in a magnetosphere of a neutron star is associated with\nclose passage of a dense body near hot neutron star. For the repeating source\nFRB 121102, which has been observed in four series of bursts, the period of\norbiting of the body is about 200 days. Thermal radiation from the surface of\nthe star (temperature is of the order of $ 10^8 \\, K $) causes evaporation and\nionization of the matter of the dense body. Ionized gas (plasma) flows around\nthe magnetosphere of the neutron star with the velocity $ u \\simeq 10^7 \\, cm /\ns $, and creates electric potential $ \\psi_0 \\simeq 10^{11} \\, V $ in the polar\nregion of the magnetosphere. Electrons from the plasma flow are accelerated\ntoward the star, and gain Lorentz factor of $ \\simeq 10 ^ 5 $. Thermal photons\nmoving toward precipitating electrons are scattered by them, and produce gamma\nphotons with energies of $ \\simeq 10^5 \\, m_e c^2 $. These gamma quanta produce\nelectron-positron pairs in collisions with thermal photons. The multiplicity,\nthe number of born pairs per one primary electron, is about $ 10^5 $. The\nelectron-positron plasma, produced in the polar region of magnetosphere,\naccumulates in a narrow layer at a bottom of a potential well formed on one\nside by a blocking potential $ \\psi_0 $, and on the other side by pressure of\nthermal radiation. The density of electron-positron plasma in the layer\nincreases with time, and after short time the layer becomes a mirror for\nthermal radiation of the star. The thermal radiation in the polar region under\nthe layer is accumulated during time $ \\simeq 500 \\, s $, then the plasma layer\nis ejected outside. The ejection is observed as burst of radio emission formed\nby the flow of relativistic electron-positron plasma.\n", "  This is an annotated translation of Euler's 1777 manuscript \"De Figura Quam\nVentus Fluido Stagnanti Inducere Valet\", where Euler models the shape which the\nwind gives to a still liquid surface.\n", "  We propose a modeling approach to study how mature biofilms spread and\ncolonize new surfaces by predicting the formation and growth of satellite\ncolonies generated by dispersing biofilms. This model provides the basis for\nbetter understanding the fate and behavior of dispersal cells, phenomenon that\ncannot, as yet, be predicted from knowledge of the genome. The model results\nwere promising as supported by the experimental results. The proposed approach\nallows for further improvements through more detailed sub-models for front\npropagation, seeding, availability and depletion of resources. The present\nstudy was a successful proof-of-concept in answering the following questions:\nCan we predict the colonization of new sites following biofilm dispersal? Can\nwe generate patterns in space and time to shed light on seeding dispersal? That\nare fundamental issues for developing novel approaches to manipulate biofilm\nformation in industrial, environmental and medical applications.\n", "  We study the spin current tensor of a Dirac particle at accelerations close\nto the upper limit introduced by Caianiello. Continual interchange between\nparticle spin and angular momentum is possible only when the acceleration is\ntime-dependent. This represents a stringent limit on the effect that maximal\nacceleration may have on spin physics in astrophysical applications. We also\ninvestigate some dynamical consequences of maximal acceleration.\n", "  We calculate all main top-quark pair differential distributions at the\nTevatron. For the first time Tevatron predictions for this process include all\nStandard Model corrections through NLO (referred to as complete-NLO)\nconsistently combined with previously computed NNLO QCD corrections. We also\nassess, for the first time, the impact of dynamical scales on predictions for\nthe latest Tevatron measurements.\n", "  The band gap of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors can be efficiently tuned\nby gate electric field, which is so called the Stark effect. We report that\ndoping, which is essential in realistic devices, will substantially change the\nStark effect of few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides in unexpected ways.\nParticularly in bilayer structures, because of the competition between strong\nquantum confinement and intrinsic screening length, electron and hole dopings\nexhibit surprisingly different Stark effects: doped electrons actively screen\nthe external field and result in a nonlinear Stark effect; however, doped holes\ndo not effectively screen the external field, causing a linear Stark effect\nthat is the same as that of undoped materials. Our further analysis shows that\nthis unusual doping effect is not limited within transition metal\ndichalcogenides but general for 2D structures. Therefore, doping plays a much\nmore crucial role in functional 2D devices and this unusual Stark effect also\nprovides a new degree of freedom to tune band gaps and optical properties of 2D\nmaterials.\n", "  Doped free carriers can substantially renormalize electronic self-energy and\nquasiparticle band gaps of two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, it is still\nchallenging to quantitatively calculate this many-electron effect, particularly\nat the low doping density that is most relevant to realistic experiments and\ndevices. Here we develop a first-principles-based effective-mass model within\nthe GW approximation and show a dramatic band gap renormalization of a few\nhundred meV for typical 2D semiconductors. Moreover, we reveal the roles of\ndifferent many-electron interactions: The Coulomb-hole contribution is dominant\nfor low doping densities while the screened-exchange contribution is dominant\nfor high doping densities. Three prototypical 2D materials are studied by this\nmethod, h-BN, MoS2, and black phosphorus, covering insulators to\nsemiconductors. Especially, anisotropic black phosphorus exhibits a\nsurprisingly large band gap renormalization because of its smaller\ndensity-of-state that enhances the screened-exchange interactions. Our work\ndemonstrates an efficient way to accurately calculate band gap renormalization\nand provides quantitative understanding of doping-dependent many-electron\nphysics of general 2D semiconductors.\n", "  Bilayer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures such as MoS2/WS2 and MoSe2/WSe2\nhave attracted much attention recently, particularly because of their type II\nband alignments and the formation of interlayer exciton as the lowest-energy\nexcitonic state. In this work, we calculate the electronic and optical\nproperties of such heterostructures with the first-principles GW+Bethe-Salpeter\nEquation (BSE) method and reveal the important role of interlayer coupling in\ndeciding the excited-state properties, including the band alignment and\nexcitonic properties. Our calculation shows that due to the interlayer\ncoupling, the low energy excitons can be widely tunable by a vertical gate\nfield. In particular, the dipole oscillator strength and radiative lifetime of\nthe lowest energy exciton in these bilayer heterostructures is varied by over\nan order of magnitude within a practical external gate field. We also build a\nsimple model that captures the essential physics behind this tunability and\nallows the extension of the ab initio results to a large range of electric\nfields. Our work clarifies the physical picture of interlayer excitons in\nbilayer vdW heterostructures and predicts a wide range of gate-tunable\nexcited-state properties of 2D optoelectronic devices.\n", "  The determination of the optical spectrum of single-wall carbon nanotubes\n(SWCNTs) is essential for the development of opto-electronic components and\nsensors with application in many fields. Real SWCNTs are finite, but almost all\nthe studies performed so far use infinite SWCNTs. However, the spectra of\nfinite and infinite systems are different. In this work the optical spectrum of\nfinite (3,3) and (5,5) SWCNTs is calculated as a function of nanotube length.\nFor the (3,3) SWCNTs, the calculated absorption spectra for light polarised\nboth parallel and perpendicularly to the nanotube axis are in good agreement\nwith experimental results. However, our results indicate that the lowest energy\npeak present in the experimental results for light polarised parallel to the\nnanotube axis can be attributed to a surface-plasmon resonance that is a\nconsequence of the finite nature of the SWCNTs and not to the presence of\nSWCNTs with other chiralities, as claimed by the previous theoretical works.\nThe surface-plasmon resonance is also studied using the Aharonov-Bohm effect.\nFinally, this work demonstrates that the surface-plasmon resonance in finite\nSWCNT can be described using a 1D infinite well.\n", "  Given an element of the Bloch group of a number field~$F$ and a natural\nnumber~$m$, we construct an explicit unit in the field $F_m=F(e^{2 \\pi i/m})$,\nwell-defined up to $m$-th powers of nonzero elements of~$F_m$. The construction\nuses the cyclic quantum dilogarithm, and under the identification of the Bloch\ngroup of~$F$ with the $K$-group $K_3(F)$ gives an explicit formula for a\ncertain abstract Chern class from~$K_3(F)$. The units we define are conjectured\nto coincide with numbers appearing in the quantum modularity conjecture for the\nKashaev invariant of knots (which was the original motivation for our\ninvestigation), and also appear in the radial asymptotics of Nahm sums near\nroots of unity. This latter connection is used to prove one direction of Nahm's\nconjecture relating the modularity of certain $q$-hypergeometric series to the\nvanishing of the associated elements in the Bloch group\nof~$\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n", "  We create a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at the interface between\nEuO, a ferromagnetic insulator, and SrTiO3, a transparent non-magnetic\ninsulator considered the bedrock of oxide-based electronics. This is achieved\nby a controlled in-situ redox reaction between pure metallic Eu deposited at\nroom temperature on the surface of SrTiO3, an innovative bottom-up approach\nthat can be easily generalized to other functional oxides and scaled to\napplications. Additionally, we find that the resulting EuO capping layer can be\ntuned from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic, depending on the layer thickness.\nThese results demonstrate that the simple, novel technique of creating 2DESs in\noxides by deposition of elementary reducing agents [T. C. R\\\"odel et al., Adv.\nMater. 28, 1976 (2016)] can be extended to simultaneously produce an active,\ne.g. magnetic, capping layer enabling the realization and control of additional\nfunctionalities in such oxide-based 2DESs.\n", "  We prove characterization theorems for relative entropy (also known as\nKullback-Leibler divergence), q-logarithmic entropy (also known as Tsallis\nentropy), and q-logarithmic relative entropy. All three have been characterized\naxiomatically before, but we show that earlier proofs can be simplified\nconsiderably, at the same time relaxing some of the hypotheses.\n", "  We test Hardy's paradox of non-locality experimentally on the IBM five-qubit\nquantum computer for the first time. The quantum circuit is constructed on\nsuperconducting qubits corresponding to the original Hardy's test of\nnon-locality. Results confirmed the theory that any non-maximally entangled\nstate of two qubits violates Hardy's Equations, whereas any maximally entangled\nstate and product state of two qubits do not exhibit Hardy's non-locality. We\nalso point out the difficulties associated with the practical implementation of\nany Hardy's paradox based quantum protocol and propose three performance\nmeasures for any two qubits of any quantum computer.\n", "  Cosmology is intrinsically intertwined with questions in fundamental physics.\nThe existence of non-baryonic dark matter requires new physics beyond the\nStandard Model of elemenatary-particle interactions and Einstein's general\nrelativity, as does the accelerating expansion of the universe. Current\ntensions between various cosmological measurements may be harbingers of yet\nmore new physics. Progress on understanding dark matter and cosmic acceleration\nrequires long term, high-precision measurements and excellent control of\nsystematics, demanding observational programs that are often outside the\ndiscovery/characterization mode that drives many areas of astronomy. We outline\npotential programs through which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) could have a\nmajor impact on issues in fundamental physics in the coming years. To realize\nthis impact, we suggest the introduction of a \"HST Fundamental Physics\"\nobservational program that would be subject to a modified proposal and review\nprocess.\n", "  Information on the creation of the index-catalogue for articles published in\nthe journal \"Izvestia of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory\" (\"Izvestiya\nKrymskoj Astrofizicheskoj Observatorii\" from ADS Bibliographic Codes: Journal\nAbbreviation - IzKry) is presented. A brief history of the accumulation of\nreferences for the catalog, its structure and the scheme of interaction with\nthe basic world astronomical databases are described.\n", "  Lo and Ko in [1] have developed some attacks on the cryptosystem called\nAlphaEta [2], claiming that these attacks undermine the security of AlphaEta\nfor both direct encryption and key generation. In this paper, we show that\ntheir arguments fail in many different ways. In particular, the first attack in\n[1] requires channel loss or length of known-plaintext that is exponential in\nthe key length and is unrealistic even for moderate key lengths. The second\nattack is a Grover search attack based on `asymptotic orthogonality' and was\nnot analyzed quantitatively in [1]. We explain why it is not logically possible\nto ``pull back'' an argument valid only at n=infinity into a limit statement,\nlet alone one valid for a finite number of transmissions n. We illustrate this\nby a `proof' using a similar asymptotic orthogonality argument that\ncoherent-state BB84 is insecure for any value of loss. Even if a limit\nstatement is true, this attack is a priori irrelevant as it requires an\nindefinitely large amount of known-plaintext, resources and processing. We also\nexplain why the attacks in [1] on AlphaEta as a key-generation system are based\non misinterpretations of [2]. Some misunderstandings in [1] regarding certain\nissues in cryptography and optical communications are also pointed out. Short\nof providing a security proof for AlphaEta, we provide a description of\nrelevant results in standard cryptography and in the design of AlphaEta to put\nthe above issues in the proper framework and to elucidate some security\nfeatures of this new approach to quantum cryptography.\n", "  We discuss the quantum information channel, which is based on coherent and\npolarization sensitive interaction of light and atomic spin waves. We show that\nthe joint Heisenberg dynamics of the polarization Stokes components of light\nand of the angular momenta of atoms has a wave nature and can be properly\ndescribed in terms of the macroscopic polariton-type spin wave created in the\nsample. The principles of the quantum memory and readout protocols via the wave\ncoupling of the output time modes in the light subsystem and the output spatial\nmodes in the spin subsystem are demonstrated.\n", "  The potential weakness of the Y-00 direct encryption protocol when the\nencryption box ENC in Y-00 is not chosen properly is demonstrated in a fast\ncorrelation attack by S. Donnet et al in Phys. Lett. A 35, 6 (2006) 406-410. In\nthis paper, we show how this weakness can be eliminated with a proper design of\nENC. In particular, we present a Y-00 configuration that is more secure than\nAES under known-plaintext attack. It is also shown that under any\nciphertext-only attack, full information-theoretic security on the Y-00 seed\nkey is obtained for any ENC when proper deliberate signal randomization is\nemployed.\n"]}
