model, that\nlocal phase noise that is capable of eliminating state coherence only in the\ninfinite-time limit is capable of eliminating nonlocality in finite time in\nthree two-level systems prepared in the Bell-nonlocal tripartite states of the\ngeneric entanglement class.\n", "  Entanglement and non-locality are non-classical global characteristics of\nquantum states important to the foundations of quantum mechanics. Recent\ninvestigations have shown that environmental noise, even when it is entirely\nlocal in influence, can destroy both of these properties in finite time despite\ngiving rise to full quantum state decoherence only in the infinite time limit.\nThese investigations, which have been carried out in a range of theoretical and\nexperimental situations, are reviewed here.\n", "  We demonstrate a fully optical, long-distance remote comparison of\nindependent ultrastable optical frequencies reaching a short term stability\nthat is superior to any reported remote comparison of optical frequencies. We\nuse two ultrastable lasers, which are separated by a geographical distance of\nmore than 50 km, and compare them via a 73 km long phase-stabilized fiber in a\ncommercial telecommunication network. The remote characterization spans more\nthan one optical octave and reaches a fractional frequency instability between\nthe independent ultrastable laser systems of 3e-15 in 0.1 s. The achieved\nperformance at 100 ms represents an improvement by one order of magnitude to\nany previously reported remote comparison of optical frequencies and enables\nfuture remote dissemination of the stability of 100 mHz linewidth lasers within\nseconds.\n", "  Enhanced optical transmission (EOT) through subwavelength apertures is\nusually obtained for p-polarized light. The present study experimentally\ninvestigates EOT for s-polarized light. A subwavelength slit surrounded on each\nside by periodic grooves has been fabricated in a gold film and covered by a\nthin dielectric layer. The excitation of s-polarized dielectric waveguide modes\ninside the dielectric film strongly increases the s-polarized transmission.\nTransmission measurements are compared with a coupled mode model and show good\nqualitative agreement. Adding a waveguide can improve light transmission\nthrough subwavelength apertures, as both s and p-polarization can be\nefficiently transmitted.\n", "  We investigate the physical mechanism for color production by isotropic\nnanostructures with short-range order in bird feather barbs. While the primary\npeak in optical scattering spectra results from constructive interference of\nsingly-scattered light, many species exhibit secondary peaks with distinct\ncharacteristic. Our experimental and numerical studies show that these\nsecondary peaks result from double scattering of light by the correlated\nstructures. Without an analog in periodic or random structures, such a\nphenomenon is unique for short-range ordered structures, and has been widely\nused by nature for non-iridescent structural coloration.\n", "  The key challenge in current research into electromagnetic cloaking is to\nachieve invisibility over an extended bandwidth. There has been significant\nprogress towards this using the idea of cloaking by sweeping under the carpet\nof Li and Pendry, with dielectric structures superposed on a mirror. Here, we\nshow that we can harness surface plasmon polaritons at a metal surface\nstructured with a dielectric material to obtain a unique control of their\npropagation. We exploit this to control plasmonic coupling and demonstrate both\ntheoretically and experimentally cloaking over an unprecedented bandwidth\n(650-900 nm). Our non-resonant plasmonic metamaterial allows a curved reflector\nto mimic a flat mirror. Our theoretical predictions are validated by\nexperiments mapping the surface light intensity at the wavelength 800 nm.\n", "  We here present the results of elliptical flow for the collision of different\nasymmetric nuclei (10Ne20 +13 Al27, 18Ar40 +21 Sc45, 30Zn64 +28 Ni58, 36Kr86\n+41 Nb93) by using the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model. General features\nof elliptical flow are investigated with the help of theoretical simulations.\nThe simulations are performed at different beam energies between 40 and 105\nMeV/nucleon. A significant change can be seen from in-plane to out-of-plane\nelliptical flow of different fragments with incident energy. A comparison with\nexperimental data is also made. Further, we predict, for the first time that,\nelliptical flow for different kind of fragments follow power law dependence ?\nC(Atot)? for asymmetric systems.\n", "  Using the Einstein energy-mass relation and a concept of cross-correlating\nmaterial unit-fields (pp. 1-148), the quantum equation for united gravitation\nand electromagnetism is derived (pp. 148-164). The unified equation yields all\nknown solutions to the Dirac equation, for example, the fine and hyperfine\nstructure of the atom spectrum. Moreover, the model explains physical nature of\nthe spin and anomalous gyromagnetic factor of an electron, as well as the Pauli\nexclusion principle. For weak fields, in the classical limit, the model\nsimplifies to the Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and the so-called\ngravitoelectromagnetic approximation of Einstein's general relativity. In case\nof the strong fields, the unified model yields new predictions compared to the\nEinstein gravity, Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. For\ninstance, the cross-correlation of gravitational and electric potentials\npredicts the \"anti-gravity force\". The \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\" also\nfind natural explanations in the present model. For the unit-fields carrying\nthe gravitational, electric and strong-nuclear \"dressings\", the quantum\nequation and its classical limit for the united gravitational, electromagnetic,\nweak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields and interactions are derived (pp.\n164-183). The cross-correlation of electric and strong-nuclear potentials of\nthe electric and strong-nuclear \"dressings\" explains the physical nature of\nweak-nuclear force. Whereas, the cross-correlation of gravitational and\nstrong-nuclear potentials predicts the new kind of interactions, namely the\ngravito-nuclearstrong force.\n", "  We propose a method for precision statistical control of quantum processes\nbased on superconductor phase qubits. Using the universal quantum tomography\nmethod, we provide a detailed analysis of accuracy of tomography for a 2-qubit\ngate SQiSW, which arises due to capacitive coupling between qubits. The\ndeveloped approach could be successfully applied for quality and efficiency\nproblems of superconductor quantum information technologies.\n", "  We specify the four kinds of rotational cosmologies that are avaliable in\nTheoretical Cosmology. NASA spacecrafts has suffered from three anomalies. The\nPioneers spacecrafts were decelerated, and their spin when not disturbed, was\ndeclining. On the other hand, fly-bys for gravity assists, appeared with extra\nspeeds, relative to infinity. The Pioneers and fly-by anomalies are given now\nexact general relativistic full general solutions, in a rotating expanding\nUniverse.We cite new evidence on the rotation of the Universe. Our solution\nseems to be the only one that solves the three anomalies.\n", "  The induction equation of kinematic magnetohydrodynamics is mathematically\nequivalent to a system of integral equations for the magnetic field in the bulk\nof the fluid and for the electric potential at its boundary. We summarize the\nrecent developments concerning the numerical implementation of this scheme and\nits applications to various forward and inverse problems in dynamo theory and\napplied MHD.\n", "  We demonstrate that by varying the ratio between the linewidth and dispersion\nof a whispering gallery mode resonator we are able to control the number N of\nfree spectral ranges separating the first generated comb sidebands from the\npump. We observed combs with N=19 and N=1. For the comb with N=1 we have\nachieved a span of over 200 nm using a 0.4 mm MgF2 resonator with a pump of 50\nmW, which is a factor of 10 lower than previously reported.\n", "  We consider the non-relativistic superconformal U(N) X U(N) Chern-Simons\ntheory with level (k,-k) possessing fourteen supersymmetries. We obtain an\nexact four-point scattering amplitude of the theory to all orders in 1/N and\n1/k and prove that the scattering amplitude becomes trivial when k=1 and 2. We\nconfirm this amplitude to one-loop order by using an explicit field theoretic\ncomputation and show that the beta function for the contact interaction\nvanishes to the one-loop order, which is consistent with the quantum conformal\ninvariance of the underlying theory.\n", "  We present high precision measurements of polarization rotations in the\nfrequency range from 0.1 to 2.5 THz using a polarization modulation technique.\nA motorized stage rotates a polarizer at ~80 Hz, and the resulting modulation\nof the polarization is measured by a lock-in technique. We achieve an accuracy\nof 0.05{\\deg} (900 {\\mu}rad) and a precision of 0.02{\\deg} (350 {\\mu}rad) for\nsmall rotation angles. A detailed mathematical description of the technique is\npresented, showing its ability to fully characterize elliptical polarizations\nfrom 0.1 to 2.5 THz.\n", "  The random-phase approximation (RPA) as an approach for computing the\nelectronic correlation energy is reviewed. After a brief account of its basic\nconcept and historical development, the paper is devoted to the theoretical\nformulations of RPA, and its applications to realistic systems. With several\nillustrating applications, we discuss the implications of RPA for computational\nchemistry and materials science. The computational cost of RPA is also\naddressed which is critical for its widespread use in future applications. In\naddition, current correction schemes going beyond RPA and directions of further\ndevelopment will be discussed.\n", "  Spicules are intermittently rising above the surface of the Sun eruptions;\nEUV jets are now also reported in immediately above layers. The variation of\nspicule orientation with respect to the solar latitude, presumably reflecting\nthe confinement and the focusing of ejecta by the surrounding global coronal\nmagnetic field, is an important parameter to understand their dynamical\nproperties. A wealth of high resolution images of limb spicules are made\navailable in H CaII emission from the SOT Hinode mission. Furthermore, the\nHough transform is applied to the resulting images for making a statistical\nanalysis of spicule orientations in different regions around the solar limb,\nfrom the pole to the equator. Results show a large difference of spicule\napparent tilt angles in: (i) the solar pole regions, (ii) the equatorial\nregions, (iii) the active regions and (iv) the coronal hole regions. Spicules\nare visible in a radial direction in the polar regions with a tilt angle (less\nthan 200). The tilt angle is even reduced to 10 degrees inside the coronal hole\nwith open magnetic field lines and at the lower latitude the tilt angle reaches\nvalues in excess of 50 degree. Usually, which is in close resemblance to the\nrosettes made of dark mottles and fibrils in projection on the solar disk. The\ninference of these results for explaining the so-called chromospheric\nprolateness observed at solar minimum of activity in cool chromospheric lines\nis considered.\n", "  We report the design of nonreciprocal resonant transmission/reflection using\na one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) adjacent to the magneto-optical (MO)\nmetal film. The nonreciprocal surface modes are found at the interface between\nthe PC and MO metal within the forbidden band of native PC structure. Breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry using external magnetic field gives rise of such unique\nnonreciprocal properties. Quantitatively understanding of nonreciprocal\nresonant optical transmission/reflection behavior is performed using an\neffective admittance-matching theory. With excitation of the nonreciprocal\nsurface modes, light can transmit and be reflected in one-way. Such design\noffers promising potential in realizing the optical diode.\n", "  Energy calibration of superheated droplet detector is discussed in terms of\nthe effective recoil nucleus threshold energy and the reduced superheat. This\nprovides a universal energy calibration curve valid for different liquids used\nin this type of detector. Two widely used liquids, R114 and C4F10, one for\nneutron detection and the other for WIMPs dark matter search experiment, have\nbeen compared. Liquid having recoil nuclei with larger values of LET provides\nbetter neutron and gamma discrimination. Gamma response of C4F10 has also been\nstudied and the results are discussed. Behaviour of nucleation parameter with\nthe effective recoil nucleus threshold energy and the reduced superheat have\nbeen explored.\n", "  We detect electroluminescence in single layer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2)\nfield-effect transistors built on transparent glass substrates. By comparing\nabsorption, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence of the same MoS2 layer,\nwe find that they all involve the same excited state at 1.8eV. The\nelectroluminescence has pronounced threshold behavior and is localized at the\ncontacts. The results show that single layer MoS2, a direct band gap\nsemiconductor, is promising for novel optoelectronic devices, such as\n2-dimensional light detectors and emitters.\n", "  We model the spacetime foam picture by a gas of wormholes in Euclidean field\ntheory. It is shown that at large distances the presence of such a gas leads\nmerely to a renormalization of mass and charge values. We also demonstrate that\nthere exist a class of specific distributions of point-like wormholes which\nessentially change the ultraviolet behavior of Green functions and lead to\nfinite quantum field theories.\n", "  In this paper we study the Kepler problem in the non commutative Snyder\nscenario. We characterize the deformations in the Poisson bracket algebra under\na mimic procedure from quantum standard formulations and taking into account a\ngeneral recipe to build the noncommutative phase space coordinates (in the\nsense of Poisson brackets). We obtain an expression to the deformed potential,\nand then the consequences in the precession of the orbit of Mercury are\ncalculated. This result allows us to find an estimated value for the non\ncommutative deformation parameter introduced.\n", "  We investigate the effect of electric synapses (gap junctions) on collective\nneuronal dynamics and spike statistics in a conductance-based\nIntegrate-and-Fire neural network, driven by a Brownian noise, where\nconductances depend upon spike history. We compute explicitly the time\nevolution operator and show that, given the spike-history of the network and\nthe membrane potentials at a given time, the further dynamical evolution can be\nwritten in a closed form. We show that spike train statistics is described by a\nGibbs distribution whose potential can be approximated with an explicit\nformula, when the noise is weak. This potential form encompasses existing\nmodels for spike trains statistics analysis such as maximum entropy models or\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLM). We also discuss the different types of\ncorrelations: those induced by a shared stimulus and those induced by neurons\ninteractions.\n", "  Polycrystalline YMn1-xFexO3 (YMFO_x) (0 <= x <= 0.1) compounds have been\nprepared in single phase and characterized by synchrotron X-ray diffraction,\nX-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, magnetization, and dielectric\nmeasurements. Iron-substitution in hexagonal YMnO3 causes intra-lattice changes\nexceeding those of the lattice cell. XANES provide mixed-valence Mn3+/Mn4+ and\nFe4+ charge states in these manganites, consistent with the observed decrease\nof the effective magnetic moment with Fe-doping. Magnetization M(T) evidence\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of the specimens with little weak\nferromagnetism, and the metrices of exchange interaction suppress with\nFe-doping, attributed to the lengthening of the Mn-O planar bond lengths.\nDielectric {\\epsilon}'(T) results showing highly doping-dependent anomaly at\nT_N indicate linear magneto-electric coupling.\n", "  Opto-mechanical systems have enabled wide-band optical frequency conversion\nand multi-channel all-optical radio frequency amplification. Realization of an\non-chip silicon communication platform is limited by photodetectors needed to\nconvert optical information to electrical signals for further signal\nprocessing. In this paper we present a coupled silicon micro-resonator, which\nconverts near-IR optical intensity modulation at 174.2MHz and 1.198GHz into\nmotional electrical current. This device emulates a photodetector which detects\nintensity modulation of continuous wave laser light in the\nfull-width-at-half-maximum bandwidth of the mechanical resonance. The resonant\nprinciple of operation eliminates dark current challenges associated with\nconvetional photodetectors.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of the entanglement entropy of a confining gauge\ntheory near cosmological singularities using gauge/gravity duality. As\nexpected, the coefficients of the UV divergent terms are given by simple\ngeometric properties of the entangling surface in the time-dependent\nbackground. The finite (universal) part of the entanglement entropy either\ngrows without bound or remains bounded depending on the nature of the\nsingularity and entangling region. We also discuss a confinement/deconfinement\nphase transition as signaled by the entanglement entropy.\n", "  All-reflective interferometer configurations have been proposed for the next\ngeneration of gravitational wave detectors, with diffractive elements replacing\ntransmissive optics. However, an additional phase noise creates more stringent\nconditions for alignment stability. A framework for alignment stability with\nthe use of diffractive elements was required using a Gaussian model. We\nsuccessfully create such a framework involving modal decomposition to replicate\nsmall displacements of the beam (or grating) and show that the modal model does\nnot contain the phase changes seen in an otherwise geometric planewave\napproach. The modal decomposition description is justified by verifying\nexperimentally that the phase of a diffracted Gaussian beam is independent of\nthe beam shape, achieved by comparing the phase change between a zero-order and\nfirst-order mode beam. To interpret our findings we employ a rigorous\ntime-domain simulation to demonstrate that the phase changes resulting from a\nmodal decomposition are correct, provided that the coordinate system which\nmeasures the phase is moved simultaneously with the effective beam\ndisplacement. This indeed corresponds to the phase change observed in the\ngeometric planewave model. The change in the coordinate system does not\ninstinctively occur within the analytical framework, and therefore requires\neither a manual change in the coordinate system or an addition of the geometric\nplanewave phase factor.\n", "  The generation of few-cycle pulses with controlled waveforms in the\nmid-infrared spectral region is a long-standing challenge but is expected to\nenable a new generation of high-field physics experiments, uncovering intricate\nphysical phenomena. Successful generation of such optical pulses is limited by\nthe tremendous spectral width required to withstand few-cycle pulses in the\nmid-IR correlated with the need to tightly control the spectral phase over such\na broad bandwidth. Here, we present the first demonstration of sub-three cycle\noptical pulses at 3.1 \\mu m central wavelength using for the first time\nself-compression in the anomalous dispersion regime in bulk material. The\npulses emerging from this compact and efficient self-compression setup could be\nfocused to intensities exceeding 100 TW/cm^2, a suitable range for high field\nphysics experiments. Our experimental findings are corroborated by numerical\nsimulations using a 3D nonlinear propagation code, therefore providing\ntheoretical insight on the processes involved.\n", "  We suggest a modification of a comb model to describe anomalous transport in\nspiny dendrites. Geometry of the comb structure consisting of a one-dimensional\nbackbone and lateral branches makes it possible to describe anomalous\ndiffusion, where dynamics inside fingers corresponds to spines, while the\nbackbone describes diffusion along dendrites. The presented analysis\nestablishes that the fractional dynamics in spiny dendrites is controlled by\nfractal geometry of the comb structure and fractional kinetics inside the\nspines. Our results show that the transport along spiny dendrites is\nsubdiffusive and depends on the density of spines in agreement with recent\nexperiments.\n", "  In contrast to the case of quasi-monochromatic waves, a focused optical pulse\nin the few-cycle limit may exhibit two independent curved wavefronts,\nassociated with phase and group retardations, respectively. Focusing optical\nelements will generally affect these two wavefronts differently, thus leading\nto very different behavior of the pulse near focus. As limiting cases, we\nconsider an ideal diffractive lens introducing only phase retardations and a\nperfect non-dispersive refractive lens (or a curved mirror) introducing equal\nphase and group retardations. We study the resulting diffraction effects on the\npulse, finding both strong deformations of the pulse shape and shifts in the\nspectrum. We then show how important these effects can be in highly nonlinear\noptics, by studying their role in attosecond pulse generation. In particular,\nthe focusing effects are found to affect substantially the generation of\nisolated attosecond pulses in gases from few-cycle fundamental optical fields.\n", "  The search for antideuterons in cosmic rays has been proposed as a promising\nchannel for dark matter indirect detection, especially for dark matter\nparticles with a low or intermediate mass. With the current operational phase\nof the AMS-02 experiment and the ongoing development of a future dedicated\nexperiment, the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), there are exciting\nprospects for a dark matter detection in the near future. In this paper we\ndevelop a detailed and complete re-analysis of the cosmic-ray antideuteron\nsignal, by discussing the main relevant issues related to antideuteron\nproduction and propagation through the interstellar medium and the heliosphere.\nIn particular, we first critically revisit the coalescence mechanism for\nantideuteron production in dark matter annihilation processes. Then, since\nantideuteron searches have their best prospects of detection at low kinetic\nenergies where the effect of the solar wind and magnetic field are most\nrelevant, we address the impact of solar modulation modeling on the\nantideuteron flux at the Earth by developing a full numerical 4D solution of\ncosmic rays transport in the heliosphere. We finally use these improved\npredictions to provide updated estimates of the reaching capabilities for\nAMS-02 and GAPS, compatible with the current constraints imposed by the\nantiprotons measurements of PAMELA. After the antiproton bound is applied,\nprospects of detection of up to about 15 events in GAPS LDB+ and AMS-02\nmissions are found, depending on the dark matter mass, annihilation rate and\nproduction channel from one side, and on the coalescence process, galactic and\nsolar transport parameters on the other.\n", "  We implement an entanglement distribution network based on\nwavelength-multiplexing and optical switching for quantum communication\napplications. Using a high-brightness source based on spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion in periodically-poled lithium niobate waveguides, we generate\npolarisation entangled photon pairs with a broad spectrum covering the telecom\nwavelengths around 1550nm. The photon pairs have entanglement fidelities up to\n99%, and are distributed via passive wavelength multiplexing in a static\nmulti-user network. We furthermore demonstrate a possible network application\nin a scenario with a single centralised source dynamically allocating two-party\nentanglement to any pair of users by means of optical switches. The whole\nsystem, from the pump laser up to the receivers, is fibre and waveguide based,\nresulting in maximal stability, minimal losses and the advantage of readily\nintegrable telecom components in the 1550nm range.\n", "  Recent years have seen increased interest to plasmonic enhancement of\nnonlinear optical effects, yet there remains an uncertainty of what are the\nlimits of this enhancement. We present a simple and physically transparent\ntheory of plasmonic enhancement of third order nonlinear optical processes\nachieved in plasmonic structures and show that while huge enhancement of\neffective nonlinear index can be attained, the most relevant figure of merit,\nthe of phase shift per one absorption length remains very low. This means that\nwhile on one hand nonlinear plasmonic materials are not well suitable for\napplications requiring high efficiency, e.g. all-optical switching and\nwavelength conversion, on the other hand they can be very useful for the\napplications where the overall high efficiency is not a must, such as sensing.\n", "  We report a versatile and cost-effective way of controlling the unsaturated\nloss, modulation depth and saturation fluence of graphene-based saturable\nabsorbers (GSAs), by changing the thickness of a spacer between SLG and a\nhigh-reflection mirror. This allows us to modulate the electric field intensity\nenhancement at the GSA from 0 up to 400%, due to the interference of incident\nand reflected light at the mirror. The unsaturated loss of the\nSLG-mirror-assembly can be reduced to$\\sim$0. We use this to mode-lock a VECSEL\nfrom 935 to 981nm. This approach can be applied to integrate SLG into various\noptical components, such as output coupler mirrors, dispersive mirrors,\ndielectric coatings on gain materials. Conversely, it can also be used to\nincrease absorption (up to 10%) in various graphene based photonics and\noptoelectronics devices, such as photodetectors.\n", "  We investigate beam pointing dynamics in filamentation in gases driven by\nhigh repetition rate femtosecond laser pulses. Upon suddenly exposing a gas to\na kilohertz train of filamenting pulses, the filament is steered from its\noriginal direction to a new stable direction whose equilibrium is determined by\na balance among buoyant, viscous, and diffusive processes in the gas. Results\nare shown for Xe and air, but are broadly applicable to all configurations\nemploying high repetition rate femtosecond laser propagation in gases.\n", "  Analyzing large sparse electrical networks is a fundamental task in physics,\nelectrical engineering and computer science. We propose two classes of quantum\nalgorithms for this task. The first class is based on solving linear systems,\nand the second class is based on using quantum walks. These algorithms compute\nvarious electrical quantities, including voltages, currents, dissipated powers\nand effective resistances, in time $\\operatorname{poly}(d, c,\n\\operatorname{log}(N), 1/\\lambda, 1/\\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the number of\nvertices in the network, $d$ is the maximum unweighted degree of the vertices,\n$c$ is the ratio of largest to smallest edge resistance, $\\lambda$ is the\nspectral gap of the normalized Laplacian of the network, and $\\epsilon$ is the\naccuracy. Furthermore, we show that the polynomial dependence on $1/\\lambda$ is\nnecessary. This implies that our algorithms are optimal up to polynomial\nfactors and cannot be significantly improved.\n", "  Magnetic structure evolution of multiferroic hexagonal $YMn_{1-x}Fe_{x}O_{3}$\n(${x} = 0, 0.05,$ and $0.1$) has been studied by carrying out detailed\ntemperature-dependent neutron diffraction at zero- and 5T-fields. Thermodynamic\ndata confirm antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_{N}$ in all the compositions. Our\nsub-$T_{N}$ neutron diffraction results assign the magnetic structure of pure\n$YMnO_3$ to $\\Gamma_{1}$ irreducible representation. Over the\nperturbative-doping range, the magnetic configuration changes via\n$\\Gamma_{1}+\\Gamma_{2}$ for $YMn_{0.95}Fe_{0.05}O_{3}$ on to $\\Gamma_{2}$ for\n$YMn_{0.9}Fe_{0.1}O_{3}$, as the maiden compositional analogue of\nspin-reorientation; its occurrence in temperature-domain already reported for\nseveral manganites. Moreover, while the large thermal isostructural changes\nobserved above ${T}_{N}$ are subdued in the ordered state, small alterations by\nthe applied 5T-field are relatively uniform across, confirming strong\nmagneto-elastic nature of the system. Decrease of the ordered magnetic moment\n($\\mu_{ord}$) and planar magnetic frustration noted with Fe-doping is enhanced\nby the applied field, apparently through canting.\n", "  A linear-response method to calculate the effective Coulomb interaction ($U$)\nbetween closed-shell localized electrons is suggested and applied to the $3d$\nclosed-shell systems (Cu, Zn, and ZnO) based on plane-wave basis\ndensity-functional theory calculations. Since the closed-shell localized states\nare far below the Fermi level, large local perturbation potential ($\\alpha$)\nprojected to the localized states is applied to induce purposeful density\nresponse ($\\Delta n$). From the $\\alpha$, the perturbation potential cost for\ndensity response onset, by which the $\\Delta n$ begins to be induced, is\nremoved. The main screening channel for the effective Coulomb interaction is\nthe itinerant electrons deoccupied from the perturbed localized states. The Cu,\nZn, and ZnO $3d$ electron binding energies are calculated based on the local\ndensity approximation plus $U$ with the $U$ values calculated from the\nlinear-response, which are found to be in good agreement with experiments.\n", "  Magnetic and dielectric studies of SrCu3Ti4O12 carried out over 5-300K\nconfirm antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Cu-spins at TN =23K. Dielectric\nconstant {\\epsilon}' measured across 1Hz-1MHz signifies quantum paraelectric\ncharacter, Barrett-fittable almost down to TN. Competition of athermal\nfluctuations and the literature-reported magneto-phonon-softening near TN\nmanifests a maiden quantum paraelectric glass (QPG) state. Emergent AFM-field\ntunes the otherwise quantum ordering (at absolute-zero) of the dipoles to\nfinite-temperature kinetic glass transition; spectral dispersion of dielectric\nconstant unambiguously manifested and characterized. Vogel-Fulcher\nglass-kinetics parameterization sets the almost relaxation-free QPG state in\nSrCu3Ti4O12 apart from an emergent scaling-class, to which typical\nferroelectric relaxors belong.\n", "  We provide formulas to compute the coefficients entering the affine scaling\nneeded to get a non-degenerate function for the asymptotic distribution of the\nmaxima of some kind of observable computed along the orbit of a randomly\nperturbed dynamical system. This will give information on the local geometrical\nproperties of the stationary measure. We will consider systems perturbed with\nadditive noise and with observational noise. Moreover we will apply our\ntechniques to chaotic systems and to contractive systems, showing that both\nshare the same qualitative behavior when perturbed.\n", "  Nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond have emerged as highly\nversatile optical emitters that exhibit room temperature spin properties. These\ncharacteristics make NV centers ideal for magnetometry, which plays an\nimportant role in chemical and biological sensing applications. The integration\nof NV magnetometers with microfluidic systems could enable the study of\nisolated chemical and biological samples in a fluid environment with high\nspatial resolution. Here we demonstrate a method to perform localized\nmagnetometry with nanometer spatial precision using a single NV center in a\nmicrofluidic device. We manipulate a magnetic particle within a liquid\nenvironment using a combination of planar microfluidic flow control and\nvertical magnetic actuation to achieve 3-dimensional manipulation. A diamond\nnanocrystal containing a single NV center is deposited in the microfluidic\nchannels and acts as a local magnetic field probe. We map out the magnetic\nfield distribution of the magnetic particle by varying its position relative to\nthe diamond nanocrystal and performing optically resolved electron spin\nresonance (ESR) measurements. We control the magnetic particle position with a\n48 nm precision and attain a magnetic field sensitivity of 17.5\nmicroTesla/Hz^1/2. These results open up the possibility for studying local\nmagnetic properties of biological and chemical systems with high sensitivity in\nan integrated microfluidic platform.\n", "  Planet--planet scattering is a major dynamical mechanism able to\nsignificantly alter the architecture of a planetary system. In addition to\nthat, it may also affect the formation and retention of a debris disk by the\nsystem. A violent chaotic evolution of the planets can easily clear leftover\nplanetesimal belts preventing the ignition of a substantial collisional cascade\nthat can give origin to a debris disk. On the other end, a mild evolution with\nlimited steps in eccentricity and semimajor axis can trigger the formation of a\ndebris disk by stirring an initially quiet planetesimal belt. The variety of\npossible effects that planet--planet scattering can have on the formation of\ndebris disks is analysed and the statistical probability of the different\noutcomes is evaluated. This leads to the prediction that systems which\nunderwent an episode of chaotic evolution might have a lower probability of\nharboring a debris disk.\n", "  Extreme events can come either from point processes, when the size or energy\nof the events is above a certain threshold, or from time series, when the\nintensity of a signal surpasses a threshold value. We are particularly\nconcerned by the time between these extreme events, called respectively waiting\ntime and quiet time. If the thresholds are high enough it is possible to\njustify the existence of scaling laws for the probability distribution of the\ntimes as a function of the threshold value, although the scaling functions are\ndifferent in each case. For point processes, in addition to the trivial Poisson\nprocess, one can obtain double-power-law distributions with no finite mean\nvalue. This is justified in the context of renormalization-group\ntransformations, where such distributions arise as limiting distributions after\niterations of the transformation. Clear connections with the generalized\ncentral limit theorem are established from here. The non-existence of finite\nmoments leads to a semi-parametric scaling law in terms of the sample mean\nwaiting time, in which the (usually unkown) scale parameter is eliminated but\nnot the exponents. In the case of time series, scaling can arise by considering\nrandom-walk-like signals with absorbing boundaries, resulting in distributions\nwith a power-law \"bulk\" and a faster decay for long times. For large thresholds\nthe moments of the quiet-time distribution show a power-law dependence with the\nscale parameter, and isolation of the latter and of the exponents leads to a\nnon-parametric scaling law in terms only of the moments of the distribution.\nConclusions about the projections of changes in the occurrence of natural\nhazards lead to the necessity of distinguishing the behavior of the mean of the\ndistribution with the behavior of the extreme events.\n", "  We prospect magneto-dielectricity in $La_{0.53}Ca_{0.47}MnO_{3}$ across its\nparamagnetic (PMI) to ferromagnetic (FMM) isostructural transition at $T_{C}\n\\sim 253K$, by magnetic ($(M)$), caloric ($(W)$), dielectric ($(\\epsilon')$),\nmagneto-resistive (MR), and magneto-capacitance (MC) investigations.\nSkew-broadened first-order transition character is confirmed via\nheating/cooling hystereses in $(M)(T)$ and $(W)(T)$, with superheating\ntemperature $T**$ almost next to $T_C$ and supercooling temperature $T*$\nexhibiting kinetics. Above $T_C$, linearly-related MC and MR reflect purely\nmagneto-resistance effect. Near $T_C$, the high-frequency MC(5T) much exceeds\nthe magneto-losses, and is uncorrelated with dc MR(5T) in the FM-ordered state.\nThe intrinsic magneto-dielectricity manifest below $T_C$ and above ~kHz is\ntraced to an intra-granular Maxwell-Wagner-type effect at the interface-region\nof PMI-FMM phase-coexistence.\n", "  A source of ultrashort pulses of light in the 2 {\\mu}m region was constructed\nusing supercontinuum broadening from an erbium mode-locked laser. The output\nspectrum spanned 1000 nm to 2200 nm with an average power of 250 mW. A pulse\nwidth of 39 fs for part of the spectrum in the 2000 nm region, corresponding to\nless than six optical cycles, was achieved. A heterodyne measurement of the\nfree-running mode-locked laser with a narrow-linewidth continuous wave laser\nresulted in a near shot noise-limited beat note with a signal-to-noise ratio of\n45 dB in a 10 kHz resolution bandwidth. The relative intensity noise of the\nbroadband system was investigated over the entire supercontinuum, and the\nintegrated relative intensity noise of the 2000 nm portion of the spectrum was\n0.0017. The long-term stability of the system was characterized, and intensity\nfluctuations in the spectrum were found to be highly correlated throughout the\nsupercontinuum. Spectroscopic limitations due to the laser noise\ncharacteristics are discussed.\n", "  The paper presents bifurcation behavior of a single phase induction motor.\nThis paper also attempts to discuss the bifurcation behavior of the system\nbased on the evolution of different state variables. The bifurcation diagrams\ndrawn looking at different state variables are different in terms of\nperiodicity and route to chaos. The knowledge of the dynamics of the system\nobtained from bifurcation diagrams give useful guidelines to control the\noperation of the induction motor depending on the need of an application for\nbetter performance.\n", "  Ultrathin metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising materials to enable\nnovel, flat optical components and surface-confined, miniature photonic\ndevices. However, experimental realization of high-performance metasurfaces at\nvisible frequencies has been a significant challenge due to high plasmonic\nlosses and difficulties in high-uniformity nanofabrication. Here, we propose a\nhighly-efficient yet simple metasurface design comprising of single gradient\nantenna as unit cell. We demonstrate visible broadband (450 - 850 nm) anomalous\nreflection and spectrum splitting with 85% conversion efficiency. Average power\nratio of anomalous reflection to the strongest diffraction was calculated to be\n~ 103 and measured to be ~ 10. The anomalous reflected photons and spectrum\nsplitting performance have been visualized using CCD and characterized using\nangle-resolved measurement setup. Metasurface design proposed here is a clear\ndeparture from conventional metasurfaces utilizing multiple, anisotropic\nresonators, and could enable high-efficiency, broadband metasurfaces for\nachieving directional emitters, polarization/spectrum splitting surfaces for\nspectroscopy and photovoltaics.\n", "  That the speed of light in free space is constant is a cornerstone of modern\nphysics. However, light beams have finite transverse size, which leads to a\nmodification of their wavevectors resulting in a change to their phase and\ngroup velocities. We study the group velocity of single photons by measuring a\nchange in their arrival time that results from changing the beam's transverse\nspatial structure. Using time-correlated photon pairs we show a reduction of\nthe group velocity of photons in both a Bessel beam and photons in a focused\nGaussian beam. In both cases, the delay is several microns over a propagation\ndistance of the order of 1 m. Our work highlights that, even in free space, the\ninvariance of the speed of light only applies to plane waves. Introducing\nspatial structure to an optical beam, even for a single photon, reduces the\ngroup velocity of the light by a readily measurable amount.\n", "  Given a six-dimensional symplectic manifold $(M, B)$, a nondegenerate,\nco-closed four-form $C$ introduces a dual symplectic structure $\\widetilde{B} =\n*C $ independent of $B$ via the Hodge duality $*$. We show that the doubling of\nsymplectic structures due to the Hodge duality results in two independent\nclasses of noncommutative U(1) gauge fields by considering the Seiberg-Witten\nmap for each symplectic structure. As a result, emergent gravity suggests a\nbeautiful picture that the variety of six-dimensional manifolds emergent from\nnoncommutative U(1) gauge fields is doubled. In particular, the doubling for\nthe variety of emergent Calabi-Yau manifolds allows us to arrange a pair of\nCalabi-Yau manifolds such that they are mirror to each other. Therefore, we\nargue that the mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau manifolds is the Hodge theory for\nthe deformation of symplectic and dual symplectic structures.\n", "  A central challenge in developing magnetically coupled quantum registers in\ndiamond is the fabrication of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers with localization\nbelow ~20 nm to enable fast dipolar interaction compared to the NV decoherence\nrate. Here, we demonstrate the targeted, high throughput formation of NV\ncenters using masks with a thickness of 270 nm and feature sizes down to ~1 nm.\nSuper-resolution imaging resolves NVs with a full-width maximum distribution of\n$26\\pm7$ nm and a distribution of NV-NV separations of $16\\pm5$ nm.\n", "  A decade ago brief summary of the field could be formulated as a discovery of\nstrongly-coupled Quark-Gluon-Plasma, sQGP, making a very good liquid with\nsurprisingly small viscosity. Since 2010 we have LHC program, which added a lot\nto our understanding, and now there seems to be a need to consolidate what we\nlearned and formulate a list of issues to be studied next. Hydrodynamical\nperturbations, leading to higher harmonics of angular correlations, are\nidentified as long-lived sound waves. Recently studied reactions involving\nsounds include phonon decays into two (\"loop viscosity\"), phonon+magnetic field\ninto photons/dileptons (sono-magneto-luminescence), and two phonons into a\ngravity wave, a penetrating probe of the Big Bang. The mainstream issues in the\nfield now include a quest to study transition between $pp,pA$ and heavy ion\n$AA$ collisions, with an aim to locate \"the smallest drops\" of the sQGP\ndisplaying collective/hydrodynamics behavior. The issues related to\nout-of-equilibrium stage of the collisions, and mechanisms of the\nequilibration, in weak and strong coupling, are also hotly debated.\n", "  We further explore the quantum dynamics near past cosmological singularities\nin anisotropic Kasner-AdS solutions using gauge/gravity duality. The dual\ndescription of the bulk evolution involves N=4 super Yang-Mills on the\ncontracting branch of an anisotropic de Sitter space and is well defined. We\ncompute two-point correlators of Yang-Mills operators of large dimensions using\nspacelike geodesics anchored on the boundary. The correlator between two points\nseparated in a direction with negative Kasner exponent p always exhibits a pole\nat horizon scales, in any dimension, which we interpret as a dual signature of\nthe classical bulk singularity. We find evidence that the pole is absent at\nfinite coupling in the dual field theory, indicating the singularity is\nresolved.\n", "  We report an exact map into one dimensional effective chains, of the\ntight-binding Hamiltonian for electrons in armchair and zigzag graphene\nnanoribbons with any uniaxial ripple. This mapping is used for studying the\neffect of uniaxial periodic ripples, taking into account the relative\norientation changes between $\\pi$ orbitals. Such effects are important for\nshort wavelength ripples, while for long-wave ones, the system behaves nearly\nas strained graphene. The spectrum has a complex nature, akin to the Hofstadter\nbutterfly with a rich localization behavior. Gaps at the Fermi level and\ndispersionless bands were observed, as well. The complex features of the\nspectrum arise as a consequence of the quasiperiodic or periodic nature of the\neffective one dimensional system. Some features of these systems are\nunderstandable by considering weakly coupled dimers. The eigenenergies of such\ndimers are highly degenerated and the net effect of the ripple can be seen as a\nperturbation potential that splits the energy spectrum. Several particular\ncases were analytically solved to understand such feature.\n", "  We report on the algorithms and numerical methods used in Viriato, a novel\nfluid-kinetic code that solves two distinct sets of equations: (i) the Kinetic\nReduced Electron Heating Model (KREHM) equations [Zocco & Schekochihin, Phys.\nPlasmas 18, 102309 (2011)] (which reduce to the standard Reduced-MHD equations\nin the appropriate limit) and (ii) the kinetic reduced MHD (KRMHD) equations\n[Schekochihin et al., Astrophys. J. Suppl. 182:310 (2009)]. Two main\napplications of these equations are magnetised (Alfvenic) plasma turbulence and\nmagnetic reconnection. Viriato uses operator splitting (Strang or Godunov) to\nseparate the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field\n(assumed strong). Along the magnetic field, Viriato allows for either a\nsecond-order accurate MacCormack method or, for higher accuracy, a\nspectral-like scheme composed of the combination of a total variation\ndiminishing (TVD) third order Runge-Kutta method for the time derivative with a\n7th order upwind scheme for the fluxes. Perpendicular to the field Viriato is\npseudo-spectral, and the time integration is performed by means of an iterative\npredictor-corrector scheme. In addition, a distinctive feature of Viriato is\nits spectral representation of the parallel velocity-space dependence, achieved\nby means of a Hermite representation of the perturbed distribution function. A\nseries of linear and nonlinear benchmarks and tests are presented, including a\ndetailed analysis of 2D and 3D Orszag-Tang-type decaying turbulence, both in\nfluid and kinetic regimes.\n", "  The shape of a polymer plays an important role in determining its\ninteractions with other molecules and with the environment, and is in turn\naffected by both of them. As a consequence, in the literature the shape\nproperties of a chain in many different conditions have been investigated.\nHere, we characterize the shape and orientational properties of a polymer chain\nunder tension, a physical condition typically realized both in single-molecule\nexperiments and in vivo. By means of analytical calculations and Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we develop a theoretical framework which quantitatively describes\nthese properties, highlighting the interplay between external force and chain\nsize in determining the spatial distribution of a stretched chain.\n", "  Models for tidal disruption events (TDEs) in which a supermassive black hole\ndisrupts a star commonly assume that the highly eccentric streams of bound\nstellar debris promptly form a circular accretion disk at the pericenter scale.\nHowever, recent numerical simulations (Shiokawa et al., 2015) demonstrated that\ndissipation via hydrodynamical shocks is insufficient to circularize debris,\nand the flow retains its initial semi-major axis scale throughout the first ~10\norbits of the event. The bolometric peak luminosity of most TDE candidates, a\nfew x 10^{44} erg/s, implies that we observe only ~1% of the energy expected\nfrom radiatively efficient accretion. Motivated by these results, (Piran et\nal., 2015) suggested that the observed optical TDE emission is powered by\nshocks at the apocenter between freshly infalling material and earlier arriving\nmatter. This model explains the small radiated energy, the low temperature, and\nthe large radius implied by the observations as well as the t^{-5/3} light\ncurve. However the question of the system's low {bolometric} efficiency remains\nunanswered. We suggest that the high orbital energy and low angular momentum of\nthe flow make it possible for magnetic stresses to reduce the matter's already\nsmall angular momentum to the point at which it can fall ballistically into the\nSMBH before circularization. As a result, the efficiency is only ~1--10% of a\nstandard accretion disk's efficiency. Thus, the intrinsically high eccentricity\nof the tidal debris naturally explains why most TDE candidates are fainter than\nexpected.\n", "  Transitions between steady dynamical regimes in diverse applications are\noften modelled using discontinuities, but doing so introduces problems of\nuniqueness. No matter how quickly a transition occurs, its inner workings can\naffect the dynamics of the system significantly. Here we discuss the way\ntransitions can be reduced to discontinuities without trivializing them, by\npreserving so-called hidden terms. We review the fundamental methodology, its\nmotivations, and where their study seems to be heading. We derive a prototype\nfor piecewise smooth models from the asymptotics of systems with rapid\ntransitions, sharpening Filippov's convex combinations by encoding the tails of\nasymptotic series into nonlinear dependence on a switching parameter. We\npresent a few examples that illustrate the impact of these on our standard\npicture of smooth or only piecewise smooth dynamics.\n", "  A quantum theory in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space can be geometrically\nformulated as a proper Hamiltonian theory as explained in [2, 3, 7, 8]. From\nthis point of view a quantum system can be described in a classical-like\nframework where quantum dynamics is represented by a Hamiltonian flow in the\nphase space given by projective Hilbert space. This paper is devoted to\ninvestigate how the notion of accessibility algebra from classical control\ntheory can be applied within geometric Hamiltonian formulation of Quanum\nMechanics to study controllability of a quantum system. A new characterization\nof quantum controllability in terms of Killing vector fields w.r.t.\nFubini-Study metric on projective space is also discussed.\n", "  We describe holographic thermal quenches that are inhomogeneous in space. The\nmain characteristic of the quench is to take the system far from its\nequilibrium configuration. Except special extreme cases, the problem has no\nanalytic solution. Using the numerical holography methods, we study different\nobservables that measure thermalization such as the time evolution of the\napparent horizon, two-point Wightman function and entanglement entropy (EE).\nHaving an extra nontrivial spacial direction, allows us to study this peculiar\ngeneralization since we categorize the problem based on whether we do the\nmeasurements along this special direction or perpendicular to it. Exciting new\nfeatures appear that are absent in the common computations in the literature;\nthe appearance of negative EE valleys surrounding the positive EE hills and\nabrupt quenches that occupy the whole space at their universal limit are some\nof the results of this paper. Physical explanation is given and connections to\nthe Cardy's idea of thermalization are discussed.\n", "  Single-photons are key elements of many future quantum technologies, be it\nfor the realisation of large-scale quantum communication networks for quantum\nsimulation of chemical and physical processes or for connecting quantum\nmemories in a quantum computer. Scaling quantum technologies will thus require\nefficient, on-demand, sources of highly indistinguishable single-photons.\nSemiconductor quantum dots inserted in photonic structures are ultrabright\nsingle photon sources, but the photon indistinguishability is limited by charge\nnoise induced by nearby surfaces. The current state of the art for\nindistinguishability are parametric down conversion single-photon sources, but\nthey intrinsically generate multiphoton events and hence must be operated at\nvery low brightness to maintain high single photon purity. To date, no\ntechnology has proven to be capable of providing a source that simultaneously\ngenerates near-unity indistinguishability and pure single photons with high\nbrightness. Here, we report on such devices made of quantum dots in\nelectrically controlled cavity structures. We demonstrate on-demand, bright and\nultra-pure single photon generation. Application of an electrical bias on\ndeterministically fabricated devices is shown to fully cancel charge noise\neffects. Under resonant excitation, an indistinguishability of\n$0.9956\\pm0.0045$ is evidenced with a $g^{2}(0)=0.0028\\pm0.0012$. The photon\nextraction of $65%$ and measured brightness of $0.154\\pm0.015$ make this source\n$20$ times brighter than any source of equal quality. This new generation of\nsources open the way to a new level of complexity and scalability in optical\nquantum manipulation.\n", "  The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its higher dimensional generalizations by\nOshikawa and Hastings require that translationally invariant 2D spin systems\nwith a half-integer spin per unit cell must either have a continuum of low\nenergy excitations, spontaneously break some symmetries, or exhibit topological\norder with anyonic excitations. We establish a connection between these\nconstraints and a remarkably similar set of constraints at the surface of a 3D\ninteracting topological insulator. This, combined with recent work on\nsymmetry-enriched topological phases (SETs) with on-site unitary symmetries,\nenables us to develop a framework for understanding the structure of SETs with\nboth translational and on-site unitary symmetries, including the effective\ntheory of symmetry defects. This framework places stringent constraints on the\npossible types of symmetry fractionalization that can occur in 2D systems whose\nunit cell contains fractional spin, fractional charge, or a projective\nrepresentation of the symmetry group. As a concrete application, we determine\nwhen a topological phase must possess a \"spinon\" excitation, even in cases when\nspin rotational invariance is broken down to a discrete subgroup by the crystal\nstructure. We also describe the phenomena of \"anyonic spin-orbit coupling\",\nwhich may arise from the interplay of translational and on-site symmetries.\nThese include the possibility of on-site symmetry defect branch lines carrying\ntopological charge per unit length and lattice dislocations inducing on-site\nsymmetry protected degeneracies.\n", "  Abner Shimony was an exceptional human being and a remarkably lucid and\npenetrating thinker whose work centered on some of the most significant\nphysical and philosophical questions of his era at their nexus. He approached\nthese questions with an open, agile and critical mind, something quickly\nevident to anyone who had the privilege of conversing with him. His choice of\nproblems to pursue, which for the most part involved epistemology and the\nrelationships between mind, matter and space-time, was visionary. Undoubtedly,\nmost of the discussions of Abner Shimony's work in future will center on his\nenormous contribution to the investigation of the significance to physics, both\ntheoretical and experimental, of quantum entanglement, the characteristic of\nphysical entities on which his work came to concentrate, well represented in\nthe Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt inequality. Also significant for physics is\nhis pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the\nearly-to-mid 1990s. Shimony focused largely on the question of the relationship\nbetween knowledge and the world, as he did not view these two philosophical\nconcerns as distinct from study of the implications of entanglement per se.\nIndeed, the most well known phrase he coined is \"experimental metaphysics.\" He\nis also known for the reapplication of the expression \"peaceful coexistence\" as\npertaining to the relationship between quantum mechanics and special\nrelativity. Shimony's less well known intellectual engagement was with the\nquestion of the relationship between mind and matter, which only a few\nphysicists of our time have engaged seriously, likely because of its more\nphilosophical and less mathematically tractable character. This appreciation\nreflects all these aspects of Abner Shimony's long and successful intellectual\ncareer, in addition to details of his education, including mention of some of\nhis teachers.\n", "  We discuss the possibility that the cold dark matter mass profiles contain\ninformation on the cosmological constant, and that such information constrains\nthe nature of cold dark matter (CDM). We call this approach Modified Dark\nMatter (MDM). In particular, we examine the ability of MDM to explain the\nobserved mass profiles of 13 galaxy clusters. Using general arguments from\ngravitational thermodynamics, we provide a theoretical justification for our\nMDM mass profile and successfully compare it to the NFW mass profiles both on\ncluster and galactic scales. Our results suggest that indeed the CDM mass\nprofiles contain information about the cosmological constant in a non-trivial\nway.\n", "  We explore strategies to extract cosmological constraints from a joint\nanalysis of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy clustering, cluster\nnumber counts and cluster weak lensing. We utilize the CosmoLike software to\nsimulate results from an LSST like data set, specifically, we 1) compare\nindividual and joint analyses of the different probes, 2) vary the selection\ncriteria for lens and source galaxies, 3) investigate the impact of blending,\n4) investigate the impact of the assumed cosmological model in multi-probe\ncovariances, 6) quantify information content as a function of scales, and 7)\nexplore the impact of intrinsic galaxy alignment in a multi-probe context. Our\nanalyses account for all cross correlations within and across probes and\ninclude the higher-order (non-Gaussian) terms in the multi-probe covariance\nmatrix. We simultaneously model cosmological parameters and a variety of\nsystematics, e.g. uncertainties arising from shear and photo-z calibration,\ncluster mass-observable relation, galaxy intrinsic alignment, and galaxy bias\n(up to 54 parameters altogether). We highlight two results: First, increasing\nthe number density of source galaxies by ~30%, which corresponds to solving\nblending for LSST, only gains little information. Second, including small\nscales in clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing, by utilizing HODs, can\nsubstantially boost cosmological constraining power. The CosmoLike modules used\nto compute the results in this paper will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/elikrause/CosmoLike_Forecasts.\n", "  A Lagrangian formulation of perfect fluid due to a noncanonical three-form\nfield is investigated. The thermodynamic quantities such as energy density,\npressure and the four velocity are obtained and then analyzed by comparing with\nthe k-essence scalar field. The nonrelativistic matter due to the generalized\nthree-form field with the equation of state parameter being zero is realized\nwhile it might not be possible for the k-essence scalar field. We also found\nthat nonadiabatic pressure perturbations can be possibly generated. The fluid\ndynamics of the perfect fluid due to the three-form field corresponds to the\nsystem in which the number of particles is not conserved. We argue that it is\ninteresting to use this three-form field to represent the dark matter for the\nclassical interaction theory between dark matter and dark energy.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the best-quality multi-wavelength data\ngathered for the large-scale jet in the core-dominated quasar 3C 273. We\nanalyze all the archival observations of the target with the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory, the far-ultraviolet observations with the Hubble Space Telescope,\nand the 8.4 GHz map obtained with the Very Large Array. In our study we focus\non investigating the morphology of the outflow at different frequencies, and\ntherefore we apply various techniques for the image deconvolution, paying\nparticular attention to a precise modeling of the Chandra and Hubble point\nspread functions. We find that the prominent brightness enhancements in the\nX-ray and far-ultraviolet jet of 3C 273 - the \"knots\" - are not point-like, and\ncan be resolved transversely as extended features with sizes of about $\\simeq\n0.5$ kpc. Also, the radio outflow is wider than the deconvolved\nX-ray/ultraviolet jet. We have also found circumstantial evidence that the\nintensity peaks of the X-ray knots are located systematically upstream of the\ncorresponding radio intensity peaks, with the projected spatial offsets along\nthe jet ranging from $\\lesssim 0.2$ kpc up to $\\simeq 1$ kpc. We discuss our\nfindings in the wider context of multi-component models for the emission and\nstructure of large-scale quasar jets, and speculate on the physical processes\nenabling an efficient acceleration of the emitting ultra-relativistic electrons\nalong the entire jet length that exceeds 100 kpc.\n", "  A lattice-Boltzmann (LB) scheme, based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK)\ncollision rules is developed for a phase-field model of alloy solidification in\norder to simulate the growth of dendrites. The solidification of a binary alloy\nis considered, taking into account diffusive transport of heat and solute, as\nwell as the anisotropy of the solid-liquid interfacial free energy. The\nanisotropic terms in the phase-field evolution equation, the phenomenological\nanti-trapping current (introduced in the solute evolution equation to avoid\nspurious solute trapping), and the variation of the solute diffusion\ncoefficient between phases, make it necessary to modify the equilibrium\ndistribution functions of the LB scheme with respect to the one used in the\nstandard method for the solution of advection-diffusion equations. The effects\nof grid anisotropy are removed by using the lattices D3Q15 and D3Q19 instead of\nD3Q7. The method is validated by direct comparison of the simulation results\nwith a numerical code that uses the finite-difference method. Simulations are\nalso carried out for two different anisotropy functions in order to demonstrate\nthe capability of the method to generate various crystal shapes.\n", "  Considered are ${\\cal N}=2\\, SU(N_c)$ or $U(N_c)$ SQCD with $N_F<2N_c-1$\nquark flavors with the quark mass term $m{\\rm Tr}\\,({\\bar Q} Q)$ in the\nsuperpotential. ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry is softly broken down to ${\\cal\nN}=1$ by the mass term $\\mu_{\\rm x}{\\rm Tr}\\,(X^2)$ of colored adjoint scalar\npartners of gluons, $\\mu_{\\rm x}\\ll\\Lambda_2$ ($\\Lambda_2$ is the scale factor\nof the $SU(N_c)$ gauge coupling).\n  There is a large number of different types of vacua in these theories with\nboth unbroken and spontaneously broken flavor symmetry, $U(N_F)\\rightarrow\nU({\\rm n}_1)\\times U({\\rm n}_2)$. We consider in this paper the large subset of\nthese vacua with the unbroken nontrivial $Z_{2N_c-N_F\\geq 2}$ discrete\nsymmetry, at different hierarchies between the Lagrangian parameters\n$m\\gtrless\\Lambda_2,\\,\\, \\mu_{\\rm x}\\gtrless m$. The forms of low energy\nLagrangians, quantum numbers of light particles and mass spectra are described\nin the main text for all these vacua.\n  The calculations of power corrections to the leading terms of the low energy\nquark and dyon condensates are presented in two important Appendices. These\ncalculations confirm additionally in a non-trivial way a self-consistency of\nthe whole approach.\n  Our results differ essentially from corresponding results in recent related\npapers arXiv:1304.0822, arXiv:1403.6086, and arXiv:1704.06201 of M.Shifman and\nA.Yung (and in a number of their numerous previous papers on this subject), and\nwe explain in the text the reasons for these differences (see also the extended\ncritique of a number of results of these authors in section 8 of\narXiv:1308.5863).\n", "  Moist convection plays a leading role in the dynamics and energy budget of\nEarth's tropics and influences the sensitivity of Earth's climate to greenhouse\ngas increases. Because individual convective cells are much smaller than the\ngridboxes of 3-dimensional global climate models (GCMs), these models\nparameterize the effects of an ensemble of moist convective updrafts and\ndowndrafts on the environment. Cumulus parameterization has been a focus of the\nterrestrial meteorology community for half a century. Only in past decade,\nhowever, have GCMs with moist convective physics been applied to other planets.\nGiven our lack of detailed knowledge about convective clouds except on Earth,\nplanetary GCMs are often designed with very simple approaches to cumulus\nparameterization, adopted from the earliest generations of terrestrial GCMs.\nThese parameterizations were based on breakthroughs in understanding of\nconvection in their time. However, at the same time that planetary GCMs have\nbegun to emerge, a quiet revolution in how we think about terrestrial\nconvection has started to influence the design of terrestrial GCMs. In this\npaper we review how some of the assumptions in the classical cumulus\nparameterizations used in planetary GCMs (and still in some terrestrial GCMs)\nhave given way in recent years to a deeper understanding of how convection\noperates and why it matters for atmospheric dynamics and climate - on any\nplanet.\n", "  We study the possibility that at least one of the two pentaquark structures\nrecently reported by LHCb can be described as a compact pentaquark state, and\nwe give predictions for new channels that can be studied by the\nexperimentalists if this hypothesis is correct. We use very general arguments\ndictated by symmetry considerations, in order to describe the pentaquark states\nwithin a group theory approach. A complete classification of all possible\nstates and quantum numbers, that can be useful both to the experimentalists,\nfor new finding, or to theoretical model builders, are given, without the\nintroduction of any particular dynamical model. Some prediction are finally\ngiven using a Guersey-Radicati inspired mass formula. We reproduce the mass and\nthe quantum numbers of the lightest pentaquark state reported by LHCb ( 3/2^-),\nwith a parameter free mass formula, fixed on the well established baryons. We\npredict others pentaquark resonances (giving their masses, and suggesting\npossible decay channels) which belong to the same multiplet of the lightest\none.Finally, we compute the partial decay widths for all the predicted\npentaquark resonances.\n", "  We prove that the metric of a general holographic spacetime can be\nreconstructed (up to an overall conformal factor) from distinguished spatial\nslices - \"light-cone cuts\" - of the conformal boundary. Our prescription is\ncovariant and applies to bulk points in causal contact with the boundary.\nFurthermore, we describe a procedure for determining the light-cone cuts\ncorresponding to bulk points in the causal wedge of the boundary in terms of\nthe divergences of correlators in the dual field theory. Possible extensions\nfor determining the conformal factor and including the cuts of points outside\nof the causal wedge are discussed. We also comment on implications for\nsubregion/subregion duality.\n", "  The in-ice radio interferometric phased array technique for detection of high\nenergy neutrinos looks for Askaryan emission from neutrinos interacting in\nlarge volumes of glacial ice, and is being developed as a way to achieve a low\nenergy threshold and a large effective volume at high energies. The technique\nis based on coherently summing the impulsive Askaryan signal from multiple\nantennas, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio for weak signals. We report\nhere on measurements and a simulation of thermal noise correlations between\nnearby antennas, beamforming of impulsive signals, and a measurement of the\nexpected improvement in trigger efficiency through the phased array technique.\nWe also discuss the noise environment observed with an analog phased array at\nSummit Station, Greenland, a possible site for an interferometric phased array\nfor radio detection of high energy neutrinos.\n", "  Using gauge/gravity duality, we deduce several nontrivial consequences of\nquantum gravity from simple properties of the dual field theory. These include:\n(1) a version of cosmic censorship, (2) restrictions on evolution through black\nhole singularities, and (3) the exclusion of certain cosmological bounces. In\nthe classical limit, the latter implies a new singularity theorem.\n", "  Host galaxy properties provide strong constraints on the stellar progenitors\nof superluminous supernovae. By comparing a sample of 19 low-redshift (z < 0.3)\nsuperluminous supernova hosts to galaxy populations in the local Universe, we\nshow that sub-solar metallicities seem to be a requirement. All superluminous\nsupernovae in hosts with high measured gas-phase metallicities are found to\nexplode at large galactocentric radii, indicating that the metallicity at the\nexplosion site is likely lower than the integrated host value. We found that\nsuperluminous supernovae hosts do not always have star-formation rates higher\nthan typical star-forming galaxies of the same mass. However, we confirm that\nhigh absolute specific star-formation rates are a feature of superluminous\nsupernova host galaxies, but interpret this as simply a consequence of the\nanti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and specific star-formation rate\nand the requirement of on-going star formation to produce young, massive stars\ngreater than ~ 10-20 M_sol. Based on our sample, we propose an upper limit of ~\n0.5 Z_sol for forming superluminous supernova progenitors (assuming an N2\nmetallicity diagnostic and a solar oxygen abundance of 8.69). Finally, we show\nthat if magnetar powering is the source of the extreme luminosity then the\nrequired initial spins appear to be correlated with metallicity of the host\ngalaxy. This correlation needs further work, but if it holds it is a powerful\nlink between the supernova parameters and nature of the progenitor population.\n", "  Upon loading, atomic networks can feature delayed viscoplastic relaxation.\nHowever, the effect of composition and structure on such a relaxation remains\npoorly understood. Herein, relying on accelerated molecular dynamics\nsimulations and topological constraint theory, we investigate the relationship\nbetween atomic topology and stress-induced relaxation, by taking the example of\ncreep deformations in calcium--silicate--hydrates, the binding phase of\nconcrete. Under constant shear stress, C--S--H is found to feature delayed\nlogarithmic shear deformations. We demonstrate that the propensity for\nrelaxation is minimum for isostatic atomic networks, which are characterized by\nthe simultaneous absence of floppy internal modes of relaxation and eigen\nstress. This suggests that topological nano-engineering could lead to the\ndiscovery of non-aging materials.\n", "  We investigate the impacts of interaction between dark matter and dark energy\nin the context of two dark energy models, holographic and ghost dark energy. In\nfact, using the dynamical system analysis, we obtain the cosmological\nconsequence of several interactions, considering all relevant component of\nuniverse, i.e. matter (Dark and luminous), radiation and dark energy. Studying\nthe phase space for all interactions in detail, we show the existence of\nunstable matter dominated and stable dark energy dominated phases. We also show\nthat linear interactions suffer from the absence of standard radiation\ndominated epoch. Interestingly, this failure resolved by adding the non-linear\ninteractions to the models. We find an upper bound for the value of the\ncoupling constant of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy as b <\n0.57 in the case of holographic model, and b < 0.61 in the case of ghost dark\nenergy model, to result in a cosmological viable matter dominated epoch. More\nspecifically, this bound is vital to satisfy instability and deceleration of\nmatter dominated epoch.\n", "  We give a systematic review of the adiabatic theorem and the leading\nnon-adiabatic corrections in periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. These\ncorrections have a two-fold origin: (i) conventional ones originating from the\ngradually changing Floquet Hamiltonian and (ii) corrections originating from\nchanging the micro-motion operator. These corrections conspire to give a\nHall-type linear response for non-stroboscopic (time-averaged) observables\nallowing one to measure the Berry curvature and the Chern number related to the\nFloquet Hamiltonian, thus extending these concepts to periodically-driven\nmany-body systems. The non-zero Floquet Chern number allows one to realize a\nThouless energy pump, where one can adiabatically add energy to the system in\ndiscrete units of the driving frequency. We discuss the validity of Floquet\nAdiabatic Perturbation Theory (FAPT) using five different models covering\nlinear and non-linear few and many-particle systems. We argue that in\ninteracting systems, even in the stable high-frequency regimes, FAPT breaks\ndown at ultra slow ramp rates due to avoided crossings of photon resonances,\nnot captured by the inverse-frequency expansion, leading to a counter-intuitive\nstronger heating at slower ramp rates. Nevertheless, large windows in the ramp\nrate are shown to exist for which the physics of interacting driven systems is\nwell captured by FAPT.\n", "  The low dielectric losses of an isotropically pure single crystal $^{28}$Si\nsample were determined at a temperature of 20 mK and at powers equivalent to\nthat of a single photon. Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) analysis revealed large\nQuality Factors of order $2\\times10^6$ (dielectric loss $\\sim 5\\times10^{-7}$)\nat high powers, degrading to $7\\times10^5$ (dielectric loss $\\sim\n1.4\\times10^{-6}$) at single photon energy. A very low-loss narrow line width\nparamagnetic spin flip transition was detected with extreme sensitivity in\n$^{28}$Si, with very small concentration below $10^{11}$~cm$^{-3}$ (less than\n10 parts per trillion) and g-factor of $1.995\\pm0.008$. Such determination was\nonly possible due to the low dielectric photonic losses combined with the long\nlifetime of the spin transition (low magnetic loss), which enhances the\nmagnetic AC susceptibility. Such low photonic loss at single photon energy\ncombined with the narrow line width of the spin ensemble, indicate that single\ncrystal $^{28}$Si could be an important crystal for future cavity QED\nexperiments.\n", "  The study of non-equilibrium properties in topological systems is of\npractical and fundamental importance. Here, we analyze the stationary\nproperties of a two-dimensional bosonic Hofstadter lattice coupled to two\nthermal baths in the quantum open-system formalism. Novel phenomena appear like\nchiral edge heat currents that are the out-of-equilibrium counterparts of the\nzero-temperature edge currents. They support a new concept of dissipative\nsymmetry-protection, where a set of discrete symmetries protects topological\nheat currents, differing from the symmetry-protection devised in closed systems\nand zero-temperature. Remarkably, one of these currents flows opposite to the\ndecreasing external temperature gradient. As the starting point, we consider\nthe case of a single external reservoir already showing prominent results like\nthermal erasure effects and topological thermal currents. Our results are\nexperimentally accessible with platforms like photonics systems and optical\nlattices.\n", "  The recent observation of two hidden-charm pentaquark states by LHCb\ncollaborations prompted us to investigate the exotic states close to the\n$\\bar{D}\\Lambda_{\\rm c}$, $\\bar{D}^{\\ast}\\Lambda_{\\rm c}$, $\\bar{D}\\Sigma_{\\rm\nc}$, $\\bar{D}\\Sigma^{\\ast}_{\\rm c}$, $\\bar{D}^{\\ast}\\Sigma_{\\rm c}$ and\n$\\bar{D}^{\\ast}\\Sigma^{\\ast}_{\\rm c}$ thresholds. We therefore studied the\nhadronic molecules that form the coupled-channel system of\n$\\bar{D}^{(\\ast)}\\Lambda_{\\rm c}$ and\n  $\\bar{D}^{(\\ast)}\\Sigma^{(\\ast)}_{\\rm c}$. As the heavy quark spin symmetry\nmanifests the mass degenerations of $\\bar{D}$ and $\\bar{D}^\\ast$ mesons, and of\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm c}$ and $\\Sigma^\\ast_{\\rm c}$ baryons, the coupled channels of\n$\\bar{D}^{(\\ast)}\\Sigma^{(\\ast)}_{\\rm c}$ are important in these molecules. In\naddition, we consider the coupling to the $\\bar{D}^{(\\ast)}\\Lambda_{\\rm c}$\nchannel whose thresholds are near the $\\bar{D}^{(\\ast)}\\Sigma^{(\\ast)}_{\\rm c}$\nthresholds, and the coupling to the state with nonzero orbital angular momentum\nmixed by the tensor force. This full coupled channel analysis of\n$\\bar{D}^{(\\ast)}\\Lambda_{\\rm c}-\\bar{D}^{(\\ast)}\\Sigma^{(\\ast)}_{\\rm c}$ with\nlarger orbital angular momentum has never been performed before. By solving the\ncoupled-channel Schr\\\"odinger equations with the one meson exchange potentials\nthat respected to the heavy quark spin and chiral symmetries, we studied the\nhidden-charm hadronic molecules with $I(J^P)=1/2(3/2^\\pm)$ and $1/2(5/2^\\pm)$.\nWe conclude that the $J^P$ assignment of the observed pentaquarks is $3/2^+$\nfor $P^+_{\\rm c}(4380)$ and $5/2^-$ for $P^+_{\\rm c}(4450)$, which is agreement\nwith the results of the LHCb analysis. In addition, we give predictions for\nother $J^P=3/2^\\pm$ states at 4136.0, 4307.9 and 4348.7 MeV in $J^P=3/2^-$, and\n4206.7 MeV in $J^P=3/2^+$, which can be further investigated by means of\nexperiment.\n", "  In the presence of strong magnetic fields the electronic bandstructure of\ngraphene drastically changes. The Dirac cone collapses into discrete\nnon-equidistant Landau levels, which can be externally tuned by changing the\nmagnetic field. In contrast to conventional materials, specific Landau levels\nare selectively addressable using circularly polarized light. Exploiting these\nunique properties, we propose the design of a tunable laser operating in the\ntechnologically promising terahertz spectral range. To uncover the\nmany-particle physics behind the emission of light, we perform a fully quantum\nmechanical investigation of the non-equilibrium dynamics of electrons, phonons,\nand photons in optically pumped Landau-quantized graphene embedded into an\noptical cavity. The gained microscopic insights allow us to predict optimal\nexperimental conditions to realize a technologically promising terahertz laser.\n", "  We propose a model describing the evolution of the free electron current\ndensity in graphene.\n  Based on the concept of Mp-branes, we perform the analysis using the\ndifference between curvatures of parallel and antiparallel spins. In such a\nframework an effective graviton emerges in the form of gauge field exchange\nbetween electrons. In a plain graphene system, the curvatures produced by both\nkinds of spins neutralize each other. However, in the presence of defects, the\ninequality between curvatures leads to the emergence of current density,\nmodified gravity and conductivity. Depending on the type of the defects, the\nresulting current density can be negative or positive.\n", "  We consider generalized Galileon theories within general relativity in\nfour-dimensional space-time. We provide the argument showing that the\ngeneralized Galileons described by a wide class of Lagrangians do not admit\nstable, static, spherically symmetric semi-closed worlds. We also show that in\na class of theories with $p_{\\perp} = - \\rho$ (where $p_{\\perp}$ is transverse\npressure and $\\rho$ is energy density), semi-closed worlds, if exist, would be\nobserved as objects of negative mass.\n", "  We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of\nthe Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies\nover an effective area of 9329 deg^2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc^3, divided into\nthree partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts\n0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance DM and Hubble\nparameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying\nreconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the\nanisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the\nproduct DM*H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure,\nquantified by f{\\sigma}8(z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine\nmeasurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values\nand likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than\nthose from any one method. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave\nbackground measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply\ncurvature {\\Omega}_K =0.0003+/-0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state\nparameter w = -1.01+/-0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold\ndark matter model with a cosmological constant ({\\Lambda}CDM). Our RSD\nmeasurements of f{\\sigma}_8, at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent\nwith this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H0 = 67.3+/-1.0\nkm/s/Mpc even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some\ndirect measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom\nloosens the constraint only slightly, to H0 = 67.8+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc. Assuming\nflat {\\Lambda}CDM we find {\\Omega}_m = 0.310+/-0.005 and H0 = 67.6+/-0.5\nkm/s/Mpc, and we find a 95% upper limit of 0.16 eV/c^2 on the neutrino mass\nsum.\n", "  AGN exhibit rapid, high amplitude stochastic flux variations across the\nentire electromagnetic spectrum on timescales ranging from hours to years. The\ncause of this variability is poorly understood. We present a Green's\nFunction-based method for using variability to (1) measure the time-scales on\nwhich flux perturbations evolve and (2) characterize the driving flux\nperturbations. We model the observed light curve of an AGN as a linear\ndifferential equation driven by stochastic impulses. We analyze the light curve\nof the Kepler AGN Zw 229-15 and find that the observed variability behavior can\nbe modeled as a damped harmonic oscillator perturbed by a colored noise\nprocess. The model powerspectrum turns over on time-scale $385$~d. On shorter\ntime-scales, the log-powerspectrum slope varies between $2$ and $4$, explaining\nthe behavior noted by previous studies. We recover and identify both the\n$5.6$~d and $67$~d timescales reported by previous work using the Green's\nFunction of the C-ARMA equation rather than by directly fitting the\npowerspectrum of the light curve. These are the timescales on which flux\nperturbations grow, and on which flux perturbations decay back to the\nsteady-state flux level respectively. We make the software package KALI used to\nstudy light curves using our method available to the community.\n", "  A strong limitation of linear optical quantum computing is the probabilistic\noperation of two-quantum bit gates based on the coalescence of\nindistinguishable photons. A route to deterministic operation is to exploit the\nsingle-photon nonlinearity of an atomic transition. Through engineering of the\natom-photon interaction, phase shifters, photon filters and photon- photon\ngates have been demonstrated with natural atoms. Proofs of concept have been\nreported with semiconductor quantum dots, yet limited by inefficient\natom-photon interfaces and dephasing. Here we report on a highly efficient\nsingle-photon filter based on a large optical non-linearity at the single\nphoton level, in a near-optimal quantum-dot cavity interface. When probed with\ncoherent light wavepackets, the device shows a record nonlinearity threshold\naround $0.3 \\pm 0.1$ incident photons. We demonstrate that directly reflected\npulses consist of 80% single-photon Fock state and that the two- and\nthree-photon components are strongly suppressed compared to the single-photon\none.\n", "  Consider a graph having quantum systems lying at each node. Suppose that the\nwhole thing evolves in discrete time steps, according to a global, unitary\ncausal operator. By causal we mean that information can only propagate at a\nbounded speed, with respect to the distance given by the graph. Suppose,\nmoreover, that the graph itself is subject to the evolution, and may be driven\nto be in a quantum superposition of graphs---in accordance to the superposition\nprinciple. We show that these unitary causal operators must decompose as a\nfinite-depth circuit of local unitary gates. This unifies a result on Quantum\nCellular Automata with another on Reversible Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the\nway we formalize a notion of causality which is valid in the context of quantum\nsuperpositions of time-varying graphs, and has a number of good properties.\nKeywords: Quantum Lattice Gas Automata, Block-representation,\nCurtis-Hedlund-Lyndon, No-signalling, Localizability, Quantum Gravity, Quantum\nGraphity, Causal Dynamical Triangulations, Spin Networks, Dynamical networks,\nGraph Rewriting.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate that pumping a graded-index multimode fiber\nwith sub-ns pulses from a microchip Nd:YAG laser leads to spectrally flat\nsupercontinuum generation with a uniform bell-shaped spatial beam profile\nextending from the visible to the mid-infrared at 2500\\,nm. We study the\ndevelopment of the supercontinuum along the multimode fiber by the cut-back\nmethod, which permits us to analyze the competition between the Kerr-induced\ngeometric parametric instability and stimulated Raman scattering. We also\nperformed a spectrally resolved temporal analysis of the supercontinuum\nemission.\n", "  X-ray emission and absorption spectroscopies are jointly used as fast probes\nto determine the evolution as a function of doping of the fluctuating local\nmagnetic moments in K- and Cr- hole-doped BaFe2As2. An increase in the local\nmoment with hole-doping is found, supporting the theoretical scenario in which\na Mott insulating state that would be realized for half-filled conduction bands\nhas an influence throughout the phase diagram of these iron-pnictides.\n", "  We develop a method to simulate galaxy-galaxy weak lensing by utilizing\nall-sky, light-cone simulations and their inherent halo catalogs. Using the\nmock catalog to study the error covariance matrix of galaxy-galaxy weak\nlensing, we compare the full covariance with the \"jackknife\" (JK) covariance,\nthe method often used in the literature that estimates the covariance from the\nresamples of the data itself. We show that there exists the variation of JK\ncovariance over realizations of mock lensing measurements, while the average JK\ncovariance over mocks can give a reasonably accurate estimation of the true\ncovariance up to separations comparable with the size of JK subregion. The\nscatter in JK covariances is found to be $\\sim10\\%$ after we subtract the\nlensing measurement around random points. However, the JK method tends to\nunderestimate the covariance at the larger separations, more increasingly for a\nsurvey with a higher number density of source galaxies. We apply our method to\nthe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, and show that the 48 mock SDSS\ncatalogs nicely reproduce the signals and the JK covariance measured from the\nreal data. We then argue that the use of the accurate covariance, compared to\nthe JK covariance, allows us to use the lensing signals at large scales beyond\na size of the JK subregion, which contains cleaner cosmological information in\nthe linear regime.\n", "  In a recent experiment, half-quantized longitudinal conductance plateaus\n(HQCPs) of height $\\frac{e^2}{2h}$ have been observed in quantum anomalous Hall\n(QAH) insulator/superconductor heterostructure transport measurements. It was\npredicted that these HQCPs are signatures of chiral Majorana edge states. The\nHQCPs are supposed to appear in the regimes where the Hall conductance\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ is quantized. However, experimentally, a pair of the HQCPs appear\nwhen the Hall conductance $\\sigma_{xy}$ is only 80% of the quantized value when\ndissipative channels appear in the bulk. The dissipative channels in the bulk\nare expected to induce Andreev reflections and ruin the HQCPs. In this work, we\nexplain how domain walls can cause $\\sigma_{xy}$ to deviate from its quantized\nvalue and at the same time maintain the quantization of HQCPs. Our work\nsupports the claim that the experimentally observed HQCPs are indeed caused by\nchiral Majorana modes in the QAH insulator/superconductor heterostructure.\n", "  To investigate the differences in mechanical feedback from radio-loud and\nradio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on the host galaxy, we perform 3D AMR\nhydrodynamic simulations of wide angle, radio-quiet winds with different\ninclinations on a single, massive, gas-rich disk galaxy at a redshift of 2-3.\nWe compare our results to hydrodynamic simulations of the same galaxy but with\na jet. The jet has an inclination of 0 degrees (perpendicular to the galactic\nplane), and the winds have inclinations of 0, 45, and 90 degrees. We analyze\nthe impact on the host's gas, star formation, and circum-galactic medium. We\nfind that jet feedback is energy-driven and wind feedback is momentum-driven.\nIn all the simulations, the jet or wind creates a cavity mostly devoid of dense\ngas in the nuclear region where star formation is then quenched, but we find\nstrong positive feedback in all the simulations at radii greater than 3 kpc.\nAll four simulations have similar SFRs and stellar velocities with large radial\nand vertical components. However, the wind at an inclination of 90 degrees\ncreates the highest density regions through ram pressure and generates the\nhighest rates of star formation due to its ongoing strong interaction with the\ndense gas of the galactic plane. With increased wind inclination, we find\ngreater asymmetry in gas distribution and resulting star formation. Our model\ngenerates an expanding ring of triggered star formation with typical velocity\nof order 1/3 of the circular velocity, superimposed on the older stellar\npopulation. This should result in a potentially detectable blue asymmetry in\nstellar absorption features at kpc scales.\n", "  It is important to spintronics to achieve fully-spin-polarized magnetic\nmaterials that are stable and can be easily fabricated. Here, through\nsystematical density-functional-theory investigations, we achieve high and even\nfull spin polarization for carriers in the ground-state phase of CrTe by\napplying tensile biaxial stress. The resulting strain is tensile in the xy\nplane and compressive in the z axis. With the in-plane tensile strain\nincreasing, the ferromagnetic order is stable against antiferromagnetic\nfluctuations, and a half-metallic ferromagnetism is achieved at an in-plane\nstrain of 4.8%. With the spin-orbit coupling taken into account, the spin\npolarization is equivalent to 97% at the electronic phase transition point, and\nthen becomes 100.0% at the in-plane strain of 6.0%. These make us believe that\nthe full-spin-polarized ferromagnetism in this stable and easily-realizable\nhexagonal phase could be realized soon, and applied in spintronics.\n", "  The investigation of the interaction between the supernova remnants (SNRs)\nand interstellar gas is not only necessary to improve our knowledge of SNRs,\nbut also to understand the nature of the progenitor systems. As a part of the\nMilky Way Imaging Scroll Painting CO line survey (MWISP), we study the\ninterstellar gas surrounding the Galactic historical SNRs, using the PMO\n13.7-meter telescope. In this work, we present large-field\n(3$^\\circ$$\\times$2$^\\circ$) and high-sensitivity CO(1-0) molecular line\nobservations toward Tycho's SNR. The CO observations reveal, from the outside\nin, large molecular clouds, stream-like structures, and an inner rim around\nTycho's SNR. We derived the basic properties (column density, mass, and\nkinematics) of these objects based on the CO observations. The large molecular\nclouds individually show an arc toward the remnant center, outlining a large\ncavity with radii of $\\sim$0.3$^\\circ$$\\times$0.6$^\\circ$ (or 13 pc $\\times$27\npc at a distance of 2.5 kpc) around the remnant. The CO line broadenings and\nasymmetries detected in the surrounding clouds, the observed expansion of the\ncavity, in concert with enhanced $^{12}$CO(2-1)/(1-0) intensity ratio detected\nin previous studies, suggest the interaction of the large cavity with a wind in\nthe region. After excluding the scenario of a large bubble produced by bright\nmassive stars, we suggest that the large cavity could be explained by accretion\nwind from the progenitor system of Tycho's supernova. Nevertheless, the\npossibility of the random distribution of a large cavity around Tycho's SNR\ncannot be ruled out thus far. Further observations are needed to confirm the\nphysical association of the large cavity with Tycho's SNR.\n", "  We used the magneto-dipole radiation mechanism for the braking of radio\npulsars to calculate the new values of magnetic inductions at the surfaces of\nneutron stars. For this aim we estimated the angles ? between the rotation axis\nand the magnetic moment of the neutron star for 376 radio pulsars using three\ndifferent methods. It was shown that there was the predominance of small\ninclinations of the magnetic axes. Using the obtained values of the angle ? we\ncalculated the equatorial magnetic inductions for pulsars considered. These\ninductions are several times higher as a rule than corresponding values in the\nknown catalogs.\n", "  The idea of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) has recently emerged in\nthe study of both condensed matter systems and gravitational systems. It not\nonly plays a key role in investigating the holographic duality between a\nstrongly interacting quantum system and a gravitational system, but also\ndiagnoses the chaotic behavior of many-body quantum systems and characterizes\nthe information scrambling. Based on the OTOCs, three different concepts --\nquantum chaos, holographic duality, and information scrambling -- are found to\nbe intimately related to each other. Despite of its theoretical importance, the\nexperimental measurement of the OTOC is quite challenging and so far there is\nno experimental measurement of the OTOC for local operators. Here we report the\nmeasurement of OTOCs of local operators for an Ising spin chain on a nuclear\nmagnetic resonance quantum simulator. We observe that the OTOC behaves\ndifferently in the integrable and non-integrable cases. Based on the recent\ndiscovered relationship between OTOCs and the growth of entanglement entropy in\nthe many-body system, we extract the entanglement entropy from the measured\nOTOCs, which clearly shows that the information entropy oscillates in time for\nintegrable models and scrambles for non-intgrable models. With the measured\nOTOCs, we also obtain the experimental result of the butterfly velocity, which\nmeasures the speed of correlation propagation. Our experiment paves a way for\nexperimentally studying quantum chaos, holographic duality, and information\nscrambling in many-body quantum systems with quantum simulators.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of reorienting oblique shocks that form in\nthe collision layer between magnetized colliding flows. Reorientation aligns\nparsec-scale post-shock filaments normal to the background magnetic field. We\nfind that reorientation begins with pressure gradients between the collision\nregion and the ambient medium. This drives a lateral expansion of post-shock\ngas, which reorients the growing filament from the outside-in (i.e. from the\nflow-ambient boundary, toward the colliding flows axis). The final structures\nof our simulations resemble polarization observations of filaments in Taurus\nand Serpens South, as well as the integral-shaped filament in Orion A. Given\nthe ubiquity of colliding flows in the interstellar medium, shock reorientation\nmay be relevant to the formation of filaments normal to magnetic fields.\n", "  Context: The past decade has witnessed a large number of Galactic plane\nsurveys at angular resolutions below 20\". However, no comparable\nhigh-resolution survey exists at long radio wavelengths around 21cm in line and\ncontinuum emission. Methods: Employing the Very Large Array (VLA) in the\nC-array configuration and a large program, we observe the HI 21cm line, four OH\nlines, nineteen Halpha radio recombination lines as well as the continuum\nemission from 1 to 2GHz in full polarization over a large part of the first\nGalactic quadrant. Results: Covering Galactic longitudes from 14.5 to 67.4deg\nand latitudes between +-1.25deg, we image all of these lines and the continuum\nat ~20\" resolution. These data allow us to study the various components of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM): from the atomic phase, traced by the HI line, to the\nmolecular phase, observed by the OH transitions, to the ionized medium,\nrevealed by the cm continuum and the Halpha radio recombination lines.\nFurthermore, the polarized continuum emission enables magnetic field studies.\nIn this overview paper, we discuss the survey outline and present the first\ndata release as well as early results from the different datasets. We now\nrelease the first half of the survey; the second half will follow later after\nthe ongoing data processing has been completed. The data in fits format\n(continuum images and line data cubes) can be accessed through the project\nweb-page http://www.mpia.de/thor. Conclusions: The HI/OH/Recombination line\nsurvey of the Milky Way (THOR) opens a new window to the different parts of the\nISM. It enables detailed studies of molecular cloud formation, conversion of\natomic to molecular gas, and feedback from HII regions as well as the magnetic\nfield in the Milky Way. It is highly complementary to other surveys of our\nGalaxy, and comparing different datasets allows us to address many open\nquestions.\n", "  This work considers the distribution of inertial particles in turbulence\nusing the point-particle approximation. We demonstrate that the random point\nprocess formed by the positions of particles in space is a Poisson point\nprocess with log-normal random intensity (\"log Gaussian Cox process\" or LGCP).\nThe probability of having a finite number of particles in a small volume is\ngiven in terms of the characteristic function of a log-normal distribution.\nCorrections due to discreteness of the number of particles to the previously\nderived statistics of particle concentration in the continuum limit are\nprovided. These are relevant for dealing with experimental or numerical data.\nThe probability of having regions without particles, i.e. voids, is larger for\ninertial particles than for tracer particles where voids are distributed\naccording to Poisson processes. Further, the probability of having large voids\ndecays only log-normally with size. This shows that particles cluster, leaving\nvoids behind. At scales where there is no clustering there can still be an\nincrease of the void probability so that turbulent voiding is stronger than\nclustering. The demonstrated double stochasticity of the distribution\noriginates in the two-step formation of fluctuations. First, turbulence brings\nthe particles randomly close together which happens with Poisson-type\nprobability. Then, turbulence compresses the particles' volume in the\nobservation volume. We confirm the theory of the statistics of the number of\nparticles in small volumes by numerical observations of inertial particle\nmotion in a chaotic ABC flow. The improved understanding of clustering\nprocesses can be applied to predict the long-time survival probability of\nreacting particles. Our work implies that the particle distribution in weakly\ncompressible flow with finite time correlations is a LGCP, independently of the\ndetails of the flow statistics.\n", "  We investigate cat codes that can correct multiple excitation losses and\nidentify two types of logical errors: bit-flip errors due to excessive\nexcitation loss and dephasing errors due to quantum back-action from the\nenvironment. We show that selected choices of logical subspace and coherent\namplitude can efficiently reduce dephasing errors. The trade-off between the\ntwo major errors enables optimized performance of cat codes in terms of\nminimized decoherence. With high coupling efficiency, we show that one-way\nquantum repeaters with cat codes feature drastically boosted secure\ncommunication rate per mode compared with conventional encoding schemes, and\nthus showcase the promising potential of quantum information processing with\ncontinuous variable quantum codes.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the flow of a viscoelastic fluid in a parallel\nshear geometry at low Reynolds number. As the flow becomes unstable via a\nnonlinear subcritical instability, velocimetry measurements show non-periodic\nfluctuations over a broad range of frequencies and wavelengths, consistent with\nthe main features of elastic turbulence. Using the same experimental setup, we\ncompare these features to those in the flow around cylinders, which is upstream\nto the parallel shear region; we find significant differences in power spectra\nscaling, intermittency statistics, and flow structures. We propose a simple\nmechanism to explain the growth of velocity fluctuations in parallel shear\nflows based on polymer stretching due to fluctuations in streamwise velocity\ngradients.\n", "  Strongly magnetized accreting stars are often hypothesized to be in `spin\nequilibrium' with their surrounding accretion flows, which requires that the\naccretion rate changes more slowly than it takes the star to reach spin\nequilibrium. This is not true for most magnetically accreting stars, which have\nstrongly variable accretion outbursts on time-scales much shorter than the time\nit would take to reach spin equilibrium. This paper examines how accretion\noutbursts affect the time a star takes to reach spin equilibrium and its final\nequilibrium spin period. I consider several different models for angular\nmomentum loss -- either carried away in an outflow, lost to a stellar wind, or\ntransferred back to the accretion disc (the `trapped disc'). For transient\nsources, the outflow scenario leads to significantly longer times to reach spin\nequilibrium ($\\sim$10x), and shorter equilibrium spin periods than would be\nexpected from spin equilibrium arguments, while the `trapped disc' does not.\nThe results suggest that disc trapping plays a significant role in the spin\nevolution of strongly magnetic stars, with some caveats for young stellar\nobjects.\n", "  We propose formulas for the $1/N$ correction to the sphere free energy of\ntheories with 4-fermion interactions, which are conformal for $d>2$. We also\npropose a formula for the scalar $O(N)$ model. Expanding these formulas in\nsmall $\\epsilon$ near various integer dimensions we find a perfect agreement\nwith results obtained using $\\epsilon$-expansion technique. In $d=3$, the large\n$N$ results with the $1/N$ correction included are in good agreement with the\nPade resummed $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n", "  Second-order optical nonlinear effects (second-harmonic and sum-frequency\ngeneration) are demonstrated in the telecommunication band by periodic poling\nof thin films of lithium niobate wafer-bonded on silicon substrates and\nrib-loaded with silicon nitride channels to attain ridge waveguide with\ncross-sections of ~ 2 {\\mu}m2. The compactness of the waveguides results in\nefficient second-order nonlinear devices. A nonlinear conversion of 8% is\nobtained with a pulsed input in 4 mm long waveguides. The choice of silicon\nsubstrate makes the platform potentially compatible with silicon photonics, and\ntherefore may pave the path towards on-chip nonlinear and quantum-optic\napplications.\n", "  We use the largest sample of z~6 galaxies to date from the first four Hubble\nFrontier Fields clusters to set constraints on the shape of the z~6 luminosity\nfunctions (LFs) to fainter than Muv=-14 mag. We quantify, for the first time,\nthe impact of magnification uncertainties on LF results and thus provide more\nrealistic constraints than other recent work. Our simulations reveal that for\nthe highly-magnified sources the systematic uncertainties can become extremely\nlarge fainter than -14 mag, reaching several orders of magnitude at 95%\nconfidence at ~-12 mag. Our new forward-modeling formalism incorporates the\nimpact of magnification uncertainties into the LF results by exploiting the\navailability of many independent magnification models for the same cluster. One\npublic magnification model is used to construct a mock high-redshift galaxy\nsample that is then analyzed using the other magnification models to construct\na LF. Large systematic errors occur at high magnifications (mu>30) because of\ndifferences between the models. The volume densities we derive for faint (>-17\nmag) sources are ~3-4x lower than one recent report and give a faint-end slope\nalpha=-1.92+/-0.04, which is 3.0-3.5sigma shallower (including or not including\nthe size uncertainties, respectively). We introduce a new curvature parameter\ndelta to model the faint end of the LF and demonstrate that the observations\npermit (at 68% confidence) a turn-over at z~6 in the range -15.3 to -14.2 mag,\ndepending on the assumed lensing model. The present consideration of\nmagnification errors and new size determinations raise doubts about previous\nreports regarding the form of the LF at >-14 mag. We discuss the implications\nof our turn-over constraints in the context of recent theoretical predictions.\n", "  Conventional logic and memory devices are built out of deterministic units\nsuch as transistors, or magnets with energy barriers in excess of 40-60 kT. We\nshow that stochastic units, p-bits, can be interconnected to create robust\ncorrelations that implement Boolean functions with impressive accuracy,\ncomparable to standard circuits. Also they are invertible, a unique property\nthat is absent in digital circuits. When operated in the direct mode, the input\nis clamped, and the network provides the correct output. In the inverted mode,\nthe output is clamped, and the network fluctuates among possible inputs\nconsistent with that output. We present an implementation of an invertible gate\nto bring out the key role of a three-terminal building block to enable the\nconstruction of correlated p-bit networks. The results for this implementation\nagree well with those from a universal model, showing that p-bits need not be\nmagnet-based: any three-terminal tunable random bit generator should be\nsuitable. We present an algorithm for designing a Boltzmann machine (BM) with\nsymmetric connections that implements a given truth table. We then show how BM\nFull Adders can be interconnected in a partially directed manner to implement\nlarge operations such as 32-bit addition. Hundreds of p-bits get precisely\ncorrelated such that the correct answer out of 2^33 possibilities can be\nextracted by looking at the mode of a number of time samples. With perfect\ndirectivity a small number of samples is enough, while for less directed\nconnections more samples are needed, but even in the former case invertibility\nis largely preserved. This combination of accuracy and invertibility is enabled\nby the hybrid design that uses bidirectional units to construct circuits with\npartially directed connections. We establish this result with examples\nincluding a 4-bit multiplier which in inverted mode functions as a factorizer.\n", "  Recent numerical results of current-driven instabilities at low magnetic\nPrandtl number and high Hartmann number support the possibility of a saturation\nstate characterized by helicity oscillations. We investigate the underlying\nmechanism by analyzing this possibility using an higher-order Landau-Ginzburg\neffective Lagrangian for the weakly non-linear amplitude dynamics, where the\nmagnetic and velocity perturbations are linearly dependent. We find that, if\nthe mirror symmetry between left- and right-handed modes is spontaneously\nbroken, it is impossible to achieve an oscillating helical state. We argue that\nthe result is likely to hold also adding higher-order terms and in the presence\nof an explicit symmetry breaking. We conclude that an oscillating saturating\nstate for the Tayler instability is unlikely to depend on the interaction of\nchiral modes.\n", "  In the classical core-accretion planet formation scenario, rapid inward\nmigration and accretion timescales of kilometer size planetesimals may not\nfavor the formation of massive cores of giant planets before the dissipation of\nprotoplanetary disks. On the other hand, the existence of pressure maxima in\nthe disk could act as migration traps and locations for solid material\naccumulation, favoring the formation of massive cores. We aim to study the\nradial drift of pebbles and planetesimals and planet migration at pressure\nmaxima in a protoplanetary disk and their implications for the formation of\nmassive cores as triggering a gaseous runaway accretion phase. The time\nevolution of a viscosity driven accretion disk is solved numerically\nintroducing a a dead zone as a low-viscosity region in the protoplanetary disk.\nA population of pebbles and planetesimals evolving by radial drift and\naccretion by the planets is also considered. Finally, the embryos embedded in\nthe disk grow by the simultaneous accretion of pebbles, planetesimals and the\nsurrounding gas. Our simulations show that the pressure maxima generated at the\nedges of the low-viscosity region of the disk act as planet migration traps,\nand that the pebble and planetesimal surface densities are significantly\nincreased due to the radial drift towards pressure maxima locations. However,\nour simulations also show that migration trap locations and solid material\naccumulation locations are not exactly at the same positions. Thus, a planet's\nsemi-major axis oscillations around zero torque locations, predicted by MHD and\nHD simulations, are needed for the planet to accrete all the available material\naccumulated at the pressure maxima. Pressure maxima generated at the edges of a\nlow-viscosity region of a protoplanetary disk seem to be preferential locations\nfor the formation and trap of massive cores.\n", "  A rather unique feature of the two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) formed at\nthe interface between the two insulators LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 is to host both\ngate-tunable superconductivity and strong spin-orbit coupling. In the present\nwork, we use the disorder generated by Cr substitution of Al atoms in LaAlO3 as\na tool to explore the nature of superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling in\nthese interfaces. A reduction of the superconducting Tc is observed with Cr\ndoping consistent with an increase of electron-electron interaction in presence\nof disorder. In addition, the evolution of spin-orbit coupling with gate\nvoltage and Cr doping suggests a D'Yakonov-Perel mechanism of spin relaxation\nin the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a forthcoming ground-based observatory\nfor very-high-energy gamma rays. CTA will consist of two arrays of imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and\nwill combine telescopes of different types to achieve unprecedented performance\nand energy coverage. The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is one of the\nsmall-sized telescopes proposed for CTA to explore the energy range from a few\nTeV to hundreds of TeV with a field of view $\\gtrsim 8^\\circ$ and angular\nresolution of a few arcminutes. The GCT design features dual-mirror\nSchwarzschild-Couder optics and a compact camera based on densely-pixelated\nphotodetectors as well as custom electronics. In this contribution we provide\nan overview of the GCT project with focus on prototype development and testing\nthat is currently ongoing. We present results obtained during the first\non-telescope campaign in late 2015 at the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon, during\nwhich we recorded the first Cherenkov images from atmospheric showers with the\nGCT multi-anode photomultiplier camera prototype. We also discuss the\ndevelopment of a second GCT camera prototype with silicon photomultipliers as\nphotosensors, and plans toward a contribution to the realisation of CTA.\n", "  The design of next generation \\beta-type titanium implants requires detailed\nknowledge of the relevant stable and metastable phases at temperatures where\nmetallurgical heat treatments can be performed. Recently, a standard\nspecification for surgical implant applications was established for Mo-Ti\nalloys. However, the thermodynamic properties of this binary system are not\nwell known and two conflicting descriptions of the \\beta-phase stability have\nbeen presented in the literature. In this study, we use ab-initio calculations\nto investigate the Mo-Ti phase diagram. These calculations predict that the\n\\beta-phase is stable over a wide concentration range, in qualitative agreement\nwith one of the reported phase diagrams. In addition, they predict\nstoichiometric compounds, stable at temperatures below 3000C, which have not\nyet been detected by experiments. The resulting solvus, which defines the\ntransition to the \\beta-phase solid solution, therefore occurs at lower\ntemperatures and is more complex than previously anticipated.\n", "  We study the impact of sky-based calibration errors from source mismodeling\non 21\\,cm power spectrum measurements with an interferometer and propose a\nmethod for suppressing their effects. While emission from faint sources that\nare not accounted for in calibration catalogs is believed to be spectrally\nsmooth, deviations of true visibilities from model visibilities are not, due to\nthe inherent chromaticity of the interferometer's sky-response (the \"wedge\").\nThus, unmodeled foregrounds, below the confusion limit of many instruments,\nintroduce frequency structure into gain solutions on the same line-of-sight\nscales on which we hope to observe the cosmological signal. We derive analytic\nexpressions describing these errors using linearized approximations of the\ncalibration equations and estimate the impact of this bias on measurements of\nthe 21\\,cm power spectrum during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Given our\ncurrent precision in primary beam and foreground modeling, this noise will\nsignificantly impact the sensitivity of existing experiments that rely on\nsky-based calibration. Our formalism describes the scaling of calibration with\narray and sky-model parameters and can be used to guide future instrument\ndesign and calibration strategy. We find that sky-based calibration that\ndown-weights long baselines can eliminate contamination in most of the region\noutside of the wedge with only a modest increase in instrumental noise.\n", "  The cross section for coherent $\\mathrm{J/}\\psi$ photoproduction in Pb-Pb\ncollisions is the sum of two contributions, one from low-, the other from\nhigh-energy photon-nucleus interactions. A novel method to disentangle both\ncontributions allowing one to extract the coherent photo-nuclear cross section\nfor coherent $\\mathrm{J/}\\psi$ production, $\\sigma_{\\gamma \\rm Pb}$, is\npresented. The utility of the method is demonstrated using measurements from\nperipheral and ultra-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Applying the\nproposed method to the available data it is possible to obtain $\\sigma_{\\gamma\n\\rm Pb}$ up to a photon-lead centre-of-mass energy of 470 GeV, which\ncorresponds to $x$ of 4.4x10$^{-5}$. To illustrate a possible use of the\nextracted photo-nuclear cross sections, the corresponding nuclear suppression\nfactors are computed and they are compared to predictions of gluon shadowing\ncalculated in the leading-twist approximation approach.\n", "  The observable quantities that carry the most information regarding the\nstructures of the images of black holes in the interferometric observations\nwith the Event Horizon Telescope are the closure phases along different\nbaseline triangles. We use long time span, high cadence, GRMHD+radiative\ntransfer models of Sgr A$^*$ to investigate the expected variability of closure\nphases in such observations. We find that, in general, closure phases along\nsmall baseline triangles show little variability, except in the cases when one\nof the triangle vertices crosses one of a small regions of low visibility\namplitude. The closure phase variability increases with the size of the\nbaseline triangle, as larger baselines probe the small-scale structures of the\nimages, which are highly variable. On average, the jet-dominated MAD models\nshow less closure phase variability than the disk-dominated SANE models, even\nin the large baseline triangles, because the images from the latter are more\nsensitive to the turbulence in the accretion flow. Our results suggest that\nimage reconstruction techniques need to explicitly take into account the\nclosure phase variability, especially if the quality and quantity of data allow\nfor a detailed characterization of the nature of variability. This also implies\nthat, if image reconstruction techniques that rely on the assumption of a\nstatic image are utilized, regions of the $u-v$ space that show a high level of\nvariability will need to be identified and excised.\n", "  Two systems whose correlations cannot be classically accounted for display\nthe simplest instance of quantum entanglement. Although this two-party\nassociation has caused a revolution in the foundations and uses of quantum\nmechanics, genuine entanglement among several parties unveils a whole new class\nof phenomena and applications. In this work we suggest a way to prepare Dicke\nstates from a tunable source of bipartite entanglement to investigate\nfoundational issues. The scheme has the following distinctive features: (i) it\nrelies on controlled information loss and {\\it unentangled} measurements; (ii)\nirrespective of the source entanglement, whenever a Dicke state is produced, it\nis ideal; (iii) the optimal entanglement of the bipartite source undergoes a\nsecond-order-like transition depending on the parameters of the Dicke state to\nbe produced. These properties lead to asymptotic results on the entanglement\nbetween any qubit belonging to a Dicke state and the remaining qubits.\n", "  We study the frequently used assumption in multi-messenger astrophysics that\nthe gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes are directly connected because they are\nassumed to be produced by the same photohadronic production chain. An\ninteresting candidate source for this test is the flat-spectrum radio quasar\nPKS B1424-418, which recently called attention of a potential correlation\nbetween an IceCube PeV-neutrino event and its burst phase. We simulate both the\nmulti-waveband photon and the neutrino emission from this source using a\nself-consistent radiation model. We demonstrate that a simple hadronic model\ncannot adequately describe the spectral energy distribution for this source,\nbut a lepto-hadronic model with sub-dominant hadronic component can reproduce\nthe multi-waveband photon spectrum observed during various activity phases of\nthe blazar. As a conclusion, up to about 0.3 neutrino events may coincide with\nthe burst, which implies that the leptonic contribution dominates in the\nrelevant energy band. We also demonstrate that the time-wise correlation\nbetween the neutrino event and burst phase is weak.\n", "  By using a state of art tensor network state method, we study the\nground-state phase diagram of an extended Bose-Hubbard model on the square\nlattice with frustrated next-nearest neighboring tunneling. In the hardcore\nlimit, tunneling frustration stabilizes a peculiar half supersolid (HSS) phase\nwith one sublattice being superfluid and the other sublattice being Mott\nInsulator away from half filling. In the softcore case, the model shows very\nrich phase diagrams above half filling, including three different types of\nsupersolid phases depending on the interaction parameters. The considered model\nprovides a promising route to experimentally search for novel stable supersolid\nstate induced by frustrated tunneling in below half filling region with dipolar\natoms or molecules.\n", "  We derive the leading g_s perturbation of the SUGRA fields generated by a\nsupersymmetric configuration of respectively 1, 2 or 4 D3-branes intersecting\nat an arbitrary angle via the computation of the string theory disk scattering\namplitude of one massless NSNS field interacting with open strings stretched\nbetween the branes. The configuration with four branes is expected to be\nrelevant for black hole microstate counting in four dimensions.\n", "  The analysis of the Chandra X-ray observations of the gravitationally lensed\nquasar RX J1131-1231 revealed the detection of multiple and energy-variable\nspectral peaks. The spectral variability is thought to result from the\nmicrolensing of the Fe K-alpha emission, selectively amplifying the emission\nfrom certain regions of the accretion disk with certain effective frequency\nshifts of the Fe K-alpha line emission. In this paper, we combine detailed\nsimulations of the emission of Fe K-alpha photons from the accretion disk of a\nKerr black hole with calculations of the effect of gravitational microlensing\non the observed energy spectra. The simulations show that microlensing can\nindeed produce multiply peaked energy spectra. We explore the dependence of the\nspectral characteristics on black hole spin, accretion disk inclination, corona\nheight, and microlensing amplification factor, and show that the measurements\ncan be used to constrain these parameters. We find that the range of observed\nspectral peak energies of QSO RX J1131-1231 can only be reproduced for black\nhole inclinations exceeding 70 degree and for lamppost corona heights of less\nthan 30 gravitational radii above the black hole. We conclude by emphasizing\nthe scientific potential of studies of the microlensed Fe K$\\alpha$ quasar\nemission and the need for more detailed modeling that explores how the results\nchange for more realistic accretion disk and corona geometries and microlensing\nmagnification patterns. A full analysis should furthermore model the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the observations and the resulting detection biases.\n", "  Within the $\\alpha$-attractors framework we investigate scalar potentials\nwith the same pole as the one featured in the kinetic term. We show that, in\nfield space, this leads to directions without a plateau. Using this, we present\na proposal, which manages to overcome the initial conditions problem of\ninflation with a plateau. An earlier period of proto-inflation, beginning at\nPlanck scale, accounts for the Universe expansion and arranges the required\ninitial conditions for inflation on the plateau to commence. We show that, if\nproto-inflation is power-law, it does not suffer from a sub-Planckian eternal\ninflationary stage, which would otherwise be a problem. A simple model\nrealisation is constructed in the context of $\\alpha$-attractors, which can\nboth generate the inflationary plateau and the exponential slopes around it,\nnecessary for the two inflation stages. Our mechanism allows to assume chaotic\ninitial conditions at the Planck scale for proto-inflation, it is generic and\nit is shown to work without fine-tuning.\n", "  We use an event-by-event hydrodynamical description of the heavy-ion\ncollision process with Glauber initial conditions to calculate the thermal\nemission of photons. The photon rates in the hadronic phase follow from a\nspectral function approach and a density expansion, while in the partonic phase\nthey follow from the AMY perturbative rates. The calculated photon elliptic\nflows are lower than those reported recently by both the ALICE and PHENIX\ncollaborations.\n", "  The covariance matrix of the matter and halo power spectrum and bispectrum\nare studied. Using a large suite of simulations, we find that the\nnon-Gaussianity in the covariance is significant already at mildly nonlinear\nscales. We compute the leading disconnected non-Gaussian correction to the\nmatter bispectrum covariance using perturbation theory, and find that the\ncorrections result in good agreement in the mildly nonlinear regime. The shot\nnoise contribution to the halo power spectrum and bispectrum covariance is\ncomputed using the Poisson model, and the model yields decent agreement with\nsimulation results. However, when the shot noise is estimated from the\nindividual realization, which is usually done in reality, we find that the halo\ncovariance is substantially reduced and gets close to the Gaussian covariance.\nThis is because most of the non-Gaussianity in the covariance arises from the\nfluctuations in the Poisson shot noise. We use the measured non-Gaussian\ncovariance to access the information content of the power spectrum and\nbispectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, of the matter and halo power\nspectrum levels off in the mildly nonlinear regime, $k \\sim 0.1 - 0.2\n\\,\\mathrm{Mpc} h^{-1}$. In the nonlinear regime the S/N of the matter and halo\nbispectrum increases but much slower than the Gaussian results suggest. We find\nthat both the S/N for power spectrum and bispectrum are overestimated by the\nGaussian covariances, but the problem being much more serious for the\nbispectrum. Because the bispectrum is affected strongly by nonlinearity and\nshot noise, inclusion of the bispectrum only adds modest amount of S/N compared\nto that of the power spectrum.\n", "  Based on the highly improved staggered quark action, we perform lattice\nsimulations of $N_f=8$ QCD and confirm our previous observation of a\nflavor-singlet scalar meson (denoted as $\\sigma$) as light as the pion and\nvarious \"walking signals\" through low-lying spectra, with higher statistics,\nsmaller fermion masses $m_f$, and larger volumes. We measure $M_\\pi$, $F_\\pi$,\n$M_\\rho$, $M_{a_0}$, $M_{a_1}$, $M_{b_1}$, $M_N$, $M_\\sigma$, $F_\\sigma$,\n$\\langle \\bar{\\psi} \\psi\\rangle$ (both directly and through the GMOR relation),\nand the string tension. The data are consistent with the spontaneously broken\nphase of the chiral symmetry, in agreement with the previous results: ratios of\nthe quantities to $M_\\pi$ monotonically increase in the smaller $m_f$ region\ntowards the chiral limit similarly to $N_f=4$ QCD, in sharp contrast to\n$N_f=12$ QCD where the ratios become flattened. The hyperscaling relation holds\nwith roughly a universal value of the anomalous dimension, $\\gamma_m \\simeq 1$,\nwith a notable exception of $M_\\pi$ with $\\gamma_m \\simeq 0.6$ as in the\nprevious results. This is a salient feature (\"walking signal\") of $N_f=8$,\nunlike either $N_f=4$ which has no hyperscaling relation at all, or $N_f=12$\nQCD which exhibits universal hyperscaling. We further confirm the previous\nobservation of the light $\\sigma$ with mass comparable to the pion in the\nstudied $m_f$ region. In a chiral limit extrapolation of the $\\sigma$ mass\nusing the dilaton chiral perturbation theory and also using the simple linear\nfit, we find the value consistent with the 125 GeV Higgs boson within errors.\nOur results suggest that the theory could be a good candidate for walking\ntechnicolor model, having anomalous dimension $\\gamma_m \\simeq 1$ and a light\nflavor-singlet scalar meson as a technidilaton, which can be identified with\nthe 125 GeV composite Higgs in $N_f=8$ one-family model.\n", "  We consider `twin supergravities' - pairs of supergravities with\n$\\mathcal{N}_+$ and $\\mathcal{N}_-$ supersymmetries,\n$\\mathcal{N}_+>\\mathcal{N}_-$, with identical bosonic sectors - in the context\nof tensoring super Yang-Mills multiplets. It is demonstrated that the pairs of\ntwin supergravity theories are related through their left and right super\nYang-Mills factors. This procedure generates new theories from old. In\nparticular, the matter coupled $\\mathcal{N}_-$ twins in $D=3,5,6$ and the\n$\\mathcal{N}_-=1$ twins in $D=4$ have not, as far as we are aware, been\nobtained previously using the double-copy construction, adding to the growing\nlist of double-copy constructible theories. The use of fundamental matter\nmultiplets in the double-copy construction leads us to introduce a\nbi-fundamental scalar that couples to the well-known bi-adjoint scalar field.\nIt is also shown that certain matter coupled supergravities admit more than one\nfactorisation into left and right super Yang-Mills-matter theories.\n", "  We present 160 new trigonometric parallaxes for 151 M dwarf systems from the\nREsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars (RECONS) group's long-term\nastrometry/photometry program at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m telescope. Most systems\n(124 or 82%) are found to lie within 25 pc. The stars have 119 mas/yr < mu <\n828 mas/yr and 3.85 < (V-K) < 8.47. Among these are 58 systems from the\nSuperCOSMOS-RECONS (SCR) search, discovered via our proper motion trawls of the\nSuperCOSMOS digitized archival photographic plates, while the remaining stars\nwere suspected via photometric distance estimates to lie nearby. Sixteen are\nsystems that are newly discovered via astrometric perturbations to be binaries,\nmany of which are ideal for accurate mass determinations due to their proximity\nand orbital periods on the order of a decade. A variability analysis of the\nstars presented, two-thirds of which are new results, shows six of the stars to\nvary by more than 20 mmag. This effort brings the total number of parallaxes\nfor M dwarf systems measured by RECONS to nearly 500 and increases by 26% the\nnumber of southern M dwarf systems with accurate trigonometric parallaxes\nplacing them within 25 pc.\n", "  We study the problem of designing optical receivers to discriminate between\nmultiple coherent states using coherent processing receivers---i.e., one that\nuses arbitrary coherent feedback control and quantum-noise-limited direct\ndetection---which was shown by Dolinar to achieve the minimum error probability\nin discriminating any two coherent states. We first derive and re-interpret\nDolinar's binary-hypothesis minimum-probability-of-error receiver as the one\nthat optimizes the information efficiency at each time instant, based on\nrecursive Bayesian updates within the receiver. Using this viewpoint, we\npropose a natural generalization of Dolinar's receiver design to discriminate\n$M$ coherent states each of which could now be a codeword, i.e., a sequence of\n$N$ coherent states each drawn from a modulation alphabet. We analyze the\nchannel capacity of the pure-loss optical channel with a general\ncoherent-processing receiver in the low-photon number regime and compare it\nwith the capacity achievable with direct detection and the Holevo limit\n(achieving the latter would require a quantum joint-detection receiver). We\nshow compelling evidence that despite the optimal performance of Dolinar's\nreceiver for the binary coherent-state hypothesis test (either in error\nprobability or mutual information), the asymptotic communication rate\nachievable by such a coherent-processing receiver is only as good as direct\ndetection. This suggests that in the infinitely-long codeword limit, all\npotential benefits of coherent processing at the receiver can be obtained by\ndesigning a good code and direct detection, with no feedback within the\nreceiver.\n", "  We study the modified Reissner Nordstrom metric in the unimodular gravity. So\nfar the spherical symmetric Einstein field equation in unimodular gravity has\nbeen studied in the absence of any source. We consider static electric and\nmagnetic charge as source. We solve for Maxwell equations in unimodular\ngravitational background. We show that in unimodular gravity the\nelectromagnetic field strength tensor is modified. We also show that the\nsolution in unimodular gravity differs from the usual R-N metric in Einstein\ngravity with some corrections. We further study the thermodynamical properties\nof the R-N black-hole solution in this theory.\n", "  The diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (DGSE) is the most important\ndiffuse foreground component for future cosmological 21-cm observations. The\nDGSE is also an important probe of the cosmic ray electron and magnetic field\ndistributions in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. In this\npaper we briefly review the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) which can be used\nto quantify the angular power spectrum of the sky signal directly from the\nvisibilities measured in radio-interferometric observations. The salient\nfeatures of the TGE are (1.) it deals with the gridded data which makes it\ncomputationally very fast (2.) it avoids a positive noise bias which normally\narises from the system noise inherent to the visibility data, and (3.) it\nallows us to taper the sky response and thereby suppresses the contribution\nfrom unsubtracted point sources in the outer parts and the sidelobes of the\nantenna beam pattern. We also summarize earlier work where the TGE was used to\nmeasure the C_l of the DGSE using 150 MHz GMRT data. Earlier measurements of\nthe angular power spectrum are restricted to smaller angular multipole l ~ 10^3\nfor the DGSE, the signal at the larger l values is dominated by the residual\npoint sources after source subtraction. The higher sensitivity of the upcoming\nSKA1 Low will allow the point sources to be subtracted to a fainter level than\npossible with existing telescopes. We predict that it will be possible to\nmeasure the angular power spectrum of the DGSE to larger values of l with SKA1\nLow. Our results show that it should be possible to achieve l_{max} ~ 10^4 and\n~ 10^5 with 2 minutes and 10 hours of observations respectively.\n", "  We study the magnetic field evolution of an isolated spiral galaxy, using\nisolated Milky Way-mass galaxy formation simulations and a novel prescription\nfor magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) supernova feedback. Our main result is that a\ngalactic dynamo can be seeded and driven by supernova explosions, resulting in\nmagnetic fields whose strength and morphology is consistent with observations.\nIn our model, supernovae supply thermal energy, and a low level magnetic field\nalong with their ejecta. The thermal expansion drives turbulence, which serves\na dual role by efficiently mixing the magnetic field into the interstellar\nmedium, and amplifying it by means of turbulent dynamo. The computational\nprescription for MHD supernova feedback has been implemented within the\npublicly available ENZO code, and is fully described in this paper. This\nimproves upon ENZO's existing modules for hydrodynamic feedback from stars and\nactive galaxies. We find that the field attains $\\mu G$-levels over Gyr-time\nscales throughout the disk. The field also develops large-scale structure,\nwhich appears to be correlated with the disk's spiral arm density structure. We\nfind that seeding of the galactic dynamo by supernova ejecta predicts a\npersistent correlation between gas metallicity and magnetic field strength. We\nalso generate all-sky maps of the Faraday rotation measure from the\nsimulation-predicted magnetic field, and present a direct comparison with\nobservations.\n", "  The low-energy sector of QCD with $N_f = 2\\!+\\!1$ dynamical quark flavors at\nnon-vanishing chemical potential and temperature is studied with a\nnon-perturbative functional renormalization group method. The analysis is\nperformed in different truncations in order to explore fluctuation-induced\nmodifications of the quark-meson correlations as well as quark and meson\npropagators on the chiral phase transition of QCD. Depending on the chosen\ntruncation significant quantitative implications on the phase transition are\nfound. In the chirally symmetric phase, the quark flavor composition of the\npseudoscalar $(\\eta,\\eta^{\\prime})$-meson complex turns out to be drastically\nsensitive to fluctuation-induced modifications in the presence of the axial\n$U(1)_A$ anomaly. This has important phenomenological consequences for the\nassignment of chiral partners to these mesons.\n", "  Orthorhombic GdFeO$_3$ has attracted considerable attention in recent years\nbecause its magnetic structure is similar to that in the well-known BiFeO$_3$\nmaterial. We investigate electronic structure, magnetism, and optical\nproperties of the orthorhombic GdFeO$_3$ in terms of density-functional-theory\ncalculations. The modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) exchange potential is adopted to\nimprove on the description of the electronic structure. Our calculation show\nthat the G-type antiferromagnetic (G-AFM ordering of Fe spins) phase of\northorhombic GdFeO$_3$ is stable compared to other magnetic phases. The\nsemiconductor gap calculated with mBJ, substantially larger than that with GGA,\nis in good agreement with recent experimental values. Besides, we also\ninvestigate effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the electronic structure, and\ncalculate with mBJ the complex dielectric functions and other optical functions\nof photon energy. The magnetic exchange interactions are also investigated,\nwhich gives a Neel temperature close to experimental observation. For\ncomparison towards supporting our results, we study the electronic structure of\nrhombohedral (R3c) BiFeO$_3$ with mBJ. These lead to a satisfactory theoretical\nunderstanding of the electronic structure, magnetism, and optical properties of\northorhombic GdFeO$_3$ and can help elucidate electronic structures and optical\nproperties of other similar materials.\n", "  We present FormTracer, a high-performance, general purpose, easy-to-use\nMathematica tracing package which uses FORM. It supports arbitrary space and\nspinor dimensions as well as an arbitrary number of simple compact Lie groups.\nWhile keeping the usability of the Mathematica interface, it relies on the\nefficiency of FORM. An additional performance gain is achieved by a\ndecomposition algorithm that avoids redundant traces in the product tensors\nspaces. FormTracer supports a wide range of syntaxes which endows it with a\nhigh flexibility. Mathematica notebooks that automatically install the package\nand guide the user through performing standard traces in space-time, spinor and\ngauge-group spaces are provided.\n", "  We ask how the inclusion of various physical heating processes due to the\nmetal content of gas affect the evolution of massive galaxies and compute a\nsuite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that follow these systems and\ntheir supermassive black holes. We use a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code\nwith a pressure-entropy formulation and a more accurate treatment of the metal\nproduction, turbulent diffusion and cooling rate based on individual element\nabundances. The feedback models include (1) AGN feedback via high velocity BAL\nwinds and Compton/photoionization heating, (2) explicit stellar feedback from\nmultiple processes including powerful winds from supernova events, stellar\nwinds from young massive stars and AGB stars as well as radiative heating\nwithin Stromgren spheres around massive stars, and (3) additional heating\neffects due to the presence of metals including grain photoelectric heating,\nmetallicity dependent X-ray heating by nearby accreting black holes and from\nthe cosmic X-ray background, which are the major improvement in our feedback\nmodel. With a suite of zoom-in simulations of 30 halos with $M_{vir} \\sim\n10^{12-13.4}$, we show that energy and momentum budget from all feedback\neffects generate realistic galaxy properties. We explore the detailed role of\neach feedback model with three additional sets of simulations with varying\ninput physics. We show that the metal induced heating mechanisms reduce the\nfraction of accreted stellar material by mainly suppressing the growth of\ndiffuse small stellar systems at high redshift but overall have a relatively\nminor effect on the final stellar and gas properties of massive galaxies. The\ninclusion of AGN feedback significantly improves the ability of our\ncosmological simulations to yield realistic gas and stellar properties of\nmassive galaxies with reasonable fraction of the final stellar mass accreted\nfrom other galaxies.\n", "  We analyze vector meson - vector meson scattering in a unitarized chiral\ntheory based on a chiral covariant framework. We show that a pole assigned to\nthe the scalar meson $f_0(1370)$ can be dynamically generated from the\n$\\rho\\rho$ interaction, while this is not the case for the tensor meson\n$f_2(1270)$ as found in earlier works. We show that the generation of the\ntensor state is untenable due to an artefact of the extreme non-relativistic\nkinematics used before. We further consider the effects arising from the\ncoupling of channels with different orbital angular momenta. We suggest to use\nthe formalism outlined here to obtain more reliable results for the dynamical\ngeneration of resonances in the vector-vector interaction.\n", "  We evaluate the dimensionless non-Gaussianity parameter $h_{_{\\rm NL}}$, that\ncharacterizes the amplitude of the tensor bispectrum, numerically for a class\nof two field inflationary models such as double inflation, hybrid inflation and\naligned natural inflation. We compare the numerical results with the slow roll\nresults which can be obtained analytically. In the context of double inflation,\nwe also investigate the effects on $h_{_{\\rm NL}}$ due to curved trajectories\nin the field space. We explicitly examine the validity of the consistency\nrelation governing the tensor bispectrum in the squeezed limit. Lastly, we\ndiscuss the contribution to $h_{_{\\rm NL}}$ due to the epoch of preheating in\ntwo field models.\n", "  The periodically driven quantum Ising chain has recently attracted a large\nattention in the context of Floquet engineering. In addition to the common\nparamagnet and ferromagnet, this driven model can give rise to new topological\nphases. In this work we systematically explore its quantum phase diagram, by\nexamining the properties of its Floquet ground state. We specifically focus on\ndriving protocols with time-reversal invariant points, and demonstrate the\nexistence of an infinite number of distinct phases. These phases are separated\nby second-order quantum phase transitions, accompanied by continuous changes of\nlocal and string order parameters, as well as sudden changes of a topological\nwinding number and of the number of protected edge states. When one of these\nphase transitions is adiabatically crossed, the correlator associated to the\norder parameter is nonvanishing over a length scale which shows a Kibble-Zurek\nscaling. In some phases, the Floquet ground state spontaneously breaks the\ndiscrete time-translation symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Our findings provide a\nbetter understanding of topological phases in periodically driven clean\nintegrable models.\n", "  The possible Fermi detection of an electromagnetic counterpart to the double\nblack hole merger GW150914 has inspired many theoretical models, some of which\npropose that the holes spiraled together inside a massive star. However, we\nshow that the heat produced by the dynamical friction on such black hole orbits\ncan exceed the stellar binding energy by a large factor, which means that this\nheat could destroy the star and thus make it difficult for enough gas to be\nnear the holes at merger to produce detectable photons. These considerations\nmust be taken into account when models are proposed for electromagnetic\ncounterparts to the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. We find that\nonly when the two black holes form very close to the center can the star avoid\ndestruction. In that case, dynamical friction can make the black holes coalesce\nfaster than they would in vacuum, which leads to a modification of the\ngravitational waveform that is potentially observable by advanced LIGO.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the spin wave (magnon) excitations in a\nclassical antiferromagnetic spin chain with easy-axis anisotropy. We obtain a\nDirac-like equation by linearizing the Landau- Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in\nthis antiferromagnetic system, in contrast to the ferromagnetic system in which\na Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation is derived. The Hamiltonian operator in the\nDirac-like equation is a pseudo-Hermitian. We compute and demonstrate the\nrelativistic Zitterbewegung (trembling motion) in the antiferromagnetic spin\nchain by measuring the expectation values of the wave packet position.\n", "  The gedanken experiment by Wald to destroy a black hole using a test particle\nin the equatorial plane is adopted to the case of extremal magnetized black\nholes. We find the presence of external magnetic fields resulting from the\n\"Ernst magnetization\" permits a test particle to have strong enough energy to\ndestroy the black hole. However, the corresponding effective potentials show\nthat such particles would never reach the horizon.\n", "  Recent numerical relativity simulations within the\nEinstein--Maxwell--(charged-)Klein-Gordon (EMcKG) system have shown that the\nnon-linear evolution of a superradiantly unstable Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black\nhole (BH) enclosed in a cavity, leads to the formation of a BH with scalar\nhair. Perturbative evidence for the stability of such hairy BHs has been\nindependently established, confirming they are the true endpoints of the\nsuperradiant instability. The same EMcKG system admits also charged scalar\nsoliton-type solutions, which can be either stable or unstable. Using numerical\nrelativity techniques, we provide evidence that the time evolution of some of\nthese $\\textit{unstable}$ solitons leads, again, to the formation of a hairy\nBH. In some other cases, unstable solitons evolve into a (bald)\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om BH. These results establish that the system admits two\ndistinct channels to form hairy BHs at the threshold of superradiance: growing\nhair from an unstable (bald) BH, or growing a horizon from an unstable\n(horizonless) soliton. Some parallelism with the case of asymptotically flat\nboson stars and Kerr BHs with scalar hair is drawn.\n", "  In transition metal oxides, quantum confinement arising from a large surface\nto volume ratio often gives rise to novel physico-chemical properties at\nnanoscale. Their size dependent properties have potential applications in\ndiverse areas, including therapeutics, imaging, electronic devices,\ncommunication systems, sensors, and catalysis. We have analyzed structural,\nmagnetic, dielectric, and thermal properties of weakly ferromagnetic SmFeO3\nnanoparticles of sizes about 55 nm and 500 nm. The nano-size particles exhibit\nseveral distinct features that are neither observed in their larger-size\nvariants nor reported previously for the single crystals. In particular, for\nthe 55 nm particle, we observe six-fold enhancement of compensation\ntemperature, an unusual rise in susceptibility in the temperature range 550 to\n630 K due to spin pinning, and coupled antiferromagnetic-ferroelectric\ntransition, directly observed in the dielectric constant.\n", "  A quantum phase transition is an unequivocal signature of strongly correlated\nmany-body physics. Signatures of such phenomena are yet to be observed in\nballistic transport through quantum wires. Recent developments in quantum wires\nhave made it possible to enhance the interaction between the electrons. Here we\nshow that hitherto unexplained anticrossing between conduction energy\nsub-bands, observed in such experiments, can be explained through a simple yet\neffective discretised model which undergoes a second order quantum phase\ntransition within the Ising universality class. Accordingly, we observe how the\ncharge distribution, transverse to the direction of the wire will vary across\nthe phase transition. We show that data coming from three different samples\nwith differing electron densities and gate voltages show a remarkable universal\nscaling behavior, determined by the relevant critical exponent, which is only\npossible near a quantum phase transition.\n", "  It is known that an object translating parallel to a soft wall in a viscous\nfluid produces hydro- dynamic stresses that deform the wall, which, in turn,\nresults in a lift force on the object. Recent experiments with cylinders\nsliding under gravity near a soft incline, which confirmed theoretical\narguments for the lift force, also reported an unexplained steady-state\nrotation of the cylinders [Saintyves et al. PNAS 113(21), 2016]. Motivated by\nthese observations, we show, in the lubrication limit, that an infinite\ncylinder that translates in a viscous fluid parallel to a soft wall at constant\nspeed and separation distance must also rotate in order to remain free of\ntorque. Using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem, we show analytically that for\nsmall deformations of the elastic layer, the angular velocity of the cylinder\nscales with the cube of the sliding speed. These predictions are confirmed\nnumerically. We then apply the theory to the gravity-driven motion of a\ncylinder near a soft incline and find qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental observations, namely that a softer elastic layer results in a\ngreater angular speed of the cylinder.\n", "  We study present-day galaxy clustering in the EAGLE cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation. EAGLE's galaxy formation parameters were calibrated\nto reproduce the redshift $z=0.1$ galaxy stellar mass function, and the\nsimulation also reproduces galaxy colours well. The simulation volume is too\nsmall to correctly sample large-scale fluctuations and we therefore concentrate\non scales smaller than a few mega parsecs. We find very good agreement with\nobserved clustering measurements from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA)\nsurvey, when galaxies are binned by stellar mass, color, or luminosity.\nHowever, low-mass red-galaxies are clustered too strongly, which is at least\npartly due to limited numerical resolution. Apart from this limitation, we\nconclude that EAGLE galaxies inhabit similar dark matter haloes as observed\nGAMA galaxies, and that the radial distribution of satellite galaxies as\nfunction of stellar mass and colour is similar to that observed as well.\n", "  High-Tc pairing mechanism absent of hole-pockets in heavily electron-doped\nFeSe is one of the key unsolved problems in Fe-based superconductors. Here,\nthis problem is attacked by focusing on the higher-order many-body effects\nneglected in conventional Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. We uncover two\nsignificant many-body effects for high-Tc superconductivity: (i) Due to the\n\"vertex correction\", the dressed multiorbital Coulomb interaction acquires\nprominent orbital dependence for low-energy electrons. The dressed Coulomb\ninteraction not only induces the orbital fluctuations, but also magnifies the\nelectron-boson coupling constant. Therefore, moderate orbital fluctuations give\nstrong attractive pairing interaction. (ii) The \"multi-fluctuation-exchange\npairing process\" causes large inter-pocket attractive force, which is as\nimportant as usual single-fluctuation-exchange process. Due to these two\nsignificant effects dropped in the Migdal-Eliashberg formalism, the anisotropic\n$s_{++}$-wave state in heavily electron-doped FeSe is satisfactorily explained.\nThe proposed \"inter-electron-pocket pairing mechanism\" will enlarge Tc in other\nFe-based superconductors.\n", "  We reexamine the systematic properties of local galaxy populations, using\npublished surveys of star formation, structure, and gas content. After\nrecalibrating star formation measures, we are able to reliably measure specific\nstar formation rates well below the \"main sequence\" of star formation vs mass.\nWe find an unexpectedly large population of galaxies with star formation rates\nintermediate between vigorously star-forming main sequence galaxies and passive\ngalaxies, and with gas content disproportionately high for their star formation\nrates. Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a\ndistinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.\nWe demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural\noutcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical\nsignificance, but that the quiescent population requires additional\nastrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution\nbased on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local\ngalaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the\nevolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the\ndepletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The\nquiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas\nhas fallen below a threshold for disk stability. The evolution of galaxies\nbeyond the quiescent state to gas exhaustion requires another process, probably\nwind-driven mass loss. The SSFR distribution of the quiescent and passive\nimplies that the timescale of this process must be greater than a few Gyrs but\nless than a few tens of Gyrs. The environmental dependence of the galaxy\npopulations is consistent with recent theory suggesting that cold gas inflows\ninto galaxies are truncated at earlier times in denser environments.\n", "  High-energy emission from blazars is produced by electrons which are either\naccelerated directly (the assumption of leptonic models of blazar activity) or\nproduced in interactions of accelerated protons with matter and radiation\nfields (the assumption of hadronic models). The hadronic models predict that\ngamma-ray emission is accompanied by neutrino emission with comparable energy\nflux but with a different spectrum. We derive constraints on the hadronic\nmodels of activity of blazars imposed by non-detection of neutrino flux from a\npopulation of gamma-ray emitting blazars. We stack the gamma-ray and muon\nneutrino flux from 749 blazars situated in the declination strip above -5\ndegrees. Non-detection of neutrino flux from the stacked blazar sample rules\nout the proton induced cacade models in which the high-energy emission is\npowered by interactions of shock-accelerated proton beam in the AGN jet with\nthe ambient matter or with the radiation field of the black hole accretion\ndisk. The result remains valid also for the case of interactions in the\nscattered radiation field in the broad line region. IceCube constraint could be\navoided if the spectrum of accelerated protons is sharply peaking in the\nultra-high-energy cosmic ray range, as in the models of acceleration in the\nmagnetic reconnection regions or in the vacuum gaps of black hole\nmagnetospheres. Models based on these acceleration mechanisms are consistent\nwith the data only if characteristic energies of accelerated protons are higher\nthan 1e19 eV.\n", "  Initializing a set of qubits to a given quantum state is a basic prerequisite\nfor the physical implementation of quantum-information protocols. Here, we\ndiscuss the polarization of the electronic and nuclear spin in a single\nnitrogen vacancy center in diamond. Our initialization scheme uses a sequence\nof laser, microwave and radio-frequency pulses, and we optimize the pumping\nparameters of the laser pulse. A rate equation model is formulated that\nexplains the effect of the laser pulse on the spin system. We have\nexperimentally determined the population of the relevant spin states as a\nfunction of the duration of the laser pulse by measuring Rabi oscillations and\nRamsey-type free-induction decays. The experimental data have been analyzed to\ndetermine the pumping rates of the rate equation model.\n", "  Harnessing the unique properties of quantum mechanics offers the possibility\nto deliver new technologies that can fundamentally outperform their classical\ncounterparts. These technologies only deliver advantages when components\noperate with performance beyond specific thresholds. For optical quantum\nmetrology, the biggest challenge that impacts on performance thresholds is\noptical loss. Here we demonstrate how including an optical delay and an optical\nswitch in a feed-forward configuration with a stable and efficient correlated\nphoton pair source reduces the detector efficiency required to enable quantum\nenhanced sensing down to the detection level of single photons. When the switch\nis active, we observe a factor of improvement in precision of 1.27 for\ntransmission measurement on a per input photon basis, compared to the\nperformance of a laser emitting an ideal coherent state and measured with the\nsame detection efficiency as our setup. When the switch is inoperative, we\nobserve no quantum advantage.\n", "  Within the extension of MSSM by two right handed neutrinos, which masses are\ndegenerate at tree level, we address the issue of leptogenesis. Investigating\nthe quantum corrections in details, we show that the lepton asymmetry is\ninduced at 1-loop level and decisive role is played by the tau lepton Yukawa\ncoupling. On a concrete and predictive neutrino model, which enables to predict\nthe CP violating $\\delta $ phase and relate it to the cosmological CP\nasymmetry, we demonstrate that the needed amount of the baryon asymmetry is\ngenerated via the resonant leptogenesis.\n", "  We propose Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods for solving the\nfrequency-domain Maxwell's equations coupled to the Nonlocal Hydrodynamic Drude\n(NHD) and Generalized Nonlocal Optical Response (GNOR) models, which are\nemployed to describe the optical properties of nano-plasmonic scatterers and\nwaveguides. Brief derivations for both the NHD model and the GNOR model are\npresented. The formulations of the HDG method are given, in which we introduce\ntwo hybrid variables living only on the skeleton of the mesh. The local field\nsolutions are expressed in terms of the hybrid variables in each element. Two\nconservativity conditions are globally enforced to make the problem solvable\nand to guarantee the continuity of the tangential component of the electric\nfield and the normal component of the current density. Numerical results show\nthat the proposed HDG methods converge at optimal rate. We benchmark our\nimplementation and demonstrate that the HDG method has the potential to solve\ncomplex nanophotonic problems.\n", "  Motivated by the flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetry for unifying the flavor\nphysics and string theory, we construct an explicit model by introducing a\n$U(1)$ symmetry such that the $U(1)_X$-$[gravity]^2$ anomaly-free condition\ntogether with the standard model flavor structure demands additional sterile\nneutrinos as well as no axionic domain-wall problem. Such additional sterile\nneutrinos play the role of a realization of baryogenesis via a new Affleck-Dine\nleptogenesis. We provide grounds for that the $U(1)_X$ symmetry could be\ninterpreted as a fundamental symmetry of nature. The model will resolve rather\nrecent, but fast-growing issues in astro-particle physics, including leptonic\nmixings and CP violation in neutrino oscillation, high-energy neutrinos, QCD\naxion, and axion cooling of stars. The QCD axion decay constant, through its\nconnection to the astrophysical constraints of stellar evolution and the SM\nfermion masses, is shown to be fixed at $F_A=1.30^{+0.66}_{-0.54}\\times10^{9}$\nGeV (consequently, its mass is $m_a=4.34^{+3.37}_{-1.49}$ meV and axion-photon\ncoupling is $|g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}|=1.30^{+1.01}_{-0.45}\\times10^{-12}\\,{\\rm\nGeV}^{-1}$). Interestingly enough, we show that neutrino oscillations at low\nenergies could be connected to astronomical-scale baseline neutrino\noscillations. The model predicts non-observational neutrinoless double beta\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay rate as well as a remarkable pattern between leptonic\nDirac CP phase ($\\delta_{CP}$) and atmospheric mixing angle ($\\theta_{23}$);\n{\\it e.g.} $\\delta_{CP}\\simeq220^{\\circ}-240^{\\circ}$,\n$120^{\\circ}-140^{\\circ}$ for $\\theta_{23}=42.3^{\\circ}$ for normal mass\nordering, and $\\delta_{CP}\\simeq283^{\\circ},250^{\\circ},100^{\\circ},70^{\\circ}$\nfor $\\theta_{23}=49.5^{\\circ}$ for inverted one.\n", "  We point out that a face-centered cubic (FCC) optical lattice, which can be\nrealised by a simple scheme using three lasers, provides one a highly\ncontrollable platform for creating Weyl points and topological nodal\nsuperfluids in ultracold atoms. In non-interacting systems, Weyl points\nautomatically arise in the Floquet band structure when shaking such FCC\nlattices, and sophisticated design of the tunnelling is not required. More\ninterestingly, in the presence of attractive interaction between two hyperfine\nspin states, which experience the same shaken FCC lattice, a three-dimensional\ntopological nodal superfluid emerges, and Weyl points show up as the gapless\npoints in the quasiparticle spectrum. One could either create a double Weyl\npoint of charge 2, or split it to two Weyl points of charge 1, which can be\nmoved in the momentum space by tuning the interactions. Correspondingly, the\nFermi arcs at the surface may be linked with each other or separated as\nindividual ones.\n", "  A holographic field theory on a fixed black hole background has a\ngravitational dual represented by a black funnel or a black droplet. These\nstates are \"detuned\" when the temperature of the field theory near the horizon\ndoes not match the temperature of the background black hole. In particular, the\ngravitational dual to the Boulware state must be a detuned solution. We\nconstruct detuned droplets and funnels dual to a Schwarzschild background and\nshow that the Boulware phase is represented by a droplet. We also construct\nhairy black droplets associated to a low-temperature scalar condensation\ninstability and show that they are thermodynamically preferred to their\nhairless counterparts.\n", "  The optimization of laser resonators represents a crucial issue for the\ndesign of terahertz semiconductor lasers with high gain and low absorption\nloss. In this paper, we put forward and optimize the surface plasmonic metal\nwaveguide geometry for the recently proposed terahertz injection laser based on\nresonant radiative transitions between tunnel-coupled grapheme layers. We find\nan optimal number of active graphene layer pairs corresponding to the maximum\nnet modal gain. The maximum gain increases with frequency and can be as large\nas ~ 500 cm-1 at 8 THz, while the threshold length of laser resonator can be as\nsmall as ~ 50 mkm. Our findings substantiate the possibility of ultra-compact\nvoltage-tunable graphene-based lasers operating at room temperature.\n", "  Metamaterials with the transformation method has greatly promoted the\ndevelopment in achieving invisibility and illusion for various classical waves.\nHowever, the requirement of tailor-made bulk materials and extreme constitutive\nparameters associated to illusion designs hampers its further progress.\nInspired by recent demonstrations of metasurfaces in achieving reduced versions\nof electromagnetic cloaks, we propose and experimentally demonstrate source\nillusion devices to manipulate flexural waves using metasurfaces. The approach\nis particularly useful for elastic waves due to the lack of form-invariance in\nusual transformation methods. We demonstrate metasurfaces for shifting,\ntransforming and splitting a point source with \"space-coiling\" structures. The\neffects are found to be broadband and robust against a change of source\nposition, with agreement from numerical simulations and Huygens-Fresnel theory.\nThe proposed approach provides an avenue to generically manipulate guided\nelastic waves in solids, and is potentially useful for applications such as\nnon-destructive testing, enhanced sensing and imaging.\n", "  The physical origin of resonant Wood's anomalies in the reflection spectra of\nthree-dimensional (3D) opaline photonic crystals covered with\nGe$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST225) is discussed. For this purpose, the optical\nreflection spectra are studied for different incident angles of light both\nexperimentally and theoretically. The performed eigenmode analysis reveals that\nthe Wood's anomalies originate from the quasiguided modes which appear in the\nGST225 capping layer. This conclusion is supported by the simulated\nelectromagnetic near-field distributions of incident light at resonant\nfrequencies. The experimental reflection spectra are in a good agreement with\ntheoretical calculations performed by the Fourier modal method in the\nscattering matrix form.\n", "  We study transport across p-n junctions of gapped two-dimensional semi-Dirac\nmaterials: nodal semimetals whose energy bands disperse quadratically and\nlinearly along distinct crystal axes. The resulting electronic properties ---\nrelevant to materials such as TiO$_2$/VO$_2$ multilayers and\n$\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ salts --- continuously interpolate between those\nof mono- and bi-layer graphene as a function of propagation angle. We\ndemonstrate that tunneling across the junction depends on the orientation of\nthe tunnel barrier relative to the crystalline axes, leading to strongly\nnon-monotonic current-voltage characteristics, including negative differential\nconductance in some regimes. In multi-valley systems these features provide a\nnatural route to engineering valley-selective transport.\n", "  The angular momentum distribution in dark matter haloes and galaxies is a key\ningredient in understanding their formation. Especially, the internal\ndistribution of angular momenta is closely related to the formation of disk\ngalaxies. In this article, we use haloes identified from a high-resolution\nsimulation, the Bolshoi simulation, to study the spatial distribution of\nspecific angular momenta, $j(r,\\theta)$. We show that by stacking haloes with\nsimilar masses to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the profile can be fitted\nas a simple function, $j(r,\\theta)=j_s \\sin^2(\\theta/\\theta_s)\n(r/r_s)^2/(1+r/r_s)^4 $, with three free parameters, $j_s, r_s$, and\n$\\theta_s$. Specifically, $j_s$ correlates with the halo mass $M_\\mathrm{vir}$\nas $j_s\\propto M_\\mathrm{vir}^{2/3}$, $r_s$ has a weak dependence on the halo\nmass as $r_s \\propto M_\\mathrm{vir}^{0.040}$, and $\\theta_s$ is independent of\n$M_\\mathrm{vir}$. This profile agrees with that from a rigid shell model,\nthough its origin is unclear. Our universal specific angular momentum profile\n$j(r,\\theta)$ is useful in modelling haloes' angular momenta. Furthermore, by\nusing an empirical stellar mass - halo mass relation, we can infer the averaged\nangular momentum distribution of a dark matter halo. The specific angular\nmomentum - stellar mass relation within a halo computed from our profile is\nshown to share a similar shape as that from the observed disk galaxies.\n", "  Recently, high angular resolution imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI\nhave discovered many spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered light\nimages of protoplanetary disks. Theory and simulations have suggested that\nthese arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a\nquantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet\nmass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer\nsimulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in\ndisks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio\n($h/r$): $\\delta_{\\rm max}\\approx((M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.\nWith current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum\nplanet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\\odot$\nstar at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more\nmassive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in\nobserved disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates\nfrom a different planet. We also find only massive perturbers with at least\nmulti-Jupiter masses are capable of driving bright arms with $\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}\\gtrsim2$ as found in SAO 206462, MWC 758, and LkH$\\alpha$~330, and these\narms do not follow linear wave propagation theory. Additionally, we find the\nmorphology and contrast of the primary and secondary arms are largely\nunaffected by a modest level of viscosity with $\\alpha\\lesssim0.01$. Finally,\nthe contrast of the arms in the SAO 206462 disk suggests that the perturber SAO\n206462 b at $\\sim100$ AU is about $5-10M_{\\rm J}$ in mass.\n", "  We consider scenarios in which dark matter is a Majorana fermion which\ncouples to Standard Model fermions through the exchange of charged mediating\nparticles. The matrix elements for various dark matter annihilation processes\nare then related to one-loop corrections to the fermion-photon vertex, where\ndark matter and the charged mediators run in the loop. In particular, in the\nlimit where Standard Model fermion helicity mixing is suppressed, the cross\nsection for dark matter annihilation to various final states is related to\ncorrections to the Standard Model fermion charge form factor. These corrections\ncan be extracted in a gauge-invariant manner from collider cross sections.\nAlthough current measurements from colliders are not precise enough to provide\nuseful constraints on dark matter annihilation, improved measurements at future\nexperiments, such as the International Linear Collider, could improve these\nconstraints by several orders of magnitude, allowing them to surpass the limits\nobtainable by direct observation.\n", "  The many-body localized (MBL) phase is characterized by a complete set of\nquasi-local integrals of motion and area-law entanglement of excited\neigenstates. We study the effect of non-Abelian continuous symmetries on MBL,\nconsidering the case of $SU(2)$ symmetric disordered spin chains. The $SU(2)$\nsymmetry imposes strong constraints on the entanglement structure of the\neigenstates, precluding conventional MBL. We construct a fixed-point\nHamiltonian, which realizes a non-ergodic (but non-MBL) phase characterized by\neigenstates having logarithmic scaling of entanglement with the system size, as\nwell as an incomplete set of quasi-local integrals of motion. We study the\nresponse of such a phase to local symmetric perturbations, finding that even\nweak perturbations induce multi-spin resonances. We conclude that the\nnon-ergodic phase is generally unstable and that $SU(2)$ symmetry implies\nthermalization. The approach introduced in this work can be used to study\ndynamics in disordered systems with non-Abelian symmetries, and provides a\nstarting point for searching non-ergodic phases beyond conventional MBL.\n", "  The search for a resonant four-neutron system has been revived thanks to the\nrecent experimental hints reported in Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{116}, 052501\n(2016). The existence of such a system would deeply impact our understanding of\nnuclear matter and requires a critical investigation. In this work, we study\nthe existence of a four-neutron resonance in the quasi-stationary formalism\nusing \\textit{ab initio} techniques with various two-body chiral interactions.\nWe employ the No-Core Gamow Shell Model and the Density Matrix Renormalization\nGroup method, both supplemented by the use of natural orbitals and a new\nidentification technique for broad resonances. We demonstrate that while the\nenergy of the four-neutron system may be compatible with the experimental\nvalue, its width must be larger than the reported upper limit, supporting the\ninterpretation of the experimental observation as a reaction process too short\nto form a nucleus.\n", "  Recent observations indicate potentially carbon-rich exoplanet atmospheres.\nSpectral fitting methods for brown dwarfs and exoplanets have invoked the C/O\nratio as additional parameter but carbon-rich cloud formation modeling is a\nchallenge for the models applied. The determination of the habitable zone for\nexoplanets requires the treatment of cloud formation in chemically different\nregimes. Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may\nemerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary\nevolution. We extend our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed\nformation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by\ngas-surface reactions. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich\natmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases due to carbon being a very effective\ngrowth species. The consequence is that less particles will make up a cloud for\nC/O_0>1. The cloud particles will be smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich\natmosphere. An increasing initial C/O ratio does not revert this trend because\na much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a rich carbon\nenvironment. Cloud particles are generally made of a mix of materials: carbon\ndominates if C/O_0>1 and silicates dominate if C/O_0<1. 80-90% carbon is\nreached only in extreme cases where C/O_0=3.0 or 10.0. Carbon-rich atmospheres\nwould form clouds that are made of particles of height-dependent mixed\ncompositions, sizes and numbers. The remaining gas-phase is far less depleted\nthan in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Typical tracer molecules are HCN and C2H2 in\ncombination with a featureless, smooth continuum due to a carbonaceous cloud\ncover, unless the cloud particles become crystalline.\n", "  We present measurements of angular cross power spectra between galaxies and\noptically-selected galaxy clusters in the final photometric sample of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). We measure the auto- and cross-correlations between\ngalaxy and cluster samples, from which we extract the effective biases and\nstudy the shot noise properties. We model the non-Poissonian shot noise by\nintroducing an effective number density of tracers and fit for this quantity.\nWe find that we can only describe the cross-correlation of galaxies and galaxy\nclusters, as well as the auto-correlation of galaxy clusters, on the relevant\nscales using a non-Poissonian shot noise contribution.\n  The values of effective bias we finally measure for a volume-limited sample\nare $b_{cc}=4.09 \\pm 0.47$ for the cluster auto-correlation and $b_{gc}=2.15\n\\pm 0.09$ for the galaxy-cluster cross-correlation. We find that these results\nare consistent with expectations from the auto-correlations of galaxies and\nclusters and are in good agreement with previous studies. The main result is\ntwo-fold: firstly we provide a measurement of the cross-correlation of galaxies\nand clusters, which can be used for further cosmological analysis, and secondly\nwe describe an effective treatment of the shot noise.\n", "  The notions of error and disturbance appearing in quantum uncertainty\nrelations are often quantified by the discrepancy of a physical quantity from\nits ideal value. However, these real and ideal values are not the outcomes of\nsimultaneous measurements, and comparing the values of unmeasured observables\nis not necessarily meaningful according to quantum theory. To overcome these\nconceptual difficulties, we take a different approach and define error and\ndisturbance in an operational manner. In particular, we formulate both in terms\nof the probability that one can successfully distinguish the actual measurement\ndevice from the relevant hypothetical ideal by any experimental test\nwhatsoever. This definition itself does not rely on the formalism of quantum\ntheory, avoiding many of the conceptual difficulties of usual definitions. We\nthen derive new Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations for both joint\nmeasurability and the error-disturbance tradeoff for arbitrary observables of\nfinite-dimensional systems, as well as for the case of position and momentum.\nOur relations may be directly applied in information processing settings, for\nexample to infer that devices which can faithfully transmit information\nregarding one observable do not leak any information about conjugate\nobservables to the environment. We also show that Englert's wave-particle\nduality relation [PRL 77, 2154 (1996)] can be viewed as an error-disturbance\nuncertainty relation.\n", "  We present a theoretical study on the robustness of multi-photon states in a\nfrustrated lattice of coupled nonlinear optical cavities, which are described\nby a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we focus here on a\nLieb lattice with two elementary cells and periodic boundary conditions. Due to\nthe geometric frustration of the lattice, the non-equilibrium steady state can\nexhibit dark sites with low photon density and strong correlations, ascribable\nto the population of multi-photon modes. We explore the sensitivity of such\nstrong correlations on the random inhomogeneity of the lattice parameters. We\nshow that the correlations are more sensitive to the inhomogeneity of the\ncavity frequencies than to the random fluctuations of the hopping strength.\n", "  A deformed dielectric microcavity is used as an experimental platform for the\nanalysis of the statistics of chaotic resonances, in the perspective of testing\nfractal Weyl laws at optical frequencies. In order to surmount the difficulties\nthat arise from reading strongly overlapping spectra, we exploit the mixed\nnature of the phase space at hand, and only count the high-Q whispering-gallery\nmodes (WGMs) directly. That enables us to draw statistical information on the\nmore lossy chaotic resonances, coupled to the high-Q regular modes via\ndynamical tunneling. Three different models [classical, Random-Matrix-Theory\n(RMT) based, semiclassical] to interpret the experimental data are discussed.\nOn the basis of least-squares analysis, theoretical estimates of Ehrenfest\ntime, and independent measurements, we find that a semiclassically modified\nRMT-based expression best describes the experiment in all its realizations,\nparticularly when the resonator is coupled to visible light, while RMT alone\nstill works quite well in the infrared. In this work we reexamine and\nsubstantially extend the results of a short paper published earlier [L. Wang,\nD. Lippolis, Z.-Y. Li, X.-F. Jiang, Q. Gong, and Y.-F. Xiao, Phys. Rev. E 93,\n040201(R) (2016)].\n", "  Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model generically predict that in\nthe early universe a scalar condensate can form and fragment into Q-balls\nbefore decaying. If the Q-balls dominate the energy density for some period of\ntime, the relatively large fluctuations in their number density can lead to\nformation of primordial black holes (PBH). Other scalar fields, unrelated to\nsupersymmetry, can play a similar role. For a general charged scalar field,\nthis robust mechanism can generate black holes over the entire mass range\nallowed by observational constraints, with a sufficient abundance to account\nfor all dark matter in some parameter ranges. In the case of supersymmetry the\nmass range is limited from above by $10^{23}$g. We also comment on the role\nthat topological defects can play for PBH formation in a similar fashion.\n", "  The shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio $\\eta/s$ of the anisotropic\nsuperfluid has been calculated by means of the gauge/gravity duality in the\npresence of the {\\it dark matter} sector. The {\\it dark matter} has been\ndescribed by the Yang-Mills field analogous to the one describing visible\nmatter sector and it is assumed to interact with the visible field with\ncoupling constant $\\alpha$. Close to the superfluid transition temperature\n($T_c$) the analytical solution has been given up to the leading order in a\nsymmetry breaking parameter and the ratio of the gravitational constant and\nYang-Mils coupling. The tensor element of ratio $\\eta/s$ remains unaffected by\nthe {\\it dark matter} for the viscosity tensor in the plane perpendicular to\nthe symmetry breaking direction (here $yz$). The temperature dependence and the\nlinear correction in $(1-\\alpha)$ in the plane containing this direction (here\n$xy$) was also revealed. The correction linearly vanishes for temperature\ntending to the critical one $T\\rightarrow T_c$.\n", "  We consider the memory effect in even dimensional spacetimes of dimension $d\n\\ge 4$ arising from a burst of gravitational radiation. When $d=4$, the natural\nframes in the stationary eras before and after the burst differ by the\ncomposition of a boost and supertranslation, and this supertranslation\ncharacterizes the \"memory effect,\" i.e., the permanent displacement of test\nparticles near infinity produced by the radiation burst. However, we show that\nwhen $d > 4$, this supertranslation and the corresponding memory effect vanish.\nConsequently, when $d >4$, it is natural to impose stronger asymptotic\nconditions at null infinity that reduce the asymptotic symmetry group to the\nPoincare group. Conversely, when $d=4$, the asymptotic symmetry group at null\ninfinity must be taken to be the BMS group.\n", "  Interactions are responsible for intriguing physics, e.g. emergence of exotic\nground states and excitations, in a wide range of systems. Here we\ntheoretically demonstrate that dipole-dipole interaction leads to bosonic\neigen-excitations with average spin ranging from zero to above $\\hbar$ in\nmagnets with uniformly magnetized ground states. These exotic excitations can\nbe interpreted as quantum coherent conglomerates of spin $\\hbar$ magnons, the\neigen-excitations when the dipolar interactions are disregarded. We further\nfind that the eigenmodes in an easy-axis antiferromagnet are spin-zero\nquasiparticles instead of the widely believed spin $\\pm \\hbar$ magnons. The\nlatter re-emerge when the symmetry is broken by a sufficiently large applied\nmagnetic field. The average spin greater than $\\hbar$ is accompanied by vacuum\nfluctuations and may be considered to be a weak form of frustration.\n", "  High contrast imaging instruments such as GPI and SPHERE are discovering gap\nstructures in protoplanetary disks at an ever faster pace. Some of these gaps\nmay be opened by planets forming in the disks. In order to constrain planet\nformation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way to\nquantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in\nparticular their masses, from the observed gap properties, such as their depths\nand widths. Combing 2D and 3D hydrodynamics simulations with 3D radiative\ntransfer simulations, we investigate the morphology of planet-opened gaps in\nnear-infrared scattered light images. Quantitatively, we obtain correlations\nthat directly link intrinsic gap depths and widths in the gas surface density\nto observed depths and widths in images of disks at modest inclinations under\nfinite angular resolution. Subsequently, the properties of the surface density\ngaps enable us to derive the disk scale height at the location of the gap $h$,\nand to constrain the quantity $M_{\\rm p}^2/\\alpha$, where $M_{\\rm p}$ is the\nmass of the gap-opening planet and $\\alpha$ characterizes the viscosity in the\ngap. As examples, we examine the gaps recently imaged by VLT/SPHERE,\nGemini/GPI, and Subaru/HiCIAO in HD 97048, TW Hya, HD 169142, LkCa 15, and RX\nJ1615.3-3255. Scale heights of the disks and possible masses of the gap-opening\nplanets are derived assuming each gap is opened by a single planet. Assuming\n$\\alpha=10^{-3}$, the derived planet mass in all cases are roughly between\n0.1-1 $M_{\\rm J}$.\n", "  We investigate the ejecta from black hole - neutron star mergers by modeling\nthe formation and interaction of mass ejected in a tidal tail and a disk wind.\nThe outflows are neutron-rich, giving rise to optical/infrared emission powered\nby the radioactive decay of $r$-process elements (a kilonova). Here we perform\nan end-to-end study of this phenomenon, where we start from the output of a\nfully-relativistic merger simulation, calculate the post-merger hydrodynamical\nevolution of the ejecta and disk winds including neutrino physics, determine\nthe final nucleosynthetic yields using post-processing nuclear reaction network\ncalculations, and compute the kilonova emission with a radiative transfer code.\nWe study the effects of the tail-to-disk mass ratio by scaling the tail\ndensity. A larger initial tail mass results in fallback matter becoming mixed\ninto the disk and ejected in the subsequent disk wind. Relative to the case of\na disk without dynamical ejecta, the combined outflow has lower mean electron\nfraction, faster speed, larger total mass, and larger absolute mass free of\nhigh-opacity Lanthanides or Actinides. In most cases, the nucleosynthetic yield\nis dominated by the heavy $r$-process contribution from the unbound part of the\ntidal tail. A Solar-like abundance distribution can however be obtained when\nthe total mass of the dynamical ejecta is comparable to the mass of the disk\noutflows. The kilonova has a characteristic duration of 1 week and a luminosity\nof ~$10^{41}$ erg/s, with orientation effects leading to variations of a factor\n~2 in brightness. At early times (< 1 day) the emission includes an optical\ncomponent from the (hot) Lanthanide-rich material, but the spectrum evolves\nquickly to the infrared thereafter.\n", "  We present a tensor network especially suited for multi-orbital Anderson\nimpurity models and as an impurity solver for multi-orbital dynamical\nmean-field theory (DMFT). The solver works directly on the real-frequency axis\nand yields very high spectral resolution at all frequencies. We use a large\nnumber $\\left(\\mathcal{O}(100)\\right)$ of bath sites, and therefore achieve an\naccurate representation of the bath. The solver can treat full rotationally\ninvariant interactions with reasonable numerical effort. We show the efficiency\nand accuracy of the method by a benchmark for the testbed material SrVO$_3$.\nThere we observe multiplet structures in the high-energy spectrum which are\nalmost impossible to resolve by other multi-orbital methods. The resulting\nstructure of the Hubbard bands can be described as a broadened atomic spectrum\nwith rescaled interaction parameters. Additional features emerge when $U$ is\nincreased. The impurity solver offers a new route to the calculation of precise\nreal-frequency spectral functions of correlated materials.\n", "  We report simultaneous observations of the flaring behaviour of the\ncataclysmic variable star AE Aqr. The observations are in Johnson B and V\nbands. The colour-magnitude diagrams (B-V versus V and B-V vs. B) show that the\nstar becomes blues as it becomes brighter. In our model AE Aqr behaviour can be\nexplained with flares (fireballs) with 0.03 < B-V < 0.30 and temperature in the\ninterval 8000 < T < 12000.\n", "  We extend study of the Jaynes-Cummings model involving a pair of identical\ntwo-level atoms (or qubits) interacting with a single mode quantized field. We\ninvestigate the effects of replacing the radiation field mode with a composite\nspin, comprising $N$ qubits, or spin-1/2 particles. This model is relevant for\nphysical implementations in superconducting circuit QED, ion trap and molecular\nsystems. For the case of the composite spin prepared in a spin coherent state,\nwe demonstrate the similarities of this set-up to the qubits-field model in\nterms of the time evolution, attractor states and in particular the collapse\nand revival of the entanglement between the two qubits. We extend our analysis\nby taking into account an effect due to qubit imperfections. We consider a\ndifference (or `mismatch') in the dipole interaction strengths of the two\nqubits, for both the field mode and composite spin cases. To address\ndecoherence due to this mismatch, we then average over this coupling strength\ndifference with distributions of varying width. We demonstrate in both the\nfield mode and the composite spin scenarios that increasing the width of the\n`error' distribution increases suppression of the coherent dynamics of the\ncoupled system, including the collapse and revival of the entanglement between\nthe qubits.\n", "  The XXZ model on a square lattice in the presence of a transverse magnetic\nfield is studied within the spin wave theory to investigate the resulting\ncanted antiferromagnet. The small and large field regimes are probed separately\nboth for easy-axis and easy-plane scenarios which reveal an unentangled\nfactorized ground state at an intermediate value of the field. Goldstone modes\nare obtained for the field-free $XY$ antiferromagnet as well as for the\nisotropic antiferromagnet with field up to its saturation value. Moreover, for\nan easy-plane anisotropy, we find that there exists a non-zero field, where\nmagnon degeneracy appears as a result of restoration of an U(1) sublattice\nsymmetry and that, across that field, there occurs a magnon band crossing. For\ncompleteness, we then obtain the system phase diagram for $S=1/2$ via large\nscale quantum Monte Carlo simulations using the stochastic series expansion\ntechnique. Our numerical method is based on a quantization of spin along the\ndirection of the applied magnetic field and does not suffer from a\nsign-problem, unlike comparable algorithms based on a spin quantization along\nthe axis of anisotropy. With this formalism, we are also able to obtain powder\naverages of the transverse and longitudinal magnetizations, which may be useful\nfor understanding experimental measurements on polycrystalline samples.\n", "  We investigate the proposed duality between a quantum information metric in a\n$\\mbox{CFT}_{d+1}$ and the volume of a maximum time slice in the dual\n$\\mbox{AdS}_{d+2}$ for topological geons. Examining the specific cases of BTZ\nblack holes and planar Schwarzschild-AdS black holes, along with their geon\ncounterparts, we find that the proposed duality relation for geons is the same\napart from a factor of 4. The information metric therefore provides a probe of\nthe topology of the bulk spacetime.\n", "  We extend the CGC approach to calculation of the double inclusive gluon\nproduction by including high-density effect in the CGC wave function of the\nprojectile (proton). Our main result is that these effects lead to the\nappearance of odd harmonics in the two-particle correlation C(k,p). We find\nthat in the high momentum limit, |k|,|p|>>Q_s, this results in a positive\nc_1{2}. Additionally when the magnitudes of the two momenta are approximately\nequal, |k|/|p| ~ 1, the density effects also generate a positive third harmonic\nc_3{2}, which translates into a non-vanishing v_3 when the momenta of the\ntrigger and associated particle are in the same momentum bin. The sign of\nc_3{2} becomes negative when |k|/|p|>1.1 suggesting an interesting experimental\nsignature.\n", "  We investigate opinion spreading by a threshold model in a situation where\nthe influence of people is heterogeneously distributed. We focus on the\nresponse of the average opinion as a function between the trend between\nout-degree (number of neighbors)---effectively the strength of influence of a\nnode---and the threshold for adopting a new product or opinion. We find that if\nthe coupling is very positive, the final state of the system will be a mix of\ndifferent opinions otherwise it will it converges to a consensus state. We find\nthat this cannot be simply explained as a phase transition, but emerges from a\ncombination of mechanisms and their relative dominance in different regions of\nparameter space.\n", "  We present evidence for halo assembly bias as a function of geometric\nenvironment. By classifying GAMA galaxy groups as residing in voids, sheets,\nfilaments or knots using a tidal tensor method, we find that low-mass haloes\nthat reside in knots are older than haloes of the same mass that reside in\nvoids. This result provides direct support to theories that link strong halo\ntidal interactions with halo assembly times. The trend with geometric\nenvironment is reversed at large halo mass, with haloes in knots being younger\nthan haloes of the same mass in voids. We find a clear signal of halo\ndownsizing - more massive haloes host galaxies that assembled their stars\nearlier. This overall trend holds independently of geometric environment. We\nsupport our analysis with an in-depth exploration of the L-Galaxies\nsemi-analytic model, used here to correlate several galaxy properties with\nthree different definitions of halo formation time. We find a complex\nrelationship between halo formation time and galaxy properties, with\nsignificant scatter. We confirm that stellar mass to halo mass ratio, specific\nstar-formation rate and mass-weighed age are reasonable proxies of halo\nformation time, especially at low halo masses. Instantaneous star-formation\nrate is a poor indicator at all halo masses. Using the same semi-analytic\nmodel, we create mock spectral observations using complex star-formation and\nchemical enrichment histories, that approximately mimic GAMA's typical\nsignal-to-noise and wavelength range. We use these mocks to assert how well\npotential proxies of halo formation time may be recovered from GAMA-like\nspectroscopic data.\n", "  Tip-streaming generates micron- and submicron- sized droplets when a thin\nthread pulled from the pointy end of a drop disintegrates. Here, we report\nstreaming from the equator of a drop placed in a uniform electric field. The\ninstability generates concentric fluid rings encircling the drop, which break\nup to form an array of microdroplets in the equatorial plane. We show that the\nstreaming results from an interfacial instability at the stagnation line of the\nelectrohydrodynamic flow, which creates a sharp rim. The flow draws from the\nrim a thin sheet which destabilizes and sheds fluid cylinders. This streaming\nphenomenon provides a new route for generating monodisperse microemulsions.\n", "  Cells and tissues exert forces and can actively change shape. This strikingly\nautonomous behavior is powered by the cytoskeleton, which includes an active\ngel of actin filaments, crosslinks, and myosin molecular motors. Although\nindividual motors are only a few nm in size and exert minute forces of a few\npN, cells spatially integrate the activity of an ensemble of motors to produce\nlarger contractile forces (order nN and greater) on cellular, tissue, and\norganismal length scales (order 10 ${\\mu}$m and greater). Experimental studies\nof reconstituted active-network model systems have long suggested that a\nmechanical interplay between the network's connectivity and motor activity\ndominates contractile behavior. Recent theoretical models indicate that this\ninterplay can be understood in terms of percolation models, where the network\nconnectivity is influenced by motor activity. Here we review experimental and\ntheoretical studies of model contractile active gels and propose a state\ndiagram that unites a large body of experimental and theoretical observations\nbased on concepts from percolation theory.\n", "  We use the latest HII galaxy measurements to determine the value of $H_0$\nadopting a combination of model-dependent and model-independent method. By\nconstraining five cosmological models, we find that the obtained values of\n$H_0$ are more consistent with the recent local measurement by Riess et al.\n2016 (hereafter R16) at $1\\sigma$ confidence level, and that these five models\nprefer a higher best-fit value of $H_0$ than R16's result. To check the\ncorrectness of $H_0$ values obtained by model-dependent method, for the first\ntime, we implement the model-independent Gaussian processes (GP) using the HII\ngalaxy measurements. We find that the GP reconstructions also prefer a higher\nvalue of $H_0$ than R16's result. Therefore, we conclude that the current HII\ngalaxy measurements support a higher cosmic expansion rate.\n", "  Detailed balance is often invoked in discussions of nuclear weak transitions\nin astrophysical environments. Satisfaction of detailed balance is rightly\ntouted as a virtue of some methods of computing nuclear transition strengths,\nbut we argue that it need not necessarily be strictly obeyed, especially when\nthe system is far from weak equilibrium. We present the results of shell model\ncalculations of nuclear weak strengths in both charged current and neutral\ncurrent channels at astrophysical temperatures. Using these strengths to\ncompute some reaction rates, we find that, despite some violation of detailed\nbalance, our method is robust up to high temperature, and we comment on the\nrelationship between detailed balance and weak equilibrium in astrophysical\nconditions.\n", "  In 2013, Henn proposed a special basis for a certain class of master\nintegrals, which are expressible in terms of iterated integrals. In this basis,\nthe master integrals obey a differential equation, where the right hand side is\nproportional to $\\epsilon$ in $d=4-2\\epsilon$ space-time dimensions. An\nalgorithmic approach to find such a basis was found by Lee. We present the tool\nepsilon, an efficient implementation of Lee's algorithm based on the Fermat\ncomputer algebra system as computational backend.\n", "  A conventional superconductor with spin-orbit coupling turns into a\ntopological superconductor beyond a critical strength of the Zeeman energy. The\nspin-expectation values $\\mathbf{S}(\\mathbf{k})$ in momentum space trace this\ntransition via a characteristic change in the topological character of the spin\ntexture within the Brillouin zone. At the transition the skyrmion counting\nnumber switches from 0 to 1/2 identifying the topological superconductor via\nits meron-like spin texture. The change in the skyrmion counting number is\ncrucially controlled by singular points of the map\n$\\mathbf{S}(\\mathbf{k})/|\\mathbf{S}(\\mathbf{k})|$ from the Brillouin zone, i.e.\na torus, to the unit sphere. The complexity of this spin-map is discussed at\nzero temperature as well as for the extension to finite temperatures.\n", "  Originally proposed as a tool for teaching the general theory of relativity,\nwormholes are today approached in many different ways and are seeing as an\nefficient alternative for interstellar and time travel. Attempts to achieve\nobservational signatures of wormholes have been growing as the subject has\nbecame more and more popular. In this article we investigate some $f(R,T)$\ntheoretical predictions for static wormholes, i.e., wormholes whose throat\nradius can be considered a constant. Since the $T$-dependence in $f(R,T)$\ngravity is due to the consideration of quantum effects, a further investigation\nof wormholes in such a theory is well motivated. We obtain the energy\nconditions of static wormholes in $f(R,T)$ gravity and apply an analytical\napproach to find the solutions. We highlight that our results are in agreement\nwith previous solutions presented in the literature.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the preheating mechanism in a\ndisformally-coupled inflationary model where the scalar field $\\phi$ (which is\nthe inflaton field) naturally coupled to another matter field $\\chi$ induced by\nthe disformal transformation. In the present scenario, novel derivative\ninteractions mixing the kinetic terms of the two fields emerge inherently. We\nstart by deriving the evolution of the background system when the back reaction\non the background field is neglected. We examine the particle production due to\nparametric resonances in the models and find in Minkowski space that the stage\nof parametric resonances can be described by the Mathieu equation.\nInterestingly, we discover that broad resonances in our models can be typically\nachieved. Finally, we compare our results with previously studied model with\nderivative couplings.\n", "  We image the remnant magnetization configurations of CoFeB and permalloy\nnanotubes (NTs) using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism photo-emission electron\nmicroscopy. The images provide direct evidence for flux-closure configurations,\nincluding a global vortex state, in which magnetization points\ncircumferentially around the NT axis. Furthermore, micromagnetic simulations\npredict and measurements confirm that vortex states can be programmed as the\nequilibrium remnant magnetization configurations by reducing the NT aspect\nratio.\n", "  Resolving Orbital and Climate Keys of Earth and Extraterrestrial Environments\nwith Dynamics (ROCKE-3D) is a 3-Dimensional General Circulation Model (GCM)\ndeveloped at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies for the modeling of\natmospheres of Solar System and exoplanetary terrestrial planets. Its parent\nmodel, known as ModelE2 (Schmidt et al. 2014), is used to simulate modern and\n21st Century Earth and near-term paleo-Earth climates. ROCKE-3D is an ongoing\neffort to expand the capabilities of ModelE2 to handle a broader range of\natmospheric conditions including higher and lower atmospheric pressures, more\ndiverse chemistries and compositions, larger and smaller planet radii and\ngravity, different rotation rates (slowly rotating to more rapidly rotating\nthan modern Earth, including synchronous rotation), diverse ocean and land\ndistributions and topographies, and potential basic biosphere functions. The\nfirst aim of ROCKE-3D is to model planetary atmospheres on terrestrial worlds\nwithin the Solar System such as paleo-Earth, modern and paleo-Mars,\npaleo-Venus, and Saturn's moon Titan. By validating the model for a broad range\nof temperatures, pressures, and atmospheric constituents we can then expand its\ncapabilities further to those exoplanetary rocky worlds that have been\ndiscovered in the past and those to be discovered in the future. We discuss the\ncurrent and near-future capabilities of ROCKE-3D as a community model for\nstudying planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres.\n", "  The repulsion between free electrons inside a metal makes its optical\nresponse spatially dispersive, so that it is not described by Drude's model but\nby a hydrodynamic model. We give here fully analytic results for a metallic\nslab in this framework, thanks to a two-modes cavity formalism leading to a\nFabry-Perot formula, and show that a simplification can be made that preserves\nthe accuracy of the results while allowing much simpler analytic expressions.\nFor metallic layers thicker than 2.7 nm modified Fresnel coefficients can\nactually be used to accurately predict the response of any multilayer with\nspatially dispersive metals (for reflection, transmission or the guided modes).\nFinally, this explains why adding a small dielectric layer[Y. Luo et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 111, 093901 (2013)] allows to reproduce the effects of nonlocality\nin many cases, and especially for multilayers.\n", "  Full ray-tracing maps of gravitational lensing, constructed from N-Body\nsimulations, represent a fundamental tool to interpret present and future weak\nlensing data. However the limitation of computational resources and storage\ncapabilities severely restrict the number of realizations that can be performed\nin order to accurately sample both the cosmic shear models and covariance\nmatrices. In this paper we present a halo model formalism for weak\ngravitational lensing that alleviates these issues by producing weak-lensing\nmocks at a reduced computational cost. Our model takes as input the halo\npopulation within a desired light-cone and the linear power spectrum of the\nunderlined cosmological model. We examine the contribution given by the\npresence of substructures within haloes to the cosmic shear power spectrum and\nquantify it to the percent level. Our method allows us to reconstruct\nhigh-resolution convergence maps, for any desired source redshifts, of\nlight-cones that realistically trace the matter density distribution in the\nuniverse, account for masked area and sample selections. We compare our\nanalysis on the same large scale structures constructed using ray-tracing\ntechniques and find very good agreements both in the linear and non-linear\nregimes up to few percent levels. The accuracy and speed of our method\ndemonstrate the potential of our halo model for weak lensing statistics and the\npossibility to generate a large sample of convergence maps for different\ncosmological models as needed for the analysis of large galaxy redshift\nsurveys.\n", "  We consider the non-supersymmetric \"magic\" theories based on the split\nquaternion and the split complex division algebras. We show that these theories\narise as \"Ehlers\" $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ and $SL(3,\\mathbb{R})$ truncations of the\nmaximal supergravity theory, exploiting techniques related to very-extended\nKac-Moody algebras. We also generalise the procedure to other\n$SL(n,\\mathbb{R})$ truncations, resulting in additional classes of\nnon-supersymmetric theories, as well as to truncations of non-maximal theories.\nFinally, we discuss duality orbits of extremal black-hole solutions in some of\nthese non-supersymmetric theories.\n", "  We present an exploration of the mass structure of a sample of 12 strongly\nlensed massive, compact early-type galaxies at redshifts $z\\sim0.6$ to provide\nfurther possible evidence for their inside-out growth. We obtain new ESI/Keck\nspectroscopy and infer the kinematics of both lens and source galaxies, and\ncombine these with existing photometry to construct (a) the fundamental plane\n(FP) of the source galaxies and (b) physical models for their dark and luminous\nmass structure. We find their FP to be tilted towards the virial plane relative\nto the local FP, and attribute this to their unusual compactness, which causes\ntheir kinematics to be totally dominated by the stellar mass as opposed to\ntheir dark matter; that their FP is nevertheless still inconsistent with the\nvirial plane implies that both the stellar and dark structure of early-type\ngalaxies is non-homologous. We also find the intrinsic scatter of their FP to\nbe comparable to the local value, indicating that variations in the stellar\nmass structure outweight variations in the dark halo in the central regions of\nearly-type galaxies. Finally, we show that inference on the dark halo structure\n-- and, in turn, the underlying physics -- is sensitive to assumptions about\nthe stellar initial mass function (IMF), but that physically-motivated\nassumptions about the IMF imply haloes with sub-NFW inner density slopes, and\nmay present further evidence for the inside-out growth of compact early-type\ngalaxies via minor mergers and accretion.\n", "  We study the finite-size spectrum of the O($N$) symmetric Wilson-Fisher\nconformal field theory (CFT) on the $d=2$ spatial-dimension torus using the\nexpansion in $\\epsilon=3-d$. This is done by deriving a set of universal\neffective Hamiltonians describing fluctuations of the zero momentum modes. The\neffective Hamiltonians take the form of $N$-dimensional quantum anharmonic\noscillators, which are shown to be strongly coupled at the critical point for\nsmall $\\epsilon$. The low-energy spectrum is solved numerically for $N =\n1,2,3,4$. Using exact diagonalization (ED), we also numerically study explicit\nlattice models known to be in the O($2$) and O($3$) universality class,\nobtaining estimates of the low-lying critical spectrum. The analytic and\nnumerical results show excellent agreement and the critical low energy torus\nspectra are qualitatively different among the studied CFTs, identifying them as\na useful fingerprint for detecting the universality class of a quantum critical\npoint.\n", "  A novel method for deriving energy conditions in stable field theories is\ndescribed. In a local classical theory with one spatial dimension, a local\nenergy condition always exists. For a relativistic field theory, one obtains\nthe dominant energy condition. In a quantum field theory, there instead exists\na quantum energy condition, i.e. a lower bound on the energy density that\ndepends on information-theoretic quantities. Some extensions to higher\ndimensions are briefly discussed.\n", "  When continuous parameters in a QFT are varied adiabatically, quantum states\ntypically undergo mixing---a phenomenon characterized by the Berry phase. We\ninitiate a systematic analysis of the Berry phase in QFT using standard quantum\nmechanics methods. We show that a non-trivial Berry phase appears in many\nfamiliar QFTs. We study a variety of examples including free electromagnetism\nwith a theta angle, and certain supersymmetric QFTs in two and four spacetime\ndimensions. We also argue that a large class of QFTs with rich Berry properties\nis provided by CFTs with non-trivial conformal manifolds. Using the\noperator-state correspondence we demonstrate in this case that the Berry\nconnection is equivalent to the connection on the conformal manifold derived\npreviously in conformal perturbation theory. In the special case of chiral\nprimary states in 2d N=(2,2) and 4d N=2 SCFTs the Berry phase is governed by\nthe tt* equations. We present a technically useful rederivation of these\nequations using quantum mechanics methods.\n", "  It is shown that the work fluctuations and work distribution functions are\nfundamentally different in systems with short-range versus long-range\ncorrelations. The two cases considered with long- range correlations are\nmagnetic work fluctuations in an equilibrium isotropic ferromagnet, and work\nfluctuations in a non-equilibrium fluid with a temperature gradient. The\nlong-range correlations in the former case are due to equilibrium Goldstone\nmodes, while in the latter they are due to generic non-equilibrium effects. The\nmagnetic case is of particular interest since an external magnetic field can be\nused to tune the system from one with long-range correlations, to one with only\nshort- range correlations. It is shown that in systems with long-range\ncorrelations the work distribution is extraordinarily broad compared to systems\nwith only short-range correlations. Surprisingly these results imply that\nfluctuations theorems such as the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem are more useful\nin systems with long-range correlations than in systems with short-range\ncorrelations.\n", "  We determine a new set of parton distribution functions (ABMP16), the strong\ncoupling constant $\\alpha_s$ and the quark masses $m_c$, $m_b$ and $m_t$ in a\nglobal fit to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. The analysis uses\nthe $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme for $\\alpha_s$ and all quark masses and is\nperformed in the fixed-flavor number scheme for $n_f=3, 4, 5$. Essential new\nelements of the fit are the combined data from HERA for inclusive\ndeep-inelastic scattering (DIS), data from the fixed-target experiments NOMAD\nand CHORUS for neutrino-induced DIS, and data from Tevatron and the LHC for the\nDrell-Yan process and the hadro-production of single-top and top-quark pairs.\nThe theory predictions include new improved approximations at NNLO for the\nproduction of heavy quarks in DIS and for the hadro-production of single-top\nquarks. The description of higher twist effects relevant beyond the leading\ntwist collinear factorization approximation is refined. At NNLO we obtain the\nvalue $\\alpha_s^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z) = 0.1147 \\pm 0.0008$.\n", "  We study spinless electrons in a single channel quantum wire interacting\nthrough attractive interaction, and the quantum Hall states that may be\nconstructed by an array of such wires. For a single wire the electrons may form\ntwo phases, the Luttinger liquid and the strongly paired phase. The Luttinger\nliquid is gapless to one- and two-electron excitations, while the strongly\npaired state is gapped to the former and gapless to the latter. In contrast to\nthe case in which the wire is proximity-coupled to an external superconductor,\nfor an isolated wire there is no separate phase of a topological, weakly\npaired, superconductor. Rather, this phase is adiabatically connected to the\nLuttinger liquid phase. The properties of the one dimensional topological\nsuperconductor emerge when the number of channels in the wire becomes large.\nThe quantum Hall states that may be formed by an array of single-channel wires\ndepend on the Landau level filling factors. For odd-denominator fillings\n$\\nu=1/(2n+1)$, wires at the Luttinger phase form Laughlin states while wires\nin the strongly paired phase form bosonic fractional quantum Hall state of\nstrongly-bound pairs at a filling of $1/(8n+4)$. The transition between the two\nis of the universality class of Ising transitions in three dimensions. For\neven-denominator fractions $\\nu=1/2n$ the two single-wire phases translate into\nfour quantum Hall states. Two of those states are bosonic fractional quantum\nHall states of weakly- and strongly- bound pairs of electrons. The other two\nare non-Abelian quantum Hall states, which originate from coupling wires close\nto their critical point. One of these non-Abelian states is the Moore-Read\nstate. The transition between all these states are of the universality class of\nMajorana transitions. We point out some of the properties that characterize the\ndifferent phases and the phase transitions.\n", "  Self-regulating AGN feedback in the cool cores of galaxy clusters plays\ncentral role in solving the decades-old cooling flow problem, but one major\nproblem remains unsolved - how is the AGN energy thermalized in the ICM and\nwhat are the effective black hole feeding rates in realistic systems? We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres.\n", "  Virus binding to a surface results at least locally, at the contact area, in\nstress and potential structural perturbation of the virus cage. Here we address\nthe question of the role of substrate-induced deformation in the overall virus\nmechanical response to the adsorption event. This question may be especially\nimportant for the broad category of viruses that have their shells stabilized\nby weak, non-covalent interactions. We utilize atomic force microscopy to\nmeasure the height change distributions of the brome mosaic virus upon\nadsorption from liquid on atomically flat substrates and present a continuum\nmodel which captures well the behavior. Height data fitting according the model\nprovides, without recourse to indentation, estimates of virus elastic\nproperties and of the interfacial energy.\n", "  We present the results of a study investigating the dust attenuation law at\n$z\\simeq 5$, based on synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) calculated\nfor a sample of N=498 galaxies drawn from the First Billion Years (FiBY)\nsimulation project. The simulated galaxies at $z\\simeq 5$, which have M$_{1500}\n\\leq -18.0$ and $7.5 \\leq \\rm{log(M/M}_{\\odot}\\rm{)} \\leq 10.2$, display a\nmass-dependent $\\alpha$-enhancement, with a median value of\n$[\\alpha/\\rm{Fe}]_{z=5}~\\simeq~4~\\times~[\\alpha/\\rm{Fe}]_{Z_{\\odot}}$. The\nmedian Fe/H ratio of the simulated galaxies is $0.14\\pm0.05$ which, even\nincluding the effects of nebular continuum, produces steep intrinsic UV\ncontinuum slopes; $\\langle \\beta_{i} \\rangle = -2.4 \\pm 0.05$. Using a set of\nsimple dust attenuation models, in which the wavelength-dependent attenuation\nis assumed to be of the form $A(\\lambda) \\propto \\lambda^{n}$, we explore the\nparameter values which best reproduce the observed $z=5$ luminosity function\n(LF) and colour-magnitude relation (CMR). We find that a simple model in which\nthe absolute UV attenuation is a linearly increasing function of log stellar\nmass, and the dust attenuation slope ($n$) is within the range $-0.7 \\leq n\n\\leq-0.3$, can successfully reproduce the LF and CMR over a wide range of\nstellar population synthesis model (SPS) assumptions. This range of attenuation\ncurves is consistent with a power-law fit to the Calzetti attenuation law in\nthe UV ($n=-0.55$), and other similarly `grey' star-forming galaxy attenuation\ncurves recently derived at $z\\simeq2$. In contrast, attenuation curves as steep\nas the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve ($n=-1.24$) are formally\nruled out. Finally, we show that our models are consistent with recent 1.3mm\nALMA observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), and predict the form\nof the $z\\simeq5$ IRX$-\\beta$ relation.\n", "  Thickness driven electronic phase transitions are broadly observed in\ndifferent types of functional perovskite heterostructures. However, uncertainty\nremains whether these effects are solely due to spatial confinement, broken\nsymmetry or rather to a change of structure with varying film thickness. Here,\nwe present direct evidence for the relaxation of oxygen 2p and Mn 3d orbital\n(p-d) hybridization coupled to the layer dependent octahedral tilts within a\nLa2/3Sr1/3MnO3 film driven by interfacial octahedral coupling. An enhanced\nCurie temperature is achieved by reducing the octahedral tilting via interface\nstructure engineering. Atomically resolved lattice, electronic and magnetic\nstructures together with X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate the central\nrole of thickness dependent p-d hybridization in the widely observed\ndimensionality effects present in correlated oxide heterostructures.\n", "  We present experimental evidence of the universal emergence of the Peregrine\nsoliton predicted in the semi-classical (zero-dispersion) limit of the focusing\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. {\\bf 66}, 678\n(2012)]. Experiments studying higher-order soliton propagation in optical fiber\nuse an optical sampling oscilloscope and frequency-resolved optical gating to\ncharacterise intensity and phase around the first point of soliton compression\nand the results show that the properties of the compressed pulse and background\npedestal can be interpreted in terms of the Peregrine soliton. Experimental and\nnumerical results reveal that the universal mechanism under study is highly\nrobust and can be observed over a broad range of parameters, and experiments\nare in very good agreement with numerical simulations.\n", "  We study the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity of rare-earth\nnickelate films of varying composition and strain close to the\nantiferromagnetic ordering temperature, TN. Two prominent peaks at 0.6 and 1.3\neV, which are characteristic of the insulating phase, display a small but\nsignificant increase in intensity when the material passes from para- to\nantiferromagnetic. This observation indicates the presence of a positive\nfeedback between antiferromagnetic (AF) and bond disproportionation (BD) order.\nBy analyzing the temperature dependence near TN, and using a Landau-type\nfree-energy expression for BD and AF order, we infer that BD order is a\nnecessary condition for the AF phase to appear, and that the antiferromagnetism\ncontributes to stabilization of the bond disproportionation. This model also\nexplains why hysteresis is particularly strong when the transition into the\ninsulating state occurs simultaneously with antiferromagnetic order.\n", "  We present a general, Gaussian spatial mode propagation formalism for\ndescribing the generation of higher order multi-spatial-mode beams generated\nduring nonlinear interactions. Furthermore, to implement the theory, we\nsimulate optical angular momentum transfer interactions, and show how one can\noptimize the interaction to reduce the undesired modes. Past theoretical\ntreatments of this problem have often been phenomenological, at best. Here we\npresent an exact solution for the single-pass no-cavity regime, in which the\nthe nonlinear interaction is not overly strong. We apply our theory to two\nexperiments, with very good agreement, and give examples of several more\nconfigurations, easily tested in the laboratory.\n", "  We present a novel interpretation of the $\\gamma$-ray diffuse emission\nmeasured by Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. in the Galactic center (GC) region and the\nGalactic ridge (GR). In the first part we perform a data-driven analysis based\non PASS8 Fermi-LAT data: we extend down to few GeV the spectra measured by\nH.E.S.S. and infer the primary cosmic-ray (CR) radial distribution between 0.1\nand 3 TeV. In the second part we adopt a CR transport model based on a\nposition-dependent diffusion coefficient. Such behavior reproduces the radial\ndependence of the CR spectral index recently inferred from the Fermi-LAT\nobservations. We find that the bulk of the GR emission can be naturally\nexplained by the interaction of the diffuse steady-state Galactic CR sea with\nthe gas present in the Central Molecular Zone. Although our results leave room\nfor a residual radial-dependent emission associated with a central source, the\nrelevance of the large-scale background prevents from a solid evidence of a GC\nPevatron.\n", "  $\\rho$ Pup is a $\\delta$ Scuti F2 pulsator, known to host a main radial mode\nas well as non-radial pulsations, with chemical peculiarities typical of\nevolved Am stars. We present high-precision spectropolarimetric observations of\nthis star, obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)\nin the frame of the BRITE spectropolarimetric survey. A magnetic field is\nclearly detected in $\\rho$ Pup, with a longitudinal field strength below 1 G.\nThis makes $\\rho$ Pup the second known magnetic $\\delta$ Scuti discovered,\nafter HD 188774, and a possible cool evolved counterpart of the recently\ndiscovered ultra-weakly magnetic Am family.\n", "  The 70 kDa Heat Shock Proteins Hsp70 have several essential functions in\nliving systems, such as protecting cells against protein aggregation, assisting\nprotein folding, remodeling protein complexes and driving the translocation\ninto organelles. These functions require high affinity for non-specific\namino-acid sequences that are ubiquitous in proteins. It has been recently\nshown that this high affinity, called ultra-affinity, depends on a process\ndriven out of equilibrium by ATP hydrolysis. Here we establish the\nthermodynamic bounds for ultra-affinity, and further show that the same\nreaction scheme can in principle be used both to strengthen and to weaken\naffinities (leading in this case to infra-affinity). We show that cofactors are\nessential to achieve affinity beyond the equilibrium range. Finally, biological\nimplications are discussed.\n", "  We report a $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance study in the honeycomb\nlattice, $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a material that has been suggested to potentially\nrealize a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. Our results provide\ndirect evidence that $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ exhibits a magnetic field-induced QSL.\nFor fields larger than $\\sim 10$ T a spin-gap opens up while resonance lines\nremain sharp, evidencing that spins are quantum disordered and locally\nfluctuating. The spin gap increases linearly with increasing magnetic field,\nreaching $\\sim50$ K at 15 T, and is nearly isotropic with respect to the field\ndirection. The unusual rapid increase of the spin gap with increasing field and\nits isotropic nature are incompatible with conventional magnetic ordering and\nin particular exclude that the ground state is a fully polarized ferromagnet.\nThe presence of such a field-induced, gapped QSL phase has indeed been\npredicted in the Kitaev model.\n", "  The computation of transmission spectra is a central ingredient in the study\nof exoplanetary atmospheres. First, we revisit the theory of transmission\nspectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission\nspectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a\nreference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We\nshow that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius,\nthe assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the\ninferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC3 transmission\nspectrum. Second, we show that the transmission spectra of isothermal\natmospheres are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric\nanalytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical\ncalculations and show that the typical errors are ~0.1% (~10 ppm) within the\nWFC3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Third, we\ngeneralize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small\ntemperature gradient. Finally, we analyze the measured WFC3 transmission\nspectrum of WASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the\nretrieval approach of Kreidberg et al. (2015) if the reference transit radius\nand reference pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown functional\nrelationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure\nimplies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure\nthat is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone.\nThis degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract\nmolecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC3 data alone. Finally,\nwe compare our study to that of Griffith (2014) and discuss why the degeneracy\nwas missed in previous retrieval studies. [abridged]\n", "  We present a scanning probe microscopy technique for spatially resolving\ntransport in cold atomic gases, in close analogy with scanning gate microscopy\nin semiconductor physics. The conductance of a quantum point contact connected\nto two atomic reservoirs is measured in the presence of a tightly focused laser\nbeam acting as a local perturbation that can be precisely positioned in space.\nBy scanning its position and recording the subsequent variations of\nconductance, we retrieve a high-resolution map of transport through a quantum\npoint contact. We demonstrate a spatial resolution comparable to the extent of\nthe transverse wave function of the atoms inside the channel, and a position\nsensitivity below 10nm. Our measurements agree well with an analytical model\nand ab-initio numerical simulations, allowing us to identify a regime in\ntransport where tunneling dominates over thermal effects. Our technique opens\nnew perspectives for the high-resolution observation and manipulation of cold\natomic gases.\n", "  We elucidate the importance of the consistent treatment of gravity-model\nspecific non-linearities when estimating the growth of cosmological structures\nfrom redshift space distortions (RSD). Within the context of standard\nperturbation theory (SPT), we compare the predictions of two theoretical\ntemplates with redshift space data from COLA (COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration)\nsimulations in the normal branch of DGP gravity (nDGP) and General Relativity\n(GR). Using COLA for these comparisons is validated using a suite of full\nN-body simulations for the same theories. The two theoretical templates\ncorrespond to the standard general relativistic perturbation equations and\nthose same equations modelled within nDGP. Gravitational clustering non-linear\neffects are accounted for by modelling the power spectrum up to one loop order\nand redshift space clustering anisotropy is modelled using the Taruya,\nNishimichi and Saito (TNS) RSD model. Using this approach, we attempt to\nrecover the simulation's fiducial logarithmic growth parameter $f$. By\nassigning the simulation data with errors representing an idealised survey with\na volume of $10\\mbox{Gpc}^3/h^3$, we find the GR template is unable to recover\nfiducial $f$ to within 1$\\sigma$ at $z=1$ when we match the data up to $k_{\\rm\nmax}=0.195h$/Mpc. On the other hand, the DGP template recovers the fiducial\nvalue within $1\\sigma$. Further, we conduct the same analysis for sets of mock\ndata generated for generalised models of modified gravity using SPT, where\nagain we analyse the GR template's ability to recover the fiducial value. We\nfind that for models with enhanced gravitational non-linearity, the theoretical\nbias of the GR template becomes significant for stage IV surveys. Thus, we show\nthat for the future large data volume galaxy surveys, the self-consistent\nmodelling of non-GR gravity scenarios will be crucial in constraining theory\nparameters.\n", "  We calculate elliptic and triangular flow parameters of thermal photons using\nan event-by-event hydrodynamic model with fluctuating initial conditions at\n200A GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and at 2.76A TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC\nfor three different centrality bins. The photon elliptic flow shows strong\ncentrality dependence where $v_2(p_T)$ increases towards peripheral collisions\nboth at RHIC and at the LHC energies. However, the triangular flow parameter\ndoes not show significant dependence to the collision centrality. The elliptic\nas well as the triangular flow parameters found to underestimate the PHENIX\ndata at RHIC by a large margin for all three centrality bins. We calculate\n$p_T$ spectrum and anisotropic flow of thermal photons from 200A GeV Cu+Cu\ncollisions at RHIC for 0--20\\% centrality bin and compare with the results with\nthose from Au+Au collisions. The production of thermal photon is found to\ndecrease significantly for Cu+Cu collisions compared to Au+Au collisions.\nHowever, the effect of initial state fluctuation is found to be more pronounced\nfor anisotropic flow resulting in larger $v_2$ and $v_3$ for Cu+Cu collisions.\nWe study the correlation between the anisotropic flow parameters and the\ncorresponding initial spatial anisotropies from their event by event\ndistributions at RHIC and at the LHC energies. The linear correlation between\n$v_2$ and $\\epsilon_2$ is found be stronger compared to the correlation between\n$v_3$ and $\\epsilon_3$. In addition, the correlation coefficient is found to be\nlarger at LHC than at RHIC.\n", "  The absorption spectra of silicon nanowires (SiNW) are calculated using\nsemi-empirical $sp^{3}d^{5}s^{*}$ tight binding (TB) and Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) methods. The role of diameter, wave function symmetry, strain and\ncrystallographic direction in determining the absorption are discussed. We find\nthat compressive strain can change the band edge absorption by more than one\norder of magnitude due to change in wave function symmetry. In addition, photon\npolarization with respect to the nanowire axis significantly alters the band\nedge absorption. Overall, the band edge absorption of [110] and [100] silicon\nnanowires can differ by as much as three orders of magnitude. We find that\ncompared to bulk Silicon, a strained Silicon nanowire array can absorb infrared\nphotons (1.1 eV) approximately one hundred times better. Finally, we compare a\nfully numerical and a computationally efficient semi-analytical method, and\nfind that they both yield satisfactory values of the band edge absorption.\n", "  Thermo-osmotic slip -- the flow induced by a thermal gradient along a surface\n-- is a well-known phenomenon, but curiously there is a lack of robust\nmolecular-simulation techniques to predict its magnitude. Here, we compare\nthree different molecular simulation techniques to compute the thermo-osmotic\nslip at a simple solid-fluid interface. Although we do not expect the different\napproaches to be in perfect agreement, we find that the differences are barely\nsignificant for a range of different physical conditions, suggesting that\npractical molecular simulations of thermo-osmotic slip are feasible.\n", "  The ultrafast optical manipulation of ordered phases in strongly correlated\nmaterials is a topic of significant theoretical, experimental, and\ntechnological interest. Inspired by a recent experiment on light-induced\nsuperconductivity in fullerenes [Mitrano et al., Nature 530, 2016], we develop\na comprehensive theory of light-induced superconductivity in driven\nelectron-phonon systems with lattice nonlinearities. In analogy with the\noperation of parametric amplifiers, we show how the interplay between the\nexternal drive and lattice nonlinearities lead to significantly enhanced\neffective electron-phonon couplings. We provide a detailed and unbiased study\nof the nonequilibrium dynamics of the driven system using the real-time Green's\nfunction technique. To this end, we develop a Floquet generalization of the\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory and derive a numerically tractable set of quantum\nFloquet-Boltzmann kinetic equations for the coupled electron-phonon system. We\nstudy the role of parametric phonon generation and electronic heating in\ndestroying the transient superconducting state. Finally, we predict the\ntransient formation of electronic Floquet bands in time- and angle-resolved\nphoto-emission spectroscopy experiments as a consequence of the proposed\nmechanism.\n", "  We explore the transport properties of a periodically modulated\n$\\alpha$-$\\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. The effect of the Berry phase on electrical conductivity oscillation,\nso-called Weiss oscillation, caused by the modulation induced non-zero drift\nvelocity of charge carriers is investigated. Employing linear response theory\nwithin the low temperature regime, we analyze Weiss oscillation as a function\nof the external magnetic field for both electrically and magnetically modulated\n$\\alpha$-$\\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice numerically as well as analytically. The Berry\nphase makes this hexagonal lattice structure behave differently than other\ntwo-dimensional fermionic systems. It causes a significant valley polarization\nin magnetoconductivity. Most interestingly, the combined effect of both\nmodulations breaks the particle-hole symmetry and causes a smooth transition\nfrom even (odd) to odd (even) filling fraction corresponding to the density of\nstates peaks by means of the Berry phase.\n", "  Non-ergodic dynamical systems display anomalous transport properties. A\nprominent example are integrable quantum systems, whose exceptional property\nare diverging DC conductivities. In this Letter, we explain the microscopic\norigin of ideal conductivity by resorting to the thermodynamic particle content\nof a system. Using group-theoretic arguments we rigorously resolve the\nlong-standing controversy regarding the nature of spin and charge Drude weights\nin the absence of chemical potentials. In addition, by employing a hydrodynamic\ndescription, we devise an efficient computational method to calculate exact\nDrude weights from the stationary currents generated in an inhomogeneous quench\nfrom bi-partitioned initial states. We exemplify the method on the anisotropic\nHeisenberg model at finite temperatures for the entire range of anisotropies,\naccessing regimes which are out of reach with other approaches. Quite\nremarkably, spin Drude weight and asymptotic spin current rates reveal a\ncompletely discontinuous (fractal) dependence on the anisotropy parameter.\n", "  We perform a systematic analysis of the influence of phonon driving on the\nsuperconducting Holstein model coupled to heat baths by studying both the\ntransient dynamics and the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) in the weak and\nstrong electron-phonon coupling regimes. Our study is based on the\nnonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, and for the NESS we present a\nFloquet formulation adapted to electron-phonon systems. The analysis of the\nphonon propagator suggests that the effective attractive interaction can be\nstrongly enhanced in a parametric resonant regime because of the Floquet side\nbands of phonons. While this may be expected to enhance the superconductivity\n(SC), our fully self-consistent calculations, which include the effects of\nheating and nonthermal distributions, show that the parametric phonon driving\ngenerically results in a suppression or complete melting of the SC order. In\nthe strong coupling regime, the NESS always shows a suppression of the SC gap,\nthe SC order parameter and the superfluid density as a result of the driving,\nand this tendency is most prominent at the parametric resonance. Using the\nreal-time nonequilibrium DMFT formalism, we also study the dynamics towards the\nNESS, which shows that the heating effect dominates the transient dynamics, and\nSC is weakened by the external modulations, in particular at the parametric\nresonance. In the weak coupling regime, we find that the SC fluctuations above\nthe transition temperature are generally weakened under the driving. The\nstrongest suppression occurs again around the parametric resonances because of\nthe efficient energy absorption.\n", "  New model-independent compact representations of imaginary-time data are\npresented in terms of the intermediate representation (IR) of analytical\ncontinuation. This is motivated by a recent numerical finding by the authors\n[J. Otsuki et al., arXiv:1702.03056]. We demonstrate the efficiency of the IR\nthrough continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations of an Anderson\nimpurity model. We find that the IR yields a significantly compact form of\nvarious types of correlation functions. The present framework will provide\ngeneral ways to boost the power of cutting-edge diagrammatic/quantum Monte\nCarlo treatments of many-body systems.\n", "  Common envelope (CE) is an important phase in the evolution of many binary\nsystems. Giant star / compact object interaction in binaries plays an important\nrole in high-energy phenomena as well as in the evolution of their environment.\nMaterial accreted onto the compact object may form a disk and power a jet. We\nstudy analytically and through numerical simulations the interaction between\nthe jet and the CE. We determine the conditions under which accreting material\nquenches the jet or allows it to propagate successfully, in which case even the\nenvelope may be ejected. Close to the stellar core of the companion the compact\nobject accretes at a larger rate. A jet launched from this region needs a\nlarger accretion-to-ejection efficiency to successfully propagate through the\nCE compared to a jet launched far from the stellar core, and is strongly\ndeflected by the orbital motion. The energy deposited by the jet may be larger\nthan the binding energy of the envelope. The jet can, thus, play a fundamental\nrole in the CE evolution. We find that the energy dissipation of the jet into\nthe CE may stop accretion onto the disk. We expect the jet to be intermittent,\nunless the energy deposited is large enough to lead to the unbinding of the\nouter layers of the CE. Given that the energy and duration of the jet are\nsimilar to those of ultra-long GRBs, we suggest this as a new channel to\nproduce these events.\n", "  We present constraints on masses of active and sterile neutrinos. We use the\none-dimensional Ly$\\alpha$-forest power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) and from\nthe VLT/XSHOOTER legacy survey (XQ-100). In this paper, we present our own\nmeasurement of the power spectrum with the publicly released XQ-100 quasar\nspectra.\n  Fitting Ly$\\alpha$ data alone leads to cosmological parameters in excellent\nagreement with the values derived independently from Planck 2015 Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) data. Combining BOSS and XQ-100 Ly$\\alpha$ power\nspectra, we constrain the sum of neutrino masses to $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.8$ eV (95\\%\nC.L). With the addition of CMB data, this bound is tightened to $\\sum m_\\nu <\n0.14$ eV (95\\% C.L.).\n  With their sensitivity to small scales, Ly$\\alpha$ data are ideal to\nconstrain $\\Lambda$WDM models. Using XQ-100 alone, we issue lower bounds on\npure dark matter particles: $m_X \\gtrsim 2.08 \\: \\rm{keV}$ (95\\% C.L.) for\nearly decoupled thermal relics, and $m_s \\gtrsim 10.2 \\: \\rm{keV}$ (95\\% C.L.)\nfor non-resonantly produced right-handed neutrinos. Combining the 1D Ly$\\alpha$\nforest power spectrum measured by BOSS and XQ-100, we improve the two bounds to\n$m_X \\gtrsim 4.17 \\: \\rm{keV}$ and $m_s \\gtrsim 25.0 \\: \\rm{keV}$ (95\\% C.L.).\nThe $3~\\sigma$ bound shows a more significant improvement, increasing from $m_X\n\\gtrsim 2.74 \\: \\rm{keV}$ for BOSS alone to $m_X \\gtrsim 3.10 \\: \\rm{keV}$ for\nthe combined BOSS+XQ-100 data set.\n  Finally, we include in our analysis the first two redshift bins ($z=4.2$ and\n$z=4.6$) of the power spectrum measured with the high-resolution HIRES/MIKE\nspectrographs. The addition of HIRES/MIKE power spectrum allows us to further\nimprove the two limits to $m_X \\gtrsim 4.65 \\: \\rm{keV}$ and $m_s \\gtrsim 28.8\n\\: \\rm{keV}$ (95\\% C.L.).\n", "  We demonstrate that the existence of a Noether symmetry in $f(R)$ theories of\ngravity gives rise to a further gravitational radius, besides the standard\nSchwarzschild one, determining the dynamics at galactic scales. By this\nfeature, it is possible to explain the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the\nrotation curve of gas-rich galaxies without the dark matter hypothesis.\n", "  In this paper, we perform a cosmological model-independent test of the cosmic\ndistance-duality relation (CDDR) in terms of the ratio of angular diameter\ndistance (ADD) $D=D_{\\rm A}^{\\rm sl}/D_{\\rm A}^{\\,\\rm s}$ from strong\ngravitational lensing (SGL) and the ratio of luminosity distance (LD)\n$D^\\ast=D_{\\rm L}^{\\,\\rm l}/D_{\\rm L}^{\\,\\rm s}$ obtained from the joint of\ntype Ia supernovae (SNIa) Union2.1 compilation and the latest Gamma-Ray Bursts\n(GRBs) data, where the superscripts s and l correspond to the redshifts\n$z_{\\,\\rm s}$ and $z_{\\,\\rm l}$ at the source and lens from SGL samples. The\npurpose of combining GRB data with SNIa compilation is to test CDDR in a wider\nredshift range. The LD associated with the redshits of the observed ADD, is\nobtained through two cosmological model-independent methods, namely, method A:\nbinning the SNIa+GRBs data, and method B: reconstructing the function of DL by\ncombining the Crossing Statistic with the smoothing method. We find that CDDR\nis compatible with the observations at $1\\sigma$ confidence level for the power\nlaw model which is assumed to describe the mass distribution of lensing systems\nwith method B in a wider redshift range.\n", "  We present dust yields for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and\nsuper--asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) stars of solar metallicity. Stars with\ninitial mass $1.5~M_{\\odot} \\leq M_{\\rm ini} \\leq 3~M_{\\odot}$ reach the carbon\nstar stage during the AGB phase and produce mainly solid carbon and SiC. The\nsize and the amount of the carbon particles formed follows a positive trend\nwith themass of the star; the carbon grains with the largest size ($a_{\\rm C}\n\\sim 0.2\\mu$m) are produced by AGB stars with $M_{\\rm ini} = 2.5-3~M_{\\odot}$,\nas these stars are those achieving the largest enrichment of carbon in the\nsurface regions. The size of SiC grains, being sensitive to the surface silicon\nabundance, keeps around $a_{\\rm SiC} \\sim 0.1\\mu$m. The mass of carbonaceous\ndust formed is in the range $10^{-4} - 5\\times 10^{-3}~M_{\\odot}$, whereas the\namount of SiC produced is $2\\times 10^{-4} - 10^{-3}~M_{\\odot}$. Massive\nAGB/SAGB stars with $M_{\\rm ini} > 3~M_{\\odot}$ experience HBB, that inhibits\nformation of carbon stars. The most relevant dust species formed in these stars\nare silicates and alumina dust, with grain sizes in the range $0.1\\mu m <\na_{\\rm ol} < 0.15\\mu$m and $a_{\\rm Al_2O_3} \\sim 0.07\\mu$m, respectively. The\nmass of silicates produced spans the interval $3.4\\times 10^{-3}~M_{\\odot} \\leq\nM_{\\rm dust} \\leq 1.1\\times 10^{-2}~M_{\\odot}$ and increases with the initial\nmass of the star.\n", "  It has been argued that supersymmetric microstate geometries are classically\nunstable. One argument for instability involves considering the motion of a\nmassive particle near the ergosurface of such a spacetime. It is shown that the\ninstability can be triggered by a particle that starts arbitrarily far from the\nergosurface. Another argument for instability is related to the phenomenon of\nstable trapping of null geodesics in these geometries. Such trapping is studied\nin detail for the most symmetrical microstate geometries. It is found that\nthere are several distinct types of trapped null geodesic, both prograde and\nretrograde. Several important differences between geodesics in microstate\ngeometries and black hole geometries are noted. The Penrose process for energy\nextraction in these geometries is discussed.\n", "  A minimal model for the hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Majorana\nplatform is developed that fully captures the effects of the low-energy\nrenormalization of the nanowire modes arising from the presence of the parent\nsuperconductor. In this model, the parent superconductor is an active component\nthat participates explicitly in the low-energy physics, not just a passive\npartner that only provides proximity-induced Cooper pairs for the nanowire.\nThis treatment on an equal footing of the superconductor and the semiconductor\nhas become necessary in view of recent experiments, which do not allow a\nconsistent interpretation based just on the bare semiconductor properties. The\ngeneral theory involves the evaluation of the exact semiconductor Green\nfunction that includes a dynamical self-energy correction arising from the\ntunnel-coupled superconductor. General conditions for the emergence of\ntopological superconductivity are worked out for single-band as well as\nmulti-band nanowires and detailed numerical results are given for both infinite\nand finite wire cases. The topological quantum phase diagrams are provided\nnumerically and the Majorana bound states are obtained along with their\noscillatory energy splitting behaviors due to wavefunction overlap in finite\nwires. Renormalization effects are shown to be both qualitatively and\nquantitatively important in modifying the low-energy spectrum of the nanowire.\nThe results of the theory are found to be in good qualitative agreement with\nMajorana nanowire experiments, leading to the conclusion that the\nproximity-induced low-energy renormalization of the nanowire modes by the\nparent superconductor is of fundamental importance in\nsuperconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures. Implications of the general\ntheory for obtaining true zero energy topological Majorana modes are pointed\nout.\n", "  The radion scalar field might be the lightest new particle predicted by\nextra-dimensional extensions of the Standard Model. It could thus lead to the\nfirst signatures of new physics at the LHC collider. We perform a complete\nstudy of the radion production in association with the Z gauge boson in the\ncustodially protected warped model with a brane-localised Higgs boson\naddressing the gauge hierarchy problem. Radion-Higgs mixing effects are\npresent. Such a radion production receives possibly resonant contributions from\nthe Kaluza-Klein excitations of the Z boson as well as the extra neutral gauge\nboson (Z'). All the exchange and mixing effects induced by those heavy bosons\nare taken into account in the radion coupling and rate calculations. The\ninvestigation of the considered radion production at LHC allows to be sensitive\nto some parts of the parameter space but only the ILC program at high\nluminosity would cover most of the theoretically allowed parameter space via\nthe studied reaction. Complementary tests of the same theoretical parameters\ncan be realised through the high accuracy measurements of the Higgs couplings\nat ILC. The generic sensitivity limits on the rates discussed for the LHC and\nILC potential reach can be applied to the searches for other (light) exotic\nscalar bosons.\n", "  In a recent paper we applied a rigorous perturbed matching framework to show\nthe amendment of the mass of rotating stars in Hartle's model. Here, we apply\nthis framework to the tidal problem in binary systems. Our approach fully\naccounts for the correction to the Love numbers needed to obtain the universal\n$I$-Love-$Q$ relations. We compute the corrected mass vs radius configurations\nof rotating quark stars, revisiting a classical paper on the subject. These\ncorrections allow us to find a universal relation involving the second-order\ncontribution to the mass $\\delta M$. We thus complete the set of universal\nrelations for the tidal problem in binary systems, involving four perturbation\nparameters, namely $I$, Love, $Q$, and $\\delta M$. These relations can be used\nto obtain the perturbation parameters directly from observational data.\n", "  [Background] Long-Baseline experiments such as T2K, NOvA or the planned Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) require theoretical descriptions of the\ncomplete event in a neutrino-nucleus reaction. Since nuclear targets are used\nthis requires a good understanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions. [Purpose]\nOne of the dominant reaction channels in neutrino-nucleus interactions is pion\nproduction. This paper aims for a coherent view on all charged current charged\npion production data that are avaible from the experiments MiniBooNE, the near\ndetector experiment at T2K and MINERvA. [Methods] Pion production is treated\nthrough excitations of nucleon resonances, including background terms, and deep\ninelastic scattering. The final state interactions of the produced pions are\ndescribed within the Giessen-Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) implementation\nof quantum-kinetic transport theory. [Results] Results are given for MiniBooNE,\nthe near detector experiment at T2K and for MINERvA. While the theoretical\nresults for MiniBooNE differ from the data both in shape and magnitude, their\nagreement both with the T2K and the MINERvA data is good for all pion and\nlepton observables. Predictions for pion spectra are shown for MicroBooNE and\nNOvA. [Conclusions] Based on the GiBUU model of lepton-nucleus interactions a\nconsistent, good theoretical description of CC charged pion production data\nfrom the T2K ND and the MINERvA experiments is possible, without any parameter\ntunes. The MiniBooNE data cannot be reproduced.\n", "  The coherent optical response from 140~nm and 65~nm thick ZnO epitaxial\nlayers is studied using transient four-wave-mixing spectroscopy with picosecond\ntemporal resolution. Resonant excitation of neutral donor-bound excitons\nresults in two-pulse and three-pulse photon echoes. For the donor-bound A\nexciton (D$^0$X$_\\text{A}$) at temperature of 1.8~K we evaluate optical\ncoherence times $T_2=33-50$~ps corresponding to homogeneous linewidths of\n$13-19~\\mu$eV, about two orders of magnitude smaller as compared with the\ninhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions. The coherent dynamics is\ndetermined mainly by the population decay with time $T_1=30-40$~ps, while pure\ndephasing is negligible in the studied high quality samples even for strong\noptical excitation. Temperature increase leads to a significant shortening of\n$T_2$ due to interaction with acoustic phonons. In contrast, the loss of\ncoherence of the donor-bound B exciton (D$^0$X$_\\text{B}$) is significantly\nfaster ($T_2=3.6$~ps) and governed by pure dephasing processes.\n", "  The Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit (SO) interactions in 2D electron gases\nact as effective magnetic fields with momentum-dependent directions, which\ncause spin decay as the spins undergo arbitrary precessions about these\nrandomly-oriented SO fields due to momentum scattering. Theoretically and\nexperimentally, it has been established that by fine-tuning the Rashba $\\alpha$\nand Dresselhaus $\\beta$ couplings to equal $\\it{fixed}$ strengths\n$\\alpha=\\beta$, the total SO field becomes unidirectional thus rendering the\nelectron spins immune to dephasing due to momentum scattering. A robust\npersistent spin helix (PSH) has already been experimentally realized at this\nsingular point $\\alpha=\\beta$. Here we employ the suppression of weak\nantilocalization as a sensitive detector for matched SO fields together with a\ntechnique that allows for independent electrical control over the SO couplings\nvia top gate voltage $V_T$ and back gate voltage $V_B$. We demonstrate for the\nfirst time the gate control of $\\beta$ and the $\\it{continuous\\,locking}$ of\nthe SO fields at $\\alpha=\\beta$, i.e., we are able to vary both $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ controllably and continuously with $V_T$ and $V_B$, while keeping them\nlocked at equal strengths. This makes possible a new concept: \"stretchable\nPSHs\", i.e., helical spin patterns with continuously variable pitches $P$ over\na wide parameter range. The extracted spin-diffusion lengths and decay times as\na function of $\\alpha/\\beta$ show a significant enhancement near\n$\\alpha/\\beta=1$. Since within the continuous-locking regime quantum transport\nis diffusive (2D) for charge while ballistic (1D) for spin and thus amenable to\ncoherent spin control, stretchable PSHs could provide the platform for the much\nheralded long-distance communication $\\sim 8 - 25$ $\\mu$m between solid-state\nspin qubits.\n", "  We analyze the recent LHCb measurement of the distribution of the fraction of\nthe transverse momentum, $z(J/\\psi)$, carried by the $J/\\psi$ within a jet.\nLHCb data is compared to analytic calculations using the fragmenting jet\nfunction (FJF) formalism for studying $J/\\psi$ in jets. Logarithms in the FJFs\nare resummed using DGLAP evolution. We also convolve hard QCD partonic cross\nsections, showered with PYTHIA, with leading order Non Relativistic Quantum\nChromodynamics (NRQCD) fragmentation functions and obtain consistent results.\nBoth approaches use Madgraph to calculate the hard process that creates the jet\ninitiating parton. These calculations give reasonable agreement with the\n$z(J/\\psi)$ distribution that was shown to be poorly described by default\nPYTHIA simulations in the LHCb paper. We compare our predictions for the\n$J/\\psi$ distribution using various extractions of nonperturbative NRQCD\nlong-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) in the literature. NRQCD calculations\nagree with LHCb data better than default PYTHIA regardless of which fit to the\nLDMEs is used. LDMEs from fits that focus exclusively on high transverse\nmomentum data from colliders are in good agreement with the LHCb measurement.\n", "  The SkyMapper 1.3 m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory has now begun\nregular operations. Alongside the Southern Sky Survey, a comprehensive digital\nsurvey of the entire southern sky, SkyMapper will carry out a search for\nsupernovae and other transients. The search strategy, covering a total\nfootprint area of ~2000 deg2 with a cadence of $\\leq 5$ days, is optimised for\ndiscovery and follow-up of low-redshift type Ia supernovae to constrain cosmic\nexpansion and peculiar velocities. We describe the search operations and\ninfrastructure, including a parallelised software pipeline to discover variable\nobjects in difference imaging; simulations of the performance of the survey\nover its lifetime; public access to discovered transients; and some first\nresults from the Science Verification data.\n", "  We discuss the uniqueness of the static spacetimes with non-trivial conformal\nscalar field. Then, we can show that the spacetime is unique to be the\nBocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein solution outside the surface composed\nof the unstable circular orbit of photon(photon surface). In addition, we see\nthat multi-photon surfaces having the same scalar field values do not exist.\n", "  The grand question of star and planet formation is the distribution of\nmagnetic flux in the protoplanetary disks. To answer it, a detailed\nself-consistent chemical evolution is needed to describe the magnetic\ndissipation in the collapsing core accurately. We use a chemo-dynamical version\nof RAMSES to follow the evolution of collapsing dense cores for a range in the\ndust size assumptions. The number density of dust and it's mean size are\naffecting the efficiency of the charge capturing and thus the chemistry. The\nchemical abundances for the range of dust sizes are produced by RAMSES and\nserve as an input to calculations of Ohmic, ambipolar and Hall diffusivity\nterms. We find that Ohmic resistivity only plays a role at the late stage of\nthe collapse where gas density exceeds few times $10^{13}\\rm cm^{-3}$.\nAmbipolar diffusion is a dominant magnetic diffusivity term in cases where mean\ndust size is a typical ISM value or larger. We show that the assumption of a\nfixed 'dominant ion' mass can change the ambipolar diffusion up to one order of\nmagnitude. 'Negative' Hall effect is dominant during the collapse in case of\nmean dust size of 0.02 $\\mu$m and smaller, the effect which we connect to the\ndominance of negatively charged grains. We find that the Hall effect's sign\nreversal is depending on relative contribution of negatively charged dust to\nthe hall conductivity. The dust grain mean size appears to be the parameter\ndividing the collapsing clouds in Hall-dominated and ambipolar-dominated\nclouds, and thus affecting the size of the new-born disks. We propose to link\nthe dust properties and the occurance and size of disk structures in Class 0\nYSO's. The proper accounting for dust grain growth in the radiative\nmagneto-hydrodynamical collapse models appear to be be as important as coupling\nthe dynamics of the collapse with the chemistry.\n", "  With the new Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, I derive a new parallactic\ndistance to the young sigma Orionis open cluster, which is a cornerstone region\nfor studying the formation and evolution of stars and substellar objects from\ntens of solar masses to a few Jupiter masses. I started with the list of the 46\nbrightest cluster stars of Caballero (2007). After identifying the 24 TGAS\nstars in the 30 arcmin-radius survey area and accounting for 11 FGKM-type\ndwarfs and giants in the fore- and background, I got a list of 13 cluster\nmembers and candidates with new parallaxes. Of them, I discarded five cluster\nmember candidates with questionable features of youth and/or discordant\nparallaxes and proper motions, including a distant Herbig Ae/Be star, and\nproceeded with the remaining eight stars. The sigma Orionis mean heliocentric\ndistance is d =360^{+44}_{-35} pc, which is consistent with a contemporaneous\ninterferometric determination that concludes a two-decade dispute on the\ncluster distance. As a by-product, the re-classification of those five cluster\nmember candidates, now interlopers, shows a manifest deficit of cluster stars\nbetween 1.2 and 2.1 Msol, which leaves the door open to new astrometric\nmembership analyses with the next Gaia data releases.\n", "  We present a new study concerning the application of the Schwarzschild orbit\nsuperposition method to model spherical galaxies. The method aims to recover\nthe mass and the orbit anisotropy parameter profiles of the objects using\nmeasurements of positions and line-of-sight velocities usually available for\nresolved stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. To test the\nreliability of the method, we used different sets of mock data extracted from\nfour numerical realizations of dark matter haloes. The models shared the same\ndensity profile but differed in anisotropy profiles, covering a wide range of\npossibilities, from constant to increasing and decreasing with radius. The\ntests were done in two steps, first assuming that the mass profile of the dwarf\nis known and employing the method to retrieve the anisotropy only, and then\nvarying also the mass distribution. We used two kinds of data samples:\nunrealistically large ones based on over 270 000 particles from the numerical\nrealizations and small ones matching the amount of data available for the\nFornax dwarf. For the large data samples we recover both the mass and the\nanisotropy profiles with very high accuracy. For the realistically small ones\nwe also find a reasonably good agreement between the fitted and the input\nanisotropies, however the total density profiles can be significantly biased as\na result of their oversensitivity to the available data. Our results therefore\nprovide convincing evidence in favour of the applicability of the Schwarzschild\nmethod to break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy in dwarf galaxies.\n", "  We study the evolution of helical magnetism in MnGe chiral magnet upon\npartial substitution of Mn for non magnetic 3d-Co and 4d-Rh ions. At high\ndoping levels, we observe spin helices with very long periods -more than ten\ntimes larger than in the pure compound- and sizable ordered moments. This\nbehavior calls for a change in the energy balance of interactions leading to\nthe stabilization of the observed magnetic structures. Strikingly, neutron\nscattering unambiguously shows a double periodicity in the observed spectra at\n$x \\gtrsim 0.45$ and $\\gtrsim 0.25$ for Co- and Rh-doping, respectively. In\nanalogy with observations made in cholesteric liquid crystals, we suggest that\nit reveals the presence of magnetic twist-grain-boundary phases, involving a\ndense short-range correlated network of screw dislocations. The dislocation\ncores are described as smooth textures made of non-radial double-core\nskyrmions.\n", "  The escape dynamics around the triangular Lagrangian point L5 in the real\nSun-Earth-Moon-Spacecraft system is investigated. Appearance of the finite time\nchaotic behaviour suggests that widely used methods and concepts of dynamical\nsystem theory can be useful in constructing a desired mission design. Existing\nchaos control methods are modified in such a way that we are able to protect a\ntest particle from escape. We introduce initial condition maps in order to have\na suitable numerical method to describe the motion in high dimensional phase\nspace. Results show that the structure of initial condition maps can be split\ninto two well-defined domains. One of these two parts has a regular contiguous\nshape and is responsible for long time escape; it is a long-lived island. The\nother one shows a filamentary fractal structure in initial condition maps. The\nshort time escape is governed by this object. This study focuses on a low-cost\nmethod which successfully transfers a reference trajectory between these two\nregions using an appropriate continuous control force. A comparison of the\nEarth-Moon transfer is also presented to show the efficiency of our method.\n", "  Cells exhibit qualitatively different behaviors on substrates with different\nrigidities. The fact that cells are more polarized on the stiffer substrate\nmotivates us to construct a two-dimensional cell with the distribution of focal\nadhesions dependent on substrate rigidities. This distribution affects the\nforces exerted by the cell and thereby determines its motion. Our model\nreproduces the experimental observation that the persistence time is higher on\nthe stiffer substrate. This stiffness dependent persistence will lead to\ndurotaxis, the preference in moving towards stiffer substrates. This propensity\nis characterized by the durotaxis index first defined in experiments. We derive\nand validate a 2D corresponding Fokker-Planck equation associated with our\nmodel. Our approach highlights the possible role of the focal adhesion\narrangement in durotaxis.\n", "  The lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP), which appears in the theory of\nuniversal extra dimensions, is one of good candidates for cold dark matter\n(CDM). When LKP pairs annihilate around the center of the Galaxy where CDM is\nconcentrated, there are some modes which produce electrons and positrons as\nfinal products, and we categorize them into two components. One of them is the\n\"Line\" component, which directly annihilates into electron--positron pair.\nAnother one is the \"Continuum\" component, which consists of secondarily\nproduced electrons and positrons via some decay modes. Before reaching Earth,\ndirections of electrons and positrons are randomized by the Galactic magnetic\nfield, and their energies are reduced by energy loss mechanisms. We assume the\nLKP is in the mass range from 300 GeV to 1500 GeV. We calculate the electron\nplus positron spectrum after propagation in the Galactic halo to Earth, and we\nanalyze the resulting spectrum and positron fraction. We also point out that\nthe energy dependence of observed positron fraction is well reproduced by the\nmixture of \"line\" and \"continuum\" components. We can fit the electron plus\npositron spectrum and the positron fraction by assuming appropriate boost\nfactors describing dark matter concentration in the Galactic halo. However, it\nis difficult to explain both the electron plus positron spectrum and the\npositron fraction by a single boost factor, if we take account of observational\ndata obtained by AMS-02 only.\n", "  Brillouin and Raman scattering spectroscopy are established techniques for\nthe nondestructive contactless and label-free readout of mechanical, chemical\nand structural properties of condensed matter. Brillouin-Raman investigations\ncurrently require separate measurements and a site-matching approach to obtain\ncomplementary information from a sample. Here we demonstrate a new concept of\nfully scanning multimodal micro-spectroscopy for simultaneous detection of\nBrillouin and Raman light scattering in an exceptionally wide spectral range,\nfrom fractions of GHz to hundreds of THz. It yields an unprecedented 150 dB\ncontrast, which is especially important for the analysis of opaque or turbid\nmedia such as biomedical samples, and a spatial resolution on sub-cellular\nscale. We report the first applications of this new multimodal method to a\nrange of systems, from a single cell to the fast reaction kinetics of a curing\nprocess, and the mechano-chemical mapping of highly scattering biological\nsamples.\n", "  We introduce antiferroelectric topological insulators as a new class of\nfunctional materials in which an electric field can be used to control\ntopological order and induce topological phase transitions. Using first\nprinciples methods, we predict that several alkali-MgBi orthorhombic members of\nan $ABC$ family of compounds are antiferroelectric topological insulators. We\nalso show that epitaxial strain and hydrostatic pressure can be used to tune\nthe topological order and the band gap of these $ABC$ compounds.\nAntiferroelectric topological insulators could enable precise control of\ntopology using electric fields, enhancing the applicability of topological\nmaterials in electronics and spintronics.\n", "  Massive black-hole binaries, formed when galaxies merge, are among the\nprimary sources of gravitational waves targeted by ongoing Pulsar Timing Array\n(PTA) experiments and the upcoming space-based LISA interferometer. However,\ntheir formation and merger rates are still highly uncertain. Recent upper\nlimits on the stochastic gravitational-wave background obtained by PTAs are\nstarting being in marginal tension with theoretical models for the pairing and\norbital evolution of these systems. This tension can be resolved by assuming\nthat these binaries are more eccentric or interact more strongly with the\nenvironment (gas and stars) than expected, or by accounting for possible\nselection biases in the construction of the theoretical models. However,\nanother (pessimistic) possibility is that these binaries do not merge at all,\nbut stall at large ($\\sim$ pc) separations. We explore this extreme scenario by\nusing a galaxy-formation semi-analytic model including massive black holes\n(isolated and in binaries), and show that future generations of PTAs will\ndetect the stochastic gravitational-wave background from the massive black-hole\nbinary population within $10-15$ years of observations, even in the \"nightmare\nscenario\" in which all binaries stall at the hardening radius. Moreover, we\nargue that this scenario is too pessimistic, because our model predicts the\nexistence of a sub-population of binaries with small mass ratios ($q \\lesssim\n10^{-3}$) that should merge within a Hubble time simply as a result of\ngravitational-wave emission. This sub-population will be observable with large\nsignal-to-noise ratios by future PTAs thanks to next-generation radio\ntelescopes such as SKA or FAST, and possibly by LISA.\n", "  We propose a new method for measuring the top-quark width based on the\non-/off-shell ratio of $b$-charge asymmetry in $pp\\to Wbj$ production at the\nLHC. The charge asymmetry removes virtually all backgrounds and related\nuncertainties, while remaining systematic and theoretical uncertainties can be\ntaken under control by the ratio of cross sections. Limited only by statistical\nerror, in an optimistic scenario, we find that our approach leads to good\nprecision at high integrated luminosity, at a few hundred MeV assuming 300-3000\nfb$^{-1}$ at the LHC. The approach directly probes the total width, in such a\nway that model-dependence can be minimized. It is complementary to existing\ncross section measurements which always leave a degeneracy between the total\nrate and the branching ratio, and provides valuable information about the\nproperties of the top quark. The proposal opens up new opportunities for\nprecision top measurements using a $b$-charge identification algorithm.\n", "  We analyze the optical counterpart to the ultra-compact high velocity cloud\nAGC 226067, utilizing imaging taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS)\non the Hubble Space Telescope. The color magnitude diagram of the main body of\nAGC 226067 reveals an exclusively young stellar population, with an age of\n$\\sim$7--50 Myr, and is consistent with a metallicity of [Fe/H]$\\sim$$-$0.3 as\nprevious work has measured via HII region spectroscopy. Additionally, the color\nmagnitude diagram is consistent with a distance of $D$$\\approx$17 Mpc,\nsuggesting an association with the Virgo cluster. A secondary stellar system\nlocated $\\sim$1.6' ($\\sim$8 kpc) away in projection has a similar stellar\npopulation. The lack of an old red giant branch ($\\gtrsim$5 Gyr) is contrasted\nwith a serendipitously discovered Virgo dwarf in the ACS field of view (Dw\nJ122147+132853), and the total diffuse light from AGC~226067 is consistent with\nthe luminosity function of the resolved $\\sim$7--50 Myr stellar population. The\nmain body of AGC~226067 has a $M_{V}$=$-$11.3$\\pm$0.3, or\n$M_{stars}$=5.4$\\pm$1.3$\\times$10$^4$ $M_{\\odot}$ given the stellar population.\nWe searched 20 deg$^2$ of imaging data adjacent to AGC~226067 in the Virgo\nCluster, and found two similar stellar systems dominated by a blue stellar\npopulation, far from any massive galaxy counterpart -- if this population has\nsimilar star formation properties as AGC~226067, it implies $\\sim$0.1\n$M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ in Virgo intracluster star formation. Given its unusual\nstellar population, AGC~226067 is likely a stripped remnant and is plausibly\nthe result of compressed gas from the ram pressure stripped M86 subgroup\n($\\sim$350 kpc away in projection) as it falls into the Virgo Cluster.\n", "  A well-studied possibility is that dark matter may reside in a sector\nsecluded from the Standard Model, except for the so-called photon portal:\nkinetic mixing between the ordinary and dark photons. Such interactions can be\nprobed at dark matter direct detection experiments, and new experimental\ntechniques involving detection of dark matter-electron scattering offer new\nsensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter. Typically however it is implicitly assumed\nthat the dark matter is not altered as it traverses the Earth to arrive at the\ndetector. In this paper we study in detail the effects of terrestrial stopping\non dark photon models of dark matter, and find that they significantly reduce\nthe sensitivity of XENON10 and DAMIC. In particular we find that XENON10 only\nexcludes masses in the range (5-3000) MeV while DAMIC only probes (20-50) MeV.\nTheir corresponding cross section sensitivity is reduced to a window of cross\nsections between $(5\\times 10^{-38}-10^{-30})~{\\rm cm}^{2}$ for XENON10 and a\nsmall window around $\\sim 10^{-31}~{\\rm cm}^{2}$ for DAMIC. We also examine\nimplications for a future DAMIC run.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos at the eV scale have long been studied in the context of\nanomalies in short baseline neutrino experiments. Their cosmology can be made\ncompatible with our understanding of the early Universe provided the sterile\nneutrino sector enjoys a nontrivial dynamics with exotic interactions, possibly\nproviding a link to the Dark Matter (DM) puzzle. Interactions between DM and\nneutrinos have also been proposed to address the long-standing \"missing\nsatellites\" problem in the field of large scale structure formation. Motivated\nby these considerations, in this paper we discuss realistic scenarios with\nlight steriles coupled to DM. We point out that within this framework active\nneutrinos acquire an effective coupling to DM that manifests itself as a new\nmatter potential in the propagation within a medium of asymmetric DM. Assuming\nthat at least a small fraction of asymmetric DM has been captured by the Sun,\nwe show that a sizable region of the parameter space of these scenarios can be\nprobed by solar neutrino experiments, especially in the regime of small\ncouplings and light mediators where all other probes become inefficient. In the\nlatter regime these scenarios behave as familiar $3+1$ models in all channels\nexcept for solar data, where a Solar Dark MSW effect takes place. Solar Dark\nMSW is characterized by modifications of the most energetic $^8$B and CNO\nneutrinos, whereas the other fluxes remain largely unaffected.\n", "  Reliable and robust methods of predicting the crystal structure of a\ncompound, based only on its chemical composition, is crucial to the study of\nmaterials and their applications. Despite considerable ongoing research\nefforts, crystal structure prediction remains a challenging problem that\ndemands large computational resources. Here we propose an efficient approach\nfor first-principles crystal structure prediction. The new method explores and\nfinds crystal structures by tiling together elementary tetrahedra that are\nenergetically favorable and geometrically matching each other. This approach\nhas three distinguishing features: a favorable building unit, an efficient\ncalculation of local energy, and a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation of crystal\ngrowth. By applying the method to the crystal structure prediction of various\nmaterials, we demonstrate its validity and potential as a promising alternative\nto current methods.\n", "  We present the calibration and background model for the Large Area X-ray\nProportional Counter (LAXPC) detectors on-board AstroSat. LAXPC instrument has\nthree nominally identical detectors to achieve large collecting area. These\ndetectors are independent of each other and in the event analysis mode, they\nrecord the arrival time and energy of each photon that is detected. The\ndetectors have a time-resolution of 10 $\\mu$s and a dead-time of about 42\n$\\mu$s. This makes LAXPC ideal for timing studies. The energy resolution and\npeak channel to energy mapping were obtained from calibration on ground using\nradioactive sources coupled with GEANT4 simulations of the detectors. The\nresponse matrix was further refined from observations of the Crab X-ray source\nafter launch. At around 20 keV the energy resolution of detector is about\n10--15\\%, while the combined effective area of the 3 detectors is about 6000\ncm$^2$.\n", "  The persistent radio counterpart of FRB 121102 is estimated to have $N\\sim\n10^{52}$ particles, energy $E_N\\sim 10^{48}$ erg, and size $R\\sim 10^{17}$ cm.\nThe source can be a nebula inflated and heated by an intermittent outflow from\na magnetar --- a neutron star powered by its magnetic (rather than rotational)\nenergy. The object is young and frequently liberating energy in magnetic flares\ndriven by accelerated ambipolar diffusion in the neutron star core, feeding the\nnebula and producing bright millisecond bursts. The particle number in the\nnebula is consistent with ion ejecta from giant flares. The nebula may also\ncontain the freeze-out of electron-positron pairs $N_\\pm\\sim 10^{51}$ created\nmonths after the neutron star birth; the same mechanism offers an explanation\nfor $N_\\pm$ in the Crab nebula. The persistent source around FRB 121102 is\nlikely heated by magnetic dissipation and internal waves excited by the\nmagnetar ejecta. The volumetric heating by waves explains the nebula's enormous\nefficiency in producing radio emission. The repeating radio bursts are\nsuggested to occur much closer to the magnetar, whose flaring magnetosphere\ndrives ultrarelativistic internal shocks into the magnetar wind. The shocks are\nmediated by Larmor rotation that forms a GHz maser with the observed ms\nduration. Furthermore, the flare ejecta can become charge-starved and then\nconvert to electromagnetic waves.\n", "  he DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a general purposed\nsatellite-borne high energy $\\gamma-$ray and cosmic ray detector, and among the\nscientific objectives of DAMPE are the searches for the origin of cosmic rays\nand an understanding of Dark Matter particles. As one of the four detectors in\nDAMPE, the Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD) plays an important role in the\nparticle charge measurement and the photons/electrons separation. The PSD has\n82 modules, each consists of a long organic plastic scintillator bar and two\nPMTs at both ends for readout, in two layers and covers an overall active area\nlarger than 82 cm $\\times$ 82 cm. It can identify the charge states for\nrelativistic ions from H to Fe, and the detector efficiency for Z=1 particles\ncan reach 0.9999. The PSD has been successfully launched with DAMPE on Dec. 17,\n2015. In this paper, the design, the assembly, the qualification tests of the\nPSD and some of the performance measured on the ground have been described in\ndetail.\n", "  The geographical pattern of human dialects is a result of history. Here, we\nformulate a simple spatial model of language change which shows that the final\nresult of this historical evolution may, to some extent, be predictable. The\nmodel shows that the boundaries of language dialect regions are controlled by a\nlength minimizing effect analogous to surface tension, mediated by variations\nin population density which can induce curvature, and by the shape of coastline\nor similar borders. The predictability of dialect regions arises because these\neffects will drive many complex, randomized early states toward one of a\nsmaller number of stable final configurations. The model is able to reproduce\nobservations and predictions of dialectologists. These include dialect\ncontinua, isogloss bundling, fanning, the wave-like spread of dialect features\nfrom cities, and the impact of human movement on the number of dialects that an\narea can support. The model also provides an analytical form for S\\'{e}guy's\nCurve giving the relationship between geographical and linguistic distance, and\na generalisation of the curve to account for the presence of a population\ncentre. A simple modification allows us to analytically characterize the\nvariation of language use by age in an area undergoing linguistic change.\n", "  Application of NaI(Tl) detectors in the search for galactic dark matter\nparticles through their elastic scattering off the target nuclei is well\nmotivated because of the long standing DAMA/LIBRA highly significant positive\nresult on annual modulation, still requiring confirmation. For such a goal, it\nis mandatory to reach very low threshold in energy (at or below the keV level),\nvery low radioactive background (at a few counts/keV/kg/day), and high\ndetection mass (at or above the 100 kg scale). One of the most relevant\ntechnical issues is the optimization of the crystal intrinsic scintillation\nlight yield and the efficiency of the light collecting system for large mass\ncrystals. In the frame of the ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators)\ndark matter search project large NaI(Tl) crystals from different providers\ncoupled to two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been tested at the Canfranc\nUnderground Laboratory. In this paper we present the estimates of the NaI(Tl)\nscintillation light collected using full-absorption peaks at very low energy\nfrom external and internal sources emitting gammas/electrons, and\nsingle-photoelectron events populations selected by using very low energy\npulses tails. Outstanding scintillation light collection at the level of\n15~photoelectrons/keV can be reported for the final design and provider chosen\nfor ANAIS detectors. Taking into account the Quantum Efficiency of the PMT\nunits used, the intrinsic scintillation light yield in these NaI(Tl) crystals\nis above 40~photoelectrons/keV for energy depositions in the range from 3 up to\n25~keV. This very high light output of ANAIS crystals allows triggering below\n1~keV, which is very important in order to increase the sensitivity in the\ndirect detection of dark matter.\n", "  We performed self-consistent calculations of $K^-$-nuclear quasi-bound states\nusing a single-nucleon $K^-$ optical potential derived from chiral meson-baryon\ncoupled-channel interaction models, supplemented by a phenomenological $K^-$\nmultinucleon potential introduced recently to achieve good fits to kaonic atom\ndata [1]. Our calculations show that the effect of $K^-$ multinucleon\ninteractions on $K^-$ widths in nuclei is decisive. The resulting widths are\nconsiderably larger than corresponding binding energies. Moreover, when the\ndensity dependence of the $K^-$-multinucleon interactions derived in the fits\nof kaonic atoms is extended to the nuclear interior, the only two models\nacceptable after imposing as additional constraint the single-nucleon fraction\nof $K^-$ absorption at rest do not yield any kaonic nuclear bound state in\nmajority of considered nuclei.\n", "  The temperature ($T$) - magnetic field ($H$) phase diagram for the tetragonal\nlayered compound CeSbSe, is determined from magnetization, specific heat, and\nelectrical resistivity measurements. This system exhibits complex magnetic\nordering at $T_{\\rm{M}}$ $=$ 3 K and the application of a magnetic field\nresults in a cascade of magnetically ordered states for $H$ $\\lesssim$ 1.8 T\nwhich are characterized by fractional integer size steps: i.e., a possible\nDevil's staircase is observed. Electrical transport measurements show a weak\ntemperature dependence and large residual resistivity which suggest a small\ncharge carrier density and strong scattering from the $f$-moments. These\nfeatures reveal Kondo lattice behavior where the $f$-moments are incompletely\nscreened, resulting in a fine balanced magnetic interaction between different\nCe neighbors that is mediated by the RKKY interaction. This produces the nearly\ndegenerate magnetically ordered states that are accessed under an applied\nmagnetic field.\n", "  The effects of high magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the spontaneous\nferroelectric polarization on single crystals of BiFeO$_3$ were investigated\nthrough magnetization, magnetostriction, and neutron diffraction measurements.\nThe magnetostriction measurements revealed lattice distortion of $2\\times\n10^{-5}$, during the reorientation process of the cycloidal spin order by\napplied magnetic fields. Furthermore, anomalous changes in magnetostriction and\nelectric polarization at a larger field demonstrate an intermediate phase\nbetween cycloidal and canted antiferromagnetic states, where a large\nmagnetoelectric effect was observed. Neutron diffraction measurements clarified\nthat incommensurate spin modulation along [110] direction in the cycloidal\nphase becomes commensurate in the intermediate phase. Theoretical calculations\nbased on the standard spin Hamiltonian of this material suggest an\nantiferromagnetic cone-type spin order in the intermediate phase.\n", "  Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are expected to be very common in the Milky\nWay, but their intrinsic faintness challenges the detection of these systems.\nCurrently, only a few tens of detached DWDs are know. Such systems offer the\nbest chance of extracting the physical properties that would allow us to\naddress a wealth of outstanding questions ranging from the nature of white\ndwarfs, over stellar and binary evolution to mapping the Galaxy. In this paper\nwe explore the prospects for detections of ultra-compact (with binary\nseparations of a few solar radii or less) detached DWDs in: 1) optical\nradiation with Gaia and the LSST and 2) gravitational wave radiation with LISA.\nWe show that Gaia, LSST and LISA have the potential to detect respectively\naround a few hundreds, a thousand, and 25 thousand DWD systems. Moreover, Gaia\nand LSST data will extend by respectively a factor of two and seven the\nguaranteed sample of binaries detected in electromagnetic and gravitational\nwave radiation, opening the era of multi-messenger astronomy for these sources.\n", "  Motivated by a recently found interesting property of the dark halo surface\ndensity within a radius, $r_{\\rm max}$, giving the maximum circular velocity,\n$V_{\\rm max}$, we investigate it for dark halos of the Milky Way's and\nAndromeda's dwarf satellites based on cosmological simulations. We select and\nanalyze the simulated subhalos associated with Milky Way-sized dark halos and\nfind that the values of their surface densities, $\\Sigma_{V_{\\rm max}}$, are in\ngood agreement with those for the observed dwarf spheroidal satellites even\nwithout employing any fitting procedures. This implies that this surface\ndensity would not be largely affected by any baryonic feedbacks and thus\nuniversal. Moreover, all subhalos on the small scales of dwarf satellites are\nexpected to obey the relation $\\Sigma_{V_{\\rm max}}\\propto V_{\\rm max}$,\nirrespective of differences in their orbital evolutions, host halo properties,\nand observed redshifts. Therefore, we find that the universal scaling relation\nfor dark halos on dwarf galaxy mass scales surely exists and provides us\nimportant clues to understanding fundamental properties of dark halos. We also\ninvestigate orbital and dynamical evolutions of subhalos to understand the\norigin of this universal dark halo relation and find that most of subhalos\nevolve generally along the $r_{\\rm max}\\propto V_{\\rm max}$ sequence, even\nthough these subhalos have undergone different histories of mass assembly and\ntidal stripping. This sequence, therefore, should be the key feature to\nunderstand the nature of the universality of $\\Sigma_{V_{\\rm max}}$.\n", "  The string melting version of a multi-phase transport model is often applied\nto high-energy heavy-ion collisions since the dense matter thus formed is\nexpected to be in parton degrees of freedom. In this work we improve its quark\ncoalescence component, which describes the hadronization of the partonic matter\nto a hadronic matter. We removed the previous constraint that forced the\nnumbers of mesons, baryons, and antibaryons in an event to be separately\nconserved through the quark coalescence process. A quark now could form either\na meson or a baryon depending on the distance to its coalescence partner(s). We\nthen compare results from the improved model with the experimental data on\nhadron $dN/dy$, $p_{_{\\rm T}}$ spectra, and $v_2$ in heavy-ion collisions from\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=62.4$ GeV to $5.02$ TeV. We show that, besides being able\nto describe these observables for low-$p_{_{\\rm T}}$ pions and kaons, the\nimproved model also better describes the low-$p_{_{\\rm T}}$ baryon observables\nin general, especially the baryon $p_{_{\\rm T}}$ spectra and\nantibaryon-to-baryon ratios for multistrange baryons.\n", "  We investigate the in-medium masses of a $\\bar{D} (0^-)$ meson and a\n$\\bar{D}_0^* (0^+)$ meson and spectral functions for $\\bar{D}$ and\n$\\bar{D}_0^*$ meson channels in nuclear matter. These mesons are introduced as\nchiral partner in the chiral symmetry broken vacuum, hence they are useful to\nexplore the partial restoration of the broken chiral symmetry in nuclear\nmatter. We consider the linear sigma model to describe the chiral symmetry\nbreaking. Our study shows that the loop corrections to $\\bar{D}$ and\n$\\bar{D}_0^*$ meson masses provide a smaller mass splitting at finite density\nthan that in vacuum, whose result indicates a tendency of the restoration of\nthe chiral symmetry. We investigate also the spectral function for\n$\\bar{D}_0^*$ meson channel, and find three peaks. The first peak which\ncorresponds to the resonance of $\\bar{D}_0^*$ meson is broadened by collisions\nwith nucleons in medium, and the peak position shifts to lower mass due to the\npartial restoration of chiral symmetry as the density increases. The second\npeak is identified as a threshold enhancement which shows a remarkable\nenhancement as the density increase. The third peak is Landau damping. The\nobtained properties of $\\bar{D}$ and $\\bar{D}_0^*$ mesons in nuclear matter\nwill provide useful information for experiments.\n", "  Recent advances in time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy have unveiled\nthat resonantly-enhanced strong THz third-harmonic generation (THG) mediated by\nthe collective Higgs amplitude mode occurs in s-wave superconductors, where\ncharge-density fluctuations (CDF) have also been shown to contribute to the\nnonlinear third-order susceptibility. It has been theoretically proposed that\nthe nonlinear responses of Higgs and CDF exhibit essentially different\npolarization dependences. Here we experimentally discriminate the two\ncontributions by polarization-resolved intense THz transmission spectroscopy\nfor a single-crystal NbN film. The result shows that the resonant THG in the\ntransmitted light always appears in the polarization parallel to that of the\nincident light with no appreciable crystal axis dependence. When we compare\nthis with the theoretical calculation here with the BCS approximation and the\ndynamical mean-field theory for a model of NbN constructed from first\nprinciples, the experimental result strongly indicates that the Higgs mode\nrather than the CDF dominates the THG resonance in NbN. A possible mechanism\nfor this is discussed such as the retardation effect in the phonon-mediated\npairing interaction beyond BCS.\n", "  We introduce the FirstLight project that aims to generate a large database of\nhigh-resolution, zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation around the epoch of\nreionisation ($z\\geq6$). The first results of this program agree well with\nrecent observational constraints at z=6-8, including the UV luminosity function\nand galaxy stellar mass function, as well as the scaling relationships between\nhalo mass, stellar mass, and UV magnitude. The UV luminosity function starts to\nflatten below MUV>-14 due to stellar feedback in halos with maximum circular\nvelocities of V=30-40 km/s. The power-law slope of the luminosity function\nevolves rapidly with redshift, reaching a value of alpha=-2.5 at z=10. On the\nother hand, the galaxy stellar mass function evolves slowly with time between\nz=8-10, in particular at the low-mass end.\n", "  Quantum charge pumping phenomenon connects band topology through the dynamics\nof a one-dimensional quantum system. In terms of a microscopic model, the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger/Rice-Mele quantum pump continues to serve as a fruitful\nstarting point for many considerations of topological physics. Here we present\na generalized Creutz scheme as a distinct two-band quantum pump model. By\nnoting that it undergoes two kinds of topological band transitions accompanying\nwith a Zak-phase-difference of $\\pi$ and $2\\pi$, respectively, various charge\npumping schemes are studied by applying an elaborate Peierl's phase\nsubstitution. Translating into real space, the transportation of quantized\ncharges is a result of cooperative quantum interference effect. In particular,\nan all-flux quantum pump emerges which operates with time-varying fluxes only\nand transports two charge units. This puts cold atoms with artificial gauge\nfields as an unique system where this kind of phenomena can be realized.\n", "  We construct a generalization of Witten's Kaluza-Klein instanton, where a\nhigher-dimensional sphere (rather than a circle as in Witten's instanton)\ncollapses to zero size and the geometry terminates at a bubble of nothing, in a\nlow energy effective theory of M theory. We use the solution to exhibit\ninstability of non-supersymmetric AdS_5 vacua in M Theory compactified on\npositive Kaehler-Einstein spaces, providing a further evidence for the recent\nconjecture that any non-supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum supported by\nfluxes must be unstable.\n", "  We present a systematic investigation of the effects of roughness geometry on\nturbulent Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection (RBC) over rough plates with\npyramid-shaped and periodically distributed roughness elements. Using a\nparameter $\\lambda$ defined as the height of a roughness element over its base\nwidth, the heat transport, the flow dynamics and local temperatures are\nmeasured for the Rayleigh number range $7.50\\times 10^{7} \\leq Ra\\leq\n1.31\\times 10^{11}$, and the Prandtl number $Pr$ from 3.57 to 23.34 at four\nvalues of $\\lambda$. It is found that the heat transport scaling, i.e. $Nu\\sim\nRa^{\\alpha}$ where $Nu$ is the Nusselt number, may be classified into three\nregimes. In Regime I, the system is in a dynamically smooth state. The heat\ntransport scaling is the same as that in a smooth cell. In Regimes II and III,\nthe heat transport enhances. When $\\lambda$ is increased from 0.5 to 4.0,\n$\\alpha$ increases from 0.36 to 0.59 in Regime II, and it increases from 0.30\nto 0.50 in Regime III. The experiment demonstrates the heat transport scaling\nin turbulent RBC can be manipulated using $\\lambda$. Previous studies suggest\nthat the transition from Regime I to Regime II, occurs when the thermal\nboundary layer (BL) thickness becomes smaller than the roughness height $h$.\nDirect measurements of the viscous BL in the present study suggest that the\ntransition from Regime II to Regime III is likely a result of the viscous BL\nthickness becoming smaller $h$. The scaling exponent of the Reynolds number\n$Re$ vs. $Ra$ changes from 0.471 to 0.551 when $\\lambda$ is increased from 0.5\nto 4.0. It is also found that increasing $\\lambda$ increases the clustering of\nthermal plumes which effectively increases the plumes lifetime that are\nultimately responsible for the enhanced heat transport.\n", "  The electronic and thermal transport properties of the Earth's core are\ncrucial for many geophysical models such as the geodynamo model of the Earth's\nmagnetic field and of its reversals. Here we show, by considering bcc-iron and\niron-rich iron-silicon alloy as a representative of the Earth's core\ncomposition and applying the first-principles modeling that the spin disorder\nat the Earth's core conditions provides an essential contribution, of order\n20~$\\mu\\Omega$\\,cm, to the electrical resistivity. This value is comparable in\nmagnitude with the electron-phonon and with the recently estimated\nelectron-electron scattering contributions. The origin of the spin-disorder\nresistivity (SDR) consists in the existence of fluctuating local moments that\nare stabilized at high temperatures by the magnetic entropy even at pressures\nat which the ground state of iron is non-magnetic. We find that electron-phonon\nand SDR contributions are not additive at high temperatures. We thus observe a\nlarge violation of the Matthiessen rule, not common in conventional metallic\nalloys at ambient conditions.\n", "  The self-consistent harmonic approximation is an effective harmonic theory to\ncalculate the free energy of systems with strongly anharmonic atomic\nvibrations, and its stochastic implementation has proved to be an efficient\nmethod to study, from first-principles, the anharmonic properties of solids.\nThe free energy as a function of average atomic positions (centroids) can be\nused to study quantum or thermal lattice instability. In particular the\ncentroids are order parameters in second-order structural phase transitions\nsuch as, e.g., charge-density-waves or ferroelectric instabilities. According\nto Landau's theory, the knowledge of the second derivative of the free energy\n(i.e. the curvature) with respect to the centroids in a high-symmetry\nconfiguration allows the identification of the phase-transition and of the\ninstability modes. In this work we derive the exact analytic formula for the\nsecond derivative of the free energy in the self-consistent harmonic\napproximation for a generic atomic configuration. The analytic derivative is\nexpressed in terms of the atomic displacements and forces in a form that can be\nevaluated by a stochastic technique using importance sampling. Our approach is\nparticularly suitable for applications based on first-principles\ndensity-functional-theory calculations, where the forces on atoms can be\nobtained with a negligible computational effort compared to total energy\ndetermination. Finally we propose a dynamical extension of the theory to\ncalculate spectral properties of strongly anharmonic phonons, as probed by\ninelastic scattering processes. We illustrate our method with a numerical\napplication on a toy model that mimics the ferroelectric transition in\nrock-salt crystals such as SnTe or GeTe.\n", "  We present results of a detailed theoretical study of the electronic,\nmagnetic, and structural properties of the chalcogenide parent system FeSe\nusing a fully charge self-consistent implementation of the density functional\ntheory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) method. In particular, we\npredict a remarkable change of the electronic structure of FeSe which is\naccompanied by a complete reconstruction of the Fermi surface topology\n(Lifshitz transition) upon a moderate expansion of the lattice volume. The\nphase transition results in a change of the in-plane magnetic nesting wave\nvector from $(\\pi,\\pi)$ to $(\\pi,0)$ and is associated with a transition from\nitinerant to orbital-selective localized magnetic moments. We attribute this\nbehavior to a correlation-induced shift of the van Hove singularity of the Fe\n$t_{2}$ bands at the M-point across the Fermi level. Our results reveal a\nstrong orbital-selective renormalization of the effective mass $m^*/m$ of the\nFe $3d$ electrons upon expansion. The largest effect occurs in the Fe $xy$\norbital, which gives rise to a non-Fermi-liquid-like behavior above the\ntransition. The behavior of the momentum-resolved magnetic susceptibility\n$\\chi({\\bf q})$ demonstrates that magnetic correlations are also characterized\nby a pronounced orbital selectivity, suggesting a spin-fluctuation origin of\nthe nematic phase of paramagnetic FeSe. We conjecture that the anomalous\nbehavior of FeSe upon expansion is associated with the proximity of the Fe\n$t_{2}$ van Hove singularity to the Fermi level and the sensitive dependence of\nits position on external conditions.\n", "  In the present paper we have constructed a new relativistic anisotropic\ncompact star model having a spherically symmetric metric of embedding class\none. Here we have assumed an arbitrary form of metric function and solved the\nEinstein relativistic field equations with the help of Karmarkar condition for\nan anisotropic matter distri- bution. The physical properties of our model such\nas pressure, density, mass function, surface red-shift, gravitational red-shift\nare investigated and the stability of the stellar configuration is discussed in\ndetails. Our model is free from central singularities and satisfies all energy\nconditions. The model we present here satisfy the static stability criterion.\n", "  It is proposed that strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields in Dirac and Weyl\nmaterials could be used as valley and chirality sensitive lenses for beams of\nWeyl quasiparticles. The study of the (pseudo-)magnetic lenses is performed by\nusing the eikonal approximation for describing the Weyl quasiparticles\npropagation in magnetic and strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields. Analytical\nexpressions for the locations of the principal foci and the focal lengths are\nobtained in the paraxial approximation in the models with uniform as well as\nnonuniform effective magnetic fields inside the lens. The results show that the\nleft- and right-handed quasiparticles can be focused at different spatial\nlocations when both magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields are applied. It is\nsuggested that the use of magnetic and pseudomagnetic lenses could open new\nways of producing and manipulating beams of chiral Weyl quasiparticles.\n", "  Taking into account the current global information on neutrino oscillation\nparameters we forecast the capabilities of future long baseline experiments\nsuch as DUNE and T2HK in settling the atmospheric octant puzzle. We find that a\ngood measurement of the reactor angle $\\theta_{13}$ plays a key role in fixing\nthe octant of the atmospheric angle $\\theta_{23}$ with such future accelerator\nneutrino studies.\n", "  We investigate the interactions of photoexcited carriers with lattice\nvibrations in thin films of the layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)\nWSe$_2$. Employing femtosecond electron diffraction with monocrystalline\nsamples and first principle density functional theory calculations, we obtain a\nmomentum-resolved picture of the energy-transfer from excited electrons to\nphonons. The measured momentum-dependent phonon population dynamics are\ncompared to first principle calculations of the phonon linewidth and can be\nrationalized in terms of electronic phase-space arguments. The relaxation of\nexcited states in the conduction band is dominated by intervalley scattering\nbetween $\\Sigma$ valleys and the emission of zone-boundary phonons.\nTransiently, the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling leads to a\nnon-thermal phonon distribution, which, on longer timescales, relaxes to a\nthermal distribution via electron-phonon and phonon-phonon collisions. Our\nresults constitute a basis for monitoring and predicting out of equilibrium\nelectrical and thermal transport properties for nanoscale applications of\nTMDCs.\n", "  The variational tensor network renormalization approach to two-dimensional\n(2D) quantum systems at finite temperature is applied for the first time to a\nmodel suffering the notorious quantum Monte Carlo sign problem --- the orbital\n$e_g$ model with spatially highly anisotropic orbital interactions.\nCoarse-graining of the tensor network along the inverse temperature $\\beta$\nyields a numerically tractable 2D tensor network representing the Gibbs state.\nIts bond dimension $D$ --- limiting the amount of entanglement --- is a natural\nrefinement parameter. Increasing $D$ we obtain a converged order parameter and\nits linear susceptibility close to the critical point. They confirm the\nexistence of finite order parameter below the critical temperature $T_c$,\nprovide a numerically exact estimate of~$T_c$, and give the critical exponents\nwithin $1\\%$ of the 2D Ising universality class.\n", "  We investigate a kinetic Ising model with several single-spin flip dynamics\n(including Metropolis and heat-bath) on quenched and annealed random regular\ngraphs. As expected, on the quenched structures all proposed algorithms\nreproduce the same results since the conditions for the detailed balance and\nthe Boltzmann distribution in an equilibrium are satisfied. However, on the\nannealed graphs situation is far less clear -- the network annealing disturbs\nthe equilibrium moving the system away from it. Consequently, distinct dynamics\nlead to different steady states. We show that some algorithms are more\nresistant to the annealed disorder, which causes only small quantitative\nchanges in the model behavior. On the other hand, there are dynamics for which\nthe influence of annealing on the system is significant, and qualitative\nchanges arise like switching the type of phase transition from continuous to\ndiscontinuous one. We try to identify features of the proposed dynamics which\nare responsible for the above phenomenon.\n", "  The transitionless tracking (TT) algorithm enables the exact tracking of\nquantum adiabatic dynamics in an arbitrary short time by adding a\ncounterdiabatic Hamiltonian to the original adiabatic Hamiltonian. By applying\nHusimi's method originally developed for a quantum parametric oscillator (QPO)\nto the transitionless QPO achieved using the TT algorithm, we obtain the\ntransition probability generating function with a time-dependent parameter\nconstituted with solutions of the corresponding classical parametric oscillator\n(CPO). By obtaining the explicit solutions of this CPO using the\nphase-amplitude method, we find that the time-dependent parameter can be\nreduced to the frequency ratio between the Hamiltonians without and with the\ncounterdiabatic Hamiltonian, from which we can easily characterize the result\nachieved by the TT algorithm. We illustrate our theory by showing the\ntrajectories of the CPO on the classical phase space, which elucidate the\neffect of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian of the QPO.\n", "  \"Hot super-Earths\" (or \"Mini-Neptunes\") between 1 and 4 times Earth's size\nwith period shorter than 100 days orbit 30-50\\% of Sun-like type stars. Their\norbital configuration -- measured as the period ratio distribution of adjacent\nplanets in multi-planet systems -- is a strong constraint for formation models.\nHere we use N-body simulations with synthetic forces from an underlying\nevolving gaseous disk to model the formation and long-term dynamical evolution\nof super-Earth systems. While the gas disk is present, planetary embryos grow\nand migrate inward to form a resonant chain anchored at the inner edge of the\ndisk. These resonant chains are far more compact than the observed super-Earth\nsystems. Once the gas dissipates resonant chains may become dynamically\nunstable. They undergo a phase of giant impacts that spreads the systems out.\nDisk turbulence has no measurable effect on the outcome. Our simulations match\nobservations if a small fraction of resonant chains remain stable, while most\nsuper-Earths undergo a late dynamical instability. Our statistical analysis\nrestricts the contribution of stable systems to less than $25\\%$. Our results\nalso suggest that the large fraction of observed single planet systems does not\nnecessarily imply any dichotomy in the architecture of planetary systems.\nFinally, we use the low abundance of resonances in Kepler data to argue that,\nin reality, the survival of resonant chains happens likely only in $\\sim 5\\%$\nof the cases. This leads to a mystery: in our simulations only 50-60\\% of\nresonant chains became unstable whereas at least 75\\% (and probably 90-95\\%)\nmust be unstable to match observations.\n", "  We report the discovery of a massive $\\log(M/M_\\odot)=10.74^{+0.18}_{-0.16}$\ngalaxy at the same redshift as a carbon-monoxide-bearing sub-damped Lyman\n$\\alpha$ absorber (sub-DLA) seen in the spectrum of QSO J1439+1117. The galaxy,\nJ1439B, is located 4\\farcs7 from the QSO sightline, a projected distance of 38\nphysical kpc at $z=2.4189$, and exhibits broad optical emission lines\n($\\sigma_{\\rm{[O III]}}=303 \\pm 12$~\\kms) with ratios characteristic of\nexcitation by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The galaxy has a factor of\n$\\sim$9 lower star formation than is typical of star-forming galaxies of the\nsame mass and redshift. The nearby sub-DLA is highly enriched, suggesting its\ngalactic counterpart must be massive if it follows the $z\\sim2$\nmass-metallicity relationship. Metallic absorption within the circumgalactic\nmedium of the sub-DLA and J1439B is spread over a velocity range $\\Delta v >\n1000$ \\kms, suggesting an energetic origin. We explore the possibility that a\ndifferent galaxy could be responsible for the rare absorber, and conclude that\nit is unlikely based on imaging, integral-field spectroscopy, and high-$z$\nmassive galaxy pair statistics. We argue that the gas seen in absorption\nagainst the QSO was likely ejected from the galaxy J1439B and therefore\nprovides a unique observational probe of AGN feedback in the distant universe.\n", "  Observations of the most luminous quasars at redshift z>6 reveal the\nexistence of numerous supermasssive black holes (>10^9 Msun) already in place\nabout twelve billion years ago. In addition, the interstellar medium of the\ngalaxies hosting these black holes are observed to be chemically mature\nsystems, with metallicities (Z>Zsun) and dust masses (>10^8 Msun) similar to\nthat of more evolved, local galaxies. The connection between the rapid growth\nof the first supermassive black holes and the fast chemical evolution of the\nhost galaxy is one of the most puzzling issues for theoretical models. Here we\nreview state-of-the-art theoretical models that focus on this problem with\nparticular emphasis on the conditions that lead to the formation of quasar\nseeds and their subsequent evolution at z>6.\n", "  We develop a theory of the dynamical response of a minimal model of quantum\nspin ice (QSI) by means of inelastic light scattering. In particular, we are\ninterested in the Raman response of the fractionalized U(1) spin liquid\nrealized in the XXZ QSI. We show that the low-energy Raman intensity is\ndominated by spinon and gauge fluctuations. We find that the Raman response in\nthe QSI state of that model appears only in the $T_{2g}$ polarization channel.\nWe show that the Raman intensity profile displays a broad continuum from the\nspinons and coupled spinon and gauge fluctuations, and a low-energy peak\narising entirely from gauge fluctuations. Both features originate from the\nexotic interaction between photon and the fractionalized excitations of QSI.\nOur theoretical results suggest that inelastic Raman scattering can in\nprinciple serve as a promising experimental probe of the nature of a U(1) spin\nliquid in QSI.\n", "  We study photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) near the ionization\nthreshold with a newly developed Coulomb quantum-orbit strong-field\napproximation (CQSFA) theory. The CQSFA simulations present an excellent\nagreement with the result from time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation method. We\nshow that the low-energy fan-shaped structure in the PADs corresponds to a\nsubcycle time-resolved holographic structure and stems from the significant\ninfluence of the Coulomb potential on the phase of the forward-scattering\nelectron trajectories, which affects different momenta and scattering angles\nunequally. For the first time, our work provides a direct explanation of how\nthe fan-shaped structure is formed, based on the quantum interference of direct\nand forward-scattered orbits.\n", "  We investigate properties of the ground state of a light quark matter with\nheavy quark impurities. This system exhibits the \"QCD Kondo effect\" where the\ninteraction strength between a light quark near the Fermi surface and a heavy\nquark increases with decreasing energy of the light quark towards the Fermi\nenergy, and diverges at some scale near the Fermi energy, called the Kondo\nscale. Around and below the Kondo scale, we must treat the dynamics\nnonperturbatively. As a typical nonperturbative method to treat the strong\ncoupling regime, we adopt a mean-field approach where we introduce a\ncondensate, the Kondo condensate, representing a mixing between a light quark\nand a heavy quark, and determine the ground state in the presence of the Kondo\ncondensate. We show that the ground state is a topologically non-trivial state\nand the heavy quark spin forms the hedgehog configuration in the momentum\nspace. We can define the Berry phase for the ground-state wavefunction in the\nmomentum space which is associated with a monopole at the position of a heavy\nquark. We also investigate fluctuations around the mean field in the\nrandom-phase approximation, and show the existence of (exciton-like) collective\nexcitations made of a hole $h$ of a light quark and a heavy quark $Q$.\n", "  We present the results of a seven-year-long radial velocity survey of a\nsample of 88 main-sequence and evolved stars to reveal signatures of\nJupiter-mass planets in the solar-age and solar-metallicity open cluster M67.\nWe aim at studying the frequency of giant planets in this cluster with respect\nto the field stars. In addition, our sample is also ideal to perform a\nlong-term study to compare the chemical composition of stars with and without\ngiant planets in detail. We analyzed precise radial velocity (RV) measurements\nobtained with five different instruments. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations\nto estimate the occurrence rate of giant planets in our radial velocity survey.\nAll the planets previously announced in this RV campaign with their properties\nare summarized here: 3 hot Jupiters around the main-sequence stars YBP1194,\nYBP1514, and YBP401, and 1 giant planet around the evolved star S364. Two\nadditional planet candidates around the stars YBP778 and S978 are also analyzed\nin the present work. We discuss stars that exhibit large RV variability or\ntrends individually. For 2 additional stars, long-term trends are compatible\nwith new binary candidates or substellar objects, which increases the total\nnumber of binary candidates detected in our campaign to 14. Based on the\nDoppler-detected planets discovered in this survey, we find an occurrence of\ngiant planets of ~18.0%(+12.0/-8.0%) in the selected period-mass range. This\nfrequency is slightly higher but consistent within the errors with the estimate\nfor the field stars, which leads to the general conclusion that open cluster\nand field statistics agree. However, we find that the rate of hot Jupiters in\nthe cluster (~5.7%(+5.5/-3.0%)) is substantially higher than in the field.\n", "  Collective reaction paths for fusion reactions, $^{16}$O+$\\alpha$\n$\\rightarrow$ $^{20}$Ne and $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O $\\rightarrow$ $^{32}$S, are\nmicroscopically determined, on the basis of the adiabatic self-consistent\ncollective coordinate (ASCC) method. The collective path is maximally decoupled\nfrom other intrinsic degrees of freedom. The reaction paths turn out to deviate\nfrom those obtained with standard mean-field calculations with constraints on\nquadrupole and octupole moments. The potentials and inertial masses defined in\nthe ASCC method are calculated along the reaction paths. The sub-barrier fusion\ncross sections are calculated for these systems. Inertial mass inside the\nCoulomb barrier may have a significant influence on the fusion cross section at\nthe deep sub-barrier energy.\n", "  We report on the discovery and transport study of the superconducting ground\nstate present at the (111)LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. The superconducting\ntransition is consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and\nits 2D nature is further corroborated by the anisotropy of the critical\nmagnetic field, as calculated by Tinkham. The estimated superconducting layer\nthickness and coherence length are 10 nm and 60 nm, respectively. The results\nof this work provide a new platform to clarify the microscopic details of\nsuperconductivity at LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, in particular in what\nconcerns the link with orbital symmetry.\n", "  We consider the impedance tomography problem in the plane. Using Bukhgeim's\nscattering data for the Dirac problem, we prove that the conductivity is\nuniquely determined by the Dirichlet-to-Neuman map\n", "  The propagation of microwaves across a turbulent plasma density layer is\ninvestigated with full-wave simulations. To properly represent a fusion\nedge-plasma, drift-wave turbulence is considered based on the Hasegawa-Wakatani\nmodel. Scattering and broadening of a microwave beam whose amplitude\ndistribution is of Gaussian shape is studied in detail as a function of certain\nturbulence properties. Parameters leading to the strongest deterioration of the\nmicrowave beam are identified and implications for existing experiments are\ngiven.\n", "  We present a sample of 115 very low optical surface brightness, highly\nextended, HI-rich galaxies carefully selected from the ALFALFA survey that have\nsimilar optical absolute magnitudes, surface brightnesses, and radii to\nrecently discovered \"ultra-diffuse\" galaxies (UDGs). However, these systems are\nbluer and have more irregular morphologies than other UDGs, are isolated, and\ncontain significant reservoirs of HI. We find that while these sources have\nnormal star formation rates for HI selected galaxies of similar stellar mass,\nthey have very low star formation efficiencies. We further present deep optical\nand HI synthesis follow up imaging of three of these HI-bearing ultra-diffuse\nsources. We measure HI diameters extending to ~40 kpc, but note that while all\nthree sources have large HI diameters for their stellar mass, they are\nconsistent with the HI mass - HI radius relation. We further analyze the HI\nvelocity widths and rotation velocities for the unresolved and resolved sources\nrespectively, and find that the sources appear to inhabit halos of dwarf\ngalaxies. We estimate spin parameters, and suggest that these sources may exist\nin high spin parameter halos, and as such may be potential HI-rich progenitors\nto the ultra-diffuse galaxies observed in cluster environments.\n", "  Perturbation theory using self-consistent Green's functions is one of the\nmost widely used approaches to study many-body effects in condensed matter. On\nthe basis of general considerations and by performing analytical calculations\nfor the specific example of the Hubbard atom, we discuss some key features of\nthis approach. We show that when the domain of the functionals that are used to\nrealize the map between the non-interacting and the interacting Green's\nfunctions is properly defined, there exists a class of self-energy functionals\nfor which the self-consistent Dyson equation has only one solution, which is\nthe physical one. We also show that manipulation of the perturbative expansion\nof the interacting Green's function may lead to a wrong self-energy as\nfunctional of the interacting Green's function, at least for some regions of\nthe parameter space. These findings confirm and explain numerical results of\nKozik et al. for the widely used skeleton series of Luttinger and Ward [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 114, 156402]. Our study shows that it is important to distinguish\nbetween the maps between sets of functions and the functionals that realize\nthose maps. We demonstrate that the self-consistent Green's functions approach\nitself is not problematic, whereas the functionals that are widely used may\nhave a limited range of validity.\n", "  We show that the blue and UV excess emission at the first few days of some\ntype Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be accounted for in the double degenerate (DD)\nscenario by the collision of the SN ejecta with circumstellar matter that was\nblown by the accretion disk formed during the merger process of the two white\ndwarfs (WDs). We assume that in cases of excess early light the disk blows the\ncircumstellar matter, that we term disk-originated matter (DOM), hours to days\nbefore explosion. To perform our analysis we first provide a model-based\ndefinition for early excess light, replacing the definition of excess light\nrelative to a power-law fit to the rising luminosity. We then examine the light\ncurves of the SNe Ia iPTF14atg and SN 2012cg, and find that the collision of\nthe ejecta with a DOM in the frame of the DD scenario can account for their\nearly excess emission. Thus, early excess light does not necessarily imply the\npresence of a stellar companion in the frame of the single-degenerate scenario.\nOur findings further increase the variety of phenomena that the DD scenario can\naccount for, and emphasize the need to consider all different SN Ia scenarios\nwhen interpreting observations.\n", "  Pressure-induced superconductivity and structural phase transitions in\nphosphorous (P) are studied by resistivity measurements under pressures up to\n170 GPa and fully $ab-initio$ crystal structure and superconductivity\ncalculations up to 350 GPa. Two distinct superconducting transition temperature\n(T$_{c}$) vs. pressure ($P$) trends at low pressure have been reported more\nthan 30 years ago, and for the first time we are able to reproduce them and\ndevise a consistent explanation founded on thermodynamically metastable phases\nof black-phosphorous. Our experimental and theoretical results form a single,\nconsistent picture which not only provides a clear understanding of elemental P\nunder pressure but also sheds light on the long-standing and unsolved\n$anomalous$ superconductivity trend. Moreover, at higher pressures we predict a\nsimilar scenario of multiple metastable structures which coexist beyond their\nthermodynamical stability range. Metastable phases of P experimentally\naccessible at pressures above 240 GPa should exhibit T$_{c}$'s as high as 15 K,\ni.e. three times larger than the predicted value for the ground-state crystal\nstructure. We observe that all the metastable structures systematically exhibit\nlarger transition temperatures than the ground-state ones, indicating that the\nexploration of metastable phases represents a promising route to design\nmaterials with improved superconducting properties.\n", "  Two-body charmless hadronic $B_c$ decays involving a light\n$1^3\\!P_2$-tensor($T$) meson are investigated for the first time within the\nframework of perturbative QCD(pQCD) at leading order, in which the other meson\nis the lightest pseudoscalar($P$) or vector($V$) state. The concerned processes\ncan only occur through the pure weak annihilation topology in the standard\nmodel. We predict the CP-averaged branching ratios and polarization fractions\nof those considered decays in Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa(CKM) favored and\nsuppressed modes. Phenomenologically, several modes$-$such as the $B_c \\to\nK_2^*(1430) K$ and the CKM-favored $B_c \\to TV-$have large decay rates of\n$10^{-6}$, which are expected to be detected at Large Hadron Collider\nexperiments in the near future. Moreover, all of the $B_c \\to TV$ modes are\ngoverned by the longitudinal amplitudes in the pQCD calculations and the\ncorresponding fractions vary around $78\\%$-$98\\%$. A confirmation of these\nresults could prove the reliability of the pQCD approach used here and further\nshed some light on the annihilation decay mechanism.\n", "  We report on a spectral study at radio frequencies of the giant radio halo in\nA2142 (z=0.0909), which we performed to explore its nature and origin. A2142 is\nnot a major merger and the presence of a giant radio halo is somewhat\nsurprising. We performed deep radio observations with the GMRT at 608 MHz, 322\nMHz, and 234 MHz and with the VLA in the 1-2 GHz band. We obtained high-quality\nimages at all frequencies in a wide range of resolutions. The radio halo is\nwell detected at all frequencies and extends out to the most distant cold front\nin A2142. We studied the spectral index in two regions: the central part of the\nhalo and a second region in the direction of the most distant south-eastern\ncold front, selected to follow the bright part of the halo and X-ray emission.\nWe complemented our observations with a preliminary LOFAR image at 118 MHz and\nwith the re-analysis of archival VLA data at 1.4 GHz. The two components of the\nradio halo show different observational properties. The central brightest part\nhas higher surface brightess and a spectrum whose steepness is similar to those\nof the known radio halos, i.e. $\\alpha^{\\rm 1.78~GHz}_{\\rm 118~MHz}=1.33\\pm\n0.08$. The ridge, which fades into the larger scale emission, is broader in\nsize and has considerably lower surface brightess and a moderately steeper\nspectrum, i.e. $\\alpha^{\\rm 1.78~GHz}_{\\rm 118~MHz}\\sim 1.5$. We propose that\nthe brightest part of the radio halo is powered by the central sloshing in\nA2142, similar to what has been suggested for mini-halos, or by secondary\nelectrons generated by hadronic collisions in the ICM. On the other hand, the\nsteeper ridge may probe particle re-acceleration by turbulence generated either\nby stirring the gas and magnetic fields on a larger scale or by less energetic\nmechanisms, such as continuous infall of galaxy groups or an off-axis merger.\n", "  TRAPPIST-1 is a nearby 0.08 M M-star, which was recently found to harbor a\nplanetary system of at least seven Earth-mass planets, all within 0.1 au. The\nconfiguration confounds theorists as the planets are not easily explained by\neither in situ or migration models. In this Paper we present a scenario for the\nformation and orbital architecture of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In our model,\nplanet formation starts at the H2O iceline, where pebble-size particles --\nwhose origin is the outer disk -- concentrate to trigger streaming\ninstabilities. After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by\npebble accretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet's\ngravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets are\ntransported by Type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall at the\nmagnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. During disk\ndispersal, the cavity radius expands and the inner-most planets escape\nresonance. We argue that the model outlined here can also be applied to other\ncompact systems and that the many close-in super-Earth systems are a scaled-up\nversion of TRAPPIST-1. We also hypothesize that few close-in compact systems\nharbor giant planets at large distances, since they would have stopped the\npebble flux from the outer disk.\n", "  High resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image analysis of the\nMOA-2008-BLG-310 microlens system indicates that the excess flux at the\nlocation of the source found in the discovery paper cannot primarily be due to\nthe lens star because it does not match the lens-source relative proper motion,\n$\\mu_{\\rm rel}$, predicted by the microlens models. This excess flux is most\nlikely to be due to an unrelated star that happens to be located in close\nproximity to the source star. Two epochs of HST observations indicate proper\nmotion for this blend star that is typical of a random bulge star, but is not\nconsistent with a companion to the source or lens stars if the flux is\ndominated by only one star, aside from the lens. We consider models in which\nthe excess flux is due to a combination of an unrelated star and the lens star,\nand this yields 95\\% confidence level upper limit on the lens star brightness\nof $I_L > 22.44$ and $V_L >23.62$. A Bayesian analysis using a standard\nGalactic model and these magnitude limits yields a host star mass $M_h = 0.21\n^{+0.21}_{-0.09}~ M_\\odot$, a planet mass of $m_p = 23.4\n^{+23.9}_{-9.9}~M_\\oplus$ at a projected separation of $a_\\perp =\n1.12^{+0.16}_{-0.17},$AU. This result illustrates excess flux in a high\nresolution image of a microlens-source system need not be due to the lens. It\nis important to check that the lens-source relative proper motion is consistent\nwith the microlensing prediction. The high resolution image analysis techniques\ndeveloped in this paper can be used to verify the WFIRST exoplanet microlensing\nsurvey mass measurements.\n", "  Most of ultraluminous X-ray sources are thought to be objects accreting above\ntheir Eddington limits. In the recently identified class of ultraluminous X-ray\npulsars, accretor is a neutron star and thus has a fairly small mass with a\nsmall Eddington limit. The accretion disc structure around such an object\naffects important observables such as equilibrium period, period derivative and\nthe size of the magnetosphere. We propose a model of a nearly-standard\naccretion disc interacting with the magnetosphere only in a thin layer near the\ninner disc rim. Our calculations show that the size of the magnetosphere may be\nrepresented as the classical Alfv\\'en radius times a dimensionless factor $\\xi$\nwhich depends on the disc thickness only. In the case of\nradiation-pressure-dominated disc, the size of the magnetosphere does not\ndepend on the mass accretion rate. In general, increasing the disc thickness\nleads to a larger magnetosphere size in units of the Alfv\\'en radius. For large\nenough mass accretion rates and magnetic moments, it is important to take into\naccount not only the pressure of the magnetic field and the radiation pressure\ninside the disc, but also the pressure of the radiation produced close to the\nsurface of the neutron star in accretion column. The magnetospheric size may\nincrease by up to factor of two as a result of the effects related to the disc\nthickness and the irradiation from the central source. Accounting for these\neffects reduces the estimate of the neutron star magnetic moment by a factor of\nseveral.\n", "  Stellar nucleosynthesis proceeds via the deuteron (D), but only a small\nchange in the fundamental constants of nature is required to unbind it. Here,\nwe investigate the effect of altering the binding energy of the deuteron on\nproton burning in stars. We find that the most definitive boundary in parameter\nspace that divides probably life-permitting universes from probably\nlife-prohibiting ones is between a bound and unbound deuteron. Due to neutrino\nlosses, a ball of gas will undergo rapid cooling or stabilization by electron\ndegeneracy pressure before it can form a stable, nuclear reaction-sustaining\nstar. We also consider a less-bound deuteron, which changes the energetics of\nthe $pp$ and $pep$ reactions. The transition to endothermic $pp$ and $pep$\nreactions, and the resulting beta-decay instability of the deuteron, do not\nseem to present catastrophic problems for life.\n", "  We investigate the nature of dissipative instability appearing in a\nprominence planar thread filled with partially ionised plasma in the\nincompressible limit. The importance of partial ionisation is investigated in\nterms of the ionisation factor and wavelength of waves propagating in the slab.\nTo highlight the role of partial ionisation, we have constructed models\ndescribing various situations we can meet in solar prominence fine structure.\nMatching the solutions for the transversal component of the velocity and total\npressure at the interfaces between the prominence slab and surrounding plasmas,\nwe derived a dispersion relation whose imaginary part describes the evolution\nof the instability. Results are obtained in the limit of weak dissipation. We\nhave investigated the appearance of instabilities in prominence dark plumes\nusing single and two-fluid approximations. We show that dissipative\ninstabilities appear for flow speeds that are less than the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability threshold. The onset of instability is determined by the\nequilibrium flow strength, the ionisation factor of the plasma, the wavelength\nof waves and the ion-neutral collisional rate. For a given wavelength and for\nionisation degrees closer to a neutral gas, the propagating waves become\nunstable for a narrow band of flow speeds, meaning that neutrals have a\nstabilising effect. Our results show that the partially ionised plasma\ndescribing prominence dark plumes becomes unstable only in a two-fluid (charged\nparticles-neutrals) model, that is for periods that are smaller than the\nion-neutral collision time. The present study improves our understanding of\nstability of solar prominences and the role of partial ionisation in\ndestabilising the plasma. We show the necessity of two-fluid approximation when\ndiscussing the nature of instabilities: waves in a single fluid approximation\nshow a great deal of stability.\n", "  In this article, we explore the anisotropic electron energy loss spectrum\n(EELS) in monolayer phosphorene based on ab-initio time dependent density\nfunctional theory calculations. Similar to black phosphorous, the EELS of\nundoped monolayer phosphorene is characterized by anisotropic excitonic peaks\nfor energies in vicinity of the bandgap, and by interband plasmon peaks for\nhigher energies. On doping, an additional intraband plasmon peak also appears\nfor energies within the bandgap. Similar to other two dimensional systems, the\nintraband plasmon peak disperses as $\\omega_{\\rm pl} \\propto \\sqrt{q}$ in both\nthe zigzag and armchair directions in the long wavelength limit, and deviates\nfor larger wavevectors. The anisotropy of the long wavelength plasmon intraband\ndispersion is found to be inversely proportional to the square root of the\nratio of the effective masses: $\\omega_{\\rm pl}(q \\hat{y})/\\omega_{\\rm pl}(q\n\\hat{x}) = \\sqrt{m_x/m_y}$.\n", "  We consider a two-leg boson ladder in an artificial U(1) gauge field and show\nthat, in the presence of interleg attractive interaction, the flux induced\nVortex state can be melted by dislocations. For increasing flux, instead of the\nMeissner to Vortex transition in the commensurate-incommensurate universality\nclass, first an Ising transition from the Meissner state to a charge density\nwave takes place, then, at higher flux, the melted Vortex phase is established\nvia a disorder point where incommensuration develops in the rung current\ncorrelation function and in momentum distribution.Finally, the quasi-long range\nordered Vortex phase is recovered for sufficiently small interaction. Our\npredictions for the observables, such as the spin current and the static\nstructure factor, could be tested in current experiments with cold atoms in\nbosonic ladders.\n", "  Cosmic rays interacting in the solar atmosphere produce showers that result\nin a flux of high-energy neutrinos from the Sun. These form an irreducible\nbackground to indirect solar WIMP co-annihilation searches, which look for\nheavy dark matter particles annihilating into final states containing neutrinos\nin the Solar core. This background will eventually create a sensitivity floor\nfor indirect WIMP co-annihilation searches analogous to that imposed by\nlow-energy solar neutrino interactions for direct dark matter detection\nexperiments. We present a new calculation of the flux of solar atmospheric\nneutrinos with a detailed treatment of systematic uncertainties inherent in\nsolar atmospheric shower evolution, and we use this to derive the sensitivity\nfloor for indirect solar WIMP annihilation analyses. We find that the floor\nlies less than one order of magnitude beyond the present experimental limits on\nspin-dependent WIMP-proton cross sections for some mass points, and that the\nhigh-energy solar atmospheric neutrino flux may be observable with running and\nfuture neutrino telescopes.\n", "  [Abridged] We present observations of PS16dtm, a luminous transient that\noccurred at the nucleus of a known Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy hosting a\n10$^6$ M$_\\odot$ black hole. The transient was previously claimed to be a Type\nIIn SLSN due to its luminosity and hydrogen emission lines. The light curve\nshows that PS16dtm brightened by about two magnitudes in ~50 days relative to\nthe archival host brightness and then exhibited a plateau phase for about 100\ndays followed by the onset of fading in the UV. During the plateau PS16dtm\nshowed no color evolution, maintained a blackbody temperature of 1.7 x 10$^4$\nK, and radiated at approximately $L_{Edd}$ of the SMBH. The spectra exhibit\nmulti-component hydrogen emission lines and strong FeII emission, show little\nevolution with time, and closely resemble the spectra of NLS1s while being\ndistinct from those of Type IIn SNe. Moreover, PS16dtm is undetected in the\nX-rays to a limit an order of magnitude below an archival X-ray detection of\nits host galaxy. These observations strongly link PS16dtm to activity\nassociated with the SMBH and are difficult to reconcile with a SN origin or any\nknown form of AGN variability, and therefore we argue that it is a TDE in which\nthe accretion of the stellar debris powers the rise in the continuum and\nexcitation of the pre-existing broad line region, while providing material that\nobscures the X-ray emitting region of the pre-existing AGN accretion disk. A\ndetailed TDE model fit to the light curve indicates that PS16dtm will remain\nbright for several years; we further predict that the X-ray emission will\nreappear on a similar timescale as the accretion rate declines. Finally, we\nplace PS16dtm in the context of other TDEs and find that TDEs in AGN galaxies\nare an order of magnitude more efficient and reach Eddington luminosities,\nlikely due to interaction of the stellar debris with the pre-existing accretion\ndisk.\n", "  We consider gravitational waves from the point of view of both their\nproduction and their propagation in doubly coupled bigravity in the metric\nformalism. In bigravity, the two gravitons are coupled by a non-diagonal mass\nmatrix and show birefrigence. In particular, we find that one of the two\ngravitons propagates with a speed which differs from one. This deviation is\ntightly constrained by both the gravitational Cerenkov effect and the energy\nloss of binary pulsars. When emitted from astrophysical sources, the Jordan\nframe gravitational wave, which is a linear combination of the two propagating\ngravitons, has a wave form displaying beats. The best prospect of detecting\nthis phenomenon would come from nano-Hertz interferometric experiments.\n", "  A near pristine atomic cooling halo close to a star forming galaxy offers a\nnatural pathway for forming massive direct collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds\nwhich could be the progenitors of the $z>6$ redshift quasars. The close\nproximity of the haloes enables a sufficient Lyman-Werner flux to effectively\ndissociate H$_2$ in the core of the atomic cooling halo. A mild background may\nalso be required to delay star formation in the atomic cooling halo, often\nattributed to distant background galaxies. In this letter we investigate the\nimpact of metal enrichment from both the background galaxies and the close star\nforming galaxy under extremely unfavourable conditions such as instantaneous\nmetal mixing. We find that within the time window of DCBH formation, the level\nof enrichment never exceeds the critical threshold (Z$_{cr} \\sim 1 \\times\n10^{-5} \\ \\rm Z_{\\odot})$, and attains a maximum metallicity of Z $\\sim 2\n\\times 10^{-6} \\ \\rm Z_{\\odot}$. As the system evolves, the metallicity\neventually exceeds the critical threshold, long after the DCBH has formed.\n", "  We propose an innovative method for measuring the neutral hydrogen (HI)\ncontent of an optically-selected spectroscopic sample of galaxies through\ncross-correlation with HI intensity mapping measurements. We show that the\nHI-galaxy cross-power spectrum contains an additive shot noise term which\nscales with the average HI brightness temperature of the optically-selected\ngalaxies, allowing constraints to be placed on the average HI mass per galaxy.\nThis approach can estimate the HI content of populations too faint to directly\nobserve through their 21cm emission over a wide range of redshifts. This\ncross-correlation, as a function of optical luminosity or colour, can be used\nto derive HI-scaling relations. We demonstrate that this signal will be\ndetectable by cross-correlating upcoming Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)\nobservations with existing optically-selected samples. We also use\nsemi-analytic simulations to verify that the HI mass can be successfully\nrecovered by our technique in the range M_HI > 10^8 M_solar, in a manner\nindependent of the underlying power spectrum shape. We conclude that this\nmethod is a powerful tool to study galaxy evolution, which only requires a\nsingle intensity mapping dataset to infer complementary HI gas information from\nexisting optical and infra-red observations.\n", "  We study the properties of dark matter halos that contain star-forming\ngalaxies at $1.43 \\le z \\le 1.74$ using the FMOS-COSMOS survey. The sample\nconsists of 516 objects with a detection of the H$\\alpha$ emission line, that\nrepresent the star-forming population at this epoch having a stellar mass range\nof $10^{9.57}\\le M_\\ast/M_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{11.4}$ and a star formation rate\nrange of $15\\lesssim \\mathrm{SFR}/(M_\\odot \\mathrm{yr^{-1}}) \\lesssim 600$. We\nmeasure the projected two-point correlation function while carefully taking\ninto account observational biases, and find a significant clustering amplitude\nat scales of $0.04$-$10~h^{-1}~\\mathrm{cMpc}$, with a correlation length $r_0 =\n5.21^{+0.70}_{-0.67}~h^{-1}~\\mathrm{cMpc}$ and a bias $b=2.59^{+0.41}_{-0.34}$.\nWe interpret our clustering measurement using a halo occupation distribution\nmodel. The sample galaxies appear to reside in halos with mass $M_\\mathrm{h} =\n4.6^{+1.1}_{-1.6}\\times10^{12}~h^{-1}M_\\odot$ on average that will likely\nbecome present-day halos of mass $M_\\mathrm{h} (z=0)\n\\sim2\\times10^{13}~h^{-1}M_\\odot$, equivalent to the typical halo mass scale of\ngalaxy groups. We then confirm the decline of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio at\n$M_\\mathrm{h}<10^{12}~M_\\odot$, finding $M_\\ast/M_\\mathrm{h} \\approx\n5\\times10^{-3}$ at $M_\\mathrm{h}=10^{11.86}~M_\\odot$, which is lower by a\nfactor of 2-4 than those measured at higher masses. Finally, we use our results\nto illustrate the future capabilities of Subaru's Prime-Focus Spectrograph, a\nnext-generation instrument that will provide strong constraints on the\ngalaxy-formation scenario by obtaining precise measurements of galaxy\nclustering at $z>1$.\n", "  We study the effect of density fluctuations induced by turbulence on the\nHI/H$_2$ structure in photodissociation regions (PDRs) both analytically and\nnumerically. We perform magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations for both\nsubsonic and supersonic turbulent gas, and chemical HI/H$_2$ balance\ncalculations. We derive atomic-to-molecular density profiles and the HI column\ndensity probability density function (PDF) assuming chemical equilibrium. We\nfind that while the HI/H$_2$ density profiles are strongly perturbed in\nturbulent gas, the mean HI column density is well approximated by the\nuniform-density analytic formula of Sternberg et al. (2014). The PDF width\ndepends on (a) the radiation intensity to mean density ratio, (b) the sonic\nMach number and (c) the turbulence decorrelation scale, or driving scale. We\nderive an analytic model for the HI PDF and demonstrate how our model, combined\nwith 21 cm observations, can be used to constrain the Mach number and driving\nscale of turbulent gas. As an example, we apply our model to observations of HI\nin the Perseus molecular cloud. We show that a narrow observed HI PDF may imply\nsmall scale decorrelation, pointing to the potential importance of\nsubcloud-scale turbulence driving.\n", "  We study the formation of runaway stars due to binary-binary (2+2)\ninteractions in young star-forming clusters and/or associations. This is done\nusing a combination of analytic methods and numerical simulations of 2+2\nscattering interactions, both in isolation and in a homogeneous background\npotential. We focus on interactions that produce two single stars and a binary,\nand study the outcomes as a function of the depth of the background potential,\nwithin a range typical of cluster cores. As reference parameters for the\nobservational properties, we use those observed for the system of runaway stars\nAE Aur and $\\mu$ Col and binary $\\iota$ Ori. We find that the outcome fractions\nhave no appreciable dependence on the depth of the potential, and neither do\nthe velocities of the ejected single stars. However, as the potential gets\ndeeper and a larger fraction of binaries remain trapped, two binary populations\nemerge, with the escaped component having higher speeds and shorter semi-major\naxes than the trapped one. Additionally, we find that the relative angles\nbetween the ejected products are generally large. In particular, the angle\nbetween the ejected fastest star and the escaped binary is typically $\\gtrsim\n120-135^{\\circ}$, with a peak at around $160^{\\circ}$. However, as the\npotential gets deeper, the angle distribution becomes broader. Finally, we\ndiscuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of the\nproperties of the runaway stars AE Aur and $\\mu$ Col.\n", "  It is well known that the black hole can has temperature and radiate the\nparticles with black body spectrum, i.e. Hawking radiation. Therefore, if the\nblack hole is surrounded by an isolated box, there is a thermal equilibrium\nbetween the black hole and radiation gas. A simple case considering the thermal\nequilibrium between the Schwarzschild black hole and radiation gas in an\nisolated box has been well investigated previously in detail, i.e. taking the\nconservation of energy and principle of maximal entropy for the isolated system\ninto account. In this paper, following the above spirit, the effects of massive\ngraviton on the thermal equilibrium will be investigated. For the gravity with\nmassive graviton, we will use the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive\ngravity which has been proven to be ghost free. Because the graviton mass\ndepends on two parameters in the dRGT massive gravity, here we just investigate\ntwo simple cases related to the two parameters, respectively. Our results show\nthat in the first case the massive graviton can suppress or increase the\ncondensation of black hole in the radiation gas although the $T-E$ diagram is\nsimilar like the Schwarzschild black hole case. For the second case, a new\n$T-E$ diagram has been obtained. Moreover, an interesting and important\nprediction is that the condensation of black hole just increases from the zero\nradius of horizon in this case, which is very different from the Schwarzschild\nblack hole case.\n", "  We revisit the physical properties of global and local monopoles and discuss\ntheir implications in the dynamics of monopole networks. In particular, we\nreview the Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model for global and local\nmonopoles and propose physically motivated changes to its equations. We suggest\na new form for the acceleration term of the evolution equation of the\nroot-mean-squared velocity and show that, with this change, the VOS model is\nable to describe the results of radiation and matter era numerical simulations\nof global monopole networks with a single value of the acceleration parameter\n$k$, thus resolving the tension previously found in the literature. We also\nshow that the fact that the energy of global monopoles is not localized within\ntheir cores affects their dynamics and, thus, the Hubble damping terms in the\nVOS equations. We study the ultra-relativistic linear scaling regime predicted\nby the VOS equations and demonstrate that it cannot be attained either on\nradiation or matter eras and, thus, cannot arise from the cosmological\nevolution of a global monopole network. We also briefly discuss the\nimplications of our findings for the VOS model for local monopoles.\n", "  I propose a scenario where the majority of the progenitors of type IIb\nsupernovae (SNe IIb) lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelope during a grazing\nenvelope evolution (GEE). In the GEE the orbital radius of the binary system is\nabout equal to the radius of the giant star, and the more compact companion\naccretes mass through an accretion disk. The accretion disk is assumed to\nlaunch two opposite jets that efficiently remove gas from the envelope along\nthe orbit of the companion. The efficient envelope removal by jets prevents the\nbinary system from entering a common envelope evolution, at least for part of\nthe time. The GEE might be continuous or intermittent. I crudely estimate the\ntotal GEE time period to be in the range of about hundreds of years, for a\ncontinuous GEE, and up to few tens of thousands of years for intermittent GEE.\nThe key new point is that the removal of envelope gas by jets during the GEE\nprevents the system from entering a common envelope evolution, and by that\nsubstantially increases the volume of the stellar binary parameter space that\nleads to SNe IIb, both to lower secondary masses and to closer orbital\nseparations.\n", "  A symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector-vector contact interaction is\nused to study charmed heavy-light mesons. The contact interaction is a\nrepresentation of nonperturbative kernels used in Dyson-Schwinger and\nBethe-Salpeter equations of QCD. The Dyson-Schwinger equation is solved for the\n$u,\\,d,\\,s$ and $c$ quark propagators and the bound-state Bethe-Salpeter\namplitudes respecting spacetime-translation invariance and the\nWard-Green-Takahashi identities associated with global symmetries of QCD are\nobtained to calculate masses and electroweak decay constants of the\npseudoscalar $\\pi,\\,K$, $D$ and $D_s$ and vector $\\rho$, $K^*$, $D^*$, and\n$D^*_s$ mesons. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with\navailable experimental and lattice QCD data.\n", "  Recent discoveries have spurred the theoretical prediction and experimental\nrealization of novel materials that have topological properties arising from\nband inversion. Such topological insulators are insulating in the bulk but have\nconductive surface or edge states. Topological materials show various unusual\nphysical properties and are surmised to enable the creation of exotic\nMajorana-fermion quasiparticles. How the signatures of topological behavior\nevolve when the system size is reduced is interesting from both a fundamental\nand an application-oriented point of view, as such understanding may form the\nbasis for tailoring systems to be in specific topological phases. This work\nconsiders the specific case of quantum-well confinement defining\ntwo-dimensional layers. Based on the effective-Hamiltonian description of bulk\ntopological insulators, and using a harmonic-oscillator potential as an example\nfor a softer-than-hard-wall confinement, we have studied the interplay of band\ninversion and size quantization. Our model system provides a useful platform\nfor systematic study of the transition between the normal and topological\nphases, including the development of band inversion and the formation of\nmassless-Dirac-fermion surface states. The effects of bare size quantization,\ntwo-dimensional-subband mixing, and electron-hole asymmetry are disentangled\nand their respective physical consequences elucidated.\n", "  The direct detection of gravitational waves opens new perspectives for\nmeasuring properties of gravitationally bound compact objects. It is then\nimportant to investigate black holes and neutron stars in alternative theories\nof gravity, since they can have features that make them observationally\ndistinguishable from their General Relativity (GR) counterparts. In this work,\nwe examine a special case of vector Galileons, a vector-tensor theory of\ngravity with interesting cosmological properties, which consists of a one\nparameter modification of the Einstein-Maxwell action. Within this theory, we\nstudy configurations describing asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric\nblack holes and neutron stars. The set of black hole solutions in this theory\nis surprisingly rich, generalising results found in GR or in related\nscalar-tensor theories. We investigate the properties and conserved charges of\nblack holes, using both analytical and numerical techniques, highlighting\nconfigurations that are more compact than in GR. We then study properties of\nneutron stars, showing how the vector profile can influence the star internal\nstructure. Depending on properties of matter and fields inside the star,\nneutron stars can be more massive than in GR, and they can be even more compact\nthan Schwarzschild black holes, making these objects observationally\ninteresting. We also comment on possible extensions of our configurations to\nmagnetically charged or rotating configurations.\n", "  We present a deep radio search in the Reticulum II dwarf spheroidal (dSph)\ngalaxy performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Observations were\nconducted at 16 cm wavelength, with an rms sensitivity of 0.01 mJy/beam, and\nwith the goal of searching for synchrotron emission induced by annihilation or\ndecay of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Data were complemented\nwith observations on large angular scales taken with the KAT-7 telescope. We\nfind no evidence for a diffuse emission from the dSph and we derive competitive\nbounds on the WIMP properties. In addition, we detect more than 200 new\nbackground radio sources. Among them, we show there are two compelling\ncandidates for being the radio counterpart of the possible gamma-ray emission\nreported by other groups using Fermi-LAT data.\n", "  Recent experiments on Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires [Albrecht\net al., Nat. 531, 206 (2016)] revealed a surprisingly large electronic Land\\'e\ng-factor, several times larger than the bulk value - contrary to the\nexpectation that confinement reduces the g-factor. Here we assess the role of\norbital contributions to the electron g-factor in nanowires and quantum dots.\nWe show that an LS coupling in higher subbands leads to an enhancement of the\ng-factor of an order of magnitude or more for small effective mass\nsemiconductors. We validate our theoretical finding with simulations of InAs\nand InSb, showing that the effect persists even if cylindrical symmetry is\nbroken. A huge anisotropy of the enhanced g-factors under magnetic field\nrotation allows for a straightforward experimental test of this theory.\n", "  We present theoretical and experimental evidence of a universal mechanism\nthrough which temporal cavity solitons of externally-driven, passive, Kerr\nresonators can form robust long-range bound states. These bound states,\nsometime also referred to as multi-soliton states or soliton crystals in\nmicroresonators, require perturbations to the strict Lugiato-Lefever mean field\ndescription of temporal cavity solitons. Binding occurs when the perturbation\nexcites a narrowband resonance in the soliton spectrum, which gives long\noscillatory tails to the solitons. Those tails can then interlock for a\ndiscrete set of temporal separations between the solitons. The universality of\nthis mechanism is demonstrated in fiber ring cavities by providing experimental\nobservations of long-range bound states ensuing from three different\nperturbations: third-order dispersion (dispersive wave generation), the\nperiodic nature of the cavity (Kelly sidebands), and the random birefringence\nof the resonator. Sub-picosecond resolution of bound state separations and\ntheir dynamics are obtained by using the dispersive Fourier transform\ntechnique. Good agreement with theoretical models, including a new vector\nmean-field model, is also reported.\n", "  Reaction cross sections of carbon isotopes for proton scattering are\ncalculated in large energy region. Density distributions of carbon isotopes are\nobtained from relativistic mean field results. Calculations are based on two\nprocedures: the Glauber theory and relativistic impulse approximation, and\nresults are compared with each other as well as with experimental data. A\nstrong relationship between reaction cross section and root-mean-square radius\nis clearly shown for 12C using a model distribution.\n", "  A very specific ensemble of ground and excited states is shown to yield an\nexact formula for any excitation energy as a simple correction to the energy\ndifference between orbitals of the Kohn-Sham ground state. This alternative\nscheme avoids either the need to calculate many unoccupied levels as in\ntime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) or the need for many\nself-consistent ensemble calculations. The symmetry-eigenstate Hartree-exchange\n(SEHX) approximation yields results comparable to standard TDDFT for atoms.\nWith this formalism, SEHX yields approximate double-excitations, which are\nmissed by adiabatic TDDFT.\n", "  Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy investigations reveal a\nsignificant increase of the magnetic period of spin spirals in\nthree-atomic-layer-thick Fe films on Ir(111), from about 4nm at 8K to about\n65nm at room temperature. We attribute this considerable influence of\ntemperature on the magnetic length scale of noncollinear spin states to\ndifferent exchange interaction coefficients in the different Fe layers. We thus\npropose a classical spin model which reproduces the experimental observations\nand in which the crucial feature is the presence of magnetically coupled atomic\nlayers with different interaction strengths. This model might also apply for\nmany other systems, especially magnetic multilayers.\n", "  We introduce a new class of isolated magnetic skyrmions emerging within\ntilted ferromagnetic phases of polar magnets with easy-plane anisotropy. The\nasymmetric magnetic structure of these skyrmions is associated with an\nintricate pattern of the energy density, which exhibits positive and negative\nasymptotics with respect to the surrounding state with a ferromagnetic moment\ntilted away from the polar axis. Correspondingly, the skyrmion-skyrmion\ninteraction has an anisotropic character and can be either attractive or\nrepulsive depending on the relative orientation of the skyrmion pair. We\ninvestigate the stability of these novel asymmetric skyrmions against the\nelliptical cone state and follow their transformation into axisymmetric\nskyrmions, when the tilted ferromagnetic moment of the host phase is reduced.\nOur theory gives clear directions for experimental studies of isolated\nasymmetric skyrmions and their clusters embedded in tilted ferromagnetic\nphases.\n", "  Elucidating the details of the electron-phonon coupling in semiconductors and\ninsulators is a topic of pivotal interest, as it governs the transport\nmechanisms and is responsible for various phenomena such as spectral-weight\ntransfers to phonon sidebands and self-trapping. Here, we investigate the\ninfluence of the electron-phonon interaction on the excitonic peaks of rutile\nTiO$_2$, revealing a strong anisotropic polarization dependence with increasing\ntemperature, namely an anomalous blueshift for light polarized along the a-axis\nand a conventional redshift for light polarized along the c-axis. By employing\nmany-body perturbation theory, we identify two terms in the electron-phonon\ninteraction Hamiltonian that contribute to the anomalous blueshift of the\na-axis exciton. Our approach paves the way to a complete ab initio treatment of\nthe electron-phonon interaction and of its influence on the optical spectra of\npolar materials.\n", "  Ultra-short-period (USP) planets are a newly recognized class of planets with\nperiods shorter than one day and radii smaller than about 2 Earth radii. It has\nbeen proposed that USP planets are the solid cores of hot Jupiters that lost\ntheir gaseous envelopes due to photo-evaporation or Roche lobe overflow. We\ntest this hypothesis by asking whether USP planets are associated with\nmetal-rich stars, as has long been observed for hot Jupiters. We find the\nmetallicity distributions of USP-planet and hot-Jupiter hosts to be\nsignificantly different ($p = 3\\times 10^{-4}$), based on Keck spectroscopy of\nKepler stars. Evidently, the sample of USP planets is not dominated by the\nevaporated cores of hot Jupiters. The metallicity distribution of stars with\nUSP planets is indistinguishable from that of stars with short-period planets\nwith sizes between 2--4~$R_\\oplus$. Thus it remains possible that the USP\nplanets are the solid cores of formerly gaseous planets smaller than Neptune.\n", "  An algebraic-hyperbolic method for solving the Hamiltonian and momentum\nconstraints has recently been shown to be well posed for general nonlinear\nperturbations of the initial data for a Schwarzschild black hole. This is a new\napproach to solving the constraints of Einstein's equations which does not\ninvolve elliptic equations and has potential importance for the construction of\nbinary black hole data. In order to shed light on the underpinnings of this\napproach, we consider its application to obtain solutions of the constraints\nfor linearized perturbations of Minkowski space. In that case, we find the\nsurprising result that there are no suitable Cauchy hypersurfaces in Minkowski\nspace for which the linearized algebraic-hyperbolic constraint problem is well\nposed.\n", "  This paper presents the first derivation of the quadratic action for\ncurvature perturbations, $\\zeta$, within the framework of cuscuton gravity. We\nstudy the scalar cosmological perturbations sourced by a canonical single\nscalar field in the presence of cuscuton field. We identify $\\zeta$ as comoving\ncurvature with respect to the source field and we show that it retains its\nconservation characteristic on super horizon scales. The result provides an\nexplicit proof that cuscuton modification of gravity around\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is ghost free. We also\ninvestigate the potential development of other instabilities in cuscuton\nmodels. We find that in a large class of these models, there is no generic\ninstability problem. However, depending on the details of slow-roll parameters,\nspecific models may display gradient instabilities.\n", "  Chaotic size dependence makes it extremely difficult to take the\nthermodynamic limit in disordered systems. Instead, the metastate, which is a\ndistribution over thermodynamic states, might have a smooth limit. So far,\nstudies of the metastate have been mostly mathematical. We present a numerical\nconstruction of the metastate for the d=3 Ising spin glass. We work in\nequilibrium, below the critical temperature. Leveraging recent rigorous\nresults, our numerical analysis gives evidence for a \"dispersed\" metastate,\nsupported on many thermodynamic states.\n", "  We consider two different types of conditions which were proposed to test\nmacrorealism in the context of a system described by a single dichotomic\nvariable Q. This is the view that a macroscopic system evolving in time\npossesses definite properties which can be determined without disturbing the\nfuture or past state. The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities, the most\ncommonly-studied test, are only necessary conditions for macrorealism, but\nbuilding on earlier work it is shown that when the four three-time LG\ninequalities are augmented with a certain set of two-time inequalities also of\nthe LG form, Fine's theorem applies and these augmented conditions are then\nboth necessary and sufficient. A comparison is carried out with a very\ndifferent set of necessary and sufficient conditions for macrorealism, namely\nthe no-signaling in time (NSIT) conditions proposed by Brukner, Clemente,\nKofler and others, which ensure that all probabilities for Q at one and two\ntimes are independent of whether earlier or intermediate measurements are made\nin a given run, and do not require (but imply) the LG inequalities. We argue\nthat tests based on the LG inequalities have the form of very weak classicality\nconditions and can be satisfied in the face of moderate interference effects,\nbut those based on NSIT conditions have the form of much stronger coherence\nwitness conditions, satisfied only for zero interference. The two tests differ\nin their implementation of non-invasive measurability so are testing different\nnotions of macrorealism: the augmented LG tests are indirect, entailing a\ncombination of the results of different experiments with only compatible\nquantities measured in each experimental run, in close analogy with Bell tests,\nand are primarily tests for macrorealism per se; by contrast the NSIT tests\nentail sequential measurements of incompatible quantities and are primarily\ntests for non-invasiveness\n", "  Due to recent advances in laboratory spectroscopy, the first optical\ndetection of a very large molecule has been claimed in the diffuse interstellar\nmedium (ISM): C60+ (ionized Buckminsterfullerene). Confirming the presence of\nthis molecule would have significant implications regarding the carbon budget\nand chemical complexity of the ISM. Here we present results from a new method\nfor ultra-high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectroscopy of background stars in the\nnear infrared (at wavelengths 0.9-1 micron), using the Hubble Space Telescope\nImaging Spectrograph (STIS) in a previously untested `STIS scan' mode. The use\nof HST provides the crucial benefit of eliminating the need for error-prone\ntelluric correction methods in the part of the spectrum where the C60+ bands\nlie, and terrestrial water vapor contamination is severe. Our STIS spectrum of\nthe heavily-reddened B0 star BD63\\,1964 reaches an unprecedented S/N for this\ninstrument ($\\sim600-800$), allowing the detection of the diffuse interstellar\nband (DIB) at 9577 \\AA\\ attributed to C60+ as well as new DIBs in the near-IR.\nUnfortunately, the presence of overlapping stellar lines, and the unexpected\nweakness of the C60+ bands in this sightline, prevents conclusive detection of\nthe weaker C60+ bands. A probable correlation between the 9577 \\AA\\ DIB\nstrength and interstellar radiation field is identified, which suggests that\nmore strongly-irradiated interstellar sightlines will provide the optimal\ntargets for future C60+ searches.\n", "  Numerical simulation of continuous-time Markovian processes is an essential\nand widely applied tool in the investigation of epidemic spreading on complex\nnetworks. Due to the high heterogeneity of the connectivity structure through\nwhich epidemics is transmitted, efficient and accurate implementations of\ngeneric epidemic processes are not trivial and deviations from statistically\nexact prescriptions can lead to uncontrolled biases. Based on the Gillespie\nalgorithm (GA), in which only steps that change the state are considered, we\ndevelop numerical recipes and describe their computer implementations for\nstatistically exact and computationally efficient simulations of generic\nMarkovian epidemic processes aiming at highly heterogeneous and large networks.\nThe central point of the recipes investigated here is to include phantom\nprocesses, that do not change the states but do count for time increments. We\ncompare the efficiencies for the susceptible-infected-susceptible, contact\nprocess and susceptible-infected-recovered models, that are particular cases of\na generic model considered here. We numerically confirm that the simulation\noutcomes of the optimized algorithms are statistically indistinguishable from\nthe original GA and can be several orders of magnitude more efficient.\n", "  The influence of possible magnetic inertia effects has recently drawn\nattention in ultrafast magnetization dynamics and switching. Here we derive\nrigorously a description of inertia in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation on\nthe basis of the Dirac-Kohn-Sham framework. Using the Foldy-Wouthuysen\ntransformation up to the order of $1/c^4$ gives the intrinsic inertia of a pure\nsystem through the 2$^{\\rm nd}$ order time-derivative of magnetization in the\ndynamical equation of motion. Thus, the inertial damping $\\mathcal{I}$ is a\nhigher order spin-orbit coupling effect, $\\sim 1/c^4$, as compared to the\nGilbert damping $\\Gamma$ that is of order $1/c^2$. Inertia is therefore\nexpected to play a role only on ultrashort timescales (sub-picoseconds). We\nalso show that the Gilbert damping and inertial damping are related to one\nanother through the imaginary and real parts of the magnetic susceptibility\ntensor respectively.\n", "  We use idealized three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of global\ngalactic discs to study the launching of galactic winds by supernovae (SNe).\nThe simulations resolve the cooling radii of the majority of supernova remnants\n(SNRs) and thus self-consistently capture how SNe drive galactic winds. We find\nthat SNe launch highly supersonic winds with properties that agree reasonably\nwell with expectations from analytic models. The energy loading ($\\eta_E =\n\\dot{E}_{\\rm wind} / \\dot{E}_{\\rm SN}$) of the winds in our simulations are\nwell converged with spatial resolution while the wind mass loading ($\\eta_M =\n\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind} / \\dot{M}_\\star$) decreases with resolution at the\nresolutions we achieve. We present a simple analytic model based on the concept\nthat SNRs with cooling radii greater than the local scale height breakout of\nthe disc and power the wind. This model successfully explains the dependence\n(or lack thereof) of $\\eta_E$ (and by extension $\\eta_M$) on the gas surface\ndensity, star formation efficiency, disc radius, and the clustering of SNe. The\nwinds in the majority of our simulations are weaker than expected in reality,\nlikely due to the fact that we seed SNe preferentially at density peaks.\nClustering SNe in time and space substantially increases the wind power.\n", "  The high-mass star forming sites SgrB2(M) and SgrB2(N) have been the target\nof numerous studies, revealing e.g. a rich chemistry. We want to characterize\ntheir physical and chemical structure using ALMA high-angular resolution\nobservations at mm wavelengths, reaching spatial scales of about 4000 au, and\ncovering the whole band 6 (from 211 to 275 GHz). In order to determine the\ncontinuum emission in line-rich sources, we use a new statistical method:\nSTATCONT. We detect 27 continuum sources in SgrB2(M) and 20 in SgrB2(N). We\nstudy the continuum emission across the ALMA band 6, and compare it with\nprevious SMA 345 GHz and VLA 40 GHz observations, to study the nature of the\nsources detected. The brightest sources are dominated by (partially optically\nthick) dust emission, while there is an important degree of contamination from\nionized gas free-free emission in weaker sources. While the total mass in\nSgrB2(M) is distributed in many fragments, most of the mass in SgrB2(N) arises\nfrom a single object, with filamentary-like structures converging towards the\ncenter. There seems to be a lack of low-mass dense cores in both regions. We\ndetermine H2 volume densities for the cores of about 10^5-10^7 Msun pc^-3, one\nto two orders of magnitude higher than the stellar densities of super star\nclusters. In general, SgrB2(N) is chemically richer than SgrB2(M). There seems\nto be a correlation between the chemical richness and the mass of the\nfragments, with more massive clumps being more chemically rich. Both SgrB2(N)\nand SgrB2(M) harbour a cluster of hot molecular cores. We compare the continuum\nimages with predictions from a detailed 3D radiative transfer model that\nreproduces the structure of SgrB2 from 45 pc down to 100 au. This dataset,\ntogether with ongoing projects in the range 5 to 200 GHz, better constrain the\n3D structure of SgrB2, and allow us to understand its physical and chemical\nstructure.\n", "  Cross sections for inclusive neutrino scattering off deuteron induced by\nneutral and charge-changing weak currents are calculated from threshold up to\n150 MeV energies in a chiral effective field theory including high orders in\nthe power counting. Contributions beyond leading order (LO) in the weak current\nare found to be small, and increase the cross sections obtained with the LO\ntransition operators by a couple of percent over the whole energy range\n(0--150) MeV. The cutoff dependence is negligible, and the predicted cross\nsections are within $\\sim 2$\\% of, albeit consistently larger than,\ncorresponding predictions obtained in conventional meson-exchange frameworks.\n", "  We identified quasiparticle states at well-defined energies inside the\nsuperconducting gap of the electron system at the LaAlO$_3$-SrTiO$_3$ interface\nusing tunneling spectroscopy. The states are found only in a number of samples\nand depend upon the thermal-cycling history of the samples. The states consist\nof a peak at zero energy and other peaks at finite energies, symmetrically\nplaced around zero energy. These peaks disappear, together with the\nsuperconducting gap, with increasing temperature and magnetic field. We discuss\nthe likelihood of various physical mechanisms that are known to cause in-gap\nstates in superconductors and conclude that none of these mechanisms can easily\nexplain the results. The conceivable scenarios are the formation of Majorana\nbound states, Andreev bound states, or the presence of an odd-frequency spin\ntriplet component in the superconducting order parameter.\n", "  We investigate the use of 183 GHz H2O masers for characterization of the\nphysical conditions and mass loss process in the circumstellar envelopes of\nevolved stars. We used APEX SEPIA Band 5 to observe the 183 GHz H2O line\ntowards 2 Red Supergiant and 3 Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. Simultaneously,\nwe observed lines in 28SiO v0, 1, 2 and 3, and for 29SiO v0 and 1. We detected\nthe 183 GHz H2O line towards all the stars with peak flux densities greater\nthan 100 Jy, including a new detection from VY CMa. Towards all 5 targets, the\nwater line had indications of being due to maser emission and had higher peak\nflux densities than for the SiO lines. The SiO lines appear to originate from\nboth thermal and maser processes. Comparison with simulations and models\nindicate that 183 GHz maser emission is likely to extend to greater radii in\nthe circumstellar envelopes than SiO maser emission and to similar or greater\nradii than water masers at 22, 321 and 325 GHz. We speculate that a prominent\nblue-shifted feature in the W Hya 183 GHz spectrum is amplifying the stellar\ncontinuum, and is located at a similar distance from the star as mainline OH\nmaser emission. From a comparison of the individual polarizations, we find that\nthe SiO maser linear polarization fraction of several features exceeds the\nmaximum fraction allowed under standard maser assumptions and requires strong\nanisotropic pumping of the maser transition and strongly saturated maser\nemission. The low polarization fraction of the H2O maser however, fits with the\nexpectation for a non-saturated maser. 183 GHz H2O masers can provide strong\nprobes of the mass loss process of evolved stars. Higher angular resolution\nobservations of this line using ALMA Band 5 will enable detailed investigation\nof the emission location in circumstellar envelopes and can also provide\ninformation on magnetic field strength and structure.\n", "  We report the first molecular line survey of Supernova 1987A in the\nmillimetre wavelength range. In the ALMA 210--300 and 340--360 GHz spectra, we\ndetected cold (20--170 K) CO, 28SiO, HCO+ and SO, with weaker lines of 29SiO\nfrom ejecta. This is the first identification of HCO+ and SO in a young\nsupernova remnant. We find a dip in the J=6--5 and 5--4 SiO line profiles,\nsuggesting that the ejecta morphology is likely elongated. The difference of\nthe CO and SiO line profiles is consistent with hydrodynamic simulations, which\nshow that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities cause mixing of gas, with heavier\nelements much more disturbed, making more elongated structure. We obtained\nisotopologue ratios of 28SiO/29SiO>13, 28SiO/30SiO>14, and 12CO/13CO>21, with\nthe most likely limits of 28SiO/29SiO>128, 28SiO/30SiO>189. Low 29Si and 30Si\nabundances in SN 1987A are consistent with nucleosynthesis models that show\ninefficient formation of neutron-rich isotopes in a low metallicity\nenvironment, such as the Large Magellanic Cloud. The deduced large mass of HCO+\n(~5x10^-6 Msun) and small SiS mass (<6x10^-5 Msun) might be explained by some\nmixing of elements immediately after the explosion. The mixing might have\ncaused some hydrogen from the envelope to sink into carbon and oxygen-rich\nzones after the explosion, enabling the formation of a substantial mass of\nHCO+. Oxygen atoms may have penetrated into silicon and sulphur zones,\nsuppressing formation of SiS. Our ALMA observations open up a new window to\ninvestigate chemistry, dynamics and explosive-nucleosynthesis in supernovae.\n", "  Spin-polarized density functional calculations, magnetization, and neutron\ndiffraction measurements are carried out to investigate the magnetic exchange\ninteractions and strong correlation effects in Yb substituted inverse spinel\nnickel ferrite. In the pristine form, the compound is found to be a mixed\ninsulator under the Zaanen-Sawtazsky-Allen classification scheme as it features\nboth charge transfer and Mott insulator mechanism. Estimation of magnetic\nexchange couplings reveals that both octahedral-octahedral and\noctahedral-tetrahedral spin-spin interactions are antiferromagnetic which is\ntypical of a spin-frustrated triangular lattice. However, the latter is\ndominant compared to the former leading to a forced parallel alignment of the\nspins at the octahedral site which is in agreement with the results of neutron\ndiffraction measurements. The substituent Yb is found to be settled in +3\ncharge state, as confirmed from the XPS measurements, to behave like a\nspin-half impurity carried by the localized $f_{z(x^2-y^2)}$ orbital. The\nimpurity $f$ spin significantly weakens the antiferromagnetic coupling with the\nspins at the tetrahedral site, which explains the experimental observation of\nfall in Curie temperature with Yb substitution.\n", "  We introduce a practical and computationally not demanding technique for\ninferring interactions at various microscopic levels between the units of a\nnetwork from the measurements and the processing of macroscopic signals.\nStarting from a network model of Kuramoto phase oscillators which evolve\nadaptively according to homophilic and homeostatic adaptive principles, we give\nevidence that the increase of synchronization within groups of nodes (and the\ncorresponding formation of synchronous clusters) causes also the\ndefragmentation of the wavelet energy spectrum of the macroscopic signal. Our\nmethodology is then applied for getting a glance to the microscopic\ninteractions occurring in a neurophysiological system, namely, in the\nthalamo-cortical neural network of an epileptic brain of a rat, where the group\nelectrical activity is registered by means of multichannel EEG. We demonstrate\nthat it is possible to infer the degree of interaction between the\ninterconnected regions of the brain during different types of brain activities,\nand to estimate the regions' participation in the generation of the different\nlevels of consciousness.\n", "  The redshifted 21-cm monopole is expected to be a powerful probe of the epoch\nof the first stars and galaxies ($10<z<35$). The global 21-cm signal is\nsensitive to the thermal and ionization state of hydrogen gas and thus provides\na tracer of sources of energetic photons -- primarily hot stars and accreting\nblack holes -- which ionize and heat the high redshift intergalactic medium\n(IGM). This paper presents a strategy for observations of the global spectrum\nwith a realizable instrument placed in a low altitude lunar orbit, performing\nnight-time 40-120 MHz spectral observations, while on the farside to avoid\nterrestrial radio frequency interference, ionospheric corruption, and solar\nradio emissions. The frequency structure, uniformity over large scales, and\nunpolarized state of the redshifted 21-cm spectrum are distinct from the\nspectrally featureless, spatially-varying, and polarized emission from the\nbright foregrounds. This allows a clean separation between the primordial\nsignal and foregrounds. For signal extraction, we model the foreground,\ninstrument, and 21-cm spectrum with eigenmodes calculated via Singular Value\nDecomposition analyses. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to explore\nthe parameter space defined by the coefficients associated with these modes, we\nillustrate how the spectrum can be measured and how astrophysical parameters\n(e.g., IGM properties, first star characteristics) can be constrained in the\npresence of foregrounds using the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE).\n", "  We analytically study the non-linear stability of a spherically symmetric\nwormhole supported by an infinitesimally thin brane of negative tension, which\nhas been devised by Barcelo and Visser. We consider a situation in which a thin\nspherical shell composed of dust falls into an initially static wormhole; The\ndust shell plays a role of the non-linear disturbance. The self-gravity of the\nfalling dust shell is completely taken into account through Israel's formalism\nof the metric junction. When the dust shell goes through the wormhole, it\nnecessarily collides with the brane supporting the wormhole. We assume the\ninteraction between these shells is only gravity and show the condition under\nwhich the wormhole stably persists after the dust shell goes through it.\n", "  Unsupervised learning in a generalized Hopfield associative-memory network is\ninvestigated in this work. First, we prove that the (generalized) Hopfield\nmodel is equivalent to a semi-restricted Boltzmann machine with a layer of\nvisible neurons and another layer of hidden binary neurons, so it could serve\nas the building block for a multilayered deep-learning system. We then\ndemonstrate that the Hopfield network can learn to form a faithful internal\nrepresentation of the observed samples, with the learned memory patterns being\nprototypes of the input data. Furthermore, we propose a spectral method to\nextract a small set of concepts (idealized prototypes) as the most concise\nsummary or abstraction of the empirical data.\n", "  In this paper we study canonical scalar field models with a varying second\nslow-roll parameter, that allow transitions between constant-roll eras. In the\nmodels with two constant-roll eras it is possible to avoid fine-tunings in the\ninitial conditions of the scalar field. We mainly focus on the stability of the\nresulting solutions and we also investigate if these solutions are attractors\nof the cosmological system. We shall calculate the resulting scalar potential\nand by using a numerical approach, we examine the stability and attractor\nproperties of the solutions. As we show, the first constant-roll era is\ndynamically unstable towards linear perturbations and the cosmological system\nis driven by the attractor solution to the final constant-roll era. As we\ndemonstrate, it is possible to have a nearly-scale invariant power spectrum of\nprimordial curvature perturbations in some cases, however this is strongly\nmodel dependent and depends on the rate of the final constant-roll era.\nFinally, we present in brief the essential features of a model that allows\noscillations between constant-roll eras.\n", "  We show that four-dimensional black holes become stable below certain mass\nwhen the Einstein-Hilbert action is supplemented with higher-curvature terms.\nWe prove this to be the case for an infinite family of ghost-free theories\ninvolving terms of arbitrarily high order in curvature. The new black holes,\nwhich are non-hairy generalizations of Schwarzschild's solution, present a\nuniversal thermodynamic behavior for general values of the higher-order\ncouplings. In particular, small black holes have infinite lifetimes. When the\nevaporation process makes the semiclassical approximation break down (something\nthat occurs after a time which is usually infinite for all practical purposes),\nthe resulting object retains a huge entropy, in stark contrast with\nSchwarzschild's case.\n", "  Localized Structures often behave as quasi-particles and they may form\nmolecules characterized by well-defined bond distances. In this paper we show\nthat pointwise nonlocality may lead to a new kind of molecule where bonds are\nnot rigid. The elements of this molecule can shift mutually one with respect to\nthe others while remaining linked together, in a way similar to interlaced\nrings in a chain. We report experimental observations of these chains of nested\nlocalized structures in a time-delayed laser system.\n", "  The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) continues to\nsuccessfully work in orbit after its launch in 2002. The mission provides the\ndeepest ever survey of hard X-ray sources throughout the Galaxy at energies\nabove 20 keV. We report on a catalogue of new hard X-ray source candidates\nbased on the latest sky maps comprising 14 years of data acquired with the IBIS\ntelescope onboard INTEGRAL in the Galactic Plane (|b|<17.5 deg). The current\ncatalogue includes in total 72 hard X-ray sources detected at S/N>4.7 sigma and\nnot known to previous INTEGRAL surveys. Among them, 31 objects have also been\ndetected in the on-going all-sky survey by the BAT telescope of the Swift\nobservatory. For 26 sources on the list, we suggest possible identifications:\n21 active galactic nuclei, two cataclysmic variables, two isolated pulsars or\npulsar wind nebulae, and one supernova remnant; 46 sources from the catalogue\nremain unclassified.\n", "  From the point of view of elementary particle physics the gravitational\nconstant $G$ is extraordinarily small. This has led to ask whether it could\nhave decayed to its present value from an initial one commensurate with\nmicroscopical units. A mechanism that leads to such a decay is proposed herein.\nIt is based on assuming that $G$ may take different values within regions of\nthe universe separated by a novel kind of domain wall, a \"G-wall\". The idea is\nimplemented by introducing a gauge potential $A_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}$, and its\nconjugate $D$, which determines the value of $G$ as an integration constant\nrather than a fundamental constant. The value of $G$ jumps when one goes\nthrough a $G$-wall. The procedure extends one previously developed for the\ncosmological constant, but the generalization is far from straightforward: (i)\nThe intrinsic geometry of a $G$-wall is not the same as seen from its two\nsides, because the second law of black hole thermodynamics mandates that the\njump in $G$ must cause a discontinuity in the scale of length. (ii) The size of\nthe decay step in $G$ is controlled by a function $G(D)$ which may be chosen so\nas to diminish the value of $G$ towards the asymptote $G=0$, without fine\ntuning. It is shown that: (i) The dynamics of the gravitational field with $G$\ntreated as a dynamical variable, coupled to $G$-walls and matter, follows from\nan action principle, which is given. (ii) A particle that impinges on a\n$G$-wall may be refracted or reflected. (iii) The various forces between two\nparticles change when a $G$-wall is inserted in between them. (iv) $G$-walls\nmay be nucleated trough tunneling and thermal effects. The semiclassical\nprobabilities are evaluated. (v)~If the action principle is constructed\nproperly, the entropy of a black hole increases when the value of the\ngravitational constant is changed through the absorption of a G-wall by the\nhole.\n", "  We consider two semi-infinite quantum Ising chains initially at thermal\nequilibrium at two different temperatures and subsequently joined by an\ninteraction between their end points. Transport properties such as the heat\ncurrent are determined by the dynamics of the left- and right-moving fermionic\nquasi-particles which characterize the ensuing unitary dynamics. Within the\nso-called semi-classical space-time scaling limit we extend known results by\ndetermining the full space and time dependence of the density and current of\nenergy and of fermionic quasi-particles. Upon approaching the edge of the\npropagating front, these quantities as well as the two-point correlation\nfunction display qualitatively different behaviors depending on the transverse\nfield of the chain being critical or not. While in the latter case corrections\nto the leading behavior are described, as expected, by the Airy kernel, in the\nformer a novel scaling form emerges with universal features.\n", "  We predict the number of black holes with stellar companions that are\npotentially detectable with Gaia astrometry over the course of its five-year\nmission. Our model estimates that nearly 2$\\times$10$^5$ astrometric binaries\nhosting black holes and stellar companions brighter than Gaia's detection\nthreshold, G $\\sim$ 20, should be discovered with 5$\\sigma$ sensitivity. Among\nthese detectable binaries, systems with longer orbital periods are favored, and\nblack hole and stellar companion masses in the range M$_{BH} \\sim$ 6-10\nM$_\\odot$ and M$_* \\sim$ 1-2 M$_\\odot$, respectively, are expected to dominate.\n", "  Iron telluride FeTe is known to display bicollinear magnetic order at low\ntemperatures together with a monoclinic lattice distortion. Because the\nbicollinear order can involve two different wavevectors $(\\pi/2,\\pi/2)$ and\n$(\\pi/2,-\\pi/2)$, symmetry considerations allow for the possible stabilization\nof a nematic state with short-range bicollinear order coupled to monoclinic\nlattice distortions at a $T_S$ higher than the temperature $T_N$ where\nlong-range bicollinear order fully develops. As a concrete example, the\nthree-orbitals spin-fermion model for iron telluride is studied with an\nadditional coupling $\\tilde\\lambda_{12}$ between the monoclinic lattice strain\nand an orbital-nematic order parameter with $B_{2g}$ symmetry. Monte Carlo\nsimulations show that with increasing $\\tilde\\lambda_{12}$ the first-order\ntransition characteristic of FeTe splits and bicollinear nematicity is\nstabilized in a (narrow) temperature range. In this new regime the lattice is\nmonoclinically distorted and short-range spin and orbital order breaks\nrotational invariance. A discussion of possible realizations of this exotic\nstate is provided.\n", "  Aims: In order to test the nature of an (accretion) disk in the vicinity of\nCepheus A HW2, we measured the three-dimensional velocity field of the CH3OH\nmaser spots, which are projected within 1000au of the HW2 object, with an\naccuracy of the order of 0.1km/s. Methods: We made use of the European VLBI\nNetwork (EVN) to image the 6.7GHz CH3OH maser emission towards Cepheus A HW2\nwith 4.5 milli-arcsecond resolution (3au). We observed at three epochs spaced\nby one year between 2013 and 2015. During the last epoch, on mid-march 2015, we\nbenefited from the new deployed Sardinia Radio Telescope. Results: We show that\nthe CH3OH velocity vectors lie on a preferential plane for the gas motion with\nonly small deviations of 12+/-9 degrees away from the plane. This plane is\noriented at a position angle of 134 degrees east of north, and inclined by 26\ndegrees with the line-of-sight, closely matching the orientation of the\ndisk-like structure previously reported by Patel et al.(2005). Knowing the\norientation of the equatorial plane, we can reconstruct a face-on view of the\nCH3OH gas kinematics onto the plane. CH3OH maser emission is detected within a\nradius of 900au from HW2, and down to a radius of about 300au, the latter\ncoincident with the extent of the dust emission at 0.9mm. The velocity field is\ndominated by an infall component of about 2km/s down to a radius of 300au,\nwhere a rotational component of 4km/s becomes dominant. We discuss the nature\nof this velocity field and the implications for the enclosed mass. Conclusions:\nThese findings bring direct support to the interpretation that the high-density\ngas and dust emission, surrounding Cepheus A HW2, trace an accretion disk.\n", "  Aims. We present new IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer observations of Arp\n220 in HCN, HCO$^{+}$, HN$^{13}$C J=1-0, C$_{2}$H N=1-0, SiO J = 2-1, HNCO\nJ$_{k,k'}$ = 5$_{0,4}$ - 4$_{0,4}$, CH$_{3}$CN(6-5), CS J=2-1 and 5-4 and\n$^{13}$CO J=1-0 and 2-1 and of NGC 6240 in HCN, HCO$^{+}$ J = 1-0 and C$_{2}$H\nN = 1-0. In addition, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillmeter Array\nscience verification observations of Arp 220 in CS J = 4-3 and\nCH$_{3}$CN(10-9). Various lines are used to analyse the physical conditions of\nthe molecular gas including the [$^{12}$CO]/[$^{13}$CO] and\n[$^{12}$CO]/[C$^{18}$O] abundance ratios. These observations will be made\navailable to the public. Methods. We create brightness temperature line ratio\nmaps to present the different physical conditions across Arp 220 and NGC 6240.\nIn addition, we use the radiative transfer code RADEX and a Monte Carlo Markov\nChain likelihood code to model the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines of\nArp 220 at ~2\" (~700 pc) scales, where the $^{12}$CO and C$^{18}$O measurements\nwere obtained from literature. Results. Line ratios of optically thick lines\nsuch as $^{12}$CO show smoothly varying ratios while the line ratios of\noptically thin lines such as $^{13}$CO show a east-west gradient across Arp\n220. The HCN/HCO$^{+}$ line ratio differs between Arp 220 and NGC 6240, where\nArp 220 has line ratios above 2 and NGC 6240 below 1. The radiative transfer\nanalysis solution is consistent with a warm (~40 K), moderately dense\n(~10$^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$) molecular gas component averaged over the two nuclei.\nWe find [$^{12}$CO]/[$^{13}$CO] and [$^{12}$CO]/[C$^{18}$O] abundance ratios of\n~90 for both. The abundance enhancement of C$^{18}$O can be explained by\nstellar nucleosynthesis enrichment of the interstellar medium.\n", "  We report the results of the 2dF-VST ATLAS Cold Spot galaxy redshift survey\n(2CSz) based on imaging from VST ATLAS and spectroscopy from 2dF AAOmega over\nthe core of the CMB Cold Spot. We sparsely surveyed the inner 5$^{\\circ}$\nradius of the Cold Spot to a limit of $i_{AB} \\le 19.2$, sampling $\\sim7000$\ngalaxies at $z<0.4$. We have found voids at $z=$ 0.14, 0.26 and 0.30 but they\nare interspersed with small over-densities and the scale of these voids is\ninsufficient to explain the Cold Spot through the $\\Lambda$CDM ISW effect.\nCombining with previous data out to $z\\sim1$, we conclude that the CMB Cold\nSpot could not have been imprinted by a void confined to the inner core of the\nCold Spot. Additionally we find that our 'control' field GAMA G23 shows a\nsimilarity in its galaxy redshift distribution to the Cold Spot. Since the GAMA\nG23 line-of-sight shows no evidence of a CMB temperature decrement we conclude\nthat the Cold Spot may have a primordial origin rather than being due to\nline-of-sight effects.\n", "  The identification of high-redshift massive galaxies with old stellar\npopulations may pose challenges to some models of galaxy formation. However, to\nsecurely classify a galaxy as quiescent, it is necessary to exclude significant\nongoing star formation, something that can be challenging to achieve at high\nredshift. In this letter, we analyse deep ALMA/870um and SCUBA-2/450um imaging\nof the claimed \"post-starburst\" galaxy ZF-20115 at z=3.717 that exhibits a\nstrong Balmer break and absorption lines. The far-infrared imaging reveals a\nluminous starburst located 0.4+/-0.1 arcsec (~3kpc in projection) from the\nposition of the rest-frame ultra-violet/optical emission, with an obscured\nstar-formation rate of 100 Mo/yr. This star-forming component is undetected in\nthe rest-frame ultraviolet but contributes significantly to the lower angular\nresolution photometry at restframe wavelengths >3500A, significantly\ncomplicating the determination of a reliable stellar mass. Importantly, in the\npresence of dust obscuration, strong Balmer features are not a unique signature\nof a post-starburst galaxy and are indeed frequently observed in\ninfrared-luminous galaxies. We conclude that the ZF20015 system does not pose a\nchallenge to current models of galaxy formation and that deep sub-/millimeter\nobservations are a prerequisite for any claims of quiescence. The\nmulti-wavelength observations of ZF20115 unveil a complex system with an\nintricate and spatially-varying star-formation history. ZF20115 demonstrates\nthat understanding high-redshift obscured starbursts will only be possible with\nmulti-wavelength studies that include high-resolution observations, available\nwith the JWST, at mid-infrared wavelengths.\n", "  As part of the EURONEAR project, almost 70,000 mosaic Suprime-Cam images\ntaken between 1999 and 2013 were data mined for about 9,800 near Earth\nasteroids (NEAs) known by 2013 May. Using our PRECOVERY server and the \"Find\nSubaru CCD\" tool, we scrutinized 4,186 candidate CCD images possibly holding\n518 NEAs. We found 113 NEAs as faint as V<25 magnitude, their positions being\nmeasured in 589 images using Astrometrica, then reported to the Minor Planet\nCenter. Among them, 18 objects represent encounters of previously single\nopposition NEAs, their orbital arcs being extended by up to 10 years. In the\nsecond part of this work we searched for unknown NEAs in 78 sequences (780 CCD\nfields) of 4-5 mosaic images selected from the same Suprime-Cam archive and\ntotaling 16.6 sq.deg, with the aim to assess the faint NEA distribution\nobservable with an 8-m class survey. A total of 2,018 moving objects were\nmeasured, from which we identified 18 better NEA candidates. Using the R_c\nfilter in good weather conditions, mostly dark time and sky directions slightly\nbiased towards the ecliptic, at least one NEA could be discovered in every 1\nsq.deg surveyed.\n", "  We discuss the potential advantages of calculating the effective mass of\nquasiparticles in the interacting electron liquid from the low-temperature free\nenergy vis-a-vis the conventional approach, in which the effective mass is\nobtained from approximate calculations of the self-energy, or from a quantum\nMonte Carlo evaluation of the energy of a variational \"quasiparticle wave\nfunction\". While raw quantum Monte Carlo data are presently too sparse to allow\nfor an accurate determination of the effective mass, the values estimated by\nthis method are numerically close to the ones obtained in previous calculations\nusing diagrammatic many-body theory. In contrast to this, a recently published\nparametrization of quantum Monte Carlo data for the free energy of the\nhomogeneous electron liquid yields effective masses that considerably deviate\nfrom previous calculations and even change sign for low densities, reflecting\nan unphysical negative entropy. We suggest that this anomaly is related to the\ntreatment of the exchange energy at finite temperature.\n", "  By the recursion operator of the Kaup-Newell hierarchy we construct the\nrelativistic derivative NLS (RDNLS) equation and the corresponding Lax pair. In\nthe nonrelativistic limit $c \\rightarrow \\infty$ it reduces to DNLS equation\nand preserves integrability at any order of relativistic corrections. The\ncompact explicit representation of the linear problem for this equation becomes\npossible due to notions of the $q$-calculus with two bases, one of which is the\nrecursion operator, and another one is the spectral parameter.\n", "  Using the latest cosmological hydrodynamic N-body simulations of groups and\nclusters, we study how location in phase-space coordinates at $z$$=$$0$ can\nprovide information on environmental effects acting in clusters. We confirm the\nresults of previous authors showing that galaxies tend to follow a typical path\nin phase-space as they settle into the cluster potential. As such, different\nregions of phase-space can be associated with different times since first\ninfalling into the cluster. However, in addition, we see a clear trend between\ntotal mass loss due to cluster tides, and time since infall. Thus we find\nlocation in phase-space provides information on both infall time, and tidal\nmass loss. We find the predictive power of phase-space diagrams remains even\nwhen projected quantities are used (i.e. line-of-sight velocities, and\nprojected distances from the cluster). We provide figures that can be directly\ncompared with observed samples of cluster galaxies and we also provide the data\nused to make them as supplementary data, in order to encourage the use of\nphase-space diagrams as a tool to understand cluster environmental effects. We\nfind that our results depend very weakly on galaxy mass or host mass, so the\npredictions in our phase-space diagrams can be applied to groups or clusters\nalike, or to galaxy populations from dwarfs up to giants.\n", "  At early stages of stellar evolution young stars show powerful jets and/or\noutflows that interact with protoplanetary discs and their surroundings.\nDespite the scarce knowledge about the interaction of jets and/or outflows with\ndiscs, spectroscopic studies based on Herschel and ISO data suggests that gas\nshocked by jets and/or outflows can be traced by far-IR (FIR) emission in\ncertain sources. We want to provide a consistent catalogue of selected atomic\n([OI] and [CII]) and molecular (CO, OH, and H$_{2}$O) line fluxes observed in\nthe FIR, separate and characterize the contribution from the jet and the disc\nto the observed line emission, and place the observations in an evolutionary\npicture. The atomic and molecular FIR (60-190 $\\rm \\mu m$) line emission of\nprotoplanetary discs around 76 T Tauri stars located in Taurus are analysed.\nThe observations were carried out within the Herschel key programme Gas in\nProtoplanetary Systems (GASPS). The spectra were obtained with the\nPhotodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS). The sample is first divided\nin outflow and non-outflow sources according to literature tabulations. With\nthe aid of archival stellar/disc and jet/outflow tracers and model predictions\n(PDRs and shocks), correlations are explored to constrain the physical\nmechanisms behind the observed line emission. The much higher detection rate of\nemission lines in outflow sources and the compatibility of line ratios with\nshock model predictions supports the idea of a dominant contribution from the\njet/outflow to the line emission, in particular at earlier stages of the\nstellar evolution as the brightness of FIR lines depends in large part on the\nspecific evolutionary stage. [Abridged Abstract]\n", "  We point out an unusual relationship among a variety of null geodesic\ncongruences; (a) the generators of ordinary light-cones and (b) certain\n(related) shear-free but twisting congruences in Minkowski Space-time as well\nas (c) asymptotically shear-free null geodesic congruences that exist in the\nneighborhood of Penrose's Scri in Einstein or Einstein-Maxwell asymptotically\nflat-space-times. We refer to these geodesic congruences respectively as:\nLignt-Cones (LCs), as Almost-Complex- Light-Cones, (ACLCs), [though they are\nreal they resemble complex light-cones in complex Minkowski space] and finally\nto a family of congruences in asymptotically flat-spaces as `Almost\nLight-Cones', (ALC). The two essential points of resemblance among the three\nfamilies are: (1) they are all either shear-free or asymptotically shear-free\nand (2) in each family the individual members of the family can be labeled by\nthe points in a real or complex four-dimensional manifold. As an example, the\nMinkowski space LCs are labeled by the (real) coordinate value of their apex.\nIn the case of (ACLCs) (complex coordinate values), the congruences will have\nnon-vanishing twist whose magnitude is determined by the imaginary part of the\ncomplex coordinate values.\n  In studies of gravitational radiation, Bondi-type of null surfaces and their\nassociated Bondi coordinates have been almost exclusively used for\ncalculations. Some surprising relations arise if, instead of the Bondi\ncoordinates, one uses ALCs and their associated coordinate systems in the\nanalysis of the Einstein-Maxwell equations near Scri. More explicitly and\nsurprisingly, the asymptotic Bianchi Identities expressed in the coordinates of\nthe ALCs, turn directly into many of the standard definitions and relations of\nclassical mechanics.\n", "  GASP (GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE) is a new integral-field\nspectroscopic survey with MUSE at the VLT aiming at studying gas removal\nprocesses in galaxies. We present an overview of the survey and show a first\nexample of a galaxy undergoing strong gas stripping. GASP is obtaining deep\nMUSE data for 114 galaxies at z=0.04-0.07 with stellar masses in the range\n10^9.2-10^11.5 M_sun in different environments (galaxy clusters and groups,\nover more than four orders of magnitude in halo mass). GASP targets galaxies\nwith optical signatures of unilateral debris or tails reminiscent of gas\nstripping processes (\"jellyfish galaxies\"), as well as a control sample of disk\ngalaxies with no morphological anomalies. GASP is the only existing Integral\nField Unit (IFU) survey covering both the main galaxy body and the outskirts\nand surroundings, where the IFU data can reveal the presence and the origin of\nthe outer gas. To demonstrate GASP's ability to probe the physics of gas and\nstars, we show the complete analysis of a textbook case of a \"jellyfish\"\ngalaxy, JO206. This is a massive galaxy (9 x 10^10 M_sun in a low-mass cluster\n(sigma ~500 km/s), at a small projected clustercentric radius and a high\nrelative velocity, with >=90kpc-long tentacles of ionized gas stripped away by\nram pressure. We present the spatially resolved kinematics and physical\nproperties of gas and stars, and depict the evolutionary history of this\ngalaxy.\n", "  This paper presents a spatially-resolved kinematic study of the jellyfish\ngalaxy JO201, one of the most spectacular cases of ram-pressure stripping (RPS)\nin the GASP (GAs Stripping Phenomena in Galaxies with MUSE) survey. By studying\nthe environment of JO201, we find that it is moving through the dense\nintra-cluster medium of Abell 85 at supersonic speeds along our line of sight,\nand that it is likely accompanied by a small group of galaxies. Given the\ndensity of the intra-cluster medium and the galaxy's mass, projected position\nand velocity within the cluster, we estimate that JO201 must so far have lost\n~50% of its gas during infall via RPS. The MUSE data indeed reveal a smooth\nstellar disk, accompanied by large projected tails of ionised (Halpha) gas,\ncomposed of kinematically cold (velocity dispersion <40km/s) star-forming knots\nand very warm (>100km/s) diffuse emission which extend out to at least ~50 kpc\nfrom the galaxy centre. The ionised Halpha-emitting gas in the disk rotates\nwith the stars out to ~6 kpc but in the disk outskirts becomes increasingly\nredshifted with respect to the (undisturbed) stellar disk. The observed\ndisturbances are consistent with the presence of gas trailing behind the\nstellar component, resulting from intense face-on RPS happening along the line\nof sight. Our kinematic analysis is consistent with the estimated fraction of\nlost gas, and reveals that stripping of the disk happens outside-in, causing\nshock heating and gas compression in the stripped tails.\n", "  In the weak-field limit of General Relativity, gravitational waves obey\nlinear equations and propagate at the speed of light. These properties of\nGeneral Relativity are supported by the observation of ultra high energy cosmic\nrays as well as by LIGO's recent detection of gravitation waves. We argue that\ntwo existing relativistic generalizations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics,\nnamely Generalized Einstein-Aether theory and BIMOND, display fatal\ninconsistencies with these observations.\n", "  All optical femtosecond relaxation dynamics in a single crystal of\nmono-phosphate tungsten bronze (PO$_{2}$)$_{4}$(WO$_{3}$)$_{2m}$ with alternate\nstacking m=6 of WO$_{3}$ layers was studied through the three consequent charge\ndensity wave (CDW) transitions. Several transient coherent collective modes\nassociated to the different CDW transitions were observed and analyzed in the\nframework of the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Remarkably, the\ninterference of the modes leads to an apparent rectification effect in the\ntransient reflectivity response. A saturation of the coherent-mode amplitudes\nwith increasing pump fluence well below the CDWs destruction threshold fluence\nindicates a decoupling of the electronic and lattice parts of the order\nparameter under strong optical drive.\n", "  We study the constraints imposed by the requirement of Asymptotic Safety on a\nclass of inflationary models with an inflaton field non-minimally coupled to\nthe Ricci scalar. The critical surface in the space of theories is determined\nby the improved renormalization group flow which takes into account quantum\ncorrections beyond the one loop approximation. The combination of constraints\nderiving from Planck observations and those from theory puts severe bounds on\nthe values of the parameters of the model and predicts a quite large tensor to\nscalar ratio. We finally comment on the dependence of the results on the\ndefinition of the infrared energy scale which parametrises the running on the\ncritical surface.\n", "  Although crystallized neutron star crust is responsible for many fascinating\nobservational phenomena, its actual microscopic structure in tremendous\ngravitational and magnetic fields is not understood. Here we show that in a\nnon-uniform magnetic field, three-dimensional ionic Coulomb crystals comprising\nthe crust may stretch or shrink while their electrostatic pressure becomes\nanisotropic. The pressure depends non-linearly on the magnitude of the stretch,\nso that a continuous magnetic field evolution may result in an abrupt crystal\nelongation or contraction. This may provide a trigger for magnetar activity. A\nphonon mode instability is revealed, which sets the limits of magnetic field\nvariation beyond which the crystal is destroyed. These limits sometimes\ncorrespond to surprisingly large deformations. It is not known what happens to\ncrust matter subject to a pressure anisotropy exceeding these limits. We\nhypothesize that the ion system then possesses a long-range order only in one\nor two dimensions, that is becomes a liquid crystal.\n", "  Much excitement has been generated recently by the experimental observation\nof the chiral anomaly in condensed matter physics. This manifests as strong\nnegative longitudinal magnetoresistance and has so far been clearly observed in\nNa$_3$Bi, ZrTe$_5$, and GdPtBi. In this work we point out that the chiral\nanomaly must lead to another effect in topological metals, that has been\noverlooked so far: Giant Planar Hall Effect (GPHE), which is the appearance of\na large transverse voltage when the in plane magnetic field is not aligned with\nthe current. Moreover, we demonstrate that the GPHE is closely related to the\nangular narrowing of the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance signal,\nobserved experimentally.\n", "  Many nearby AGNs display a significant short-term variability. In this work\nwe re-analyze photometric data of four active galactic nuclei observed by\nKepler in order to study the flickering activity, having as main goal that of\nsearching for multiple components in the power density spectra. We find that\nall four objects have similar characteristics, with two break frequencies at\napproximately log(f/Hz)=-5.2 and -4.7. We consider some physical phenomena\nwhose characteristic time-scales are consistent with those observed, in\nparticular mass accretion fluctuations in the inner geometrically thick disc\n(hot X-ray corona) and unstable relativistic Rayleigh-Taylor modes. The former\nis supported by detection of the same break frequencies in the Swift X-ray data\nof ZW229-15. We also discuss rms-flux relations, and we detect a possible\ntypical linear trend at lower flux levels. Our findings support the hypothesis\nof a multiplicative character of variability, in agreement with the propagating\naccretion fluctuation model.\n", "  This paper explores stability of the Einstein universe against linear\nhomogeneous perturbations in the background of $f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity. We\nconstruct static as well as perturbed field equations and investigate stability\nregions for the specific forms of generic function $f(\\mathcal{G},T)$\ncorresponding to conserved as well as non-conserved energy-momentum tensor. We\nuse the equation of state parameter to parameterize the stability regions. The\ngraphical analysis shows that the suitable choice of parameters lead to stable\nregions of the Einstein universe.\n", "  ABRIGED: Quantifying the number, type and distribution of W-R stars is a key\ncomponent in the context of galaxy evolution, since they put constraints on the\nage of the star formation bursts. Nearby galaxies (d<5 Mpc) are particularly\nrelevant in this context since they fill the gap between studies in the Local\nGroup, where individual stars can be resolved, and galaxies in the Local Volume\nand beyond. We intend to characterize the W-R star population in NGC625, a\nlow-metallicity dwarf galaxy suffering a currently declining burst of star\nformation. Optical IFS data have been obtained with the VIMOS-IFU covering the\nstarburst region. We estimate the number of W-R stars using a linear\ncombination of 3 W-R templates: 1 early-type nitrogen (WN) star, 1 late-type WN\nstar and 1 carbon-type (WC) star (or oxygen-type (WO) star). Fits using several\nensembles of templates were tested. Results were confronted with: i) high\nspatial resolution HST photometry; ii) numbers of W-R stars in nearby galaxies;\niii) model predictions. The W-R star population is spread over the main body of\nthe galaxy, not necessarily coincident with the overall stellar distribution.\nOur best estimation for the number of W-R stars yields a total of 28 W-R stars\nin the galaxy, out of which 17 are early- type WN, 6 are late-type WN and 5 are\nWC stars. The width of the stellar features nicely correlates with the dominant\nW-R type found in each aperture. The distribution of the different types of WR\nin the galaxy is roughly compatible with the way star formation has propagated\nin the galaxy, according to previous findings using HST images. Fits using\ntemplates at the metallicity of the LMC yield more reasonable number of W-R\nthan those using templates at the metallicity of the SMC. Given the metallicity\nof NGC 625, this suggests a non-linear relation between the metallicity and the\nluminosity of the W-R spectral features.\n", "  The collisionless axisymmetric zonal flow residual calculation for a tokamak\nplasma is generalized to include electromagnetic perturbations. We formulate\nand solve the complete initial value zonal flow problem by retaining the fully\nself-consistent axisymmetric spatial perturbations in the electric and magnetic\nfields. Simple expressions for the electrostatic, shear and compressional\nmagnetic residual responses are derived that provide a fully electromagnetic\ntest of the zonal flow residual in gyrokinetic codes. Unlike the electrostatic\npotential, the parallel vector potential and the parallel magnetic field\nperturbations need not relax to flux functions for all possible initial\nconditions.\n", "  Low radio frequency surveys are important for testing unified models of\nradio-loud quasars and radio galaxies. Intrinsically similar sources that are\nrandomly oriented on the sky will have different projected linear sizes.\nMeasuring the projected linear sizes of these sources provides an indication of\ntheir orientation. Steep-spectrum isotropic radio emission allows for\norientation-free sample selection at low radio frequencies. We use a new radio\nsurvey of the Bo\\\"otes field at 150 MHz made with the Low Frequency Array\n(LOFAR) to select a sample of radio sources. We identify 44 radio galaxies and\n16 quasars with powers $P>10^{25.5}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 150 MHz using cross-matched\nmulti-wavelength information from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES),\nwhich provides spectroscopic redshifts. We find that LOFAR-detected radio\nsources with steep spectra have projected linear sizes that are on average\n4.4$\\pm$1.4 larger than those with flat spectra. The projected linear sizes of\nradio galaxies are on average 3.1$\\pm$1.0 larger than those of quasars\n(2.0$\\pm$0.3 after correcting for redshift evolution). Combining these results\nwith three previous surveys, we find that the projected linear sizes of radio\ngalaxies and quasars depend on redshift but not on power. The projected linear\nsize ratio does not correlate with either parameter. The LOFAR data is\nconsistent within the uncertainties with theoretical predictions of the\ncorrelation between the quasar fraction and linear size ratio, based on an\norientation-based unification scheme.\n", "  Recent angle-resolved spectroscopy in BiS$_2$-based superconductors has\nindicated that the superconducting gap amplitude possesses remarkable\nanisotropy and/or a sign change on a small Fermi pocket around $X$ point. It\nimplies a possibility of an unconventional pairing state. Here we study the gap\nanisotropy in superconductivity mediated by inherent charge/quadrupole\nfluctuations in an extended Hubbard model, which includes inter-site\ninteraction between Bi and S atoms. The first-principles downfolded band\nstructure is composed of Bi $6p_x/p_y$ and S $3p_x/p_y$ orbitals on a BiS$_2$\nsingle layer. Evaluating the linearized gap equation, we find that the ferroic\ncharge/quadrupole fluctuation driven by the inter-site interaction leads to a\nfully-gapped $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state, in which the gap amplitude has\nsizable anisotropy on the Fermi surface.\n", "  An effect of atomic line broadening induced by the blackbody radiation is\ndiscussed. The level mixing effect and anti-Stokes Raman scattering are\ncompared. It is shown that the mixing effect gives the most significant\ncontribution to the line broadening and it is indicated how to distinguish\nthese two effects in laboratory experiments. The influence of the level mixing\non the recombination history of primordial plasma is also discussed.\n", "  Studies were made of the 1-70 keV persistent spectra of fifteen magnetars as\na complete sample observed with Suzaku from 2006 to 2013. Combined with early\nNuSTAR observations of four hard X-ray emitters, nine objects showed a hard\npower-law emission dominating at $\\gtrsim$10 keV with the 15--60 keV flux of\n$\\sim$1-$11\\times 10^{-11}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. The hard X-ray luminosity\n$L_{\\rm h}$, relative to that of a soft-thermal surface radiation $L_{\\rm s}$,\ntends to become higher toward younger and strongly magnetized objects. Updated\nfrom the previous study, their hardness ratio, defined as $\\xi=L_{\\rm h}/L_{\\rm\ns}$, is correlated with the measured spin-down rate $\\dot{P}$ as $\\xi=0.62\n\\times (\\dot{P}/10^{-11}\\,{\\rm s}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1})^{0.72}$, corresponding with\npositive and negative correlations of the dipole field strength $B_{\\rm d}$\n($\\xi \\propto B_{\\rm d}^{1.41}$) and the characteristic age $\\tau_{\\rm c}$\n($\\xi \\propto \\tau_{\\rm c}^{-0.68}$), respectively. Among our sample, five\ntransients were observed during X-ray outbursts, and the results are compared\nwith their long-term 1-10 keV flux decays monitored with Swift/XRT and\nRXTE/PCA. Fading curves of three bright outbursts are approximated by an\nempirical formula used in the seismology, showing a $\\sim$10-40 d plateau\nphase. Transients show the maximum luminosities of $L_{\\rm s}$$\\sim$$10^{35}$\nerg s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to those of the persistently bright ones, and\nfade back to $\\lesssim$$10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Spectral properties are\ndiscussed in a framework of the magnetar hypothesis.\n", "  We investigate the Hawking radiation cascade from the five-dimensional\ncharged black hole with a scalar field coupled to higher-order Euler densities\nin a conformally invariant manner. We give the semi-analytic calculation of\ngreybody factors for the Hawking radiation. Our analysis shows that the Hawking\nradiation cascade from this five-dimensional black hole is extremely sparse.\nThe charge enhances the sparsity of the Hawking radiation, while the\nconformally coupled scalar field reduces this sparsity.\n", "  A spectroscopic analysis has been undertaken for the B-type multiple systems\n(excluding those with supergiant primaries) in the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey\n(VFTS). Projected rotational velocities, $v$sin$i$, for the primaries have been\nestimated using a Fourier Transform technique and confirmed by fitting\nrotationally broadened profiles. A subset of 33 systems with $v$sin$i$$\\leq$ 80\nkm/s have been analysed using a TLUSTY grid of model atmospheres to estimate\nstellar parameters and surface abundances for the primaries. The effects of a\npotential flux contribution from an unseen secondary have also been considered.\nFor 20 targets it was possible to reliably estimate their effective\ntemperatures (T$_{eff}$) but for the other 13 objects it was only possible to\nprovide a constraint of 20,000$\\leq$T$_{eff}$$\\leq$26,000 K -- the other\nparameters estimated for these targets will be consequently less reliable. The\nestimated stellar properties are compared with evolutionary models and are\ngenerally consistent with their membership of 30 Doradus, while the nature of\nthe secondaries of 3 SB2 system is discussed. A comparison with a sample of\nsingle stars with $v$sin$i$$\\leq$ 80 km/s obtained from the VFTS and analysed\nwith the same techniques implies that the atmospheric parameters and nitrogen\nabundances of the two samples are similar. However, the binary sample may have\na lack of primaries with significant nitrogen enhancements, which would be\nconsistent with them having low rotational velocities and having effectively\nevolved as single stars without significant rotational mixing. This result,\nwhich may be actually a consequence of the limitations of the pathfinder\ninvestigation presented in this paper, should be considered as a motivation for\nspectroscopic abundance analysis of large samples of binary stars, with high\nquality observational data.\n", "  $K^-$ optical potentials relevant to calculations of $K^-$ nuclear\nquasi-bound states were developed within several chiral meson-baryon\ncoupled-channel interaction models. The applied models yield quite different\n$K^-$ binding energies and widths. Then, the $K^-$ multinucleon interactions\nwere incorporated by a phenomenological optical potential fitted recently to\nkaonic atom data. Though the applied $K^-$ interaction models differ\nsignificantly in the $K^-N$ subthreshold region, our self-consistent\ncalculations of kaonic nuclei across the periodic table lead to conclusions\nvalid quite generally. Due to $K^-$ multinucleon absorption in the nuclear\nmedium the calculated widths of $K^-$ nuclear states are sizable, $\\Gamma_{K^-}\n\\geq 90$ MeV, and exceed substantially their binding energies in all considered\nnuclei.\n", "  The supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar-mass\nblack holes in X-ray binaries (XRBs) are believed to work in a similar way.\nWhile XRBs evolve rapidly and several sources have undergone a few complete\ncycles from quiescence to an outburst and back, most AGN remain in the same\nstate over periods of decades, due to their longer characteristic timescale\nproportional to their size. However, the study of the AGN spectral states is\nstill possible with a large sample of sources. Multi-wavelength observations\nare needed for this purpose since the AGN thermal disc emission dominates in\nthe ultraviolet energy range, while the up-scattered hot-corona emission is\ndetected in X-rays. We compared simultaneous UV and X-ray measurements of AGN\nobtained by the XMM-Newton satellite. The non-thermal flux was constrained from\nthe 2-12 keV X-ray luminosity, while the thermal disc component was estimated\nfrom the UV flux at 2900A. The hardness (ratio between the X-ray and UV plus\nX-ray luminosity) and the total luminosity were used to construct the AGN state\ndiagrams. For sources with reliable mass measurements, the Eddington ratio was\nused instead of the total luminosity. The state diagrams show that the\nradio-loud sources have on average higher hardness, due to the lack of the\nthermal disc emission in the UV band, and have flatter intrinsic X-ray spectra.\nIn contrast, the sources with high luminosity and low hardness are radio-quiet\nAGN. The hardness-Eddington ratio diagram reveals that the average\nradio-loudness is stronger for low-accreting sources, while it decreases when\nthe accretion rate is close to the Eddington limit. Our results indicate that\nthe general properties of AGN accretion states are similar to those of X-ray\nbinaries. This suggests that the AGN radio dichotomy of radio-loud and\nradio-quiet sources can be explained by the evolution of the accretion states.\n", "  PBC J2333.9-2343 is a giant radio galaxy which shows different\ncharacteristics at different wavebands that are difficult to explain within the\nactual generic schemes of unification of active galactic nuclei (AGN), thus\nbeing a good candidate to host different phases of nuclear activity. We aim at\ndisentangling the nature of this AGN by using simultaneous multiwavelength\ndata. We obtained data in 2015 from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), the\nSan Pedro M\\'{a}rtir telescope, and the XMM-Newton}observatories. This allows\nthe study of the nuclear parts of the galaxy through its morphology and\nspectra, as well as the analysis of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We\nalso reanalysed optical data from the San Pedro M\\'{a}rtir telescope from 2009\npreviously presented in Parisi et al. (2012) for a homogeneous comparison. At\nX-ray frequencies, the source is unabsorbed. The optical spectra are of a type\n1.9 AGN, both in 2009 and 2015, although showing a broader component in 2015.\nThe VLBA radio images show an inverted spectrum with self-absorbed, optically\nthick compact core and steep spectrum, optically thin jet. The SED resembles\nthat of typical blazars and is best represented by an external Compton (EC)\nmodel with a viewing angle of $\\sim$ 3-6 degrees. The apparent size of the\nlarge scale structure of PBC J2333.9-2343 must correspond to an intrinsic\ndeprojected value of $\\sim 7$ Mpc for $\\theta_v<10^\\circ$, and to $> 13$ Mpc\nfor $\\theta_v<5^\\circ$, a value much larger than the bigger giant radio galaxy\nknown (4.5 Mpc). The above arguments suggest that PBC J2333.9-2343 has\nundergone through a new episode of nuclear activity and that the direction of\nthe new jet has changed, in the plane of the sky and is now pointing towards\nus, making this source from being a radio galaxy to become a blazar, a very\nexceptional case of restarting activity.\n", "  We present the development of a real-time flare monitor for the High Altitude\nWater Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. The flare monitor has been fully\noperational since 2017 January and is designed to detect very high energy (VHE;\n$E\\gtrsim100$ GeV) transient events from blazars on time scales lasting from 2\nminutes to 10 hours in order to facilitate multiwavelength and multimessenger\nstudies. These flares provide information for investigations into the\nmechanisms that power the blazars' relativistic jets and accelerate particles\nwithin them, and they may also serve as probes of the populations of particles\nand fields in intergalactic space. To date, the detection of blazar flares in\nthe VHE range has relied primarily on pointed observations by imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The recently completed HAWC observatory\noffers the opportunity to study VHE flares in survey mode, scanning 2/3 of the\nentire sky every day with a field of view of $\\sim$1.8 steradians. In this\nwork, we report on the sensitivity of the HAWC real-time flare monitor and\ndemonstrate its capabilities via the detection of three high-confidence VHE\nevents in the blazars Markarian 421 and Markarian 501.\n", "  The propagation of charged cosmic rays through the Galactic environment\ninfluences all aspects of the observation at Earth. Energy spectrum,\ncomposition and arrival directions are changed due to deflections in magnetic\nfields and interactions with the interstellar medium. Today the transport is\nsimulated with different simulation methods either based on the solution of a\ntransport equation (multi-particle picture) or a solution of an equation of\nmotion (single-particle picture).\n  We developed a new module for the publicly available propagation software\nCRPropa 3.1, where we implemented an algorithm to solve the transport equation\nusing stochastic differential equations. This technique allows us to use a\ndiffusion tensor which is anisotropic with respect to an arbitrary magnetic\nbackground field. The source code of CRPropa is written in C++ with python\nsteering via SWIG which makes it easy to use and computationally fast.\n  In this paper, we present the new low-energy propagation code together with\nvalidation procedures that are developed to proof the accuracy of the new\nimplementation. Furthermore, we show first examples of the cosmic ray density\nevolution, which depends strongly on the ratio of the parallel\n$\\kappa_\\parallel$ and perpendicular $\\kappa_\\perp$ diffusion coefficients.\nThis dependency is systematically examined as well the influence of the\nparticle rigidity on the diffusion process.\n", "  Based on recent high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nmeasurement in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_{3}$, we constructed a\ntight-binding model and proposed a superconducting (SC) pairing function which\ncan well fit the observed band structure and SC gap anisotropy. Then we\ninvestigated the spin excitation spectra in order to determine the possible\nsign structure of the SC order parameter. We found that a resonance-like spin\nexcitation may occur if the SC order parameter changes sign along the Fermi\nsurfaces. However, this resonance is located at different locations in momentum\nspace compared to other FeSe-based superconductors, suggesting that the Fermi\nsurface shape and pairing symmetry in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ may\nbe different from other FeSe-based superconductors.\n", "  We perform ultrasound velocity measurements on a single crystal of\nnearly-metallic spinel Co$_{1.21}$V$_{1.79}$O$_4$ which exhibits a\nferrimagnetic phase transition at $T_C \\sim$ 165 K. The experiments reveal a\nvariety of elastic anomalies in not only the paramagnetic phase above $T_C$ but\nalso the ferrimagnetic phase below $T_C$, which should be driven by the\nnearly-itinerant character of the orbitally-degenerate V 3$d$ electrons. In the\nparamagnetic phase above $T_C$, the elastic moduli exhibit\nelastic-mode-dependent unusual temperature variations, suggesting the existence\nof a dynamic spin-cluster state. Furthermore, above $T_C$, the sensitive\nmagnetic-field response of the elastic moduli suggests that, with the negative\nmagnetoresistance, the magnetic-field-enhanced nearly-itinerant character of\nthe V 3$d$ electrons emerges from the spin-cluster state. This should be\ntriggered by the inter-V-site interactions acting on the orbitally-degenerate\n3$d$ electrons. In the ferrimagnetic phase below $T_C$, the elastic moduli\nexhibit distinct anomalies at $T_1\\sim$ 95 K and $T_2\\sim$ 50 K, with a sign\nchange of the magnetoresistance at $T_1$ (positive below $T_1$) and an\nenhancement of the positive magnetoresistance below $T_2$, respectively. These\nobservations below $T_C$ suggest the successive occurrence of an orbital glassy\norder at $T_1$ and a structural phase transition at $T_2$, where the rather\nlocalized character of the V 3$d$ electrons evolves below $T_1$ and is further\nenhanced below $T_2$.\n", "  RSG stars are very massive cool evolved stars. Recently, a weak magnetic\nfield was measured at the surface of $\\alpha$ Ori and this is so far the only\nM-type supergiant for which a direct detection of a surface magnetic field has\nbeen reported. By extending the search for surface magnetic field in a sample\nof late-type supergiants, we want to determine whether the surface magnetic\nfield detected on $\\alpha$ Ori is a common feature among the M-type\nsupergiants. With the spectropolarimeter Narval at TBL we undertook a search\nfor surface magnetic fields in a sample of cool supergiant stars, and we\nanalysed circular polarisation spectra using the least-squares deconvolution\ntechnique. We detect weak Zeeman signatures of stellar origin in the targets CE\nTau, $\\alpha^1$ Her and $\\mu$ Cep. For the latter star, we also show that\ncross-talk from the strong linear polarisation signals detected on this star\nmust be taken into account. For CE Tau and $\\mu$ Cep, the longitudinal\ncomponent of the detected surface fields is at the Gauss-level, such as in\n$\\alpha$~Ori. We measured a longitudinal field almost an order of magnitude\nstronger for $\\alpha^1$ Her. We also report variability of the longitudinal\nmagnetic field of CE Tau and $\\alpha^1$ Her, with changes in good agreement\nwith the typical atmospheric dynamics time-scales. We also report a\nnon-detection of magnetic field at the surface of the yellow supergiant star\n$\\rho$ Cas. The two RSG stars of our sample, CE Tau and $\\mu$ Cep, display\nmagnetic fields very similar to that of $\\alpha$ Ori. The non-detection of a\nmagnetic field on the post-RSG star $\\rho$ Cas suggests that the magnetic field\ndisappears, or at least becomes undetectable with present methods, at later\nevolutionary stages. Our analysis of $\\alpha^1$ Her supports the proposed\nreclassification of the star as an AGB star.\n", "  We study the cosmological model based on Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with\nnon-minimal coupling of a scalar field to a Gauss-Bonnet term in 4D Friedmann\nuniverse. We show how constructing the exact solutions by the method based on a\nconfrontation of the Hubble parameter in the model under consideration with\nthat in a standard scalar field inflationary cosmology.\n", "  A mixture of hard squares, dimers and vacancies on a square lattice is known\nto undergo a transition from a low-density disordered phase to high-density\ncolumnar ordered phase. Along the fully packed square-dimer line, the system\nundergoes an Kosterliz-Thouless type transition to a phase with power law\ncorrelations. We estimate the phase boundary separating the ordered and\ndisordered phases by calculating the interfacial tension between two\ndifferently ordered phases within two different approximation schemes. The\nanalytically obtained phase boundary is in good agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n", "  We report the discovery and multicolor (VRIW) photometry of a rare explosive\nstar MASTER OT J004207.99+405501.1 - a luminous red nova - in the Andromeda\ngalaxy M31N2015-01a. We use our original light curve acquired with identical\nMASTER Global Robotic Net telescopes in one photometric system: VRI during\nfirst 30 days and W (unfiltered) during 70 days. Also we added publishied\nmulticolor photometry data to estimate the mass and energy of the ejected\nshell, and discuss the likely formation scenarios of outbursts of this type. We\npropose the interpretation of the explosion, that is consistent with the\nevolutionary scenario where star merger is a natural stage of the evolution of\nclose-mass stars and may serve as an extra channel for the formation of nova\noutbursts.\n", "  Theoretical and observational evidences have been recently gained for a\ntwo-fold classification of short bursts: 1) short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs),\nwith isotropic energy $E_{iso}<10^{52}$~erg and no BH formation, and 2) the\nauthentic short gamma-ray bursts (S-GRBs), with isotropic energy\n$E_{iso}>10^{52}$~erg evidencing a BH formation in the binary neutron star\nmerging process. The signature for the BH formation consists in the on-set of\nthe high energy ($0.1$--$100$~GeV) emission, coeval to the prompt emission, in\nall S-GRBs. No GeV emission is expected nor observed in the S-GRFs. In this\npaper we present two additional S-GRBs, GRB 081024B and GRB 140402A, following\nthe already identified S-GRBs, i.e., GRB 090227B, GRB 090510 and GRB 140619B.\nWe also return on the absence of the GeV emission of the S-GRB 090227B, at an\nangle of $71^{\\rm{o}}$ from the \\textit{Fermi}-LAT boresight. All the correctly\nidentified S-GRBs correlate to the high energy emission, implying no\nsignificant presence of beaming in the GeV emission. The existence of a common\npower-law behavior in the GeV luminosities, following the BH formation, when\nmeasured in the source rest-frame, points to a commonality in the mass and spin\nof the newly-formed BH in all S-GRBs.\n", "  We argue that a large region of so far unconstrained parameter space for\naxion-like particles (ALPs), where their couplings to the Standard Model are of\norder $(0.01\\!-\\!1)\\,\\mbox{TeV}^{-1}$, can be explored by searches for the\nexotic Higgs decays $h\\to Za$ and $h\\to aa$ in Run-2 of the LHC. Almost the\ncomplete region in which ALPs can explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nmuon can be probed by searches for these decays with subsequent decay\n$a\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, even if the relevant couplings are loop suppressed and the\n$a\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ branching ratio is less than~1.\n", "  The star EPIC 210894022 has been identified from a light curve acquired\nthrough the K2 space mission as possibly orbited by a transiting planet. Our\naim is to confirm the planetary nature of the object and derive its fundamental\nparameters. We combine the K2 photometry with reconnaissance spectroscopy and\nradial velocity (RV) measurements obtained using three separate telescope and\nspectrograph combinations. The spectroscopic synthesis package SME has been\nused to derive the stellar photospheric parameters that were used as input to\nvarious stellar evolutionary tracks in order to derive the parameters of the\nsystem. The planetary transit was also validated to occur on the assumed host\nstar through adaptive imaging and statistical analysis. The star is found to be\nlocated in the background of the Hyades cluster at a distance at least 4 times\nfurther away from Earth than the cluster itself. The spectrum and the space\nvelocities of EPIC 210894022 strongly suggest it to be a member of the thick\ndisk population. We find that the star is a metal poor ([Fe/H]=-0.53+/-0.05\ndex) and alpha-rich somewhat evolved solar-like object of spectral type G3 with\nTeff=5730+/-50 K, logg=4.15+/-0.1 (cgs), radius of 1.3+/-0.1 R_Sun, and mass of\n0.88+/-0.02 M_Sun. The RV detection together with the imaging confirms with a\nhigh level of significance that the transit signature is caused by a\nsuper-Earth orbiting the star EPIC 210894022. We measure a mass of 8.6+/-3.9\nM_Earth and a radius of 1.9+/-0.2 R_Earth. A second more massive object with a\nperiod longer than about 120 days is indicated by a long term linear\nacceleration. With an age of > 10 Gyrs this system is one of the oldest where\nplanets is hitherto detected. Further studies of this planetary system is\nimportant since it contains information about the planetary formation process\nduring a very early epoch of the history of our Galaxy.\n", "  Recently, large samples of visually classified early-type galaxies (ETGs)\ncontaining dust have been identified using space-based infrared observations\nwith the Herschel Space Telescope. The presence of large quantities of dust in\nmassive ETGs is peculiar as X-ray halos of these galaxies are expected to\ndestroy dust in 10 Myr (or less). This has sparked a debate regarding the\norigin of the dust: is it internally produced by asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars, or is it accreted externally through mergers? We examine the 2D stellar\nand ionised gas kinematics of dusty ETGs using IFS observations from the SAMI\ngalaxy survey, and integrated star-formation rates, stellar masses, and dust\nmasses from the GAMA survey. Only 8% (4/49) of visually-classified ETGs are\nkinematically consistent with being dispersion-supported systems. These\n\"dispersion-dominated galaxies\" exhibit discrepancies between stellar and\nionised gas kinematics, either offsets in the kinematic position angle or large\ndifferences in the rotational velocity, and are outliers in star-formation rate\nat a fixed dust mass compared to normal star-forming galaxies. These properties\nare suggestive of recent merger activity. The remaining 90% of dusty ETGs have\nlow velocity dispersions and/or large circular velocities, typical of\n\"rotation-dominated galaxies\". These results, along with the general evidence\nof published works on X-ray emission in ETGs, suggest that they are unlikely to\nhost hot, X-ray gas consistent with their low stellar mass when compared to\ndispersion-dominated galaxies. This means dust will be long lived and thus\nthese galaxies do not require external scenarios for the origin of their dust\ncontent.\n", "  We calculate the masses and weak decay constants of flavorless ground and\nradially excited $J^P=1^-$ mesons and the corresponding quantities for the K^*,\nwithin a Poincar\\'e covariant continuum framework based on the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation. We use in both, the quark's gap equation and the meson bound-state\nequation, an infrared massive and finite interaction in the leading\nsymmetry-preserving truncation. While our numerical results are in rather good\nagreement with experimental values where they are available, no single\nparametrization of the QCD inspired interaction reproduces simultaneously the\nground and excited mass spectrum, which confirms earlier work on pseudoscalar\nmesons. This feature being a consequence of the lowest truncation, we pin down\nthe range and strength of the interaction in both cases to identify common\nqualitative features that may help to tune future interaction models beyond the\nrainbow-ladder approximation.\n", "  We present a systematic analysis of X-ray archival data of all the 29 quasars\n(QSOs) at $z$ > 5.5 observed so far with Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT,\nincluding the most-distant quasar ever discovered, ULAS J1120+0641 ($z$ =\n7.08). This study allows us to place constraints on the mean spectral\nproperties of the primordial population of luminous Type 1 (unobscured)\nquasars. Eighteen quasars are detected in the X-ray band, and we provide\nspectral-fitting results for their X-ray properties, while for the others we\nprovide upper limits to their soft (0.5-2.0 keV) X-ray flux. We measured the\npower-law photon index and derived an upper limit to the column density for the\nfive quasars (J1306+0356, J0100+2802, J1030+0524, J1148+5251, J1120+0641) with\nthe best spectra (> 30 net counts in the 0.5-7.0 keV energy range) and find\nthat they are consistent with values from the literature and lower-redshift\nquasars. By stacking the spectra of ten quasars detected by Chandra in the\nredshift range 5.7 $\\le$ $z$ $\\le$ 6.1 we find a mean X-ray power-law photon\nindex of $\\Gamma = 1.92_{-0.27}^{+0.28}$ and a neutral intrinsic absorption\ncolumn density of $N_H \\le 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. These results suggest that the\nX-ray spectral properties of luminous quasars have not evolved up to $z$\n$\\approx$ 6. We also derived the optical-X-ray spectral slopes ($\\alpha_{ox}$)\nof our sample and combined them with those of previous works, confirming that\n$\\alpha_{ox}$ strongly correlates with UV monochromatic luminosity at 2500 \\AA\n. These results strengthen the non-evolutionary scenario for the spectral\nproperties of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN).\n", "  Understanding the physics of beam-plasma systems is of great importance for a\nlarge number of astrophysical systems. Recently the validity of\nparticle-in-cell simulations of these systems has been questioned by Shalaby et\nal. (2017) We analyse one specific beam-plasma and its numerical simulations\nKempf et al. (2016) that has been critized and prove that in fact the\nsimulations performed fulfill the new validity criteria introduced by Shalaby\net al. (2016).\n", "  We report angular-dependent spin-wave spectroscopy on kagome artificial spin\nice made of large arrays of interconnected Ni80Fe20 nanobars. Spectra taken in\nsaturated and disordered states exhibit a series of resonances with\ncharacteristic in-plane angular dependencies. Micromagnetic simulations allow\nus to interpret characteristic resonances of a two-step magnetization reversal\nof the nanomagnets. The dynamic properties are consistent with topological\ndefects that are provoked via a magnetic field applied at specific angles.\nSimulations that we performed on previously investigated kagome artificial spin\nice consisting of isolated nanobars show characteristic discrepancies in the\nspin wave modes which we explain by the absence of vertices.\n", "  With a sample of 48,161 K giant stars selected from the LAMOST DR 2\ncatalogue, we construct torus models in a large volume extending, for the first\ntime, from the solar vicinity to a Galactocentric distance of $\\sim 20$ kpc,\nreaching the outskirts of the Galactic disc. We show that the kinematics of the\nK giant stars match conventional models, e.g. as created by Binney in 2012, in\nthe Solar vicinity. However such two-disc models fail if they are extended to\nthe outer regions, even if an additional disc component is utilised. If we\nloosen constraints in the Sun's vicinity, we find that an effective thick disc\nmodel could explain the anti-centre of the MW. The LAMOST data imply that the\nsizes of the Galactic discs are much larger, and that the outer disc is much\nthicker, than previously thought, or alternatively that the outer structure is\nnot a conventional disc at all. However, the velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{0z}$\nof the kinematically thick disc in the best-fitting model is about 80 km\ns$^{-1}$ and has a scale parameter $R_{\\sigma}$ for an exponential distribution\nfunction of $\\sim 19$ kpc. Such a height $\\sigma_{0z}$ is strongly rejected by\ncurrent measurements in the solar neighbourhood, and thus a model beyond\nquasi-thermal, two or three thin or thick discs is required.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of dark matter signals of supersymmetric\nmodels containing an extra $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge group. We investigate scenarios\nin which either the right sneutrino or the lightest neutralino are\nphenomenologically acceptable dark matter candidates and we explore the\nparameter spaces of different supersymmetric realisations featuring an extra\n$U(1)^\\prime$. We impose consistency with low energy observables, with known\nmass limits for the superpartners and $Z^\\prime$ bosons, as well as with Higgs\nboson signal strengths, and we moreover verify that predictions for the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon agree with the experimental value and\nrequire that the dark matter candidate satisfies the observed relic density and\ndirect and indirect dark matter detection constraints. For the case where the\nsneutrino is the dark matter candidate, we find distinguishing characteristics\namong different $U(1)^\\prime$ mixing angles. If the neutralino is the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle, its mass is heavier than that of the light sneutrino\nin scenarios where the latter is a dark matter candidate, the parameter space\nis less restricted and differentiation between models is more difficult. We\nfinally comment on the possible collider tests of these models.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new Herbig-Haro jet, HH 1165, in SOAR\nnarrow-band imaging of the vicinity of the sigma Orionis cluster. HH 1165 shows\na spectacular extended and collimated spatial structure, with a projected\nlength of 0.26 pc, a bent C-shaped morphology, multiple knots, and fragmented\nbow-shocks at the apparent ends of the flow. The Halpha image shows a bright\nhalo with a clumpy distribution of material seen around the driving source, and\ncurved reflection nebulosity tracing the outflow cavities. The driving source\nof HH 1165 is a Class I proto-brown dwarf, Mayrit 1701117 (M1701117), with a\ntotal (dust+gas) mass of ~36 MJup and a bolometric luminosity of ~0.1 Lsun.\nHigh-resolution VLT/UVES spectra of M1701117 show a wealth of emission lines\nindicative of strong outflow and accretion activity. SOAR/Goodman\nlow-resolution spectra along the jet axis show an asymmetrical morphology for\nHH 1165. We find a puzzling picture wherein the north-west part exhibits a\nclassical HH jet running into a pre-dominantly neutral medium, while the\nsouthern part resembles an externally irradiated jet. The C-shaped bending in\nHH 1165 may be produced by the combined effects from the massive stars in the\nionization front to the east, the sigma Orionis core to the west, and the close\nproximity to the B2-type star HR 1950. HH 1165 shows all of the signatures to\nbe considered as a scaled-down version of parsec-length HH jets, and can be\ntermed as the first sub-stellar analog of a protostellar HH jet system.\n", "  Context. We are creating the AKARI mid-infrared all-sky diffuse maps. Through\na foreground removal of the zodiacal emission, we serendipitously detected a\nbright residual component whose angular size is about 50 x 20 deg. at a\nwavelength of 9 micron. Aims. We investigate the origin and the physical\nproperties of the residual component. Methods. We measured the surface\nbrightness of the residual component in the AKARI mid-infrared all-sky maps.\nResults. The residual component was significantly detected only in 2007\nJanuary, even though the same region was observed in 2006 July and 2007 July,\nwhich shows that it is not due to the Galactic emission. We suggest that this\nmay be a small cloud passing near the Earth. By comparing the observed\nintensity ratio of I_9um/I_18um with the expected intensity ratio assuming\nthermal equilibrium of dust grains at 1 AU for various dust compositions and\nsizes, we find that dust grains in the moving cloud are likely to be much\nsmaller than typical grains that produce the bulk of the zodiacal light.\nConclusions. Considering the observed date and position, it is likely that it\noriginates in the solar coronal mass ejection (CME) which took place on 2007\nJanuary 25.\n", "  Many giant exoplanets are found near their Roche limit and in mildly\neccentric orbits. In this study we examine the fate of such planets through\nRoche-lobe overflow as a function of the physical properties of the binary\ncomponents, including the eccentricity and the asynchronicity of the rotating\nplanet. We use a direct three-body integrator to compute the trajectories of\nthe lost mass in the ballistic limit and investigate the possible outcomes. We\nfind three different outcomes for the mass transferred through the Lagrangian\npoint $L_{1}$: (i) self-accretion by the planet, (ii) direct impact on the\nstellar surface, (iii) disk formation around the star. We explore the parameter\nspace of the three different regimes and find that at low eccentricities,\n$e\\lesssim 0.2$, mass overflow leads to disk formation for most systems, while\nfor higher eccentricities or retrograde orbits self-accretion is the only\npossible outcome. We conclude that the assumption often made in previous work\nthat when a planet overflows its Roche lobe it is quickly disrupted and\naccreted by the star is not always valid.\n", "  Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$ is an overdoped analog of hole-doped layered cuprates. Here\nwe show via ab initio calculations that Ce-doped Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$\n(Pr$_3$CeNi$_3$O$_8$) has the same electronic structure as the\nantiferromagnetic insulating phase of parent cuprates. We find that substantial\nCe-doping should be thermodynamically stable and that other 4+ cations would\nyield a similar antiferromagnetic insulating state, arguing this configuration\nis robust for layered nickelates of low enough valence. The analogies with\ncuprates at different $d$ fillings suggest that intermediate Ce-doping\nconcentrations near 1/8 should be an appropriate place to search for\nsuperconductivity in these low-valence Ni oxides.\n", "  We introduce a scheme for remote entanglement generation for the photon\npolarization. The technique is based on transferring the initial frequency\ncorrelations to specific polarization-frequency correlations by local dephasing\nand their subsequent removal by frequency up-conversion. On fundamental level,\nour theoretical results show how to create and transfer entanglement, to\nparticles which never interact, by means of local operations. This possibility\nstems from the multi-path interference and its control in frequency space. For\napplications, the developed techniques and results allow for the remote\ngeneration of entanglement with distant parties without Bell state measurements\nand opens the perspective to probe frequency-frequency entanglement by\nmeasuring the polarization state of the photons.\n", "  Accurate temperature calculations for circumstellar disks are particularly\nimportant for their chemical evolution. Their temperature distribution is\ndetermined by the optical properties of the dust grains, which, among other\nparameters, depend on their radius. However, in most disk studies, only average\noptical properties and thus an average temperature is assumed to account for an\nensemble of grains with different radii. We investigate the impact of\nsubdividing the grain radius distribution into multiple sub-intervals on the\nresulting dust temperature distribution and spectral energy distribution (SED).\nThese quantities were computed for two different scenarios: (1) Radius\ndistribution represented by 16 logarithmically distributed radius intervals,\nand (2) radius distribution represented by a single grain species with averaged\noptical properties (reference). Within the considered parameter range, i.e., of\ngrain radii between 5 nm and 1 mm and an optically thin and thick disk with a\nparameterized density distribution, we obtain the following results: In\noptically thin disk regions, the temperature spread can be as large as ~63% and\nthe relative grain surface below a certain temperature is lower than in the\nreference disk. With increasing optical depth, the difference in the midplane\ntemperature and the relative grain surface below a certain temperature\ndecreases. Furthermore, below ~20K, this fraction is higher for the reference\ndisk than for the case of multiple grain radii, while it shows the opposite\nbehavior for temperatures above this threshold. The thermal emission in the\ncase of multiple grain radii at short wavelengths is stronger than for the\nreference disk. The freeze-out radius is a function of grain radius, spanning a\nradial range between the coldest and warmest grain species of ~30AU.\n", "  Using Spitzer photometry at 4.5 microns, we search for rings and satellites\naround the long period transiting planet CoRoT-9b. We observed two transits in\n2010 and 2011. From their non-detection, we derive upper limits on the\nplausible physical characteristics of these objects in the planet environment.\nWe show that a satellite larger than about 2.5 Earth radii is excluded at\n3-$\\sigma$ for a wide range of elongations at the two epochs of observations.\nCombining the two observations, we conclude that rings are excluded for a wide\nvariety of sizes and inclination. We find that for a ring extending up to the\nRoche limit, its inclination angle from the edge-on configuration as seen from\nthe Earth must be lower than 13{\\deg} in the case of silicate composition and\nlower than 3{\\deg} in the case of material with water ice density.\n", "  The GW Ori system is a pre-main sequence triple system (GW Ori A/B/C) with\ncompanions (GW Ori B/C) at $\\sim$1 AU and $\\sim$8 AU, respectively, from the\nprimary (GW Ori A). The primary of the system has a mass of 3.9 $M_{\\odot}$,\nbut shows a spectral type of G8. Thus, GW Ori A could be a precursor of a B\nstar, but it is still at an earlier evolutionary stage than Herbig Be stars. GW\nOri provides us an ideal target for experiments and observations (being a\n\"blown-up\" upscaled Solar System with a very massive \"sun\" and at least two\n\"upscaled planets\"). We present the first spatially-resolved millimeter\ninterferometric observations of the disk around the triple pre-main-sequence\nsystem GW Ori, obtained with the the Submillimeter Array, both in continuum and\nin the $^{12}{\\rm CO} J=2-1$, $^{13}{\\rm CO} J=2-1$, and ${\\rm C^{18}O} J=2-1$\nlines. These new data reveal a huge, massive, and bright disk in the GW Ori\nsystem. The dust continuum emission suggests a disk radius around 400 AU. But,\nthe $^{12}{\\rm CO} J=2-1$ emission shows much more extended disk with a size\naround 1300 AU. Due to the spatial resolution ($\\sim$1$\"$), we cannot detect\nthe gap in the disk which is inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED)\nmodeling. We characterize the dust and gas properties in the disk by comparing\nthe observations with the predictions from the disk models with various\nparameters calculated with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. The\ndisk mass is around 0.12 $M_{\\odot}$, and the disk inclination with respect to\nthe line of sight is around $\\sim$ 35$^\\circ$. The kinematics in the disk\ntraced by the CO line emission strongly suggest that the circumstellar material\nin the disk is in Keplerian rotation around GW Ori. Tentatively substantial\n${\\rm C^{18}O}$ depletion in gas phase is required to explain the\ncharacteristics of the line emission from the disk.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenon of spatial many-body localization (MBL) through\npairwise correlation measures based on one and two-point correlation functions.\nThe system considered is the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with exchange\ninteraction $J$ and random onsite disorder of strength $h$. As a representative\npairwise correlation measure obtained from one-point functions only, we use\nglobal entanglement. Through its finite size scaling analysis, we locate the\nMBL critical point at $h_{c}/J = 3.8$. As for measures involving two-point\nfunctions, we analyze pairwise geometric classical, quantum, and total\ncorrelations. Similarly to what happens for continuous quantum phase\ntransitions, it is the derivatives of these two-point correlation measures that\nidentify the MBL critical point, which is found to be in the range $h_{c}/J \\in\n\\left[3,4\\right]$. Our approach relies on very simple measures that do not\nrequire access to multipartite entanglement or large portions of the system.\n", "  We compare the two-dimensional (2D) plasmon dispersion relations for\nmonolayer graphene when the sample is doped with carriers in the conduction\nband and the temperature $T$ is zero with the case when the temperature is\nfinite and there is no doping. Additionally, we have obtained the plasmon\nexcitations when there is doping at finite temperature. The results were\nobtained in the random-phase approximation which employs energy electronic\nbands calculated using ab initio density functional theory. We found that in\nthe undoped case the finite temperature results in appearance in the low-energy\nregion of a 2D plasmon which is absent for the $T=0$ case. Its energy is\ngradually increased with increasing $T$. It is accompanied by expansion in the\nmomentum range where this mode is observed as well. The 2D plasmon dispersion\nin the $\\Gamma$M direction may differ in substantial ways from that along the\n$\\Gamma$K direction at sufficiently high temperature and doping concentrations.\nMoreover, at temperatures exceeding $\\approx300$ meV a second mode emerges\nalong the $\\Gamma$K direction at lower energies like it occurs at a doping\nlevel exceeding $\\approx 300$ meV. Once the temperature exceeds $\\approx 0.75$\neV this mode ceases to exit whereas the 2D plasmon exists as a well-defined\ncollective excitation up to $T=1.5$ eV, a maximal temperature investigated in\nthis work.\n", "  The spin Peltier effect (SPE), heat-current generation due to spin-current\ninjection, in various metal (Pt, W, and Au single layers and Pt/Cu\nbilayer)/ferrimagnetic insulator (yttrium iron garnet: YIG) junction systems\nhas been investigated by means of a lock-in thermography (LIT) method. The SPE\nis excited by a spin current across the metal/YIG interface, which is generated\nby applying a charge current to the metallic layer via the spin Hall effect.\nThe LIT method enables the thermal imaging of the SPE free from the\nJoule-heating contribution. Importantly, we observed spin-current-induced\ntemperature modulation not only in the Pt/YIG and W/YIG systems but also in the\nAu/YIG and Pt/Cu/YIG systems, excluding the possible contamination by anomalous\nEttingshausen effects due to proximity-induced ferromagnetism near the\nmetal/YIG interface. As demonstrated in our previous study, the SPE signals are\nconfined only in the vicinity of the metal/YIG interface; we buttress this\nconclusion by reducing a spatial blur due to thermal diffusion in an infrared\nemission layer on the sample surface used for the LIT measurements. We also\nfound that the YIG-thickness dependence of the SPE is similar to that of the\nspin Seebeck effect measured in the same Pt/YIG sample, implying the reciprocal\nrelation between them.\n", "  Context: According to numerical simulations, stars are not always kept at\ntheir birth galactocentric distances but migrate. The importance of this radial\nmigration in shaping galactic light distributions is still unclear. However, if\nit is indeed important, galaxies with different surface brightness (SB)\nprofiles must display differences in their stellar population properties. Aims:\nWe investigate the role of radial migration on the light distribution and the\nradial stellar content by comparing the inner colour, age and metallicity\ngradients for galaxies with different SB profiles. We define these inner parts\navoiding the bulge and bar regions and up to around three disc scale-lengths\n(type I, pure exponential) or the break radius (type II, downbending; type III,\nupbending). Methods: We analyse 214 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey\ncovering different SB profiles. We make use of GASP2D and SDSS data to\ncharacterise their light distribution and obtain colour profiles. The stellar\nage and metallicity profiles are computed using a methodology based on\nfull-spectrum fitting techniques (pPXF, GANDALF, and STECKMAP) to the IFS\nCALIFA data. Results: The distributions of the colour, stellar age and stellar\nmetallicity gradients in the inner parts for galaxies displaying different SB\nprofiles are unalike as suggested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling\ntests. We find a trend in which type II galaxies show the steepest profiles of\nall and type III the shallowest, with type I galaxies displaying an\nintermediate behaviour. Conclusions: These results are consistent with a\nscenario in which radial migration is more efficient for type III galaxies than\nfor type I systems with type II galaxies presenting the lowest radial migration\nefficiency. In such scenario, radial migration mixes the stellar content\nflattening the radial stellar properties and... [abriged]\n", "  Giant radio halos are Mpc-scale diffuse radio sources associated with the\ncentral regions of galaxy clusters. The most promising scenario to explain the\norigin of these sources is that of turbulent re-acceleration, in which MeV\nelectrons injected throughout the formation history of galaxy clusters are\naccelerated to higher energies by turbulent motions mostly induced by cluster\nmergers. In this Letter, we use the amplitude of density fluctuations in the\nintracluster medium as a proxy for the turbulent velocity and apply this\ntechnique to a sample of 51 clusters with available radio data. Our results\nindicate a segregation in the turbulent velocity of radio halo and radio quiet\nclusters, with the turbulent velocity of the former being on average higher by\nabout a factor of two. The velocity dispersion recovered with this technique\ncorrelates with the measured radio power through the relation $P_{\\rm\nradio}\\propto\\sigma_v^{3.3\\pm0.7}$, which implies that the radio power is\nnearly proportional to the turbulent energy rate. Our results provide an\nobservational confirmation of a key prediction of the turbulent re-acceleration\nmodel and possibly shed light on the origin of radio halos.\n", "  We report a sample of 463 high-mass starless clump (HMSC) candidates within\n$-60\\deg<l<60\\deg$ and $-1\\deg<b<1\\deg$. This sample has been singled out from\n10861 ATLASGAL clumps. All of these sources are not associated with any known\nstar-forming activities collected in SIMBAD and young stellar objects\nidentified using color-based criteria. We also make sure that the HMSC\ncandidates have neither point sources at 24 and 70 \\micron~nor strong extended\nemission at 24 $\\mu$m. Most of the identified HMSCs are infrared ($\\le24$\n$\\mu$m) dark and some are even dark at 70 $\\mu$m. Their distribution shows\ncrowding in Galactic spiral arms and toward the Galactic center and some\nwell-known star-forming complexes. Many HMSCs are associated with large-scale\nfilaments. Some basic parameters were attained from column density and dust\ntemperature maps constructed via fitting far-infrared and submillimeter\ncontinuum data to modified blackbodies. The HMSC candidates have sizes, masses,\nand densities similar to clumps associated with Class II methanol masers and\nHII regions, suggesting they will evolve into star-forming clumps. More than\n90% of the HMSC candidates have densities above some proposed thresholds for\nforming high-mass stars. With dust temperatures and luminosity-to-mass ratios\nsignificantly lower than that for star-forming sources, the HMSC candidates are\nexternally heated and genuinely at very early stages of high-mass star\nformation. Twenty sources with equivalent radius $r_\\mathrm{eq}<0.15$ pc and\nmass surface density $\\Sigma>0.08$ g cm$^{-2}$ could be possible high-mass\nstarless cores. Further investigations toward these HMSCs would undoubtedly\nshed light on comprehensively understanding the birth of high-mass stars.\n", "  Recently, there has been much interest in using lubricated flat and\nnano-/micro-structured surfaces to achieve extreme liquid-repellency: any\nforeign droplet immiscible with the underlying lubricant layer was shown to\nslide off at a small tilt angle $<$ 5$^{\\circ}$. This behavior was hypothesized\nto arise from a thin lubricant overlayer film sandwiched between the droplet\nand solid substrate, but this has not been observed experimentally. Here, using\nconfocal optical interferometry, we are able to visualize the intercalated film\nunder both static and dynamic conditions. We further demonstrate that the\nlubricant flow entrained by droplet motion can transform a partially dewetted\nfilm into a continuous layer, by generating a sufficient hydrodynamic force to\nlift the droplet over the solid substrate. The droplet is therefore\noleoplaning, akin to tires hydroplaning on a wet road, with minimal dissipative\nforce (down to 0.1 $\\mu$N for 1 $\\mu$l droplet when measured using a cantilever\nforce sensor) and no contact line pinning. The techniques and insights\npresented in this study will inform future work on the fundamentals of wetting\nfor lubricated surfaces and enable their rational design.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the discriminatory power of the matrix element\nmethod (MEM) in constraining the $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ model at the LHC. The $Z'$\ngauge boson associated with the spontaneously broken $U(1)_{L_\\mu-L_\\tau}$\nsymmetry only interacts with the second and third generation of leptons at tree\nlevel, and is thus difficult to produce at the LHC. We argue that the best\nchannels for discovering this $Z'$ are in $Z \\to 4\\mu$ and\n$2\\mu+\\displaystyle{\\not}E_T$. Both these channels have a large number of\nkinematic observables, which strongly motivates the usage of a multivariate\ntechnique. The MEM is a multivariate analysis that uses the squared matrix\nelement to quantify the likelihood of the testing hypotheses. We find that with\n$300 \\, \\text{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, we are sensitive to the\ncouplings of $ g_{Z'} \\gtrsim 0.002 ~ g_1$ and $M_{Z'} < 20 \\text{ GeV}$, and\n$g_{Z'} \\gtrsim 0.005 g_1$ and $20\\, \\text{GeV} <M_{Z'} < 40 ~ \\text{GeV}$,\nwhich is about an order of magnitude improvement over the cut-and-count method\nfor the same amount of data.\n", "  We theoretically investigate normal-state properties of a gas mixture of\nsingle-component bosons and fermions with a hetero-nuclear Feshbach resonance.\nIncluding strong hetero-pairing fluctuations associated with the Feshbach\nresonance, we calculate single-particle density of states, as well as the\nspectral weight at various interaction strengths. For this purpose, we employ\nan improved T-matrix approximation (TMA), where the bare Bose Green's function\nin the non-selfconsistent TMA self-energy is modified so as to satisfy the\nHugenholtz-Pines relation at the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) temperature\n$T_{\\rm BEC}$. In the unitary regime at $T_{\\rm BEC}$, we show that\nhetero-pairing fluctuations couple Fermi atomic excitations with Fermi\nmolecular excitations, as well as with Bose atomic excitations. Although a\nsimilar coupling phenomenon by pairing fluctuations is known to give a\npseudo-gapped density of states in the unitary regime of a two-component Fermi\ngas, such a dip structure is found to not appear even in the unitary limit of a\nBose-Fermi mixture. It only appears in the strong-coupling regime. Instead, a\nspectral peak along the molecular dispersion appears in the spectral weight.We\nalso clarify how this coupling phenomenon is seen in the Bose channel. Since a\nhetero-nuclear Feshbach resonance, as well as the formation of Bose-Fermi\nmolecules, have been realized, our results would be useful for the study of\nstrong-coupling properties of this unique quantum gas.\n", "  The Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the {\\em Spitzer Space Telescope} observed\nnearly 800 point sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), taking over 1,000\nspectra. 197 of these targets were observed as part of the Sage-Spec Spitzer\nLegacy program; the remainder are from a variety of different calibration,\nguaranteed time and open time projects. We classify these point sources into\ntypes according to their infrared spectral features, continuum and spectral\nenergy distribution shape, bolometric luminosity, cluster membership, and\nvariability information, using a decision-tree classification method. We then\nrefine the classification using supplementary information from the\nastrophysical literature. We find that our IRS sample is comprised\nsubstantially of YSO and H\\,{\\sc ii} regions, post-Main Sequence low-mass\nstars: (post-)AGB stars and planetary nebulae and massive stars including\nseveral rare evolutionary types. Two supernova remnants, a nova and several\nbackground galaxies were also observed. We use these classifications to improve\nour understanding of the stellar populations in the Large Magellanic Cloud,\nstudy the composition and characteristics of dust species in a variety of LMC\nobjects, and to verify the photometric classification methods used by mid-IR\nsurveys. We discover that some widely-used catalogues of objects contain\nconsiderable contamination and others are missing sources in our sample.\n", "  We investigate roles of electron correlation effects in the determination of\nthe $g_j$ factors of the $4s ~ ^2S_{1/2}$, $4p ~ ^2P_{1/2}$, $4p ~ ^2P_{3/2}$,\n$3d ~ ^2D_{3/2}$, and $3d ~ ^2D_{5/2}$ states, representing to different\nparities and angular momenta, of the Ca$^+$ ion. Correlation contributions are\nhighlighted with respect to the mean-field values evaluated using the\nDirac-Hartree-Fock method, relativistic second order many-body theory, and\nrelativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory with the singles and doubles\napproximation considering only the linear terms and also accounting for all the\nnon-linear terms. This shows that it is difficult to achieve reasonably\naccurate results employing an approximated perturbative approach. We also find\nthat contributions through the non-linear terms and higher-level excitations\nsuch as triple excitations, estimated perturbatively in the RCC method, are\nfound to be crucial to attain precise values of the $g_j$ factors in the\nconsidered states of Ca$^+$ ion.\n", "  We present a synchrotron-based X-ray scattering technique which allows\ndisentangling magnetic properties of heterogeneous systems with nanopatterned\nsurfaces. This technique combines the nmrange spatial resolution of surface\nmorphology features provided by Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering\nand the high sensitivity of Nuclear Resonant Scattering to magnetic order. A\nsingle experiment thus allows attributing magnetic properties to structural\nfeatures of the sample; chemical and structural properties may be correlated\nanalogously. We demonstrate how this technique shows the correlation between\nstructural growth and evolution of magnetic properties for the case of a\nremarkable magnetization reversal in a structurally and magnetically\nnanopatterned sample system.\n", "  In this work we study the charge-exchange reaction to Isobaric Analog State\nusing two types of transition densities. We show that for projectiles that do\nnot probe the interior of the nucleus but mostly the surface of this nucleus,\ndistinct differences in the cross-section arise when the two types of\ntransition densities are employed. We demonstrate this by considering the\n(3He,t) reaction.\n", "  An empirical model of the concentration dependence of the excess Gibbs free\nenergy Gex for saline solutions is proposed. Our simple analytical form of Gex\nallows obtaining equations of state of saline solutions equally precise in the\nwhole range of the salt concentrations, from dilute solutions up to the limit\nof solubility. Our equation for Gex includes one term responsible for\nconcentration dependence of Gex at low salt concentrations and two terms of\nMargules type dependent on powers of mole fractions of the components. These\nterms contain four parameters dependent on temperature and pressure. As an\nexample of application of the proposed model we took the system H2O-NaCl. For\nfixed T and P, our four-parameter form of Gex allows precisely reproduce\nexperimental data for NaCl water solutions, including both regions of low and\nhigh concentrations. An introduction of temperature dependence of the\nparameters allowed us to build a precise analytic fit of experimental data on\nosmotic coefficients of NaCl solutions for saturation pressures of NaCl at\ntemperatures 423.15K-573.15K. On the basis of PVTx data by Driesner (2007) the\nmodel was extended towards pressures up to 5kbar. Our form of Gex allows\nobtaining the molar volumes, activities of components and other thermodynamic\nproperties of NaCl-H2O solutions in the range of temperatures 423.15K-573.15K\nand pressures from saturation up to 5kbar in the whole range of concentrations\npossible for H2O-NaCl solutions (from zero up to approximately 10 molal at\n573.15K).\n", "  Background: At the forefront of the nuclear science, production of new\nneutron-rich isotopes is continuously pursued at accelerator laboratories all\nover the world. To explore the currently-unknown territories in the nuclear\nchart far away from the stability, reliable theoretical predictions are\ninevitable.\n  Purpose: To provide a reliable prediction of production cross sections taking\ninto account secondary deexcitation processes, both particle evaporation and\nfission, a new method called TDHF+GEMINI is proposed, which combines the\nmicroscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory with a sophisticated\nstatistical compound-nucleus deexcitation model, GEMINI++.\n  Results: The method is applied for multinucleon transfer processes in\nlow-energy heavy ion reactions. It is shown that the inclusion of secondary\ndeexcitation processes, which are dominated by neutron evaporation in the\npresent systems, substantially improves agreement with the experimental data.\nThe magnitude of the evaporation effects is very similar to the one observed in\nGRAZING calculations. TDHF+GEMINI provides better description of the absolute\nvalue of the cross sections for channels involving transfer of more than one\nprotons, compared with the GRAZING results. However, there remain discrepancies\nbetween the measurements and the calculated cross sections, indicating a limit\nof the theoretical framework that works with a single mean-field potential.\nPossible causes of the discrepancies are discussed.\n  Conclusions: In order to perfectly reproduce experimental cross sections for\nmultinucleon transfer processes, one should go beyond the standard\nself-consistent mean-field description. Nevertheless, the proposed method will\nprovide valuable information to optimize production mechanisms of new\nneutron-rich nuclei through its microscopic, non-empirical predictions.\n  (Shortened due to the word limit)\n", "  We study a squeezed vacuum field generated in hot Rb vapor via the\npolarization self-rotation effect. Our previous experiments showed that the\namount of observed squeezing may be limited by the contamination of the\nsqueezed vacuum output with higher-order spatial modes, also generated inside\nthe cell. Here, we demonstrate that the squeezing can be improved by making the\nlight interact several times with a less dense atomic ensemble. With\noptimization of some parameters we can achieve up to -2.6 dB of squeezing in\nthe multi-pass case, which is 0.6 dB improvement compared to the single-pass\nexperimental configuration. Our results show that other than the optical depth\nof the medium, the spatial mode structure and cell configuration also affect\nthe squeezing level.\n", "  Star formation rate (SFR) distributions of galaxies are often assumed to be\nbimodal with modes corresponding to star-forming and quiescent galaxies,\nrespectively. Both classes of galaxies are typically studied separately and SFR\ndistributions of star-forming galaxies are commonly modelled as lognormals.\nUsing both observational data and results from numerical simulations, I argue\nthat this division into star-forming and quiescent galaxies is unnecessary from\na theoretical point of view and that the SFR distributions of the whole\npopulation can be well fit by zero-inflated negative binomial distributions.\nThis family of distributions has 3 parameters that determine the average SFR of\nthe galaxies in the sample, the scatter relative to the star-forming sequence,\nand the fraction of galaxies with zero SFRs, respectively. The proposed\ndistributions naturally account for (i) the discrete nature of star formation,\n(ii) the presence of 'dead' galaxies with zero SFRs, and (iii) asymmetric\nscatter. Excluding 'dead' galaxies, the distribution of log SFR is unimodal\nwith a peak at the star forming sequence and an extended tail towards low SFRs.\nHowever, uncertainties and biases in the SFR measurements can create the\nappearance of a bimodal distribution.\n", "  We study a series of X-ray-bright, rapidly-evolving active-region coronal\njets outside the leading sunspot of AR 12259, using Hinode/XRT, SDO/AIA and\nHMI, and IRIS data. The detailed evolution of such rapidly evolving \"violent\"\njets remained a mystery after our previous investigation of active region jets\n(Sterling et al. 2016, Paper 1). The jets we investigate here erupt from three\nlocalized subregions, each containing a rapidly evolving (positive)\nminority-polarity magnetic-flux patch bathed in a (majority) negative-polarity\nmagnetic-flux background. At least several of the jets begin with eruptions of\nwhat appear to be thin (thickness <~2\") miniature-filament (minifilament)\n\"strands\" from a magnetic neutral line where magnetic flux cancelation is\nongoing, consistent with the magnetic configuration presented for coronal-hole\njets in Sterling et al. (2015). Some jets strands are difficult/impossible to\ndetect, perhaps due to, e.g. their thinness, obscuration by surrounding bright\nor dark features, or the absence of erupting cool-material minifilaments in\nthose jets. Tracing in detail the flux evolution in one of the subregions, we\nfind bursts of strong jetting occurring only during times of strong flux\ncancelation. Averaged over seven jetting episodes, the cancelation rate was\n~1.5x10^19 Mx/hr. An average flux of ~5x10^18 Mx canceled prior to each\nepisode, arguably building up ~10^28 - 10^29 ergs of free magnetic energy per\njet. From these and previous observations, we infer that flux cancelation is\nthe fundamental process responsible for the pre-eruption buildup and triggering\nof at least many jets in active regions, quiet regions, and coronal holes.\n", "  The accretion-powered X-ray pulsar 4U 1626--67 is one of the few highly\nmagnetized pulsars that accretes through Roche-lobe overflow from a low-mass\ncompanion. The characteristics of its broadband spectrum are similar to those\nof X-ray pulsars hosted in a high-mass X-ray binary systems, with a broad\nresonant cyclotron scattering feature (CRSF) at $\\sim$37 keV. In this work, we\nexamine the pulse-resolved and the pulse-averaged broadband spectrum using data\nfrom NuSTAR and Swift. We use the Becker & Wolff model of bulk+thermal\nComptonization to infer key physical parameters of the accretion column flow\nand a broadband model for the disk reflected spectrum. In the softer X-ray\nband, we need to add a soft black-body component with $kT_{\\rm bb}$ $\\sim$0.5\nkeV, whose characteristics indicate a possible origin from the neutron star\nsurface. Residuals suggest that the shape of the cyclotron line could be more\nsatisfactorily fitted using a narrow core and broader wings and, at higher\nenergies, a second harmonic could be present at $\\sim$61 keV.\n", "  If dark photons are massless, they couple to standard-model particles only\nvia higher dimensional operators, while the kinetic mixing with photons, which\nmotivates most of the current experimental searches, is absent. We consider the\neffect of possible flavor-changing magnetic-dipole couplings of massless dark\nphotons in kaon physics. In particular, we study the branching ratio for the\nprocess $K^+\\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^0 \\bar \\gamma$ with a simplified-model\napproach, assuming the chiral quark model to evaluate the hadronic matrix\nelement. Possible effects in the $K^0$-$\\bar K^0$ mixing are taken into\naccount. We find that branching ratios up to $O(10^{-7})$ are\nallowed---depending on the dark-sector masses and couplings. Such large\nbranching ratios for $K^+\\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^0 \\bar \\gamma$ could be of\ninterest for experiments dedicated to rare $K^+$ decays like NA62 at CERN,\nwhere $\\bar \\gamma$ can be detected as a massless invisible system.\n", "  We use Ca doping during growth of one and two monolayer thick MgO films on\nAg(100) to identify the adsorption sites of individual adatoms with scanning\ntunneling microscopy. For this we combine atomic resolution images of the bare\nMgO layer with images of the adsorbates and the substitutional Ca atoms taken\nat larger tip-sample distance. For Ho atoms, the adsorption sites depend on MgO\nthickness. On the monolayer, they are distributed on the O and bridge sites\naccording to the abundance of those sites, 1/3 and 2/3 respectively. On the MgO\nbilayer, Ho atoms populate almost exclusively the O site. A third species\nadsorbed on Mg is predicted by density functional theory and can be created by\natomic manipulation. Au atoms adsorb on the bridge sites for both MgO\nthicknesses, while Co and Fe atoms prefer the O sites, again for both\nthickness.\n", "  The decay of field-free rotational dynamics is experimentally studied in two\ncomplementary methods: laser-induced molecular alignment and\nterahertz-field-induced molecular orientation. Comparison between the decay\nrates of different molecular species at various gas pressures reveals that\noriented molecular ensembles decay faster than aligned ensembles. The\ndiscrepancy in decay rates is attributed to the coherent radiation emitted by\nthe transiently oriented ensembles and is absent from aligned molecules. The\nexperimental results reveal the dramatic contribution of coherent radiative\nemission to the observed decay of rotational dynamics and underline a general\nphenomenon expected whenever field-free coherent dipole oscillations are\ninduced.\n", "  The extraordinary energetic activity of magnetars is usually explained in\nterms of dissipation of a huge internal magnetic field of the order of\n$10^{15-16}$G. How such a strong magnetic field can originate during the\nformation of a neutron star is still subject of active research. An important\nrole can be played by fast rotation: if magnetars are born as millisecond\nrotators dynamo mechanisms may efficiently amplify the magnetic field inherited\nfrom the progenitor star during the collapse. In this case, the combination of\nrapid rotation and strong magnetic field determine the right physical condition\nnot only for the development of a powerful jet driven explosion, manifesting as\na gamma ray burst, but also for a copious gravitational waves emission. Strong\nmagnetic fields are indeed able to induce substantial quadrupolar deformations\nin the star. In this paper we analyze the joint effect of rotation and\nmagnetization on the structure of a polytropic and axisymmetric neutron star,\nwithin the ideal magneto-hydrodynamic regime. We will consider either purely\ntoroidal or purely poloidal magnetic field geometries. Through the sampling of\na large parameter space, we generalize previous results in literature,\ninferring new quantitative relations that allow for a parametrization of the\ninduced deformation, that takes into account also the effects due to the\nstellar compactness and the current distribution. Finally, in the case of\npurely poloidal field, we also discuss how different prescriptions on the\nsurface charge distribution (a gauge freedom) modify the properties of the\nsurrounding electrosphere and its physical implications.\n", "  Episodic accretion is an important process in the evolution of young stars\nand their environment. The observed strong luminosity bursts of young stellar\nobjects likely have a long lasting impact on the chemical evolution of the disk\nand envelope structure. We want to investigate observational signatures of the\nchemical evolution in the post-burst phase for embedded sources. With such\nsignatures it is possible to identify targets that experienced a recent\nluminosity burst. We present a new model for episodic accretion chemistry based\non the 2D, radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo. We have extended\nProDiMo with a proper treatment for envelope structures. For a representative\nClass I model, we calculated the chemical abundances in the post-burst phase\nand produced synthetic observables like intensity maps and radial profiles.\nDuring a burst many chemical species, like CO, sublimate from the dust\nsurfaces. As the burst ends they freeze out again (post-burst phase). This\nfreeze-out happens from inside-out due to the radial density gradient in the\ndisk and envelope structure. This inside-out freeze-out produces clear\nobservational signatures in spectral line emission, like rings and distinct\nfeatures in the slope of radial intensity profiles. We fitted synthetic C18O\nJ=2-1 observations with single and two component fits and find that post-burst\nimages are much better matched by the latter. Comparing the quality of such\nfits allows identification of post-burst targets in a model-independent way.\nOur models confirm that it is possible to identify post-burst objects from\nspatially resolved CO observations. However, to derive proper statistics, like\nfrequencies of bursts, from observations it is important to consider aspects\nlike the inclination and structure of the target and also dust properties as\nthose have a significant impact on the freeze-out timescale.\n", "  Evidence for the presence of high energy magnetic excitations in overdoped\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) has raised questions regarding the role of\nspin-fluctuations in the pairing mechanism. If they remain present in overdoped\nLSCO, why does $T_c$ decrease in this doping regime? Here, using results for\nthe dynamic spin susceptibility ${\\rm Im}\\chi(q,\\omega)$ obtained from a\ndeterminantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculation for the Hubbard model we\naddress this question. We find that while high energy magnetic excitations\npersist in the overdoped regime, they lack the momentum to scatter pairs\nbetween the anti-nodal regions. It is the decrease in the spectral weight at\nlarge momentum transfer, not observed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\n(RIXS), which leads to a reduction in the $d$-wave spin-fluctuation pairing\nstrength.\n", "  We calculate the Casimir force and its gradient between a spherical and a\nplanar gold surface. Significant numerical improvements allow us to extend the\nrange of accessible parameters into the experimental regime. We compare our\nnumerically exact results with those obtained within the proximity force\napproximation (PFA) employed in the analysis of all Casimir force experiments\nreported in the literature so far. Special attention is paid to the difference\nbetween the Drude model and the dissipationless plasma model at zero frequency.\nIt is found that the correction to PFA is too small to explain the discrepancy\nbetween the experimental data and the PFA result based on the Drude model.\nHowever, it turns out that for the plasma model, the corrections to PFA lie\nwell outside the experimental bound obtained by probing the variation of the\nforce gradient with the sphere radius [D. E. Krause et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n98, 050403 (2007)]. The corresponding corrections based on the Drude model are\nsignificantly smaller but still in violation of the experimental bound for\nsmall distances between plane and sphere.\n", "  We present mid-infrared observations for a sample of 16 O-type stars. The\ndata were acquired with the NASA Spitzer Space Telescope, using the IRS\ninstrument at moderate resolution (R $\\sim$ 600), covering the range $\\sim\n10-37$ microns. Our sample includes early, mid and late O supergiants and\ndwarfs. We explore for the first time their mid-IR spectral morphology in a\nquantitative way. We use NLTE expanding atmosphere models to help with line\nidentifications, analyze profile contributions and line-formation regions. The\nO supergiants present a rich emission line spectra. The most intense features\nare from hydrogen - $6\\alpha$, 7$\\alpha$, and $8\\alpha$ - which have\nnon-negligible contributions of HeI or HeII lines, depending on the spectral\ntype. The spectrum of early O supergiants is a composite of HI and HeII lines,\nHeI lines being absent. On the other hand, late O supergiants present features\ncomposed mainly by HI and HeI lines. All emission lines are formed throughout\nthe stellar wind. We found that O dwarfs exhibit a featureless mid-IR spectrum.\nTwo stars of our sample exhibit very similar mid-IR features, despite having a\nvery different optical spectral classification. The analysis of O-type stars\nbased on mid-IR spectra alone to infer spectral classes or to estimate physical\nparameters may thus be prone to substantial errors. Our results may therefore\ninform spectroscopic observations of massive stars located in heavily obscured\nregions and help establish an initial framework for observations of massive\nstars using the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  During the transition from the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) to Planetary\nNebulae (PN), the circumstellar geometry and morphology change dramatically.\nAnother characteristic of this transition is the high mass loss rate, that can\nbe partially explained by radiation pressure and a combination of various\nfactors like the stellar pulsation, the dust grain condensation and opacity in\nthe upper atmosphere. The magnetic field can also be one of the main\ningredients that shapes the stellar upper atmosphere and envelope. Our main\ngoal is to investigate for the first time the spatial distribution of the\nmagnetic field in the envelope of IRC+10216. More generally we intend to\ndetermine the magnetic field strength in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of\nC-rich evolved stars, compare this field with previous studies for O-rich\nstars, and constrain the variation of the magnetic field with r the distance to\nthe star's center. We use spectropolarimetric observations of the Stokes V\nparameter, collected with Xpol on the IRAM-30m radiotelescope, observing the\nZeeman effect in seven hyperfine components of the CN J = 1-0 line. We use\nCrutcher's method to estimate the magnetic field. For C-rich evolved stars, we\nderive a magnetic field strength (B) between 1.6 and 14.2 mG while B is\nestimated to be 6 mG for the proto-PN (PPN) AFGL618, and an upper value of 8 mG\nis found for the PN NGC7027. These results are consistent with a decrease of B\nas 1/r in the environment of AGB objects, i.e., with the presence of a toroidal\nfield. But this is not the case for PPN and PN stars. Our map of IRC+10216\nsuggests that the magnetic field is not homogeneously strong throughout or\naligned with the envelope and that the morphology of the CN emission might have\nchanged with time.\n", "  We analyze the Galileon ghost condensate implementation of a bouncing\ncosmological model in the presence of a non negligible anisotropic stress. We\nexhibit its structure, which we find to be far richer than previously thought.\nIn particular, even restricting attention to a single set of underlying\nmicroscopic parameters, we obtain, numerically, many qualitatively different\nregimes: depending on the initial conditions on the scalar field leading the\ndynamics of the universe, the contraction phase can evolve directly towards a\nsingularity, avoid it by bouncing once, or even bounce many times before\nsettling into an ever-expanding phase. We clarify the behavior of the\nanisotropies in these various situations.\n", "  We investigate the observational signatures of super-Earths (i.e.,\nEarth-to-Neptune mass planets) in their natal disks of gas and dust. Combining\ntwo-fluid global hydrodynamics simulations with a radiative transfer code, we\ncalculate the distributions of gas and of sub-mm-sized dust in a disk perturbed\nby a super-Earth, synthesizing images in near-infrared scattered light and the\nmm-wave thermal continuum for direct comparison with observations. In low\nviscosity gas ($\\alpha\\lesssim10^{-4}$), a super-Earth opens two annular gaps\nto either side of its orbit by the action of Lindblad torques. This double gap\nand its associated gas pressure gradients cause dust particles to be dragged by\ngas into three rings: one ring sandwiched between the two gaps, and two rings\nlocated at the gap edges farthest from the planet. Depending on system\nparameters, additional rings may manifest for a single planet. A double gap\nlocated at tens of AUs from a host star in Taurus can be detected in the dust\ncontinuum by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) at an angular resolution\nof ~0\".03 after two hours of integration. Ring and gap features persist in a\nvariety of background disk profiles, last for thousands of orbits, and change\ntheir relative positions and dimensions depending on the speed and direction of\nplanet migration. Candidate double gaps have been observed by ALMA in systems\nlike HL Tau (D5 and D6) and TW Hya (at 37 and 43 AU); we submit that each\ndouble gap is carved by one super-Earth in nearly inviscid gas.\n", "  Exoplanet host star activity, in the form of unocculted star spots or\nfaculae, alters the observed transmission and emission spectra of the\nexoplanet. This effect can be exacerbated when combining data from different\nepochs if the stellar photosphere varies between observations due to activity.\nredHere we present a method to characterize and correct for relative changes\ndue to stellar activity by exploiting multi-epoch ($\\ge$2 visits/transits)\nobservations to place them in a consistent reference frame. Using measurements\nfrom portions of the planet's orbit where negligible planet transmission or\nemission can be assumed, we determine changes to the stellar spectral\namplitude. With the analytical methods described here, we predict the impact of\nstellar variability on transit observations. Supplementing these forecasts with\nKepler-measured stellar variabilities for F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarfs, and\npredicted transit precisions by JWST's NIRISS, NIRCam, and MIRI, we conclude\nthat stellar activity does not impact infrared transiting exoplanet\nobservations of most presently-known or predicted TESS targets by current or\nnear-future platforms, such as JWST.\n", "  We study the first year of the eBOSS quasar sample in the redshift range\n$0.9<z<2.2$ which includes 68,772 homogeneously selected quasars. We show that\nthe main source of systematics in the evaluation of the correlation function\narises from inhomogeneities in the quasar target selection, particularly\nrelated to the extinction and depth of the imaging data used for targeting. We\npropose a weighting scheme that mitigates these systematics. We measure the\nquasar correlation function and provide the most accurate measurement to date\nof the quasar bias in this redshift range, $b_Q = 2.45 \\pm 0.05$ at $\\bar\nz=1.55$, together with its evolution with redshift. We use this information to\ndetermine the minimum mass of the halo hosting the quasars and the\ncharacteristic halo mass, which we find to be both independent of redshift\nwithin statistical error. Using a recently-measured quasar-luminosity-function\nwe also determine the quasar duty cycle. The size of this first year sample is\ninsufficient to detect any luminosity dependence to quasar clustering and this\nissue should be further studied with the final $\\sim$500,000 eBOSS quasar\nsample.\n", "  AGN feedback is now widely believed to play a crucial role in the\nco-evolution between the central black hole and its host galaxy. Two feedback\nmodes have been identified, namely the radiative and kinetic modes, which\ncorrespond to the luminous AGNs and low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), respectively.\nIn this paper, we investigate the radiative heating in the kinetic mode. This\nprocess is potentially important because: 1) the radiation power of LLAGNs is\nhigher than the jet power over a wide parameter range, 2) the spectral energy\ndistribution of LLAGNs is such that the radiative heating is more effective\ncompared to that of luminous AGNs with the same luminosity, and 3) most of the\ntime in the lifecycle of an AGN is spent in the LLAGNs phase. In this paper,\nadopting the characteristic broad-band spectral energy distributions of LLAGNs,\nwe calculate the value of \"Compton temperature\" ($T_{\\rm c}$), which determines\nthe radiative heating by Compton scattering. We find that $T_{\\rm c}\\sim\n(5-15)\\times 10^7$ K, depending on the spectrum of individual LLAGN and at\nwhich distance from the black hole we evaluate the heating. We also compare\nthis heating process with other radiative heating and cooling processes such as\nphotoionization/recombination. Our result can be used for an accurate\ncalculation of the radiative heating in the study of AGN feedback.\n", "  Targeted searches for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), with separations 1\n-- 10 kpc, have yielded relatively few successes. A recent pilot survey by\nSatyapal et al. has demonstrated that mid-infrared (mid-IR) pre-selection has\nthe potential to significantly improve the success rate for dual AGN\nconfirmation in late stage galaxy mergers. In this paper, we combine mid-IR\nselection with spatially resolved optical AGN diagnostics from the Mapping\nNearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey to identify a\ncandidate dual AGN in the late stage major galaxy merger SDSS\nJ140737.17+442856.2 at z=0.143. The nature of the dual AGN is confirmed with\nChandra X-ray observations that identify two hard X-ray point sources with\nintrinsic (corrected for absorption) 2-10 keV luminosities of 4*10^41 and\n3.5*10^43 erg/s separated by 8.3 kpc. The neutral hydrogen absorption (~10^22\ncm^-2) towards the two AGN is lower than in duals selected solely on their\nmid-IR colours, indicating that strategies that combine optical and mid-IR\ndiagnostics may complement techniques that identify the highly obscured dual\nphase, such as at high X-ray energies or mid-IR only.\n", "  As a fundamental process converting magnetic to plasma energy in high-energy\nastrophysical plasmas, relativistic magnetic reconnection is a leading\nexplanation for the acceleration of particles to the ultrarelativistic energies\nnecessary to power nonthermal emission (especially X-rays and gamma-rays) in\npulsar magnetospheres and pulsar wind nebulae, coronae and jets of accreting\nblack holes, and gamma-ray bursts. An important objective of plasma\nastrophysics is therefore the characterization of nonthermal particle\nacceleration (NTPA) effected by reconnection. Reconnection-powered NTPA has\nbeen demonstrated over a wide range of physical conditions using large\ntwo-dimensional (2D) kinetic simulations. However, its robustness in realistic\n3D reconnection -- in particular, whether the 3D relativistic drift-kink\ninstability (RDKI) disrupts NTPA -- has not been systematically investigated,\nalthough pioneering 3D simulations have observed NTPA in isolated cases. Here\nwe present the first comprehensive study of NTPA in 3D relativistic\nreconnection in collisionless electron-positron plasmas, characterizing NTPA as\nthe strength of 3D effects is varied systematically via the length in the third\ndimension and the strength of the guide magnetic field. We find that, while the\nRDKI prominently perturbs 3D reconnecting current sheets, it does not suppress\nparticle acceleration, even for zero guide field; fully 3D reconnection\nrobustly and efficiently produces nonthermal power-law particle spectra closely\nresembling those obtained in 2D. This finding provides strong support for\nreconnection as the key mechanism powering high-energy flares in various\nastrophysical systems. We also show that strong guide fields significantly\ninhibit NTPA, slowing reconnection and limiting the energy available for plasma\nenergization, yielding steeper and shorter power-law spectra.\n", "  A candidate for converting quantum information from microwave to optical\nfrequencies is the use of a single atom that interacts with a superconducting\nmicrowave resonator on one hand and an optical cavity on the other. The large\nelectric dipole moments and microwave transition frequencies possessed by\nRydberg states allow them to couple strongly to superconducting devices. Lasers\ncan then be used to connect a Rydberg transition to an optical transition to\nrealize the conversion. Since the fundamental source of noise in this process\nis spontaneous emission from the atomic levels, the resulting control problem\ninvolves choosing the pulse shapes of the driving lasers so as to maximize the\ntransfer rate while minimizing this loss. Here we consider the concrete example\nof a cesium atom, along with two specific choices for the levels to be used in\nthe conversion cycle. Under the assumption that spontaneous emission is the\nonly significant source of errors, we use numerical optimization to determine\nthe likely rates for reliable quantum communication that could be achieved with\nthis device. These rates are on the order of a few Mega-qubits per second.\n", "  Dwarf galaxies, among the most dark matter dominated structures of our\nuniverse, are excellent test-beds for dark matter theories. Unfortunately, mass\nmodelling of these systems suffers from the well documented mass-velocity\nanisotropy degeneracy. For the case of spherically symmetric systems, we\ndescribe a method for non-parametric modelling of the radial and tangential\nvelocity moments. The method is a numerical velocity anisotropy \"inversion\",\nwith parametric mass models, where the radial velocity dispersion profile,\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rr}}^2$ is modeled as a B-spline, and the optimization is a\nthree step process that consists of: (i) an Evolutionary modelling to determine\nthe mass model form and the best B-spline basis to represent\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rr}}^2$; (ii) an optimization of the smoothing parameters;\n(iii) a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis to determine the physical parameters.\nThe mass-anisotropy degeneracy is reduced into mass model inference,\nirrespective of kinematics. We test our method using synthetic data. Our\nalgorithm constructs the best kinematic profile and discriminates between\ncompeting dark matter models. We apply our method to the Fornax dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy. Using a King brightness profile and testing various dark\nmatter mass models, our model inference favours a simple mass-follows-light\nsystem. We find that the anisotropy profile of Fornax is tangential ($\\beta(r)\n< 0$) and we estimate a total mass of $M_{\\text{tot}} = 1.613\n^{+0.050}_{-0.075} \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{M}_{\\odot}$, and a mass-to-light ratio\nof $\\Upsilon_V = 8.93 ^{+0.32}_{-0.47} \\, (\\text{M}_{\\odot}/\\text{L}_{\\odot})$.\nThe algorithm we present is a robust and computationally inexpensive method for\nnon-parametric modelling of spherical clusters independent of the\nmass-anisotropy degeneracy.\n", "  A new mechanism for reactivity of multiply twinned gold nanoparticles\nresulting from their inherently strained structure provides a further\nexplanation of the surprising catalytic activity of small gold nanoparticles.\nAtomic defect structural studies of surface strains and quantitative analysis\nof atomic column displacements in the decahedral structure observed by\naberration corrected transmission electron microscopy reveal an average\nexpansion of surface nearest neighbor distances of 5.6 percent, with many\nstrained by more than 10 percent. Density functional theory calculations of the\nresulting modified gold d-band states predict significantly enhanced activity\nfor carbon monoxide oxidation. The new insights have important implications for\nthe applications of nanoparticles in chemical process technology, including for\nheterogeneous catalysis.\n", "  The ratio of the [CII] 158$\\,\\mu$m emission line over the total infrared\nemission (TIR) is often used as a proxy for the photoelectric (PE) heating\nefficiency ($\\epsilon_{\\rm PE}$) of the far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons absorbed\nby dust in the interstellar medium. In the nearby galaxy M31, we measure a\nstrong radial variation of [CII]/TIR that we rule out as being due to an\nintrinsic variation in $\\epsilon_{\\rm PE}$. [CII]/TIR fails as a proxy for\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm PE}$, because the TIR measures all dust heating, not just the\ncontribution from FUV photons capable of ejecting electrons from dust grains.\nUsing extensive multiwavelength coverage from the FUV to far-infrared (FIR), we\ninfer the attenuated FUV emission ($\\rm UV_{att}$), and the total attenuated\nflux ($\\rm TOT_{att}$). We find [CII]/TIR to be strongly correlated with $\\rm\nUV_{att}$/$\\rm TOT_{att}$, indicating that, in M31 at least, one of the\ndominant drivers for [CII]/TIR variation is the relative hardness of the\nabsorbed stellar radiation field. We define $\\rm{ \\epsilon_{PE}^{UV}}$,\n[CII]/$\\rm{ UV_{att}}$ which should be more closely related to the actual PE\nefficiency, which we find to be essentially constant ($1.85 \\pm 0.8 \\%$) in all\nexplored fields in M31. This suggests that part of the observed variation of\n[CII]/TIR in other galaxies is likely due to a change in the relative hardness\nof the absorbed stellar radiation field, caused by a combination of variations\nin the stellar population, dust opacity and galaxy metallicity, although PE\nefficiency may also vary across a wider range of environments.\n", "  In the study of high-mass star formation, hot cores are empirically defined\nstages where chemically rich emission is detected toward a massive YSO. It is\nunknown whether the physical origin of this emission is a disk, inner envelope,\nor outflow cavity wall and whether the hot core stage is common to all massive\nstars. We investigate the chemical make up of several hot molecular cores to\ndetermine physical and chemical structure. We use high spectral and spatial\nresolution Cycle 0 ALMA observations to determine how this stage fits into the\nformation sequence of a high mass star. We observed the G35.20-0.74N and\nG35.03+0.35 hot cores at 350 GHz. We analyzed spectra and maps from four\ncontinuum peaks (A, B1, B2 and B3) in G35.20, separated by 1000-2000 AU, and\none continuum peak in G35.03. We made all possible line identifications across\n8 GHz of spectral windows of molecular emission lines and determined column\ndensities and temperatures for as many as 35 species assuming local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. In comparing the spectra of the four peaks, we find\neach has a distinct chemical composition expressed in over 400 different\ntransitions. In G35.20, B1 and B2 contain oxygen- and sulfur-bearing organic\nand inorganic species but few nitrogen-bearing species whereas A and B3 are\nstrong sources of O, S, and N-bearing species (especially those with the\nCN-bond). CH$_2$DCN is clearly detected in A and B3 with D/H ratios of 8 and\n13$\\%$, respectively, but is much weaker at B1 and undetected at B2. No\ndeuterated species are detected in G35.03, but similar molecular abundances to\nG35.20 were found in other species. We also find co-spatial emission of HNCO\nand NH$_2$CHO in both sources indicating a strong chemical link between the two\nspecies. The chemical segregation between N-bearing organic species and others\nin G35.20 suggests the presence of multiple protostars, surrounded by a disk or\ntorus.\n", "  We propose a method for protecting fragile quantum superpositions in\nmany-particle systems from dephasing by external classical noise. We call\nsuperpositions \"fragile\" if dephasing occurs particularly fast, because the\nnoise couples very differently to the superposed states. The method consists of\nletting a quantum superposition evolve under the internal thermalization\ndynamics of the system, followed by a time reversal manipulation known as\nLoschmidt echo. The thermalization dynamics makes the superposed states almost\nindistinguishable during most of the above procedure. We validate the method by\napplying it to a cluster of spins-1/2.\n", "  We investigate the presence of COMs in strongly UV-irradiated interstellar\nmolecular gas. We have carried out a complete millimetre line survey using the\nIRAM30m telescope towards the edge of the Orion Bar photodissociation region\n(PDR), close to the H2 dissociation front, a position irradiated by a very\nintense far-UV (FUV) radiation field. These observations have been complemented\nwith 8.5 arcsec resolution maps of the H2CO 5(1,5)-4(1,4) and C18O 3-2 emission\nat 0.9 mm. Despite being a harsh environment, we detect more than 250 lines\nfrom COMs and related precursors: H2CO, CH3OH, HCO, H2CCO, CH3CHO, H2CS, HCOOH,\nCH3CN, CH2NH, HNCO, H13-2CO, and HC3N (in decreasing order of abundance). For\neach species, the large number of detected lines allowed us to accurately\nconstrain their rotational temperatures (Trot) and column densities (N). Owing\nto subthermal excitation and intricate spectroscopy of some COMs (symmetric-\nand asymmetric-top molecules such as CH3CN and H2CO, respectively), a correct\ndetermination of N and Trot requires building rotational population diagrams of\ntheir rotational ladders separately. We also provide accurate upper limit\nabundances for chemically related molecules that might have been expected, but\nare not conclusively detected at the edge of the PDR (HDCO, CH3O, CH3NC,\nCH3CCH, CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3, CH3CH2OH, CH3CH2CN, and CH2CHCN). A non-LTE LVG\nexcitation analysis for molecules with known collisional rate coefficients,\nsuggests that some COMs arise from different PDR layers but we cannot resolve\nthem spatially. In particular, H2CO and CH3CN survive in the extended gas\ndirectly exposed to the strong FUV flux (Tk = 150-250 K and Td > 60 K), whereas\nCH3OH only arises from denser and cooler gas clumps in the more shielded PDR\ninterior (Tk = 40-50 K). We find a HCO/H2CO/CH3OH = 1/5/3 abundance ratio.\nThese ratios are different from those inferred in hot cores and shocks.\n", "  We present a solution for the ultraviolet (UV) - submillimeter (submm)\ninterstellar radiation fields (ISRFs) of the Milky Way, derived from modelling\nCOBE, IRAS and Planck maps of the all-sky emission in the near-, mid-,\nfar-infrared and submm.The analysis uses the axisymmetric radiative transfer\n(RT) model that we have previously implemented to model the panchromatic\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of star forming galaxies in the nearby\nuniverse, but with a new methodology allowing for optimisation of the radial\nand vertical geometry of stellar emissivity and dust opacity, as deduced from\nthe highly resolved emission seen from the vantage point of the Sun. As such,\nthis is the first self-consistent model of the broad-band continuum emission\nfrom the Milky Way. In this paper, we present model predictions for the\nspatially integrated SED of the Milky Way as seen from the Sun, showing good\nagreement with the data, and give a detailed description of the solutions for\nthe distribution of ISRFs, as well as their physical origin, throughout the\nvolume of the galaxy. We explore how the spatial and spectral distribution of\nour new predictions for the ISRF in the Milky Way affects the amplitude and\nspectral distribution of the gamma-rays produced via Inverse Compton scattering\nfor cosmic ray electrons situated at different positions in the galaxy, as well\nas the attenuation of the gamma-rays due to interactions of the gamma-ray\nphotons with photons of the ISRF. We also compare and contrast our solutions\nfor the ISRF with those incorporated in the GALPROP package used for modelling\nthe high energy emission from cosmic rays in the Milky Way.\n", "  We present a new method of identifying protostellar disc fragments in a\nsimulation based on density derivatives, and analyse our data using this and\nthe existing CLUMPFIND method, which is based on an ordered search over all\nparticles in gravitational potential energy. Using smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics, we carry out 9 simulations of a $0.25$ M$_{\\odot}$ disc around a\n1 M$_{\\odot}$ star, all of which fragment to form at least 2 bound objects. We\nfind that when using all particles ordered in gravitational potential space,\nonly fragments that survive the duration of the simulation are detected. When\nwe use the density derivative method, all fragments are detected, so the two\nmethods are complementary, as using the two methods together allows us to\nidentify all fragments, and to then determine those that are likely to be\ndestroyed. We find a tentative empirical relationship between the dominant\nazimuthal wavenumber in the disc $m$ and the maximum semi-major axis a fragment\nmay achieve in a simulation, such that $a_{\\mathrm{max}}\\propto\\frac{1}{m}$. We\nfind the fragment destruction rate to be around half that predicted from\npopulation synthesis models. This is due to fragment-fragment interactions in\nthe early gas phase of the disc, which can cause scattering and eccentricity\npumping on short timescales, and affects the fragment's internal structure. We\ntherefore caution that measurements of eccentricity as a function of semi-major\naxis may not necessarily constrain the formation mechanism of giant planets and\nbrown dwarfs.\n", "  We study the effect of dynamical tides associated with the excitation of\ngravity waves in an interior radiative region of the central star on orbital\nevolution in observed systems containing Hot Jupiters. We consider WASP-43,\nOgle-tr-113, WASP-12, and WASP-18 which contain stars on the main sequence\n(MS). For these systems there are observational estimates regarding the rate of\nchange of the orbital period. We also investigate Kepler-91 which contains an\nevolved giant star. We adopt the formalism of Ivanov et al. for calculating the\norbital evolution.\n  For the MS stars we determine expected rates of orbital evolution under\ndifferent assumptions about the amount of dissipation acting on the tides,\nestimate the effect of stellar rotation for the two most rapidly rotating stars\nand compare results with observations. All cases apart from possibly WASP-43\nare consistent with a regime in which gravity waves are damped during their\npropagation over the star. However, at present this is not definitive as\nobservational errors are large. We find that although it is expected to apply\nto Kepler-91, linear radiative damping cannot explain this dis- sipation regime\napplying to MS stars. Thus, a nonlinear mechanism may be needed.\n  Kepler-91 is found to be such that the time scale for evolution of the star\nis comparable to that for the orbit. This implies that significant orbital\ncircularisation may have occurred through tides acting on the star.\nQuasi-static tides, stellar winds, hydrodynamic drag and tides acting on the\nplanet have likely played a minor role.\n", "  We present quasi-simultaneous radio (VLA) and X-ray ($Swift$) observations of\nthe neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) 1RXS J180408.9$-$342058\n(J1804) during its 2015 outburst. We found that the radio jet of J1804 was\nbright ($232 \\pm 4 \\mu$Jy at $10$ GHz) during the initial hard X-ray state,\nbefore being quenched by more than an order of magnitude during the soft X-ray\nstate ($19 \\pm 4 \\mu$Jy). The source then was undetected in radio (< $13\n\\mu$Jy) as it faded to quiescence. In NS-LMXBs, possible jet quenching has been\nobserved in only three sources and the J1804 jet quenching we show here is the\ndeepest and clearest example to date. Radio observations when the source was\nfading towards quiescence ($L_X = 10^{34-35}$ erg s$^{-1}$) show that J1804\nmust follow a steep track in the radio/X-ray luminosity plane with $\\beta >\n0.7$ (where $L_R \\propto L_X^{\\beta}$). Few other sources have been studied in\nthis faint regime, but a steep track is inconsistent with the suggested\nbehaviour for the recently identified class of transitional millisecond\npulsars. J1804 also shows fainter radio emission at $L_X < 10^{35}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ than what is typically observed for accreting millisecond pulsars.\nThis suggests that J1804 is likely not an accreting X-ray or transitional\nmillisecond pulsar.\n", "  We present the results of 14 simulations of nonspinning black hole binaries\nwith mass ratios $q=m_1/m_2$ in the range $1/100\\leq q\\leq1$. For each of these\nsimulations we perform three runs at increasing resolution to assess the finite\ndifference errors and to extrapolate the results to infinite resolution. For\n$q\\geq 1/6$, we follow the evolution of the binary typically for the last ten\norbits prior to merger. By fitting the results of these simulations, we\naccurately model the peak luminosity, peak waveform frequency and amplitude,\nand the recoil of the remnant hole for unequal mass nonspinning binaries. We\nverify the accuracy of these new models and compare them to previously existing\nempirical formulas. These new fits provide a basis for a hierarchical approach\nto produce more accurate remnant formulas in the generic precessing case. They\nalso provide input to gravitational waveform modeling.\n", "  Simulations of tidal streams show that close encounters with dark matter\nsubhalos induce density gaps and distortions in on-sky path along the streams.\nAccordingly, observing disrupted streams in the Galactic halo would\nsubstantiate the hypothesis that dark matter substructure exists there, while\nin contrast, observing collimated streams with smoothly varying density\nprofiles would place strong upper limits on the number density and mass\nspectrum of subhalos. Here, we examine several measures of stream \"disruption\"\nand their power to distinguish between halo potentials with and without\nsubstructure and with different global shapes. We create and evolve a\npopulation of 1280 streams on a range of orbits in the Via Lactea II simulation\nof a Milky Way-like halo, replete with a full mass range of {\\Lambda}CDM\nsubhalos, and compare it to two control stream populations evolved in smooth\nspherical and smooth triaxial potentials, respectively. We find that the number\nof gaps observed in a stellar stream is a poor indicator of the halo potential,\nbut that (i) the thinness of the stream on-sky, (ii) the symmetry of the\nleading and trailing tails, and (iii) the deviation of the tails from a\nlow-order polynomial path on-sky (\"path regularity\") distinguish between the\nthree potentials more effectively. We find that globular cluster streams on\nlow-eccentricity orbits far from the galactic center (apocentric radius ~ 30-80\nkpc) are most powerful in distinguishing between the three potentials. If they\nexist, such streams will shortly be discoverable and mapped in high dimensions\nwith near-future photometric and spectroscopic surveys.\n", "  This paper explores the effects of large-scale magnetic fields in hot\naccretion flows for asymmetric configurations with respect to the equatorial\nplane. The solutions that we have found show that the large-scale asymmetric\nmagnetic field can significantly affect the dynamics of the flow and also cause\nnotable outflows in the outer parts. Previously, we treated a viscous resistive\naccreting disc in the presence of an odd symmetric $\\textbf{B-}$ field about\nthe equatorial plane. Now we extend our earlier work by taking into account\nanother configuration of large-scale magnetic field which is no longer\nsymmetric. We provide asymmetric field structures with small deviations from\neven and odd symmetric $\\textbf{B-}$field. Our results show that the disc's\ndynamics and appearance become different above and below the equatorial plane.\nThe set of solutions also predicts that even a small deviation in a symmetric\nfield causes the disc to compress on one side and expand on the other. In some\ncases, our solution represents a very strong outflow from just one side of the\ndisc. Therefore, the solution may potentially explain the origin of one-sided\njets in radio galaxies.\n", "  We report 3 mm continuum, CH3CN(5-4) and 13CS(2-1) line observations with\nCARMA, in conjunction with 6 and 1.3 cm continuum VLA data, and 12 and 25\nmicron broadband data from the Subaru Telescope toward the massive proto-star\nIRAS18566+0408. The VLA data resolve the ionized jet into 4 components aligned\nin the E-W direction. Radio components A, C, and D have flat cm SEDs indicative\nof optically thin emission from ionized gas, and component B has a spectral\nindex alpha = 1.0, and a decreasing size with frequency proportional to\nfrequency to the -0.5 power. Emission from the CARMA 3 mm continuum, and from\nthe 13CS(2-1), and CH3CN(5-4) spectral lines is compact (i.e. < 6700 AU), and\npeaks near the position of VLA cm source, component B. Analysis of these lines\nindicates hot, and dense molecular gas, typical for HMCs. Our Subaru telescope\nobservations detect a single compact source, coincident with radio component B,\ndemonstrating that most of the energy in IRAS18566+0408 originates from a\nregion of size < 2400 AU. We also present UKIRT near-infrared archival data for\nIRAS18566+0408 which show extended K-band emission along the jet direction. We\ndetect an E-W velocity shift of about 10 km/sec over the HMC in the CH3CN lines\npossibly tracing the interface of the ionized jet with the surrounding core\ngas. Our data demonstrate the presence of an ionized jet at the base of the\nmolecular outflow, and support the hypothesis that massive protostars with\nO-type luminosity form with a mechanism similar to lower mass stars.\n", "  We calculate the invariant and helicity amplitudes for the transitions\n$\\Lambda_b~\\to~\\Lambda^{(\\ast)}(J^P)~+~J/\\psi$ where the\n$\\Lambda^{(\\ast)}(J^P)$ are $\\Lambda(sud)$-type ground and excited states with\n$J^P$ quantum numbers $J^P=\\frac12^{\\pm},\\frac32^{\\pm}$. The calculations are\nperformed in the framework of a covariant confined quark model previously\ndeveloped by us. We find that the values of the helicity amplitudes for the\n$\\Lambda^\\ast(1520,\\,\\frac32^-)$ and the $\\Lambda^\\ast(1890,\\,\\frac32^+)$ are\nsuppressed compared with those for the ground state $\\Lambda(1116,\\,\\frac12^+)$\nand the excited state $\\Lambda^\\ast(1405,\\,\\frac12^-)$. This analysis is\nimportant for the identification of the hidden charm pentaquark states\n$P_c^+(4380)$ and $P_c^+(4450)$ which were discovered in the decay chain\n$\\Lambda_b^0~\\to~P_c^+(~\\to~p~J/\\psi)~+~K^- $ because the cascade decay chain\n$\\Lambda_b~\\to~\\Lambda^\\ast(\\frac32^\\pm)(~\\to~pK^-)~+~J/\\psi$ involves the same\nfinal state.\n", "  We examine the dependence between hydrogen total mass $M_{HI}$ and rotation\nspeed $V_{rot}$, optical size $D_{25}$ or disc radial scale $R_0$ for two\nsamples of late-type galaxies: a) isolated galaxy (AMIGA sample), and b) the\nedge-on galaxies (flat galaxies of Karachentsev et al. 1999). Estimates of\n$M_{HI}$, given in the HYPERLEDA database for flat galaxies appear to be on\naverage higher at $\\sim $0.2 dex, than for isolated galaxies with similar\n$V_{rot}$ or $D_{25}$ values, most probably, due to the overvaluation of\nself-absorption in the HI line. We confirm that the hydrogen mass for both\nsamples closely correlates with galactic disc integral specific angular\nmomentum $J$, which is proportional to $V_{rot}D_{25}$ or $V_{rot}R_0$, with\nlow surface brightness galaxies lie along a common $V_{rot}R_0$ sequence. This\nrelationship can be explained, assuming that gas mass in the disc is regulated\nby marginal gravitational stability condition of gas layer. A comparison of the\nobserved and theoretically expected dependences leads to a conclusion that\neither gravitational stability corresponds to higher values of Toomre parameter\nthan is usually assumed, or the threshold stability condition for most galaxies\ntook place only in the past, when gas mass in discs was 2-4 times higher than\nat present (with the exception of galaxies with abnormally high $HI$ content).\nThe last condition requires that the gas accretion was not compensated by gas\nconsumption during the evolution of most of galaxies.\n", "  We provide a protocol for Hamiltonian parameter estimation which relies only\non the Zeeman effect. No time-dependent quantities need to be measured, it\nfully suffices to observe spectral shifts induced by fields applied to local\n`markers'. We demonstrate the idea with a simple tight-binding Hamiltonian and\nnumerically show stability with respect to Gaussian noise on the spectral\nmeasurements. Then we generalize the result to show applicability to a wide\nrange of systems, including quantum spin chains, networks of qubits, and\ncoupled harmonic oscillators, and suggest potential experimental\nimplementations.\n", "  The millimeter bump, as found in high-resolution multi-waveband observations\nof M87, most possibly comes from the synchrotron emission of thermal electrons\nin advection dominated accretion flow(ADAF). It is possible to constrain the\naccretion rate near the horizon if both the nuclear millimeter emission and its\npolarization are produced by the hot plasma in the accretion flow. The jet\npower of M87 has been extensively explored, which is around $8_{\\rm\n-3}^{+7}\\times10^{42} {\\rm erg/s}$ based on the analysis of the X-ray cavity.\nThe black hole(BH) spin can be estimated if the jet power and the accretion\nrate near the horizon are known. We model the multi-wavelength spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of M87 with a coupled ADAF-jet model surrounding a Kerr BH,\nwhere the full set of relativistic hydrodynamical equations of the ADAF are\nsolved. The hybrid jet formation model, as a variant of Blandford-Znajek model,\nis used to model the jet power. We find that the SMBH should be fast rotating\nwith a dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}\\simeq0.98_{\\rm -0.02}^{+0.012}$.\n", "  The masses and radii of solar-like oscillators can be estimated through the\nasteroseismic scaling relations. These relations provide a direct link between\nobservables, i.e. effective temperature and characteristics of the oscillation\nspectra, and stellar properties, i.e. mean density and surface gravity (thus\nmass and radius). These scaling relations are commonly used to characterize\nlarge samples of stars. Usually, the Sun is used as a reference from which the\nstructure is scaled. However, for stars that do not have a similar structure as\nthe Sun, using the Sun as a reference introduces systematic errors as large as\n10\\% in mass and 5\\% in radius. Several alternatives for the reference of the\nscaling relation involving the large frequency separation (typical frequency\ndifference between modes of the same degree and consecutive radial order) have\nbeen suggested in the literature. In a previous paper, we presented a reference\nfunction with a dependence on both effective temperature and metallicity. The\naccuracy of predicted masses and radii improved considerably when using\nreference values calculated from our reference function. However, the residuals\nindicated that stars on the red-giant branch possess a mass dependence that was\nnot accounted for. Here, we present a reference function for the scaling\nrelation involving the large frequency separation that includes the mass\ndependence. This new reference function improves the derived masses and radii\nsignificantly by removing the systematic differences and mitigates the trend\nwith $\\nu_{\\rm max}$ (frequency of maximum oscillation power) that exists when\nusing the solar value as a reference.\n", "  X-ray observations of two metal-deficient luminous compact galaxies (LCG)\n(SHOC~486 and SDSS J084220.94+115000.2) with properties similar to the\nso-called Green Pea galaxies were obtained using the {\\emph{Chandra X-ray\nObservatory}}. Green Pea galaxies are relatively small, compact (a few kpc\nacross) galaxies that get their green color from strong [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\\AA\\\nemission, an indicator of intense, recent star formation. These two galaxies\nwere predicted to have the highest observed count rates, using the X-ray\nluminosity -- star formation rate ($L_X$--SFR) relation for X-ray binaries,\nfrom a statistically complete sample drawn from optical criteria. We determine\nthe X-ray luminosity relative to star-formation rate and metallicity for these\ntwo galaxies. Neither exhibit any evidence of active galactic nuclei and we\nsuspect the X-ray emission originates from unresolved populations of high mass\nX-ray binaries. We discuss the $L_X$--SFR--metallicity plane for star-forming\ngalaxies and show that the two LCGs are consistent with the prediction of this\nrelation. This is the first detection of Green Pea analogs in X-rays.\n", "  Understanding the origin of the flaring activity from the Galactic center\nsupermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, is a major scientific goal of the\nNuSTAR Galactic plane survey campaign. We report on the data obtained between\nJuly 2012 and April 2015, including 27 observations on Sgr A* with a total\nexposure of ~ 1 Ms. We found a total of ten X-ray flares detected in the NuSTAR\nobservation window, with luminosities in the range of $L_{3-79~keV}$~$(0.2-4.0)\n\\times 10^{35}~erg~s^{-1}$. With this largest hard X-ray Sgr A* flare dataset\nto date, we studied the flare spectral properties. Seven flares are detected\nabove 5{\\sigma} significance, showing a range of photon indices ({\\Gamma} ~\n2.0-2.8) with typical uncertainties of +/-0.5 (90% confidence level). We found\nno significant spectral hardening for brighter flares as indicated by a smaller\nsample. The accumulation of all the flare spectra in 1-79 keV can be well fit\nwith an absorbed power-law model with {\\Gamma}=2.2+/-0.1, and does not require\nthe existence of a spectral break. The lack of variation in X-ray spectral\nindex with luminosity would point to a single mechanism for the flares and is\nconsistent with the synchrotron scenario. Lastly, we present the quiescent\nstate spectrum of Sgr A*, and derived an upper limit on the quiescent\nluminosity of Sgr A* above 10 keV to be $L_{Xq, 10-79 keV}$ < $(2.9{\\pm}0.2)\n\\times 10^{34}~erg~s^{-1}$.\n", "  The core accretion hypothesis posits that planets with significant gaseous\nenvelopes accreted them from their protoplanetary discs after the formation of\nrocky/icy cores. Observations indicate that such exoplanets exist at a broad\nrange of orbital radii, but it is not known whether they accreted their\nenvelopes in situ, or originated elsewhere and migrated to their current\nlocations. We consider the evolution of solid cores embedded in evolving\nviscous discs that undergo gaseous envelope accretion in situ with orbital\nradii in the range $0.1-10\\rm au$. Additionally, we determine the long-term\nevolution of the planets that had no runaway gas accretion phase after disc\ndispersal. We find: (i) Planets with $5 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ cores never undergo\nrunaway accretion. The most massive envelope contained $2.8 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$\nwith the planet orbiting at $10 \\rm au$. (ii) Accretion is more efficient onto\n$10 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ and $15 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ cores. For orbital radii $a_{\\rm p}\n\\ge 0.5 \\rm au$, $15 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ cores always experienced runaway gas\naccretion. For $a_{\\rm p} \\ge 5 \\rm au$, all but one of the $10 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$\ncores experienced runaway gas accretion. No planets experienced runaway growth\nat $a_{\\rm p} = 0.1 \\rm au$. (iii) We find that, after disc dispersal, planets\nwith significant gaseous envelopes cool and contract on Gyr time-scales, the\ncontraction time being sensitive to the opacity assumed. Our results indicate\nthat Hot Jupiters with core masses $\\lesssim 15 \\rm M_{\\oplus}$ at $\\lesssim\n0.1 \\rm au$ likely accreted their gaseous envelopes at larger distances and\nmigrated inwards. Consistently with the known exoplanet population,\nSuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes at small radii during the disc lifetime, accrete\nonly modest gaseous envelopes.\n", "  We report the serendipitous young Large Magellanic Cloud cluster, NGC 1971,\nexhibits an extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) possibly originated by\nmostly a real age spread. We used CT1 Washington photometry to produce a\ncolour-magnitude diagram (CMD) with the fiducial cluster features. From its\neMSTO, we estimated an age spread of ~ 170 Myr (observed age range 100-280\nMyr), once observational errors, stellar binarity, overall metalicity\nvariations and stellar rotation effects were subtracted in quadrature from the\nobserved age width.\n", "  We present a coherent multi-band modelling of the CO Spectral Energy\nDistribution of the local Seyfert Galaxy NGC7130 to assess the impact of the\nAGN activity on the molecular gas. We take advantage of all the available data\nfrom X-ray to the sub-mm, including ALMA data. The high-resolution (~0.2\") ALMA\nCO(6-5) data constrain the spatial extension of the CO emission down to ~70 pc\nscale. From the analysis of the archival CHANDRA and NuSTAR data, we infer the\npresence of a buried, Compton-thick AGN of moderate luminosity, L_2-10keV ~\n1.6x10^{43} ergs-1. We explore photodissociation and X-ray-dominated regions\n(PDRs and XDRs) models to reproduce the CO emission. We find that PDRs can\nreproduce the CO lines up to J~6, however, the higher rotational ladder\nrequires the presence of a separate source of excitation. We consider X-ray\nheating by the AGN as a source of excitation, and find that it can reproduce\nthe observed CO Spectral Energy Distribution. By adopting a composite PDR+XDR\nmodel, we derive molecular cloud properties. Our study clearly indicates the\ncapabilities offered by current-generation of instruments to shed light on the\nproperties of nearby galaxies adopting state-of-the art physical modelling.\n", "  After the initial fast spiral-in phase experienced by a common-envelope\nbinary, the system may enter a slow, self-regulated phase, possibly lasting\n100s of years, in which all the energy released by orbital decay can be\nefficiently transported to the surface, where it is radiated away. If the\nremaining envelope is to be removed during this phase, this removal must occur\nthrough some as-yet-undetermined mechanism. We carried out 1-d hydrodynamic\nsimulations of a low-mass red giant undergoing a synthetic common-envelope\nevent in such a slow spiral-in phase, using the stellar evolutionary code MESA.\nWe simulated the heating of the envelope due to frictional dissipation from a\nbinary companion's orbit in multiple configurations and investigated the\nresponse of the giant's envelope. We find that our model envelopes become\ndynamically unstable and develop large-amplitude pulsations, with periods in\nthe range 3-20 years and very short growth time-scales of similar order. The\nshocks and associated rebounds that emerge as these pulsations grow are in some\ncases strong enough to dynamically eject shells of matter of up to 0.1\n$\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, $\\sim 10$ % of the mass of the envelope, from the stellar\nsurface at above escape velocity. These ejections are seen to repeat within a\nfew decades, leading to a time-averaged mass-loss rate of order $10^{-3}$\n$\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} \\: \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ which is sufficiently high to\nrepresent a candidate mechanism for removing the entire envelope over the\nduration of the slow spiral-in phase.\n", "  The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) provides an improvement in\nsensitivity at energies above 10 keV by two orders of magnitude over\nnon-focusing satellites, making it possible to probe deeper into the Galaxy and\nUniverse. Lansbury and collaborators recently completed a catalog of 497\nsources serendipitously detected in the 3-24 keV band using 13 deg2 of NuSTAR\ncoverage. Here, we report on an optical and X-ray study of 16 Galactic sources\nin the catalog. We identify eight of them as stars (but some or all could have\nbinary companions), and use information from Gaia to report distances and X-ray\nluminosities for three of them. There are four CVs or CV candidates, and we\nargue that NuSTAR J233426-2343.9 is a relatively strong CV candidate based\npartly on an X-ray spectrum from XMM-Newton. NuSTAR J092418-3142.2, which is\nthe brightest serendipitous source in the Lansbury catalog, and NuSTAR\nJ073959-3147.8 are LMXB candidates, but it is also possible that these two\nsources are CVs. One of the sources is a known HMXB, and NuSTAR J105008-5958.8\nis a new HMXB candidate, which has strong Balmer emission lines in its optical\nspectrum and a hard X-ray spectrum. We discuss the implications of finding\nthese HMXBs for the surface density (logN-logS) and luminosity function of\nGalactic HMXBs. We conclude that, with the large fraction of unclassified\nsources in the Galactic plane detected by NuSTAR in the 8-24 keV band, there\ncould be a significant population of low luminosity HMXBs.\n", "  We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of two ultra diffuse galaxies\n(UDGs) with measured stellar velocity dispersions in the Coma cluster. The\ngalaxies, Dragonfly 44 and DFX1, have effective radii of 4.7 kpc and 3.5 kpc\nand velocity dispersions of $47^{+8}_{-6}$ km/s and $30^{+7}_{-7}$ km/s,\nrespectively. Both galaxies are associated with a striking number of compact\nobjects, tentatively identified as globular clusters: $N_{\\rm gc}=74\\pm 18$ for\nDragonfly 44 and $N_{\\rm gc}=62\\pm 17$ for DFX1. The number of globular\nclusters is far higher than expected from the luminosities of the galaxies but\nis consistent with expectations from the empirical relation between dynamical\nmass and globular cluster count defined by other galaxies. Combining our data\nfor these two objects with previous HST observations of Coma UDGs we find that\nUDGs have a factor of $6.9^{+1.0}_{-2.4}$ more globular clusters than other\ngalaxies of the same luminosity, in contrast to a recent study of a similar\nsample by Amorisco et al. (2017), but consistent with earlier results for\nindividual galaxies. The Harris et al. (2017) relation between globular cluster\ncount and dark matter halo mass implies a median halo mass of $M_{\\rm halo}\\sim\n1.5\\times 10^{11}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ for the sixteen Coma UDGs that have been\nobserved with HST so far, with the largest and brightest having $M_{\\rm\nhalo}\\sim 5\\times 10^{11}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations of the RR Lyrae\nvariables in the globular cluster, M3, published in Jurcsik et al. (2017, Paper\nI) made it possible to perform Baade-Wesselink (BW) analysis of a large sample\nof Blazhko stars for the first time. The BW distances of Blazhko stars turned\nout to be unreliable, as significantly different distances were obtained for\nthe stars of the Blazhko sample and also for the same star in different\nmodulation phases. Even the results of small modulation-amplitude Blazhko stars\nmay be doubtful. This result warns that the application of the BW method to\nBlazhko stars is not trustworthy.\n  Keeping the distance fixed for each Blazhko star in each modulation phase, a\nsignificant difference between the spectroscopic and the photometric radius\n($R_{\\textrm{sp}}$, $R_{\\textrm{ph}}$) variations is detected. The phase and\namplitude variations of $R_{\\textrm{sp}}$ follow the changes of the light curve\nduring the Blazhko cycle but the $R_{\\textrm{ph}}$ curve seems to be not (or\nonly marginally) affected by the modulation. The asynchronous behaviour of\n$R_{\\textrm{sp}}$ and $R_{\\textrm{ph}}$ supports the interpretation of the\nBlazhko effect as a depth-dependent phenomenon, as the spectroscopic radius\nvariation reflects the radial displacement of the line-forming region high in\nthe atmosphere, while the photospheric radius variation is derived from the\ninformation of the observed visual-band light emitted mostly by the lower\nphotosphere. The stability of $R_{\\textrm{ph}}$ may be interpreted as a strong\nargument against the non-radial-mode explanation of the Blazhko phenomenon.\n", "  We present ten $R$-band photometric observations of eight different transits\nof the hot Jupiter HAT-P-33b, which has been targeted by our Transiting\nExoplanet Monitoring Project (TEMP). The data were obtained by two telescopes\nat the Xinglong Station of National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC)\nfrom 2013 December through 2016 January, and exhibit photometric scatter of\n$1.6-3.0\\,\\rm{mmag}$. After jointly analyzing the previously published\nphotometric data, radial-velocity (RV) measurements, and our new light curves,\nwe revisit the system parameters and orbital ephemeris for the HAT-P-33b\nsystem. Our results are consistent with the published values except for the\nplanet-to-star radius ratio ($R_{P}/R_{*}$), the ingress/egress duration\n($\\tau$) and the total duration ($T_{14}$), which together indicate a slightly\nshallower and shorter transit shape. Our results are based on more complete\nlight curves, whereas the previously published work had only one complete\ntransit light curve. No significant anomalies in Transit Timing Variations\n(TTVs) are found, and we place upper mass limits on potential perturbers,\nlargely supplanting the loose constraints provided by the extant RV data. The\nTTV limits are stronger near mean-motion resonances, especially for the\nlow-order commensurabilities. We can exclude the existence of a perturber with\nmass larger than 0.6, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5, and $0.3\\,{\\rm M_\\oplus}$ near the 1:3,\n1:2, 2:3, 3:2, and 2:1 resonances, respectively.\n", "  The Southern HII Region Discovery Survey (SHRDS) is a survey of the third and\nfourth quadrants of the Galactic plane that will detect radio recombination\nline and continuum emission at cm-wavelengths from several hundred HII region\ncandidates using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The targets for this\nsurvey come from the WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions, and were identified\nbased on mid-infrared and radio continuum emission. In this pilot project, two\ndifferent configurations of the Compact Array Broad Band receiver and\nspectrometer system were used for short test observations. The pilot surveys\ndetected radio recombination line emission from 36 of 53 HII region candidates,\nas well as seven known \\hii regions that were included for calibration. These\n36 recombination line detections confirm that the candidates are true HII\nregions, and allow us to estimate their distances.\n", "  We formulate the chiral kinetic equation with the longitudinal boost\ninvariance. We particularly focus on the physical interpretation of the\nparticle number conservation. There appear two terms associated with the\nexpansion, which did not exist in the non-chiral kinetic equation. One is a\ncontribution to the transverse current arising from the side-jump effect, and\nthe other is a change in the density whose flow makes the longitudinal current.\nWe point out a characteristic pattern in the transverse current driven by the\nexpansion, which we call the chiral circular displacement.\n", "  Galaxy-scale bars are expected to provide an effective means for driving\nmaterial towards the central region in spiral galaxies, and possibly feeding\nsupermassive black holes (BHs). Here we present a statistically-complete study\nof the effect of bars on average BH accretion. From a well-selected sample of\n50,794 spiral galaxies (with M* ~ 0.2-30 x 10^10 Msun) extracted from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Galaxy Zoo 2 project, we separate those sources considered\nto contain galaxy-scale bars from those that do not. Using archival data taken\nby the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we identify X-ray luminous (L_X >~ 10^41\nerg/s) active galactic nuclei (AGN) and perform an X-ray stacking analysis on\nthe remaining X-ray undetected sources. Through X-ray stacking, we derive a\ntime-averaged look at accretion for galaxies at fixed stellar mass and star\nformation rate, finding that the average nuclear accretion rates of galaxies\nwith bar structures are fully consistent with those lacking bars (Mdot_acc ~ 3\nx 10^-5 Msun/yr). Hence, we robustly conclude that large-scale bars have little\nor no effect on the average growth of BHs in nearby (z < 0.15) galaxies over\ngigayear timescales.\n", "  We investigate the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the Carina dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy using data of Stetson et al. (2011) and synthetic CMDs based\non isochrones of Dotter et al. (2008), in terms of the parameters [Fe/H], age,\nand [alpha/Fe], for the cases when (i) [alpha/Fe] is held constant and (ii)\n[alpha/Fe] is varied. The data are well described by four basic epochs of star\nformation, having [Fe/H] = -1.85, -1.5, -1.2, and ~-1.15 and ages ~13, 7, ~3.5,\nand ~1.5 Gyr, respectively (for [alpha/Fe] = 0.1 (constant [alpha/Fe]) and\n[alpha/Fe] = 0.2, 0.1, -0.2, -0.2 (variable [alpha/Fe])), with small spreads in\n[Fe/H] and age of order 0.1 dex and 1 - 3 Gyr. Within an elliptical radius 13.1\narcmin, the mass fractions of the populations, at their times of formation,\nwere (in decreasing age order) 0.34, 0.39, 0.23, and 0.04. This formalism\nreproduces five observed CMD features (two distinct subgiant branches of old\nand intermediate-age populations, two younger, main-sequence components, and\nthe small color dispersion on the red giant branch (RGB)). The parameters of\nthe youngest population are less certain than those of the others, and given it\nis less centrally concentrated it may not be directly related to them.\nHigh-resolution spectroscopically analyzed RGB samples appear statistically\nincomplete compared with those selected using radial velocity, which contain\nbluer stars comprising ~5 - 10% of the samples. We conjecture these objects\nmay, at least in part, be members of the youngest population. We use the CMD\nsimulations to obtain insight into the population structure of Carina's upper\nRGB.\n", "  Chemical abundances are presented for 19 elements in a sample of 63 red\ngiants in the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph), based on homogeneous\n1D/LTE model atmosphere analyses of our own observations (32 stars) and data\navailable in the literature (a further 31 independent stars). The (Fe)\nmetallicity and [$\\alpha$/Fe] distribution functions have mean values and\ndispersions of -1.59 and 0.33 dex ([Fe/H] range: -2.68 to -0.64), and 0.07 and\n0.13 dex ([$\\alpha$/Fe] range: -0.27 to 0.25), respectively. We confirm the\nfinding of Venn et al. (2012) that a small percentage (some 10% in the present\ninvestigation) of the sample show clear evidence for significant enrichment by\nType Ia supernovae ejecta. Calcium, with the most accurately determined\nabundance of the alpha-elements, shows an asymmetric distribution towards\nsmaller values of [Ca/Fe] at all [Fe/H], most significantly over -2.0 < [Fe/H]\n< -1.0, suggestive of incomplete mixing of the ejecta of Type Ia SNe with the\nambient medium of each of Carina's generations. Approximate\ncolor-magnitude-diagram age estimates are presented for the sample and,\ntogether with our chemical abundances, compared with the results of our\nprevious synthetic CMD analysis, which reported the details of Carina's four\nwell-defined populations.\n  We searched for the Na-O anti-correlation universally reported in the\nGalaxy's globular clusters, and confirm that this phenomenon does not exist in\nCarina. We also found that one of the 32 stars in our sample has an extremely\nenhanced lithium abundance -- A(Li)$_{\\text{NLTE}}$ = +3.36, consistent with\nmembership of the ~1% group of Li-rich stars in dSph described by Kirby et al.\n", "  We present a study on the evolution of the small scale velocity field in a\nsolar filament as it approaches to the eruption. The observation was carried\nout by the Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager (SDDI) that was newly installed on the\nSolar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope (SMART) at Hida Observatory. The\nSDDI obtains a narrow-band full disk image of the sun at 73 channels from\nH$\\alpha$ - 9.0 \\AA\\ to H$\\alpha$ + 9.0 \\AA, allowing us to study the\nline-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the filament before and during the eruption.\nThe observed filament is a quiescent filament that erupted on 2016 November 5.\nWe derived the LOS velocity at each pixel in the filament using the Becker's\ncloud model, and made the histograms of the LOS velocity at each time. The\nstandard deviation of the LOS velocity distribution can be regarded as a\nmeasure for the amplitude of the small scale motion in the filament. We found\nthat the standard deviation on the previous day of the eruption was mostly\nconstant around 2-3 km s$^{-1}$, and it slightly increased to 3-4 km s$^{-1}$\non the day of the eruption. It shows further increase with a rate of 1.1 m\ns$^{-2}$ about three hours before eruption and again with a rate of 2.8 m\ns$^{-2}$ about an hour before eruption. From this result we suggest the\nincrease in the amplitude of the small scale motions in a filament can be\nregarded as a precursor of the eruption.\n", "  Recently, a deviation of the Gaia TGAS parallaxes from the asteroseismic ones\nfor giants was found. We show that for parallaxes $\\varpi<1.5$ mas it can be\nexplained by a selection effect in favour of bright and luminous giants in the\nTycho-2 and TGAS catalogues. Another explanation of this deviation seems to be\nvalid for $\\varpi>1.5$ mas based on the best extinction estimates: the\ndeviation may be caused not by a bias of parallax, but by an underestimation of\nthe extinction (and, consequently, an overestimation of the calculated absolute\nmagnitude) in the asteroseismic results. We demonstrate that the reliable\nestimates of the reddening and extinction (about 0.22 mag of the visual\nextinction for the Kepler field) better fit both the giants and main sequence\nstars to the PARSEC, MIST and YaPSI isochrones.\n", "  We examine the frequency shifts in low-degree helioseismic modes from the\nBirmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) covering the period from 1985 -\n2016, and compare them with a number of global activity proxies well as a\nlatitudinally-resolved magnetic index. As well as looking at frequency shifts\nin different frequency bands, we look at a parametrization of the shift as a\ncubic function of frequency. While the shifts in the medium- and highfrequency\nbands are very well correlated with all of the activity indices (with the best\ncorrelation being with the 10.7 cm radio flux), we confirm earlier findings\nthat there appears to have been a change in the frequency response to activity\nduring solar cycle 23, and the low frequency shifts are less correlated with\nactivity in the last two cycles than they were in Cycle 22. At the same time,\nthe more recent cycles show a slight increase in their sensitivity to activity\nlevels at medium and higher frequencies, perhaps because a greater proportion\nof activity is composed of weaker or more ephemeral regions. This lends weight\nto the speculation that a fundamental change in the nature of the solar dynamo\nmay be in progress.\n", "  Stationary stellar systems with radially elongated orbits are subject to\nradial orbit instability -- an important phenomenon that structures galaxies.\nAntonov (1973) presented a formal proof of the instability for spherical\nsystems in the limit of purely radial orbits. However, such spheres have highly\ninhomogeneous density distributions with singularity $\\sim 1/r^2$, resulting in\nan inconsistency in the proof. The proof can be refined, if one considers an\norbital distribution close to purely radial, but not entirely radial, which\nallows to avoid the central singularity. For this purpose we employ\nnon-singular analogs of generalised polytropes elaborated recently in our work\nin order to derive and solve new integral equations adopted for calculation of\nunstable eigenmodes in systems with nearly radial orbits. In addition, we\nestablish a link between our and Antonov's approaches and uncover the meaning\nof infinite entities in the purely radial case. Maximum growth rates tend to\ninfinity as the system becomes more and more radially anisotropic. The\ninstability takes place both for even and odd spherical harmonics, with all\nunstable modes developing rapidly, i.e. having eigenfrequencies comparable to\nor greater than typical orbital frequencies. This invalidates orbital\napproximation in the case of systems with all orbits very close to purely\nradial.\n", "  The recent observations of rippled structures on the surface of the Orion\nmolecular cloud (Bern\\'{e} et al. 2010), have been attributed to the\nKelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability. The wavelike structures which have mainly\nseen near star-forming regions taking place at the interface between the hot\ndiffuse gas, which is ionized by massive stars, and the cold dense molecular\nclouds. The radiation pressure of massive stars and stellar clusters is one of\nthe important issues that has been considered frequently in the dynamics of\nclouds. Here, we investigate the influence of radiation pressure, from\nwell-known Trapezium cluster in the Orion nebula, on the evolution of KH\ninstability. The stability of the interface between HII region and molecular\nclouds in the presence of the radiation pressure, has been studied using the\nlinear perturbation analysis for the certain range of the wavelengths. The\nlinear analysis show that consideration of the radiation pressure intensifies\nthe growth rate of KH modes and consequently decreases the e-fold time-scale of\nthe instability. On the other hand the domain of the instability is extended\nand includes the more wavelengths, consisting of smaller ones rather than the\ncase when the effect of the radiation pressure is not considered. Our results\nshows that for $\\lambda_{\\rm KH}>0.15\\rm pc$, the growth rate of KH instability\ndose not depend to the radiation pressure. Based on our results, the radiation\npressure is a triggering mechanism in development of the KH instability and\nsubsequently formation of turbulent sub-structures in the molecular clouds near\nmassive stars. The role of magnetic fields in the presence of the radiation\npressure is also investigated and it is resulted that the magnetic field\nsuppresses the effects induced by the radiation pressure.\n", "  We describe a new method for identifying and characterizing the thermodynamic\nstate of large samples of evolved galaxy groups at high redshifts using\nhigh-resolution, low-frequency radio surveys, such as those that will be\ncarried out with LOFAR and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). We identify a\nsub-population of morphologically regular powerful (FRII) radio galaxies and\ndemonstrate that, for this sub-population, the internal pressure of the radio\nlobes is a reliable tracer of the external intragroup/intracluster medium (ICM)\npressure, and that the assumption of a universal pressure profile for relaxed\ngroups enables the total mass and X-ray luminosity to be estimated. Using a\nsample of well-studied FRII radio galaxies, we demonstrate that our method\nenables the estimation of group/cluster X-ray luminosities over three orders of\nmagnitude in luminosity to within a factor of ~2 from low-frequency radio\nproperties alone. Our method could provide a powerful new tool for building\nsamples of thousands of evolved galaxy groups at z>1 and characterizing their\nICM.\n", "  We report the discovery of water maser emission at frequencies above 1 THz.\nUsing the GREAT instrument on SOFIA, we have detected emission in the 1.296411\nTHz 8(27)-7(34) transition of water toward three oxygen-rich evolved stars: W\nHya, U Her, and VY CMa. An upper limit on the 1.296 THz line flux was obtained\ntoward R Aql. Near-simultaneous observations of the 22.23508 GHz 6(16)-5(23)\nwater maser transition were carried out towards all four sources using the\nEffelsberg 100m telescope. The measured line fluxes imply 22 GHz / 1.296 THz\nphoton luminosity ratios of 0.012, 0.12, and 0.83 respectively for W Hya, U\nHer, and VY CMa, values that confirm the 22 GHz maser transition to be\nunsaturated in W Hya and U Her. We also detected the 1.884888 THz 8(45)-7(53)\ntransition toward W Hya and VY CMa, and the 1.278266 THz 7(43)-6(52) transition\ntoward VY CMa. Like the 22 GHz maser transition, all three of the THz emission\nlines detected here originate from the ortho-H2O spin isomer. Based upon a\nmodel for the circumstellar envelope of W Hya, we estimate that stimulated\nemission is responsible for ~ 85% of the observed 1.296 THz line emission, and\nthus that this transition may be properly described as a terahertz-frequency\nmaser. In the case of the 1.885 THz transition, by contrast, our W Hya model\nindicates that the observed emission is dominated by spontaneous radiative\ndecay, even though a population inversion exists.\n", "  We present an extragalactic survey using observations from the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to characterise galaxy populations up to\n$z=0.35$: the Valpara\\'iso ALMA Line Emission Survey (VALES). We use ALMA\nBand-3 CO(1--0) observations to study the molecular gas content in a sample of\n67 dusty normal star-forming galaxies selected from the $Herschel$\nAstrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey ($H$-ATLAS). We have spectrally\ndetected 49 galaxies at $>5\\sigma$ significance and 12 others are seen at low\nsignificance in stacked spectra. CO luminosities are in the range of\n$(0.03-1.31)\\times10^{10}$ K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$, equivalent to $\\log({\\rm\nM_{gas}/M_{\\odot}}) =8.9-10.9$ assuming an $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$=4.6(K km s$^{-1}$\npc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$, which perfectly complements the parameter space previously\nexplored with local and high-z normal galaxies. We compute the optical to CO\nsize ratio for 21 galaxies resolved by ALMA at $\\sim 3$.\"$5$ resolution (6.5\nkpc), finding that the molecular gas is on average $\\sim$ 0.6 times more\ncompact than the stellar component. We obtain a global Schmidt-Kennicutt\nrelation, given by $\\log [\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}/({\\rm M_{\\odot}\nyr^{-1}kpc^{-2}})]=(1.26 \\pm 0.02) \\times \\log [\\Sigma_{\\rm M_{H2}}/({\\rm\nM_{\\odot}\\,pc^{-2}})]-(3.6 \\pm 0.2)$. We find a significant fraction of\ngalaxies lying at `intermediate efficiencies' between a long-standing mode of\nstar-formation activity and a starburst, specially at $\\rm L_{IR}=10^{11-12}\nL_{\\odot}$. Combining our observations with data taken from the literature, we\npropose that star formation efficiencies can be parameterised by $\\log [{\\rm\nSFR/M_{H2}}]=0.19 \\times {\\rm (\\log {L_{IR}}-11.45)}-8.26-0.41 \\times\n\\arctan[-4.84 (\\log {\\rm L_{IR}}-11.45) ]$. Within the redshift range we\nexplore ($z<0.35$), we identify a rapid increase of the gas content as a\nfunction of redshift.\n", "  We present the detection of long-period RV variations in HD 36384, HD 52030,\nand HD 208742 by using the high-resolution, fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory\nEchelle Spectrograph (BOES) for the precise radial velocity (RV) survey of\nabout 200 northern circumpolar stars. Analyses of RV data, chromospheric\nactivity indicators, and bisector variations spanning about five years suggest\nthat the RV variations are compatible with planet or brown dwarf companions in\nKeplerian motion. However, HD 36384 shows photometric variations with a period\nvery close to that of RV variations as well as amplitude variations in the\nweighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) analysis, which argues that the RV\nvariations in HD~36384 are from the stellar pulsations. Assuming that the\ncompanion hypothesis is correct, HD~52030 hosts a companion with minimum mass\n13.3 M_Jup$ orbiting in 484 days at a distance of 1.2 AU. HD~208742 hosts a\ncompanion of 14.0 M_Jup at 1.5 AU with a period of 602 days. All stars are\nlocated at the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage on the H-R diagram after\nundergone the helium flash and left the giant clump.With stellar radii of 53.0\nR_Sun and 57.2 R_Sun for HD 52030 and HD 208742, respectively, these stars may\nbe the largest yet, in terms of stellar radius, found to host sub-stellar\ncompanions. However, given possible RV amplitude variations and the fact that\nthese are highly evolved stars the planet hypothesis is not yet certain.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of a H$_2$-rich, extremely strong intervening\nDamped Ly-$\\alpha$ Absorption system (DLA) at $z_{\\rm abs}=2.786$ towards the\nquasar J$\\,$0843+0221, observed with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle\nSpectrograph on the Very Large Telescope. The total column density of molecular\n(resp. atomic) hydrogen is $\\log N$(H$_2$)=$21.21\\pm0.02$ (resp. $\\log\nN$(H$\\,$I)=$21.82\\pm0.11$), making it to be the first case in quasar absorption\nlines studies with H$_2$ column density as high as what is seen in\n$^{13}$CO-selected clouds in the Milky-Way.\n  We find that this system has one of the lowest metallicity detected among\nH$_2$-bearing DLAs, with $\\rm [Zn/H]=-1.52^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$. This can be the\nreason for the marked differences compared to systems with similar H$_2$ column\ndensities in the local Universe: $(i)$ the kinetic temperature, $T\\sim$120~K,\nderived from the $J=0,1$ H$_2$ rotational levels is at least twice higher than\nexpected; $(ii)$ there is little dust extinction with A$_V < 0.1$; $(iii)$ no\nCO molecules are detected, putting a constraint on the $X_{\\rm CO}$ factor\n$X_{\\rm CO}> 2\\times 10^{23} $ cm$^{-2}$/(km/s\\,K), in the very low metallicity\ngas. Low CO and high H$_2$ contents indicate that this system represents\n\"CO-dark/faint\" gas.\n  We investigate the physical conditions in the H$_2$-bearing gas using the\nfine-structure levels of C$\\,$I, C$\\,$II, Si$\\,$II and the rotational levels of\nHD and H$_2$. We find the number density to be about $n \\sim\n260-380\\,$cm$^{-3}$, implying a high thermal pressure of $(3-5) \\times\n10^4\\,$cm$^{-3}\\,$K. We further identify a trend of increasing pressure with\nincreasing total hydrogen column density. This independently supports the\nsuggestion that extremely strong DLAs (with $\\log\\,$N(H) $\\sim 22$) probe\nhigh-z galaxies at low impact parameters.\n", "  We present the method and observations for the measurement of the\nExtragalactic Background Light (EBL) utilizing the shadowing effect of a dark\ncloud. We measure the surface brightness difference between the opaque cloud\ncore and its unobscured surroundings. In the difference the large atmospheric\nand Zodiacal light components are eliminated and the only remaining foreground\ncomponent is the scattered starlight from the cloud itself. Although much\nsmaller, its separation is the key problem in the method. For its separation we\nuse spectroscopy. While the scattered starlight has the characteristic\nFraunhofer lines and 400 nm discontinuity the EBL spectrum is smooth and\nwithout these features. Medium resolution spectrophotometry at $\\lambda$ = 380\n- 580 nm was performed with ${VLT}$/FORS at ESO of the surface brightness in\nand around the high-galactic-latitude dark cloud Lynds 1642. Besides the\nspectrum for the core with $A_V \\ge 15$ mag, further spectra were obtained for\nintermediate-opacity cloud positions. They are used as proxy for the spectrum\nof the impinging starlight spectrum and facilitate the separation of the\nscattered starlight (cf. Paper II, Mattila et al. 2017b). Our spectra reach a\nprecision of $\\sim 0.5$ $10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$\\AA$^{-1}$ as\nrequired to measure an EBL intensity in range of $\\sim$1 to a few times\n$10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$\\AA$^{-1}$. Because all surface\nbrightness components are measured using the same equipment the method does not\nrequire unusually high absolute calibration accuracy, a condition which has\nbeen a problem for some previous EBL projects\n", "  The level of solar magnetic activity, as exemplified by the number of\nsunspots and by energetic events in the corona, varies on a wide range of time\nscales. Most prominent is the 11-year solar cycle, which is significantly\nmodulated on longer time scales. Drawing from dynamo theory together with\nempirical results of past solar activity and of similar phenomena on solar-like\nstars, we show that the variability of the solar cycle can be essentially\nunderstood in terms of a weakly nonlinear limit cycle affected by random noise.\nIn contrast to ad-hoc `toy models' for the solar cycle, this leads to a generic\nnormal-form model, whose parameters are all constrained by observations. The\nmodel reproduces the characteristics of the variable solar activity on time\nscales between decades and millennia, including the occurrence and statistics\nof extended periods of very low activity (grand minima). Comparison with\nresults obtained with a Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo model confirms the\nvalidity of the normal-mode approach.\n", "  We report the existence of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at the\n(001) surface of CaTiO3. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we\nfind a hybridization between the d_xz and d_yz orbitals, not observed in the\n2DESs at the surfaces of other ATiO3 perovskites, e.g. SrTiO3 or BaTiO3. Based\non a comparison of the 2DES properties in these three materials, we show how\nthe electronic structure of the 2DES (bandwidth, orbital order and electron\ndensity) is coupled to different typical lattice distortions in perovskites.\nThe orbital hybridization in orthorhombic CaTiO3 results from the rotation of\nthe oxygen octahedra, which can also occur at the interface of oxide\nheterostructures to compensate strain. More generally, the control of the\norbital order in 2DES by choosing different A-site cations in perovskites\noffers a new gateway towards 2DESs in oxide heterostructures beyond SrTiO3.\n", "  We investigate the prevalence of AGN in the high-redshift protocluster\n$\\rm{Cl}\\,0218.3$-$0510$ at $z=1.62$. Using imaging from the Chandra X-ray\nTelescope, we find a large overdensity of AGN in the protocluster; a factor of\n$23\\pm9$ times the field density of AGN. Only half of this AGN overdensity is\ndue to the overdensity of massive galaxies in the protocluster (a factor of\n$11\\pm2$), as we find that $17^{+6}_{-5}\\%$ of massive galaxies ($M_* >\n10^{10}\\,\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$) in the protocluster host an X-ray luminous AGN,\ncompared to $8\\pm1\\%$ in the field. This corresponds to an enhancement of AGN\nactivity in massive protocluster galaxies by a factor of $2.1\\pm0.7$ at\n$1.6\\sigma$ significance. We also find that the AGN overdensity is centrally\nconcentrated, located within 3 arcmin and most pronounced within 1 arcmin of\nthe centre of the protocluster. Our results confirm that there is a reversal in\nthe local anti-correlation between galaxy density and AGN activity, so there is\nan enhancement of AGN in high-redshift protoclusters. We compare the properties\nof AGN in the protocluster to the field and find no significant differences in\nthe distributions of their stellar mass, X-ray luminosity, or hardness ratio.\nWe therefore suggest that triggering mechanisms are similar in both\nenvironments, and that the mechanisms simply occur more frequently in denser\nenvironments.\n", "  We present X-ray bolometric correction factors, $\\kappa_{Bol}$ ($\\equiv\nL_{Bol}/L_X$), for Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the aim\nof testing AGN torus models, probing orientation effects, and estimating the\nbolometric output of the most obscured AGN. We adopt bolometric luminosities,\n$L_{Bol}$, from literature infrared (IR) torus modeling and compile published\nintrinsic 2--10 keV X-ray luminosities, $L_{X}$, from X-ray torus modeling of\nNuSTAR data. Our sample consists of 10 local CT AGN where both of these\nestimates are available. We test for systematic differences in $\\kappa_{Bol}$\nvalues produced when using two widely used IR torus models and two widely used\nX-ray torus models, finding consistency within the uncertainties. We find that\nthe mean $\\kappa_{Bol}$ of our sample in the range\n$L_{Bol}\\approx10^{42}-10^{45}$ erg/s is log$_{10}\\kappa_{Bol}=1.44\\pm0.12$\nwith an intrinsic scatter of $\\sim0.2$ dex, and that our derived $\\kappa_{Bol}$\nvalues are consistent with previously established relationships between\n$\\kappa_{Bol}$ and $L_{Bol}$ and $\\kappa_{Bol}$ and Eddington ratio. We\ninvestigate if $\\kappa_{Bol}$ is dependent on $N_H$ by comparing our results on\nCT AGN to published results on less-obscured AGN, finding no significant\ndependence. Since many of our sample are megamaser AGN, known to be viewed\nedge-on, and furthermore under the assumptions of AGN unification whereby\nunobscured AGN are viewed face-on, our result implies that the X-ray emitting\ncorona is not strongly anisotropic. Finally, we present $\\kappa_{Bol}$ values\nfor CT AGN identified in X-ray surveys as a function of their observed $L_X$,\nwhere an estimate of their intrinsic $L_{X}$ is not available, and redshift,\nuseful for estimating the bolometric output of the most obscured AGN across\ncosmic time.\n", "  We compile a sample of spectroscopically- and photometrically-selected\ncluster galaxies from four high-redshift galaxy clusters ($1.59 < z < 1.71$)\nfrom the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS), and a\ncomparison field sample selected from the UKIDSS Deep Survey. Using\nnear-infrared imaging from the \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} we classify\npotential mergers involving massive ($M_* \\geq 3\\times\n10^{10}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) cluster members by eye, based on morphological\nproperties such as tidal distortions, double nuclei, and projected near\nneighbors within 20 kpc. With a catalogue of 23 spectroscopic and 32\nphotometric massive cluster members across the four clusters and 65\nspectroscopic and 26 photometric comparable field galaxies, we find that after\ntaking into account contamination from interlopers, $11.0 ^{+7.0}_{-5.6}\\%$ of\nthe cluster members are involved in potential mergers, compared to\n$24.7^{+5.3}_{-4.6}\\%$ of the field galaxies. We see no evidence of merger\nenhancement in the central cluster environment with respect to the field,\nsuggesting that galaxy-galaxy merging is not a stronger source of galaxy\nevolution in cluster environments compared to the field at these redshifts.\n", "  We obtained an optical spectrum of a star we identify as the optical\ncounterpart of the M31 Chandra source CXO J004318.8+412016, because of\nprominent emission lines of the Balmer series, of neutral helium, and a He II\nline at 4686 Angstrom. The continuum energy distribution and the spectral\ncharacteristics demonstrate the presence of a red giant of K or earlier\nspectral type, so we concluded that the binary is likely to be a symbiotic\nsystem. CXO J004318.8+412016 has been observed in X-rays as a luminous\nsupersoft source (SSS) since 1979, with effective temperature exceeding 40 eV\nand variable X-ray luminosity, oscillating between a few times 10(35) erg/s and\na few times 10(37) erg/s. The optical, infrared and ultraviolet colors of the\noptical object are consistent with an an accretion disk around a compact object\ncompanion, which may either be a white dwarf, or a black hole, depending on the\nsystem parameters. If the origin of the luminous supersoft X-rays is the\natmosphere of a white dwarf that is burning hydrogen in shell, it is as hot and\nluminous as post-thermonuclear flash novae, yet no major optical outburst has\never been observed, suggesting that the white dwarf is very massive (m>1.2\nM(sol)) and it is accreting and burning at the high rate\n(mdot>10(-8)M(sol)/year) expected for type Ia supernovae progenitors. In this\ncase, the X-ray variability may be due to a very short recurrence time of only\nmildly degenerate thermonuclear flashes.\n", "  We describe a new technique to measure the height of the X-ray limb with\nobservations from occulted X-ray flare sources as observed by the RHESSI (the\nReuven Ramaty High-Energy Spectroscopic Imager) satellite. This method has\nmodel dependencies different from those present in traditional observations at\noptical wavelengths, which depend upon detailed modeling involving radiative\ntransfer in a medium with complicated geometry and flows. It thus provides an\nindependent and more rigorous measurement of the \"true\" solar radius, meaning\nthat of the mass distribution. RHESSI's measurement makes use of the flare\nX-ray source's spatial Fourier components (the visibilities), which are\nsensitive to the presence of the sharp edge at the lower boundary of the\nocculted source. We have found a suitable flare event for analysis,\nSOL2011-10-20T03:25 (M1.7), and report a first result from this novel technique\nhere. Using a 4-minute integration over the 3-25 keV photon energy range, we\nfind $R_{\\mathrm{X-ray}} = 960.11\\ \\pm\\ 0.15 \\pm 0.29$ arcsec, at 1 AU, where\nthe uncertainties include statistical uncertainties from the method and a\nsystematic error. The standard VAL-C model predicts a value of 959.94 arcsec,\nabout 1$\\sigma$ below our value.\n", "  We report on the X-ray monitoring programme (covering slightly more than 11\ndays) carried out jointly by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR on the intermediate Seyfert\ngalaxy Mrk 915. The light curves extracted in different energy ranges show a\nvariation in intensity but not a significant change in spectral shape. The\nX-ray spectra reveal the presence of a two-phase warm absorber: a fully\ncovering mildly ionized structure [log xi/(erg cm/s)~2.3, NH~1.3x10^21 cm-2]\nand a partial covering (~90 per cent) lower ionized one [log xi/(erg cm/s)~0.6,\nNH~2x10^22 cm-2]. A reflection component from distant matter is also present.\nFinally, a high-column density (NH~1.5x10^23 cm-2) distribution of neutral\nmatter covering a small fraction of the central region is observed, almost\nconstant, in all observations. Main driver of the variations observed between\nthe datasets is a decrease in the intrinsic emission by a factor of ~1.5.\nSlight variations in the partial covering ionized absorber are detected, while\nthe data are consistent with no variation of the total covering absorber. The\nmost likely interpretation of the present data locates this complex absorber\ncloser to the central source than the narrow line region, possibly in the broad\nline region, in the innermost part of the torus, or in between. The neutral\nobscurer may either be part of this same stratified structure or associated\nwith the walls of the torus, grazed by (and partially intercepting) the line of\nsight.\n", "  Lattice and magnetic dynamics of NiWO$_4$ single crystals were studied with\nthe use of polarized Raman spectroscopy in a wide temperature range of 10-300 K\nincluding the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature $T_N$=62 K. Static\nmagnetic measurements were used for characterizing the single crystals. All\nRaman-active phonons predicted by the group theory were observed and\ncharacterized. Magnetic symmetry analysis was used to determine possible\nmagnetic space groups for NiWO$_4$ which can be also applied to any other\nisostructural crystal with the same magnetic propagation vector k=(1/2,0,0).\nThough the magnetic structure of NiWO$_4$ is relatively simple, a rich set of\nnarrow and broad magnetic excitations with different polarization properties\nand temperature behavior in the very broad frequency range of 10-200 cm$^{-1}$\nwas observed, with some modes surviving at temperatures much higher than $T_N$\nup to 220 K. Part of the magnetic excitations was identified as acoustic and\noptical spin-wave branches which allow us to construct exchange structure and\nestimate exchange and anisotropy constants with the use of linear spin-wave\ntheory. Since the magnetic structure can be described as exchange-coupled AFM\nchains of $S=1$ ions, previously unobserved magnetic excitation at 24 cm$^{-1}$\nis tentatively assigned to a Haldane gap mode.\n", "  We analyze the long-term behavior of supergranule scale parameter, in active\nand quiet regions (AR, QR), using the Kodaikanal digitized data archive. This\ndatabase provides century-long daily full disc observations of the Sun in Ca-II\nK wavelength. In this paper, we study the distributions of the supergranular\nscales, over the whole data duration, which show identical shape in these two\nregimes. We found that the AR mean scale values are always higher than that of\nthe QR for every solar cycle. The mean scale values are highly correlated with\nthe sunspot number cycle amplitude and also with total solar irradiance (TSI)\nvariations. Such correlation establishes the cycle-wise mean scale as a\npotential calibrator for the historical data reconstructions. We also see an\nupward trend in the mean scales, as already been reported in TSI. This may\nprovide new input for climate forcing models. These results also give us\ninsight into the different evolutionary scenarios of the supergranules in the\npresence of strong (AR) and weak (QR) magnetic fields.\n", "  We present the analysis of an unusual failed eruption captured in high\ncadence and in many wavelengths during the observing campaign in support of the\nVAULT2.0 sounding rocket launch. The refurbished Very high Angular resolution\nUltraviolet Telescope (VAULT2.0) is a Ly$\\alpha$ ($\\lambda$ 1216 {\\AA})\nspectroheliograph launched on September 30, 2014. The campaign targeted active\nregion NOAA AR 12172 and was closely coordinated with the Hinode and IRIS\nmissions and several ground-based observatories (NSO/IBIS, SOLIS, and BBSO). A\nfilament eruption accompanied by a low level flaring event (at the GOES C-class\nlevel) occurred around the VAULT2.0 launch. No Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) was\nobserved. The eruption and its source region, however, were recorded by the\ncampaign instruments in many atmospheric heights ranging from the photosphere\nto the corona in high cadence and spatial resolution. This is a rare occasion\nwhich enables us to perform a comprehensive investigation on a failed eruption.\nWe find that a rising Magnetic Flux Rope-like (MFR) structure was destroyed\nduring its interaction with the ambient magnetic field creating downflows of\ncool plasma and diffuse hot coronal structures reminiscent of \"cusps\". We\nemploy magnetofrictional simulations to show that the magnetic topology of the\nambient field is responsible for the destruction of the MFR. Our unique\nobservations suggest that the magnetic topology of the corona is a key\ningredient for a successful eruption.\n", "  Observational investigations of the abundance of massive precursors of local\ngalaxy clusters (\"proto-clusters\") allow us to test the growth of density\nperturbations, to constrain cosmological parameters that control it, to test\nthe theory of non-linear collapse and how the galaxy formation takes place in\ndense environments. The Planck collaboration has recently published a catalogue\nof >~ 2000 cold extra-galactic sub-millimeter sources, i.e. with colours\nindicative of z >~ 2, almost all of which appear to be over-densities of\nstar-forming galaxies. They are thus considered as proto-cluster candidates.\nTheir number densities (or their flux densities) are far in excess of\nexpectations from the standard scenario for the evolution of large-scale\nstructure. Simulations based on a physically motivated galaxy evolution model\nshow that essentially all cold peaks brighter than S_{545GHz} = 500 mJy found\nin Planck maps after having removed the Galactic dust emission can be\ninterpreted as positive Poisson fluctuations of the number of high-z dusty\nproto-clusters within the same Planck beam, rather then being individual clumps\nof physically bound galaxies. This conclusion does not change if an empirical\nfit to the luminosity function of dusty galaxies is used instead of the\nphysical model. The simulations accurately reproduce the statistic of the\nPlanck detections and yield distributions of sizes and ellipticities in\nqualitative agreement with observations. The redshift distribution of the\nbrightest proto-clusters contributing to the cold peaks has a broad maximum at\n1.5 <~ z <~ 3. Therefore follow-up of Planck proto-cluster candidates will\nprovide key information on the high-z evolution of large scale structure.\n", "  Analyzing the 3D structure of the molecular gas distribution in the central\n200 pc region of the Galaxy, we show that the expanding molecular ring (EMR,\nalso known as the parallelogram) and the central molecular zone (CMZ) exhibit\nquite different distributions and kinematics. The EMR composes a bipolar\nvertical cylinder with the total length as long as $\\sim 170$ pc and shows\nlarge non-circular velocities. On the contrary, the CMZ is distributed in a\nnearly rigid-body rotating ring and arms tightly concentrated near the galactic\nplane with full thickness less than $\\sim 30$ pc. Furthermore, the mass and\ndensity ratios of the EMR to CMZ are as small as $\\sim 0.13$ and $0.04$,\nrespectively. We discuss the origins of the EMR and CMZ based on the bar and\nexplosion models. We suggest that the EMR's large vertical extent can be\nexplained by a cylindrical shock wave model driven by an explosive activity in\nthe Galactic Centre.\n", "  The multi-level system $^{55}$Mn$^{2+}$ is used to generate two\npseudo-harmonic level systems, as representations of the same electronic\nsextuplet at different nuclear spin projections. The systems are coupled using\na forbidden nuclear transition induced by the crystalline anisotropy. We\ndemonstrate Rabi oscillations between the two representations in conditions\nsimilar to two coupled quasi-harmonic quantum oscillators. Rabi oscillations\nare performed at a detuned pumping frequency which matches energy difference\nbetween electro-nuclear states of different oscillators. We measure a coupling\nstronger than the decoherence rate, to indicate the possibility fast\ninformation exchange between the systems.\n", "  We present the results of a narrow-band near-infrared imaging survey for\nMolecular Hydrogen emission-line Objects (MHOs) toward 26 regions containing\nhigh-mass protostellar candidates and massive molecular outflows. We have\ndetected a total of 236 MHOs, 156 of which are new detections, in 22 out of the\n26 regions. We use H$_2$ 2.12-$\\mu$m/H$_2$ 2.25-$\\mu$m flux ratios, together\nwith morphology, to separate the signatures of fluorescence associated with\nphoto-dissociation regions (PDRs) from shocks associated with outflows in order\nto identify the MHOs. PDRs have typical low flux ratios of ~ 1.5 - 3, while the\nvast majority of MHOs display flux ratios typical of C-type shocks (~ 6-20). A\nfew MHOs exhibit flux ratios consistent with expected values for J-type shocks\n(~ 3-4), but these are located in regions that may be contaminated with\nfluorescent emission. Some previously reported MHOs have low flux ratios, and\nare likely parts of PDRs rather than shocks indicative of outflows. We identify\na total of 36 outflows across the 22 target regions where MHOs were detected.\nIn over half these regions, MHO arrangements and fluorescent structures trace\nfeatures present in CO outflow maps, suggesting the CO emission traces a\ncombination of dynamical effects, which may include gas entrained in expanding\nPDRs as well as bipolar outflows. Where possible, we link MHO complexes to\ndistinct outflows and identify candidate driving sources.\n", "  In studies of the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their\nhost galaxies there is widespread disagreement on some key aspects stemming\nlargely from a lack of understanding of the nature of the full underlying AGN\npopulation. Recent attempts to probe this connection utilize both observations\nand simulations to correct for a missed population, but presently are limited\nby intrinsic biases and complicated models. We take a simple simulation for\ngalaxy evolution and add a new prescription for AGN activity to connect galaxy\ngrowth to dark matter halo properties and AGN activity to star formation. We\nexplicitly model selection effects to produce an \"observed\" AGN population for\ncomparison with observations and empirically motivated models of the local\nuniverse. This allows us to bypass the difficulties inherent in many models\nwhich attempt to infer the AGN population by inverting selection effects. We\ninvestigate the impact of selecting AGN based on thresholds in luminosity or\nEddington ratio on the \"observed\" AGN population. By limiting our model AGN\nsample in luminosity, we are able to recreate the observed local AGN luminosity\nfunction and specific star formation-stellar mass distribution, and show that\nusing an Eddington ratio threshold introduces less bias into the sample by\nselecting the full range of growing black holes, despite the challenge of\nselecting low mass black holes. We find that selecting AGN using these various\nthresholds yield samples with different AGN host galaxy properties.\n", "  Massive clumps, prior to the formation of any visible protostars, are the\nbest candidates to search for the elusive massive starless cores. In this work\nwe investigate the dust and gas properties of massive clumps selected to be 70\nmicron quiet, therefore good starless candidates. Our sample of 18 clumps has\nmasses 300 < M < 3000 M_sun, radius 0.54 < R < 1.00 pc, surface densities Sigma\n> 0.05 g cm^-2 and luminosity/mass ratio L/M < 0.3. We show that half of these\n70 micron quiet clumps embed faint 24 micron sources. Comparison with GLIMPSE\ncounterparts shows that 5 clumps embed young stars of intermediate stellar mass\nup to ~5.5 M_sun. We study the clump dynamics with observations of N2H+ (1-0),\nHNC (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) made with the IRAM 30m telescope. Seven clumps have\nblue-shifted spectra compatible with infall signatures, for which we estimate a\nmass accretion rate 0.04 < M_dot < 2.0 x 10^-3 M_sun yr^-1, comparable with\nvalues found in high-mass protostellar regions, and free-fall time of the order\nof t_ff = 3 x 10^5 yr. The only appreciable difference we find between objects\nwith and without embedded 24 micron sources is that the infall rate appears to\nincrease from 24 micron dark to 24 micron bright objects. We conclude that all\n70 micron quiet objects have similar properties on clump scales, independently\nof the presence of an embedded protostar. Based on our data we speculate that\nthe majority, if not all of these clumps may already embed faint, low-mass\nprotostellar cores. If these clumps are to form massive stars, this must occur\nafter the formation of these lower mass stars.\n", "  The process of radiative feedback in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) is an\nimportant mechanism for limiting star cluster formation through the heating and\nionization of the surrounding gas. We explore the degree to which radiative\nfeedback affects early ($\\lesssim$5 Myr) cluster formation in GMCs having\nmasses that range from 10$^{4-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$ using the FLASH code. The\ninclusion of radiative feedback lowers the efficiency of cluster formation by\n20-50\\% relative to hydrodynamic simulations. Two models in particular ---\n5$\\times$10$^4$ and 10$^5$ M$_{\\odot}$ --- show the largest suppression of the\ncluster formation efficiency, corresponding to a factor of $\\sim$2. For these\nclouds only, the internal energy, a measure of the energy injected by radiative\nfeedback, exceeds the gravitational potential for a significant amount of time.\nWe find a clear relation between the maximum cluster mass, M$_{cl,max}$, formed\nin a GMC of mass M$_{GMC}$; M$_{cl,max}\\propto$ M$_{GMC}^{0.81}$. This scaling\nresult suggests that young globular clusters at the necessary scale of $10^6\nM_{\\odot}$ form within host GMCs of masses near $\\sim 5 \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$.\nWe compare simulated cluster mass distributions to the observed embedded\ncluster mass function ($dlog(N)/dlog(M) \\propto M^{\\beta}$ where $\\beta$ = -1)\nand find good agreement ($\\beta$ = -0.99$\\pm$0.14) only for simulations\nincluding radiative feedback, indicating this process is important in\ncontrolling the growth of young clusters. However, the high star formation\nefficiencies, which range from 16-21\\%, and high star formation rates compared\nto locally observed regions suggest other feedback mechanisms are also\nimportant during the formation and growth of stellar clusters.\n", "  Strain presents a straightforward tool to tune electronic properties of\natomically thin nanomaterials that are highly sensitive to lattice\ndeformations. While the influence of strain on the electronic band structure\nhas been intensively studied, there are only few works on its impact on optical\nproperties of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Combining\nmicroscopic theory based on Wannier and Bloch equations with nearestneighbor\ntight-binding approximation, we present an analytical view on how uni- and\nbiaxial strain influences the optical fingerprint of TMDs including their\nexcitonic binding energy, oscillator strength, optical selection rules, and the\nradiative broadening of excitonic resonances. We show that the impact of strain\ncan be reduced to changes in the lattice structure (geometric effect) and in\nthe orbital functions (overlap effect). In particular, we demonstrate that the\nvalley-selective optical selection rule is softened in the case of uniaxial\nstrain due to the introduced asymmetry in the lattice structure. Furthermore,\nwe reveal a considerable increase of the radiative dephasing due to\nstrain-induced changes in the optical matrix element and the excitonic wave\nfunctions.\n", "  The L1544 pre-stellar core was observed as part of the ASAI (Astrochemical\nSurveys At IRAM) Large Program. We report the first detection in a pre-stellar\ncore of the HCNH$^+$ and HC$_3$NH$^+$ ions. The high spectral resolution of the\nobservations allows to resolve the hyperfine structure of HCNH$^+$. Local\nthermodynamic equilibrium analysis leads to derive a column density equal to\n(2.0$\\pm$0.2)$\\times$10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ for HCNH$^+$ and\n(1.5$\\pm$0.5)$\\times$10$^{11}$cm$^{-2}$ for HC$_3$NH$^+$. We also present\nnon-LTE analysis of five transitions of HC$_3$N, three transitions of\nH$^{13}$CN and one transition of HN$^{13}$C, all of them linked to the\nchemistry of HCNH$^+$ and HC$_3$NH$^+$. We computed for HC$_3$N, HCN, and HNC a\ncolumn density of (2.0$\\pm$0.4)$\\times$10$^{13}$cm$^{-2}$,\n(3.6$\\pm$0.9)$\\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$, and\n(3.0$\\pm$1.0)$\\times$10$^{14}$cm$^{-2}$, respectively. We used the gas-grain\nchemical code Nautilus to predict the abundances all these species across the\npre-stellar core. Comparison of the observations with the model predictions\nsuggests that the emission from HCNH$^+$ and HC$_3$NH$^+$ originates in the\nexternal layer where non-thermal desorption of other species was previously\nobserved. The observed abundance of both ionic species\n([HCNH$^+$]$\\,\\simeq3\\times10^{-10}$ and\n[HC$_3$NH$^+$]$\\,\\simeq[1.5-3.0]\\times10^{-12}$, with respect to H$_2$) cannot\nbe reproduced at the same time by the chemical modelling, within the error bars\nof the observations only. We discuss the possible reasons for the discrepancy\nand suggest that the current chemical models are not fully accurate or\ncomplete. However, the modelled abundances are within a factor of three\nconsistent with the observations, considering a late stage of the evolution of\nthe pre-stellar core, compatible with previous observations.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of an arbitrary quantum system coupled to a large\narbitrary and fully quantum mechanical environment through a random\ninteraction. We establish analytically and check numerically the typicality of\nthis dynamics, in other words the fact that the reduced density matrix of the\nsystem has a self-averaging property. This phenomenon, which lies in a\ngeneralized central limit theorem, justifies rigorously averaging procedures\nover certain classes of random interactions and can explain the absence of\nsensitivity to microscopic details of irreversible processes such as\nthermalisation. It provides more generally a new ergodic principle for embedded\nquantum systems.\n", "  A parity invariant theory, consisting of two massive Dirac fields, defined in\nthree dimensional space-time, with the confinement of a certain current is\nstudied. It is found that the electromagnetic field, when coupled minimally to\nthese Dirac fields, becomes massive owing to the current confinement. It is\nseen that the origin of photon mass is not due to any kind of spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking, but only due to current confinement.\n", "  Boxy/peanut bulges are considered to be part of the same stellar structure as\nbars and both could be linked through the buckling instability. The Milky Way\nis our closest example. The goal of this letter is determining if the mass\nassembly of the different components leaves an imprint in their stellar\npopulations allowing to estimate the time of bar formation and its evolution.\nTo this aim we use integral field spectroscopy to derive the stellar age\ndistributions, SADs, along the bar and disc of NGC 6032. The analysis shows\nclearly different SADs for the different bar areas. There is an underlying old\n(>=12 Gyr) stellar population for the whole galaxy. The bulge shows star\nformation happening at all times. The inner bar structure shows stars of ages\nolder than 6 Gyrs with a deficit of younger populations. The outer bar region\npresents a SAD similar to that of the disc. To interpret our results, we use a\ngeneric numerical simulation of a barred galaxy. Thus, we constrain, for the\nfirst time, the epoch of bar formation, the buckling instability period and the\nposterior growth from disc material. We establish that the bar of NGC 6032 is\nold, formed around 10 Gyr ago while the buckling phase possibly happened around\n8 Gyr ago. All these results point towards bars being long-lasting even in the\npresence of gas.\n", "  We report the first detection of a substantial brightening event in an\nisotopologue of a key molecular ion, HCO$^+$, within a protoplanetary disk of a\nT Tauri star. The H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $J=3-2$ rotational transition was observed\nthree times toward IM Lup between July 2014 and May 2015 with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array. The first two observations show similar spectrally integrated\nline and continuum fluxes, while the third observation shows a doubling in the\ndisk integrated $J=3-2$ line flux compared to the continuum, which does not\nchange between the three epochs. We explore models of an X-ray active star\nirradiating the disk via stellar flares, and find that the optically thin\nH$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission variation can potentially be explained via X-ray driven\nchemistry temporarily enhancing the HCO$^+$ abundance in the upper layers of\nthe disk atmosphere during large or prolonged flaring events. If the HCO$^+$\nenhancement is indeed caused by a X-ray flare, future observations should be\nable to spatially resolve these events and potentially enable us to watch the\nchemical aftermath of the high-energy stellar radiation propagating across the\nface of protoplanetary disks, providing a new pathway to explore ionization\nphysics and chemistry, including electron density, in disks.\n", "  We present radial velocity measurements for 70 high confidence, and 34\npotential binary systems in fields containing the Perseus Molecular Cloud,\nPleiades, NGC 2264, and the Orion A star forming region. 18 of these systems\nhave been previously identified as binaries in the literature. Candidate\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) are identified by analyzing the\ncross-correlation functions (CCFs) computed during the reduction of each APOGEE\nspectrum. We identify sources whose CCFs are well fit as the sum of two\nLorentzians as likely binaries, and provide an initial characterization of the\nsystem based on the radial velocities indicated by that dual fit. For systems\nobserved over several epochs, we present mass ratios and systemic velocities;\nfor two systems with observations on eight or more epochs, and which meet our\ncriteria for robust orbital coverage, we derive initial orbital parameters. The\ndistribution of mass ratios for multi-epoch sources in our sample peaks at q=1,\nbut with a significant tail toward lower q values. Tables reporting radial\nvelocities, systemic velocities, and mass ratios are provided online. We\ndiscuss future improvements to the radial velocity extraction method we employ,\nas well as limitations imposed by the number of epochs currently available in\nthe APOGEE database. The Appendix contains brief notes from the literature on\neach system in the sample, and more extensive notes for select sources of\ninterest.\n", "  Several globular clusters (GCs) in the Galaxy are observed to show internal\nabundance spreads in r-process elements (e.g., Eu). We here propose a new\nscenario which explains the origin of these GCs (e.g., M5 and M15). In this\nscenario, stars with no/little abundance variations first form from a massive\nmolecular cloud (MC). After all of the remaining gas of the MC is expelled by\nnumerous supernovae, gas ejected from asymptotic giant branch stars can be\naccumulated in the central region of the GC to form a high-density\nintra-cluster medium (ICM). Merging of neutron stars then occurs to eject\nr-process elements, which can be efficiently trapped in and subsequently mixed\nwith the ICM. New stars formed from the ICM can have r-process abundances quite\ndifferent from those of earlier generations of stars within the GC. This\nscenario can explain both (i) why r-process elements can be trapped within GCs\nand (ii) why GCs with internal abundance spreads in r-process elements do not\nshow [Fe/H] spreads. Our model shows that (i) a large fraction of Eu-rich stars\ncan be seen in Na-enhanced stellar populations of GCs, as observed in M15, and\n(ii) why most of the Galactic GCs do not exhibit such internal abundance\nspreads. Our model demonstrates that the observed internal spreads of\n$r$-process elements in GCs provide strong evidence for prolonged star\nformation (~10^8 yr).\n", "  Based on the Chandra data archive as of March 2016, we have identified 314\ncandidate active galactic nuclei in 719 galaxies located closer than 50 Mpc,\namong them late-type (Hubble types Sc and later) galaxies that previously had\nbeen classified from optical observations as containing star-forming (H II)\nnuclei. These late-type galaxies comprise a valuable subsample to search for\nlow-mass (<~ 10^6 solar masses) central black holes. For the sample as a whole,\nthe overall dependence of the fraction of active nuclei on galaxy type and\nnuclear spectral classification is consistent with previous results based on\noptical surveys. We detect 51 X-ray cores among the 163 H II nuclei and\nestimate that, very conservatively, ~74% of them with luminosities above 10^38\nerg/s are not contaminated by X-ray binaries; the fraction increases to ~92%\nfor X-ray cores with a luminosity of 10^39 erg/s or higher. This allows us to\nestimate a black hole occupation fraction of >~ 21% in these late-type, many\nbulgeless, galaxies.\n", "  Kepler-452b is currently the best example of an Earth-size planet in the\nhabitable zone of a sun-like star, a type of planet whose number of detections\nis expected to increase in the future. Searching for biosignatures in the\nsupposedly thin atmospheres of these planets is a challenging goal that\nrequires a careful selection of the targets. Under the assumption of a\nrocky-dominated nature for Kepler-452b, we considered it as a test case to\ncalculate a temperature-dependent habitability index, $h_{050}$, designed to\nmaximize the potential presence of biosignature-producing activity (Silva et\nal.\\ 2016). The surface temperature has been computed for a broad range of\nclimate factors using a climate model designed for terrestrial-type exoplanets\n(Vladilo et al.\\ 2015). After fixing the planetary data according to the\nexperimental results (Jenkins et al.\\ 2015), we changed the surface gravity,\nCO$_2$ abundance, surface pressure, orbital eccentricity, rotation period, axis\nobliquity and ocean fraction within the range of validity of our model. For\nmost choices of parameters we find habitable solutions with $h_{050}>0.2$ only\nfor CO$_2$ partial pressure $p_\\mathrm{CO_2} \\lesssim 0.04$\\,bar. At this\nlimiting value of CO$_2$ abundance the planet is still habitable if the total\npressure is $p \\lesssim 2$\\,bar. In all cases the habitability drops for\neccentricity $e \\gtrsim 0.3$. Changes of rotation period and obliquity affect\nthe habitability through their impact on the equator-pole temperature\ndifference rather than on the mean global temperature. We calculated the\nvariation of $h_{050}$ resulting from the luminosity evolution of the host star\nfor a wide range of input parameters. Only a small combination of parameters\nyield habitability-weighted lifetimes $\\gtrsim 2$\\,Gyr, sufficiently long to\ndevelop atmospheric biosignatures still detectable at the present time.\n", "  The jet activity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and its interaction with\nthe interstellar medium (ISM), may play a pivotal role in the processes which\nregulate the growth and star formation of its host galaxy. Observational\nevidence which pinpoints the conditions of such interaction is paramount to\nunveil the physical processes involved. We report on the discovery of extended\nemission line regions exhibiting an S-shaped morphology along the optical jet\nof the radio-loud AGN $\\text{PKS}\\,0521-365$ ($z=0.055$), by using long-slit\nspectroscopic observations obtained with FORS2 on VLT. The velocity pattern\nderived from the $\\text{[O II]}\\,\\lambda 3727\\,\\AA,\\, \\text{H}\\beta\\, \\lambda\n4861\\,\\AA\\,$ and [O III] $\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007\\,\\AA\\,$ emission lines is\nwell-fitted by a sinusoidal function of the form: $v(r)=\\alpha r^{1/2}sin(\\beta\nr^{1/2}+\\gamma)$, suggesting helicoidal motions along the jet up to distances\nof $20\\,\\text{kpc}$. We estimate a lower limit for the mass of the outflowing\nionized gas along the jet of $\\sim$10$^4\\,M_\\odot$. Helical magnetic fields and\njet precession have been proposed to explain helicoidal paths along the jet at\npc scales; nevertheless, it is not clear yet whether these hypotheses may hold\nat kpc scales.\n", "  Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei, i.e. L_bol/L_edd ~ 10^-6 - 10^-3,\nconstitute the bulk population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Powerful jets,\ncommon in these objects, are a crucial source of feedback energy driving mass\noutflows into the host galaxy and the intergalactic medium. This paper reports\nthe first direct measurement of powerful mass outflows traced by the forbidden\nhigh ionization gas in the low luminosity AGN NGC1386 at scales of a few\nparsecs from the central engine. The high angular resolution of the data allows\nus to directly measure the location, morphology and kinematic of the outflow.\nThis the form of two symmetrical expanding hot gas shells moving in opposite\ndirections along the line of sight. The co-spatiality of the gas shells with\nradio emission seen at the same parsec scales and with X-rays indicates that\nthis is a shock-driven outflow induced by an incipient core-jet. With a minimum\nnumber of assumptions, we derive a mass outflow rate of 11 solar masses/yr,\ncomparable to those of powerful AGN. The result has strong implications in the\nglobal accounting of feedback mass and energy driven by a low-luminosity AGN\ninto the medium and the corresponding galaxy evolution.\n", "  We observed 6 He-clump stars of the intermediate-age stellar cluster Gaia1\nwith the MIKE/MAGELLAN spectrograph. A possible extra-galactic origin of this\ncluster, recently discovered thanks to the first data release of the ESA Gaia\nmission, has been suggested, based on its orbital parameters. Abundances for\nFe, alpha, proton- and neutron-capture elements have been obtained. We find no\nevidence of intrinsic abundance spreads. The iron abundance is solar\n([FeI/H]=+0.00 +-0.01; sigma = 0.03 dex). All the other abundance ratios are,\nby and large, solar-scaled, similar to the Galactic thin disk and open clusters\nstars of similar metallicity. The chemical composition of Gaia1 does not\nsupport an extra-galactic origin for this stellar cluster, that can be\nconsidered as a standard Galactic open cluster.\n", "  We present a detailed hydrodynamic model that matches the present structure\nof the well-observed preplanetary nebula OH231.8+04.2. The purpose of the model\nis to present a physically justified and coherent picture of its evolutionary\nhistory from about 100 years of the start of the formation of its complex outer\nstructures to the present. We have adopted a set of initial conditions that are\nheavily constrained by high-quality observations of its present structure and\nkinematics. The shaping of the nebula occurs while the densities of the flows\nare \"light\": less than the surrounding AGB-wind environment. The simulations\nshow that pairs of essentially coeval clumps and sprays of the same extent and\ndensity but different outflow speeds sculpted both the pair of thin axial flow\n\"or spine\" and the bulbs. The total ejected mass and momentum in the best fit\nmodel are surprisingly large -- 3 M_sun and 2.2 x 10^41 gm cm s-1, respectively\n-- however, these values are reduced by up to a factor of ten in other models\nthat fit the data almost as well. Our ultimate goal is to combine the present\nmodel results of masses, momenta, flow speeds, and flow geometries for OH231\nwith those of other models to be published in the future in order to find\ncommon attributes of their ejection histories.\n", "  Black holes with accretion rates well below the Eddington rate are expected\nto be surrounded by low-density, hot, geometrically thick accretion disks. This\nincludes the two black holes being imaged at sub-horizon resolution by the\nEvent Horizon Telescope. In these disks, the mean free path for Coulomb\ninteractions between charged particles is large, and the accreting matter is a\nnearly collisionless plasma. Despite this, numerical simulations have so far\nmodeled these accretion flows using ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Here, we\npresent the first global, general relativistic, 3D simulations of accretion\nflows onto a Kerr black hole including the non-ideal effects most likely to\naffect the dynamics of the disk: the anisotropy between the pressure parallel\nand perpendicular to the magnetic field, and the heat flux along magnetic field\nlines. We show that for both standard and magnetically arrested disks, the\npressure anisotropy is comparable to the magnetic pressure, while the heat flux\nremains dynamically unimportant. Despite this large pressure anisotropy,\nhowever, the time-averaged structure of the accretion flow is strikingly\nsimilar to that found in simulations treating the plasma as an ideal fluid. We\nargue that these similarities are largely due to the interchangeability of the\nviscous and magnetic shear stresses as long as the magnetic pressure is small\ncompared to the gas pressure, and to the sub-dominant role of pressure/viscous\neffects in magnetically arrested disks. We conclude by highlighting outstanding\nquestions in modeling the dynamics of low collisionality accretion flows.\n", "  We report results of the first systematic simulation of proton and neutron\ndensity distributions in central heavy-ion collisions within the beam energy\nrange of $ E_{\\rm beam} \\leq 800 \\, \\text{MeV/nucl}$ using pBUU and TDHF\nmodels. The symmetric $^\\text{40}$Ca +$^\\text{40}$Ca, $^\\text{48}$Ca\n+$^\\text{48}$Ca, $^\\text{100}$Sn +$^\\text{100}$Sn and $^\\text{120}$Sn +\n$^\\text{120}$Sn and asymmetric $^\\text{40}$Ca +$^\\text{48}$Ca and\n$^\\text{100}$Sn +$^\\text{120}$Sn systems were chosen for the simulations. We\nfind limits on the maximum proton and neutron densities and the related\nproton-neutron asymmetry $\\delta$ as a function of the initial state, beam\nenergy, system size and a symmetry energy model. While the maximum densities\nare almost independent of these parameters, our simulation reveals, for the\nfirst time, their subtle impact on the proton-neutron asymmetry. Most\nimportantly, we find that variations in the proton-neutron asymmetry at maximum\ndensities are related at most at 50\\% level to the details in the symmetry\nenergy at supranormal density. The reminder is due to the details in the\nsymmetry energy at subnormal densities and its impact on proton and neutron\ndistributions in the initial state. This result puts to forefront the need of a\nproper initialization of the nuclei in the simulation, but also brings up the\nquestion of microscopy, such as shell effects, that affect initial proton and\nneutron densities, but cannot be consistently incorporated into semiclassical\ntransport models.\n", "  We present the $\\gamma$-ray observations of the flat-spectrum radio quasar\nPKS 1441+25 (z=0.939), using the {\\it Fermi} large Area Telescope data\naccumulated during January - December 2015. A $\\gamma$-ray flare was observed\nin January 24, when the flux increased up to $(2.22\\pm0.38)\\times10^{-6}\\;{\\rm\nphoton\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}}$ with the flux-doubling time scale being as short as\n$\\sim1.44$ days. The spectral analysis shows that from April 13 to April 28,\n2015 the MeV-to-GeV photon index has hardened and changes in the range of\n$\\Gamma=(1.73-1.79)$ for most of the time. The hardest photon index of\n$\\Gamma=1.54\\pm0.16$ has been observed on MJD 57131.46 with $11.8\\sigma$ which\nis not common for flat-spectrum radio quasars. For the same period the \\gray\nspectrum shows a possible deviation from a simple power-law shape, indicating a\nspectral cutoff at $E_{\\rm cut}=17.7\\pm8.9$ GeV. The spectral energy\ndistributions during quiescent and flaring states are modeled using one-zone\nleptonic models that include the synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton and\nexternal inverse Compton processes; the model parameters are estimated using\nthe Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. The emission in the flaring states can be\nmodeled assuming that either the bulk Lorentz factor or the magnetic field has\nincreased. The modeling shows that there is a hint of hardening of the\nlow-energy index ($\\sim1.98$) of the underlying non-thermal distribution of\nelectrons responsible for the emission in April 2015. Such hardening agrees\nwith the $\\gamma$-ray data, which pointed out a significant $\\gamma$-ray photon\nindex hardening on April 13 to 28, 2015.\n", "  We have recently presented a manifestly local and general coordinate\ninvariant formulation of a nonlocal approach to the cosmological constant\nproblem which has been proposed by Carroll and Remmen. In this article, based\non our formulation, we investigate some quantum aspects of this approach to the\ncosmological constant problem. In particular, we explicitly evaluate quantum\neffects to the effective cosmological constant from matter fields at one-loop\nlevel, and show that the effective cosmological constant receives radiative\ncorrections and is not stable against quantum corrections so that it must be\nfine-tuned at every stage in the loop expansion. Next, we will propose a new\nscale-invariant model of a nonlocal approach to the cosmological constant\nproblem, and show explicitly that in this new model the effective cosmological\nconstant is indeed stable against radiative corrections.\n", "  We have used the AMR hydrodynamic code, MG, to perform 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations with self-gravity of stellar feedback in a spherical clumpy\nmolecular cloud formed through the action of thermal instability. We simulate\nthe interaction of the mechanical energy input from 15 Msun, 40 Msun, 60 Msun\nand 120 Msun stars into a 100 pc-diameter 16,500 Msun cloud with a roughly\nspherical morphology with randomly distributed high density condensations. The\nstellar winds are introduced using appropriate non-rotating Geneva stellar\nevolution models. In the 15 Msun star case, the wind has very little effect,\nspreading around a few neighbouring clumps before becoming overwhelmed by the\ncloud collapse. In contrast, in the 40 Msun, 60 Msun and 120 Msun star cases,\nthe more powerful stellar winds create large cavities and carve channels\nthrough the cloud, breaking out into the surrounding tenuous medium during the\nwind phase and considerably altering the cloud structure. After 4.97 Myrs, 3.97\nMyrs and 3.01 Myrs respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae (SNe).\nThe wind-sculpted surroundings considerably affect the evolution of these SN\nevents as they both escape the cloud along wind-carved channels and sweep up\nremaining clumps of cloud/wind material. The `cloud' as a coherent structure\ndoes not survive the SN from any of these stars, but only in the 120 Msun case\nis the cold molecular material completely destabilised and returned to the\nunstable thermal phase. In the 40 Msun and 60 Msun cases, coherent clumps of\ncold material are ejected from the cloud by the SN, potentially capable of\nfurther star formation.\n", "  We adopt a variational technique to study the dynamics of perturbed\ndissipative solitons, whose evolution is governed by a Ginzburg--Landau\nequation (GLE). As a specific example of such solitons, we consider a\nsilicon-based active waveguide in which free carriers are generated through\ntwo-photon absorption. In this case, dissipative solitons are perturbed by\nphysical processes such as third-order dispersion, intrapulse Raman scattering,\nself-steepening, and free-carrier generation. To solve the variational problem,\nwe adopt the Pereira--Stenflo soliton as an ansatz since this soliton is the\nexact solution of the unperturbed GLE. With this ansatz, we derive a set of six\ncoupled differential equations exhibiting the dynamics of various pulse\nparameters. This set of equations provides considerable physical insight in the\ncomplex behavior of perturbed dissipative solitons. Its predictions are found\nto be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations of the GLE. More\nspecifically, the spectral and temporal shifts of the chirped soliton induced\nby free carriers and intrapulse Raman scattering are predicted quite\naccurately. We also provide simple analytic expressions of these shifts by\nmaking suitable approximations. Our semi-analytic treatment is useful for\ngaining physical insight into complex soliton-evolution processes.\n", "  We have detected H$_2$O and O$_2$ absorption against the far-UV continuum of\nstars located on lines of sight near the nucleus of Comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko using the Alice imaging spectrograph on Rosetta.\nThese stellar appulses occurred at impact parameters of $\\rho=4$-20 km, and\nheliocentric distances ranging from $R_h=-1.8$ to 2.3 AU (negative values\nindicate pre-perihelion observations). The measured H$_2$O column densities\nagree well with nearly contemporaneous values measured by VIRTIS-H. The clear\ndetection of O$_2$ independently confirms the initial detection by the ROSINA\nmass spectrometer; however, the relative abundance of O$_2$/H$_2$O derived from\nthe stellar spectra (11%-68%, with a median value of 25%) is considerably\nlarger than published values found by ROSINA. The cause of this difference is\nunclear, but potentially related to ROSINA measuring number density at the\nspacecraft position while Alice measures column density along a line of sight\nthat passes near the nucleus.\n", "  The origin of narrow line region (NLR) outflows remains unknown. In this\npaper, we explore the scenario in which these outflows are circumnuclear clouds\ndriven by energetic accretion disk winds. We choose the well-studied nearby\nSeyfert galaxy NGC 4151 as an example. By performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we are able to reproduce the radial distributions of velocity,\nmass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of NLR outflows in the inner 100 pc\ndeduced from spatial resolved spectroscopic observations. The demanded kinetic\nluminosity of disk winds is about two orders of magnitude higher than that\ninferred from the NLR outflows, but is close to the ultrafast outflows (UFO)\ndetected in X-ray spectrum and a few times lower than the bolometric luminosity\nof the Seyfert. Our simulations imply that the scenario is viable for NGC 4151.\nThe existence of the underlying disk winds can be confirmed by their impacts on\nhigher density ISM, e.g., shock excitation signs, and the pressure in NLR.\n", "  We investigate the origin, the shape, the scatter, and the cosmic evolution\nin the observed relationship between specific angular momentum $j_\\star$ and\nthe stellar mass $M_\\star$ in early-type (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs).\nSpecifically, we exploit the observed star-formation efficiency and chemical\nabundance to infer the fraction $f_{\\rm inf}$ of baryons that infall toward the\ncentral regions of galaxies where star formation can occur. We find $f_{\\rm\ninf}\\approx 1$ for LTGs and $\\approx 0.4$ for ETGs with an uncertainty of about\n$0.25$ dex, consistent with a biased collapse. By comparing with the locally\nobserved $j_\\star$ vs. $M_\\star$ relations for LTGs and ETGs we estimate the\nfraction $f_j$ of the initial specific angular momentum associated to the\ninfalling gas that is retained in the stellar component: for LTGs we find\n$f_j\\approx 1.11^{+0.75}_{-0.44}$, in line with the classic disc formation\npicture; for ETGs we infer $f_j\\approx 0.64^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$, that can be\ntraced back to a $z<1$ evolution via dry mergers. We also show that the\nobserved scatter in the $j_{\\star}$ vs. $M_{\\star}$ relation for both galaxy\ntypes is mainly contributed by the intrinsic dispersion in the spin parameters\nof the host dark matter halo. The biased collapse plus mergers scenario implies\nthat the specific angular momentum in the stellar components of ETG progenitors\nat $z\\sim 2$ is already close to the local values, in pleasing agreement with\nobservations. All in all, we argue such a behavior to be imprinted by nature\nand not nurtured substantially by the environment.\n", "  The optical transient PTF11kx exhibited both the characteristic spectral\nfeatures of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the signature of ejecta interacting\nwith circumstellar material (CSM) containing hydrogen, indicating the presence\nof a nondegenerate companion. We present an optical spectrum at $1342$ days\nafter peak from Keck Observatory, in which the broad component of H$\\alpha$\nemission persists with a similar profile as in early-time observations. We also\npresent $Spitzer$ IRAC detections obtained $1237$ and $1818$ days after peak,\nand an upper limit from $HST$ ultraviolet imaging at $2133$ days. We interpret\nour late-time observations in context with published results - and reinterpret\nthe early-time observations - in order to constrain the CSM's physical\nparameters and compare to theoretical predictions for recurrent nova systems.\nWe find that the CSM's radial extent may be several times the distance between\nthe star and the CSM's inner edge, and that the CSM column density may be two\norders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. We show that the H$\\alpha$\nluminosity decline is similar to other SNe with CSM interaction, and\ndemonstrate how our infrared photometry is evidence for newly formed,\ncollisionally heated dust. We create a model for PTF11kx's late-time CSM\ninteraction and find that X-ray reprocessing by photoionization and\nrecombination cannot reproduce the observed H$\\alpha$ luminosity, suggesting\nthat the X-rays are thermalized and that H$\\alpha$ radiates from collisional\nexcitation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results regarding the\nprogenitor scenario and the geometric properties of the CSM for the PTF11kx\nsystem.\n", "  The first and second moments of stellar velocities encode important\ninformation about the formation history of the Galactic halo. However, due to\nthe lack of tangential motion and inaccurate distances of the halo stars, the\nvelocity moments in the Galactic halo have largely remained \"known unknowns\".\nFortunately, our off-centric position within the Galaxy allows us to estimate\nthese moments in the galacto-centric frame using the observed radial velocities\nof the stars alone. We use these velocities coupled with the Hierarchical\nBayesian scheme, which allows easy marginalisation over the missing data (the\nproper-motion, and uncertainty-free distance and line-of-sight velocity), to\nmeasure the velocity dispersions, orbital anisotropy ($\\beta$) and streaming\nmotion ($v_{\\rm rot}$) of the halo main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) and K-giant\n(KG) stars in the inner stellar halo (r $\\lesssim 15$ kpc). We study the\nmetallicity bias in kinematics of the halo stars and observe that the\ncomparatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$>-1.4$) and the metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\\leq -\n1.4$) MSTO samples show a clear systematic difference in $v_{\\rm rot} \\sim\n20-40$ km s$^{-1}$, depending on how restrictive the spatial cuts to cull the\ndisk contamination are. The bias is also detected in KG samples but with less\ncertainty. Both MSTO and KG populations suggest that the inner stellar halo of\nthe Galaxy is radially biased i.e. $\\sigma_r>\\sigma_\\theta$ or $\\sigma_\\phi$\nand $\\beta \\simeq 0.5$. The apparent metallicity contrariety in the rotation\nvelocity among the halo sub-populations supports the co-existence of multiple\npopulations in the galactic halo that may have formed through distinct\nformation scenarios, i.e. in-situ versus accretion.\n", "  We present results of a joint \\textit{Chandra}/\\textit{XMM-Newton} analysis\nof the early-type galaxies NGC 4649 and NGC 5846 aimed at investigating\ndifferences between mass profiles derived from X-ray data and those from\noptical data, to probe the state of the hot ISM in these galaxies. If the hot\nISM is at a given radius in hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) the X-ray data can be\nused to measure the total enclosed mass of the galaxy. Differences from\noptically-derived mass distributions therefore yield information about\ndepartures from HE in the hot halos. The X-ray mass profiles in different\nangular sectors of NGC 4649 are generally smooth with no significant azimuthal\nasymmetries within \\(12\\) kpc. Extrapolation of these profiles beyond this\nscale yields results consistent with the optical estimate. However, in the\ncentral region (\\(r < 3\\) kpc) the X-ray data underpredict the enclosed mass,\nwhen compared with the optical mass profiles. Consistent with previous results\nwe estimate a non-thermal pressure component accounting for \\(30\\%\\) of the gas\npressure, likely linked to nuclear activity. In NGC 5846 the X-ray mass\nprofiles show significant azimuthal asymmetries, especially in the NE\ndirection. Comparison with optical mass profiles in this direction suggests\nsignificant departures from HE, consistent with bulk gas compression and\ndecompression due to sloshing on \\(\\sim 15\\) kpc scales; this effect disappears\nin the NW direction where the emission is smooth and extended. In this sector\nwe find consistent X-ray and optical mass profiles, suggesting that the hot\nhalo is not responding to strong non-gravitational forces.\n", "  Adverse space weather effects can often be traced to solar flares, prediction\nof which has drawn significant research interests. The Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI) produces full-disk vector magnetograms with continuous\nhigh cadence, while flare prediction efforts utilizing this unprecedented data\nsource are still limited. Here we report results of flare prediction using\nphysical parameters provided by the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches\n(SHARP) and related data products. We survey X-ray flares occurred from 2010\nMay to 2016 December, and categorize their source regions into four classes (B,\nC, M, and X) according to the maximum GOES magnitude of flares they generated.\nWe then retrieve SHARP related parameters for each selected region at the\nbeginning of its flare date to build a database. Finally, we train a\nmachine-learning algorithm, called random forest (RF), to predict the\noccurrence of a certain class of flares in a given active region within 24\nhours, evaluate the classifier performance using the 10-fold cross validation\nscheme, and characterize the results using standard performance metrics.\nCompared to previous works, our experiments indicate that using the HMI\nparameters and RF is a valid method for flare forecasting with fairly\nreasonable prediction performance. To our knowledge, this is the first time\nthat RF is used to make multi-class predictions of solar flares. We also find\nthat the total unsigned quantities of vertical current, current helicity, and\nflux near polarity inversion line are among the most important parameters for\nclassifying flaring regions into different classes.\n", "  We perform the NuSTAR and Swift/XRT joint energy spectral fitting of\nsimultaneous observations from the broad-line Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 5273. When\nfitted with the combination of an exponential cut-off power-law and a\nreflection model, a high energy cut-off is detected at 143$^{+96}_{-40}$ keV\nwith 2-sigma significance. Existence of such cut-off is also consistent with\nthe observed Comptonizing electron temperature when fitted with a\nComptonization model independently. We observe a moderate hard X-ray\nvariability of the source over the time-scale of ~12 years using INTEGRAL/ISGRI\nobservations in the energy range of 20-100 keV. When the hard band count rate\n(6-20 keV) is plotted against the soft band count rate (3-6 keV), a hard offset\nis observed. Our results indicate that the cut-off energy may not correlate\nwith the coronal X-ray luminosity in a simple manner. Similarities in\nparameters that describe coronal properties indicate that the coronal structure\nof NGC 5273 may be similar to that of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3 and\nanother galaxy MCG-5-23-16 where the coronal plasma is dominated by electrons,\nrather than electron-positron pairs. Therefore, the coronal cooling is equally\nefficient to the heating mechanism keeping the cut-off energy at low even at\nthe low accretion rate.\n", "  We present an optical spectrum (4000-10500 {\\AA} ) of the lensed blazar\nB0218+357 secured at the 10m GTC and aimed to investigate and clarify the\nproperties of this intriguing system. We found that the emission line spectrum\nof the blazar is characterised by only one broad emission line that interpreted\nas Mg II 2800 {\\AA} yields z=0.95. In addition we detect narrow absorption\nlines of Mg II 2800 {\\AA} and Ca II (H,K) and Na I 5892 {\\AA} at z=0.68437 +/-\n0.00005 due to intervening interstellar gas. No stellar absorption features\nattributable to the lens galaxy are revealed. Thus the assumed redshift of the\nlens is dubious. The continuum spectrum of the object exhibits a remarkable\ndrop towards the short wavelengths likely due to a significant extinction. This\nextinction cannot be produced in the lens galaxy at z =0.684 with any value of\nR$_V$ under the assumption that the intrinsic shape of the blazar is dominated\nby a power law emission. However, the observed continuum is consistent with a\npower law emission assuming a standard (R$_V$ = 3.1) extinction at the source\nredshift (z=0.95) as supported also by the presence of Mg II absorptions at the\nsame redshift. HST images of B0218+357 exhibit the double image of the source\ntogether with extended image of a face on spiral galaxy. We argue that this\ngalaxy is possibly not the lensing galaxy but the host galaxy of the blazar.\nThis has substantial consequences on the models of the system and on the\nderived values of the Hubble constant.\n", "  In the past decade, gamma-ray observations and radio observations of our\nMilky Way and the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies put very strong\nconstraints on annihilation cross sections of dark matter. In this article, we\nsuggest a new target object (NGC 2976) that can be used for constraining\nannihilating dark matter. The radio and x-ray data of NGC 2976 can put very\ntight constraints on the leptophilic channels of dark matter annihilation. The\nlower limits of dark matter mass annihilating via $e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channels are 200 GeV, 130 GeV and 110 GeV respectively with the\ncanonical thermal relic cross section. We suggest that this kind of large\nnearby dwarf galaxies with relatively high magnetic field can be good\ncandidates for constraining annihilating dark matter in future analysis.\n", "  We report the discovery of RAVE J203843.2-002333, a bright (V = 12.73), very\nmetal-poor ([Fe/H] = -2.91), r-process-enhanced ([Eu/Fe] = +1.64 and [Ba/Eu] =\n-0.81) star selected from the RAVE survey. This star was identified as a\nmetal-poor candidate based on its medium-resolution (R ~ 1,600) spectrum\nobtained with the KPNO/Mayall Telescope, and followed-up with high-resolution\n(R ~ 66,000) spectroscopy with the Magellan/Clay Telescope, allowing for the\ndetermination of elemental abundances for 24 neutron-capture elements,\nincluding thorium and uranium. RAVE J2038-0023 is only the fourth metal-poor\nstar with a clearly measured U abundance. The derived chemical-abundance\npattern exhibits good agreement with those of other known highly\nr-process-enhanced stars, and evidence in hand suggests that it is not an\nactinide-boost star. Age estimates were calculated using Th/X and U/X abundance\nratios, yielding a mean age of 13.0 +/- 1.1 Gyr.\n", "  In the present study, we investigate the multifractal nature of a\nlong-cadence time series observed by the \\textit{Kepler} mission for a sample\nof 34 M dwarf stars and the Sun in its active phase. Using the Multifractal\nDetrending Moving Average algorithm (MFDMA), which enables the detection of\nmultifractality in nonstationary time series, we define a set of multifractal\nindices based on the multifractal spectrum profile as a measure of the level of\nstellar magnetic activity. This set of indices is given by the ($A$,$\\Delta\n\\alpha$,$C$,$H$)-quartet, where $A$, $\\Delta \\alpha$ and $C$ are related to\ngeometric features from the multifractal spectrum and the global Hurst exponent\n$H$ describes the global structure and memorability of time series dynamics. As\na test, we measure these indices and compare them with a magnetic index defined\nas $S_{ph}$ and verify the degree of correlation among them. First, we apply\nthe Poincar\\'e plot method and find a strong correlation between the\n$\\left\\langle S_{ph}\\right\\rangle$ index and one of the descriptors that\nemerges from this method. As a result, we find that this index is strongly\ncorrelated with long-term features of the signal. From the multifractal\nperspective, the $\\left\\langle S_{ph}\\right\\rangle$ index is also strongly\nlinked to the geometric properties of the multifractal spectrum except for the\n$H$ index. Furthermore, our results emphasize that the rotation period of stars\nis scaled by the $H$ index, which is consistent with Skumanich's relationship.\nFinally, our approach suggests that the $H$ index may be related to the\nevolution of stellar angular momentum and a star's magnetic properties.\n", "  We introduce fully SGUTs, SUSY grand unified theories that, upon symmetry\nbreaking through the Higgs mechanism, decompose into a visible sector and an\nextra sector where the dynamics of the extra sector gauge group is responsible\nfor SUSY breaking. Fully SGUTs thus have the important feature that all gauge\ngroups of the visible sector and the extra sector unify into a simple gauge\ngroup at the SGUT scale, therefore generalizing the successful MSSM gauge\ncoupling unification to all the gauge couplings of the theory. By focusing on\nthe ISS SUSY-breaking mechanism in the extra sector, we show that it is\nimpossible to reproduce the MSSM matter content when there exists a metastable\nISS SUSY-breaking state.\n", "  We present a BVI optical photometric study of the old open cluster Ruprecht 6\nusing the data obtained with the SMARTS 1.0 m telescope at the CTIO, Chile. Its\ncolor-magnitude diagrams show the clear existence of the main-sequence stars,\nof which turn-off point is located around V ~ 18.45 mag and B-V ~ 0.85 mag.\nThree red clump (RC) stars are identified at V = 16.00 mag, I = 14.41 mag and\nB-V = 1.35 mag. From the mean Ks-band magnitude of RC stars (Ks=12.39 +- 0.21\nmag) in Ruprecht 6 from 2MASS photometry and the known absolute magnitudes of\nthe RC stars (M_Ks = -1.595 +- 0.025 mag), we obtain the distance modulus to\nRuprecht 6 (m-M)_0 = 13.84 +- 0.21 mag (d=5.86 +- 0.60 kpc). From the (J-K_s)\nand (B-V) colors of the RC stars, comparison of the (B-V) and (V-I) colors of\nthe bright stars in Ruprecht 6 with those of the intrinsic colors of dwarf and\ngiant stars, and the PARSEC isochrone fittings, we derive the reddening values\nof E(B-V) = 0.42 mag and E(V-I) = 0.60 mag. Using the PARSEC isochrone fittings\nonto the color-magnitude diagrams, we estimate the age and metallicity to be:\nlog (t) =9.50 +- 0.10 (t =3.16 +- 0.82 Gyr) and [Fe/H] = -0.42 +- 0.04 dex. We\npresent the Galactocentric radial metallicity gradient analysis for old (age >\n1 Gyr) open clusters of Dias et al. catalog, which likely follow a single\nrelation of [Fe/H] =(-0.034 +- 0.007) R_GC + (0.190 +- 0.080) (rms = 0.201) for\nthe whole radial range or dual relation of [Fe/H] =(-0.077 +- 0.017) R_GC +\n(0.609 +- 0.161) (rms = 0.152) and constant ([Fe/H] ~ -0.3 dex) value, inside\nand outside of R_GC ~ 12 kpc, respectively. The metallicity and Galactocentric\nradius (13.28 +- 0.54 kpc) of Ruprecht 6 obtained in this study seem to be\nconsistent with both of the relations.\n", "  We estimate the dust torus cooling timescale once the active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) is quenched. In a clumpy torus system, once the incoming photons are\nsuppressed, the cooling timescale of one clump from $T_{\\rm dust}=1000$ K to\nseveral $10$ K is less than $10$ years, indicating that the dust torus cooling\ntime is mainly governed by the light crossing time of the torus from the\ncentral engine. After considering the light crossing time of the torus, the AGN\ntorus emission at $12~\\mu$m becomes over two orders of magnitude fainter within\n$100$ years after the quenching. We also propose that those \"dying\" AGN could\nbe found using the AGN indicators with different physical scale $R$ such as\n$12~\\mu$m band luminosity tracing AGN torus ($R \\sim 10$ pc) and the optical\n[OIII]$\\lambda5007$ emission line narrow line regions ($R=10^{2-4}$ pc).\n", "  Magnetic reconnection plays an integral part in nearly all models of solar\nflares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The reconnection heats and\naccelerates the plasma, produces energetic electrons and ions, and changes the\nmagnetic topology to form magnetic flux ropes and allow CMEs to escape.\nStructures that appear between flare loops and CME cores in optical, UV, EUV\nand X-ray observations have been identified as current sheets and interpreted\nin terms of the nature of the reconnection process and the energetics of the\nevents. Many of these studies have used UV spectral observations of high\ntemperature emission features in the [Fe XVIII] and Si XII lines. In this paper\nwe discuss several surprising cases in which the [Fe XVIII] and Si XII emission\npeaks are spatially offset from each other. We discuss interpretations based on\nasymmetric reconnection, on a thin reconnection region within a broader\nstreamer-like structure, and on projection effects. Some events seem to be\neasily interpreted as projection of a sheet that is extended along the line of\nsight that is viewed an angle, but a physical interpretation in terms of\nasymmetric reconnection is also plausible. Other events favor an interpretation\nas a thin current sheet embedded in a streamer-like structure.\n", "  The BeSSeL Survey is mapping the spiral structure of the Milky Way by\nmeasuring trigonometric parallaxes of hundreds of maser sources associated with\nhigh-mass star formation. While parallax techniques for water masers at high\nfrequency (22 GHz) have been well documented, recent observations of methanol\nmasers at lower frequency (6.7 GHz) have revealed astrometric issues associated\nwith signal propagation through the ionosphere that could significantly limit\nparallax accuracy. These problems displayed as a \"parallax gradient\" on the sky\nwhen measured against different background quasars. We present an analysis\nmethod in which we generate position data relative to an \"artificial quasar\" at\nthe target maser position at each epoch. Fitting parallax to these data can\nsignificantly mitigate the problems and improve parallax accuracy.\n", "  We present new [Ne II] (12.8 micron) IRTF/TEXES observations of the Galactic\nCenter HII regions H1 and H2, which are at a projected distance of ~11 pc from\nthe center of the Galaxy. The new observations allow to map the radial velocity\ndistributions of ionized gas. The high spectroscopic resolution (~4 km/s) helps\nus to disentangle different velocity components and enables us to resolve\nprevious ambiguity regarding the nature of these sources. The spatial\ndistributions of the intensity and radial velocity of the [Ne II] line are\nmapped. In H1, the intensity distributions of the Paschen-\\alpha (1.87 micron)\nand [Ne II] lines are significantly different, which suggests a strong\nvariation of extinction across the HII region of A_K~0.56. The radial velocity\ndistributions across these HII regions are consistent with the predictions of a\nbow-shock model for H1 and the pressure-driven model for H2. Furthermore, we\nfind a concentration of bright stars in H2. These stars have similar H-K_s\ncolors and can be explained as part of a 2 Myr old stellar cluster. H2 also\nfalls on the orbit of the molecular clouds, suggested to be around Sgr A*. Our\nnew results confirm what we had previously suggested: the O supergiant P114 in\nH1 is a runaway star, moving towards us through the -30-0 {km/s} molecular\ncloud, whereas the O If star P35 in H2 formed in-situ, and may mark the\nposition of a so-far unknown small star cluster formed within the central 30 pc\nof the Galaxy.\n", "  We used four-year baseline HST/WFC3 IR observations of the Galactic Centre in\nthe F153M band (1.53 micron) to identify variable stars in the central\n~2.3'x2.3' field. We classified 3845 long-term (periods from months to years)\nand 76 short-term (periods of a few days or less) variables among a total\nsample of 33070 stars. For 36 of the latter ones, we also derived their periods\n(<3 days). Our catalog not only confirms bright long period variables and\nmassive eclipsing binaries identified in previous works, but also contains many\nnewly recognized dim variable stars. For example, we found \\delta Scuti and RR\nLyrae stars towards the Galactic Centre for the first time, as well as one BL\nHer star (period < 1.3 d). We cross-correlated our catalog with previous\nspectroscopic studies and found that 319 variables have well-defined stellar\ntypes, such as Wolf-Rayet, OB main sequence, supergiants and asymptotic giant\nbranch stars. We used colours and magnitudes to infer the probable variable\ntypes for those stars without accurately measured periods or spectroscopic\ninformation. We conclude that the majority of unclassified variables could\npotentially be eclipsing/ellipsoidal binaries and Type II Cepheids. Our source\ncatalog will be valuable for future studies aimed at constraining the distance,\nstar formation history and massive binary fraction of the Milky Way nuclear\nstar cluster.\n", "  We present a new analysis of the stellar mass function and morphology of\nrecently-quenched galaxies (RQGs), whose star formation has been recently\nquenched for some reason. The COSMOS2015 catalog was exploited to select those\ngalaxies at 0.2 < z < 4.8, over 1.5 deg2 of the Cosmic Evolution Survey\n(COSMOS) UltraVISTA field. This is the first time that RQGs are consistently\nselected and studied in such a wide range of redshift. We find increasing\nnumber density of RQGs with time in a broad mass range at z>1, while low-mass\nRQGs start to grow very rapidly at z < 1. We also demonstrate that the\nmigration of RQGs may largely drive the evolution of the stellar mass function\nof passive galaxies. Moreover, we find that the morphological type distribution\nof RQGs are intermediate between those of star-forming and passive galaxies.\nThese results indicate that RQGs represent a major transitional phase of galaxy\nevolution, in which star-forming galaxies turn into passive galaxies,\naccompanied by the build up of spheroidal component.\n", "  We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations at 345 GHz towards the\nintermediate/high-mass cluster-forming region NGC 6334 V. From the dust\nemission we spatially resolve three dense condensations, the brightest one\npresenting the typical chemistry of a hot core. The magnetic field (derived\nfrom the dust polarized emission) shows a bimodal converging pattern towards\nthe hot core. The molecular emission traces two filamentary structures at two\ndifferent velocities, separated by 2 km/s, converging to the hot core and\nfollowing the magnetic field distribution. We compare the velocity field and\nthe magnetic field derived from the SMA observations with MHD simulations of\nstar-forming regions dominated by gravity. This comparison allows us to show\nhow the gas falls in from the larger-scale extended dense core (~0.1 pc) of NGC\n6334 V towards the higher-density hot core region (~0.02 pc) through two\ndistinctive converging flows dragging the magnetic field, whose strength seems\nto have been overcome by gravity.\n", "  We study the collapse of pebble clouds with a statistical model to find the\ninternal structure of comet-sized planetesimals. Pebble-pebble collisions occur\nduring the collapse and the outcome of these collisions affect the resulting\nstructure of the planetesimal. We expand our previous models by allowing the\nindividual pebble sub-clouds to contract at different rates and by including\nthe effect of gas drag on the contraction speed and in energy dissipation. Our\nresults yield comets that are porous pebble-piles with particle sizes varying\nwith depth. In the surface layers there is a mixture of primordial pebbles and\npebble fragments. The interior, on the other hand, consists only of primordial\npebbles with a narrower size distribution, yielding higher porosity there. Our\nresults imply that the gas in the protoplanetary disc plays an important role\nin determining the radial distribution of pebble sizes and porosity inside\nplanetesimals.\n", "  To probe the star formation (SF) process, we present a multi-wavelength study\nof IRAS 05480+2545 (hereafter I05480+2545). Analysis of Herschel data reveals a\nmassive clump (M_clump ~ 1875 Msun; peak N(H_2) ~ 4.8 x 10^{22} cm^{-2}; A_V ~\n51 mag) containing the 6.7 GHz methanol maser and I05480+2545, which is also\ndepicted in a temperature range of 18-26 K. Several noticeable parsec-scale\nfilaments are detected in the Herschel 250 microns image and seem to be\nradially directed to the massive clump. It resembles more of a \"hub-filament\"\nsystem. Deeply embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified using\nthe 1-5 microns photometric data, and a significant fraction of YSOs and their\nclustering are spatially found toward the massive clump, revealing the intense\nSF activities. An infrared counterpart (IRc) of the maser is investigated in\nthe Spitzer 3.6-4.5 microns images. The IRc does not appear point-like source\nand is most likely associated with the molecular outflow. Based on the 1.4 GHz\nand Halpha continuum images, the ionized emission is absent toward the IRc,\nindicating that the massive clump harbors an early phase of massive protostar\nbefore the onset of an ultracompact H II region. Together, the I05480+2545 is\nembedded in a very similar \"hub-filament\" system to those seen in Rosette\nMolecular Cloud. The outcome of the present work indicates the role of\nfilaments in the formation of the massive star-forming clump and cluster of\nYSOs, which might help channel material to the central hub configuration and\nthe clump/core.\n", "  The light from distant supernovae (SNe) can be magnified through\ngravitational lensing when a foreground galaxy is located along the line of\nsight. This line-up allows for detailed studies of SNe at high redshift that\notherwise would not be possible. Spectroscopic observations of lensed\nhigh-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are of particular interest since they\ncan be used to test for evolution of their intrinsic properties. The use of SNe\nIa for probing the cosmic expansion history has proven to be an extremely\npowerful method for measuring cosmological parameters. However, if systematic\nredshift-dependent properties are found, their usefulness for future surveys\ncould be challenged. We investigate whether the spectroscopic properties of the\nstrongly lensed and very distant SN Ia PS1-10afx at $z=1.4$ deviates from the\nwell-studied populations of normal SNe Ia at nearby or intermediate distance.\nWe created median spectra from nearby and intermediate-redshift\nspectroscopically normal SNe Ia from the literature at -5 and +1 days from\nlight-curve maximum. We then compared these median spectra to those of\nPS1-10afx. We do not find signs of spectral evolution in PS1-10afx. The\nobserved deviation between PS1-10afx and the median templates are within what\nis found for SNe at low- and intermediate-redshift. There is a noticeable broad\nfeature centred at $\\rm \\lambda\\sim 3500$~\\AA{}, which is present only to a\nlesser extent in individual low and intermediate redshift SN Ia spectra. From a\ncomparison with a recently developed explosion model, we find this feature to\nbe dominated by iron peak elements, in particular, singly ionized cobalt and\nchromium.\n", "  We present a study comparing OVI $\\lambda\\lambda$1031, 1037 doublet\nabsorption found towards group galaxy environments with that of isolated\ngalaxies. The OVI absorption in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of isolated\ngalaxies has been studied previously by the \"Multiphase Galaxy Halos\" survey,\nwhere the kinematics and absorption properties of the CGM have been\ninvestigated. We extend these studies to group environments. We define a galaxy\ngroup to have two or more galaxies having a line-of-sight velocity difference\nof no more than 1000 km/s and located within 350 kpc (projected) of a\nbackground quasar sightline. We identified a total of six galaxy groups\nassociated with OVI absorption $W_{\\rm r}>0.06$ {\\AA} that have a median\nredshift of $\\langle z_{\\rm gal} \\rangle = 0.1669$ and a median impact\nparameter of $\\langle D \\rangle = 134.1$ kpc. An additional 12 non-absorbing\ngroups were identified with a median redshift of $\\langle z_{\\rm gal} \\rangle =\n0.2690$ and a median impact parameter of $\\langle D \\rangle = 274.0$ kpc. We\nfind the average equivalent width to be smaller for group galaxies than for\nisolated galaxies $(3\\sigma)$. However, the covering fractions are consistent\nwith both samples. We used the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function\nmethod and find that the velocity spread of OVI in the CGM of group galaxies is\nsignificantly narrower than that of isolated galaxies $(10\\sigma)$. We suggest\nthat the warm/hot CGM does not exist as a superposition of halos, instead, the\nvirial temperature of the halo is hot enough for OVI to be further ionised. The\nremaining OVI likely exists at the interface between hot, diffuse gas and\ncooler regions of the CGM.\n", "  We report a systematic analysis of the spin, orbital, and superorbital\nmodulations of 4U 0114+650, a high-mass X-ray binary consists of one of the\nslowest spinning neutron stars. Utilizing the dynamic power spectrum, we found\nthat the spin period varied dramatically and anti-correlated with the long-term\nX-ray flux variation that can be observed using RXTE ASM, Swift BAT, and MAXI.\nThe spin-up rate over the entire dataset is consistent with previously reported\nvalues; however, the local spin-up rate is considerably higher. The\ncorresponding local spin-up timescale is comparable to the local spin-up rate\nof OAO 1657-415, indicating that 4U 0114+650 could also have a transient disk.\nMoreover, the spin period evolution shows two ~1000-day spin-down/random-walk\nepochs that appeared together with depressions of the superorbital modulation\namplitude. This implies that the superorbital modulation was closely related to\nthe presence of the accretion disk, which is not favored in the\nspin-down/random-walk epochs because the accretion is dominated by the direct\nwind accretion.The orbital period is stable during the entire time span;\nhowever, the orbital profile changes with time significantly. We found that the\ndepth of the dip near the inferior conjunction of the companion is highly\nvariable, which disfavors the eclipsing scenario. Moreover, the dip was less\nobvious during the spin-down/random-walk epochs, indicating its correlation\nwith the accretion disk. Further monitoring in both X-ray and optical bands\ncould reveal the establishment of the accretion disk in this system.\n", "  Mysterious dark matter constitutes about 85% of all mass in the Universe.\nClustering of dark matter plays the dominant role in the formation of all\nobserved structures on scales from a fraction to a few hundreds of\nMega-parsecs. Galaxies play a role of lights illuminating these structures so\nthey can be observed. The observations in the last several decades have\nunveiled opulent geometry of these structures currently known as the cosmic\nweb. Haloes are the highest concentrations of dark matter and host luminous\ngalaxies. Currently the most accurate modeling of dark matter haloes is\nachieved in cosmological N-body simulations. Identifying the haloes from the\ndistribution of particles in N-body simulations is one of the problems\nattracting both considerable interest and efforts. We propose a novel framework\nfor detecting potential dark matter haloes using the field unique for dark\nmatter -- multistream field. The multistream field emerges at the nonlinear\nstage of the growth of perturbations because the dark matter is collisionless.\nCounting the number of velocity streams in gravitational collapses supplements\nour knowledge of spatial clustering. We assume that the virialized haloes have\nconvex boundaries. Closed and convex regions of the multistream field are hence\nisolated by imposing a positivity condition on all three eigenvalues of the\nHessian estimated on the smoothed multistream field. In a single-scale analysis\nof high multistream field resolution and low softening length, the halo\nsubstructures with local multistream maxima are isolated as individual halo\nsites.\n", "  Context. The first generation of stars formed in the Galaxy left behind the\nchemical signatures of their nucleosynthesis in the interstellar medium,\nvisible today in the atmospheres of low-mass stars formed afterwards. Sampling\nthe chemistry of low-mass provides insight into the first stars. Aims. We aim\nto increase the samples of stars with extremely low metal abundances,\nidentifying ultra metal-poor stars from spectra with modest spectral resolution\nand signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Achieving this goal involves deriving reliable\nmetallicities and carbon abundances from such spectra. Methods. We carry-out\nfollow-up observations of faint, V>19, metal-poor candidates selected from SDSS\nspectroscopy and observed with OSIRIS at GTC. The SDSS and follow-up OSIRIS\nspectra have been analyzed using the FERRE code to derive effective\ntemperatures, surface gravities, metallicities and carbon abundances. In\naddition, a well-known extremely metal-poor star has been included in our\nsample to calibrate the analysis methodology. Results. We have observed and\nanalyzed five metal-poor candidates from modest-quality SDSS spectra. All stars\nin our sample have been confirmed as extremely metal-poor stars, in the\n[Fe/H]<-3.3 regime. We report the recognition of J173403+644632, a\ncarbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor dwarf star with [Fe/H]=-4.3 and [C/Fe]=+3.1.\n", "  We use the timescale distribution of ~3000 microlensing events measured by\nthe OGLE-III survey, together with accurate new made-to-measure dynamical\nmodels of the Galactic bulge/bar region, to measure the IMF in the inner Milky\nWay. The timescale of each event depends on the mass of the lensing object,\ntogether with the relative distances and velocities of the lens and source. The\ndynamical model provides statistically these distances and velocities allowing\nus to constrain the lens mass function, and from this to infer the IMF.\nParameterising the IMF as a broken power-law, we find slopes in the main\nsequence $\\alpha_{\\rm ms}=1.31\\pm0.10|_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.10|_{\\rm sys}$ and brown\ndwarf region $\\alpha_{\\rm bd}=-0.7\\pm0.9|_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.8|_{\\rm sys}$ where we\nuse a fiducial 50% binary fraction, and the systematic uncertainty covers the\nrange of binary fractions 0-100%. Similarly for a log-normal IMF we conclude\n$M_c=(0.17\\pm0.02|_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.01|_{\\rm sys})M_\\odot$ and\n$\\sigma_m=0.49\\pm0.07|_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.06|_{\\rm sys}$. These values are very\nsimilar to a Kroupa or Chabrier IMF respectively, showing that the IMF in the\nbulge is indistinguishable from that measured locally, despite the lenses lying\nin the inner Milky Way where the stars are mostly ~10Gyr old and formed on a\nfast $\\alpha$-element enhanced timescale. This therefore constrains models of\nIMF variation that depend on the properties of the collapsing gas cloud.\n", "  Pairs of radio relics are believed to form during cluster mergers, and are\nbest observed when the merger occurs in the plane of the sky. Mergers can also\nproduce radio halos, through complex processes likely linked to turbulent\nre-acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons. However, only some clusters with\ndouble relics also show a radio halo. Here, we present a novel method to derive\nupper limits on the radio halo emission, and analyse archival X-ray Chandra\ndata, as well as galaxy velocity dispersions and lensing data, in order to\nunderstand the key parameter that switches on radio halo emission. We place\nupper limits on the halo power below the $P_{\\rm 1.4 \\, GHz}\\, M_{500}$\ncorrelation for some clusters, confirming that clusters with double relics have\ndifferent radio properties. Computing X-ray morphological indicators, we find\nthat clusters with double relics are associated with the most disturbed\nclusters. We also investigate the role of different mass-ratios and\ntime-since-merger. Data do not indicate that the merger mass ratio has an\nimpact on the presence or absence of radio halos (the null hypothesis that the\nclusters belong to the same group cannot be rejected). However, the data\nsuggests that the absence of radio halos could be associated with early and\nlate mergers, but the sample is too small to perform a statistical test. Our\nstudy is limited by the small number of clusters with double relics. Future\nsurveys with LOFAR, ASKAP, MeerKat and SKA will provide larger samples to\nbetter address this issue.\n", "  The magnetometer (MAG) on Voyager 1 (V1) has been sampling the interstellar\nmagnetic field (ISMF) since August 2012. The V1 MAG observations have shown\ndraped ISMF in the very local interstellar medium disturbed occasionally by\nsignificant enhancements in magnetic field strength. Using a three-dimensional,\ndata driven, multi-fluid model, we investigated these magnetic field\nenhancements beyond the heliopause that are supposedly associated with solar\ntransients. To introduce time-dependent effects at the inner boundary at 1\nastronomical unit, we used daily averages of the solar wind parameters from the\nOMNI data set. The model ISMF strength, direction, and proton number density\nare compared with V1 data beyond the heliopause. The model reproduced the\nlarge-scale fluctuations between 2012.652 and 2016.652, including major events\naround 2012.9 and 2014.6. The model also predicts shocks arriving at V1 around\n2017.395 and 2019.502. Another model driven by OMNI data with interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (ICMEs) removed at the inner boundary suggests that\nICMEs may play a significant role in the propagation of shocks into the\ninterstellar medium.\n", "  We show that a recent interesting idea to circumvent the difficulties with\nthe continuation of parton distribution functions to the Euclidean region, that\nconsists in looking at equal time correlators between proton states of infinite\nmomentum, encounters some problems related to the power divergent mixing\npattern of DIS operators, when implemented within the lattice regularization.\n", "  In this paper, the behaviour of a charged massive scalar test field in the\nbackground of a Kerr-Sen black hole is investigated. A kind of stationary\nsolutions, dubbed scalar clouds, are obtained numerically and expressed by the\nexistence lines in the parameter space. We show that for fixed background and a\ngiven set of harmonic indices, the mass and charge of the scalar clouds are\nlimited in a finite region in the parameter space of the scalar field.\nParticularly, the maximum values of the mass and charge of the clouds around\nextremal Kerr-Sen black holes are independent of the angular velocity of the\nblack hole, whereas those in the extremal Kerr-Newman background depend on the\nangular velocity. In addition, it is demonstrated that, as the static limit of\nKerr-Sen black hole, Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black hole can\nnot support scalar cloud.\n", "  The present paper discusses results of a statistical study of the\ncharacteristics of coronal hole (CH) rotation in order to find connections to\nthe internal rotation of the Sun. The goal is to measure CH rotation rates and\nstudy their distribution over latitude and their area sizes. In addition, the\nCH rotation rates are compared with the solar photospheric and inner layer\nrotational profiles. We study coronal holes observed within $\\pm 60$ latitude\nand longitude degrees from the solar disc centre during the time span from the\n1 January 2013 to 20 April 2015, which includes the extended peak of solar\ncycle 24.We used data created by the Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm\n(SPoCA), which provides the exact location and characterisation of solar\ncoronal holes using SDO=AIA 193 {\\AA} channel images. The CH rotation rates are\nmeasured with four-hour cadence data to track variable positions of the CH\ngeometric centre. North-south asymmetry was found in the distribution of\ncoronal holes: about 60 percent were observed in the northern hemisphere and 40\npercent were observed in the southern hemisphere. The smallest and largest CHs\nwere present only at high latitudes. The average sidereal rotation rate for 540\nexamined CHs is $13:86 (\\pm 0:05)$ degrees/d. Conclusions. The latitudinal\ncharacteristics of CH rotation do not match any known photospheric rotation\nprofile. The CH angular velocities exceed the photospheric angular velocities\nat latitudes higher than 35-40 degrees. According to our results, the CH\nrotation profile perfectly coincides with tachocline and the lower layers of\nconvection zone at around 0.71 $R_{\\odot}$; this indicates that CHs may be\nlinked to the solar global magnetic field, which originates in the tachocline\nregion.\n", "  Recently, four additional Earth-mass planets were discovered orbiting the\nnearby ultracool M8 dwarf TRAPPIST-1, making a remarkable total of seven\nplanets with equilibrium temperatures compatible with the presence of liquid\nwater on their surface. Temperate terrestrial planets around an M-dwarf orbit\nclose to their parent star, rendering their atmospheres vulnerable to erosion\nby the stellar wind and energetic electromagnetic and particle radiation. Here,\nwe use state-of-the-art 3D magnetohydrodynamic models to simulate the wind\naround TRAPPIST-1 and study the conditions at each planetary orbit. All planets\nexperience a stellar wind pressure between $10^3$ and $10^5$ times the solar\nwind pressure on Earth. All orbits pass through wind pressure changes of an\norder of magnitude and most planets spend a large fraction of their orbital\nperiod in the sub-Alfv\\'enic regime. For plausible planetary magnetic field\nstrengths, all magnetospheres are greatly compressed and undergo much more\ndynamic change than that of the Earth. The planetary magnetic fields connect\nwith the stellar radial field over much of the planetary surface, allowing\ndirect flow of stellar wind particles onto the planetary atmosphere. These\nconditions could result in strong atmospheric stripping and evaporation and\nshould be taken into account for any realistic assessment of the evolution and\nhabitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.\n", "  Understanding how QSO's UV radiation affects galaxy formation is vital to our\nunderstanding of reionization era. Using a custom made narrow-band filter,\n$NB906$, on Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we investigated the number density of\nLy$\\alpha$ emitters (LAE) around a QSO at z=6.4. To date, this is the highest\nredshift narrow-band observation, where LAEs around a luminous QSO are\ninvestigated. Due to the large field-of-view of Suprime-Cam, our survey area is\n$\\sim$5400~cMpc$^2$, much larger than previously studies at z=5.7 ($\\sim$200\ncMpc$^2$). In this field, we previously found a factor of 7 overdensity of\nLyman break galaxies (LBGs). Based on this, we expected to detect $\\sim$100\nLAEs down to $NB906$=25 ABmag. However, our 6.4 hour exposure found none. The\nobtained upper limit on the number density of LAEs is more than an order lower\nthan the blank fields. Furthermore, this lower density of LAEs spans a large\nscale of 10 $p$Mpc across. A simple argument suggests a strong UV radiation\nfrom the QSO can suppress star-formation in halos with\n$M_{vir}<10^{10}M_{\\odot}$ within a $p$Mpc from the QSO, but the deficit at the\nedge of the field (5 $p$Mpc) remains to be explained.\n", "  Considering high-energy modifications of Einstein gravity during inflation is\nan interesting issue. We can constrain the strength of the new gravitational\nterms through observations of inflationary imprints in the actual universe. In\nthis paper we analyze the effects on slow-roll models due to a Chern-Simons\nterm coupled to the inflaton field through a generic coupling function\n$f(\\phi)$. A well known result is the polarization of primordial gravitational\nwaves (PGW) into left and right eigenstates, as a consequence of parity\nbreaking. In such a scenario the modifications to the power spectrum of PGW are\nsuppressed under the conditions that allow to avoid the production of ghost\ngravitons at a certain energy scale, the so-called Chern-Simons mass $M_{CS}$.\nIn general it has been recently pointed out that there is very little hope to\nefficiently constrain chirality of PGW on the basis solely of two-point\nstatistics from future CMB data, even in the most optimistic cases. Thus we\nsearch if significant parity breaking signatures can arise at least in the\nbispectrum statistics. We find that the tensor-tensor-scalar bispectra $\\langle\n\\gamma \\gamma \\zeta \\rangle$ for each polarization state are the only ones that\nare not suppressed. Their amplitude, setting the level of parity breaking\nduring inflation, is proportional to the second derivative of the coupling\nfunction $f(\\phi)$ and they turn out to be maximum in the squeezed limit. We\ncomment on the squeezed-limit consistency relation arising in the case of\nchiral gravitational waves, and on possible observables to constrain these\nsignatures.\n", "  We present constraints on Ks-band emission from one of the nearest short hard\ngamma-ray bursts, GRB 160821B, at z=0.16, at three epochs. We detect a reddened\nrelativistic afterglow from the jetted emission in the first epoch but do not\ndetect any excess kilonova emission in the second two epochs. We compare upper\nlimits obtained with Keck I/MOSFIRE to multi-dimensional radiative transfer\nmodels of kilonovae, that employ composition-dependent nuclear heating and LTE\nopacities of heavy elements. We discuss eight models that combine toroidal\ndynamical ejecta and two types of wind and one model with dynamical ejecta\nonly. We also discuss simple, empirical scaling laws of predicted emission as a\nfunction of ejecta mass and ejecta velocity. Our limits for GRB 160821B\nconstrain the ejecta mass to be lower than 0.03 Msun for velocities greater\nthan 0.1c. At the distance sensitivity range of advanced LIGO, similar\nground-based observations would be sufficiently sensitive to the full range of\npredicted model emission including models with only dynamical ejecta. The color\nevolution of these models shows that I-K color spans 7--16 mag, which suggests\nthat even relatively shallow infrared searches for kilonovae could be as\nconstraining as optical searches.\n", "  We present elemental abundances for eight unevolved extremely metal-poor\nstars with $T_{\\rm eff}>5500\\,\\mathrm{K}$, among which seven have\n$[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-3.5$. The sample is selected from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey / Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration\n(SDSS/SEGUE), and our previous high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with the\nSubaru Telescope (Aoki et al.). Several methods to derive stellar parameters\nare compared, and no significant offset in the derived parameters is found in\nmost cases. From an abundance analysis relative to the standard extremely\nmetal-poor star G 64-12, an average Li abundance for stars with\n$[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-3.5$ is $A(\\mathrm{Li}) =1.90$, with a standard deviation of\n$\\sigma =0.10$ dex. This result confirms that lower Li abundances are found at\nlower metallicity, as suggested by previous studies, and demonstrates that the\nstar-to-star scatter is small. The small observed scatter could be a strong\nconstraint on Li-depletion mechanisms proposed for explaining the low Li\nabundance at lower metallicity. Our analysis for other elements obtained the\nfollowing results: i) A statistically significant scatter in $[\\mathrm{X/Fe}]$\nfor Na, Mg, Cr, Ti, Sr, and Ba, and an apparent bimodality in\n$[\\mathrm{Na/Fe}]$ with a separation of $\\sim 0.8\\, \\mathrm{dex}$, ii) an\nabsence of a sharp drop in the metallicity distribution, and iii) the existence\nof a CEMP-$s$ star at $[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]\\simeq -3.6$ and possibly at\n$[\\mathrm{Fe/H}]\\simeq-4.0$, which may provide a constraint on the mixing\nefficiency of unevolved stars during their main-sequence phase.\n", "  Recent observations near the Galactic Centre have found several molecular\nfilaments displaying striking helically-wound morphology, which are\ncollectively known as \"molecular tornadoes.\" We investigate the equilibrium\nstructure of these molecular tornadoes by formulating a magnetohydrodynamic\nmodel of a rotating, helically magnetized filament. A special analytical\nsolution is derived where centrifugal forces balance exactly with toroidal\nmagnetic stress. From the physics of torsional Alfv\\'{e}n waves, we derive a\nconstraint that links the toroidal flux-to-mass ratio and the pitch angle of\nthe helical field to the rotation laws, which we find to be an important\ncomponent in describing molecular tornado structure. The models are compared to\nthe Ostriker solution for isothermal, non-magnetic, non-rotating filaments. We\nfind that neither the analytic model nor the Alfv\\'{e}n wave model suffer from\nunphysical density inversions noted by other authors. A Monte Carlo exploration\nof our parameter space is constrained by observational measurements of the\nPigtail Molecular Cloud (Pigtail), Double Helix Nebula (DHN), and Galactic\nCentre molecular Tornado (GCT). Observable properties such as the velocity\ndispersion, filament radius, linear mass, and surface pressure can be used to\nderive three dimensionless constraints for our dimensionless models of these\nthree objects. A virial analysis of these constrained models is studied for\nthese three molecular tornadoes. We find that self-gravity is relatively\nunimportant, whereas magnetic fields, and external pressure play a dominant\nrole in the confinement and equilibrium radial structure of these objects.\n", "  Hydrogen-deficient Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are potential candidates of Type\nIb/Ic supernova (SN Ib/Ic) progenitors and their evolution is governed by mass\nloss. Stellar evolution models with the most popular prescription for WR\nmass-loss rates given by Nugis & Lamers have difficulties in explaining the\nluminosity distribution of WR stars of WC and WO types and the SN Ic progenitor\nproperties. Here we suggest some improvements in the WR mass-loss rate\nprescription and discuss its implications for the evolution of WR stars and SN\nIb/Ic progenitors. Recent studies on Galactic WR stars clearly indicate that\nthe mass-loss rates of WC stars are systematically higher than those of WNE\nstars for a given luminosity. The luminosity and initial metallicity\ndependencies of WNE mass-loss rates are also significantly different from those\nof WC stars. These factors have not been adequately considered together in\nprevious stellar evolution models. We also find that an overall increase of WR\nmass loss rates by about 60 per cent compared to the empirical values obtained\nwith a clumping factor of 10 is needed to explain the most faint WC/WO stars.\nThis moderate increase with our new WR mas-loss rate prescription results in SN\nIb/Ic progenitor models more consistent with observations than those given by\nthe Nugis & Lamers prescription. In particular, our new models predict that the\nproperties of SN Ib and SN Ic progenitors are distinctively different, rather\nthan they form a continuous sequence.\n", "  Spectral features from PAH molecules observed in the mid-IR range are\ntypically used to infer the amount of recent and ongoing star formation (SF) on\nkpc scales around AGN where more traditional methods fail. This assumes that\nthe observed PAH features are excited predominantly by SF. With current\nground-based telescopes and the upcoming JWST, much smaller spatial scales can\nbe probed and we aim at testing this assumption in the range of few tens to few\nhundreds of pc. For that, we spatially map the emitted 11.3{\\mu}m PAH surface\nflux as a function of distance from 0.4-4 arcsec from the centre in 28 nearby\nAGN using ground-based high-angular resolution mid-IR spectroscopy. We detect\nand extract the 11.3{\\mu}m PAH feature in 13 AGN. The fluxes within each\naperture are scaled to a luminosity-normalised distance from the nucleus to be\nable to compare intrinsic spatial scales of AGN radiation spanning about 2\norders of magnitude in luminosity. For this, we establish an empirical relation\nbetween the absorption-corrected X-ray luminosity and the sublimation radius in\nthese sources. Once normalised, the radial profiles of the emitted PAH surface\nflux show similar radial slopes, with a power-law index of approximately -1.1,\nand similar absolute values, consistent within a factor of a few of each other\nas expected from the uncertainty in the intrinsic scale estimate. We interpret\nthis as evidence that the profiles are caused by a common compact central\nphysical process, either the AGN itself or circumnuclear SF linked in strength\nto the AGN power. A photoionisation-based model of an AGN exciting dense clouds\nin its environment can reproduce the observed radial slope and confirms that\nthe AGN radiation field is strong enough to explain the observed PAH surface\nfluxes within ~10-500 pc of the nucleus. Our results advice caution in the use\nof PAH emission as a SF tracer within a kpc around AGN.\n", "  Measurements of the single photoionization cross section of Cu-like Zn$^+$\nions are reported in the energy (wavelength) range 17.5 eV (709 \\AA) to 90 eV\n(138 \\AA). The measurements on this {\\it trans}-Fe element were performed at\nthe Advanced Light Source synchrotron radiation facility in Berkeley,\nCalifornia at a photon energy resolution of 17 meV using the photon-ion\nmerged-beams end-station. Below 30 eV the spectrum is dominated by excitation\nautoionizing resonance states. The experimental results are compared with\nlarge-scale photoionization cross-section calculations performed using a\nDirac-Coulomb $R$-matrix approximation. Comparison are made with previous\nexperimental studies, resonance states are identified and contributions from\nmetastable states of Zn$^+$ determined.\n", "  We present new spatially resolved observations of MWC 349A from the Large\nBinocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI), a 23-meter baseline interferometer\nmade up of two, co-mounted 8-meter telescopes. MWC 349A is a B[e] star with an\nunknown evolutionary state. Proposed scenarios range from a young stellar\nobject (YSO), to a B[e] supergiant, to a tight binary system. Radio continuum\nand recombination line observations of this source revealed a sub-arcsecond\nbipolar outflow surrounding a ~100 mas circumstellar disk. Followup infrared\nstudies detected the disk, and suggested that it may have skew and an inner\nclearing. Our new infrared interferometric observations, which have more than\ntwice the resolution of previously-published datasets, support the presence of\nboth skew and a compact infrared excess. They rule out inner clearings with\nradii greater than ~14 mas. We show the improvements in disk parameter\nconstraints provided by LBTI, and discuss the inferred disk parameters in the\ncontext of the posited evolutionary states for MWC 349A.\n", "  We present a study of the relation between galaxy stellar age and mass for 14\nmembers of the $z=1.62$ protocluster IRC 0218, using multiband imaging and HST\nG102 and G141 grism spectroscopy. Using $UVJ$ colors to separate galaxies into\nstar forming and quiescent populations, we find that at stellar masses $M_*\n\\geq 10^{10.85} M_{\\odot}$, the quiescent fraction in the protocluster is\n$f_Q=1.0^{+0.00}_{-0.37}$, consistent with a $\\sim 2\\times $ enhancement\nrelative to the field value, $f_Q=0.45^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$. At masses $10^{10.2}\nM_{\\odot} \\leq M_* \\leq 10^{10.85} M_{\\odot}$, $f_Q$ in the cluster is\n$f_Q=0.40^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$, consistent with the field value of\n$f_Q=0.28^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. Using galaxy $D_{n}(4000)$ values derived from the\nG102 spectroscopy, we find no relation between galaxy stellar age and mass.\nThese results may reflect the impact of merger-driven mass redistribution,\nwhich is plausible as this cluster is known to host many dry mergers.\nAlternately, they may imply that the trend in $f_Q$ in IRC 0218 was imprinted\nover a short timescale in the protocluster's assembly history. Comparing our\nresults with those of other high-redshift studies and studies of clusters at\n$z\\sim 1$, we determine that our observed relation between $f_Q$ and stellar\nmass only mildly evolves between $z\\sim 1.6$ and $z \\sim 1$, and only at\nstellar masses $M_* \\leq 10^{10.85} M_{\\odot}$. Both the $z\\sim 1$ and $z\\sim\n1.6$ results are in agreement that the red sequence in dense environments was\nalready populated at high redshift, $z \\ge 3$, placing constraints on the\nmechanism(s) responsible for quenching in dense environments at $z\\ge 1.5$\n", "  Black-hole and neutron-star X-ray binaries exhibit compact radio jets, when\nthey are in the so called quiescent, hard, or hard intermediate states. The\nradio spectrum in these states is flat to slightly inverted. It is widely\naccepted that the energy distribution of the electrons, in the rest frame of\nthe jet, is a power law with index p. A power-law energy distribution of the\nelectrons in the jet is sufficient to explain the flat to slightly inverted\nspectrum emitted by the jet from radio to near infrared wavelengths, but is it\nnecessary? Contrary to what our thinking was decades ago, now we know that the\njets originate in the hot inner flow around black holes and neutron stars.\nThus, we have investigated the spectrum that is emitted by a thermal jet with\nkT in the range 100-250 keV. We have computed the emitted spectrum from radio\nto near infrared using either a thermal distribution of electrons or a\npower-law one. We have found that parabolic jets with a thermal distribution of\nelectrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the range 0-0.4, while jets with\na power-law distribution of electrons give inverted spectra with alpha in the\nrange 0-0.2. The rest of the parameters are kept the same in the two cases. The\nbreak frequency, which marks the transition from optically thick to optically\nthin synchrotron emission, is comparable for the two electron energy\ndistributions. Our conclusion is that, contrary to common belief, it is not\nnecessary to invoke a power-law energy distribution of the electrons in a jet\nto explain its flat to slightly inverted radio spectrum. A relativistic\nMaxwellian produces similar spectra. Thus, the widely invoked corona around\nblack holes in X-ray binaries may actually be the jet.\n", "  The accumulating, but small, set of large semi-major axis trans-Neptunian\nobjects (TNOs) shows an apparent clustering in the orientations of their\norbits. This clustering must either be representative of the intrinsic\ndistribution of these TNOs, or else arise as a result of observation biases\nand/or statistically expected variations for such a small set of detected\nobjects. The clustered TNOs were detected across different and independent\nsurveys, which has led to claims that the detections are therefore free of\nobservational bias. This apparent clustering has led to the so-called \"Planet\n9\" hypothesis that a super-Earth currently resides in the distant solar system\nand causes this clustering. The Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) is a\nlarge program that ran on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from 2013--2017,\ndiscovering more than 800 new TNOs. One of the primary design goals of OSSOS\nwas the careful determination of observational biases that would manifest\nwithin the detected sample. We demonstrate the striking and non-intuitive\nbiases that exist for the detection of TNOs with large semi-major axes. The\neight large semi-major axis OSSOS detections are an independent dataset, of\ncomparable size to the conglomerate samples used in previous studies. We\nconclude that the orbital distribution of the OSSOS sample is consistent with\nbeing detected from a uniform underlying angular distribution.\n", "  We present the first results of an ongoing variability monitoring program of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the 46\\,cm telescope of the Wise\nobservatory in Israel. The telescope has a field of view of $1.25^{\\circ}\n\\times 0.84^{\\circ}$ and is specially equipped with five narrow band filters at\n4300, 5200, 5700, 6200 and 7000\\,\\AA\\, in order to perform photometric\nreverberation mapping studies of the central engine of AGNs. The program aims\nto observe a sample of 27 AGNs (V $<17$ mag) selected according to tentative\ncontinuum and line time delay measurements obtained in previous works. We\ndescribe the autonomous operation of the telescope together with the fully\nautomatic pipeline used to achieve high-performance unassisted observations,\ndata reduction, and light curves extraction using different photometric\nmethods. The science verification data presented here, demonstrates the\nperformance of the monitoring program in particular for efficiently photometric\nreverberation mapping of AGNs with additional capabilities to carry out\ncomplementary studies of other transient and variable phenomena such as\nvariable stars studies.\n", "  The main objective of this work is to determine the cluster members of 1876\nopen clusters, using positions and proper motions of the astrometric catalogue\nUCAC4. For this purpose we apply three different methods, all them based on a\nBayesian approach, but with different formulations: a purely parametric method,\nanother completely non-parametric algorithm, and a third, recently developed by\nSampedro & Alfaro, using both formulations at different steps of the whole\nprocess. The first and second statistical moments of the members phase-space\nsubspace, obtained after applying the three methods, are compared for every\ncluster. Although, on average, the three methods yield similar results,\nspecific differences between them, as well as for some particular clusters, are\nalso present. The comparison with other published catalogues shows good\nagreement. We have also estimated for the first time the mean proper motion for\na sample of 18 clusters. The results are organized in a single catalogue formed\nby two main files, one with the most relevant information for each cluster,\npartially including that in UCAC4, and the other showing the individual\nmembership probabilities for each star in the cluster area. The final\ncatalogue, with an interface design that enables an easy interaction with the\nuser, is available in electronic format at SSG-IAA\n(http://ssg.iaa.es/en/content/sampedro-cluster-catalog) website.\n", "  We present the high-energy emission properties of GRB 160509A, from its\nprompt mission to late afterglow phase. GRB 160509A contains two emission\nepisodes: 0-40s and 280-420s after the burst onset (t0). The relatively high\nfluence of GRB 160509A allows us to establish an evolving spectrum above 100\nMeV. During the first emission episode, the >100 MeV spectrum is soft with\n\\Gamma=>3.0, which can be smoothly connected to keV energies with a Band\nfunction with a high-energy cutoff. The >100 MeV spectrum rapidly changes to a\nhard spectrum with \\Gamma<=1.5 after t0+40s. The existence of very energetic\nphotons, e.g., a 52 GeV that arrives t0+77 seconds, and a 29 GeV that arrives\nt0+70 ks, is hard to reconcile by the synchrotron emission from forward-shock\nelectrons, but likely due to inverse Compton mechanism (e.g., synchrotron\nself-Compton emission). A soft spectrum (\\Gamma~2) between 300s and 1000s after\nthe burst onset is also found at a significance of about 2 standard deviations,\nwhich suggests a different emission mechanism at work for this short period of\ntime. GRB 160509A represents the latest example where inverse Compton emission\nhas to be taken into account in explaining the afterglow GeV emission, which\nhad been suggested long before the launch of Fermi LAT.\n", "  We present the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas in the\ncircumnuclear disk (CND, 400 pc x 200 pc) of Centaurus A with resolutions of ~5\npc (0.3 arcsec) and shed light onto the mechanism feeding the Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN) using CO(3-2), HCO+(4-3), HCN(4-3), and CO(6-5) observations\nobtained with ALMA. Multiple filaments or streamers of tens to a hundred parsec\nscale exist within the CND, which form a ring-like structure with an\nunprojected diameter of 9 x 6 arcsec (162pc x 108pc) and a position angle PA =\n155deg. Inside the nuclear ring, there are two leading and straight filamentary\nstructures with lengths of about 30-60pc at PA = 120deg on opposite sides of\nthe AGN, with a rotational symmetry of 180deg and steeper position-velocity\ndiagrams, which are interpreted as nuclear shocks due to non-circular motions.\nAlong the filaments, and unlike other nearby AGNs, several dense molecular\nclumps present low HCN/HCO+(4-3) ratios (~0.5). The filaments abruptly end in\nthe probed transitions at r = 20pc from the AGN, but previous near-IR H2\n(J=1-0) S(1) maps show that they continue in an even ~1000 K), winding up in\nthe form of nuclear spirals, and forming an inner ring structure with another\nset of symmetric filaments along the N-S direction and within r = 10pc. The\nmolecular gas is governed primarily by non-circular motions, being the\nsuccessive shock fronts at different scales where loss of angular momentum\noccurs, a mechanism which may feed efficiently powerful radio galaxies down to\nparsec scales.\n", "  Bulk diamond phonons have been shown to be a versatile platform for the\ngeneration, storage, and manipulation of high-bandwidth quantum states of\nlight. Here we demonstrate a diamond quantum memory that stores, and releases\non demand, an arbitrarily polarized $\\sim$250 fs duration photonic qubit. The\nsingle-mode nature of the memory is overcome by mapping the two degrees of\npolarization of the qubit, via Raman transitions, onto two spatially distinct\noptical phonon modes located in the same diamond crystal. The two modes are\ncoherently recombined upon retrieval and quantum process tomography confirms\nthat the memory faithfully reproduces the input state with average fidelity\n$0.784\\pm0.004$ with a total memory efficiency of $(0.76\\pm0.03)\\%$. In an\nadditional demonstration, one photon of a polarization-entangled pair is stored\nin the memory. We report that entanglement persists in the retrieved state for\nup to 1.3 ps of storage time. These results demonstrate that the diamond phonon\nplatform can be used in concert with polarization qubits, a key requirement for\npolarization-encoded photonic processing.\n", "  Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we investigate\nthe eruption of coronal flux ropes underlying coronal streamers and the\ndevelopment of a prominence eruption. We initialize a quasi-steady solution of\na coronal helmet streamer, into which we impose at the lower boundary the slow\nemergence of a part of a twisted magnetic torus. As a result a\nquasi-equilibrium flux rope is built up under the streamer. With varying sizes\nof the streamer and the different length and total twist of the emerged flux\nrope, we found different scenarios for the evolution from quasi-equilibrium to\neruption. In the cases with a broad streamer, the flux rope remains well\nconfined until there is sufficient twist such that it first develops the kink\ninstability and evolves through a sequence of kinked, confined states with\nincreasing height until it eventually develops a \"hernia-like\" ejective\neruption. For the significantly twisted flux ropes, prominence condensations\nform in the dips of the twisted field lines due to run-away radiative cooling.\nOnce formed, the prominence carrying field becomes significantly non-force-free\ndue to the prominence weight despite being low plasma $\\beta$. As the flux rope\nerupts, we obtain the eruption of the prominence, which shows substantial\ndraining along the legs of the erupting flux rope. The prominence may not show\na kinked morphology even though the flux rope becomes kinked. On the other\nhand, in the case with a narrow streamer, the flux rope with less than 1 wind\nof twist can erupt via the onset of the torus instability.\n", "  An important class of real-world networks have directed edges, and in\naddition, some rank ordering on the nodes, for instance the \"popularity\" of\nusers in online social networks. Yet, nearly all research related to explosive\npercolation has been restricted to undirected networks. Furthermore,\ninformation on such rank ordered networks typically flows from higher ranked to\nlower ranked individuals, such as follower relations, replies and retweets on\nTwitter.\n  Here we introduce a simple percolation process on an ordered, directed\nnetwork where edges are added monotonically with respect to the rank ordering.\nWe show with a numerical approach that the emergence of a dominant strongly\nconnected component appears to be discontinuous. Large scale connectivity\noccurs at very high density compared with most percolation processes, and this\nholds not just for the strongly connected component structure but for the\nweakly connected component structure as well. We present analysis with\nbranching processes which explains this unusual behavior and gives basic\nintuition for the underlying mechanisms. We also show that before the emergence\nof a dominant strongly connected component, multiple giant strongly connected\ncomponents may exist simultaneously. By adding a competitive percolation rule\nwith a small bias to link uses of similar rank, we show this leads to formation\nof two distinct components, one of high ranked users, and one of low ranked\nusers, with little flow between the two components.\n", "  The stability of the magnetic field in the solar corona is important for\nunderstanding the causes of solar eruptions. Although various scenarios have\nbeen suggested to date, the tether-cutting reconnection scenario proposed by\nMoore et al.(2001) is one of the widely accepted models to explain the onset\nprocess of solar eruptions. Although the tether-cutting reconnection scenario\nproposed that sigmoidal field formed by the internal reconnection is the\nmagnetic field in pre-eruptive state, the stability of the sigmoidal field has\nnot yet been investigated quantitatively. In this paper, in order to elucidate\nthe stability problem of pre-eruptive state, we developed a simple numerical\nanalysis, in which the sigmoidal field is modeled by a double arc electric\ncurrent loop and its stability is analyzed. As a result, we found that the\ndouble arc loop is more easily destabilized than the axisymmetric torus, and it\nbecomes unstable even if the external field does not decay with altitude, which\nis in contrast to the axisymmetric torus instability. This suggests that the\ntether-cutting reconnection may well work as the onset mechanism of solar\neruptions, and if so the critical condition for eruption under certain geometry\nmay be determined by a new type of instability rather than the torus\ninstability. Based on them, we propose a new type of instability called double\narc instability (DAI). We discuss the critical conditions for DAI and derive a\nnew parameter $\\kappa$ defined as the product of the magnetic twist and the\nnormalized flux of tether-cutting reconnection.\n", "  New time-resolved optical spectroscopic echelle observations of the nova-like\ncataclysmic variable RW Sextantis were obtained, with the aim to study the\nproperties of emission features in the system. The profile of the H_alpha\nemission line can be clearly divided into two (`narrow' and `wide') components.\nSimilar emission profiles are observed in another nova-like system,\n1RXS~J064434.5+33445, for which we also reanalysed the spectral data and\nredetermined the system parameters. The source of the `narrow', low-velocity\ncomponent is the irradiated face of the secondary star. We disentangled and\nremoved the `narrow' component from the H_alpha profile to study the origin and\nstructure of the region emitting the wide component. We found that the `wide'\ncomponent is not related to the white dwarf or the wind from the central part\nof the accretion disc, but is emanated from the outer side of the disc.\nInspection of literature on similar systems indicates that this feature is\ncommon for some other long-period nova-like variables. We propose that the\nsource of the `wide' component is an extended, low-velocity region in the\noutskirts of the opposite side of the accretion disc, with respect to the\ncollision point of the accretion stream and the disc.\n", "  We present the imaging and spectroscopic analysis of the combined Chandra\nACIS-S observations of the Compton-thick Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4945. We\nperformed a spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the circumnuclear environment of\nthe source, picturing the innermost 200 parsecs around the highly absorbed\nnucleus. The additional 200 ks ACIS-S data with respect to the previous\ncampaign allowed us to map with even greater detail the central structure of\nthis source and to discover an enhanced iron emission in the innermost nuclear\nregion, with respect to the associated Compton reflection continuum. We\nrevealed that the Equivalent Width of the iron K$\\alpha$ line is spatially\nvariable (ranging from 0.5 to 3 keV), on scales of tens of parsecs, likely due\nto the ionization state and orientation effects of the reprocessing material,\nwith respect to the central X-ray illuminating source. A clump of highly\nionized Fe XXV He-$\\alpha$ is also detected, 40 parsecs east to the nucleus.\nWhen observations taken years apart are considered, the central unresolved\nreflected emission is found to remain constant.\n", "  Bright and fast gamma-ray flares with hard spectra have been recently\ndetected from the blazar 3C 279, with apparent GeV luminosities up to $10^{49}$\nerg/s. The source is observed to flicker on timescales of minutes with no\ncomparable optical-UV counterparts. Such observations challenge current models\nof high-energy emissions from 3C 279 and similar blazar sources that are\ndominated by relativistic jets along our line of sight with bulk Lorentz\nfactors up to $ \\Gamma \\sim 20$ launched by supermassive black holes. We\ncompute and discuss a model based on a clumpy jet comprising strings of compact\nplasmoids as indicated by radio observations. We follow the path of the\nsynchrotron radiations emitted in the optical - UV bands by relativistic\nelectrons accelerated around the plasmoids to isotropic Lorentz factors $\\gamma\n\\sim 1000$. These primary emissions are partly reflected back by a leading\nmember in the string that acts as a moving mirror for the approaching\ncompanions. Around the plasmoids, shrinking \\emph{gap} transient overdensities\nof seed photons build up. These are upscattered into the GeV range by inverse\nCompton interactions with the relativistic electrons accelerated in situ. We\nshow that such a combined process produces bright gamma-ray flares with minor\noptical to X-ray enhancements. Main features of our model include: bright\ngamma-ray flares with risetimes as short as a few minutes, occurring at\ndistances of order $10^{18} $ cm from the central black hole; Compton dominance\nat GeV energies by factors up to some $10^2$; little reabsorption from local\nphoton-photon interactions.\n", "  We evaluate the dynamical stability of a selection of outer solar system\nobjects in the presence of the proposed new Solar System member Planet Nine. We\nuse a Monte Carlo suite of numerical N-body integrations to construct a variety\nof orbital elements of the new planet and evaluate the dynamical stability of\neight Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) in the presence of Planet Nine. These\nsimulations show that some combinations of orbital elements ($a,e$) result in\nPlanet Nine acting as a stabilizing influence on the TNOs, which can otherwise\nbe destabilized by interactions with Neptune. These simulations also suggest\nthat some TNOs transition between several different mean-motion resonances\nduring their lifetimes while still retaining approximate apsidal anti-alignment\nwith Planet Nine. This behavior suggests that remaining in one particular orbit\nis not a requirement for orbital stability. As one product of our simulations,\nwe present an {\\it a posteriori} probability distribution for the semi-major\naxis and eccentricity of the proposed Planet Nine based on TNO stability. This\nresult thus provides additional evidence that supports the existence of this\nproposed planet. We also predict that TNOs can be grouped into multiple\npopulations of objects that interact with Planet Nine in different ways: one\npopulation may contain objects like Sedna and 2012 VP$_{113}$, which do not\nmigrate significantly in semi-major axis in the presence of Planet Nine and\ntend to stay in the same resonance; another population may contain objects like\n2007 TG$_{422}$ and 2013 RF$_{98}$, which may both migrate and transition\nbetween different resonances.\n", "  We report bound states in the radiation continuum (BSCs) in a single\ninfinitely long dielectric rod with periodically stepwise modulated\npermittivity alternating from $\\epsilon_1$ to $\\epsilon_2$. For $\\epsilon_2=1$\nin air the rod is equivalent to a stack of dielectric discs with permittivity\n$\\epsilon_1$. Because of rotational and translational symmetries the BSCs are\nclassified by orbital angular momentum $m$ and the Bloch wave vector $\\beta$\ndirected along the rod. For $m=0$ and $\\beta=0$ the symmetry protected BSCs\nhave definite polarization and occur in a wide range of the radius of the rod\nand the dielectric permittivities. More involved BSCs with $m\\neq 0, \\beta=0$\nexist only for a selected radius of the rod at a fixed dielectric constant. The\nexistence of robust Bloch BSCs with $\\beta\\neq 0, m=0$ is demonstrated.\nAsymptotic limits to a homogeneous rod and to very thin discs are also\nconsidered.\n", "  A systematic study on the long-term periodicities of known Galactic\ncataclysmic variables (CVs) was conducted. Among 1580 known CVs, 344 sources\nwere matched and extracted from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) data\nrepository. The PTF light curves were combined with the Catalina Real-Time\nTransient Survey (CRTS) light curves and analyzed. Ten targets were found to\nexhibit long-term periodic variability, which is not frequently observed in the\nCV systems. These long-term variations are possibly caused by various\nmechanisms, such as the precession of the accretion disk, hierarchical triple\nstar system, magnetic field change of the companion star, and other possible\nmechanisms. We discuss the possible mechanisms in this study. If the long-term\nperiod is less than several tens of days, the disk precession period scenario\nis favored. However, the hierarchical triple star system or the variations in\nmagnetic field strengths are most likely the predominant mechanisms for longer\nperiods.\n", "  Oxygen isotopes in marine cherts have been used to infer hot oceans during\nthe Archean with temperatures between 60{\\deg}C (333 K) and 80{\\deg}C (353 K).\nSuch climates are challenging for the early Earth warmed by the faint young\nSun. The interpretation of the data has therefore been controversial. 1D\nclimate modeling inferred that such hot climates would require very high levels\nof CO2 (2-6 bars). Previous carbon cycle modeling concluded that such stable\nhot climates were impossible and that the carbon cycle should lead to cold\nclimates during the Hadean and the Archean. Here, we revisit the climate and\ncarbon cycle of the early Earth at 3.8 Ga using a 3D climate-carbon model. We\nfind that CO2 partial pressures of around 1 bar could have produced hot\nclimates given a low land fraction and cloud feedback effects. However, such\nhigh CO2 partial pressures should not have been stable because of the\nweathering of terrestrial and oceanic basalts, producing an efficient\nstabilizing feedback. Moreover, the weathering of impact ejecta during the Late\nHeavy Bombardment (LHB) would have strongly reduced the CO2 partial pressure\nleading to cold climates and potentially snowball Earth events after large\nimpacts. Our results therefore favor cold or temperate climates with global\nmean temperatures between around 8{\\deg}C (281 K) and 30{\\deg}C (303 K) and\nwith 0.1-0.36 bar of CO2 for the late Hadean and early Archean. Finally, our\nmodel suggests that the carbon cycle was efficient for preserving clement\nconditions on the early Earth without necessarily requiring any other\ngreenhouse gas or warming process.\n", "  We present the discovery of d1005+68, a new faint dwarf galaxy in the M81\nGroup, using observations taken with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. d1005+68's\ncolor-magnitude diagram is consistent with a distance of $3.98_{-0.43}^{+0.39}$\nMpc, establishing group membership. We derive an absolute $V$-band magnitude,\nfrom stellar isochrone fitting, of $M_{V} = -7.94_{-0.50}^{+0.38}$, with a\nhalf-light radius of $r_{h} = 188_{-41}^{+39}$ pc. These place d1005+68 within\nthe radius-luminosity locus of Local Group and M81 satellites and among the\nfaintest confirmed satellites outside the Local Group. Assuming an age of 12\nGyr, d1005+68's red giant branch is best fit by an isochrone of [Fe/H] $= -1.90\n\\pm 0.24$. It has a projected separation from nearby M81 satellite BK5N of only\n5 kpc. As this is well within BK5N's virial radius, we speculate that d1005+68\nmay be a satellite of BK5N. If confirmed, this would make d1005+68 one of the\nfirst detected satellites-of-a-satellite.\n", "  We investigate the distribution of waiting times between electrons emitted\nfrom a periodically driven single-electron turnstile. To this end, we develop a\nscheme for analytic calculations of the waiting time distributions for\narbitrary periodic driving protocols. We illustrate the general framework by\nconsidering a driven tunnel junction before moving on to the more involved\nsingle-electron turnstile. The waiting time distributions are evaluated at low\ntemperatures for square-wave and harmonic driving protocols. In the adiabatic\nregime, the dynamics of the turnstile is synchronized with the external drive.\nAs the non-adiabatic regime is approached, the waiting time distribution\nbecomes dominated by cycle-missing events in which the turnstile fails to emit\nwithin one or several periods. We also discuss the influence of finite\nelectronic temperatures. The waiting time distributions provide a useful\ncharacterization of the driven single-electron turnstile with complementary\ninformation compared to what can be learned from conventional current\nmeasurements.\n", "  We performed low-resolution spectroscopy for the red giant stars in the\nGalactic globular cluster (GC) NGC 5286, which is known to show intrinsic heavy\nelement abundance variations. We found that the observed stars in this GC are\nclearly divided into three subpopulations by CN index (CN-weak,\nCN-intermediate, and CN-strong). The CN-strong stars are also enhanced in the\ncalcium HK' (7.4{\\sigma}) and CH (5.1{\\sigma}) indices, while the\nCN-intermediate stars show no significant difference in the strength of HK'\nindex with CN-weak stars. From the comparison with high-resolution\nspectroscopic data, we found that the CN- and HK'-strong stars are also\nenhanced in the abundances of Fe and s-process elements. It appears, therefore,\nthat these stars are later generation stars affected by some supernovae\nenrichment in addition to the asymptotic giant branch ejecta. In addition,\nunlike normal GCs, sample stars in NGC 5286 show the CN-CH positive\ncorrelation, strengthening our previous suggestion that this positive\ncorrelation is only discovered in GCs with heavy element abundance variations\nsuch as M22 and NGC 6273.\n", "  We create the first quantitative model for the early lunar atmosphere,\ncoupled with a magma ocean crystallization model. Immediately after formation,\nthe moon's surface was subject to a radiative environment that included\ncontributions from the early Sun, a post-impact Earth that radiated like a\nmid-type M dwarf star, and a cooling global magma ocean. This radiative\nenvironment resulted in a largely Earth-side atmosphere on the Moon, ranging\nfrom $\\sim$10$^4$ to $\\sim$10$^2$ pascals, composed of heavy volatiles (Na and\nSiO). This atmosphere persisted through lid formation and was additionally\ncharacterized by supersonic winds that transported significant quantities of\nmoderate volatiles and likely generated magma ocean waves. The existence of\nthis atmosphere may have influenced the distribution of some moderate volatiles\nand created temperature asymmetries which influenced ocean flow and cooling.\nSuch asymmetries may characterize young, tidally locked rocky bodies with\nglobal magma oceans and subject to intense irradiation.\n", "  In this Letter we propose a formation channel for low-mass X-ray binaries\nwith black hole accretors and non-degenerate donors via grazing tidal\nencounters with subgiants. We estimate that in a typically dense globular\ncluster with the core density of $10^5$ stars pc$^{-3}$, the formation rates\nare about one binary per Gyr per 50-100 retained black holes. The donors --\nstripped subgiants -- will be strongly underluminous when compared to subgiant\nor giant branch stars of the same colors. The products of tidal stripping are\nunderluminous by at least one magnitude for several hundred million years, when\ncompared to normal stars of the same color, and differ from underluminous red\nstars that could be produced by non-catastrophic mass transfer in an ordinary\nbinary. The dynamically formed binaries become quiescent low-mass X-ray\nbinaries, with lifetimes of about a Gyr. The expected number of X-ray binaries\nis one per 50-200 retained black holes, while the expected number of strongly\nunderluminous subsubgiant is about half this. The presence of strongly\nunderluminous stars in a globular cluster may be indicative of black holes\npresence.\n", "  Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are absorption features commonly observed\nin optical/near-infrared spectra of stars and thought to be associated with\npolyatomic molecules that comprise a significant reservoir of organic material\nin the universe. However, the central wavelengths of almost all DIBs do not\ncorrespond with electronic transitions of known atomic or molecular species and\nthe specific physical nature of their carriers remains inconclusive despite\ndecades of observational, theoretical, and experimental research. It is well\nestablished that DIB carriers are located in the interstellar medium, but the\nrecent discovery of time-varying DIBs in the spectra of the extragalactic\nsupernova SN2012ap suggests that some may be created in massive star\nenvironments. Here we report evidence of short time-scale (10-60 d) changes in\nDIB absorption line substructure toward 3 of 17 massive stars observed as part\nof a pathfinder survey of variable DIBs conducted with the 1.5-m Tillinghast\ntelescope and Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) at Fred L.\nWhipple Observatory. The detections are made in high-resolution optical spectra\n(R = 44000) having signal-to-noise ratios of 5-15 around the 5797 and 6614\nangstrom features, and are considered significant but requiring further\ninvestigation. We find that these changes are potentially consistent with\ninteractions between stellar winds and DIB carriers in close proximity. Our\nfindings motivate a larger survey to further characterize these variations and\nmay establish a powerful new method for probing the poorly understood physical\ncharacteristics of DIB carriers.\n", "  The circumstellar environments of objects on the asymptotic giant branch and\nbeyond are rich in molecular species. Nevertheless, methanol has never been\ndetected in such an object, and is therefore often taken as a clear signpost\nfor a young stellar object. However, we report the first detection of CH3OH in\na post-AGB object, HD101584, using ALMA. Its emission, together with emissions\nfrom CO, SiO, SO, CS, and H2CO, comes from two extreme velocity spots on either\nside of the object where a high-velocity outflow appears to interact with the\nsurrounding medium. We have derived molecular abundances, and propose that the\ndetected molecular species are the effect of a post-shock chemistry where\ncircumstellar grains play a role. We further provide evidence that HD101584 was\na low-mass, M-type AGB star.\n", "  We investigate a sample of 3 dwarf elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster\nwhich have significant reservoirs of HI. We present deep optical imaging (from\nCFHT and KPNO), HI spectra (Arecibo) and resolved HI imaging (VLA) of this\nsample. These observations confirm their HI content and optical morphologies,\nand indicate that the gas is unlikely to be recently accreted. The sample has\nmore in common with dwarf transitionals, although dwarf transitionals are\ngenerally lower in stellar mass and gas fraction. VCC 190 has an HI tidal tail\nfrom a recent encounter with the massive spiral galaxy NGC 4224. In VCC 611,\nblue star-forming features are observed which were unseen by shallower SDSS\nimaging.\n", "  We have developed a digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrometer made of\nan analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a field-programmable gate array\n(FPGA). The base instrument has independent ADC and FPGA modules, which allow\nus to implement different spectrometers in a relatively easy manner. Two types\nof spectrometers have been instrumented, one with 4.096 GS/s sampling speed and\n2048 frequency channels and the other with 2.048 GS/s sampling speed and 32768\nfrequency channels. The signal processing in these spectrometers has no dead\ntime and the accumulated spectra are recorded in external media every 8 ms. A\ndirect sampling spectroscopy up to 8 GHz is achieved by a microwave\ntrack-and-hold circuit, which can reduce the analog receiver in front of the\nspectrometer. Highly stable spectroscopy with a wide dynamic range was\ndemonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments and test observations of\nsolar radio bursts.\n", "  The extent of the accretion disk in the low/hard state of stellar mass black\nhole X-ray binaries remains an open question. There are some evidence\nsuggesting that the inner accretion disk is truncated and replaced by a hot\nflow, while the detection of relativistic broadened iron emission lines seems\nto require an accretion disk extending fully to the innermost stable circular\norbit. We present comprehensive spectral and timing analyses of six Nuclear\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4\ntaken during outburst decay during the autumn of 2015. Using a spectral model\nconsisting of a thermal accretion disk, Comptonized emission, and a\nrelativistic reflection component we obtain a decreasing photon index,\nconsistent with an X-ray binary during outburst decay. Although, we observe a\ndiscrepancy in the inner radius of the accretion disk and that of the\nreflector, which can be addressed to the different underlying assumptions in\neach model, both model components indicate a truncated accretion disk that\nresiles with decreasing luminosity. The evolution of the characteristic\nfrequency in Fourier power spectra and their missing energy dependence support\nthe interpretation of a truncated and evolving disk in the hard state. The\nXMM-Newton dataset allowed us to study, for the first time, the evolution of\nthe covariance spectra and ratio during outburst decay. The covariance ratio\nincreases and steeps during outburst decay, consistent with increased disk\ninstabilities.\n", "  We use path integral Monte Carlo and density functional molecular dynamics to\nconstruct a coherent set of equation of state for a series of hydrocarbon\nmaterials with various C:H ratios (2:1, 1:1, 2:3, 1:2, and 1:4) over the range\nof $0.07-22.4$ g/cm$^{3}$ and $6.7\\times10^3-1.29\\times10^8$ K. The shock\nHugoniot curve derived for each material displays a single compression maximum\ncorresponding to $K$-shell ionization. For C:H=1:1, the compression maximum\noccurs at 4.7-fold of the initial density and we show radiation effects\nsignificantly increase the shock compression ratio above 2 Gbar, surpassing\nrelativistic effects. The single-peaked structure of the Hugoniot curves\ncontrasts with previous work on higher-$Z$ plasmas, which exhibit a two-peak\nstructure corresponding to both $K$- and $L$-shell ionization. Analysis of the\nelectronic density of states reveals that the change in Hugoniot structure is\ndue to merging of the $L$-shell eigenstates in carbon, while they remain\ndistinct for higher-$Z$ elements. Finally, we show that the isobaric-isothermal\nlinear mixing rule for carbon and hydrogen EOSs is a reasonable approximation\nwith errors better than 1% for stellar-core conditions.\n", "  We investigate the heating of an erupting prominence and loops associated\nwith a coronal mass ejection and X-class flare. The prominence is seen in\nabsorption in EUV at the beginning of its eruption. Later the prominence\nchanges to emission, which indicates heating of the erupting plasma. We find\nthe densities of the erupting prominence using the absorption properties of\nhydrogen and helium in different passbands. We estimate the temperatures and\ndensities of the erupting prominence and loops seen as emission features using\nthe differential emission measure method, which uses both EUV and X-ray\nobservations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics\nObservatory and the X-ray Telescope on board Hinode. We consider synthetic\nspectra using both photospheric and coronal abundances in these calculations.\nWe verify the methods for the estimation of temperatures and densities for the\nerupting plasmas. Then we estimate the thermal, kinetic, radiative loss,\nthermal conduction, and heating energies of the erupting prominence and loops.\nWe find that the heating of the erupting prominence and loop occurs strongly at\nearly times in the eruption. This event shows a writhing motion of the erupting\nprominence, which may indicate a hot flux rope heated by thermal energy release\nduring magnetic reconnection.\n", "  Estimates for asteroid masses are based on their gravitational perturbations\non the orbits of other objects such as Mars, spacecraft, or other asteroids\nand/or their satellites. In the case of asteroid-asteroid perturbations, this\nleads to an inverse problem in at least 13 dimensions where the aim is to\nderive the mass of the perturbing asteroid(s) and six orbital elements for both\nthe perturbing asteroid(s) and the test asteroid(s) based on astrometric\nobservations. We have developed and implemented three different mass estimation\nalgorithms utilizing asteroid-asteroid perturbations: the very rough 'marching'\napproximation, in which the asteroids' orbital elements are not fitted, thereby\nreducing the problem to a one-dimensional estimation of the mass, an\nimplementation of the Nelder-Mead simplex method, and most significantly, a\nMarkov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We describe each of these algorithms\nwith particular focus on the MCMC algorithm, and present example results using\nboth synthetic and real data. Our results agree with the published mass\nestimates, but suggest that the published uncertainties may be misleading as a\nconsequence of using linearized mass-estimation methods. Finally, we discuss\nremaining challenges with the algorithms as well as future plans.\n", "  Here we detail the dynamic evolution of localised reconnection regions about\nthree-dimensional (3D) magnetic null points by using numerical simulation. We\ndemonstrate for the first time that reconnection triggered by the localised\ncollapse of a 3D null point due to an external MHD wave involves a\nself-generated oscillation, whereby the current sheet and outflow jets undergo\na reconnection reversal process during which back-pressure formation at the jet\nheads acts to prise open the collapsed field before overshooting the\nequilibrium into an opposite-polarity configuration. The discovery that\nreconnection at fully 3D nulls can proceed naturally in a time-dependent and\nperiodic fashion is suggestive that oscillatory reconnection mechanisms may\nplay a role in explaining periodicity in astrophysical phenomena associated\nwith magnetic reconnection, such as the observed quasi-periodicity of solar and\nstellar flare emission. Furthermore, we find a consequence of oscillatory\nreconnection is the generation of a plethora of freely-propagating MHD waves\nwhich escape the vicinity of the reconnection region\n", "  We report the detection of the carbon-chain radical HC$_5$O for the first\ntime in the interstellar medium toward the dark cloud TMC-1 using the 100 m\nGreen Bank Telescope. We observe four hyperfine components of this radical in\nthe $J = 17/2 \\rightarrow 15/2$ rotational transition that originates from the\n$^2\\Pi_{1/2}$ fine structure level of its ground state, and calculate an\nabundance of $n/n_{H_2}$ = $1.7\\times 10^{-10}$, assuming an excitation\ntemperature of $T_{ex} = 7$~K. No indication of HC$_3$O, HC$_4$O, HC$_6$O, is\nfound in these or archival observations of the source, while we report\ntentative evidence for HC$_7$O. We compare calculated upper limits, and the\nabundance of HC$_5$O to predictions based on (1) the abundance trend of the\nanalogous HC$_n$N family in TMC-1 and (2) a gas-grain chemical model. We find\nthat the gas-grain chemical model well reproduces the observed abundance of\nHC$_5$O, as well as the upper limits of HC$_3$O, HC$_6$O, and HC$_7$O, but\nHC$_4$O is over produced. The prospects for astronomical detection of both\nshorter and longer HC$_n$O chains are discussed.\n", "  We have carried out the transient nonlinear transport measurements on the\nlayered cobalt oxide Ca$_3$Co$_{4}$O$_9$, in which a spin density wave (SDW)\ntransition is proposed at $T_{\\rm SDW} \\simeq 30$ K. We find that, below\n$T_{\\rm SDW}$, the electrical conductivity systematically varies with both the\napplied current and the time, indicating a close relationship between the\nobserved nonlinear conduction and the SDW order in this material. The time\ndependence of the conductivity is well analyzed by considering the dynamics of\nSDW which involves a low-field deformation and a sliding motion above a\nthreshold field. We also measure the transport properties of the isovalent\nSr-substituted systems to examine an impurity effect on the nonlinear response,\nand discuss the obtained threshold fields in terms of thermal fluctuations of\nthe SDW order parameter.\n", "  Isotopic ratios are keys to understanding the origin and early evolution of\nthe solar system in the context of Galactic nucleosynthesis. The large range of\nmeasured $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N isotopic ratios in the solar system reflects\ndistinct reservoirs of nitrogen whose origins remain to be determined. We have\ndirectly measured a C$^{14}$N/C$^{15}$N abundance ratio of 323$\\pm$30 in the\ndisk orbiting the nearby young star TW Hya. This value, which is in good\nagreement with nitrogen isotopic ratios measured for prestellar cores, likely\nreflects the primary present-day reservoir of nitrogen in the solar\nneighbourhood. These results support models invoking novae as primary $^{15}$N\nsources as well as outward migration of the Sun over its lifetime, and suggest\nthat comets sampled a secondary, $^{15}$N-rich reservoir during solar system\nformation.\n", "  We present the results from a series of ground-based radio observations\ntoward a Planck Galactic Cold Clump (PGCC), PGCC G108.84-00.81, which is\nlocated in one curved filamentary cloud in the vicinity of an extended HII\nregion Sh2-152 and SNR G109.1-1.0. PGCC G108.84-00.81 is mainly composed of two\nclumps, \"G108-N\" and \"G108-S\". In the 850 micron dust continuum emission map,\nG108-N is shown as one component while G108-S is fragmented into four\ncomponents. There is no infrared source associated with G108-N while there are\ntwo infrared sources (IRS 1 and IRS 2) associated with G108-S. The total mass\nof G108-N is larger than the jeans mass, suggesting that G108-N is\ngravitationally unstable and a potential place for a future star formation. The\nclump properties of G108-N and G108-S such as the gas temperature and the\ncolumn density, are not distinctly different. However, G108-S is slightly more\nevolved than G108-N, in the consideration of the CO depletion factor, molecular\nabundances, and association with infrared sources. G108-S seems to be affected\nby the compression from Sh2-152, while G108-N is relatively protected from the\nexternal effect\n", "  Small molecular solar cell becomes more stable when a thin\ntris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) buffer layer instead of bathocuproine\n(BCP) is inserted between the active layer and electrode. In this work, we\nintroduce a single layer device (ITO / Alq3 / Au) exposure to air to\ninvestigate the role of Alq3 in organic solar cells. The large PL intensity and\nundetectable Raman peaks of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-Hq), a degradation product of\nAlq3 through chemical reaction, indicate that the degradation of Alq3 is not\nsevere even after a few hundred hours exposure. Thus the Alq3 buffer layer\ngives a good protection of the active layers against oxygen\\water permeation\ncomparing with BCP. However, the small quantity of degraded Alq3 products can\nenhance the current density (after 15 h) in single layer Alq3 device, which is\nreflected in the decrease of parallel resistance Rp. Therefore, due to the\nenhanced charge transport and the long term better protection from ambient\noxygen/water, the lifetime of small molecular solar cell with Alq3 buffer layer\nis improved.\n", "  The interfacial structure and dynamics of water in a microscopically confined\ngeometry is imaged in three dimensions and on millisecond time scales. We\ndeveloped a 3D wide-field second harmonic microscope that employs structured\nillumination. We image pH induced chemical changes on the curved and confined\ninner and outer surfaces of a cylindrical glass micro-capillary immersed in\naqueous solution. The image contrast reports on the orientational order of\ninterfacial water, induced by charge-dipole interactions between water\nmolecules and surface charges. The images constitute surface potential maps.\nSpatially resolved surface pKa,s values are determined for the silica\ndeprotonation reaction. Values range from 2.3<pKa,s<10.7, highlighting the\nimportance of surface heterogeneities. Water molecules that rotate along an\noscillating external electric field are also imaged. With this approach, real\ntime movies of surface processes that involve flow, heterogeneities and\npotentials can be made, which will further developments in electrochemistry,\ngeology, catalysis, biology, and microtechnology.\n", "  We have analysed high-resolution spectra of 28 A and 22 F stars in the Kepler\nfield, observed with the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. We\nprovide spectral types, atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for 50\nstars. Balmer, Fe I, and Fe II lines were used to derive effective\ntemperatures, surface gravities, and microturbulent velocities. We determined\nchemical abundances and projected rotational velocities using a spectrum\nsynthesis technique. Effective temperatures calculated by spectral energy\ndistribution fitting are in good agreement with those determined from the\nspectral line analysis. The stars analysed include chemically peculiar stars of\nthe Am and Lambda Boo types, as well as stars with approximately solar chemical\nabundances. The wide distribution of projected rotational velocity, Vsini, is\ntypical for A and F stars. The microturbulence velocities obtained are typical\nfor stars in the observed temperature and surface gravity ranges. Moreover, we\naffirm the results of Niemczura et al., that Am stars do not have\nsystematically higher microturbulent velocities than normal stars of the same\ntemperature.\n", "  Although pulsations of $\\delta$ Scuti type are not expected among Ap stars\nfrom a theoretical point of view, previous observations of the known $\\delta$\nScuti star HD21190 indicated a spectral classification F2 III SrEuSi:, making\nit the most evolved Ap star known. Our atmospheric chemical analysis based on\nrecent HARPS observations confirms the presence of chemical peculiarities in\nHD21190. This star is also the only target known to host a magnetic field along\nwith its $\\delta$ Scuti pulsation properties. Using an astrometric analysis, we\nshow that HD21190 forms a physical binary system with the companion CPD\n-83$^{\\circ}$ 64B. The presented astrometric and spectroscopic study of the\nbinary components is important to understand the complex interplay between\nstellar pulsations, magnetic fields, and chemical composition.\n", "  We present long-baseline ALMA observations of the strong gravitational lens\nH-ATLAS J090740.0-004200 (SDP.9), which consists of an elliptical galaxy at\n$z_{\\mathrm{L}}=0.6129$ lensing a background submillimeter galaxy into two\nextended arcs. The data include Band 6 continuum observations, as well as CO\n$J$=6$-$5 molecular line observations, from which we measure an updated source\nredshift of $z_{\\mathrm{S}}=1.5747$. The image morphology in the ALMA data is\ndifferent from that of the HST data, indicating a spatial offset between the\nstellar, gas, and dust component of the source galaxy. We model the lens as an\nelliptical power law density profile with external shear using a combination of\narchival HST data and conjugate points identified in the ALMA data. Our best\nmodel has an Einstein radius of $\\theta_{\\mathrm{E}}=0.66\\pm0.01$ and a\nslightly steeper than isothermal mass profile slope. We search for the central\nimage of the lens, which can be used constrain the inner mass distribution of\nthe lens galaxy including the central supermassive black hole, but do not\ndetect it in the integrated CO image at a 3$\\sigma$ rms level of 0.0471 Jy km\ns$^{-1}$.\n", "  The topologically protected transport of colloidal particles on top of\nmagnetic patterns of all possible single lattice constant two dimensional\nmagnetic point group symmetries is studied experimentally, theoretically, and\nwith numerical simulations. We examine the transport of colloidal particles in\nresponse to modulation loops of the external field. We classify the modulation\nloops into topologically distinct classes causing different transport. We show\nthat the lattice symmetry has a profound influence on the transport modes, the\naccessibility of transport networks, and the individual addressability of\nparamagnetic versus diamagnetic colloidal particles. We show how the transport\nof colloidal particles above a two fold symmetric stripe pattern changes from\nuniversal adiabatic transport at large elevations via a topologically protected\nratchet motion at intermediate elevations toward a non-transport regime at low\nelevations. Transport above four fold symmetric patterns is closely related to\nthe transport above two fold symmetric patterns. There exists a family of three\nfold symmetric patterns that vary as a function of the phase of the pattern. We\nshow how this family can be divided into two topologically distinct classes\nsupporting different transport modes and being protected by proper and improper\nsix fold symmetries. Both classes support individual control over the transport\nof paramagnetic and diamagnetic particles. We discuss the topological\ntransition when moving the phase from one class of pattern to the other class.\nThe similarities and the differences in the lattice symmetry protected\ntransport of classical over-damped colloidal particles versus the topologically\nprotected transport in quantum mechanical systems are emphasized\n", "  At a mean diameter of ~650 m, the near-Earth asteroid (455213) 2001 OE84\n(OE84 for short) has a rapid rotation period of 0.486542+-0.000002 hours, which\nis uncommon for asteroids larger than ~200 m. We revisited OE84 14 years after\nit was first, and last, observed by Pravec et al. (2002) in order to measure\nagain its spin rate and to search for changes. We have confirmed the rapid\nrotation and, by fitting the photometric data from 2001 and 2016 using the\nlightcurve inversion technique, we determined a retrograde sense of rotation,\nwith the spin axis close to the ecliptic south pole; an oblate shape model of\na/b=1.32+-0.04 and b/c=1.8+-0.2; and no change in spin rate between 2001 and\n2016. Using these parameters we constrained the body's internal strength, and\nfound that current estimations of asteroid cohesion (up to ~80 Pa) are\ninsufficient to maintain an intact rubble pile at the measured spin rate of\nOE84. Therefore, we argue that a monolithic asteroid, that can rotate at the\nrate of OE84 without shedding mass and without slowing down its spin rate, is\nthe most plausible for OE84, and we give constraints on its age, since the time\nit was liberated from its parent body, between 2-10 million years.\n", "  The mechanisms causing millimeter-wave polarization in protoplanetary disks\nare under debate. To disentangle the polarization mechanisms, we observe the\nprotoplanetary disk around HL Tau at 3.1 mm with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which had polarization detected with\nCARMA at 1.3 mm. We successfully detect the ring-like azimuthal polarized\nemission at 3.1 mm. This indicates that dust grains are aligned with the major\naxis being in the azimuthal direction, which is consistent with the theory of\nradiative alignment of elongated dust grains, where the major axis of dust\ngrains is perpendicular to the radiation flux. Furthermore, the morphology of\nthe polarization vectors at 3.1 mm is completely different from those at 1.3\nmm. We interpret that the polarization at 3.1 mm to be dominated by the grain\nalignment with the radiative flux producing azimuthal polarization vectors,\nwhile the self-scattering dominates at 1.3 mm and produces the polarization\nvectors parallel to the minor axis of the disk. By modeling the total\npolarization fraction with a single grain population model, the maximum grain\nsize is constrained to be $100{\\rm~\\mu m}$, which is smaller than the previous\npredictions based on the spectral index between ALMA at 3 mm and VLA at 7 mm.\n", "  We present results from pulsar observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) as a phased array with infield phasing. The antennas were kept\nin phase throughout the observation by applying antenna based phase corrections\nderived from visibilities that were obtained in parallel with the phased array\nbeam data, and which were flagged and calibrated in real time using a model for\nthe continuum emission in the target field. We find that, as expected, the\nsignal to noise ratio (SNR) does not degrade with time. In contrast\nobservations in which the phasing is done only at the start of the observation\nshow a clear degradation of the SNR with time. We find that this degradation is\nwell fit by a function of the form SNR(t) =a + b*exp(-(t/t0)^5/3), which\ncorresponds to the case where the phase drifts are caused by Kolmogorov type\nturbulence in the ionosphere. We also present general formulae (i.e. including\nthe effects of correlated sky noise, imperfect phasing and self noise) for the\nSNR and synthesized beam size for phased arrays (as well as corresponding\nformulae for incoherent arrays). These would be useful in planning observations\nwith large array telescopes.\n", "  We present HR Diagrams for the massive star populations in M31 and M33\nincluding several different types of emission-line stars: the confirmed\nLuminous Blue Variables (LBVs), candidate LBVs, B[e] supergiants and the warm\nhypergiants. We estimate their apparent temperatures and luminosities for\ncomparison with their respective massive star populations and to evaluate the\npossible relationships of these different classes of evolved, massive stars,\nand their evolutionary state. Several of the LBV candidates lie near the LBV/S\nDor instability strip which supports their classification. Most of the B[e]\nsupergiants, however, are less luminous than the LBVs. Many are very dusty with\nthe infrared flux contributing one-third or more to their total flux. They are\nalso relatively isolated from other luminous OB stars. Overall, their spatial\ndistribution suggests a more evolved state. Some may be post-RSGs like the warm\nhypergiants, and there may be more than one path to becoming a B[e] star. There\nare sufficient differences in the spectra, luminosities, spatial distribution,\nand the presence or lack of dust between the LBVs and B[e] supergiants to\nconclude that one group does not evolve into the other.\n", "  Astronomical objects frequently exhibit structure over a wide range of scales\nwhereas many telescopes, especially interferometer arrays, only sample a\nlimited range of spatial scales. In order to properly image these objects,\nimages from a set of instruments covering the range of scales may be needed.\nThese images then must be combined in a manner to recover all spatial scales.\nThis paper describes the feathering technique for image combination in the\nFourier transform plane. Implementations in several packages are discussed and\nexample combinations of single dish and interferometric observations of both\nsimulated and celestial radio emission are given.\n", "  We determined the orbits and stellar parameters of three eccentric eclipsing\nbinaries by light curve solutions of their Kepler data. KIC 10992733 and KIC\n5632781 undergo total eclipses while KIC 10026136 reveals partial eclipses. The\ncomponents of the targets are G and K stars. KIC 10992733 exhibited variations\nwhich were attributed to variable visibility of spot(s) on asynchronously\nrotating component. KIC 5632781 and KIC 1002613 reveal tidally-induced features\nat periastron, i.e. they might be considered as eclipsing heartbeat stars. The\ncharacteristics of the periastron features (shape, width and amplitude) confirm\nthe theoretical predictions.\n", "  Much theoretical and observational work has been done on stellar winds within\nbinary systems. We present a new solution for a ballistic wind launched from a\nsource in a circular orbit. Our method emphasizes the curved streamlines in the\ncorotating frame, where the flow is steady-state, allowing us to obtain an\nexact solution for the mass density at all pre-shock locations. Assuming an\ninitially isotropic wind, fluid elements launched from the interior hemisphere\nof the wind will be the first to cross other streamlines, resulting in a spiral\nstructure bounded by two shock surfaces. Streamlines from the outer wind\nhemisphere later intersect these shocks as well. An analytic solution is\nobtained for the geometry of the two shock surfaces. Although the inner and\nouter shock surfaces asymptotically trace Archimedean spirals, our tail\nsolution suggests many crossings where the shocks overlap, beyond which the\nanalytic solution cannot be continued. Our solution can be readily extended to\nan initially anisotropic wind.\n", "  The Southern hemisphere of the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet has become\nvisible from Rosetta only since March 2015. It was illuminated during the\nperihelion passage and therefore it contains the regions that experienced the\nstrongest heating and erosion rate, thus exposing the subsurface most pristine\nmaterial. In this work we investigate, thanks to the OSIRIS images, the\ngeomorphology, the spectrophotometry and some transient events of two Southern\nhemisphere regions: Anhur and part of Bes. Bes is dominated by outcropping\nconsolidated terrain covered with fine particle deposits, while Anhur appears\nstrongly eroded with elongated canyon-like structures, scarp retreats,\ndifferent kinds of deposits, and degraded sequences of strata indicating a\npervasive layering. We discovered a new 140 m long and 10 m high scarp formed\nin the Anhur/Bes boundary during/after the perihelion passage, close to the\narea where exposed CO$_2$ and H$_2$O ices were previously detected. Several\njets have been observed originating from these regions, including the strong\nperihelion outburst, an active pit, and a faint optically thick dust plume. We\nidentify several areas with a relatively bluer slope (i.e. a lower spectral\nslope value) than their surroundings, indicating a surface composition enriched\nwith some water ice. These spectrally bluer areas are observed especially in\ntalus and gravitational accumulation deposits where freshly exposed material\nhad fallen from nearby scarps and cliffs. The investigated regions become\nspectrally redder beyond 2 au outbound when the dust mantle became thicker,\nmasking the underlying ice-rich layers.\n", "  Here we report the discovery of an extremely massive and large supercluster\n(called Saraswati) found in the Stripe 82 region of SDSS. This supercluster is\na major concentration of galaxies and galaxy clusters, forming a wall-like\nstructure spanning at least 200 Mpc across at the redshift $z \\approx 0.3$.\nThis enormous structure is surrounded by a network of galaxy filaments,\nclusters, and large, $\\sim40 - 170$ Mpc diameter, voids. The mean density\ncontrast $\\delta$ (relative to the background matter density of the universe)\nof Saraswati is $\\gtrsim 1.62$ and the main body of the supercluster comprises\nat least 43 massive galaxy clusters (mean $z = 0.28$) with a total mass of\n$\\sim 2 \\times 10^{16} M_{\\odot}$. The spherical collapse model suggests that\nthe central region of radius $\\sim20$ Mpc and mass at least $ 4 \\times 10^{15}\nM_{\\odot}$ may be collapsing. This places it among the few largest and most\nmassive superclusters known, comparable to the most massive `Shapley\nConcentration' ($z \\approx 0.046$) in the nearby universe. The Saraswati\nsupercluster and its environs reveal that some extreme large-scale, prominent\nmatter density enhancements had formed $\\sim4$ Gy in the past when dark energy\nhad just started to dominate structure formation. This galactic concentration\nsheds light on the role of dark energy and cosmological initial conditions in\nsupercluster formation, and tests the competing cosmological models.\n", "  We describe measurements of the rotational component of teleseismic surface\nwaves using an inertial high-precision ground-rotation-sensor installed at the\nLIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO). The sensor has a noise floor of 0.4 nrad$/\n\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ at 50 mHz and a translational coupling of less than 1 $\\mu$rad/m\nenabling translation-free measurement of small rotations. We present\nobservations of the rotational motion from Rayleigh waves of six teleseismic\nevents from varied locations and with magnitudes ranging from M6.7 to M7.9.\nThese events were used to estimate phase dispersion curves which shows\nagreement with a similar analysis done with an array of three STS-2\nseismometers also located at LHO.\n", "  Previous radio observations revealed widespread gas-phase methanol (CH$_3$OH)\nin the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) at the Galactic center (GC), but its origin\nremains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of CH$_3$OH ice toward a star in\nthe CMZ, based on a Subaru $3.4$-$4.0\\ \\mu$m spectrum, aided by NASA/IRTF $L'$\nimaging and $2$-$4\\ \\mu$m spectra. The star lies $\\sim8000$ au away in\nprojection from a massive young stellar object (MYSO). Its observed high\nCH$_3$OH ice abundance ($17\\%\\pm3\\%$ relative to H$_2$O ice) suggests that the\n$3.535\\ \\mu$m CH$_3$OH ice absorption likely arises in the MYSO's extended\nenvelope. However, it is also possible that CH$_3$OH ice forms with a higher\nabundance in dense clouds within the CMZ, compared to within the disk. Either\nway, our result implies that gas-phase CH$_3$OH in the CMZ can be largely\nproduced by desorption from icy grains. The high solid CH$_3$OH abundance\nconfirms the prominent $15.4\\ \\mu$m shoulder absorption observed toward GC\nMYSOs arises from CO$_2$ ice mixed with CH$_3$OH.\n", "  In this work, the spectral evolution properties in single-frequency Raman\nfiber amplifier (RFA) with different pump manners are analyzed theoretically\nfor the first time based on the gain dynamics. The analysis of gain dynamics\nreveals that the walk-off effect in counter-pumped manner produces a natural\nlow-pass filter in single-frequency RFA. When applying rare-earth doped fiber\nlasers as the pump source, the strong temporal fluctuations in the pump source\nlead to spectral broadening in co-pumped manner, while the natural low-pass\nfilter in countered-pumped case can still ensure single-frequency operation.\nFurthermore, applying temporal stable laser, such as single-frequency fiber\nlaser or narrow band fiber laser spectral broadened by phase modulation\ntechnique, as the pump source would be superior for high-performance\nsingle-frequency RFA for the both two pump manners.\n", "  In this work we present a grid of LTE and non-LTE synthetic spectra of hot DA\nwhite dwarfs (WDs). In addition to its usefulness for the determination of\nfundamental stellar parameters of isolated WDs and in binaries, this grid will\nbe of interest for the construction of theoretical libraries for stellar\nstudies from integrated light. The spectral grid covers both a wide temperature\nand gravity range, with 17,000 K <= T_eff <= 100,000 K and 7.0 <= log(g) <=\n9.5. The stellar models are built for pure hydrogen and the spectra cover a\nwavelength range from 900 A to 2.5 microns. Additionally, we derive synthetic\nHST/ACS, HST/WFC3, Bessel UBVRI and SDSS magnitudes. The grid was also used to\nmodel integrated spectral energy distributions of simple stellar populations\nand our modeling suggests that DAs might be detectable in ultraviolet bands for\npopulations older than ~8 Gyr.\n", "  We built a multiplex media attention and disregard network (MADN) among 129\ncountries over 212 days. By characterizing the MADN from multiple levels, we\nfound that it is formed primarily by skewed, hierarchical, and asymmetric\nrelationships. Also, we found strong evidence that our news world is becoming a\n\"global village.\" However, at the same time, unique attention blocks of the\nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) region, as well as Russia and its\nneighbors, still exist.\n", "  This paper considers Einstein-Brans-Dicke action being coupled with a Higgs\nsector. It is shown that classically graceful exit from inflation is not\npossible in principle, rejecting the claim of La and Steinhardt. Further,\nwormhole solutions with and without conserved charges are explored. Finally,\nthe wavefunction of the universe in this model is constructed with the boundary\ncondition, as proposed by Vilenkin. The interesting feature of the wavefunction\nis that it has been constructed for an arbitrary factor-ordering index.\n", "  We present analysis of near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopy towards\nthe Flat-spectrum YSO (Young Stellar Object) ESO H$\\alpha$ 279a (1.5 solar\nmass) in the Serpens star forming region, at the distance of 429 pc. Using the\nImmersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS, R=45,000), we detect emission\nlines originating from the accretion channel flow, jet, and inner disk.\nSpecifically, we identify hydrogen Brackett series recombination, [Fe II], [Fe\nIII], [Fe IV], Ca I, Na I, H2, H2O and CO overtone emission lines. By modeling\nfive bands of CO overtone emission lines, and the symmetric double-peaked line\nprofile for Na I emission lines, we find that ESO H$\\alpha$ 279a has an\nactively accreting Keplerian disk. From our Keplerian disk model, we find that\nNa I emission lines originate between 0.04 AU and 1.00 AU, while CO overtone\nemission lines are from the outer part of disk, in the range between 0.22 AU\nand 3.00 AU. It reveals that the neutral atomic Na gas is a good tracer of the\ninnermost region of the actively accreting disk. We derive a mass accretion\nrate of 2-10x10^{-7} M_solar/yr from the measured Br_gamma emission luminosity\nof 1.78(+-0.31)x10^{31} erg/s.\n", "  The mixed Hydrogen and Helium (H + He) spectrum with a clear steepening at\n$\\sim 700$ TeV has been detected by ARGO-YBJ experiments. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the observed H + He spectrum can be well reproduced with the\nmodel of cosmic rays escaping from the supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy.\nIn this model, particles are accelerated in a SNR through a non-linear\ndiffusive shock acceleration mechanism and three components of high energy\nlight nuclei escaped from the SNR are considered. It should be noted that the\nproton spectrum observed by KASCADE can be also explained by this model given a\nhigher acceleration efficiency.\n", "  How much knowledge is there in an economy? In recent years, data on the mix\nof products that countries export has been used to construct measures of\neconomic complexity that estimate the knowledge available in an economy and\npredict future economic growth. Here we introduce a new and simpler metric of\neconomic complexity (ECI+) that measures the total exports of an economy\ncorrected by how difficult it is to export each product. We use data from 1973\nto 2013 to compare the ability of ECI+, the Economic Complexity Index (ECI),\nand Fitness complexity, to predict future economic growth using 5, 10, and\n20-year panels in a pooled OLS, a random effects model, and a fixed effects\nmodel. We find that ECI+ outperforms ECI and Fitness in its ability to predict\neconomic growth and in the consistency of its estimators across most\neconometric specifications. On average, one standard deviation increase in ECI+\nis associated with an increase in annualized growth of about 4% to 5%. We then\ncombine ECI+ with measures of physical capital, human capital, and\ninstitutions, to find a robust model of economic growth. The ability of ECI+ to\npredict growth, and the value of its coefficient, is robust to these controls.\nAlso, we find that human capital, political stability, and control of\ncorruption; are positively associated with future economic growth, and that\nincome is negatively associated with growth, in agreement with the traditional\ngrowth literature. Finally, we use ECI+ to generate economic growth predictions\nfor the next 20 years and compare these predictions with the ones obtained\nusing ECI and Fitness. These findings improve the methods available to estimate\nthe knowledge intensity of economies and predict future economic growth.\n", "  The recently proved `no short hair' theorem asserts that, if a\nspherically-symmetric static black hole has hair, then this hair (the external\nfields) must extend beyond the null circular geodesic (the \"photonsphere\") of\nthe corresponding black-hole spacetime: $r_{\\text{field}}>r_{\\text{null}}$. In\nthis paper we provide compelling evidence that the bound can be {\\it violated}\nby {\\it non}-spherically symmetric hairy black-hole configurations. To that\nend, we analytically explore the physical properties of cloudy Kerr-Newman\nblack-hole spacetimes -- charged rotating black holes which support linearized\nstationary charged scalar configurations in their exterior regions.\n", "  We investigate the impact of resonant gravitational waves on quadrupole\nacoustic modes of Sun-like stars located nearby stellar black hole binary\nsystems (such as GW150914 and GW151226). We find that the stimulation of the\nlow-overtone modes by gravitational radiation can lead to sizeable photometric\namplitude variations, much larger than the predictions for amplitudes driven by\nturbulent convection, which in turn are consistent with the photometric\namplitudes observed in most Sun-like stars. For accurate stellar evolution\nmodels, using up-to-date stellar physics, we predict photometric amplitude\nvariations of $1$ -- $10^3$ ppm for a solar mass star located at a distance\nbetween 1 au and 10 au from the black hole binary, and belonging to the same\nmulti-star system. The observation of such a phenomenon will be within the\nreach of the Plato mission because telescope will observe several portions of\nthe Milky Way, many of which are regions of high stellar density with a\nsubstantial mixed population of Sun-like stars and black hole binaries.\n", "  The interaction between a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and its host supernova\nremnant (SNR) can produce a vast array of observable structures. Asymmetry\npresent within these structures derives from the complexity of the composite\nsystem, where many factors take turns playing a dominating hand throughout the\nstages of composite SNR evolution. Of particular interest are systems\ncharacterized by blastwave expansion within a nonuniform interstellar medium\n(ISM), which contain an active pulsar having a substantial \"kick\" velocity\n(upward of 300 km s$^{-1}$ ), because these systems tend to produce complex\nmorphologies. We present a numerical model that employs these and several other\nfactors in an effort to generate asymmetry similar to that seen in various\nX-ray and radio observations. We find that the main parameters driving\nstructure are ISM uniformity and total pulsar spin- down energy, with secondary\ncontributions from factors such as pulsar trajectory and initial spin-down\nluminosity. We also investigate the dynamics behind PWN \"tails,\" which may form\nto link active pulsars to a crushed, relic nebula as the reverse shock passes.\nWe find that the directions of such tails are not good indicators of pulsar\nmotion, but direction does reveal the flow of ejecta created by the passage of\na reverse shock.\n", "  Semiclassical approximation to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation which corresponds\nto gravity with a minimally coupled scalar field has been performed. To the\nleading order, vacuum Einstein's equation along with the functional Schrodinger\nequation for the matter field, propagating in the background of classical\ncurved space are obtained. The Schrodinger equation is solved for a quartic\npotential. It is observed that the wave-functional admits the wormhole boundary\ncondition even for large negative values of the coupling constant epsilon. For\nconformal coupling epsilon = 1/6, the Hawking-Page wormhole solution is\nrecovered.\n", "  According to structure formation simulations, weak shocks with typical Mach\nnumber, $M_{\\rm s}\\lesssim 3$, are expected to form in merging galaxy clusters.\nThe presence of such shocks has been indicated by X-ray and radio observations\nof many merging clusters. In particular, diffuse radio sources known as radio\nrelics could be explained by synchrotron-emitting electrons accelerated via\ndiffusive shock acceleration (Fermi I) at quasi-perpendicular shocks. Here we\nalso consider possible roles of stochastic acceleration (Fermi II) by\ncompressive MHD turbulence downstream of the shock. Then we explore a puzzling\ndiscrepancy that for some radio relics, the shock Mach number inferred from the\nradio spectral index is substantially larger than that estimated from X-ray\nobservations. This problem could be understood, if shock surfaces associated\nwith radio relics consist of multiple shocks with different strengths.In that\ncase, X-ray observations tend to pick up the part of shocks with lower Mach\nnumbers and higher kinetic energy flux, while radio emissions come\npreferentially from the part of shocks with higher Mach numbers and higher\ncosmic ray (CR) production. We also show that the Fermi I reacceleration model\nwith preexisting fossil electrons supplemented by Fermi II acceleration due to\npostshock turbulence could reproduce observed profiles of radio flux densities\nand integrated radio spectra of two giant radio relics. This study demonstrates\nthe CR electrons can be accelerated at collisionless shocks in galaxy clusters\njust like supernova remnant shock in the interstellar medium and interplanetary\nshocks in the solar wind.\n", "  This study aims timing the eclipses of the short period low mass binary star\nAB And. The times of minima are taken from the literature and from our\nobservations in October 2013 (22 times of minima) and in August 2014 (23 times\nof minima). We find and discuss an inaccuracy in the determination of the types\nof minima in the previous investigation by \\citet{li2014}. We study the secular\nevolution of the central binary's orbital period and the possibility of the\nexistence of third and fourth companions in the system.\n", "  Temporal imaging systems are outstanding tools for single-shot observation of\noptical signals that have irregular and ultrafast dynamics. They allow long\ntime windows to be recorded with femtosecond resolution, and do not rely on\ncomplex algorithms. However, simultaneous recording of amplitude and phase\nremains an open challenge for these systems. Here we present a new heterodyne\ntime-lens arrangement that efficiently records both the amplitude and phase of\ncomplex signals, while keeping the performances of classical time-lens systems\n($\\sim 200$~fs) and field of view (tens of ps). Phase and time are encoded onto\nthe two spatial dimensions of a camera. We demonstrate direct application of\nour heterodyne time lens to turbulent-like optical fields and optical rogue\nwaves generated from nonlinear propagation of partially coherent waves inside\noptical fibres. We also show how this phase-sensitive time-lens system enables\ndigital temporal holography to be performed with even higher temporal\nresolution (80 fs).\n", "  We discuss a new technique to constrain models for the origin of radio relics\nin galaxy clusters using the correlation between the shock Mach number and the\nradio power of relics. This analysis is carried out using a sample of relics\nwith information on both the Mach numbers derived from X-ray observation,\n$\\mathcal{M}_X$, and using spectral information from radio observations of the\npeak and the average values of the spectral index along the relic,\n$\\mathcal{M}_R$. We find that there is a lack of correlation between\n$\\mathcal{M}_X$ and $\\mathcal{M}_R$; this result is an indication that the\nspectral index of the relic is likely not due to the acceleration of particles\noperated by the shock but it is related to the properties of a fossil electrons\npopulation. We also find that the available data on the correlation between the\nradio power $P_{1.4}$ and Mach numbers ($\\mathcal{M}_R$ and $\\mathcal{M}_X$) in\nrelics indicate that neither the DSA nor the adiabatic compression can simply\nreproduce the observed $P_{1.4}-\\mathcal{M}$ correlations. Furthermore, we find\nthat the radio power is not correlated with $\\mathcal{M}_X$, whereas it is not\npossible to exclude a correlation with $\\mathcal{M}_R$. This also indicates\nthat the relic power is mainly determined by the properties of a fossil\nelectron population rather than by the properties of the shock. Our results\nrequire either to consider models of shock (re)acceleration that go beyond the\nproposed scenarios of DSA and adiabatic compression at shocks, or to reconsider\nthe origin of radio relics in terms of other physical scenarios.\n", "  The broad emission lines (BELs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) respond to\nionizing continuum variations. The time and velocity dependence of their\nresponse depends on the structure of the broad-line region: its geometry,\nkinematics and ionization state. Here, we predict the reverberation signatures\nof BELs formed in rotating accretion disc winds. We use a Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer and ionization code to predict velocity-delay maps for representative\nhigh- (C$~IV$) and low-ionization (H$\\alpha$) emission lines in both high- and\nmoderate-luminosity AGN. Self-shielding, multiple scattering and the ionization\nstructure of the outflows are all self-consistently taken into account, while\nsmall-scale structure in the outflow is modelled in the micro-clumping\napproximation. Our main findings are: (1) The velocity-delay maps of\nsmooth/micro-clumped outflows often contain significant negative responses.\n(2)~The reverberation signatures of disc wind models tend to be rotation\ndominated and can even resemble the classic \"red-leads-blue\" inflow signature.\n(3) Traditional \"blue-leads-red\" outflow signatures can usually only be\nobserved in the long-delay limit. (4) Our models predict lag-luminosity\nrelationships similar to those inferred from observations, but systematically\nunderpredict the observed centroid delays. (5) The ratio between \"virial\nproduct\" and black hole mass predicted by our models depends on viewing angle.\nOur results imply that considerable care needs to be taken in interpreting data\nobtained by observational reverberation mapping campaigns. In particular, basic\nsignatures such as \"red-leads-blue\", \"blue-leads-red\" and \"blue and red vary\njointly\" are not always reliable indicators of inflow, outflow or rotation.\nThis may help to explain the perplexing diversity of such signatures seen in\nobservational campaigns to date.\n", "  Tail bending associated with maneuvering flight of insects is a known\nphenomenon although there are only a few studies which analyze and quantify the\neffects and benefits of body configuration changes. We hypothesized that these\nconfiguration changes help reduce the energy expenditure in flight. This is\nquantified by the magnitude of the aerodynamic torque generated by the insect\nduring the maneuver. To test our hypothesis, a dragonfly body model was\nconstructed with the ability to bend at the joint between the thorax and the\ntail. An optimization problem was defined to find the dynamic body\nconfiguration which minimizes the total pitch and yaw torque. The magnitude of\nthe tail deflection was found to be directly correlated with the yaw velocity\nof the body. Most importantly, our results indicate that for executing the same\naerial maneuver, an insect with a flexible body was found to require\nsubstantially smaller flight torque when compared to an insect with identical\nmorphology but possessing a rigid body. In addition, changes in the\ninstantaneous mass distribution of the body had the most substantial effect on\nreducing the flight torque, while the inertial term due to the tail movement\nhad a smaller effect.\n", "  The conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals is studied in a new\ngeometry of a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) with multi-electrodes,\ndedicated to the treatment of high gas flow rates. Gas chromatography is used\nto define the CO2 and CH4 conversion as well as the yields of the products of\ndecomposition (CO, O2 and H2) and of recombination (C2H4, C2H6 and CH2O). The\ninfluence of three parameters is investigated on the conversion: the CO2 and\nCH4 flow rates, the plasma power and the nature of the carrier gas (argon or\nhelium). The energy efficiency of the CO2 conversion is estimated and compared\nwith those of similar atmospheric plasma sources. Our DBD reactor shows a good\ncompromise between a good energy efficiency and the treatment of a large CO2\nflow rate.\n", "  The color-magnitude diagrams of many Magellanic Cloud clusters (with ages up\nto 2 billion years) display extended turnoff regions where the stars leave the\nmain sequence, suggesting the presence of multiple stellar populations with\nages which may differ even by hundreds million years (Mackey et al. 2008,\nMilone et al. 2009, Girardi et al. 2011). A strongly debated question is\nwhether such an extended turnoff is instead due to populations with different\nstellar rotations (Girardi et al. 2011, Goudfrooij et al. 2011, Rubele et al.\n2013, Li et al. 2014). The recent discovery of a `split' main sequence in some\nyounger clusters (about 80--400Myr) added another piece to this puzzle. The\nblue (red) side of the main sequence is consistent with slowly (rapidly)\nrotating stellar models (D'Antona et al. 2015, Milone et al. 2016, Correnti et\nal. 2017, Milone et al 2016), but a complete theoretical characterization of\nthe observed color-magnitude diagram appeared to require also an age spread\n(Correnti et al. 2017). We show here that, in three clusters so far analyzed,\nif the blue main sequence stars are interpreted with models that have been\nalways slowly rotating, they must be about 30% younger than the rest of the\ncluster. If they are instead interpreted as stars initially rapidly rotating,\nbut that have later slowed down, the age difference disappears, and \"braking\"\nalso helps to explain the apparent age differences of the extended turnoff. The\nage spreads in Magellanic Cloud clusters are a manifestation of rotational\nstellar evolution. Observational tests are suggested.\n", "  For more than 5000 stars with accurate parallaxes from the Hipparcos and Gaia\nDR1 Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS), Tycho-2 photometry, interstellar\npolarization from eight catalogues and interstellar extinction from eight 3D\nmaps the largest up to date comparison of the polarization and extinction is\nprovided. The extinction maps give different estimations of the extinction and\nof the polarization efficiency as the polarization divided into extinction\n$P/A_V$ as well as of the percentage of the stars with the polarization\nefficiency higher than the limit of Serkowski $P/A_V>0.03$. Using the Hipparcos\nparallaxes we found about 200 stars (4\\%, mainly OB stars) drop higher than the\nlimit when we use any extinction map. However, the usage of more accurate TGAS\nparallaxes decreases them to only 17 stars (0.3\\%). The polarization and\nextinction are negligible inside the Local Bubble within 80 pc from the Sun. In\nthe vast Bubble's shell at the distances 80--118 pc from the Sun the\npolarization and extinction rapidly grow with the distance whereas the position\nangle of the polarization is oriented predominantly along the shell of the\nBubble. Outside the Bubble the polarization and extinction grow with the\ndistance slowly. In addition, within a radius of 80--300 pc of the Sun a disc\nof some filamentary dust clouds (including well-known Markkanen cloud) is\nobserved as in the polarization map as in the reddening one by Schlegel et al.\nIn this disc the position angle of polarization is preferably oriented along\nthe plane of the disk. For the regions further than 300 pc the position angle\nof polarization is preferably oriented along the Local spiral arm, i.e. Y\ncoordinate axis. The polarization and its efficiency is lower in the dust layer\nin the Gould belt than in the equatorial dust layer. It may means different\nproperties of dust in these two layers.\n", "  The atomic-level tunability that results from alloying multiple transition\nmetals with d electrons in concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs), including\nhigh-entropy alloys (HEAs), has produced remarkable properties for advanced\nenergy applications, in particular, damage resistance in high-radiation\nenvironments. The key to understanding CSAs radiation performance is\nquantitatively characterizing their complex local physical and chemical\nenvironments. In this study, the local structure of a FeCoNiCrPd HEA is\nquantitatively analyzed with X-ray total scattering and extended X-ray\nabsorption fine structure methods. Compared to FeCoNiCr and FeCoNiCrMn,\nFeCoNiCrPd with a quasi-random alloy structure has a strong local lattice\ndistortion, which effectively pins radiation-induced defects. Distinct from a\nrelaxation behavior in FeCoNiCr and FeCoNiCrMn, ion irradiation further\nenhanced the local lattice distortion in FeCoNiCrPd due to a preference for\nforming Pd-Pd atomic pairs.\n", "  This paper introduces a two-and multi-level phase mask design for improved\ndepth of focus. A novel technique is proposed incorporating cubic and\ngeneralized cubic wavefront coding (WFC). The obtained system is\noptical-electronic requiring computational deblurring post-processing, in order\nto obtain a sharp image from the observed blurred data. A midwave infrared\n(MWIR) system is simulated showing that this design will produce high quality\nimages even for large amounts of defocus. It is furthermore shown that this\ntechnique can be used to design a flat, single optical element, systems where\nthe phase mask performs both the function of focusing and phase modulation. It\nis demonstrated that in this lensless design the WFC coding components can be\nomitted and WFC effects are achieved as a result of the proposed algorithm for\nphase mask design which uses the quadratic phase of the thin refractive lens as\nthe input signal.\n", "  The main idea in the present work is the definition of an experimental\nproposal for the detection of the number of extra{compact dimensions contained\nas a core feature in String Theory. This goal will be achieved as a consequence\nof the fact that the density of states of a bosonic gas does depend upon the\nnumber and geometry of the involved space{like dimensions. In particular our\nidea concerns the detection of the discontinuity of the specific heat at the\ncondensation temperature as a function of the number of particles present in\nthe gas. It will be shown that the corresponding function between these two\nvariables defines a segment of a straight line whose slope depends upon the\nnumber of extra{compact dimensions. Resorting to some experiments in the\ndetection of the specific heat of a rubidium condensate the feasibility of this\nproposal using this kind of atom is also analyzed.\n", "  The Prototype Imaging Spectrograph for Coronagraphic Exoplanet Studies\n(PISCES) is a high contrast integral field spectrograph (IFS) whose design was\ndriven by WFIRST coronagraph instrument requirements. We present commissioning\nand operational results using PISCES as a camera on the High Contrast Imaging\nTestbed at JPL. PISCES has demonstrated ability to achieve high contrast\nspectral retrieval with flight-like data reduction and analysis techniques.\n", "  The saw-tooth scaling investigations of work functions (WF) in hydrogenated\ngraphene are theoretically performed by density functional theory. The\npositions of hydrogen atoms and the H/C ratios affect WF. With the comparison\nof different graphene structures by adsorbed two hydrogen atoms, WF is larger\nwith less negative charges of the graphene. With different H/C ratios, WF is\ncontrolled by two parts: the graphene surface and hydrogen groups. When the\nratio is smaller than 0.5, the work func-tion is more dependent on the Mulliken\ncharge of graphene. With more hydrogen atoms, the surface of graphene is more\nnegative, resulting in a smaller work function. When the ratio is larger than\n0.5, the effect of hydrogen groups cannot be ignored. When two sides of\ngraphene have different numbers of hy-drogen atoms, a dipole exists, making the\nmovement of electron from Fermi level to vacuum level more difficult, thus WF\nis larger than that with the same hydrogen atoms of each side. Therefore the\nscaling of work function acts like a saw-tooth dependent on H/C ratio.\n", "  Memory-assisted quantum key distribution (MA-QKD) has recently been proposed\nas a technique to improve the rate-versus-distance behavior of QKD systems by\nusing existing, or nearly-achievable, quantum technologies. The promise is that\nMA-QKD would require less demanding quantum memories than the ones needed for\nprobabilistic quantum repeaters. Nevertheless, early investigations suggest\nthat, in order to beat the conventional no-memory QKD schemes, the quantum\nmemories used in the MA-QKD protocols must have high bandwidth-storage products\nand short interaction times. Among different types of quantum memories,\nensemble-based memories offer some of the required specifications, but they\ntypically suffer from multiple excitation effects. To avoid the latter issue,\nin this paper, we propose two new variants of MA-QKD both relying on\nsingle-photon sources (SPSs) for entangling purposes. One is based on known\ntechniques for entanglement distribution in quantum repeaters. This scheme\nturns out to offer no advantage even if one uses ideal SPSs. By finding the\nroot cause of the problem, we then propose another setup, which can outperform\nsingle no-QM setups even if we allow for some imperfections in our SPSs. For\nsuch a scheme, we compare the key rate for different types of ensemble-based\nmemories and show that certain classes of atomic ensembles can improve the\nrate-versus-distance behavior.\n", "  We introduce a lattice model for active nematic composed of self-propelled\napolar particles,study its different ordering states in the density-temperature\nparameter space, and compare with the corresponding equilibrium model. The\nactive particles interact with their neighbours within the framework of the\nLebwohl-Lasher model, and move anisotropically along their orientation to an\nunoccupied nearest neighbour lattice site. An interplay of the activity,\nthermal fluctuations and density gives rise distinct states in the system. For\na fixed temperature, the active nematic shows a disordered isotropic state, a\nlocally ordered inhomogeneous mixed state, and bistability between the\ninhomogeneous mixed and a homogeneous globally ordered state in different\ndensity regime. In the low temperature regime, the isotropic to the\ninhomogeneous mixed state transition occurs with a jump in the order parameter\nat a density less than the corresponding equilibrium disorder-order transition\ndensity. Our analytical calculations justify the shift in the transition\ndensity and the jump in the order parameter. We construct the phase diagram of\nthe active nematic in the density-temperature plane.\n", "  We consider the question of reducibility of the differential system to\nnormalized Fuchsian form on the Riemann sphere. The differential equations for\nthe multiloop integrals in $\\epsilon$-form constitute a particular example of\nthe normalized Fuchsian form. We formulate the algorithmic criterion of\nreducibility. We also consider the question of the proper choice of variable in\nthe differential system suitable for its reduction to $\\epsilon$-form.\n", "  The vortex method is a common numerical and theoretical approach used to\nimplement the motion of an ideal flow, in which the vorticity is approximated\nby a sum of point vortices, so that the Euler equations read as a system of\nordinary differential equations. Such a method is well justified in the full\nplane, thanks to the explicit representation formulas of Biot and Savart. In an\nexterior domain, we also replace the impermeable boundary by a collection of\npoint vortices generating the circulation around the obstacle. The density of\nthese point vortices is chosen in order that the flow remains tangent at\nmidpoints between adjacent vortices. In this work, we provide a rigorous\njustification for this method in exterior domains. One of the main mathematical\ndifficulties being that the Biot-Savart kernel defines a singular integral\noperator when restricted to a curve. For simplicity and clarity, we only treat\nthe case of the unit disk in the plane approximated by a uniformly distributed\nmesh of point vortices. The complete and general version of our work is\navailable in [arXiv:1707.01458].\n", "  A simple but general analysis of stability of axis-symmetric adhesive\ncontacts is provided. Adhesion is considered in the JKR-approximation.\nDepending on the shape of the contacting bodies, various scenarios are\npossible, including vanishing adhesive force, complete contact as well as\ntransitions between these states.\n", "  Enhanced photocurrent is demonstrated in a junction-less photodetector with\nnanowires embedded in its channel. The fabricated photodetector consists of a\nlarge area for efficient absorption of incident light with energy band\nengineering achieved in nanowires. The structure design consists of a set of\ntwo symmetrically positioned gates, primary and secondary, that are located\nover the nanowires. Each gate is used for biasing and control of the charge\nflow. We find that detectors with narrower nanowires controlled by their\nsecondary gate generate larger photocurrents under similar illumination\nconditions. Our results show that while the dark current remains the same, the\nphotocurrent increases as the nanowire width decreases.\n", "  In recent years many studies of urban mobility based on large data sets have\nbeen published: most of them based on crowdsourced GPS data or smart-card data.\nWe present, what is to our knowledge the first, exploration of public transport\ndelay data harvested from a large-scale, official public transport positioning\nsystem, provided by the Wroc{\\l}aw Municipality. We evaluate the\ncharacteristics of delays between stops in relation to direction, time and\ndelay variance of 1648 stop pairs from 15 mln delay reports. We construct a\nnormalized feature matrix of likelihood of a given delay change happening at a\ngiven hour on the edge between two stops. We then calculate distances between\nsuch matrices using earth mover's distance and cluster them using hierarchical\nagglomerative clustering with Ward's linkage method. We obtain four profiles of\ndelay changes in Wroc{\\l}aw: edges without impact on delay, edges likely to\ncause delay, edges likely to decrease delay and edges likely to strongly\ndecrease delay (ex. when a public transport vehicle is speeding). We analyze\nthe spatial and mode of transport properties of each cluster and provide\ninsights into reasons of delay change patterns in each of the detected\nprofiles.\n", "  Direct imaging suggests that there is a Jovian exoplanet around the primary\nA-star in the triple-star system HD131399. We investigate a high-quality\nspectrum of the primary component HD131399A obtained with FEROS on the ESO/MPG\n2.2m telescope, aiming to characterise the star's atmospheric and fundamental\nparameters, and to determine elemental abundances at high precision and\naccuracy. The aim is to constrain the chemical composition of the birth cloud\nof the system and therefore the bulk composition of the putative planet. A\nhybrid non-local thermal equilibrium (non-LTE) model atmosphere technique is\nadopted for the quantitative spectral analysis. Comparison with the most recent\nstellar evolution models yields the fundamental parameters. The atmospheric and\nfundamental stellar parameters of HD131399A are constrained to Teff=9200+-100\nK, log g=4.37+-0.10, M=1.95+0.08-0.06 Msun, R=1.51+0.13-0.10 Rsun, and log\nL/Lsun=1.17+-0.07, locating the star on the zero-age main sequence. Non-LTE\neffects on the derived metal abundances are often smaller than 0.1dex, but can\nreach up to ~0.8dex for individual lines. The observed lighter elements up to\ncalcium are overall consistent with present-day cosmic abundances, with a C/O\nratio of 0.45$\\pm$0.07 by number, while the heavier elements show mild\noverabundances. We conclude that the birth cloud of the system had a standard\nchemical composition, but we witness the onset of the Am phenomenon in the\nslowly rotating star. We furthermore show that non-LTE analyses have the\npotential to solve the remaining discrepancies between observed abundances and\npredictions by diffusion models for Am stars. Moreover, the present case allows\nmass loss, not turbulent mixing, to be identified as the main transport process\ncompeting with diffusion in very young Am stars.\n", "  The Madala hypothesis was proposed by members of the Wits-ATLAS group to\naccount for several anomalies in both ATLAS and CMS data at the LHC. This\nhypothesis extends the standard model through the addition of two scalar bosons\nand a hidden sector that can provide a dark matter candidate. This hidden\nsector interacts with the standard model only through the mediation of one of\nthese scalars S. The couplings of S are not amenable to investigation in\ncurrent collider data and so are assumed to be Higgs-like to reduce the\nparameter space of the model. Our previous work (Beck & Colafrancesco 2016) has\nshown that these couplings can be limited via indirect dark matter detection\nexperiments in gamma-rays (for resonant annihilations into S). Here we will\ntreat the dark matter and S masses independently, and we generalise our\nprevious work and examine what fraction of the cosmological dark matter\nabundance can be accounted for by particles in the hidden sector of the Madala\nhypothesis dark matter when these annihilate to standard model products via a\nHiggs-like S. We will also extend our gamma-ray analysis of Madala hypothesis\ndark matter to include the constraints of diffuse radio data from the Coma\ngalaxy cluster in addition to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data from both this\ntarget and the Reticulum II dwarf galaxy.\n  Our analysis indicates that either the Madala hypothesis cannot provide the\nbulk of cosmological dark matter, or the S boson cannot be simply Higgs-like.\nThese apply unless the candidate particle exceeds a mass of 200 GeV. Both these\nscenarios may reduce the attractiveness of the hypothesis as the second case\nwill imply that many free parameters must be added to describe S, greatly\nweakening fits for the model. To investigate the full consequences of this\nfurther work will necessitate using larger astrophysical data sets to strongly\nconstrain details about S.\n", "  Considering an extension of the principle of covarience to the action along a\npath in relativistic Lagrangian mechanics, we motivate the use of geometric --\ni.e. covariant and parameter invariant -- Lagrangian functions. We then study\nsome properties of geometric Lagrangians, and introduce the notion of deviation\nof a path, which is a covariant measure of how much a path departs from a\ngeodesic. Finally, we apply this notion of the twin paradox, and provide a\nrigorous resolution of it.\n", "  We combine experiments and theory to investigate the dynamics and\norientational fluctuations of ferromagnetic microellipsoids that form a\nribbon-like structure due to attractive dipolar forces. When assembled in the\nribbon, the ellipsoids displays orientational thermal uctuations with an\namplitude that can be controlled via application of an in-plane magnetic field.\nWe use video microscopy to investigate the orientational dynamics in real\ntime/space. Theoretical arguments are used to derive an analytical expression\nthat describes how the distribution of the different angular configurations\ndepends on the strength of the applied field. The experimental data are in good\nagreement with the developed model for all the range of field parameters\nexplored. Understanding the role of uctuations in chains composed of dipolar\nparticles is important not only from a fundamental point of view, but it may\nalso help understanding the stability of such structures against thermal noise,\nwhich is relevant in micro uidics and lab-on-a-chip applications.\n", "  We present the results of nine years of the blazar observing programme at the\nRATAN-600 radio telescope (2005-2014). The data were obtained at six frequency\nbands (1.1, 2.3, 4.8, 7.7, 11.2, 21.7 GHz) for 290 blazars, mostly BL Lacs. In\naddition, we used data at 37 GHz obtained quasi-simultaneously with the\nMetsahovi radio observatory for some sources. The sample includes blazars of\nthree types: high-synchrotron peaked (HSP), low-synchrotron peaked (LSP), and\nintermediate-synchrotron peaked (ISP). We present several epochs of flux\ndensity measurements, simultaneous radio spectra, spectral indices and\nproperties of their variability. The analysis of the radio properties of\ndifferent classes of blazars showed that LSP and HSP BL Lac blazars are quite\ndifferent objects on average. LSPs have higher flux densities, flatter spectra\nand their variability increases as higher frequencies are considered. On the\nother hand, HSPs are very faint in radio domain, tend to have steep low\nfrequency spectra, and they are less variable than LSPs at all frequencies.\nAnother result is spectral flattening above 7.7 GHz detected in HSPs, while an\naverage LSP spectrum typically remains flat at both the low and high frequency\nranges we considered.\n", "  Autoinducers are small signaling molecules that mediate intercellular\ncommunication in microbial populations and trigger coordinated gene expression\nvia \"quorum sensing\". Elucidating the mechanisms that control autoinducer\nproduction is, thus, pertinent to understanding collective microbial behavior,\nsuch as virulence and bioluminescence. Recent experiments have shown a\nheterogeneous promoter activity of autoinducer synthase genes, suggesting that\nsome of the isogenic cells in a population might produce autoinducers, whereas\nothers might not. However, the mechanism underlying this phenotypic\nheterogeneity in quorum-sensing microbial populations has remained elusive. In\nour theoretical model, cells synthesize and secrete autoinducers into the\nenvironment, up-regulate their production in this self-shaped environment, and\nnon-producers replicate faster than producers. We show that the coupling\nbetween ecological and population dynamics through quorum sensing can induce\nphenotypic heterogeneity in microbial populations, suggesting an alternative\nmechanism to stochastic gene expression in bistable gene regulatory circuits.\n", "  We study the resonances of $2\\times 2$ systems of one dimensional\nSchr\\\"odinger operators which are related to the mathematical theory of\nmolecular predissociation. We determine the precise positions of the resonances\nwith real parts below the energy where bonding and anti-bonding potentials\nintersect transversally. In particular, we find that imaginary parts (widths)\nof the resonances are exponentially small and that the indices are determined\nby Agmon distances for the minimum of two potentials.\n", "  The leading classical asymptotics of Virasoro conformal blocks on the Riemann\nsphere with n generic and n-3 \"heavy\" degenerate field insertions can be\ndescribed in terms of the geometry of Garnier system describing the monodromy\npreserving deformations of second order Fuchsian differential equations on an\nn-punctured sphere. This allows us to characterise the leading classical\nasymptotics of Virasoro conformal blocks completely, and to clarify in which\nsense conformal field theory represents a quantisation of the isomonodromic\ndeformation problem.\n", "  The recent results obtained by the modern telescopes and spacecrafts allow us\nfor the first time to compare directly the mass, spatial density and size\ndistribution of the dust grains in the regions of their production, processing\nand consumption in our Galaxy. The ALMA and VLT/SPHERE telescopes allow us to\nestimate the production of the dust by supergiants and collapsing core\nsupernovae. The 2MASS, WISE, SDSS, Planck and other telescopes allow us to\nestimate the processing of the dust in the interstellar medium. After renewed\nBesan\\c{c}on Galaxy model the medium appears to contain about half the local\nmass of matter (both baryonic and dark) in the Galactic neighborhood of the\nSun. The Helios, Ulysses, Galileo, Cassini and New Horizons spacecrafts allow\nus to estimate the consumption of the dust into large solid bodies. The results\nare consistent each other assuming the local mean spatial density of the dust\nis about of $3.5\\times10^{-26}$ g/cm$^3$, mean density of the grain is about 1\ng/cm$^3$, and the dust production rate is about of 0.015 Solar mass per year\nfor whole the Galaxy.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarfs (WDs) that accrete mass from a binary companion, which can be\neither a non-degenerate star (a main-sequence star or a giant) or an other WD\nin a binary merger (single- and double-degenerate scenario, respectively). In\npopulation-synthesis studies of SNe Ia the contribution of asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars to either scenario is marginal. However, most of these\nstudies adopt simplified assumptions to compute the effects of wind mass loss\nand accretion in binary systems. This work investigates the impact of wind mass\ntransfer on a population of binary stars and discusses the role of AGB stars as\nprogenitors of SNe Ia.\n", "  A new experiment based on tin-loaded scintillator is proposed to measure the\n2nu double beta decay half-life of Sn-124 for the first time. Measurements of\nlong term stabilitiy and optical properties of the produced scintillator are\npresented. In addition a sophisticated estimation of the background due to\ncosmic ray spallation on tin has been performed. It is shown that such a\nmeasurement is feasible and can reach half-lives of 10^22 years, thus covering\nall current theoretical predictions for this decay mode.\n", "  The hole diffusion length in n-InGaAs is extracted for two samples of\ndifferent doping concentrations using a set of long and thin diffused junction\ndiodes separated by various distances on the order of the diffusion length. The\nmethodology is described, including the ensuing analysis which yields diffusion\nlengths between 70 - 85 um at room temperature for doping concentrations in the\nrange of 5 - 9 x 10^15 cm-3. The analysis also provides insight into the\nminority carrier mobility which is a parameter not commonly reported in the\nliterature. Hole mobilities on the order of 500 - 750 cm2/Vs are reported for\nthe aforementioned doping range, which are comparable albeit longer than the\nmajority hole mobility for the same doping magnitude in p-InGaAs. A radiative\nrecombination coefficient of (0.5-0.2)x10^-10 cm^-3s^-1 is also extracted from\nthe ensuing analysis for an InGaAs thickness of 2.7 um. Preliminary evidence is\nalso given for both heavy and light hole diffusion. The dark current of\nInP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors with 25 and 15 um pitches are then calibrated\nto device simulations and correlated to the extracted diffusion lengths and\ndoping concentrations. An effective Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of between\n90-200 us provides the best fit to the dark current of these structures.\n", "  The MICROSCOPE space mission aims at testing the Equivalence Principle (EP)\nwith an accuracy of $10^{-15}$. The test is based on the precise measurement\ndelivered by a differential electrostatic accelerometer on-board a drag-free\nmicrosatellite which includes two cylindrical test masses submitted to the same\ngravitational field and made of different materials. The experiment consists in\ntesting the equality of the electrostatic acceleration applied to the masses to\nmaintain them relatively motionless at a well-known frequency. This high\nprecision experiment is compatible with only very little perturbations.\nHowever, aliasing arises from the finite time span of the measurement, and is\namplified by measurement losses. These effects perturb the measurement\nanalysis. Numerical simulations have been run to estimate the contribution of a\nperturbation at any frequency on the EP violation frequency and to test its\ncompatibility with the mission specifications. Moreover, different data\nanalysis procedures have been considered to select the one minimizing these\neffects taking into account the uncertainty about the frequencies of the\nimplicated signals.\n", "  We prove the asymptotic large volume expression of diagonal form factors in\nintegrable models by evaluating carefully the diagonal limit of a non-diagonal\nform factor in which we send the rapidity of the extra particle to infinity.\n", "  An analysis of the energy exchange by photons is presented based on\nsingle-photon Gedanken experiments and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nExcluding hidden variable properties of a single photon one has to accept that\nthe total photon trajectory undergoes causal influences from the final state\nseparated in time and space from the initial state: nonlocality and\nnontemporality.\n", "  In this review article, we give overview on the extended chiral quark models.\nIn particular, how these models are extended to include the higher-order\ninteractions, quantized fields, logarithmic potential and the effect of these\nmodifications on hadron properties at hot and dense mediums. In addition, how\nwe deal with non-normalization of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model by using\nmid-point technique. Therefore, the extended quark models give satisfied\nresults in comparison with lattice QCD at finite temperature and baryonic\nchemical potential. The extra effort is needed to deal with chiral quark models\nin the presence of external magnetic field at finite temperature and density.\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are traditionally divided empirically into two\nmain classes: \"radio-loud\" and \"radio-quiet\" sources. These labels, which are\nmore than fifty years old, are obsolete, misleading, and wrong. I argue that\nAGN should be classified based on a fundamentally physical rather than just an\nobservational difference, namely the presence (or lack) of strong relativistic\njets, and that we should use the terms \"jetted\" and \"non-jetted\" AGN instead.\n", "  Formation of large volume fractions of Mn-Ni-Si precipitates (MNSPs) causes\nexcess irradiation embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels at\nhigh, extended-life fluences. Thus, a new and unique, semi-empirical cluster\ndynamics model was developed to study the evolution of MNSPs in low- Cu RPV\nsteels. The model is based on CALPHAD thermodynamics and radiation enhanced\ndiffusion ki- netics. The thermodynamics dictates the compositional and\ntemperature dependence of the free energy reductions that drive precipitation.\nThe model treats both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, where the\nlatter occurs on cascade damage, like dislocation loops. The model has only\nfour adjustable parameters that were fit to an atom probe tomography (APT)\ndatabase. The model predictions are in semi-quantitative agreement with\nsystematic Mn, Ni and Si composition variations in alloys character- ized by\nAPT, including a sensitivity to local tip-to-tip variations even in the same\nsteel. The model predicts that heterogeneous nucleation plays a critical role\nin MNSP formation in lower alloy Ni contents. Single variable assessments of\ncompositional effects show that Ni plays a dominant role, while even small\nvariations in irradiation temperature can have a large effect on theMNSP\nevolution. Within typical RPV steel ranges, Mn and Si have smaller effects. The\ndelayed but then rapid growth of MNSPs to large volume fractions at high\nfluence is well predicted by the model. For purposes of illustration, the\neffect of MNSPs on transition temperature shifts are presented based on\nwell-established microstructure-prop- erty and property-property models.\n", "  Lecture notes for the course \"Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and applications\nin topological quantum field theory\" given at the University of Notre Dame in\nthe Fall 2016 for a mathematical audience. In these lectures we give a slow\nintroduction to the perturbative path integral for gauge theories in\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism and the associated mathematical concepts.\n", "  The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory's Synthesis Telescope provides\nthe highest resolution data (1 arcmin and 0.82 km/s) to date of an HI worm\ncandidate. Observed as part of the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey,\nmushroom-shaped GW 123.4-1.5 extends only a few hundred parsecs, contains ~10^5\nsolar masses of neutral hydrogen, and appears unrelated to a conventional shell\nor chimney structure. Our preliminary Zeus-2d models use a single off-plane\nexplosion with a modest (~10^{51} ergs) energy input. These generic simulations\ngenerate, interior to an expanding outer blast wave, a buoyant cloud whose\nstructure resembles the morphology of the observed feature. Unlike typical\nmodel superbubbles, the stem can be narrow because its width is not governed by\nthe pressure behind the blast wave nor the disk scale height. Using this type\nof approach it should be possible to more accurately model the thin stem and\nother details of GW 123.4-1.5 in the future.\n", "  We report the results of our investigations on a polycrystalline sample of\nLu$_2$Ir$_3$Si$_5$ which crystallizes in the U$_2$Co$_3$Si$_5$ type structure\n(Ibam). These investigations comprise powder X-ray diffraction, magnetic\nsusceptibility, electrical resistivity and high temperature (120-300 K) heat\ncapacity studies. Our results reveal that the sample undergoes a\nsuperconducting transition below 3.5 K. It also undergoes a first order phase\ntransition between 150-250 K as revealed by an upturn in the resistivity, a\ndiasmagnetic drop in the magnetic susceptibility and a large anomaly (20-30\nJ/mol K) in the specific heat data. We observe a huge thermal hysteresis of\nalmost 45 K between the cooling and warming data across this high temperature\ntransition in all our measurements. Low temperature X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements at 87 K reveals that the compound undergoes a structural change at\nthe high temperature transition. Resistivity data taken in repeated cooling and\nwarming cycles indicate that at the high temperature transition, the system\ngoes into a highly metastable state and successive heating/cooling curves are\nfound to lie above the previous one and the resistance keeps increasing with\nevery thermal cycle. The room temperature resistance of a thermaly cycled piece\nof the sample decays exponentialy with time with a decay time constant\nestimated to be about 10$^4$ secs. The anomaly (upturn) in the resistivity and\nthe large drop (almost 45%) in the susceptibility across the high temperature\ntransition suggest that the observed structural change is accompanied or\ninduced by an electronic transition.\n"]}
