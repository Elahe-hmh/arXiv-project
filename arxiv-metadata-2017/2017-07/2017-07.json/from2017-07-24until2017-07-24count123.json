Our approach is to implement a semi-numerical scheme to\ncalculate the 3-dimensional structure of ionized regions surrounding a massive\nhalo at high redshift, including the ionizing influence of a luminous quasar.\nAs part of our analysis we briefly contrast our scheme with published\nsemi-numerical models. We calculate mock 21cm spectra along the line of sight\ntowards high redshift quasars, and estimate the ability of the planned\nMurchison Widefield Array to detect the presence of HII regions. The\nsignal-to-noise for detection will drop as the characteristic bubble size grows\nduring reionization because the quasar's influence becomes less prominent.\nHowever, quasars will imprint a detectable signature on observed 21cm spectra\nthat is distinct from a region of typical IGM. At epochs where the mean\nhydrogen neutral fraction is ~30% or greater we find that neutral gas in the\nIGM surrounding a single quasar will be detectable (at a significance of 5\nsigma) within 100 hour integrations in more than 50% of cases. 1000 hour\nintegrations will be required to detect a smaller neutral fraction of 15% in\nmore than 50% of cases. A highly significant detection will be possible in only\n100 hours for a stack of 10 smaller 3 proper Mpc HII regions. The accurate\nmeasurement of the global average neutral fraction (<x_HI>) will be limited by\nsystematic fluctuations between lines of sight for single HII regions. We\nestimate the accuracy with which the global neutral fraction could be measured\nfrom a single HII region to be 50%, 30% and 20% for <x_HI> ~ 0.15, 0.3 and 0.5\nrespectively.\n", "  We assess the impact of Galactic synchrotron foreground removal on the\nobservation of high-redshift quasar HII regions in redshifted 21-cm emission.\nWe consider the case where a quasar is observed in an intergalactic medium\n(IGM) whose ionisation structure evolves slowly relative to the light crossing\ntime of the HII region, as well as the case where the evolution is rapid. The\nlatter case is expected towards the end of the reionisation era where the\nhighest redshift luminous quasars will be observed. In the absence of\nforegrounds the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM could be measured\ndirectly from the contrast between the HII region and surrounding IGM. However,\nwe find that foreground removal lowers the observed contrast between the HII\nregion and the IGM. This indicates that measurement of the neutral fraction\nwould require modelling to correct for this systematic effect. On the other\nhand, foreground removal does not modify the most prominent features of the\n21-cm maps. Using a simple algorithm we demonstrate that measurements of the\nsize and shape of observed HII regions will not be affected by continuum\nforeground removal. Moreover, measurements of these quantities will not be\nadversely affected by the presence of a rapidly evolving IGM.\n", "  A prototype Silicon-Tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) for an\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) detector was installed and tested during\nsummer and autumn 2006 at CERN. The detector had 6480 silicon pads of dimension\n1x1 cm^2. Data were collected with electron beams in the energy range 6 to 45\nGeV. The analysis described in this paper focuses on electromagnetic shower\nreconstruction and characterises the ECAL response to electrons in terms of\nenergy resolution and linearity. The detector is linear to within approximately\nthe 1% level and has a relative energy resolution of (16.6 +- 0.1)/\n\\sqrt{E(GeV}) + 1.1 +- 0.1 (%). The spatial uniformity and the time stability\nof the ECAL are also addressed.\n", "  We assess the effect of a population of high-redshift quasars on the 21-cm\npower spectrum during the epoch of reionisation. Our approach is to implement a\nsemi-numerical scheme to calculate the three-dimensional structure of ionised\nregions surrounding massive halos at high redshift. We include the ionising\ninfluence of luminous quasars by populating a simulated overdensity field with\nquasars using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm. We find that quasars modify\nboth the amplitude and shape of the power spectrum at a level which is of the\nsame order as the fractional contribution to reionisation. The modification is\nfound both at constant redshift and at constant global neutral fraction, and\narises because ionising photons produced by quasars are biased relative to the\ndensity field at a level that is higher than steller ionising photons. Our\nresults imply that quasar ionisation will need to be included in detailed\nmodelling of observed 21-cm power spectra.\n", "  We introduce a proposal for explaining manganites behavior, in the\nPr1-xCaxMnO3 series with x=0.30-0.50. We carry out computer simulations for the\nOguchi model along with the crystal field contribution. We contrast the\noutcomings to experimental measurements made with a commercial magnetometer\nSQUID. For analyzing the magnetization drop at low temperatures, we take into\naccount quasi-probability distributions.\n", "  Measurement of redshifted 21-cm emission from neutral hydrogen promises to be\nthe most effective method for studying the reionisation history of hydrogen\nand, indirectly, the first galaxies. These studies will be limited not by raw\nsensitivity to the signal, but rather, by bright foreground radiation from\nGalactic and extragalactic radio sources and the Galactic continuum. In\naddition, leakage due to gain errors and non-ideal feeds conspire to further\ncontaminate low-frequency radio obsevations. This leakage leads to a portion of\nthe complex linear polarisation signal finding its way into Stokes I, and\ninhibits the detection of the non-polarised cosmological signal from the epoch\nof reionisation. In this work, we show that rotation measure synthesis can be\nused to recover the signature of cosmic hydrogen reionisation in the presence\nof contamination by polarised foregrounds. To achieve this, we apply the\nrotation measure synthesis technique to the Stokes I component of a synthetic\ndata cube containing Galactic foreground emission, the effect of instrumental\npolarisation leakage, and redshifted 21-cm emission by neutral hydrogen from\nthe epoch of reionisation. This produces an effective Stokes I Faraday\ndispersion function for each line of sight, from which instrumental\npolarisation leakage can be fitted and subtracted. Our results show that it is\npossible to recover the signature of reionisation in its late stages (z ~ 7) by\nway of the 21-cm power spectrum, as well as through tomographic imaging of\nionised cavities in the intergalactic medium.\n", "  We study the effects of spin-antisymmetric interactions on the stability of a\nLandau-Fermi liquid on the square lattice, using the generalized Pomeranchuk\nmethod for two-dimensional lattice systems. In particular, we analyze\ninteractions that could induce instabilities of the so called spin-split type,\nthat is when spin-up and spin-down Fermi surfaces are displaced with respect to\neach other. The phase space is studied as a function of the strength of the\ninteraction $V$, the electron chemical potential $\\mu$ and an external magnetic\nfield $h$. We find that such interactions produce in general an enhancement of\nthe instability region of the Landau-Fermi liquid. More interestingly, in\ncertain regions of the $V$-$\\mu$ phase space, we find a reentrant behaviour as\na function of the magnetic field $h$, similar to that found in recent\nexperiments, e.g. in URu$_2$Si$_2$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$.\n", "  We study Fermi liquids with a Fermi surface that lacks continuous rotational\ninvariance, and in the presence of an arbitrary quartic interaction. We obtain\nthe expressions of the generalized static susceptibilities that measure the\nlinear response of a generic order parameter to a perturbation of the\nHamiltonian. We apply our formulae to the spin and charge susceptibilities.\nBased on the resulting expressions, we make a proposal for the definition of\nthe Landau parameters in non-isotropic Fermi liquid.\n", "  The most ambitious project within the DREsden Sodium facility for DYNamo and\nthermohydraulic studies (DRESDYN) at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf\n(HZDR) is the set-up of a precession-driven dynamo experiment. After discussing\nthe scientific background and some results of water pre-experiments and\nnumerical predictions, we focus on the numerous structural and design problems\nof the machine. We also outline the progress of the building's construction,\nand the status of some other experiments that are planned in the framework of\nDRESDYN.\n", "  We investigate the perturbative aspects of Rozansky-Witten's 3d\n$\\sigma$-model using Costello's approach to the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV)\nformalism. We show that the BV quantization (in Costello's sense) of the model,\nwhich produces a perturbative quantum field theory, can be obtained via the\nconfiguration space method of regularization due to Kontsevich and\nAxelrod-Singer. We also study the factorization algebra structure for quantum\nobservables following Costello-Gwilliam. In particular, we show that the\ncohomology of local quantum observables on a genus $g$ handle body is given by\n$H^*(X,(\\wedge^*T_X)^{\\otimes g})$ (where $X$ is the target manifold), and\nprove that the partition function reproduces the Rozansky-Witten invariants.\n", "  We present a new space mission concept that is capable of finding, detecting,\nand tracking 90% of near-Earth objects (NEO) with H magnitude of $\\rm H\\leq22$\n(i.e., $\\sim$140 m in size) that are potentially hazardous to the Earth. The\nnew mission concept relies on two emerging technologies: the technique of\nsynthetic tracking and the new generation of small and capable interplanetary\nspacecraft. Synthetic tracking is a technique that de-streaks asteroid images\nby taking multiple fast exposures. With synthetic tracking, an 800 sec\nobservation with a 10 cm telescope in space can detect a moving object with\napparent magnitude of 20.5 without losing sensitivity from streaking. We refer\nto NEOs with a minimum orbit intersection distance of $< 0.002$ au as\nEarth-grazers (EGs), representing typical albedo distributions. We show that a\nconstellation of six SmallSats (comparable in size to 9U CubeSats) equipped\nwith 10 cm synthetic tracking cameras and evenly-distributed in 1.0 au\nheliocentric orbit could detect 90% of EGs with $\\rm H \\leq 22~mag$ in\n$\\sim$3.8 years of observing time. A more advanced constellation of nine 20 cm\ntelescopes could detect 90% of $\\rm H=24.2~mag$ (i.e., $\\rm \\sim 50~m$ in size)\nEGs in less than 5 years.\n", "  We present a Korn-type inequality in a planar setting for special functions\nof bounded deformation. We prove that for each function in SBD$^2$ with\nsufficiently small jump set the distance of the function and its derivative\nfrom an infinitesimal rigid motion can be controlled in terms of the linearized\nelastic strain outside of a small exceptional set of finite perimeter.\nParticularly the result shows that each function in SBD$^2$ has bounded\nvariation away from an arbitrarily small part of the domain.\n", "  We present the response time measurements of a Cs2Te photocathode illuminated\nwith two 100 fs duration, variable time separation laser pulses at 266 nm\nwavelength. The response time was confirmed in dispersive region downstream of\na 12-cell standing wave S-band acceleration structure using a well-known RF\nzero-crossing technique. At the same time it was also measured by changing\nmechanical path-length difference between two micro-bunches. Both methods agree\nthat Cs2Te photocathode time response is of the order of 250 fs and thereby it\nis possible to generate and control a THz sequence of relativistic electron\nbunches by a conventional S-band RF gun. This result further opens a\npossibility to construct wide-range tunable THz FEL.\n", "  Studies on the heavy-fermion pyrochlore iridate (Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$) point to\nthe role of time-reversal-symmetry breaking in geometrically frustrated Kondo\nlattices. With this motivation, here we study the effect of Kondo coupling and\nchiral spin liquids in a frustrated $J_1-J_2$ model on a square lattice. We\ntreat the Kondo effect within a slave-fermion approach, and discuss our results\nin the context of a proposed global phase diagram for heavy fermion metals. We\ncalculate the anomalous Hall response for the chiral states of both the Kondo\ndestroyed and Kondo screened phases. Across the quantum critical point, a\nreconstruction of the Fermi surface leads to a sudden change of the Berry\ncurvature distribution and, consequently, a jump of the anomalous Hall\nconductance. We discuss the implications of our results for the heavy-fermion\npyrochlore iridate and propose an interface structure based on Kondo insulators\nto further explore such effects.\n", "  We report observation of kHz-pulsed-laser-accelerated electron energies up to\n3 MeV in the -$k_\\text{laser}$ (backward) direction from a 3 mJ laser\ninteracting at normal incidence with a solid density, flowing-liquid target.\nThe electrons/MeV/s.r. >1 MeV recorded here using a mJ-class laser exceeds or\nequals that of prior super-ponderomotive electron studies employing lasers at\nlower repetition-rates and oblique incidence. Focal intensity of the\n40-fs-duration laser is 1.5 $\\cdot$ 10$^{18}$ W cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to\nonly ~80 keV electron ponderomotive energy. Varying laser intensity confirms\nelectron energies in the laser-reflection direction well above what might be\nexpected from ponderomotive scaling in normal-incidence laser-target geometry.\nThis direct, normal-incidence energy spectrum measurement is made possible by\nmodifying the final focusing off-axis-paraboloid (OAP) mirror with a central\nhole that allows electrons to pass, and restoring laser intensity through\nadaptive optics. A Lanex-based, optics-free high-acquisition rate (>100 Hz)\nmagnetic electron-spectrometer was developed for this study to enable\nshot-to-shot statistical analysis and real-time feedback, which was leveraged\nin finding optimal pre-plasma conditions. 3D Particle-in-cell simulations of\nthe interaction show qualitative super-ponderomotive spectral agreement with\nexperiment. The demonstration of a high-repetition-rate, high-flux source\ncontaining >MeV electrons from a few-mJ, 40 fs laser and a simple liquid target\nencourages development of future $\\geq$kHz-repetition, fs-duration\nelectron-beam applications.\n", "  It has long been suspected that the non-cutoff Boltzmann operator has similar\ncoercivity properties as a fractional Laplacian. This has led to the hope that\nthe homogenous Boltzmann equation enjoys similar regularity properties as the\nheat equation with a fractional Laplacian. In particular, the weak solution of\nthe fully nonlinear non-cutoff homogenous Boltzmann equation with initial datum\nin $L^1_2(\\mathbb{R}^d)\\cap L\\log L(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, i.e., finite mass, energy\nand entropy, should immediately become Gevrey regular for strictly positive\ntimes. We prove this conjecture for Maxwellian molecules.\n", "  We use the Dark-ages, Reionization And Galaxy-formation Observables from\nNumerical Simulations (DRAGONS) framework to investigate the effect of\ngalaxy-formation physics on the morphology and statistics of ionized hydrogen\n(HII) regions during the Epoch of Reioinization (EoR). DRAGONS\nself-consistently couples a semi-analytic galaxy-formation model with the\ninhomogeneous ionizing UV background, and can therefore be used to study the\ndependence of morphology and statistics of reionization on feedback phenomena\nof the ionizing source galaxy population. Changes in galaxy-formation physics\nmodify the sizes of HII regions and the amplitude and shape of 21-cm power\nspectra. Of the galaxy physics investigated, we find that supernova feedback\nplays the most important role in reionization, with HII regions up to $\\approx\n20$ per cent smaller and a fractional difference in the amplitude of power\nspectra of up to $\\approx 17$ per cent at fixed ionized fraction in the absence\nof this feedback. We compare our galaxy-formation-based reionization models\nwith past calculations that assume constant stellar-to-halo mass ratios and\nfind that with the correct choice of minimum halo mass, such models can mimic\nthe predicted reionization morphology. Reionization morphology at fixed neutral\nfraction is therefore not uniquely determined by the details of galaxy\nformation, but is sensitive to the mass of the haloes hosting the bulk of the\nionizing sources. Simple EoR parametrizations are therefore accurate predictors\nof reionization statistics. However, a complete understanding of reionization\nusing future 21-cm observations will require interpretation with realistic\ngalaxy-formation models, in combination with other observations.\n", "  We study weak solutions of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Maxwellian\nmolecules with a logarithmic singularity of the collision kernel for grazing\ncollisions. Even though in this situation the Boltzmann operator enjoys only a\nvery weak coercivity estimate, it still leads to strong smoothing of weak\nsolutions in accordance to the smoothing expected by an analogy with a\nlogarithmic heat equation.\n", "  We propose a predictive inert 2 Higgs doublet model, where the Standard Model\n(SM) symmetry is extended by $S_{3}\\otimes Z_{2}\\otimes Z_{12}$ and the field\ncontent is enlarged by extra scalar fields, charged exotic fermions and two\nheavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The charged exotic fermions generate a\nnontrivial quark mixing and provide one-loop-level masses for the first- and\nsecond-generation charged fermions. The masses of the light active neutrinos\nare generated from a one loop-level radiative seesaw mechanism. Our model\nsuccessfully explains the observed SM fermion mass and mixing pattern.\n", "  More than 15 years ago Guttmann and V\\\"oge [J. Statist. Plann. Inference,\n{\\bf 101}, 107 (2002)], introduced a model of friendly walkers. Since then it\nhas remained unsolved. In this paper we provide the exact solution to a closely\nallied model, originally introduced by Tsuchiya and Katori [J. Phys. Soc. Japan\n{\\bf 67}, 1655 (1988)], which essentially only differs in the boundary\nconditions. The exact solution is expressed in terms of the reciprocal of the\ngenerating function for vicious walkers which is a D-finite function. However,\nratios of D-finite functions are inherently not D-finite and in this case we\nprove that the friendly walkers generating function is the solution to a\nnon-linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients, it is in other\nwords D-algebraic. We then show via numerically exact calculations that the\ngenerating function of the original model can also be expressed as a D-finite\nfunction times the reciprocal of the generating function for vicious walkers.\nWe obtain an expression for this D-finite function in terms of a ${}_{2}F_{1}$\nhypergeometric function with a rational pullback and its first and second\nderivatives.\n", "  The monodromy relations in string theory provide a powerful and elegant\nformalism to understand some of the deepest properties of tree-level field\ntheory amplitudes, like the color-kinematics duality. This duality has been\ninstrumental in tremendous progress on the computations of loop amplitudes in\nquantum field theory, but a higher-loop generalisation of the monodromy\nconstruction was lacking.\n  In this letter, we extend the monodromy relations to higher loops in open\nstring theory. Our construction, based on a contour deformation argument inside\nopen string diagrams, leads to new identities that relate planar and non-planar\ntopologies in string theory. We write one and two-loop monodromy formulae\nexplicitly at any multiplicity. In the field theory limit, at one-loop we\nobtain identities that reproduce known results. At two loops, we check our\nformulae by unitarity in the case of the four-point N=4 super-Yang-Mills\namplitude.\n", "  Unraveling general properties of Green's functions of quantum dissipative\nsystems is of both experimental relevance and theoretical interest. Here, we\nstudy the spin-boson model as a prototype. By utilizing the Majorana- Fermion\nrepresentation together with the polaron transformation, we establish a\ntheoretical approach to analyze Green's functions of the spin-boson model. In\ncontrast to conventional perturbation theories either in the tunneling energy\nor in the system-bath coupling strength, the proposed scheme gives reliable\nresults over wide regimes of the coupling strength, bias, as well as\ntemperature. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we consider the\nsusceptibility as well as the symmetrized spin correlation function (SSCF)\nwhich can be expressed in terms of Green's functions. Thorough investigations\nare made on systems embedded in Ohmic or sub-Ohmic bosonic baths. We found the\nso-obtained SSCF is the same as that of the non-interacting blip approximation\n(NIBA) in unbiased systems while it is applicable for a wider range of\ntemperature in the biased systems compared with the NIBA. We also show that a\nprevious perturbation result is recovered as a weak coupling limit of the\nso-obtained SSCF. Furthermore, by studying the quantum criticality of the\nsusceptibility, we confirm the validity of the quantum-toclassical mapping in\nthe whole sub-Ohmic regime.\n", "  Using synthetic absorption lines generated from 3D hydro-dynamical\nsimulations we explore how the velocity of a starburst-driven galactic wind\ncorrelates with the star formation rate (SFR) and SFR density. We find strong\ncorrelations until the scaling relations flatten abruptly at a point set by the\nmass loading of the starburst. Below this point the scaling relation depends on\nthe temperature regime being probed by the absorption line, not on the mass\nloading. The exact scaling relation depends on whether the maximum or mean\nvelocity of the absorption line is used. We find that the outflow velocity of\nneutral gas is four to five times lower than the average velocity of the\nhottest gas, with the difference in velocity between the neutral and ionized\ngas increasing with gas ionization. Thus, absorption lines of neutral or low\nionized gas will underestimate the outflow velocity of hot gas, severely\nunderestimating outflow energetics.\n", "  We define Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) as maximal material subsets\nwhose advective evolution is maximally persistent to weak diffusion. For their\ndetection, we first transform the Eulerian Fokker--Planck equation (FPE) into a\ndiffusion-only equation in Lagrangian coordinates. In this framework, LCSs\nexpress themselves as almost-invariant sets under this diffusion process. The\nEulerian-to-Lagrangian coordinate transformation separates the reversible\neffects of advection from the irreversible joint effects of advection and\ndiffusion. We approximate the Lagrangian FPE in two steps: first, we take the\ntime-average of the diffusion tensors and identify Froyland's dynamic Laplacian\nas the associated generator; second, we introduce a deformed Riemannian\ngeometry that is consistent with the averaged anisotropic diffusion. The latter\nturns the diffusion equation into a geometric heat equation, where the\ndistribution of heat is governed by the dynamically induced intrinsic geometry\non the material manifold, to which we refer as the geometry of mixing. We study\nand visualize this geometry in detail, and discuss the connections to diffusion\nbarriers, i.e., boundaries of LCSs. We demonstrate the consistency with the\ngeometric analysis in several numerical examples. Our approach facilitates the\ndiscovery of strong mathematical connections between several prominent methods\nfor coherent structure detection, including the probabilistic transfer\noperator, the dynamic Laplacian, the variational geometric approaches to\nelliptic and parabolic LCSs and the effective diffusivity approach.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of a small spherical particle driven through an\nunbounded viscoelastic shear flow by an external force. We give analytical\nsolutions to both the mobility problem (velocity of forced particle) and the\nresistance problem (force on fixed particle), valid to second order in the\ndimensionless Deborah and Weissenberg numbers, which represent the elastic\nrelaxation time of the fluid relative to the rate of translation and the\nimposed shear rate. We find a shear-induced lift at $O({\\rm Wi})$, a modified\ndrag at $O({\\rm De}^2)$ and $O({\\rm Wi}^2)$, and a second lift that is\northogonal to the first, at $O({\\rm Wi}^2)$. The relative importance of these\neffects depends strongly on the orientation of the forcing relative to the\nshear. We discuss how these forces affect the terminal settling velocity in an\ninclined shear flow. We also describe a new basis set of symmetric Cartesian\ntensors, and demonstrate how they enable general tensorial perturbation\ncalculations such as the present theory. In particular this scheme allows us to\nwrite down a solution to the inhomogenous Stokes equations, required by the\nperturbation expansion, by a sequence of algebraic manipulations well suited to\ncomputer implementation.\n", "  The couplings of the electroweak effective theory contain information on the\nheavy-mass scales which are no-longer present in the low-energy Lagrangian. We\nbuild a general effective Lagrangian, implementing the electroweak chiral\nsymmetry breaking $SU(2)_L\\otimes SU(2)_R\\to SU(2)_{L+R}$, which couples the\nknown particle fields to heavier states with bosonic quantum numbers\n$J^P=0^\\pm$ and $1^\\pm$. We consider colour-singlet heavy fields that are in\nsinglet or triplet representations of the electroweak group. Integrating out\nthese heavy scales, we analyze the pattern of low-energy couplings among the\nlight fields which are generated by the massive states. We adopt a generic\nnon-linear realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking with a singlet\nHiggs, without making any assumption about its possible doublet structure.\nSpecial attention is given to the different possible descriptions of massive\nspin-1 fields and the differences arising from naive implementations of these\nformalisms, showing their full equivalence once a proper short-distance\nbehaviour is required.\n", "  We construct a $q$-boson representation of the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra\nwhose structure function is given by the stochastic $R$ matrix of\n$U_q(A^{(1)}_n)$ introduced recently. The representation involves quantum\ndilogarithm type infinite products in the $n(n-1)/2$-fold tensor product of\n$q$-bosons. It leads to a matrix product formula of the stationary\nprobabilities in the $U_q(A_n^{(1)})$-zero range process on a one-dimensional\nperiodic lattice.\n", "  First results of a new spherical Couette experiment are presented. The liquid\nmetal flow in a spherical shell is exposed to a homogeneous axial magnetic\nfield. For a Reynolds number Re=1000, we study the effect of increasing\nHartmann number Ha. The resulting flow structures are inspected by ultrasound\nDoppler velocimetry. With a weak applied magnetic field, we observe an\nequatorially anti-symmetric jet instability with azimuthal wave number m=3. As\nthe magnetic field strength increases, this instability vanishes. When the\nfield is increased further, an equatorially symmetric return flow instability\narises. Our observations are shown to be in good agreement with linear\nstability analysis and non-linear flow simulations.\n", "  The current-driven, kink-type Tayler instability (TI) is a key ingredient of\nthe Tayler-Spruit dynamo model for the generation of stellar magnetic fields,\nbut is also discussed as a mechanism that might hamper the up-scaling of liquid\nmetal batteries. Under some circumstances, the TI involves a helical flow\npattern which goes along with some alpha effect. Here we focus on the chiral\nsymmetry breaking and the related impact on the alpha effect that would be\nneeded to close the dynamo loop in the Tayler-Spruit model. For low magnetic\nPrandtl numbers, we observe intrinsic oscillations of the alpha effect. These\noscillations serve then as the basis for a synchronized Tayler-Spruit dynamo\nmodel, which could possibly link the periodic tidal forces of planets with the\noscillation periods of stellar dynamos.\n", "  We investigate interference and correlation effects when several detuned\nemitters are placed along a one-dimensional photonic waveguide. Such a setup\nallows multiple interactions between the photons and the strongly coupled\nemitters, and underlies proposed devices for quantum information processing. We\nshow, first, that a pair of detuned two-level systems (2LS) separated by a half\nwavelength mimic a driven {\\Lambda}-type three-level system (3LS) in both the\nsingle- and two- photon sectors. There is an interference-induced transparency\npeak at which the fluorescence is quenched, leaving the transmitted photons\ncompletely uncorrelated. Slightly away from this separation, we find that the\ninelastic scattering (fluorescence) is large, leading to nonlinear effects such\nas non-reciprocity (rectification). We connect this non-reciprocity to\ninelastic scattering caused by driving a dark pole and so derive a condition\nfor maximum rectification. Finally, by placing a true 3LS midway between the\ntwo 2LS, we show that elastic scattering produces only transmission, but\ninelastic scattering nevertheless occurs (the fluorescence is not quenched)\ncausing substantial photon correlations.\n", "  We introduce a notion of quasi-lisse vertex algebras, which generalizes\nadmissible affine vertex algebras. We show that the normalized character of an\nordinary module over a quasi-lisse vertex operator algebra has a modular\ninvariance property, in the sense that it satisfies a modular linear\ndifferential equation. As an application we obtain the explicit character\nformulas of simple affine vertex algebras associated with the Deligne\nexceptional series at level $-h^{\\vee}/6-1$, which express the homogeneous\nSchur indices of 4d SCFTs studied by Beem, Lemos, Liendo, Peelaers, Rastelli\nand van Rees, as quasi-modular forms.\n", "  Random sequential addition (RSA) models are used in a large variety of\ncontexts to model particle aggregation and jamming. A key feature of these\nmodels is the algebraic time dependence of the asymptotic jamming coverage as\n$t\\to\\infty$. For the RSA of monodisperse non-spherical particles the scaling\nis generally believed to be $~t^{-\\nu}$, where $\\nu=1/d_{\\rm f}$ for a particle\nwith $d_{\\rm f}$ degrees of freedom. While the $d_{\\rm f}=1$ result of spheres\n(Renyi's classical car parking problem) can be derived analytically, evidence\nfor the $1/d_{\\rm f}$ scaling for arbitrary particle shapes has so far only\nbeen provided from empirical studies on a case-by-case basis. Here, we show\nthat the RSA of arbitrary non-spherical particles, whose centres of mass are\nconstrained to fall on a line, can be solved analytically for moderate aspect\nratios. The asymptotic jamming coverage is determined by a Laplace-type\nintegral, whose asymptotics is fully specified by the contact distance between\ntwo particles of given orientations. The analysis of the contact function $r$\nshows that the scaling exponent depends on particle shape and falls into two\nuniversality classes for generic shapes with $\\tilde{d}$ orientational degrees\nof freedom: (i) $\\nu=1/(1+\\tilde{d}/2)$ when $r$ is a smooth function of the\norientations as for smooth convex shapes, e.g., ellipsoids; (ii)\n$\\nu=1/(1+\\tilde{d})$ when $r$ contains singularities due to flat sides as for,\ne.g., spherocylinders and polyhedra. The exact solution explains in particular\nwhy many empirically observed scalings in $2d$ and $3d$ fall in between these\ntwo limiting values.\n", "  A search is presented for narrow resonances decaying to dijet final states in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV using data corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 12.9 inverse femtobarns. The dijet mass spectrum is\nwell described by a smooth parameterization and no significant evidence for the\nproduction of new particles is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level\nare reported on the production cross section for narrow resonances with masses\nabove 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude string\nresonances with masses below 7.4 TeV, scalar diquarks below 6.9 TeV, axigluons\nand colorons below 5.5 TeV, excited quarks below 5.4 TeV, color-octet scalars\nbelow 3.0 TeV, W' bosons below 2.7 TeV, Z' bosons below 2.1 TeV and between 2.3\nand 2.6 TeV, and RS gravitons below 1.9 TeV. These extend previous limits in\nthe dijet channel. Vector and axial-vector mediators in a simplified model of\ninteractions between quarks and dark matter are excluded below 2.0 TeV. The\nfirst limits in the dijet channel on dark matter mediators are presented as\nfunctions of dark matter mass and are compared to the exclusions of dark matter\nin direct detection experiments.\n", "  Many physical, biological, and social phenomena can be described by cascades\ntaking place on a network. Often, the activity can be empirically observed, but\nnot the underlying network of interactions. In this paper we offer three\ntopological methods to infer the structure of any directed network given a set\nof cascade arrival times. Our formulas hold for a very general class of models\nwhere the activation probability of a node is a generic function of its degree\nand the number of its active neighbors. We report high success rates for\nsynthetic and real networks, for several different cascade models.\n", "  Enhancing the performance of nanoscale ferroelectric (FE) field-effect\ntransistors and FE capacitors for memory devices and logic relies on\nminiaturizing the metal electrode/ferroelectric area and reducing the thickness\nof the insulator. Although size reductions improve data retention, deliver\nlower voltage threshold switching, and increase areal density, they also\ndegrade the functional electric polarization. There is a critical, nanometer\nlength $t_\\mathrm{FE}^*$ below which the polarization disappears owing to\ndepolarizing field effects. Here we show how to overcome the critical thickness\nlimit imposed on ferroelectricity by utilizing electrodes formed from a novel\nclass of materials known as polar metals. Electronic structure calculations on\nsymmetric polar-metal electrode/FE capacitor structures demonstrate that\nelectric polarizations can persist to the sub-nanometer scale with\n$t_\\mathrm{FE}^*\\rightarrow0$ when a component of the polar axis in the\nelectrode is perpendicular to the electrode/insulator interface. Our results\nreveal the importance of interfacial dipolar coherency in sustaining the\npolarization, which provides a platform for atomic scale structure-based design\nof functions that deteriorate in reduced dimensions.\n", "  It has been proven that quantum adders are forbidden by the laws of quantum\nmechanics. We analyze theoretical proposals for the implementation of\napproximate quantum adders and optimize them by means of genetic algorithms,\nimproving previous protocols in terms of efficiency and fidelity. Furthermore,\nwe experimentally realize a suitable approximate quantum adder with the cloud\nquantum computing facilities provided by IBM Quantum Experience. The\ndevelopment of approximate quantum adders enhances the toolbox of quantum\ninformation protocols, paving the way for novel applications in quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  We investigate two different kinds of quantum trajectories for a nonlinear\nphoton resonator subject to two-photon pumping, a configuration recently\nstudied for the generation of photonic Schroedinger cat states. In the absence\nof feedback control and in the strong-driving limit, the steady-state density\nmatrix is a statistical mixture of two states with equal weight. While along a\nsingle photon-counting trajectory the systems intermittently switches between\nan odd and an even cat state, we show that upon homodyne detection the\nsituation is different. Indeed, homodyne quantum trajectories reveal switches\nbetween coherent states of opposite phase.\n", "  The effect of the higher-order mesonic interactions is investigated on the\nchiral symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field. The\neffective of higher-order mesonic potential is employed and is numerically\nsolved in the mean-field approximation. The chiral symmetry breaking increases\nwith increasing magnetic field. Two sets of free parameterization are\ninvestigated on the magnetic catalysis. A comparison is discussed with the\noriginal sigma model and other studies. The obtained results are included that\nthe higher-order mesonic interactions play an important role in the magnetic\ncatalysis.\n", "  In this paper I construct the naive lattice Dirac Hamiltonian describing the\npropagation of fermions in a generic 2D optical metric for different lattice\nand flux-lattice geometries. First, I apply a top-down constructive approach\nthat we first proposed in [Boada {\\it et al.,New J. Phys.} {\\bf 13} 035002\n(2011)] to the honeycomb and to the brickwall lattices. I carefully discuss how\ngauge transformations that generalize momentum (and Dirac cone) shifts in the\nBrillouin zone in the Minkowski homogeneous case can be used in order to change\nthe phases of the hopping. In particular, I show that lattice Dirac Hamiltonian\nfor Rindler spacetime in the honeycomb and brickwall lattices can be realized\nby considering real and isotropic (but properly position dependent) tunneling\nterms. For completeness, I also discuss a suitable formulation of Rindler Dirac\nHamiltonian in semi-synthetic brickwall and $\\pi$-flux square lattices (where\none of the dimension is implemented by using internal spin states of atoms as\nwe originally proposed in [Boada {\\it et al.,Phys. Rev. Lett. } {\\bf 108}\n133001 (2012)] and [Celi {\\it et al.,Phys. Rev. Lett. } {\\bf 112} 043001\n(2012)]).\n", "  We investigate the high-field transport in monoclinic\n\\(\\beta\\)-Ga\\textsubscript{2}O\\textsubscript{3}} using a combination of ab\ninitio calculations and full band Monte Carlo (FBMC) simulation. Scattering\nrate calculation and the final state selection in the FBMC simulation use\ncomplete wave-vector (both electron and phonon) and crystal direction dependent\nelectron phonon interaction (EPI) elements. We propose and implement a\nsemi-coarse version of the Wannier-Fourier interpolation method [F. Giustino,\nM. L. Cohen, and S. G. Louie, Physical Review B, vol. 76, no. 16, 2007] for\nshort-range non-polar optical phonon (EPI) elements in order to ease the\ncomputational requirement in FBMC simulation. During the interpolation of the\nEPI, the inverse Fourier sum over the real-space electronic grids is done on a\ncoarse mesh while the unitary rotations are done on a fine mesh. This paper\nreports the high field transport in monoclinic\n\\(\\beta\\)-Ga\\textsubscript{2}O\\textsubscript{3}} with deep insight on the\ncontribution of electron-phonon interactions, and velocity-field\ncharacteristics for electric fields ranging up to 450 kV/cm in different\ncrystal directions. A peak velocity of $2\\times10^{7}& cm/s is estimated at an\nelectric field of 200 kV/cm.\n", "  When an open system is contacted with several thermal baths, the entropy\nproduced by the irreversible processes\n($dS_{\\mathrm{i}}=dS-\\sum_{\\alpha}\\text{\\dj}Q_{\\alpha}/T_{\\alpha}$) keeps\nincreasing, and this entropy production rate is always non-negative. But when\nthe system is contacted with some non-thermal baths containing quantum\ncoherence or squeezing, this entropy production formula does not apply. In this\npaper, we study the increasing rate of the mutual information between the open\nsystem and its environment. When the baths are canonical thermal ones, we prove\nthat this mutual information production rate could exactly return to the\nprevious entropy production rate. Further, we study an example of a single\nboson mode contacted with multiple squeezed thermal baths, where the\nconventional entropy production rate does not apply, and we find that this\nmutual information production rate still keeps non-negative, which means the\nmonotonic increasing of the correlation between the system and its environment.\n", "  The effect of laziness in the group chase and escape problem is studied using\na simple model. The laziness is introduced as random walks in two ways:\nuniformly and in a \"division of labor\" way. It is shown that, while the former\nis always ineffective, the latter can improve the efficiency of catching,\nthrough the formation of pincer attack configuration by diligent and lazy\nchasers.\n", "  Bismuth Selenide (Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$) is a topological insulator (TI) with a\nstructure consisting of stacked quintuple layers. Single crystal surfaces are\ncommonly prepared by mechanical cleaving. This work explores the use of low\nenergy Ar$^{+}$ ion bombardment and annealing (IBA) as an alternative method to\nproduce reproducible and stable Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ surfaces under ultra-high\nvacuum (UHV). It is found that a well-ordered surface can be prepared by a\nsingle cycle of 1 keV Ar$^{+}$ ion bombardment and 30 min of annealing. Low\nenergy electron diffraction (LEED) and detailed low energy ion scattering\n(LEIS) measurements show no differences between IBA-prepared surfaces and those\nprepared by $\\textit{in situ}$ cleaving in UHV. Analysis of the LEED patterns\nshows that the optimal annealing temperature is 450{\\deg}C. Angular LEIS scans\nreveal the formation of surface Se vacancies when the annealing temperature\nexceeds 520{\\deg}C.\n", "  Strategies to manage the risks posed by future sea-level rise hinge on a\nsound characterization of the inherent uncertainties. One of the major\nuncertainties is the possible rapid disintegration of large fractions of the\nAntarctic ice sheet in response to rising global temperatures. This could\npotentially lead to several meters of sea-level rise during the next few\ncenturies. Previous studies have typically been silent on two coupled\nquestions: (i) What are probabilistic estimates of this \"fast dynamics\"\ncontribution to sea-level rise? (ii) What are the implications for strategies\nto manage coastal flooding risks? Here, we present probabilistic hindcasts and\nprojections of sea-level rise to 2100. The fast dynamics mechanism is\napproximated by a simple parameterization, designed to allow for a careful\nquantification of the uncertainty in its contribution to sea-level rise. We\nestimate that global temperature increases ranging from 1.9 to 3.1{\\deg}C\ncoincide with fast Antarctic disintegration, and these contributions account\nfor sea-level rise of 21-74 centimeters this century (5-95% range,\nRepresentative Concentration Pathway 8.5). We use a simple cost-benefit\nanalysis of coastal defense to demonstrate in a didactic exercise how\nneglecting this mechanism and associated uncertainty can (i) lead to strategies\nwhich fall sizably short of protection targets and (ii) increase the expected\nnet costs.\n", "  In the framework of quantum information geometry, we derive, from quantum\nrelative Tsallis entropy, a family of quantum metrics on the space of full\nrank, N level quantum states, by means of a suitably defined coordinate free\ndifferential calculus. The cases N = 2, N = 3 are discussed in detail and\nnotable limits are analyzed. The radial limit procedure has been used to\nrecover quantum metrics for lower rank states, such as pure states. By using\nthe tomographic picture of quantum mechanics we have obtained the Fisher- Rao\nmetric for the space of quantum tomograms and derived a reconstruction formula\nof the quantum metric of density states out of the tomographic one. A new\ninequality obtained for probabilities of three spin-1/2 projections in three\nperpendicular directions is proposed to be checked in experiments with\nsuperconducting circuits.\n", "  Impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy (ICISS), which is a variation of\nlow energy ion scattering (LEIS) that employs large scattering angles, is\nperformed on Bi2Se3 surfaces prepared by ion bombardment and annealing (IBA).\nICISS angular scans are collected experimentally and simulated numerically\nalong the [120] and [-1 -2 0] azimuths, and the match of the positions of the\nflux peaks shows that the top three atomic layers are bulk-terminated. A newly\nobserved feature is identified as a minimum in the multiple scattering\nbackground when the ion beam incidence is along a low index direction.\nCalculated scans as a function of scattering angle are employed to identify the\nbehavior of flux peaks to show whether they originate from shadowing, blocking\nor both. This new method for analysis of large-angle LEIS data is shown to be\nuseful for accurately investigating complex surface structures.\n", "  Based on first-principles calculations and effective model analysis, we\npropose that the WC-type HfC, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), can\nhost a three-dimensional nodal chain semimetal state. Distinguished from the\nprevious material IrF4 [T. Bzdusek et al., Nature 538, 75 (2016)], the nodal\nchain here is protected by mirror reflection symmetries of a simple space\ngroup, while in IrF4 the nonsymmorphic space group with a glide plane is a\nnecessity. Moreover, in the presence of SOC, the nodal chain in WC type HfC\nevolves into Weyl points. In the Brillouin zone, a total of 30 pairs of Weyl\npoints in three types are obtained through the first-principles calculations.\nBesides, the surface states and the pattern of the surface Fermi arcs\nconnecting these Weyl points are studied, which may be measured by future\nexperiments.\n", "  Ambient noise in the eastern Arctic was studied from April to September 2013\nusing a 22 element vertical hydrophone array as it drifted from 89$^\\circ$23'N,\n64$^\\circ$35'W to 83$^\\circ$45'N, 4$^\\circ$28'W. The hydrophones recorded for\n108 min/day on six days/week with a sampling rate of 1953.125 Hz. After removal\nof data corrupted by non-acoustic transients, 19 days throughout the transit\nperiod were analyzed. Noise contributors identified include broadband and tonal\nice noises, bowhead whale calling, seismic airgun surveys, and earthquake $T$\nphases. The bowhead whale or whales detected are believed to belong to the\nendangered Spitsbergen population and were recorded when the array was as far\nnorth as 86$^\\circ$24'N. Median power spectral estimates and empirical\nprobability density functions (PDFs) along the array transit show a change in\nthe ambient noise levels corresponding to seismic survey airgun occurrence and\nreceived level at low frequencies and transient ice ice noises at high\nfrequencies. Median power for the same periods across the array show that this\nchange is consistent in depth. The median ambient noise for May 2013 was among\nthe lowest of the sparse reported observations in the eastern Arctic but\ncomparable to the more numerous observations of western Arctic noise levels.\n", "  We theoretically study the dynamics of skyrmion crystals in\nelectrically-insulating chiral magnets subjected to current-induced spin\ntorques by adjacent metallic layers. We develop an elasticity theory that\naccounts for the gyrotropic force engendered by the non-trivial topology of the\nspin texture, tensions at the boundaries due to the exchange of linear and spin\nangular momentum with the metallic reservoirs, and dissipation in the bulk of\nthe film. A steady translation of the skyrmion crystal is triggered by the\ncurrent-induced tensions and subsequently sustained by dissipative forces,\ngenerating an electromotive force on itinerant spins in the metals. This\nphenomenon should be revealed as a negative drag in an open two-terminal\ngeometry, or equivalently, as a positive magnetoresistance when the terminals\nare connected in parallel. We propose non-local transport measurements with\nthese salient features as a tool to characterize the phase diagram of\ninsulating chiral magnets.\n", "  Subjecting a many-body localized system to a time-periodic drive generically\nleads to delocalization and a transition to ergodic behavior if the drive is\nsufficiently strong or of sufficiently low frequency. Here we show that a\nspecific drive can have an opposite effect, taking a static delocalized system\ninto the many-body localized phase. We demonstrate this effect using a\none-dimensional system of interacting hardcore bosons subject to an oscillating\nlinear potential. The system is weakly disordered, and is ergodic absent the\ndriving. The time-periodic linear potential leads to a suppression of the\neffective static hopping amplitude, increasing the relative strengths of\ndisorder and interactions. Using numerical simulations, we find a transition\ninto the many-body localized phase above a critical driving frequency and in a\nrange of driving amplitudes. Our findings highlight the potential of driving\nschemes exploiting the coherent suppression of tunneling for engineering\nlong-lived Floquet phases.\n", "  The pairing symmetry of the newly proposed cobalt high temperature\n(high-$T_c$) superconductors formed by vertex shared cation-anion tetrahedral\ncomplexes is studied by the methods of mean field, random phase approximation\n(RPA) and functional renormalization group (FRG) analysis. The results of all\nthese methods show that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing symmetry is robustly favored\nnear half filling. The RPA and FRG methods, which are valid in weak interaction\nregions, predict that the superconducting state is also strongly orbital\nselective, namely the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital that has the largest density near\nhalf filling among the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals dominates superconducting\npairing. These results suggest that the new materials, if synthesized, can\nprovide indisputable test to high-$T_c$ pairing mechanism and the validity of\ndifferent theoretical methods.\n", "  In an effort to overcome the limitations of random spin-glass benchmarks for\nquantum annealers, focus has shifted to carefully-crafted gadget-based problems\nwhose logical structure has typically a planar topology. Recent experiments on\nthese gadget problems using a commercially-available quantum annealer have\ndemonstrated an impressive performance over a selection of commonly-used\nclassical optimization heuristics. Here we show that efficient classical\noptimization techniques, such as minimum-weight perfect matching, can solve\nthese gadget problems exactly and in polynomial time. We present approaches on\nhow to mitigate this shortcoming of commonly-used benchmark problems based on\nplanar logical topologies.\n", "  Backflow is the phenomenon that the probability current of a quantum particle\non the line can flow in the direction opposite to its momentum. In this\narticle, previous investigations of backflow, pertaining to interaction-free\ndynamics or purely kinematical aspects, are extended to scattering situations\nin short-range potentials. It is shown that backflow is a universal quantum\neffect which exists in any such potential, and is always of bounded spatial\nextent in a specific sense. The effects of reflection and transmission\nprocesses on backflow are investigated, both analytically for general\npotentials, and numerically in various concrete examples.\n", "  In this brief paper, we go through the theoretical steps of the spectral\nclustering on quantum computers by employing the phase estimation and the\namplitude amplification algorithms. We discuss circuit designs for each step\nand show how to obtain the clustering solution from the output state. In\naddition, we introduce a biased version of the phase estimation algorithm which\nsignificantly speeds up the amplitude amplification process. The complexity of\nthe whole process is analyzed: it is shown that when the circuit representation\nof a data matrix of order $N$ is produced through an ancilla based circuit in\nwhich the matrix is written as a sum of $L$ number of Householder matrices; the\ncomputational complexity is bounded by $O(2^mLN)$ number of quantum gates.\nHere, $m$ represents the number of qubits (e.g., 6) involved in the phase\nregister of the phase estimation algorithm.\n", "  The Standard-Model (SM) prediction for the CP-violating quantity\n$\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$ deviates from its measured value by 2.8\n$\\sigma$. It has been shown that this tension can be resolved within the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) through gluino-squark box\ndiagrams, even if squarks and gluinos are much heavier than 1 TeV. The rare\ndecays $K_L \\to \\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ and $K^+ \\to \\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ are\nsimilarly sensitive to very high mass scales and the first one also measures CP\nviolation. In this article, we analyze the correlations between\n$\\epsilon^{\\prime}_K/\\epsilon_K$ and $B(K_L \\to \\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu})$ and $B(K^+\n\\to \\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu})$ within the MSSM aiming at an explanation of\n$\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$ via gluino-squark box diagrams. The dominant\nMSSM contribution to the $K \\to \\pi\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ branching fractions stems from\nbox diagrams with squarks, sleptons, charginos, and neutralinos, and the\npattern of the correlations is different from the widely studied $Z$-penguin\nscenarios. This is interesting in light of future precision measurements by\nKOTO and NA62 at J-PARC and CERN, respectively. We find $B(K_L \\to\n\\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu})/B^{SM} (K_L \\to \\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu})\\lesssim 2\\,(1.2)$ and\n$B(K^+ \\to \\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu})/B^{SM}(K^+ \\to \\pi^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}) \\lesssim\n1.4\\,(1.1)$, if all squark masses are above 1.5 TeV, gaugino masses obey GUT\nrelations, and if one allows for a fine-tuning at the $1\\%\\,(10\\%)$ level for\nthe gluino mass. Larger values are possible for a tuned CP violating phase.\nFurthermore, the sign of the MSSM contribution to $\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}$ imposes\na strict correlation between $B(K_L \\to \\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu})$ and the hierarchy\nbetween the masses $m_{\\bar{U}}$, $m_{\\bar{D}}$ of the right-handed up-squark\nand down-squark: sgn$[B(K_L \\to \\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu})-B^{SM} (K_L \\to\n\\pi^0\\nu\\bar{\\nu})] = $sgn$(m_{\\bar{U}}-m_{\\bar{D}}) $.\n", "  We extend the idea of conformal attractors in inflation to non-canonical\nsectors by developing a non-canonical conformally invariant theory from two\ndifferent approaches. In the first approach, namely, ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity,\nthe construction is more or less phenomenological, where the non-canonical\nkinetic sector is derived from a particular form of the K$\\ddot{a}$hler\npotential respecting shift symmetry. In the second approach i.e.,\nsuperconformal theory, we derive the form of the Lagrangian from a\nsuperconformal action and it turns out to be exactly of the same form as in the\nfirst approach. Conformal breaking of these theories results in a new class of\nnon-canonical models which can govern inflation with modulated shape of the\nT-models. We further employ this framework to explore inflationary\nphenomenology with a representative example and show how the form of the\nK$\\ddot{a}$hler potential can possibly be constrained in non-canonical models\nusing the latest confidence contour in the $n_s-r$ plane given by Planck.\n", "  We reveal a class of three-dimensional $d$-orbital topological materials in\nthe antifluorite Cu$_2$S family. Derived from the unique properties of\nlow-energy $t_{2g}$ states, their phases are solely determined by the sign of\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC): topological insulator for negative SOC, whereas\ntopological semimetal for positive SOC; both having Dirac-cone surface states\nbut with contrasting helicities. With broken inversion symmetry, the semimetal\nbecomes one with a nodal box consisting of butterfly-shaped nodal lines that\nare robust against SOC. Further breaking the tetrahedral symmetry by strain\nleads to an ideal Weyl semimetal with four pairs of Weyl points. Interestingly,\nthe Fermi arcs coexist with a surface Dirac cone on the (010) surface, as\nrequired by a $Z_2$-invariant.\n", "  Borophene is a monolayer materials made of boron. A perfect planar boropehene\ncalled $\\beta_{12}$ borophene has Dirac cones and they are well reproduced by a\ntight-binding model according to recent experimental and first-principles\ncalculation results. We explicitly derive a Dirac theory for them. Dirac cones\nare gapless when the inversion symmetry exists, while they are gapped when it\nis broken. In addition, three-band touching points emerge together with\npseudospin triplet fermions when all transfer energy is equal and all on-site\nenergy is equal. The three-band touching is slightly resolved otherwise. We\nconstruct effective three-band theories for triplet fermions. We also study the\nedge states of borophene nanoribbons, which show various behaviors depending on\nthe way of edge terminations.\n", "  A further argument is provided in the discussion on the correct form of the\nbound-state momentum wave function of the quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen atom;\nnamely, considering its behavior at the large quantum indices, it is\nreconfirmed that the complex expression from Olendski (2017) {\\it Eur. J.\nPhys.} {\\bf 38} 038001 is a correct one. Groundlessness of other\ninterpretations is also highlighted.\n", "  We investigate the spin interaction and the gravitational radiation thermally\nallowed in a head-on collision of two rotating Hayward black holes. The Hayward\nblack hole is a regular black hole in a modified Einstein equation, and hence\nit can be an appropriate model to describe the extent to which the regularity\neffect in the near-horizon region affects the interaction and the radiation. If\none black hole is assumed to be considerably smaller than the other, the\npotential of the spin interaction can be analytically obtained and is dependent\non the alignment of angular momenta of the black holes. For the collision of\nmassive black holes, the gravitational radiation is numerically obtained as the\nupper bound by using the laws of thermodynamics. The effect of the Hayward\nblack hole tends to increase the radiation energy, but we can limit the effect\nby comparing the radiation energy with the gravitational waves GW150914 and\nGW151226.\n", "  Dynamical dark energy has been recently suggested as a promising and physical\nway to solve the 3.4 sigma tension on the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$\nbetween the direct measurement of Riess et al. (2016) (R16, hereafter) and the\nindirect constraint from Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies obtained by the Planck\nsatellite under the assumption of a $\\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, by\nparameterizing dark energy evolution using the $w_0$-$w_a$ approach, and\nconsidering a $12$ parameter extended scenario, we find that: a) the tension on\nthe Hubble constant can indeed be solved with dynamical dark energy, b) a\ncosmological constant is ruled out at more than $95 \\%$ c.l. by the Planck+R16\ndataset, and c) all of the standard quintessence and half of the \"downward\ngoing\" dark energy model space (characterized by an equation of state that\ndecreases with time) is also excluded at more than $95 \\%$ c.l. These results\nare further confirmed when cosmic shear, CMB lensing, or SN~Ia luminosity\ndistance data are also included. However, tension remains with the BAO dataset.\nA cosmological constant and small portion of the freezing quintessence models\nare still in agreement with the Planck+R16+BAO dataset at between 68\\% and 95\\%\nc.l. Conversely, for Planck plus a phenomenological $H_0$ prior, both thawing\nand freezing quintessence models prefer a Hubble constant of less than 70\nkm/s/Mpc. The general conclusions hold also when considering models with\nnon-zero spatial curvature.\n", "  We show that in parametric down-conversion the coherence properties of a\ntemporally partially coherent pump field get entirely transferred to the\ndown-converted entangled two-photon field. Under the assumption that the\nfrequency-bandwidth of the down-converted signal-idler photons is much larger\nthan that of the pump, we derive the temporal coherence functions for the\ndown-converted field, for both infinitely-fast and time-averaged detection\nschemes. We show that in each scheme the coherence function factorizes into two\nseparate coherence functions with one of them carrying the entire statistical\ninformation of the pump field. In situations in which the pump is a Gaussian\nSchell-model field, we derive explicit expressions for the coherence functions.\nFinally, we show that the concurrence of time-energy-entangled two-qubit states\nis bounded by the degree of temporal coherence of the pump field. This study\ncan have important implications for understanding how correlations of the pump\nfield manifest as two-particle entanglement as well as for harnessing\nenergy-time entanglement for long-distance quantum communication protocols.\n", "  Artificial molecular machines are often driven by the periodic variation of\nan external parameter. This external control exerts work on the system of which\na part can be extracted as output if the system runs against an applied load.\nUsually, the thermodynamic cost of the process that generates the external\ncontrol is ignored. Here, we derive a refined second law for such small\nmachines that include this cost, which is, for example, generated by free\nenergy consumption of a chemical reaction that modifies the energy landscape\nfor such a machine. In the limit of irreversible control, this refined second\nlaw becomes the standard one. Beyond this ideal limiting case, our analysis\nshows that due to a new entropic term unexpected regimes can occur: The control\nwork can be smaller than the extracted work and the work required to generate\nthe control can be smaller than this control work. Our general inequalities are\nillustrated by a paradigmatic three-state system.\n", "  We compare theoretical results for electron spin resonance (ESR) properties\nof the Heisenberg-Ising Hamiltonian with ESR experiments on the\nquasi-one-dimensional magnet Cu(py)$_2$Br$_2$ (CPB). Our measurements were\nperformed over a wide frequency and temperature range giving insight into spin\ndynamics, spin structure, and magnetic anisotropy of this compound. By\nanalyzing the angular dependence of ESR parameters (resonance shift and\nlinewidth) at room temperature we show that the two weakly coupled inequivalent\nspin chain types inside the compound are well described by Heisenberg-Ising\nchains with their magnetic anisotropy axes perpendicular to the chain direction\nand almost perpendicular to each other. We further determine the full\n$g$-tensor from these data. In addition, the angular dependence of the\nlinewidth at high temperatures gives us access to the exponent of the algebraic\ndecay of a dynamical correlation function of the isotropic Heisenberg chain.\nFrom the temperature dependence of static susceptibilities we extract the\nstrength of the exchange coupling ($J/k_B = 52.0\\,\\text{K}$) and the anisotropy\nparameter ($\\delta\\approx -0.02$) of the model Hamiltonian. An independent\ncompatible value of $\\delta$ is obtained by comparing the exact prediction for\nthe resonance shift at low temperatures with high-frequency ESR data recorded\nat $4\\,\\text{K}$. The spin structure in the ordered state implied by the two\n(almost) perpendicular anisotropy axes is in accordance with the propagation\nvector determined from neutron scattering experiments. In addition to undoped\nsamples we study the impact of partial substitution of Br by Cl ions on spin\ndynamics. From the dependence of the ESR linewidth on doping level we infer an\neffective decoupling of the anisotropic component $J\\delta$ from the isotropic\nexchange $J$ in these systems.\n", "  This paper addresses maximum likelihood (ML) estimation based model fitting\nin the context of extrasolar planet detection. This problem is featured by the\nfollowing properties: 1) the candidate models under consideration are highly\nnonlinear; 2) the likelihood surface has a huge number of peaks; 3) the\nparameter space ranges in size from a few to dozens of dimensions. These\nproperties make the ML search a very challenging problem, as it lacks any\nanalytical or gradient based searching solution to explore the parameter space.\nA population based searching method, called estimation of distribution\nalgorithm (EDA), is adopted to explore the model parameter space starting from\na batch of random locations. EDA is featured by its ability to reveal and\nutilize problem structures. This property is desirable for characterizing the\ndetections. However, it is well recognized that EDAs can not scale well to\nlarge scale problems, as it consists of iterative random sampling and model\nfitting procedures, which results in the well-known dilemma curse of\ndimensionality. A novel mechanism to perform EDAs in interactive random\nsubspaces spanned by correlated variables is proposed and the hope is to\nalleviate the curse of dimensionality for EDAs by performing the operations of\nsampling and model fitting in lower dimensional subspaces. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed algorithm is verified via both benchmark numerical studies and\nreal data analysis.\n", "  This thesis deals with the problem of singularities in a family of extensions\nof General Relativity in the Metric-Affine formalism. I introduce the\nMetric-Affine formalism as a framework in which study extensions of GR. I\nreview its features and motivate it through its application in Bravais\ncrystals, where ideal crystals can be described through Riemannian formalism,\nbut a crystal with defects have to be described with in terms of an independent\nconnection. The simplest way to construct solutions different from GR in this\nformalism is to take a quadratic gravity lagrangian with an electrovacuum\nstress-energy tensor. This way, charged black hole solutions are obtained.\n  The geometry of these new charged black hole solutions is analysed. Far from\nthe sources, the geometry of these new solutions is equal to the GR one up to\n$1/r^4$ corrections. However, instead of a central singularity, they have a\nwormhole structure, which can be completely regular or where the curvature\nscalars diverge, depending on the mass and charge of the black hole. I study\nthe geodesics around the wormhole throat and conclude that the geodesics are\nalways complete even in the case of a curvature divergence. To analyse in more\ndetail the geometry, I also study the evolution of a scalar wave sent towards\nthe wormhole. The evolution is shown to be regular and I calculate the\ntransmission coefficients and transmission cross section for a naked wormhole.\n  Finally, I study the same case for a Born-Infeld lagrangian in an arbitrary\nnumber of dimension ($d>4$). In this setting, the wormhole structure is also\npresent and the geodesics are still complete, therefore showing that the\nmetric-affine formalism can resolve singularities for a variety of models, and\nis not a particular feature of the quadratic Lagrangian for $d=4$.\n", "  This work is dedicated to the study of the discrete version of the\nMaier-Saupe model in the presence of competing interactions. The competition\nbetween interactions favoring different orientational ordering produces a rich\nphase diagram including modulated phases. Using a mean-field approach and Monte\nCarlo simulations, we show that the proposed model exhibits isotropic and\nnematic phases and also a series of modulated phases that meet at a\nmulticritical point, a Lifshitz point. Though the Monte Carlo and mean-field\nphase diagrams show some quantitative disagreements, the Monte Carlo\nsimulations corroborate the general behavior found within the mean-field\napproximation.\n", "  Surface energies play a dominant role in the self-assembly of three\ndimensional (3D) nanostructures. In this letter, we show that using surfactants\nto modify surface energies can provide a means to externally control\nnanostructure self-assembly, enabling the synthesis of novel hierarchical\nnanostructures. We explore Bi as a surfactant in the growth of InAs on the\n{1-10} sidewall facets of GaAs nanowires. The presence of surface Bi induces\nthe formation of InAs 3D islands by a process resembling the Stranski-Krastanov\nmechanism, which does not occur in the absence of Bi on these surfaces. The\nInAs 3D islands nucleate at the corners of the {1-10} facets above a critical\nshell thickness and then elongate along <110> directions in the plane of the\nnanowire sidewalls. Exploiting this growth mechanism, we realize a series of\nnovel hierarchical nanostructures, ranging from InAs quantum dots on single\n{1-10} nanowire facets to zig-zag shaped nanorings completely encircling\nnanowire cores. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence spectral\nline scans reveal that small surfactant-induced InAs 3D islands behave as\noptically active quantum dots. This work illustrates how surfactants can\nprovide an unprecedented level of external control over nanostructure\nself-assembly.\n", "  We study the thermoelectric DC conductivities of Horndeski holographic models\nwith momentum dissipation. We compute the butterfly velocity $v_B$ and we\ndiscuss the existence of universal bounds on charge and energy diffusivities in\nthe incoherent limit related to quantum chaos. We find that the Horndeski\ncoupling represents a subleading contribution to the thermoelectric\nconductivities in the incoherent limit and therefore it does not affect any of\nthe proposed bounds.\n", "  We demonstrate a fiber system which amplifies and compresses pulses from a\ngain-switched diode. A Mamyshev regenerator shortens the pulses and improves\ntheir coherence, enabling subsequent amplification by parabolic pre-shaping. As\na result, we are able to control nonlinear effects and generate nearly\ntransform-limited, 140-fs pulses with 13-MW peak power---an order-of-magnitude\nimprovement over previous gain-switched diode sources. Seeding with a\ngain-switched diode results in random fluctuations of 2% in the pulse energy,\nwhich future work using known techniques may ameliorate. Further development\nmay allow such systems to compete directly with sources based on modelocked\noscillators in some applications while enjoying unparalleled robustness and\nrepetition rate control.\n", "  Ground-state and finite-temperature properties of $S=1/2$ Heisenberg ladders\nwith a ferromagnetic leg, an antiferromagnetic leg, and antiferromagnetic rungs\nare studied. It is shown that a partial ferrimagnetic phase extends over a wide\nparameter range in the ground state. The numerical results are supported by an\nanalytical calculation based on a mapping onto the nonlinear $\\sigma$ model and\na perturbation calculation from the strong-rung limit. It is shown that the\npartial ferrimagnetic state is a spontaneously magnetized Tomonaga--Luttinger\nliquid with incommensurate magnetic correlation, which is confirmed by a DMRG\ncalculation. The finite-temperature magnetic susceptibility is calculated using\nthe thermal pure quantum state method. It is suggested that the susceptibility\ndiverges as $T^{-2}$ in the ferrimagnetic phases as in the case of\nferromagnetic Heisenberg chains.\n", "  We investigate statistical properties of trails formed by a random process\nincorporating aggregation, fragmentation, and diffusion. In this stochastic\nprocess, which takes place in one spatial dimension, two neighboring trails may\ncombine to form a larger one and also, one trail may split into two. In\naddition, trails move diffusively. The model is defined by two parameters which\nquantify the fragmentation rate and the fragment size. In the long-time limit,\nthe system reaches a steady state, and our focus is the limiting distribution\nof trail weights. We find that the density of trail weight has power-law tail\n$P(w) \\sim w^{-\\gamma}$ for small weight $w$. We obtain the exponent $\\gamma$\nanalytically, and find that it varies continuously with the two model\nparameters. The exponent $\\gamma$ can be positive or negative, so that in one\nrange of parameters small-weight tails are abundant, and in the complementary\nrange, they are rare.\n", "  In the tensor-network framework, the expectation values of two-dimensional\nquantum states are evaluated by contracting a double-layer tensor network\nconstructed from initial and final tensor-network states. The computational\ncost of carrying out this contraction is generally very high, which limits the\nlargest bond dimension of tensor-network states that can be accurately studied\nto a relatively small value. We propose an optimized contraction scheme to\nsolve this problem by mapping the double-layer tensor network onto an\nintersected single-layer tensor network. This reduces greatly the bond\ndimensions of local tensors to be contracted and improves dramatically the\nefficiency and accuracy of the evaluation of expectation values of\ntensor-network states. It almost doubles the largest bond dimension of\ntensor-network states whose physical properties can be efficiently and reliably\ncalculated, and it extends significantly the application scope of\ntensor-network methods.\n", "  The stochastic $R$ matrix for $U_q(A^{(1)}_n)$ introduced recently gives rise\nto an integrable zero range process of $n$ classes of particles in one\ndimension. For $n=2$ we investigate how finitely many first class particles\nfixed as defects influence the grand canonical ensemble of the second class\nparticles. By using the matrix product stationary probabilities involving\ninfinite products of $q$-bosons, exact formulas are derived for the local\ndensity and current of the second class particles in the large volume limit.\n", "  In this paper, we summarize the development of the concept of emergence in\nphysical science and propose key concepts of emergence in the form of\nconjectures. Our conjectures are threefold: I. A system having a\nbroken-symmetry in membership relation with respect to micro and macro scales\ncan have emergent properties. II. Spontaneous symmetry-breaking is an example\nof an emergent property. III. The phenomenon of hysteresis accompanies\nspontaneous symmetry-breaking. We argue that these conjectures and their\nrelationship can illuminate the concept of emergence from the perspective of\nsymmetry breaking.\n", "  The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation provides a simple mathematical model of cardiac\ntissue as an excitable medium hosting spiral wave vortices. Here we present\nextensive numerical simulations studying long-term dynamics of knotted vortex\nstring solutions for all torus knots up to crossing number 11. We demonstrate\nthat FitzHugh-Nagumo evolution preserves the knot topology for all the examples\npresented, thereby providing a novel field theory approach to the study of\nknots. Furthermore, the evolution yields a well-defined minimal length for each\nknot that is comparable to the ropelength of ideal knots. We highlight the role\nof the medium boundary in stabilizing the length of the knot and discuss the\nimplications beyond torus knots. By applying Moffatt's test we are able to show\nthat there is not a unique attractor within a given knot topology.\n", "  We address the problem of whether parties who cannot communicate but share\nnonsignaling quantum correlations between the outcomes of sharp measurements\ncan distinguish, just from the value of a correlation observable, whether their\noutcomes were produced by sequential compatible measurements on single systems\nor by measurements on spatially separated subsystems. We show that there are\nquantum correlations between the outcomes of sequential measurements which\ncannot be attained with spatially separated systems. We present examples of\ncorrelations between spatially separated systems whose quantum maximum tends to\nthe sequential maximum as the number of parties increases and examples of\ncorrelations between spatially separated systems whose quantum maximum fails to\nviolate the noncontextual bound while its corresponding sequential version\ndoes.\n", "  We present experimental results of transverse electron focusing measurements\nperformed on an n-type GaAs based mesoscopic device consisting of\none-dimensional (1D) quantum wires as injector and detector. We show that\nnon-adiabatic injection of 1D electrons at a conductance of e$^2$/h results in\na single first focusing peak, which on gradually increasing the injector\nconductance up to 2e$^2$/h , produces asymmetric two sub-peaks in the first\nfocusing peak, each sub-peak representing the population of spin-state arising\nfrom the spatially separated spins in the injector. Further increasing the\nconductance flips the spin-states in the 1D channel thus reversing the\nasymmetry in the sub-peaks. On applying a source-drain bias, the spin-gap, so\nobtained, can be resolved thus providing evidence of exchange interaction\ninduced spin polarisation in the 1D systems.\n", "  We develop a formalism to analytically describe the clustering of matter in\nthe mildly non-linear regime in the presence of massive neutrinos. Neutrinos,\nwhose free streaming wavenumber ($k_{\\rm fs}$) is typically longer than the\nnon-linear scale ($k_{\\rm NL}$) are described by a Boltzmann equation coupled\nto the effective fluid-like equations that describe dark matter. We solve the\nequations expanding in the neutrino density fraction $(f_\\nu)$ and in $k/\nk_{\\rm NL}$, and add suitable counterterms to renormalize the theory. This\nallows us to describe the contribution of short distances to long-distance\nobservables. Equivalently, we construct an effective Boltzmann equation where\nwe add additional terms whose coefficients renormalize the contribution from\nshort-distance physics. We argue that neutrinos with $k_{\\rm fs}\\gtrsim k_{\\rm\nNL}$ require an additional counterterm similar to the speed of sound ($c_s$)\nfor dark matter. We compute the one-loop total-matter power spectrum, and find\nthat it is roughly equal to $16f_\\nu$ times the dark matter one for $k$'s\nlarger that the typical $k_{\\rm fs}$. It is about half of that for smaller\n$k$'s. The leading contribution results from the back-reaction of the neutrinos\non the dynamics of the dark matter. The counterterms contribute in a\nhierarchical way: the leading ones can either be computed in terms of $c_s$, or\ncan be accounted for by shifting $c_s$ by an amount proportional to $f_\\nu$.\n", "  We propose to create a secondary beam of neutral kaons in Hall D at Jefferson\nLab to be used with the GlueX experimental setup for strange hadron\nspectroscopy. A flux on the order of 3 x 10^4 KL/s will allow a broad range of\nmeasurements to be made by improving the statistics of previous data obtained\non hydrogen targets by three orders of magnitude. Use of a deuteron target will\nprovide first measurements on the neutron which is {\\it terra incognita}.\n  The experiment will measure both differential cross sections and\nself-analyzed polarizations of the produced {\\Lambda}, {\\Sigma}, {\\Xi}, and\n{\\Omega} hyperons using the GlueX detector at the Jefferson Lab Hall D. The\nmeasurements will span c.m. cos{\\theta} from -0.95 to 0.95 in the c.m. range\nabove W = 1490 MeV and up to 3500 MeV. These new GlueX data will greatly\nconstrain partial-wave analyses and reduce model-dependent uncertainties in the\nextraction of strange resonance properties (including pole positions), and\nprovide a new benchmark for comparisons with QCD-inspired models and lattice\nQCD calculations.\n  The proposed facility will also have an impact in the strange meson sector by\nproviding measurements of the final-state K{\\pi} system from threshold up to 2\nGeV invariant mass to establish and improve on the pole positions and widths of\nall K*(K{\\pi}) P-wave states as well as for the S-wave scalar meson\n{\\kappa}(800).\n", "  The recently discovered burst of gravitational waves GW150914 provides a good\nnew chance to verify the current view on the evolution of close binary stars.\nModern population synthesis codes help to study this evolution from two main\nsequence stars up to the formation of two final remnant degenerate dwarfs,\nneutron stars or black holes [Massevich 1988]. To study the evolution of the\nGW150914 predecessor we use the \"Scenario Machine\" code presented by [Lipunov\n1996]. The scenario modelling conducted in this study allowed to describe the\nevolution of systems for which the final stage is a massive BH+BH merger. We\nfind that the initial mass of the primary component can be $100\\div 140\nM_{\\odot}$ and the initial separation of the components can be $50\\div 350\nR_{\\odot}$. Our calculations show the plausibility of modern evolutionary\nscenarios for binary stars and the population synthesis modelling based on it.\n", "  Edge structure plays an essential role in the nature of electronic states in\ngraphene nanoribbons. By focusing on the interplay between this feature and\nnon-trivial topology in the domain of the Dirac confinement problem, this paper\nproposes to examine how effects associated with edge shape manifest themselves\nin conjunction with the topological signature typical of M\\\"{o}bius strips\nwithin a low-energy regime. Aiming to provide an alternative to prevailing\ntight-binding approaches, zigzag and armchair M\\\"{o}bius strips are modeled by\nproposing compatible sets of boundary conditions, prescribing profiles of\nterminations in both transverse and longitudinal directions which are\ndemonstrated to be coherent in describing consistently transverse edge patterns\nin combination with a proper M\\\"{o}bius periodicity. Of particular importance\nis the absence of constraints on the solution, in contrast with infinite mass\nanalogues, as well as an energy spectrum with a characteristic dual structure\nresponding exclusively to the parity associated with the transverse quantum\nnumber. Zigzag ribbons are predicted to possess an intrinsic mechanism for\nparity inversion, while the armchair ones carry the possibility of a coexistent\ngapless and gapped band structure. We also inspect the influence of the edge\nstructure on persistent currents. In zigzag-edged configurations they are found\nto be sensitive to a length-dependent term which behaves as an effective flux.\nArmchair rings show a quite distinctive property: alternation of constant and\nflux-dependent currents according to the width of the ring, for a fixed\ntransverse quantum number. In the flux-free case the effects of topology are\nfound to be entirely suppressed, and conventional odd and even currents become\nundistinguishable.\n", "  In this chapter, we intend to explore and review some remarkable dynamical\nproperties of quantum discord under various different open quantum system\nmodels. Specifically, our discussion will include several concepts connected to\nthe phenomena of time invariant and frozen quantum discord. Furthermore, we\nwill elaborate on the relation of these two phenomena to the non-Markovian\nfeatures of the open system dynamics and to the usage of dynamical decoupling\nprotocols.\n", "  We demonstrate, both experimentally and numerically, the mechanical rainbow\ntrapping effect and the mechanical Bloch oscillations for torsional waves\npropagating in chirped mechanical beams. After extensive simulations, three\nquasi-one-dimensional chirped structures were designed, constructed and\nexperimentally characterized by Doppler spectroscopy. When the chirp intensity\nvanishes a perfect periodic system, with bands and gaps, is obtained. The\nmechanical rainbow trapping effect occurs for small values of the chirp\nintensity. The wave packet traveling along the beam is progressively slowing\ndown and is reflected back at a certain depth, which depends on its central\nfrequency. In this case a new kind of oscillation, here named \"{\\em rectified\nrainbow-Bloch oscillation}\", appears since the wave packet is reflected at one\nside by the interface between the structure and the uniform rod and by the\nminigap at the opposite side. For larger values of the chirp parameter the\nrainbow trapping yields the penetration length where the mechanical Bloch\noscillations emerge. Numerical simulations based on the transfer matrix method\nare in agreement with experimental data.\n", "  Shape tracking of medical devices using strain sensing properties in optical\nfibers has seen increased attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose\na novel guidance system for intra-arterial procedures using a distributed\nstrain sensing device based on optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to\ntrack the shape of a catheter. Tracking enhancement is provided by exposing a\nfiber triplet to a focused ultraviolet beam, producing high scattering\nproperties. Contrary to typical quasi-distributed strain sensors, we propose a\ntruly distributed strain sensing approach, which allows to reconstruct a fiber\ntriplet in real-time. A 3D roadmap of the hepatic anatomy integrated with a 4D\nMR imaging sequence allows to navigate the catheter within the\npre-interventional anatomy, and map the blood flow velocities in the arterial\ntree. We employed Riemannian anisotropic heat kernels to map the sensed data to\nthe pre-interventional model. Experiments in synthetic phantoms and an in vivo\nmodel are presented. Results show that the tracking accuracy is suitable for\ninterventional tracking applications, with a mean 3D shape reconstruction\nerrors of 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm. This study demonstrates the promising potential of\nMR-compatible UV-exposed OFDR optical fibers for non-ionizing device guidance\nin intra-arterial procedures.\n", "  Interstellar dust shows ubiquitous interstellar infrared spectrum (IR) due to\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). By our previous quantum chemistry\ncalculation, it was suggested that a molecule group having hydrocarbon\npentagon-hexagon combined skeleton could reproduce observed IR of dust clouds\nin Milky Way galaxy. This paper extends to other many galaxies. Typical\ngalaxies are NGC6946 and M83. Those infrared spectrum were compared with that\nof a model molecule (C23H12)2+ having hydrocarbon two pentagons combined with\nfive hexagons. Observed major infrared bands of 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3\nmicrometer were successfully reproduced as 6.4, 7.7, 8.5, and 11.2 micrometer.\nEven observed weaker bands of 12.0, 12.7, 14.2 micrometer were predicted well\nby computed bands as 12.0, 12.6, and 13.9 micrometer. IR intensity ratio was\ncompared to check theoretical validity. Calculated intensity ratio between 7.7\nversus 11.3 micrometer (PAH7.7/11.3) was 4.0, whereas observed ratio was in a\nrange of 2~6, also calculated PAH6.2/11.3 was 1.4 for observed range of\n0.9~2.6. Especially, every calculated ratio was so close to that of M83 arm\nregion. It should be noted that both calculated wavelength and intensity could\nreproduce observed galaxy scale infrared spectrum. Hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon\nmolecule would be general carrier in many galaxies including Milky Way.\n", "  We study the structure of the inner Milky Way using the latest data release\nof the Vista Variables in Via Lactea (VVV) survey. The VVV is a deep\nnear-infrared, multi-colour photometric survey with a coverage of 300 square\ndegrees towards the Bulge/Bar. We use Red Clump (RC) stars to produce a\nhigh-resolution dust map of the VVV's field of view. From de-reddened\ncolour-magnitude diagrams we select Red Giant Branch stars to investigate their\n3D density distribution within the central 4 kpc. We demonstrate that our\nbest-fit parametric model of the Bulge density provides a good description of\nthe VVV data, with a median percentage residual of 5$\\%$ over the fitted\nregion. The strongest of the otherwise low-level residuals are overdensities\nassociated with a low-latitude structure as well as the so-called X-shape\npreviously identified using the split RC. These additional components\ncontribute only $\\sim5\\%$ and $\\sim7\\%$ respectively to the Bulge mass budget.\nThe best-fit Bulge is `boxy' with an axis ratio of [1:0.44:0.31] and is rotated\nwith respect to the Sun-Galactic Centre line by at least $20^{\\circ}$. We\nprovide an estimate of the total, full sky, mass of the Bulge of\n$M_\\mathrm{Bulge}^{\\mathrm{Chabrier}} = 2.36 \\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ for a\nChabrier initial mass function. We show there exists a strong degeneracy\nbetween the viewing angle and the dispersion of the Red Clump absolute\nmagnitude distribution. The value of the latter is strongly dependent on the\nassumptions made about the intrinsic luminosity function of the Bulge.\n", "  We propose and apply two methods to estimate pupil plane phase\ndiscontinuities for two realistic scenarios on VLT and Keck. The methods use\nboth Phase Diversity and a form of image sharpening. For the case of VLT, we\nsimulate the `low wind effect' (LWE) which is responsible for focal plane\nerrors in the SPHERE system in low wind and good seeing conditions. We\nsuccessfully estimate the simulated LWE using both methods, and show that they\nare complimentary to one another. We also demonstrate that single image Phase\nDiversity (also known as Phase Retrieval with diversity) is also capable of\nestimating the simulated LWE when using the natural de-focus on the SPHERE/DTTS\nimager. We demonstrate that Phase Diversity can estimate the LWE to within 30\nnm RMS WFE, which is within the allowable tolerances to achieve a target SPHERE\ncontrast of 10$^{-6}$. Finally, we simulate 153 nm RMS of piston errors on the\nmirror segments of Keck and produce NIRC2 images subject to these effects. We\nshow that a single, diverse image with 1.5 waves (PV) of focus can be used to\nestimate this error to within 29 nm RMS WFE, and a perfect correction of our\nestimation would increase the Strehl ratio of a NIRC2 image by 12\\%\n", "  Supersymmetric states in M-theory are mapped after compactification to\nperturbatively non-supersymmetric states in type IIA string theory, with the\nsupersymmetric parts being encoded in the non-perturbative section of the\nstring theory. An observer unable to recognise certain topological features of\nstring theory will not detect supersymmetry. Such relativity of symmetry can\nalso be derived in the context of Theorem 3 in ref. [11]. The tool of choice in\nthis context is the universal coefficient theorem linking cohomology theories\nwith coefficients that reveal respectively hide certain topological features.\nAs a consequence of these observations, it is shown that the same theorem is\ncapable of linking perturbative with non-perturbative string theoretical\ndomains. A discussion of inflow anomaly cancellation is also included in the\ncontext of universal coefficient theorems.\n", "  This paper discusses the synthesis, characterization, and comprehensive study\nof Ba-122 single crystals with various substitutions and various $T_c$. The\npaper uses five complementary techniques to obtain a self-consistent set of\ndata on the superconducting properties of Ba-122. A major conclusion of the\nauthors work is the coexistence of two superconducting condensates differing in\nthe electron-boson coupling strength. The two gaps that develop in distinct\nFermi surface sheets are nodeless in the $k_xk_y$-plane and exhibit s-wave\nsymmetry, the two-band model represents a sufficient data description tool. A\nmoderate interband coupling and a considerable Coulomb repulsion in the\ndescription of the two-gap superconducting state of barium pnictides favor the\n$s^{++}$-model.\n", "  High-reflectance in many state-of-the-art optical devices is achieved with\nnoble metals. However, metals are limited by losses, and for certain\napplications, by their high mass density. Using a combination of ab initio and\noptical transfer matrix calculations, we evaluate the behavior of\ngraphene-based \\AA-scale metamaterials and find that they could act as\nnearly-perfect reflectors in the mid-long wave infrared (IR) range. The low\ndensity of states for electron-phonon scattering and interband excitations\nleads to unprecedented optical properties for graphene heterostructures,\nespecially alternating atomic layers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride,\nat wavelengths greater than $10~\\mu$m. At these wavelengths, these materials\nexhibit reflectivities exceeding 99.7% at a fraction of the weight of noble\nmetals, as well as plasmonic mode confinement and quality factors that are\ngreater by an order of magnitude compared to noble metals. These findings hold\npromise for ultra-compact optical components and waveguides for mid-IR\napplications. Moreover, unlike metals, the photonic properties of these\nheterostructures could be actively tuned via chemical and/or electrostatic\ndoping, providing exciting possibilities for tunable devices.\n", "  We show that the propagation of transverse electric (TE) polarized waves in\none dimensional inhomogeneous settings can be written in the form of the Dirac\nequation in one space dimension with a Lorentz scalar potential, and\nconsequently perform photonic simulations of the Dirac equation in optical\nstructures. In particular, we propose how the zero energy state of the\nJackiw-Rebbi model can be implemented in a optical set up by controlling the\nrefractive index landscape, where TE polarized waves mimic the Dirac particles\nand the soliton field can be implemented and tuned by adjusting the refractive\nindex.\n", "  Diffusion and rectification of Brownian particles powered by a rotating wheel\nare numerically investigated in a two-dimensional channel. The nonequilibrium\ndriving comes from the rotating wheel, which can break thermodynamical\nequilibrium and induce the directed transport in an asymmetric potential. It is\nfound that the direction of the transport along the potential is determined by\nthe asymmetry of the potential and the position of the wheel. The average\nvelocity is a peaked function of the angular speed (or the diffusion\ncoefficient) and the position of the peak shifts to large angular speed(or\ndiffusion coefficient) when the diffusion coefficient (or the angular speed)\nincreases. There exists an optimal angular speed (or diffusion coefficient) at\nwhich the effective diffusion coefficient takes its maximal value. Remarkably,\nthe giant acceleration of diffusion is observed by suitably adjusting the\nsystem parameters. The parameters corresponding to the maximum effective\ndiffusion coefficient are not the same as the parameters at which average\nvelocity is maximum.\n", "  A joint analysis of data collected by the Planck and BICEP2+Keck teams has\npreviously given $r = 0.09^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ for BICEP2 and $r =\n0.02^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ for Keck. Analyzing BICEP2 using its published noise\nestimate, we had earlier (Colley & Gott 2015) found $r = 0.09 \\pm 0.04$,\nagreeing with the final joint results for BICEP2. With the Keck data now\navailable, we have done something the joint analysis did not: a correlation\nstudy of the BICEP2 vs. Keck B-mode maps. Knowing the correlation coefficient\nbetween the two and their amplitudes allows us to determine the noise in each\nmap (which we check using the E-modes). We find the noise power in the BICEP2\nmap to be twice the original BICEP2 published estimate, explaining the\nanomalously high $r$ value obtained by BICEP2. We now find $r = 0.004 \\pm 0.04$\nfor BICEP2 and $r = -0.01 \\pm 0.04$ for Keck. Since $r \\ge 0$ by definition,\nthis implies a maximum likelihood value of $r = 0$, or no evidence for\ngravitational waves. Starobinsky Inflation ($r = 0.0036$) is not ruled out,\nhowever. Krauss & Wilzcek (2014) have already argued that \"measurement of\npolarization of the CMB due to a long-wavelength stochastic background of\ngravitational waves from Inflation in the early Universe would firmly establish\nthe quantization of gravity,\" and, therefore, the existence of gravitons. We\nargue it would also constitute a detection of gravitational Hawking radiation\n(explicitly from the causal horizons due to Inflation).\n", "  Majorana bound states in topological Josephson junctions induce a 4? period\ncurrent-phase relation. Direct detection of the 4? periodicity is complicated\nby the quasiparticle poisoning. We reveal that Majorana bound states are also\nsignaled by the anomalous enhancement on the critical current of the junction.\nWe show the landscape of the critical current for a nanowire Josephson junction\nunder a varying Zeeman field, and reveal a sharp step feature at the\ntopological quantum phase transition point, which comes from the anomalous\nenhancement of the critical current at the topological regime. In multi-band\nwires, the anomalous enhancement disappears for an even number of bands, where\nthe Majorana bound states fuse into Andreev bound states. This anomalous\ncritical current enhancement directly signals the existence of the Majorana\nbound states, and also provides a valid signature for the topological quantum\nphase transition.\n", "  Porous materials provide a large surface to volume ratio, thereby providing a\nknob to alter fundamental properties in unprecedented ways. In thermal\ntransport, porous nanomaterials can reduce thermal conductivity by not only\nenhancing phonon scattering from the boundaries of the pores and therefore\ndecreasing the phonon mean free path, but also by reducing the phonon group\nvelocity. Here we establish a structure-property relationship by measuring the\nporosity and thermal conductivity of individual electrolessly etched single\ncrystalline silicon nanowires using a novel electron beam heating technique.\nSuch porous silicon nanowires exhibit extremely low diffusive thermal\nconductivity (as low as 0.33 Wm-1K-1 at 300K for 43% porosity), even lower than\nthat of amorphous silicon. The origin of such ultralow thermal conductivity is\nunderstood as a reduction in the phonon group velocity, experimentally verified\nby measuring the Young modulus, as well as the smallest structural size ever\nreported in crystalline Silicon (less than 5nm). Molecular dynamics simulations\nsupport the observation of a drastic reduction in thermal conductivity of\nsilicon nanowires as a function of porosity. Such porous materials provide an\nintriguing platform to tune phonon transport, which can be useful in the design\nof functional materials towards electronics and nano-electromechanical systems.\n", "  In this paper we study the proposal present in \\cite{1} concerning the\nstatistical description of trapped gravitons and applied to derive the\nsemi-classical black hole (BH) entropy $S_{BH}$. We study the possible\nconfigurations depending on physically reasonable expressions for the internal\nenergy $U$. In particular, we show that expressions for $U\\sim R^k, k\\geq 1$,\nwith $R$ the radius of the confining spherical box, can have a semi-classical\ndescription, while behaviors with $k<1$ derive from thermodynamic or quantum\nfluctuations. There, by taking a suitable physically motivated expression for\n$U(R)$, we obtain the well known logarithmic corrections to the BH entropy,\nwith the usual behaviors present in the literature of BH entropy. Moreover, a\nphase transition emerges with a positive specific heat $C$ at Planckian lengths\ninstead of the usual negative oneat non-Planckian scales, in agreement with\nresults present in the literature. Finally, we show that evaporation stops at a\nradius $R$ of the order of the Planck length.\n", "  We propose a method to improve the performance of two-way continuous-variable\nquantum key distribution protocol by virtual photon subtraction. The Virtual\nphoton subtraction implemented via non-Gaussian post-selection not only\nenhances the entanglement of two-mode squeezed vacuum state but also has\nadvantages in simplifying physical operation and promoting efficiency. In\ntwo-way protocol, virtual photon subtraction could be applied on two sources\nindependently. Numerical simulations show that the optimal performance of\nrenovated two-way protocol is obtained with photon subtraction only used by\nAlice. The transmission distance and tolerable excess noise are improved by\nusing the virtual photon subtraction with appropriate parameters. Moreover, the\ntolerable excess noise maintains a high value with the increase of distance so\nthat the robustness of two-way continuous-variable quantum key distribution\nsystem is significantly improved, especially at long transmission distance.\n", "  Separatism is examined in a long-run perspective. Accordingly, many political\nor economic factors which may be crucial in dealing with short-term episodes\ncan be safely disregarded. Extending an approach pioneered by J. Jenkins, the\npaper assesses the role of spatial and historical factors. It shows that the\nmeans used to stage a separatist struggle are to a notable extent borrowed from\nformer historical episodes, an analysis which supports and illustrates Charles\nTilly's thesis of restricted repertoires of action. The purpose of the present\npaper is to introduce the model, to make it plausible and to demonstrate its\npotential usefulness by examining a number of critical examples. A more\nsystematic analysis is carried out in a follow-up paper by using a data set\nthat includes about 40 cases of separatist struggles.\n", "  In part 1 we have discussed the role played by geographical and historical\nconditions. Here we wish to test our model and to estimate its parameters. Ti\nthis effect two indexes are introduced. The geographical index is aimed at\ncharacterizing the degree of separateness of a given region with respect to the\nnational state to which it belongs. This index turns out to be closely\nconnected to the number of minority-speakers; it is also correlated with the\nlevel of separatist disturbances, at least for samples having the same\nhistorical background. The purpose of the second index is precisely to specify\nthe role of past episodes in shaping current separatist outbreaks. To a large\nextent, current episodes are modeled on former ones; typically this process of\nsemi-replication appears to be characterized by a \"memory\" that extends over at\nleast one and a half century. Note that this study concentrates on the\noccurrence and forms of separatist struggles rather than on their short-term\npolitical causes. In so doing, it follows a methodological track that has been\npioneered by Stanley Lieberson (1985, the \"stardom\" paradigm) and Charles Tilly\n(1993, the \"traffic jam\" paradigm).\n", "  Wave propagation in architectured materials, or materials with\nmicrostructure, is known to be dependent on the ratio between the wavelength\nand a characteristic size of the microstructure. Indeed, when this ratio\ndecreases (i.e. when the wavelength approaches this characteristic size)\nimportant quantities, such as phase and group velocity, deviate considerably\nfrom their low frequency/long wavelength values. This well-known phenomenon is\ncalled dispersion of waves. Objective of this work is to show that\nstrain-gradient elasticity can be used to quantitatively describe the behaviour\nof a microstructured solid, and that the validity domain (in terms of frequency\nand wavelength) of this model is sufficiently large to be useful in practical\napplications. To this end, the parameters of the overall continuum are\nidentified for a periodic architectured material, and the results of a\ntransient problem are compared to those obtained from a finite element full\nfield computation on the real geometry. The quality of the overall description\nusing a strain-gradient elastic continuum is compared to the classical\nhomogenization procedure that uses Cauchy continuum. The extended model of\nelasticity is shown to provide a good approximation of the real solution over a\nwider frequency range.\n", "  In this paper, the flavor structure of quark and lepton EDMs in the SM and\nbeyond is investigated using tools inspired from Minimal Flavor Violation.\nWhile Jarlskog-like flavor invariants are adequate for estimating CP-violation\nfrom closed fermion loops, non-invariant structures arise from rainbow-like\nprocesses. Our goal is to systematically construct these latter flavor\nstructures in the quark and lepton sectors, assuming different mechanisms for\ngenerating neutrino masses. Numerically, they are found typically much larger,\nand not necessarily correlated with, Jarlskog-like invariants. Finally, the\nformalism is adapted to deal with a third class of flavor structures, sensitive\nto the flavored U(1) phases, and used to study the impact of the strong\nCP-violating interaction and the interplay between the neutrino Majorana phases\nand possible baryon and/or lepton number violating interactions.\n", "  We collect observational evidence that supports the scheme of mass transfer\non the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The obliquity of the\nrotation axis of 67P causes strong seasonal variations. During perihelion the\nsouthern hemisphere is four times more active than the north. Northern\nterritories are widely covered by granular material that indicates back fall\noriginating from the active south. Decimetre sized chunks contain water ice and\ntheir trajectories are influenced by an anti-solar force instigated by\nsublimation. OSIRIS observations suggest that up to 20 % of the particles\ndirectly return to the nucleus surface taking several hours of travel time. The\nback fall covered northern areas are active if illuminated but produce mainly\nwater vapour. The decimetre chunks from the nucleus surface are too small to\ncontain more volatile compounds such as CO 2 or CO. This causes a north-south\ndichotomy of the composition measurements in the coma. Active particles are\ntrapped in the gravitational minimum of Hapi during northern winter. They are\n\"shock frozen\" and only reactivated when the comet approaches the sun after its\naphelion passage. The insolation of the big cavity is enhanced by self-heating,\ni. e. reflection and IR radiation from the walls. This, together with the\npristinity of the active back fall, explains the early observed activity of the\nHapi region. Sobek may be a role model for the consolidated bottom of Hapi.\nMass transfer in the case of 67P strongly influences the evolution of the\nnucleus and the interpretation of coma measurements.\n", "  SuperNEMO is a double-$\\beta$ decay experiment, which will employ the\nsuccessful tracker-calorimeter technique used in the recently completed NEMO-3\nexperiment. SuperNEMO will implement 100 kg of double-$\\beta$ decay isotope,\nreaching a sensitivity to the neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay\n($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) half-life of the order of $10^{26}$ yr, corresponding to a\nMajorana neutrino mass of 50-100 meV. One of the main goals and challenges of\nthe SuperNEMO detector development programme has been to reach a calorimeter\nenergy resolution, $\\Delta$E/E, around 3%/$sqrt(E)$(MeV) $\\sigma$, or\n7%/$sqrt(E)$(MeV) FWHM (full width at half maximum), using a calorimeter\ncomposed of large volume plastic scintillator blocks coupled to photomultiplier\ntubes. We describe the R\\&D programme and the final design of the SuperNEMO\ncalorimeter that has met this challenging goal.\n", "  Platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is an exciting new member of the two-dimensional\n(2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family. it has a semimetal to\nsemiconductor transition when approaching monolayer thickness and has already\nshown significant potential for use in device applications. Notably, PtSe2 can\nbe grown at low temperature making it potentially suitable for industrial\nusage. Here, we address thickness dependent transport properties and\ninvestigate electrical contacts to PtSe2, a crucial and universal element of\nTMD-based electronic devices. PtSe2 films have been synthesized at various\nthicknesses and structured to allow contact engineering and the accurate\nextraction of electrical properties. Contact resistivity and sheet resistance\nextracted from transmission line method (TLM) measurements are compared for\ndifferent contact metals and different PtSe2 film thicknesses. Furthermore, the\ntransition from semimetal to semiconductor in PtSe2 has been indirectly\nverified by electrical characterization of field-effect devices. Finally, the\ninfluence of edge contacts at the metal - PtSe2 interface has been studied by\nnanostructuring the contact area using electron beam lithography. By increasing\nthe edge contact length, the contact resistivity was improved by up to 70%\ncompared to devices with conventional top contacts. The results presented here\nrepresent crucial steps towards realizing high-performance nanoelectronic\ndevices based on group-10 TMDs.\n", "  We study in detail a new model of quintessential inflation where the inflaton\nfield is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. This coupling ensures that the\nvariation of the field is kept sub-Planckian, which avoids the 5th force\nproblem as well as the lifting of the flatness of the quintessential tail in\nthe runaway scalar potential due to radiative corrections. We find that the\ninflationary predictions of the model are in excellent agreement with CMB\nobservations, while the coincidence requirement of dark energy is satisfied\nwith natural values of the parameters, overcoming thereby the extreme\nfine-tuning of the cosmological constant in $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  We argue that Ti4+ is not a realistic description of Ti in TiO2.\n", "  The elastoplastic behavior of a two-phase stainless steel alloy is explored\nat the crystal scale for five levels of stress biaxiality. The crystal lattice\n(elastic) strains were measured with neutron diffraction using tubular samples\nsubjected to different combinations of axial load and internal pressure to\nachieve a range of biaxial stress ratios. Finite element simulations were\nconducted on virtual polycrystals using loading histories that mimicked the\nexperimental protocols. For this, two-phase microstructures were instantiated\nbased on microscopy images of the grain and phase topologies and on\ncrystallographic orientation distributions from neutron diffraction. Detailed\ncomparisons were made between the measured and computed lattice strains for\nseveral crystal reflections in both phases for scattering vectors in the axial,\nradial and hoop directions that confirm the model's ability to accurate predict\nthe evolving local stress states. A strength-to-stiffness parameter for\nmultiaxial stress states was applied to explain the initiation of yielding\nacross the polycrystalline samples across the five levels of stress biaxiality.\nFinally, building off the multiaxial strength-to-stiffness, the propagation of\nyielding over the volume of a polycrystal was estimated in terms of an equation\nthat provides the local stress necessary to initiate within crystals in terms\nof the macroscopic stress.\n", "  The Kelvin Water Dropper was discovered by Lord Kelvin in 1867 and it works\non the principle of electrostatic induction. A working model of Kelvin Water\nDropper is fabricated in the workshop facility of Physical Research Laboratory,\nAhmedabad. We, for the first time, performed a quantitative measurement of the\ntemporal development of charge using a new method that we call \"Effective\nCapacitance method\". With this, the Kelvin Water Dropper experiment can be\nintroduced in undergraduate curriculum, where students can perform quantitative\nmeasurements with the apparatus using our \"Effective Capacitance method\". This\nshould change the generally held view of Kelvin water dropper as being an\nentertaining toy to a mature educational device.\n", "  This note contains a new characterization of modulation spaces\n$M^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, $1\\leq p\\leq \\infty$, by symplectic rotations. Precisely,\ninstead to measure the time-frequency content of a function by using\ntranslations and modulations of a fixed window as building blocks, we use\ntranslations and metaplectic operators corresponding to symplectic rotations.\nTechnically, this amounts to replace, in the computation of the\n$M^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$-norm, the integral in the time-frequency plane with an\nintegral on $\\mathbb{R}^n\\times U(2n,\\mathbb{R})$ with respect to a suitable\nmeasure, $U(2n,\\mathbb{R})$ being the group of symplectic rotations. More\nconceptually, we are considering a sort of polar coordinates in the\ntime-frequency plane. In this new framework, the Gaussian invariance under\nsymplectic rotations yields to choose Gaussians as suitable window functions.\nWe also provide a similar characterization with the group $U(2n,\\mathbb{R})$\nbeing reduced to the $n$-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$.\n", "  The electron-positron annihilation gamma-ray signal at 511 keV in the Milky\nWay is investigated towards a possible dark matter interpretation. If all bulge\npositrons were created by dark matter particle annihilation, the satellite\ngalaxies of the Milky Way, apparently being dominated by dark matter, should\nalso show measurable 511 keV signals. Using INTEGRAL/SPI, we test for emission\nin 39 neighbouring dwarf satellite galaxies, and found a consistent trend\nagainst a dark matter scenario. One galaxy, Reticulum II, shows up as a strong\nsource of annihilation emission, which we interpret as the presence of a\nmicroquasar, ejecting pair-plasma into the galaxy's interstellar medium.\n", "  Recently, we suggested an unconventional approach [the so-called\nInternal-Field-Guarded-Active-Region Design (IFGARD)] for the elimination of\nthe crystal polarization field induced quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) in\npolar semiconductor heterostructures. And in this work, we demonstrate by means\nof micro-photoluminescence techniques the successful tuning as well as the\nelimination of the QCSE in strongly polar $[000\\bar{1}]$ wurtzite GaN/AlN\nnanodiscs while reducing the exciton life times by more than two orders of\nmagnitude. The IFGARD based elimination of the QCSE is independent of any\nspecific crystal growth procedures. Furthermore, the cone-shaped geometry of\nthe utilized nanowires (which embeds the investigated IFGARD nanodiscs)\nfacilitates the experimental differentiation between quantum confinement- and\nQCSE-induced emission energy shifts. Due to the IFGARD, both effects become\nindependently adaptable.\n", "  We report a rectangular charge density wave (CDW) phase in strained\n1T-VSe$_2$ thin films synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy on c-sapphire\nsubstrates. The observed CDW structure exhibits an unconventional rectangular\n4a{\\times}{\\sqrt{3a}} periodicity, as opposed to the previously reported\nhexagonal $4a\\times4a$ structure in bulk crystals and exfoliated thin layered\nsamples. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a strong modulation of the local density\nof states of the same $4a\\times\\sqrt{3}a$ CDW periodicity and an energy gap of\n$2\\Delta_{CDW}=(9.1\\pm0.1)$ meV. The CDW energy gap evolves into a full gap at\ntemperatures below 500 mK, indicating a transition to an insulating phase at\nultra-low temperatures. First-principles calculations confirm the stability of\nboth $4a\\times4a$ and $4a\\times\\sqrt{3}a$ structures arising from soft modes in\nthe phonon dispersion. The unconventional structure becomes preferred in the\npresence of strain, in agreement with experimental findings.\n", "  Manipulating the propagation of light through scattering media remains a\nmajor challenge for many applications, including astronomy, biomedical imaging\nand colloidal optics. Wavefront shaping is one of the most promising ways to\nmitigate scattering and focus through inhomogeneous samples. However, wavefront\ncorrection remains accurate over only a limited spatial extent within the\nscattering medium - a correlation range referred to as the optical memory\neffect. Here, by selecting only the weakly scattered light for wavefront\nshaping, we show that the addition of temporal degrees of freedom enhances this\ncorrelation range. We investigate spatial scattering correlations by digitally\ntime-gating the early arriving light in the spectral domain. We demonstrate\nthat the range of the translational memory effect for the early arriving light\nis increased almost fourfold, paving the way for a range of scattering media\nimaging applications.\n", "  Interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) is induced in helium (He) nanodroplets by\nphotoexciting the n=2 excited state of He^+ using XUV synchrotron radiation. By\nrecording multiple coincidence electron and ion images we find that ICD occurs\nin various locations at the droplet surface, inside the surface region, or in\nthe droplet interior. ICD at the surface gives rise to energetic He^+ ions as\npreviously observed for free He dimers. ICD deeper inside leads to the ejection\nof slow He^+ ions due to Coulomb explosion delayed by elastic collisions with\nneighboring He atoms, and to the formation of He_k^+ complexes.\n", "  We present a simple diode laser-based photoionization scheme for generating\nelectrons and ions with well-defined spatial and energetic (<2 eV) structures.\nThis scheme can easily be implemented into ion or electron imaging\nspectrometers for the purpose of off-line characterization and calibration. The\nlow laser power ~1$ mW needed from a passively stabilized diode laser and the\nlow flux of potassium atoms in an effusive beam make our scheme a versatile\nsource of ions and electrons for applications in research and education.\n", "  A skyrmion racetrack design is proposed that allows for thermally stable\nskyrmions to code information and dynamical pinning sites that move with the\napplied current. This concept solves the problem of intrinsic distributions of\npinning times and pinning currents of skyrmions at static geometrical or\nmagnetic pinning sites. The dynamical pinning sites are realized by a skyrmion\ncarrying wire, where the skyrmion repulsion is used in order to keep the\nskyrmions at equal distances. The information is coded by an additional layer\nwhere the presence and absence of a skyrmion is used to code the information.\nThe lowest energy barrier for a data loss is calculated to be DE = 55 kBT300\nwhich is sufficient for long time thermal stability.\n", "  Taming chaos arising from dissipative non-autonomous nonlinear systems by\napplying additional harmonic excitations is a reliable and widely used\nprocedure nowadays. But the suppressory effectiveness of generic non-harmonic\nperiodic excitations continues to be a significant challenge both to our\ntheoretical understanding and in practical applications. Here we show how the\neffectiveness of generic suppressory excitations is optimally enhanced when the\nimpulse transmitted by them (time integral over two consecutive zeros) is\njudiciously controlled in a not obvious way. This is demonstrated\nexperimentally by means of an analog version of a universal model, and\nconfirmed numerically by simulations of such a damped driven system including\nthe presence of noise. Our theoretical analysis shows that the controlling\neffect of varying the impulse is due to a correlative variation of the energy\ntransmitted by the suppressory excitation.\n", "  We investigate noninertial effects on the scattering problem of a\nnonrelativistic particle in the cosmic string spacetime. By considering the\nnonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation we are able to show, in the regime\nof small rotational frequencies, that the phase shift has two contribution: one\nrelated to the noninertial reference frame, and the other, due to the cosmic\nstring conical topology. We also show that both the incident wave and the\nscattering amplitude are altered as a consequence of the noninertial reference\nframe and depend on the rotational frequency.\n", "  The electronic structure of a single Na monolayer on the surface of\nsingle-crystal HfSe$_2$ is investigated using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy. We find that this system exhibits an almost perfect\n\"nearly-free-electron\" behavior with an extracted effective mass of\n$\\sim\\!1m_e$, in contrast to heavier masses found previously for alkali metal\nmonolayers on other substrates. Our density-functional-theory calculations\nindicate that this is due to the large lattice constant, causing both exchange\nand correlation interactions to be suppressed, and to the weak hybridization\nbetween the overlayer and the substrate. This is therefore an ideal model\nsystem for understanding the properties of two-dimensional materials.\n", "  We found an analytical solution for the neutrino mass matrix in the most\ngeneral case of the Zee model. Using the recent data on the neutrino parameters\nbesides generating neutrino masses at 1-loop level we fit also the masses of\nthe charged leptons and the leptonic mixing matrix. We also show in what\nconditions the model is not compatible with neutrino data.\n", "  The Dirac oscillator in a homogenous magnetic field exhibits a chirality\nphase transition at a particular (critical) value of the magnetic field.\nRecently, this system has also been shown to be exactly solvable in the context\nof noncommutative quantum mechanics featuring the interesting phenomenon of\nre-entrant phase transitions. In this work we provide a detailed study of the\nthermodynamics of such quantum phase transitions (both in the standard and in\nthe noncommutative case) within the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics pointing out\nthat the magnetization has discontinuities at critical values of the magnetic\nfield even at finite temperatures.\n", "  The AMS-02 detector will operate for at least 3 years on the International\nSpace Station, measuring cosmic ray spectra at about 400 km above sea level\nover a wide range of geomagnetic latitude.\n  The proximity focusing ring imaging \\v{C}erenkov counter of AMS-02 will\nmeasure the particle velocity $\\beta$ with $\\approx 0.1%$ uncertainty, making\npossible to discriminate Beryllium isotopes up to about 15 GeV/nucl. In\naddition its charge measurement will allow to study the elemental composition\nof cosmic rays up to Iron. A prototype of the RICH detector was tested with\ncosmic rays and on a ion beam accelerated by SPS, at CERN (October 2002).\n"]}
