These systems are isospectral to a given system with constant mass. The\ncase of a charged particle with a PDM interacting with an external magnetic\nfield is included in the present investigation. We apply the approach in order\nto construct the SU(2) coherent states in some examples which are isospectral\nto the two-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator, and discuss the impact\nof the introduction of special non-homogeneous external magnetic fields.\n", "  A novel realization of the Starobinsky inflationary model within a moderate\nextension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is presented. The\nproposed superpotential is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R and a\nZ_2 discrete symmetry, whereas the Kahler potential respects a no-scale-type\nSU(54,1)/SU(54)x U(1)_R x Z_2 symmetry too. The inflaton is identified with a\nHiggs-like modulus whose the vacuum expectation value controls the\ngravitational strength. Thanks to a strong enough coupling (with a parameter cT\ninvolved) between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar curvature, inflation can be\nattained even for subplanckian values of the inflaton with cT>76 and the\ncorresponding effective theory being valid up to the Planck scale. The\ninflationary observables turn out to be in agreement with the current data and\nthe inflaton mass is predicted to be 3x10^13 GeV. At the cost of a relatively\nsmall superpotential coupling constant, the model offers also a resolution to\nthe mu problem of the MSSM. Supplementing MSSM by three right-handed neutrinos\nwe show that spontaneously arising couplings between the inflaton and the\nparticle content of MSSM not only ensure a sufficiently low reheating\ntemperature but also support a scenario of non-thermal leptogenesis\nconsistently with the neutrino oscillation parameters for gravitino heavier\nthan about 10^4 GeV.\n", "  We present a measurement of the fundamental parameter of the standard model,\nthe weak mixing angle, in $p\\bar{p}\\rightarrow Z/\\gamma^{*}\\rightarrow\ne^{+}e^{-}$ events at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV, using data\ncorresponding to 9.7 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected by the D0\ndetector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The effective weak mixing angle is extracted\nfrom the forward-backward charge asymmetry as a function of the invariant mass\naround the Z boson pole. The measured value of\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{\\text{eff}}^{\\text{$\\ell$}}=0.23147 \\pm 0.00047$ is the most\nprecise measurement from light quark interactions to date, with a precision\nclose to the best LEP and SLD results.\n", "  The impact of three-nucleon forces (3NFs) along the oxygen chain is\ninvestigated for the spectral distribution for attachment and removal of a\nnucleon, spectroscopic factors and matter radii. We employ self-consistent\nGreen's function (SCGF) theory which allows a comprehensive calculation of the\nsingle particle spectral function. For the closed subshell isotopes, $^{14}$O,\n$^{16}$O, $^{22}$O, $^{24}$O and $^{28}$O, we perform calculations with the\nDyson-ADC(3) method. The remaining open shell isotopes are studied using the\nnewly developed Gorkov-SCGF formalism up to second order. We produce plots for\nthe full-fledged spectral distributions. The spectroscopic factors for the\ndominant quasiparticle peaks are found to depend very little on the leading\norder (NNLO) chiral 3NFs. The latters have small impact on the calculated\nmatter radii, which, however are consistently obtained smaller than experiment.\nSimilarly, single particle spectra tend to be diluted with respect to\nexperiment. This effect might hinder, to some extent, the onset of correlations\nand screen the quenching of calculated spectroscopic factors. The most\nimportant effects of 3NFs is thus the fine tuning of the energies for the\ndominant quasiparticle states, which govern the shell evolution and the\nposition of driplines. Although present chiral NNLO 3NFs interactions do\nreproduce the binding energies correctly in this mass region, the details of\nthe nuclear wave function remain at odd with the experiment showing too small\nradii and a too dilute single particle spectrum, similar to what already\npointed out for larger masses. This suggests a lack of repulsion in the present\nmodel of NN+3N interactions which is mildly apparent already for masses in the\nA=14--28 range.\n", "  A new causal paradox in superluminal signaling is presented. In contrast to\nthe Tolman paradox with tachyon exchange between two parties, the new paradox\nappears already in a one-way superluminal signaling, even without creating the\ntime loop. This produces a universal ban on superluminal signals, which is\nstronger than the ban imposed by the Tolman paradox. The analysis also shows\nthat records of evolution of a superluminal object observed from two different\nreference frames may be time-reversed with respect to each other. Interactions\nwith such objects could add some new features to spectroscopy.\n  Even though relativity embraces superluminal motions, thus making the world\nsymmetric with respect to the invariant speed barrier, their ineptness for\nsignaling makes the symmetry incomplete.\n  Key words: superluminal signaling, tachyons, the Tolman paradox\n", "  The valley degree of freedom of electrons in solids has been proposed as a\nnew type of information carriers beyond the electronic charge and spin. Recent\nexperimental demonstrations of the optical orientation of the valley\npolarization and generation of the valley current through the valley Hall\neffect in monolayer MoS2 have shown the potential of two-dimensional\nsemiconductor transition metal dichalcogenides for valley based electronic and\noptoelectronic applications. The valley Hall conductivity in monolayer MoS2, a\nnon-centrosymmetric crystal, however, cannot be easily tuned, presenting a\nchallenge for valley-based applications. Here we report the control of the\nvalley Hall effect in bilayer MoS2 transistors through a gate. The inversion\nsymmetry present in bilayer MoS2 was broken by the gate applied electric field\nperpendicular to the plane. The valley polarization near the edges of the\ndevice channels induced by the longitudinal electrical current was imaged by\nuse of Kerr rotation microscopy. The polarization is out-of-plane, has opposite\nsign for the two edges, and is strongly dependent on the gate voltage. The\nobservation is consistent with the symmetry dependent Berry curvature and\nvalley Hall conductivity in bilayer MoS2. Our results are another step towards\ninformation processing based on the valley degree of freedom.\n", "  We discuss thermotropic nematic liquid crystals in the mean-field regime. In\nthe first part of this article, we rigorously carry out the mean-field limit of\na system of $N$ rod-like particles as $N\\to\\infty$, which yields an effective\n`one-body' free energy functional. In the second part, we focus on spatially\nhomogeneous systems, for which we study the associated Euler-Lagrange equation,\nwith a focus on phase transitions for general axisymmetric potentials. We prove\nthat the system is isotropic at high temperature, while anisotropic\ndistributions appear through a transcritical bifurcation as the temperature is\nlowered. Finally, as the temperature goes to zero we also prove, in the\nconcrete case of the Maier-Saupe potential, that the system converges to\nperfect nematic order.\n", "  We perform a general computational analysis of possible post-collision mass\ndistributions in high-speed galaxy cluster collisions in the presence of weakly\nself-interacting dark matter. Using this analysis, we show that weakly\nself-scattering dark matter can impart subtle yet measurable features in the\nmass distributions of colliding galaxy clusters even without significant\ndisruptions to the dark matter halos of the colliding galaxy clusters\nthemselves. Most profound such evidences are found to reside in the tails of\ndark matter halos' distributions, in the space between the colliding galaxy\nclusters. This feature appears in our simulations as shells of scattered dark\nmatter expanding in alignment with the outgoing original galaxy clusters,\ncontributing significant densities to projected mass distributions at large\ndistances from collision centers and large scattering angles up to $90^\\circ$.\nOur simulations indicate that as much as 20% of the total collision's mass may\nbe deposited into such structures without noticeable disruptions to the main\ngalaxy clusters. Such structures at large scattering angles are forbidden\nhowever in purely gravitational high-speed galaxy cluster collisions.\nConvincing identification of such structures in real colliding galaxy clusters\nwould be a clear indication of the self-interacting nature of dark matter. Our\nfindings may explain the dark matter ring feature recently found in the\nlong-range reconstructions of the mass distribution of the colliding galaxy\ncluster CL0024+017.\n", "  We describe a new mechanism - radiatively-induced gravitational leptogenesis\n- for generating the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. We show how\nquantum loop effects in C and CP violating theories cause matter and antimatter\nto propagate differently in the presence of gravity, and prove this is\nforbidden in flat space by CPT and translation symmetry. This generates a\ncurvature-dependent chemical potential for leptons, allowing a\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry to be generated in thermal equilibrium in the early\nUniverse. The time-dependent dynamics necessary for leptogenesis is provided by\nthe interaction of the virtual self-energy cloud of the leptons with the\nexpanding curved spacetime background, which violates the strong equivalence\nprinciple and allows a distinction between matter and antimatter. We show here\nhow this mechanism is realised in a particular BSM theory, the see-saw model,\nwhere the quantum loops involve the heavy sterile neutrinos responsible for\nlight neutrino masses. We demonstrate by explicit computation of the relevant\ntwo-loop Feynman diagrams how these radiative corrections display the necessary\ndependence on the sterile neutrino masses to generate an asymmetry, and show\nhow the induced lepton asymmetry may be sufficiently large to play an important\nrole in determining the baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe.\n", "  We construct a series of new hyperbolic black hole solutions in\nEinstein-Scalar system and we apply holographic approach to investigate the\nspherical R\\'{e}nyi entropy in various deformations of dual conformal field\ntheories (CFTs). Especially, we introduce various powers of scalars in the\nscalar potentials for massive and massless scalar. These scalar potentials\ncorrespond to deformation of dual CFTs. Then we solve asymptotically hyperbolic\nAdS black hole solutions numerically. We map the instabilities of these black\nhole solutions to phase transitions of field theory in terms of CHM mapping\nbetween hyperbolic hairy AdS black hole and spherical R\\'{e}nyi entropy in dual\nfield theories. Based on these solutions, we study the temperature dependent\ncondensation of dual operator of massive and massless scalar respectively.\nThese condensations show that there might exist phase transitions in dual\ndeformed CFTs. We also compare free energy between asymptotically hyperbolic\nAdS black hole solutions and hyperbolic AdS Schwarz (AdS-SW) black hole to test\nphase transitions. In order to confirm the existence of phase transitions, we\nturn on linear in-homogenous perturbation to test stability of these hyperbolic\nhairy AdS black holes. In this paper, we show how potential parameters affect\nthe stability of hyperbolic black holes in several specific examples. For\ngeneral values of potential parameters, it needs further studies to see how the\ntransition happens. Finally, we comment on these instabilities associated with\nspherical R\\'{e}nyi entropy in dual deformed CFTs.\n", "  The study of conformal restriction properties in two-dimensions has been\ninitiated by Lawler, Schramm and Werner who focused on the natural and\nimportant chordal case: They characterized and constructed all random subsets\nof a given simply connected domain that join two marked boundary points and\nthat satisfy the additional restriction property. The radial case (sets joining\nan inside point to a boundary point) has then been investigated by Wu. In the\npresent paper, we study the third natural instance of such restriction\nproperties, namely the \"trichordal case\", where one looks at random sets that\njoin three marked boundary points. This case involves somewhat more\ntechnicalities than the other two, as the construction of this family of random\nsets relies on special variants of SLE$_{8/3}$ processes with a drift term in\nthe driving function that involves hypergeometric functions. It turns out that\nsuch a random set can not be a simple curve simultaneously in the neighborhood\nof all three marked points, and that the exponent $\\alpha = 20/27$ shows up in\nthe description of the law of the skinniest possible symmetric random set with\nthis trichordal restriction property.\n", "  Recently, Kristensen, Ge and Hughes have compared [Phys. Rev. A 92, 053810\n(2015)] three different methods for normalization of quasinormal modes in open\noptical systems, and concluded that they all provide the same result. We show\nhere that this conclusion is incorrect and illustrate that the normalization of\n[Opt. Lett. 37, 1649 (2012)] is divergent for any optical mode having a finite\nquality factor, and that the Silver-Mueller radiation condition is not\nfulfilled for quasinormal modes.\n", "  In 2000 Iwaniec, Luo, and Sarnak proved for certain families of $L$-functions\nassociated to holomorphic newforms of square-free level that, under the\nGeneralized Riemann Hypothesis, as the conductors tend to infinity the\none-level density of their zeros matches the one-level density of eigenvalues\nof large random matrices from certain classical compact groups in the\nappropriate scaling limit. We remove the square-free restriction by obtaining a\ntrace formula for arbitrary level by using a basis developed by Blomer and\nMili\\'cevi\\'c, which is of use for other problems as well.\n", "  We show that the static properties of a nucleus could arise from a single\nquark moving in a mean field generated by all other constituents of this\nnucleus. The resulting model provides a way for determining the nuclear sizes\ncharacteristic of the liquid drop model, and reasonably accurate values of\nmagnetic moments of different nuclei with the aid of two parameters $\\alpha_s$\nand $\\sigma$ appearing in the Cornell potential intended for use in quarkonium\nphysics.\n", "  The Hamiltonian defines the dynamical properties of the universe. Evidence\nfrom particle physics shows that there is a different version of the\nHamiltonian for each direction of time. As there is no physical basis for the\nuniverse to be asymmetric in time, both versions must operate equally. However,\nconventional physical theories accommodate only one version of the Hamiltonian\nand one direction of time. This represents an unexplained anomaly in\nconventional physics and calls for a reworking of the concepts of time and\nspace. Here I explain how the anomaly can be resolved by allowing dynamics to\nemerge phenomenologically. The resolution offers a picture of time and space\nthat lies below our everyday experience, and one in which their differences are\nepiphenomenal rather than elemental.\n", "  Electron-positron pair production by means of vacuum polarization in the\npresence of strong electromagnetic (EM) field of two counterpropagating laser\npulses is studied. A 3-dimensional model of the focused laser pulses based on\nthe solution of the Maxwell's equations proposed by Narozhny and Fofanov is\nused to find the structure of EM field of the circularly polarized\ncounterpropagating pulses. Analytical calculations show that the electric and\nmagnetic fields are almost parallel to each other in the focal region when\npulses are completely transverse either in electric (e-wave) or magnetic\n(h-wave) field. On the other hand the electric and magnetic fields are almost\northogonal when the counterpropagating pulses are made up of equal mixture of\ne- and h- polarized waves. It is found that while the latter configuration of\nthe colliding pulses has much larger threshold for pair production it can\nprovide much shorter electron/positron pulses compared to the former case. The\ndependence of pair production and its spatiotemporal distribution on\npolarization of the laser pulses is analyzed using the structure of the EM\nfield.\n", "  This paper is focused on the functional renormalization group applied to the\n$T_5^6$ tensor model on the Abelian group $U(1)$ with closure constraint. For\nthe first time, we derive the flow equations for the couplings and mass\nparameters in a suitable truncation around the marginal interactions with\nrespect to the perturbative power counting. For the second time, we study the\nbehavior around the Gaussian fixed point, and show that the theory is\nnonasymptotically free. Finally, we discuss the UV completion of the theory. We\nshow the existence of several nontrivial fixed points, study the behavior of\nthe renormalization group flow around them, and point out evidence in favor of\nan asymptotically safe theory.\n", "  We introduce Orbifold Reduction, a new method for generating $2d$ $(0,2)$\ngauge theories associated to D1-branes probing singular toric Calabi-Yau\n4-folds starting from $4d$ $\\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories on D3-branes probing\ntoric Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The new procedure generalizes dimensional reduction\nand orbifolding. In terms of T-dual configurations, it generates brane brick\nmodels starting from brane tilings. Orbifold reduction provides an agile\napproach for generating $2d$ $(0,2)$ theories with a brane realization. We\npresent three practical applications of the new algorithm: the connection\nbetween $4d$ Seiberg duality and $2d$ triality, a combinatorial method for\ngenerating theories related by triality and a $2d$ $(0,2)$ generalization of\nthe Klebanov-Witten mass deformation.\n", "  Coupling cyber and physical systems gives rise to numerous engineering\nchallenges and opportunities. An important challenge is the contagion of\nfailure from one system to another, which can lead to large-scale cascading\nfailures. However, the self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity\nwhere the overlaying cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical\nnetwork. To capture both self-healing and contagion, this paper considers a\ngraphical model representation of an interdependent cyber-physical system, in\nwhich nodes represent various cyber or physical functionalities, and edges\ncapture the interactions between the nodes. A message-passing algorithm is\nproposed for this representation to study the dynamics of failure propagation\nand healing. By conducting a density evolution analysis for this algorithm,\nnetwork reaction to initial disruptions is investigated. It is proved that as\nthe number of message-passing iterations increases, the network reaches a\nsteady-state condition that would be either a complete healing or a complete\ncollapse. Then, a sufficient condition is derived to select the network\nparameters to guarantee the complete healing of the system. The result of the\ndensity evolution analysis is further employed to jointly optimize the design\nof cyber and physical networks for maximum resiliency. This analytical\nframework is then extended to the cases where propagation of failures in the\nphysical network is faster than the healing responses of the cyber network.\nSuch scenarios are of interest in many real-life applications such as smart\ngrid. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify the analysis\nand investigate the impact of the network parameters on the resiliency of the\nnetwork.\n", "  Using the algebraic Bethe ansatz, we derive a matrix product representation\nof the exact Bethe-ansatz states of the six-vertex Heisenberg chain (either XXX\nor XXZ and spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$) with open boundary conditions. In this\nrepresentation, the components of the Bethe eigenstates are expressed as traces\nof products of matrices which act on a tensor product of auxiliary spaces. As\ncompared to the matrix product states of the same Heisenberg chain but with\nperiodic boundary conditions, the dimension of the exact auxiliary matrices is\nenlarged as if the conserved number of spin-flips considered would have been\ndoubled. This result is generic for any non-nested integrable model, as is\nclear from our derivation and we further show by providing an additional\nexample of the same matrix product state construction for a well known model of\na gas of interacting bosons. Counterintuitively, the matrices do not depend on\nthe spatial coordinate despite the open boundaries and thus suggest generic\nways of exploiting (emergent) translational invariance both for finite size and\nin the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We calculate the anomalous dimensions of higher-spin currents, both singlet\nand non-singlet, in the Gross-Neveu model at the $1/n^2$ order. It was\nconjectured that in the critical regime this model is dual to a higher-spin\ngauge theory on $AdS_4$. The $AdS/CFT$ correspondence predicts that the masses\nof higher-spin fields correspond to the scaling dimensions of the singlet\ncurrents in the Gross-Neveu model.\n", "  We introduce general bounds for the parameter estimation error in nonlinear\nquantum metrology of many-body open systems in the Markovian limit. Given a\n$k$-body Hamiltonian and $p$-body Lindblad operators, the estimation error of a\nHamitonian parameter using a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as a probe\nis shown to scale as $N^{-\\left(k-\\frac{p}{2}\\right)}$, surpassing the\nshot-noise limit for $2k>p+1$. Metrology equivalence between initial product\nstates and maximally entangled states is established for $p\\geq 1$. We further\nshow that one can estimate the system-environment coupling parameter with\nprecision $N^{-\\frac{p}{2}}$, while many-body decoherence enhances the\nprecision to $N^{-k}$ in the noise-amplitude estimation of a fluctuating\n$k$-body Hamiltonian. For the long-range Ising model we show that the precision\nof this parameter beats the shot-noise limit when the range of interactions is\nbelow a threshold value.\n", "  We introduce a new duality for $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauged matrix\nmodels. This $0d$ duality is an order 4 symmetry, namely an equivalence between\nfour different theories, hence we call it Quadrality. Our proposal is motivated\nby mirror symmetry, but is not restricted to theories with a D-brane\nrealization and holds for general $\\mathcal{N}=1$ matrix models. We present\nvarious checks of the proposal, including the matching of: global symmetries,\nanomalies, deformations and the chiral ring. We also consider quivers and the\ncorresponding quadrality networks. Finally, we initiate the study of matrix\nmodels that arise on the worldvolume of D(-1)-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau\n5-folds.\n", "  The gauged model of Siegel type chiral boson is considered. It has been shown\nthat the action of gauged model of Floreanini-Jackiw (FJ) type chiral boson is\ncontained in it in an interesting manner. A BRST invariant action corresponding\nto the action of gauged FJ type chiral boson has been formulated using Batalin,\nFradkin and Vilkovisky based improved Fujiwara, Igarishi and Kubo (FIK)\nformalism. An alternative quantization of the gauge symmetric action has been\nmade with a Lorentz gauge and an attempt has been made to establish the\nequivalence between the gauge symmetric version of the extended phase space and\noriginal gauge non-invariant version of the usual phase space.\n", "  We study the stochastic dynamics of strongly-coupled excitable elements on a\ntree network. The peripheral nodes receive independent random inputs which may\ninduce large spiking events propagating through the branches of the tree and\nleading to global coherent oscillations in the network. This scenario may be\nrelevant to action potential generation in certain sensory neurons, which\npossess myelinated distal dendritic tree-like arbors with excitable nodes of\nRanvier at peripheral and branching nodes and exhibit noisy periodic sequences\nof action potentials.\n  We focus on the spiking statistics of the central node, which fires in\nresponse to a noisy input at peripheral nodes. We show that, in the strong\ncoupling regime, relevant to myelinated dendritic trees, the spike train\nstatistics can be predicted from an isolated excitable element with rescaled\nparameters according to the network topology. Furthermore, we show that by\nvarying the network topology the spike train statistics of the central node can\nbe tuned to have a certain firing rate and variability, or to allow for an\noptimal discrimination of inputs applied at the peripheral nodes.\n", "  We consider the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) limit of ghost-free massive\nbimetric gravity with two mutually non-interacting matter sectors coupled to\nthe two metrics. Making use of a gauge-invariant differential decomposition of\nthe metric perturbations, we solve the field equations up to the linear PPN\norder for a static, point-like mass source. From the result we derive the PPN\nparameter $\\gamma$ for spherically symmetric systems, which describes the\ngravitational deflection of light by visible matter. By a comparison to its\nvalue measured in the solar system we obtain bounds on the parameters of the\ntheory. We further discuss the deflection of light by dark matter and find an\nagreement with the observed light deflection by galaxies. We finally speculate\nabout a possible explanation for the observed distribution of dark matter in\ngalactic mergers such as Abell 520 and Abell 3827.\n", "  The Loschmidt echo, defined as the overlap between quantum wave function\nevolved with different Hamiltonians, quantifies the sensitivity of quantum\ndynamics to perturbations and is often used as a probe of quantum chaos. In\nthis work we consider the behavior of the Loschmidt echo in the many body\nlocalized phase, which is characterized by emergent local integrals of motion,\nand provides a generic example of non-ergodic dynamics. We demonstrate that the\nfluctuations of the Loschmidt echo decay as a power law in time in the\nmany-body localized phase, in contrast to the exponential decay in few-body\nergodic systems. We consider the spin-echo generalization of the Loschmidt\necho, and argue that the corresponding correlation function saturates to a\nfinite value in localized systems. Slow, power-law decay of fluctuations of\nsuch spin-echo-type overlap is related to the operator spreading and is present\nonly in the many-body localized phase, but not in a non-interacting Anderson\ninsulator. While most of the previously considered probes of dephasing dynamics\ncould be understood by approximating physical spin operators with local\nintegrals of motion, the Loschmidt echo and its generalizations crucially\ndepend on the full expansion of the physical operators via local integrals of\nmotion operators, as well as operators which flip local integrals of motion.\nHence, these probes allow to get insights into the relation between physical\noperators and local integrals of motion, and access the operator spreading in\nthe many-body localized phase.\n", "  We propose a new method for frequency conversion of photons which is both\nversatile and deterministic. We show that a system with two resonators\nultrastrongly coupled to a single qubit can be used to realize both single- and\nmultiphoton frequency-conversion processes. The conversion can be exquisitely\ncontrolled by tuning the qubit frequency to bring the desired\nfrequency-conversion transitions on or off resonance. Considering recent\nexperimental advances in ultrastrong coupling for circuit QED and other\nsystems, we believe that our scheme can be implemented using available\ntechnology.\n", "  In this work we have investigated the effect of Rashba splitting on the RKKY\ninteraction in TI thin film both at finite and zero chemical potential. We find\nthat the spin susceptibility of Rashba materials including TI thin film is\nstrongly dependent on the direction of distance vector. Moreover, we find\nanother term in the off-diagonal terms of the spin-susceptibility tensor which\nin contrast to the well-known DM-like term is symmetric. We show how one can\ntune the RKKY interaction by using electric field applied perpendicularly to\nthe surface plane and by small chemical doping giving rise to enhance the RKKY\nterm, drastically. We have presented our results for two different situations,\nnamely inter-surface pairing of magnetic impurities as well as intra-surface\none. The behavior of these two situations is completely different which we\ndescribe it by mapping the density of states of each surface on the band\ndispersion.\n", "  We compute the elliptic genus of abelian 2d (0,2) gauge theories\ncorresponding to brane brick models. These theories are worldvolume theories on\na single D1-brane probing a toric Calabi-Yau 4-fold singularity. We identify a\nmatch with the elliptic genus of the non-linear sigma model on the same\nCalabi-Yau background, which is computed using a new localization formula. The\nmatching implies that the quantum effects do not drastically alter the\ncorrespondence between the geometry and the 2d (0,2) gauge theory. In theories\nwhose matter sector suffers from abelian gauge anomaly, we propose an ansatz\nfor an anomaly cancelling term in the integral formula for the elliptic genus.\nWe provide an example in which two brane brick models related to each other by\nGadde-Gukov-Putrov triality give the same elliptic genus.\n", "  Raman scattering experiments on LaFeAsO with splitted antiferromagnetic\n(T_AFM = 140 K) and tetragonal-orthorhombic (T_S = 155 K) transitions show a\nquasi-elastic peak (QEP) in B2g symmetry (2 Fe tetragonal cell) that fades away\nbelow ~T_AFM and is ascribed to electronic nematic fluctuations. A scaling of\nthe reported shear modulus with the T-dependence of the QEP height rather than\nthe QEP area indicates that magnetic degrees of freedom drive the structural\ntransition. The large separation between T_S and T_AFM in LaFeAsO compared with\ntheir coincidence in BaFe2As2 manifests itself in slower dynamics of nematic\nfluctuations in the former.\n", "  Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is the best candidate for spin-triplet superconductivity, an\nunusual and elusive superconducting state of fundamental importance. In the\nlast three decades Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has been very carefully studied and despite\nits apparent simplicity when compared with strongly correlated high-$T_{c}$\ncuprates, for which the pairing symmetry is understood, there is no scenario\nthat can explain all the major experimental observations, a conundrum that has\ngenerated tremendous interest. Here we present a density-functional based\nanalysis of magnetic interactions in Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and discuss the role of\nmagnetic anisotropy in its unconventional superconductivity. Our goal is\ntwofold. First, we access the possibility of the superconducting order\nparameter rotation in an external magnetic field of 200 Oe, and conclude that\nthe spin-orbit interaction in this material is several orders of magnitude too\nstrong to be consistent with this hypothesis. Thus, the observed invariance of\nthe Knight shift across $T_{c}$ has no plausible explanation, and casts doubt\non using the Knight shift as an ultimate litmus paper for the pairing symmetry.\nSecond, we propose a quantitative double-exchange-like model for combining\nitinerant fermions with an anisotropic Heisenberg magnetic Hamiltonian. This\nmodel is complementary to the Hubbard-model-based calculations published so\nfar, and forms an alternative framework for exploring superconducting symmetry\nin Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}.$ As an example, we use this model to analyze the\ndegeneracy between various $p-$triplet states in the simplest mean-field\napproximation, and show that it splits into a single and two doublets with the\nground state defined by the competition between the \"Ising\" and \"compass\"\nanisotropic terms.\n", "  Generalised hydrodynamics predicts universal ballistic transport in\nintegrable lattice systems when prepared in generic inhomogeneous initial\nstates. However, the ballistic contribution to transport can vanish in systems\nwith additional discrete symmetries. Here we perform large scale numerical\nsimulations of spin dynamics in the anisotropic Heisenberg $XXZ$ spin $1/2$\nchain starting from an inhomogeneous mixed initial state which is symmetric\nwith respect to a combination of spin-reversal and spatial reflection. In the\nisotropic and easy-axis regimes we find non-ballistic spin transport which we\nanalyse in detail in terms of scaling exponents of the transported\nmagnetisation and scaling profiles of the spin density. While in the easy-axis\nregime we find accurate evidence of normal diffusion, the spin transport in the\nisotropic case is clearly super-diffusive, with the scaling exponent very close\nto $2/3$, but with universal scaling dynamics which obeys the diffusion\nequation in nonlinearly scaled time.\n", "  Modern radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will probe\nthe radio sky over large fields-of-view, which results in large w-modulations\nof the sky image. This effect complicates the relationship between the measured\nvisibilities and the image under scrutiny. In algorithmic terms, it gives rise\nto massive memory and computational time requirements. Yet, it can be a\nblessing in terms of reconstruction quality of the sky image. In recent years,\nseveral works have shown that large w-modulations promote the spread spectrum\neffect. Within the compressive sensing framework, this effect increases the\nincoherence between the sensing basis and the sparsity basis of the signal to\nbe recovered, leading to better estimation of the sky image. In this article,\nwe revisit the w-projection approach using convex optimisation in realistic\nsettings, where the measurement operator couples the w-terms in Fourier and the\nde-gridding kernels. We provide sparse, thus fast, models of the Fourier part\nof the measurement operator through adaptive sparsification procedures.\nConsequently, memory requirements and computational cost are significantly\nalleviated, at the expense of introducing errors on the radio-interferometric\ndata model. We present a first investigation of the impact of the sparse\nvariants of the measurement operator on the image reconstruction quality. We\nfinally analyse the interesting super-resolution potential associated with the\nspread spectrum effect of the w-modulation, and showcase it through\nsimulations. Our C++ code is available online on GitHub.\n", "  We address the electronic structure of the surface states of topological\ninsulator thin films with embedded local non-magnetic and magnetic impurities.\nUsing the $T$-matrix expansion of the real space Green's function, we derive\nthe local density of electrons states and corresponding spin resolved\ndensities. We show that the effects of the impurities can be tuned by applying\nan electric field between the surface layers. The emerging magnetic states are\nexpected to play an important role both in ferromagnetic mechanism of magnetic\ntopological insulators as well as in its transport properties. In the case of\nmagnetic impurities, we have categorized the possible cases for different\nspin-directions of the impurities as well as the spin-direction in which the\nspin resolved density of electron states is calculated and related this to the\nspin susceptibility of the system.\n", "  Solar cells based on hybrid perovskites have shown high efficiency while\npossessing simple processing methods. To gain a fundamental understanding of\ntheir properties on an atomic level, we investigate single crystals of\nCH3NH3PbI3 with a narrow transition (~5 K) near 327 K. Temperature dependent\nstructural measurements reveal a persistent tetragonal structure with smooth\nchanges in the atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) on crossing T*. We show\nthat the ADPs for I ions yield extended flat regions in the potential wells\nconsistent with the measured large thermal expansion parameter. Molecular\ndynamics simulations reveal that this material exhibits significant high\nasymmetries in the Pb-I pair distribution functions. We also show that the\nintrinsically enhanced freedom of motion of the iodine atoms enables large\ndeformations. This flexibility (softness) of the atomic structure results in\nhighly localized atomic relaxation about defects and hence accounts for both\nthe high carrier mobility as well as the structural instability.\n", "  It is well known that the memory effect in flat spacetime is parametrized by\nthe BMS supertranslation. We investigate the relation between the memory effect\nand diffeomorphism in de Sitter spacetime. We find that gravitational memory is\nparametrized by a BMS-like supertranslation in the static patch of de Sitter\nspacetime. We also show a diffeomorphism that corresponds to gravitational\nmemory in the Poincare/cosmological patch. Our method does not need to assume\nthe separation between the source and the detector to be small compared with\nthe Hubble radius, and can potentially be applicable to other FLRW universes,\nas well as \"ordinary memory\" mediated by massive messenger particles.\n", "  A modified Gibbs's rotation matrix is derived and the connection with the\nEuler angles, quaternions, and Cayley$-$Klein parameters is established. As\nparticular cases, the Rodrigues and Gibbs parameterizations of the rotation are\nobtained. The composition law of two rotations from the quaternion\nrepresentation is presented showing a convenient expression for calculating the\nsuccessive rotations.\n", "  Normalized double-differential cross sections for top quark pair (t t-bar)\nproduction are measured in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV\nwith the CMS experiment at the LHC. The analyzed data correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The measurement is performed\nin the dilepton e+/- mu-/+ final state. The t t-bar cross section is determined\nas a function of various pairs of observables characterizing the kinematics of\nthe top quark and t t-bar system. The data are compared to calculations using\nperturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading and approximate\nnext-to-next-to-leading orders. They are also compared to predictions of Monte\nCarlo event generators that complement fixed-order computations with parton\nshowers, hadronization, and multiple-parton interactions. Overall agreement is\nobserved with the predictions, which is improved when the latest global sets of\nproton parton distribution functions are used. The inclusion of the measured t\nt-bar cross sections in a fit of parametrized parton distribution functions is\nshown to have significant impact on the gluon distribution.\n", "  The redistribution of energy levels between energy bands is studied for a\nfamily of simple effective Hamiltonians depending on one control parameter and\npossessing axial symmetry and energy-reflection symmetry. Further study is made\non the topological phase transition in the corresponding semi-quantum and\ncompletely classical models, and finally the joint spectrum of the two\ncommuting observables $(H=E,J_z)$ (also called the lattice of quantum states)\nis superposed on the image of the energy-momentum map for the classical model.\nThrough these comparative analyses, mutual correspondence is demonstrated to\nexist among the redistribution of energy levels between energy bands for the\nquantum Hamiltonian, the modification of Chern numbers of eigenline bundles for\nthe corresponding semi-quantum Hamiltonian, and the presence of Hamiltonian\nmonodromy for the complete classical analog. In particular, as far as the band\nrearrangement is concerned, a fine agreement is found between the\nredistribution of the energy levels described in terms of joint spectrum of\nenergy and momentum in the full quantum model and the evolution of\nsingularities of the energy-momentum map of the complete classical model. The\ntopological phase transition observed in the present semi-quantum and the\ncomplete classical models are analogous to topological phase transitions of\nmatter.\n", "  We consider the weakly asymmetric exclusion process with $N=L/2$ particles on\na periodic lattice of $L$ sites, and hopping rates $1$ and $q=1-\\mu/\\sqrt{L}$\nrespectively in the forward and in the backward direction. Using Bethe ansatz,\nwe obtain a systematic perturbative expansion of the spectral gap near $\\mu=0$\nby solving order by order a simple functional equation. A key point is that\nwhen $\\mu\\to0$, Bethe roots at a distance $1/\\sqrt{L}$ from the edge of the\nFermi sea should not be considered as a continuum, but converge instead at\nlarge $L$ to the complex zeroes of $1+\\mathrm{erf}(x)$ after a rescaling by\n$\\sqrt{L}$.\n", "  This paper analyses the world web of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) using a\ncomplex network approach. We use data of M&As to build a temporal sequence of\nbinary and weighted-directed networks for the period 1995-2010 and 224\ncountries (nodes) connected according to their M&As flows (links). We study\ndifferent geographical and temporal aspects of the international M&A network\n(IMAN), building sequences of filtered sub-networks whose links belong to\nspecific intervals of distance or time. Given that M&As and trade are\ncomplementary ways of reaching foreign markets, we perform our analysis using\nstatistics employed for the study of the international trade network (ITN),\nhighlighting the similarities and differences between the ITN and the IMAN. In\ncontrast to the ITN, the IMAN is a low density network characterized by a\npersistent giant component with many external nodes and low reciprocity.\nClustering patterns are very heterogeneous and dynamic. High-income economies\nare the main acquirers and are characterized by high connectivity, implying\nthat most countries are targets of a few acquirers. Like in the ITN,\ngeographical distance strongly impacts the structure of the IMAN: link-weights\nand node degrees have a non-linear relation with distance, and an assortative\npattern is present at short distances.\n", "  In this paper we present the generalization of Chern-Simons-like theories of\ngravity (CSLTG) to spin-3. We propose a Lagrangian describing the spin-3 fields\ncoupled to Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity. Then we obtain conserved\ncharges of these theories by using a quasi-local formalism. We find a general\nformula for entropy of black holes solutions of Spin-3 CSLTG. As an example, we\napply our formalism to the spin-3 Generalized minimal massive gravity (GMMG)\nmodel. We analysis this model at linearized level and show that this model\npropagate two massive spin-2 modes and two massive spin-3 modes. We find\nno-ghost and no-tachyon conditions, which can be satisfy in the parameter space\nof the model. Then we find energy, angular momentum and entropy of a special\nblack hole solution of this model.\n", "  Effective field theories such as Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) are\nindispensable tools in controlling the effects of the strong interaction. The\nincreasing experimental precision requires the knowledge of higher dimensional\noperators. We present a general method that allows for an easy construction of\nHQET operators that contain two heavy quarks and any number of covariant\nderivatives.\n", "  We suggest a lecture on Newtonian gravity, discussing how the use of the\nscientific method allows to rule out some of the models for the shape of Earth\nleaving a spherical Earth as the only possibility, in agreement with empirical\nobservation. In particular, we suggest to focus on a physical quantity, namely\nthe gravitational acceleration, that can be both computed theoretically and\nmeasured in experiments. Rather than insisting on the numerical code for the\nevaluation of the gravitational acceleration -- that can be computed anyway in\nany numerical analysis course -- we want to focus on the formal setting of the\nproblem, emphasizing the importance of having a mathematical formulation\ncapable of quantitative predictions, present the result and discuss it both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, comparing it with daily experience. We let\nthe student notice that assuming a non-spherical Earth would result in a\nparallel component of the gravitational acceleration, in disagreement with\nmeasurement; moreover, in case we consider a disk-shaped Earth we show that\nthis parallel component becomes more and more important as the boundaries of\nEarth are approached by an observer. Finally, we make quantitative predictions\non how this abnormal component of the gravitational force would affect the free\nfall motion. We think that the topics discussed here can be presented both in\nhigh school and university classes of general physics, as well as in\nintroductory classes about the scientific method.\n", "  As first noted by Rafael Sorkin, there is a limit to quantum interference.\nThe interference pattern formed in a multi-slit experiment is a function of the\ninterference patterns formed between pairs of slits, there are no genuinely new\nfeatures resulting from considering three slits instead of two. Sorkin has\nintroduced a hierarchy of mathematically conceivable higher-order interference\nbehaviours, where classical theory lies at the first level of this hierarchy\nand quantum theory theory at the second. Informally, the order in this\nhierarchy corresponds to the number of slits on which the interference pattern\nhas an irreducible dependence. Many authors have wondered why quantum\ninterference is limited to the second level of this hierarchy. Does the\nexistence of higher-order interference violate some natural physical principle\nthat we believe should be fundamental? In the current work we show that such\nprinciples can be found which limit interference behaviour to second-order, or\n\"quantum-like\", interference, but that do not restrict us to the entire quantum\nformalism. We work within the operational framework of generalised\nprobabilistic theories, and prove that any theory satisfying Causality, Purity\nPreservation, Pure Sharpness, and Purification---four principles that formalise\nthe fundamental character of purity in nature---exhibits at most second-order\ninterference. Hence these theories are, at least conceptually, very \"close\" to\nquantum theory. Along the way we show that systems in such theories correspond\nto Euclidean Jordan algebras. Hence, they are self-dual and, moreover,\nmulti-slit experiments in such theories are described by pure projectors.\n", "  The temperature evolution of spin relaxation time, {\\tau}sf, in degenerate\nsilicon (Si)-based lateral spin valves is investigated by means of the Hanle\neffect measurements. {\\tau}sf at 300 K is estimated to be 1.68+-0.03 ns and\nmonotonically increased with decreasing temperature down to 100 K. Below 100 K,\nin contrast, it shows almost a constant value of ca. 5 ns. The temperature\ndependence of the conductivity of the Si channel shows a similar behavior to\nthat of the {\\tau}sf, i.e., monotonically increasing with decreasing\ntemperature down to 100 K and a weak temperature dependence below 100 K. The\ntemperature evolution of conductivity reveals that electron scattering due to\nmagnetic impurities is negligible. A comparison between {\\tau}sf and momentum\nscattering time reveals that the dominant spin scattering mechanism in the Si\nis the Elliott-Yafet mechanism, and the ratio of the momentum scattering time\nto the {\\tau}sf attributed to nonmagnetic impurities is approximately\n3.77*10^-6, which is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than that of\ncopper.\n", "  We studied the spin injection in a NiFe(Py)/Si system using broadband\nferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The Gilbert damping parameter of the Py\nlayer on top of the Si channel was determined as a function of the Si doping\nconcentration and Py layer thickness. For fixed Py thickness we observed an\nincrease of the Gilbert damping parameter with decreasing resistivity of the Si\nchannel. For a fixed Si doping concentration we measured an increasing Gilbert\ndamping parameter for decreasing Py layer thickness. No increase of the Gilbert\ndamping parameter was found Py/Si samples with an insulating interlayer. We\nattribute our observations to an enhanced spin injection into the\nlow-resistivity Si by spin pumping.\n", "  The exciton spin dynamics are investigated both experimentally and\ntheoretically in two-monolayer-thick GaAs/AlAs quantum wells with an indirect\nband gap and a type-II band alignment. The magnetic-field-induced circular\npolarization of photoluminescence, $P_c$, is studied as function of the\nmagnetic field strength and direction as well as sample temperature. The\nobserved nonmonotonic behaviour of these functions is provided by the interplay\nof bright and dark exciton states contributing to the emission. To interpret\nthe experiment, we have developed a kinetic master equation model which\naccounts for the dynamics of the spin states in this exciton quartet, radiative\nand nonradiative recombination processes, and redistribution of excitons\nbetween these states as result of spin relaxation. The model offers\nquantitative agreement with experiment and allows us to evaluate, for the\nstudied structure, the heavy-hole $g$ factor, $g_{hh}=+3.5$, and the spin\nrelaxation times of electron, $\\tau_{se} = 33~\\mu$s, and hole, $\\tau_{sh} =\n3~\\mu$s, bound in the exciton.\n", "  The combined all-electron and two-step approach is applied to calculate the\nmolecular parameters which are required to interpret the ongoing experiment to\nsearch for the effects of manifestation of the T,P-odd fundamental interactions\nin the HfF$^+$ cation by Cornell/Ye group [Science 342, 1220 (2013); J. Mol.\nSpectrosc. 300, 12 (2014)]. The effective electric field that is required to\ninterpret the experiment in terms of the electron electric dipole moment is\nfound to be 22.5 GV/cm. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. D 89, 056006 (2014)] it was shown\nthat another source of T,P-odd interaction, the scalar-pseudoscalar\nnucleus-electron interaction with the dimensionless strength constant $k_{T,P}$\ncan dominate over the direct contribution from the electron EDM within the\nstandard model and some of its extensions. Therefore, for the comprehensive and\ncorrect interpretation of the HfF$^+$ experiment one should also know the\nmolecular parameter $W_{T,P}$ the value of which is reported here to be 20.1\nkHz.\n", "  A repulsive Hubbard model with both spin-asymmetric hopping (${t_\\uparrow\\neq\nt_\\downarrow}$) and a staggered potential (of strength $\\Delta$) is studied in\none dimension. The model is a compound of the mass-imbalanced (${t_\\uparrow\\neq\nt_\\downarrow}$, ${\\Delta=0}$) and ionic (${t_\\uparrow = t_\\downarrow}$,\n${\\Delta>0}$) Hubbard models, and may be realized by cold atoms in engineered\noptical lattices. We use mostly mean-field theory to determine the phases and\nphase transitions in the ground state for a half-filled band (one particle per\nsite). We find that a period-two modulation of the particle (or charge) density\nand an alternating spin density coexist for arbitrary Hubbard interaction\nstrength, ${U\\geqslant 0}$. The amplitude of the charge modulation is largest\nat ${U=0}$, decreases with increasing $U$ and tends to zero for\n${U\\rightarrow\\infty}$. The amplitude for spin alternation increases with $U$\nand tends to saturation for ${U\\rightarrow\\infty}$. Charge order dominates\nbelow a critical value $U_c$, whereas magnetic order dominates above. The\nmean-field Hamiltonian has two gap parameters, $\\Delta_\\uparrow$ and\n$\\Delta_\\downarrow$, which have to be determined self-consistently. For\n${U<U_c}$ both parameters are positive, for ${U>U_c}$ they have different\nsigns, and for ${U=U_c}$ one gap parameter jumps from a positive to a negative\nvalue. The weakly first-order phase transition at $U_c$ can be interpreted in\nterms of an avoided criticality (or metallicity). The system is reluctant to\nrestore a symmetry that has been broken explicitly.\n", "  The interplay between the action-reaction principle and the energy-momentum\nconservation law is revealed by the examples of the Maxwell-Lorentz and\nYang-Mills-Wong theories, and general relativity. These two statements are\nshown to be equivalent in the sense that both hold or fail together. Their\nmutual agreement is demonstrated most clearly in the self-interaction problem\nby taking account of the rearrangement of degrees of freedom appearing in the\naction of the Maxwell-Lorentz and Yang-Mills-Wong theories. The failure of\nenergy-momentum conservation in general relativity is attributed to the fact\nthat this theory allows solutions having nontrivial topologies. The total\nenergy and momentum of a system with nontrivial topological content is found to\nbe ambiguous, coordintization-dependent quantities. For example, the energy of\na Schwarzschild black hole may take any positive value greater than, or equal\nto, the mass of the body whose collapse is responsible for arising this black\nhole. We draw the analogy to the paradoxial Banach-Tarski theorem; the measure\nbecomes a poorly defined concept if initial three-dimensional bounded sets are\nrearranged in topologically nontrivial ways through the action of free\nnon-Abelian isometry groups.\n", "  The three-disk scatterer has served as a paradigm for semiclassical periodic\norbit quantization of classical chaotic systems using Gutzwiller's trace\nformula. It represents an open quantum system, thus leading to spectra of\ncomplex eigenenergies. An interesting general feature of open quantum systems\ndescribed by non-Hermitian operators is the possible existence of exceptional\npoints where not only the complex eigenvalues but also their respective\neigenvectors coincide. Using Gutzwiller's periodic orbit theory we show that\nexceptional points exist in a three-disk scatterer if the system's geometry is\nmodified by extending the system from circular to elliptical disks. The\nextension is implemented in such a way that the system's characteristic\n$C_{3\\mathrm{v}}$ symmetry is preserved. The two-dimensional parameter plane of\nthe system is then spanned by the distance between and the excentricity of the\nelliptical disks. As typical signatures of exceptional points we observe the\npermutation of two resonances when an exceptional point is encircled in\nparameter space, and a non-Lorentzian resonance line shape in the weighted\ndensity of states.\n", "  A generalized notion of a nonlocal tensor order parameter is introduced\nwithin the framework of the phenomenological approach. This parameter has the\nform of a traceless tensor correlation function or a tensor integral operator.\nBased on this form, the governing relations are written, which determine the\nsteady states and phase transitions of the deformed liquid crystal. Linear\nrelations for eigenfunctions of the introduced operator are derived. A\nprincipal drawback of currently available models of liquid crystals based on\nthe local presentation of the tensor order parameter (equality of two Frank\nconstants in the case of a quadratic form of the strain part of the free\nenergy) is eliminated. Particular examples are considered, which demonstrate\nthe model workability and the absence of contradictions in the model as well as\nits adequacy when describing small-scale structures.\n", "  Photoelectron angular distributions following the non-resonant two-photon\nK-shell ionization of neutral atoms are studied theoretically. Using the\nindependent particle approximation and relativistic second-order perturbation\ntheory, the contributions of screening and relativistic effects to the\nphotoelectron angular distribution are evaluated. A simple nonrelativistic\nexpression is presented for the angle-differential cross section in dipole\napproximation for two-photon ionization by elliptically polarized photons, and\nits limitations are analyzed numerically. Moreover, we show that screening\neffects of the inactive electrons can significantly affect the photoelectron\ndistributions and can also lead to a strong elliptical dichroism. Numerical\nresults are resented for the case of two-photon K-shell ionization of neutral\nNe, Ge, Xe, and U atoms.\n", "  Since 2013 IceCube cascade showers sudden overabundance have shown a fast\nflavor change above 30-60 TeV up to PeV energy. This flavor change from\ndominant muon tracks at TeVs to shower events at higher energies, has been\nindebted to a new injection of a neutrino astronomy. However the recent\npublished 54 neutrino HESE, high energy starting events, as well as the 38\nexternal muon tracks made by trough going muon formed around the IceCube, none\nof them are pointing to any expected X-gamma or radio sources: no one in\nconnection to GRB, no toward active BL Lac, neither to AGN source in Fermi\ncatalog. No clear correlation with nearby mass distribution (Local Group), nor\nto galactic plane. Moreover there have not been any record (among a dozen of\n200 TeV energetic events) of the expected double bang due to the tau neutrino\nbirth and decay. An amazing and surprising unfair distribution in flavor versus\nexpected democratic one. Finally there is not a complete consistence of the\ninternal HESE event spectra and the external crossing muon track ones. Moreover\nthe apparent sudden astrophysical neutrino flux rise at 60 TeV might be\nprobably also suddenly cut at a few PeV in order to hide the (unobserved , yet)\nGlashow resonance peak at 6.3 PeV. A more mondane prompt charmed atmospheric\nneutrino component may explain most of the IceCube puzzles. If this near\nfuture, 2017-2018, it does not shine tau neutrino signals somewhere (by tau\nairshowers in AUGER, TA, ASHRA or double bang in IceCube) there are a list of\nconsequences to face. These missing correlations and in particular the tau\nsignature absence force us to claim : No Tau? No neutrino Astronomy.\n", "  We improve on the model of the Galactic Magnetic Field (GMF) from Jansson \\&\nFarrar (2012), which was constrained using all-sky rotation measures of\nextragalactic sources and polarized and unpolarized synchrotron emission data\nfrom WMAP. We have developed several alternative functional forms for the\ncoherent and random components, used newer synchrotron products from Planck and\nWMAP and testes new models of the densities of thermal electrons and cosmic-ray\nelectrons. The differences in the resultant GMF models, depending on which\nparameterization of the field, synchrotron product and electron densities are\nused, provides a measure of the uncertainty in our inference of the GMF. We\ndiscuss the impact of these uncertainties on charged-particle astronomy at\nultra-high energies.\n", "  The formation of stable products of water decomposition under laser exposure\nof aqueous colloidal solutions of nanoparticles is experimentally studied.\nLaser exposure of colloidal solutions leads to formation of H2, O2, and H2O2.\nThe dependence of the yield of these products depends on the energy density of\nlaser radiation inside the liquid and concentration of nanoparticles. The ratio\nH2/O2 depends on laser fluence and is shifted towards H2. There are at least to\nsources of H2O2, namely, laser-induced breakdown plasma and ultrasound induced\nby laser pulses in the liquid. The formation of both H2 and O2 is tentatively\nassigned to direct dissociation of H2O molecules by electron impact from\nlaser-induced plasma.\n", "  Conjugated organic molecules represent an important area of materials\nchemistry for both fundamental scientific exploration and technological\napplications. Using a genetic algorithm to computationally screen up to ~25-50\nmillion molecules for organic photovoltaic properties, we find that our methods\nfind top monomers 6,000-8,000 times faster than brute force search. By testing\nmultiple runs and establishing convergence criteria, we show the computational\nscaling with search space size, common molecular motifs, and discuss the\nreliability to choose the same molecules independent of initial data set size.\nWe outline remaining areas of difficulty in growing to larger search spaces,\npotential solutions, and filtering criteria for potential organic photovoltaic\nmaterials. Efficient genetic algorithm searches promise to address a wide range\nof property-driven inverse design problems in chemistry.\n", "  We introduce the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model, which aims at becoming\nthe white-box version of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The DSN model provides a\nsimple, universal yet powerful structure, similar to DNN, to represent any\nknowledge of the world, which is transparent to humans. The conjecture behind\nthe DSN model is that any type of real world objects sharing enough common\nfeatures are mapped into human brains as a symbol. Those symbols are connected\nby links, representing the composition, correlation, causality, or other\nrelationships between them, forming a deep, hierarchical symbolic network\nstructure. Powered by such a structure, the DSN model is expected to learn like\nhumans, because of its unique characteristics. First, it is universal, using\nthe same structure to store any knowledge. Second, it can learn symbols from\nthe world and construct the deep symbolic networks automatically, by utilizing\nthe fact that real world objects have been naturally separated by\nsingularities. Third, it is symbolic, with the capacity of performing causal\ndeduction and generalization. Fourth, the symbols and the links between them\nare transparent to us, and thus we will know what it has learned or not - which\nis the key for the security of an AI system. Fifth, its transparency enables it\nto learn with relatively small data. Sixth, its knowledge can be accumulated.\nLast but not least, it is more friendly to unsupervised learning than DNN. We\npresent the details of the model, the algorithm powering its automatic learning\nability, and describe its usefulness in different use cases. The purpose of\nthis paper is to generate broad interest to develop it within an open source\nproject centered on the Deep Symbolic Network (DSN) model towards the\ndevelopment of general AI.\n", "  Wigner's little groups are the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose\ntransformations leave the momentum of a given particle invariant. They thus\ndefine the internal space-time symmetries of relativistic particles. These\nsymmetries take different mathematical forms for massive and for massless\nparticles. However, it is shown possible to construct one unified\nrepresentation using a graphical description. This graphical approach allows us\nto describe vividly parity, time reversal, and charge conjugation of the\ninternal symmetry groups. As for the language of group theory, the two-by-two\nrepresentation is used throughout the paper. While this two-by-two\nrepresentation is for spin-1/2 particles, it is shown possible to construct the\nrepresentations for spin-0 particles, spin-1 particles, as well as for\nhigher-spin particles, for both massive and massless cases. It is shown also\nthat the four-by-four Dirac matrices constitute a two-by-two representation of\nWigner's little group.\n", "  Continuous-wave mode-locked femtosecond 2 um solid-state laser with a c-cut\nTm:CaYAlO4 as gain medium was experimentally demonstrated. The mode locked\nlaser generated stable pulses with average output power as high as 531 mW,\npulse duration of 496 fs, and repetition rate of 97 MHz at 1975 nm. The\nresearch results show that Tm:CaYAlO4 is an excellent gain medium for\nfemtosecond pulse generation at 2um wavelength.\n", "  Long known to have thermodynamic properties at odds with its insulating\nelectrical transport, SmB6 has been the subject of great debate as it is\nunclear whether its unusual properties are related to the bulk or novel\nmetallic surface states. We have observed a bulk moment-screening effect in\nnominally pure and Gd-doped SmB6 via heat capacity, magnetization, and\nresistivity measurements, and show this new Kondo-impurity like effect provides\nan unexpected but intuitive explanation for metal-like phenomena stemming from\nthe strongly interacting host system. This affords a coherent understanding for\ndecades of mysteries in strongly-correlated insulators, reveals the expanded\nutility of techniques previously only utilized for metals, and presents the\nnovel effect of even highly-dilute impurities in strongly correlated\ninsulators.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to present the first data set obtained with SOAR\nAdaptive Module-Fabry-Parot (SAM-FP), a Fabry-Perot instrument mounted inside\nthe SOAR telescope Adaptive-Optics Module. This is the only existing imaging\nFabry-Perot interferometer using laser-assisted ground-layer adaptive optics.\nSAM-FP was used to observe the ionized gas, traced by Halpha, in the centre of\nthe 30 Doradus starburst (the Tarantula Nebula) in the Large Magellanic Cloud,\nwith high spatial (~0.6\" or 0.15 pc) and spectral (R=11200) resolution. Radial\nvelocity, velocity dispersion and monochromatic maps were derived. The region\ndisplays a mix of narrow, sigma ~ 20 km/s profiles and multiple broader\nprofiles with sigma ~ 70-80 km/s, indicating the complex nature of the nebula\nkinematics. A comparison with previously obtained VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy\ndemonstrates that the data agree well in the regions of overlap, but the\nFabry-Perot data are superior in spatial coverage. A preliminary analysis of\nthe observations finds a new expanding bubble south of R136, with a projected\nradius of r=5.6 pc and an expansion velocity of 29 +/- 4 km/s. In addition, the\nfirst-time detailed kinematic maps derived here for several complexes and\nfilaments of 30 Doradus allow identification of kinematically independent\nstructures. These data exemplify the power of the combination of a high-order\nFabry-Perot with a wide-field imager (3' x 3' GLAO-corrected field of view) for\nhigh-resolution spatial and spectral studies. In particular, SAM-FP data cubes\nare highly advantageous over multifibre or long-slit data sets for nebula\nstructure studies and to search for small-scale bubbles, given their greatly\nimproved spatial coverage. For reference, this paper also presents two\nappendices with detailed descriptions of the usage of Fabry-Perot devices,\nincluding formulae and explanations for understanding Fabry-Perot observations.\n", "  In this article we present coherent control of above-threshold photoemission\nfrom a tungsten nanotip achieving nearly perfect modulation. Depending on the\npulse delay between fundamental (1560 nm) and second harmonic (780 nm) pulses\nof a femtosecond fiber laser at the nanotip, electron emission is significantly\nenhanced or depressed during temporal overlap. Electron emission is studied as\na function of pulse delay, optical near-field intensities, DC bias field, and\nfinal photoelectron energy. Under optimized conditions modulation amplitudes of\nthe electron emission of 97.5% are achieved. Experimental observations are\ndiscussed in the framework of quantum- pathway interference supported by local\ndensity of states (LDOS) simulations.\n", "  This study presents a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method with\nPeng-Robinson equation of state for simulating drop vaporization and drop\nimpact on a hot surface. The conservation equations of momentum and energy and\nPeng-Robinson equation of state are applied to describe both the liquid and gas\nphases. The governing equations are solved numerically by the SPH method. The\nphase change between the liquid and gas phases are simulated directly without\nusing any phase change models. The numerical method is validated by comparing\nnumerical results with analytical solutions for the vaporization of n-heptane\ndrops at different temperatures. Using the SPH method, the processes of\nn-heptane drops impacting on a solid wall with different temperatures are\nstudied numerically. The results show that the size of the film formed by drop\nimpact decreases when temperature increases. When the temperature is high\nenough, the drop will rebound.\n", "  We propose a generalization of pseudospin and spin symmetries, the SU(2)\nsymmetries of Dirac equation with scalar and vector mean-field potentials\noriginally found independently in the 70's by Smith and Tassie, and Bell and\nRuegg. As relativistic symmetries, they have been extensively researched and\napplied to several physical systems for the last 18 years. The main feature of\nthese symmetries is the suppression of the spin-orbit coupling either in the\nupper or lower components of the Dirac spinor, thereby turning the respective\nsecond-order equations into Schr\\\"odinger-like equations, i.e, without a matrix\nstructure. In this paper we use the original formalism of Bell and Ruegg to\nderive general requirements for the Lorentz structures of potentials in order\nto have these SU(2) symmetries in the Dirac equation, again allowing for the\nsuppression of the matrix structure of the second-order equation of either the\nupper or lower components of the Dirac spinor. Furthermore, we derive\nequivalent conditions for spin and pseudospin symmetries with 2- and\n1-dimensional potentials and list some possible candidates for 3, 2, and 1\ndimensions. We suggest applications for physical systems in three and two\ndimensions, namely electrons in graphene.\n", "  ZrSe2 is a band semiconductor studied long time ago. It has interesting\nelectronic properties, and because its layers structure can be intercalated\nwith different atoms to change some of the physical properties. In this\ninvestigation we found that Zr deficiencies alter the semiconducting behavior\nand the compound can be turned into a superconductor. In this paper we report\nour studies related to this discovery. The decreasing of the number of Zr atoms\nin small proportion according to the formula ZrxSe2, where x is varied from\nabout 8.1 to 8.6 K, changing the semiconducting behavior to a superconductor\nwith transition temperatures ranging between 7.8 to 8.5 K, it depending of the\ndeficiencies. Outside of those ranges the compound behaves as semiconducting\nwith the properties already known. In our experiments we found that this new\nsuperconductor has only a very small fraction of superconducting material\ndetermined by magnetic measurements with applied magnetic field of 10 Oe. Our\nconclusions is that superconductivity is filamentary. However, in one studied\nsample the fraction was about 10.2 %, whereas in others is only about 1 % or\nless. We determined the superconducting characteristics; the critical fields\nthat indicate a type two superonductor with Ginzburg-Landau ? parameter of the\norder about 2.7. The synthesis procedure is quite normal fol- lowing the\nconventional solid state reaction. In this paper are included, the electronic\ncharacteristics, transition temperature, and evolution with temperature of the\ncritical fields.\n", "  We have searched for transient and/or variable radio sources in the field of\nGalactic micro-quasar Cygnus X-1 in 1.4 GHz (L band) using data from the Karl\nG. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). We used twenty years of data between 1983\nand 2003. We found a source J195754+353513 showing transient behavior. The\nsource was also mentioned earlier in NVSS and WENSS catalog but its transient\nnature was not reported earlier. The source is located 23.8 arcminutes far from\nCygnus X-1. It is detected many times during the span of our study and it\nvaried between less than 0.3 mJy to 201 mJy. J195754+353513 also showed high\nintra-day variability. In one occasion, the source rose from ~20 mJy to ~180\nmJy 700 second. For limited number of cases circularly polarized emission could\nbe detected from the source with V/I vary between 0.15 to 0.25. 2MASS\nJ19575420+3535152 may be the near-infrared counterpart of the source. We\ncompared the properties of the source with other Galactic transient sources\nhaving similar properties. The nature of the source is still unknown. We\nspeculate on its possible nature.\n", "  In this paper, we compare the radio emission at 1.4 GHz with optical outflow\nsignatures of edge-on galaxies. We report observations of six edge-on\nstar-forming galaxies in the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral-field\nspectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey with 1.4 GHz luminosities $> 1\\times10^{21}$\nW Hz$^{-1}$. Extended minor axis optical emission is detected with enhanced\n\\nii/H$\\alpha$ line ratios and velocity dispersions consistent with galactic\nwinds in three of six galaxies. These galaxies may host outflows driven by a\ncombination of thermal and cosmic ray processes. We find that galaxies with the\nstrongest wind signatures have extended radio morphologies. Our results form a\nbaseline for understanding the driving mechanisms of galactic winds.\n", "  The yield surface in crystal plasticity can be approached from various\ndirections during mechanical loading. We consider the competition between\nnanoindentation and tensile loading towards plastic yielding. For this purpose,\nwe develop a two-dimensional discrete dislocation model that is then utilized\nto investigate the hardness and pop-in event statistics during nanoindentation\nof single crystal under tensile pre-stress. Indentation is performed by using\ncylindrical (circular in 2D) indentation with varying radius and under both\ndisplacement and load control. Tensile in-plane stress, varying from zero to\nyield strength, is assigned to investigate the effect of pre-stress on hardness\nand pop-in statistics. At small indentation depths, the measured hardness is\nfound to be smaller for larger tensile pre-stress; therefore, we conclude that\nnanoindentation can be used to detect plasticity. When indentation depth is\nlarger, the effect of pre-stress is barely seen. Moreover, we discuss event\nstatistics and the related effect of pre-stress.\n", "  High entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as a new class of multicomponent\nmaterials, which have potential for high temperature applications. Phase\nstability and creep deformation, two key selection criteria for high\ntemperature materials, are predominantly influenced by the diffusion of\nconstituent elements along the grain boundaries (GBs). For the first time, GB\ndiffusion of Ni in chemically homogeneous CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeMnNi HEAs is\nmeasured by radiotracer analysis using the $^{63}$Ni isotope. Atom probe\ntomography confirmed the absence of elemental segregation at GBs that allowed\nreliable estimation of the GB width to be about 0.5 nm. Our GB diffusion\nmeasurements prove that a mere increase in number of constituent elements does\nnot lower the diffusion rates in HEAs, but the nature of added constituents\nplays a more decisive role. The GB energies in both HEAs are estimated at about\n0.8-0.9 J/m$^2$, they are found to increase significantly with temperature and\nthe effect is more pronounced for the CoCrFeMnNi alloy.\n", "  We propose two types of stochastic extensions of nonholonomic constraints for\nmechanical systems. Our approach relies on a stochastic extension of the\nLagrange-d'Alembert framework. We consider in details the case of invariant\nnonholonomic systems on the group of rotations and on the special Euclidean\ngroup. Based on this, we then develop two types of stochastic deformations of\nthe Suslov problem and study the possibility of extending to the stochastic\ncase the preservation of some of its integrals of motion such as the Kharlamova\nor Clebsch-Tisserand integrals.\n", "  We study the local unitary equivalence for two and three-qubit mixed states\nby investigating the invariants under local unitary transformations. For\ntwo-qubit system, we prove that the determination of the local unitary\nequivalence of 2-qubits states only needs 14 or less invariants for arbitrary\ntwo-qubit states. Using the same method, we construct invariants for\nthree-qubit mixed states.\n  We prove that these invariants are sufficient to guarantee the LU equivalence\nof certain kind of three-qubit states. Also, we make a comparison with earlier\nworks.\n", "  A central question in ecology is to understand the ecological processes that\nshape community structure. Niche-based theories have emphasized the important\nrole played by competition for maintaining species diversity. Many of these\ninsights have been derived using MacArthur's consumer resource model (MCRM) or\nits generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small\necosystems with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights\nderived from small ecosystems many not scale up large ecosystems with many\nresources and species because large systems with many interacting components\noften display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from\nanalyzing smaller systems. To address this shortcoming, we develop a\nsophisticated statistical physics inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when\nboth the number of species and the number of resources is large. We find that\nin this limit, species generically and consistently perturb their environments\nand significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity\napproach naturally generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting\nfor the effect of this emergent environmental engineering on species invasion\nand ecological stability. Our work suggests that environmental engineering is a\ngeneric feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account\nwhen analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the\nimportant role that statistical-physics inspired approaches can play in\nfurthering our understanding of ecology.\n", "  Sensors often serve at least two purposes: predicting their input and\nminimizing dissipated heat. However, determining whether or not a particular\nsensor is evolved or designed to be accurate and efficient is difficult. This\narises partly from the functional constraints being at cross purposes and\npartly since quantifying the predictive performance of even in silico sensors\ncan require prohibitively long simulations. To circumvent these difficulties,\nwe develop expressions for the predictive accuracy and thermodynamic costs of\nthe broad class of conditionally Markovian sensors subject to unifilar hidden\nsemi-Markov (memoryful) environmental inputs. Predictive metrics include the\ninstantaneous memory and the mutual information between present sensor state\nand input future, while dissipative metrics include power consumption and the\nnonpredictive information rate. Success in deriving these formulae relies\nheavily on identifying the environment's causal states, the input's minimal\nsufficient statistics for prediction. Using these formulae, we study the\nsimplest nontrivial biological sensor model---that of a Hill molecule,\ncharacterized by the number of ligands that bind simultaneously, the sensor's\ncooperativity. When energetic rewards are proportional to total predictable\ninformation, the closest cooperativity that optimizes the total energy budget\ngenerally depends on the environment's past hysteretically. In this way, the\nsensor gains robustness to environmental fluctuations. Given the simplicity of\nthe Hill molecule, such hysteresis will likely be found in more complex\npredictive sensors as well. That is, adaptations that only locally optimize\nbiochemical parameters for prediction and dissipation can lead to sensors that\n\"remember\" the past environment.\n", "  Fine-tuning in physics and cosmology is often used as evidence that a theory\nis incomplete. For example, the parameters of the standard model of particle\nphysics are \"unnaturally\" small (in various technical senses), which has driven\nmuch of the search for physics beyond the standard model. Of particular\ninterest is the fine-tuning of the universe for life, which suggests that our\nuniverse's ability to create physical life forms is improbable and in need of\nexplanation, perhaps by a multiverse. This claim has been challenged on the\ngrounds that the relevant probability measure cannot be justified because it\ncannot be normalized, and so small probabilities cannot be inferred. We show\nhow fine-tuning can be formulated within the context of Bayesian theory testing\n(or \\emph{model selection}) in the physical sciences. The normalizability\nproblem is seen to be a general problem for testing any theory with free\nparameters, and not a unique problem for fine-tuning. Physical theories in fact\navoid such problems in one of two ways. Dimensional parameters are bounded by\nthe Planck scale, avoiding troublesome infinities, and we are not compelled to\nassume that dimensionless parameters are distributed uniformly, which avoids\nnon-normalizability.\n", "  In this article, we study the renormalization group equations of the\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and investigate universality\nconditions on the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters at the Grand\nUnification scale. We demonstrate that the inclusion of right-handed neutrino\nsuperfields can have a substantial effect on the running of the soft terms\n(greatly contributing to driving the singlet Higgs mass- squared parameter\nnegative), which makes it considerably easier to satisfy the conditions for\nradiative electroweak symmetry-breaking. The new fields also lead to larger\nvalues of the Standard Model Higgs mass, thus making it easier to reproduce the\nmeasured value. We investigate the phenomenology of this constrained scenario,\nand focus on two viable benchmark points, which feature a neutral lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (either the lightest neutralino or the right-handed\nsneutrino). We show that all bounds from colliders and low-energy observables\ncan be fulfilled in wide areas of the parameter space. However, the relic\ndensity in these regions is generally too high requiring some form of late\nentropy production to dilute the density of the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle.\n", "  Quon language is a 3D picture language that we can apply to simulate\nmathematical concepts. We introduce the surface algebras as an extension of the\nnotion of planar algebras to higher genus surface. We prove that there is a\nunique one-parameter extension. The 2D defects on the surfaces are quons, and\nsurface tangles are transformations. We use quon language to simulate graphic\nstates that appear in quantum information, and to simulate interesting\nquantities in modular tensor categories. This simulation relates the pictorial\nFourier duality of surface tangles and the algebraic Fourier duality induced by\nthe S matrix of the modular tensor category. The pictorial Fourier duality also\ncoincides with the graphic duality on the sphere. For each pair of dual graphs,\nwe obtain an algebraic identity related to the $S$ matrix. These identities\ninclude well-known ones, such as the Verlinde formula; partially known ones,\nsuch as the 6j-symbol self-duality; and completely new ones.\n", "  Computer modeling can provide quantitative insight into cardiac fluid\ndynamics phenomena that are not evident from standard imaging tools. We propose\na new approach to modeling left ventricle fluid dynamics based on an\nimage-driven model-based description of ventricular motion. In this approach,\nthe end-diastolic geometry and time-dependent deformation of the left ventricle\ncavity are obtained from cardiac magnetic resonance images and a fictitious\nelastic structure is used to impose the contractile behavior of the left\nventricle. This allows seamless treatment of the isovolumic phases. Besides the\nventricular motion, the intracavitary fluid dynamics is controlled by the\nmitral valve. Three different mitral valve models are included in the\nsimulation: an idealized diode (with or without regurgitation) and a lumped\nparameter model accounting for the opening dynamics of the valve and including\nregurgitation.\n", "  Magnetoelectric (ME) effect, the phenomenon of inducing magnetization by\napplication of an electric field or vice versa, holds great promise for\nmagnetic sensing and switching applications. Studies of the ME effect have so\nfar focused on the control of the electron spin degree of freedom (DOF) in\nmaterials such as multiferroics and conventional semiconductors. Here, we\nreport a new form of the ME effect based on the valley DOF in two-dimensional\n(2D) Dirac materials. By breaking the three-fold rotational symmetry in\nsingle-layer MoS2 via a uniaxial stress, we have demonstrated the pure\nelectrical generation of valley magnetization in this material, and its direct\nimaging by Kerr rotation microscopy. The observed out-of-plane magnetization is\nindependent of in-plane magnetic field, linearly proportional to the in-plane\ncurrent density, and optimized when the current is orthogonal to the\nstrain-induced piezoelectric field. These results are fully consistent with a\ntheoretical model of valley magnetoelectricity driven by Berry curvature\neffects. Furthermore, the effect persists at room temperature, opening\npossibilities for practical valleytronic devices.\n", "  In this work, we present a highly efficient quantitative phase imaging (QPI)\napproach using programmable annular LED illumination based on traditional\nbright-field microscope. As a new type of coded illumination, the LED array\nprovides a flexible and compatible way to realize QPI. The proposed method\nmodulates the transfer function of system by changing the LED illumination\npattern, which achieves twice resolution of objective NA and gives noise-robust\nresponse of transfer function. The phase of a sample could be recovered from\nthe intensity images with the inversion of transfer function. Moreover, the\nweak object transfer function (WOTF) of axisymmetric oblique source is derived,\nand the noise-free and noisy simulation results sufficiently validate the\napplicability of discrete annular source. The quantitative phase measurements\nof micro polystyrene bead and visible blazed transmission grating demonstrate\nthe accuracy of proposed method. Finally, the experimental investigations of\nunstained human cancer cells using different types objective are presented, and\nthese results show the possibility of widespread adoption of QPI in the\nmorphology study of cellular processes and biomedical community.\n", "  We introduce and explore the relation between knot invariants and quiver\nrepresentation theory, which follows from the identification of quiver quantum\nmechanics in D-brane systems representing knots. We identify various structural\nproperties of quivers associated to knots, and identify such quivers explicitly\nin many examples, including some infinite families of knots, all knots up to 6\ncrossings, and some knots with thick homology. Moreover, based on these\nproperties, we derive previously unknown expressions for colored HOMFLY-PT\npolynomials and superpolynomials for various knots. For all knots, for which we\nidentify the corresponding quivers, the LMOV conjecture for all symmetric\nrepresentations (i.e. integrality of relevant BPS numbers) is automatically\nproved.\n", "  A simplified, but non trivial, mechanical model -- gas of $N$ particles of\nmass $m$ in a box partitioned by $n$ mobile adiabatic walls of mass $M$ --\ninteracting with two thermal baths at different temperatures, is discussed in\nthe framework of kinetic theory. Following an approach due to Smoluchowski,\nfrom an analysis of the collisions particles/walls, we derive the values of the\nmain thermodynamic quantities for the stationary non-equilibrium states. The\nresults are compared with extensive numerical simulations; in the limit of\nlarge $n$, $mN/M\\gg 1$ and $m/M \\ll 1$, we find a good approximation of\nFourier's law.\n", "  The interplay of competing orders is relevant to high-temperature\nsuperconductivity known to emerge upon suppression of a parent\nantiferromagnetic order typically via charge doping. How such interplay evolves\nat low temperature---in particular at what doping level the zero-temperature\nquantum critical point (QCP) is located---is still elusive because it is masked\nby the superconducting state. The QCP had long been believed to follow a smooth\nextrapolation of the characteristic temperature $T^*$ for the strange normal\nstate well above the superconducting transition temperature. However, recently\nthe $T^*$ within the superconducting dome was reported to unexpectedly exhibit\nback-bending likely in the cuprate Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta}$.\nHere we show that the original and revised phase diagrams can be understood in\nterms of weak and moderate competitions, respectively, between\nsuperconductivity and a pseudogap state such as $d$-density-wave or\nspin-density-wave, based on both Ginzburg-Landau theory and the realistic\n$t$-$t^{\\prime}$-$t^{\\prime\\prime}$-$J$-$V$ model for the cuprates. We further\nfound that the calculated temperature and doping-level dependence of the\nquasiparticle spectral gap and Raman response qualitatively agrees with the\nexperiments. In particular, the $T^*$ back-bending can provide a simple\nexplanation of the observed anomalous two-step thermal evolution dominated by\nthe superconducting gap and the pseudogap, respectively. Our results imply that\nthe revised phase diagram is likely to take place in high-temperature\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Quantum confinement and interference often generate exotic properties in\nnanostructures. One recent highlight is the experimental indication of a\nmagnetic phase transition in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons at the critical\nribbon width of about 7 nm [G. Z. Magda et al., Nature \\textbf{514}, 608\n(2014)]. Here we show theoretically that with further increase in the ribbon\nwidth, the magnetic correlation of the two edges can exhibit an intriguing\noscillatory behavior between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic, driven by\nacquiring the positive coherence between the two edges to lower the free\nenergy. The oscillation effect is readily tunable in applied magnetic fields.\nThese novel properties suggest new experimental manifestation of the edge\nmagnetic orders in graphene nanoribbons, and enhance the hopes of graphene-like\nspintronic nanodevices functioning at room temperature.\n", "  An open-source library called EOF which provides efficient two-way coupling\nbetween the finite element multi-physics simulation software Elmer and\ncomputational fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM is presented. Library controls\ninterpolation and communication of fields between two codes. The main focus of\nthis code is industrial magnetohydrodynamics with free surface, but it can be\nextended to other 2D and 3D multi-physics problems. Simulation results for 2D\naxisymmetric problem of conductive fluid with free surface surrounded by\nalternate electromagnetic field created by inductor are compared with analogous\nsimulation results made by another author.\n", "  The spin filtering effect in the bilayer nanowire with quantum point contact\nis investigated theoretically. We demonstrate the new mechanism of the spin\nfiltering based on the lateral inter-subband spin-orbit coupling, which for the\nbilayer nanowires has been reported to be strong. The proposed spin filtering\neffect is explained as the joint effect of the Landau-Zener inter-subband\ntransitions caused by the hybridization of states with opposite spin (due to\nthe lateral Rashba SO interaction) and the confinement of carriers in the\nquantum point contact region.\n", "  In this paper, the influence of the fractional dimensions of the L\\'evy path\nunder the Earth's gravitational field is studied, and the phase transitions of\nenergy and wave functions are obtained: the energy changes from discrete to\ncontinuous and wave functions change from non-degenerate to degenerate when\ndimension of L\\'evy path becomes from integer to non-integer. By analyzing the\nphase transitions, we solve two popular problems. First, we find an exotic way\nto produce the bound states in the continuum (BICs), our approach only needs a\nsimple potential, and does not depend on interactions between particles.\nSecond, we address the continuity of the energy will become strong when the\nmass of the particle becomes small. By deeply analyze, it can provide a way to\ndistinguish ultralight particles from others types in the Earth's gravitational\nfield, and five popular particles are discussed. In addition, we obtain\nanalytical expressions for the wave functions and energy in the Earth's\ngravitational field in the circumstance of a fractional fractal dimensional\nL\\'evy path. Moreover, to consider the influence of the minimal length, we\nanalyze the phase transitions and the BICs in the presence of the minimal\nlength. We find the phenomenon energy shift do not exist, which is a common\nphenomenon in the presence of the minimal length, and hence such above\nphenomena can still be found. Finally, relations between our results and\nexisting results are discussed.\n", "  The nature of spin current and the separation of charge current and spin\ncurrent are two of the fundamental questions in spintronics. For this purpose\nthe classical limit of the Maxwell-Dirac theory is investigated in the present\ncontribution. Since the Dirac equation reduces to the Weyl equation for\nmassless particles, a vortex solution is obtained for the Weyl equation and it\nis argued that mass has stochastic origin. The Weyl vortex is embedded in a\nGaussian wavepacket to define physical vortex. Two-vortex internal structure of\nelectron is developed in terms of Weyl and sub-quantum Weyl vortices\ncharacterized by $\\hbar$ and $f=e^2/2\\pi c$ respectively. It is suggested that\nthis model may find application in spintronics with a new perspective.\n", "  The recent rapid progress in observations of circumstellar disks and\nextrasolar planets has reinforced the importance of understanding an intimate\ncoupling between star and planet formation. Under such a circumstance, it may\nbe invaluable to attempt to specify when and how planet formation begins in\nstar-forming regions and to identify what physical processes/quantities are the\nmost significant to make a link between star and planet formation. To this end,\nwe have recently developed a couple of projects. These include an observational\nproject about dust growth in Class 0 YSOs and a theoretical modeling project of\nthe HL Tauri disk. For the first project, we utilize the archive data of radio\ninterferometric observations, and examine whether dust growth, a first step of\nplanet formation, occurs in Class 0 YSOs. We find that while our observational\nresults can be reproduced by the presence of large ($\\sim$ mm) dust grains for\nsome of YSOs under the single-component modified blackbody formalism, an\ninterpretation of no dust growth would be possible when a more detailed model\nis used. For the second project, we consider an origin of the disk\nconfiguration around HL Tauri, focusing on magnetic fields. We find that\nmagnetically induced disk winds may play an important role in the HL Tauri\ndisk. The combination of these attempts may enable us to move towards a\ncomprehensive understanding of how star and planet formation are intimately\ncoupled with each other.\n", "  In this paper we study the formation of nanodrops on curved surfaces (both\nconvex and concave) by means of molecular dynamics simulations, where the\nparticles interact via a Lennard-Jones potential. We find that the contact\nangle is not affected by the curvature of the substrate, in agreement with\nprevious experimental findings. This means that the change in curvature of the\ndrop in response to the change in curvature of the substrate can be predicted\nfrom simple geometrical considerations, under the assumption that the drop's\nshape is a spherical cap, and that the volume remains unchanged through the\ncurvature. The resulting prediction is in perfect agreement with the simulation\nresults, for both convex and concave substrates. In addition, we calculate the\nline tension, namely by fitting the contact angle for different size drops to\nthe modified Young equation. We find that the line tension for concave surfaces\nis larger than for convex surfaces, while for zero curvature it has a clear\nmaximum. This feature is found to be correlated with the number of particles in\nthe first layer of the liquid on the surface.\n", "  In this paper a possibility of the accelerated expansion of the large scale\nuniverse with a varying polytropic fluid of a certain type is presented. About\na special role of non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark\nmatter, in particular, about a possibility of improvement and solution of\nproblems arising in modern cosmology, has been discussed for a long time. This\nmotivates us to consider new models, where non-gravitational interactions\nbetween varying polytropic fluid and cold dark matter are allowed. Mainly\nnon-linear interactions of a specific type is considered, found in recent\nliterature. In order to understand the behavior of suggested cosmological\nmodels, besides cosmographic analysis, $Om$ analysis is applied. Moreover, with\ndifferent datasets, including a strong gravitational lensing dataset, the\nobservational constraints on the model parameters are obtained using $\\chi^{2}$\nanalysis.\n", "  This paper presents a new wormhole solution by assuming that a homogeneously\ndistributed fluid with equation of state $p=\\omega\\rho$ can be adapted to an\nanisotropic spacetime such as a wormhole and that this spacetime admits a\none-parameter group of conformal motions. The pressure $p$ in the equation of\nstate becomes the lateral pressure $p_t$ instead of the radial pressure $p_r$,\nas assumed in previous studies. Given that $p_t=\\omega\\rho$, $p_r$ is then\ndetermined from the Einstein field equations. A wormhole solution can be\nobtained only if $\\omega <-1$ or $0<\\omega <1$. Since the former case\ncorresponds to phantom dark energy, which has been the subject of earlier\nstudies, we concentrate mainly on the latter. This case implies that given the\nabove conditions, dark matter can support traversable wormholes.\n", "  In this paper, we use the Killing vector method to formulate the de\nSitter/Anti-de Sitter invariant special relativity (dS/AdS-SR). Through solving\nthe Einstein equation with $\\Lambda\\neq 0$, the basic inertial metric for\ndS/AdS-SR is determined to be the Beltrami metric $B_{\\mu\\nu}(x)$. The\ncorresponding Killing equations are system of ten simultaneous partial\ndifferential equations of first order. Their most general solutions were\nobtained, and all the ten independent Killing vectors were found out. These\nresults confirm that the Beltrami metric has maximal spacetime symmetry. The\nten Killing-Noether charges are obtained. They are energy, momenta, Lorentz\nboost and angular momentum in SR-theory with $\\Lambda\\neq 0$. Consequently,\ndS/AdS-SR is consistently established for the vacuum with $\\Lambda\\neq 0$ via\nKilling vector method rather than the unpopular classical domain theory.\n", "  The current view about the mixing of heat and salt in the ocean is that it\nshould be parameterised by means of a rotated diffusion tensor based on mixing\ndirections parallel and perpendicular to the local neutral vector. However, the\nimpossibility to construct a density variable in the ocean that is exactly\nneutral because of the coupling between thermobaricity and density-compensated\ntemperature/salinity anomalies implies that the effective diapycnal diffusivity\nexperienced by any possible density variable is partly controlled by isoneutral\ndiffusion when using neutral rotated diffusion. Here, this effect is quantified\nby evaluating the effective diapycnal diffusion coefficient for five widely\nused density variables: Jackett and McDougall (1997) $\\gamma^n$, Lorenz\nreference state density $\\rho_{ref}$ of Winters et al. (1996), Saenz et al.\n(2015), and three potential density variables $\\sigma_0$, $\\sigma_2$ and\n$\\sigma_4$.Computations use the World Ocean Circulation Experiment climatology,\nassuming either a uniform value for isoneutral mixing or spatially varying\nvalues inferred from an inverse calculation. Isopycnal mixing contributions to\nthe effective diapycnal mixing yields values systematically larger than\n$10^{-3}$ $\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$ in the deep ocean for all density variables,\nwith $\\gamma^n$ suffering the least from the isoneutral control of effective\ndiapycnal mixing, and $\\sigma_0$ the most. These high values are due to\nspatially localised large values of non-neutrality, mostly in the deep Southern\nOcean. Removing only 5\\% of these high values on each density surface reduces\nthe effective diapycnal diffusivities to less than $10^{-4}$\n$\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$. This work highlights the potential pitfalls of\nestimating diapycnal diffusivities by means of Walin-like water masses analysis\nor in using Lorenz reference state for diagnosing spurious numerical diapycnal\nmixing.\n", "  The antisymmetrized quasi-cluster model (AQCM) was proposed to describe\n{\\alpha}-cluster and $jj$-coupling shell models on the same footing. In this\nmodel, the cluster-shell transition is characterized by two parameters; $R$\nrepresenting the distance between {\\alpha} clusters and {\\alpha} describing the\nbreaking of {\\alpha} clusters, and the contribution of the spin-orbit\ninteraction, very important in the $jj$-coupling shell model, can be taken into\naccount starting with the {\\alpha} cluster model wave function. Not only the\nclosure configurations of the major shells, but also the subclosure\nconfigurations of the $jj$-coupling shell model can be described starting with\nthe {\\alpha}-cluster model wave functions; however, the particle hole\nexcitations of single particles have not been fully established yet. In this\nstudy we show that the framework of AQCM can be extended even to the states\nwith the character of single particle excitations. For $^{12}$C, two particle\ntwo hole (2p2h) excitations from the subclosure configuration of $0p_{3/2}$\ncorresponding to BCS-like pairing are described, and these shell model states\nare coupled with the three {\\alpha} cluster model wave functions. The\ncorrelation energy from the optimal configuration can be estimated not only in\nthe cluster part but also in the shell model part. We try to pave the way to\nestablish a generalized description of the nuclear structure.\n", "  Further property enhancement of alnico, an attractive near-term,\nnon-rare-earth permanent magnet alloy system, primarily composed of Al, Ni, Co,\nand Fe, relies on improved morphology control and size refinement of its\ncomplex spinodally decomposed nanostructure that forms during heat-treatment.\nUsing a combination of transmission electron microscopy and atom probe\ntomography techniques, this study evaluates the magnetic properties and\nmicrostructures of an isotropic 32.4Fe-38.1Co-12.9Ni-7.3Al-6.4Ti-3.0Cu\n(wt.$\\%$) alloy in terms of processing parameters such as annealing\ntemperature, annealing time, application of an external magnetic field, as well\nas low-temperature \"draw\" annealing. Optimal spinodal morphology and spacing is\nformed within a narrow temperature and time range ($\\sim 840 \\unicode{x2103}$\nand 10 min during thermal-magnetic annealing (MA). The ideal morphology is a\nmosaic structure consisting of periodically arrayed $\\sim 40$ nm diameter\n(Fe-Co)-rich rods ($\\alpha_1$ phase) embedded in an (Al-Ni)-rich ($\\alpha_2$\nphase) matrix. A Cu-enriched phase with a size of $\\sim$ 3-5 nm is located at\nthe corners of two adjacent $\\{110\\}$ facets of the $\\alpha_1$ phase. The MA\nprocess significantly increased remanence ($B_\\text{r}$) ($\\sim$ 40-70 $\\%$) of\nthe alloy due to biased elongation of the $\\alpha_1$ phase along the\n$\\langle100\\rangle$ crystallographic direction, which is closest in orientation\nto the applied magnetic field. The optimum magnetic properties of the alloy\nwith an intrinsic coercivity ($H_\\text{cj}$) of 1845 Oe and a maximum energy\nproduct ($BH_\\text{max}$) of 5.9 MGOe were attributed to the uniformity of the\nmosaic structure.\n", "  We show asymptotic, exponential stability of the equilibrium configuration,\n$\\smallL$, of a hollow physical pendulum with its inner part entirely filled\nwith a viscous liquid, corresponding to the center of mass being in the lowest\nposition. Moreover, we prove that every weak solution with initial data\npossessing finite total initial energy and belonging to a \"large\" open set,\nbecomes eventually smooth and decays exponentially fast to the equilibrium\n$\\smallL$. These results are obtained also as byproduct of a \"generalized\nlinearization principle\" that we show for evolution equations with non-empty\n\"slow\" center manifold.\n", "  High-accuracy absolute proper motions, radial velocities, and distances have\nnow been measured for a number of dwarf-galaxy companions of the Milky Way,\nmaking it possible to study their 3D dynamics. Galactic orbits for 11 such\ngalaxies (Fornax, Sagittarius, Ursa Minor, LMC, SMC, Sculptor, Sextans, Carina,\nDraco, Leo I, Leo II) have been derived using two previously refined models for\nthe Galactic potential with the Navarro-Frenk-White and Allen-Santill'an\nexpressions for the potential of the dark-matter halo, and two different masses\nfor the Galaxy within 200 kpc - 0.75x10^12 Mo and 1.45x10^12 Mo. The character\nof the orbits of most of these galaxies indicates that they are tightly\ngravitationally bound to the Milky Way, even with the lower-mass model for the\ngravitational potential. One exception is the most distant galaxy in the list,\nLeo I, whose orbit demonstrates that it is only weakly gravitationally bound,\neven using the higher-mass model of the gravitational potential.\n", "  It has recently been reported by Cresswell et al. [1] that correlations in\nthe noise surrounding the observed gravitational wave signals, GW150194,\nGW151226, and GW170194 were found by the two LIGO detectors in Hanford and\nLivingston with the same time delay as the signals themselves. This raised some\nissues about the statistical reliability of the signals themselves, which led\nto much discussion, the current view appearing to support the contention that\nthere is something unexplained that may be of genuine astrophysical interest\n[2]. In this note, it is pointed out that a resolution of this puzzle may be\nfound in a proposal very recently put forward by the author [3], see also [4],\nthat what seems to be spuriously generated noise may in fact be gravitational\nevents caused by the decay of dark-matter particles (erebons) of mass around\n10^-5g, the existence of such events being a clear implication of the\ncosmological scheme of conformal cyclic cosmology, or CCC [5], [6]. A brief\noutline of the salient points of CCC is provided here, especially with regard\nto its prediction of erebons and their impulsive gravitational signals.\n", "  Study of the dephasing in electronic systems is not only important for\nprobing the nature of their ground states, but also crucial to harnessing the\nquantum coherence for information processing. In contrast to well-studied\nconventional metals and semiconductors, it remains unclear which mechanism is\nmainly responsible for electron dephasing in three-dimensional (3D) topological\ninsulators (TIs). Here, we report on using weak antilocalization effect to\nmeasure the dephasing rates in highly tunable (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films. As\nthe transport is varied from a bulk-conducting regime to surface-dominant\ntransport, the dephasing rate is observed to evolve from a linear temperature\ndependence to a sublinear power-law dependence. While the former is consistent\nwith the Nyquist electron-electron interactions commonly seen in ordinary 2D\nsystems, the latter leads to enhanced electron dephasing at low temperatures\nand is attributed to the coupling between the surface states and the localized\ncharge puddles in the bulk of 3D TIs.\n", "  Micromagnetic simulations of alnico show substantial deviations from\nStoner-Wohlfarth behavior due to the unique size and spatial distribution of\nthe rod-like Fe-Co phase formed during spinodal decomposition in an external\nmagnetic field. The maximum coercivity is limited by single-rod effects,\nespecially deviations from ellipsoidal shape, and by interactions between the\nrods. Both the exchange interaction between connected rods and magnetostatic\ninteraction between rods are considered, and the results of our calculations\nshow good agreement with recent experiments. Unlike systems dominated by\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy, coercivity in alnico is highly dependent on\nsize, shape, and geometric distribution of the Fe-Co phase, all factors that\ncan be tuned with appropriate chemistry and thermal-magnetic annealing.\n", "  The entrance to public universities in Brazil depends on scores obtained by\nstudents in Enem, Brazilian National Assessment of High School Education. This\nexam consists of four multiple choice tests (Language, Maths, Natural and Human\nSciences) scored by Item Response Theory (IRT). It is a high stake exam for\nstudents, allowing the use of its results of this exam to provide conditions\nfor monitoring high school learning and quality of education in Brazil. We\npresent a study of the Physics items of Enem from 2009 to 2014. The questions\nwere classified based on qualitative categories, providing a profile of the\nNatural Sciences test: a disciplinary exam (Physics, Chemistry and Biology),\nwith mostly qualitative questions, long and time consuming items, only a few of\nthem demanding more complex reasoning and assessing some problem solving\nskills. The answers of the students were analyzed, using basic statistical\nexploration and IRT to draw the ICC of the Physics items. A comparison was made\nbetween the qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis for the Physics\nquestions. The study of student performance reveals the low attaining levels of\nPhysics learning at the end of high school, with a small percentage of correct\nanswers; students perform worse in questions that require disciplinary\nknowledge or use of basic mathematical reasoning. It is also possible to\nobserve discrepancies on the results of two subsets of groups: female students\nperform worse than male students in most items, and students that come from\nfederal and private high school perform significantly better that those from\nstate high school (75% of students in high school attend state or regional\nschools). In conclusion, the combined analysis of student's performance and\ncontent of the items reveal some of the characteristics of student's learning\nin Brazil, at around 18 years, that can impact Physics Education system.\n", "  The stability and growth or dissolution of a single surface nanobubble on a\nchemically patterned surface are studied by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations\nof binary mixtures consisting of Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles. Our simulations\nreveal how pinning of the three-phase contact line on the surface can lead to\nthe stability of the surface nanobubble, provided that the concentration of the\ndissolved gas is oversaturated. We have performed equilibrium simulations of\nsurface nanobubbles at different gas oversaturation levels $\\zeta>0$. The\nequilibrium contact angle $\\theta_e$ is found to follow the theoretical result\nof Lohse and Zhang (Phys. Rev. E 2015, 91, 031003(R)), namely $\\sin\\theta_e =\n\\zeta L/L_c$, where L is the pinned length of the footprint and $L_c =\n4\\gamma/P_0$ a capillary length scale, with $\\gamma$ the surface tension and\n$P_0$ the ambient pressure. For undersaturation $\\zeta<0$ the surface\nnanobubble dissolves and the dissolution dynamics shows a \"stick-jump\"\nbehaviour of the three-phase contact line.\n", "  Although dopants have been extensively employed to promote ferroelectricity\nin hafnia films, their role in stabilizing the responsible ferroelectric\nnon-equilibrium Pca21 phase is not well understood. In this work, using first\nprinciples computations, we investigate the influence of nearly 40 dopants on\nthe phase stability in bulk hafnia to identify dopants that can favor formation\nof the polar Pca21 phase. Although no dopant was found to stabilize this polar\nphase as the ground state, suggesting that dopants alone cannot induce\nferroelectricity in hafnia, Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Y and Gd were found to\nsignificantly lower the energy of the polar phase with respect to the\nequilibrium monoclinic phase. These results are consistent with the empirical\nmeasurements of large remnant polarization in hafnia films doped with these\nelements. Additionally, clear chemical trends of dopants with larger ionic\nradii and lower electronegativity favoring the polar Pca21 phase in hafnia were\nidentified. For this polar phase, an additional bond between the dopant cation\nand the 2nd nearest oxygen neighbor was identified as the root-cause of these\ntrends. Further, trivalent dopants (Y, La, and Gd) were revealed to stabilize\nthe polar Pca21 phase at lower strains when compared to divalent dopants (Sr\nand Ba). Based on these insights, we predict that the lanthanide series metals,\nthe lower half of alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr and Ba) and Y as the most\nsuitable dopants to promote ferroelectricity in hafnia.\n", "  As UV LEDs are explored at shorter wavelengths (< 280 nm) into the UVC\nspectral range, the crystalline quality of epitaxial AlGaN films with high Al\ncompositions and inefficient hole injection from p-type AlGaN severely limit\nthe LED performance and development. In this work, we report on 237 nm light\nemission with a record light output power of 265 uW from AlN/Al0.72Ga028N\nmultiple quantum well UVC LEDs using bulk AlN substrates and p-type silicon\nnanomembrane contact layers for significantly improved AlGaN film quality and\nhole injection, respectively. No intensity degradation or efficiency droop was\nobserved up to a current density of 245 A/cm2, which is attributed to the low\ndislocation density within AlGaN films, the large concentration of holes from\np-Si, and efficient hole-transport to the active region. Additionally, the\nemission peak at 237 nm is dominant across the electroluminescence spectrum\nwith no significant parasitic emissions observed. This study demonstrates the\nfeasibility of using p-Si as a hole injector for UVC LEDs, which can be\nextended to even shorter wavelengths where hole injection from chemically doped\nAlGaN layers is not feasible.\n", "  It is shown that discrete-event simulation accurately reproduces the\nexperimental data of a single-neutron interferometry experiment [T. Denkmayr\n{\\sl et al.}, Nat. Commun. 5, 4492 (2014)] and provides a logically consistent,\nparadox-free, cause-and-effect explanation of the quantum Cheshire cat effect\nwithout invoking the notion that the neutron and its magnetic moment separate.\nDescribing the experimental neutron data using weak-measurement theory is shown\nto be useless for unravelling the quantum Cheshire cat effect.\n", "  In this mainly pedagogical article, we discuss under what circumstances\nmeasurements play a special role in quantum processes. In particular we discuss\nthe following facts which appear to be a common area of confusion: i) from a\nfundamental point of view measurements play no special role whatsoever: all\ndynamics that can be generated by measurements can be generated by unitary\nprocesses (for which post-selection is no exception), ii) from a purely\nphysical point of view, measurements are not \"outside\" of quantum mechanics,\niii) the only difference between the abilities of measurement-based protocols\nand unitary circuits for quantum computing comes from practical (technology\ndependent) constraints. We emphasize the importance of distinguishing between\ndifferences that are i) fundamental but without physical import, ii)\nfundamental and possess physical import, iii) are not fundamental but have\npractical import. We also emphasize the importance of separating theoretical\nand experimental elements of measurement, primarily projection and\namplification, which are physically very different. Note that since we are\nconcerned with facts regarding physical processes, this article has little if\nanything to do with interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n", "  The operator of time formalism is applied to radioactive decay. It appears\nthat the proposed approach offers better insight and understanding of the\nphenomena in a way that the decay exponential-law becomes the Boltzmann\ndistribution in Gibbs treatment of canonical ensemble. The radioactive decay is\nseen as temporal canonical ensemble where the radioactive constant appears as\nthe analog of the absolute temperature multiplied by Boltzmann constant. The\nstochastic character of decay process becomes plausible in the proposed\napproach and the explanation why decay is characterized by constant, and not by\nsome parameter, is offered.\n", "  With the rise of quantum technologies, it is necessary to have practical and\npreferably non-destructive methods to measure and read-out from such devices. A\ncurrent line of research towards this has focussed on the use of ancilla\nsystems which couple to the system under investigation, and through their\ninteraction, enable properties of the primary system to be imprinted onto and\ninferred from the ancillae. We propose the use of continuous variable qumodes\nas ancillary probes, and show that the interaction Hamiltonian can be fully\ncharacterised and directly sampled from measurements of the qumode alone. We\nsuggest how such probes may also be used to determine thermodynamical\nproperties, including reconstruction of the partition function. We show that\nthe method is robust to realistic experimental imperfections such as\nfinite-sized measurement bins and squeezing, and discuss how such probes are\nalready feasible with current experimental setups.\n"]}
