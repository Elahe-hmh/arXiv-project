We compare the exact and approximate results not only for\nthe internal degrees of freedom but also for the motion of the center of mass.\nWe address the problem of the permutation symmetry of identical nuclei and\ndiscuss other applications of the model and its limitations.\n", "  For random collections of self-avoiding loops in two-dimensional domains, we\ndefine a simple and natural conformal restriction property that is\nconjecturally satisfied by the scaling limits of interfaces in models from\nstatistical physics. This property is basically the combination of conformal\ninvariance and the locality of the interaction in the model. Unlike the Markov\nproperty that Schramm used to characterize SLE curves (which involves\nconditioning on partially generated interfaces up to arbitrary stopping times),\nthis property only involves conditioning on entire loops and thus appears at\nfirst glance to be weaker.\n  Our first main result is that there exists exactly a one-dimensional family\nof random loop collections with this property---one for each k in (8/3,4]---and\nthat the loops are forms of SLE(k). The proof proceeds in two steps. First,\nuniqueness is established by showing that every such loop ensemble can be\ngenerated by an \"exploration\" process based on SLE.\n  Second, existence is obtained using the two-dimensional Brownian loop-soup,\nwhich is a Poissonian random collection of loops in a planar domain. When the\nintensity parameter c of the loop-soup is less than 1, we show that the outer\nboundaries of the loop clusters are disjoint simple loops (when c>1 there is\nalmost surely only one cluster) that satisfy the conformal restriction axioms.\nWe prove various results about loop-soups, cluster sizes, and the c=1 phase\ntransition.\n  Taken together, our results imply that the following families are equivalent:\n  1. The random loop ensembles traced by certain branching SLE(k) curves for k\nin (8/3, 4].\n  2. The outer-cluster-boundary ensembles of Brownian loop-soups for c in (0,\n1].\n  3. The (only) random loop ensembles satisfying the conformal restriction\naxioms.\n", "  Entropic entanglement measures of a two-dimensional system of two\nCoulombically interacting particles confined in an anisotropic harmonic\npotential are discussed in dependence on the anisotropy and the interaction\nstrength. The harmonic approximation appears exact in the strong interaction\nlimit, allowing determination of the asymptotic expression for the linear\nentropy. Entanglement properties are dramatically influenced by the anisotropy\nof the confining potential in the strong-correlation regime.\n", "  The method of \"Isotropic Entanglement\" (IE), inspired by Free Probability\nTheory and Random Matrix Theory, predicts the eigenvalue distribution of\nquantum many-body (spin) systems with generic interactions. At the heart is a\n\"Slider\", which interpolates between two extrema by matching fourth moments.\nThe first extreme treats the non-commuting terms classically and the second\ntreats them isotropically. Isotropic means that the eigenvectors are in generic\npositions. We prove Matching Three Moments and Slider Theorems and further\nprove that the interpolation is universal, i.e., independent of the choice of\nlocal terms. Our examples show that IE provides an accurate picture well beyond\nwhat one expects from the first four moments alone.\n", "  According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors in the\nnext 10-15 years the limits imposed by the physics of switch operation will be\nthe major roadblock for future scaling of the CMOS technology. Among these\nlimits the most fundamental is represented by the so-called Shannon-von\nNeumann-Landauer limit that sets a lower bound to the minimum heat dissipated\nper bit erasing operation. Here we show that in a nanoscale switch, operated at\nfinite temperature T, this limit can be beaten by trading the dissipated energy\nwith the uncertainty in the distinguishability of switch logic states. We\nestablish a general relation between the minimum required energy and the\nmaximum error rate in the switch operation and briefly discuss the potential\napplications in the design of future switches.\n", "  The adsorption dynamics of a colloidal particle at a fluid interface is\nstudied theoretically and numerically, documenting distinctly different\nrelaxation regimes. The adsorption of a perfectly smooth particle is\ncharacterized by a fast exponential relaxation to thermodynamic equilibrium\nwhere the interfacial free energy has a minimum. The short relaxation time is\ngiven by the ratio of viscous damping to capillary forces. Physical and/or\nchemical heterogeneities in a colloidal system, however, can result in multiple\nminima of the free energy giving rise to metastability. In the presence of\nmetastable states we observe a crossover to a slow logarithmic relaxation\nreminiscent of physical aging in glassy systems. The long relaxation time is\ndetermined by the thermally-activated escape rate from metastable states.\nAnalytical expressions derived in this work yield quantitative agreement with\nmolecular dynamics simulations and recent experimental observations. This work\nprovides new insights on the adsorption dynamics of colloidal particles at\nfluid interfaces.\n", "  Simple conformal loop ensembles (CLE) are a class of random collection of\nsimple non-intersecting loops that are of particular interest in the study of\nconformally invariant systems. Among other things related to these CLEs, we\nprove the invariance in distribution of their nested \"full-plane\" versions\nunder the inversion $z \\mapsto 1/z$.\n", "  We have developed a modified Michelson interferometer type Raman laser system\nto manipulate cold 87 Rb atoms to interfere. A frequency modulated continuous\nwave technique was introduced to determine the optical path difference, thus\ncompensating it to zero to minimize the effects of common mode noise. The\nlinewidth (full width at half maximum) of the beat signal at 6.834 GHz was\nmeasured to 1Hz limited by the resolution bandwidth of the spectral analyzer.\nThe measured rms phase variance of the phase noise at 166 MHz was 0.015 rad2,\nmainly restricted by our poor performance radio frequency microwave source.\nWith modest improvements, we plan to apply this laser system to form an atom\ninterferometer for acceleration and rotation measurements.\n", "  The on-chip generation of non-classical states of light is a key-requirement\nfor future optical quantum hardware. In solid-state cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics, such non-classical light can be generated from self-assembled\nquantum dots strongly coupled to photonic crystal cavities. Their anharmonic\nstrong light-matter interaction results in large optical nonlinearities at the\nsingle photon level, where the admission of a single photon into the cavity may\nenhance (photon-tunnelling) or diminish (photon-blockade) the probability for a\nsecond photon to enter the cavity. Here, we demonstrate that detuning the\ncavity and QD resonances enables the generation of high-purity non-classical\nlight from strongly coupled systems. For specific detunings we show that not\nonly the purity but also the efficiency of single-photon generation increases\nsignificantly, making high-quality single-photon generation by photon-blockade\npossible with current state-of-the-art samples.\n", "  Stochastic resonance induced by external factor is considering to investigate\nthe complex dynamics of tumor. The surrounding environment and the treatment\neffects on the tumor growth are considered as additive and multiplicative\nnoises in growth model. The adaptability of tumor to treatment is presented by\ncorrelation of these two noises. The Fokker-Plank equation is deduced to study\nthe probability distribution function and mean number of tumor cells in\ndifferent conditions. The mean number of tumor cells can be controlled by the\ncorrelation and intensity of noises.\n", "  We discuss the impact of many previously neglected effects of higher\ndimensional operators when fitting to Electroweak Precision data (EWPD) in the\nStandard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We calculate the general case of\n$2 \\rightarrow 2$ fermion scattering in the SMEFT to order\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\bar{v}_T^2/\\Lambda^2)$ valid on and off the $Z$ pole, in the\nmassless fermion limit. We demonstrate that previously neglected corrections\nscale as $\\Gamma_Z M_Z/\\bar{v}_T^2$ in the partial widths extracted from\nmeasured cross sections at LEPI, compared to the leading effect of dimension\nsix operators in anomalous $Z$ couplings. Further, constraints on leading\neffects of anomalous $Z$ couplings are also modified by neglected perturbative\ncorrections and dimension eight operators. We perform a minimal EWPD fit to\nillustrate the size of the error these corrections induce, when bounding\nleading effects. These considerations relax bounds compared to a naive leading\norder analysis, and show that constraints that rise above the percent level are\nsubject to substantial theoretical uncertanties. We also argue that\nrenormalization group running global constraints expressed through $\\chi^2$\nfunctions to a common scale, and then minimizing and performing a global fit of\nall data allows more consistent constraints to be obtained in the SMEFT.\n", "  Our purpose is to pursue the rigorous construction of Liouville Quantum Field\nTheory on Riemann surfaces initiated by F. David, A. Kupiainen and the last two\nauthors in the context of the Riemann sphere and inspired by the 1981 seminal\nwork by Polyakov. In this paper, we investigate the case of simply connected\ndomains with boundary. We also make precise conjectures about the relationship\nof this theory to scaling limits of random planar maps with boundary\nconformally embedded onto the disk.\n", "  A central goal in quantum information science is to efficiently interface\nphotons with single optical modes for quantum networking and distributed\nquantum computing. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact\nand efficient method for the low-loss coupling of a solid-state qubit, the\nnitrogen vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, with a single-mode optical fibre. In\nthis approach, single-mode tapered diamond waveguides containing exactly one\nhigh quality NV memory are selected and integrated on tapered silica fibres.\nNumerical optimization of an adiabatic coupler indicates that\nnear-unity-efficiency photon transfer is possible between the two modes.\nExperimentally, we find an overall collection efficiency between 18-40 % and\nobserve a raw single photon count rate above 700 kHz. This integrated system\nenables robust, alignment-free, and efficient interfacing of single-mode\noptical fibres with single photon emitters and quantum memories in solids.\n", "  We develop a method to search for pair halos around active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) through a temporal analysis of gamma-ray data. The basis of our method is\nan analysis of the spatial distributions of photons coming from AGN flares and\nfrom AGN quiescent states and a further comparison of these two spatial\ndistributions. This method can also be used for a reconstruction of a point\nspread function (PSF). We found no evidence for a pair halo component through\nthis method by applying it to the Fermi-LAT data in the energy bands of 4.5-6,\n6-10, and >10 GeV and set upper limits on the fraction of photons attributable\nto a pair halo component. An illustration of how to reconstruct the PSF of\nFermi-LAT is given. We demonstrate that the PSF reconstructed by using this\nmethod is in good agreement with that which was obtained by using the gamma-ray\ndata taken by LAT in the direction of the Crab pulsar and nebula.\n", "  Black holes supported by self-interacting conformal scalar fields can be\nconsidered as renormalizably dressed since the conformal potential is nothing\nbut the top power-counting renormalizable self-interaction in the relevant\ndimension. On the other hand, potentials defined by powers which are lower than\nthe conformal one are also phenomenologically relevant since they are in fact\nsuper-renormalizable. In this work we provide a new map that allows to build\nblack holes dressed with all the (super-)renormalizable contributions starting\nfrom known conformal seeds. We explicitly construct several new examples of\nthese solutions in dimensions $D=3$ and $D=4$, including not only stationary\nconfigurations but also time-dependent ones.\n", "  We consider two related formulations for mass generation in the $U(1)$\nHiggs-Kibble model and in the Standard Model (SM). In the first model there are\nno scalar self-interactions and, in the case of the SM, the formulation is\nrelated to the normal subgroup of $G=SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$, generated\nby $(e^{2\\pi i/3}I,-I,e^{\\pi i/3})\\in G$, that acts trivially on all the fields\nof the SM. The key step of our construction is to relax the non-negative\ndefiniteness condition for the Higgs field due to the polar decomposition. This\nsolves several stringent problems, that we will shortly review, both in the\nperturbative and non-perturbative formulations. We will show that the usual\npolar decomposition of the complex scalar doublet $\\Phi$ should be done with\n$U\\in SU(2)/Z_2\\simeq SO(3)$, where $Z_2$ is the group generated by $-I$, and\nwith the Higgs field $\\phi\\in R$ rather than $\\phi\\in R_{\\geq0}$. As a\nbyproduct, the investigation shows how Elitzur theorem may be avoided in the\nusual formulation of the SM. It follows that the simplest lagrangian density\nfor the Higgs mechanism has the standard kinetic term in addition to the mass\nterm, with the right sign, and to a linear term in $\\phi$. The other model\nconcerns the scalar theories with normal ordered exponential interactions. The\nremarkable property of these theories is that for $D>2$ the purely scalar\nsector corresponds to a free theory.\n", "  We propose to realize Weyl semimetals in a cubic optical lattice. We find\nthat there exist three distinct Weyl semimetal phases in the cubic optical\nlattice for different parameter ranges. One of them has two pairs of Weyl\npoints and the other two have one pair of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone.\nFor a slab geometry with (010) surfaces, the Fermi arcs connecting the\nprojections of Weyl points with opposite topological charges on the surface\nBrillouin zone is presented. By adjusting the parameters, the Weyl points can\nmove in the Brillouin zone. Interestingly, for two pairs of Weyl points, as one\npair of them meet and annihilate, the originial two Fermi arcs coneect into\none. As the remaining Weyl points annihilate further, the Fermi arc vanishes\nand a gap is opened. Furthermore, we find that there always exists a hidden\nsymmetry at Weyl points, regardless of anywhere they located in the Brillouin\nzone. The hidden symmetry has an antiunitary operator with its square being\n$-1$.\n", "  We study one-dimensional systems of $N$ particles in a one-dimensional\nharmonic trap with an inverse power law interaction $\\sim|x|^{-d}$. Within the\nframework of the harmonic approximation we derive, in the strong interaction\nlimit, the Schmidt decomposition of the one-particle reduced density matrix and\ninvestigate the nature of the degeneracy appearing in its spectrum.\nFurthermore, the ground-state asymptotic occupancies and their natural orbitals\nare derived in closed analytic form, which enables their easy determination for\na wide range of values of $N$. A closed form asymptotic expression for the von\nNeumann entanglement entropy is also provided and its dependence on $N$ is\ndiscussed for the systems with $d=1$ (charged particles) and with $d=3$\n(dipolar particles).\n", "  We develop the global constraint picture in the (linear) effective field\ntheory generalisation of the Standard Model, incorporating data from detectors\nthat operated at PEP, PETRA, TRISTAN, SpS, Tevatron, SLAC, LEPI and LEP II, as\nwell as low energy precision data. We fit one hundred and three observables. We\ndevelop a theory error metric for this effective field theory, which is\nrequired when constraints on parameters at leading order in the power counting\nare to be pushed to the percent level, or beyond, unless the cut off scale is\nassumed to be large, $\\Lambda \\gtrsim \\, 3 \\, {\\rm TeV}$. We more consistently\nincorporate theoretical errors in this work, avoiding this assumption, and as a\ndirect consequence bounds on some leading parameters are relaxed. We show how\nan $\\rm S,T$ analysis is modified by the theory errors we include as an\nillustrative example.\n", "  We theoretically study the generation of quantum correlations in a hybrid\nsystem composed by two interacting semiconductor quantum dots mediated by a\nmetal nanoparticle and coupled to an external laser field. Interactions present\nin the hybrid system are treated using a semiclassical approximation except for\nthe direct dipole-dipole interaction.\n  We report the entanglement of formation, which gives information about\nentanglement quantum correlations, for continuous wave and pulsed driving\napplied fields. We have found that for proper values of the physical and\ngeometrical parameters of the hybrid system the applied field can be tuned\nproducing quantum correlations of significant value so that they can be useful\nin quantum information and computation processes.\n", "  A centrosymmetric stress cannot induce a polar response in centric materials,\npiezoelectricity is, for example, possible only in non-centrosymmetric\nstructures. An exception is meta-materials with shape asymmetry, which may be\npolarized by stress even when the material is centric. In this case the\nmechanism is flexoelectricity, which relates polarization to a strain gradient.\nThe flexoelectric response scales inversely with size, thus a large effect is\nexpected in nanoscale materials. Recent experiments in polycrystalline,\ncentrosymmetric perovskites [e.g., (Ba,Sr)TiO3] have indicated values of\nflexoelectric coefficients that are orders of magnitude higher than\ntheoretically predicted, promising practical applications based on bulk\nmaterials. We show that materials with unexpectedly large flexoelectric\nresponse exhibit breaking of the macroscopic centric symmetry through\ninhomogeneity induced by the high temperature processing. The emerging\nelectro-mechanical coupling is significant and may help to resolve the\ncontroversy surrounding the large apparent flexoelectric coefficients in this\nclass of materials.\n", "  In this paper, we establish (1) the classical limit of the Hartree equation\nleading to the Vlasov equation, (2) the classical limit of the $N$-body linear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation uniformly in N leading to the N-body Liouville\nequation of classical mechanics and (3) the simultaneous mean-field and\nclassical limit of the N-body linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation leading to the\nVlasov equation. In all these limits, we assume that the gradient of the\ninteraction potential is Lipschitz continuous. All our results are formulated\nas estimates involving a quantum analogue of the Monge-Kantorovich distance of\nexponent 2 adapted to the classical limit, reminiscent of, but different from\nthe one defined in [F. Golse, C. Mouhot, T. Paul, Commun. Math. Phys. 343\n(2016), 165-205]. As a by-product, we also provide bounds on the quadratic\nMonge-Kantorovich distances between the classical densities and the Husimi\nfunctions of the quantum density matrices.\n", "  In this paper we explore the advantage of using the Kerr-Schild Ansatz in the\nsearch of analytic configurations to bigravity. It turns out that it plays a\ncrucial role by providing means to straightforwardly calculate the square root\nmatrix encoding the interaction terms between both gravities. We rederive in\nthis spirit the Babichev-Fabbri family of asymptotically flat rotating black\nholes with the aid of an emerging circularity theorem. Taking into account that\nthe interaction terms contain by default two cosmological constants, we repeat\nour approach starting from the more natural seeds for the Kerr-Schild Ansatz in\nthis context: the (A)dS spacetimes. As result, we show that a couple of\nKerr-(A)dS black holes constitute an exact solution to ghost free bigravity.\nThese black holes share the same angular momentum and (A)dS radius but their\nmasses are not constrained to be equal, similarly to the asymptotically flat\ncase.\n", "  We propose a phenomenological theory working out light illumination effects\non the equilibrium values of any macroscopic crystal tensor (polarization,\nmagnetization, susceptibilities, strain tensor, elastic coefficients...). it\nalso encompasses non-equilibrium light-induced quantities such as an electric\ncurrent and heat flow. We use a single phenomenological approach based on\nWigner spherical functions for predicting symmetry-related photo-induced\nphenomena, including photovoltaic, photoelectric, photomagnetic,\nphotorefractive, photogalvanic, photoelastic and optic rectification phenomena.\nFor each crystal magnetic point group and each tensor type, response functions\nare calculated vs. the propagation and polarization directions of the incident\nelectromagnetic beam. Their forms are determined by crystal and light symmetry\ngroup interconnection. We pay special attention to time and space reversal\nsymmetries, which play a dominant role in the intricate symmetry breakdowns of\nmultiferroic materials. Photovoltaic and photo-magneto-electric effects in\nLiNbO3 illustrate our theory.\n", "  In an influential 1964 article, P. Lax studied $2 \\times 2$ genuinely\nnonlinear strictly hyperbolic PDE systems (in one spatial dimension). Using the\nmethod of Riemann invariants, he showed that a large set of smooth initial data\nlead to bounded solutions whose first spatial derivatives blow up in finite\ntime, a phenomenon known as wave breaking. In the present article, we study the\nCauchy problem for two classes of quasilinear wave equations in two spatial\ndimensions that are closely related to the systems studied by Lax. When the\ndata have one-dimensional symmetry, Lax's methods can be applied to the wave\nequations to show that a large set of smooth initial data lead to wave\nbreaking. Here we study solutions with initial data that are close, as measured\nby an appropriate Sobolev norm, to data belonging to a distinguished subset of\nLax's data: the data corresponding to simple plane waves. Our main result is\nthat under suitable relative smallness assumptions, the Lax-type wave breaking\nfor simple plane waves is stable. The key point is that we allow the data\nperturbations to break the symmetry. Moreover, we give a detailed, constructive\ndescription of the asymptotic behavior of the solution all the way up to the\nfirst singularity, which is a shock driven by the intersection of null\n(characteristic) hyperplanes. We also outline how to extend our results to the\ncompressible irrotational Euler equations. To derive our results, we use\nChristodoulou's framework for studying shock formation to treat a new solution\nregime in which wave dispersion is not present.\n", "  The photosystem II reaction centre is the photosynthetic complex responsible\nfor oxygen production on Earth. Its water splitting function is particularly\nfavoured by the formation of a stable charge separated state via a pathway that\nstarts at an accessory chlorophyll. Here we envision a photovoltaic device that\nplaces one of these complexes between electrodes and investigate how the mean\ncurrent and its fluctuations depend on the microscopic interactions underlying\ncharge separation in the pathway considered. Our results indicate that coupling\nto well resolved vibrational modes does not necessarily offer an advantage in\nterms of power output but can lead to photo-currents with suppressed noise\nlevels characterizing a multi-step ordered transport process. Besides giving\ninsight into the suitability of these complexes for molecular-scale\nphotovoltaics, our work suggests a new possible biological function for the\nvibrational environment of photosynthetic reaction centres, namely, to reduce\nthe intrinsic current noise for regulatory processes.\n", "  This paper addresses the mathematical models for the heat-conduction\nequations and the Navier-Stokes equations via fractional derivatives without\nsingular kernel.\n", "  Based on the method of compact groups of inhomogeneities, we formulate new\nmixing rules for suspensions of charged insulating particles. They express the\nquasistatic conductivity and permittivity of a suspension in terms of the\neffective geometric and dielectric parameters of the particles, electric double\nlayers (EDLs), and suspending liquid. Also, we present our low-frequency\nimpedance measurements of the conductivity and permittivity of Al2O3-isopropyl\nalcohol nanofluids as functions of Al2O3-particle volume concentration. Our\nrules give good fits for most of these data and allow us to estimate, among\nother things, the effective thickness, conductivity, and permittivity of the\nEDLs. The experimentally-recovered values agree well with elementary\ntheoretical estimates suggesting the charging of the particles through\npreferential adsorption of contaminant ions. The possible effects of other\nmechanisms on the effective conductivity and permittivity of suspensions are\nalso discussed.\n", "  It is common practice in cosmology to model large-scale structure observables\nas lognormal random fields, and this approach has been successfully applied in\nthe past to the matter density and weak lensing convergence fields separately.\nWe argue that this approach has fundamental limitations which prevent its use\nfor jointly modelling these two fields since the lognormal distribution's shape\ncan prevent certain correlations to be attainable. Given the need of ongoing\nand future large-scale structure surveys for fast joint simulations of\nclustering and weak lensing, we propose two ways of overcoming these\nlimitations. The first approach slightly distorts the power spectra of the\nfields using one of two algorithms that minimises either the absolute or the\nfractional distortions. The second one is by obtaining more accurate\nconvergence marginal distributions, for which we provide a fitting function, by\nintegrating the lognormal density along the line of sight. The latter approach\nalso provides a way to determine directly from theory the skewness of the\nconvergence distribution and, therefore, the parameters for a lognormal fit. We\npresent the public code Full-sky Lognormal Astro-fields Simulation Kit (FLASK)\nwhich can make tomographic realisations on the sphere of an arbitrary number of\ncorrelated lognormal or Gaussian random fields by applying either of the two\nproposed solutions, and show that it can create joint simulations of clustering\nand lensing with sub-per-cent accuracy over relevant angular scales and\nredshift ranges.\n", "  In this work, a method for solving the constraints of general relativity is\npresented, where first all geometrical objects are written in terms of a set of\northonormal triads and a flat Weitzenbock connection, which depends on the\ntriads and on a flat spin connection. It is shown that the hamiltonian\nconstraint can be reduced from a second order equation to a first order one.\nEven though the order of the equation is reduced, we do not get any extra\nequations to solve by this procedure. A conformal decomposition is also\npresented.\n", "  First, we present a history of the school of thought that the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background Radiation acts as an ether in contemporary popular\nEnglish. Then we illustrate the properties of this ether and of a hypothetical\n\"test mass\" using a brand new thought experiment. Finally, we recount some\npost-Einstein efforts at a mathematical formulation of Mach's principle and\nraise some questions about what implications it has for the locality of\nrotation and for quantum gravity. This paper does not prove Einstein wrong.\n", "  A pivotal task in quantum metrology, and quantum parameter estimation in\ngeneral, is to de- sign schemes that achieve the highest precision with given\nresources. Standard models of quantum metrology usually assume the dynamics is\nfixed, the highest precision is achieved by preparing the optimal probe states\nand performing optimal measurements. However, in many practical experimental\nsettings, additional controls are usually available to alter the dynamics. Here\nwe propose to use optimal control methods for further improvement on the\nprecision limit of quantum parameter estimation. We show that by exploring the\nadditional degree of freedom offered by the controls higher precision limit can\nbe achieved. In particular we show that the precision limit under the\ncontrolled schemes can go beyond the constraints put by the coherent time,\nwhich is in contrast to the standard scheme where the precision limit is always\nbounded by the coherent time.\n", "  We calculate the double pole contribution to two to four fermion scattering\nthrough $W^{\\pm}$ currents at tree level in the Standard Model Effective Field\nTheory (SMEFT). We assume all fermions to be massless, $\\rm U(3)^5$ flavour and\n$\\rm CP$ symmetry. Using this result, we update the global constraint picture\non SMEFT parameters including LEPII data on these charged current processes,\nand also include modifications to our fit procedure motivated by a companion\npaper focused on $W^{\\pm}$ mass extractions. The fit reported is now to 177\nobservables and emphasises the need for a consistent inclusion of theoretical\nerrors, and a consistent treatment of observables. Including charged current\ndata lifts the two-fold degeneracy previously encountered in LEP (and lower\nenergy) data, and allows us to set simultaneous constraints on 20 of 53 Wilson\ncoefficients in the SMEFT, consistent with our assumptions. This allows the\nmodel independent inclusion of LEP data in SMEFT studies at LHC, which are\nprojected into the SMEFT in a consistent fashion. We show how stronger\nconstraints can be obtained by using some combinations of Wilson coefficients,\nwhen making assumptions on the UV completion of the Standard Model, or in an\ninconsistent analysis. We explain why strong bounds at the per-mille or\nsub-per-mille level on some combinations of Wilson coefficients in the\nEffective Lagrangian can be artificially enhanced in fits of this form in\ndetail. This explains some of the different claims present in the literature.\n", "  Electrons in condensed matter have internal degrees of freedom, such as\ncharge, spin and orbital, leading to various forms of ordered states through\nphase transitions. However, in individual materials, a charge/spin/orbital\nordered state of the lowest temperature is normally uniquely determined in\nterms of the lowest-energy state, i.e., the ground state. Here, we summarize\nrecent results showing that under rapid cooling, this principle does not\nnecessarily hold, and thus, the cooling rate is a control parameter of the\nlowest-temperature state beyond the framework of the thermo-equilibrium phase\ndiagram. Although the cooling rate utilized in low-temperature experiments is\ntypically 2*10^-3 - 4*10^-1 K/s, the use of optical/electronic pulses\nfacilitate rapid cooling, such as 10^2-10^3 K/s. Such an unconventionally high\ncooling rate allows some systems to kinetically avoid a first-order phase\ntransition, resulting in a quenched charge/spin state that differs from the\nground state. We also demonstrate that quenched states can be exploited as a\nnon-volatile state variable when designing phase-change memory functions. The\npresent findings suggest that rapid cooling is useful for exploring and\ncontrolling the metastable electronic/magnetic state that is potentially hidden\nbehind the ground state.\n", "  Various models of quantum gravity suggest a modification of the Heisenberg's\nUncertainty Principle, to the so-called Generalized Uncertainty Principle,\nbetween position and momentum. In this work we show how this modification\ninfluences the theory of angular momentum in Quantum Mechanics. In particular,\nwe compute Planck scale corrections to angular momentum eigenvalues, the\nHydrogen atom spectrum, the Stern-Gerlach experiment and the Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficients. We also examine effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle\non multi-particle systems.\n", "  We construct a new Godunov type relativistic hydrodynamics code in Milne\ncoordinates, using a Riemann solver based on the two-shock approximation which\nis stable under the existence of large shock waves. We check the correctness of\nthe numerical algorithm by comparing numerical calculations and analytical\nsolutions in various problems, such as shock tubes, expansion of matter into\nthe vacuum, the Landau-Khalatnikov solution, and propagation of fluctuations\naround Bjorken flow and Gubser flow. We investigate the energy and momentum\nconservation property of our code in a test problem of longitudinal\nhydrodynamic expansion with an initial condition for high-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions. We also discuss numerical viscosity in the test problems of\nexpansion of matter into the vacuum and conservation properties. Furthermore,\nwe discuss how the numerical stability is affected by the source terms of\nrelativistic numerical hydrodynamics in Milne coordinates.\n", "  Critical behavior at an order/disorder phase transition has been a central\nobject of interest in statistical physics. In the past century, techniques\nborrowed from many different fields of mathematics (Algebra, Combinatorics,\nProbability, Complex Analysis, Spectral Theory, etc) have contributed to a more\nand more elaborate description of the possible critical behaviors for a large\nvariety of models. The Ising model is maybe one of the most striking success of\nthis cross-fertilization, for this model of ferromagnetism is now very well\nunderstood both physically and mathematically. In this article, we review an\napproach, initiated in \\cite{GriHurShe70,Aiz82} and based on the notion of\nrandom currents, enabling a deep study of the model.\n", "  The small mass and high coherence of nanomechanical resonators render them\nthe ultimate force probe, with applications ranging from biosensing and\nmagnetic resonance force microscopy, to quantum optomechanics. A notorious\nchallenge in these experiments is thermomechanical noise related to dissipation\nthrough internal or external loss channels. Here, we introduce a novel approach\nto defining nanomechanical modes, which simultaneously provides strong spatial\nconfinement, full isolation from the substrate, and dilution of the resonator\nmaterial's intrinsic dissipation by five orders of magnitude. It is based on a\nphononic bandgap structure that localises the mode, without imposing the\nboundary conditions of a rigid clamp. The reduced curvature in the highly\ntensioned silicon nitride resonator enables mechanical $Q>10^{8}$ at $ 1\n\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$, yielding the highest mechanical $Qf$-products\n($>10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) yet reported at room temperature. The corresponding\ncoherence times approach those of optically trapped dielectric particles.\nExtrapolation to $4{.}2$ Kelvin predicts $\\sim$quanta/ms heating rates, similar\nto trapped ions.\n", "  The problem of bounding the (abelian) many-anyon ground-state energy from\nabove, with a dependence on the statistics parameter which matches that of\ncurrently available lower bounds, is reduced to studying the correlation\nfunctions of Moore-Read (Pfaffian) and Read-Rezayi type clustering states.\n", "  It is a fundamental postulate that quasiparticles in 3D space obey either\nBosonic or Fermionic statistics, satisfying either canonical commutation or\nanti-commutation relation. However, under certain constraints, such as the 2D\ndimensional constraint, canonical quantization algebra is allowed to break\ndown, and quasiparticles can obey other statistics, such as anyonic statistics.\nIn this study, we show that dislons- the quasiparticles in 3D due to quantized\ndisplacement field of a dislocation- can also obey neither Bosonic nor\nFermionic statistics due to the topological constraint of the dislocation. With\nthis theory, an effective electron field theory based on the electron-dislon\ninteraction is obtained, which consists of two types of interactions. One\nclassical-type of interaction is reducible to the well-known deformation\npotential scattering, and the other quantum-type of interaction indicates an\neffective attraction between electrons. The role of dislocations in\nsuperconductivity is clarified as the competition between the classical and\nquantum interactions, showing excellent agreement with experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we will regularize the holographic entanglement entropy,\nholographic complexity and fidelity susceptibility for a configuration of\nD3-branes. We will also study the regularization of the holographic complexity\nfrom action for a configuration of D3-branes. It will be demonstrated that for\na spherical shell of D3-branes the regularized holographic complexity is always\ngreater than or equal to than the regularized fidelity susceptibility.\nFurthermore, we will also demonstrate that the regularized holographic\ncomplexity is related to the regularized holographic entanglement entropy for\nthis system. Thus, we will obtain a holographic bound involving regularized\nholographic complexity, regularized holographic entanglement entropy and\nregularized fidelity susceptibility of a configuration of D3-brane. We will\nalso discuss a bound for regularized holographic complexity from action, for a\nD3-brane configuration.\n", "  We study $\\alpha'$-corrections in multiple D7-brane configurations with\nnon-commuting profiles for their transverse position fields. We focus on\nT-brane systems, crucial in F-theory GUT model building. There\n$\\alpha'$-corrections modify the D-term piece of the BPS equations which,\nalready at leading order, require a non-primitive Abelian worldvolume flux\nbackground. We find that $\\alpha'$-corrections may either i) leave this flux\nbackground invariant, ii) modify the Abelian non-primitive flux profile, or\niii) deform it to a non-Abelian profile. The last case typically occurs when\nprimitive fluxes, a necessary ingredient to build 4d chiral models, are added\nto the system. We illustrate these three cases by solving the\n$\\alpha'$-corrected D-term equations in explicit examples, and describe their\nappearance in more general T-brane backgrounds. Finally, we discuss\nimplications of our findings for F-theory GUT local models.\n", "  Recent experiments have pushed the studies on atom-photon interactions to the\nultrastrong regime, which motivates the exploration of physics beyond the\nrotation wave approximation. Here we study the single-photon scattering on a\nsystem composed by a coupling cavity array with a two-level atom in the center\ncavity, which, by varying two outside coupling parameters, corresponds to a\nmodel from a supercavity QED to a waveguide QED with counter-rotating wave\n(CRW) interaction. By applying a time-independent scattering theory based on\nthe bound states in the scattering region, we find that the CRW interaction\nobviously changes the transmission valley even in the weak atom-cavity coupling\nregime; In particular, the CRW interaction leads to an inelastic scattering\nprocess and a Fano-type resonance, which is directly observed in the crossover\nfrom the supercavity QED case to the waveguide QED case. Predictably, our\nfindings provide the potential of manipulating the CRW effects in realistic\nsystems.\n", "  A novel method for generating GigaGauss solenoidal field in laser-plasma\nbubble, using screw-shaped laser pulses, has been recently presented in\narXiv:1604.01259 [physics.plasm-ph]. Such magnetic fields enable fast\nsynchrotron radiation cooling of the beam emittance of laser-plasma accelerated\nleptons. This recent finding opens a novel approach for design of laser-plasma\nFELs or colliders, where the acceleration stages are interleaved with\nlaser-plasma emittance cooling stages. In this concept paper we present an\noutline of how a staged plasma-acceleration FEL could look like and discuss\nfurther studies needed to investigate the feasibility of the concept in detail.\n", "  An analytical theory, based on the perturbative treatment of the disorder and\nextended into a self-consistent set of equations for the dynamical density\ncorrelations, is developed and applied to the prototype one-dimensional model\nof many-body localization. Results show a qualitative agreement with\nnumerically obtained dynamical structure factor in the whole range of\nfrequencies and wavevectors, as well as across the transition to the nonergodic\nbehavior. The theory reveals the singular nature of the one-dimensional\nproblem, whereby on the ergodic side the dynamics is subdiffusive with\ndynamical conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega) \\propto |\\omega|^\\alpha$, i.e., with\nvanishing d.c. limit $\\sigma_0=0$ and $\\alpha<1$ varying with disorder, while\nwe get $\\alpha >1$ in the localized phase.\n", "  In the cold inflation scenario, the slow roll inflation and reheating via\ncoherent rapid oscillation, are usually considered as two distinct eras. When\nthe slow roll ends, a rapid oscillation phase begins and the inflaton decays to\nrelativistic particles reheating the Universe. In another model dubbed warm\ninflation, the rapid oscillation phase is suppressed, and we are left with only\na slow roll period during which the reheating occurs. Instead, in this paper,\nwe propose a new picture for inflation in which the slow roll era is suppressed\nand only the rapid oscillation phase exists. Radiation generation during this\nera is taken into account, so we have warm inflation with an oscillatory\ninflaton. To provide enough e-folds, we employ the non-minimal derivative\ncoupling model. We study the cosmological perturbations and compute the\ntemperature at the end of warm oscillatory inflation.\n", "  Proton transverse-spin azimuthal asymmetries are extracted from the COMPASS\n2010 semi-inclusive hadron measurements in deep inelastic muon-nucleon\nscattering in those four regions of the photon virtuality $Q^2$, which\ncorrespond to the four regions of the di-muon mass $\\sqrt{Q^2}$ used in the\nongoing analysis of the COMPASS Drell-Yan measurements. This allows for a\nfuture direct comparison of the nucleon transverse-momentum-dependent parton\ndistribution functions extracted from these two alternative measurements.\nVarious two-dimensional kinematic dependences are presented for the azimuthal\nasymmetries induced by the Sivers transverse-momentum-dependent parton\ndistribution function. The integrated Sivers asymmetries are found to be\npositive with an accuracy that appears to be sufficient to test the sign change\nof the Sivers function predicted by Quantum Chromodynamics.\n", "  We study the ground-state properties and excitation spectrum of the\nLieb-Liniger model, i.e. the one-dimensional Bose gas with repulsive contact\ninteractions. We solve the Bethe-Ansatz equations in the thermodynamic limit by\nusing an analytic method based on a series expansion on orthogonal polynomials\ndeveloped in \\cite{Ristivojevic} and push the expansion to an unprecedented\norder. By a careful analysis of the mathematical structure of the series\nexpansion, we make a conjecture for the analytic exact result at zero\ntemperature and show that the partially resummed expressions thereby obtained\ncompete with accurate numerical calculations. This allows us to evaluate the\ndensity of quasi-momenta, the ground-state energy, the local two-body\ncorrelation function and Tan's contact. Then, we study the two branches of the\nexcitation spectrum. Using a general analysis of their properties and\nsymmetries, we obtain novel analytical expressions at arbitrary interaction\nstrength which are found to be extremely accurate in a wide range of\nintermediate to strong interactions.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of single- and multi-photon emission from detuned\nstrongly coupled systems based on the quantum-dot-photonic-crystal resonator\nplatform. Transmitting light through such systems can generate a range of\nnon-classical states of light with tunable photon counting statistics due to\nthe nonlinear ladder of hybridized light-matter states. By controlling the\ndetuning between emitter and resonator, the transmission can be tuned to\nstrongly enhance either single- or two-photon emission processes. Despite the\nstrongly-dissipative nature of these systems, we find that by utilizing a\nself-homodyne interference technique combined with frequency-filtering we are\nable to find a strong two-photon component of the emission in the multi-photon\nregime. In order to explain our correlation measurements, we propose rate\nequation models that capture the dominant processes of emission both in the\nsingle- and multi-photon regimes. These models are then supported by\nquantum-optical simulations that fully capture the frequency filtering of\nemission from our solid-state system.\n", "  The standard postulates of quantum theory can be divided into two groups: the\nfirst one characterizes the structure and dynamics of pure states, while the\nsecond one specifies the structure of measurements and the corresponding\nprobabilities. In this work we keep the first group of postulates and\ncharacterize all alternatives to the second group that give rise to\nfinite-dimensional sets of mixed states. We prove a correspondence between all\nthese alternatives and a class of representations of the unitary group. Some\nfeatures of these probabilistic theories are identical to quantum theory, but\nthere are important differences in others. For example, some theories have\nthree perfectly distinguishable states in a two-dimensional Hilbert space.\nOthers have exotic properties such as lack of \"bit symmetry\", the violation of\n\"no simultaneous encoding\" (a property similar to information causality) and\nthe existence of maximal measurements without phase groups. We also analyze\nwhich of these properties single out the Born rule.\n", "  We theoretically examine the validity of Matthiessen's rule caused by strong\ndislocation-dislocation interaction using a fully quantized dislocation field,\nwhere its degree of deviation is quantified at arbitrary electron energy,\ndislocation-electron and dislocation-dislocation distances and interaction\nstrengths. Contrary to intuition, we show that the electron relaxation rate\ndeviates from the Matthiessen's rule in an oscillatory way as a function of\ninter-dislocation distance, instead of monotonically. This study could serve as\na computational tool to investigate the electronic behavior of a\nhighly-dislocated system at a full quantum field theoretical level.\n", "  The mass, radius and crustal fraction of moment of inertia in neutron stars\nare calculated using $\\beta$-equilibrated nuclear matter obtained from Skyrme\neffective interaction. The transition density, pressure and proton fraction at\nthe inner edge separating the liquid core from the solid crust of the neutron\nstars are determined from the thermodynamic stability conditions using the\nKDE0v1 set. The neutron star masses obtained by solving the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations using neutron star matter obtained from\nthis set is able to describe highly massive compact stars $\\sim$2$M_{\\odot}$.\nThe crustal fraction of the moment of inertia can be extracted from studying\npulsar glitches. This fraction is highly dependent on the core-crust transition\npressure and corresponding density. These results for pressure and density at\ncore-crust transition together with the observed minimum crustal fraction of\nthe total moment of inertia provide a limit for the radius of the Vela\npulsar:$R\\geq$ 3.69+3.44 M/$M_{\\odot}$. Present calculations suggest that the\ncrustal fraction of the total moment of inertia can be at most 3.6% due to\ncrustal entrainment caused by Bragg reflection of unbound neutrons by lattice\nions.\n", "  We study the observational properties of a class of exact solutions of\nEinstein's field equations describing stationary, axially symmetric, rigidly\nrotating dust (i.e. non interacting particles). We ask the question whether\nsuch solutions can describe astrophysical rotating dark matter clouds near the\ncenter of galaxies and we probe the possibility that they may constitute an\nalternative to supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. We show that\nlight emission from accretion disks made of ordinary baryonic matter in this\nspace-time has several differences with respect to the emission of light from\nsimilar accretion disks around black holes. The shape of the iron K$\\alpha$\nline in the reflection spectrum of accretion disks can potentially distinguish\nthis class of solution from the Kerr metric, but this may not be possible with\ncurrent X-ray missions.\n", "  Orbital angular momentum of photons is an intriguing system for the storage\nand transmission of quantum information, but it is rapidly degraded by\natmospheric turbulence. Understanding the noise processes that affect photons\nis essential if we desire to protect them. In this paper we use the\ninfinitesimal propagation equation of Roux to derive a discrete Lindblad\nequation, and numerically study the form of the most relevant Lindblad\noperators. We find that the dominant Lindblad operators are those that shift\nthe angular momentum by one unit. We explore possible schemes to protect\nquantum information across multiple photons by concatenating a standard quantum\nerror-correcting code with an error-detecting code for orbital angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We consider a new type of attack on a coherent quantum key distribution\nprotocol [coherent one-way (COW) protocol]. The main idea of the attack\nconsists in measuring individually the intercepted states and sending the rest\nof them unchanged. We have calculated the optimum values of the attack\nparameters for an arbitrary length of a channel length and compared this novel\nattack with a standard beam-splitting attack.\n", "  The spin chemical potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse.\nProbing the spin chemical potential could provide insight into materials such\nas magnetic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic\ndevices. Here, we introduce single-spin magnetometry as a generic platform for\nnon-perturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We\nuse this platform to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, surprisingly\nfinding that the magnon chemical potential can be efficiently controlled by\ndriving the system's ferromagnetic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based\ntwo-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, realize the first\nexperimental determination of the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate\nthe detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our\nresults open the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in\nmesoscopic spin systems.\n", "  A massive primordial halo near an intensely star-forming galaxy may collapse\ninto a supermassive star (SMS) and leave a massive black hole seed of about\n$10^5~M_{\\odot}$. To investigate the impact of ionizing radiation on the\nformation of an SMS from a nearby galaxy, we perform three-dimensional\nradiation hydrodynamical simulations by selecting a pair of massive dark matter\nhalos forming at $z >10$. We find that rich structures such as clumps and\nfilaments around the source galaxy shield the cloud from ionizing radiation. In\nfact, in some cases, cloud collapse is accelerated under ionizing radiation.\nThis fact suggests that the ionization of the cloud's surroundings helps its\ncollapse. Only strong radiation at the early stage of structure formation can\nhalt the cloud collapse, but this is much stronger than observationally allowed\nvalue. We also explored the effect of ionizing radiation on a sample of 68\nhalos by employing an analytical model and found that increase in the mean\ndensity of the gas between the SMS forming cloud and the source galaxy protects\nthe gas cloud from ionizing radiation as they approach each other. Thus, we\nconclude that ionizing radiation does not prevent the formation of an SMS in\nmost of the cases.\n", "  We discuss the production of the doubly charged leptons in future linear\nelectron positron colliders, such as the International Linear Collider and\nCompact Linear Collider. Such states are introduced in extended weak-isospin\nmultiplets by composite models. We discuss the production cross section of\n$e^-\\gamma\\rightarrow L^{--}W^{+}$ and carry out analyses for hadronic,\nsemi-leptonic and pure leptonic channels based on the full simulation\nperformance of the Silicon Detector. The 3- and 5-sigma statistical\nsignificance exclusion curves are provided in the model parameter space. It is\nfound that the hadronic channel could offer the most possible detectable\nsignature.\n", "  In this paper, a new fractional operator of variable order with the use of\nthe monotonic increasing function is proposed in sense of Caputo type. The\nproperties in term of the Laplace and Fourier transforms are analyzed and the\nresults for the anomalous diffusion equations of variable order are discussed.\nThe new formulation is efficient in modeling a class of concentrations in the\ncomplex transport process.\n", "  Information scrambling and the butterfly effect in chaotic quantum systems\ncan be diagnosed by out-of-time-ordered (OTO) commutators through an\nexponential growth and large late time value. We show that the latter feature\nshows up in a strongly correlated many-body system, a Luttinger liquid, whose\ndensity fluctuations we study at long and short wavelengths, both in\nequilibrium and after a quantum quench. We find rich behaviour combining\nrobustly universal and non-universal features. The OTO commutators display\ntemperature and initial state independent behaviour, and grow as $t^2$ for\nshort times. For the short wavelength density operator, they reach a sizeable\nvalue after the light cone only in an interacting Luttinger liquid, where the\nbare excitations break up into collective modes. We benchmark our findings\nnumerically on an interacting spinless fermion model in 1D, and find\npersistence of central features even in the non-integrable case. As a\nnon-universal feature, the short time growth exhibits a distance dependent\npower.\n", "  We report on the observation of a topologically protected edge state at the\ninterface between two topologically distinct domains of the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which we implement in arrays of evanescently\ncoupled dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton waveguides. Direct evidence\nof the topological character of the edge state is obtained through several\nindependent experiments: Its spatial localization at the interface as well as\nthe restriction to one sublattice is confirmed by real-space leakage radiation\nmicroscopy. The corresponding momentum-resolved spectrum obtained by Fourier\nimaging reveals the midgap position of the edge state as predicted by theory.\n", "  In the present paper, we address a class of the fractional derivatives of\nconstant and variable orders for the first time. Fractional-order relaxation\nequations of constants and variable orders in the sense of Caputo type are\nmodeled from mathematical view of point. The comparative results of the\nanomalous relaxation among the various fractional derivatives are also given.\nThey are very efficient in description of the complex phenomenon arising in\nheat transfer.\n", "  We embed a thermal dark matter (DM) candidate within the clockwork framework.\nThis mechanism allows to stabilize the DM particle over cosmological time\nbecause it suppresses its decay into Standard Model (SM) particles. At the same\ntime, pair annihilations are unsuppressed, so that the relic density is set by\nthe usual freeze-out of the DM particle from the thermal bath. The slow decay\nof the DM candidate is induced by \"clockwork\" particles that can be quite light\n(rather than at some GUT or Planck scale) and could be searched for at current\nor future colliders. According to the scenario considered, the very same\nparticles also mediate the annihilation process, thus providing a connection\nbetween DM annihilation and DM decay, and fixing the mass scale of the\nclockwork states, otherwise unconstrained, to be in the TeV range or lighter.\nWe then show how this setup can minimally emerge from the deconstruction of an\nextra dimension in flat spacetime. Finally, we argue that the clockwork\nmechanism that we consider could induce Majorana neutrino masses, with a seesaw\nscale of order TeV or less and Yukawa couplings of order unity.\n", "  Lot of avenues, the black hole, the wormhole, the dark matter, the dark\nenergy etc. have been opened since the advent of General Theory of Relativity\nin 1915. Cosmology, the physics of creation and evolution of the universe,\nwhich was once thought to be beyond human perseverance, has now become a rich\nscience of highest importance. However, the theory of gravitation, the oldest\nknown interaction, is still not well understood. In the process of unveiling\nthe evolutionary history of the universe, we shall explore some facts that\nsuggest General Theory of Relativity is not the complete theory of gravitation.\n", "  Quasiparticle (QP) excitations are extremely important for understanding and\npredicting charge transfer and transport in molecules, nanostructures and\nextended systems. Since density functional theory (DFT) within the Kohn-Sham\n(KS) formulation does not provide reliable QP energies, many-body perturbation\ntechniques such as the GW approximation are essential. The main practical\ndrawback of GW implementations is the high computational scaling with system\nsize, prohibiting its use in extended, open boundary systems with many dozens\nof electrons or more. Recently, a stochastic formulation of GW (sGW) was\npresented [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 076402 (2014)] with a near-linear-scaling\ncomplexity, illustrated for a series of silicon nanocrystals reaching systems\nof more than 3000 electrons. This advance provides a route for many-body\ncalculations on very larges systems that were impossible with previous\napproaches. While earlier we have shown the gentle scaling of sGW, its accuracy\nwas not extensively demonstrated. Therefore, we show that this new sGW approach\nis very accurate by calculating the ionization energies of a group of\nsufficiently small molecules where a comparison to other GW codes is still\npossible. Using a set of 10 such molecules, we demonstrate that sGW provides\nreliable vertical ionization energies in close agreement with benchmark\ndeterministic GW results [J. Chem. Theory Comput, 11, 5665 (2015)], with mean\n(absolute) deviation of 0.05 and 0.09eV. For completeness, we also provide a\ndetailed review of the sGW theory and numerical implementation.\n", "  We investigate the metal-insulator Mott transition in a generalized version\nof the periodic Anderson model, in which a band of itinerant electrons is\nhybridrized with a narrow and strongly correlated band. Using dynamical\nmean-field theory, we show that the precondition for a Mott transition is an\ninteger total filling of the two bands, while for an integer constant\noccupation of the correlated band the system remains a correlated metal at\narbitrary large interaction strength. We picture the transition at a\nnon-integer filling of the correlated orbital as the Mott localization of the\nsinglet states between itinerant and strongly interacting electrons, having\noccupation of one per lattice site. We show that the Mott transition is of the\nfirst-order and we characterize the nature of the resulting insulating state\nwith respect to relevant physical parameters, such as the charge-transfer\nenergy.\n", "  We investigate the propagation of infinitesimal harmonic mechanical waves\nemitted from a boundary with variable velocity and arriving at a stationary\nobserver. In the classical Doppler effect, $X_\\mathrm{s}(t) = vt$ is the\nlocation of the source with constant velocity $v$. In the present work,\nhowever, we consider a source co-located with a moving boundary\n$x=X_\\mathrm{s}(t)$, where $X_\\mathrm{s}(t)$ can have an arbitrary functional\nform. For \"slowly moving\" boundaries (\\textit{i.e.}, ones for which the\ntimescale set by the mechanical motion is large in comparison to the inverse of\nthe frequency of the emitted wave), we present a multiple-scale asymptotic\nanalysis of the moving-boundary problem for the linear wave equation. We obtain\na closed-form leading-order (with respect to the latter small parameter)\nsolution and show that the variable velocity of the boundary results not only\nin frequency modulation but also in amplitude modulation of the received\nsignal. Consequently, our results extending the applicability of two basic\ntenets of the theory of a moving source on a stationary domain, specifically\nthat (a) $\\dot X_\\mathrm{s}$ for non-uniform boundary motion can be inserted in\nplace of the constant velocity $v$ in the classical Doppler formula and (b)\nthat the non-uniform boundary motion introduces variability in the amplitude of\nthe wave. The specific examples of decelerating and oscillatory boundary motion\nare worked out and illustrated.\n", "  We examine the relationship between social structure and sentiment through\nthe analysis of a large collection of tweets about the Irish Marriage\nReferendum of 2015. We obtain the sentiment of every tweet with the hashtags\n#marref and #marriageref that was posted in the days leading to the referendum,\nand construct networks to aggregate sentiment and use it to study the\ninteractions among users. Our results show that the sentiment of mention tweets\nposted by users is correlated with the sentiment of received mentions, and\nthere are significantly more connections between users with similar sentiment\nscores than among users with opposite scores in the mention and follower\nnetworks. We combine the community structure of the two networks with the\nactivity level of the users and sentiment scores to find groups of users who\nsupport voting `yes' or `no' in the referendum. There were numerous\nconversations between users on opposing sides of the debate in the absence of\nfollower connections, which suggests that there were efforts by some users to\nestablish dialogue and debate across ideological divisions. Our analysis shows\nthat social structure can be integrated successfully with sentiment to analyse\nand understand the disposition of social media users. These results have\npotential applications in the integration of data and meta-data to study\nopinion dynamics, public opinion modelling, and polling.\n", "  The implications of considering interaction between Chaplygin gas and a\nbarotropic fluid with constant equation of state have been explored. The unique\nfeature of this work is that assuming an interaction $Q \\propto H\\rho_d$,\nanalytic expressions for the energy density and pressure have been derived in\nterms of the Hypergeometric $_2\\text{F}_1$ function. It is worthwhile to\nmention that an interacting Chaplygin gas model was considered in 2006 by Zhang\nand Zhu, nevertheless, analytic solutions for the continuity equations could\nnot be determined assuming an interaction proportional to $H$ times the sum of\nthe energy densities of Chaplygin gas and dust. Our model can successfully\nexplain the transition from the early decelerating phase to the present phase\nof cosmic acceleration. Arbitrary choice of the free parameters of our model\nthrough trial and error show at recent observational data strongly favors\n$w_m=0$ and $w_m=-\\frac{1}{3}$ over the $w_m=\\frac{1}{3}$ case. Interestingly,\nthe present model also incorporates the transition of dark energy into the\nphantom domain, however, future deceleration is forbidden.\n", "  In this chapter, we present the state-of-the-art in the generation of\nnonclassical states of light using semiconductor cavity quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) platforms. Our focus is on the photon blockade effects that enable the\ngeneration of indistinguishable photon streams with high purity and efficiency.\nStarting with the leading platform of InGaAs quantum dots in optical\nnanocavities, we review the physics of a single quantum emitter strongly\ncoupled to a cavity. Furthermore, we propose a complete model for photon\nblockade and tunneling in III-V quantum dot cavity QED systems. Turning toward\nquantum emitters with small inhomogeneous broadening, we propose a direction\nfor novel experiments for nonclassical light generation based on group-IV\ncolor-center systems. We present a model of a multi-emitter cavity QED\nplatform, which features richer dressed-states ladder structures, and show how\nit can offer opportunities for studying new regimes of high-quality photon\nblockade.\n", "  Production of the $B_c$ and $B_c^*$ mesons at $Z$-factory (an $e^+e^-$\ncollider running at energies around $Z$ pole) is calculated up-to the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections. The results show that the\ndependence of the total cross sections on the renormalization scale $\\mu$ is\nreduced by the corrections, and the NLO corrections enhance the production\ncross section by $52\\%$($33\\%$) when the renormalization scale is taken at\n$\\mu=2m_b$. For experimental observations of the $B_c$ and $B_c^*$ mesons, the\ndifferential cross sections for the production are also analyzed up-to the NLO\naccuracy.\n", "  We study the evolution of the coupling in SU(2) gauge field theory with\n$N_f=8$ fundamental fermion flavors on the lattice. This model is expected to\nhave an infrared fixed point at high coupling. We use HEX-smeared Wilson-clover\naction, and measure the gradient flow running coupling with Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. Extrapolating our results to continuum, we find an infrared fixed\npoint at $g^2=8.24(59)^{+0.97}_{-1.64}$, with statistical and systematic error\nestimates. We also measure the anomalous dimension of the quark mass operator,\nand find its value at the fixed point $\\gamma \\approx 0.15 \\pm 0.02$.\n", "  The generalized Kawahara equation $u_t=a(t) u_{xxxxx} +b(t)u_{xxx} +c(t)f(u)\nu_x$ appears in many physical applications. A complete classification of\nlow-order conservation laws and point symmetries is obtained for this equation,\nwhich includes as a special case the usual Kawahara equation $u_t = \\alpha u\nu_x+\\beta u^2u_x +\\gamma u_{xxx}+\\mu u_{xxxxx}$. A general connection between\nconservation laws and symmetries for the generalized Kawahara equation is\nderived through the Hamiltonian structure of this equation and its relationship\nto Noether's theorem using a potential formulation.\n", "  The death of the massive stars due to supernova explosion is a key ingredient\nin stellar evolution, stellar population synthesis. The electron capture (EC)\nplays a vital role in supernovae explosions. According to the Shell-Model Monte\nCarlo (SMMC) method, basing onthe Random Phase Approximation (RPA) and Linear\nResponse Theory Model (LRTM), we study the strongly screening EC rates of\nnuclides $^{52, 53, 59, 60}$Fe in presupernova. The results show that the\nscreening rates can decrease about 18.66\\%. We compare our results with those\nof Fuller et al. (FFN), Aufderheide et al. (AUFD), and Nabi et al. (NKK)in the\ncase with and without strong electron screening(SES). For the case without SES,\nour calculations are in very good agreement with those of AUFD in relatively\nhigh density surroundings and the maximum error is within 0.35\\% at\n$\\rho_7=100$ (e. g., even-even nuclei $^{60}$Fe). However, for odd-A\nnuclei$^{59}$Fe, our rates are close to one, one, two order magnitude smaller\nthan those of FFN, AUFD, and NKK. For the case with SES, our screening results\nare about three, two orders magnitude, and 7.27\\% lower than those of FFN,\nAUFD, NKK for $^{60}$Fe, respectively, and it is lower about two, two orders\nmagnitude, and 12.42\\% than those of FFN, AUFD, NKK for odd-A nuclide\n$^{59}$Fe.\n", "  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been extensively studied in\nrecent years for its remarkable quantum coherence properties that make it an\nideal candidate for room temperature quantum computing and quantum sensing\nschemes. However, these schemes rely on spin-spin dipolar interactions, which\nrequire the NV centers to be within a few nanometers from each other while\nstill separately addressable, or to be in close proximity of the diamond\nsurface, where their coherence properties significantly degrade. Here we\ndemonstrate a method for overcoming these limitations using a hybrid yttrium\niron garnet (YIG)-nanodiamond quantum system constructed with the help of\ndirected assembly and transfer printing techniques. We show that YIG spin-waves\ncan amplify the oscillating field of a microwave source by more than two orders\nof magnitude and efficiently mediate its coherent interactions with an NV\ncenter ensemble. These results demonstrate that spin-waves in ferromagnets can\nbe used as quantum buses for enhanced, long-range qubit interactions, paving\nthe way to ultra-efficient manipulation and coupling of solid state defects in\nhybrid quantum networks and sensing devices.\n", "  The demand for low-dissipation nanoscale memory devices is as strong as ever.\nAs Moore's Law is staggering, and the demand for a low-power-consuming\nsupercomputer is high, the goal of making information processing circuits out\nof superconductors is one of the central goals of modern technology and\nphysics. So far, digital superconducting circuits could not demonstrate their\nimmense potential. One important reason for this is that a dense\nsuperconducting memory technology is not yet available. Miniaturization of\ntraditional superconducting quantum interference devices is difficult below a\nfew micrometers because their operation relies on the geometric inductance of\nthe superconducting loop. Magnetic memories do allow nanometer-scale\nminiaturization, but they are not purely superconducting (Baek et al 2014 Nat.\nCommun. 5 3888). Our approach is to make nanometer scale memory cells based on\nthe kinetic inductance (and not geometric inductance) of superconducting\nnanowire loops, which have already shown many fascinating properties (Aprili\n2006 Nat. Nanotechnol. 1 15; Hopkins et al 2005 Science 308 1762). This allows\nmuch smaller devices and naturally eliminates magnetic-field cross-talk. We\ndemonstrate that the vorticity, i.e., the winding number of the order\nparameter, of a closed superconducting loop can be used for realizing a\nnanoscale nonvolatile memory device. We demonstrate how to alter the vorticity\nin a controlled fashion by applying calibrated current pulses. A reliable\nread-out of the memory is also demonstrated. We present arguments that such\nmemory can be developed to operate without energy dissipation.\n", "  A spin-1 atomic gas in an optical lattice, in the unit-filling Mott Insulator\n(MI) phase and in the presence of disordered spin-dependent interaction, is\nconsidered. In this regime, at zero temperature, the system is well described\nby a disordered rotationally-invariant spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. We\nstudy, via the density matrix renormalization group algorithm, a bounded\ndisorder model such that the spin interactions can be locally either\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Random interactions induce the appearance\nof a disordered ferromagnetic phase characterized by a non-vanishing value of\nspin-glass order parameter across the boundary between a ferromagnetic phase\nand a dimer phase exhibiting random singlet order. The study of the\ndistribution of the block entanglement entropy reveals that in this region\nthere is no random singlet order.\n", "  Using the energy method we investigate the stability of pure conduction in\nPearson's model for B\\'enard-Marangoni convection in a layer of fluid at\ninfinite Prandtl number. Upon extending the space of admissible perturbations\nto the conductive state, we find an exact solution to the energy stability\nvariational problem for a range of thermal boundary conditions describing\nperfectly conducting, imperfectly conducting, and insulating boundaries. Our\nanalysis extends and improves previous results, and shows that with the energy\nmethod global stability can be proven up to the linear instability threshold\nonly when the top and bottom boundaries of the fluid layer are insulating.\nContrary to the well-known Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection setup, therefore,\nenergy stability theory does not exclude the possibility of subcritical\ninstabilities against finite-amplitude perturbations.\n", "  The so-called configurational entropy (CE) framework has proved to be an\nefficient instrument to study nonlinear scalar field models featuring solutions\nwith spatially-localized energy, since its proposal by Gleiser and Stamapoulos.\nTherefore, in this work, we apply this new physical quantity in order to\ninvestigate the properties of degenerate Bloch branes. We show that it is\npossible to construct a configurational entropy measure in functional space\nfrom the field configurations, where a complete set of exact solutions for the\nmodel studied displays both double and single-kink configurations. Our study\nshows a rich internal structure of the configurations, where we observe that\nthe field configurations undergo a quick phase transition, which is endorsed by\ninformation entropy. Furthermore, the Bloch configurational entropy is employed\nto demonstrate a high organisational degree in the structure of the\nconfigurations of the system, stating that there is a best ordering for the\nsolutions.\n", "  System of Majorana zero modes with random infinite range interactions -- the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- is thought to exhibit an intriguing relation\nto the horizons of extremal black holes in two-dimensional anti-de Sitter\n(AdS$_2$) space. This connection provides a rare example of holographic duality\nbetween a solvable quantum-mechanical model and dilaton gravity. Here we\npropose a physical realization of the SYK model in a solid state system. The\nproposed setup employs the Fu-Kane superconductor realized at the interface\nbetween a three dimensional topological insulator (TI) and an ordinary\nsuperconductor. The requisite $N$ Majorana zero modes are bound to a nanoscale\nhole fabricated in the superconductor that is threaded by $N$ quanta of\nmagnetic flux. We show that when the system is tuned to the surface neutrality\npoint (i.e. chemical potential coincident with the Dirac point of the TI\nsurface state) and the hole has sufficiently irregular shape, the Majorana zero\nmodes are described by the SYK Hamiltonian. We perform extensive numerical\nsimulations to demonstrate that the system indeed exhibits physical properties\nexpected of the SYK model, including thermodynamic quantities and two-point as\nwell as four-point correlators, and discuss ways in which these can be observed\nexperimentally.\n", "  We theoretically study the black-hole lasing phenomenon in a flowing\none-dimensional, coherently coupled two component atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate whose constituent atoms interact via a spin-dependent s-wave contact\ninteraction. We show by a numerical analysis the onset of the dynamical\ninstability in the spin branch of the excitations, once a finite supersonic\nregion is created in this branch. We study both a spatially homogeneous\ngeometry and a harmonically trapped condensate. Experimental advantages of the\ntwo-component configuration are pointed out, with an eye towards studies of\nback-reaction phenomena.\n", "  The emergence of structure through aggregation is a fascinating topic and of\nboth fundamental and practical interest. Here we demonstrate that\nself-generated solvent flow can be used to generate long-range attractions on\nthe colloidal scale, with sub-pico Newton forces extending into the\nmillimeter-range. We observe a rich dynamic behavior with the formation and\nfusion of small clusters resembling molecules, the dynamics of which is\ngoverned by an effective conservative energy that decays as $1/r$. Breaking the\nflow symmetry, these clusters can be made active.\n", "  Majorana boundary quasiparticles may naturally emerge in a spin-singlet\nsuperconductor with Rashba spin-orbit interactions, when a Zeeman magnetic\nfield breaks time-reversal symmetry. Their existence and robustness against\nadiabatic changes is deeply related, via a bulk-edge correspondence, to\ntopological properties of the band structure. The present paper shows that the\nspin-orbit may be responsible for topological transitions when the\nsuperconducting system has an underlying sublattice structure, as it appears in\na dimerized Peierls chain, graphene, and phosphorene. These systems, which\nbelong to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes class D, are found to have an extra symmetry\nthat plays the role of the parity. It enables the characterization of the\ntopology of the particle-hole symmetric band structure in terms of band\ninversions. The topological phase diagrams this leads to are then obtained\nanalytically and exactly. They reveal that, because of the underlying\nsublattice structure, the existence of topological superconducting phases\nrequires a minimum doping fixed by the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit.\nMajorana boundary quasiparticles are finally predicted to emerge when the Fermi\nlevel lies in the vicinity of the bottom (top) of the conduction (valence) band\nin semiconductors such as the dimerized Peierls chain and phosphorene. In a\ntwo-dimensional topological superconductor based on (stretched) graphene, which\nis semimetallic, Majorana quasiparticles cannot emerge at zero and low doping,\nthat is, when the Fermi level is close to the Dirac points. Nevertheless, they\nare likely to appear in the vicinity of the van Hove singularities.\n", "  We construct exact solutions representing a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robsertson-Walker (FLRW) universe in a generalized hybrid\nmetric-Palatini theory. By writing the gravitational action in a scalar-tensor\nrepresentation, the new solutions are obtained by either making an ansatz on\nthe scale factor or on the effective potential. Among other relevant results,\nwe show that it is possible to obtain exponentially expanding solutions for\nflat universes even when the cosmology is not purely vacuum. We then derive the\nclasses of actions for the original theory which generate these solutions.\n", "  We develop a microscopic formulation of dynamical spin injection in\nheterostructure comprising nonmagnetic metals in contact with ferromagnets. The\nspin pumping current is expressed in terms of Green's function of the\nnonmagnetic metal attached to the ferromagnet where a precessing magnetization\nis induced. The formulation allows for the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling and\ndisorder. The Green's functions involved in the expression for the current are\nexpressed in real-space lattice coordinates and can thus be efficiently\ncomputed using recursive methods.\n", "  We address the time evolution of two- and three-dimensional nonrelativistic\nGaussian wave packets in the presence of a weak external potential of arbitrary\nfunctional form. The focus of our study is the phenomenon of rotation of a\nGaussian wave packet around its center of mass, as quantified by mean angular\nmomentum computed relative to the wave packet center. Using a semiclassical\napproximation of the eikonal type, we derive an explicit formula for a\ntime-dependent change of mean angular momentum of a wave packet induced by its\ninteraction with a weak external potential. As an example, we apply our\nanalytical approach to the scenario of a two-dimensional quantum particle\ncrossing a tilted ridge potential barrier. In particular, we demonstrate that\nthe initial orientation of the particle wave packet determines the sense of its\nrotation, and report a good agreement between analytical and numerical results.\n", "  Based on the quantum renormalization group, we derive the bulk geometry that\nemerges in the holographic dual of the fermionic U(N) vector model at a nonzero\ncharge density. The obstruction that prohibits the metallic state from being\nsmoothly deformable to the direct product state under the renormalization group\nflow gives rise to a horizon at a finite radial coordinate in the bulk. The\nregion outside the horizon is described by the Lifshitz geometry with a\nhigher-spin hair determined by microscopic details of the boundary theory. On\nthe other hand, the interior of the horizon is not described by any Riemannian\nmanifold, as it exhibits an algebraic non-locality. The non-local structure\ninside the horizon carries the information on the shape of the filled Fermi\nsea.\n", "  By modeling macro-economical indicators using digital traces of human\nactivities on mobile or social networks, we can provide important insights to\nprocesses previously assessed via paper-based surveys or polls only. We\ncollected aggregated workday activity timelines of US counties from the\nnormalized number of messages sent in each hour on the online social network\nTwitter. In this paper, we show how county employment and unemployment\nstatistics are encoded in the daily rhythm of people by decomposing the\nactivity timelines into a linear combination of two dominant patterns. The\nmixing ratio of these patterns defines a measure for each county, that\ncorrelates significantly with employment ($0.46\\pm0.02$) and unemployment rates\n($-0.34\\pm0.02$). Thus, the two dominant activity patterns can be linked to\nrhythms signaling presence or lack of regular working hours of individuals. The\nanalysis could provide policy makers a better insight into the processes\ngoverning employment, where problems could not only be identified based on the\nnumber of officially registered unemployed, but also on the basis of the\ndigital footprints people leave on different platforms.\n", "  We revisit the rapidity dependence of the average transverse momentum\n$\\left\\langle p_{T}\\right\\rangle$ in a $pp$ and $pA$ collision, using the high\nenergy factorization (HEF). We update previous predictions for the\n$\\left\\langle p_{T}\\right\\rangle$ both in central and forward rapidity region\nusing parton densities following from extended BK and BFKL evolution equations\nto account for corrections of higher orders as well as one obtained by Sudakov\nresummation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the mid rapidity region the\nsaturation based formalisms predict increase of the transversal momentum while\nin the forward rapidity region the $\\left\\langle p_{T}(y)\\right\\rangle$\ndecreases.\n", "  This paper investigates bicovariant differential calculus on noncommutative\nspaces of the Lie algebra type. For a given Lie algebra $g_0$ we construct a\nLie superalgebra $g=g_0\\oplus g_1$ containing noncommutative coordinates and\none--forms. We show that $g$ can be extended by a set of generators $T_{AB}$\nwhose action on the enveloping algebra $U(g)$ gives the commutation relations\nbetween monomials in $U(g_0)$ and one--forms. Realizations of noncommutative\ncoordinates, one--forms and the generators $T_{AB}$ as formal power series in a\nsemicompleted Weyl superalgebra are found. In the special case $dim(g_0)=\ndim(g_1)$ we also find a realization of the exterior derivative on $U(g_0)$.\nThe realizations of these geometric objects yield a bicovariant differential\ncalculus on $U(g_0)$ as a deformation of the standard calculus on the Euclidean\nspace.\n", "  The resonant substructure of $D^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays is studied\nusing data collected by the CLEO-c detector. An amplitude analysis is performed\nin order to disentangle the various intermediate state contributions. To limit\nthe model complexity a data driven regularization procedure is applied. The\nprominent contributions are the decay modes $D^0\\to a_1(1260)^+\\pi^-$, $D^0\\to\n\\sigma f_0(1370)$ and $D^0 \\to \\rho(770)^0 \\rho(770)^0$. The broad resonances\n$a_1(1260)^+$, $\\pi(1300)^+$ and $a_1(1640)^+$ are studied in detail, including\nquasi-model-independent parametrizations of their lineshapes. The mass and\nwidth of the $a_1(1260)^+$ meson are determined to be\n$m_{a_1(1260)^+}=[1225\\pm9\\text{(stat)}\\pm17\\text{(syst)}\\pm10\\text{(model)}]\\text{MeV}/c^2$\nand $\\Gamma_{a_1(1260)^+}=[430\\pm24\\text{(stat)}\\pm25\n\\text{(syst)}\\pm18\\text{(model)}]\\text{MeV}$. The amplitude model of $D^0\\to\nK^+K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays obtained from CLEO II.V, CLEO III, and CLEO-c data is\nrevisited with improved lineshape parametrizations. The largest components are\nthe decay modes $D^0\\to\\phi(1020)\\rho(770)^0$, $D^0 \\to K_1(1270)^+ K^-$ and\n$D^0 \\to K(1400)^+ K^-$. The fractional $CP$-even content of the decay $D^0\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ is calculated from the amplitude model to be\n$F_+^{4\\pi}=[72.9\\pm0.9\\text{(stat)}\\pm1.5\\text{(syst)}\\pm1.0\\text{(model)}]\\%$,\nconsistent with that obtained from a previous model-independent measurement.\nFor $D^0 \\to K^+K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays, the $CP$-even fraction is measured for\nthe first time and found to be\n$F_+^{KK\\pi\\pi}=[75.3\\pm1.8\\text{(stat)}\\pm3.3\\text{(syst)}\\pm3.5\\text{(model)}]\\%$.\nThe global decay rate asymmetries between $D^0$ and $\\overline{D}^0$ decays are\nmeasured to be\n$A^{4\\pi}_{CP}=[+0.54\\pm1.04\\text{(stat)}\\pm0.51\\text{(syst)}]\\%$ and\n$A^{KK\\pi\\pi}_{CP}=[+1.84\\pm1.74\\text{(stat)}\\pm0.30\\text{(syst)}]\\%$.\n", "  Photometric redshift estimation is an indispensable tool of precision\ncosmology. One problem that plagues the use of this tool in the era of\nlarge-scale sky surveys is that the bright galaxies that are selected for\nspectroscopic observation do not have properties that match those of (far more\nnumerous) dimmer galaxies; thus, ill-designed empirical methods that produce\naccurate and precise redshift estimates for the former generally will not\nproduce good estimates for the latter. In this paper, we provide a principled\nframework for generating conditional density estimates (i.e. photometric\nredshift PDFs) that takes into account selection bias and the covariate shift\nthat this bias induces. We base our approach on the assumption that the\nprobability that astronomers label a galaxy (i.e. determine its spectroscopic\nredshift) depends only on its measured (photometric and perhaps other)\nproperties x and not on its true redshift. With this assumption, we can\nexplicitly write down risk functions that allow us to both tune and compare\nmethods for estimating importance weights (i.e. the ratio of densities of\nunlabeled and labeled galaxies for different values of x) and conditional\ndensities. We also provide a method for combining multiple conditional density\nestimates for the same galaxy into a single estimate with better properties. We\napply our risk functions to an analysis of approximately one million galaxies,\nmostly observed by SDSS, and demonstrate through multiple diagnostic tests that\nour method achieves good conditional density estimates for the unlabeled\ngalaxies.\n", "  Using a formalism based on the two-body S-matrix we study two-dimensional\nBose and Fermi gases with both attractive and repulsive interactions.\nApproximate analytic expressions, valid at weak coupling and beyond, are\ndeveloped and applied to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition.\nWe successfully recover the correct logarithmic functional form of the critical\nchemical potential and density for the Bose gas. For fermions, the BKT critical\ntemperature is calculated in BCS and BEC regimes through consideration of Tan's\ncontact.\n", "  We evaluated the body wave attenuation parameter in Kopili region of\nnortheast India. Using the modified algorithm of coda normalization method, we\ndelineated frequency-dependent attenuation for both P and S waves. Taking more\nthan 300 seismograms as input, we comprehensively studied microearthquake\nspectra in the frequency range of 1.5 to 12 Hz. The estimated values of\n$Q_P^{-1}$ and $Q_S^{-1}$ show strong frequency dependence. The relationships\nemerge to be $Q_P^{-1}=(23.8\\pm 6)\\times10^{-3}f^{-1.2\\pm 0.008}$ and\n$Q_S^{-1}=(10.2\\pm 2)\\times10^{-3}f^{-1.3\\pm 0.02}$, respectively. The ratio\n$Q_P^{-1}/Q_S^{-1}$ is found to be larger than unity for the entire frequency\nband which implies profound seismic activity and macroscale heterogeneity\nprevailing in the region. The study may act as the building block towards\ndetermination of source parameter and hazard related studies in the region.\n", "  We critically review the literature on the Debye absorption peak of liquid\nwater and the excess response found on the high frequency side of the Debye\npeak. We find a lack of agreement on the microscopic phenomena underlying both\nof these features. To better understand the molecular origin of Debye peak we\nran large scale molecular dynamics simulations and performed several different\ndistance-dependent decompositions of the low frequency dielectric spectra,\nfinding that it involves processes that take place on scales of 1.5-2.0 nm. We\nalso calculated the $k$-dependence of the Debye relaxation, finding it to be\nhighly dispersive. These findings are inconsistent with models that relate\nDebye relaxation to local processes such as the rotation/translation of\nmolecules after H-bond breaking. We introduce the spectrumfitter Python package\nfor fitting dielectric spectra and analyze different ways of fitting the high\nfrequency excess, such as including one or two additional Debye peaks. We\npropose using the generalized Lydanne-Sachs-Teller (gLST) equation as a way of\ntesting the physicality of model dielectric functions. Our attempts at fitting\nthe experimental spectrum using the gLST relation as a constraint indicate that\nthe traditional way of fitting the excess response with secondary and tertiary\nDebye relaxations is problematic. All of our work is consistent with the recent\ntheory of Popov et al. (2016) that Debye relaxation is due to the migration of\nBjerrum-like defects in the hydrogen bond network. Under this theory, the\nmechanism of Debye relaxation in liquid water is similar to the mechanism in\nice, but the heterogeneity and power-law dynamics of the H-bond network in\nwater results in excess response on the high frequency side of the peak.\n", "  The Weyl semimetal NbP exhibits an extremely large magnetoresistance (MR) and\nan ultra-high mobility. The large MR originates from a combination of the\nnearly perfect compensation between electron- and hole-type charge carriers and\nthe high mobility, which is relevant to the topological band structure. In this\nwork we report on temperature- and field-dependent thermopower and thermal\nconductivity experiments on NbP. Additionally, we carried out complementary\nheat capacity, magnetization, and electrical resistivity measurements. We found\na giant adiabatic magnetothermopower with a maximum of 800 $\\mu$V/K at 50 K in\na field of 9 T. Such large effects have been observed rarely in bulk materials.\nWe suggest that the origin of this effect might be related to the high\ncharge-carrier mobility. We further observe pronounced quantum oscillations in\nboth thermal conductivity and thermopower. The obtained frequencies compare\nwell with our heat capacity and magnetization data.\n", "  We present measurements of interspecies thermalization between ultracold\nsamples of $^{133}$Cs and either $^{174}$Yb or $^{170}$Yb. The two species are\ntrapped in a far-off-resonance optical dipole trap and $^{133}$Cs is\nsympathetically cooled by Yb. We extract effective interspecies thermalization\ncross sections by fitting the thermalization measurements to a rate equation\nmodel, giving $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Cs^{174}Yb}} = \\left(5 \\pm 2\\right) \\times\n10^{-13} \\, \\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Cs^{170}Yb}} = \\left(18 \\pm\n8\\right) \\times 10^{-13} \\, \\mathrm{cm^{2}}$. We perform quantum scattering\ncalculations of the thermalization cross sections and optimize the CsYb\ninteraction potential to reproduce the measurements. We predict scattering\nlengths for all isotopic combinations of Cs and Yb. We also demonstrate the\nindependent production of $^{174}$Yb and $^{133}$Cs Bose-Einstein condensates\nusing the same optical dipole trap, an important step towards the realization\nof a quantum-degenerate mixture of the two species.\n", "  Snake orbits are trajectories of charge carriers curving back and forth which\nform at an interface where either the magnetic field direction or the charge\ncarrier type are inverted. In ballistic samples their presence is manifested in\nthe appearance of magnetoconductance oscillations at small magnetic fields.\nHere we show that signatures of snake orbits can also be found in the opposite\ndiffusive transport regime. We illustrate this by studying the classical\nmagnetotransport properties of carbon tubular structures subject to relatively\nweak transversal magnetic fields where snake trajectories appear in close\nproximity to the zero radial field projections. In carbon nanoscrolls the\nformation of snake orbits leads to a strongly directional dependent positive\nmagnetoresistance with an anisotropy up to 80%.\n", "  We investigate the role of gap characteristics such as anisotropy and\ninequality of the gaps in the quasiparticle interferences of iron pnictides\nusing a five-orbital tight-binding model. We examine how the difference in the\nsensitivities exhibited by the sign-changing and -preserving $s$-wave\nsuperconductivity in an annular region around ($\\pi, 0$), which can be used to\ndetermine the sign change of the superconducting gap, gets affected when the\ngaps are unequal on the electron and hole pocket. In addition, we also discuss\nhow robust these differentiating features are on changing the quasiparticle\nenergy or when the gap is anisotropic.\n", "  Co3Si was recently reported to exhibit remarkable magnetic properties in the\nnanoparticle form [Appl. Phys. Lett. 108, 152406 (2016)], yet better\nunderstanding of this material is to be promoted. Here we report a study on the\ncrystal structures of Co3Si using adaptive genetic algorithm, and discuss its\nelectronic and magnetic properties from first-principles calculations. Several\ncompeting phases of Co3Si have been revealed from our calculations. We show\nthat the hexagonal Co3Si structure reported in experiments has lower energy in\nnon-magnetic state than ferromagnetic state at zero temperature. The\nferromagnetic state of the hexagonal structure is dynamically unstable with\nimaginary phonon modes and transforms to a new orthorhombic structure, which is\nconfirmed by our structure searches to have the lowest energy for both Co3Si\nand Co3Ge. Magnetic properties of the experimental hexagonal structure and the\nlowest-energy structures obtained from our structure searches are investigated\nin detail.\n", "  The outcoupling of a Bose-Einstein condensate through an optical lattice\nprovides an interesting scenario to study quantum transport phenomena or the\nanalog Hawking effect as the system can reach a quasi-stationary black-hole\nconfiguration. We devote this work to characterize the quantum transport\nproperties of quasi-particles on top of this black-hole configuration by\ncomputing the corresponding scattering matrix. We find that most of the\nfeatures can be understood in terms of the usual Schr\\\"odinger scattering. In\nparticular, a transmission band appears in the spectrum, with the normal-normal\ntransmission dominating over the anomalous-normal one. We show that this\npicture still holds in a realistic experimental situation where the actual\nGaussian envelope of the optical lattice is considered. A peaked resonant\nstructure is displayed near the upper end of the transmission band, which\nsuggests that the proposed setup is a good candidate to provide a clear signal\nof spontaneous Hawking radiation.\n", "  We comment on the Friedmann and Hagen's quantum mechanical derivation of the\nWallis formula for $\\pi$. In particular, we demonstrate that not only the\nGaussian trial function, used by Friedmann and Hagen, but also the Lorentz\ntrial function can be used to get the Wallis formula. The anatomy of the\nintegrals leading to the appearance of the Wallis ratio is carefully revealed.\n", "  1T-TaS$_2$ is unique among transition metal dichalcogenides in that it is\nunderstood to be a correlation driven insulator, where the unpaired electron in\na 13 site cluster experiences enough correlation to form a Mott insulator. We\nargue based on existing data that this well-known material should be considered\nas a quantum spin liquid, either a fully gapped $Z2$ spin liquid or a Dirac\nspin liquid. We discuss the exotic states that emerge upon doping and propose\nfurther experimental probes.\n", "  The interaction blockade phenomenon isolates the motion of a single quantum\nparticle within a multi-particle system, in particular for coherent\noscillations in and out of a region affected by the blockade mechanism. For\nidentical quantum particles with Bose statistics, the presence of the other\nparticles is still felt by a bosonic stimulation factor $\\sqrt{N}$ that speeds\nup the coherent oscillations, where $N$ is the number of bosons. Here we\npropose an experiment to observe this enhancement factor with a small number of\nbosonic atoms. The proposed protocol realises an asymmetric double well\npotential with multiple optical tweezer laser beams. The ability to adjust bias\nindependently of the coherent coupling between the wells allows the potential\nto be loaded with different particle numbers while maintaining the resonance\ncondition needed for coherent oscillations. Numerical simulations with up to\nthree bosons in a realistic potential generated by three optical tweezers\npredict that the relevant avoided level crossing can be probed and the expected\nbosonic enhancement factor observed.\n", "  We study the implications of the heavy-quark spin symmetry for the possible\nspin partners of the exotic states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ in the\nspectrum of bottomonium. We formulate and solve numerically the coupled-channel\nequations for the $Z_b$ states that allow for a dynamical generation of these\nstates as hadronic molecules. The force includes short-range contact terms and\nthe one-pion exchange potential, both treated fully nonperturbatively. The\nstrength of the potential at leading order is fixed completely by the pole\npositions of the $Z_b$ states such that the mass and the most prominent\ncontributions to the width of the isovector heavy-quark spin partner states\n$W_{bJ}$ with the quantum numbers $J^{++}$ ($J=0,1,2$) come out as predictions.\nSince the accuracy of the present experimental data does not allow one to fix\nthe pole positions of the $Z_b$'s reliably enough, we also study the pole\ntrajectories of their spin partner states as functions of the $Z_b$ binding\nenergies. It is shown that, once the heavy-quark spin symmetry is broken by\nmeans of the physical $B$ and $B^*$ masses, especially the pion tensor force\nhas a significant impact on the location of the partner states clearly\ndemonstrating the need of a coupled-channel treatment of pion dynamics to\nunderstand the spin multiplet pattern of hadronic molecules.\n", "  Understanding how ideas relate to each other is a fundamental question in\nmany domains, ranging from intellectual history to public communication.\nBecause ideas are naturally embedded in texts, we propose the first framework\nto systematically characterize the relations between ideas based on their\noccurrence in a corpus of documents, independent of how these ideas are\nrepresented. Combining two statistics --- cooccurrence within documents and\nprevalence correlation over time --- our approach reveals a number of different\nways in which ideas can cooperate and compete. For instance, two ideas can\nclosely track each other's prevalence over time, and yet rarely cooccur, almost\nlike a \"cold war\" scenario. We observe that pairwise cooccurrence and\nprevalence correlation exhibit different distributions. We further demonstrate\nthat our approach is able to uncover intriguing relations between ideas through\nin-depth case studies on news articles and research papers.\n", "  Electroweak baryogenesis is severely challenged in its traditional settings:\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and in more general two Higgs\ndoublet models. Fine tuning of parameters is required, or large couplings\nleading to a Landau pole at scales just above the new physics introduced. The\nsituation is somewhat better in models with a singlet scalar coupling to the\nHiggs so as to give a strongly first order phase transition due to a tree-level\nbarrier, but even in this case no UV complete models had been demonstrated to\ngive successful baryogenesis. Here we point out some directions that overcome\nthis limitation, by introducing a new source of CP violation in the couplings\nof the singlet field. A model of electroweak baryogenesis requiring no fine\ntuning and consistent to scales far above 1 TeV is demonstrated, in which dark\nmatter plays the leading role in creating a CP asymmetry that is the source of\nthe baryon asymmetry.\n", "  We use high temperature series expansions to study the $\\pm J$ Ising\nspin-glass in a magnetic field in $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices for $d=5,\n6, 7$ and $8$, and in the infinite-range Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model.\nThe expansions are obtained in the variable $w=\\tanh^2{J/T}$ for arbitrary\nvalues of $u=\\tanh^2{h/T}$ complete to order $w^{10}$. We find that the scaling\ndimension $\\Delta$ associated with the ordering-field $h^2$ equals $2$ in the\nSK model and for $d\\ge 6$. However, in agreement with the work of Fisher and\nSompolinsky, there is a violation of scaling in a finite field, leading to an\nanomalous $h$-$T$ dependence of the Almeida-Thouless (AT) line in high\ndimensions, while scaling is restored as $d \\to 6$. Within the convergence of\nour series analysis, we present evidence supporting an AT line in $d\\ge 6$. In\n$d=5$, the exponents $\\gamma$ and $\\Delta$ are substantially larger than\nmean-field values, but we do not see clear evidence for the AT line in $d=5$.\n", "  As new concepts of sending interstellar spacecraft to the nearest stars are\nnow being investigated by various research teams, crucial questions about the\ntiming of such a vast financial and labor investment arise. If humanity could\nbuild high-speed interstellar lightsails and reach the alpha Centauri system 20\nyr after launch, would it be better to wait a few years, then take advantage of\nfurther technology improvements to increase the speed, and arrive earlier\ndespite waiting? The risk of being overtaken by a future, faster probe has been\ndescribed earlier as the incentive trap. Based on 211 yr of historical data, we\nfind that the speed growth of human-made vehicles, from steam-driven\nlocomotives to Voyager 1, is much faster than previously believed, about 4.72 %\nannually or a doubling every 15 yr. We derive the mathematical framework to\ncalculate the minimum of the wait time (t) plus travel time (tau(t)) and extend\ntwo exponential growth law models into the relativistic regime. We show that\nthe minimum of t+tau(t) disappears for nearby targets. There is no use of\nwaiting for speed improvements once we can reach an object within about 20 yr\nof travel, irrespective of the actual speed. In terms of speed, the t+tau(t)\nminimum for a travel to alpha Centauri will occur once 19.6 % the speed of\nlight (c) become available, in agreement with the 20 % c proposed by the\nBreakthrough Starshot Initiative. If interstellar travel at 20 % c can be\nobtained within 45 yr from today and if the kinetic energy could be increased\nat a rate consistent with the historical record, then humans can reach the ten\nmost nearby stars within 100 yr from today.\n", "  We study the correction of the energy spectrum of a gravitational quantum\nwell due to the combined effect of the braneworld model with infinite extra\ndimensions and generalized uncertainty principle. The correction terms arise\nfrom a natural deformation of a semiclassical theory of quantum gravity\ngoverned by the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation based on a minimal length\nframework. The two fold correction in the energy yields new values of the\nspectrum, which are closer to the values obtained in the GRANIT experiment.\nThis raises the possibility that the combined theory of the semiclassical\nquantum gravity and the generalized uncertainty principle may provide an\nintermediate theory between the semiclassical and the full theory of quantum\ngravity. We also prepare a schematic experimental set-up which may guide to the\nunderstanding of the phenomena in the laboratory.\n", "  We study the sticking rate of atomic hydrogen to suspended graphene using\nfour different methods that include contributions from processes with\nmultiphonon emission. We compare the numerical results of the sticking rate\nobtained by: (1) the loop expansion of the atom self-energy, (2) the\nnon-crossing approximation (NCA), (3) the independent boson model approximation\n(IBMA), and (4) a leading-order soft-phonon resummation method (SPR). The loop\nexpansion reveals an infrared problem, analogous to the infamous infrared\nproblem in QED. The 2-loop contribution to the sticking rate gives a result\nthat tends to diverge for large membranes. The latter three methods remedy this\ninfrared problem and give results that are finite in the limit of an infinite\nmembrane. We find that for micromembranes (sizes ranging 100 nm to 10 $\\mu$m),\nthe latter three methods give results that are in good agreement with each\nother and yield sticking rates that are mildly suppressed relative to the\nlowest-order golden rule rate. Lastly, we find that the SPR sticking rate\ndecreases slowly to zero with increasing membrane size, while both the NCA and\nIBMA rates tend to a nonzero constant in this limit. Thus, approximations to\nthe sticking rate can be sensitive to the effects of soft-phonon emission for\nlarge membranes.\n", "  Long-range interacting Hamiltonian systems are believed to relax generically\ntowards non-equilibrium states called \"quasi-stationary\" because they evolve\ntowards thermodynamic equilibrium very slowly, on a time-scale diverging with\nparticle number. We show here that, by applying a suitable perturbation\noperator for a finite time interval, we obtain, in a family of long-range\nsystems, non-equilibrium states which appear to be strictly stationary. They\nexist even in the case of a harmonic potential, and are characterised by an\nordered microscopic phase space structure. We give some simple heuristic\narguments which predict reasonably well some properties of these states.\n", "  We use a large sample of $\\sim 350,000$ galaxies constructed by combining the\nUKIDSS UDS, VIDEO/CFHT-LS, UltraVISTA/COSMOS and GAMA survey regions to probe\nthe major merging histories of massive galaxies ($>10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$)\nat $0.005 < z < 3.5$. We use a method adapted from that presented in\nLopez-Sanjuan et al. (2014) using the full photometric redshift probability\ndistributions, to measure pair $\\textit{fractions}$ of flux-limited, stellar\nmass selected galaxy samples using close-pair statistics. The pair fraction is\nfound to weakly evolve as $\\propto (1+z)^{0.8}$ with no dependence on stellar\nmass. We subsequently derive major merger $\\textit{rates}$ for galaxies at $>\n10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and at a constant number density of $n > 10^{-4}$\nMpc$^{-3}$, and find rates a factor of 2-3 smaller than previous works,\nalthough this depends strongly on the assumed merger timescale and likelihood\nof a close-pair merging. Galaxies undergo approximately 0.5 major mergers at $z\n< 3.5$, accruing an additional 1-4 $\\times 10^{10}\\ \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in the\nprocess. Major merger accretion rate densities of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ are found for number density selected\nsamples, indicating that direct progenitors of local massive\n($>10^{11}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) galaxies have experienced a steady supply of\nstellar mass via major mergers throughout their evolution. While pair fractions\nare found to agree with those predicted by the Henriques et al. (2014)\nsemi-analytic model, the Illustris hydrodynamical simulation fails to\nquantitatively reproduce derived merger rates. Furthermore, we find major\nmergers become a comparable source of stellar mass growth compared to\nstar-formation at $z < 1$, but is 10-100 times smaller than the SFR density at\nhigher redshifts.\n", "  We present a novel device that can offer two extremes of elastic wave\npropagation --- nearly complete transmission and strong attenuation under\nimpulse excitation. The mechanism of this highly tunable device relies on\nintermixing effects of dispersion and nonlinearity. The device consists of\nidentical cylinders arranged in a chain, which interact with each other as per\nnonlinear Hertz's contact law. For a `dimer' configuration, i.e., two different\ncontact angles alternating in the chain, we analytically, numerically, and\nexperimentally show that impulse excitation can either propagate as a localized\nwave, or it can travel as a highly dispersive wave. Remarkably, these extremes\ncan be achieved in this periodic arrangement simply by \\textit{in-situ} control\nof contact angles between cylinders. We close the discussion by highlighting\nthe key characteristics of the mechanisms that facilitate strong attenuation of\nincident impulse. These include low frequency to high frequency (LF-HF)\nscattering, and turbulence-like cascading in a periodic system. We thus\nenvision that these adaptive, cylinder-based nonlinear phononic crystals, in\nconjunction with conventional impact mitigation mechanisms, could be used to\ndesign highly tunable and efficient impact manipulation devices.\n", "  We show how to treat the superconformal algebras with eight Poincar\\'e\nsupercharges in a unified manner for spacetime dimension $2 < d\\leq 6$. This\nformalism is ideally suited for analyzing the quadratic Casimir operator of the\nsuperconformal algebra and its use in deriving superconformal blocks. We\nillustrate this by an explicit construction of the superconformal blocks, for\nany value of the spacetime dimension, for external protected scalar operators\nwhich are the lowest component of flavor current multiplets.\n", "  Low dissipation data processing with spins is one of the promising directions\nfor future information and communication technologies. Despite a signifcant\nprogress, the available magnonic devices are not broadband yet and have\nrestricted capabilities to redirect spin waves. Here we propose a breakthrough\napproach to the spin wave manipulation in patterned magnetic nanostructures\nwith unmatched characteristics, which exploits spin waves analogous to edge\nwaves propagating along a water-wall boundary. Using theory, micromagnetic\nsimulations and experiment we investigate spin waves propagating along the\nedges in magnetic structures, under an in-plane DC magnetic field inclined with\nrespect to the edge. The proposed edge spin waves overcome important challenges\nfaced by previous technologies such as the manipulation of the spin wave\npropagation direction, and they substantially improve the capability of\ntransmitting information at frequencies exceeding 10 GHz. The concept of the\nedge spin waves allows to design broad range of logic devices such as\nsplitters, interferometers, or edge spin wave transistors with unprecedented\ncharacteristics and potentially strong impact on information technologies.\n", "  We present Very Large Array observations of the 33 GHz radio continuum\nemission from 22 local ultraluminous and luminous infrared (IR) galaxies\n(U/LIRGs). These observations have spatial (angular) resolutions of 30--720 pc\n(0.07\"-0.67\") in a part of the spectrum that is likely to be optically thin.\nThis allows us to estimate the size of the energetically dominant regions. We\nfind half-light radii from 30 pc to 1.7 kpc. The 33 GHz flux density correlates\nwell with the IR emission, and we take these sizes as indicative of the size of\nthe region that produces most of the energy. Combining our 33 GHz sizes with\nunresolved measurements, we estimate the IR luminosity and star formation rate\nper area, and the molecular gas surface and volume densities. These quantities\nspan a wide range (4 dex) and include some of the highest values measured for\nany galaxy (e.g., $\\mathrm{\\Sigma_{SFR}^{33GHz} \\leq 10^{4.1} M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}\nkpc^{-2}}$). At least $13$ sources appear Compton thick ($\\mathrm{N_{H}^{33GHz}\n\\geq 10^{24} cm^{-2}}$). Consistent with previous work, contrasting these data\nwith observations of normal disk galaxies suggests a nonlinear and likely\nmulti-valued relation between SFR and molecular gas surface density, though\nthis result depends on the adopted CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor and the\nassumption that our 33 GHz sizes apply to the gas. 11 sources appear to exceed\nthe luminosity surface density predicted for starbursts supported by radiation\npressure and supernovae feedback, however we note the need for more detailed\nobservations of the inner disk structure. U/LIRGs with higher surface\nbrightness exhibit stronger [{\\sc Cii}] 158$\\mu$m deficits, consistent with the\nsuggestion that high energy densities drive this phenomenon.\n", "  Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to\nLandau quantization and magneto-oscillatory behavior in their properties.\nCryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these oscillations. We\nshow that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum\noscillations that do not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are\nextremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of\nonly a few T. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the\nelectronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience\neffectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per\nsuperlattice unit cell. Our work points at unexplored physics in Hofstadter\nbutterfly systems at high temperatures.\n", "  We test the viability of a single fluid cosmological model containing a\ntransition from a dark-matter-like regime to a dark-energy-like regime. The\nfluid is a k-essence scalar field with a well-defined Lagrangian. We constrain\nits model parameters with a combination of geometric probes and conclude that\nthe evidence for this model is similar to the evidence for $\\Lambda$CDM. In\naddition, we find a lower bound for the rapidity of the transition, implying\nthat fast transitions are favored with respect to slow ones even at background\nlevel.\n", "  In this paper, we demonstrate that compactification in M-theory can lead to a\ndeformation of field theory consistent with the generalized uncertainty\nprinciple (GUP).We observe that the matter fields in the M3-brane action\ncontain higher derivative terms. We demonstrate that such terms can also be\nconstructed from a reformulation of the field theory by the GUP. In fact, we\nwill construct the Heisenberg algebra consistent with this deformation, and\nexplicitly demonstrate it to be the Heisenberg algebra obtained from the GUP.\nThus, we use compactification in M-theory to motivate for the existence of the\nGUP.\n", "  We study marginally compact macromolecular trees that are created by means of\ntwo different fractal generators. In doing so, we assume Gaussian statistics\nfor the vectors connecting nodes of the trees. Moreover, we introduce bond-bond\ncorrelations that make the trees locally semiflexible. The symmetry of the\nstructures allows an iterative construction of full sets of eigenmodes\n(notwithstanding the additional interactions that are present due to\nsemiflexibility constraints), enabling us to get physical insights about the\ntrees' behavior and to consider larger structures. Due to the local stiffness\nthe self-contact density gets drastically reduced.\n", "  Solving Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation with interatomic force constants\n(IFCs) from first-principles calculations has been a widely used method for\npredicting lattice thermal conductivity of three-dimensional materials. With\nthe increasing research interests in two-dimensional materials, this method is\ndirectly applied to them but different works show quite different results. In\nthis work, classical potential was used to investigate the effect of the\naccuracy of IFCs on the predicted thermal conductivity. Inaccuracies were\nintroduced to the third-order IFCs by generating errors in the input forces.\nWhen the force error lies in the typical value from first-principles\ncalculations, the calculated thermal conductivity would be quite different from\nthe benchmark value. It is found that imposing translational invariance\nconditions cannot always guarantee a better thermal conductivity result. It is\nalso shown that Gr\\\"uneisen parameters cannot be used as a necessary and\nsufficient criterion for the accuracy of third-order IFCs in the aspect of\npredicting thermal conductivity.\n", "  The Z-vector method in the relativistic coupled-cluster framework is used to\ncalculate magnetic hyperfine structure constant ($A_J$) of alkali metals and\nsingly charged alkaline earth metals in their ground state electronic\nconfiguration. The Z-vector results are in very good agreement with the\nexperiment. The $A_J$ values of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Be$^{+}$, Mg$^{+}$,\nCa$^{+}$, and Sr$^{+}$ obtained in the Z-vector method are compared with the\nextended coupled-cluster results taken from Phys. Rev. A 91, 022512 (2015). The\nsame basis and cutoff are used for the comparison purpose. The comparison shows\nthat Z-vector method with the singles and double approximation can produce more\nprecise wavefunction in the nuclear region than the ECC method.\n", "  Orbital angular momentum is a fundamental degree of freedom of light that\nmanifests itself even at the single photon level. The coherent generation and\nbeaming of structured light usually requires bulky and slow components. Using\nwave singularities known as bound states in continuum, we report an integrated\ndevice that simultaneously generates and beams powerful coherent beams carrying\norbital angular momentum. The device brings unprecedented opportunities in the\nmanipulation of micro-particles and micro-organisms, and, will also find\napplications in areas such as biological sensing, microscopy, astronomy, and,\nhigh-capacity communications.\n", "  In this work, we review previously developed coarse-grained (CG) particle\nmodels for biological membrane and red blood cells (RBCs) and discuss the\nadvantages of the CG particle method over the continuum and atomic simulations\non modeling biological phenomena. CG particle models can largely increase the\nlength scale and time scale of atomic simulations by eliminating fast degrees\nof freedom while preserving the mesoscopic structures and properties of the\nsimulated system. One the other hand, CG particle models can be used to capture\nmicrostructural alternations in diseased RBCs and simulate topological changes\nof biological membrane and RBCs, which are major challenges to typical\ncontinuum representations of membrane and RBCs. The power and versatility of\nthe CG particle methods are demonstrated through simulating the dynamical\nprocesses involving significant topological changes, such as lipid\nself-assembly, vesicle fusion and membrane budding.\n", "  In this letter, we will analyse the deformation of a semi-classical\ngravitational system from minimal measurable length scale. In the\nsemi-classical approximation, the gravitational field will be analysed as a\nclassical field, and the matter fields will be treated quantum mechanically.\nThus, using this approximation, this system will be represented by a\ndeformation of Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation by the generalised uncertainty\nprinciple (GUP). We will analyse the effects of this GUP deformed\nSchr\\\"odinger-Newton equation on the behaviour of such a semi-classical\ngravitational system. As the quantum mechanical virial theorem can be obtained\nusing the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation, a short distance modification of the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Newton equation will also result in a short distance modification\nof the quantum mechanical virial theorem.\n", "  Optical molecular tomographic imaging is to reconstruct the concentration\ndistribution of photon-molecular probes in a small animal from measured photon\nfluence rates. The localization and quantification of molecular probes is\nrelated to tissue optical properties. The optical parameters can be\nreconstructed by the optimization method, in which the objective function is\nnot convex, and there are multiple local optimal solutions. The gradient-based\noptimization algorithm could converge prematurely to an inaccurate solution if\nthe initial guess is not close enough to the true solution. In this paper, we\ndevelop a hybrid algorithm combined global optimization and gradient-based\noptimization methods to reconstruct optical parameters. Differential evolution\nis an effective global optimizer, and could yield an estimated solution near\nthe global optimal region to eliminate the need of initial guess of the optical\nparameters. The gradient-based optimization method is further performed with\ninitial values obtained from DE to obtain local optimal solution for more\naccurate reconstruction of optical parameters. This proposed reconstruction\nmethod is evaluated by comprehensive numerical simulation experiments. The\nresults show that the proposed method is stable and accurate for the\nreconstruction of optical parameters.\n", "  In this work we consider an association of meromorphic Jacobi forms of\nhalf-integral index to the pure D-type cases of umbral moonshine, and solve the\nmodule problem for four of these cases by constructing vertex operator\nsuperalgebras that realise the corresponding meromorphic Jacobi forms as graded\ntraces. We also present a general discussion of meromorphic Jacobi forms with\nhalf-integral index and their relationship to mock modular forms.\n", "  The latest results from the H1 and ZEUS collaborations which challenge the\nQCD description of high energy $ep$ collisions are presented. Data from HERA\ncontinue to provide precision measurements and are compared to the latest\ntheoretical predictions. Measurements of new processes are also presented as\nwell as investigation of regions where perturbative QCD fails to describe the\ndata. Four themes are presented here. Measurements of hard QCD processes,\nprompt photon and jet production, are used to compare to the latest theoretical\npredictions and, in the case of jet production, used to make high-precision\nextractions of the strong coupling constant up to next-next-to-leading order in\nQCD. All H1 and ZEUS charm and beauty cross sections in deep inelastic\nscattering have been combined and used to extract heavy-quark masses, including\nthe running of the charm-quark mass with the scale of the process.\nFactorisation in diffraction has been investigated in charm production in deep\ninelastic scattering and prompt photon production in diffractive\nphotoproduction has been measured for the first time. Finally, the inclusive\ndata on deep inelastic scattering is presented in various forms in order to\nallow investigation of the underlying mechanism at very low photon virtuality\n$Q^2$ and low Bjorken $x$.\n", "  The non-extensive canonical ensemble theory is reconsidered with the method\nof Lagrange multipliers by maximizing Tsallis entropy, with the constraint that\nthe normalized term of Tsallis' $q-$average of physical quantities, the sum\n$\\sum p_j^q$, is independent of the probability $p_i$ for Tsallis parameter\n$q$. The self-referential problem in the deduced probability and thermal\nquantities in non-extensive statistics is thus avoided, and thermodynamical\nrelationships are obtained in a consistent and natural way. We also extend the\nstudy to the non-extensive grand canonical ensemble theory and obtain the\n$q$-deformed Bose-Einstein distribution as well as the $q$-deformed Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution. The theory is further applied to the generalized Planck law to\ndemonstrate the distinct behaviors of the various generalized $q$-distribution\nfunctions discussed in literature.\n", "  We present a model for quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) by an aqueous\nsolution of compact and inflexible molecules. This model accounts for\ntime-dependent spatial pair correlations between the atoms of the same as well\nas of distinct molecules and includes all coherent and incoherent neutron\nscattering contributions. The extension of the static theory of the excluded\nvolume effect [A. K. Soper, J. Phys.:Condens. Matter 9, 2399 (1997)] to the\ntime-dependent (dynamic) case allows us to obtain simplified model expressions\nfor QENS spectra in the low Q region in the uniform fluid approximation. The\nresulting expressions describe the quasielastic small-angle neutron scattering\n(QESANS) spectra of D2O solutions of native and methylated cyclodextrins well,\nyielding in particular translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of\nthese compounds in aqueous solution. Finally, we discuss the full potential of\nthe QESANS analysis (that is, beyond the uniform fluid approximation), in\nparticular, the information on solute-solvent interactions (e.g., hydration\nshell properties) that such an analysis can provide, in principle.\n", "  Much attention has been given in the literature to the effects of\nastrophysical events on human and land-based life. However, little has been\ndiscussed on the resilience of life itself. Here we instead explore the\nstatistics of events that completely sterilise an Earth-like planet with planet\nradii in the range $0.5-1.5 R_{Earth}$ and temperatures of $\\sim 300 \\;\n\\text{K}$, eradicating all forms of life. We consider the relative likelihood\nof complete global sterilisation events from three astrophysical sources --\nsupernovae, gamma-ray bursts, large asteroid impacts, and passing-by stars. To\nassess such probabilities we consider what cataclysmic event could lead to the\nannihilation of not just human life, but also extremophiles, through the\nboiling of all water in Earth's oceans. Surprisingly we find that although\nhuman life is somewhat fragile to nearby events, the resilience of Ecdysozoa\nsuch as \\emph{Milnesium tardigradum} renders global sterilisation an unlikely\nevent.\n", "  Semi-hard processes in the large COM energy limit offer us an exclusive\nchance to test the dynamics behind strong interactions in kinematical sectors\nso far unexplored. In the Regge limit, fixed-order calculations in pQCD based\non collinear factorisation miss the effect of large energy logs, which are so\nlarge to compensate the small QCD coupling $\\alpha_s$ and must therefore be\naccounted for to all perturbative orders.. The BFKL approach represents the\nmost powerful tool to resum to all orders these large logs both in the LLA and\nin the NLA. The inclusive hadroproduction of forward jets with high transverse\nmomenta separated by a large rapidity interval at the LHC (Mueller--Navelet\njets) has been one of the most studied reactions so far. Interesting\nobservables associated to this process are the azimuthal correlations, showing\na very good agreement with experimental data at the LHC. However, new\nBFKL-sensitive observables should be considered in the context of the LHC\nphysics program. With the aim the to further and deeply probe the dynamics of\nQCD in the Regge limit, we give phenomenological predictions for four distinct\nsemi-hard process. On one hand, we continue the analysis of reactions with two\nobjects identified in the final state $(i)$ by addressing open problems in the\nMueller--Navelet sector and $(ii)$ by studying the inclusive dihadron\nproduction in the full NLA BKFL accuracy. On the other hand, we show how\ninclusive multi-jet production processes allow us to define new, generalised\nand suitable BFKL observables, where transverse momenta and rapidities of the\ntagged jets, well separated in rapidity from each other, appear in new\ncombinations. We give the first predictions for the inclusive three-jet\nproduction, encoding the effects of higher-order BFKL corrections. Then, making\nuse of the same formalism, we present the first complete BFKL analysis for the\nfour-jet production.\n", "  Context. In 1998 the first accreting millisecond pulsar, SAX J1808.4-3658,\nwas discovered and to date 18 systems showing coherent, high frequency (> 100\nHz) pulsations in low mass X-ray binaries are known. Since their discovery,\nthis class of sources has shown interesting and sometimes puzzling behaviours.\nIn particular, apart from a few exceptions, they are all transient with very\nlong X-ray quiescent periods implying a quite low averaged mass accretion rate\nonto the neutron star. Among these sources, XTE J0929-314 has been detected in\noutburst just once in about 15 years of continuous monitoring of the X-ray sky.\nAims. We aim to demonstrate that a conservative mass transfer in this system\nwill result in an X-ray luminosity that is higher than the observed, long-term\naveraged X-ray luminosity. Methods. Under the hypothesis of a conservative mass\ntransfer driven by gravitational radiation, as expected for this system given\nthe short orbital period of about 43.6 min and the low mass of the companion\nimplied by the mass function derived from timing techniques, we calculate the\nexpected mass transfer rate in this system and predict the long-term averaged\nX-ray luminosity. This is compared with the averaged, over 15 years, X-ray flux\nobserved from the system, and a lower limit of the distance to the source is\ninferred. Results. This distance is shown to be > 7.4 kpc in the direction of\nthe Galactic anticentre, implying a large height, > 1.8 kpc, of the source with\nrespect to the Galactic plane, placing the source in an empty region of the\nGalaxy. We suggest that the inferred value of the distance is unlikely.\n(abridged)\n", "  This white paper summarizes the workshop \"U.S. Cosmic Visions: New Ideas in\nDark Matter\" held at University of Maryland on March 23-25, 2017.\n", "  Machine learning methods are being explored in many areas of science, with\nthe aim of finding solution to problems that evade traditional scientific\napproaches due to their complexity. In general, an order parameter capable of\nidentifying two different phases of matter separated by a correspond- ing phase\ntransition is constructed based on symmetry arguments. This parameter measures\nthe degree of order as the phase transition proceeds. However, when the two\ndistinct phases are highly disordered it is not trivial to identify broken\nsymmetries with which to find an order parameter. This poses an excellent\nproblem to be addressed using machine learning procedures. Room tem- perature\nliquid water is hypothesized to be a supercritical liquid, with fluctuations of\ntwo different molecular orders associated to two parent liquid phases, one with\nhigh density and another one with low density. The validity of this hypothesis\nis linked to the existence of an order parameter capable of identifying the two\ndistinct liquid phases and their fluctuations. In this work we show how two\ndifferent machine learning procedures are capable of recognizing local order in\nliquid water. We argue that when in order to learn relevant features from this\ncomplexity, an initial, physically motivated preparation of the available data\nis as important as the quality of the data set, and that machine learning can\nbecome a successful analysis tool only when coupled to high level physical\ninformation.\n", "  Despite the importance and vulnerability of small island nations and their\necosystems, they frequently have insufficient observations to provide baseline\nor long-term perspectives on climate variability and change, and global model\nexperiments rarely have the resolution to include them. Many studies in\nobservational climatology, climate modeling, and paleoclimate thus depend to\nvarying degrees on an approximation equating near-surface marine and\nterrestrial island climates, often with direct implications for island\nsocieties and resources. Here we investigate the validity of this\napproximation, and by extension the viability of offshore moorings to serve as\nproxies for island climate variability, by comparing monthly mean observations\non a diverse set of 17 islands across the global tropics with those from ocean\nmoorings proximate to each island. While some island-mooring pairs exhibit a\nmean offset in surface air temperature, these cannot be explained as a simple\nfunction of one parameter including distance from the mooring, station\nelevation, or island dimensions. Overall, the seasonal to interannual\nvariability in near-surface climate at monthly time scales at meteorological\nstations on tropical islands is captured remarkably well by moorings positioned\nup to 1,000 km offshore.\n", "  Dynamic simulations of the isotropic-nematic phase transformation of liquid\ncrystal droplets under homeotropic anchoring are found to predict chiral\nsymmetry-breaking dynamics. These observations occur when using material\nparameters for pentyl-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) but not under the single elastic\nconstant approximation of this material, frequently used in simulation. The\ntwisting dynamic process occurs during the relaxation of the domain from an\nunstable radial texture to a stable uniform texture and involves simultaneous\ndefect loop motion and twisting of the bulk nematic texture.\n", "  The population of nearby dwarf galaxies in the Local Group constitutes a\ncomplete galactic environment, perfect suited for studying the connection\nbetween stellar populations and galaxy evolution. In this study, we are\nconducting an optical monitoring survey of the majority of dwarf galaxies in\nthe Local Group, with the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT), to identify long period\nvariable stars (LPVs). These stars are at the end points of their evolution and\ntherefore their luminosity can be directly translated into their birth masses;\nthis enables us to reconstruct the star formation history. By the end of the\nmonitoring survey, we will have performed observations over ten epochs, spaced\napproximately three months apart, and identified long period, dust-producing\nAGB stars; five epochs of data have been obtained already. LPVs are also the\nmain source of dust; in combination with Spitzer Space Telescope images at\nmid-IR wavelengths we will quantify the mass loss, and provide a detailed map\nof the mass feedback into the interstellar medium. We will also use the\namplitudes in different optical passbands to determine the radius variations of\nthe stars, and relate this to their mass loss.\n", "  The creeping flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid in a non--uniform pore\nthroat is investigated analytically. The analytical solution determines the\nflow regimes and the transition point from Newtonian to the power law flow\nregime. As an application of the new model, a regular lattice--based pore\nnetwork model is constructed to simulate the flows of shear--thinning and\nshear--thickening fluids through porous media. The pore throats have\nconvergent--divergent geometries.\n", "  It is well known that in quantum mechanics we cannot always define\nconsistently properties that are context independent. Many approaches exist to\ndescribe contextual properties, such as Contextuality by Default (CbD), sheaf\ntheory, topos theory, and non-standard or signed probabilities. In this paper\nwe propose a treatment of contextual properties that is specific to quantum\nmechanics, as it relies on the relationship between contextuality and\nindistinguishability. In particular, we propose that if we assume the\nontological thesis that quantum particles or properties can be\nindistinguishable yet different, no contradiction arising from a\nKochen-Specker-type argument appears: when we repeat an experiment, we are in\nreality performing an experiment measuring a property that is indistinguishable\nfrom the first, but not the same. We will discuss how the consequences of this\nmove may help us understand quantum contextuality.\n", "  The ability to highly localize light with strong electric field enhancement\nis critical for enabling higher efficiency solar cells, light sources, and\nmodulators. While deep subwavelength modes can be realized with plasmonic\nresonators, large losses in these metal structures preclude most practical\napplications. We developed an alternative approach to achieving subwavelength\nconfinement that is not accompanied by inhibitive losses. We experimentally\ndemonstrate a dielectric bowtie photonic crystal structure that supports mode\nvolumes commensurate with plasmonic elements and quality factors that reveal\nultra-low losses. Our approach opens the door to the extremely strong\nlight-matter interaction regime with simultaneously both ultra-low mode volume\nand ultra-high quality factor that has remained elusive in optical resonators.\n", "  Slave rotor mean field (SRMF) theory is employed to study exciton formation\nin the extended Falicov-Kimball Model (EFKM). In this theory, charge and spin\n(or orbital) degrees are treated as independent degrees of freedom, coupled by\na constraint. Using this formalism in single as well as cluster extension, we\ncapture the effective many body scales beyond conventional mean-field theory.\nWhile the formation of exciton is favored by the interband hybridization $V$,\nit is strongly influenced by the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$. Beyond a\ncritical hybridization, there is a condensation of exciton, effectively giving\nrise to a crossover from metal to an excitonic insulator phase. The system goes\nfrom a metal to an excitonic insulating state, with a first order jump in the\nexcitonic order parameter. Moreover, the behavior of excitonic averages differs\nfrom earlier results from Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. Low-$U$ results show\nthat excitonic order parameter ($\\Delta$) is continuous across the transition\nboth for single as well as two-site approximation. The transition changes to\nweakly first order in the intermediate $U$ for cluster case. On the other hand,\nlarge $U$ limit shows a continuous transition for cluster but remains first\norder in the single-site approximation. The slave rotor also indicates an\nexcitonic metallic region in both single and cluster cases, while there is an\norbital liquid in the insulating regime in the cluster theory. The $\\Delta-V$\ngraph shows step-like behavior when both the bands have the same parity. For\ncluster approximation, a second order to first order transition in $\\Delta-V$\nis obtained by tuning the hopping parameter of the localized band.\n", "  Vanadium substituted SrM hexaferrites (SrFe12-xVxO19 with x = 0.2, 0.4) and\nEu-substituted BaM hexaferrite (Ba0.8Eu0.2Fe12O19) were prepared by high energy\nball milling and sintering at 1200{\\deg} C. X-ray diffraction measurements\nrevealed that the V-substituted SrM samples exhibited phase separation\nresulting in the coexistence of the pure SrM magnetic phase with nonmagnetic\nSr3(VO4)2 vanadate and {\\alpha}-Fe2O3 iron oxide phase. Also, the\nEu-substituted BaM hexaferrite revealed the formation of the pure BaM phase\ncoexisting with {\\alpha}-Fe2O3 secondary phase, and Eu-garnet minor phase.\nAlthough the magnetic properties of the samples deteriorated with respect to\npure hexaferrite properties, the magnetic parameters of the substituted samples\nwere found to be of potential importance for practical applications. Further,\nthe results of the study suggest methods for the preparation of high quality\nSrM hexaferrites, and hexaferrite/garnet composites.\n", "  Single-electron transistors would represent an approach for less power\nconsuming microelectronic devices if room-temperature operation and\nindustry-compatible fabrication were possible. We present a concept based on\nstripes of small, self-assembled, colloidal, metal nanoparticles on a back-gate\ndevice architecture which leads to well-defined and well-controllable\ntransistor characteristics. This Coulomb transistor has three main advantages:\nBy employing the scalable Langmuir-Blodgett method we combine high-quality\nchemically synthesized metal nanoparticles with standard lithography\ntechniques. The resulting transistors show on/off ratios above 90 %, reliable\nand sinusoidal Coulomb oscillations and room-temperature operation.\nFurthermore, this concept allows for versatile tuning of the device properties\nlike Coulomb-energy gap, threshold voltage, as well as period, position and\nstrength of the oscillations.\n", "  In this paper, we prove that $K_G(3)<K_G(4)$, where $K_G(d)$ denotes the\nGrothendieck constant of order $d$. To this end, we use a branch-and-bound\nalgorithm commonly used in the solution of NP-hard problems. It has recently\nbeen proven that $K_G(3)\\le 1.4644$. Here we prove that $K_G(4)\\ge 1.4841$,\nwhich has implications for device-independent witnessing dimensions greater\nthan two. Furthermore, the algorithm with some modifications may find\napplications in various black-box quantum information tasks with large number\nof inputs and outputs.\n", "  The results are presented for eclipsing binary KIC 2557430. The mass ratio\nwas computed as 0.868+-10.002, while the inclination (i) was found as\n69.75+-0.01 deg with T2=6271+-1 K. 50 frequencies were found in the period\nanalysis. 48 frequencies of them are caused due to the primary component, a\nGamma Doradus star, while two of them are caused by the cool spots. 69 flares\nwere detected in the analyses. Two OPEA models were derived for flares, which\nindicates that the flares were come from two different sources. The Plateau\nvalue was found to be 1.4336+-0.1104 s for Source 1, which is seen as possible\nthe secondary component and 0.7550+-0.0677 s for Source 2, which is seen as\npossible third body. The half-life value was computed as 2278.1 s for Group 1\nand 1811.2 s for Group 2. The flare frequency N1 was found to be 0.02726 h-1\nand N2 was computed as 0.00002 for Group 1, while N1 was found to be 0.01977\nh-1 and N2 was computed as 0.00001 for Group 2. In a results, KIC 2557430 is a\npossible triple system consisting of a Gamma Doradus-type star, a\nchromospherically active star, and also a flaring third body.\n", "  21 st century astrophysicists are confronted with the herculean task of\ndistilling the maximum scientific return from extremely expensive and complex\nspace- or ground-based instrumental projects. This paper concentrates in the\nmining of the time series catalog produced by the European Space Agency Gaia\nmission, launched in December 2013. We tackle in particular the problem of\ninferring the true distribution of the variability properties of Cepheid stars\nin the Milky Way satellite galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\nClassical Cepheid stars are the first step in the so-called distance ladder: a\nseries of techniques to measure cosmological distances and decipher the\nstructure and evolution of our Universe. In this work we attempt to unbias the\ncatalog by modelling the aliasing phenomenon that distorts the true\ndistribution of periods. We have represented the problem by a 2-level\ngenerative Bayesian graphical model and used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nalgorithm for inference (classification and regression). Our results with\nsynthetic data show that the system successfully removes systematic biases and\nis able to infer the true hyperparameters of the frequency and magnitude\ndistributions.\n", "  The superconductivity of the 4-angstrom single-walled carbon nanotubes\n(SWCNTs) was discovered more than a decade ago, and marked the breakthrough of\nfinding superconductivity in pure elemental undoped carbon compounds. The van\nHove singularities in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level in\ncombination with a large Debye temperature of the SWCNTs are expected to cause\nan impressively large superconducting gap. We have developed an innovative\ncomputational algorithm specially tailored for the investigation of\nsuperconductivity in ultrathin SWCNTs. We predict the superconducting\ntransition temperature of various thin carbon nanotubes resulting from\nelectron-phonon coupling by an ab-initio method, taking into account the effect\nof radial pressure, symmetry, chirality (N,M) and bond lengths. By optimizing\nthe geometry of the carbon nanotubes, a maximum Tc of 60K is found. We also use\nour method to calculate the Tc of a linear carbon chain embedded in the center\nof (5,0) SWCNTs. The strong curvature in the (5,0) carbon nanotubes in the\npresence of the inner carbon chain provides an alternative path to increase the\nTc of this carbon composite by a factor of 2.2 with respect to the empty (5,0)\nSWCNTs.\n", "  We have conducted a near-infrared monitoring campaign at the UK InfraRed\nTelescope (UKIRT), of the Local Group spiral galaxy M 33 (Triangulum). A new\nmethod has been developed by us to use pulsating giant stars to reconstruct the\nstar formation history of galaxies over cosmological time as well as using them\nto map the dust production across their host galaxies. In first Instance the\ncentral square kiloparsec of M33 was monitored and long period variable stars\n(LPVs) were identified. We give evidence of two epochs of a star formation rate\nenhanced by a factor of a few. These stars are also important dust factories,\nwe measure their dust production rates from a combination of our data with\nSpitzer Space Telescope mid-IR photometry. Then the monitoring survey was\nexpanded to cover a much larger part of M33 including spiral arms. Here we\npresent our methodology and describe results for the central square kiloparsec\nof M33 (Javadi et al. 2011 a,b,c, 2013) and disc of M33 (Javadi et al. 2015,\n2016, 2017, and in preparation).\n", "  We have carried out an analysis of magnetic data in 69 uranium, 7 neptunium\nand 4 plutonium ferromagnets with the spin fluctuation theory developed by\nTakahashi (Y. Takahashi, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 55, 3553 (1986)). The basic and\nspin fluctuation parameters of the actinide ferromagnets are determined and the\napplicability of the spin fluctuation theory to actinide 5f system has been\ndiscussed. Itinerant ferromagnets of the 3d transition metals and their\nintermetallics follow a generalized Rhodes-Wohlfarth relation between p_eff/p_s\nand T_C/T_0, viz., p_eff/p_s ~ (T_C/T_0)^(-3/2). Here, p_s, p_eff, T_C, and T_0\nare the spontaneous and effective magnetic moments, the Curie temperature and\nthe width of spin fluctuation spectrum in energy space, respectively. The same\nrelation is satisfied for T_C/T_0 < 1.0 in the actinide ferromagnets. However,\nthe relation is not satisfied in a few ferromagnets with T_C/T_0 ~1.0 that\ncorresponds to local moment system in the spin fluctuation theory. The\ndeviation from the theoretical relation may be due to several other effects not\nincluded in the spin fluctuation theory such as the crystalline electric field\neffect on the 5f electrons from ligand atoms. The value of the spontaneous\nmagnetic moment p_s increases linearly as a function of T_C/T_0 in the uranium\nand neptunium ferromagnets below (T_C/T_0)_kink = 0.32 +- 0.02 where a kink\nstructure appears in relation between the two quantities. p_s increases more\nweakly above (T_C/T_0)_kink. A possible interpretation with the\nT_C/T_0-dependence of p_s is given.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger equation for hydrogen-like atom with Coulomb\npotential and non-point ball nucleus. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the\noperator given by an arbitrary rotation-invariant boundary value problem on the\nspherical boundary of the nucleus are found and as it is proved to be the\neigenvalues are independent on selection of any such boundary value problem and\nthey are the same as for point nucleus.\n", "  The ways of portrayal of the pressure evolution of the glass temperature (Tg)\nbeyond the dominated Simon-Glatzel-like pattern are discussed. This includes\nthe possible common description of Tg(P) dependences in systems described by\ndtg/dP>0 and dTg/dP<0. The latter is associated with the maximum of Tg(P) curve\nhidden in the negative pressures domain. The issue of volume and density\nchanges along the vitrification curve is also noted. Finally, the universal\npattern of vitrification associated with the crossover from the low density\n(isotropic stretching) to the high density (isotropic compression) systems is\nproposed. Hypothetically, it may obey any glass former, from molecular liquids\nto colloids.\n", "  Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of the eutectic NaK alloy are performed\nusing the Second Moment Approximation (SMA) model potential across a wide range\nof temperatures at constant pressure. The alloy structure and thermodynamics\nare analyzed along with the atomic level structures using a variety of\nstructure identification methods. Both enthalpy and density are followed along\nan annealing process that reveals a clear melting point around 250 K. At lower\ntemperatures, two thermodynamic branches are identified as crystalline and\namorphous solids.\n", "  The time translation operator for neutrino mass states is often taken to be\n$e^{-iEt/\\hbar}$. This is not relativistically invariant. In kaon mixing,\nphysicists use $e^{-imc^2\\tau/\\hbar}$ where $\\tau$ is the proper time of the\nkaon state. The factor $mc^2\\tau$ is the rest frame value of the four vector\nproduct $p_\\mu x^\\mu$ which is an invariant quantity. If $-i p_\\mu x^\\mu$ is\nused in neutrino oscillation formulae instead of $-iEt$, the scale of the\n$\\Delta m^2_{ij}$ is reduced by a factor of two.\n", "  A possibility to excite a stable self-oscillation in a perpendicularly\nmagnetized ferromagnet by the spin Hall effect is investigated theoretically.\nIt had been shown that such self-oscillation cannot be stabilized solely by the\ndirect spin torque by the spin Hall effect. Here, we consider adding another\nferromagnet, referred to as pinned layer, on the free layer. The pinned layer\nprovides another spin torque through the reflection of the spin current. The\nstudy shows that the stable self-oscillation is excited by the additional spin\ntorque when the magnetization in the pinned layer is tilted from the film\nplane.\n", "  Materials design and development typically takes several decades from the\ninitial discovery to commercialization with the traditional trial and error\ndevelopment approach. With the accumulation of data from both experimental and\ncomputational results, data based machine learning becomes an emerging field in\nmaterials discovery, design and property prediction. This manuscript reviews\nthe history of materials science as a disciplinary the most common machine\nlearning method used in materials science, and specifically how they are used\nin materials discovery, design, synthesis and even failure detection and\nanalysis after materials are deployed in real application. Finally, the\nlimitations of machine learning for application in materials science and\nchallenges in this emerging field is discussed.\n", "  Extraterrestrial gamma-ray astronomy is now a source of new knowledge in the\nfields of astrophysics, cosmic-ray physics, and the nature of dark matter. The\nnext absolutely necessary step in the development of extraterrestrial\nhigh-energy gamma-ray astronomy is the improvement of the physical and\ntechnical characteristics of gamma-ray telescopes, especially the angular and\nenergy resolutions. Such a new generation telescope will be GAMMA-400.\nGAMMA-400, currently developing gamma-ray telescope, together with X-ray\ntelescope will precisely and detailed observe in the energy range of ~20 MeV to\n~1000 GeV and 3-30 keV the Galactic plane, especially, Galactic Center, Fermi\nBubbles, Crab, Cygnus, etc. The GAMMA- 400 will operate in the highly elliptic\norbit continuously for a long time with the unprecedented angular (~0.01{\\deg}\nat E{\\gamma} = 100 GeV) and energy (~1% at E{\\gamma} = 100 GeV) resolutions\nbetter than the Fermi-LAT, as well as ground gamma-ray telescopes, by a factor\nof 5-10. GAMMA-400 will permit to resolve gamma rays from annihilation or decay\nof dark matter particles, identify many discrete sources (many of which are\nvariable), to clarify the structure of extended sources, to specify the data on\nthe diffuse emission.\n", "  The future GAMMA-400 space mission is aimed for the study of gamma rays in\nthe energy range from ~20 MeV up to ~1 TeV. The observations will carry out\nwith GAMMA-400 gamma-ray telescope installed on-board the Russian Space\nObservatory. We present the detailed description of the architecture and\nperformances of scientific data acquisition system (SDAQ) developing by SRISA\nfor the GAMMA-400 instrument. SDAQ provides the collection of the data from\ntelescope detector subsystems (up to 100 GB per day), the preliminary\nprocessing of scientific information and its accumulation in mass memory,\ntransferring the information from mass memory to the satellite high-speed radio\nline for its transmission to the ground station, the control and monitoring of\nthe telescope subsystems. SDAQ includes special space qualified chipset\ndesigned by SRISA and has scalable modular net structure based on fast and\nhigh-reliable serial interfaces.\n", "  This article consider a situation of SU(N) system with broken symmetry, and\ntherefore the spin-liquid phase is exist in the phase transition stage.

The appearance of spin liquid due to noncolline mechanism which\ncausing by destruction of long range order in this model is mentioned. In a\nN-site fermion-model system, I analyse the effect of fluctuation on order and\nphase transition. As well as this N-component spin system with disordered spin,\nthe critical phenomenon is showed to reflect the fluctuation effection on\nprocess of phase transtion.\n", "  Photodetachment thermometry on a beam of OH$^-$ in a cryogenic storage ring\ncooled to below 10 K is carried out using two-dimensional, frequency and time\ndependent photodetachment spectroscopy over 20 minutes of ion storage. In\nequilibrium with the low-level blackbody field, we find an effective radiative\ntemperature near 15 K with about 90% of all ions in the rotational ground\nstate. We measure the J = 1 natural lifetime (about 193 s) and determine the\nOH$^-$ rotational transition dipole moment with 1.5% uncertainty. We also\nmeasure rotationally dependent relative near-threshold photodetachment cross\nsections for photodetachment thermometry.\n", "  Precise control of elastic waves in modes and coherences is of great use in\nreinforcing nowadays elastic energy harvesting/storage, nondestructive testing,\nwave-mater interaction, high sensitivity sensing and information processing,\netc. All these implementations are expected to have elastic transmission with\nlower transmission losses and higher degree of freedom in transmission path.\nInspired by topological states of quantum matters, especially quantum spin Hall\neffects (QSHEs) providing passive solutions of unique disorder-immune surface\nstates protected by underlying nontrivial topological invariants of the bulk,\nthus solving severe performance trade-offs in experimentally realizable\ntopologically ordered states. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the first\nelastic analogue of QSHE, by a concise phononic crystal plate with only\nperforated holes. Strong elastic spin-orbit coupling is realized accompanied by\nthe first topologically-protected phononic circuits with both robustness and\nnegligible propagation loss overcoming many circuit- and system-level\nperformance limits induced by scattering. This elegant approach in a monolithic\nsubstrate opens up the possibility of realizing topological materials for\nphonons in both static and time-dependent regimes, can be immediately applied\nto multifarious chip-scale devices with both topological protection and massive\nintegration, such as on-chip elastic wave-guiding, elastic splitter, elastic\nresonator with high quality factor, and even (pseudo-)spin filter.\n", "  The manuscript studies a 3+N+1-dimensional space in which the N extra\ndimensions are dynamically compact. The 3 large dimensions, behaving as the\nspacial part of the FRW metric, possess a different scale factor in comparison\nwith the N extra ones, making the whole space anisotropic. The possible effects\ncaused by the existence of a common time-like coordinate between the compact\ndimensions and our 3-dimensional hypersurface are investigated. The higher\ndimensional Friedmann-Like equations of the mentioned model are achieved. The\ncontinuity equation is reached at the special case of 3+4+1-dimensional metric.\nIt is shown that not only the existence of the extra dimensions itself but also\nthe pressure difference between the 3-dimensional hypersurface and the compact\ndimensions might get probed on the hypersurface as an additive source of\ngravity with the same behavior as baryonic matter. Furthermore, the relation\nbetween the coupling constant of the higher-dimensional universe and the\nNewton's constant of gravitation is investigated to reach an estimated limit\nfor it. As another aim, the literature studies the role of dimensionality on\nthe behavior of the higher-dimensional Friedmann equations.\n", "  We demonstrate the stimulated Raman near-field microscopy of few molecules,\nmeasured only using near-field optical forces thereby eliminating the need for\nfar-field optical detection. The molecules were excited in the near-field\nwithout resonant electronic enhancement. We imaged gold nanoparticles of 30 nm\ndiameter functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of\n4-nitrobenzenethiol (4-NBT) molecules. The maximum number of molecules detected\nby the gold-coated nano-probe at the position of maximum field enhancement\ncould be fewer than 20 molecules. The molecules were imaged by vibrating an\nAtomic Force Microscope (AFM) cantilever on its second flexural eigenmode\nenabling the tip to be controlled much closer to the sample thereby improving\nthe detected signal-to-noise ratio when compared to vibrating the cantilever on\nits first flexural eigenmode. We also demonstrate the implementation of\nstimulated Raman nanoscopy measured using photon-induced force with\nnon-collinear pump and stimulating beams which could have applications in\npolarization dependent Raman nanoscopy and spectroscopy and pump-probe\nnano-spectroscopy particularly involving infrared beam/s.\n", "  The modified Camassa-Holm equation (also called FORQ) is one of numerous\n$cousins$ of the Camassa-Holm equation possessing non-smoth solitons\n($peakons$) as special solutions. The peakon sector of solutions is not\nuniquely defined: in one peakon sector (dissapative) the Sobolev $H^1$ norm is\nnot preserved, in the other sector (conservative), introduced in [2], the time\nevolution of peakons leaves the $H^1$ norm invariant. In this Letter, it is\nshown that the conservative peakon equations of the modified Camassa-Holm can\nbe given an appropriate Poisson structure relative to which the equations are\nHamiltonian and, in fact, Liouville integrable. The latter is proved directly\nby exploiting the inverse spectral techniques, especially asymptotic analysis\nof solutions, developed elsewhere (in [3]).\n", "  We study strong hyperbolicity of first order partial differential equations\nfor systems with differential constraints. In these cases, the number of\nequations is larger than the unknown fields, therefore, the standard Kreiss\nnecessary and sufficient conditions of strong hyperbolicity do not directly\napply. To deal with this problem one introduces a new tensor, called a\nreduction, which selects a subset of equations with the aim of using them as\nevolution equations for the unknown. If that tensor leads to a strongly\nhyperbolic system we call it a hyperbolizer. There might exist many of them or\nnone.\n  A question arises on whether a given system admits any hyperbolization at\nall. To sort-out this issue, we look for a condition on the system, such that,\nif it is satisfied, there is no hyperbolic reduction. To that purpose we look\nat the singular value decomposition of the whole system and study certain one\nparameter families ($\\varepsilon $) of perturbations of the principal symbol.\nWe look for the perturbed singular values around the vanishing ones and show\nthat if they behave as $O\\left( \\varepsilon ^{l}\\right) $, with $l\\geq 2$, then\nthere does not exist any hyperbolizer. In addition, we further notice that the\nvalidity or failure of this condition can be established in a simple and\ninvariant way.\n  Finally we apply the theory to examples in physics, such as Force-Free\nElectrodynamics in Euler potentials form and charged fluids with finite\nconductivity. We find that they do not admit any hyperbolization.\n", "  Proton computed tomography (pCT) is a novel medical imaging modality for\nmapping the distribution of proton relative stopping power (RSP) in medical\nobjects of interest. Compared to conventional X-ray computed tomography, where\nrange uncertainty margins are around 3.5%, pCT has the potential to provide\nmore accurate measurements to within 1%. This improved efficiency will be\nbeneficial to proton-therapy planning and pre-treatment verification. A\nprototype pCT imaging device has recently been developed capable of rapidly\nacquiring low-dose proton radiographs of head-sized objects. We have also\ndeveloped an advanced, fast image reconstruction software based on distributed\ncomputing that utilizes parallel processors and graphical processing units. The\ncombination of fast data acquisition and fast image reconstruction will enable\nthe availability of RSP images within minutes for use in clinical settings. The\nperformance of our image reconstruction software has been evaluated using data\ncollected by the prototype pCT scanner from several phantoms.\n", "  We report an observation of a topologically protected transport of surface\ncarriers in a quasi-ballistic Cd3As2 nanowire.The nanowire is thin enough for\nthe spin-textured surface carriers to form 1D subbands, demonstrating\nconductance oscillations with gate voltage even without magnetic field. The\n{\\pi} phase-shift of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations can periodically appear or\ndisappear by tuning gate voltage continuously. Such a {\\pi} phase shift\nstemming from the Berry's phase demonstrates the topological nature of surface\nstates.The topologically protected transport of the surface states is further\nrevealed by four-terminal nonlocal measurements.\n", "  We propose a new technique for a-posteriori diffusion analysis of numerical\nschemes. The scalar linear advection equation with a broadband signal as\ninitial conditions is numerically solved to simulate a traveling linear wave. A\ndiffusion analysis is performed based on modal energy content and time\nevolution of total energy of the broadband signal. Onset of numerical\ninstability can also be detected at an early stage using this technique. This\ntechnique is used for analyzing modern linear and nonlinear as well as\nspace-time coupled numerical schemes. This analysis is particularly useful for\nanalyzing numerical schemes used in simulation of traveling linear waves such\nas in computational electromagnetics (CEM) and computational\naeroacoustics(CAA).\n", "  For a periodically driven open quantum system, the Floquet theorem states\nthat the time evolution operator $\\Lambda(t,0)$ of the system can be factorized\nas $\\Lambda(t,0)=\\mathcal{D}(t)e^{\\mathcal{L}_{eff}t}$ with micro-motion\noperator $\\mathcal{D}(t)$ possessing the same period as the external driving,\nand time-independent operator $\\mathcal{L}_{eff}$. In this work, we extend this\ntheorem to open systems that follow a modulated periodic evolution, in which\nthe fast part is periodic while the slow part breaks the periodicity. We derive\na factorization for the time evolution operator that separates the long time\ndynamics and the micro-motion for the open quantum system. High-frequency\nexpansions for the effective evolution operator control the long time dynamics,\nand the micro-motion operator is also given and discussed. It may find\napplications in quantum engineering with open systems following modulated\nperiodic evolution.\n", "  For the first time, one-particle theory of Wannier-Stark quantization for a\n$a(N$$-$1)-long chain affected by a homogeneous electric field $E_e$ is\nextended to the 2D case of $L_N$=$a(N$$-$1)-long and $L_{\\cal N}$=$a$$({\\cal\nN}$$-$1)-wide conductor, which is modeled by the atomic square lattice with the\nelectron site-energy change from atom to atom in the direction parallel to\n$\\cal N$ axis by the amount of electric field parameter (efp) $\\varepsilon\n\\equiv aeE_e/|t| $ in units of $|t|$. It is shown that each field-provoked\n$\\mu$-level in the chain spectrum gives birth to the $\\mu$-subband of\nfield-independent levels due to the electron-transfer interaction in the\ndirection perpendicular to $E_e$. The level spacing and hence, the width of\n$\\mu$-subbands $E^0_{\\rm bw}$, is dictated by the conductor length, the hopping\nintegral $t$, and by the lattice constant $a$. Another principal result is that\nthe levels, which are within the energy interval $0.5E^0_{\\rm bw}$ on either\nsides of the spectrum (that is the edge spectrum), correspond to the\ndelocalized states which are extended in the direction perpendicular to the\nelectric field. In this direction, the electron spectrum width $E^{\\perp}_{\\rm\nbw}$ is larger by $E^0_{\\rm bw}$ than the spectrum width in the field direction\n$E^{\\parallel}_{\\rm bw}$. Several special cases of the interrelation between\nthe electron energy versus applied voltage are identified, when the spacing\nbetween the $\\mu$-subband centers is equal either to integer or fraction ($>1$)\nportion of dimensionless $\\varepsilon$. Otherwise, the level spacing is shown\nto be irregular and, depending on $N$, $\\cal N$, and $\\varepsilon$, it can be\nequal to any portion of $\\varepsilon$. It is argued that one of straightforward\napplications of the presented theory is the quantum-mechanical explanation of\nHall effect in two dimensions.\n", "  We review our recent derivation of a Fokker action describing the\nconservative dynamics of a compact binary system at the fourth post-Newtonian\n(4PN) approximation of general relativity. The two bodies are modeled by point\nparticles, which induces ultraviolet (UV) divergences that are cured by means\nof dimensional regularization combined with a renormalization of the particle's\nwordlines. Associated with the propagation of wave tails at infinity is the\nappearance of a non-local-in-time conservative tail effect at the 4PN order in\nthe Lagrangian. In turn this implies the appearance of infrared (IR) divergent\nintegrals which are also regularized by means of dimensional regularization. We\ncompute the Noetherian conserved energy and periastron advance for circular\norbits at 4PN order, paying special attention to the treatment of the non-local\nterms. One ambiguity parameter remaining in the current formalism is determined\nby comparing those quantities, expressed as functions of the orbital frequency,\nwith self-force results valid in the small mass ratio limit.\n", "  Since early 2015 a new radial velocity monitoring campaign is going on at the\nUniversity Observatory Jena. The aim of this project is to obtain current\nradial velocity measurements of selected single-lined spectroscopic binary\nsystems, to redetermine and/or constrain their orbital solutions. In this paper\nwe characterize the properties of the target sample of the project, describe\nthe spectroscopic observations, the data-reduction and analysis and present the\nfirst results of the project, taken with the fiber-linked astronomical\nspectrograph FLECHAS. We present 391 radial velocity measurements of eight\nspectroscopic binaries, which were taken within an epoch difference of 1.6\nyears. These radial velocities were used to determine the spectroscopic orbital\nelements of the observed binary systems, which exhibit orbital periods in the\nrange between nearly one up to several dozens of days. We could constrain the\norbital solutions of seven of these binary systems, and redetermine the orbital\nsolution of phi Dra, whose orbit exhibits >4 times longer orbital period and is\nmore eccentric than given in the 9th Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binary Orbits.\n", "  The aim of this article is to provide an understanding of social networks as\na useful addition to the standard tool-box of techniques used by system\ndesigners. To this end, we give examples of how data about social links have\nbeen collected and used in di erent application contexts. We develop a broad\ntaxonomy-based overview of common properties of social networks, review how\nthey might be used in di erent applications, and point out potential pitfalls\nwhere appropriate. We propose a framework, distinguishing between two main\ntypes of social network-based user selection-personalised user selection which\nidenti es target users who may be relevant for a given source node, using the\nsocial network around the source as a context, and generic user selection or\ngroup delimitation, which lters for a set of users who satisfy a set of\napplication requirements based on their social properties. Using this\nframework, we survey applications of social networks in three typical kinds of\napplication scenarios: recommender systems, content-sharing systems (e.g., P2P\nor video streaming), and systems which defend against users who abuse the\nsystem (e.g., spam or sybil attacks). In each case, we discuss potential\ndirections for future research that involve using social network properties.\n", "  The low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics of slender ribbons is accurately\ncaptured by slender-ribbon theory, an asymptotic solution to the Stokes\nequation which assumes that the three length scales characterising the ribbons\nare well separated. We show in this paper that the force distribution across\nthe width of an isolated ribbon located in a infinite fluid can be determined\nanalytically, irrespective of the ribbon's shape. This, in turn, reduces the\nsurface integrals in the slender-ribbon theory equations to a line integral\nanalogous to the one arising in slender-body theory to determine the dynamics\nof filaments. This result is then used to derive analytical solutions to the\nmotion of a rigid plate ellipsoid and a ribbon torus and to propose a ribbon\nresistive-force theory, thereby extending the resistive-force theory for\nslender filaments.\n", "  The HIE-ISOLDE project represents a major upgrade of the ISOLDE nuclear\nfacility with a mandate to significantly improve the quality and increase the\nintensity and energy of radioactive nuclear beams produced at CERN. The project\nwill expand the experimental nuclear physics programme at ISOLDE by focusing on\nan upgrade of the existing Radioactive ion beam EXperiment (REX) linac with a\n40 MV superconducting linac comprising thirty-two niobium-on-copper\nsputter-coated quarter-wave resonators housed in six cryomodules. The new linac\nwill raise the energy of post-accelerated beams from 3 MeV/u to over 10 MeV/u.\nThe upgrade will be staged to first deliver beam energies of 5.5 MeV/u using\ntwo high-$\\beta$ cryomodules placed downstream of REX, before the energy\nvariable section of the existing linac is replaced with two low-$\\beta$\ncryomodules and two additional high-$\\beta$ cryomodules are installed to attain\nover 10 MeV/u with full energy variability above 0.45 MeV/u. An overview of the\nproject including a status summary of the different R&D activities and the\nschedule will outlined.\n", "  The well-known Lagrangian of current superfluid systems is not relativistic\ncovariant, this paper gives a general relativistic covariant Lagrangian of\nsuperfluid systems, and naturally finds the non-relativistic Lagrangian and its\nall corresponding theories after making approximations. The equation of motion\nobtained from the old non-relativistic Lagrangian density is not complete, it\nlost some important terms. The new deduced equation can be approximated to the\nold equations of motion, the new momentum and energy can return to the old\nexpressions of superfluid systems under some conditions, and the energy and\nmomentum from the general Lagrangian density is accurate, no ignoring some\nterms. This paper reveals that the current classical superfluid Lagrangian\ndensity is only an approximation Lagrangian density under conditions: the\nscalar field is inverse proportional to its complex conjugate field and the\nsquare of time derivative of scalar field logarithm approximates to zero. This\npaper deduces that the divergence of velocity field is zero under classic\nsuperfluid, gives two different expressions of Lagrangian, gets the same\nequation, and finds its solutions. Using two different Lagrangian densities,\nthis paper obtains different forces. Therefore, this paper discovers a general,\nfundamental and real physics symmetry Lagrangian deducing the real physics\nequation of the superfluid, and further discover the symmetry breaking\nprocesses and the special conditions from the general Lagrangian to the special\nLagrangian. This paper gives both superfluid theory of scalar field and\ncomparing investigations with its corresponding theory of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We consider induced emission of ultrarelativistic electrons in strong\nelectric (magnetic) fields that are uniform along the direction of the electron\nmotion and are not uniform in the transverse direction. The stimulated\nabsorption and emission probabilities are found in such system.\n", "  In this paper, we are interested in modeling the diffusion of information in\na multilayer network using thermodynamic diffusion approach. State of each\nagent is viewed as a topic mixture represented by a distribution over multiple\ntopics. We have observed and learned diffusion-related thermodynamical patterns\nin the training data set, and we have used the estimated diffusion structure to\npredict the future states of the agents. A priori knowledge of a fraction of\nthe state of all agents changes the problem to be a Kalman predictor problem\nthat refines the predicted system state using the error in estimation of the\nagents. A real world Twitter data set is then used to evaluate and validate our\ninformation diffusion model.\n", "  The possibility of extracting highly energetic particles from the Super\nProton Synchrotron (SPS) by means of silicon bent crystals has been explored\nsince the 1990's. The channelling effect of a bent crystal can be used to\nstrongly deflect primary protons and eject them from the synchrotron. Many\nstudies and experiments have been carried out to investigate crystal\nchannelling effects. The extraction of 120 and 270 GeV proton beams has already\nbeen demonstrated in the SPS with dedicated experiments located in the ring.\nPresently in the SPS, the UA9 experiment is performing studies to evaluate the\npossibility to use bent silicon crystals to steer particle beams in high energy\naccelerators. Recent studies on the feasibility of extraction from the SPS have\nbeen made using the UA9 infrastructure with a longer-term view of using\ncrystals to help mitigate slow extraction induced activation of the SPS. In\nthis paper, the possibility to eject particles into the extraction channel in\nLSS2 using the bent crystals already installed in the SPS is presented. Details\nof the concept, simulations and measurements carried out with beam are\npresented, before the outlook for the future is discussed.\n", "  We present an analytical framework that allows the quantitative study of\nstatistical dynamic properties of networks with adaptive nodes that have memory\nand is used to examine the emergence of oscillations in networks with response\nfailures. The frequency of the oscillations was quantitatively found to\nincrease with the excitability of the nodes and with the average degree of the\nnetwork and to decrease with delays between nodes. For networks of networks,\ndiverse cluster oscillation modes were found as a function of the topology.\nAnalytical results are in agreement with large-scale simulations and open the\nhorizon for understanding network dynamics composed of finite memory nodes as\nwell as their different phases of activity.\n", "  In this article we generalize the spin statistics theorem and show that a\nstate obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics if and only if the state is invariant under\nthe action of $SL(n,C)$. We also briefly discuss the experimental evidence and\nhow the theorem relates to spin entanglement.\n", "  In this work, a comprehensive research coupling experiment and computation\nhas been performed to understand the phase transition of Na3SbS4 and to\nsynthesize cubic Na3SbS4 (c-Na3SbS4), a high temperature phase of Na3SbS4 that\nis difficult to be preserved from high temperature. The formation of c-Na3SbS4\nis verified by Rietveld refinement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.\nBoth experiment and theoretical calculation reveal that the ionic conductivity\nof c-Na3SbS4 is higher than that of t-Na3SbS4, though the values are in the\nsame order of magnitude. Both structures allow fast ion transport.\n", "  The fundamental lower size limit in wavelength selecting structures is\nexplored with the aid of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The analysis\nshows that for a given wavelength selectivity resonating structures with\noptical feedback have the smallest dimensions. Experimental results obtained\nwith integrated optics microring resonators (Q ~ 3.4 x 10^4) confirm the\nanalysis. In addition, a discussion is given on the validity of the uncertainty\nprinciple in terms of hidden variables or restricted knowledge on the system in\nquestion.\n", "  Conductive ceramics played an important role in industries and manufactures\ndue to their wide applications on electronics devices. Many synthesis\napproaches to prepare ceramics have been developing rapidly in the few decades.\nOne of the simple and easy ways to prepare ceramics was using solgel method and\nvarying calcinated temperatures. In this works we developed conductive\nceramics, microstructure analysis by XRD and SEM, and conductivity measurement.\nOur important finding was an improvement in performance of microstructures,\ncrystallinities and conductivities by increasing calcinated temperatures\n", "  The Dual-Axis Radiography for Hydrodynamic Testing (DARHT) facility at Los\nAlamos was developed for flash radiography of large hydrodynamic\nexperiments.Both axes now routinely produce radiographic source spot sizes\nhaving full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) less than 1 mm. The beam canonical\nangular momentum contributes to spot size, and it is minimized by using a\nshielded source of electrons.An ideal shielded source creates the beam in a\nregion where the axial magnetic field is zero, thus the canonical momentum is\nalso zero, since the beam is born with no mechanical angular momentum.It then\nfollows from Busch's theorem that the canonical angular momentum is minimized\nat the target, at least in principal.\n  In the DARHT accelerators, the axial magnetic field at the cathode is\nminimized by using a solenoid with reverse polarity to cancel out whatever\nsolenoidal beam transport field exists there. This is imperfect in practice,\nbecause of radial variation of the total field across the cathode surface,\nsolenoid misalignments, and long-term variability of solenoid fields for given\ncurrents. This article quantifies the relative importance of canonical momentum\nin determining the focal spot, and establishes a systematic methodology for\ntuning the bucking coils for minimum spot size.\n", "  Using the language of the Geometric Algebra, we recast the massless Dirac\nbispinor as a set of Lorentz scalar, bivector, and pseudoscalar fields that\nobey a generalized form of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. The\nspinor's unusual 4-pi rotation symmetry is seen to be a mathematical artifact\nof the projection of these fields onto an abstract vector space, and not a\nphysical property of the dynamical fields themselves. We also find a deeper\nunderstanding of the spin angular momentum and other Dirac field bilinears in\nterms of these fields and their corresponding analogues in classical\nelectromagnetism.\n", "  We propose a new property of the zeros of exceptional orthogonal polynomials.\nIt has been known that exceptional orthogonal polynomials (XOP) have both real\nand complex zeros. By fixing m variables at the imaginary parts of the complex\nzeros of XOP, we find that in some cases the modulus of the energy function of\na many-particle system attains its maximum at the zeros of XOP. We give a\nsufficient condition for this result with respect to the denominators of the\nweight function of XOP.\n", "  We study numerically a Constantin-Lax-Majda-De Gregorio model generalized by\nOkamoto, Sakajo and Wunsch, which is a model of fluid turbulence in one\ndimension with an inviscid conservation law. In the presence of the viscosity\nand two types of the large-scale forcings, we show that turbulent cascade of\nthe inviscid invariant, which is not limited to quadratic quantity, occurs and\nthat properties of this model's turbulent state are related to singularity of\nthe inviscid case by adopting standard tools of analyzing fluid turbulence.\n", "  While rich clusters are powerful sources of X-rays, gamma-ray emission from\nthese large cosmic structures has not been detected yet. X-ray radiative energy\nlosses in the central regions of relaxed galaxy clusters are so strong that one\nneeds to consider special sources of energy, likely AGN feedback, to suppress\ncatastrophic cooling of the gas. We consider a model of AGN feedback that\npostulates that the AGN supplies the energy to the gas by inflating bubbles of\nrelativistic plasma, whose energy content is dominated by cosmic-ray (CR)\nhadrons. If most of these hadrons can quickly escape the bubbles, then\ncollisions of CRs with thermal protons in the intracluster medium (ICM) should\nlead to strong gamma-ray emission, unless fast diffusion of CRs removes them\nfrom the cluster. Therefore, the lack of detections with modern gamma-ray\ntelescopes sets limits on the confinement time of CR hadrons in bubbles and CR\ndiffusive propagation in the ICM.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate how to achieve high-fidelity electron spin\ntransport in a GaAs double quantum dot. Our study examines spin transport from\nmultiple perspectives. We first study how a double dot potential may\naffect/accelerate spin relaxation. We calculate spin relaxation rate in a wide\nrange of experimental parameters and focus on the occurrence of spin hot spots.\nA safe parameter regime is identified in order to avoid these spin hot spots.\nWe also study the non-adiabatic transitions in the Landau-Zener process of\nsweeping the interdot detuning, and propose a scheme to take advantage of\npossible Landau-Zener-St\\\"{u}kelburg interference to achieve high-fidelity spin\ntransport at a higher speed. Finally, we calculate the double-dot correction on\nthe effective $g$-factor for the tunneling electron, and estimate the resulting\nphase error between different spin states. Our results should provide a useful\nguidance for future experiments on coherent electron spin transport.\n", "  In super- or subradiance, a quantum superposition of excited atoms\ncollectively emits a photon much more or much less rapidly than an isolated\natom. Superradiant and subradiant lifetimes have been derived for finite\nspheres of uniform media, either by simulating random samples or by expanding\nin spherical harmonics and analyzing Bessel functions. We introduce a simple\nregulator that applies to unbounded media, enabling trivial derivation and\nanalysis of lifetimes via elementary Fourier techniques. The regulator can be\ninterpreted as a correlation length for atomic positions; the regularized\nsystem describes localized regions of enhanced radiative activity in otherwise\nquiescent surroundings.\n", "  In many complex networked systems, such as online social networks, activity\noriginates at certain nodes and subsequently spreads on the network through\ninfluence. In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the spread of\ninfluence and the identification of influential entities in a complex network\nwhen nodal activation can happen via two different mechanisms. The first\nmechanism of activation stems from factors that are intrinsic to the node. The\nsecond mechanism comes from the influence of connected neighbors. After\nintroducing the model, we provide an algorithm to mine for the influential\nnodes in such a scenario by modifying the well-known influence maximization\nalgorithm to work with our model that incorporates both forms of activation.\nOur model can be considered as a variation of the independent cascade diffusion\nmodel. We provide small motivating examples to facilitate an intuitive\nunderstanding of the effect of including the intrinsic activation mechanism. We\nsketch a proof of the submodularity of the influence function under the new\nformulation and demonstrate the same on larger graphs. Based on the model, we\nexplain how influential content creators can drive engagement on social media\nplatforms. Using additional experiments on a Twitter dataset, we then show how\nthe formulation can be applied to real-world social media datasets. Finally, we\nderive a centrality metric that takes into account, both the mechanisms of\nactivation and provides for an accurate, computationally efficient, alternate\napproach to the problem of identifying influencers under intrinsic activation.\n", "  The Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, a pioneer in\nintegral field spectroscopy legacy projects, has fostered many studies\nexploring the information encoded on the spatially resolved data on gaseous and\nstellar features in the optical range of galaxies. We describe a value-added\ncatalogue of stellar population properties for CALIFA galaxies analysed with\nthe spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT and processed with the PyCASSO platform.\nOur public data base (http://pycasso.ufsc.br/, mirror at\nhttp://pycasso.iaa.es/) comprises 445 galaxies from the CALIFA Data Release 3\nwith COMBO data. The catalogue provides maps for the stellar mass surface\ndensity, mean stellar ages and metallicities, stellar dust attenuation, star\nformation rates, and kinematics. Example applications both for individual\ngalaxies and for statistical studies are presented to illustrate the power of\nthis data set. We revisit and update a few of our own results on mass density\nradial profiles and on the local mass-metallicity relation. We also show how to\nemploy the catalogue for new investigations, and show a pseudo\nSchmidt-Kennicutt relation entirely made with information extracted from the\nstellar continuum. Combinations to other databases are also illustrated. Among\nother results, we find a very good agreement between star formation rate\nsurface densities derived from the stellar continuum and the $\\mathrm{H}\\alpha$\nemission. This public catalogue joins the scientific community's effort towards\ntransparency and reproducibility, and will be useful for researchers focusing\non (or complementing their studies with) stellar properties of CALIFA galaxies.\n", "  The introduction of magnetic charge into Maxwell's equations has led to an\nextensive search for magnetically charged particles (magnetic monopoles). A\nparticle model developed by one of us (DF) adds an additional feature to\nMaxwell's symmetric equations in that the stable magnetic monopole should have\nthe same charge strength as the electron. We have not found any experiments in\nhigh-energy physics that have explicitly ruled out this possibility. However,\nthe few experiments at colliders that had no magnetic field might have observed\na signal for these 1e strength magnetic monopoles as an unexpected enhancement\nin the mu+mu- production rate. The absence of any such observation leads us to\nset a tentative lower mass limit for these unit charge magnetic monopoles at\n4.5-5 GeV/c2. Using a MC generator for magnetic charge and tracking these\nevents through a simplified model of the BELLE II detector, we have found that\nthe central drift chamber of BELLE II has a remarkably high efficiency for\ntriggering on magnetically charged tracks. We suggest that the BELLE II\ncollaboration perform a specific search for stable magnetically charged\nparticles having a field strength of 1e when they run for the first time with\ncolliding beams in 2018. This would be the first time anyone has specifically\nlooked for such a particle.\n", "  We show how to relate Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE) to highest-weight\nrepresentations of infinite dimensional Lie Algebras using the conformal\nrestriction properties studied by Lawler, Schramm and Werner in the paper\narXiv:math.PR/0209343. This confirms the prediction from theoretical physics\nand conformal field theory that two-dimensional critical systems are related to\nsuch degenerate representations.\n", "  We show that the two-component system of hyperbolic conservation laws\n$\\partial_t \\rho + \\partial_x (\\rho u) =0 = \\partial_t u + \\partial_x \\rho$\nappears naturally in the formally computed hydrodynamic limit of some randomly\ngrowing interface models, and we study some properties of this system. We show\nthat the two-component system of hyperbolic conservation laws $\\partial_t \\rho\n+ \\partial_x (\\rho u) =0 = \\partial_t u + \\partial_x \\rho$ appears naturally in\nthe formally computed hydrodynamic limit of some randomly growing interface\nmodels, and we study some properties of this system.\n", "  We show how to combine Kesten's scaling relations, the determination of\ncritical exponents associated to the stochastic Loewner evolution process by\nLawler, Schramm, and Werner, and Smirnov's proof of Cardy's formula, in order\nto determine the existence and value of critical exponents associated to\npercolation on the triangular lattice.\n", "  We relate the formulas giving Brownian (and other) intersection exponents to\nthe absolute continuity relations between Bessel process of different\ndimensions, via the two-parameter family of Schramm-Loewner Evolution processes\nSLE(kappa,rho) introduced in arXiv:math.PR/0209343. This allows also to compute\nthe value of some new exponents (``hiding exponents'') related to SLEs and\nplanar Brownian motions.\n", "  This paper is based on mini-courses given in July 2003. Its goal is to give a\nself-contained sketchy and heuristic survey of the recent results concerning\nconformal restriction, that were initiated in our joint work with Greg Lawler\nand Oded Schramm, and further investigated in the last year in joint work with\nRoland Friedrich, Greg Lawler, and by Julien Dubedat. These notes can be viewed\nas complementary to my Saint-Flour notes.\n", "  In this research announcement, we show that SLE curves can in fact be viewed\nas boundaries of certain simple Poissonian percolation clusters: Recall that\nthe Brownian loop-soup (introduced in the paper arxiv:math.PR/0304419 with Greg\nLawler) with intensity c defines a Poissonian collection of (simple if one\nfocuses only on the outer boundary) loops in a domain. This random family of\n(possibly intersecting) loops is conformally invariant (and there are almost\nsurely infinitely many small loops in any sample). We show that there exists a\ncritical value a in (0,1] such that if one colors all the interiors of the\nloops, the obtained clusters are bounded when c<a, whereas when c>a, one single\ncluster fills the domain. We prove that for small c, the outer boundaries of\nthe clusters are SLE-type curves where $\\kappa \\le 4$ and $c$ related by the\nusual relation $c=(3\\kappa-8)(6-\\kappa)/2\\kappa$ (i.e. c corresponds to the\ncentral charge of the model). Conjecturally, the critical value a is equal to\none and corresponds to SLE4 loops, so that this should give for any c in (0,1]\na construction of a natural countable family of random disjoint SLE$_\\kappa$\nloops (i.e. $\\kappa$ should span $(8/3,4]$), that behaves ``nicely'' under\nperturbation of the domain.\n  A precise relation between chordal SLE and the loop-soup goes as follows:\nConsider the sample of a certain restriction measure (i.e. a certain union of\nBrownian excursions) in a domain, attach to it all the above-described clusters\nthat it intersects. The outer boundary of the obtained set is exactly an\nSLE$_\\kappa$, if the restriction measure exponent is equal to the\nhighest-weight of the corresponding representation with central charge c.\n", "  We show that there exists a unique (up to multiplication by constants) and\nnatural measure on simple loops in the plane and on each Riemann surface, such\nthat the measure is conformally invariant and also invariant under restriction\n(i.e. the measure on a Riemann surface S' that is contained in another Riemann\nsurface S, is just the measure on S restricted to those loops that stay in S').\nWe study some of its properties and consequences concerning outer boundaries of\ncritical percolation clusters and Brownian loops.\n"]}
