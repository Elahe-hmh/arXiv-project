We show that, when the competition parameter goes to\ninfinity, the profile of each component separates, in many pulses, from the\nothers. Moreover, we can prescribe the location of such pulses in terms of the\noscillations of the changing-sign solutions of the scalar nonlinear\nSchroedinger equation. Within an Hartree-Fock approximation, this provides a\ntheoretical indication of phase separation into many nodal domains for the\nk-mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  In this paper we establish the ergodicity of Langevin dynamics for simple\ntwo-particle system involving a Lennard-Jones type potential. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first such result for a system operating under this\ntype of potential. Moreover we show that the dynamics are {\\it geometrically}\nergodic (have a spectral gap) and converge at a geometric rate. Methods from\nstochastic averaging are used to establish the existence of a Lyapunov\nfunction. The existence of a Lyapunov function in this setting seems resistant\nto more traditional approaches. This is a corrected version of the article.\n", "  The first nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of electron internal transport\nbarriers (e-ITBs) in the National Spherical Torus Experiment show that reversed\nmagnetic shear can suppress thermal transport by increasing the nonlinear\ncritical gradient for electron-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence to three\ntimes its linear critical value. An interesting feature of this turbulence is\nnonlinearly driven off-midplane radial streamers. This work reinforces the\nexperimental observation that magnetic shear is likely an effective way of\ntriggering and sustaining e-ITBs in magnetic fusion devices.\n", "  We report superconductivity in quasi-1D nanostructures created at the\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Nanostructures having line widths w~10 nm are formed\nfrom the parent two-dimensional electron liquid using conductive atomic force\nmicroscope lithography. Nanowire cross-sections are small compared to the\nsuperconducting coherence length in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (w<<xi~100 nm), placing them\nin the quasi-1D regime. Broad superconducting transitions with temperature and\nfinite resistances in the superconducting state well below Tc~200 mK are\nobserved. V-I curves show switching between the superconducting and normal\nstates that are characteristic of superconducting nanowires. The four-terminal\nresistance in the superconducting state shows an unusual dependence on the\ncurrent path, varying by as much as an order of magnitude.\n", "  We study (2+1)-dimensional single step model (SSM) for crystal growth\nincluding both deposition and evaporation processes parametrized by a single\ncontrol parameter $p$. Using extensive numerical simulations with a relatively\nhigh statistics, we estimate various interface exponents such as roughness,\ngrowth and dynamic exponents as well as various geometric and distribution\nexponents of height clusters and their boundaries (or iso-height lines) as\nfunction of $p$. We find that, in contrary to the general belief, there exists\na critical value $p_c\\approx 0.25$ at which the model undergoes a roughening\ntransition from a rough phase with $p<p_c$ in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nuniversality to a smooth phase with $p>p_c$, asymptotically in the\nEdwards-Wilkinson (EW) class. We validate our conclusion by estimating the\neffective roughness exponents and their extrapolation to the infinite-size\nlimit.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions have the potential to provide solutions for low-power,\nhigh-density data storage and processing. One of the major challenges in\ndeveloping skyrmion-based devices is the skyrmions' magnetic stability in\nconfined helimagnetic nanostructures. Through a systematic study of equilibrium\nstates, using a full three-dimensional micromagnetic model including\ndemagnetisation effects, we demonstrate that skyrmionic textures are the lowest\nenergy states in helimagnetic thin film nanostructures at zero external\nmagnetic field and in absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We also report\nthe regions of metastability for non-ground state equilibrium configurations.\nWe show that bistable skyrmionic textures undergo hysteretic behaviour between\ntwo energetically equivalent skyrmionic states with different core orientation,\neven in absence of both magnetocrystalline and demagnetisation-based shape\nanisotropies, suggesting the existence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-based shape\nanisotropy. Finally, we show that the skyrmionic texture core reversal dynamics\nis facilitated by the Bloch point occurrence and propagation.\n", "  Adopting a resource theory framework of thermodynamics for quantum and nano\nsystems pioneered by Janzing et al. [Int. J. Th. Phys. 39, 2717 (2000)], we\nformulate the cost in useful work of transforming one resource state into\nanother as a linear program of convex optimization. This approach is based on\nthe characterization of thermal quasiorder given by Janzing et al. and later by\nHorodecki and Oppenheim [Nat. Comm. 4, 2059 (2013)]. Both characterizations are\nrelated to an extended version of majorization studied by Ruch, Schranner, and\nSeligman under the name mixing distance [J. Chem. Phys. 69, 386 (1978)].\n", "  We analyze the use of a relativistic laser pulse with a controlled frequency\nchirp incident on a rising plasma density gradient to drive an acceleration\nstructure for proton and light-ion acceleration. The Chirp Induced Transparency\nAcceleration (ChITA) scheme is described with an analytical model of the\nvelocity of the snowplow at critical density on a pre-formed rising plasma\ndensity gradient that is driven by a positive-chirp in the frequency of a\nrelativistic laser pulse. The velocity of the ChITA-snowplow is shown to depend\nupon rate of rise of the frequency of the relativistic laser pulse represented\nby $\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{\\theta}$ where, $\\epsilon_0 =\n\\frac{\\Delta\\omega_0}{\\omega_0}$ and chirping spatial scale-length, $\\theta$,\nthe normalized magnetic vector potential of the laser pulse $a_0$ and the\nplasma density gradient scale-length, $\\alpha$. We observe using 1-D OSIRIS\nsimulations the formation and forward propagation of ChITA-snowplow, being\ncontinuously pushed by the chirping laser at a velocity in accordance with the\nanalytical results. The trace protons reflect off of this propagating snowplow\nstructure and accelerate mono-energetically. The control over ChITA-snowplow\nvelocity allows the tuning of accelerated proton energies.\n", "  Phenomena that involve two or more on-shell particles are particularly\nsensitive to the effects of finite volume and require special treatment when\ncomputed using lattice QCD. In this paper we generalize the results of\nL\\\"uscher, and Lellouch and L\\\"uscher, which determine the leading order\neffects of finite volume on the two-particle spectrum and two-particle decay\namplitudes to determine the finite-volume effects in the second order mixing of\nthe $K^0$ and $\\overline{K^0}$ states. We extend the methods of Kim, Sachrajda\nand Sharpe to provide a direct, uniform treatment of these three, related,\nfinite-volume corrections. In particular, the leading, finite-volume\ncorrections to the $K_L$-$K_S$ mass difference $\\Delta M_K$ and the CP\nviolating parameter $\\epsilon_K$ are determined, including the potentially\nlarge effects which can arise from the near degeneracy of the kaon mass and the\nenergy of a finite-volume, two-pion state.\n", "  If a dissipative anisotropic dielectric material, characterized by the\npermittivity matrix $\\underline{\\underline{\\epsilon}}$, supports Voigt-wave\npropagation, then so too does the analogous active material characterized by\nthe permittivity matrix $\\underline{\\underline{{\\tilde{\\epsilon}}}}$, where\n$\\underline{\\underline{{\\tilde{\\epsilon}}}}$ is the hermitian conjugate of\n$\\underline{\\underline{\\epsilon}}$. Consequently, a dissipative material that\nsupports Voigt-wave propagation can give rise to a material that supports the\npropagation of Voigt waves with attendant linear gain in amplitude with\npropagation distance, by infiltration with an active dye.\n", "  We review a possible non-minimal coupling (dilatonic) of a scalar field\n(axion like particle) to electromagnetism, through experimental and\nobservational constraints. Such a coupling is motivated from recent quasar\nspectrum observations that indicate a possible spatial and/or temporal\nvariation of the fine-structure constant. We consider a dilatonic coupling of\nthe form $B_F (\\phi) = 1 + g\\phi$. The strongest bound on the coupling\nparameter $g$ is derived from weak equivalence principle tests, which impose $g\n< 1.6 \\times 10^{-17}GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is strong enough to rule out\nthis class of models as a cause for an observable cosmological variation of the\nfine structure constant unless a chameleon mechanism is implemented. Also, we\nargue that a similar coupling occurs in chameleon cosmology, another candidate\ndark mater particle and we estimate the cosmological consequences by both\neffects. It should be clarified that this class of models is not necessarily\nruled out in the presence of a chameleon mechanism which can freeze the\ndynamics of the scalar field in high density laboratory regions.\n", "  We study the properties of the ground states of the one- and two-dimensional\nHubbard models at half filling and moderate doping using entanglement-based\nmeasures, which we calculate numerically using the momentum-space density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG). In particular, we investigate quantities\nsuch as the single-site entropy and two-site mutual information of\nsingle-particle momentum states as well as the behavior of the bipartite\nsubsystem entropy for partitions in momentum space. The distribution of these\nquantities in momentum space gives insight into the fundamental nature of the\nground state, insight that can be used to make contact with weak-coupling-based\nanalytic approaches and to optimize numerical methods, the momentum-space DMRG\nin particular. We study the site and subsystem entropies as a function of\ninteraction strength $U$ and system size. In both the one- and two-dimensional\ncases, we find that the subsystem entropy scales proportionally to $U^2$ for\nweak $U$ and proportionally to volume. Nevertheless, the optimized\nmomentum-space DMRG can provide variationally accurate results for the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling for moderate system sizes.\n", "  Infectious diseases often spread faster near their peak than would be\npredicted given early data on transmission. Despite the commonality of this\nphenomena, there are no known general mechanisms able to cause an exponentially\nspreading dis- ease to begin spreading faster. Indeed most features of real\nworld social networks, e.g. clustering1,2 and community structure3, and of\nhuman behaviour, e.g. social distancing4 and increased hygiene5, will slow\ndisease spread. Here, we consider a model where individuals with essential\nsocietal roles-e.g. teachers, first responders, health-care workers, etc.- who\nfall ill are replaced with healthy individuals. We refer to this process as\nrelational exchange. Relational exchange is also a behavioural process, but one\nwhose effect on disease transmission is less obvious. By incorporating this\nbehaviour into a dynamic network model, we demonstrate that replacing\nindividuals can accelerate disease transmission. Furthermore, we find that the\neffects of this process are trivial when considering a standard mass-action\nmodel, but dramatic when considering network structure. This result highlights\nanother critical shortcoming in mass-action models, namely their inability to\naccount for behavioural processes. Lastly, using empirical data, we find that\nthis mechanism parsimoniously explains observed patterns across more than\nseventeen years of influenza and dengue virus data. We anticipate that our\nfindings will advance the emerging field of disease forecasting and will better\ninform public health decision making during outbreaks.\n", "  Particles traveling at high velocities through microfluidic channels migrate\nfrom their starting streamlines due to inertial lift forces. Theories predict\ndifferent scaling laws for these forces and there is little experimental\nevidence by which to validate theory. Here we experimentally measure the three\ndimensional positions and migration velocities of particles. Our experimental\nmethod relies on a combination of sub-pixel accurate particle tracking and\nvelocimetric reconstruction of the depth dimension to track thousands of\nindividual particles in three dimensions. We show that there is no simple\nscaling of inertial forces upon particle size, but that migration velocities\nagree well with numerical simulations and with a two-term asymptotic theory\nthat contains no unmeasured parameters.\n", "  Multiple surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves excited at the interface of a\nhomogeneous isotropic metal and a chiral sculptured thin film (STF) impregnated\nwith silver nanoparticles were theoretically assessed for the\nmultiple-SPP-waves-based sensing of a fluid uniformly infiltrating the chiral\nSTF. The Bruggemann homogenization formalism was used in two different\nmodalities to determine the three principal relative permittivity scalars of\nthe silver-nanoparticle-impregnated chiral STF infiltrated uniformly by the\nfluid. The dynamic sensitivity increased when silver nanoparticles were\npresent, provided their volume fraction did not exceed about 1%.\n", "  An $arctan$-electrodynamics coupled with the gravitational field is\ninvestigated. We obtain the regular black hole solution that at $r\\rightarrow\n\\infty$ gives corrections to the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution. The corrections\nto Coulomb's law at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$ are found. We evaluate the mass of the\nblack hole that is a function of the dimensional parameter $\\beta$ introduced\nin the model. The magnetically charged black hole was investigated and we have\nobtained the magnetic mass of the black hole and the metric function at\n$r\\rightarrow \\infty$. The regular black hole solution is obtained at\n$r\\rightarrow 0$ with the de Sitter core. We show that there is no singularity\nof the Ricci scalar for electrically and magnetically charged black holes.\nRestrictions on the electric and magnetic fields are found that follow from the\nrequirement of the absence of superluminal sound speed and the requirement of a\nclassical stability.\n", "  The bi-Yang-Baxter sigma-model is a certain two-parameter deformation of the\nprincipal chiral model on a real Lie group G for which the left and right\nG-symmetries of the latter are both replaced by Poisson-Lie symmetries. It was\nintroduced by C. Klimcik who also recently showed it admits a Lax pair, thereby\nproving it is integrable at the Lagrangian level. By working in the Hamiltonian\nformalism and starting from an equivalent description of the model as a\ntwo-parameter deformation of the coset sigma-model on G x G / G_diag, we show\nthat it also admits a Lax matrix whose Poisson bracket is of the standard\nr/s-form characterised by a twist function which we determine. A number of\nresults immediately follow from this, including the identification of certain\ncomplex Poisson commuting Kac-Moody currents as well as an explicit description\nof the q-deformed symmetries of the model. Moreover, the model is also shown to\nfit naturally in the general scheme recently developed for constructing\nintegrable deformations of sigma-models. Finally, we show that although the\nPoisson bracket of the Lax matrix still takes the r/s-form after fixing the\nG_diag gauge symmetry, it is no longer characterised by a twist function.\n", "  Two active dielectric materials may be blended together to realize a\nhomogenized composite material (HCM) which exhibits more gain than either\ncomponent material. Likewise, two dissipative dielectric materials may be\nblended together to realize an HCM which exhibits more loss than either\ncomponent material. Sufficient conditions for such gain/loss enhancement were\nestablished using the Bruggeman homogenization formalism. Gain/loss enhancement\narises when (i) the imaginary parts of the relative permittivities of both\ncomponent materials are similar in magnitude and (ii) the real parts of the\nrelative permittivities of both component materials are dissimilar in\nmagnitude.\n", "  The electromagnetic field phasors in an isotropic chiral material (ICM) are\nsuperpositions of two Beltrami fields of different handedness. Application of\nthe Bruggeman homogenization formalism to two-component composite materials\ndelivers ICMs wherein Beltrami fields of one handedness attenuate whereas\nBeltrami waves of the other handedness amplify. One component material is a\ndissipative ICM, the other an active dielectric material.\n", "  The Mellin transform of quartic products of shifted Airy functions is\nevaluated in a closed form. Some particular cases expressed in terms of the\nlogarithm function and complete elliptic integrals special values are\npresented.\n", "  A topological insulator is classically modeled as an isotropic\ndielectric-magnetic with a magnetoelectric pseudoscalar $\\Psi$ existing in its\nbulk while its surface is charge-free and current-free. An alternative model is\nobtained by setting $\\Psi\\equiv0$ and incorporating surface charge and current\ndensities characterized by an admittance $\\gamma$. Analysis of plane-wave\nreflection and refraction due to a topological-insulator half space reveals\nthat the parameters $\\Psi$ and $\\gamma$ arise identically in the reflection and\ntransmission coefficients, implying that the two classical models cannot be\ndistinguished on the basis of any scattering scenario. However, as $\\Psi$\ndisappears from the Maxwell equations applicable to any region occupied by the\ntopological insulator, and because surface states exist on topological\ninsulators as protected conducting states, the alternative model must be\nchosen.\n", "  We report an experimental investigation of the facilitated excitation\ndynamics in off-resonantly driven Rydberg gases by separating the initial\noff-resonant excitation phase from the facilitation phase, in which successive\nfacilitation events lead to excitation avalanches. We achieve this by creating\na controlled number of initial seed excitations. Greater insight into the\navalanche mechanism is obtained from an analysis of the full counting\ndistributions. We also present simple mathematical models and numerical\nsimulations of the excitation avalanches that agree well with our experimental\nresults.\n", "  In this work we discuss possible physical origins for non-trivial exponents\nin the athermal rheology of soft materials at low but finite driving rates. A\nkey ingredient in our scenario is the presence of a self-consistent mechanical\nnoise that stems from the spatial superposition of long-range elastic responses\nto localized plastically deforming regions. We study analytically a mean-field\nmodel, in which this mechanical noise is accounted for by a stress diffusion\nterm coupled to the plastic activity. Within this description we show how a\ndependence of the shear modulus and/or the local relaxation time on the shear\nrate introduces corrections to the usual mean-field prediction, concerning the\nHerschel-Bulkley-type rheological response of exponent 1/2. This feature of the\nmean-field picture is then shown to be robust with respect to structural\ndisorder and partial relaxation of the local stress. We test this prediction\nnumerically on a mesoscopic lattice model that implements explicitly the\nlong-range elastic response to localized shear transformations, and we conclude\non how our scenario might be tested in rheological experiments.\n", "  Perovksite semiconductors have shown promise for low-cost solar cells, lasers\nand photodetectors, yet their fundamental photophysical properties are not well\nunderstood. Recent observations of a low ($\\sim$few meV) exciton binding energy\nand evidence of hot phonon effects in the room temperature phase suggest that\nperovskites are much closer to inorganic semiconductors than the absorber\nlayers in traditional organic photovoltaics, signaling the need for experiments\nthat shed light on the placement of perovskite materials within the spectrum of\nsemiconductors used in optoelectronics and photovoltaics. Here we use four-wave\nmixing (FWM) to contrast the coherent optical response of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$\nthin films and crystalline GaAs. At carrier densities relevant for solar cell\noperation, our results show that carriers interact surprisingly weakly via the\nCoulomb interaction in perovskite, much weaker than in inorganic\nsemiconductors. These weak many-body effects lead to a dephasing time in\nCH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ $\\sim$3 times longer than in GaAs. Our results also show\nthat the strong enhancement of the exciton FWM signal tied to\nexcitation-induced dephasing in GaAs and other III-V semiconductors does not\noccur in perovskite due to weak exciton-carrier scattering interactions.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze a scheme for the time-dependent variable density\nNavier-Stokes equations. The algorithm is implicit in time, and the space\napproximation is based on a low-order staggered non-conforming finite element,\nthe so-called Rannacher-Turek element. The convection term in the momentum\nbalance equation is discretized by a finite volume technique, in such a way\nthat a solution obeys a discrete kinetic energy balance, and the mass balance\nis approximated by an upwind finite volume method. We first show that the\nscheme preserves the stability properties of the continuous problem (L\n$\\infty$-estimate for the density, L $\\infty$ (L 2)-and L 2 (H 1)-estimates for\nthe velocity), which yields, by a topological degree technique, the existence\nof a solution. Then, invoking compactness arguments and passing to the limit in\nthe scheme, we prove that any sequence of solutions (obtained with a sequence\nof discretizations the space and time step of which tend to zero) converges up\nto the extraction of a subsequence to a weak solution of the continuous\nproblem.\n", "  In confined helimagnetic nanostructures, skyrmionic states in the form of\nincomplete and isolated skyrmion states can emerge as the ground state in\nabsence of both external magnetic field and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In\nthis work, we study the dynamic properties (resonance frequencies and\ncorresponding eigenmodes) of skyrmionic states in thin film FeGe disk samples.\nWe employ two different methods in finite-element based micromagnetic\nsimulation: eigenvalue and ringdown method. The eigenvalue method allows us to\nidentify all resonance frequencies and corresponding eigenmodes that can exist\nin the simulated system. However, using a particular experimentally feasible\nexcitation can excite only a limited set of eigenmodes. Because of that, we\nperform ringdown simulations that resemble the experimental setup using both\nin-plane and out-of-plane excitations. In addition, we report the nonlinear\ndependence of resonance frequencies on the external magnetic bias field and\ndisk sample diameter and discuss the possible reversal mode of skyrmionic\nstates. We compare the power spectral densities of incomplete skyrmion and\nisolated skyrmion states and observe several key differences that can\ncontribute to the experimental identification of the state present in the\nsample. We measure the FeGe Gilbert damping, and using its value we determine\nwhat eigenmodes can be expected to be observed in experiments. Finally, we show\nthat neglecting the demagnetisation energy contribution or ignoring the\nmagnetisation variation in the out-of-film direction - although not changing\nthe eigenmode's magnetisation dynamics significantly - changes their resonance\nfrequencies substantially. Apart from contributing to the understanding of\nskyrmionic states physics, this systematic work can be used as a guide for the\nexperimental identification of skyrmionic states in confined helimagnetic\nnanostructures.\n", "  The uncertainty principle can be understood as constraining the probability\nof winning a game in which Alice measures one of two conjugate observables,\nsuch as position or momentum, on a system provided by Bob, and he is to guess\nthe outcome. Two variants are possible: either Alice tells Bob which observable\nshe measured, or he has to furnish guesses for both cases. Here I derive new\nuncertainty relations for both, formulated directly in terms of Bob's guessing\nprobabilities. For the former these relate to the entanglement that can be\nrecovered by action on Bob's system alone. This gives a condition for\napproximate quantum error correction in terms of the recoverability of\n\"amplitude\" and \"phase\" information, implicitly used in the recent construction\nof efficient quantum polar codes. I also find a tight relation on the guessing\nprobabilities for the latter game, which has application to wave-particle\nduality relations.\n", "  Cd3As2 is a model material of Dirac semimetal with a linear dispersion\nrelation along all three directions in the momentum space. The unique band\nstructure of Cd3As2 makes it with both Dirac and topological properties. It can\nbe driven into a Weyl semimetal by the symmetry breaking or a topological\ninsulator by enhancing the spin-orbit coupling. Here we report the temperature\nand gate voltage dependent magnetotransport properties of Cd3As2 nanoplates\nwith Fermi level near the Dirac point. The Hall anomaly demonstrates the\ntwo-carrier transport accompanied by a transition from n-type to p-type\nconduction with decreasing temperature. The carrier-type transition is\nexplained by considering the temperature dependent spin-orbit coupling. The\nmagnetoresistance exhibits a large non-saturating value up to 2000% at high\ntemperatures, which is ascribed to the electron-hole compensation in the\nsystem. Our results are valuable for understanding the experimental\nobservations related to the two-carrier transport in Dirac/Weyl semimetals,\nsuch as Na3Bi, ZrTe5, TaAs, NbAs, and HfTe5.\n", "  The relationship between thermal light and coherent pulses is of fundamental\nand practical interest. We now know that thermal light cannot be represented as\na statistical mixture of single pulses. In this paper we ask whether or not\nthermal light can be represented as a statistical mixture of sets of pulses. We\nconsider thermal light in a one-dimensional wave-guide, and find a convex\ndecomposition into products of orthonormal coherent states of localized,\nnonmonochromatic modes.\n", "  The probability that all eigenvalues of a product of $m$ independent $N\n\\times N$ sub-blocks of a Haar distributed random real orthogonal matrix of\nsize $(L_i+N) \\times (L_i+N)$, $(i=1,\\dots,m)$ are real is calculated as a\nmulti-dimensional integral, and as a determinant. Both involve Meijer\nG-functions. Evaluation formulae of the latter, based on a recursive scheme,\nallow it to be proved that for any $m$ and with each $L_i$ even the probability\nis a rational number. The formulae furthermore provide for explicit computation\nin small order cases.\n", "  For a variety of superconducting qubits, tunable interactions are achieved\nthrough mutual inductive coupling to a coupler circuit containing a nonlinear\nJosephson element. In this paper we derive the general interaction mediated by\nsuch a circuit under the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation. This interaction\nnaturally decomposes into a classical part, with origin in the classical\ncircuit equations, and a quantum part, associated with the coupler's zero-point\nenergy. Our result is non-perturbative in the qubit-coupler coupling strengths\nand in the coupler nonlinearity. This can lead to significant departures from\nprevious, linear theories for the inter-qubit coupling, including\nnon-stoquastic and many-body interactions. Our analysis provides explicit and\nefficiently computable series for any term in the interaction Hamiltonian and\ncan be applied to any superconducting qubit type. We conclude with a numerical\ninvestigation of our theory using a case study of two coupled flux qubits, and\nin particular study the regime of validity of the Born-Oppenheimer\nApproximation.\n", "  We study sets of oscillators that have high quantum occupancy and that\ninteract by exchanging quanta. It is shown by analytical arguments and\nnumerical simulation that such systems obey classical equations of motion only\non time scales of order their relaxation time $\\tau$ and not longer than that.\nThe results are relevant to the cosmology of axions and axion-like particles.\n", "  The standard model has for massless quarks and leptons \"miraculously\" no\ntriangle anomalies due to the fact that the sum of all possible traces $Tr\n[\\tau^{Ai}$$ \\tau^{Bj}$$ \\tau^{Ck}]$ --- where $\\tau^{Ai}, \\tau^{Bi}$ and\n$\\tau^{Ck}$ are the generators of one, of two or of three of the groups $SU(3),\nSU(2)$ and $U(1)$ --- over the representations of one family of the left handed\nfermions and anti-fermions (and separately of the right handed fermions and\nanti-fermions), contributing to the triangle currents, is equal to zero. It is\ndemonstrated in this paper that this cancellation of the standard model\ntriangle anomaly follows straightforwardly if the $SO(3,1), SU(2), U(1)$ and $\nSU(3)$ are the subgroups of the orthogonal group $SO(13,1)$, as it is in the\nspin-charge-family theory. We comment on the $SO(10)$ anomaly cancellation,\nwhich works if handedness and charges are related \"by hand\".\n", "  The electrical resistivity $\\rho$ and Hall coefficient R$_H$ of the\ntetragonal single-layer cuprate Nd-LSCO were measured in magnetic fields up to\n$H = 37.5$ T, large enough to access the normal state at $T \\to 0$, for closely\nspaced dopings $p$ across the pseudogap critical point at $p^\\star = 0.235$.\nBelow $p^\\star$, both coefficients exhibit an upturn at low temperature, which\ngets more pronounced with decreasing $p$. Taken together, these upturns show\nthat the normal-state carrier density $n$ at $T = 0$ drops upon entering the\npseudogap phase. Quantitatively, it goes from $n = 1 + p$ at $p = 0.24$ to $n =\np$ at $p = 0.20$. By contrast, the mobility does not change appreciably, as\nrevealed by the magneto-resistance. The transition has a width in doping and\nsome internal structure, whereby R$_H$ responds more slowly than $\\rho$ to the\nopening of the pseudogap. We attribute this difference to a Fermi surface that\nsupports both hole-like and electron-like carriers in the interval $0.2 < p <\np^\\star$, with compensating contributions to R$_H$. Our data are in excellent\nagreement with recent high-field data on YBCO and LSCO. The quantitative\nconsistency across three different cuprates shows that a drop in carrier\ndensity from $1 + p$ to $p$ is a universal signature of the pseudogap\ntransition at $T=0$. We discuss the implication of these findings for the\nnature of the pseudogap phase.\n", "  The self-consistent theory of localization is generalized to account for a\nweak quadratic nonlinear potential in the wave equation. For spreading wave\npackets, the theory predicts the destruction of Anderson localization by the\nnonlinearity and its replacement by algebraic subdiffusion, while classical\ndiffusion remains unaffected. In 3D, this leads to the emergence of a\nsubdiffusion-diffusion transition in place of the Anderson transition. The\naccuracy and the limitations of the theory are discussed.\n", "  A general solution for vacancy-mediated diffusion in the\ndilute-vacancy/dilute-solute limit for arbitrary crystal structures is derived\nfrom the master equation. A general numerical approach to the vacancy lattice\nGreen function reduces to the sum of a few analytic functions and numerical\nintegration of a smooth function over the Brillouin zone for arbitrary\ncrystals. The Dyson equation solves for the Green function in the presence of a\nsolute with arbitrary but finite interaction range to compute the transport\ncoefficients accurately, efficiently and automatically, including cases with\nvery large differences in solute-vacancy exchange rates. The methodology takes\nadvantage of the space group symmetry of a crystal to reduce the complexity of\nthe matrix inversion in the Dyson equation. An open-source implementation of\nthe algorithm is available, and numerical results are presented for the\nconvergence of the integration error of the bare vacancy Green function, and\ntracer correlation factors for a variety of crystals including wurtzite\n(hexagonal diamond) and garnet.\n", "  The merger of a double neutron star (NS-NS) binary may result in a rapidly\nrotating massive NS with an extremely strong magnetic field (i.e., a\nmillisecond magnetar). In this case, the magnetic spin-down of the NS remnant\nprovides an additional source of sustained energy injection, which would\ncontinuously power the merger ejecta. The thermal emission from the merger\nejecta would give rise to a bright optical \"magnetar-powered merger-nova\". In\nthis work, we carry out a complete search for magnetar-powered merger-nova from\nSwift short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) sample. We focus on short GRBs with extended\nemission or internal plateau, which may signify the presence of magnetars as\nthe central engine. We eventually find three candidates of magnetar-powered\nmerger-nova from the late observations of GRB 050724, GRB 070714B and GRB\n061006. With standard parameter values, the magnetar remnant scenario could\nwell interpret the multi-band data of all three bursts, including the extended\nemission and their late chromatic features in the optical and X-ray data. The\npeak luminosities of these merger-novae reach several times $10^{42}~{\\rm\nerg~s^{-1}}$, more than one order of magnitude brighter than the traditional\n\"kilo-novae\" with peak luminosity of $\\sim 10^{41}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$. Intense,\nmulti-color late time observations of short GRBs are encouraged to identify\nmore merger-novae in the future.\n", "  Identifying hierarchies and rankings of nodes in directed graphs is\nfundamental in many applications such as social network analysis, biology,\neconomics, and finance. A recently proposed method identifies the hierarchy by\nfinding the ordered partition of nodes which minimises a score function, termed\nagony. This function penalises the links violating the hierarchy in a way\ndepending on the strength of the violation. To investigate the resolution of\nranking hierarchies we introduce an ensemble of random graphs, the Ranked\nStochastic Block Model. We find that agony may fail to identify hierarchies\nwhen the structure is not strong enough and the size of the classes is small\nwith respect to the whole network. We analytically characterise the resolution\nthreshold and we show that an iterated version of agony can partly overcome\nthis resolution limit.\n", "  In the search for an electron antineutrino detection method with sensitivity\nbelow the 1.8 MeV threshold for the inverse beta decay reaction, beta decay\ncounting experiments with ca. 3 kBq 22Na and 60Co sources were conducted at\nunit #1 (2.775 GW_th) of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in South Africa. The\nsetup consisted of one NaI crystal to measure de-excitation and annihilation\nphotons associated with beta decay. Its volume and well shape were chosen to\nuse coincidence summing in order to differentiate between electron capture and\nbeta+ emission in 22Na. The setup was shielded from the reactor core by 8 m of\nuninterrupted concrete. Background radiation, responsible for ca. 1% of the\ntotal countrate with either source, increased by merely 3% when the reactor\nstatus changed from OFF to ON. Normalized countrates of three energy\nregions-of-interest (TOT, MED, HI) were parameterized to jointly describe the\ntime dependence of two instrumental effects and a reactor-status step function\nin a least-squares regression analysis. With the 22Na source, the fractional\ncountrate changes in the step from reactor OFF to ON were: (delA/A)_TOT =\n[-3.02 +- 0.14(stat) +- 0.07(syst)] x 10^-4, (delA/A)_MED = [+1.44 +-\n0.42(stat) +- 0.07(syst)] x 10^-4, and (delA/A)_HI = [-2.70 +- 0.26(stat) +-\n0.04(syst)] x 10^-4. The uncertainty budget is incomplete because it does not\ncontain the possible influence from environmental factors and the finite\nstability of the MCA clock-oscillator. No reactor-status dependence was\nobserved with the 60Co source. The corresponding cross sections are [1.55 +-\n0.07(stat)] x 10^-25 cm^2 for EC + beta+ decay in 22Na and [0.5 +- 1.5(stat)] x\n10^-26 cm^2 for beta- decay of 60Co. The negative sign for TOT and HI activity\nchanges in 22Na points to an antineutrino related interference effect on the\nbeta+ decay of 22Na and rules out reactor neutron induced reactions.\n", "  The emergence of topological order in graphene is in great demand for the\nrealization of quantum spin Hall states. Recently, it is theoretically proposed\nthat the spin textures of surface states in topological insulator can be\ndirectly transferred to graphene by means of proximity effect. Here we report\nthe observations of the topological proximity effect in the\ngraphene-topological insulator Bi2Se3 heterojunctions via magnetotransport\nmeasurements. The coupling between the p_z orbitals of graphene and the p\norbitals of surface states on the Bi2Se3 bottom surface can be enhanced by\napplying perpendicular negative magnetic field, resulting in a giant negative\nmagnetoresistance at the Dirac point up to about -91%. An obvious resistivity\ndip in the transfer curve at the Dirac point is also observed in the hybrid\ndevices, which is consistent with the theoretical predictions of the distorted\nDirac bands with unique spin textures inherited from Bi2Se3 surface states.\n", "  Recently we have studied in great detail a model of Hybrid Natural Inflation\n(HNI) by constructing two simple effective field theories. These two versions\nof the model allow inflationary energy scales as small as the electroweak scale\nin one of them or as large as the Grand Unification scale in the other\ntherefore covering the whole range of possible energy scales. The inflationary\nsector of the model is of the form $V(\\phi)=V_0 \\left(1+a \\cos(\\phi/f)\\right)$\nwhere $0\\leq a<1$ and the end of inflation is triggered by an independent\nwaterfall field. One interesting characteristic of this type of models is that\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is a non-monotonic function of $\\phi$ presenting\na {\\it maximum} close to the inflection point $\\phi_I=\\pi/2$ of the potential.\nBecause the scalar spectrum $\\mathcal{P}_s(k)$ of density fluctuations when\nwritten in terms of the potential is inversely proportional to $r$ we find that\n$\\mathcal{P}_s(k)$ presents a {\\it minimum} at $\\phi_{min}$. We use this\nproperty of HNI together with the observation that the spectrum is decreasing\nduring the first 8 e-folds of observable inflation to determine bounds for the\ninflationary energy scale $\\Delta$ and for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.\n", "  M dwarfs are prime targets for planet search programs, particularly of those\nfocused on the detection and characterization of rocky planets in the habitable\nzone. Understanding their magnetic activity is important because it affects our\nability to detect small planets, and it plays a key role in the\ncharacterization of the stellar environment. We analyze observations of the Ca\nII H&K and H{\\alpha} lines as diagnostics of chromospheric activity for\nlow-activity early-type M dwarfs. We analyze the time series of spectra of 71\nearly-type M dwarfs collected for the HADES project for planet search purposes.\nThe HARPS-N spectra provide simultaneously the H&K doublet and the H{\\alpha}\nline. We develop a reduction scheme able to correct the HARPS-N spectra for\ninstrumental and atmospheric effects, and to provide flux-calibrated spectra in\nunits of flux at the stellar surface. The H&K and H{\\alpha} fluxes are compared\nwith each other, and their variability is analyzed. We find that the H and K\nflux excesses are strongly correlated with each other, while the H{\\alpha} flux\nexcess is generally less correlated with the H&K doublet. We also find that\nH{\\alpha} emission does not increase monotonically with the H&K line flux,\nshowing some absorption before being filled in by chromospheric emission when\nH&K activity increases. Analyzing the time variability of the emission fluxes,\nwe derive a tentative estimate of the rotation period (of the order of a few\ntens of days) for some of the program stars, and the typical lifetime of\nchromospheric active regions (a few stellar rotations). Our results are in good\nagreement with previous studies. In particular, we find evidence that the\nchromospheres of early-type M dwarfs could be characterized by different\nfilaments coverage, affecting the formation mechanism of the H{\\alpha} line. We\nalso show that chromospheric structure is likely related to spectral type.\n", "  Perturbing a CFT by a relevant operator on a half space and letting the\nperturbation flow to the far infrared we obtain an RG interface between the UV\nand IR CFTs. If the IR CFT is trivial we obtain an RG boundary condition. The\nspace of massive perturbations thus breaks up into regions labelled by\nconformal boundary conditions of the UV fixed point. For the 2D critical Ising\nmodel perturbed by a generic relevant operator we find the assignment of RG\nboundary conditions to all flows. We use some analytic results but mostly rely\non TCSA and TFFSA numerical techniques. We investigate real as well as\nimaginary values of the magnetic field and, in particular, the RG trajectory\nthat ends at the Yang-Lee CFT. We argue that the RG interface in the latter\ncase does not approach a single conformal interface but rather exhibits\noscillatory non-convergent behaviour.\n", "  Intracellular Ca signals represent a universal mechanism of cell function.\nMessages carried by Ca are local, rapid, and powerful enough to be delivered\nover the thermal noise. A higher signal to noise ratio is achieved by a\ncooperative action of Ca release channels such as IP3 receptors or ryanodine\nreceptors arranged in clusters or release units containing a few to several\nhundred release channels. The release channels synchronize their openings via\nCa-induced-Ca-release, generating high-amplitude local Ca signals known as\npuffs in neurons or sparks in muscle cells. Despite the high release amplitude\nand positive feedback nature of the activation, Ca signals are strictly\nconfined in time and space by an unexplained termination mechanism. Here we\nshow that the collective transition of release channels from an open to a\nclosed state is identical to the phase transition associated with the reversal\nof magnetic field in an Ising ferromagnet. We demonstrate this mechanism using\nnumerical model simulations of Ca sparks over a wide range of cluster sizes\nfrom 25 to 169 release channels. While prior studies suggested contributions of\nstochastic attrition and Ca store depletion, our new simple quantitative\ncriterion closely predicts the depletion level required for spark termination\nfor each cluster size. We further formulate exact requirements for a cluster of\nrelease channels to follow the Ising model in any cell type. Thus we describe\ndeterministically the behaviour of a system on a coarser scale (release unit)\nwhich is random on a finer scale (release channels), bridging the gap between\nscales. Our results provide the first exact mapping of a nanoscale biological\nsignalling model to an interacting particle system in statistical physics,\nmaking the extensive mathematical apparatus available to quantitative biology.\n", "  We study aspects of the quantum and classical dynamics of a $3$-body system\nin 3D space with interaction depending only on mutual distances. The study is\nrestricted to solutions in the space of relative motion which are functions of\nmutual distances only. It is shown that the ground state (and some other\nstates) in the quantum case and the planar trajectories in the classical case\nare of this type. The quantum (and classical) system for which these states are\neigenstates is found and its Hamiltonian is constructed. It corresponds to a\nthree-dimensional quantum particle moving in a curved space with special\nmetric. The kinetic energy of the system has a hidden $sl(4,R)$ Lie (Poisson)\nalgebra structure, alternatively, the hidden algebra $h^{(3)}$ typical for the\n$H_3$ Calogero model. We find an exactly solvable three-body generalized\nharmonic oscillator-type potential as well as a quasi-exactly-solvable\nthree-body sextic polynomial type potential; both models have an extra\nintegral.\n", "  Recent observations have suggested that the CIII]$\\lambda1907/1909$ emission\nlines could be alternative diagnostic lines for galaxies in the reionization\nepoch. We use the F128N narrowband filter on the Hubble Space Telescope's\n($\\it{HST}$) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to search for CIII] emission in a\nsample of five galaxies at z = 5.7 in the Subaru Deep Field and the\nSubaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. Using the F128N narrowband imaging, together with\nthe broadband imaging, we do not detect CIII] emission for the five galaxies\nwith $J_{\\rm{AB}}$ ranging from 24.10 -- 27.00 in our sample. For the brightest\ngalaxy J132416.13+274411.6 in our sample (z = 5.70, $J_{\\rm{AB}} = 24.10$),\nwhich has a significantly higher signal to noise, we report a CIII] flux of\n$3.34\\pm1.81 \\times 10^{-18}$ $\\mathrm{erg\\ s^{-1}\\ cm^{-2}}$, which places a\nstringent 3-$\\rm\\sigma$ upper limit of $5.43\\times 10^{-18}$ $\\mathrm{erg\\\ns^{-1}\\ cm^{-2}}$ on CIII] flux and 6.57 \\AA\\ on the CIII] equivalent width.\nUsing the stacked image, we put a 3-$\\rm\\sigma$ upper limit on the mean CIII]\nflux of $\\mathrm{2.55\\times10^{-18}\\ erg\\ s^{-1}\\ cm^{-2}}$, and a\n3-$\\rm\\sigma$ upper limit on the mean CIII] equivalent width of 4.20 {\\AA} for\nthis sample of galaxies at z = 5.70. Combined with strong CIII] detection\nreported among high-z galaxies in the literature, our observations suggest that\nthe equivalent widths of CIII] from galaxies at z $>$ 5.70 exhibit a wide range\nof distribution. Our strong limits on CIII] emission could be used as a guide\nfor future observations in the reionization epoch.\n", "  New hidden particles could potentially be emitted and discovered in rare\nnuclear transitions. In this work we investigate the production of hidden\nvector bosons with primarily axial couplings to light quarks in nuclear\ntransitions, and we apply our results to the recent anomaly seen in $^8$Be\ndecays. The relevant matrix elements for $^8{\\rm Be}^*(1^+) \\rightarrow ^8{\\rm\nBe} (0^+)$ transitions are calculated using ${\\it ab \\, initio}$ methods with\ninter-nucleon forces derived from chiral effective field theory and the\nin-medium similarity renormalization group. We find that the emission of a\nlight axial vector with mass $m_X \\simeq 17\\, {\\rm MeV}$ can account for the\nanomaly seen in the $1^+\\to 0^+$ isoscalar transition together with the absence\nof a significant anomaly in the corresponding isovector transition. We also\nshow that such an axial vector can be derived from an anomaly-free\nultraviolet-complete theory that is consistent with current experimental data.\n", "  In this paper, we focus on the control of the mean field equilibrium of non\nlinear networks of the Langevin type in the limit of small noise. Using\niterative linear approximations, we derive a formula that prescribes a control\nstrategy in order to displace the equilibrium state of a given system, and\nremarkably find that the control function has a \"universal\" form under certain\nphysical conditions. This result can be employed to define universal protocols\nuseful, for example, in the optimal work extraction from a given reservoir.\nGeneralizations and limits of application of the method are discussed.\n", "  The masses and radii of non-rotating and rotating configurations of pure\nhadronic stars mixed with self-interacting fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter are\ncalculated within the two-fluid formalism of stellar structure equations in\ngeneral relativity. The Equation of State (EoS) of nuclear matter is obtained\nfrom the density dependent M3Y effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. We\nconsider dark matter particle mass of 1 GeV. The EoS of self-interacting dark\nmatter is taken from two-body repulsive interactions of the scale of strong\ninteractions. We explore the conditions of equal and different rotational\nfrequencies of nuclear matter and dark matter and find that the maximum mass of\ndifferentially rotating stars with self-interacting dark matter to be $\\sim\n1.94 M_\\odot$ with radius $\\sim 10.4$ kms.\n", "  We review a series of works describing thermoelectric effects in gated\ndisordered nanowires (field effect transistor device configuration). After\nconsidering the elastic coherent regime characterizing sub-Kelvin temperatures,\nwe study the inelastic activated regime occurring at higher temperatures, where\nelectronic transport is dominated by phonon-assisted hops between localised\nstates (Mott variable range hopping). The thermoelectric effects are studied as\na function of the location of the Fermi level inside the nanowire conduction\nband, notably around its edges where they become very large. We underline the\ninterest of using electron-phonon coupling around the band edges of large\narrays of parallel nanowires for energy harvesting and hot spot cooling at\nsmall scales. Multiterminal thermoelectric transport and ratchet effects are\neventually considered in the activated regime.\n", "  In this work we employ a recently proposed bifurcation analysis technique,\nthe deflated continuation algorithm, to compute steady-state solitary waveforms\nin a one-component, two dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with a\nparabolic trap and repulsive interactions. Despite the fact that this system\nhas been studied extensively, we discover a wide variety of previously unknown\nbranches of solutions. We analyze the stability of the newly discovered\nbranches and discuss the bifurcations that relate them to known solutions both\nin the near linear (Cartesian, as well as polar) and in the highly nonlinear\nregimes. While deflated continuation is not guaranteed to compute the full\nbifurcation diagram, this analysis is a potent demonstration that the algorithm\ncan discover new nonlinear states and provide insights into the energy\nlandscape of complex high-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical systems.\n", "  The scalar-tensor theory of gravitation proposed by Mbelek and\nLachi\\`{e}ze-Rey has been shown to lead to a possible explanation of the forces\nmeasured in asymmetric resonant microwave cavities. However, in the derivation\nof the equations from the action principle some inconsistencies were observed,\nlike the need no to vary the electromagnetic invariant in a scalar source term.\nAlso, the forces obtained were too high, in view of reconsideration of the\nexperiments originally reported and of newly published results. In the present\nwork the equations are re-derived using the full variation of the action, and\nalso the constant of the theory re-evaluated employing the condition that no\nanomalous gravitational effects are produced by the earth's magnetic field. It\nis shown that the equations originally employed were correct, and that the\nnewly evaluated constant gives the correct magnitude for the forces recently\nreported\n", "  We study the spatial fluctuations of the Casimir-Polder force experienced by\nan atom or a small sphere moved above a metallic plate at fixed separation\ndistance. We demonstrate that unlike the mean force, the magnitude of these\nfluctuations crucially relies on the relaxation of conduction electron in the\nmetallic bulk, and even achieves values that differ by orders of magnitude\ndepending on the amount of dissipation. We also discover that fluctuations\nsuffer a spectacular decrease at large distances in the case of nonzero\ntemperature.\n", "  We study a class of limits of the higher-dimensional Kerr-NUT-(A)dS\nspacetimes where particular roots of metric functions degenerate. Namely, we\nobtain the Taub-NUT-(A)dS and the extreme near-horizon geometries as two\nexamples of our limiting procedure. The symmetries of the resulting spacetimes\nare enhanced which is manifested by the presence of supplementary Killing\nvectors and decomposition of Killing tensors into Killing vectors.\n", "  We obtain hydrodynamic descriptions of a broad class of conserved-mass\ntransport processes on a ring. These processes are governed by chipping,\ndiffusion and coalescence of masses, where microscopic probability weights in\ntheir nonequilibrium steady states, having nontrivial correlations, are not\nknown. In these processes, we analytically calculate two transport\ncoefficients, the bulk-diffusion coefficient and the conductivity. We,\nremarkably, find that the two transport coefficients obey an equilibriumlike\nEinstein relation, although the microscopic dynamics does not satisfy detailed\nbalance condition. Using macroscopic fluctuation theory, we also show that\nprobability of density fluctuations obtained from the hydrodynamic description\nis in complete agreement with the same derived earlier in [Phys. Rev. E 93,\n062135 (2016)] using an additivity property.\n", "  Non-equilibrium time evolution in isolated many-body quantum systems\ngenerally results in thermalization. However, the relaxation process can be\nvery slow, and quasi-stationary non-thermal plateaux are often observed at\nintermediate times. The paradigmatic example is a quantum quench in an\nintegrable model with weak integrability breaking; for a long time, the state\ncan not escape the constraints imposed by the approximate integrability. We\nunveil a new mechanism of prethermalization, based on the presence of a\nsymmetry of the pre-quench Hamiltonian, which is spontaneously broken at zero\ntemperature and is explicitly broken by the post-quench Hamiltonian. The\ntypical time scale of the phenomenon is proportional to the thermal correlation\nlength of the initial state, which diverges as the temperature is lowered. We\nshow that the prethermal quasi-stationary state can be approximated by a mixed\nstate that violates cluster decomposition property. We consider two examples:\nthe transverse-field Ising chain, where the full time evolution is computed\nanalytically, and the (non integrable) ANNNI model, which is investigated\nnumerically.\n", "  We study the exponential convergence to the stationary state for\nnonequilibrium Langevin dynamics, by a perturbative approach based on\nhypocoercive techniques developed for equilibrium Langevin dynamics. The\nHamiltonian and overdamped limits (corresponding respectively to frictions\ngoing to zero or infinity) are carefully investigated. In particular, the\nmaximal magnitude of admissible perturbations are quantified as a function of\nthe friction. Numerical results based on a Galerkin discretization of the\ngenerator of the dynamics confirm the theoretical lower bounds on the spectral\ngap.\n", "  It is commonly considered that the frustration between the curvature energy\nand the chain stretching energy plays an important role in the formation of\nlyotropic liquid crystals in bicontinuous cubic phases. Theoretic and numeric\ncalculations were performed for two extreme cases: Parallel surfaces eliminate\nthe variance of the chain length; constant mean curvature surfaces eliminate\nthe variance of the mean curvature. We have implemented a model with Brakke's\nSurface Evolver which allows a competition between the two variances. The\nresult shows a compromise of the two limiting geometries. With data from real\nsystems, we are able to recover the G--D--P phase sequence which was observed\nin experiments.\n", "  We propose to use intensity correlation microscopy in combination with\nstructured illumination to image quantum emitters that exhibit antibunching\nwith a spatial resolution reaching far beyond the Rayleigh limit. Combining\nintensity measurements and intensity auto correlations up to order $m$ creates\nan effective PSF with FWHM shrunk by the factor $\\sqrt{m}$. Structured\nIllumination microscopy on the other hand introduces a resolution improvement\nof factor 2 by use of the principle of moir\\'e fringes. Here, we show that for\nlinear low-intensity excitation and linear optical detection the simultaneous\nuse of both techniques leads to an in theory unlimited resolution power with\nthe improvement scaling favorably as $m + \\sqrt{m}$ in dependence of the\ncorrelation order $m$. Hence, yielding this technique to be of interest in\nmicroscopy for imaging a variety of samples including biological ones. We\npresent the underlying theory and simulations demonstrating the highly\nincreased spatial superresolution, and point out requirements for an\nexperimental implementation.\n", "  The collective behavior of ensembles of atoms has been studied in-depth since\nthe seminal paper of Dicke [R. H. Dicke, Phys. Rev. 93, 99 (1954)], where he\ndemonstrated that a group of emitters in collective states is able to radiate\nwith increased intensity and modified decay rates in particular directions, a\nphenomenon which he called superradiance. Here, we show that the fundamental\nsetup of two atoms coupled to a single-mode cavity can be distinctly exceeding\nthe free-space superradiant behavior, a phenomenon which we call hyperradiance.\nThe effect is accompanied by strong quantum fluctuations and surprisingly\narises for atoms radiating out-of-phase, an alleged non-ideal condition, where\none expects subradiance. We are able to explain the onset of hyperradiance in a\ntransparent way by a photon cascade taking place among manifolds of Dicke\nstates with different photon numbers under particular out-of-phase coupling\nconditions. The theoretical results can be realized with current technology and\nthus should stimulate future experiments.\n", "  We address the problem of finding static and spherically symmetric\nanisotropic compact stars in general relativity that admit conformal motions.\nThe study is framed in the language of f(R) gravity theory in order to expose\nopportunity for further study in the more general theory. Exact solutions of\ncompact stars are found under the assumption that spherically symmetric\nspacetimes which admits conformal motion with matter distribution anisotropic\nin nature. In this work, two cases have been studied for the existence of such\nsolutions: first, we consider the model given by f(R) = R and then f(R) = aR+b.\nFinally, specific characteristics and physical properties have been explored by\nanalytically along with graphical representations for conformally symmetric\ncompact stars in f(R) gravity.\n", "  One of the most important O($\\alpha_s^2$) corrections to the $B \\to X_s\n\\gamma$ branching ratio originates from interference of contributions from the\ncurrent-current and photonic dipole operators. Its value has been estimated\nusing an interpolation in the charm quark mass between the known results at\n$m_c=0$ and for $m_c \\ll m_b/2$. An explicit calculation for the physical value\nof $m_c$ is necessary to remove the associated uncertainty. In the present\nwork, we evaluate all the ultraviolet counterterm contributions that are\nrelevant for this purpose.\n", "  We study the incompressible limit of a pressure correction MAC scheme [3] for\nthe unstationary compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations. Provided the\ninitial data are well-prepared, the solution of the numerical scheme converges,\nas the Mach number tends to zero, towards the solution of the classical\npressure correction inf-sup stable MAC scheme for the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations.\n", "  Phononic bandgaps of Parylene-C microfibrous thin films (muFTFs) were\ncomputationally determined by treating them as phononic crystals comprising\nidentical microfibers arranged either on a square or a hexagonal lattice. The\nmicrofibers could be columnar,chevronic, or helical in shape, and the host\nmedium could be either water or air. All bandgaps were observed to lie in the\n0.01-to-162.9-MHz regime, for microfibers of realistically chosen dimensions.\nThe upper limit of the frequency of bandgaps was the highest for the columnar\nmuFTF and the lowest for the chiral muFTF. More bandgaps exist when the host\nmedium is water than air. Complete bandgaps were observed for the columnar\nmuFTF with microfibers arranged on a hexagonal lattice in air, the chevronic\nmuFTF with microfibers arranged on a square lattice in water, and the chiral\nmuFTF with microfibers arranged on a hexagonal lattice in either air or water.\nThe softness of the Parylene-C muFTFs makes them mechanically tunable, and\ntheir bandgaps can be exploited in multiband ultrasonic filters.\n", "  Topological defects in Bloch bands, such as Dirac points in graphene, and\ntheir resulting Berry phases play an important role for the electronic dynamics\nin solid state crystals. Such defects can arise in systems with a two-atomic\nbasis due to the momentum-dependent coupling of the two sublattice states,\nwhich gives rise to a pseudo-spin texture. The topological defects appear as\nvortices in the azimuthal phase of this pseudo-spin texture. Here, we\ndemonstrate a complete measurement of the azimuthal phase in a hexagonal\noptical lattice employing a versatile method based on time-of-flight imaging\nafter off-resonant lattice modulation. Furthermore we map out the merging\ntransition of the two Dirac points induced by beam imbalance. Our work paves\nthe way to accessing geometric properties in optical lattices also with\nspin-orbit coupling and interactions.\n", "  Scalar spin chirality, a three-body spin correlation that breaks\ntime-reversal symmetry, is revealed to couple directly to circularly polarized\nlaser. This is shown by the Floquet formalism for the periodically driven\nrepulsive Hubbard model with a strong-coupling expansion. A systematic\nderivation of the effective low-energy Hamiltonian for a spin degree of freedom\nreveals that the coupling constant for scalar spin chirality can become\nsignificant for a situation in which the driving frequency and the on-site\ninteraction are comparable. This implies that the scalar chirality can be\ninduced by circularly polarized lights, or that it can be used conversely for\nprobing the chirality in Mott insulators as a circular dichroism.\n", "  During inflation, massive fields can contribute to the power spectrum of\ncurvature perturbation via a dimension-5 operator. This contribution can be\nconsidered as a bias for the program of using $n_s$ and $r$ to select inflation\nmodels. Even the dimension-5 operator is suppressed by $\\Lambda = M_p$, there\nis still a significant shift on the $n_s$-$r$ diagram if the massive fields\nhave $m\\sim H$. On the other hand, if the heavy degree of freedom appears only\nat the same energy scale as the suppression scale of the dimension-5 operator,\nthen significant shift on the $n_s$-$r$ diagram takes place at $m=\\Lambda \\sim\n70H$, which is around the inflationary time-translation symmetry breaking\nscale. Hence, the systematics from massive fields pose a greater challenge for\nfuture high precision experiments for inflationary model selection. This result\ncan be thought of as the impact of UV sensitivity to inflationary observables.\n", "  Due to its wide field of view, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is\nplagued by large amounts of scatter, where attenuated photons hit the detector,\nand corrupt the linear models used for reconstruction. Given that one can\ngenerate a good estimate of scatter however, then image accuracy can be\nretained. In the context of adaptive radiotherapy, one usually has a\nlow-scatter planning CT image of the same patient at an earlier time.\nCorrecting for scatter in the subsequent CBCT scan can either be self\nconsistent with the new measurements or exploit the prior image, and there are\nseveral recent methods that report high accuracy with the latter. In this\nstudy, we will look at the accuracy of various scatter estimation methods, how\nthey can be effectively incorporated into a statistical reconstruction\nalgorithm, along with introducing a method for matching off-line Monte-Carlo\n(MC) prior estimates to the new measurements. Conclusions we draw from testing\non a neck cancer patient are: statistical reconstruction that incorporates the\nscatter estimate significantly outperforms analytic and iterative methods with\npre-correction; and although the most accurate scatter estimates can be made\nfrom the MC on planning image, they only offer a slight advantage over the\nmeasurement based scatter kernel superposition (SKS) in reconstruction error.\n", "  Machine learning techniques are being increasingly used as flexible\nnon-linear fitting and prediction tools in the physical sciences. Fitting\nfunctions that exhibit multiple solutions as local minima can be analysed in\nterms of the corresponding machine learning landscape. Methods to explore and\nvisualise molecular potential energy landscapes can be applied to these machine\nlearning landscapes to gain new insight into the solution space involved in\ntraining and the nature of the corresponding predictions. In particular, we can\ndefine quantities analogous to molecular structure, thermodynamics, and\nkinetics, and relate these emergent properties to the structure of the\nunderlying landscape. This Perspective aims to describe these analogies with\nexamples from recent applications, and suggest avenues for new\ninterdisciplinary research.\n", "  Two-sided estimates for higher order eigenvalues are presented for a class of\nnon-local Schr\\\"odinger operators by using the jump rate and the growth of the\npotential. For instance, let $L$ be the generator of a L\\'evy process with\nL\\'evy measure $\\nu(d z):= \\rho(z) d z$ such that $\\rho(z)=\\rho(-z)$ and $$c_1\n|z|^{-(d+\\alpha_1)}\\le \\rho(z)\\le c_2|z|^{-(d+\\alpha_2)},\\ \\ |z|\\le \\kappa $$\nfor some constants $\\kappa, c_1,c_2>0$ and $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\in (0,2),$ and\nlet $c_3|x|^{\\theta_1} \\le V(x)\\le c_4|x|^{\\theta_2}$ for some constants\n$\\theta_1,\\theta_2, c_3,c_4>0$ and large $|x|$. Then the eigenvalues\n$\\lambda_1\\le \\lambda_2\\le\\cdots \\lambda_n\\le \\cdots $ of $-L+V$ satisfies the\nfollowing two-side estimate: for any $p>1$, there exists a constant $C>1$ such\nthat $$C n^{\\frac{\\theta_2\\alpha_2}{d(\\theta_2+\\alpha_2)}}\\ge \\lambda_n \\ge\nC^{-1} n^{\\frac{\\theta_1\\alpha_1}{d(\\theta_1+\\alpha_1)}},\\ \\ n\\ge 1.$$ When\n$\\alpha_1$ is variable, a better lower bound estimate is derived.\n", "  We investigate Higgs-boson pair production at the LHC when the final state\nsystem arises from decays of vector-like quarks coupling to the Higgs boson and\nthe Standard Model quarks. Our phenomenological study includes\nnext-to-leading-order QCD corrections, which are important to guarantee\naccurate predictions, and focuses on a detailed analysis of a di-Higgs signal\nin the four $b$-jet channel. Whereas existing Run II CMS and ATLAS analyses are\nnot specifically designed for probing non-resonant, vector-like-quark induced,\ndi-Higgs production, we show that they nevertheless offer some potential for\nthese modes. We then investigate the possibility of distinguishing between the\nvarious di-Higgs production mechanisms by exploiting the kinematic properties\nof the signal.\n", "  We develop a theoretical formalism for collectively responding point\nscatterers where the radiating electromagnetic fields from each emitter are\nconsidered in the electric dipole, magnetic dipole, and electric quadrupole\napproximation. The contributions of the electric quadrupole moment to\nelectromagnetically-mediated interactions between the scatterers are derived in\ndetail for a system where each scatterer represents a linear $RLC$ circuit\nresonator, representing common metamaterial resonators in radiofrequency,\nmicrowave, and optical regimes. The resulting theory includes a closed set of\nequations for an ensemble of discrete resonators that are radiatively coupled\nto each other by propagating electromagnetic fields, incorporating potentially\nstrong interactions and recurrent scattering processes. The effective model is\nillustrated and tested for examples of pairs of interacting point electric\ndipoles, where each pair can be qualitatively replaced by a model point emitter\nwith different multipole radiation moments.\n", "  There are two opposing models in the analysis of the slow transmission of\nlight pulses through saturable absorbers. The canonical incoherent bleaching\nmodel simply explains the slow transmission by combined effects of saturation\nand of non-instantaneous response of the medium resulting in absorption of the\nfront part of the incident pulse larger than that of its rear. The second\nmodel, referred to as the coherent-population-oscillations (CPO) model,\nconsiders light beams whose intensity is slightly pulse modulated and\nattributes the time delay of the transmitted pulse to a reduction of the group\nvelocity. We point out some inconsistencies in the CPO model and show that the\ntwo models lie in reality on the same hypotheses, the equations derived in the\nduly rectified CPO model being local expressions of the integral equations\nobtained in the incoherent bleaching model. For large modulation index, the CPO\nmodel, based on linearized equations, breaks down. The incoherent bleaching\nmodel then predicts that the transmitted light should vanish when the intensity\nof the incident light is strictly zero. This point is confirmed by the\nexperiments that we have performed on ruby with square-wave incident pulses and\nwe show that the whole shape of the observed pulses agrees with that derived\nanalytically by means of the incoherent bleaching model. We also determine in\nthis model the corresponding evolution of the fluorescence light, which seems\nto have been evidenced in other experiments.\n", "  One surprising result in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is that the\nabundance of various particles measured in experiments is consistent with the\npicture that they reach chemical equilibrium at a temperature much higher than\nthe temperature they freeze out kinetically. Using a multiphase transport model\nto study particle production in these collisions, we find that the above result\nis due to the constancy of the entropy per particle during the evolution of the\nhadronic matter from the chemical to the kinetic freeze-out. We further use a\nhadron resonance gas model to illustrate the result from the transport model\nstudy.\n", "  We consider the radiative properties of a system of two identical correlated\natoms interacting with the electromagnetic field in its vacuum state in the\npresence of a generic dielectric environment. We suppose that the two emitters\nare prepared in a symmetric or antisymmetric superposition of one ground state\nand one excited state and we evaluate the transition rate to the collective\nground state, showing distinctive cooperative radiative features. Using a\nmacroscopic quantum electrodynamics approach to describe the electromagnetic\nfield, we first obtain an analytical expression for the decay rate of the two\nentangled two-level atoms in terms of the Green's tensor of the generic\nexternal environment. We then investigate the emission process when both atoms\nare in free space and subsequently when a perfectly reflecting mirror is\npresent, showing how the boundary affects the physical features of the\nsuperradiant and subradiant emission by the two coupled emitters. The\npossibility to control and tailor radiative processes is also discussed.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the statistical properties of the Tully-Fisher\nrelation for a sample of 32 galaxies with measured distances from the Cepheid\nperiod-luminosity relation and/or TRGB stars.\n  We take advantage of panchromatic photometry in 12 bands (from FUV to 4.5\n$\\mu$m) and of spatially resolved HI kinematics. We use these data together\nwith three kinematic measures ($W^{i}_{50}$, $V_{max}$ and $V_{flat}$)\nextracted from the global HI profiles or HI rotation curves, so as to construct\n36 correlations allowing us to select the one with the least scatter. We\nintroduce a tightness parameter $\\sigma_{\\perp}$ of the TFr, in order to obtain\na slope-independent measure of the goodness of fit. We find that the tightest\ncorrelation occurs when we select the 3.6 $\\mu$m photometric band together with\nthe $V_{flat}$ parameter extracted from the HI rotation curve.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions play an essential\nrole in condensed matter physics. The collective excitations in the\nbroken-symmetry phase near the quantum critical point can be characterized by\nfluctuations of phase and amplitude of the order parameter. The phase\noscillations correspond to the massless Nambu$-$Goldstone modes whereas the\nmassive amplitude mode, analogous to the Higgs boson in particle physics, is\nprone to decay into a pair of low-energy Nambu$-$Goldstone modes in low\ndimensions. Especially, observation of a Higgs amplitude mode in two dimensions\nis an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using the inelastic neutron\nscattering and applying the bond-operator theory, we directly and unambiguously\nidentify the Higgs amplitude mode in a two-dimensional S=1/2 quantum\nantiferromagnet C$_9$H$_{18}$N$_2$CuBr$_4$ near a quantum critical point in two\ndimensions. Owing to an anisotropic energy gap, it kinematically prevents such\ndecay and the Higgs amplitude mode acquires an infinite lifetime.\n", "  The number of discovered TeV sources populating the extragalactic sky in 2017\nis nearly 70, mostly blazars located up to a redshift ~1. Ten years ago, in\n2007, less than 20 TeV emitters were known, up to a maximum redshift of 0.2.\nThis is a major achievement of current generation of Cherenkov telescopes\noperating in synergy with optical, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray telescopes. A\nreview of selected results from the extragalactic TeV sky is presented, with\nparticular emphasis on recently detected distant sources.\n", "  Strongly coupled dissipative optical cavities with nonlinear interactions\ngive new opportunities to explore symmetry breaking phenomena and phase\ntransitions, Josephson dynamics and quantum criticality. Among the different\nexperimental realizations, photonic crystal coupled nanocavities operating in\nthe laser regime are outstanding systems since nonlinearity, gain/dissipation\nand intercavity coupling can be judiciously tailored. Yet, although most common\nscenarios emerge from quasi-dynamical equilibrium where the gain nearly\ncompensates for losses, little is known about far out-of-equilibrium dynamics\nresulting, for instance, from short pulsed pumping inducing a classical\n\"quench\". Here we show that bimodal nanolasers generically display transient\ndynamics after quench which, when projected onto the nonlasing mode, exhibit\nsuperthermal light. Such a mechanism is akin to the fast cooling of a\nsuspension of Brownian particles under gravity, with the intracavity intensity\nplaying the role of the inverse temperature. We implement a simple experimental\ntechnique to access the probability density functions, that enabled quantifying\nthe distance from thermal equilibrium --and hence the degree of residual\norder-- via the Gibbs entropy. This allowed us to further detect mixing of\nthermal states with coherent broken parity phases, thus paving the road for\ninvestigating far nonequilibrium thermodynamics with multimode optical\noscillators.\n", "  We present the QCD predictions for the azimuthal $\\cos 2\\varphi$ asymmetry in\ncharm leptoproduction for the kinematics of the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The\nasymmetry is predicted to be large, about 15%. The radiative corrections to the\nQCD predictions for the $\\cos 2\\varphi$ distribution are estimated to be small,\nless than 10%. Our calculations show that the azimuthal asymmetry in charm\nproduction is well defined in pQCD: it is stable both perturbatively and\nparametrically, and practically insensitive to theoretical uncertainties in the\ninput parameters. We analyze the nonperturbative contributions to the $\\cos\n2\\varphi$ distribution due to the gluon transverse motion in the target and the\n$c$-quark fragmentation. Because of the $c$-quark low mass, the nonperturbative\ncontributions are expected to be sizable, about (30--40)%. We conclude that\nextraction of the azimuthal asymmetries from available COMPASS data will\nprovide valuable information about the transverse momentum dependent\ndistribution of the gluon in the proton and the $c$-quark hadronization\nmechanism. Finally, we discuss the $\\cos 2\\varphi$ asymmetry as a probe of the\ngluonic analogue of the Boer-Mulders function, $h_{1}^{\\perp g}$, describing\nthe linear polarization of gluons inside unpolarized proton.\n", "  Quantifying coherence is an essential endeavor for both quantum foundations\nand quantum technologies. In this paper, we put forward a quantitative measure\nof coherence by following the axiomatic definition of coherence measures\nintroduced in [T. Baumgratz, M. Cramer, and M. B. Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113,\n140401 (2014)]. Our measure is based on fidelity and analytically computable\nfor arbitrary states of a qubit. As one of its applications, we show that our\nmeasure can be used to examine whether a pure qubit state can be transformed\ninto another pure or mixed qubit state only by incoherent operations.\n", "  The Radon-Nikodym formalism is used to study the structure of the set of\npositive maps from $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H})$ into itself, where $\\mathcal{H}$\nis a finite dimensional Hilbert space. In particular, this formalism was\nemployed to formulate simple criteria which ensure that certain maps are non\ndecomposable. In that way, a recipe for construction of non decomposable maps\nwas obtained.\n", "  We have directly imaged reversible electrical switching of the cycloidal\nrotation direction (magnetic polarity) in a (111)-BiFeO3 epitaxial-film device\nat room temperature by non-resonant x-ray magnetic scattering. Consistent with\nprevious reports, fully relaxed (111)-BiFeO3 epitaxial films consisting of a\nsingle ferroelectric domain were found to comprise a sub-micron-scale mosaic of\nmagneto-elastic domains, all sharing a common direction of the magnetic\npolarity, which was found to switch reversibly upon reversal of the\nferroelectric polarization without any measurable change of the magneto-elastic\ndomain population. A real-space polarimetry map of our device clearly\ndistinguished between regions of the sample electrically addressed into the two\nmagnetic states with a resolution of a few tens of micron. Contrary to the\ngeneral belief that the magneto-electric coupling in BiFeO3 is weak, we find\nthat electrical switching has a dramatic effect on the magnetic structure, with\nthe magnetic moments rotating on average by 90 degrees at every cycle.\n", "  An improved wetting boundary implementation strategy is proposed based on\nlattice Boltzmann color-gradient model in this paper. In this strategy, an\nextra interface force condition is demonstrated based on the diffuse interface\nassumption and is employed in contact line region. It has been validated by\nthree benchmark problems: static droplet wetting on a flat surface and a curved\nsurface, and dynamic capillary filling. Good performances are shown in all\nthree cases. Relied on the strict validation to our scheme, the viscous\nfingering phenomenon of immiscible fluids displacement in a two-dimensional\nchannel has been restudied in this paper. High viscosity ratio, wide range\ncontact angle, accurate moving contact line and mutual independence between\nsurface tension and viscosity are the obvious advantages of our model. We find\nthe linear relationship between the contact angle and displacement velocity or\nvariation of finger length. When the viscosity ratio is smaller than 20, the\ndisplacement velocity is increasing with increasing viscosity ratio and\nreducing capillary number, and when the viscosity ratio is larger than 20, the\ndisplacement velocity tends to a specific constant. A similar conclusion is\nobtained on the variation of finger length.\n", "  Satellite tracking involves sending electromagnetic signals to Earth. Both\nthe orbit of the spacecraft and the electromagnetic signals themselves are\naffected by the curvature of spacetime. The arrival time of the pulses is\ncompared to the ticks of local clocks to reconstruct the orbital path of the\nsatellite to high accuracy, and to implicitly measure general relativistic\neffects. In particular, Schwarzschild space curvature (static) and\nframe-dragging (stationary) due to the planet's spin affect the satellite's\norbit. The dominant relativistic effect on the path of the signal photons is\nShapiro delay due to static space curvature. We compute these effects for some\ncurrent and proposed space missions, using a Hamiltonian formulation in four\ndimensions. For highly eccentric orbits, such as in the Juno mission and in the\nCassini Grand Finale, the relativistic effects have a kick-like nature, which\ncould be advantageous for detecting them if their signatures are properly\nmodeled as functions of time. Frame-dragging appears, in principle, measurable\nby Juno and Cassini, though not by Galileo 5 and 6. Practical measurement would\nrequire disentangling frame-dragging from the Newtonian 'foreground' such as\nthe gravitational quadrupole which has an impact on both the spacecraft's orbit\nand the signal propagation. The foreground problem remains to be solved.\n", "  We focus on three-dimensional QRLG with the purpose of shedding light on the\nlink between reduced LQG and LQC in four space-time dimensions. Considering\nhomogeneous three-dimensional LQG, the theory simplifies to QRLG. We then\nimplement Thiemann's Quantum Spin Dynamics for Euclidean three-dimensional\nspace-time in presence of a real scalar matter field. We deploy a polymer\nquantization of the scalar field while using methods of quantum reduced loop\ngravity. We compute the scalar Hamiltonian operator on the states of the\nkinematical Hilbert space of the theory, and exhibit its matrix elements that\nare derived using a new simplified method. The coupling to matter, which plays\nthe role of a carrier of dynamics, opens the pathway to the study of\nphenomenological implications. We finally comment on the relations between\nthree-dimensional QRLG and LQC, as well as on the appearance of the\ncorrespondence principle for the scalar field.\n", "  We report the efficient coherent photon scattering from a semiconductor\nquantum dot embedded in a pillar microcavity. We show that a surface acoustic\nwave can periodically modulate the energy levels of the quantum dot, but has a\nnegligible effect on the cavity mode. The scattered narrow-band laser is\nconverted to a pulsed single-photon stream, displaying an anti-bunching dip\ncharacteristic of single-photon emission. Multiple phonon sidebands are\nresolved in the emission spectrum, due to the absorption and emission of\nvibrational quanta in each scattering event.\n", "  Spin wave dispersion in the metallic antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Pt was\ninvestigated just above the order-order transition temperature by using the\ninelastic neutron scattering technique. The spin wave dispersion at $T = 400$ K\nalong [100], [110] and [111] directions was isotropic within the measurement\naccuracy. The dispersion was described by $({\\hbar\\omega})^2 = c^2q^2 +\n\\Delta^2$ with $c = 190$ meV {\\AA} and $\\Delta = 3.3$ meV. Compared with the\ndispersion at $T = 419$ K previously reported, the result demonstrates a large\nreduction of the stiffness constant $c$ with increasing temperature. This is\nsimilar to that observed in the metallic antiferromagnet FePt$_3$, and is an\nindication of the itinerancy of the magnetic moments.\n", "  Gee-Haw Whammy Diddle is a seemingly simple mechanical toy consisting of a\nwooden stick and a second stick that is made up of a series of notches with a\npropeller at its end. When the wooden stick is pulled over the notches, the\npropeller starts to rotate. In spite of its simplicity, physical principles\ngoverning the motion of the stick and the propeller are rather complicated and\ninteresting. Here we provide a thorough analysis of the system and parameters\ninfluencing the motion. We show that contrary to the results published on this\ntopic so far, neither elliptic motion of the stick nor frequency\nsynchronization is needed for starting the motion of the propeller.\n", "  We revisit the model of graphene as a $\\pi$-conjugated macromolecule\n\\cite{PRL} and show that it allows to understand the origin and describe, in\nmany cases explicitly, the electronic structure of graphene sheets, achiral\ngraphene ribbons and carbon tubes of any size, and also graphene tori on the\nbasis of the exact solution to the eigenvalue problem for the respective\nstructures. The exact expressions of dispersion relations and detectable\nobservables for these structures are compared with the predictions of other\nrelated models demonstrating that the revisited model either suggests the exact\nversions of widely used approximations or shows their limited applicability.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the application of finite element methods to\nobtain solutions for steady fully developed second-grade flows in a curved pipe\nof circular cross-section and arbitrary curvature ratio, under a given axial\npressure gradient. The qualitative and quantitative behavior of the secondary\nflows is analyzed with respect to inertia and viscoelasticity.\n", "  We use mobile phone records for the analysis of mobility patterns and the\ndetection of possible risk zones of Chagas disease in two Latin American\ncountries. We show that geolocalized call records are rich in social and\nindividual information, which can be used to infer whether an individual has\nlived in an endemic area. We present two case studies, in Argentina and in\nMexico, using data provided by mobile phone companies from each country. The\nrisk maps that we generate can be used by health campaign managers to target\nspecific areas and allocate resources more effectively.\n", "  GeV-TeV gamma-ray and PeV-EeV neutrino backgrounds provide a unique window on\nthe nature of the ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs). We discuss the\nimplications of the recent Fermi-LAT data regarding the extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground (EGB) and related estimates of the contribution of point sources as\nwell as IceCube neutrino data on the origin of the UHECRs. We calculate the\ndiffuse flux of cosmogenic $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos produced during the\nUHECRs propagation and derive constraints on the possible cosmological\nevolution of UHECR sources. In particular, we show that the mixed-composition\nscenario which is in agreement with both (i) Auger measurements of the energy\nspectrum and composition up to the highest energies and (ii) the ankle-like\nfeature in the light component detected by KASCADE-Grande, is compatible with\nboth the Fermi-LAT measurements and with current IceCube limits.\n", "  In this paper we consider the stationary Schroedinger equation for a\nself-conjugated Hamiltonian $H = \\frac{e+f}{i}$, where $e$ and $f$ is an\nanti-unitary pair of the canonical Cartan \"creating\" and \"annihilation\"\noperators for the classical Lie algebra $sl_2$ taken in the representation with\n\"the lowest weight equals to $1$\". In this paper we prove that this operator\nhas the continuous spectrum. Construction of eigenstates for $H$ is given in\ndetails.\n", "  We propose a scheme to induce weak-light nonlinearity in a double quantum\ndot. The scheme positively utilizes locality and dissipation of an external\nauxiliary system. As a plausible setup, we consider a complex system in which a\nlocalized plasmon field from a metallic nanotip couples with only one of the\ncoupled quantum dots. The perturbative calculation with respect to the light\nintensity shows that, even by a sufficiently weak light, a dipole-forbidden\ntwo-exciton NOON state is prepared as the steady state. This result can be\nexplained by combining the two factors: decoherence-induced quantum state\npreparation and two-photon resonance. The present work implies that the\npositive usage of both the locality and the dissipation in the external\nauxiliary system is promising for inducing two-photon processes effectively,\nand provides one guideline to weak-light nonlinearities.\n", "  We have investigated the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of\nBa$_2$FeMoO$_6$ thin films produced by pulsed laser deposition from optimized\nbulk material. The films are comprised of grains of crystalline Ba$_2$FeMoO$_6$\nwith a disordered grain boundary region that lowers the net saturation\nmagnetization of the film and prevents full magnetic alignment below a Curie\ntemperature $T_C$$\\sim$305 K. Magnetotransport measurements point to the\nBa$_2$FeMoO$_6$ grains retaining the high spin polarization of a half-metal up\nto $T_C$, while the grain boundaries greatly reduce the spin polarization of\nthe intergrain electrical current due to spin-flip scattering. Our results show\nthat a strong spin polarization of the electronic charge carriers is present\neven in Ba$_2$FeMoO$_6$ films that do not show the ideal bulk magnetic\ncharacter.\n", "  We show that, upon the observation of a specific measurement statistic, Dicke\nstates can be self-tested. Our work is based on a generalization of the\nprotocol considered by Wu et al. [PRA 90 042339 (2014)], and constitutes a\ndevice-independent method for the characterization of a physical device. For\nrealistic situations where experimental imperfections lead to a deviation from\nthe ideal statistics, we give an estimate for the fidelity of the physical\nstate compared to the ideal Dicke state.\n", "  We present a fast and spectrally accurate numerical scheme for the evaluation\nof the gyroaveraged electrostatic potential in non-periodic gyrokinetic-Poisson\nsimulations. Our method relies on a reformulation of the gyrokinetic-Poisson\nsystem in which the gyroaverage in Poisson's equation is computed for the\ncompactly supported charge density instead of the non-periodic, non-compactly\nsupported potential itself. We calculate this gyroaverage with a combination of\ntwo Fourier transforms and a Hankel transform, which has the near optimal run\ntime complexity $O(N_{\\rho}(P+\\hat{P})\\log(P+\\hat{P}))$, where $P$ is the\nnumber of spatial grid points, $\\hat{P}$ the number of grid points in Fourier\nspace, and $N_{\\rho}$ the number of grid points in velocity space. We present\nnumerical examples illustrating the performance of our code and demonstrating\ngeometric convergence of the error.\n", "  We consider light propagation in a spacetime whose kinematics allow weak\nbirefringence, and whose dynamics have recently been derived by gravitational\nclosure. Revisiting the definitions of luminosity and angular diameter\ndistances in this setting, we present a modification of the Etherington\ndistance duality relation in a weak gravitational field around a point mass.\nThis provides the first concrete example of how the non-metricities implied by\ngravitational closure of birefringent electrodynamics affect observationally\ntestable relations.\n", "  We investigate macroscopic behavior of a dynamical network consisting of a\ntime-evolving wiring of interactions among a group of random walkers. We assume\nthat each walker (agent) has an oscillator and show that depending upon the\nnature of interaction, synchronization arises where each of the individual\noscillators are allowed to move in such a random walk manner in a finite region\nof three dimensional space. Here the vision range of each oscillator decides\nthe number of oscillators with which it interacts. The live interaction between\nthe oscillators is of intermediate type ( i.e., not local as well as not\nglobal) and may or may not be bidirectional. We analytically derive density\ndependent threshold of coupling strength for synchronization using linear\nstability analysis and numerically verify the obtained analytical results.\nAdditionally, we explore the concept of basin stability, a nonlinear measure\nbased on volumes of basin of attractions, to investigate how stable the\nsynchronous state is under large perturbations. The synchronization phenomenon\nis analyzed taking limit cycle and chaotic oscillators for wide ranges of\nparameters like interaction strength k between the walkers, speed of movement v\nand vision range r.\n", "  We report enhancing of complete synchronization in identical chaotic\noscillators when their interaction is mediated by a mismatched oscillator. The\nidentical oscillators now interact indirectly through the intermediate relay\noscillator. The induced heterogeneity in the intermediate oscillator plays a\nconstructive role in reducing the critical coupling for a transition to\ncomplete synchronization. A common lag synchronization emerges between the\nmismatched relay oscillator and its neighboring identical oscillators that\nleads to this enhancing effect. We present examples of one-dimensional open\narray, a ring, a star network and a two-dimensional lattice of dynamical\nsystems to demonstrate how this enhancing effect occurs. The paradigmatic\nR\\\"ossler oscillator is used as a dynamical unit, in our numerical experiment,\nfor different networks to reveal the enhancing phenomenon.\n", "  A new form of Darboux-B\\\"acklund transformation and its higher order form is\nderived for Derivative Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation(DNLS). The new form\narises due to the different form of Lax pair. It is observed that by a special\nchoice of the eigenvalue of DB transformation one can generate a mixed form of\nsolution(containing both algebraic and exponential dependence on (x, t) can be\ngenerated. On the other hand by adopting a new methodology due to Neugebauer\net. al. it is found that purely rational solution can be constructed. The two\ndifferent approach yields different class of solution and are compared.\n", "  We present a study of the dependencies of shear and ellipticity bias on\nsimulation (input) and measured (output) parameters, noise, PSF anisotropy,\npixel size and the model bias coming from two different and independent shape\nestimators. We use simulated images from Galsim based on the GREAT3\ncontrol-space-constant branch and we measure ellipticity and shear bias from a\nmodel-fitting method (gFIT) and a moment-based method (KSB). We show the bias\ndependencies found on input and output parameters for both methods and we\nidentify the main dependencies and causes. We find consistent results between\nthe two methods (given the precision of the analysis) and important\ndependencies on orientation and morphology properties such as flux, size and\nellipticity. We show cases where shear bias and ellipticity bias behave very\ndifferent for the two methods due to the different nature of these\nmeasurements. We also show that noise and pixelization play an important role\non the bias dependences on the output properties. We find a large model bias\nfor galaxies consisting of a bulge and a disk with different ellipticities or\norientations. We also see an important coupling between several properties on\nthe bias dependences. Because of this we need to study several properties\nsimultaneously in order to properly understand the nature of shear bias.\n", "  In Paris Basin, we evaluate how HTEM data complement the usual borehole,\ngeological and deep seismic data used for modelling aquifer geometries. With\nthese traditional data, depths between ca. 50 to 300m are often relatively\nill-constrained, as most boreholes lie within the first tens of meters of the\nunderground and petroleum seismic is blind shallower than ca. 300m. We have\nfully reprocessed and re-inverted 540km of flight lines of a SkyTEM survey of\n2009, acquired on a 40x12km zone with 400m line spacing. The resistivity model\nis first \"calibrated\" with respect to ca. 50 boreholes available on the study\narea. Overall, the correlation between EM resistivity models and the\nhydrogeological horizons clearly shows that the geological units in which the\naquifers are developed almost systematically correspond to relative increase of\nresistivity, whatever the \"background\" resistivity environment and the\nlithology of the aquifer. In 3D Geomodeller software, this allows interpreting\n11 aquifer/aquitar layers along the flight lines and then jointly interpolating\nthem in 3D along with the borehole data. The resulting model displays 3D\naquifer geometries consistent with the SIGES \"reference\" regional\nhydrogeological model and improves it in between the boreholes and on the\n50-300m depth range.\n", "  The semiclassical origins of the enhancement of shell effects in exotic-shape\nmean-field potentials are investigated by focusing attention on the roles of\nthe local symmetries associated with the periodic-orbit bifurcations. The\ndeformed shell structures for four types of pure octupole shapes in the nuclear\nmean-field model having a realistic radial dependence are analyzed. Remarkable\nshell effects are shown for a large Y32 deformation having tetrahedral\nsymmetry. Much stronger shell effects found in the shape parametrization\nsmoothly connecting the sphere and the tetrahedron are investigated from the\nview point of the classical-quantum correspondence. The local dynamical\nsymmetries associated with the bridge orbit bifurcations are shown to have\nsignificant roles in emergence of the exotic deformed shell structures for\ncertain combinations of the surface diffuseness and the tetrahedral deformation\nparameters.\n", "  Long-distance entanglement distribution is essential both for foundational\ntests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss,\nhowever, the previously achieved distance was limited to ~100 km. Here, we\ndemonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two\nlocations separated by 1203 km on the Earth, through satellite-to-ground\ntwo-downlink with a sum of length varies from 1600 km to 2400 km. We observe a\nsurvival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by\n2.37+/-0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective\nlink efficiency at 1200 km in this work is over 12 orders of magnitude higher\nthan the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through the best\ncommercial telecommunication fibers with a loss of 0.16 dB/km.\n", "  This is a brief comment on the paper \"Quantum mechanics needs no\nconsciousness\" by Shan Yu and Danko Nikolic [1]. Yu and Nikolic argue that the\n\"consciousness causes collapse hypothesis\" interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nor CCCH, can be falsified by a particular experimental setup. This claim is\nincorrect and the cause of the error appears to be a confusion over where and\nwhen a collapse can be assumed to occur.\n", "  We report first-principles phonon frequencies and anharmonic thermodynamic\nproperties of h.c.p. Re and Tc calculated within the quasi-harmonic\napproximation, including Gr\\\"uneisen parameters, temperature-dependent lattice\nparameters, thermal expansion, and isobaric heat capacity. We discuss the\ndifferences between a full treatment of anisotropy and a simplified approach\nwith a constant $c/a$ ratio. The results are systematically compared with the\navailable experimental data and an overall satisfactory agreement is obtained.\n", "  In the context of the ESA M5 (medium mission) call we proposed a new\nsatellite mission, Theia, based on relative astrometry and extreme precision to\nstudy the motion of very faint objects in the Universe. Theia is primarily\ndesigned to study the local dark matter properties, the existence of Earth-like\nexoplanets in our nearest star systems and the physics of compact objects.\nFurthermore, about 15 $\\%$ of the mission time was dedicated to an open\nobservatory for the wider community to propose complementary science cases.\nWith its unique metrology system and \"point and stare\" strategy, Theia's\nprecision would have reached the sub micro-arcsecond level. This is about 1000\ntimes better than ESA/Gaia's accuracy for the brightest objects and represents\na factor 10-30 improvement for the faintest stars (depending on the exact\nobservational program). In the version submitted to ESA, we proposed an optical\n(350-1000nm) on-axis TMA telescope. Due to ESA Technology readiness level, the\ncamera's focal plane would have been made of CCD detectors but we anticipated\nan upgrade with CMOS detectors. Photometric measurements would have been\nperformed during slew time and stabilisation phases needed for reaching the\nrequired astrometric precision.\n", "  We summarize the new results on $B$ meson mixing and mixing-related $CP$\nviolation presented at CKM2016. We place these results in the context of both\nprevious experimental measurements and the most recent theoretical developments\nin the field, and discuss prospects for ongoing and future mixing and\nmixing-related $CP$ violation measurements.\n", "  We present a study of inertial modes in a differentially rotating spherical\nshell (spherical Couette flow) experiment with a radius ratio of $\\eta = 1/3$.\nInertial modes are Coriolis-restored linear wave modes which often arise in\nrapidly rotating fluids. Recent experimental work has shown that inertial modes\nexist in a spherical Couette flow for $\\Omega_{i}<\\Omega_{o}$, where $\\Omega_i$\nand $\\Omega_o$ is the inner and outer sphere rotation rate. A finite number of\nparticular inertial modes has previously been found. By scanning the Rossby\nnumber from $-2.5 < Ro = (\\Omega_{i}-\\Omega_{o})/\\Omega_{o} < 0$ at two fixed\n$\\Omega_{o}$, we report the existence of similar inertial modes. However, the\nbehavior of the flow described here differs much from previous spherical\nCouette experiments. We show that the kinetic energy of the dominant inertial\nmode dramatically increases with decreasing Rossby number that eventually leads\nto a wave-breaking and an increase of small-scale structures at a critical\nRossby number. Such a transition in a spherical Couette flow has not been\ndescribed before. The critical Rossby number scales with the Ekman number as0\n$E^{1/5}$. Additionally, the increase of small-scale features beyond the\ntransition transfers energy to a massively enhanced mean flow around the\ntangent cylinder. In this context, we discuss an interaction between the\ndominant inertial modes with a geostrophic Rossby mode exciting secondary modes\nwhose frequencies match the triadic resonance condition.\n", "  We use a secular model to describe the non-resonant dynamics of\ntrans-Neptunian objects in the presence of an external ten-earth-mass\nperturber. The secular dynamics is analogous to an \"eccentric Kozai mechanism\"\nbut with both an inner component (the four giant planets) and an outer one (the\neccentric distant perturber). By the means of Poincar\\'e sections, the cases of\na non-inclined or inclined outer planet are successively studied, making the\nconnection with previous works. In the inclined case, the problem is reduced to\ntwo degrees of freedom by assuming a non-precessing argument of perihelion for\nthe perturbing body.\n  The size of the perturbation is typically ruled by the semi-major axis of the\nsmall body: we show that the classic integrable picture is still valid below\nabout 70 AU, but it is progressively destroyed when we get closer to the\nexternal perturber. In particular, for a>150 AU, large-amplitude orbital flips\nbecome possible, and for a>200 AU, the Kozai libration islands are totally\nsubmerged by the chaotic sea. Numerous resonance relations are highlighted. The\nmost large and persistent ones are associated to apsidal alignments or\nanti-alignments with the orbit of the distant perturber.\n", "  One of the most robust relationships predicted by binary tetrahedral\n($T^{'}$) flavor symmetry relates the reactor neutrino angle $\\theta_{13}$ to\nthe atmospheric neutrino angle $\\theta_{23}$, independently of $\\theta_{12}$.\nIt has the form $\\theta_{13} = \\sqrt{2} |\\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\theta_{23}|$. When\nthis prediction first appeared in 2008, $\\theta_{13}$ was consistent with zero\nand $\\theta_{23}$ with $\\pi/4$. Non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ was established by Daya\nBay in 2012. Non-zero $|\\frac{\\pi}{4}-\\theta_{23}|$ is now favored by the\nNO$\\nu$A experiment and, for $\\theta_{23}$, the aforementioned $T^{'}$ relation\nselects the second octant ($\\theta_{23} > \\frac{\\pi}{4}$) over the first octant\n($\\theta_{23} < \\frac{\\pi}{4}$). This analysis initially assumes CP\nconservation in the lepton sector, but leptonic CP violation is discussed and\nit is shown that this specific $T^{'}$ relationship is invariant.\n", "  The ARGO-YBJ experiment, a full coverage extensive air shower (EAS) detector\nlocated at high altitude (4300 m a.s.l.) in Tibet, China, has smoothly taken\ndata, with very high stability, since November 2007 to the beginning of 2013.\nThe array consisted of a carpet of about 7000 m$^2$ Resistive Plate Chambers\n(RPCs) operated in streamer mode and equipped with both digital and analog\nreadout, providing the measurement of particle densities up to few particles\nper cm$^2$. The unique detector features (full coverage, readout granularity,\nwide dynamic range, etc) and location (very high altitude) allowed a detailed\nstudy of the lateral density profile of charged particles at ground very close\nto the shower axis and its description by a proper lateral distribution\nfunction (LDF). In particular, the information collected in the first 10 m from\nthe shower axis have been shown to provide a very effective tool for the\ndetermination of the shower development stage (\"age\") in the energy range 50\nTeV - 10 PeV. The sensitivity of the age parameter to the mass composition of\nprimary Cosmic Rays is also discussed.\n", "  Interfacial ultrafast electron migration processes are simulated in finite\ncluster models of dye-sensitized solar cells within a single active electron\napproach. Initially, three different donor-acceptor $\\pi$-conjugated dyes\nsupported on colloidal titania clusters are compared from the perspective of\ntheir optical and electronic properties. The potential performance of the model\nsolar cell devices for charge migration processes is predicted from a static\nperspective. For this purpose, parameter-free expressions for state-resolved\ninjection times and currents are established and evaluated for the three\nsystems. A broadband laser excitation promoting the excited states in the\nvisible region initiates the electron migration process. The evolution of the\nelectronic wave packet is analyzed with a density-based toolset including the\nelectronic yields partitioned for characteristic fragments of the model\ncomplexes and the time-dependent one-electron density for distinctive time\nsteps in the dynamics. On the one hand, these reveal a microscopic picture for\nthe mechanistic pathway of the charge migration and on the other hand, they\nvalidate the results from the time-independent analysis concerning the\nphotovoltaic efficiency.\n", "  In this thesis, first, we investigate the metrological usefulness of a family\nof states known as unpolarized Dicke states, which turn to be very sensitive to\nthe magnetic field. Quantum mechanics plays a central role in achieving such a\nhigh precision. Second, we investigate possible lower bounds on the quantum\nFisher information, a quantity that characterizes the usefulness of a state for\nquantum metrology, using the theory of Legendre transforms such that we obtain\ntight lower bounds based on few measurements of the initial quantum state that\nwill be used for metrology. And last but not least, we investigate gradient\nmagnetometry, i.e., we develop a theory to study the sensitivity of some states\non the change in space of the magnetic field.\n", "  In the last decade, a large number of studies at the experimental level in\nelectrochemical systems for energy storage devices have been performed.\nHowever, theoretical approaches are highly desirable to understand the\nphysicochemical properties giving rise to energy storage phenomena. This work\nwas intended to provide insights into the $in$ $silico$ design of novel\nnanocomposite materials formed by the Keggin polyoxometalate SiW12 anchored to\nan organic functional group $\\varphi-X$ (with $X = -NH2, -OH, -COH$ and\n$-COOH$), linked to a carbon nanotube. In these systems, the Density of States\naround the Fermi level is enhanced, giving the composite material the capacity\nof facile electron transport that may be determinant at the charge/discharge\ncycling performed in energy storage devices. Charge transfer at the composite\nmaterials under study is greatest for the $\\varphi-COOH$ functional group,\nyielding an attraction with the SiW12 cluster of the same order of magnitude as\nthat of covalent nature. The rest of the functional groups induce a\nnon-covalent interaction of the electrostatic type, mediated by a van der Waals\nattraction. Our proposed methodology may represent a tool to develop novel\nelectrode materials that may improve the performance on energy storage devices,\nsuch as supercapacitors or Li$-$ion batteries.\n", "  What does the informational complexity of dynamical networked systems tell us\nabout intrinsic mechanisms and functions of these complex systems? Recent\ncomplexity measures such as integrated information have sought to\noperationalize this problem taking a whole-versus-parts perspective, wherein\none explicitly computes the amount of information generated by a network as a\nwhole over and above that generated by the sum of its parts during state\ntransitions. While several numerical schemes for estimating network integrated\ninformation exist, it is instructive to pursue an analytic approach that\ncomputes integrated information as a function of network weights. Our\nformulation of integrated information uses a Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the multi-variate distribution on the set of network states versus the\ncorresponding factorized distribution over its parts. Implementing stochastic\nGaussian dynamics, we perform computations for several prototypical network\ntopologies. Our findings show increased informational complexity near\ncriticality, which remains consistent across network topologies. Spectral\ndecomposition of the system's dynamics reveals how informational complexity is\ngoverned by eigenmodes of both, the network's covariance and adjacency\nmatrices. We find that as the dynamics of the system approach criticality, high\nintegrated information is exclusively driven by the eigenmode corresponding to\nthe leading eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, while sub-leading modes get\nsuppressed. The implication of this result is that it might be favorable for\ncomplex dynamical networked systems such as the human brain or communication\nsystems to operate near criticality so that efficient information integration\nmight be achieved.\n", "  We overview our recent work defining and studying normal crossings varieties\nand subvarieties in symplectic topology. This work answers a question of Gromov\non the feasibility of introducing singular (sub)varieties into symplectic\ntopology in the case of normal crossings singularities. It also provides a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for smoothing normal crossings symplectic\nvarieties. In addition, we explain some connections with other areas of\nmathematics and discuss a few directions for further research.\n", "  Conclusions: (1) Calculations with an RPA correction added to the BCS pairing\ncorrection conventionally employed in Nilsson-Strutinskij calculations account\nwell for the variation with A of the pattern of masses near N=Z. (2) The RPA\ncorrection is insignificant for reproducing the doubly even masses and hence\nfor the shape of the Wigner cusp. (3) It is important, however, that the\nmacroscopic (liquid drop) symmetry energy be proportional to T(T+1). (4) This\nform of the macroscopic symmetry energy is understood microscopically, in terms\nof the RPA, to result from the nuclear superfluidity. (5) The variation of the\nshape of the Wigner cusp is dominated by shell effects. (6) The RPA correction\nsignifically reduces the T=0 binding in doubly odd nuclei, thus reducing the\nrequired pair coupling constant.\n", "  How does our nervous system successfully acquire feedback control strategies\nin spite of a wide spectrum of response dynamics from different\nmusculo-skeletal systems? The cerebellum is a crucial brain structure in\nenabling precise motor control in animals. Recent advances suggest that\nsynaptic plasticity of cerebellar Purkinje cells involves molecular mechanisms\nthat mimic the dynamics of the efferent motor system that they control allowing\nthem to match the timing of their learning rule to behavior. Counter-Factual\nPredictive Control (CFPC) is a cerebellum-based feed-forward control scheme\nthat exploits that principle for acquiring anticipatory actions. CFPC extends\nthe classical Widrow-Hoff/Least Mean Squares by inserting a forward model of\nthe downstream closed-loop system in its learning rule. Here we apply that same\ninsight to the problem of learning the gains of a feedback controller. To that\nend, we frame a Model-Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) problem and derive an\nadaptive control scheme treating the gains of a feedback controller as if they\nwere the weights of an adaptive linear unit. Our results demonstrate that\nrather than being exclusively confined to cerebellar learning, the approach of\ncontrolling plasticity with a forward model of the subsystem controlled, an\napproach that we term as Model-Enhanced Least Mean Squares (ME-LMS), can\nprovide a solution to wide set of adaptive control problems.\n"]}
