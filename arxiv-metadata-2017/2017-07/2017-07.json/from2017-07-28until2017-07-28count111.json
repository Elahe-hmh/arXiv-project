We show that the single-mode\napproximation is not valid for arbitrary states, finding corrections to\nprevious studies beyond such approximation in the bosonic and fermionic cases.\nWe also exhibit a class of wave packets for which the single-mode approximation\nis justified subject to the peaking constraints set by an appropriate Fourier\ntransform.\n", "  A canonical transformation which relates the model of a massive relativistic\nparticle moving near the horizon of an extremal black hole in four dimensions\nand the conventional conformal mechanics is constructed in two different ways.\nThe first approach makes use of the action-angle variables in the angular\nsector. The second scheme relies upon integrability of the system in the sense\nof Liouville.\n", "  We study higher form Proca equations on Einstein manifolds with boundary data\nalong conformal infinity. We solve these Laplace-type boundary problems\nformally, and to all orders, by constructing an operator which projects\narbitrary forms to solutions. We also develop a product formula for solving\nthese asymptotic problems in general. The central tools of our approach are (i)\nthe conformal geometry of differential forms and the associated exterior\ntractor calculus, and (ii) a generalised notion of scale which encodes the\nconnection between the underlying geometry and its boundary. The latter also\ncontrols the breaking of conformal invariance in a very strict way by coupling\nconformally invariant equations to the scale tractor associated with the\ngeneralised scale. From this, we obtain a map from existing solutions to new\nones that exchanges Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Together, the\nscale tractor and exterior structure extend the solution generating algebra of\n[31] to a conformally invariant, Poincare--Einstein calculus on (tractor)\ndifferential forms. This calculus leads to explicit holographic formulae for\nall the higher order conformal operators on weighted differential forms,\ndifferential complexes, and Q-operators of [9]. This complements the results of\nAubry and Guillarmou [3] where associated conformal harmonic spaces parametrise\nsmooth solutions.\n", "  We derive a stationary and axisymmetric black hole solution to quadratic\norder in the spin angular momentum. The previously found, linear-in-spin terms\nmodify the odd-parity sector of the metric, while the new corrections appear in\nthe even-parity sector. These corrections modify the quadrupole moment, as well\nas the (coordinate-dependent) location of the event horizon and the ergoregion.\nAlthough the linear-in-spin metric is of Petrov type D, the quadratic order\nterms render it of type I. The metric does not possess a second-order Killing\ntensor or a Carter-like constant. The new metric does not possess closed\ntimelike curves or spacetime regions that violate causality outside of the\nevent horizon. The new, even-parity modifications to the Kerr metric decay less\nrapidly at spatial infinity than the leading-order in spin, odd-parity ones,\nand thus, the former are more important when considering black holes that are\nrotating moderately fast. We calculate the modifications to the Hamiltonian,\nbinding energy and Kepler's third law. These modifications are crucial for the\nconstruction of gravitational wave templates for black hole binaries, which\nwill enter at second post-Newtonian order, just like dissipative modifications\nfound previously.\n", "  We provide a systematic account of integrability of the spherical mechanics\nassociated with the near horizon extremal Myers-Perry black hole in arbitrary\ndimension for the special case that all rotation parameters are equal. The\nintegrability is established both in the original coordinates and in\naction-angle variables. It is demonstrated that the spherical mechanics\nassociated with the black hole in d=2n+1 is maximally superintegrable, while\nits counterpart related to the black hole in d=2n lacks for only one integral\nof motion to be maximally superintegrable.\n", "  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute analytically the late-time\nbehavior of two-point functions, Wilson loops and entanglement entropy in a\nstrongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills plasma undergoing a\nboost-invariant expansion. We take into account the effects of first order\ndissipative hydrodynamics and investigate the effects of the (time-dependent)\nshear viscosity on the various observables. The two-point functions decay\nexponentially at late times and are unaffected by the viscosity if the points\nare separated along the transverse directions. For longitudinal separation we\nfind a much richer structure. In this case the exponential is modulated by a\nnonmonotonic function of the rapidities and a dimensionless combination of the\nshear viscosity and proper time. We show that this peculiar behavior constrains\nthe regime of validity of the hydrodynamical expansion. In addition, similar\nresults are found for certain Wilson loops and entanglement entropies.\n", "  Many real-world complex systems are best modeled by multiplex networks. The\nmultiplexity has proved to have broad impact on the system's structure and\nfunction. Most theoretical studies on multiplex networks to date, however, have\nlargely ignored the effect of link overlap across layers despite strong\nempirical evidences for its significance. In this article, we investigate the\neffect of link overlap in the viability of multiplex networks, both\nanalytically and numerically. Distinctive role of overlapping links in\nviability and mutual connectivity is emphasized and exploited for setting up\nproper analytic framework. A rich phase diagram for viability is obtained and\ngreatly diversified patterns of hysteretic behavior in viability are observed\nin the presence of link overlap. Mutual percolation with link overlap is\nrevisited as a limit of multiplex viability problem, and controversy between\nexisting results is clarified. The distinctive role of overlapping links is\nfurther demonstrated by the different responses of networks under random\nremovals of overlapping and non-overlapping links, respectively, as well as\nunder several removal strategies. Our results show that the link overlap\nstrongly facilitates viability and mutual percolation; at the same time, the\npresence of link overlap poses challenge in analytical approach to the problem.\n", "  We show explicitly how a strongly coupled fixed point can be constructed in\nscalar $g\\varphi^4$ theory from the solutions to a non-linear eigenvalue\nproblem. The fixed point exists only for $d< 4$, is unstable and characterized\nby $\\nu=2/d$ (correlation length exponent), $\\eta=1/2-d/8$ (anomalous\ndimension). For $d=2$, these exponents reproduce to those of the Ising model\nwhich can be understood from the codimension of the critical point. At this\nfixed point, $\\varphi^{2i}$ terms with $i>2$ are all irrelevant. The testable\nprediction of this fixed point is that the specific heat exponent vanishes. 2d\ncritical Mott systems are well described by this new fixed point.\n", "  Recently, entanglement concentration was explicitly shown to be irreversible.\nHowever, it is still not clear what kind of states can be reversibly converted\nin the asymptotic setting by LOCC when neither the initial nor the target state\nis maximally entangled. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe reversibility of LOCC conversions between two bipartite pure entangled\nstates in the asymptotic setting. In addition, we show that conversion can be\nachieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition\nexcept for special cases. Interestingly, our result implies that an error-free\nreversible conversion is asymptotically possible even between states whose\ncopies can never be locally unitarily equivalent with any finite numbers of\ncopies, although such a conversion is impossible in the finite setting. In\nfact, we show such an example. Moreover, we establish how to overcome the\nirreversibility of LOCC conversion in two ways. As for the first method, we\nevaluate how many copies of the initial state is to be lost to overcome the\nirreversibility of LOCC conversion. The second method is to add a supplementary\nstate appropriately, which also works for LU conversion unlike the first\nmethod. Especially, for the qubit system, any non-maximally pure entangled\nstate can be a universal resource for the asymptotic reversibility when copies\nof the state is sufficiently many. More interestingly, our analysis implies\nthat far-from-maximally entangled states can be better than nearly maximally\nentangled states as this type of resource. This fact brings new insight to the\nresource theory of state conversion.\n", "  In clouds of suspended particles (grains, droplets, spheres, crystals, etc.),\ncollisions electrify the particles and the clouds, producing large electric\npotential differences over large scales. This is seen most spectacularly in the\natmosphere as lighting in thunderstorms, thundersnow, dust storms, and volcanic\nash plumes where multi-million-volt potential differences over scales of\nkilometers can be produced, but it is a general phenomenon in granular systems\nas a whole. The electrification process is not well understood, especially for\nelectrification of insulating particles of the same material. To investigate\nthe relative importances of particle properties (material, size, etc.) and\ncollective phenomena (behaviors of systems at large scales not easily predicted\nfrom local dynamics) in granular and atmospheric electrification, we used a\ntable-top experiment that mechanically shakes particles inside a cell where we\nmeasure the macroscopic electric field between the electrically conducting end\nplates. The measured electric fields are a result of capacitive coupling and\ndirect charge transfer between the particles and the plates. Using a diverse\nrange of mono-material particle sets (plastics, ceramic, glass, and metals), we\nfound that all our particle materials electrify and show similar dynamics with\nlong time-scale temporal variation and an electric field amplitude that depends\non the particle quantity in a complex way. These results suggest that while\nparticle properties do matter like previous investigations have shown,\nmacroscopic electrification of solids is relatively material agnostic and large\nscale collective phenomena play a major role.\n", "  These notes are based on lectures at the PSSCMP/PiTP summer school that was\nheld at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study in July,\n2015. They are devoted largely to topological phases of matter that can be\nunderstood in terms of free fermions and band theory. They also contain an\nintroduction to the fractional quantum Hall effect from the point of view of\neffective field theory.\n", "  The Josephson effect describes supercurrent flowing through a junction\nconnecting two superconducting leads by a thin barrier [1]. This current is\ndriven by a superconducting phase difference $\\phi$ between the leads. In the\npresence of chiral and time reversal symmetry of the Cooper pair tunneling\nprocess [2] the current is strictly zero when $\\phi$ vanishes. Only if these\nunderlying symmetries are broken the supercurrent for $\\phi=0$ may be finite\n[3-5]. This corresponds to a ground state of the junction being offset by a\nphase $\\phi_{0}$, different from 0 or $\\pi$. Here, we report such a Josephson\n$\\phi_{0}$-junction based on a nanowire quantum dot. We use a quantum\ninterferometer device in order to investigate phase offsets and demonstrate\nthat $\\phi_{0}$ can be controlled by electrostatic gating. Our results have\npossible far reaching implications for superconducting flux and phase defined\nquantum bits as well as for exploring topological superconductivity in quantum\ndot systems.\n", "  XUV nonlinear spectroscopy has recently discovered that there is more than\none collective dipole resonance state in the energy range of the giant dipole\nresonance (GDR) of atomic Xe. This resonance-state substructure, hidden in the\nlinear regime, raises imminent questions regarding our understanding of the\ncollective electronic behavior of Xe, which has been largely founded on linear\nspectroscopic studies. Here, we approach the collective response of Xe from a\nnew perspective: we study directly the resonance eigenstates, and then analyze\ntheir spectroscopic manifestations. We find that linear spectroscopy captures\nonly partial information on the resonance substructure as a result of quantum\ninterferences. Moreover, we show that the resonance state dominating the GDR in\nlinear spectroscopy has no adiabatic connection to the resonance state\ngoverning the corresponding cross section when multielectron interactions are\nneglected. Going beyond the dipole-allowed correlated electronic structure, we\npredict the existence of collective multipole resonances of Xe. Unlike any\nknown collective feature in atoms, these resonances live exceptionally long\n(more than 100 attoseconds), thus providing a new playground for studying the\ncollective nonlinear response of Xe using advanced light sources.\n", "  In this article, we study the emergence of polarization singularities in the\nscattered fields of optical resonators excited by linearly polarized plane\nwaves. First, we prove analytically that combinations of isotropic electric and\nmagnetic dipoles can sustain L surfaces, and C lines that propagate from the\nnear-field to the far field. Moreover, based on these analytical results, we\nderive anomalous scattering Kerker conditions trough singular optics arguments.\nSecondly, through exact full-field calculations, we demonstrate that high\nrefractive index spherical resonators present such topologically protected\nfeatures. Furthermore, we calculate the polarization structure of light around\nthe generated C lines, unveiling a M\\\"obius strip structure in the main axis of\nthe polarization ellipse. These results prove that high-index nanoparticles are\nexcellent candidates for the generation and control of polarization\nsingularities and that they may lead to new platforms for the experimental\nstudy of the topology of light fields around optical antennas.\n", "  We study effects of different configurations of adsorbates on the vibrational\nmodes as well as symmetries of polyacenes and poly-p-phenylenes focusing on\nlithium atom adsorption. We found that the spectra of the vibrational modes\ndistinguish the different configurations. For more regular adsorption schemes\nthe lowest states are bending and torsion modes of the skeleton, which are\nessentially followed by the adsorbate. On poly-p-phenylenes we found that\nlithium adsorption reduces and often eliminates the torsion between rings thus\nincreasing symmetry. There is spontaneous symmetry breaking in\npoly-p-phenylenes due to double adsorption of lithium atoms on alternating\nrings.\n", "  Biologically important membrane channels are gated by force at attached\ntethers. Here, we generically characterize the non-trivial interplay of force,\nmembrane tension, and channel deformations that can affect gating. A central\nfinding is that minute conical channel deformation under force leads to\nsignificant energy release during opening. We also calculate channel-channel\ninteractions and show that they can amplify force sensitivity of tethered\nchannels.\n", "  We exploit the key concepts of the augmented version of superfield approach\nto Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism to derive the superspace (SUSP)\ndual unitary operator (and its Hermitian conjugate) and demonstrate their\nutility in the derivation of the nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting\n(anti-)dual BRST symmetry transformations for a set of interesting models of\nthe Abelian 1-form gauge theories. These models are the one (0+1)-dimensional\n(1D) rigid rotor, modified versions of the two (1+1)-dimensional (2D) Proca as\nwell as anomalous gauge theories and 2D model of a self-dual bosonic field\ntheory. We show the universality of the SUSP dual unitary operator and its\nHermitian conjugate in the cases of all the Abelian models under consideration.\nThese SUSP dual unitary operators, besides maintaining the explicit group\nstructure, provide the alternatives to the dual-horizontality condition (DHC)\nand dual-gauge invariant restrictions (DGIRs) of the superfield formalism. The\nderivation of the dual unitary operators and corresponding (anti-)dual BRST\nsymmetries are completely novel results in our present investigation.\n", "  From field-angle dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy on single crystals\nof La(O,F)BiSeS, which belongs to the recently discovered BiCh 2 (Ch = S, Se)\nbased layered superconductors, we found that the superconductivity in\nLa(O,F)BiSeS is highly anisotropic. We measured a superconducting energy gap of\n0.61 meV for current injected along c-axis at 1.5 K. Detailed temperature and\nmagnetic field dependent studies of the gap also reveal the presence of\nunconventional pairing in La(O,F)BiSeS. We show that the observed anisotropic\nsuperconducting properties can be attributed to the anisotropy in the\nsuperconducting order parameter with a complex symmetry in superconducting\nLa(O,F)BiSeS.\n", "  In periodic systems, electronic wave functions of the eigenstates exhibit the\nperiodically modulated Bloch phases and are characterized by their wave numbers\n${\\bf k}$. We theoretically address the effects of the Bloch phase in general\nlayered materials with stacking shift. When the interlayer shift and the Bloch\nwave vector ${\\bf k}$ satisfy certain conditions, interlayer transitions of\nelectrons are prohibited by the interference of the Bloch phase. We specify the\nmanifolds in the ${\\bf k}$ space where the hybridization of the Bloch states\nbetween the layers is suppressed in accord with the stacking shift. These\nmanifolds, named stacking-adapted interference manifolds (SAIM), are obviously\napplicable to general layered materials regardless of detailed atomic\nconfiguration within the unit cell. We demonstrate the robustness and\nusefulness of the SAIM with first-principles calculations for layered boron\nnitride, transition-metal dichalcogenide, graphite, and black phosphorus. We\nalso apply the SAIM to general three-dimensional crystals to derive special\n${\\bf k}$-point paths for the respective Bravais lattices, along which the\nBloch-phase interference strongly suppresses the band dispersion. Our theory\nprovides a general and novel view on the anisotropic electronic kinetics\nintrinsic to the periodic-lattice structure.\n", "  Many dynamical models of the Milky Way halo require assumptions that the\ndistribution function of a tracer population should be independent of time\n(i.e., a steady state distribution function) and that the underlying potential\nis spherical. We study the limitations of such modelling by applying a general\ndynamical model with minimal assumptions to a large sample of galactic haloes\nfrom cosmological $N$-body and hydrodynamical simulations. Using dark matter\nparticles as dynamical tracers, we find that the systematic uncertainties in\nthe measured mass and concentration parameters typically have an amplitude of\n25% to 40%. When stars are used as tracers, however, the systematic\nuncertainties can be as large as a factor of $2-3$. The systematic\nuncertainties are not reduced by increasing the tracer sample size and vary\nstochastically from halo to halo. These systematic uncertainties are mostly\ndriven by underestimated statistical noise caused by correlated phase-space\nstructures that violate the steady state assumption. The number of independent\nphase-space structures inferred from the uncertainty level sets a limiting\nsample size beyond which a further increase no longer significantly improves\nthe accuracy of dynamical inferences. The systematic uncertainty level is\ndetermined by the halo merger history, the shape and environment of the halo.\nOur conclusions apply generally to any spherical steady-state model.\n", "  Massive black holes (BHs) inhabit local galaxies, including the Milky Way and\nsome dwarf galaxies. BH formation, occurring at early cosmic times, must\naccount for the properties of BHs in today's galaxies, notably why some\ngalaxies host a BH, and others do not. We investigate the formation,\ndistribution and growth of BH `seeds' by using the adaptive mesh refinement\ncode Ramses. We develop an implementation of BH formation in dense,\nlow-metallicity environments, as advocated by models invoking the collapse of\nthe first generation of stars, or of dense nuclear star clusters. The seed\nmasses are computed one-by-one on-the-fly, based on the star formation rate and\nthe stellar initial mass function. This self-consistent method to seed BHs\nallows us to study the distribution of BHs in a cosmological context and their\nevolution over cosmic time. We find that all high-mass galaxies tend to a host\na BH, whereas low-mass counterparts have a lower probability of hosting a BH.\nAfter the end of the epoch of BH formation, this probability is modulated by\nthe growth of the galaxy. The simulated BHs connect to low-redshift\nobservational samples, and span a similar range in accretion properties as\nLyman-Break Analogs. The growth of BHs in low-mass galaxies is stunted by\nstrong supernova feedback. The properties of BHs in dwarf galaxies thus remain\na testbed for BH formation. Simulations with strong supernova feedback, which\nis able to quench BH accretion in shallow potential wells, produce galaxies and\nBHs in better agreement with observational constraints.\n", "  Bismuth Selenide (Bi2Se3) is a topological insulator with a two-dimensional\nlayered structure that enables clean and well-ordered surfaces to be prepared\nby cleaving. Although some studies have demonstrated that the cleaved surface\nis terminated with Se, as expected from the bulk crystal structure, other\nreports have indicated either a Bi- or mixed-termination. Low energy ion\nscattering (LEIS), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used here to compare surfaces prepared by\nex situ cleaving, in situ cleaving, and ion bombardment and annealing (IBA) in\nultra-high vacuum (UHV). Surfaces prepared by in situ cleaving and IBA are well\nordered and Se-terminated. Ex situ cleaved samples could be either\nSe-terminated or Bi-rich, are less well ordered and have adsorbed contaminants.\nThis suggests that a chemical reaction involving atmospheric contaminants,\nwhich may preferentially adsorb at surface defects, could contribute to the\nnon-reproducibility of the termination.\n", "  Bismuth Selenide is a two-dimensional topological insulator material composed\nof stacked quintuple layers (QL). The layers are held together by a weak van\nder Waals force that enables surface preparation by cleaving. Low energy ion\nscattering experiments (LEIS) show that Bi2Se3 cleaved under ultra-high vacuum\n(UHV) has a Se-terminated structure that is consistent with cleaving between\nQLs. Comparison of experimental data to molecular dynamics simulations confirms\nthe Se-termination and provides an estimate of the surface relaxation.\n", "  The reference chiral helimagnet MnSi is the first system where skyrmion\nlattice correlations have been reported. At zero magnetic field the transition\nat $T_C$ to the helimagnetic state is of first order. Above $T_C$, in a region\ndominated by precursor phenomena, neutron scattering shows the build up of\nstrong chiral fluctuating correlations over the surface of a sphere with radius\n$2\\pi/\\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the pitch of the helix. It has been suggested that\nthese fluctuating correlations drive the helical transition to first order\nfollowing a scenario proposed by Brazovskii for liquid crystals. We present a\ncomprehensive neutron scattering study under magnetic fields, which provides\nevidence that this is not the case. The sharp first order transition persists\nfor magnetic fields up to 0.4 T whereas the fluctuating correlations weaken and\nstart to concentrate along the field direction already above 0.2 T. Our results\nthus disconnect the first order nature of the transition from the precursor\nfluctuating correlations. They also show no indication for a tricritical point,\nwhere the first order transition crosses over to second order with increasing\nmagnetic field. In this light, the nature of the first order helical transition\nand the precursor phenomena above $T_C$, both of general relevance to chiral\nmagnetism, remain an open question.\n", "  At small momenta, the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) mode in the fractional\nquantum Hall (FQH) effect can be identified with gapped nematic fluctuations in\nthe isotropic FQH liquid. This correspondence would be exact as the GMP mode\nsoftens upon approach to the putative point of a quantum phase transition to a\nFQH nematic. Motivated by these considerations as well as by suggestive\nevidence of an FQH nematic in tilted field experiments, we have sought evidence\nof such a nematic FQHE in a microscopic model of interacting electrons in the\nlowest Landau level at filling factor 1/3. Using a family of anisotropic\nLaughlin states as trial wave functions, we find a continuous quantum phase\ntransition between the isotropic Laughlin liquid and the FQH nematic. Results\nof numerical exact diagonalization also suggest that rotational symmetry is\nspontaneously broken, and that the phase diagram of the model contains both a\nnematic and a stripe phase.\n", "  The rich phenomena of deformations in neutron-deficient krypton isotopes such\nas the shape evolution with neutron number and the shape coexistence attract\nthe interests of nuclear physicists for decades. It will be interesting to\nstudy such shape phenomena using a novel way, i.e., by thermally exciting the\nnucleus. So in this work, we develop the finite temperature covariant density\nfunctional theory for axially deformed nuclei with the treatment of pairing\ncorrelations by BCS approach, and apply this approach for the study of shape\nevolutions in $^{72,74}$Kr with increasing temperatures. For $^{72}$Kr, with\ntemperature increasing, the nucleus firstly experiences a relatively quick\nweakening in oblate deformation at temperature $T \\sim0.9$ MeV, and then\nchanges from oblate to spherical at $T \\sim2.1$ MeV. For $^{74}$Kr, its global\nminimum locates at quadroupole deformation $\\beta_2 \\sim -0.14$ and abruptly\nchanges to spherical at $T\\sim 1.7$ MeV. The proton pairing transition occurs\nat critical temperature 0.6 MeV following the rule $T_c =0.6 \\Delta_p (0)$\nwhere $\\Delta_p(0)$ is the proton pairing gap at zero temperature. The\nsignatures of the above pairing transition and shape changes can be found in\nthe curve of the specific heat. The single-particle level evolutions with the\ntemperature are presented.\n", "  Adiabatic quantum state evolution can be accelerated through a variety of\nshortcuts to adiabaticity. In one approach, a counterdiabatic quantum\nHamiltonian $\\hat H_{CD}$ is constructed to suppress nonadiabatic excitations.\nIn the analogous classical problem, a counterdiabatic classical Hamiltonian\n$H_{CD}$ ensures that the classical action remains constant even under rapid\ndriving. Both the quantum and classical versions of this problem have been\nsolved for the special case of scale-invariant driving, characterized by linear\nexpansions, contractions or translations of the system. Here we investigate an\nexample of a non-scale-invariant system -- a tilted piston. We solve exactly\nfor the classical counterdiabatic Hamiltonian $H_{CD}(q,p,t)$, which we then\nquantize to obtain a Hermitian operator $\\hat H_{CD}(t)$. Using numerical\nsimulations, we find that $\\hat H_{CD}$ effectively suppresses non-adiabatic\nexcitations under rapid driving. These results offer a proof of principle --\nbeyond the special case of scale-invariant driving -- that quantum shortcuts to\nadiabaticity can successfully be constructed from their classical counterparts.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of strongly localized systems subject to dephasing\nnoise with arbitrary correlation time. Although noise inevitably induces\ndelocalization, transport in the noise-induced delocalized phase is\nsubdiffusive in a parametrically large intermediate-time window. We argue for\nthis intermediate-time subdiffusive regime both analytically and using\nnumerical simulations on single-particle localized systems. Furthermore, we\nshow that normal diffusion is restored in the long-time limit, through\nprocesses analogous to variable-range hopping. With numerical simulations based\non Lanczos exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that our qualitative\nconclusions are also valid for interacting systems in the many-body localized\nphase.\n", "  Electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays (charm and beauty) were measured\nwith the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass of energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$)\ndifferential production yields at mid-rapidity were used to calculate the\nnuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$ in the interval $3<p_{\\rm T}< 18$\nGeV/$c$. The $R_{\\rm AA}$ shows a strong suppression compared to binary scaling\nof pp collisions at the same energy (up to a factor of 4) in the 10% most\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions. There is a centrality trend of suppression, and a\nweaker suppression (down to a factor of 2) in semi-peripheral (50-80%)\ncollisions is observed. The suppression of electrons in this broad $p_{\\rm T}$\ninterval indicates that both charm and beauty quarks lose energy when they\ntraverse the hot medium formed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC.\n", "  Wet particle separation is widely used in mineral processing and plastic\nrecycling to separate mixtures of particulate materials into further usable\nfractions due to density differences. This work presents efforts aiming to\nnumerically analyze the wet separation of particles with different densities.\nIn the current study the discrete element method (DEM) is used for the solid\nphase while the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is used for modeling of\nthe liquid phase. The two phases are coupled by the use of a volume averaging\ntechnique. In the current study, simulations of spherical particle separation\nwere performed. In these simulations, a set of generated particles with two\ndifferent densities is dropped into a rectangular container filled with liquid.\nThe results of simulations with two different mixtures of particles\ndemonstrated how separation depends on the densities of particles.\n", "  A collision of a light meson and a charmonium produces quarks and antiquarks\nfirst, then the charm quark fragments into a charmed hadron, and finally three\nor more mesons are produced. This is the mechanism that we consider and propose\nto understand the prompt-J/psi nuclear modification factor in the range of\nJ/psi transverse momentum from 10 GeV/c to 18 GeV/c, as measured by the CMS\nCollaboration and the ATLAS Collaboration. Unpolarized cross sections are\nderived and calculated for the reactions pion+charmonium ->H_c+X with H_c being\na charmed meson. Numerical cross sections are parametrized and used to\ncalculate the dissociation rate of charmonium in the interaction with pions in\nhadronic matter. The momentum dependence of the rate obtained is so as to lead\nto a decreasing charmonium nuclear modification factor with increasing\ntransverse momentum.\n", "  We study how the entanglement spectrum relaxes to its steady state in\none-dimensional quadratic systems after a quantum quench. In particular we\napply the saddle point expansion to the dimerized chains and 1-D p-wave\nsuperconductors. We find that the entanglement spectrum always exhibits a\npower-law relaxation superimposed with oscillations at certain characteristic\nangular frequencies. For the dimerized chains, we find that the exponent $\\nu$\nof the power-law decay is always $3/2$. For 1-D p-wave superconductors,\nhowever, we find that depending on the initial and final Hamiltonian, the\nexponent $\\nu$ can take value from a limited list of values. The smallest\npossible value is $\\nu=1/2$, which leads to a very slow convergence to its\nsteady state value.\n", "  Performing the Hamiltonian analysis we explicitly established the canonical\nequivalence of the deformed oscillator, constructed in\narXiv:1607.03756[hep-th], with the ordinary one. As an immediate consequence,\nwe proved that the SU(1,2) symmetry is the dynamical symmetry of the ordinary\ntwo-dimensional oscillator. The characteristic feature of this SU(1,2) symmetry\nis a non-polynomial structure of its generators written it terms of the\noscillator variables.\n", "  Green Peas are nearby analogs of high-redshift Ly$\\alpha$-emitting galaxies.\nTo probe their Ly$\\alpha$ escape, we study the spatial profiles of Ly$\\alpha$\nand UV continuum emission of 24 Green Pea galaxies using the Cosmic Origins\nSpectrograph (COS) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We extract the spatial\nprofiles of Ly$\\alpha$ emission from their 2D COS spectra, and of UV continuum\nfrom both the 2D spectra and NUV images. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission shows more\nextended spatial profiles than the UV continuum in most Green Peas. The\ndeconvolved Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Ly$\\alpha$ spatial profile is\nabout 2 to 4 times that of the UV continuum in most cases. Since Green Peas are\nanalogs of high-z LAEs, it suggests that most high-z LAEs likely have larger\nLy$\\alpha$ sizes than UV sizes. We also compare the spatial profiles of\nLy$\\alpha$ photons at blueshifted and redshifted velocities in eight Green Peas\nwith sufficient data quality, and find the blue wing of the Ly$\\alpha$ line has\na larger spatial extent than the red wing in four Green Peas with comparatively\nweak blue Ly$\\alpha$ line wings. We show that Green Peas and MUSE $z=3-6$ LAEs\nhave similar Ly$\\alpha$ and UV continuum sizes, which probably suggests\nstarbursts in both low-z and high-z LAEs drive similar gas outflows illuminated\nby Ly$\\alpha$ light. Five Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers in this sample have\nsimilar Ly$\\alpha$ to UV continuum size ratios (~1.4-4.3) to the other Green\nPeas, indicating their LyC emission escape through ionized holes in the\ninterstellar medium.\n", "  We use surface tension to distinguish between phases with isotropic internal\nstructure from phases which are microscopically anisotropic. There are many\ninteresting open problems, especially in two dimensions, and in phase\ncoexistence.\n", "  Energy loss due to ohmic heating is a major bottleneck limiting down-scaling\nand speed of nano-electronic devices, and harvesting ohmic heat for signal\nprocessing is a major challenge in modern electronics. Here we demonstrate that\nthermal gradients arising from ohmic heating can be utilized for excitation of\ncoherent auto-oscillations of magnetization and for generation of tunable\nmicrowave signals. The heat-driven dynamics is observed in\n$\\mathrm{Y_{3}Fe_{5}O_{12}/Pt}$ bilayer nanowires where ohmic heating of the Pt\nlayer results in injection of pure spin current into the\n$\\mathrm{Y_{3}Fe_{5}O_{12}}$ layer. This leads to excitation of\nauto-oscillations of the $\\mathrm{Y_{3}Fe_{5}O_{12}}$ magnetization and\ngeneration of coherent microwave radiation. Our work paves the way towards spin\ncaloritronic devices for microwave and magnonic applications.\n", "  Szegedy's quantum walk is a quantization of a classical random walk or Markov\nchain, where the walk occurs on the edges of the bipartite double cover of the\noriginal graph. To search, one can simply quantize a Markov chain with\nabsorbing vertices. Recently, Santos proposed two alternative search algorithms\nthat instead utilize the sign-flip oracle in Grover's algorithm rather than\nabsorbing vertices. In this paper, we show that these two algorithms are\nexactly equivalent to two algorithms involving coined quantum walks, which are\nwalks on the vertices of the original graph with an internal degree of freedom.\nThe first scheme is equivalent to a coined quantum walk with one walk-step per\nquery of Grover's oracle, and the second is equivalent to a coined quantum walk\nwith two walk-steps per query of Grover's oracle. These equivalences lie\noutside the previously known equivalence of Szegedy's quantum walk with\nabsorbing vertices and the coined quantum walk with the negative identity\noperator as the coin for marked vertices, whose precise relationships we also\ninvestigate.\n", "  In this work, we study active particles with prescribed surface velocities in\nnon-Newtonian fluids. We employ the reciprocal theorem to obtain the velocity\nof an active spherical particle with an arbitrary axisymmetric slip-velocity in\nan otherwise quiescent second-order fluid. We then determine how the motion of\na diffusiophoretic Janus particle is affected by complex fluid rheology, namely\nviscoelasticity and shear-thinning viscosity, compared to a Newtonian fluid,\nassuming a fixed slip-velocity. We find that a Janus particle may go faster or\nslower in a viscoelastic fluid, but is always slower in a shear-thinning fluid\nas compared to a Newtonian fluid.\n", "  The widely debated feasibility of thermodynamic machines achieving Carnot\nefficiency at finite power has been convincingly dismissed. Yet, the common\nwisdom that efficiency can only be optimal in the limit of infinitely-slow\nprocesses overlooks the dual scenario of infinitely-fast processes. We\ncorroborate that efficient engines at divergent power output are not\ntheoretically impossible, framing our claims within the theory of Stochastic\nThermodynamics. We inspect the case of an electronic quantum dot coupled to\nthree particle reservoirs to illustrate the physical rationale.\n", "  Current models for opinion dynamics typically utilize a Poisson process for\nspeaker selection, making the waiting time between events exponentially\ndistributed. Human interaction tends to be bursty, though, having higher\nprobabilities of either extremely short waiting times or long periods of\nsilence. To quantify the burstiness effects on the dynamics of social models,\nwe place in competition two groups exhibiting different speakers' waiting-time\ndistributions. These competitions are implemented in the binary Naming Game,\nand show that the relevant aspect of the waiting-time distribution is the\ndensity of the head rather than that of the tail. We show that even with\nidentical mean waiting times, a group with a higher density of short waiting\ntimes is favored in competition over the other group. This effect remains in\nthe presence of nodes holding a single opinion that never changes, as the\nfraction of such committed individuals necessary for achieving consensus\ndecreases dramatically when they have a higher head density than the holders of\nthe competing opinion. Finally, to quantify differences in burstiness, we\nintroduce the expected number of small-time activations and use it to\ncharacterize the early-time regime of the system.\n", "  We argue that an LHC measurement of some simple quantities related to the\nratio of rates of e+mu- to e-mu+ events is surprisingly sensitive to as-yet\nunexcluded R-parity violating supersymmetric models with non-zero lambda-prime\n231 couplings. The search relies upon the approximate lepton universality in\nthe Standard Model, the sign of the charge of the proton, and a collection of\nfavourable detector biases. The proposed search is unusual because: it does not\nrequire any of the displaced vertices, hadronic neutralino decay products, or\nsquark/gluino production relied upon by existing LHC RPV searches; it could\nwork in cases in which the only light sparticles were smuons and neutralinos;\nand it could make a discovery (though not necessarily with optimal\nsignificance) without requiring the computation of a leading-order Monte Carlo\nestimate of any background rate. The LHC has shown no strong hints of\npost-Higgs physics and so precision Standard Model measurements are becoming\never more important. We argue that in this environment growing profits are to\nbe made from searches that place detector biases and symmetries of the Standard\nModel at their core - searches based around `controls' rather than around\nsignals.\n", "  Metal oxides such as VO$_2$ undergo structural transitions to low-symmetry\nphases characterized by intricate crystalline order, accompanied by rich\nelectronic behavior. We derive a minimal ionic Hamiltonian based on symmetry\nand local energetics which describes structural transitions involving all four\nobserved phases, in the correct order. An exact analysis shows that complexity\nresults from the symmetry-induced constraints of the parent phase which forces\nionic displacements to form multiple interpenetrating groups using\nlow-dimensional pathways and distant neighbors. Displacements within each group\nexhibit independent, quasi two-dimensional order, which is frustrated and\nfragile. This selective ordering mechanism is not restricted to VO$_2$: it\napplies to other oxides which show similar complex order.\n", "  In this work, we study optical self-focusing that leads to collapse events\nfor the time-independent model of co-propagating beams with different\nwavelengths. We show that collapse events depend on the combined critical power\nof two beams for both fundamental, vortex and mixed configurations as well as\non the ratio of their individual powers.\n", "  A study of single top quark production via flavor changing neutral current\ninteractions at $tq\\gamma$ vertices is performed at future circular hadron\nelectron collider. The signal cross sections for the processes $e^{-}p\\to\ne^{-}W^{\\pm}q+X$ and $e^{-}p\\to e^{-}W^{\\pm}bq+X$ in the collision of electron\nbeam with energy $E_e=$ 60 GeV and proton beam with energy $E_p=$ 50 TeV are\ncalculated. In the analysis, the invariant mass distributions of three jets\nreconstructing top quark mass, requiring one b-tagged jet and other two jets\nreconstructing the $W$ mass are used to count signal and background events\nafter all selection cuts. The upper limits on the anomalous flavor changing\nneutral current $tq\\gamma$ couplings are found to be $\\lambda_q < $ 0.01 at\nfuture circular hadron electron collider for $L_{int}=100$ fb$^{-1}$ with the\nfast simulation of detector effects. Signal significance depending on the\ncouplings $\\lambda_q$ is analyzed and an enhanced sensitivity is found to the\nbranching ratio BR($t\\to q\\gamma$) at the future circular hadron electron\ncollider when compared to the current experimental results.\n", "  Schr\\\"odinger equation for an electron confined to a two-dimensional strip is\nconsidered in the presence of homogeneous orthogonal magnetic field. Since the\nsystem has edges, the eigenvalue problem is supplied by the boundary conditions\n(BC) aimed in preventing the leakage of matter away across the edges. In the\ncase of spinless electrons the Dirichlet and Neumann BC are considered. The\nDirichlet BC result in the existence of charge carrying edge states. For the\nNeumann BC each separate edge comprises two counterflow sub-currents which\nprecisely cancel out each other provided the system is populated by electrons\nup to certain Fermi level. Cancelation of electric current is a good starting\npoint for developing the spin-effects. In this scope we reconsider the problem\nfor a spinning electron with Rashba coupling. The Neumann BC are replaced by\nRobin BC. Again, the two counterflow electric sub-currents cancel out each\nother for a separate edge, while the spin current survives thus modeling what\nis known as pure spin current -- spin flow without charge flow.\n", "  In this paper we continue studying the modification of the axial charge in\nchiral media by macroscopic helicities. Recently it was shown that magnetic\nreconnections result in a persistent current of zero mode along flux tubes.\nHere we argue that in general a change in the helical part of the generalized\naxial charge results in the same phenomenon. Thus one may say that there is a\nnovel realization of chiral effects requiring no initial chiral asymmetry. The\ntransfer of flow helicity to zero modes is analyzed in a toy model based on a\nvortex reconnection in a chiral superfluid. Then, we discuss the balance\nbetween the two competing processes effect of reconnections and the chiral\ninstability on the example of magnetic helicity. We argue that in the general\ncase there is a possibility for the distribution of the axial charge between\nthe magnetic and fermionic forms at the end of the instability.\n", "  We study the ultralight axion dark matter with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV in\n$f(R)$ gravity which might resolve the dark energy problem. In particular, we\nfocus on the fact that the pressure of the axion field oscillating in time\nproduces oscillations of gravitational potentials. We show that the oscillation\nof the gravitational potential is sensitive to the model of gravity.\nRemarkably, we find that the detectability of the oscillation through the\ngravitational wave detectors can be significantly enhanced due to the nonlinear\nresonance between the ultralight axion and the scalaron.\n", "  In various applications one is interested in quantum dynamics at intermediate\nevolution times, for which the adiabatic approximation is inadequate. Here we\ndevelop a quasi-adiabatic approximation based on the WKB method, designed to\nwork for such intermediate evolution times. We apply it to the problem of a\nsingle qubit in a time-varying magnetic field, and to the Hamiltonian Grover\nsearch problem, and show that already at first order, the quasi-adiabatic WKB\ncaptures subtle features of the dynamics that are missed by the adiabatic\napproximation. However, we also find that the method is sensitive to the type\nof interpolation schedule used in the Grover problem, and can give rise to\nnonsensical results for the wrong schedule, due to loss of normalization.\nConversely, it reproduces the quadratic Grover speedup when the well-known\noptimal schedule is used.\n", "  Motivated by the redrawing of hot glass into thin sheets, we investigate the\nshape and stability of a thin viscous sheet that is inhomogeneously stretched\nin an imposed non-uniform temperature field. We first determine the associated\nbase flow by solving the long-timescale stretching flow of a flat sheet as a\nfunction of two dimensionless parameters: the normalized stretching velocity\n$\\alpha$, and a dimensionless width of the heating zone $\\beta$. This allows us\nto determine the conditions for the onset of an out-of-plane wrinkling\ninstability stated in terms of an eigenvalue problem for a linear partial\ndifferential equation governing the displacement of the midsurface of the\nsheet. We show the sheet can become unstable in two regions that are upstream\nand downstream of the heating zone where the minimum in-plane stress is\nnegative. This yields the shape and growth rates of the most unstable buckling\nmode in both regions for various values of the stretching velocity and heating\nzone width. A transition from stationary to oscillatory unstable modes is found\nin the upstream region with increasing $\\beta$ while the downstream region is\nalways stationary. We show that the wrinkling instability can be entirely\nsuppressed when the surface tension is large enough relative to the magnitude\nof the in-plane stress. Finally, we present an operating diagram that indicates\nregions of the parameter space that result in a required outlet sheet thickness\nupon stretching, while simultaneously minimizing or suppressing the\nout-of-plane buckling; a result that is relevant for the glass redraw method\nused to create ultrathin glass sheets.\n", "  We study symmetric motifs in random geometric graphs. Symmetric motifs are\nsubsets of nodes which have the same adjacencies. These subgraphs are\nparticularly prevalent in random geometric graphs and appear in the Laplacian\nand adjacency spectrum as sharp, distinct peaks, a feature often found in\nreal-world networks. We look at the probabilities of their appearance and\ncompare these across parameter space and dimension. We then use the Chen-Stein\nmethod to derive the minimum separation distance in random geometric graphs\nwhich we apply to study symmetric motifs in both the intensive and\nthermodynamic limits. In the thermodynamic limit the probability that the\nclosest nodes are symmetric approaches one, whilst in the intensive limit this\nprobability depends upon the dimension.\n", "  Adiabatic quantum computing has evolved in recent years from a theoretical\nfield into an immensely practical area, a change partially sparked by D-Wave\nSystem's quantum annealing hardware. These multimillion-dollar quantum\nannealers offer the potential to solve optimization problems millions of times\nfaster than classical heuristics, prompting researchers at Google, NASA and\nLockheed Martin to study how these computers can be applied to complex\nreal-world problems such as NASA rover missions. Unfortunately, compiling\n(embedding) an optimization problem into the annealing hardware is itself a\ndifficult optimization problem and a major bottleneck currently preventing\nwidespread adoption. Additionally, while finding a single embedding is\ndifficult, no generalized method is known for tuning embeddings to use minimal\nhardware resources. To address these barriers, we introduce a graph-theoretic\nframework for developing structured embedding algorithms. Using this framework,\nwe introduce a biclique virtual hardware layer to provide a simplified\ninterface to the physical hardware. Additionally, we exploit bipartite\nstructure in quantum programs using odd cycle transversal (OCT) decompositions.\nBy coupling an OCT-based embedding algorithm with new, generalized reduction\nmethods, we develop a new baseline for embedding a wide range of optimization\nproblems into fault-free D-Wave annealing hardware. To encourage the reuse and\nextension of these techniques, we provide an implementation of the framework\nand embedding algorithms.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry has a minimum of two\nspecies of Weyl fermions, distinguished by their opposite chirality, in a pair\nof Weyl cones at opposite momenta $\\pm K$ that are displaced in the direction\nof the magnetization. Andreev reflection at the interface between a Weyl\nsemimetal in the normal state (N) and a superconductor (S) that pairs $\\pm K$\nmust involve a switch of chirality, otherwise it is blocked. We show that this\n\"chirality blockade\" suppresses the superconducting proximity effect when the\nmagnetization lies in the plane of the NS interface. A Zeeman field at the\ninterface can provide the necessary chirality switch and activate Andreev\nreflection.\n", "  Vertical graphene nanosheets (VGNs) are the material of choice for\nnext-generation electronic device applications. The growing demand for flexible\ndevices in electronic industry brings in restriction on growth temperature of\nthe material of interest. However, VGNs with better structural quality is\nusually achieved at high growth temperatures. The difficulty associated with\nthe direct growth on flexible substrates can overcome by adopting an effective\nstrategy of transferring the well grown VGNs onto arbitrary flexible substrates\nthrough soft chemistry route. Hence, we demonstrated a simple, inexpensive and\nscalable technique for the transfer of VGNs onto arbitrary substrates without\ndisrupting its morphology and structural properties. After transfer, the\nmorphology, chemical structure and electronic properties are analyzed by\nscanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and four probe resistive\nmethods, respectively. Associated characterization investigation indicates the\nretention of morphological, structural and electrical properties of transferred\nVGNs compared to as-grown one. Furthermore the storage capacity of the VGNs\ntransferred onto flexible substrates is also examined. A very lower sheet\nresistance of 0.67 kOhm/sq. and excellent supercapacitance of 158\nmicro-Farrad/cm2 with 91.4% retention after 2000 cycles confirms the great\nprospective of this damage-free transfer approach of VGNs for flexible\nnanoelectronic device applications\n", "  We study charmonium and bottomonium as relativistic bound states in a\nlight-front quantized Hamiltonian formalism. The effective Hamiltonian is based\non light-front holography. We use a recently proposed longitudinal confinement\nto complete the soft-wall holographic potential for the heavy flavors. The spin\nstructure is generated from the one-gluon exchange interaction with a running\ncoupling. The adoption of asymptotic freedom improves the spectroscopy compared\nwith previous light-front results. Within this model, we compute the mass\nspectroscopy, decay constants and the r.m.s. radii. We also present a detailed\nstudy of the obtained light-front wave functions and use the wave functions to\ncompute the light-cone distributions, specifically the distribution amplitudes\nand parton distribution functions. Overall, our model provides a reasonable\ndescription of the heavy quarkonia.\n", "  We propose the first viable radiative seesaw model, in which the neutrino\nmasses are induced radiatively via the two-loop Feynman diagram involving\nStrongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMP). The stability of SIMP dark\nmatter (DM) is ensured by a $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ discrete symmetry, through which the\nDM annihilation rate is dominated by the $3 \\to 2$ self-annihilating processes.\nThe right amount of thermal relic abundance can be obtained with perturbative\ncouplings in the resonant SIMP scenario, while the astrophysical bounds\ninferred from the Bullet cluster and spherical halo shapes can be satisfied. We\nshow that SIMP DM is able to maintain kinetic equilibrium with thermal plasma\nuntil the freeze-out temperature via the Yukawa interactions associated with\nneutrino mass generation.\n", "  Many dark matter interaction types lead to annihilation processes which\nsuffer from p-wave suppression or helicity suppression, rendering them\nsubdominant to unsuppressed s-wave processes. We demonstrate that the natural\ninclusion of dark initial state radiation can open an unsuppressed s-wave\nannihilation channel, and thus provide the dominant dark matter annihilation\nprocess for particular interaction types. We illustrate this effect with the\nbremsstrahlung of a dark spin-0 or dark spin-1 particle from fermionic dark\nmatter, $\\overline{\\chi}\\chi\\rightarrow \\overline{f}f\\phi$ or\n$\\overline{f}fZ'$. The dark initial state radiation process, despite having a\n3-body final state, proceeds at the same order in the new physics scale\n$\\Lambda$ as the annihilation to the 2-body final state\n$\\overline{\\chi}\\chi\\rightarrow \\overline{f}f$. This is lower order in\n$\\Lambda$ than the well-studied lifting of helicity suppression via Standard\nModel final state radiation, or virtual internal bremsstrahlung. This dark\nbremsstrahlung process should influence LHC and indirect detection searches for\ndark matter.\n", "  We present the first CMB power spectra from numerical simulations of the\nglobal O(N) linear $\\sigma$-model with N = 2,3, which have global strings and\nmonopoles as topological defects. In order to compute the CMB power spectra we\ncompute the unequal time correlators (UETCs) of the energy-momentum tensor,\nshowing that they fall off at high wave number faster than naive estimates\nbased on the geometry of the defects, indicating non-trivial\n(anti-)correlations between the defects and the surrounding Goldstone boson\nfield. We obtain source functions for Einstein-Boltzmann solvers from the\nUETCs, using a recent method that improves the modelling at the radiation-\nmatter transition. We show that the interpolation function that mimics the\ntransition is similar to other defect models, but not identical, confirming the\nnon-universality of the interpolation function. The CMB power spectra for\nglobal strings and monopoles have the same overall shape as those obtained\nusing the non-linear $\\sigma$-model approximation, which is well captured by a\nlarge-N calculation. However, the amplitudes are larger than the large-N\ncalculation predict, and in the case of global strings much larger: a factor of\n20 at the peak. Finally we compare the CMB power spectra with the latest CMB\ndata to put limits on the allowed contribution to the temperature power\nspectrum at multipole $\\ell$ = 10 of 1.7% for global strings and 2.4% for\nglobal monopoles. These limits correspond to symmetry-breaking scales of\n2.9x1015 GeV (6.3x1014 GeV with the expected logarithmic scaling of the\neffective string tension between the simulation time and decoupling) and\n6.4x1015 GeV respectively. The bound on global strings is a significant one for\nthe ultra-light axion scenario with axion masses ma 10-28 eV. These upper\nlimits indicate that gravitational wave from global topological defects will\nnot be observable at the GW observatory LISA.\n", "  The anisotropic model for landscapes erosion proposed by Pastor-Satorras and\nRothman in [R. Pastor-Satorras and D. H. Rothman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 4349\n(1998)] is believed to capture the physics of erosion at intermediate length\nscale ($\\lesssim3$ km), and to account for the large value of the roughness\nexponent $\\alpha$ observed in real data at this scale. Our study of this model\n-- conducted using the nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) --\nconcludes on the nonuniversality of this exponent because of the existence of a\nline of fixed points. Thus the roughness exponent depends (weakly) on the\ndetails of the soil and the erosion mechanisms. We conjecture that this\nfeature, while preserving the generic scaling observed in real data, could\nexplain the wide spectrum of values of $\\alpha$ measured for natural\nlandscapes.\n", "  We study the interplay between disorder and interactions for emergent bosonic\ndegrees of freedom induced by an external magnetic field in the Br-doped\nspin-gapped antiferromagnetic material Ni(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$\n(DTNX). Building on nuclear magnetic resonance experiments at high magnetic\nfield [A. Orlova et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 067203 (2017)], we describe the\nlocalization of isolated impurity states, providing a realistic theoretical\nmodeling for DTNX. Going beyond single impurity localization we use quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations to explore many-body effects from which pairwise\neffective interactions lead to a (impurity-induced) BEC revival [M. Dupont, S.\nCapponi, and N. Laflorencie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 067204 (2017)]. We further\naddress the question of the existence of a many-body localized Bose-glass (BG)\nphase in DTNX, which is found to compete with a series of a new kind of BEC\nregimes made out of the multi-impurity states. The global magnetic\nfield-temperature phase diagram of DTNX reveals a very rich structure for low\nimpurity concentration, with consecutive disorder-induced BEC mini-domes\nseparated by intervening many-body localized BG regimes. Upon increasing the\nimpurity level, multiple mini-BEC phases start to overlap, while intermediate\nBG regions vanish.\n", "  In this paper we explain how 4-dimensional general relativity and in\nparticular, the Einstein equation, emerge from the spinfoam amplitude in loop\nquantum gravity. We propose a new limit which couples both the semiclassical\nlimit and continuum limit of spinfoam amplitudes. The continuum Einstein\nequation emerges in this limit. Solutions of Einstein equation can be\napproached by dominant configurations in spinfoam amplitudes. A running scale\nis naturally associated to the sequence of refined triangulations. The\ncontinuum limit corresponds to the infrared limit of the running scale. An\nimportant ingredient in the derivation is a regularization for the sum over\nspins, which is necessary for the semiclassical continuum limit. We also\nexplain in this paper the role played by the so-called flatness in spinfoam\nformulation, and how to take advantage of it.\n", "  We show that the jet power $P_j$ and geometrically corrected $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity $L_\\gamma$ for the X-ray binaries (XRBs) Cygnus X-1, Cygnus X-3, and\nV404 Cygni, and $\\gamma$-ray upper limits for GRS 1915+105 and GX339-4, follow\nthe universal scaling for the energetics of relativistic jets from black hole\n(BH) systems found by Nemmen et al. (2012) for blazars and GRBs. The observed\npeak $\\gamma$-ray luminosity for XRBs is geometrically corrected; and the\nminimum jet power is estimated from the peak flux density of radio flares and\nthe flare rise time. The $L_\\gamma-P_j$ correlation holds across $\\sim 17$\norders of magnitude. The correlation suggests a jet origin for the high energy\nemission from X-ray binaries, and indicates a common mechanism or efficiency\nfor the high energy emission 0.1-100 GeV from all relativistic BH systems.\n", "  Recently proposed Born-Infeld (BI) theories of gravity assume a constant BI\nparameter ($\\kappa$). However, no clear consensus exists on the sign and value\nof $\\kappa$. Recalling the Brans-Dicke (BD) approach, where a scalar field was\nused to generate the gravitational constant $G$, we suggest an extension of\nBorn-Infeld gravity with a similar Brans-Dicke flavor. Thus, a new action, with\n$\\kappa$ elevated to a spacetime dependent real scalar field, is proposed. We\nillustrate this new theory in a cosmological setting with pressureless dust and\nradiation as matter. Assuming a functional form of $\\kappa(t)$, we numerically\nobtain the scale factor evolution and other details of the background\ncosmology. It is known that BI gravity differs from general relativity (GR) in\nthe strong-field regime but reduces to GR for intermediate and weak fields. Our\nstudies in cosmology demonstrate how, with this new, scalar-tensor BI gravity,\ndeviations from GR as well as usual BI gravity, may arise in the weak-field\nregime too. For example, we note a late-time acceleration without any dark\nenergy contribution. Apart from such qualitative differences, we note that\nfixing the sign and value of $\\kappa$ is no longer a necessity in this theory,\nthough the origin of the BD scalar does remain an open question.\n", "  It is shown that under certain conditions it is possible to model a complex\nsystem in a way that leads to results that do not depend on system size. As an\nexample of complex system an innovation diffusion model is considered. In that\nmodel a set of individuals (the agents), which are interconnected, must decide\nif adopt or not an innovation. The agents are connected in a member of the\nnetworks family known as small worlds networks (SWN). It is found that for a\nsubfamily of the SWN the saturation time and the form of the adoption curve are\ninvariants respect to the change in the size of the system.\n", "  The following study investigates the thermodynamic reaction barriers during\nnitrogen fixation for an inorganic sulfur desorbed photocatalyst Molybdenum\ndisulfide surface. The design space is investigated using an density functional\ntheory (DFT) method within a space bound by MMoS$_2$ M=Mo,Fe,Co. The discussion\nfocuses on Heyrovsky type reactions along both the associative and dissociative\npathway. A key insight into the roles of the inorganic and the balance between\nnitrogen and hydrogen affinity, providing evidence for an optimal material that\nminimizes the required over-potential. It is found that phases with a higher\nconcentration of Mo face high reaction barrier involving nitrogen, where phases\nwith higher concentrations of Fe and Co face high reaction barriers involving\nhydrogen species. In the absence of kinetic considerations, the best phase was\npredicted to be the 1T phase with a Mo$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$S$_{2}$ composition.\nThis phase proved to have a balance of hydrogen and nitrogen affinity and\nfollows the dissociative pathway, which can be evolved through non-thermal\nmethods.\n", "  We study the Josephson effect in a trijunction formed by two topological\nsuperconductor (TS) wires and a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. Using a\nboundary Green's function formalism, analytical results for the current-phase\nrelation are obtained in various limiting cases by modeling the TS wires via\nthe low-energy limit of a Kitaev chain. We show that Josephson transport\ncritically depends on the spin canting angle $\\theta$ between the boundary spin\npolarizations of the TS wires, which in turn suggests that the spin structure\nof Majorana states can be accessed through supercurrent measurements. We also\nextend the boundary Green's function approach to a more microscopic spinful\nwire model and thereby compute the dependence of $\\theta$ on experimentally\naccessible parameters such as the Zeeman field and/or the chemical potential.\nFurthermore, we show that the equilibrium current-phase relation between both\nTS wires exhibits a robust $4\\pi$-periodicity since the conventional\nsuperconducting lead effectively locks the fermion parity of the trijunction.\n", "  The improvement of Li-ion battery performance requires development of models\nthat capture the essential physics and chemistry in Li-ion battery electrode\nmaterials. In this paper a novel electrochemical phase-field model is presented\nthat captures the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of lithium-insertion in\nTiO$_2$-anatase, a well-known and intensively studied Li-ion battery electrode\nmaterial. Previous experimental work on lithiated anatase TiO$_2$ provided all\nparameters necessary for the phase-field simulations, giving the opportunity to\ngain fundamental insight in the lithiation of anatase and validate this\nphase-field model. The phase-field model captures the essential experimentally\nobserved phenomena, rationalising the impact of C-rate, particle size, surface\narea, and the memory effect on the performance of anatase as a Li-ion battery\nelectrode. Thereby a comprehensive physical picture of the lithiation of\nanatase TiO$_2$ is provided. The results of the simulations demonstrate that\nthe performance of anatase is limited by the formation of the poor Li-ion\ndiffusion in the Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of the particles. Unlike\nother electrode materials, the kinetic limitations of individual anatase\nparticles limit the performance of full electrodes. Hence, rather than\nimproving the ionic and electronic network in electrodes, improving the\nperformance of anatase TiO$_2$ electrodes requires preventing the formation of\na blocking Li$_1$TiO$_2$ phase at the surface of particles. Additionally, the\nqualitative agreement of the phase-field model, containing only parameters from\nliterature, with a broad spectrum of experiments demonstrates the capabilities\nof phase-field models for understanding Li-ion electrode materials, and its\npromise for guiding the design of electrodes through a thorough understanding\nof material properties and their interactions.\n", "  Graphene nanoribbons and constrictions are envisaged as fundamental\ncomponents of future carbon-based nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. At\nnanoscale, electronic effects in these devices depend heavily on the dimensions\nof the active channel and the nature of edges. Hence, controlling both these\nparameters is crucial to understand the physics in such systems. This review is\nabout the recent progress in the fabrication of graphene nanoribbons and\nconstrictions in terms of low temperature quantum transport. In particular,\nrecent advancements using encapsulated graphene allowing for quantized\nconductance and future experiments towards exploring spin effects in these\ndevices are presented. The influence of charge carrier inhomogeneity and the\nimportant length scales which play a crucial role for transport in high quality\nsamples are also discussed.\n", "  Evaporating droplets are known to show complex motion that has conventionally\nbeen explained by the Marangoni effect (flow induced by the gradient of surface\ntension). Here, we show that the droplet motion can be induced even in the\nabsence of the Marangoni effect due to the gradient of evaporation rate. We\nderive an equation for the velocity of a droplet subject to non-uniform\nevaporation rate and non-uniform surface tension placed on an inert substrate\nwhere the wettability is uniform and unchanged. The equation explains the\npreviously observed attraction-repulsion- chasing behaviors of evaporating\ndroplets.\n", "  We investigate some important physical aspects of a recently presented\ninterior solution for the Kerr metric. It is shown that, as in the spherically\nsymmetric case, there is a specific limit for the maximal value of the surface\npotential (degree of compactness), beyond which, unacceptable physical\nanomalies appear. Such a bound is related to the appearance of negative\n(repulsive) gravitational acceleration, that is accompanied by the appearance\nof negative values of the pressure. A detailed discussion on this effect is\npresented. We also study the possibility of a fragmentation scenario, assuming\nthat the source leaves the equilibrium, and we bring out the differences with\nthe spherically symmetric case.\n", "  In this paper, we studied the charmless $B_{c}\\to VV$ ($V$ denotes the light\nground $\\rm SU(3)$ vector meson) decays within the framework of QCD\nfactorization. In the evaluation, two different schemes for regulating the\nend-point divergence are adopted. One (scheme I) is to use parameterization\nmodel, which is usually employed in the QCD factorization approach; the other\n(scheme II) is based on the infrared finite gluon propagator of Cornwall\nprescription. It is found that, in the annihilation amplitudes, the end-point\ndivergence appears only in the power-suppressed corrections related to the\ntwist-3 distribution amplitudes of $V$-meson. The strength of annihilation\namplitudes evaluated in scheme II is generally larger than the one in scheme I.\nNumerically, in the decay modes considered in this paper, the CKM-favored\n$B_{c} \\to \\rho^{-}\\omega, K^{*-}K^{*0} $ decays have the relatively large\nbranching fractions, $\\sim {\\cal{O}}(10^{-7})$, and hence are likely to be the\nfirst observed by the future experiments. In addition, all of the decay modes\nare dominated by the longitudinal polarization state; numerically, $f_{L}(B_{c}\n\\to VV) \\gtrsim 99\\%$.\n", "  In this paper, we present an AdS black hole solution with Ricci flat horizon\nin Einstein-phantom scalar theory. The phantom scalar fields just depend on the\ntransverse coordinates $x$ and $y$, and which are parameterized by the\nparameter $\\alpha$. We study the thermodynamics of the AdS phantom black hole.\nAlthough its horizon is a Ricci flat Euclidean space, we find that the\nthermodynamical properties of the black hole solution are qualitatively same as\nthose of AdS Schwarzschild black hole. Namely there exists a minimal\ntemperature, the large black hole is thermodynamically stable , while the\nsmaller one is unstable, so there is a so-called Hawking-Page phase transition\nbetween the large black hole and the thermal gas solution in the AdS spacetime\nin Poincare coordinates. We also calculate the entanglement entropy for a strip\ngeometry dual to the AdS phantom black holes and find that the behavior of the\nentanglement entropy is qualitatively the same as that of the black hole\nthermodynamical entropy.\n", "  The paper addresses novel dispersion properties of elastic flexural waves in\nperiodic structures which possess rotational inertia. The structure is\nrepresented as a lattice, whose elementary links are formally defined as the\nRayleigh beams. Although in the quasi-static regime such beams respond\nsimilarly to the classical Euler-Bernoulli beams, as the frequency increases\nthe dispersion of flexural waves possesses new interesting features. For a\ndoubly periodic lattice, we give a special attention to degeneracies associated\nwith so-called Dirac cones on the dispersion surfaces as well as directional\nanisotropy. Comparative analysis for Floquet-Bloch waves in periodic flexural\nlattices of different geometries is presented and accompanied by numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  We demonstrate simultaneous detection of current driven antidamping-like and\nfield-like spin-orbit torques in heavy metal/ferromagnetic metal bilayers by\nmeasuring all three magnetization components m_(x,) m_y, and m_z using the\nvector magneto-optic Kerr effect. We have also implemented a self-calibration\nmethod to accurately determine the effective fields of spin-orbit torques. With\nthis technique, we investigate the magnitude and direction of spin-orbit\ntorques in a series of platinum/permalloy samples. The values found are in\nexcellent agreement with results obtained via quadratic magneto-optic Kerr\neffect, planar Hall effect, and spin transfer ferromagnetic resonance\nmeasurements.\n", "  We discuss current advances in forward and inverse modeling for local\nhelioseismology. We report theoretical uniqueness results, in particular the\nNovikov-Agaltsov reconstruction algorithm, which is relevant to solving the\nnon-linear inverse problem of time-distance helioseismology (finite amplitude\npertubations to the medium). Numerical experiments were conducted to determine\nthe number of frequencies required to reconstruct density and sound speed in\nthe solar interior.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae are generally agreed to arise from thermonuclear\nexplosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The actual path to explosion,\nhowever, remains elusive, with numerous plausible parent systems and explosion\nmechanisms suggested. Observationally, type Ia supernovae have multiple\nsubclasses, distinguished by their lightcurves and spectra. This raises the\nquestion whether these reflect that multiple mechanisms occur in nature, or\ninstead that explosions have a large but continuous range of physical\nproperties. We revisit the idea that normal and 91bg-like supernovae can be\nunderstood as part of a spectral sequence, in which changes in temperature\ndominate. Specifically, we find that a single ejecta structure is sufficient to\nprovide reasonable fits of both the normal type Ia supernova SN~2011fe and the\n91bg-like SN~2005bl, provided that the luminosity and thus temperature of the\nejecta are adjusted appropriately. This suggests that the outer layers of the\nejecta are similar, thus providing some support of a common explosion\nmechanism. Our spectral sequence also helps to shed light on the conditions\nunder which carbon can be detected in pre-maximum SN~Ia spectra -- we find that\nemission from iron can \"fill in\" the carbon trough in cool SN~Ia. This may\nindicate that the outer layers of the ejecta of events in which carbon is\ndetected are relatively metal poor compared to events where carbon is not\ndetected.\n", "  We study the photoevaporation of molecular clumps exposed to a UV radiation\nfield including hydrogen-ionizing photons ($h\\nu > 13.6$ eV) produced by\nmassive stars or quasars. We follow the propagation and collision of shock\nwaves inside clumps and take into account self-shielding effects, determining\nthe evolution of clump size and density with time. The structure of the\nionization-photodissociation region (iPDR) is obtained for different initial\nclump masses ($M=0.01 - 10^4\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$) and impinging fluxes ($G_0=10^2 -\n10^5$ in units of the Habing flux). The cases of molecular clumps engulfed in\nthe HII region of an OB star and clumps carried within quasar outflows are\ntreated separately. We find that the clump undergoes in both cases an initial\nshock-contraction phase and a following expansion phase, which lets the\nradiation penetrate in until the clump is completely evaporated. Typical\nevaporation time-scales are $\\simeq 0.01$ Myr in the stellar case and 0.1 Myr\nin the quasar case, where the clump mass is 0.1 ${\\rm M}_\\odot$ and $10^3\\,{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$ respectively. We find that clump lifetimes in quasar outflows are\ncompatible with their observed extension, suggesting that photoevaporation is\nthe main mechanism regulating the size of molecular outflows.\n", "  In a system with Dirac cones, spatial modulation in material parameters\ninduces a pseudo magnetic field, which acts like an external magnetic field.\nHere, we derive a concise formula to count the pseudo Landau levels in the\nsimplest setup for having a pseudo magnetic field. The formula is so concise\nthat it is helpful in seeing the essence of the phenomenon, and in considering\nthe experimental design for the pseudo magnetic field. Furthermore, it is\nrevealed that anisotropic Dirac cones are advantageous in pseudo Landau level\nformation in general. The proposed setup is relatively easy to be realized by\nspatial modulation in the chemical composition, and we perform an estimation of\nthe pseudo magnetic field in an existing material (an antiperovskite material),\nby following the composition dependence with the help of the ab-initio method.\n", "  The importance of modeling the spread of epidemics through a population has\nled to the development of mathematical models for infectious disease\npropagation. A number of empirical studies have collected and analyzed data on\ncontacts between individuals using a variety of sensors. Typically one uses\nsuch data to fit a probabilistic model of network contacts over which a disease\nmay propagate. In this paper, we investigate the effects of different contact\nnetwork models with varying levels of complexity on the outcomes of simulated\nepidemics using a stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. We\nevaluate these network models on six datasets of contacts between people in a\nvariety of settings. Our results demonstrate that the choice of network model\ncan have a significant effect on how closely the outcomes of an epidemic\nsimulation on a simulated network match the outcomes on the actual network\nconstructed from the sensor data. In particular, preserving degrees of nodes\nappears to be much more important than preserving cluster structure for\naccurate epidemic simulations.\n", "  Through the analysis and interpretation of newly obtained and of literature\ndata we have clarified the nature of poorly investigated IRAS point sources\nclassified as late type stars, belonging to the Byurakan IRAS ~Stars catalog.\nFrom medium resolution spectroscopyof 95 stars we have strongly revised 47\nspectral types and newly classified 31 sources. Nine stars are of G or K types,\nfour are N carbon stars in the Asymptotic Giant Branch, the others being M type\nstars. From literature and new photometric observations we have studied their\nvariability behaviour. For the regular variables we determined distances,\nabsolute magnitudes and mass loss rates. For the other stars we estimated the\ndistances, ranging between 1.3 and 10~kpc with a median of 2.8~kpc from the\ngalactic plane, indicating that BIS stars mostly belong to the halo population.\n", "  We have derived algebraic, analytic expressions for the chemical potential\nwithout any restriction on temperature for all types of doped, or extrinsic,\ngapped Dirac cone materials including gapped graphene, silicene, germanene and\nsingle-layer transition metal dichalcogenides. As an important intermediate\nstep of our derivations, we have established a reliable piecewise-linear model\nfor cal- culating the density-of-states in molybdenum disulfide, showing good\nagreement with previously obtained numerical results. For the spin- and\nvalley-resolved band structure, we obtain an additional decrease of the\nchemical potential due to thermally induced doping of the upper subband at\nfinite temperature. It has been demonstrated that since the symmetry between\nthe electron and hole states in $MoS_2$ is broken, the chemical potential could\ncross the zero-energy level at sufficiently high temperature. These results\nallow us to investigate the collective properties, polarizability, plasmons and\ntheir damping. Emphasis is placed on low temperatures, when initial electron\ndoping plays a crucial role. We clearly demonstrated the contribution of the\ninitial doping to the finite-temperature collective properties of the\nconsidered materials.\n", "  We introduce a method for using Fizeau interferometry to measure the\nintrinsic resolving power of a diffraction grating. This method is more\naccurate than traditional techniques based on a long-trace profiler (LTP),\nsince it is sensitive to long-distance phase errors not revealed by a d-spacing\nmap. We demonstrate 50,400 resolving power for a mechanically ruled XUV grating\nfrom Inprentus, Inc.\n", "  In their recent paper \"Is a Time Symmetric Interpretation of Quantum Theory\nPossible Without Retrocausality?\", Matthew Leifer and Matthew Pusey argue that\nthe answer to their title question is \"no\". Unfortunately, the central proof\noffered in the paper contains a fatal error, and the conclusion cannot be\nestablished. Interpretations of quantum theory without retrocausalty can be\ntime symmetric not only in the traditional sense but also in Leifer and Pusey's\nsupposedly stricter sense. There appear to be no prospects for proving any\nanalogous theorem.\n", "  The article is devoted to the Abraham force in a conducting medium. From the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field interaction with moving\ncharges the equation for the Abraham force is obtained. It is shown that the\nAbraham force in a conducting medium, as well as in a dielectric medium, has\nvortical character. Current density vectors and vector potential must be\nnon-collinear\n", "  Cuprate superconductors have long been known to exhibit an energy gap that\npersists high above the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$). Debate\nhas continued now for decades as to whether it is a precursor superconducting\ngap or a pseudogap arising from some competing correlation. Failure to resolve\nthis has arguably delayed explaining the origins of superconductivity in these\nhighly complex materials. Here we effectively settle the question by\ncalculating a variety of thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties, exploring\nthe effect of a temperature-dependent pair-breaking term in the self-energy in\nthe presence of pairing interactions that persist well above $T_c$. We start by\nfitting the detailed temperature-dependence of the electronic specific heat and\nimmediately can explain its hitherto puzzling field dependence. Taking this\nsame combination of pairing temperature and pair-breaking scattering we are\nthen able to simultaneously describe in detail the unusual temperature and\nfield dependence of the superfluid density, tunneling, Raman and optical\nspectra, which otherwise defy explanation in terms a superconducting gap that\ncloses conventionally at $T_c$. These findings demonstrate that the gap above\n$T_c$ in the overdoped regime likely originates from incoherent superconducting\ncorrelations, and is distinct from the competing-order \"pseudogap\" that appears\nat lower doping.\n", "  Stanene has been predicted to be a two-dimensional topological insulator\n(2DTI). Its low-buckled atomic geometry and the enhanced spin-orbit coupling\nare expected to cause a prominent quantum spin hall (QSH) effect. However, most\nof the experimentally grown stanene to date displays a metallic state without a\nreal gap, possibly due to the chemical coupling with the substrate and the\nstress applied by the substrate. Here,we demonstrate an efficient way of tuning\nthe atomic buckling in stanene to open a topologically nontrivial energy gap.\nVia tuning the growth kinetics, we obtain not only the low-buckled 1x1 stanene\nbut also an unexpected high-buckled R3xR3 stanene on the Bi(111) substrate.\nScanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study combined with density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculation confirms that the R3xR3 stanene is a distorted 1x1\nstructure with a high-buckled Sn in every three 1x1 unit cells. The\nhigh-buckled R3xR3 stanene favors a large band inversion at the {\\Gamma} point,\nand the spin orbital coupling open a topologically nontrivial energy gap. The\nexistence of edge states as verified in both STM measurement and DFT\ncalculation further confirms the topology of the R3xR3 stanene. This study\nprovides an alternate way to tune the topology of monolayer 2DTI materials.\n", "  The innermost stable circular orbit equation of a test particle is obtained\nfor an approximate Kerr-like spacetime with quadrupole moment. We derived the\neffective potential for the radial coordinate by the Euler-Lagrange method.\nThis equation can be employed to measure the mass quadrupole by observational\nmeans, because from this equation a quadratic polynomial for the quadrupole\nmoment can be found. As expected, the limiting cases of this equation are found\nto be the known cases of Kerr and Schwarzschild.\n", "  In many classes of unconventional superconductors, the question of whether\nthe superconductivity is enhanced by the quantum-critical fluctuations on the\nverge of an ordered phase remains elusive. One of the most direct ways of\naddressing this issue is to investigate how the superconducting dome traces a\nshift of the ordered phase. Here, we study how the phase diagram of the\niron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ changes with disorder\nvia electron irradiation, which keeps the carrier concentrations intact. With\nincreasing disorder, we find that the magneto-structural transition is\nsuppressed, indicating that the critical concentration is shifted to the lower\nside. Although the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is depressed at\nhigh concentrations ($x\\gtrsim$0.28), it shows an initial increase at lower\n$x$. This implies that the superconducting dome tracks the shift of the\nantiferromagnetic phase, supporting the view of the crucial role played by\nquantum-critical fluctuations in enhancing superconductivity in this iron-based\nhigh-$T_c$ family.\n", "  This are the cumulated reports of the SoNDe detector Project as of July 2017.\nThe contained reports are: - Report on the 1x1 module technical demonstrator -\nReport on used materials - Report on radiation hardness of components - Report\non potential additional applications - Report on the 2x2 module technical\ndemonstrator - Report on test results of the 2x2 technical demonstrator\n", "  We design a vehicle with a steering system made of two independently\nrotatable wheels on the front. We quantify the effectiveness of the steering\nsystem in the mobility and maneuverability of the vehicle running in a box\ncontaining a layer ping-pong balls with a packing density 0.8, below the random\nclose packing value 0.84 in 2D. The steering system can reduce the resistance\nexerted by the jammed balls formed ahead of the fast-moving vehicle. Moreover,\nif only one of the two steering wheels rotates, the vehicle can turn into the\ndirection opposite to the rotating wheel. The steering system performs more\nefficiently if the wheels engage the ping-pong balls better by increasing the\ncontact area between the wheels and the balls. We advocate applying our design\nto machines moving in granular materials with a moderate packing density.\n", "  By the example of a mathematical model of a biochemical process, the\nstructural instability of dynamical systems is studied by calculating the full\nspectrum of Lyapunov indices with the use of the generalized Benettin\nalgorithm. For the reliability of the results obtained, the higher Lyapunov\nindex determined with the orthogonalization of perturbation vectors by the\nGram-Schmidt method is compared with that determined with the overdetermination\nof only the norm of a perturbation vector. Specific features of these methods\nand the comparison of their efficiencies for a multidimensional phase space are\npresented. A scenario of the formation of strange attractors at a change of the\ndissipation parameter is studied. The main regularities and the mechanism of\nformation of a deterministic chaos due to the appearance of a fold or a funnel,\nwhich leads to the uncertainty of the evolution of a biosystem, are determined.\n", "  Deconstruction of the theme of the 2017 FQXi essay contest is already an\ninteresting exercise in its own right: Teleology is rarely useful in physics\n--- the only known mainstream physics example (black hole event horizons) has a\nvery mixed score-card --- so the \"goals\" and \"aims and intentions\" alluded to\nin the theme of the 2017 FQXi essay contest are already somewhat pushing the\nlimits. Furthermore, \"aims and intentions\" certainly carries the implication of\nconsciousness, and opens up a whole can of worms related to the mind-body\nproblem. As for \"mindless mathematical laws\", that allusion is certainly in\ntension with at least some versions of the \"mathematical universe hypothesis\".\nFinally \"wandering towards a goal\" again carries the implication of\nconsciousness, with all its attendant problems.\n  In this essay I will argue, simply because we do not yet have any really good\nmathematical or physical theory of consciousness, that the theme of this essay\ncontest is premature, and unlikely to lead to any resolution that would be\nwidely accepted in the mathematics or physics communities.\n", "  Low-metallicity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are interesting to study the\nearly phase of the AGN evolution. However most AGNs are chemically matured and\naccordingly low-metallicity AGNs are extremely rare. One approach to search for\nlow-metallicity AGNs systematically is utilizing the so-called BPT diagram that\nconsists of the [O III]$\\lambda$5007/H$\\beta$$\\lambda4861$ and [N\nII]$\\lambda6584$/H$\\alpha$$\\lambda6563$ flux ratios. Specifically,\nphotoionization models predict that low-metallicity AGNs show a high [O\nIII]$\\lambda$5007/H$\\beta$$\\lambda$4861 ratio and a relatively low [N\nII]$\\lambda$6584/H$\\alpha$$\\lambda$6563 ratio, that corresponds to the location\nbetween the sequence of star-forming galaxies and that of usual AGNs on the BPT\ndiagram (hereafter \"the BPT valley\"). However, other populations of galaxies\nsuch as star-forming galaxies and AGNs with a high electron density or a high\nionization parameter could be also located in the BPT valley, not only\nlow-metallicity AGNs. In this paper, we examine whether most of emission-line\ngalaxies at the BPT valley are low-metallicity AGNs or not. We select 70\nBPT-valley objects from 212,866 emission line galaxies obtained by the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. Among the 70 BPT-valley objects, 43 objects show firm\nevidence of the AGN activity; i.e., the He II$\\lambda$4686 emission and/or weak\nbut significant broad H$\\alpha$ emission. Our analysis shows that those 43\nBPT-valley AGNs are not characterized by a very high gas density nor ionization\nparameter, inferring that at least 43 among 70 BPT-valley objects (i.e., $>60$\n%) are low-metallicity AGNs. This suggests that the BPT diagram is an efficient\ntool to search for low-metallicity AGNs.\n", "  The internal evolution of disk galaxies like the Milky Way are driven by\nnon-axisymmetries (bars) and the implied angular momentum transfer of the\nmatter; baryons are essentially driven inwards to build a more concentrated\ndisk. This mass concentration may lead to the decoupling of a secondary bar,\nsince the orbit precessing frequency is then much enhanced. Vertical resonances\nwith the bar will form a box/peanut bulge in a Gyr time-scale. Gas flows due to\ngravity torques can lead to a young nuclear disk forming stars, revealed by a\nsigma-drop in velocity dispersion. These gas flows moderated by feedback\nproduce intermittent accretion of the super-massive black hole, and cycles of\nAGN activity. The fountain effect due to nuclear star formation may lead to\ninclined, and even polar nuclear disks.\n", "  We present the characteristics and the performance of the new CCD camera\nsystem, SNUCAM-II (Seoul National University CAMera system II) that was\ninstalled on the Lee Sang Gak Telescope (LSGT) at the Siding Spring Observatory\nin 2016. SNUCAM-II consists of a deep depletion chip covering a wide wavelength\nfrom 0.3 {\\mu}m to 1.1 {\\mu}m with high sensitivity (QE at > 80% over 0.4 to\n0.9 {\\mu}m). It is equipped with the SDSS ugriz filters and 13 medium band\nwidth (50 nm) filters, enabling us to study spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of diverse objects from extragalactic sources to solar system objects.\nOn LSGT, SNUCAM-II offers 15.7 {\\times} 15.7 arcmin field-of-view (FOV) at a\npixel scale of 0.92 arcsec and a limiting magnitude of g = 19.91 AB mag and\nz=18.20 AB mag at 5{\\sigma} with 180 sec exposure time for point source\ndetection.\n", "  The stochastic advection of low energy deuterium ions is studied in a three\ndimensional realistic turbulence model in conditions relevant for current\ntokamak fusion experiments. The diffusion coefficients are calculated starting\nfrom the test particles trajectories in the framework of the semi-analitical\nstatistical model called the Decorrelation Trajectory Method. We show that\ntrajectory trapping determined by the space correlation of the velocity field\nis the main cause for anomalous diffusion and we obtain the transport regimes\ncorresponding to different values of the parameters of the turbulence model and\na trapping condition in the limit of frozen turbulence. Depending on the value\nof the parameters of the model, the interaction between turbulence and magnetic\ndrifts leads to both an increase (with transport in the poloidal direction\nincreasing up to an order of magnitude) and a decrease of the particle\ntransport.\n", "  Liquid state NMR is a powerful tool for the analysis of complex mixtures of\nunknown molecules. This capacity has been used in many analytical approaches:\nmetabolomics, identification of active compounds in natural extracts,\ncharacterization of species, and such studies require the acquisition of many\ndiverse NMR measurements on series of samples.\n  While acquisition can easily be performed automatically, the number of NMR\nexperiments involved in these studies increases very rapidly and this data\navalanche requires to resort to automatic processing and analysis.\n  We present here a program that allows the autonomous, unsupervised processing\nof a large corpus of 1D, 2D and DOSY experiments from a series of samples\nacquired in different conditions. The program provides all the signal\nprocessing steps, as well as peak-picking and bucketing of 1D and 2D spectra,\nthe program and its components are fully available. In an experiment mimicking\nthe search of an active species in natural extract, we use it for the automatic\ndetection of small amounts of artemisin added to a series of plant extracts,\nand for the generation of the spectral fingerprint of this molecules.\n  This program called Plasmodesma is a novel tool which should be useful to\ndecipher complex mixtures, particularly in the discovery of biologically active\nnatural products from plants extracts, but can also in drug discovery or\nmetabolomics studies.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry at\na hard X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) on a sample diffraction patterns. This\nis different from the traditional approach when HBT interferometry requires\ndirect beam measurements in absence of the sample. HBT analysis was carried out\non the Bragg peaks from the colloidal crystals measured at Linac Coherent Light\nSource (LCLS). We observed high degree (80%) spatial coherence of the full beam\nand the pulse duration of the monochromatized beam on the order of 11 fs that\nis significantly shorter than expected from the electron bunch measurements.\n", "  The magnetic field associated with a picosecond intense electron pulse is\nshown to switch locally the magnetization of extended films and nanostructures\nand to ignite locally spin waves excitations. Also, topologically protected\nmagnetic textures such as skyrmions can be imprinted swiftly in a sample with a\nresidual Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbital coupling. Characteristics of the\ncreated excitations such as the topological charge or the width of the magnon\nspectrum can be steered via the duration and the strength of the electron\npulses. The study points to a possible way for a spatiotemporally controlled\ngeneration of magnetic and skyrmionic excitations.\n", "  Optical parametric oscillators are widely-used pulsed and continuous-wave\ntunable sources for innumerable applications, as in quantum technologies,\nimaging and biophysics. A key drawback is material dispersion imposing the\nphase-matching condition that generally entails a complex setup design, thus\nhindering tunability and miniaturization. Here we show that the burden of\nphase-matching is surprisingly absent in parametric micro-resonators adopting\nmonolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides as quadratic nonlinear materials. By\nthe exact solution of nonlinear Maxwell equations and first-principle\ncalculation of the semiconductor nonlinear response, we devise a novel kind of\nphase-matching-free miniaturized parametric oscillator operating at\nconventional pump intensities. We find that different two-dimensional\nsemiconductors yield degenerate and non-degenerate emission at various spectral\nregions thanks to doubly-resonant mode excitation, which can be tuned through\nthe incidence angle of the external pump laser. In addition we show that\nhigh-frequency electrical modulation can be achieved by doping through\nelectrical gating that efficiently shifts the parametric oscillation threshold.\nOur results pave the way for new ultra-fast tunable micron-sized sources of\nentangled photons, a key device underpinning any quantum protocol.\nHighly-miniaturized optical parametric oscillators may also be employed in\nlab-on-chip technologies for biophysics, environmental pollution detection and\nsecurity.\n", "  This paper shows a statistical analysis of 10.2 kHz Omega broadcasts of an\nartificial signal broadcast from ground stations, propagated in the\nplasmasphere, and detected using an automatic detection method we developed. We\nstudy the propagation patterns of the Omega signals to understand the\npropagation characteristics that are strongly affected by plasmaspheric\nelectron density and the ambient magnetic field. We show the unique propagation\npatterns of the Omega 10.2 kHz signal when it was broadcast from two\nhigh-middle-latitude stations. We use about eight years of data captured by the\nPoynting flux analyzer subsystem on board the Akebono satellite from October\n1989 to September 1997. We demonstrate that the signals broadcast from almost\nthe same latitude (in geomagnetic coordinates) propagated differently depending\non the geographic latitude. We also study propagation characteristics as a\nfunction of local time, season, and solar activity. The Omega signal tended to\npropagate farther on the nightside than on the dayside and was more widely\ndistributed during winter than during summer. When solar activity was at\nmaximum, the Omega signal propagated at a lower intensity level. In contrast,\nwhen solar activity was at minimum, the Omega signal propagated at a higher\nintensity and farther from the transmitter station.\n", "  The results of paleointensity determinations of the geomagnetic field, which\nare obtained by sedimentary rocks in the Middle Jurassic - Neogene (167-12) Ma,\nare summarized. It was found that in the interval (167-67) Ma (Middle Jurassic\n- Cretaceous) mean values and amplitudes of paleointensity variations\nincreased. Mean values of paleointensity reached a maximum in front of the\nCretaceous-Paleogene boundary. During the Paleogene the mean values and\namplitudes of paleointensity variations decreased. In the Cretaceous - the\nbeginning of the Paleogene cyclic changes in the amplitudes of paleointensity\nvariations with characteristic times of several million years have been\nobserved. It is shown that the duration of cycles of the paleointensity changes\ncoincided with transgressive-regressive cycles (T-R cycles). This can be\nconsidered as a confirmation of the hypothesis on a relation between processes\nin the Earth's core and tectonic processes.\n", "  The Hugoniot for Deuterium is calculated using the classical-map\nhyper-netted-chain (CHNC) approach using several models of the effective\ntemperature that may be assigned to the electron-ion interaction. This\neffective temperature embodies the exchange-correlation and kinetic energy\nfunctional that is assigned to the electron-ion interaction. Deuterium pair\ndistribution functions (calculated using the neutral-pseudo atom method)\nshowing the formation of molecular pre-peaks are displayed to clarify the\nsoft-turning over of the hugoniot in the pressure range of 0.2-0.6 Megabars.\nThis contribution updates a previous CHNC calculation of the deuterium hugoniot\ngiven in Phys. Rev. B, 66, 014110 (2002).\n", "  We focus on implementing and optimizing a sixth-order finite-difference\nsolver for simulating compressible fluids on a GPU using third-order\nRunge-Kutta integration. Since graphics processing units perform well in\ndata-parallel tasks, this makes them an attractive platform for fluid\nsimulation. However, high-order stencil computation is memory-intensive with\nrespect to both main memory and the caches of the GPU. We present two\napproaches for simulating compressible fluids using 55-point and 19-point\nstencils. We seek to reduce the requirements for memory bandwidth and cache\nsize in our methods by using cache blocking and decomposing a latency-bound\nkernel into several bandwidth-bound kernels. Our fastest implementation is\nbandwidth-bound and integrates $343$ million grid points per second on a Tesla\nK40t GPU, achieving a $3.6 \\times$ speedup over a comparable hydrodynamics\nsolver benchmarked on two Intel Xeon E5-2690v3 processors. Our alternative GPU\nimplementation is latency-bound and achieves the rate of $168$ million updates\nper second.\n", "  In the paper the kinetic model of the biochemical process of cellulose\nhydrolysis with cell application is presented. The model includes enzyme\nbiosynthesis control and is open conditions it represents the dynamical system\nin the preturbulent regime. The limit cycle and its five consequence\nbifurcations of the doubling-period type are found. Also the limit regime of\nthe system - the strange attractor - is presented.\n", "  We analyze the source of inter-model scatter in the surface temperature\nresponse to quadrupling CO2 in two sets of GCM simulations from the Tropical\nRain Belts with an Annual cycle and a Continent Model Intercomparison Project\n(TRACMIP; Voigt et al, 2016). TRACMIP provides simulations of idealized\nclimates that allow for studying the fundamental dynamics of tropical rainfall\nand its response to climate change. One configuration is an aquaplanet\natmosphere (i.e., with zonally-symmetric boundary conditions) coupled to a slab\nocean (AquaCTL and Aqua4x). The other includes an equatorial continent\nrepresented by a thin slab ocean with increased surface albedo and decreased\nevaporation (LandCTL and Land4x).\n", "  Topological insulators are ideally represented as having an insulating bulk\nwith topologically protected, spin-textured surface states. However, it is\nincreasingly becoming clear that these surface transport channels can be\naccompanied by a finite conducting bulk, as well as additional topologically\ntrivial surface states. To investigate these parallel conduction transport\nchannels, we studied Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films,\nin high magnetic fields up to 30 T so as to access channels with a lower\nmobility. We identify a clear Zeeman-split bulk contribution to the\noscillations from a comparison between the charge-carrier densities extracted\nfrom the magnetoresistance and the oscillations. Furthermore, our analyses\nindicate the presence of a two-dimensional state and signatures of additional\nstates the origin of which cannot be conclusively determined. Our findings\nunderpin the necessity of theoretical studies on the origin of and the\ninterplay between these parallel conduction channels for a careful analysis of\nthe material's performance.\n", "  The integral field spectrograph, SPIFFI, has complex line profile shapes that\nvary with wavelength and pixel scale, the origins of which have been sought\nsince the instrument construction. SPIFFI is currently operational as part of\nSINFONI at the VLT, and will be upgraded and incorporated into the new VLT\ninstrument ERIS. We conducted an investigation of the line profiles based on\nmeasurements we could take with the instrument calibration unit, as well as\nlaboratory measurements of spare SPIFFI optical components. Cryogenic\nmeasurements of a spare SPIFFI diffraction grating showed significant periodic\ndeformation. These measurements match the cryogenic deformation expected from\nbimetallic bending stress based on a finite element analysis of the\nlightweighted grating blank. The periodic deformation of the grating surface\ngives rise to satellite peaks in the diffraction pattern of the grating. An\noptical simulation including the cryogenic grating deformation reproduces the\nbehavior of the SPIFFI line profiles with both wavelength and pixel scale as\nmeasured with the instrument calibration unit. The conclusion is that cryogenic\ndeformation of the diffraction gratings is responsible for the non-ideal line\nprofiles, and that the diffraction gratings should be replaced during the\nupgrade for optimal instrument performance.\n", "  In this project, we study the properties of a non-trivial topological system\nwhich exhibits localized edge states. In our study, we adress the Kitaev chain,\na one-dimensional chain of atoms deposited on top of a p-wave superconductor\nthat induces superconductivity in the chain by proximity effect. We establish a\ncorrespondence between the Kitaev chain and a tight-binding lattice with a\nparticular geometry for a particular case of the system parameters. This\ncorrespondence allows one to find the exact energy levels and eigenstates of\nthe Kitaev chain when t=|\\Delta| and \\mu=0 for an arbitrary chain size.\n", "  We show that Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms attached to minimal or\nnext-to-minimal automorphic representations of ${\\mathrm{SL}}_n(\\mathbb{A})$\nare completely determined by certain highly degenerate Whittaker coefficients.\nWe give an explicit formula for the Fourier expansion, analogously to the\nPiatetski-Shapiro-Shalika formula. In addition, we derive expressions for\nFourier coefficients associated to all maximal parabolic subgroups. These\nresults have potential applications for scattering amplitudes in string theory.\n", "  A model in which the soft collisions of the nucleon are described in terms of\ninteractions of its two constituents (a quark and a diquark) is proposed. When\nadjusted to describe precisely the elastic proton-proton scattering data and\nsupplemented with the idea of wounded constituents, the model accounts rather\nwell for the centrality dependence of particle production in the central\nrapidity region at RHIC energies.\n", "  We consider the $m$-phase Whitham's averaging method and propose a procedure\nof \"averaging\" of non-local Hamiltonian structures. The procedure is based on\nthe existence of a sufficient number of local commuting integrals of a system\nand gives a Poisson bracket of Ferapontov type for the Whitham's system. The\nmethod can be considered as a generalization of the Dubrovin-Novikov procedure\nfor the local field-theoretical brackets.\n"]}
