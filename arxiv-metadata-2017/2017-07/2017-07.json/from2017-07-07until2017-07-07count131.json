The connection between singular eigenstates of the\nstatistical evolution of such processes and popular fractal curves is\nemphasized.\n", "  We consider travel time tomography problems involving detection of high\ncontrast, discrete high velocity structures. This results in a discrete\nnonlinear inverse problem, for which traditional grid-based models and\niterative linearized least-squares reconstruction algorithms are not suitable.\nThis is because travel paths change significantly near the high contrast\nvelocity structure, making it more difficult to inversely calculate the travel\npath and infer the velocity along the path. We propose a model-based approach\nto describe the high velocity structure using pre-defined elementary objects.\nCompared to a grid-based model, our approach has complexity that increases as a\nfunction of the number of objects, rather than increasing with the number of\ncells (usually very large). A new reconstruction algorithm is developed that\nprovides estimates of the probability that a high velocity structure appears at\nany point in the region of interest. Simulation results show that our method\ncan efficiently sample the model parameter space, and we map the model\nparameters into the high velocity structures in spatial domain to generate a\n\"probability map\", which represent the appearance of the high velocity\nstructure in different regions. We show the probability map not only gives the\nhighest probability to the optimal solution, but also includes other possible\nmodels as well.\n", "  There are several issues to do with dwarf galaxy predictions in the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology that have suscitated much recent debate about the\npossible modification of the nature of dark matter as providing a solution. We\nexplore a novel solution involving ultra-light axions that can potentially\nresolve the missing satellites problem, the cusp-core problem, and the `too big\nto fail' problem. We discuss approximations to non-linear structure formation\nin dark matter models containing a component of ultra-light axions across four\norders of magnitude in mass, $10^{-24}\\text{ eV}\\lesssim m_a \\lesssim\n10^{-20}\\text{ eV}$, a range too heavy to be well constrained by linear\ncosmological probes such as the CMB and matter power spectrum, and too\nlight/non-interacting for other astrophysical or terrestrial axion searches. We\nfind that an axion of mass $m_a\\approx 10^{-21}\\text{ eV}$ contributing\napproximately $85\\%$ of the total dark matter can introduce a significant kpc\nscale core in a typical Milky Way satellite galaxy in sharp contrast to a\nthermal relic with a transfer function cut off at the same scale, while still\nallowing such galaxies to form in significant number. Therefore ultra-light\naxions do not suffer from the \\emph{Catch 22} that applies to using a warm dark\nmatter as a solution to the small scale problems of cold dark matter. Our model\nsimultaneously allows formation of enough high redshift galaxies to allow\nreconciliation with observational constraints, and also reduces the maximum\ncircular velocities of massive dwarfs so that baryonic feedback may more\nplausibly resolve the predicted overproduction of massive MWG dwarf satellites.\n", "  Quantum transport measurements including the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS)\nand Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effects, universal conductance fluctuations (UCF), and\nweak anti-localization (WAL) have been carried out on epitaxial Bi thin films\n($10-70$ bilayers) on Si(111). The results show that while the film interior is\ninsulating all six surfaces of the Bi thin films are robustly metallic. We\npropose that these properties are the manifestation of a novel phenomenon,\nnamely, a topologically trivial bulk system can become topologically\nnon-trivial when it is made into a thin film. We stress that what's observed\nhere is entirely different from the predicted 2D topological insulating state\nin a single bilayer Bi where only the four side surfaces should possess\ntopologically protected gapless states.\n", "  Stock market comovements are examined using cointegration, Granger causality\ntests and nonlinear approaches in context of mutual information and\ncorrelations. Underlying data sets are affected by non-stationarities and\ntrends, we also apply AMF-DFA and AMF-DXA. We find only 170 pair of Stock\nmarkets cointegrated, and according to the Granger causality and mutual\ninformation, we realize that the strongest relations lies between emerging\nmarkets, and between emerging and frontier markets. According to scaling\nexponent given by AMF-DFA, $h(q=2)>1$, we find that all underlying data sets\nbelong to non-stationary process. According to EMH, only 8 markets are\nclassified in uncorrelated processes at $2\\sigma$ confidence interval. 6 Stock\nmarkets belong to anti-correlated class and dominant part of markets has memory\nin corresponding daily index prices during January 1995 to February 2014.\nNew-Zealand with $H=0.457\\pm0.004$ and Jordan with $H=0.602\\pm 0.006$ are far\nfrom EMH. The nature of cross-correlation exponents based on AMF-DXA is almost\nmultifractal for all pair of Stock markets. The empirical relation, $H_{xy}\\le\n[H_{xx}+H_{yy}]/2$, is confirmed. Mentioned relation for $q>0$ is also\nsatisfied while for $q<0$ there is a deviation from this relation confirming\nbehavior of markets for small fluctuations is affected by contribution of major\npair. For larger fluctuations, the cross-correlation contains information from\nboth local and global conditions. Width of singularity spectrum for\nauto-correlation and cross-correlation are $\\Delta \\alpha_{xx}\\in\n[0.304,0.905]$ and $\\Delta \\alpha_{xy}\\in [0.246,1.178]$, respectively. The\nwide range of singularity spectrum for cross-correlation confirms that the\nbilateral relation between Stock markets is more complex. The value of\n$\\sigma_{DCCA}$ indicates that all pairs of stock market studied in this time\ninterval belong to cross-correlated processes.\n", "  We report an experimental study on the temperature and number evolution of\ncold cesium atoms diffusively cooled inside a wall-coated glass cell by\nmeasuring the absorption profile of the 62S1/2 (F=4)-62P3/2 (F'=5) transition\nline with a weak probe laser in the evolution process. We found that the\ntemperature of the cold atoms first gradually decreases from 16 mK to 9 mK, and\nthen rapidly increases. The number of cold atoms first declines slowly from\n2.1*10^9 to 3.7*10^8 and then falls drastically. A theoretical model for the\nnumber evolution is built and includes the instantaneous temperature of the\ncold atoms and a fraction p, which represents the part of cold cesium atoms\nelastically reflected by the coated cell wall. The theory is overall in good\nagreement with the experimental result and a nonzero value is obtained for the\nfraction p, which indicates that the cold cesium atoms are not all heated to\nthe ambient temperature by a single collision with the coated cell wall. These\nresults can provide helpful insight for precision measurements based on diffuse\nlaser cooling.\n", "  In a hierarchical nanopatterning routine relying exclusively on self-assembly\nprocesses we combine crystal surface reconstruction, microphase separation of\ncopolymers, and selective metal diffusion to produce monodisperse metal\nnanostructures in highly regular arrays covering areas of square centimeters.\nIn-situ GISAXS during Fe nanostructure formation evidences the outstanding\nstructural order in the self-assembling system and hints at possibilities of\nsculpting nanostructures by external process parameters. Thus, we demonstrate\nthat nanopatterning via self-assembly is a competitive alternative to\nlithography-based routines, achieving comparable pattern regularity, feature\nsize, and patterned areas with considerably reduced effort. The option for\nin-situ investigations during pattern formation, the possibility of customizing\nthe nanostructure morphology, the capacity to pattern arbitrarily large areas\nwith ultra-high structure densities, and the potential of addressing the\nnanostructures individually enable numerous applications, e.g., in high-density\nmagnetic data storage, in functional nanostructured materials, e.g., for\nphotonics or catalysis, or in sensing based on surface plasmon resonances.\n", "  We consider stochastic processes arising from dynamical systems simply by\nevaluating an observable function along the orbits of the system and study\nmarked point processes associated to extremal observations of such time series\ncorresponding to exceedances of high thresholds. Each exceedance is marked by a\nquantity intended to measure the severity of the exceedance. In particular, we\nconsider marked point processes measuring the aggregate damage by adding all\nthe excesses over the threshold that mark each exceedance (AOT) or simply by\nadding the largest excesses in a cluster of exceedances (POT). We provide\nconditions to prove the convergence of such marked point processes to a\ncompound Poisson process, for whose multiplicity distribution we give an\nexplicit formula. These conditions are shown to follow from a strong form of\ndecay of correlations of the system. Moreover, we prove that the convergence of\nthe marked point processes for a `nice' first return induced map can be carried\nto the original system. The systems considered include non-uniformly expanding\nmaps (in one or higher dimensions), maps with intermittent fixed points or\nnon-recurrent critical points. For a general class of examples, the compound\nPoisson limit process is computed explicitly and, in particular, in the POT\ncase we obtain a generalised Pareto multiplicity distribution.\n", "  We put forward a functional renormalisation group approach for the direct\ncomputation of real time correlation functions, also applicable at finite\ntemperature and density. We construct a general class of regulators that\npreserve the space-time symmetries, and allows the computation of correlation\nfunctions at complex frequencies. This includes both imaginary time and real\ntime, and allows in particular the use of the plethora of imaginary time\nresults for the computation of real time correlation functions. We also discuss\nreal time computation on the Keldysh contour with general spatial momentum\nregulators. Both set-ups give access to the general momentum and frequency\ndependence of correlation functions.\n", "  Stokes parameters are a standard tool in quantum optics. They involve\naveraged intensities at exits of polarizers. If the overall measured intensity\nfluctuates, as e.g. for states with undefined photon numbers, the instances of\nits increased value contribute more to the parameters. One can introduce\nnormalized quantum Stokes operators. Operationally, for a given single run of\nthe experiment, their values are differences of measured intensities (or photon\nnumbers) at the two exits of a polarizer divided by their sum. Effects of\nintensity fluctuations are removed. Switching to normalized Stokes operators\nresults in more sensitive entanglement conditions. We also show a general\nmethod of deriving an entanglement indicator for optical fields which use\npolarization correlations, which starts with any two-qubit entanglement\nwitness. This allows to vastly expand the family of such indicators.\n", "  Multiple compound surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves can be guided by a\nstructure consisting of a sufficiently thick layer of metal sandwiched between\na homogeneous isotropic dielectric (HID) material and a dielectric structurally\nchiral material (SCM). The compound SPP waves are strongly bound to both\nmetal/dielectric interfaces when the thickness of the metal layer is comparable\nto the skin depth but just to one of the two interfaces when the thickness is\nmuch larger. The compound SPP waves differ in phase speed, attenuation rate,\nand field profile, even though all are excitable at the same frequency. Some\ncompound SPP waves are not greatly affected by the choice of the direction of\npropagation in the transverse plane but others are, depending on metal\nthickness. For fixed metal thickness, the number of compound SPP waves depends\non the relative permittivity of the HID material, which can be useful for\nsensing applications.\n", "  We report our studies on an intense source of cold cesium atoms based on a\ntwo-dimensional magneto-optical trap with independent axial cooling and\npushing. The new-designed source, proposed as 2D-HP MOT, uses hollow laser\nbeams for axial cooling and a thin pushing laser beam for cold atomic beam\nextraction. Regulated independently by the pushing beam, the atomic flux can be\nsubstantially optimized. The atomic flux maximum obtained in the 2D-HP MOT is\n$4.02\\times 10^{10}$ atoms/s, increased by 60 percent compared to the\ntraditional 2D$^+$ MOT in our experiment. Moreover, with the pushing power 10\n$\\mu$W and detuning $0\\Gamma$, the 2D-HP MOT can generate a rather intense cold\ncesium atomic beam with the concomitant light shift suppressed by 20 times in\nmagnitude. The axial velocity distribution of the cold cesium beams centers at\n6.8 m/s with a FMHW of about 2.8 m/s. The dependences of the atomic flux on the\npushing power and detuning are studied. The experimental results are in good\nagreement with the theoretical model.\n", "  Femtosecond X-ray irradiation of solids excites energetic photoelectrons that\nthermalize on a timescale of a few hundred femtoseconds. The thermalized\nelectrons exchange energy with the lattice and heat it up. Experiments with\nX-ray free-electron lasers have unveiled so far the details of the electronic\nthermalization. In this work we show that the data on transient optical\nreflectivity measured in GaAs irradiated with femtosecond X-ray pulses can be\nused to follow electron-lattice relaxation up to a few tens of picoseconds.\nWith a dedicated theoretical framework, we explain the so far unexplained\nreflectivity overshooting as a result of band-gap shrinking. We also obtain\npredictions for a timescale of electron-lattice thermalization, initiated by\nconduction band electrons in the temperature regime of a few eVs. The\nconduction and valence band carriers were then strongly non-isothermal. The\npresented scheme is of general applicability and can stimulate further studies\nof relaxation within X-ray excited narrow band-gap semiconductors.\n", "  To a given algebraic curve we assign an infinite family of quantum curves\n(Schr\\\"odinger equations), which are in one-to-one correspondence with, and\nhave the structure of, Virasoro singular vectors. For a spectral curve of a\nmatrix model we build such quantum curves out of an appropriate representation\nof the Virasoro algebra, encoded in the structure of the\n$\\alpha/\\beta$-deformed matrix integral and its loop equation. We generalize\nthis construction to a large class of algebraic curves by means of a refined\ntopological recursion. We also specialize this construction to various specific\nmatrix models with polynomial and logarithmic potentials, and among other\nresults, show that various ingredients familiar in the study of conformal field\ntheory (Ward identities, correlation functions and a representation of Virasoro\noperators acting thereon, BPZ equations) arise upon specialization of our\nformalism to the multi-Penner matrix model.\n", "  The fractional quantum Hall effect, being one of the most studied phenomena\nin condensed matter physics during the past thirty years, has generated many\ngroundbreaking new ideas and concepts. Very early on it was realized that the\nzoo of emerging states of matter would need to be understood in a systematic\nmanner. The first attempts to do this, by Haldane and Halperin, set an agenda\nfor further work which has continued to this day. Since that time the idea of\nhierarchies of quasiparticles condensing to form new states has been a pillar\nof our understanding of fractional quantum Hall physics. In the thirty years\nthat have passed since then, a number of new directions of thought have\nadvanced our understanding of fractional quantum Hall states, and have extended\nit in new and unexpected ways. Among these directions is the extensive use of\ntopological quantum field theories and conformal field theories, the\napplication of the ideas of composite bosons and fermions, and the study of\nnonabelian quantum Hall liquids. This article aims to present a comprehensive\noverview of this field, including the most recent developments.\n", "  In this paper we prove new constructive coercivity estimates and convergence\nto equilibrium for a spatially non-homogeneous system of Landau equations with\nsoft potentials. We show that the nonlinear collision operator conserves each\nspecies' mass, total momentum, total energy and that the Boltzmann entropy is\nnonincreasing along solutions of the system. The entropy decay vanishes if and\nonly if the Boltzmann distributions of the single species are Maxwellians with\nthe same momentum and energy. A linearization of the collision operator is\ncomputed, which has the same conservation properties as its nonlinear\ncounterpart. We show that the linearized system dissipates a quadratic entropy,\nand prove existence of spectral gap and exponential decay of the solution\ntowards the global equilibrium.\n", "  Photon-photon scattering in vacuum is extremely weak. However, strong\neffective interactions between single photons can be realized by employing\nstrong light-matter coupling. These interactions are a fundamental building\nblock for quantum optics, bringing many-body physics to the photonic world and\nproviding important resources for quantum photonic devices and for optical\nmetrology. In this Colloquium, we review the physics of strongly-interacting\nphotons in one-dimensional systems with no optical confinement along the\npropagation direction. We focus on two recently-demonstrated experimental\nrealizations: superconducting qubits coupled to open transmission lines, and\ninteracting Rydberg atoms in a cold gas. Advancements in the theoretical\nunderstanding of these systems are presented in complementary formalisms and\ncompared to experimental results. The experimental achievements are summarized\nalongside a description of the quantum optical effects and quantum devices\nemerging from them.\n", "  In this paper, we construct a Lax pair for the classical hyperbolic van\nDiejen system with two independent coupling parameters. Built upon this\nconstruction, we show that the dynamics can be solved by a projection method,\nwhich in turn allows us to initiate the study of the scattering properties. As\na consequence, we prove the equivalence between the first integrals provided by\nthe eigenvalues of the Lax matrix and the family of van Diejen's commuting\nHamiltonians. Also, at the end of the paper, we propose a candidate for the Lax\nmatrix of the hyperbolic van Diejen system with three independent coupling\nconstants.\n", "  Ferromagnetism is a manifestation of strong repulsive interactions between\nitinerant fermions in condensed matter. Whether short-ranged repulsion alone is\nsufficient to stabilize ferromagnetic correlations in the absence of other\neffects, like peculiar band dispersions or orbital couplings, is however\nunclear. Here, we investigate ferromagnetism in the minimal framework of an\nultracold Fermi gas with short-range repulsive interactions tuned via a\nFeshbach resonance. While fermion pairing characterises the ground state, our\nexperiments provide signatures suggestive of a metastable Stoner-like\nferromagnetic phase supported by strong repulsion in excited scattering states.\nWe probe the collective spin response of a two-spin mixture engineered in a\nmagnetic domain-wall-like configuration, and reveal a substantial increase of\nspin susceptibility while approaching a critical repulsion strength. Beyond\nthis value, we observe the emergence of a time-window of domain immiscibility,\nindicating the metastability of the initial ferromagnetic state. Our findings\nestablish an important connection between dynamical and equilibrium properties\nof strongly-correlated Fermi gases, pointing to the existence of a\nferromagnetic instability.\n", "  What can we learn about controlling a system solely from its underlying\nnetwork structure? Here we adapt a recently developed framework for control of\nnetworks governed by a broad class of nonlinear dynamics that includes the\nmajor dynamic models of biological, technological, and social processes. This\nfeedback-based framework provides realizable node overrides that steer a system\ntowards any of its natural long term dynamic behaviors, regardless of the\nspecific functional forms and system parameters. We use this framework on\nseveral real networks, identify the topological characteristics that underlie\nthe predicted node overrides, and compare its predictions to those of\nstructural controllability in control theory. Finally, we demonstrate this\nframework's applicability in dynamic models of gene regulatory networks and\nidentify nodes whose override is necessary for control in the general case, but\nnot in specific model instances.\n", "  Manipulation of magnetization with ultrashort laser pulses is promising for\ninformation storage device applications. The dynamic of the magnetization\nresponse depends on the energy transfer from the photons to the spins during\nthe initial laser excitation. A material of special interest for magnetic\nstorage is FePt nanoparticles , on which optical writing with optical angular\nmomentum was demonstrated recently by Lambert et al., although the mechanism\nremained unclear. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically the\nall-optical switching of FePt nanoparticles. We show that the magnetization\nswitching is a stochastic process. We develop a complete multiscale model which\nallows us to optimize the number of laser shots needed to write the\nmagnetization of high anisotropy FePt nanoparticles in our experiments. We\nconclude that only angular momentum induced optically by the inverse Faraday\neffect will provide switching with one single femtosecond laser pulse.\n", "  We consider a class of models with extra complex scalars that are charged\nunder both the Standard Model and a hidden strongly coupled $SU(N)_H$ gauge\nsector, and discuss the scenarios where the new scalars are identified as the\nmessenger fields that mediate the spontaneously broken supersymmetries from the\nhidden sector to the visible sector. The new scalars are embedded into 5-plets\nand 10-plets of an $SU(5)_V$ gauge group that potentially unifies the Standard\nModel gauge groups. The Higgs bosons remain as elementary particles. In the\nsupersymmetrized version of this class of models, vector-like fermions whose\nleft-handed components are superperpartners of the new scalars are introduced.\nDue to the hidden strong force, the new low-energy scalars hadronize before\ndecaying and thus evade the common direct searches of the supersymmetric\nsquarks. This can be seen as a gauge mediation scenario with the scalar\nmessenger fields forming low-energy bound states. We also discuss the\npossibility that among the tower of bound states formed under hidden strong\ndynamics (at least the TeV scale) one of them is the dark matter candidate, as\nwell as the collider signatures (e.g. diphoton, diboson or dijet) of the models\nthat may show up in the near future.\n", "  Electronic circuits are useful tools for studying potential dynamical\nbehaviors of synthetic genetic networks. The circuit models are complementary\nto numerical simulations of the networks, especially providing a framework for\nverification of dynamical behaviors in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic\nnoise of the electrical systems. Here we present an improved version of our\nprevious design of an electronic analog of genetic networks that includes the\n3-gene Repressilator and we show conversions between model parameters and real\ncircuit component values to mimic the numerical results in experiments.\nImportant features of the circuit design include the incorporation of chemical\nkinetics representing Hill function inhibition, quorum sensing coupling, and\nadditive noise. Especially, we make a circuit design for a systematic change of\ninitial conditions in experiment, which is critically important for studies of\ndynamical systems' behavior, particularly, when it shows multistability. This\nimproved electronic analog of the synthetic genetic network allows us to extend\nour investigations from an isolated Repressilator to coupled Repressilators and\nto reveal the dynamical behavior's complexity.\n", "  We analytically solved the QED $\\otimes$ QCD coupled DGLAP evolution\nequations at leading order (LO) quantum electrodynamics (QED) and next to\nleading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) approximations, using the\nLaplace transform method and then computed the proton structure function in\nterms of the unpolarized parton distributions functions. Our analyitical\nsolutions for parton densities are in good agreement with those from APFEL (A\nPDF Evolution Library) (Computer Physics Communications 185, 1647-1668 (2014))\nand CT14QED (Phys. Rev. D 93, 114015 (2016)) global parameterizations. We also\ncompared the proton structure function, $F_{2}^{p}(x,Q^{2})$, with experimental\ndata released by the ZEUS and H1 collaborations at HERA. There is a nice\nagreement between them in the range of low and high x and $Q^{2}$.\n", "  This paper presents an improved version of the previously proposed\nself-consistent drift-diffusion-reaction model correcting for non-physical\nbehavior at longer time scales. To this end a novel boundary condition is\nemployed that takes into account the effect of tertiary electrons and a fully\ndynamic trap-assisted generation-recombination mechanism is implemented.\nSensitivity of the model with respect to material parameters is investigated\nand a calibration procedure is developed that reproduces experimental\nyield-energy curves for uncharged insulators. Long-time charging and yield\nvariations are analyzed for stationary defocused and focused beams as well as\nmoving beams dynamically scanning composite insulators.\n", "  We present a quantum algorithm for simulating the dynamics of a\nfirst-quantized Hamiltonian in real space based on the truncated Taylor series\nalgorithm. We avoid the possibility of singularities by applying various\ncutoffs to the system and using a high-order finite difference approximation to\nthe kinetic energy operator. We find that our algorithm can simulate $\\eta$\ninteracting particles using a number of calculations of the pairwise\ninteractions that scales, for a fixed spatial grid spacing, as\n$\\tilde{O}(\\eta^2)$, versus the $\\tilde{O}(\\eta^5)$ time required by previous\nmethods (assuming the number of orbitals is proportional to $\\eta$), and scales\nsuper-polynomially better with the error tolerance than algorithms based on the\nLie-Trotter-Suzuki product formula. Finally, we analyze discretization errors\nthat arise from the spatial grid and show that under some circumstances these\nerrors can remove the exponential speedups typically afforded by quantum\nsimulation.\n", "  We consider the torsional completion of gravity with spinor and scalar\nfields: we show how in this environment conditions of extreme symmetry or\nspecific approximations imply the scalar field to be constant, so that\nslow-roll takes place and inflation occurs.\n", "  We address an unexpectedly large rectification using a simple quantum wire\nwith correlated site potentials. The external electric field, associated with\nvoltage bias, leads to unequal charge currents for two different polarities of\nexternal bias and this effect is further enhanced by incorporating the\nasymmetry in wire-to-electrode coupling. Our calculations suggest that in some\ncases almost cent percent rectification is obtained for a wide bias window.\nThis performance is valid against disorder configurations and thus we can\nexpect an experimental verification of our theoretical analysis in near future.\n", "  Dwarf spheroidals are low-luminosity satellite galaxies of the Milky Way\nhighly dominated by dark matter (DM). Therefore, they are prime targets to\nsearch for signals from dark matter annihilation using gamma-ray observations.\nWhile the typical assumption is that the dark matter density profile of these\nsatellite galaxies can be described by a spherical symmetric\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, recent observational data of stellar\nkinematics suggest that the DM halos around these galaxies are better described\nby axisymmetric profiles. Motivated by such evidence, we analyse about seven\nyears of PASS8 Fermi data for seven classical dwarf galaxies, including Draco,\nadopting both the widely used NFW profile and observationally-motivated\naxisymmetric density profiles. For four of the selected dwarfs (Sextans,\nCarina, Sculptor and Fornax) axisymmetric mass models suggest a cored density\nprofile rather than the commonly adopted cusped profile. We found that upper\nlimits on the annihilation cross section for some of these dwarfs are\nsignificantly higher than the ones achieved using an NFW profile. Therefore,\nupper limits in the literature obtained using spherical symmetric cusped\nprofiles, such as the NFW, might be overestimated. Our results show that it is\nextremely important to use observationally motivated density profiles going\nbeyond the usually adopted NFW in order to obtain accurate constraints on the\ndark matter annihilation cross section.\n", "  Collective excitation modes in solid state systems play a central role in\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics, cavity optomechanics, and quantum magnonics.\nIn the latter, quanta of collective excitation modes in a ferromagnet, called\nmagnons, interact with qubits to provide the nonlinearity necessary to access\nquantum phenomena in magnonics. A key ingredient for future quantum magnonics\nsystems is the ability to probe magnon states. Here we observe individual\nmagnons in a millimeter-sized ferromagnet coherently coupled to a\nsuperconducting qubit. Specifically, we resolve magnon number states in\nspectroscopic measurements of a transmon qubit with the hybrid system in the\nstrong dispersive regime. This enables us to detect a change in the magnetic\ndipole of the ferromagnet equivalent to a single spin flipped among more than\n$10^{19}$ spins. The strong dispersive regime of quantum magnonics opens up the\npossibility of encoding superconducting qubits into non-classical magnon\nstates, potentially providing a coherent interface between a superconducting\nquantum processor and optical photons.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze assortativity of preferential attachment models. We\ndeal with a wide class of preferential attachment models (PA-class). It was\npreviously shown that the degree distribution in all models of the PA-class\nfollows a power law. Also, the global and the average local clustering\ncoefficients were analyzed. We expand these results by analyzing the\nassortativity property of the PA-class of models. Namely, we analyze the\nbehavior of $d_{nn}(d)$ which is the average degree of a neighbor of a vertex\nof degree $d$.\n", "  We show that matrix elements of functions of $N\\times N$ Wigner matrices\nfluctuate on a scale of order $N^{-1/2}$ and we identify the limiting\nfluctuation. Our result holds for any function $f$ of the matrix that has\nbounded variation and thus considerably relaxes the regularity requirement\nimposed in [7,11].\n", "  The standard galaxy formation theory assumes that baryons and dark matter are\ninitially well-mixed before becoming segregated due to radiative cooling. We\nuse non-radiative hydrodynamical simulations to explicitly examine this\nassumption and find that baryons and dark matter can also be segregated because\nof different physics obeyed by gas and dark matter during the build-up of the\nhalo. As a result, baryons in many haloes do not originate from the same\nLagrangian region as the dark matter. When using the fraction of corresponding\ndark matter and gas particles in the initial conditions (the \"paired fraction\")\nas a proxy of the dark matter and gas segregation strength of a halo, on\naverage about $25$ percent of the baryonic and dark matter of the final halo\nare segregated in the initial conditions. This is at odds with the assumption\nof the standard galaxy formation model. A consequence of this effect is that\nthe baryons and dark matter of the same halo initially experience different\ntidal torques and thus their angular momentum vectors are often misaligned. The\ndegree of the misalignment is largely preserved during later halo assembly and\ncan be understood with the tidal torque theory. The result challenges the\nprecision of some semi-analytical approaches which utilize dark matter halo\nmerger trees to infer properties of gas associated to dark matter haloes.\n", "  Manipulating free-space electron wave functions with laser fields can bring\nabout new electron-optical elements for transmission electron microscopy. In\nparticular, a Zernike phase plate would enable high-contrast imaging of soft\nmatter, leading to new opportunities in structural biology and materials\nscience. A Zernike plate can be implemented using a tight, intense CW laser\nfocus that shifts the phase of the electron wave by the ponderomotive\npotential. Here, we use a near-concentric cavity to focus 7.5 kW of circulating\nlaser power at 1064 nm into a 7 $\\mu$m waist, setting a record for CW laser\nintensity and establishing a pathway to ponderomotive phase contrast TEM.\n", "  The most important practical characteristic of a Josephson junction is its\ncritical current. The shape of the junction determines the specific form of the\nmagnetic-field dependence of the its Josephson current. Here we address the\nmagnetic diffraction patterns of specially shaped planar Josephson tunnel\njunctions. We focus on a wide ensemble of generalized ellipses, called\nsuperellipses, which retain the second order symmetry. We analyze the\nimplications of this type of isometry and derive the explicit expressions for\nthe threshold curves of superelliptic Josephson junctions. A detailed study is\nmade of their magnetic patterns with emphasis on the rate of decay of the\nsidelobes amplitudes for large field amplitudes.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a bulk viscosity model in the Eckart approach for a\nspatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. We have included\nradiation and dark energy, assumed as perfect fluids, and dark matter treated\nas an imperfect fluid having bulk viscosity. We also introduce an interaction\nterm between the dark matter and dark energy components. Considering that the\nbulk viscosity is proportional to the dark matter energy density and imposing a\ncomplete cosmological dynamics, we find bounds on the bulk viscosity in order\nto reproduce a matter-dominated era (MDE). This constraint is independent of\nthe interaction term. Some late time phantom solutions are mathematically\npossible. However, the constraint imposed by a MDE restricts the interaction\nparameter, in the phantom solutions, to a region consistent with a null value,\neliminating the possibility of late time stable solutions with $w<-1$. From the\ndifferent cases that we study, the only possible scenario, with bulk viscosity\nand interaction term, belongs to the quintessence region. In this latter case,\nwe find bounds on the interaction parameter compatible with latest\nobservational data.\n", "  We present the first self-consistent direct calculation of a spectral\nfunction in the framework of the Functional Renormalization Group. The study is\ncarried out in the relativistic $O(N)$ model, where the full momentum\ndependence of the propagators in the complex plane as well as\nmomentum-dependent vertices are considered. The analysis is supplemented by a\ncomparative study of the Euclidean momentum dependence and of the complex\nmomentum dependence on the level of spectral functions. This work lays the\ngroundwork for the computation of full spectral functions in more complex\nsystems.\n", "  Ultracold molecules offer remarkable opportunities to study chemical\nreactions at nearly zero temperature. Although significant progresses have been\nachieved in exploring ultracold bimolecular reactions, the investigations are\nusually limited to measurements of the overall loss rates of the reactants.\nDetection of the reaction products will shed new light on understanding the\nreaction mechanism and provide a unique opportunity to study the state-to-state\nreaction dynamics. Here we report on the direct observation of an exoergic\natom-exchange reaction in an ultracold atom-dimer mixture. Both the atom and\nmolecule products are observed and the quantum states are characterized. By\nchanging the magnetic field, the reaction can be switched on or off, and the\nreaction rate can be controlled. The reaction is efficient and we have measured\na state-to-state reaction rate of up to $1.1(3)\\times10^{-9}$cm$^{3}/$s from\nthe time evolution of the reactants and products. Our work represents the\nrealization of a controlled quantum state selected/resolved ultracold reaction.\nThe atom-exchange reaction observed is also an effective spin-exchange\ninteraction between the Feshbach molecules and the fermionic atoms and may be\nexploited to implement quantum simulations of the Kondo effect with ultracold\natoms and molecules.\n", "  Over the past $\\sim\\!\\! 10$ years, the topic of the nucleon's nonperturbative\nor $\\textit{intrinsic}$ charm (IC) content has enjoyed something of a\nrenaissance, largely motivated by theoretical developments involving quark\nmodelers and PDF fitters. In this talk I will briefly describe the importance\nof intrinsic charm to various issues in high-energy phenomenology, and survey\nrecent progress in constraining its overall normalization and contribution to\nthe momentum sum rule of the nucleon. I end with the conclusion that progress\non the side of calculation has now placed the onus on experiment to\nunambiguously resolve the proton's intrinsic charm component.\n", "  Soft x-rays were applied to induce graphitization of diamond through a\nnon-thermal solid-to-solid phase transition. This process was observed within\npoly-crystalline diamond with a time-resolved experiment using ultrashort soft\nx-ray pulses of duration 52.5 fs and cross correlated by an optical pulse of\nduration 32.8 fs. This scheme enabled for the first time the measurement of a\nphase transition on a timescale of ~150 fs. Excellent agreement between\nexperiment and theoretical predictions was found, using a dedicated code that\nfollowed the non-equilibrium evolution of the irradiated diamond including all\ntransient electronic and structural changes. These observations confirm that\nsoft x-rays can induce a non-thermal ultrafast solid-to-solid phase transition\non a hundred femtosecond timescale.\n", "  A Dirac fermion in a topological Dirac semimetal is a quadruple-degenerate\nquasi-particle state with a relativistic linear dispersion. Breaking either\ntime-reversal or inversion symmetry turns this system into a Weyl semimetal\nthat hosts double-degenerate Weyl fermion states with opposite chiralities.\nThese two kinds of quasi-particles, although described by a relativistic Dirac\nequation, do not necessarily obey Lorentz invariance, allowing the existence of\nso-called type-II fermions. Recent theoretical discovery of type-II Weyl\nfermions evokes the prediction of type-II Dirac fermions in PtSe$_2$-type\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, expecting an experimental confirmation. Here,\nwe report an experimental realization of type-II Dirac fermions in PdTe$_2$ by\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with {\\it ab-initio} band\ncalculations. Our experimental finding makes the first example that has both\nsuperconductivity and type-II Dirac fermions, which turns the topological\nmaterial research into a new phase.\n", "  We consider the explicit construction of resource states for\nmeasurement-based quantum information processing. We concentrate on\nspecial-purpose resource states that are capable to perform a certain operation\nor task, where we consider unitary Clifford circuits as well as non-trace\npreserving completely positive maps, more specifically probabilistic operations\nincluding Clifford operations and Pauli measurements. We concentrate on $1 \\to\nm$ and $m \\to 1$ operations, i.e. operations that map one input qubit to $m$\noutput qubits or vice versa. Examples of such operations include encoding and\ndecoding in quantum error correction, entanglement purification or entanglement\nswapping. We provide a general framework to construct optimal resource states\nfor complex tasks that are combinations of these elementary building blocks.\nAll resource states only contain input and output qubits, and are hence of\nminimal size. We obtain a stabilizer description of the resulting resource\nstates, which we also translate into a circuit pattern to experimentally\ngenerate these states. In particular, we derive recurrence relations at the\nlevel of stabilizers as key analytical tool to generate explicit (graph-)\ndescriptions of families of resource states. This allows us to explicitly\nconstruct resource states for encoding, decoding and syndrome readout for\nconcatenated quantum error correction codes, code switchers, multiple rounds of\nentanglement purification, quantum repeaters and combinations thereof (such as\nresource states for entanglement purification of encoded states).\n", "  We develop and apply new techniques in order to uncover galaxy rotation\ncurves (RC) systematics. Considering that an ideal dark matter (DM) profile\nshould yield RCs that have no bias towards any particular radius, we find that\nthe Burkert DM profile satisfies the test, while the Navarro-Frenk-While (NFW)\nprofile has a tendency of better fitting the region between one and two disc\nscale lengths than the inner disc scale length region. Our sample indicates\nthat this behaviour happens to more than 75% of the galaxies fitted with an NFW\nhalo. Also, this tendency does not weaken by considering \"large\" galaxies, for\ninstance those with $M_*\\gtrsim 10^{10} M_\\odot$. Besides the tests on the\nhomogeneity of the fits, we also use a sample of 62 galaxies of diverse types\nto perform tests on the quality of the overall fit of each galaxy, and to\nsearch for correlations with stellar mass, gas mass and the disc scale length.\nIn particular, we find that only 13 galaxies are better fitted by the NFW halo;\nand that even for the galaxies with $M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_\\odot$ the Burkert\nprofile either fits as good as, or better than, the NFW profile. This result is\nrelevant since different baryonic effects important for the smaller galaxies,\nlike supernova feedback and dynamical friction from baryonic clumps, indicate\nthat at such large stellar masses the NFW profile should be preferred over the\nBurkert profile. Hence, our results either suggest a new baryonic effect or a\nchange of the dark matter physics.\n", "  This study aims to make use of two concepts in the field of aeroacoustics; an\nanalogy with relativity, and Geometric Algebra. The analogy with relativity has\nbeen investigated in physics and cosmology, but less has been done to use this\nwork in the field of aeroacoustics. Despite being successfully applied to a\nvariety of fields, Geometric Algebra has yet to be applied to acoustics. Our\naim is to apply these concepts first to a simple problem in aeroacoustics,\nsound propagation in uniform flow, and the more general problem of acoustic\npropagation in non-uniform flows. By using Geometric Algebra we are able to\nprovide a simple geometric interpretation to a transformation commonly used to\nsolve for sound fields in uniform flow. We are then able to extend this concept\nto an acoustic space-time applicable to irrotational, barotropic background\nflows. This geometrical framework is used to naturally derive the requirements\nthat must be satisfied by the background flow in order for us to be able to\nsolve for sound propagation in the non-uniform flow using the simple wave\nequation. We show that this is not possible in the most general situation, and\nprovide an explicit expression that must be satisfied for the transformation to\nexist. We show that this requirement is automatically satisfied if the\nbackground flow is incompressible or uniform, and for both these cases derive\nan explicit transformation. In addition to a new physical interpretation for\nthe transformation, we show that unlike previous investigations, our work is\napplicable to any frequency.\n", "  The question of why and how animal and human groups form temporarily stable\nhierarchical organizations has long been a great challenge from the point of\nquantitative interpretations. The prevailing observation/consensus is that a\nhierarchical social or technological structure is optimal considering a variety\nof aspects. Here we introduce a simple quantitative interpretation of this\nsituation using an approach reminiscent of those developed for describing\ncomplex behaviour in terms of statistical mechanics. We look for the optimum of\nthe efficiency function $E_{\\rm eff}=1/N \\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} a_i a_j$ with\n$J_{ij}$ denoting the nature of the interaction between the units $i$ and $j$\nand $a_i$ standing for the ability of member $i$ to contribute to the\nefficiency of the system. Notably, this expression for $E_{\\rm eff}$ has a\nsimilar structure to that of the energy as defined for spin-glasses. There is,\nhowever, an essential and novel feature of our approach: instead of optimizing\nby looking for a locally optimal state of the units in the nodes of a\npre-defined network, we search for extrema in the complex efficiency landscape\nby finding locally optimal network topologies using a standard Monte Carlo\nmethod.\n", "  We discuss the use of 3D printing to physically visualize (materialize) fluid\nflow structures. Such 3D models can serve as a refreshing hands-on means to\ngain deeper physical insights into the formation of complex coherent structures\nin fluid flows. In this short paper, we present a general procedure for taking\n3D flow field data and producing a file format that can be supplied to a 3D\nprinter, with two examples of 3D printed flow structures. A sample code to\nperform this process is also provided. 3D printed flow structures can not only\ndeepen our understanding of fluid flows but also allow us to showcase our\nresearch findings to be held up-close in educational and outreach settings.\n", "  In a recent contribution, we introduced and applied a detector-independent\nmethod to uncover nonclassicality. Here, we extend those techniques and give\nmore details on the performed analysis. We derive a general theory of the\npositive-operator-valued measure that describes multiplexing layouts with\narbitrary detectors. From the resulting quantum version of a multinomial\nstatistics, we infer nonclassicality probes based on a matrix of normally\nordered moments. We discuss these criteria and apply the theory to our data\nwhich are measured with superconducting transition-edge sensors. Our experiment\nproduces heralded multi-photon states from a parametric down-conversion light\nsource. We show that the known notions of sub-Poisson and sub-binomial light\ncan be deduced from our general approach, and we establish the concept of\nsub-multinomial light, which is shown to outperform the former two concepts of\nnonclassicality for our data.\n", "  The transverse momentum distributions of the strange and double-strange\nhyperon resonances ($\\Sigma(1385)^{\\pm}$, $\\Xi(1530)^{0}$) produced in p-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV were measured in the rapidity range\n$-0.5< y_{\\rm{CMS}}<0$ for event classes corresponding to different\ncharged-particle multiplicity densities, $\\langle{\\rm d}N_{\\rm{ch}}/{\\rm\nd}\\eta_{\\rm{lab}}\\rangle$. The mean transverse momentum values are presented as\na function of $\\langle{\\rm d}N_{\\rm{ch}}/{\\rm d}\\eta_{\\rm{lab}}\\rangle$, as\nwell as a function of the particle masses and compared with previous results on\nhyperon production. The integrated yield ratios of excited to ground-state\nhyperons are constant as a function of $\\langle{\\rm d}N_{\\rm{ch}}/{\\rm\nd}\\eta_{\\rm{lab}}\\rangle$. The equivalent ratios to pions exhibit an increase\nwith $\\langle{\\rm d}N_{\\rm{ch}}/{\\rm d}\\eta_{\\rm{lab}}\\rangle$, depending on\ntheir strangeness content.\n", "  We show that the longitudinal beam polarization option at a future\nelectron-positron collider provides an unambiguous distinction between\nlow-scale seesaw models of neutrino mass. This is possible due to the fact that\nthe pair production cross section of the heavy neutrinos in seesaw models is\nsensitive to the polarization of the initial lepton beams, and for a suitable\nchoice of the polarization, shows a clear enhancement over the unpolarized\ncross section. More interestingly, the choice of the beam polarization for\nwhich the enhancement is maximum is governed by the size of the light-heavy\nneutrino mixing parameter. We also find that using this effect, one can probe a\npreviously uncharted parameter space of the left-right seesaw model, which is\ncomplementary to the existing searches at both energy and intensity frontiers.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled mechanical oscillators\nwith general linear couplings to two uncorrelated thermal baths at temperatures\n$T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively. We obtain the complete solution of the\nHeisenberg-Langevin equations, which reveal a coherent mixing among the normal\nmodes of the oscillators as a consequence of their off-diagonal couplings to\nthe baths. Unique renormalization aspects resulting from this mixing are\ndiscussed. Diagonal and off-diagonal (coherence) correlation functions are\nobtained analytically in the case of strictly Ohmic baths with different\ncouplings in the strong and weak coupling regimes. An asymptotic\nnon-equilibrium stationary state emerges for which we obtain the complete\nexpressions for the correlations and coherence. Remarkably the coherence\nsurvives in the high temperature, classical limit for $T_1 \\neq T_2$. In the\ncase of vanishing detuning between the oscillator normal modes both coupling to\none and the same bath the coherence retains memory of the initial conditions at\nlong time. A perturbative expansion of the early time evolution reveals that\nthe emergence of coherence is a consequence of the entanglement between the\nnormal modes of the oscillators \\emph{mediated} by their couplings to the\nbaths. This \\emph{suggests} the survival of entanglement in the high\ntemperature limit for different temperatures of the baths which is essentially\na consequence of the non-equilibrium nature of the asymptotic stationary state.\nAn out of equilibrium setup with small detuning and large $|T_1- T_2|$ produces\nnon-vanishing steady-state coherence and entanglement in the high temperature\nlimit of the baths.\n", "  We study the time dependence of the entanglement between two quantum wires\nafter suddenly connecting them via tunneling through an impurity. The result at\nlarge times is given by the well known formula $S(t) \\approx {1\\over 3}\\ln\n{t}$. We show that the intermediate time regime can be described by a universal\ncross-over formula $S=F(tT_K)$, where $T_K$ is the crossover (Kondo)\ntemperature: the function $F$ describes the dynamical \"healing\" of the system\nat large times. We discuss how to obtain analytic information about $F$ in the\ncase of an integrable quantum impurity problem using the massless Form-Factors\nformalism for twist and boundary condition changing operators. Our results are\nconfirmed by density matrix renormalization group calculations and exact free\nfermion numerics.\n", "  The \"Disk of satellites\" (DoS) around Milky Way is a highly debated topic\nwith conflicting interpretations of observations and their theoretical models.\nWe perform a comprehensive analysis of all dwarfs detected in the Milky Way and\nfind that the DoS structure depends strongly on the plane identification method\nand the sample size. In particular, we demonstrate that a smaller sample size\nproduces a higher anisotropy of the spatial distribution and a stronger\nclustering of the angular momentum of the satellites. Moreover, we calculate\nthe evolution of the 11 classical satellites with proper motion measurements\nand find that the thin DoS they currently reside in is transient. Furthermore,\nwe analyze two cosmological simulations using the same initial conditions of a\nMilky Way-sized galaxy, an N-body run with dark matter only and a hydrodynamic\none with both baryonic and dark matter, and find that the hydrodynamic\nsimulation produces more anisotropic distribution of satellites than the N-body\none. Our results suggest that an anisotropic distribution of satellites in\ngalaxies can originate from baryonic processes in the hierarchical structure\nformation model, but the claimed highly-flattened, coherently-rotating DoS of\nthe Milky Way may be a small-number selection effect. These findings may help\nresolve the contradictory claims of DoS in other galaxies and the discrepancy\namong numerical simulations.\n", "  We present results on transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) and rapidity ($y$)\ndifferential production cross sections, mean transverse momentum and mean\ntransverse momentum square of inclusive J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ at forward\nrapidity ($2.5<y<4$) as well as $\\psi(2S)$-to-J/$\\psi$ cross section ratios.\nThese quantities are measured in pp collisions at center of mass energies\n$\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ and 13 TeV with the ALICE detector. Both charmonium states are\nreconstructed in the dimuon decay channel, using the muon spectrometer. A\ncomprehensive comparison to inclusive charmonium cross sections measured at\n$\\sqrt{s}=2.76$, 7 and 8 TeV is performed. A comparison to non-relativistic\nquantum chromodynamics and fixed-order next-to-leading logarithm calculations,\nwhich describe prompt and non-prompt charmonium production respectively, is\nalso presented. A good description of the data is obtained over the full\n$p_{\\rm T}$ range, provided that both contributions are summed. In particular,\nit is found that for $p_{\\rm T}>15$ GeV/$c$ the non-prompt contribution reaches\nup to 50% of the total charmonium yield.\n", "  Gluon-induced processes such as Higgs production typically exhibit large\nperturbative corrections. These partially arise from large virtual corrections\nto the gluon form factor, which at timelike momentum transfer contains Sudakov\nlogarithms evaluated at negative arguments $\\ln^2(-1) = -\\pi^2$. It has been\nobserved that resumming these terms in the timelike form factor leads to a much\nimproved perturbative convergence for the total cross section. We discuss how\nto consistently incorporate the resummed form factor into the perturbative\npredictions for generic cross sections differential in the Born kinematics,\nincluding in particular the Higgs rapidity spectrum. We verify that this indeed\nimproves the perturbative convergence, leading to smaller and more reliable\nperturbative uncertainties, and that this is not affected by cancellations\nbetween resummed and unresummed contributions. Combining both fixed-order and\nresummation uncertainties, the perturbative uncertainty for the total cross\nsection at N$^3$LO$+$N$^3$LL$^\\prime_\\varphi$ is about a factor of two smaller\nthan at N$^3$LO. The perturbative uncertainty of the rapidity spectrum at\nNNLO$+$NNLL$^\\prime_\\varphi$ is similarly reduced compared to NNLO. We also\nstudy the analogous resummation for quark-induced processes, namely Higgs\nproduction through bottom quark annihilation and the Drell-Yan rapidity\nspectrum. For the former the resummation leads to a small improvement, while\nfor the latter it confirms the already small uncertainties of the fixed-order\npredictions.\n", "  In this paper, we propose an optimized field/circuit coupling approach for\nthe simulation of magnetothermal transients in superconducting magnets. The\napproach improves the convergence of the iterative coupling scheme between a\nmagnetothermal partial differential model and an electrical lumped-element\ncircuit. Such a multi-physics, multi-rate and multi-scale problem requires a\nconsistent formulation and a dedicated framework to tackle the challenging\ntransient effects occurring at both circuit and magnet level during normal\noperation and in case of faults. We derive an equivalent magnet model at the\ncircuit side for the linear and the non-linear settings and discuss the\nconvergence of the overall scheme in the framework of optimized Schwarz\nmethods. The efficiency of the developed approach is illustrated by a numerical\nexample of an accelerator dipole magnet with accompanying protection system.\n", "  Radiative heat transfer between uniform plates is bounded by the narrow range\nand limited contribution of surface waves. Using a combination of analytical\ncalculations and numerical gradient-based optimization, we show that such a\nlimitation can be overcome in complicated multilayer geometries, allowing the\nscattering and coupling rates of slab resonances to be altered over a broad\nrange of evanescent wavevectors. We conclude that while the radiative flux\nbetween two inhomogeneous slabs can only be weakly enhanced, the flux between a\ndipolar particle and an inhomogeneous slab---proportional to the local density\nof states---can be orders of magnitude larger, albeit at the expense of\nincreased frequency selectivity. A brief discussion of hyperbolic metamaterials\nshows that they provide far less enhancement than optimized inhomogeneous\nslabs.\n", "  When random quantum spin chains are submitted to some periodic Floquet\ndriving, the eigenstates of the time-evolution operator over one period can be\nlocalized in real space. For the case of periodic quenches between two\nHamiltonians (or periodic kicks), where the time-evolution operator over one\nperiod reduces to the product of two simple transfer matrices, we propose a\nBlock-self-dual renormalization procedure to construct the localized\neigenstates of the Floquet dynamics. We also discuss the corresponding Strong\nDisorder Renormalization procedure, that generalizes the RSRG-X procedure to\nconstruct the localized eigenstates of time-independent Hamiltonians.\n", "  3+1-dimensional Weyl fermions in interacting systems are described by\neffective quasi-relativistic Green's functions parametrized by a 16 element\nmatrix $e^\\mu_\\alpha$ in an expansion around the Weyl point. The matrix\n$e^{\\mu}_{\\alpha}$ can be naturally identified as an effective tetrad field for\nthe fermions. The correspondence between the tetrad field and an effective\nquasi-relativistic metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ governing the Weyl fermions allows for\nthe possibility to simulate different classes of metric fields emerging in\ngeneral relativity in interacting Weyl semimetals. According to this\ncorrespondence, there can be four types of Weyl fermions, depending on the\nsigns of the components $g^{00}$ and $g_{00}$ of the effective metric. In\naddition to the conventional type-I fermions with a tilted Weyl cone and\ntype-II fermions with an overtilted Weyl cone for $g^{00}>0$ and respectively\n$g_{00}>0$ or $g_{00}<0$, we find additional \"type-III\" and \"type-IV\" Weyl\nfermions with instabilities (complex frequencies) for $g^{00}<0$ and $g_{00}>0$\nor $g_{00}<0$, respectively. While the type-I and type-II Weyl points allow us\nto simulate the black hole event horizon at an interface where $g^{00}$ changes\nsign, the type-III Weyl point leads to effective spacetimes with closed\ntimelike curves.\n", "  Many complex systems share two characteristics: 1) they are stochastic in\nnature, and 2) they are characterized by a large number of factors. At the same\ntime, various natural complex systems appear to have two types of intertwined\nconstituents that exhibit counteracting effects on their equilibrium. In this\nstudy, we employ these few characteristics to lay the groundwork for analyzing\nsuch complex systems. The equilibrium point of these systems is generally\nstudied either through the kinetic notion of equilibrium or its energetic\nnotion, but not both. We postulate that these systems attempt to regulate the\nstate vector of their constituents such that both the kinetic and the energetic\nnotions of equilibrium are met. Based on this postulate, we prove: 1) the\nexistence of a point such that the kinetic notion of equilibrium is met for the\nless abundant constituents and, at the same time, the state vector of more\nabundant entities is regulated to minimize the energetic notion of equilibrium;\n2) the effect of unboundedly increasing less (more) abundant constituents\nstabilizes (destabilizes) the system; and 3) the (unrestricted) equilibrium of\nthe system is the point at which the number of stabilizing and destabilizing\nentities increase unboundedly with the same rate.\n", "  Electrostatic Deflector, one of the key components of SFC accelerator at IMP,\nis easily activated in the long-term running of HIRFL due to the bombardment\nwith losing ions. The level of residual radioactivity induced in main\ncomponents and dust contained in the electrostatic deflector enclosure have\nbeen investigated using gamma-ray spectrometry and Fluke 451p ionization\nchamber. The results indicate that the activated electrostatic deflector\nrepresent a significant radiological hazard for workers during maintenance\noperation, and the waste disposal difficulties should be encountered after\ndecommissioning.\n", "  A systematic first-principles study has been performed to understand the\nmagnetism of thin film SrRuO$_3$ which lots of research efforts have been\ndevoted to but no clear consensus has been reached about its ground state\nproperties. The relative t$_{2g}$ level difference, lattice distortion as well\nas the layer thickness play together in determining the spin order. In\nparticular, it is important to understand the difference between two standard\napproximations, namely LDA and GGA, in describing this metallic magnetism.\nLandau free energy analysis and the magnetization-energy-ratio plot clearly\nshow the different tendency of favoring the magnetic moment formation, and it\nis magnified when applied to the thin film limit where the experimental\ninformation is severely limited. As a result, LDA gives a qualitatively\ndifferent prediction from GGA in the experimentally relevant region of strain\nwhereas both approximations give reasonable results for the bulk phase. We\ndiscuss the origin of this difference and the applicability of standard methods\nto the correlated oxide and the metallic magnetic systems.\n", "  We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing\nthree major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic\nEvolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky\nWay stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in the\nnear-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)\nsurvey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby\ngalaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas\ndistributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using\nbaryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the\npower spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the\nSPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray\nAGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey\n(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meter\nSloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations there\nbegan in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared\nspectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,\nwith observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are\nscheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy,\nSDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data\nRelease 13, was made available in July 2016.\n", "  Newtonian N-body simulations have been employed successfully over the past\ndecades for the simulation of the cosmological large-scale structure. Such\nsimulations usually ignore radiation perturbations (photons and massless\nneutrinos) and the impact of general relativity (GR) beyond the background\nexpansion. This approximation can be relaxed and we discuss three different\napproaches that are accurate to leading order in GR. For simulations that start\nat redshift less than about 100 we find that the presence of early radiation\ntypically leads to percent-level effects on the numerical power spectra at\nlarge scales. Our numerical results agree across the three methods, and we\nconclude that all of the three methods are suitable for simulations in a\nstandard cosmology. Two of the methods modify the N-body evolution directly,\nwhile the third method can be applied as a post-processing prescription.\n", "  For the investigation of back-reactions of composite mesons in the NJL model,\na variational path-integral treatment is formulated which yields an effective\naction $\\mathscr{A}_{\\rm eff}[D_{\\sigma},D_{\\pi}; S]$, depending on the\npropagators $D_\\sigma$, $D_\\pi$ of $\\sigma-$ and $\\pi-$mesons and on the full\nquark propagator $S$. The stationarity conditions $\\delta \\mathscr{A}_{\\rm\neff}/ \\delta S = 0$, $\\delta \\mathscr{A}_{\\rm eff}/ \\delta D_\\sigma = 0$,\n$\\delta \\mathscr{A}_{\\rm eff}/ \\delta D_\\pi = 0$, then lead to coupled\nSchwinger-Dyson (SD) equations for the quark self-energy and the meson\npolarization functions. These results reproduce and extend results of the\nso-called \"$\\Phi-$derivable\" approach and provide a functional formulation for\ndiagrammatic resummations of $1/N_c-$corrections in the NJL model. Finally, we\nperform a low-momentum estimate of the quark and meson loop contributions to\nthe polarization function of the pion and on this basis discuss the Goldstone\ntheorem.\n", "  We revisit the problem of local moment formation in graphene due to\nchemisorption of individual atomic hydrogen or other analogous sp$^3$ covalent\nfunctionalizations. We describe graphene with the single orbital Hubbard model,\nso that the H chemisorption is equivalent to a vacancy in the honeycomb\nlattice. In order to circumvent artefacts related to periodic unit cells, we\nuse either huge simulation cells of up to $8\\times10^5$ sites, or an embedding\nscheme that allows the modelling of a single vacancy in an otherwise pristine\ninfinite honeycomb lattice. We find three results that stress the anomalous\nnature of the magnetic moment ($m$) in this system. First, in the\nnon-interacting ($U=0$), zero temperature ($T=0$) case, the $m(B)$ is a\ncontinuous smooth curve with divergent susceptibility, different from the\nstep-wise constant function found for a single unpaired spins in a gapped\nsystem. Second, for $U=0$ and $T>0$, the linear susceptibility follows a power\nlaw $\\propto{T}^{-\\alpha}$ with an exponent of $\\alpha=0.77$ different from\nconventional Curie's law. For $U>0$, in the mean field approximation, the\nintegrated moment is smaller than $m=1\\mu_B$, in contrast with results using\nperiodic unit cells. These three results highlight that the magnetic response\nof the local moment induced by sp$^3$ functionalizations in graphene is\ndifferent both from that of local moments in gaped systems, for which the\nmagnetic moment is quantized and follows a Curie law, and from Pauli\nparamagnetism in conductors, for which a linear susceptibility can be defined\nat $T=0$.\n", "  We introduce difference operators on the space of symmetric functions which\nare a natural generalization of the $(q,t)$-Macdonald operators. In the\n$t\\to\\infty$ limit, they satisfy the $A_{N-1}$ quantum $Q$-system. We identify\nthe elements in the spherical $A_{N-1}$ DAHA which are represented by these\noperators, as well as within the quantum toroidal algebra of $gl_1$ and the\nelliptic Hall algebra. We present a plethystic, or bosonic, formulation of the\ngenerating functions for the generalized Macdonald operators, which we relate\nto recent work of Bergeron et al. Finally we derive constant term identities\nfor the current that allow to interpret them in terms of shuffle products. In\nparticular we obtain in the $t\\to\\infty$ limit a shuffle presentation of the\nquantum $Q$-system relations.\n", "  We present an exhaustive numerical analysis of violations of local realism by\nfamilies of multipartite quantum states. As an indicator of nonclassicality we\nemploy the probability of violation for randomly sampled observables.\nSurprisingly, it rapidly increases with the number of parties or settings and\neven for relatively small values local realism is violated for almost all\nobservables. We have observed this effect to be typical in the sense that it\nemerged for all investigated states including some with randomly drawn\ncoefficients. We also present the probability of violation as a witness of\ngenuine multipartite entanglement.\n", "  Within the emergent eigenstate solution to quantum dynamics [Phys. Rev. X 7,\n021012 (2017)], one can construct a local operator (an emergent Hamiltonian) of\nwhich the time-evolving state is an eigenstate. Here we show that such a\nsolution exists for the expansion dynamics of Tonks-Girardeau gases in optical\nlattices after turning off power-law (e.g., harmonic or quartic) confining\npotentials, which are geometric quenches that do not involve the boost\noperator. For systems that are initially in the ground state and undergo\ndynamical fermionization during the expansion, we show that they remain in the\nground state of the emergent local Hamiltonian at all times. On the other hand,\nfor systems at nonzero initial temperatures, the expansion dynamics can be\ndescribed constructing a Gibbs ensemble for the emergent local Hamiltonian (an\nemergent Gibbs ensemble).\n", "  Following work by W\\\"unsch and collaborators, we investigate a\nself-enrichment scenario for second generation star formation in globular\nclusters wherein wind material from first generation massive stars rapidly\nradiatively cools. Radiative energy loss allows retention of fast winds within\nthe central regions of clusters, where it fuels star formation. Secondary star\nformation occurs in $\\sim3-5$ Myr, before supernovae, producing uniform iron\nabundances in both populations. We derive the critical criteria for radiative\ncooling of massive star winds and the second generation mass as a function of\ncluster mass, radius, and metallicity. We derive a critical condition on $M/R$,\nabove which second generation star formation can occur. We speculate that above\nthis threshold the strong decrease in the cluster wind energy and momentum\nallows ambient gas to remain from the cluster formation process. We reproduce\nlarge observed second generation fractions of $\\sim30-80\\%$ if wind material\nmixes with ambient gas. Importantly, the mass of ambient gas required is only\nof order the first generation's stellar mass. Second generation helium\nenrichment $\\Delta Y$ is inversely proportional to mass fraction in the second\ngeneration; a large second generation can form with $\\Delta Y\\sim0.001-0.02$,\nwhile a small second generation can reach $\\Delta Y\\sim0.16$. Like other\nself-enrichment models for the second generation, we are not able to\nsimultaneously account for both the full range of the Na-O anticorrelation and\nthe second generation fraction.\n", "  We present Rotation Measures (RM) of the diffuse Galactic synchrotron\nemission from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) and compare them to RMs\nof extragalactic sources in order to study the large-scale reversal in the\nGalactic magnetic field (GMF). Using Stokes Q, U and I measurements of the\nGalactic disk collected with the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio\nAstrophysical Observatory, we calculate RMs over an extended region of the sky,\nfocusing on the low longitude range of the CGPS (l=52deg to l=72deg). We note\nthe similarity in the structures traced by the compact sources and the extended\nemission and highlight the presence of a gradient in the RM map across an\napproximately diagonal line, which we identify with the well-known field\nreversal of the Sagittarius-Carina arm. We suggest that the orientation of this\nreversal is a geometric effect resulting from our location within a GMF\nstructure arising from current sheets that are not perpendicular to the\nGalactic plane, as is required for a strictly radial field reversal, but that\nhave at least some component parallel to the disk. Examples of models that fit\nthis description are the three-dimensional dynamo-based model of Gressel et al.\n(2013) and a Galactic scale Parker spiral (Akasofu & Hakamada 1982), although\nthe latter may be problematic in terms of Galactic dynamics. We emphasize the\nimportance of constructing three-dimensional models of the GMF to account for\nstructures like the diagonal RM gradient observed in this dataset.\n", "  We recently introduced a class of ${\\mathbb{Z}}_N$ graded discrete Lax pairs\nand studied the associated discrete integrable systems (lattice equations). In\nparticular, we introduced a subclass, which we called \"self-dual\". In this\npaper we discuss the continuous symmetries of these systems, their reductions\nand the relation of the latter to the Bogoyavlensky equation.\n", "  A quantum critical point (QCP) is currently being conjectured for the\nBaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ system at the critical value $x_{\\rm c} \\approx$\n0.3. In the proximity of a QCP, all thermodynamic and transport properties are\nexpected to scale with a single characteristic energy, given by the quantum\nfluctuations. Such an universal behavior has not, however, been found in the\nsuperconducting upper critical field $H_{\\rm c2}$. Here we report $H_{\\rm\nc2}$-data for epitaxial thin films extracted from the electrical resistance\nmeasured in very high magnetic fields up to 67 Tesla. Using a multi-band\nanalysis we find that $H_{\\rm c2}$ is sensitive to the QCP, implying a\nsignificant charge carrier effective mass enhancement at the doping-induced QCP\nthat is essentially band-dependent. Our results point to two qualitatively\ndifferent groups of electrons in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. The first one\n(possibly associated to hot spots or whole Fermi sheets) has a strong mass\nenhancement at the QCP, and the second one is insensitive to the QCP. The\nobserved duality could also be present in many other quantum critical systems.\n", "  Performing qubit gate operations as quickly as possible can be important to\nminimize the effects of decoherence. For resonant gates, this requires applying\na strong ac drive. However, strong driving can present control challenges by\ncausing leakage to levels that lie outside the qubit subspace. Strong driving\ncan also present theoretical challenges because preferred tools such as the\nrotating wave approximation can break down, resulting in complex dynamics that\nare difficult to control. Here we analyze resonant $X$ rotations of a silicon\nquantum double dot hybrid qubit within a dressed-state formalism, obtaining\nresults beyond the rotating wave approximation. We obtain analytic formulas for\nthe optimum driving frequency and the Rabi frequency, which both are affected\nby strong driving. While the qubit states exhibit fast oscillations due to\ncounter-rotating terms and leakage, we show that they can be suppressed to the\npoint that gate fidelities above $99.99\\%$ are possible, in the absence of\ndecoherence. Hence decoherence mechanisms, rather than strong-driving effects,\nshould represent the limiting factor for resonant-gate fidelities in quantum\ndot hybrid qubits.\n", "  We consider the problem of constructing cosmological solutions of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations that contain multiple charged black holes. By\nconsidering the field equations as a set of constraint and evolution equations,\nwe construct exact initial data for N charged black holes on a hypersphere.\nThis corresponds to the maximum of expansion of a cosmological solution, and\nprovides sufficient information for a unique evolution. We then consider the\nspecific example of a universe that contains eight charged black holes, and\nshow that the existence of non-zero electric charge reduces the scale of the\ncosmological region of the space. These solutions generalize the\nMajumdar-Papapetrou solutions away from the extremal limit of charged black\nholes, and provide what we believe to be some of the first relativistic\ncalculations of the effects of electric charge on cosmological backreaction.\n", "  The radiative heat transfer between two dielectrics can be strongly enhanced\nin the near field in the presence of surface phonon-polariton resonances.\nNevertheless, the spectral mismatch between the surface modes supported by two\ndissimilar materials is responsible for a dramatic reduction of the radiative\nheat flux they exchange. In the present paper we study how the presence of a\ngraphene sheet, deposited on the material supporting the surface wave of lowest\nfrequency, allows to widely tune the radiative heat transfer, producing an\namplification factor going up to one order of magnitude. By analyzing the\nLandauer energy transmission coefficients we demonstrate that this\namplification results from the interplay between the delocalized plasmon\nsupported by graphene and the surface polaritons of the two dielectrics. We\nfinally show that the effect we highlight is robust with respect to the\nfrequency mismatch, paving the way to an active tuning and amplification of\nnear-field radiative heat transfer in different configurations.\n", "  We have used soft x-ray photoemission electron microscopy to image the\nmagnetization of single domain La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ nano-islands\narranged in geometrically frustrated configurations such as square ice and\nkagome ice geometries. Upon thermal randomization, ensembles of nano-islands\nwith strong inter-island magnetic coupling relax towards low-energy\nconfigurations. Statistical analysis shows that the likelihood of ensembles\nfalling into low-energy configurations depends strongly on the annealing\ntemperature. Annealing to just below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic\nfilm (T$_{C}$ = 338 K) allows for a much greater probability of achieving low\nenergy configurations as compared to annealing above the Curie temperature. At\nthis thermally active temperature of 325 K, the ensemble of ferromagnetic\nnano-islands explore their energy landscape over time and eventually transition\nto lower energy states as compared to the frozen-in configurations obtained\nupon cooling from above the Curie temperature. Thus, this materials system\nallows for a facile method to systematically study thermal evolution of\nartificial spin ice arrays of nano-islands at temperatures modestly above room\ntemperature.\n", "  We analyse numerically the linear stability of the fully developed liquid\nmetal flow in a square duct with insulating side walls and thin electrically\nconducting horizontal walls with the wall conductance ratio $c=0.01\\cdots 1$\nsubject to a vertical magnetic field with the Hartmann numbers up to\n$Ha=10^{4}.$ In a sufficiently strong magnetic field, the flow consists of two\njets at the side walls walls and a near-stagnant core with the relative\nvelocity $\\sim(cHa)^{-1}.$ We find that for $Ha\\gtrsim300,$ the effect of wall\nconductivity on the stability of the flow is mainly determined by the effective\nHartmann wall conductance ratio $cHa.$ For $c\\ll 1,$ the increase of the\nmagnetic field or that of the wall conductivity has a destabilizing effect on\nthe flow. Maximal destabilization of the flow occurs at $Ha\\approx30/c.$ In a\nstronger magnetic field with $cHa\\gtrsim 30,$ the destabilizing effect vanishes\nand the asymptotic results of Priede et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 649, 115, 2010] for\nthe ideal Hunt's flow with perfectly conducting Hartmann walls are recovered.\n", "  Anticipating forthcoming publication by the TOTEM collaboration of low-t\nelastic scattering data at \\sqrt{s}=13 and 2.76 TeV, hereby we emphasize the\ncorrelation between two prominent structures seen upon the otherwise\nexponential diffraction cone, namely a \"break\" staying fixed around t=-0.1\nGeV^2 and a dip moving with energy logarithmically inwards; while at the ISR\nthe two structures are separated by a distance of about 1~GeV^2, at the LHC the\ndip comes close to the periphery of the \"break\", thus affecting its\nparametrization. An unbiased disentangling and identification of the break at\nthe LHC should account for this correlation.\n", "  Modified gravity is one of the potential candidates to explain the\naccelerated expansion of the universe. Current study highlights the\nmaterialization of anisotropic compact stars in the context of $f(R,G)$ theory\nof gravity. In particular, to gain insight in the physical behavior of three\nstars namely, Her $X1$, SAX J $1808$-$3658$ and 4U $1820$-$30$, energy density,\nand radial and tangential pressures are calculated. The $f(R,G)$ gravity model\nis split into a Starobinsky like $f(R)$ model and a power law $f(G)$ model. The\nmain feature of the work is a $3$-dimensional graphical analysis in which,\nanisotropic measurements, energy conditions and stability attributes of these\nstars are discussed. It is shown that all three stars behave as usual for\npositive values of $f(G)$ model parameter $n$.\n", "  We investigate key electrostatic features of charged dendrimers at hand of\nthe biomedically important dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) macromolecule\nusing multi-scale computer simulations and Zetasizer experiments. In our\nsimulation study, we first develop an effective mesoscale Hamiltonian specific\nto dPGS based on input from all-atom, explicit-water simulations of dPGS of low\ngeneration. Employing this in coarse-grained, implicit-solvent/explicit-salt\nLangevin dynamics simulations, we then study dPGS structural and electrostatic\nproperties up to the sixth generation. By systematically mapping then the\ncalculated electrostatic potential onto the Debye-H\\\"uckel form -- that serves\nas a basic defining equation for the effective charge -- we determine\nwell-defined effective net charges and corresponding radii, surface charge\ndensities, and surface potentials of dPGS. The latter are found to be up to one\norder of magnitude smaller than the bare values and consistent with previously\nderived theories on charge renormalization and weak saturation for high\ndendrimer generations (charges). Finally, we find that the surface potential of\nthe dendrimers estimated from the simulations compare very well with our new\nelectrophoretic experiments.\n", "  CMB-S4 is a proposed experiment to map the polarization of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) to nearly the cosmic variance limit for angular\nscales that are accessible from the ground. The science goals and capabilities\nof CMB-S4 in illuminating cosmic inflation, measuring the sum of neutrino\nmasses, searching for relativistic relics in the early universe, characterizing\ndark energy and dark matter, and mapping the matter distribution in the\nuniverse have been described in the CMB-S4 Science Book. This Technology Book\nis a companion volume to the Science Book. The ambitious science goals of\nCMB-S4, a \"Stage-4\" experiment, require a step forward in experimental\ncapability from the current Stage=II experiments. To guide this process, we\nsummarize the current state of CMB instrumentation technology, and identify R&D\nefforts necessary to advance it for use in CMB-S4. The book focuses on\ntechnical challenges in four broad areas: Telescope Design; Receiver Optics;\nFocal-Plane Optical Coupling; and Focal-Plane Sensor and Readout.\n", "  \"F-free\" CeOBiS$_2$ single crystals have successfully grown, thoroughly\neliminating a concern about F-contamination by using a high-purity CsCl flux.\nThe obtained crystals have a plate-like shape with a size of 1.0-3.0 mm in the\nwell-developed plane. Single crystal X-ray structural analysis clearly revealed\nthat the CeOBiS$_2$ crystallizes with a space group $P4/nmm$ (with lattice\nparameters of $a$ = 4.0189(6) {\\AA}, $c$ = 13.573(2) {\\AA}). The bond valence\nsum estimation and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the\nchemical state of Ce was in the mixed valence of Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$. The\nsingle crystals show superconductivity with zero resistivity at $\\sim$1.3 K.\nThis is the first conclusive evidence of superconductivity driven by Ce valence\nfluctuation in surely non-doped CeOBiS$_2$. The superconducting transition\ntemperature was enhanced up to $\\sim$3.8 K by applying hydrostatic pressure.\n", "  We report measurements of the London penetration depth [$\\Delta\\lambda(T)$]\nof the recently discovered iron-based superconductor (Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)OHFeSe,\nin order to characterize the nature of the superconducting gap structure. At\nlow temperatures, $\\Delta\\lambda(T)$ displays nearly temperature independent\nbehavior, indicating a fully open superconducting gap. We also analyze the\nsuperfluid density $\\rho_s(T)$ which cannot be well accounted for by a\nsingle-gap isotropic $s$-wave model but are consistent with either two-gaps, a\nmodel for the orbital selective $s\\times\\tau_3$ state or anisotropic $s$-wave\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We study the thermal phase transitions of the four-fold degenerate phases\n(the plaquette and single stripe states) in two-dimensional frustrated Ising\nmodel on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. The\ncritical Ashkin-Teller-like behavior is identified both in the parameter\nregions with the plaquette and single stripe phases, respectively. The\nfour-state Potts-critical end points differentiating the continuous transitions\nfrom the first-order ones are estimated based on finite-size scaling analyses.\nFurthermore, similar behavior of the transition to the four-fold single stripe\nphase is also observed in the anisotropic triangular Ising model. Thus, this\nwork clearly demonstrates that the transitions to the four-fold degenerate\nstates of two-dimensional Ising antiferromagnets exhibit similar transition\nbehavior.\n", "  In this work, we consider solutions of the Maxwell equations on the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter family of black hole spacetimes. We prove that, in the\nstatic region bounded by black hole and cosmological horizons, solutions of the\nMaxwell equations decay to stationary Coulomb solutions at a super-polynomial\nrate, with decay measured according to ingoing and outgoing null coordinates.\nOur method employs a differential transformation of Maxwell tensor components\nto obtain higher-order quantities satisfying a Fackerell-Ipser equation, in the\nstyle of Chandrasekhar and the more recent work of Pasqualotto. The analysis of\nthe Fackerell-Ipser equation is accomplished by means of the vector field\nmethod, with decay estimates for the higher-order quantities leading to decay\nestimates for components of the Maxwell tensor.\n", "  There exist non-trivial stationary points of the Euclidean action for an\naxion particle minimally coupled to Einstein gravity, dubbed wormholes. They\nexplicitly break the continuos global shift symmetry of the axion in a\nnon-perturbative way, and generate an effective potential that may compete with\nQCD depending on the value of the axion decay constant. In this paper, we\nexplore both theoretical and phenomenological aspects of this issue. On the\ntheory side, we address the problem of stability of the wormhole solutions, and\nwe show that the spectrum of the quadratic action features only positive\neigenvalues. On the phenomenological side, we discuss, beside the obvious\napplication to the QCD axion, relevant consequences for models with ultralight\ndark matter, black hole superradiance, and the relaxation of the electroweak\nscale. We conclude discussing wormhole solutions for a generic coset and the\npotential they generate.\n", "  Simulation of atomic resolution image formation in scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy can require significant computation times using traditional\nmethods. A recently developed method, termed plane-wave reciprocal-space\ninterpolated scattering matrix (PRISM), demonstrates potential for significant\nacceleration of such simulations with negligible loss of accuracy. Here we\npresent a software package called Prismatic for parallelized simulation of\nimage formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) using both\nthe PRISM and multislice methods. By distributing the workload between multiple\nCUDA-enabled GPUs and multicore processors, accelerations as high as 1000x for\nPRISM and 30x for multislice are achieved relative to traditional multislice\nimplementations using a single 4-GPU machine. We demonstrate a potentially\nimportant application of Prismatic, using it to compute images for atomic\nelectron tomography at sufficient speeds to include in the reconstruction\npipeline. Prismatic is freely available both as an open-source CUDA/C++ package\nwith a graphical user interface and as a Python package, PyPrismatic.\n", "  We introduce a four-dimensional quantum model for describing the torsional\ncontrol of $\\rm G_{16}$-type molecules in the electronic ground state, based on\nthe symmetry-adapted variational method. We define conditions for which\nlower-dimensional models, commonly used to simulate the strong-field control of\nmolecular torsions, are reliable approximations to a four-dimensional\ntreatment. In particular, we study the role of different types of\nrotational-torsional couplings---the field-free coupling and the field-induced\ncoupling---and show that the conclusions recently drawn on the role of\nrotational-torsional couplings in the process of torsional alignment are not\ncorrect. Furthermore, we demonstrate how important an adequate description of\nthe molecular polarizability is for reliably predicting the torsional\nalignment.\n", "  The introduction of a fractional differential operator defined in terms of\nthe Riemann-Liouville derivative makes it possible to generalize the kinetic\nequations used to model relaxation in dielectrics. In this context such\nfractional equations are called fractional kinetic relaxation equations and\ntheir solutions, called fractional kinetic relaxation functions, are given in\nterms of Mittag-Leffler functions. These fractional kinetic relaxation\nfunctions generalize the kinetic relaxation functions associated with the\nDebye, Cole-Cole, Cole-Davidson and Havriliak-Negami models, as the latter\nfunctions become particular cases of the fractional solutions, obtained for\nspecific values of the parameter specifying the order of the derivative. The\naim of this work is to analyse the behavior of these fractional functions in\nthe time variable. As theoretical tools we use the theorem by Bernstein on the\ncomplete monotonicity of functions together with Titchmarsh's inversion\nformula. The last part of the paper contains the graphics of some of those\nfunctions, obtained by varying the value of the parameter in the fractional\ndifferential operator and in the corresponding Mittag-Leffler functions. The\ngraphics were made with Mathematica 10.4.\n", "  These letters, written in 1998-2000, contain various basic results about\nCourant algebroids (CAs), such as classification of exact and transitive CAs,\nreduction of CAs, description in terms of symplectic dg manifolds, a canonical\ngenerating Dirac operator, and a relation with Poisson-Lie T-duality.\n", "  We present a highly sensitive hydrogen fluoride detector based on simple\ncantilever-enhanced photo-acoustic spectroscopy. A noise equivalent\nconcentration of 5 parts-per-trillion was achieved in 1 s and 650\nparts-per-quadrillion in 32 min. The limits were reached with an average\noptical power of 950 mW using a new continuous-wave optical parametric\noscillator at 2.476 \\mu m. The achieved normalized noise equivalent absorption\ncoefficient was 2.7$\\times$10$^{-10}$ Wcm$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$.\n", "  The ability to design and fabricate materials with tailored mechanical\nproperties, combined with immunity to damage, is a frontier of materials\nengineering. For example, materials which are characterized by elastic\nproperties that depend on the position inside a medium are required in\napplications where structural stability has to be combined with a soft and\ncompliant surface, like in impact protection and cushioning. A gradient in the\nelastic properties can be built from a single material, varying gradually the\nbulk porosity of the material or its geometrical structure. However, if such a\ngradient is built into the material at production, damage or wearing over time\nmight expose unwanted elastic properties. Here, we implement a design principle\nfor a spatially inhomogeneous material based on topological band-theory for\nmechanical systems. The resulting inhomogeneity is stable against wearing and\neven cutting the material in half. We show how, by creating a periodic elastic\nmaterial with topological properties, one can create an intrinsically polar\nbehavior, where a face with a given surface normal is stiff while its opposing\nface is soft.\n", "  Negative refractive index (NRI) of the quantized lossless mesoscopic\nleft-handed transmission line (LHTL) is deduced numerically in thermal Fock\nstate. Some specific quantum features of NRI dependent the temperature,\nfrequency of the electromagnetic wave and photon numbers, and quantum\nfluctuations are shown in the lossless LHTL. The results are significant for\nthe miniaturizing applications of LHTL and quantum circuits.\n", "  A nonlinear model of the scalar field with a coupling between the field and\nits gradient is developed. It is shown, that such model is suitable for the\ndescription of phase transition accompanied by formation of spatial\ninhomogeneous distribution of the order parameter. The proposed model is\nanalogous the mechanical nonlinear oscillator with the coordinate-dependent\nmass or velocity-dependent elastic module. Besides, for some value of energy\nthe model under consideration possesses exact analytical solution. We assume\nthat this model can related to the spinodal decomposition, quark confinement,\nor cosmological scenario. All predictions can be verified experimentally.\n", "  We present preliminary results for fits of parton distribution functions\n(PDFs) which include the resummation of small-$x$ logarithms at NLLx accuracy,\nperformed in the NNPDF framework. We observe an improvement in the description\nof DIS data at small values of Bjorken $x$ when resummation effects are\nincluded. The improvement is more marked when comparing NNLO+NLLx fits to NNLO\nones, and is particularly noticeable for small-$x$ and small-$Q^2$ HERA\ninclusive structure functions. The main effect of the resummation is an\nenhancement of the gluon and singlet PDFs at small-$x$, which persists at high\nscales.\n", "  Virtual reality (VR) has long promised to revolutionize education, but with\nlittle follow-through. Part of the reason for this is the prohibitive cost of\nimmersive VR headsets or caves. This has changed with the advent of\nsmartphone-based VR (along the lines of Google cardboard) which allows students\nto use smartphones and inexpensive plastic or cardboard viewers to enjoy\nstereoscopic VR simulations. We have completed the largest-ever such study on\n627 students enrolled in calculus-based freshman physics at The Ohio State\nUniversity. This initial study focused on student understanding of electric\nfields. Students were split into three treatments groups: VR, video, and static\n2D images. Students were asked questions before, during, and after treatment.\nHere we present a preliminary analysis including overall post-pre improvement\namong the treatment groups, dependence of improvement on gender, and previous\nvideo game experience. Results on select questions are discussed. Several\nelectric field visualizations similar to those used in this study are freely\navailable on Google Play http://go.osu.edu/BuckeyeVR\n", "  Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) doped with magnetic impurities have been a\nfocus of continuous research for a couple of decades. A significant effort has\nbeen devoted to studies of magnetic polarons (MP) in these nanostructures.\nThese collective states arise through exchange interaction between a carrier\nconfined in a QD and localized spins of the magnetic impurities (typically:\nMn). We discuss our theoretical description of various MP properties in\nself-assembled QDs. We present a self-consistent, temperature-dependent\napproach to MPs formed by a valence band hole. We use the Luttinger-Kohn k.p\nHamiltonian to account for the important effects of spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  Polarisation analysis of synchrotron THz radiation was carried out with a\nstandard stretched polyethylene polariser and revealed that the linearly\npolarised (horizontal) component contributes up to 22 +/- 5% to the circular\npolarised synchrotron emission extracted by a gold-coated mirror with a\nhorizontal slit inserted near a bending magnet edge. Comparison with\ntheoretical predictions shows a qualitative match with dominance of the edge\nradiation. Grid polarisers 3D-printed out of commercial acrilic resin were\ntested for the polariser function and showed spectral regions where the\ndichroic ratio DR > 1 and < 1 implying importance of molecular and/or stress\ninduced anisotropy. Metal-coated 3D-printed THz optical elements can find a\nrange of applications in intensity and polarisation control of THz beams.\n", "  Magnetic droplets are non-topological dynamical solitons that can be\nnucleated and sustained in nano-contact based spin torque nano-oscillators\n(NC-STNOs) with perpendicular anisotropy free layers. While originally\npredicted in all-perpendicular NC-STNOs, all experimental demonstrations have\nso far relied on orthogonal devices with an in-plane polarizing layer that\nrequires a strong magnetic field for droplet nucleation. Here, we instead show\nthe nucleation and sustained operation of magnetic droplets in\nall-perpendicular NC-STNOs in modest perpendicular fields and over a wide range\nof nano-contact size. The droplet is observed electrically as an intermediate\nresistance state accompanied by broadband low-frequency microwave noise. Using\ncanted fields, which introduce a non-zero relative angle between the free and\nfixed layer, the actual droplet precession frequency can also be determined.\nFinally, the droplet size, its perimeter width, and its fully reversed core are\ndirectly observed underneath a 80 nm diameter nano-contact using scanning\ntransmission x-ray microscopy on both the Ni and Co edges. The droplet diameter\nis 150 nm, i.e. almost twice the nominal size of the nano-contact, and the\ndroplet has a perimeter width of about 70 nm.\n", "  PICsar2D is a 2.5D relativistic, electromagnetic, particle in cell code\ndesigned for studying the pulsar magnetosphere. The source code and a suite of\nPython analysis routines can be downloaded from\n\"https://github.com/astromb/PICsar2D.git\". Additionally, the repository\nincludes a step-by-step tutorial for compiling the code, running it, and\nanalyzing the output. This article is devoted to several new algorithmic\nadvances and numerical experiments. These include a new pair injection\nprescription at the pulsar surface, a comparison of different pair injection\ntechniques, a discussion of particle trajectories near the pulsar Y-line, and\nperformance optimization of the code.\n", "  We performed a theoretical investigation on the ground state properties of a\ntwo dimensional ultra-cold Fermi superfluid with an anisotropic spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC). In the absence of Zeeman field, the system evolves from weak\ncoupling BCS regime to strongly interacting BEC regime (BCS-BEC crossover) with\nincreasing either the two-particle interaction strength or SOC parameters. We\nfocused on the behaviors of pairing parameter and density of states (DOS) when\nincreasing the anisotropic parameter of the SOC. Surprisingly, we discovered\nthat the gap parameter decreases with increasing the anisotropic parameters,\nbut the DOS at the Fermi surface shows non-monotonic behavior as a function of\nthe anisotropic parameter. In the presence of the Zeeman field, we discussed a\nparticular type of topological phase transition by obtaining the analytical\nresult of the topological invariant and directly related this quantum phase\ntransition with a sudden change of the ground state wave-function. Effects of\nhigher partial wave pairing terms on this topological phase transition were\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  Spin waves (SW) can induce rich domain wall (DW) motion in a\nperpendicular-magnetic anisotropy nanostrip. In-plane magnetization tilt angle\nresulting from the fluctuation of the effective field of the magnetization\nresponse in the DW region plays an essential role in the dynamics of SW\ninteracting with a DW. We performed simulation and found that the transmission\nratio of the propagating SW across the DW depends strongly on the tilt angle in\nthe low-frequency regime. The material parameters and the geometrical\nconfiguration can be fine-tuned for practical devices.\n", "  We present a theory of weak gravity parameterized by a fundamental frequency\n$\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{1-q}H$ of the cosmoloogical horizon, where $H$ and $q$ denote\nthe Hubble and, respectively, deceleration parameter. It predicts (i) a $C^0$\nonset to weak gravity across accelerations $\\alpha = a_{dS}$ in galaxy rotation\ncurves, where $a_{dS}=cH$ denotes the de Sitter acceleration with velocity of\nlight $c$, and (ii) fast evolution $Q(z)=dq(z)/dz$ of the deceleration\nparameter by $\\Lambda=\\omega_0^2$ satisfying $Q_0>2.5$, $Q_0=Q(0)$, distinct\nfrom $Q_0\\lesssim1$ in $\\Lambda$CDM. The first is identified in high resolution\ndata of Lellie et al.(2017), the second in heterogeneous data on $H(z)$ over\n$0<z<2$. A model-independent cubic fit in the second rules out $\\Lambda$CDM by\n$4.35\\sigma$ and obtains $H_0=74.0\\pm 2.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ consistent\nwith Riess et al. (2016). Comments on possible experimental tests by the LISA\nPathfinder are included.\n", "  The case of the classical Hill problem is numerically investigated by\nperforming a thorough and systematic classification of the initial conditions\nof the orbits. More precisely, the initial conditions of the orbits are\nclassified into four categories: (i) non-escaping regular orbits; (ii) trapped\nchaotic orbits; (iii) escaping orbits; and (iv) collision orbits. In order to\nobtain a more general and complete view of the orbital structure of the\ndynamical system our exploration takes place in both planar (2D) and the\nspatial (3D) version of the Hill problem. For the 2D system we numerically\nintegrate large sets of initial conditions in several types of planes, while\nfor the system with three degrees of freedom, three-dimensional distributions\nof initial conditions of orbits are examined. For distinguishing between\nordered and chaotic bounded motion the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) method is\nused. We managed to locate the several bounded basins, as well as the basins of\nescape and collision and also to relate them with the corresponding escape and\ncollision time of the orbits. Our numerical calculations indicate that the\noverall orbital dynamics of the Hamiltonian system is a complicated but highly\ninterested problem. We hope our contribution to be useful for a further\nunderstanding of the orbital properties of the classical Hill problem.\n", "  Prompt fission $\\gamma$-rays are responsible for approximately 5\\% of the\ntotal energy released in fission, and therefore important to understand when\nmodelling nuclear reactors. In this work we present prompt $\\gamma$-ray\nemission characteristics in fission, for the first time as a function of the\nnuclear excitation energy of the fissioning system. Emitted $\\gamma$-ray\nspectra were measured, and $\\gamma$-ray multiplicities and average and total\n$\\gamma$ energies per fission were determined for the $^{233}$U(d,pf) reaction\nfor excitation energies between 4.8 and 10 MeV, and for the $^{239}$Pu(d,pf)\nreaction between 4.5 and 9 MeV. The spectral characteristics show no\nsignificant change as a function of excitation energy above the fission\nbarrier, despite the fact that an extra $\\sim$5 MeV of energy is potentially\navailable in the excited fragments for $\\gamma$-decay. The measured results are\ncompared to model calculations made for prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission with the\nfission model code GEF. Further comparison with previously obtained results\nfrom thermal neutron induced fission is made to characterize possible\ndifferences arising from using the surrogate (d,p) reaction.\n", "  We produce a catalogue of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3 $\\mu$m,\nBr$\\alpha$ and infrared luminosity ($L$(IR)) of 412 local galaxies, and\ninvestigate a relation between these physical parameters. We measure the PAH\n3.3 $\\mu$m and Br$\\alpha$ flux using AKARI 2-5 $\\mu$m spectra and the $L$(IR)\nusing the AKARI-all-sky-survey data. The $L$(IR) and redshift ranges of our\nsample are $L$(IR)=$10^{9.7-12.8}$L$_\\odot$ and $z_{\\rm spec}=0.002-0.3$,\nrespectively. We found that the ratio of $L$(PAH 3.3 $\\mu$m) to $L$(IR) is\nconstant at $L$(IR) $<$ $10^{11} \\rm L_\\odot$ whereas it decreases with the\n$L$(IR) at higher $L$(IR). Also, the ratio of $L$(Br$\\alpha$) to $L$(IR)\ndecreases with the $L$(IR). The both $L$(PAH)/$L$(IR) and\n$L$(Br$\\alpha$)/$L$(IR) ratios are not strongly dependent on galaxy type and\ndust temperature. The relative weakness of the two ratios could be attributed\nto destruction of PAH, a lack of UV photons exciting PAH molecules or ionising\nhydrogen gas, extremely high dust attenuation, or active galactic nucleus\ncontribution to the $L$(IR). Although we cannot determine the cause of the\ndecreases of the luminosity ratios, a clear correlation between them implies\nthat they are related with each other. The catalogue presented in our work will\nbe available at the AKARI archive web page.\n", "  We present an efficient approach and principle experiment for compressive\nsensing (CS) fluorescence spectral imaging. According to the dimension-reduced\neffect of CS, the spectral and spatial information was simultaneously obtained\nby using a fiber spectrometer without mechanical scanning. As a method\nverification, we demonstrated spectral imaging under only two typical\nwavelengths, but the spectral resolution is up to 1.4nm depended on the fiber\nspectrometer. The method could obtain 50% light energy from the object, much\nlarger compared with mechanical scanning which detects light of only one point\nper measurement. The relationship between sampling rate and image quality is\nalso discussed in this study.\n", "  We used new HARPS-N spectra to revisitate the projection factor of Delta Cep\nand to directly measure the specific contribution of the velocity gradient\nwithin the atmosphere. By introducing an hydrodynamical model we could also\ndetermine the semi-theoretical values of the correction factor between the gas\nmovement and the optical continuum by assuming radiative transfer in\nplane-parallel or sherically symmetric geometries, respectively.\n", "  We study the local antisymmetric spin-orbit (ASO) coupling effect on spin,\norbital, and charge degrees of freedom for the Kondo effect in a triangular\ntriple quantum dot (TTQD). Here, one of the three QDs is coupled to a metallic\nlead through electron tunneling, and a local electric polarization is induced\nby the Kondo effect. The ASO interaction is introduced in the other two coupled\nQDs on the opposite side of the lead. Generally, the ASO coupling effect is\nvery weak and not easily detectable, but it essentially causes spin and charge\nreconfigurations in the TTQD through the Kondo effect. Using an extended\nAnderson model for the TTQD Kondo system, we elucidate that the ASO coupling\ngives rise to a considerable reduction of the emergent electric polarization,\nas a consequence of the parity mixing of molecular orbitals in the triangular\nloop as well as the spin-up and spin-down coupling of local electrons. The\nlatter leads to a local diamagnetic susceptibility owing to the ASO coupled\nspins. We also show that the Kondo-induced electric polarization can be\ncontrolled by the ASO coupling as well as by the magnetic flux penetrating\nthrough the TTQD.\n", "  We report a $^{23}$Na spin-lattice relaxation rate, $T_1^{-1}$, in low-silica\nX zeolite. $T_1^{-1}$ follows multiple BPP-type behavior as a result of thermal\nmotion of sodium cations in insulating material. The estimated lowest\nactivation energy of 15~meV is much lower than 100~meV observed previously for\nsodium motion in heavily Na-loaded samples and is most likely attributed to\nshort-distance jumps of sodium cations between sites within the same supercage.\n", "  In this report, we investigate the stabilization of saddle fixed points in\ncoupled oscillators where individual oscillators exhibit the saddle fixed\npoints. The coupled oscillators may have two structurally different types of\nsuppressed states, namely amplitude death and oscillation death. The\nstabilization of saddle equilibrium point refers to the amplitude death state\nwhere oscillations are ceased and all the oscillators converge to the single\nstable steady state via inverse pitchfork bifurcation. Due to multistability\nfeatures of oscillation death states, linear stability theory fails to analyze\nthe stability of such states analytically, so we quantify all the states by\nbasin stability measurement which is an universal nonlocal nonlinear concept\nand it interplays with the volume of basins of attractions. We also observe\nmulti-clustered oscillation death states in a random network and measure them\nusing basin stability framework. To explore such phenomena we choose a network\nof coupled Duffing-Holmes and Lorenz oscillators which are interacting through\nmean-field coupling. We investigate how basin stability for different steady\nstates depends on mean-field density and coupling strength. We also\nanalytically derive stability conditions for different steady states and\nconfirm by rigorous bifurcation analysis.\n", "  A new electron beam-optical procedure is proposed for quasi-cw pumping of\nhigh-pressure large-volume He-Ar laser on 4p[1/2]1 - 4s[3/2]2 argon atom\ntransition at the wavelength of 912.5 nm. It consists of creation and\nmaintenance of a necessary density of 4s[3/2]2 metastable state in the gain\nmedium by a fast electron beam and subsequent optically pumping of the upper\nlaser level via the classical three-level scheme using a laser diode.\nAbsorption probing is used to study collisional quenching of Ar* metastable in\nelectron-beam-excited high-pressure He-Ar mixtures with a low content of argon.\nThe rate constants for plasma-chemical reactions Ar*+He+Ar-Ar2*+He (3.6 +-\n0.4)x10-33 cm6/s, Ar+2He-HeAr*+He (4.4 +- 0.9)x10-36 cm6/s and\nAr*+He-Products+He (2.4 +- 0.3)x10-15 cm3/s are for the first time measured.\n", "  We address the atomistic nature of the longitudinal static friction against\nsliding of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) deposited on gold, a system whose\nstructural and mechanical properties have been recently the subject of intense\nexperimental investigation. By means of numerical simulations and modeling we\nshow that the GNR interior is structurally lubric (\"superlubric\") so that the\nstatic friction is dominated by the front/tail regions of the GNR, where the\nresidual uncompensated lateral forces arising from the interaction with the\nunderneath gold surface opposes the free sliding. As a result of this edge\npinning the static friction does not grow with the GNR length, but oscillates\naround a fairly constant mean value. These friction oscillations are explained\nin terms of the GNR-Au(111) lattice mismatch: at certain GNR lengths close to\nan integer number of the beat (or moire') length there is good force\ncompensation and superlubric sliding; whereas close to half odd-integer periods\nthere is significant pinning of the edge with larger friction. These results\nmake qualitative contact with recent state-of-the-art atomic force microscopy\nexperiment, as well as with the sliding of other different incommensurate\nsystems.\n", "  We present here a study of the impact of a heavy neutrino (or heavy neutral\nlepton) on leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays. We used a simplified model\nconsisting of 3 light neutrinos responsible for neutrino oscillations and a\nheavy sterile neutrino. We found that it can lead to large deviations from the\nStandard Model predictions for leptonic decays, in conflict with experimental\nmeasurements of $K_{e2}$ and the lepton universality test $R_K$. This allows to\nderive new constraints on the leptonic mixing for heavy sterile neutrinos. No\ntension was found when considering the semileptonic decays. Finally, we point\nout the potential of the decay $K_L \\rightarrow \\nu \\nu$ as a clear signature\nof physics beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  Earlier studies have shown that the power consumption of an unbaffled stirred\nvessel decreases significantly when the regular blades are replaced by fractal\nones. In this paper, the physical explanation for this reduction is\ninvestigated using Direct Numerical Simulations at Re=1600. The gaps around the\nfractal blade perimeter create jets that penetrate inside the recirculation\nzone in the wake and break up the trailing vortices into smaller ones. This\naffects the time-average recirculation pattern on the suction side. The volume\nof the separation region is 7% smaller in the wake of the fractal blades. The\nlower torque of the fractal impeller is equivalent to a decreased transport of\nangular momentum; this difference stems from the reduced turbulent transport\ninduced by the smaller trailing vortices. The major difference in the turbulent\ndissipation is seen in the vicinity of trailing vortices, due to fluctuations\nof velocity gradients at relatively low frequencies.\n", "  In this paper, we study the defects effect on magnetic properties of a\nnano-square structure. This system is composed with alternate layers consisting\nof the spins {\\sigma}=3/2 and S=1. More precisely, we examine the effect of\ndifferent physical parameters which are: the coupling exchange interactions,\nthe external magnetic and the crystal fields applied on the studied system. The\nground state phase diagrams have been deduced and discussed in different planes\ninvolving such different parameters. Also we study the behavior of this\nnano-structure by using the Monte Carlo simulations. The behavior of the\nmagnetizations is studied as a function of the external magnetic field, the\ncrystal field, the temperature and the exchange coupling interactions. The\nmagnetizations and the hysteresis cycles are presented and discussed for fixed\nvalues of these parameters.\n", "  We consider the zero temperature coarsening in the Ising model in two\ndimensions where the spins interact within the Moore neighbourhood. The\nHamiltonian is given by $H = - \\sum_{<i,j>}{S_iS_j} - \\kappa\n\\sum_{<i,j'>}{S_iS_{j'}}$ where the two terms are for the first neighbours and\nsecond neighbours respectively and $\\kappa \\geq 0$. The freezing phenomena,\nalready noted in two dimensions for $\\kappa=0$, is seen to be present for any\n$\\kappa$. However, the frozen states show more complicated structure as\n$\\kappa$ is increased; e.g. local anti-ferromagnetic motifs can exist for\n$\\kappa>2$. Finite sized systems also show the existence of an iso-energetic\nactive phase for $\\kappa > 2$, which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. The\npersistence probability shows universal behaviour for $\\kappa>0$, however it is\nclearly different from the $\\kappa=0$ results when non-homogeneous initial\ncondition is considered. Exit probability shows universal behaviour for all\n$\\kappa \\geq 0$. The results are compared with other models in two dimensions\nhaving interactions beyond the first neighbour.\n", "  We propose new type of $q$-diffusive heat equation with nonsymmetric\n$q$-extension of the diffusion term. Written in relative gradient variables\nthis system appears as the $q$- viscous Burgers' equation. Exact solutions of\nthis equation in polynomial form as generalized Kampe de Feriet polynomials,\ncorresponding dynamical symmetry and description in terms of Bell polynomials\nare derived. We found the generating function for these polynomials by\napplication of dynamical symmetry and the Zassenhaus formula. We have\nconstructed and analyzed shock solitons and their interactions with different\n$q$. We obtain modification of the soliton relative speeds depending on value\nof $q$.For $q< 1$ the soliton speed becomes bounded from above and as a result\nin addition to usual Burgers soliton process of fusion, we found a new\nphenomena, when soliton with higher amplitude but smaller velocity is fissing\nto two solitons. q-Semiclassical expansion of these equations are found in\nterms of Bernoulli polynomials in power of $\\ln q$.\n", "  This book is concerned with the various aspects of hierarchical collective\nbehaviour which is manifested by most complex systems in nature. From the many\nof the possible topics, we plan to present a selection of those that we think\nare useful from the point of shedding light from very different directions onto\nour quite general subject. Our intention is to both present the essential\ncontributions by the existing approaches as well as go significantly beyond the\nresults obtained by traditional methods by applying a more quantitative\napproach then the common ones (there are many books on qualitative\ninterpretations). In addition to considering hierarchy in systems made of\nsimilar kinds of units, we shall concentrate on problems involving either\ndominance relations or the process of collective decision-making from various\nviewpoints.\n", "  We argue certain nonviolent local quantum field theory (LQFT) modification\nconsidered at the global horizon ($r=2M$) of a static spherically-symmetric\nblack hole can lead to adiabatic leakage of quantum information in the form of\nHawking particles. The source of the modification is (i) smooth at $r=2M$ and\n(ii) rapidly vanishing at $r\\gg2M$. Furthermore, we restore the unitary\nevolution by introducing extra quanta which departs slightly from the generic\nHawking emission without changing the experience of an infalling observer (no\ndrama). Also, we suggest that a possible interpretation of the\nBekenstein-Hawking bound as entanglement entropy may yield a nonsingular\ndynamical horizon behavior described by black hole thermodynamics. Hence by\ntreating gravity as a field theory, and considering its coupling to the matter\nfields in the Minkowski vacuum, we derive the conjectured fluctuations of the\nbackground geometry of a black hole.\n", "  The logarithmic derivative of a point process plays a key role in the general\napproach, due to the third author, to constructing diffusions preserving a\ngiven point process. In this paper we explicitly compute the logarithmic\nderivative for determinantal processes on $\\mathbb{R}$ with integrable kernels,\na large class that includes all the classical processes of random matrix theory\nas well as processes associated with de Branges spaces. The argument uses the\nquasi-invariance of our processes established by the first author.\n", "  The electronic system of the 1D Hubbard model is not stable due to Peierls\ninstability; the correlations are strong even for the weak Coulomb interaction.\nThe resulting strongly correlated state without Landau quisi--particle\nexcitations is known as the Luttinger liquid. Critical exponents of a\npower--law dependence of correlation functions at low energies differ\nsubstantially for the Luttinger and Fermi liquids. In this paper we evaluate\ntwo critical exponents that define non--trivial behavior of the density of\nelectronic states at low frequences and the momentum distribution of the\noccupation number nearby $k_F$.\n", "  We present results from large eddy simulations (LES) of extended wind-farms\nfor several turbine configurations with a range of different spanwise and\nstreamwise spacing combinations. The results show that for wind-farms arranged\nin a staggered configuration with spanwise spacings in the range\n$\\approx[3.5,8]$D, where $D$ is the turbine diameter, the power output in the\nfully developed regime depends primarily on the geometric mean of the spanwise\nand streamwise turbine spacings. In contrast, for the aligned configuration the\npower output in the fully developed regime strongly depends on the streamwise\nturbine spacing and shows weak dependence on the spanwise spacing. Of interest\nto the rate of wake recovery, we find that the power output is well correlated\nwith the vertical kinetic energy flux, which is a measure of how much kinetic\nenergy is transferred into the wind-turbine region by the mean flow. A\ncomparison between the aligned and staggered configurations reveals that the\nvertical kinetic energy flux is more localized along turbine rows for aligned\nwind-farms than for staggered ones. This additional mixing leads to a\nrelatively fast wake recovery for aligned wind-farms.\n", "  Recent large eddy simulations have led to improved parameterizations of the\neffective roughness height of wind farms. This effective roughness height can\nbe used to predict the wind velocity at hub-height as function of the geometric\nmean of the spanwise and streamwise turbine spacings and the turbine loading\nfactors. Meyers and Meneveau (Wind Energy 15, 305-317 (2012)) used these\nparameterizations to make predictions for the optimal wind turbine spacing in\ninfinitely large wind farms. They found that for a realistic cost ratio between\nthe turbines and the used land surface the optimal turbine spacing may be\nconsiderably larger than used in conventional wind farms. Here we extend this\nanalysis by taking the length of the wind farm, i.e.\\ the number of rows in the\ndownstream direction, into account and show that the optimal turbine spacing\nstrongly depends on the wind farm length. For small to moderately sized wind\nfarms the model predictions are consistent with spacings found in operational\nwind farms. For much larger wind farms the extended optimal spacing found for\ninfinite wind farms is confirmed.\n", "  We describe a generalization of the Coupled Wake Boundary Layer (CWBL) model\nfor wind-farms that can be used to evaluate the performance of wind-farms under\narbitrary wind inflow directions whereas the original CWBL model (Stevens et\nal., J. Renewable and Sustainable Energy 7, 023115 (2015)) focused on aligned\nor staggered wind-farms. The generalized CWBL approach combines an analytical\nJensen wake model with a \"top-down\" boundary layer model coupled through an\niterative determination of the wake expansion coefficient and an effective wake\ncoverage area for which the velocity at hub-height obtained using both models\nconverges in the \"deep-array\" portion (fully developed region) of the\nwind-farm. The approach accounts for the effect of the wind direction by\nenforcing the coupling for each wind direction. Here we present detailed\ncomparisons of model predictions with LES results and field measurements for\nthe Horns Rev and Nysted wind-farms operating over a wide range of wind inflow\ndirections. Our results demonstrate that two-way coupling between the Jensen\nwake model and a \"top-down\" model enables the generalized CWBL model to predict\nthe \"deep-array\" performance of a wind-farm better than the Jensen wake model\nalone. The results also show that the new generalization allows us to study a\nmuch larger class of wind-farms than the original CWBL model, which increases\nthe utility of the approach for wind-farm designers.\n", "  The paper presents observations and light curve solutions of the eclipsing\nstars CSS J075205.6+381909 and NSVS 691550. As a result their initial epochs\nwere determined. The target periods turned out almost equal to the previous\nvalues. We found that NSVS 691550 is overcontact system whose components are\nclose in temperature while CSS J075205.6+381909 has almost contact\nconfiguration and temperature difference of its components is around 2000 K.\nBoth targets undergo partial eclipses. Their stellar components seem to obey\nthe relations mass-temperature of MS stars.\n", "  We have investigated the confinement of 3-D vortices in specific cases of\nType-II ($\\kappa = 2$) nano-superconducting devices. The emergent pattern of\nvortices greatly depends on the orientation of an applied magnetic field\n(transverse or longitudinal), and the size of the devices (a few coherence\nlengths $\\xi$). Herein, cylindrical geometries are examined. The surface\nbarriers become very significant in these nano-systems, and hence the\ncharacteristics of the vortices become highly sensitive to the shape of the\nsystem and direction of an applied field. It is observed that nano-cylindrical\nsuperconductors, depending on their sizes, can display either first or second\norder phase transitions, under the influence of a longitudinal field. In the\nconfined geometries, nucleation of a giant vortex state composed of a n-quanta\nemerges for the longitudinal magnetic field.\n", "  Bone tissue mechanical properties and trabecular microarchitecture are the\nmain factors that determine the biomechanical properties of cancellous bone.\nArtificial cancellous microstructures, typically described by a reduced number\nof geometrical parameters, can be designed to obtain a mechanical behavior\nmimicking that of natural bone. In this work, we assess the ability of the\nparameterized microstructure introduced by Kowalczyk (2006) to mimic the\nelastic response of cancellous bone. Artificial microstructures are compared\nwith actual bone samples in terms of elasticity matrices and their symmetry\nclasses. The capability of the parameterized microstructure to combine the\ndominant isotropic, hexagonal, tetragonal and orthorhombic symmetry classes in\nthe proportions present in the cancellous bone is shown. Based on this finding,\ntwo optimization approaches are devised to find the geometrical parameters of\nthe artificial microstructure that better mimics the elastic response of a\ntarget natural bone specimen: a Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm that\nminimizes the norm of the difference between the elasticity matrices, and a\nPattern Search algorithm that minimizes the difference between the symmetry\nclass decompositions. The pattern search approach is found to produce the best\nresults. The performance of the method is demonstrated via analyses for 146\nbone samples.\n", "  Helioseismology can provide strong constraints on the evolution of Newton's\nconstant over cosmic time. We make use of the best possible estimate of 8640\ndays of low-$\\ell$ BISON data, corrected for the solar cycle variation, to\nobtain a new constraint on an evolving gravitational constant. In particular,\nby means of a Bayesian analysis we conclude that ${{\\dot{G}/G}_{\\rm\ntoday}}=(1.25\\pm 0.30) \\times 10^{-13} \\; \\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Our result, a\n4-$\\sigma$ effect, is more than one order of magnitude stronger than previous\nconstraints obtained with helioseismology. We also take into account possible\nsystematic effects by considering the theoretical uncertainties on the\nefficiency of the proton-proton $(pp)$ fusion cross-section. We show that\nmodels with variable $G$ significantly outclass models with no secular\nvariation of $G$, viz by a Bayes factor exceeding 30.\n", "  Quasi-periodic solutions of a nonlinear periodic polyharmonic equation in\n$\\R^n$, $n>1$, are studied. It is proven that there is an extensive\n\"non-resonant\" set ${\\mathcal G}\\subset \\R^n$ such that for every $\\vec k\\in\n\\mathcal G$ there is a solution asymptotically close to a plane wave\n$Ae^{i\\langle{ \\vec{k}, \\vec{x} }\\rangle}$ as $|\\vec k|\\to \\infty $.\n", "  This is an expository paper which has two parts. In the first part, we study\nquiver varieties of affine $A$-type from a combinatorial point of view. We\npresent a combinatorial method for obtaining a closed formula for the\ngenerating function of Poincar\\'e polynomials of quiver varieties in rank 1\ncases. Our main tools are cores and quotients of Young diagrams. In the second\npart, we give a brief survey of instanton counting in physics, where quiver\nvarieties appear as moduli spaces of instantons, focusing on its combinatorial\naspects.\n"]}
