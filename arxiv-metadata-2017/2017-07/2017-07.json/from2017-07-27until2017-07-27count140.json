Present thermal transport results on scarcely\nexplored specimens featuring nano-inclusions exhibit a small but clear\nTc-signature, traced to relatively appreciable phononic conduction, and its\ndominant electronic-scattering. The self-formed MgO as extended defects\nstrongly scatter the charge carriers and minutely the phonons with their\nlonger-mean-free-path near Tc. Conversely, near room temperature, the\nshorter-dominant-wavelength phonon's transport is hugely affected by these\nnanoparticles, undergoing ballistic to diffusive crossover and eventually\nentering the Ioffe-Regel mobility threshold regime.\n", "  This review reports some key results in theoretical investigations on\nconfigurations of lipid membranes and presents several challenges in this field\nwhich involve (i) exact solutions to the shape equation of lipid vesicles; (ii)\nexact solutions to the governing equations of open lipid membranes; (iii) neck\ncondition of two-phase vesicles in the budding state; (iv) nonlocal theory of\nmembrane elasticity; (v) relationship between symmetry and the magnitude of\nfree energy.\n", "  We study the modulational instability induced by periodic variations of\ngroup-velocity dispersion and nonlinear coefficients in a highly birefringent\nfiber. We observe, for each resonance order, the presence of two pairs of\ngenuine vector type sidebands, which are spectrally unbalanced between the\npolarization components for nonzero group-index mismatch, and one pair of\nbalanced sidebands emerging and dominating at increasing group-index mismatch.\nAs the conventional modulational instability manifests itself, it is partially\nsuppressed by the proximity of these new unstable regions.\n", "  In this paper we present the un-Casimir effect, namely the study of the\nCasimir energy in the presence of an unparticle component in addition to the\nelectromagnetic field contribution. The distinctive feature of the un-Casimir\neffect is a fractalization of metallic plates. This result emerges through a\nnew dependence of the Casimir energy on the plate separation that scales with a\ncontinuous power controlled by the unparticle dimension. As long as the perfect\nconductor approximation is valid, we find bounds on the unparticle scale that\nare independent of the effective coupling constant between the scale invariant\nsector and ordinary matter. We find regions of the parameter space such that\nfor plate distances around $5\\mu$m and larger the un-Casimir bound wins over\nthe other bounds.\n", "  Recent theoretical advances in elasticity of membranes following Helfrich's\nfamous spontaneous curvature model are summarized in this review. The governing\nequations describing equilibrium configurations of lipid vesicles, lipid\nmembranes with free edges, and chiral lipid membranes are presented. Several\nanalytic solutions to these equations and their corresponding configurations\nare demonstrated.\n", "  The supercritical instability in a system of two identical charged impurities\nin gapped graphene described in the continuous limit by the two-dimensional\nDirac equation has been studied. The case where the charge of each impurity is\nsubcritical, but their sum exceeds the critical value calculated in the version\nwith a single Coulomb center, is considered. Using the developed variational\nmethod, the dependence of the critical distance $R_{\\rm cr}$ between the\nimpurities on their total charge is calculated. The $R_{\\rm cr}$-value is found\nto grow as the total impurity charge increases and the quasiparticle band gap\ndecreases. The results of calculations are compared with those obtained in\nearlier researches.\n", "  The a-function is a proposed quantity defined for quantum field theories\nwhich has a monotonic behaviour along renormalisation group flows, being\nrelated to the beta-functions via a gradient flow equation involving a positive\ndefinite metric. We construct the a-function at four loop order for a general\ngauge theory with fermions and scalars, using only one and two loop\nbeta-functions; we are then able to provide a stringent consistency check on\nthe general three-loop gauge beta-function. In the case of an N=1\nsupersymmetric gauge theory, we present a general condition on the chiral field\nanomalous dimension which guarantees an exact all-orders expression for the\na-function; and we verify this up to fifth order (corresponding to the\nthree-loop anomalous dimension).\n", "  This thesis presents the work carried out in the testing of the ATLAS\nPhase-II Upgrade electronic systems in the future strips tracker after 2023, to\nbe installed for operations in the HL-LHC period. The high luminosity and\nnumber of interactions per crossing that will happen after the HL-LHC starts\nrequire a complete replacement of the ATLAS tracker. The systems that have been\ndefined for the Phase-II Upgrade will be designed to cope with that increased\nradiation and have the right granularity to maintain the performance with\nhigher pile-up.\n  In this thesis I present results on single modules and larger structures\ncomprising multiple modules.\n  In the context of the current ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker studies, I present\nan analysis of the data taken by the detector from the beginning of operation\nin 2010 until the first Long Shut-down in 2013. The analysis consists of an\nenergy loss study in the Semiconductor Tracker, a task the detector was not\ndesigned to perform.\n  However, the availability of the Time-over-Threshold of the signals generated\nby particles traversing the detector elements allows an estimation of the\ncharge deposited by the particles. This calculation of the energy loss is\ntypically used to perform particle identification, a feature that is usually\nnot required from the tracker. In addition, I present a study that proposes the\nuse of this energy loss calculation as a means of tracking radiation damage in\nthe silicon.\n", "  The Kibble-Zurek mechanism is the paradigm to account for the nonadiabatic\ndynamics of a system across a continuous phase transition. Its study in the\nquantum regime is hindered by the requisite of ground state cooling. We report\nthe experimental quantum simulation of critical dynamics in the\ntransverse-field Ising model by a set of Landau-Zener crossings in\npseudo-momentum space, that can be probed with high accuracy using a single\ntrapped ion. We test the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the quantum regime in the\nmomentum space and find the measured scaling of excitations is in accordance\nwith the theoretical prediction.\n", "  We present an approach to Jacobi and contact geometry that makes many facts,\npresented in the literature in an overcomplicated way, much more natural and\nclear. The key concepts are Kirillov manifolds and linear Kirillov structures,\ni.e., homogeneous Poisson manifolds and, respectively, homogeneous linear\nPoisson manifolds. The difference with the existing literature is that the\nhomogeneity of the Poisson structure is related to a principal ${\\rm\nGL}(1,{\\mathbb R})$-bundle structure on the manifold and not just to a vector\nfield. This allows for working with Jacobi bundle structures on nontrivial line\nbundles and drastically simplifies the picture of Jacobi and contact geometry.\nOur results easily reduce to various basic theorems of Jacobi and contact\ngeometry when the principal bundle structure is trivial, while giving new\ninsights into the theory.\n", "  The shape equation and linking conditions for a vesicle with two-phase\ndomains are derived. We refine the conjecture on the general neck condition for\nthe limit shape of a budding vesicle proposed by J\\\"{u}licher and Lipowsky\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{70}, 2964 (1993); Phys. Rev. E \\textbf{53}, 2670\n(1996)], and then we use the shape equation and linking conditions to prove\nthat this conjecture holds not only for axisymmetric budding vesicles, but also\nfor asymmetric ones. Our study reveals that the mean curvature at any point on\nthe membrane segments adjacent to the neck satisfies the general neck condition\nfor the limit shape of a budding vesicle when the length scale of the membrane\nsegments is much larger than the characteristic size of the neck but still much\nsmaller than the characteristic size of the vesicle.\n", "  We propose a flexible scheme based on three coupled optical microcavities\nwhich permits to achieve stable oscillations in the microwave range, the\nfrequency of which depends only on the cavity coupling rates. We find the\ndifferent dynamical regimes (soft and hard excitation) to affect the\noscillation intensity but not their period. This configuration may permit to\nimplement compact hyper-parametric sources on an integrated optical circuit,\nwith interesting applications in communications, sensing and metrology.\n", "  We investigate decoupling, one of the most important primitives in quantum\nShannon theory, by replacing the uniformly distributed random unitaries\ncommonly used to achieve the protocol, with repeated applications of random\nunitaries diagonal in the Pauli-$Z$ and -$X$ bases. This strategy was recently\nshown to achieve an approximate unitary $2$-design after a number of\nrepetitions of the process, which implies that the strategy gradually achieves\ndecoupling. Here, we prove that even fewer repetitions of the process achieve\ndecoupling at the same rate as that with the uniform ones, showing that rather\nimprecise approximations of unitary $2$-designs are sufficient for decoupling.\nWe also briefly discuss efficient implementations of them and implications of\nour decoupling theorem to coherent state merging and relative thermalisation.\n", "  This paper explores the relation between convex functions and the geometry of\nspace-times and semi-Riemannian manifolds (an investigation initiated by\nGibbons-Ishibashi). Specifically, we study geodesic connectedness. We give\ngeometric-topological proofs of geodesic connectedness for classes of\nspace-times to which known methods do not apply. For instance: A\nnull-disprisoning space-time is geodesically connected if it supports a proper,\nnonnegative strictly convex function whose critical set is a point. Timelike\nstrictly convex hypersurfaces of Minkowski space are geodesically connected. We\nalso give a criterion for the existence of a convex function on a\nsemi-Riemannian manifold. We compare our work with previously known results.\n", "  We establish the inverse spectral transform for the conservative Camassa-Holm\nflow with decaying initial data. In particular, it is employed to prove\nexistence of weak solutions for the corresponding Cauchy problem.\n", "  We develop a geometric criterion that unambiguously characterizes and also\nprovides a systematic and effective computational procedure for finding all the\nresidual symmetries of any gravitational Ansatz . We apply the criterion to\nseveral examples starting with the Collinson Ansatz for circular stationary\naxisymmetric spacetimes. We reproduce the residual symmetries already known for\nthis Ansatz including their conformal symmetry, for which we identify the\ncorresponding infinite generators spanning the two related copies of the Witt\nalgebra. We also consider the noncircular generalization of this Ansatz and\nshow how the noncircular contributions on the one hand break the conformal\ninvariance and on the other hand enhance the standard translations symmetries\nof the circular Killing vectors to supertranslations depending on the direction\nalong which the circularity is lost. As another application of the method, the\nwell-known relation defining conjugate gravitational potentials introduced by\nChandrasekhar, that makes possible the derivation of the Kerr black hole from a\ntrivial solution of the Ernst equations, is deduced as a special point of the\ngeneral residual symmetry of the Papapetrou Ansatz. We emphasize how the\nelection of Weyl coordinates, which determines the Papapetrou Ansatz, breaks\nalso the conformal freedom of the stationary axisymmetric spacetimes.\nAdditionally, we study AdS waves for any dimension generalizing the residual\nsymmetries already known for lower dimensions and exhibiting a very complex\ninfinite-dimensional Lie algebra containing three families: two of them span\nthe semidirect sum of the Witt algebra and scalar supertranslations and the\nthird generates vector supertranslations. We manage to comprehend that the\ninfinite connected group is the precise diffeomorphisms subgroup allowing to\nlocally deform the AdS background into AdS waves.\n", "  We provide a construction of the two-component Camassa-Holm (CH-2) hierarchy\nemploying a new zero-curvature formalism and identify and describe in detail\nthe isospectral set associated to all real-valued, smooth, and bounded\nalgebro-geometric solutions of the $n$th equation of the stationary CH-2\nhierarchy as the real $n$-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$. We employ\nDubrovin-type equations for auxiliary divisors and certain aspects of direct\nand inverse spectral theory for self-adjoint singular Hamiltonian systems. In\nparticular, we employ Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for singular (canonical)\nHamiltonian systems.\n  While we focus primarily on the case of stationary algebro-geometric CH-2\nsolutions, we note that the time-dependent case subordinates to the stationary\none with respect to isospectral torus questions.\n", "  The electron states in the field of a charged impurity in graphene in a\nmagnetic field are studied numerically. It is shown that a charged impurity\nremoves the degeneracy of Landau levels converting them into bandlike\nstructures. As the charge of impurity grows, the repulsion of sublevels of\ndifferent Landau levels with the same value of orbital momentum takes place\nleading to the redistribution of the wave function profiles of these sublevels\nnear the impurity. By studying the polarization effects, it is shown in\nagreement with the recent experiments that the effective charge of impurity can\nbe very effectively tuned by chemical potential. If the chemical potential is\nsituated inside a Landau level, then the charge of impurity is strongly\ndiminished. In addition, the polarization function in this case has a peak at\nzero momentum, which leads to the sign-changing oscillations of the screened\npotential as a function of distance. If the chemical potential lies between the\nLandau levels, then the screened potential does not change sign, the screening\nis minimal, and the charged impurity can strongly affect the electron spectrum.\n", "  (2+1) dimensional topological quantum field theories with defect excitations\nare by now quite well understood, while many questions are still open for (3+1)\ndimensional TQFTs. Here we propose a strategy to lift states and operators of a\n(2+1) dimensional TQFT to states and operators of a (3+1) dimensional theory\nwith defects. The main technical tool are Heegard splittings, which allow to\nencode the topology of a three--dimensional manifold with line defects into a\ntwo--dimensional Heegard surface. We apply this idea to the example of BF\ntheory which describes locally flat connections. This shows in particular how\nthe curvature excitation generating surface operators of the (3+1) dimensional\ntheory can be obtained from closed ribbon operators of the (2+1) dimensional BF\ntheory. We hope that this technique allows the construction and study of more\ngeneral models based on unitary fusion categories.\n", "  We use numerical simulations to study the effect of particle friction on\nsuspension flows of non-Brownian hard particles. By systematically varying the\nmicroscopic friction coefficient $\\mu_p$ and the viscous number $J$, we build a\nphase diagram that identifies three regimes of flow: Frictionless, Frictional\nSliding, and Rolling. Using energy balance in flow, we predict relations\nbetween kinetic observables, confirmed by numerical simulations. For realistic\nfriction coefficient and small viscous numbers (below $J\\sim 10^{-3}$) we show\nthat the dominating dissipative mechanism is sliding of frictional contacts,\nand we characterize asymptotic behaviors as jamming is approached. Outside this\nregime, our observations support that flow belongs to the universality class of\nfrictionless particles. We discuss recent experiments in the context of our\nphase diagram.\n", "  The phi-charmonium dissociation reactions in hadronic matter are studied.\nUnpolarised cross sections for 12 reactions are calculated in the Born\napproximation, in the quark-interchange mechanism and with a\ntemperature-dependent quark potential. The potential leads to remarkable\ntemperature dependence of the cross sections. With the cross sections and the\nphi distribution function we calculate the dissociation rates of the charmonia\nin the interactions with the phi meson in hadronic matter. The dependence of\nthe rates on temperature and charmonium momentum is meaningful to the influence\nof phi mesons on charmonium suppression.\n", "  Recently de Palma et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63, 728 (2017)]\nproved---using Lagrange multiplier techniques---that under a non-zero input\nentropy constraint, a thermal state input minimizes the output entropy of a\npure-loss bosonic channel. In this note, we present our attempt to generalize\nthis result to all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by using\nsimilar techniques. Unlike the case of the pure-loss channel, we cannot prove\nthat the thermal input state is the only local extremum of the optimization\nproblem. %It is unclear to us why the same techniques do not lead to a proof\nfor amplifier channels. However, we do prove that, if the conjecture holds for\ngauge-covariant Gaussian channels, it would also hold for gauge-contravariant\nGaussian channels. The truth of the latter leads to a solution of the triple\ntrade-off and broadcast capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels. We\nnote that de Palma et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 160503 (2017)] have now proven\nthe conjecture for all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by\nemploying a different approach from what we outline here. Proving a multi-mode\ngeneralization of de Palma et al.'s above mentioned result---i.e., given a\nlower bound on the von Neumann entropy of the input to an $n$-mode lossy\nthermal-noise bosonic channel, an $n$-mode product thermal state input\nminimizes the output entropy---will establish an important special case of the\nconjectured Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI). The EPnI, if proven true,\nwould take on a role analogous to Shannon's EPI in proving coding theorem\nconverses involving quantum limits of classical communication over bosonic\nchannels.\n", "  We propose the digital quantum simulation of a minimal AdS/CFT model in\ncontrollable quantum platforms. We consider the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model\ndescribing interacting Majorana fermions with randomly distributed all-to-all\ncouplings, encoding nonlocal fermionic operators onto qubits to efficiently\nimplement their dynamics via digital techniques. Moreover, we also give a\nmethod for probing non-equilibrium dynamics and the scrambling of information.\nFinally, our approach serves as a protocol for reproducing a simplified\nlow-dimensional model of quantum gravity in advanced quantum platforms as\ntrapped ions and superconducting circuits.\n", "  We consider plasma consisting of electrons and ions in presence of a\nbackground neutrino gas and develop the magneto hydrodynamic equations for the\nsystem. We show that electron neutrino interaction can induce vorticity in the\nplasma even in the absence of any electromagnetic perturbations if the\nbackground neutrino density is left-right asymmetric. This induced vorticity\nsupport a new kind of Alfv\\'en wave whose velocity depends on both the external\nmagnetic field and on the neutrino asymmetry. The normal mode analysis show\nthat in the presence of neutrino background the Alfv\\'en waves can have\ndifferent velocities. We also discuss our results in the context of dense\nastrophysical plasma such as magnetars and show that the difference in the\nAlfv\\'en velocities can be used to explain the observed pulsar kick. We discuss\nalso the relativistic generalization of electron fluid in presence of\nasymmetric neutrino background.\n", "  Recently, Golterman and Shamir presented an effective field theory which is\nsupposed to describe the low-energy physics of the pion and the dilaton in an\n$SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental\nrepresentation. By employing this formulation with a slight but important\nmodification, we derive a relation between the dilaton mass squared~$m_\\tau^2$,\nwith and without the fermion mass~$m$, and the pion mass squared~$m_\\pi^2$ to\nthe leading order of the chiral logarithm. This is analogous to a similar\nrelation obtained by Matsuzaki and~Yamawaki on the basis of a somewhat\ndifferent low-energy effective field theory. Our relation reads\n$m_\\tau^2=m_\\tau^2|_{m=0}+KN_f\\hat{f}_\\pi^2m_\\pi^2/(2\\hat{f}_\\tau^2)+O(m_\\pi^4\\ln\nm_\\pi^2)$ with~$K=9$, where $\\hat{f}_\\pi$ and~$\\hat{f}_\\tau$ are decay\nconstants of the pion and the dilaton, respectively. This mass relation differs\nfrom the one derived by Matsuzaki and~Yamawaki on the points that\n$K=(3-\\gamma_m)(1+\\gamma_m)$, where $\\gamma_m$ is the mass anomalous dimension,\nand the leading chiral logarithm correction is~$O(m_\\pi^2\\ln m_\\pi^2)$.\nFor~$\\gamma_m\\sim1$, the value of the decay constant~$\\hat{f}_\\tau$ estimated\nfrom our mass relation becomes $\\sim50\\%$ larger than $\\hat{f}_\\tau$ estimated\nfrom the relation of Matsuzaki and~Yamawaki.\n", "  Single cell responses are shaped by the geometry of signaling kinetic\ntrajectories carved in a multidimensional space spanned by signaling protein\nabundances. It is however challenging to assay large number (>3) of signaling\nspecies in live-cell imaging which makes it difficult to probe single cell\nsignaling kinetic trajectories in large dimensions. Flow and mass cytometry\ntechniques can measure a large number (4 - >40) of signaling species but are\nunable to track single cells. Thus cytometry experiments provide detailed time\nstamped snapshots of single cell signaling kinetics. Is it possible to use the\ntime stamped cytometry data to reconstruct single cell signaling trajectories?\nBorrowing concepts of conserved and slow variables from non-equilibrium\nstatistical physics we develop an approach to reconstruct signaling\ntrajectories using snapshot data by creating new variables that remain\ninvariant or vary slowly during the signaling kinetics. We apply this approach\nto reconstruct trajectories using snapshot data obtained from in silico\nsimulations and live-cell imaging measurements. The use of invariants and slow\nvariables to reconstruct trajectories provides a radically different way to\ntrack object using snapshot data. The approach is likely to have implications\nfor solving matching problems in a wide range of disciplines.\n", "  The Dirac equation for an electron in a finite dipole potential has been\nstudied within the method of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The\nCoulomb potential of the nuclei that compose a dipole is regularized, by\nconsidering the finite nuclear size. It is shown that if the dipole momentum\nreaches a certain critical value, the novel type of supercriticality occurs;\nnamely, the wave function of the highest occupied electron bound state changes\nits localization from the negatively charged nucleus to the positively charged\none. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a spontaneous creation of an\nelectron-positron pair in vacuum, with each of the created particles being in\nthe bound state with the corresponding nucleus and partially screening it.\n", "  Helical and azimuthal magnetorotational instabilities operate in rotating\nmagnetized flows with relatively steep negative or extremely steep positive\nshear. The corresponding lower and upper Liu limits of the shear, which\ndetermine the threshold of modal growth of these instabilities, are\ncontinuously connected when some axial electrical current is allowed to pass\nthrough the rotating fluid. We investigate the nonmodal dynamics of these\ninstabilities arising from the non-normality of shear flow in the local\napproximation, generalizing the results of the modal approach. It is\ndemonstrated that moderate transient/nonmodal amplification of both types of\nmagnetorotational instability occurs within the Liu limits, where the system is\nstable according to modal analysis. We show that for the helical\nmagnetorotational instability this magnetohydrodynamic behavior is closely\nconnected with the nonmodal growth of the underlying purely hydrodynamic\nproblem.\n", "  Materials where the electronic bands have unusual topologies allow for the\nrealization of novel physics and have a wide range of potential applications.\nWhen two electronic bands with linear dispersions intersect at a point, the\nexcitations could be described as Weyl fermions which are massless particles\nwith a particular chirality. Here we report evidence for the presence of Weyl\nfermions in the ferromagnetic state of the low-carrier density, strongly\ncorrelated Kondo lattice system CeSb, from electronic structure calculations\nand angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements. When the applied magnetic\nfield is parallel to the electric current, a pronounced negative\nmagnetoresistance is observed within the ferromagnetic state, which is\ndestroyed upon slightly rotating the field away. These results give evidence\nfor CeSb belonging to a new class of Kondo lattice materials with Weyl fermions\nin the ferromagnetic state.\n", "  The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is the part of a photocurrent that\nswitches depending on the sense of circular polarization of the incident light.\nIt has been consistently observed in systems without inversion symmetry and\ndepends on non-universal material details. Here we find that in a class of Weyl\nsemimetals (e.g. SrSi$_2$) and three-dimensional Rashba materials (e.g. doped\nTe) without inversion and mirror symmetries, the injection contribution to the\nCPGE trace is effectively quantized in terms of the fundamental constants $e,\nh, c$ and $\\epsilon_0$ with no material-dependent parameters. This is so\nbecause the CPGE directly measures the topological charge of Weyl points, and\nnon-quantized corrections from disorder and additional bands can be small over\na significant range of incident frequencies. Moreover, the magnitude of the\nCPGE induced by a Weyl node is relatively large, which enables the direct\ndetection of the monopole charge with current techniques.\n", "  Spin-polarized quasiparticles can be easily created during spin-filtering\nthrough a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) in contact with a superconductor due to\npair breaking effects at the interface. A combination FI-N-FI sandwiched\nbetween two superconductors can be used to create and analyze such\nspin-polarized quasiparticles through their nonequilibrium accumulation in the\nmiddle metallic (N) layer. We report spin-polarized quasiparticle regulation in\na double spin-filter tunnel junction in the configuration NbN-GdN1-Ti-GdN2-NbN.\nThe middle Ti layer provides magnetic decoupling between two ferromagnetic GdN\nand a place for nonequilibrium quasiparticle accumulation. The two GdN(1,2)\nlayers were deposited under different conditions to introduce coercive\ncontrast. The quasiparticle tunneling spectra has been measured at different\ntemperatures to understand the tunneling mechanism in these double spin-filter\njunctions. The conductance spectra were found to be comparable to an asymmetric\nSINI'S-type tunnel junction. A hysteretic R-H loop with higher resistance for\nthe antiparallel configuration compared to parallel state was observed\nasserting the spin-polarized nature of quasiparticles. The hysteresis in the\nR-H loop was found to disappear for sub-gap bias current. This difference can\nbe understood by considering suppression of the interlayer coupling due to\nnonequilibrium spin-polarized quasiparticle accumulation in the Ti layer.\n", "  We demonstrate the ability to load, cool and detect singly-charged calcium\nions in a surface electrode trap using only visible and infrared lasers for the\ntrapped-ion control. As opposed to the standard methods of cooling using\ndipole-allowed transitions, we combine power broadening of a quadrupole\ntransition at 729 nm with quenching of the upper level using a dipole allowed\ntransition at 854 nm. By observing the resulting 393 nm fluorescence we are\nable to perform background-free detection of the ion. We show that this system\ncan be used to smoothly transition between the Doppler cooling and sideband\ncooling regimes, and verify theoretical predictions throughout this range. We\nachieve scattering rates which reliably allow recooling after collision events\nand allow ions to be loaded from a thermal atomic beam. This work is compatible\nwith recent advances in optical waveguides, and thus opens a path in current\ntechnologies for large-scale quantum information processing. In situations\nwhere dielectric materials are placed close to trapped ions, it carries the\nadditional advantage of using wavelengths which do not lead to significant\ncharging, which should facilitate high rate optical interfaces between remotely\nheld ions.\n", "  We demonstrate, within symmetry unrestricted time-dependent density\nfunctional theory, the existence of new effects in low-energy nuclear reactions\nwhich originate from superfluidity. The dynamics of the pairing field induces\nsolitonic excitations in the colliding nuclear systems, leading to qualitative\nchanges in the reaction dynamics. The solitonic excitation prevents collective\nenergy dissipation and effectively suppresses fusion cross section. We\ndemonstrate how the variations of the total kinetic energy of the fragments can\nbe traced back to the energy stored in the superfluid junction of colliding\nnuclei. Both contact time and scattering angle in non-central collisions are\nsignificantly affected. The modification of the fusion cross section and\npossibilities for its experimental detection are discussed.\n", "  We report on a combined photoluminescence imaging and atomic force microscopy\nstudy of single, isolated self-assembled InAs quantum dots (density <0.01\num^(-2) capped by a 95 nm GaAs layer, and emitting around 950 nm. By combining\noptical and scanning probe characterization techniques, we determine the\nposition of single quantum dots with respect to comparatively large (100 nm to\n1000 nm in-plane dimension) topographic features. We find that quantum dots\noften appear (>25% of the time) in the vicinity of these features, but\ngenerally do not exhibit significant differences in their non-resonantly pumped\nemission spectra in comparison to quantum dots appearing in defect-free\nregions. This behavior is observed across multiple wafers produced in different\ngrowth chambers. Our characterization approach is relevant to applications in\nwhich single quantum dots are embedded within nanofabricated photonic devices,\nwhere such large surface features can affect the interaction with confined\noptical fields and the quality of the single-photon emission. In particular, we\nanticipate using this approach to screen quantum dots not only based on their\noptical properties, but also their surrounding surface topographies.\n", "  The quantum Rabi model is in the scientific spotlight due to the recent\ntheoretical and experimental progress. Nevertheless, a full-fledged\nclassification of its coupling regimes remains as a relevant open question. We\npropose a spectral classification dividing the coupling regimes into three\nregions based on the validity of perturbative criteria on the quantum Rabi\nmodel, which allows us the use of exactly solvable effective Hamiltonians.\nThese coupling regimes are i) the perturbative ultrastrong coupling regime\nwhich comprises the Jaynes-Cummings model, ii) a region where non-perturbative\nultrastrong and non-perturbative deep strong coupling regimes coexist, and iii)\nthe perturbative deep strong coupling regime. We show that this spectral\nclassification depends not only on the ratio between the coupling strength and\nthe natural frequencies of the unperturbed parts, but also on the energy to\nwhich the system can access. These regimes additionally discriminate the\ncompletely different behaviors of several static physical properties, namely\nthe total number of excitations, the photon statistics of the field, and the\ncavity-qubit entanglement. Finally, we explain the dynamical properties which\nare traditionally associated to the deep strong coupling regime, such as the\ncollapses and revivals of the state population, in the frame of the proposed\nspectral classification.\n", "  We reconstruct quantum theory starting from the premise that, as Asher Peres\nremarked, \"Unperformed experiments have no results.\" The tools of modern\nquantum information theory, and in particular the symmetric informationally\ncomplete (SIC) measurements, provide a concise expression of how exactly\nPeres's dictum holds true. That expression is a constraint on how the\nprobability distributions for outcomes of different, mutually exclusive\nexperiments mesh together, a type of constraint not foreseen in classical\nthinking. Taking this as our foundational principle, we show how to reconstruct\nthe formalism of quantum theory in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Along the\nway, we derive a condition for the existence of a d-dimensional SIC.\n", "  Measurements of an object's temperature are important in many disciplines,\nfrom astronomy to engineering, as are estimates of an object's spatial\nconfiguration. We present the quantum optimal estimator for the temperature of\na distant body based on the black body radiation received in the far-field. We\nalso show how to perform separable quantum optimal estimates of the spatial\nconfiguration of a distant object, i.e. imaging. In doing so we necessarily\ndeal with multi-parameter quantum estimation of incompatible observables, a\nproblem that is poorly understood. We compare our optimal observables to the\ntwo mode analogue of lensed imaging and find that the latter is far from\noptimal, even when compared to measurements which are separable. To prove the\noptimality of the estimators we show that they minimise the cost function\nweighted by the quantum Fisher information---this is equivalent to maximising\nthe average fidelity between the actual state and the estimated one.\n", "  Population annealing is a sequential Monte Carlo scheme well-suited to\nsimulating equilibrium states of systems with rough free energy landscapes.\nHere we use population annealing to study a binary mixture of hard spheres.\nPopulation annealing is a parallel version of simulated annealing with an extra\nresampling step that ensures that a population of replicas of the system\nrepresents the equilibrium ensemble at every packing fraction in an annealing\nschedule. The algorithm and its equilibration properties are described and\nresults are presented for a glass-forming fluid composed of a 50/50 mixture of\nhard spheres with diameter ratio of 1.4:1. For this system, we obtain precise\nresults for the equation of state in the glassy regime up to packing fractions\n$\\varphi \\approx 0.60$ and study deviations from the BMCSL equation of state.\nFor higher packing fractions, the algorithm falls out of equilibrium and a free\nvolume fit predicts jamming at packing fraction $\\varphi \\approx 0.667$. We\nconclude that population annealing is an effective tool for studying\nequilibrium glassy fluids and the jamming transition.\n", "  We study glide protected topological (GSPT) phases of interacting bosons and\nfermions in three spatial dimensions certain on-site symmetries. They are\ncrystalline SPT phases, which are distinguished from a trivial product state\nonly in the presence of non-symmorphic glide symmetry. We classify these GSPT\nphases with various on-site symmetries such as $U(1)$ and time reversal, and\nshow that they can all be understood by stacking and coupling two-dimensional\nshort-range-entangled phases in a glide-invariant way. Using such a coupled\nlayer construction we study the anomalous surface topological orders of these\nGSPT phases, which gap out the two-dimensional surface states without breaking\nany symmetries. This framework is demonstrated in many examples, including the\nnon-symmorphic topological insulator with \"hourglass fermion\" surface states.\n", "  Among the most important goals in cosmology is detecting and quantifying\nsmall ($M_{\\rm halo}\\simeq10^{6-9}~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) dark matter (DM)\nsubhalos. Current probes around the Milky Way (MW) are most sensitive to such\nsubstructure within $\\sim20$ kpc of the halo center, where the galaxy\ncontributes significantly to the potential. We explore the effects of baryons\non subhalo populations in $\\Lambda$CDM using cosmological zoom-in baryonic\nsimulations of MW-mass halos from the Latte simulation suite, part of the\nFeedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. Specifically, we compare\nsimulations of the same two halos run using (1) DM-only (DMO), (2) full\nbaryonic physics, and (3) DM with an embedded disk potential grown to match the\nFIRE simulation. Relative to baryonic simulations, DMO simulations contain\n$\\sim2\\times$ as many subhalos within 100 kpc of the halo center; this excess\nis $\\gtrsim5\\times$ within 25 kpc. At $z=0$, the baryonic simulations are\ncompletely devoid of subhalos down to $3\\times10^6~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ within\n$15$ kpc of the MW-mass galaxy, and fewer than 20 surviving subhalos have\norbital pericenters <20 kpc. Despite the complexities of baryonic physics, the\nsimple addition of an embedded central disk potential to DMO simulations\nreproduces this subhalo depletion, including trends with radius, remarkably\nwell. Thus, the additional tidal field from the central galaxy is the primary\ncause of subhalo depletion. Subhalos on radial orbits that pass close to the\ncentral galaxy are preferentially destroyed, causing the surviving subhalo\npopulation to have tangentially biased orbits compared to DMO predictions. Our\nmethod of embedding a disk potential in DMO simulations provides a fast and\naccurate alternative to full baryonic simulations, thus enabling suites of\ncosmological simulations that can provide accurate and statistical predictions\nof substructure populations.\n", "  Timing observations of rapidly rotating neutron stars revealed a great number\nof glitches, observed both from canonical radio pulsars and magnetars. Among\nthem, 76 glitches have shown exponential relaxation(s) with characteristic\ndecay times ranging from several days to a few months, followed by a more\ngradual recovery. Glitches displaying exponential relaxation with single or\nmultiple decay time constants are analysed in terms of a model based on the\ninteraction of the vortex lines with the toroidal arrangement of flux tubes in\nthe outer core of the neutron star. Model results agree with the observed\ntimescales in general. Thus, the glitch phenomenon can be used to deduce\nvaluable information about neutron star structure, in particular on the\ninterior magnetic field configuration which is unaccessible from surface\nobservations. One immediate conclusion is that the magnetar glitch data are\nbest explained with a much cooler core and therefore require that direct Urca\ntype fast cooling mechanisms should be effective for magnetars.\n", "  In this article we address a problem of determination of light pressure upon\nspace structures of the complex geometric shape. For the surface element, we\nwrote a condition that this element can interact with light only from the front\nside, not from the back side. This condition To in the form of series of\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind. Chebyshev expansion lets us move to\nthe series of tensors of increasing rank for the problem of determination of\nforce and moment. We obtained expressions for the fiber method for\ndetermination of light pressure on space structures of complex geometry taking\ninto account self--shadowing and reflections within the structure. We also give\nthe expressions for tensor parametrization by the specularity coefficient in\ncase of specular-diffuse reflection. For these expressions we calculated the\nprincipal moment and force upon two-sided flat solar sail, spherical and\ncylindrical bodies, and approximated light pressure upon a perspective space\nobservatory Millimetron. The proposed expressions can be used in the ballistic\nanalysis of solar sails and other space objects, which are significantly\naffected by the radiation pressure. Also, these results can be used to analyze\nthe dynamics of movement of large-scale space structures around the center of\ngravity under the light pressure.\n", "  The energy spectrum of muons at ground level in air showers are studied and a\nnew observable is proposed to constrain hadronic interaction models used in air\nshower simulations. An asymmetric Gaussian function is proposed to describe the\nmuon ground energy spectrum and its parameters are studied regarding primary\nparticle, energy and hadronic interaction models. Based on two realistic\nmeasurements of the muon density at a given distance from the shower axis, a\nnew observable (\\rmu) is defined. Considering realistic values of detector\nresolutions and number of measured events, it is also shown \\rmu can be\nsuccessfully used to constrain low and high hadronic interaction models. The\nstudy is focused in the energy range between $10^{17.5}$ and $10^{18.0}$ eV\nbecause of the importance of this interval for particle physics and\nastrophysical models. The constraining power of the new observable is shown to\nbe large within current experimental capabilities.\n", "  One of the formulations of Heisenberg uncertainty principle, concerning\nso-called measurement uncertainty, states that the measurement of one\nobservable modifies the statistics of the other. Here, we derive such a\nmeasurement uncertainty principle from two comprehensible assumptions:\nimpossibility of instantaneous messaging at a distance (no-signaling), and\nviolation of Bell inequalities (non-locality). The uncertainty is established\nfor a pair of observables of one of two spatially separated systems that\nexhibit non-local correlations. To this end, we introduce a gentle form of\nmeasurement which acquires partial information about one of the observables. We\nthen bound disturbance of the remaining observables by the amount of\ninformation gained from the gentle measurement, minus a correction depending on\nthe degree of non-locality. The obtained quantitative expression resembles the\nquantum mechanical formulations, yet it is derived without the quantum\nformalism and complements the known qualitative effect of disturbance implied\nby non-locality and no-signaling.\n", "  The azimuthal width of the di-hadron correlations in p$+$p collisons, beyond\nthe fragmentation transverse momentum, $j_T$, is dominated by $k_T$, the\nso-called intrinsic transverse momentum of a parton in a nucleon, which can be\nmeasured. The predicted azimuthal broadening in A$+$A collisions should produce\na larger $k_T$ than in p$+$p collisions. The present work introduces the\nobservation that the $k_T$ measured in p$+$p collisions for di-hadrons with\n$p_{Tt}$ and $p_{Ta}$ must be reduced to compensate for the energy loss of both\nthe trigger and away parent partons when comparing to the $k_T$ measured with\nthe same di-hadron $p_{Tt}$ and $p_{Ta}$ in Au$+$Au collisions. This idea is\napplied to a recent STAR di-hadron measurement, with result\n$\\langle{\\hat{q}L}\\rangle=2.1\\pm 0.6$ GeV$^2$. This is more precise but in\nagreement with a theoretical calulation of\n$\\langle{\\hat{q}L}\\rangle=14^{+42}_{-14}$ GeV$^2$ using the same data. Assuming\na length $\\langle{L}\\rangle\\approx 7$ fm for central Au$+$Au collisions the\npresent result gives $\\hat{q}=0.30\\pm 0.09$ GeV$^2$/fm, in fair agreement with\nthe JET collaboration result of $\\hat{q}\\approx 1.2\\pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm at\ninitial time $\\tau_0=0.6$ fm/c in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV.\n", "  A modified-gravity theory with a four-form field strength $F$, a variable\ngravitational coupling parameter $G(F)$, and a standard matter action is\nconsidered here. Maxwell and Einstein equations are now derived when including\nto action also derivates of $F$. The energy momentum tensor of the 4-form field\ncontains both the part, which is typical for the fundamental (pseudo)scalar,\nand the part, which cancels the divergent contribution of the zero-point\nenergies of quantum fields to the vacuum energy and thus leads to the natural\nnullification of the cosmological constant in Minkowski vacuum.\n", "  Compound-specific chlorine/bromine isotope analysis (CSIA-Cl/Br) has become a\nuseful approach for degradation pathway investigation and source appointment of\nhalogenated organic pollutants (HOPs). CSIA-Cl/Br is usually conducted by gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which could be negatively impacted by\nchlorine and bromine isotope fractionation of HOPs on GC columns. In this\nstudy, 31 organochlorines and 4 organobromines were systematically investigated\nin terms of Cl/Br isotope fractionation on GC columns using GC-double focus\nmagnetic-sector high resolution MS (GC-DFS-HRMS). On-column chlorine/bromine\nisotope fractionation behaviors of the HOPs were explored, presenting various\nisotope fractionation modes and extents. Twenty-nine HOPs exhibited inverse\nisotope fractionation, and only polychlorinated biphenyl-138 (PCB-138) and\nPCB-153 presented normal isotope fractionation. And no observable isotope\nfractionation was found for the rest four HOPs, i.e., PCB-101,\n1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran, PCB-180 and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran.\nThe isotope fractionation extents of different HOPs varied from below the\nobservable threshold (0.50%) to 7.31% (PCB-18). The mechanisms of the on-column\nchlorine/bromine isotope fractionation were tentatively interpreted with the\nCraig-Gordon model and a modified two-film model. Inverse isotope effects and\nnormal isotope effects might contribute to the total isotope effects together\nand thus determine the isotope fractionation directions and extents. Proposals\nderived from the main results of this study for CSIA-Cl/Br research were\nprovided for improving the precision and accuracy of CSIA-Cl/Br results. The\nfindings of this study will shed light on the development of CSIA-Cl/Br methods\nusing GC-MS techniques, and help to implement the research using CSIA-Cl/Br to\ninvestigate the environmental behaviors and pollution sources of HOPs.\n", "  By assuming the kinetic coupling $f^{2}(\\phi)FF$ of the effective inflaton\nfield $\\phi$ with the electromagnetic field, we explore magnetogenesis during\nthe inflation and preheating stages in the Starobinsky model. We consider the\ncase of the exponential coupling function $f(\\phi)=\\exp(\\alpha\\phi/M_{p})$ and\nshow that for $\\alpha \\sim 12-15$ it is possible to generate the large scale\nmagnetic fields with strength $\\gtrsim 10^{-15}$ Gauss at the present epoch.\nThe spectrum of generated magnetic fields is blue with the spectral index\n$n=1+s$, $s>0$. We have found that for the relevant values of the coupling\nparameter, $\\alpha=12-15$, model avoids the back-reaction problem for all\nrelevant modes.\n", "  We observe that the string field theory actions for the topological sigma\nmodels describe higher or categorified Chern-Simons theories. These theories\nyield dynamical equations for connective structures on higher principal\nbundles. As a special case, we consider holomorphic higher Chern-Simons theory\non the ambitwistor space of four-dimensional space-time. In particular, we\npropose a higher ambitwistor space action functional for maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  Quantum speed limits set an upper bound to the rate at which a quantum system\ncan evolve and as such can be used to analyze the scrambling of information. To\nthis end, we consider the survival probability of a thermofield double state\nunder unitary time-evolution which is related to the analytic continuation of\nthe partition function. We provide an exponential lower bound to the survival\nprobability with a rate governed by the inverse of the energy fluctuations of\nthe initial state. Further, we elucidate universal features of the\nnon-exponential behavior at short and long times of evolution that follow from\nthe analytic properties of the survival probability and its Fourier transform,\nboth for systems with a continuous and a discrete energy spectrum. We find the\nspectral form factor in a number of illustrative models, notably we obtain the\nexact answer in the Gaussian unitary ensemble for any $N$ with excellent\nagreement with recent numerical studies. We also discuss the relationship of\nour findings to models of black hole information loss, such as the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model dual to AdS$_2$ as well as higher-dimensional versions\nof AdS/CFT.\n", "  Graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms packed into a hexagon lattice to host\ntwo pairs of massless two-dimensional Dirac fermions in the absence of or with\nnegligible spin-orbit coupling. It is known that the existence of non-zero\nelectric polarization in reduced momentum space which is associated with a\nhidden chiral symmetry will lead to the zero-energy flat band of zigzag\nnanoribbon. The Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly or non-conservation of chiral\ncharges at different valleys can be realized in a confined ribbon of finite\nwidth. In the laterally diffusive regime, the finite-size correction to\nconductivity is always positive and goes inversely with the square of the\nlateral dimension W, which is different from the finite-size correction\ninversely with W from boundary modes. This anomalous finite-size conductivity\nreveals the signature of the chiral anomaly in graphene, and is measurable\nexperimentally.\n", "  The renormalization method based on the Taylor expansion for asymptotic\nanalysis of differential equations is generalized to difference equations. The\nproposed renormalization method is based on the Newton-Maclaurin expansion.\nSeveral basic theorems on the renormalization method are proven. Some\ninteresting applications are given, including asymptotic solutions of quantum\nanharmonic oscillator and discrete boundary layer, the reductions and invariant\nmanifolds of some discrete dynamics systems. Furthermore, the homotopy\nrenormalization method based on the Newton-Maclaurin expansion is proposed and\napplied to those difference equations including no a small parameter.\n", "  We provide $poly\\log$ sparse quantum codes for correcting the erasure channel\narbitrarily close to the capacity. Specifically, we provide $[[n, k, d]]$\nquantum stabilizer codes that correct for the erasure channel arbitrarily close\nto the capacity if the erasure probability is at least $0.33$, and with a\ngenerating set $\\langle S_1, S_2, ... S_{n-k} \\rangle$ such that $|S_i|\\leq\n\\log^{2+\\zeta}(n)$ for all $i$ and for any $\\zeta > 0$ with high probability.\nIn this work we show that the result of Delfosse et al. is tight: one can\nconstruct capacity approaching codes with weight almost $O(1)$.\n", "  We consider the generalized Milne problem in non-conservative plane-parallel\noptically thick atmosphere consisting of two components - the free electrons\nand small dust particles. Recall, that the traditional Milne problem describes\nthe propagation of radiation through the conservative (without absorption)\noptically thick atmosphere when the source of thermal radiation located far\nbelow the surface. In such case, the flux of propagating light is the same at\nevery distance in an atmosphere. In the generalized Milne problem, the flux\nchanges inside the atmosphere. The solutions of the both Milne problems give\nthe angular distribution and polarization degree of emerging radiation. The\nconsidered problem depends on two dimensionless parameters W and (a+b), which\ndepend on three parameters: $\\eta$ - the ratio of optical depth due to free\nelectrons to optical depth due to small dust grains; the absorption factor\n$\\varepsilon$ of dust grains and two coefficients - $\\bar b_1$ and $\\bar b_2$,\ndescribing the averaged anisotropic dust grains. These coefficients obey the\nrelation $\\bar b_1+3\\bar b_2=1$. The goal of the paper is to study the\ndependence of the radiation angular distribution and degree of polarization of\nemerging light on these parameters. Here we consider only continuum radiation.\n", "  We study the dynamics of condensation for a stochastic continuous mass\ntransport process defined on a one-dimensional lattice. Specifically we\nintroduce three different variations of the truncated random average process.\nWe generalize hereby the regular truncated process by introducing a new\nparameter $\\gamma$ and derive a rich phase diagram in the $\\rho-\\gamma$ plane\nwhere several new phases next to the condensate or fluid phase can be observed.\nLastly we use an extreme value approach in order to describe the conditions of\na condensation transition in the thermodynamic limit. This leads us to a\npossible explanation of the broken ergodicity property expected for truncation\nprocesses.\n", "  The topology of the electromagnetic field around neutron stars severely\nimpacts pulsar physics. While most of the works assume a standard centred\ndipolar magnetic field model, recently some efforts have been made to explain\nhow inclusion of higher multipolar components could drastically change our\nunderstanding of these objects. Also, for simplicity, it has always been\nassumed that the magnetic moment coincides with the geometrical centre of the\nstar. However, lately, a more general picture has been put forward in which the\nmagnetic dipole moment is shifted off from the centre of the star. It has been\ndemonstrated that the rotating off-centred dipole can be expanded into\nmultipolar components. We study the effects of an off-centred rotating dipole\non various characteristic emission features of pulsars in vacuum. The\nreliability of the off-centred case and its consequences on the magnetic field\nline structure, shape of the polar caps, high energy and radio emission phase\nplots and corresponding light curves along with a comparison with the standard\ncentred case are discussed. It has been seen that an off-centred dipole breaks\nthe north-south symmetry and allows for more flexibility in radio and\nhigh-energy light-curves fitting and phase lag.\n", "  We examine quantum corrections of time delay arising in the gravitational\nfield of a spinning oblate source. Low-energy quantum effects occurring in Kerr\ngeometry are derived within a framework where general relativity is fully seen\nas an effective field theory. By employing such a pattern, gravitational\nradiative modifications of Kerr metric are derived from the energy-momentum\ntensor of the source, which at lowest order in the fields is modelled as a\npoint mass. Therefore, in order to describe a quantum corrected version of time\ndelay in the case in which the source body has a finite extension, we introduce\na hybrid scheme where quantum fluctuations affect only the monopole term\noccurring in the multipole expansion of the Newtonian potential. The predicted\nquantum deviation from the corresponding classical value turns out to be too\nsmall to be detected in the next future, showing that new models should be\nexamined in order to test low-energy quantum gravity within the solar system.\n", "  We review recent developments in electronic structure calculations that go\nbeyond state-of-the-art methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and\ndynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Specifically, we discuss the following\nmethods: GW as implemented in the Vienna {\\it ab initio} simulation package\n(VASP) with the self energy on the imaginary frequency axis, GW+DMFT, and ab\ninitio dynamical vertex approximation (D$\\Gamma$A). The latter includes the\nphysics of GW, DMFT and non-local correlations beyond, and allows for\ncalculating (quantum) critical exponents. We present results obtained by the\nthree methods with a focus on the benchmark material SrVO$_3$.\n", "  The electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of CoBr2 monolayer are\nstudied in the frame-work of the density-functional theory (DFT) combined with\ntight-binding (TB) modeling in terms of Wannier basis. Our DFT investigation\nand Monte Carlo simulation show that there exists intrinsic two-dimensional\nferromagnetism in the CoBr2 monolayer thanks to large out-of-plane\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropic energy. Our further study shows that the\nspin-orbits coupling makes it become a topologically nontrivial insulator with\nquantum anomalous Hall effect and topological Chern number C=4, and its edge\nstates can be manipulated by changing the width of its nanoribbons and applying\nstrains. The CoBr2 monolayer can be exfoliated from the layered CoBr2 bulk\nmaterial because its exfoliation energy is between those of graphene and MoS2\nmonolayer and it is dynamically stable. These results make us believe that the\nCoBr2 monolayer can make a promising spintronic material for future\nhigh-performance devices.\n", "  At present, there are several measurements of $B$ decays that exhibit\ndiscrepancies with the predictions of the SM, and suggest the presence of new\nphysics (NP) in $b \\to s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ transitions. Many NP models have been\nproposed as explanations. These involve the tree-level exchange of a leptoquark\n(LQ) or a flavor-changing $Z'$ boson. In this paper we examine whether it is\npossible to distinguish the various models via CP-violating effects in $B \\to\nK^{(*)} \\mu^+ \\mu^-$. Using fits to the data, we find the following results. Of\nall possible LQ models, only three can explain the data, and these are all\nequivalent as far as $b \\to s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ processes are concerned. In this\nsingle LQ model, the weak phase of the coupling can be large, leading to some\nsizeable CP asymmetries in $B \\to K^{(*)} \\mu^+ \\mu^-$. There is a spectrum of\n$Z'$ models; the key parameter is $g_L^{\\mu\\mu}$, which describes the strength\nof the $Z'$ coupling to $\\mu^+\\mu^-$. If $g_L^{\\mu\\mu}$ is small (large), the\nconstraints from $B^0_s$-${\\bar B}^0_s$ mixing are stringent (weak), leading to\na small (large) value of the NP weak phase, and corresponding small (large) CP\nasymmetries. We therefore find that the measurement of CP-violating asymmetries\nin $B \\to K^{(*)} \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ can indeed distinguish among NP $b \\to s \\mu^+\n\\mu^-$ models\n", "  We study by quantum Monte Carlo simulations the ground state of a\nharmonically confined dipolar Bose gas with aligned dipole moments, and with\nthe inclusion of a repulsive two-body potential of varying range. Two different\nlimits can be clearly identified, namely a classical one in which the\nattractive part of the dipolar interaction dominates and the system forms an\nordered array of parallel filaments, and a quantum-mechanical one, wherein\nfilaments are destabilized by zero-point motion, and eventually the ground\nstate becomes a uniform cloud. The physical character of the system smoothly\nevolves from classical to quantum mechanical as the range of the repulsive\ntwo-body potential increases. An intermediate regime is observed, in which\nordered filaments are still present, albeit forming different structures from\nthe ones predicted classically; quantum-mechanical exchanges of\nindistinguishable particles across different filaments allow phase coherence to\nbe established, underlying a global superfluid response.\n", "  We classify the band degeneracies in 3D crystals with screw symmetry $n_m$\nand broken $\\mathcal P*\\mathcal T$ symmetry, where $\\mathcal P$ stands for\nspatial inversion and $\\mathcal T$ for time reversal. The generic degeneracies\nalong symmetry lines are Weyl nodes: Chiral contact points between pairs of\nbands. They can be single nodes with a chiral charge of magnitude $|\\chi|=1$ or\ncomposite nodes with $|\\chi|=2$ or $3$, and the possible $\\chi$ values only\ndepend on the order $n$ of the axis, not on the pitch $m/n$ of the screw.\nDouble Weyl nodes require $n=4$ or 6, and triple nodes require $n=6$. In all\ncases the bands split linearly along the axis, and for composite nodes the\nsplitting is quadratic on the orthogonal plane. This is true for triple as well\nas double nodes, due to the presence in the effective two-band Hamiltonian of a\nnonchiral quadratic term that masks the chiral cubic dispersion. If $\\mathcal\nT$ symmetry is present and $\\mathcal P$ is broken there may exist on some\nsymmetry lines Weyl nodes pinned to $\\mathcal T$-invariant momenta, which in\nsome cases are unavoidable. In the absence of other symmetries their\nclassification depends on $n$, $m$, and the type of $\\mathcal T$ symmetry. With\nspinless $\\mathcal T$ such $\\mathcal T$-invariant Weyl nodes are always double\nnodes, while with spinful $\\mathcal T$ they can be single or triple nodes.\n$\\mathcal T$-invariant triples nodes can occur not only on 6-fold axes but also\non 3-fold ones, and their in-plane band splitting is cubic, not quadratic as in\nthe case of generic triple nodes. These rules are illustrated by means of\nfirst-principles calculations for hcp cobalt, a $\\mathcal T$-broken, $\\mathcal\nP$-invariant crystal with $6_3$ symmetry, and for trigonal tellurium and\nhexagonal NbSi$_2$, which are $\\mathcal T$-invariant, $\\mathcal P$-broken\ncrystals with 3-fold and 6-fold screw symmetry respectively.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the spectra of gravitational waves produced by\nchiral symmetry breaking in dark quantum chromodynamics (dQCD) sector. The dark\npion ($\\pi$) can be a dark matter candidate as weakly interacting massive\nparticle (WIMP) or strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP). For a WIMP\nscenario, we introduce the dQCD sector coupled to the standard model (SM)\nsector with classical scale invariance and investigate the annihilation process\nof the dark pion via the $2\\pi \\to 2\\,\\text{SM}$ process. For a SIMP scenario,\nwe investigate the $3\\pi \\to 2\\pi$ annihilation process of the dark pion as a\nSIMP using chiral perturbation theory. We find that in the WIMP scenario the\ngravitational wave background spectra can be observed by future space\ngravitational wave antennas. On the other hand, when the dark pion is the SIMP\ndark matter with the constraints for the chiral perturbative limit and\npion-pion scattering cross section, the chiral phase transition becomes\ncrossover and then the gravitational waves are not produced.\n", "  The process of capture in the coorbital region of a solar system planet is\nstudied. Absolute capture likelihood in the 1:1 resonance is determined by\nrandomly constructed statistical ensembles numbering $7.24\\times 10^5$ of\nmassless asteroids that are set to migrate radially from the outer to the inner\nboundaries of the coorbital region of a Jupiter-mass planet. Orbital states\ninclude coorbital capture, ejection, collisions with the Sun and the planet and\nfree-crossing of the coorbital region. The relative efficiency of retrograde\ncapture with respect to prograde capture is confirmed as an intrinsic property\nof the coorbital resonance. Half the asteroids cross the coorbital region\nregardless of eccentricity and for any inclination less than $120^\\circ$. We\nalso find that the recently discovered retrograde coorbital of Jupiter,\nasteroid 2015 BZ509, lies almost exactly at the capture efficiency peak\nassociated with its orbital parameters.\n", "  We present developments in the calculation of reduced density matrices (RDMs)\nin the full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method. An\nefficient scheme is described to allow storage of RDMs across distributed\nmemory, thereby allowing their calculation and storage in large basis sets. We\ndemonstrate the calculation of RDMs for general states by using the\nrecently-introduced excited-state FCIQMC approach [J. Chem. Phys. 143, 134117\n(2015)] and further introduce calculation of transition density matrices (TDMs)\nin the method. These approaches are combined to calculate excited-state dipole\nand transition dipole moments for heteronuclear diatomic molecules, including\nLiH, BH and MgO, and initiator error is investigated in these quantities.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the possibility of the anti-evaporation of\ndegenerate Bardeen de-Sitter black hole. We solve the perturbation equations\naround the Nariai space-time. The solution of one of the perturbations related\nto the horizon size demonstrates that horizon of such black hole is constant.\nThe other perturbation is also found to be stable. We further study\nthermodynamical properties of such black holes. We observe double phase\ntransition at the Nariai limit.\n", "  Ferromagnetic (FM) and incommensurate spin-density wave (ISDW) states are an\nunusual set of competing magnetic orders that are seldom observed in the same\nmaterial without application of a polarizing magnetic field. We report, for the\nfirst time, the discovery of an ISDW state that is derived from a FM ground\nstate through a Fermi surface (FS) instability in Fe$_3$Ga$_4$. This was\nachieved by combining neutron scattering experiments with first principles\nsimulations. Neutron diffraction demonstrates that Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ is in an ISDW\nstate at intermediate temperatures and that there is a conspicuous re-emergence\nof ferromagnetism above 360 K. First principles calculations show that the ISDW\nordering wavevector is in excellent agreement with a prominent nesting\ncondition in the spin-majority FS demonstrating the discovery of a novel\ninstability for FM metals; ISDW formation due to Fermi surface nesting in a\nspin-polarized Fermi surface.\n", "  Deterministic loading of single atoms onto arbitrary two-dimensional lattice\npoints has recently been demonstrated, where by dynamically controlling the\noptical-dipole potential, atoms from a probabilistically loaded lattice were\nrelocated to target lattice points to form a zero-entropy atomic lattice. In\nthis atom rearrangement, how to pair atoms with the target sites is a\ncombinatorial optimization problem: brute-force methods search all possible\ncombinations so the process is slow, while heuristic methods are time-efficient\nbut optimal solutions are not guaranteed. Here, we use the Hungarian matching\nalgorithm as a fast and rigorous alternative to this problem of defect-free\natomic lattice formation. Our approach utilizes an optimization cost function\nthat restricts collision-free guiding paths so that atom loss due to collision\nis minimized during rearrangement. Experiments were performed with cold\nrubidium atoms that were trapped and guided with holographically controlled\noptical-dipole traps. The result of atom relocation from a partially filled\n7-by-7 lattice to a 3-by-3 target lattice strongly agrees with the theoretical\nanalysis: using the Hungarian algorithm minimizes the collisional and\ntrespassing paths and results in improved performance, with over 50\\% higher\nsuccess probability than the heuristic shortest-move method.\n", "  We report on the increased extraction of light emitted by solid-state sources\nembedded within high refractive index materials. This is achieved by making use\nof a local lensing effect by sub-micron metallic rings deposited on the sample\nsurface and centered around single emitters. We show enhancements in the\nintensity of the light emitted by InAs/GaAs single quantum dot lines into free\nspace as high as a factor 20. Such a device is intrinsically broadband and\ntherefore compatible with any kind of solid-state light source. We foresee the\nfabrication of metallic rings via scalable techniques, like nano-imprint, and\ntheir implementation to improve the emission of classical and quantum light\nfrom solid-state sources. Furthermore, while increasing the brightness of the\ndevices, the metallic rings can also act as top contacts for the local\napplication of electric fields for carrier injection or wavelength tuning.\n", "  Characterizing the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission at arcminute angular\nscales is needed to reliably remove foregrounds in cosmological 21-cm\nmeasurements. The study of this emission is also interesting in its own right.\nHere, we quantify the fluctuations of the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission\nusing visibility data for two of the fields observed by the TIFR GMRT Sky\nSurvey (TGSS). We have used the 2D Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) to estimate\nthe angular power spectrum $(C_{\\ell})$ from the visibilities. We find that the\nsky signal, after subtracting the point sources, is likely dominated by the\ndiffuse Galactic synchrotron radiation across the angular multipole range $240\n\\le \\ell \\lesssim 500$. We present a power law fit,\n$C_{\\ell}=A\\times\\big(\\frac{1000}{l}\\big)^{\\beta}$, to the measured $C_{\\ell}$\nover this $\\ell$ range. We find that $(A,\\beta)$ have values $(356\\pm109~{\\rm\nmK^2},2.8\\pm0.3)$ and $(54\\pm26~{\\rm mK^2},2.2\\pm0.4)$ in the two fields. For\nthe second field, however, there is indication of a significant residual point\nsource contribution, and for this field we interpret the measured $C_{\\ell}$ as\nan upper limit for the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission. While in both\nfields the slopes are consistent with earlier measurements, the second field\nappears to have an amplitude which is considerably smaller compared to similar\nmeasurements in other parts of the sky.\n", "  We present two strategies for combining dynamical pruning with the\nmulticonfiguration time-dependent Hartree method (DP-MCTDH), where dynamical\npruning means on-the-fly selection of relevant basis functions. The first\nstrategy prunes the primitive basis that represents the single-particle\nfunctions (SPFs). This is useful for smaller systems that require many\nprimitive basis functions per degree of freedom, as we will illustrate for\nNO$_2$. Furthermore, this allows for higher-dimensional mode combination and\npartially lifts the sum-of-product-form requirement onto the structure of the\nHamiltonian, as we illustrate for nonadiabatic 24-dimensional pyrazine. The\nsecond strategy prunes the set of configurations of SPF at each time step. We\nshow that this strategy yields significant speed-ups with factors between 5 and\n50 in computing time, making it competitive with the multilayer MCTDH method.\n", "  The diffusion of small solvent molecules in glassy polymers may take on a\nvariety of different forms. Fickian, anomalous, Case II, and super Case II\ndiffusion have all been observed, and theoretical models exist that describe\neach specific type of behavior. Here we present a single generalized kinetic\nmodel capable of yielding all these different types of diffusion on the basis\nof just two parameters. The principal determinant of the type of diffusion is\nobserved to be a dimensionless parameter, $\\gamma$, that describes the\ninfluence of solvent-induced swelling in lowering the potential barriers\nseparating available solvent sites. A second parameter, $\\eta$, which\ncharacterizes the effect of the solvent in reducing the potential energy of a\nsolvent molecule when at rest at an available site, only influences the type of\ndiffusion to a lesser extent. The theoretical analysis does not include any\neffects that are explicitly non-local in time, an example of which is the\ninclusion of polymer viscosity in the Thomas-Windle model; it thus represents a\nvariant of Fick's second law utilizing a concentration-dependent diffusivity\nwhen $\\eta$ is small. To check the significance of time-delayed swelling, a\nsimulation was performed of a modified model that contained a history-dependent\nterm. The results were found to be very similar to those in the time-local\nmodel.\n", "  Hydrodynamical simulations predict that a large amount of hydrogen (>0.1\nsolar masses) is removed from a hydrogen-rich companion star by the SN\nexplosion in the single-degenerate scenario of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).\nHowever, non-detection of hydrogen-rich material in the late-time spectra of\nSNe Ia suggests that the hydrogen mass stripped from the progenitor system is\n<0.001-0.058 solar masses. In this letter we include thermohaline mixing into\nself-consistent binary evolution calculations for the helium-enriched\nmain-sequence (HEMS) donor channel of SNe Ia for the first time. We find that\nthe swept-up hydrogen masses expected in this channel are around 0.10-0.17\nsolar masses, which is higher than the observational limits, although the\ncompanion star is strongly helium-enriched when the SN explodes. This presents\na serious challenge to the HEMS donor channel.\n", "  In recent years, the old paradigm according to which only high-mass black\nholes can launch powerful relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN) has\nbegun to crumble. The discovery of $\\gamma$-rays coming from narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), usually considered young and growing AGN harboring\na central black hole with mass typically lower than 10$^8$ M$_\\odot$, indicated\nthat also these low-mass AGN can produce powerful relativistic jets. The search\nfor parent population of $\\gamma$-ray emitting NLS1s revealed their connection\nwith compact steep-spectrum sources (CSS). In this proceeding we present a\nreview of the current knowledge of these sources, we present the new important\ncase of 3C 286, classified here for the fist time as NLS1, and we finally\nprovide a tentative orientation based unification of NLS1s and CSS sources.\n", "  We present a physically-motivated model involving the different processes\naffecting supernova dust grains as they are incorporated into the thermalized\nmedium within young massive star clusters. The model is used to explain the\nnear- to mid-infrared (NIR-MIR) excess found in such clusters and usually\nmodeled as a blackbody with temperature $\\sim (400-1000)$ K. In our approach,\ndust grains are efficiently produced in the clumpy ejecta of core-collapse\nsupernovae, fragmented into small pieces ($\\lesssim 0.05$ $\\mu$m) as they are\nincorporated into the hot and dense ISM, heated via frequent collisions with\nelectrons and the absorption of energetic photons. Grains with small sizes can\nmore easily acquire the high temperatures ($\\sim 1000$ K) required to produce a\nNIR-MIR excess with respect to the emission of foreground PAHs and starlight.\nHowever, the extreme conditions inside young massive clusters make difficult\nfor these small grains to have a persistent manifestation at NIR-MIR\nwavelengths as they are destroyed by efficient thermal sputtering.\nNevertheless, the chances for a persistent manifestation are increased by\ntaking into account that small grains become increasingly transparent to their\nimpinging ions as their size decreases. For an individual SN event, we find\nthat the NIR-MIR excess last longer if the time required to incorporate all the\ngrains into the thermalized medium is also longer, and in some cases,\ncomparable to the characteristic interval between supernova explosions. Our\nmodels, can successfully explain the near-infrared excesses found in the star\nclusters observed in M33 (Rela\\~no et al. 2016) assuming a low heating\nefficiency and mass-loading. In this scenario, the presence of the NIR-MIR\nexcess is an indication of efficient dust production in SNe and its subsequent\ndestruction\n", "  We consider a particle collision with a high center-of-mass energy near a\nBa\\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. We obtain the center-of-mass\nenergy of two general colliding geodesic particles in the BTZ black hole\nspacetime. We show that the center-of-mass energy of two ingoing particles can\nbe arbitrarily large on an event horizon if either of the two particles has a\ncritical angular momentum and the other has a non-critical angular momentum. We\nalso show that the motion of a particle with a subcritical angular momentum is\nallowed near an extremal rotating BTZ black hole and that a center-of-mass\nenergy for a tail-on collision at a point can be arbitrarily large in a\ncritical angular momentum limit.\n", "  We introduce a network growth model based on complete redirection: a new node\nrandomly selects an existing target node, but attaches to a random neighbor of\nthis target. For undirected networks, this simple growth rule generates\nunusual, highly modular networks. Individual network realizations typically\ncontain multiple macrohubs---nodes whose degree scales linearly with the number\nof nodes $N$. The size of the network \"nucleus\"---the set of nodes of degree\ngreater than one---grows sublinearly with $N$ and thus constitutes a\nvanishingly small fraction of the network. The network therefore consists\nalmost entirely of leaves (nodes of degree one) as $N\\to\\infty$.\n", "  When modelling the ionisation of gas in the intergalactic medium after\nreionisation, it is standard practice to assume a uniform radiation background.\nThis assumption is not always appropriate; models with radiative transfer show\nthat large-scale ionisation rate fluctuations can have an observable impact on\nstatistics of the Lyman-alpha forest. We extend such calculations to include\nbeaming of sources, which has previously been neglected but which is expected\nto be important if quasars dominate the ionising photon budget. Beaming has two\neffects: first, the physical number density of ionising sources is enhanced\nrelative to that directly observed; and second, the radiative transfer itself\nis altered. We calculate both effects in a hard-edged beaming model where each\nsource has a random orientation, using an equilibrium Boltzmann hierarchy in\nterms of spherical harmonics. By studying the statistical properties of the\nresulting ionisation rate and HI density fields at redshift $z\\sim 2.3$, we\nfind that the two effects partially cancel each other; combined, they\nconstitute a maximum $5\\%$ correction to the power spectrum\n$P_{\\mathrm{HI}}(k)$ at $k=0.04 \\, h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$. On very large scales\n($k<0.01\\, h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$) the source density renormalisation dominates; it\ncan reduce, by an order of magnitude, the contribution of ionising shot-noise\nto the intergalactic HI power spectrum. The effects of beaming should be\nconsidered when interpreting future observational datasets.\n", "  In this paper the $f(R)$ global monopole is reexamined. We provide an exact\nsolution for the modified field equations in the presence of a global monopole\nfor regions outside its core, generalizing previous results. Additionally, we\ndiscuss some particular cases obtained from this solution. We consider a setup\nconsisting of a possible Schwarzschild black hole that absorbs the topological\ndefect, giving rise to a static black hole endowed with a monopole's charge.\nBesides, we demonstrate how the asymptotic behavior of the Higgs field far from\nthe monopole's core is shaped by a class of spacetime metrics which includes\nthose ones analyzed here. In order to assess the gravitational properties of\nthis system, we analyse the geodesic motion of both massive and massless test\nparticles moving in the vicinity of such configuration. For the material\nparticles we set the requirements they have to obey in order to experience\nstable orbits. On the other hand, for the photons we investigate how their\ntrajectories are affected by the gravitational field of this black hole.\n", "  New physics, that is too heavy to be produced directly, can leave measurable\nimprints on the tails of kinematic distributions at the LHC. We use energetic\nQCD processes to perform novel measurements of the Standard Model (SM)\nEffective Field Theory. We show that the dijet invariant mass spectrum, and the\ninclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum, are sensitive to a dimension 6\noperator that modifies the gluon propagator at high energies. The dominant\neffect is constructive or destructive interference with SM jet production. We\ncompare differential next-to-leading order predictions from POWHEG to public 7\nTeV jet data, including scale, PDF, and experimental uncertainties and their\nrespective correlations. We constrain a New Physics (NP) scale of 3.5 TeV with\ncurrent data. We project the reach of future 13 and 100 TeV measurements, which\nwe estimate to be sensitive to NP scales of 8 and 60 TeV, respectively. As an\napplication, we apply our bounds to constrain heavy vector octet colorons that\ncouple to the QCD current. We project that effective operators will surpass\nbump hunts, in terms of coloron mass reach, even for sequential couplings.\n", "  The ADHM construction is a very strong scheme to construct the instantons in\nfour dimensions. We study an ADHM construction of instantons in $4n~(n\\geq2)$\ndimensions by generalizing this scheme. The higher-dimensional ADHM\nconstruction generates the $4n$-dimensional (anti-)self-dual instantons which\nsatisfy the (anti-)self-dual equation in $4n$ dimensions:\n$F(n)=\\pm\\ast_{4n}F(n)$. Here $F(n)$ is the $n$th wedge products of the gauge\nfield strength 2-form $F$. We also show that our scheme reproduces the known\n$4n$-dimensional one-instantons and there are multi-instanton solutions of the\n't Hooft type in the dilute instanton gas limit. Moreover we discuss a\nHarrington-Shepard type caloron in $4n$ dimensions and this monopole limit.\n", "  For the first time, Kataoka \\& Stawarz reported a clear detection of a hard\nX-ray excess, above $\\gtrsim$20 keV, in the high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac\nobject Mrk 421. We find that this feature may not be produced by the low-energy\npart of the same electron population that produced the Fermi/LAT $\\gamma$-ray.\nBecause of that it is required that the power-law electron energy go down to\n$\\gamma_{\\rm min}\\approx19$, which predicts a very strong radio emission (radio\nflux larger than the observed) even considering the synchrotron self-absorption\neffect. We investigate the possibility of this excess being produced from the\nspine/layer jet structure, which has been clearly detected in Mrk 421. We find\nthat (1) similar to one-zone modeling, the spine emissions provide good\nmodeling of the broadband spectral energy distribution, except for the hard\nX-ray excess; and (2) the hard X-ray excess can be well represented by the\nsynchrotron photons (from the layer) being inverse Compton scattered by the\nspine electrons.\n", "  The origin of the prompt high-energy ($>100$MeV) emission of Gamma-ray Bursts\n(GRBs), detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray\nSpace Telescope, is still under debate, for which both the external shock\norigin and internal dissipation origin have been suggested. In the internal\ndissipation scenario, the high energy emission is expected to exhibit\nsignificant temporal variability, tracking the keV/MeV fast variable behavior.\nHere, we report a detailed analysis on the Fermi data of GRB~170214A, which is\nsufficiently bright in the high energy to enable a quantitative analysis of the\ncorrelation between high-energy emission and keV/MeV emission with high\nstatistics. Our result shows a clear temporal correlation between high-energy\nand keV/MeV emission in the whole prompt emission phase as well as in two\ndecomposed short time intervals. Such correlation behavior is also found in\nsome other bright LAT GRBs, i.e., GRB 080916C, 090902B and 090926A. For these\nGRBs as well as GRB 090510, we also find the rapid temporal variability in the\nhigh-energy emission. We thus conclude that the prompt high-energy emission in\nthese bright LAT GRBs should be due to internal origin.\n", "  In the presence of an external magnetic field, the optical response of\ntwo-dimensional materials, whose charge carriers behave as massless Dirac\nfermions with arbitrary anisotropic Fermi velocity, is investigated. Using Kubo\nformalism, we obtain the magneto-optical conductivity tensor for these\nmaterials, which allows to address the magneto-optical response of anisotropic\nDirac fermions from the well known magneto-optical conductivity of isotropic\nDirac fermions. As an application, we analyse the combined effects of\nstrain-induced anisotropy and magnetic field on the transmittance, as well as\non the Faraday rotation, of linearly polarized light after passing strained\ngraphene. The reported analytical expressions can be a useful tool to predict\nthe absorption and the Faraday angle of strained graphene under magnetic field.\nFinally, our study is extended to anisotropic two-dimensional materials with\nDirac fermions of arbitrary pseudospin.\n", "  Accurate distances are fundamental to interpreting many measured properties\nof galaxies. Surprisingly, many of the best-studied spiral galaxies in the\nLocal Volume have distance uncertainties that are much larger than can be\nachieved with modern observations. Using Hubble Space Telescope optical\nimaging, we use the tip of the red giant branch method to measure the distances\nto six galaxies that are included in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies\nSurvey (SINGS) program and its offspring surveys. The sample includes M63, M74,\nNGC 1291, NGC 4559, NGC 4625, and NGC 5398. We compare our results with\ndistances reported to these galaxies based on a variety of methods. Depending\non the technique, there can be a wide range in published distances,\nparticularly from the Tully-Fisher relation. In addition, differences between\nthe Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function and Surface Brightness Fluctuation\ntechniques can vary between galaxies suggesting inaccuracies that cannot be\nexplained by systematics in the calibrations. Our distances improve upon\nprevious results as we use a well-calibrated, stable distance indicator,\nprecision photometry in an optimally selected field of view, and a Bayesian\nMaximum Likelihood technique that reduces measurement uncertainties.\n", "  The magnetic topology and field line random walk properties of a\nnanoflare-heated and magnetically confined corona are investigated in the\nreduced magnetohydrodynamic regime. Field lines originating from current sheets\nform coherent structures, called Current Sheet Connected (CSC) regions,\nextended around them. CSC field line random walk is strongly anisotropic, with\npreferential diffusion along the current sheets' in-plane length. CSC field\nline random walk properties remain similar to those of the entire ensemble but\nexhibit enhanced mean square displacements and separations due to the stronger\nmagnetic field intensities in CSC regions. The implications for particle\nacceleration and heat transport in the solar corona and wind, and for solar\nmoss formation are discussed.\n", "  The \"Tapered Gridded Estimator\" (TGE) is a novel way to directly estimate the\nangular power spectrum from radio-interferometric visibility data that reduces\nthe computation by efficiently gridding the data, consistently removes the\nnoise bias, and suppresses the foreground contamination to a large extent by\ntapering the primary beam response through an appropriate convolution in the\nvisibility domain. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of TGE in recovering\nthe diffuse emission power spectrum through numerical simulations. We present\ndetails of the simulation used to generate low frequency visibility data for\nsky model with extragalactic compact radio sources and diffuse Galactic\nsynchrotron emission. We then use different imaging strategies to identify the\nmost effective option of point source subtraction and to study the underlying\ndiffuse emission. Finally, we apply TGE to the residual data to measure the\nangular power spectrum, and assess the impact of incomplete point source\nsubtraction in recovering the input power spectrum $C_{\\ell}$ of the\nsynchrotron emission. This estimator is found to successfully recovers the\n$C_{\\ell}$ of input model from the residual visibility data. These results are\nrelevant for measuring the diffuse emission like the Galactic synchrotron\nemission. It is also an important step towards characterizing and removing both\ndiffuse and compact foreground emission in order to detect the redshifted $21\\,\n{\\rm cm}$ signal from the Epoch of Reionization.\n", "  The parameters of any model that satisfies the cosmological principle (the\nuniverse is homogeneous and isotropic on large scale), can be expressed through\ncosmographic parameters. In this paper, we perform this procedure for the\nCardassian model. We demonstrate a number of advantages of the approach used\nbefore traditional methods.\n", "  Rider, Sinclair and Xu (2013) introduced a solvable two charge ensemble of\ninteracting charged particles on the real line in the presence of the harmonic\noscillator potential. It can be seen as a special form of a grand canonical\nensemble with the total charge being fixed and unit charge particles being\nrandom. Moreover, it serves as an interpolation between the Gaussian orthogonal\nand the Gaussian symplectic ensembles and maintains the Pfaffian structure of\nthe eigenvalues. A similar solvable ensemble of charged particles on the unit\ncircle was studied by Shum and Sinclair (2014) and Forrester (2010). In this\npaper we explore the sharp asymptotic behavior of the number of unit charge\nparticles on the line and on the circle, as the total charge goes to infinity.\nWe establish extended central limit theorems, Berry-Esseen estimates and\nprecise moderate deviations using the machinery of the mod-Gaussian\nconvergence. Also a large deviation principle is derived using the\nG\\\"artner-Ellis theorem.\n", "  Accurate measurements of galaxy masses and sizes are key to tracing galaxy\nevolution over time. Cosmological zoom-in simulations provide an ideal test bed\nfor assessing the recovery of galaxy properties from observations. Here, we\nutilize galaxies with $M_*\\sim10^{10}-10^{11.5}M_{\\odot}$ at z~1.7-2 from the\nMassiveFIRE cosmological simulation suite, part of the Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) project. Using mock multi-band images, we compare intrinsic\ngalaxy masses and sizes to observational estimates. We find that observations\naccurately recover stellar masses, with a slight average underestimate of ~0.06\ndex and a ~0.15 dex scatter. Recovered half-light radii agree well with\nintrinsic half-mass radii when averaged over all viewing angles, with a\nsystematic offset of ~0.1 dex (with the half-light radii being larger) and a\nscatter of ~0.2 dex. When using color gradients to account for mass-to-light\nvariations, recovered half-mass radii also exceed the intrinsic half-mass radii\nby ~0.1 dex. However, if not properly accounted for, aperture effects can bias\nsize estimates by ~0.1 dex. No differences are found between the mass and size\noffsets for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Variations in viewing angle\nare responsible for ~25% of the scatter in the recovered masses and sizes. Our\nresults thus suggest that the intrinsic scatter in the mass-size relation may\nhave previously been overestimated by ~25%. Moreover, orientation-driven\nscatter causes the number density of very massive galaxies to be overestimated\nby ~0.5 dex at $M_*\\sim10^{11.5}M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  In teleparallel gravity, we apply Lorenz type gauge fixing to cope with\nredundant degrees of freedom in the vierbein field. This condition is mainly to\nrestore the Lorentz symmetry of the teleparallel torsion scalar. In\ncosmological application, this technique provides standard cosmology,\nturnaround, bounce or $\\Lambda$CDM as separate scenarios. We reconstruct the\n$f(T)$ gravity which generates these models. We study the stability of the\nsolutions by analyzing the corresponding phase portraits. Also, we investigate\nLorenz gauge in the unimodular coordinates, it leads to unify a nonsingular\nbounce and standard model cosmology in a single model, where crossing the\nphantom divide line is achievable through a finite-time singularity of Type IV\nassociated with a de Sitter fixed point. We reconstruct the unimodular $f(T)$\ngravity which generates the unified cosmic evolution showing the role of the\ntorsion gravity to establish a healthy bounce scenario.\n", "  In their work, Yan et al. [Phys. Rev. B 88, 121403 (2013)] employing density\nfunctional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, demonstrate that silicene\nand germanene show weaker Kohn anomalies in the $\\Gamma$-$E_g$ and $K$-$A_1$\nphonon modes, compared to graphene. Furthermore, they compute the electron\nphonon (e-ph) coupling matrix elements using the frozen phonon approach and\nfound that in silicene the average e-ph coupling matrix-element square over the\nFermi surface, $\\langle g_{{\\bf q}\\nu}^2\\rangle_{F}$, is about 50 % of those in\ngraphene, but in germanene is weaker and nearly negligible. However, Yan et al.\nargues that the smaller Fermi velocity in silicene compensates the reduced\n$\\langle g_{{\\bf q}\\nu}^2\\rangle_{F}$, leading to phonon linewidths\n($\\gamma_{{\\bf q}\\nu}$) slightly larger than those in graphene. In this\nComment, we show that the DFPT and the frozen phonon results of Yan et al. for\nsilicene are inconsistent. Additionally, we have evaluated the e-ph coupling\nusing direct DFPT calculations, analytical relations, and frozen phonon\ncalculations, and we found systematically that $\\langle g_{{\\bf\nq}\\nu}^2\\rangle_{F}$ and $\\gamma_{{\\bf q}\\nu}$ in silicene are one order of\nmagnitude smaller than in graphene, in contrast to the conclusions of Yan et\nal.\n", "  On the basis of the coincidence of the physical dimensions (in natural units\n$\\hbar = c = 1$) of the Newton's gravitational constant $G_{N} $ and the\nphenomenological Fermi constant $G_{F} $ for weak interaction, it is suggested\nthat there is a certain similarity between weak forces, which are caused by the\nexchange of massive intermediate vector bosons with spin $S=1$, and \"superweak\"\ngravitational forces that can be caused by the exchange of \"supermassive\"\nhypothetical tensor bosons with spin $S=2$. By analogy with how the masses of\nintermediate bosons in the theory of electroweak interaction arise as a result\nof spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electromagnetic field due\nto its interaction with the nonlinear scalar Higgs field, the masses of\nhypothetical tensor bosons carrying gravitational interaction can also arise as\na result of spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry of the massless gravitons\nwhen they interact with a fundamental nonlinear scalar field in a flat\n4-dimensional space-time.\n", "  We show that measuring pairs of qubits in the Bell basis can be used to\nobtain a simple quantum algorithm for efficiently identifying an unknown\nstabilizer state of n qubits. The algorithm uses O(n) copies of the input state\nand fails with exponentially small probability.\n", "  As the focus of applied research in topological insulators (TI) evolves, the\nneed to synthesize large-area TI films for practical device applications takes\ncenter stage. However, constructing scalable and adaptable processes for\nhigh-quality TI compounds remains a challenge. To this end, a versatile van der\nWaals epitaxy (vdWE) process for custom-feature Bismuth Telluro-Sulfide TI\ngrowth and fabrication is presented, achieved through selective-area\nfluorination and modification of surface free-energy on mica. The TI features\ngrow epitaxially in large single-crystal trigonal domains, exhibiting armchair\nor zigzag crystalline edges highly oriented with the underlying mica lattice\nand only two preferred domain orientations mirrored at $180^\\circ$. As-grown\nfeature thickness dependence on lateral dimensions and denuded zones at\nboundaries are observed, as explained by a semi-empirical two-species surface\nmigration model with robust estimates of growth parameters and elucidating the\nrole of selective-area surface modification. Topological surface states\ncontribute up to 60% of device conductance at room-temperature, indicating\nexcellent electronic quality. High-yield microfabrication and the adaptable\nvdWE growth mechanism with readily alterable precursor and substrate\ncombinations, lend the process versatility to realize crystalline TI synthesis\nin arbitrary shapes and arrays suitable for facile integration with processes\nranging from rapid prototyping to scalable manufacturing.\n", "  We implement a spatially fixed mesh refinement under spherical symmetry for\nthe characteristic formulation of General Relativity. The\nCourant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) condition lets us deploy an adaptive resolution in\n(retarded-like) time, even for the nonlinear regime. As test cases, we\nreplicate the main features of the gravitational critical behavior and the\nspacetime structure at null infinity using the Bondi mass and the News\nfunction. Additionally, we obtain the global energy conservation for an extreme\nsituation, i.e. in the threshold of the black hole formation. In principle, the\ncalibrated code can be used in conjunction with an ADM 3+1 code to confirm the\ncritical behavior recently reported in the gravitational collapse of a massless\nscalar field in an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime. For the scenarios\nstudied, the fixed mesh refinement offers improved runtime and results\ncomparable to code without mesh refinement.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyse virtual black holes using the third\nquantization formalism. As the virtual black hole model depends critically on\nthe assumption that the quantum fluctuations dominate the geometry of spacetime\nat Planck scale, we will analyse the quantum fluctuations for a black hole\nusing third quantization. We will demonstrate that these quantum fluctuations\ndepend on the factor ordering chosen. So, we will show that only certain values\nof the factor ordering parameter are consistent with virtual black holes model\nof spacetime foam.\n", "  This experiment was conceived of as a method of transmitting information from\ninside a black hole to the outside. As it turns out, it doesn't work in the\nform described (and possibly not in any form), but the way in which Nature\nprevents quantum-mechanical effects from transmitting usable information using\nquantum correlations is illuminating. In the process, one can learn some\nquantum theory, as well as quantum optics.\n  The proposed scheme uses a double-slit experiment, in the manner of the\nDelayed Choice set up (see Kim et. al.), where the region where the\ninterference takes place (between \"signal\" photons) is spatially separated from\nthe region where the Delayed Choice (with \"idler\" photons) is made. Indeed,\nthis Double-Delayed Choice, which is this thought experiment, has one of the\nidler photons slip inside the event horizon and serves as the method to attempt\nto communicate from the inside to the outside.\n", "  We use the simulated gravitational-wave data to explore the evolution of the\nuniverse in light of current observations of the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Taking advantage of state-of-the-art\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo technique to constrain the basic cosmological\nparameters, the Hubble constant, present matter density parameter and equation\nof state of dark energy, we find that LIGO needs about, at least 5-year data\naccumulation, namely about 1000 events, to achieve the accuracy comparable to\nthe Planck result. We also find that, from a new information channel, the\nconstrained value of the Hubble constant from 1000 simulated events is more\nconsistent with the direct local observation by Riess et al. than the indirect\nglobal measurement by the Planck Collaboration at the $2\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel. The combination of gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals is\nvery prospective to reveal the underlying physics of the universe.\n", "  Recently, it has been shown that cross-correlating CMB lensing and 3D cosmic\nshear allows to considerably tighten cosmological parameter constraints. We\ninvestigate whether similar improvement can be achieved in a conventional\ntomographic setup. We present Fisher parameter forecasts for a Euclid-like\ngalaxy survey in combination with different ongoing and forthcoming CMB\nexperiments. In contrast to a fully three-dimensional analysis we find only\nmarginal improvement. Assuming Planck-like CMB data we show that including the\nfull covariance of the combined CMB and cosmic shear data improves the dark\nenergy figure of merit by only three per cent. The marginalized error on the\nsum of neutrino masses is reduced at the same level. For a next generation CMB\nsatellite mission such as Prism the predicted improvement of the dark energy\nfigure of merit amounts to approximately 25 per cent. Furthermore, we show that\nthe small improvement is contrasted by an increased bias in the dark energy\nparameters when the intrinsic alignment of galaxies is not correctly accounted\nfor in the full covariance matrix.\n", "  Recent rapid growth in the number of satellite-constellation programs for\nremote sensing and communications, thanks to the availability of small-size and\nlow-cost satellites, provides impetus for high capacity laser communication\n(lasercom) in space. Quantum communication can enhance the overall performance\nof lasercom, and also enables intrinsically hack-proof secure communication\nknown as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). Here, we report a quantum\ncommunication experiment between a micro-satellite (48 kg and 50 cm cube) in a\nlow earth orbit and a ground station with single-photon counters.\nNon-orthogonal polarization states were transmitted from the satellite at a\n10-MHz repetition rate. On the ground, by post-processing the received quantum\nstates at an average of 0.14 photons/pulse, clock data recovery and\npolarization reference-frame synchronization were successfully done even under\nremarkable Doppler shifts. A quantum bit error rate below 5% was measured,\ndemonstrating the feasibility of quantum communication in a real scenario from\nspace.\n", "  Matched filtering is a commonly used technique in gravitational wave searches\nfor signals from compact binary systems and from rapidly rotating neutron\nstars. A common issue in these searches is dealing with four extrinsic\nparameters which do not affect the phase evolution of the system: the overall\namplitude, initial phase, and two angles determining the overall orientation of\nthe system. The F-statistic maximizes the likelihood function analytically over\nthese parameters, while the B-statistic marginalizes over them. The\nB-statistic, while potentially more powerful and capable of incorporating\nastrophysical priors, is not as widely used because of the computational\ndifficulty of performing the marginalization. In this paper we address this\ndifficulty and show how the marginalization can be done analytically by\ncombining the four parameters into a set of complex amplitudes. The results of\nthis paper are applicable to both transient non-precessing binary coalescence\nevents, and to long lived signals from rapidly rotating neutron stars.\n", "  In classical mechanics, a nonrelativistic particle constrained on an $N-1$\ncurved hypersurface embedded in $N$ flat space experiences the centripetal\nforce only. In quantum mechanics, the situation is totally different for the\npresence of the geometric potential. We demonstrate that the motion of the\nquantum particle is \"driven\" by not only the the centripetal force, but also a\ncurvature induced force proportional to the Laplacian of the mean curvature,\nwhich is fundamental in the interface physics, causing curvature driven\ninterface evolution.\n", "  Recent experiments show no statistical impact of seal length on the\nperformance of long elastomeric seals in relatively smooth test fixtures.\nMotivated by these results, we analytically and computationally investigate the\ncombined effects of seal length and compressibility on the maximum differential\npressure a seal can support. We present a Saint-Venant type analytic shear lag\nsolution for slightly compressible seals with large aspect ratios, which\ncompares well with nonlinear finite element simulations in regions far from the\nends of the seal. However, at the high- and low-pressure ends, where fracture\nis observed experimentally, the analytic solution is in poor agreement with\ndetailed finite element calculations. Nevertheless, we show that the analytic\nsolution provides far-field stress measures that correlate, over a range of\naspect ratios and bulk moduli, the calculated energy release rates for the\ngrowth of small cracks at the two ends of the seal. Thus a single finite\nelement simulation coupled with the analytic solution can be used to determine\ntendencies for fracture at the two ends of the seal over a wide range of\ngeometry and compressibility. Finally, using a hypothetical critical energy\nrelease rate, predictions for whether a crack on the high-pressure end will\nbegin to grow before or after a crack on the low-pressure end begins to grow\nare made using the analytic solution and compared with finite element\nsimulations for finite deformation, hyperelastic seals.\n", "  230 MeV proton beam out of a cyclotron was delivered into a Zebra multi\nlayered IC detector (IBA) calibrated in terms of penetration range in water.\nThe analysis of the measured Bragg peak determines penetration range in water\nwhich can be subsequently converted into proton beam energy using Range-Energy\ntables. We extended this analysis to obtain an estimate of the beam energy\nspread out of the cyclotron. Using Monte Carlo simulations we established the\ncorrelation between Bragg peak shape parameters (width at 50% and 80% dose\nlevels, distal falloff) and penetration range for a monoenergetic proton beam.\nThen we studied how this correlation changes when the shape of Bragg peak is\ndistorted by the beam focusing conditions. We found that small field size or\ndiverging beam cause Bragg peak deformation predominantly in the proximal\nregion. The distal shape of the renormalized Bragg peaks stays nearly constant.\nThis excludes usage of Bragg peak width parameters for energy spread estimates.\nThe measured Bragg peaks had an average distal falloff of 4.86mm, which\ncorresponds to an effective range of 35.5cm for a monoenergetic beam. The\n32.7cm measured penetration range is 2.8cm less. Passage of a 230 MeV proton\nbeam through a 2.8cm thick slab of water results in a 0.56 MeV energy spread.\nAs a final check, we confirmed agreement between shapes of the measured Bragg\npeak and one generated by Monte-Carlo code for proton beam with 0.56 MeV energy\nspread.\n", "  In this paper, we detail the scientific objectives and outline a strawman\npayload of the SOLAR sail Investigation of the Sun (SOLARIS). The science\nobjectives are to study the 3D structure of the solar magnetic and velocity\nfield, the variation of total solar irradiance with latitude, and the structure\nof the corona. We show how we can meet these science objective using solar-sail\ntechnologies currently under development. We provide a tentative mission\nprofile considering several trade-off approaches. We also provide a tentative\nmass budget breakdown and a perspective for a programmatic implementation.\n", "  In this report we briefly summarize the set-up and results for direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flows with riblets. The DNS\nare carried out with OpenFOAM which allows the use of an unstructured mesh. The\npresent results were presented at the European Drag Reduction and Flow Control\nMeeting in 2015.\n", "  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has provided, and will continue to provide,\ndata for collisions at the highest energies ever seen in a particle\naccelerator. A strong knowledge of the properties of amplitudes for Quantum\nChromodynamics in the High Energy Limit is therefore important to interpret\nthis data. We study this limit in the context of the High Energy Jets (HEJ)\nformalism. This formalism resums terms in the perturbative expansion of the\ncross-section that behave like $\\alpha_s^n \\log\n\\left(\\frac{s}{-t}\\right)^{n-1}$, which are enhanced in this limit.\nUnderstanding this region is particularly important in certain key analyses at\nthe LHC: for example, Higgs-boson-plus-dijet analyses where cuts are applied to\npick out events with a large $m_{jj}$ and in many searches for new physics.\n", "  The superconducting state in vanadium characterizes with the critical\ntemperature ($T_{c}$) equal to $5.3$~K. The Coulomb pseudopotential, calculated\nwith the help of the Eliashberg equations, possesses anomalously high value\n$\\mu^{\\star}\\left(3\\Omega_{\\rm max}\\right)=0.259$ or\n$\\mu^{\\star}\\left(10\\Omega_{\\rm max}\\right)=0.368$ ($\\Omega_{\\rm max}$ denotes\nthe maximum phonon frequency). Despite the relatively large electron-phonon\ncoupling constant ($\\lambda=0.91$), the quantities such as: the order parameter\n($\\Delta$), the specific heat ($C$), and the thermodynamic critical field\n($H_{c}$) determine the values of the dimensionless ratios not deviating much\nfrom the predictions of the BCS theory: $R_{\\Delta}=2\\Delta\\left(0\\right)/\nk_{B}T_{c}=3.68$, $R_{C}=\\Delta C\\left(T_{c}\\right)/\nC^{N}\\left(T_{c}\\right)=1.69$, and $R_{H}=T_{c}C^{N}\\left(T_{c}\\right)/\nH^{2}_{c}\\left(0\\right)=0.171$. This result is associated with the reduction of\nthe strong-coupling and the retardation effects by the high value of the\nCoulomb pseudopotential. It has been shown that the results of the Eliashberg\nformalism can be relatively precisely reproduced with the help of the\nsemi-analytical formulas, if the value of $\\mu^{\\star}$ is determined on the\nbasis of the $T_{c}$-Allen-Dynes expression ($\\mu^{\\star}_{AD}=0.198$). The\nattention should be paid to the fact that in the numerical and in the\nsemi-analytical approach the comparable values of the thermodynamic parameters\nfor the same $\\mu^{\\star}$ have been obtained only in the vicinity of the point\n$\\mu^{\\star}=0.1$.\n", "  We propose an analogue of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for holographic\nentanglement entropy applicable to non-relativistic holographic dualities\ninvolving Horava gravity. This is a powerful tool for the duality to have, as\ntopological order quantified by entanglement entropy is a robust notion in\ncondensed matter systems. Our derivation makes use of examining on-shell\ngravitational actions on conical spacetimes.\n", "  An electron lens can serve as an effective mechanism for suppressing coherent\ninstabilities in high intensity storage rings through nonlinear amplitude\ndependent betatron tune shift. However, the addition of a strong localized\nnonlinear focusing element to the accelerator lattice may lead to undesired\neffects in particle dynamics. We evaluate the effect of a Gaussian electron\nlens on single particle motion in HL-LHC using numerical tracking simulations,\nand compare the results to the case when an equal tune spread is generated by\nconventional octupole magnets.\n", "  No firm evidence has existed that the ancient Maya civilization recorded\nspecific occurrences of meteor showers or outbursts in the corpus of Maya\nhieroglyphic inscriptions. In fact, there has been no evidence of any\npre-Hispanic civilization in the Western Hemisphere recording any observations\nof any meteor showers on any specific dates.\n  The authors numerically integrated meteoroid-sized particles released by\nComet Halley as early as 1404 BC to identify years within the Maya Classic\nPeriod, AD 250-909, when Eta Aquariid outbursts might have occurred. Outbursts\ndetermined by computer model were then compared to specific events in the Maya\nrecord to see if any correlation existed between the date of the event and the\ndate of the outburst. The model was validated by successfully explaining\nseveral outbursts around the same epoch in the Chinese record. Some outbursts\nobserved by the Maya were due to recent revolutions of Comet Halley, within a\nfew centuries, and some to resonant behavior in older Halley trails, of the\norder of a thousand years. Examples were found of several different Jovian mean\nmotion resonances as well as the 1:3 Saturnian resonance that have controlled\nthe dynamical evolution of meteoroids in apparently observed outbursts.\n", "  Plasmas with varying collisionalities occur in many applications, such as\ntokamak edge regions, where the flows are characterized by significant\nvariations in density and temperature. While a kinetic model is necessary for\nweakly-collisional high-temperature plasmas, high collisionality in colder\nregions render the equations numerically stiff due to disparate time scales. In\nthis paper, we propose an implicit-explicit algorithm for such cases, where the\ncollisional term is integrated implicitly in time, while the advective term is\nintegrated explicitly in time, thus allowing time step sizes that are\ncomparable to the advective time scales. This partitioning results in a more\nefficient algorithm than those using explicit time integrators, where the time\nstep sizes are constrained by the stiff collisional time scales. We implement\nsemi-implicit additive Runge-Kutta methods in COGENT, a finite-volume\ngyrokinetic code for mapped, multiblock grids and test the accuracy,\nconvergence, and computational cost of these semi-implicit methods for test\ncases with highly-collisional plasmas.\n", "  Investigating the non-linear transport regime in a quantum dot heat engine\ndescribed by the Anderson-Holstein model, it is shown that a finite\nelectron-phonon interaction leads to a charge induced phonon generation that\nstimulates a phonon current even in the absence of a thermal gradient. This\ngives rise to the non-linear phonon Peltier effect which shows a non-trivial\ndependence on varying the electron-phonon interaction. Utilizing the reversal\nof phonon currents via charge induced phonon accumulation, we demonstrate that\nthe heat engine surprisingly can be cooled when coupled to a hot reservoir. In\nfurther exploring possibilities that can arise from this effect, we propose a\ncharge-induced phonon switching mechanism.\n", "  Here we investigate the H$\\beta$ and Mg II spectral line parameters used for\nthe black hole mass (M$_{\\rm BH}$) estimation for a sample of Type 1 Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) spectra selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\ndatabase. We have analyzed and compared the virialization of the H$\\beta$ and\nMg II emission lines, and found that the H$\\beta$ line is more confident virial\nestimator than Mg II. We have investigated the influence of the Balmer\ncontinuum emission to the M$_{\\rm BH}$ estimation from the UV parameters, and\nfound that the Balmer continuum emission can contribute to the overestimation\nof the M$_{\\rm BH}$ on average for ~ 5% (up to 10%).\n", "  The symptoms of many infectious diseases influence their host to withdraw\nfrom social activity limiting their own potential to spread. Successful\ntransmission therefore requires the onset of infectiousness to coincide with a\ntime when its host is socially active. Since social activity and infectiousness\nare both temporal phenomena, we hypothesize that diseases are most pervasive\nwhen these two processes are synchronized. We consider disease dynamics that\nincorporate a behavioral response that effectively shortens the infectious\nperiod of the disease. We apply this model to data collected from face-to-face\nsocial interactions and look specifically at how the duration of the latent\nperiod effects the reachability of the disease. We then simulate the spread of\nthe model disease on the network to test the robustness of our results.\nDiseases with latent periods that synchronize with the temporal social behavior\nof people, i.e. latent periods of 24 hours or 7 days, correspond to peaks in\nthe number of individuals who are potentially at risk of becoming infected. The\neffect of this synchronization is present for a range of disease models with\nrealistic parameters. The relationship between the latent period of an\ninfectious disease and its pervasiveness is non-linear and depends strongly on\nthe social context in which the disease is spreading.\n", "  High frequency fluctuation in the optical signal generated in Fourier-Domain\nMode Locked fiber laser (FDML-FL), which is the major problem and degrades the\nlaser performance, is not yet fully analyzed or studied. The basic theory which\nis causing this high frequency fluctuation is required to clearly understand\nits dynamics and to control it for various applications. In this letter, by\nanalyzing the signal and system dynamics of FDML-FL, we theoretically\ndemonstrate that the high frequency fluctuation is induced by the intrinsic\ninstability of frequency offset of the signal in cavity with nonlinear gain and\nspectral filter. Unlike the instabilities observed in other laser cavities this\ninstability is very unique to FDML-FL as the central frequency of the optical\nsignal continuously shifts away from the center frequency of the filter due to\nthe effects like dispersion and/or nonlinearity. This instability is none other\nthan the Eckhaus instability reported and well studied in fluid dynamics\ngoverned by real Ginzburg-Landau equation.\n", "  Using Time Independent Density Functional Theory (TIDFT) it is shown that the\n2nd order optical susceptibilities of narrow (1nm-2nm) Silicon Nanowires (SiNW)\nare enhanced due to surface termination. The value of $\\chi^{(2)}$ is enhanced\nup to 200 pm/V which is promising a strong Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) in\nSiNWs. For [100], [110] and [111] SiNWs, yxx component of $\\chi^{(2)}$ tensor\nis 81, 225 and 81 pm/V, respectively. These are in close agreement with\n$\\chi^{(2)}$ values reported for strained silicon waveguides in experiments.\nThe 3rd order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(3)}$, is within the range of\n(0.1-12)x$10^{-18} \\frac{m^{2}}{V^{2}}$ which is close to the experimental\nvalues of bulk silicon (0.1-0.2)x$10^{-18} \\frac{m^{2}}{V^{2}}$ for [110] and\n[100] SiNWs and it is 100 times better for [111] SiNW. This study suggests\npossibilities of enhancing SHG in SiNWs through symmetry breaking via strain\nand surface termination/reconstruction as well as suitability of this DFT-based\nmethod in predicting nonlinear optical susceptibilities of nano structures.\n", "  Nanostructures with open shell transition metal or molecular constituents\nhost often strong electronic correlations and are highly sensitive to atomistic\nmaterial details. This tutorial review discusses method developments and\napplications of theoretical approaches for the realistic description of the\nelectronic and magnetic properties of nanostructures with correlated electrons.\nFirst, the implementation of a flexible interface between density functional\ntheory and a variant of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) highly suitable for\nthe simulation of complex correlated structures is explained and illustrated.\nOn the DMFT side, this interface is largely based on recent developments of\nquantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization techniques allowing for efficient\ndescriptions of general four fermion Coulomb interactions, reduced symmetries\nand spin-orbit coupling, which are explained here. With the examples of the Cr\n(001) surfaces, magnetic adatoms, and molecular systems it is shown how the\ninterplay of Hubbard U and Hund's J determines charge and spin fluctuations and\nhow these interactions drive different sorts of correlation effects in\nnanosystems. Non-local interactions and correlations present a particular\nchallenge for the theory of low dimensional systems. We present our method\ndevelopments addressing these two challenges, i.e., advancements of the\ndynamical vertex approximation and a combination of the constrained random\nphase approximation with continuum medium theories. We demonstrate how\nnon-local interaction and correlation phenomena are controlled not only by\ndimensionality but also by coupling to the environment which is typically\nimportant for determining the physics of nanosystems.\n", "  This paper analyses in detail the dynamics in a neighbourhood of a\nG\\'enot-Brogliato point, colloquially termed the G-spot, which physically\nrepresents so-called dynamic jam in rigid body mechanics with unilateral\ncontact and Coulomb friction. Such singular points arise in planar rigid body\nproblems with slipping point contacts at the intersection between the\nconditions for onset of lift-off and for the Painlev\\'e paradox. The G-spot can\nbe approached in finite time by an open set of initial conditions in a general\nclass of problems. The key question addressed is what happens next. In\nprinciple trajectories could, at least instantaneously, lift off, continue in\nslip, or undergo a so-called impact without collision. Such impacts are\nnon-local in momentum space and depend on properties evaluated away from the\nG-spot. The results are illustrated on a particular physical example, namely\nthe a frictional impact oscillator first studied by Leine et al.\n  The answer is obtained via an analysis that involves a consistent contact\nregularisation with a stiffness proportional to $1/\\varepsilon^2$. Taking a\nsingular limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, one finds an inner and an outer\nasymptotic zone in the neighbourhood of the G-spot. Two distinct cases are\nfound according to whether the contact force becomes infinite or remains finite\nas the G-spot is approached. In the former case it is argued that there can be\nno such canards and so an impact without collision must occur. In the latter\ncase, the canard trajectory acts as a dividing surface between trajectories\nthat momentarily lift off and those that do not before taking the impact. The\norientation of the initial condition set leading to each eventuality is shown\nto change each time a certain positive parameter $\\beta$ passes through an\ninteger.\n", "  In the context of this thesis, the question that is going to occupy us, is\nthe existence of a 5-dimensional braneworld black hole solution that is\nlocalized close to the 3-brane and has the properties of a regular\n4-dimensional one. For this purpose, the 4-dimensional part of the complete\n5-dimensional spacetime is considered to be a generalized Vaidya metric, in the\ncontext of which, the mass parameter $m$ is allowed to vary with respect to\ntime, while it is also allowed to have both $y$ and $r$ dependence. The\ndependence on the $r$-coordinate essentially means that our black hole solution\ncan deviate from the conventional Schwarzschild solution. Additionally, the\ndependence on the $y$-coordinate leads to a non-trivial profile of the black\nhole along the extra dimension. In order to justify physically the existence of\nsuch general mass parameter, we consider the case of two scalar fields\n$\\phi(v,r,y)$, $\\chi(v,r,y)$ which interact with each other and they are also\nnon-minimally coupled to gravity via a general coupling function\n$f(\\phi,\\chi)$. In all the cases that were investigated in the context of this\nparticular scenario, the result for the existence of a viable 5-dimensional\nlocalized black hole solution was negative, a result that causes concern about\nthe compatibility of brane-world models with basic predictions of General\nTheory of Relativity.\n", "  Dilute ultracold quantum gases form an ideal and highly tunable system in\nwhich superuidity can be studied. Recently quantum turbulence in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates was reported [PRL 103, 045310 (2009)], opening up a new\nexperimental system that can be used to study quantum turbulence. A novel\nfeature of this system is that vortex cores now have a finite size. This means\nthat the vortices are no longer one dimensional features in the condensate, but\nthat the radial behaviour and excitations might also play an important role in\nthe study of quantum turbulence in Bose-Einstein condensates. In this paper we\ninvestigate these radial modes using a simplified variational model for the\nvortex core. This study results in the frequencies of the radial modes, which\ncan be compared with the frequencies of the thoroughly studied Kelvin modes.\nFrom this comparison we find that the lowest (l=0) radial mode has a frequency\nin the same order of magnitude as the Kelvin modes. However the radial modes\nstill have a larger energy than the Kelvin modes, meaning that the Kelvin modes\nwill still constitute the preferred channel for energy decay in quantum\nturbulence.\n", "  Interactions between the constituents of a condensed matter system can drive\nit through a plethora of different phases due to many-body effects. A prominent\nplatform for this type of behavior is a two-dimensional electron system in a\nmagnetic field, which evolves intricately through various gaseous, liquid and\nsolids phases governed by Coulomb interaction. Here we report on the\nexperimental observation of a phase transition between the Laughlin liquid of\ncomposite fermions and the adjacent insulating phase of a magnetic\nfield-induced Wigner solid. The experiments are performed in the lowest Landau\nlevel of a MgZnO/ZnO two-dimensional electron system with attributes of both a\nliquid and a solid. An in-plane magnetic field component applied on top of the\nperpendicular magnetic field extends the Wigner phase further into the liquid\nphase region. Our observations indicate the direct competition between a Wigner\nsolid and a Laughlin liquid both formed by composite particles rather than bare\nelectrons.\n", "  The superfluid pairing gap of neutron matter is calculated in the framework\nof Quark Compound Bag model with nucleon-nucleon interactions generated by the\ns-channel exchange of Jaffe-Low primitives (6-quark states).\n", "  In presence of the non-ideal plasma effects, Heavy Quarks (HQs) carry out non\nlinear random walk inside Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and in the small momentum\ntransfer limit, the evolution of the HQ distribution is dictated by the Non\nLinear Fokker-Planck Equation (NLFPE). Using the NLFPE, we calculate the\ntransport coefficients (drag and diffusion) of heavy quarks travelling through\nQGP. We observe substantial modification in the momentum and temperature\nvariation of the transport coefficients; and this will modify the physical\npicture we are having about the transport of heavy quarks inside QGP, and\nhence, about the characterisation of the plasma.\n", "  This work continues the study of the earlier constructed mathematical model\nof the metabolic process running in a cell.\n  We will consider auto-oscillations arising on the level of enzyme-substrate\ninteractions in the nutrient and respiratory chains, which leads to the\nself-organization in autocatalysis of the integral metabolic process in cells.\nThe auto-oscillations organize themselves in the total metabolic process of\ncells at autocatalysis.\n  The behavior of the phase-parametric characteristic under the high\ndissipation of a kinetic membrane potentialis analyzed. All possible\noscillatory modes of the system and the scenario of formation and destruction\nof regular and strange attractors are studied. The bifurcations of the\ntransitions \"order-chaos\", \"chaos-order\", \"chaos-chaos\" and \"order-order\" are\ncalculated. The total spectra of Lyapunov indices and the divergences for all\ntypes of attractors on a part of the phase-parametric characteristic under\nconsideration are determined. For various types of strange attractors, their\nLyapunov dimensions, KS-entropies, and \"predictability horizons\" are\ncalculated. Some conclusions about the structure of the chaos of strange\nattractors and its influence on the stability of the metabolic process in a\ncell are drawn.\n", "  A predictive model for nanoparticle nucleation has not yet been successfully\nachieved. Classical nucleation theory fails because the atomistic nature of the\nseed has to be considered since geometrical structure as well as stoichiometry\ndo not always match the bulk values. We present a fully microscopic approach\nbased on a first-principle study of aluminium oxide clusters. We have\ncalculated stable structures of AlxOy} and their associated thermodynamic\nproperties. From these data, the chemical composition of a gas composed of\naluminium and oxygen atoms can be calculated as a function of temperature,\npressure, and aluminium to oxygen ratio. We demonstrate the accuracy of this\napproach in reproducing experimental results obtained with time resolved\nspectroscopy of a laser induced plasma from an Al2O3} target. We thus extended\nthe calculation to lower temperatures, i.e. longer time scales, to propose a\nscenario of composition gas evolution leading to the first alumina seeds.\n", "  The Penrose-Fife Phase Field Model is now a well-established model in the\ntheory of phase transitions. In the course of study of this model both the\nrigorous mathematical results and approximate solutions were obtained. However,\nto the best of our knowledge, no exact solutions were given in the literature.\nIn the present paper we give exact traveling wave solutions for this system.\nWhile the functional form of the solutions is rather simple, the dependence of\nsolutions on the parameters of the model is quite complicated.\n", "  In this article we have presented FRW cosmological model in the framework of\nBrans-Dicke theory. This paper deals with a new proposed form of deceleration\nparameter and cosmological constant. The effect of bulk viscosity is also\nstudied in the presence of modified Chaplygin gas equation of state. Further,\nwe have discussed the physical behaviors of the models.\n", "  We extend the work of Mishchenko et al. (2000) regarding the exact results of\nthe polarization effect, using the theory of Amic et al. (1997) to derive a\nmodel prediction for the polarization coherent opposition effect at small\nangles. Our extension is to assess the effect of circular polarized light, thus\ncompleting exact derivation of the full M\\\"uller matrix for the semi infinite\nslab of Rayleigh sized particles. We find the circular polarization peak is\nnarrower than the coherent backscattering intensity peak, and weaker in\nintensity.\n", "  We study the inverse problem of localization (imaging) of a laser beam from\nmeasurements of the intensity of light scattered off-axis by a Poisson cloud of\nsmall particles. Starting from the wave equation, we analyze the microscopic\ncoherence of the scattered intensity and show that it is possible to determine\nthe laser beam from the speckle pattern captured by a group of CCD cameras. Two\ngroups of cameras are sufficient when the particles are either small or large\nwith respect to the wavelength. For general particle sizes the accuracy of the\nlaser localization with two groups of cameras is subject to knowing the\nscattering properties of the cloud. However, three or more groups of cameras\nallow accurate localization that is robust to uncertainty of the type, size,\nshape and concentration of the particles in the cloud. We introduce a novel\nlaser beam localization algorithm and give some numerical illustrations in a\nregime relevant to the application of imaging high energy lasers in a maritime\natmosphere.\n", "  Quantum cellular automata and quantum walks provide a framework for the\nfoundations of quantum field theory, since the equations of motion of free\nrelativistic quantum fields can be derived as the small wave-vector limit of\nquantum automata and walks starting from very general principles. The intrinsic\ndiscreteness of this framework is reconciled with the continuous Lorentz\nsymmetry by reformulating the notion of inertial reference frame in terms of\nthe constants of motion of the quantum walk dynamics. In particular, among the\nsymmetries of the quantum walk which recovers the Weyl equation--the so called\nWeyl walk--one finds a non linear realisation of the Poincar\\'e group, which\nrecovers the usual linear representation in the small wave-vector limit. In\nthis paper we characterise the full symmetry group of the Weyl walk which is\nshown to be a non linear realization of a group which is the semidirect product\nof the Poincar\\'e group and the group of dilations.\n", "  Theoretically, NaAuS is predicted as topological insulator, while no detail\nelectronic structure study has been done for this compound. Here, we report the\nstructural and electronic properties of NaAuS by using LDA, PBEsol, PBE and\nrevPBE exchange correlation functionals. The calculated values of equilibrium\nlattice constant for LDA, PBEsol, PBE and revPBE exchange correlation\nfunctionals are found to be $\\sim$6.128 {\\AA}, $\\sim$6.219 {\\AA}, $\\sim$6.353\n{\\AA} and $\\sim$6.442 {\\AA}, respectively. The bulk modulus predicted by LDA,\nPBEsol, PBE and revPBE exchange correlation functionals is $\\sim$66.6,\n$\\sim$56.4, $\\sim$46.5 and $\\sim$39.3 GPa, respectively. Hence, the order of\ncalculated values of bulk modulus is consistent with the order of calculated\nvalues of equilibrium lattice parameters for these exchange correlation\nfunctionals. The spread of total density of states below the Fermi level\ndecreases as the exchange correlation functional changes from LDA to PBEsol to\nPBE to revPBE, which is also found to be consistent with the order of bulk\nmodulus for these exchange correlation functionals. In presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling, a direct band gap is observed in NaAuS compound, which is found to be\n$\\sim$0.26, $\\sim$0.25, $\\sim$0.24 and $\\sim$0.23 eV for LDA, PBEsol, PBE and\nrevPBE exchange correlation functionals, respectively. Here, NaAuS is found to\nbe topological insulator as it shows band inversion at $\\Gamma$ point. The\ncalculated values of band inversion strength for LDA (PBEsol) and PBE (revPBE)\nexchange correlation functionals are $\\sim$1.58 eV ($\\sim$1.57 eV) and\n$\\sim$1.50 eV ($\\sim$1.47 eV), respectively.\n", "  We present a Newton-like method to solve inverse problems and to quantify\nparameter uncertainties. We apply the method to parameter reconstruction in\noptical scatterometry, where we take into account a priori information and\nmeasurement uncertainties using a Bayesian approach. Further, we discuss the\ninfluence of numerical accuracy on the reconstruction result.\n", "  We present a novel interpretation of the gamma-ray diffuse emission measured\nby H.E.S.S. in the Galactic Center (GC) region and the Galactic ridge. Our\nstarting base is an updated analysis of PASS8 Fermi-LAT data, which allows to\nextend down to few GeV the spectra measured by H.E.S.S. and to infer the\nprimary CR radial distribution above 100 GeV. We compare those results with a\nCR transport model assuming a harder scaling of the diffusion coefficient with\nrigidity in the inner Galaxy. Such a behavior reproduces the radial dependence\nof the CR spectral index recently inferred from Fermi-LAT measurements in the\ninner GP. We find that, in this scenario, the bulk of the Galactic ridge\nemission can be naturally explained by the interaction of the diffuse,\nsteady-state Galactic CR sea interacting with the gas present in the Central\nmolecular zone. The evidence of a GC PeVatron is significantly weaker than that\ninferred adopting a conventional (softer) CR sea.\n", "  Baseline azimuth calculation using GPS carrier phase data can be achieved in\na classic way by using two or more geodetic synchronized GPS receivers. Such\nsystem includes dedicated expensive components and thus is not applicable to\nmany uses. The development of low cost GPS receivers have come to a point where\ngood quality carrier phase measurements are available and double differencing\nsystems utilizing these receivers have proven feasible. Inexpensive receivers\nlike this, combined with attitude determination algorithm, can make accurate\nattitude determination using GPS accessible to everyone.\n  Our project consisted of developing a low cost attitude determination system\nutilizing 2 Fastrax off-the-shelf receivers. Phase and code data from the\nreceivers is processed, filtered and used for attitude determination using\ndouble-difference algorithm. Possible applications for such systems are for\nexample: * Civilian - search and rescue equipment * Industrial - low cost\ngeodetic measurement * Military - inexpensive weapon guidance system\n", "  Numerical simulation of complex optical structures enables their optimization\nwith respect to specific objectives. Often, optimization is done by multiple\nsuccessive parameter scans, which are time consuming and computationally\nexpensive. We employ here Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes in\norder to automatize and speed up the optimization process. As a toy example, we\ndemonstrate optimization of the shape of a free-form reflective meta surface\nsuch that it diffracts light into a specific diffraction order. For this\nexample, we compare the performance of six different Bayesian optimization\napproaches with various acquisition functions and various kernels of the\nGaussian process.\n", "  The ubiquitous ether coming from the ancient times up to middle of the twenty\ncentury is replaced by a superfluid quantum space. It represents by itself a\nBose-Einstein condensate consisting of enormous amount of virtual\nparticle-antiparticle pairs emerging and disappearing in an infinitely ongoing\ndance. Flowing of this medium in the non-relativistic limit is described by the\nmodified Navier-Stokes equation along with the continuity equation. The first\nequation admits the splitting on to two coupled equations. They are the quantum\nHamilton-Jacobi equation and the equation for vorticity. The quantum\nHamilton-Jacoby equation paired with the continuity equation can be reduced to\nthe \\Schrodinger equation. These two equations representing the kernel of the\nBohmian mechanics give finding bundle of the Bohmian trajectories. Whereas the\nvorticity equation gives solutions for vortices moving along such trajectories.\nAs the result we come to the de Broglie's interpretation of quantum mechanics\naccording to which there is a pilot-wave guiding the particle (in our case it\nis a vortex clot) from a source up to its detection along an optimal path that\nis the Bohmian trajectory.\n", "  We study the one-dimensional transverse-field spin-1/2 Ising ferromagnet at\nits critical point. We consider an $L$-sized subsystem of a $N$-sized ring, and\ntrace over the states of $(N-L)$ spins, with $N\\to\\infty$. The full $N$-system\nis in a pure state, but the $L$-system is in a statistical mixture. As well\nknown, for $L >>1$, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-von Neumann entropy violates\nthermodynamical extensivity, namely $S_{BG}(L) \\propto \\log L$, whereas the\nnonadditive entropy $S_q$ is extensive for $q=q_c=\\sqrt{37}-6 $, namely\n$S_{q_c}(L) \\propto L$. When this problem is expressed in terms of independent\nfermions, we show that the usual thermostatistical sums emerging within\nFermi-Dirac statistics can, for $L>>1$, be indistinctively taken up to $L$\nterms or up to $\\log L$ terms. This is interpreted as a compact occupancy of\nphase-space of the $L$-system, hence standard BG quantities with an effective\nlength $V \\equiv \\log L$ are appropriate and are explicitly calculated. In\nother words, the calculations are to be done in a phase-space whose effective\ndimension is $2^{\\log L}$ instead of $2^L$. The whole scenario is strongly\nreminiscent of a usual phase transition of a spin-1/2 $d$-dimensional system,\nwhere the phase-space dimension is $2^{L^d}$ in the disordered phase, and\neffectively $2^{L^d/2}$ in the ordered one.\n", "  This work presents a new method to quantify connectivity in transportation\nnetworks. Inspired by the field of topological data analysis, we propose a\nnovel approach to explore the robustness of road network connectivity in the\npresence of congestion on the roadway. The robustness of the pattern is\nsummarized in a congestion barcode, which can be constructed directly from\ntraffic datasets commonly used for navigation. As an initial demonstration, we\nillustrate the main technique on a publicly available traffic dataset in a\nneighborhood in New York City.\n"]}
