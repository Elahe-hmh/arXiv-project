(We do not make claims on the lower bounds for the stationary\ndensity anymore.) In 2017, Wael Bahsoun, Christopher Bose, and Marks Ruziboev\npointed out to us that the proof of Corollary 5.2 in the same paper is flawed.\nWe explain how to recover Corollary 5.2 up to replacing the set $M'_q$ on p. 93\nby a slightly smaller set (this does not affect the rest of the paper).\n", "  Tunneling two-level systems are ubiquitous in amorphous solids, and form a\nmajor source of noise in systems such as nano-mechanical oscillators, single\nelectron transistors, and superconducting qubits. Occurance of defect tunneling\ndespite their coupling to phonons is viewed as a hallmark of weak defect-phonon\ncoupling. This is since strong coupling to phonons results in significant\nphonon dressing and suppresses tunneling in two-level tunneling defects\neffectively. Here we determine the dynamics of a crystalline tunnelling defect\nstrongly coupled to phonons incorporating the full 3D geometry in our\ndescription. We find that inversion symmetric tunnelling is not dressed by\nphonons whereas other tunnelling pathways are dressed by phonons and, thus, are\nsuppressed by strong defect-phonon coupling. We provide the linear acoustic and\ndielectric response functions for a crystalline tunnelling defect for strong\ndefect-phonon coupling. This allows direct experimental determination of the\ndefect-phonon coupling. The singling out of inversion-symmetric tunneling\nstates in single tunneling defects is complementary to their dominance of the\nlow energy excitations in strongly disordered solids as a result of\ninter-defect interactions for large defect concentrations. This suggests that\ninversion symmetric two-level systems play a unique role in the low energy\nproperties of disordered solids.\n", "  We show that Oeckl's boundary formalism incorporates quantum statistical\nmechanics naturally, and we formulate general-covariant quantum statistical\nmechanics in this language. We illustrate the formalism by showing how it\naccounts for the Unruh effect. We observe that the distinction between pure and\nmixed states weakens in the general covariant context, and surmise that local\ngravitational processes are indivisibly statistical with no possible quantal\nversus probabilistic distinction.\n", "  We demonstrate the feasibility of levitating a small mirror using only\nradiation pressure. In our scheme, the mirror is supported by a tripod where\neach leg of the tripod is a Fabry-Perot cavity. The macroscopic state of the\nmirror is coherently coupled to the supporting cavity modes allowing coherent\ninterrogation and manipulation of the mirror motion. The proposed scheme is an\nextreme example of the optical spring, where a mechanical oscillator is\nisolated from the environment and its mechanical frequency and macroscopic\nstate can be manipulated solely through optical fields. We model the stability\nof the system and find a three-dimensional lattice of trapping points where\ncavity resonances allow for build up of optical field sufficient to support the\nweight of the mirror. Our scheme offers a unique platform for studying quantum\nand classical optomechanics and can potentially be used for precision\ngravitational field sensing and quantum state generation.\n", "  The spectral model of Perry, Henbest & Chong (1986) predicts that the\nintegral length-scale varies very slowly with distance to the wall in the\nintermediate layer. The only way for the integral length scale's variation to\nbe more realistic while keeping with the Townsend-Perry attached eddy spectrum\nis to add a new wavenumber range to the model at wavenumbers smaller than that\nspectrum. This necessary addition can also account for the high Reynolds number\nouter peak of the turbulent kinetic energy in the intermediate layer. An\nanalytic expression is obtained for this outer peak in agreement with extremely\nhigh Reynolds number data by Hultmark, Vallikivi, Bailey & Smits (2012, 2013).\nThe finding of Dallas, Vassilicos & Hewitt (2009) that it is the eddy turnover\ntime and not the mean flow gradient which scales with distance to the wall and\nskin friction velocity in the intermediate layer implies, when combined with\nTownsend's (1976) production-dissipation balance, that the mean flow gradient\nhas an outer peak at the same location as the turbulent kinetic energy. This is\nseen in the data of Hultmark, Vallikivi, Bailey & Smits (2012, 2013). The same\napproach also predicts that the mean flow gradient has a logarithmic decay at\ndistances to the wall larger than the position of the outer peak, a qualitative\nprediction which the aforementioned data also support.\n", "  We introduce new integrable exclusion and zero-range processes on the\none-dimensional lattice that generalize the $q$-Hahn TASEP and the $q$-Hahn\nBoson (zero-range) process introduced in [Pov13] and further studied in\n[Cor14], by allowing jumps in both directions. Owing to a Markov duality, we\nprove moment formulas for the locations of particles in the exclusion process.\nThis leads to a Fredholm determinant formula that characterizes the\ndistribution of the location of any particle. We show that the model-dependent\nconstants that arise in the limit theorems predicted by the KPZ scaling theory\nare recovered by a steepest descent analysis of the Fredholm determinant. For\nsome choice of the parameters, our model specializes to the\nmulti-particle-asymmetric diffusion model introduced in [SW98]. In that case,\nwe make a precise asymptotic analysis that confirms KPZ universality\npredictions. Surprisingly, we also prove that in the partially asymmetric case,\nthe location of the first particle also enjoys cube-root fluctuations which\nfollow Tracy-Widom GUE statistics.\n", "  We introduce an exactly-solvable model of random walk in random environment\nthat we call the Beta RWRE. This is a random walk in $\\mathbb{Z}$ which\nperforms nearest neighbour jumps with transition probabilities drawn according\nto the Beta distribution. We also describe a related directed polymer model,\nwhich is a limit of the $q$-Hahn interacting particle system. Using a Fredholm\ndeterminant representation for the quenched probability distribution function\nof the walker's position, we are able to prove second order cube-root scale\ncorrections to the large deviation principle satisfied by the walker's\nposition, with convergence to the Tracy-Widom distribution. We also show that\nthis limit theorem can be interpreted in terms of the maximum of strongly\ncorrelated random variables: the positions of independent walkers in the same\nenvironment. The zero-temperature counterpart of the Beta RWRE can be studied\nin a parallel way. We also prove a Tracy-Widom limit theorem for this model.\n", "  The study of turbulent flows calls for measurements with high resolution both\nin space and in time. We propose a new approach to reconstruct\nHigh-Temporal-High-Spatial resolution velocity fields by combining two sources\nof information that are well-resolved either in space or in time, the\nLow-Temporal-High-Spatial (LTHS) and the High-Temporal-Low-Spatial (HTLS)\nresolution measurements. In the framework of co-conception between sensing and\ndata post-processing, this work extensively investigates a Bayesian\nreconstruction approach using a simulated database. A Bayesian fusion model is\ndeveloped to solve the inverse problem of data reconstruction. The model uses a\nMaximum A Posteriori estimate, which yields the most probable field knowing the\nmeasurements. The DNS of a wall-bounded turbulent flow at moderate Reynolds\nnumber is used to validate and assess the performances of the present approach.\nLow resolution measurements are subsampled in time and space from the fully\nresolved data. Reconstructed velocities are compared to the reference DNS to\nestimate the reconstruction errors. The model is compared to other conventional\nmethods such as Linear Stochastic Estimation and cubic spline interpolation.\nResults show the superior accuracy of the proposed method in all\nconfigurations. Further investigations of model performances on various range\nof scales demonstrate its robustness. Numerical experiments also permit to\nestimate the expected maximum information level corresponding to limitations of\nexperimental instruments.\n", "  We study the electromagnetic response and surface electromagnetic modes in a\ngeneric gapped Dirac material under pumping with circularly polarized light.\nThe valley imbalance due to pumping leads to a net Berry curvature, giving rise\nto a finite transverse conductivity. We discuss the appearance of nonreciprocal\nchiral edge modes, their hybridization and waveguiding in a nanoribbon\ngeometry, and giant polarization rotation in nanoribbon arrays.\n", "  The masses of cryptoexotic pentaquarks with hidden beauty are estimated\nphenomenologically using the results by the LHCb collaboration which discovered\nrecently the cryptoexotic pentaquarks with hidden charm. The expected masses of\nthe hidden beauty pentaquarks are about $10.8$ GeV and $10.7$ GeV in the limit\nof some kind of heavy quark symmetry. The states with hidden strangeness\nconsidered in similar way have masses about $2.37$ Gev and $2.30$ GeV, by\nseveral hundreds of MeV higher than states discussed previously in connection\nwith the relatively light positive strangeness pentaquark $\\theta^+$. Empirical\ndata on spectra of pentaquarks can be used to get information about quarkonia\ninteraction with nucleons. The results obtained for the case of heavy flavors\nare in fair agreement with model of isospin (pion) exchange between flavored\nbaryons and anti-flavored vector mesons, proposed by Karliner and Rosner, and\nin qualitative agreement with the bound state version of the chiral soliton\nmodel.\n", "  We explore the mechanism for the long-lived quantum coherence by considering\nthe discrete phonon modes: these vibrational modes effectively weaken the\nexciton-environment interaction, due to the new composite (polaron) formed by\nexcitons and vibrons. This subsequently demonstrates the role of vibrational\ncoherence which greatly contributes to long-lived feature of the excitonic\ncoherence that has been observed in femtosecond experiments. The estimation of\nthe timescale of coherence elongated by vibrational modes is given in an\nanalytical manner. To test the validity of our theory, we study the\npigment-protein complex in detail by exploring the energy transfer and\ncoherence dynamics. The ground-state vibrational coherence generated by\nincoherent radiations is shown to be long-survived and is demonstrated to be\nsignificant in promoting the excitation energy transfer. This is attributed to\nthe nonequilibriumness of the system caused by the detailed-balance-breaking,\nwhich funnels the downhill migration of excitons.\n", "  We examine the use of optomechanically-generated squeezing to obtain a\nsensitivity enhancement for interferometers in the gravitational-wave band. The\nintrinsic dispersion characteristics of optomechanical squeezing around the\nmechanical frequency are able to produce squeezing at different quadratures\nover the spectrum, a feature required by gravitational-wave interferometers to\nbeat the standard quantum limit over an extended frequency range. Under\nrealistic assumptions we show that the amount of available squeezing and the\nintrinsic quadrature rotation may provide, compared to similar amounts of\nfixed-quadrature squeezing, a detection advantage. A significant challenge for\nthis scheme, however, is the amount of excess noise that is generated in the\nunsqueezed quadrature at frequencies near the mechanical resonance.\n", "  We consider four-dimensional vacuum spacetimes which admit a nonvanishing\nspacelike Killing field. The quotient with respect to the Killing action is a\nthree-dimensional quotient spacetime $(M,g)$. We establish several results\nregarding maximal hypersurfaces (spacelike hypersurfaces of zero mean\ncurvature) in such quotient spacetimes. First, we show that a complete\nnoncompact maximal hypersurface must either be a cylinder $S^1 \\times\n\\mathbb{R}$ with flat metric or else conformal to the Euclidean plane\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. Second, we establish positivity of mass for certain maximal\nhypersurfaces, referring to a analogue of ADM mass adapted for the quotient\nsetting. Finally, while lapse functions corresponding to the maximal\nhypersurface gauge are necessarily bounded in the four-dimensional\nasymptotically Euclidean setting, we show that nontrivial quotient spacetimes\nadmit the maximal hypersurface gauge only with unbounded lapse.\n", "  In the past decades, many efforts have been devoted to the temporal\nmanipulation of waves, especially focusing on slowing down their propagation.\nIn electromagnetism, from microwave to optics, as well as in acoustics or for\nelastic waves, slow wave propagation indeed largely benefits both applied and\nfundamental physics. It is for instance essential in analog signal computing\nthrough the design of components such as delay lines and buffers, and it is one\nof the prerequisite for increased wave/matter interactions. Despite the\ninterest of a broad community, researches have mostly been conducted in optics\nalong with the development of wavelength scaled structured composite media,\nthat appear promising candidates for compact slow light components. Yet their\nminimum structural scale prevents them from being transposed to lower\nfrequencies where wavelengths range from sub-millimeter to meters. In this\narticle, we propose to overcome this limitation thanks to the deep\nsub-wavelength scale of locally resonant metamaterials. In our approach,\nimplemented here in the microwave regime, we show that introducing coupled\nresonant defects in such composite media allows the creation of deep\nsub-wavelength waveguides. We experimentally demonstrate that waves, while\npropagating in such waveguides, exhibit largely reduced group velocities. We\nqualitatively explain the mechanism underlying this slow wave propagation and\nfirst experimentally demonstrate, then numerically verify, how it can be taken\nadvantage of to tune the velocity, achieving group indices ng as high as 227\nover relatively large bandwidths. We conclude by highlighting the three\nbeneficial consequences of our line defect slow wave waveguides in locally\nresonant metamaterials: the deep sub-wavelength scale, the very large group\nindices and the fact that slow wave propagation does not occur at the expense\nof drastic bandwidth reductions.\n", "  We examine some agreement-dynamics models that are placed on directed random\ngraphs. In such systems a fraction of sites $\\exp(-z)$, where $z$ is the\naverage degree, becomes permanently fixed or flickering. In the Voter model,\nwhich has no surface tension, such zealots or flickers freely spread their\nopinions and that makes the system disordered. For models with a surface\ntension, like the Ising model or the Naming Game model, their role is limited\nand such systems are ordered at large~$z$. However, when $z$ decreases, the\ndensity of zealots or flickers increases, and below a certain threshold ($z\\sim\n1.9-2.0$) the system becomes disordered. On undirected random graphs agreement\ndynamics is much different and ordering appears as soon the graph is above the\npercolation threshold at $z=1$.\n", "  We report observations of the Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) of Nitrogen\nVacancy (NV) centers in diamonds that are levitating in an ion trap. Using a\nneedle Paul trap operating under ambient conditions, we demonstrate efficient\nmicrowave driving of the electronic spin and show that the spin properties of\ndeposited diamond particles measured by the ESR are retained in the Paul trap.\nWe also exploit the ESR signal to monitor the rotation of levitating\nmonocrystals, a first step towards spin-controlled mechanical systems in\nscattering-free traps.\n", "  We propose a method to tailor the potential experienced by a moveable end\nmirror in a cavity optomechanical system by specifying the spectral properties\nof the input field. We show that by engineering the power spectral density of\nthe cavity input field a desired force function can be approximated, with the\naccuracy of the approximation limited only by the linewidth of the cavity. The\nvery general technique presented here could have applications in many kinds of\noptomechanical systems, particularly those used for sensing and metrology. We\ndemonstrate the method by applying it to improve the sensitivity of a\nparticular gravity measurement.\n", "  We report semiconductor to metal-like crossover in temperature dependence of\nresistivity ($\\rho$) due to the switching of charge transport from bulk to\nsurface channel in three-dimensional topological insulator\nBi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.7}$Se$_{1.3}$. Unlike earlier studies, a much\nsharper drop in $\\rho$($T$) is observed below the crossover temperature due to\nthe dominant surface conduction. Remarkably, the resistivity of the conducting\nsurface channel follows a rarely observable $T^2$ dependence at low temperature\nas predicted theoretically for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid system. The field\ndependence of magnetization shows a cusp-like paramagnetic peak in the\nsusceptibility ($\\chi$) at zero field over the diamagnetic background. The peak\nis found to be robust against temperature and decays linearly with field from\nits zero-field value. This unique behavior of $\\chi$ is associated with the\nspin-momentum locked topological surface state of\nBi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.7}$Se$_{1.3}$. The reconstruction of surface state\nwith time is clearly reflected through the reduction of peak height with the\nage of the sample.\n", "  Directly in the thermodynamic limit, we show how to combine imaginary and\nreal time evolution of tensor networks to efficiently and accurately find the\nnonequilibrium steady states (NESS) of one-dimensional dissipative quantum\nlattices governed by the Lindblad master equation. The imaginary time evolution\nfirst bypasses any highly correlated portions of the real-time evolution\ntrajectory by directly converging to the weakly correlated subspace of the\nNESS, after which real time evolution completes the convergence to the NESS\nwith high accuracy. We demonstrate the power of the method with the dissipative\ntransverse field quantum Ising chain. We show that a crossover of an order\nparameter shown to be smooth in previous finite-size studies remains smooth in\nthe thermodynamic limit.\n", "  The recently proposed effective potential theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110,\n235001 (2013)] is used to investigate the influence of coupling on\ninter-ion-species diffusion and momentum exchange in multi-component plasmas.\nThermo-diffusion and the thermal force are found to diminish rapidly as strong\ncoupling onsets. For the same coupling parameters, the dynamic friction\ncoefficient is found to tend to unity. These results provide an impetus for\naddressing the role of coupling on diffusive processes in inertial confinement\nfusion experiments.\n", "  Device-independent self-testing allows a verifier to certify that potentially\nmalicious parties hold on to a specific quantum state, based only on the\nobserved correlations. Parallel self-testing has recently been explored, aiming\nto self-test many copies (i.e. a tensor product) of the target state\nconcurrently. In this work, we show that $n$ EPR pairs can be self-tested in\nparallel through $n$ copies of the well known CHSH game. We generalise this\nresult further to a parallel self-test of $n$ tilted EPR pairs with arbitrary\nangles, and finally we show how our results and calculations can also be\napplied to obtain a parallel self-test of $2n$ EPR pairs via $n$ copies of the\nMermin-Peres magic square game.\n", "  Selective autophagy must not only select the correct type of organelle, but\nalso must discriminate between individual organelles of the same kind so that\nsome but not all of the organelles are removed. We propose that physical\nclustering of autophagy receptor proteins on the organelle surface can provide\nan appropriate all-or-none signal for organelle degradation. We explore this\nproposal using a computational model restricted to peroxisomes and the\nrelatively well characterized pexophagy receptor proteins NBR1 and p62. We find\nthat larger peroxisomes nucleate NBR1 clusters first and lose them last through\ncompetitive coarsening. This results in significant size-selectivity that\nfavors large peroxisomes, and can explain the increased catalase signal that\nresults from siRNA inhibition of p62. Excess ubiquitin, resulting from damaged\norganelles, suppresses size-selectivity but not cluster formation. Our proposed\nselectivity mechanism thus allows all damaged organelles to be degraded, while\notherwise selecting only a portion of organelles for degradation.\n", "  In this work, we study the transport through a quantum point contact for\nbosonic helical liquid that exists at the edge of a bilayer graphene under a\nstrong magnetic field. We identify \"smoking gun\" transport signatures to\ndistinguish bosonic symmetry protected topological (BSPT) state from fermionic\ntwo-channel quantum spin Hall (QSH) state in this system. In particular, a\nnovel charge insulator/spin conductor phase is found for BSPT state, while\neither charge insulator/spin insulator or charge conductor/spin conductor phase\nis expected for the two-channel QSH state. Consequently, a simple transport\nmeasurement will reveal the fingerprint of bosonic topological physics in\nbilayer graphene systems.\n", "  In recent years, enhanced light-matter interactions through a plethora of\ndipole-type polaritonic excitations have been observed in two-dimensional (2D)\nlayered materials. In graphene, electrically tunable and highly confined\nplasmon-polaritons were predicted and observed, opening up opportunities for\noptoelectronics, bio-sensing and other mid-infrared applications. In hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN), low-loss infrared-active phonon-polaritons exhibit\nhyperbolic behavior for some frequencies, allowing for ray-like propagation\nexhibiting high quality factors and hyperlensing effects. In transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs), reduced screening in the 2D limit leads to optically\nprominent excitons with large binding energy, with these polaritonic modes\nhaving been recently observed with scanning near field optical microscopy\n(SNOM). Here, we review recent progress in state-of-the-art experiments, survey\nthe vast library of polaritonic modes in 2D materials, their optical spectral\nproperties, figures-of-merit and application space. Taken together, the\nemerging field of 2D material polaritonics and their hybrids provide enticing\navenues for manipulating light-matter interactions across the visible, infrared\nto terahertz spectral ranges, with new optical control beyond what can be\nachieved using traditional bulk materials.\n", "  Dynamical scaling arises naturally in various many-body systems far from\nequilibrium. After a short historical overview, the elements of possible\nextensions of dynamical scaling to a local scale-invariance will be introduced.\nSchr\\\"odinger-invariance, the most simple example of local scale-invariance,\nwill be introduced as a dynamical symmetry in the Edwards-Wilkinson\nuniversality class of interface growth. The Lie algebra construction, its\nrepresentations and the Bargman superselection rules will be combined with\nnon-equilibrium Janssen-de Dominicis field-theory to produce explicit\npredictions for responses and correlators, which can be compared to the results\nof explicit model studies.\n  At the next level, the study of non-stationary states requires to go over,\nfrom Schr\\\"odinger-invariance, to ageing-invariance. The ageing algebra admits\nnew representations, which acts as dynamical symmetries on more general\nequations, and imply that each non-equilibrium scaling operator is\ncharacterised by two distinct, independent scaling dimensions. Tests of\nageing-invariance are described, in the Glauber-Ising and spherical models of a\nphase-ordering ferromagnet and the Arcetri model of interface growth.\n", "  Generalizations of the Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are discussed in an\nastrophysically viable generalized theory of gravity, which includes higher\ncurvature corrections in the form of the Gauss-Bonnet term, coupled to a\ndilaton. The angular momentum of these black holes can slightly exceed the Kerr\nbound. The location and the orbital frequency of particles in their innermost\nstable circular orbits can deviate significantly from the respective Kerr\nvalues. Study of the quasinormal modes of the static black holes gives strong\nevidence that they are mode stable against polar and axial perturbations.\nFuture gravitational wave observations should improve the current bound on the\nGauss-Bonnet coupling constant, based on observations of the low-mass x-ray\nbinary A 0620-00.\n", "  Key features of jet-medium interactions in heavy-ion collisions are\nmodifications to the jet structure. Recent results from experiments at the LHC\nand RHIC have motivated several theoretical calculations and monte carlo models\ntowards predicting these observables simultaneously. In this report, the recoil\npicture in \\textsc{Jewel} is summarized and two independent procedures through\nwhich background subtraction can be performed in \\textsc{Jewel} are introduced.\nInformation of the medium recoil in \\textsc{Jewel} significantly improves its\ndescription of several jet shape measurements.\n", "  Optomechanical quantum interfaces can be utilized to connect systems with\ndistinctively different frequencies in hybrid quantum networks. Here we present\na scheme of nonreciprocal quantum state conversion between microwave and\noptical photons via an optomechanical interface. By introducing an auxiliary\ncavity and manipulating the phase differences between the linearized\noptomechanical couplings, uni-directional state transmission can be achieved.\nThe interface can function as an isolator, a circulator, and a two-way switch\nthat routes the input states to a selected output channel. We show that under a\ngeneralized impedance matching condition, the state conversion can reach high\nfidelity and is robust against the thermal fluctuations in the mechanical mode.\n", "  The superconductor FeSe is of intense interest thanks to its unusual\nnon-magnetic nematic state and potential for high temperature\nsuperconductivity. But its Cooper pairing mechanism has not been determined.\nHere we use Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference imaging to determine the\nFermi surface geometry of the bands surrounding the $\\Gamma = (0,0)$ and\n$X=(\\pi / a_{Fe}, 0)$ points of FeSe, and to measure the corresponding\nsuperconducting energy gaps. We show that both gaps are extremely anisotropic\nbut nodeless, and exhibit gap maxima oriented orthogonally in momentum space.\nMoreover, by implementing a novel technique we demonstrate that these gaps have\nopposite sign with respect to each other. This complex gap configuration\nreveals the existence of orbital-selective Cooper pairing which, in FeSe, is\nbased preferentially on electrons from the $d_{yz}$ orbitals of the iron atoms.\n", "  Several arguments suggest that stochastic condensation of cold gas and its\naccretion onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) is essential for\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to work in the most massive galaxies that\nlie at the centres of galaxy clusters. Our 3-D hydrodynamic AGN jet-ICM\n(intracluster medium) simulations, looking at the detailed angular momentum\ndistribution of cold gas and its time variability for the first time, show that\nthe angular momentum of the cold gas crossing $\\lesssim 1$ kpc is essentially\nisotropic. With almost equal mass in clockwise and counter-clockwise\norientations, we expect a cancellation of angular momentum on roughly the\ndynamical time. This means that a compact accretion flow with a short viscous\ntime ought to form, through which enough accretion power can be channeled into\njet mechanical energy sufficiently quickly to prevent a cooling flow. The\ninherent stochasticity, expected in feedback cycles driven by cold gas\ncondensation, gives rise to a large variation in the cold gas mass at the\ncentres of galaxy clusters, for similar cluster and SMBH masses, in agreement\nwith the observations. Such correlations are expected to be much tighter for\nthe smoother hot/Bondi accretion. The weak correlation between cavity power and\nBondi power obtained from our simulations also match observations.\n", "  Non-blazar Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have emerged as a new gamma-ray\nemitting source class on the extragalactic sky and started to deepen our\nunderstanding of the physical processes and the nature of AGN in general. The\ndetection of Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies in the Fermi-LAT energy regime, for\nexample, offers important information for our understanding of jet formation\nand radio-loudness. Radio galaxies, on the other hand, have become particularly\ninteresting at high (HE) and very high (VHE) gamma-ray energies. With their\njets not directly pointing towards us (i.e. misaligned), they offer a unique\ntool to probe into the nature of the fundamental (and often hidden) physical\nprocesses in AGN. This review highlights and discusses some of the\nobservational and theoretical progress achieved in the gamma-ray regime during\nrecent years, including the evidence for unexpected spectral hardening in\nCentaurus A and extreme short-term variability as seen in IC 310 and M87.\n", "  We study the role of turbulence in magnetic reconnection, within the\nframework of magneto-hydrodynamics, using three-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulations. For small turbulent intensity we find that the reconnection rate\nobeys Sweet-Parker scaling. For large enough turbulent intensity reconnection\nrate departs significantly from Sweet-Parker behaviour, becomes almost a\nconstant as a function of the Lundquist number. We further study energisation\nof test-particles in the same setup. We find that the speed of the energised\nparticles obeys a Maxwellian distribution, whose variance also obeys\nSweet-Parker scaling for small turbulent intensity but depends weakly on the\nLundquist number for large turbulent intensity. Furthermore, the variance is\nfound to increase with the strength of the reconnecting magnetic field.\n", "  An experimental test of Bell's inequality allows ruling out any\nlocal-realistic description of nature by measuring correlations between distant\nsystems. While such tests are conceptually simple, there are strict\nrequirements concerning the detection efficiency of the involved measurements,\nas well as the enforcement of spacelike separation between the measurement\nevents. Only very recently could both loopholes be closed simultaneously. Here\nwe present a statistically significant, event-ready Bell test based on\ncombining heralded entanglement of atoms separated by $398\\,\\mathrm{m}$ with\nfast and efficient measurements of the atomic spin states closing essential\nloopholes. We obtain a violation with $S=2.221\\pm0.033$ (compared to the\nmaximal value of 2 achievable with models based on local hidden variables)\nwhich allows us to refute the hypothesis of local-realism with a significance\nlevel $P<2.57\\cdot10^{-9}$.\n", "  In this work we study the Kirkwood-Salsburg equations of equilibrium\nclassical continuous systems. We prove a Laurent expansion for the resolvent,\nat an eigenvalue of largest modulus of the Kirkwood-Salsburg operator, which is\nshown to have a pole of order 1. Then we prove that all correlation functions\nhave an asymptotic limit as the activity parameter tends to a smallest zero of\nthe partition function. As corollary, we show that any smallest zero of the\npartition function is simple. The main consequence is that in case of positive\nor hardcore potentials we find the spectral radius of the Kirkwood-Salsburg\noperator and the convergence radius of the solutions.\n", "  We consider ground states of quantum spin chains with symmetry-protected\ntopological (SPT) order as resources for measurement-based quantum computation\n(MBQC). We show that, for a wide range of SPT phases, the computational power\nof ground states is uniform throughout each phase. This computational power,\ndefined as the Lie group of executable gates in MBQC, is determined by the same\nalgebraic information that labels the SPT phase itself. We prove that these Lie\ngroups always contain a full set of single-qubit gates, thereby affirming the\nlong-standing conjecture that general SPT phases can serve as computationally\nuseful phases of matter.\n", "  In heavy-fermion compounds, f electrons show both itinerant and localized\nbehaviour depending on the external conditions, and the hybridization between\nlocalized f electrons and itinerant conduction bands gives rise to their exotic\nproperties like heavy-fermions, magnetic orders and unconventional\nsuperconductivity. Duo to the risk of handling radioactive actinide materials,\nthe direct experimental evidence of the band structure evolution across the\nlocalized-itinerant and magnetic transitions for 5f electrons is lacking. Here,\nby using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we revealed the dual nature\n(localized vs itinerant) and the development of two different kinds of heavy\nquasi-particle bands of 5f electrons in antiferromagnetic (AFM) USb2. Partially\nopened energy gaps were observed on one quasi-particle 5f band cross the AFM\ntransition around 203 K, indicating that the magnetic orders in USb2 are of\nspin density wave (SDW) type similar to Cr. The localized 5f electrons and\nitinerant conduction bands hybridize to form another heavy quasi-particle band\nat about 120 K, and then open hybridization gaps at even lower temperature. Our\nresults provide direct spectral demonstration of the localized-itinerant\ntransition, hybridization and SDW transition of 5f electrons for uranium-based\nmaterials.\n", "  Device-independent self-testing allows to uniquely characterize the quantum\nstate shared by untrusted parties (up to local isometries) by simply inspecting\ntheir correlations, and requiring only minimal assumptions, namely a\nno-signaling constraint on the untrusted parties and the validity of quantum\nmechanics. The device-independent approach exploits the fact that certain\nnon-local correlations can be uniquely achieved by measurements on a particular\nquantum state. We can think of these correlations as a \"classical fingerprint\"\nof the self-tested quantum state. In this work, we answer affirmatively the\noutstanding open question of whether all pure bipartite entangled states can be\nself-tested, by providing explicit self-testing correlations for each.\n", "  The theoretical understanding of time-dependence in magnetic quantum systems\nis of great importance in particular for cases where a unitary time evolution\nis accompanied by relaxation processes. A key example is given by the dynamics\nof single-molecule magnets where quantum tunneling of the magnetization\ncompetes with thermal relaxation over the anisotropy barrier. In this article\nwe investigate how good a Lindblad approach describes the relaxation in giant\nspin models and how the result depends on the employed operator that transmits\nthe action of the thermal bath.\n", "  The present investigation deals with the puffing and micro-explosion\ncharacteristics in the combustion of a single droplet comprising butanol/Jet\nA-1, acetone-butanol-ethanol (A-B-E)/Jet A-1 blends, and A-B-E. The onset of\nnucleation, growth of vapor bubble and subsequent breakup of droplet for\nvarious fuel blends have been analyzed from the high-speed images. Puffing was\nobserved to be the dominant phenomenon in 30% butanol blend, while\nmicro-explosion was found to be the dominant one in other fuel blends (blend\nwith 50% butanol or 30% A-B-E or 50% A-B-E). It was observed that puffing\nalways preceded the micro-explosion. The probability of micro-explosion in\ndroplets with A-B-E blends was found to be higher than that of butanol blends.\nAlthough the rate of bubble growth was almost similar for all butanol and A-B-E\nblends, the final bubble diameter before the droplet breakup was found to be\nhigher for 50/50 blends than that of 30/70 blends. The occurrence of\nmicro-explosion shortened the droplet lifetime, and this effect appeared to be\nstronger for droplets with 50/50 composition. Micro-explosion led to the\nejection of both larger and smaller secondary droplets; however, puffing\nresulted in relatively smaller secondary droplets compared to micro-explosion.\nPuffing/micro-explosion were also observed in the secondary droplets.\n", "  It is known that in pressurized H2S the complex electronic structure in the\nenergy range of 200 meV near the chemical potential can be separated into two\nelectronic components, the first characterized by steep bands with a high Fermi\nvelocity and the second by flat bands with a vanishing Fermi velocity. Also the\nphonon modes interacting with electrons at the Fermi energy can be separated\ninto two components: hard modes with high energy around 150 meV and soft modes\nwith energies around 60 meV. Therefore we discuss here a multiband scenario in\nthe standard BCS approximation where the effective BCS coupling coefficient is\nin the range 0.1- 0.32. We consider a first (second) BCS condensate in the\nstrong (weak) coupling regime 0.32 (0.15). We discuss different scenario\nsegregated in different portions of the material. The results show the\nphenomenology of unconventional superconducting phases in this two-gap\nsuperconductivity scenario where there are two electronic components in two\nFermi surface spots, the pairing is mediated by either by a soft or a hard\nphonon branch where the inter-band exchange term, also if small, plays a key\nrole for the emergence of high temperature superconductivity in pressurized\nsulfur hydride.\n", "  Geometric representations of solutions provides intuitive physical insights.\nTo which end studying dynamics of Quantum systems via $su (n)$ Lie algebra\nproves to be convenient way of obtaining geometric solution. In this paper link\nis established between two formalisms that made use of Lie algebra to describe\nequation of motion for quantum system. In both approaches the Hamiltonian and\nthe density matrix are expressed as a linear combination of the Lie group. To\nexemplify the approach we consider a very well studied two level system coupled\nby a laser pulse. Beyond establishing link between these two formalism we\nobtained two constants of motion by assuming time dependent detuning whose time\nprofile is assumed to be same as the laser pulse. Consequently we have shown\nhow one can have two disjoint subspaces whose evolution vector is independent\nof each other.\n", "  In this paper we study the behavior of the Casimir energy of a \"multi-cavity\"\nacross the transition from the metallic to the superconducting phase of the\nconstituting plates. Our analysis is carried out in the framework of the\nARCHIMEDES experiment, aiming at measuring the interaction of the\nelectromagnetic vacuum energy with a gravitational field. For this purpose it\nis foreseen to modulate the Casimir energy of a layered structure composing a\nmulti-cavity coupled system by inducing a transition from the metallic to the\nsuperconducting phase. This implies a thorough study of the behavior of the\ncavity, where normal metallic layers are alternated with superconducting\nlayers, across the transition.\n  Our study finds that, because of the coupling between the cavities, mainly\nmediated by the transverse magnetic modes of the radiation field, the variation\nof energy across the transition can be very large.\n", "  We have calculated the high spin parton splitting amplitudes postulating the\nYangian symmetry of the scattering amplitudes for tensorgluons. The resulting\nsplitting amplitudes coincide with the earlier calculations, which were based\non the BCFW recursion relations. The resulting formula unifies all known\nsplitting probabilities found earlier in gauge field theories. It describes\nsplitting probabilities for integer and half-integer spin particles. We also\nchecked that the splitting probabilities fulfil generalised Kounnas-Ross N=1\nsupersymmetry relations hinting to the fact that the underlying theory can be\nformulated in an explicit supersymmetric manner.\n", "  Quantum sensors based on matter-wave interferometry are promising candidates\nfor high-precision gravimetry and inertial sensing in space. The favorable\nsource for the coherent matter waves in these devices are Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. A reliable prediction of their dynamics, which is governed by the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, requires suitable analytical and numerical methods\nwhich take into account the center-of-mass motion of the condensate, its\nrotation and its spatial expansion by many orders of magnitude. In this\nchapter, we present an efficient way to study their dynamics in time-dependent\nrotating traps that meet this objective. Both, an approximate analytical\nsolution for condensates in the Thomas-Fermi regime and dedicated numerical\nsimulations on a variable adapted grid are discussed. We contrast and relate\nour approach to previous alternative methods and provide further results, such\nas analytical expressions for the one- and two-dimensional spatial density\ndistributions and the momentum distribution in the long-time limit that are of\nimmediate interest to experimentalists working in this field of research.\n", "  After numerous astronomical and experimental searches, the precise particle\nnature of dark matter is still unknown. The standard Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticle(WIMP) dark matter, despite successfully explaining the large-scale\nfeatures of the universe, has long-standing small-scale issues. The spectral\ndistortion in the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) caused by Silk damping in\nthe pre-recombination era allows one to access information on a range of small\nscales $0.3 \\, {\\rm Mpc} < k < 10^4 \\, \\rm Mpc^{-1}$, whose dynamics can be\nprecisely described using linear theory. In this paper, we investigate the\npossibility of using the Silk damping induced CMB spectral distortion as a\nprobe of the small-scale power. We consider four suggested alternative dark\nmatter candidates---Warm Dark Matter (WDM), Late Forming Dark Matter, Ultra\nLight Axion dark matter and Charged Decaying Dark Matter; the matter power in\nall these models deviate significantly from the $\\Lambda$CDM model at small\nscales. We compute the spectral distortion of CMB for these alternative models\nand compare our results with the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We show that the main\nimpact of alternative models is to alter the sub-horizon evolution of the\nNewtonian potential which affects the late-time behaviour of spectral\ndistortion of CMB. The $y$-parameter diminishes by a few percent as compared to\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model for a range of parameters of these models: LFDM for\nformation redshift $z_f = 10^5$ (7\\%); WDM for mass $m_{\\rm wdm} = 1 \\, \\rm\nkeV$ (2\\%); CHDM for decay redshift $z_{\\rm decay} = 10^5$ (5\\%); ULA for mass\n$m_a = 10^{-24} \\, \\rm eV$ (3\\%). We also briefly discuss the detectability of\nthis deviation in light of the upcoming CMB experiment PIXIE, which might have\nthe sensitivity to detect this signal from the pre-recombination phase.\n", "  We derive an analytic expression for the temperature dependent critical\nmagnetic field parallel to ultrathin superconducting films with Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction. Thereby we cover the range from small to large\nspin-orbit interactions $\\lambda$ compared with the gap parameter $\\Delta_0$.\nWe find that at a critical spin-orbit energy $\\lambda_c$ a first-order phase\ntransition takes place at which the pairing momentum of the Cooper pairs\nchanges discontinuously. We speculate that this might give raise to new\nphenomena. With increasing $\\lambda/\\Delta_0$, the pair formation changes from\ninterband to intraband pairing. For $\\lambda>\\lambda_c$, a dimensional\ncross-over of the critical field from two to one dimension is taking place.\n", "  We study the possibility of efficient self-compression of femtosecond laser\npulses in nonlinear media with anomalous dispersion of group velocity during\nthe self-focusing of wave packets with a power several times greater than the\ncritical self-focusing power. The results of qualitative analysis of the\nevolution of three-dimensional wave packets with the quasi-soliton field\ndistribution are confirmed by the computer simulation. The simulation proves\nthat the considered regime of compression of high-power laser pulses with\ninitial durations of about ten optical cycles is stable relative to\nfilamentation instability due to the influence of the nonlinear dispersion. We\ndemonstrate the possibility of self-compression of laser pulses at a\nmulti-millijoule energy level and up to one optical cycle with an energy\nefficiency of more then 50%.\n", "  An experiment conducted in the framework of the EUHIT project and designed to\ncharacterize large scale structures in an adverse pressure gradient boundary\nlayer flow is presented. Up to 16 sCMOS cameras were used in order to perform\nlarge scale turbulent boundary layer PIV measurements with a large field of\nview and appropriate spatial resolution. To access the span-wise / wall-normal\nsignature of the structures as well, stereoscopic PIV measurements in\nspan-wise/wall-normal planes were performed at specific stream-wise locations.\nTo complement these large field of view measurements, long-range micro-PIV,\ntime resolved near wall velocity profiles and film-based measurements were\nperformed in order to determine the wall-shear stress and its fluctuations at\nsome specific locations along the model.\n", "  Hybrid halide perovskites are currently under intense investigation due to\ntheir potential applications in optoelectronics and solar cells. Among them,\nMAPbI$_3$ where MA stands for the methylammonium cation, exhibits ideal\nproperties for solar cells. In attempt to identify new lead-free halide\nperovskites we have studied using \\textit{ab-initio} electronic structure\ncalculations in conjunction with hybrid functionals a series of MABX$_3$\ncompounds where B is a divalent cation and X a halogen atom. Our results\nsuggest that the compounds under study exhibit a variety of lattice constants\nand energy band gaps. Especially, MAZnCl$_3$, MACdBr$_3$, MAGeCl$_3$ and\nMAGeBr$_3$ are susceptible to replace MAPbI$_3$ in devices since they show\ncomparable energy gaps. Further calculations on the mixed hybrid halide\nperovskites show that we can tune the values of the energy gap although no\nsimplified pattern exists. Our results pave the way for further investigation\non the use of these materials in technology relevant applications.\n", "  A minus sign is inserted, for good reason, into the formula for the\nEnergy-Momentum Tensor for tachyons. This leads to remarkable theoretical\nconsequences and a plausible explanation for the phenomenon called Dark Energy\nin the cosmos.\n", "  We analyze the quantum dynamics of periodically driven, disordered systems in\nthe presence of long-range interactions. Focusing on the stability of discrete\ntime crystalline (DTC) order in such systems, we use a perturbative procedure\nto evaluate its lifetime. For 3D systems with dipolar interactions, we show\nthat the corresponding decay is parametrically slow, implying that robust,\nlong-lived DTC order can be obtained. We further predict a sharp crossover from\nthe stable DTC regime into a regime where DTC order is lost, reminiscent of a\nphase transition. These results are in good agreement with the recent\nexperiments utilizing a dense, dipolar spin ensemble in diamond [Nature 543,\n221-225 (2017)]. They demonstrate the existence of a novel, critical DTC regime\nthat is stabilized not by many-body localization but rather by slow, critical\ndynamics. Our analysis shows that the DTC response can be used as a sensitive\nprobe of nonequilibrium quantum matter.\n", "  One-neutron removal $(p,pn)$ reactions induced by two-neutron Borromean\nnuclei are studied within a Transfer-to-the-Continuum (TC) reaction framework,\nwhich incorporates the three-body character of the incident nucleus. The\nrelative energy distribution of the residual unbound two-body subsystem, which\nis assumed to retain information on the structure of the original three-body\nprojectile, is computed by evaluating the transition amplitude for different\nneutron-core final states in the continuum. These transition amplitudes depend\non the overlaps between the original three-body ground-state wave function and\nthe two-body continuum states populated in the reaction, thus ensuring a\nconsistent description of the incident and final nuclei. By comparing different\n$^{11}$Li three-body models, it is found that the $^{11}$Li$(p,pn){^{10}}$Li\nrelative energy spectrum is very sensitive to the position of the $p_{1/2}$ and\n$s_{1/2}$ states in $^{10}$Li and to the partial wave content of these\nconfigurations within the $^{11}$Li ground-state wave function. The possible\npresence of a low-lying $d_{5/2}$ resonance is discussed. The coupling of the\nsingle particle configurations with the non-zero spin of the $^{9}$Li core,\nwhich produces a spin-spin splitting of the states, is also studied. Among the\nconsidered models, the best agreement with the available data is obtained with\na $^{11}$Li model that incorporates the actual spin of the core and contains\n$\\sim$31\\% of $p_{1/2}$-wave content in the $n$-$^9$Li subsystem, in accord\nwith our previous findings for the $^{11}$Li(p,d)$^{10}$Li transfer reaction,\nand a near-threshold virtual state.\n", "  The quality of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio observations\npredominantly relies on precise and ultra-stable time and frequency (T&F)\nstandards, usually hydrogen masers (HM), maintained locally at each VLBI\nstation. Here, we present an operational solution in which the VLBI\nobservations are routinely carried out without use of a local HM, but using\nremote synchronization via a stabilized, long-distance fibre-optic link. The\nT&F reference signals, traceable to international atomic timescale (TAI), are\ndelivered to the VLBI station from a dedicated timekeeping laboratory.\nMoreover, we describe a proof-of-concept experiment where the VLBI station is\nsynchronized to a remote strontium optical lattice clock during the\nobservation.\n", "  Continuous symmetries of the Hirota difference equation, commuting with\nshifts of independent variables, are derived by means of the dressing\nprocedure. Action of these symmetries on the dependent variables of the\nequation is presented. Commutativity of these symmetries enables interpretation\nof their parameters as \"times\" of the nonlinear integrable partial\ndifferential-difference and differential equations. Examples of equations\nresulting in such procedure and their Lax pairs are given. Besides these,\nordinary, symmetries the additional ones are introduced and their action on the\nScattering data is presented.\n", "  While it is known that the amplification of the superconducting critical\ntemperature Tc is possible in a system of multiple electronic components in\ncomparison with a single component system, many different road maps for room\ntemperature superconductivity have been proposed for a variety of\nmulticomponent scenarios. Here we focus on the scenario where the first\nelectronic component is assumed to have a vanishing Fermi velocity\ncorresponding to a case of the intermediate polaronic regime, and the second\nelectronic component is in the weak coupling regime with standard high Fermi\nvelocity using a mean field theory for multiband superconductivity. This\nroadmap is motivated by compelling experimental evidence for one component in\nthe proximity of a Lifshitz transition in cuprates, diborides and iron based\nsuperconductors. By keeping a constant and small exchange interaction between\nthe two electron fluids, we search for the optimum coupling strength in the\nelectronic polaronic component which gives the largest amplification of the\nsuperconducting critical temperature in comparison with the case of a single\nelectronic component.\n", "  The inferred parameters of the binary black hole GW151226 are consistent with\nnonzero spin for the most massive black hole, misaligned from the binary's\norbital angular momentum. If the black holes formed through isolated binary\nevolution from an initially aligned binary star, this misalignment would then\narise from a natal kick imparted to the first-born black hole at its birth\nduring stellar collapse. We use simple kinematic arguments to constrain the\ncharacteristic magnitude of this kick, and find that a natal kick $v_k \\gtrsim\n50$ km/s must be imparted to the black hole at birth to produce misalignments\nconsistent with GW151226. Such large natal kicks exceed those adopted by\ndefault in most of the current supernova and binary evolution models.\n", "  Blazars show variability on timescales ranging from minutes to years, the\nformer being comparable to and in some cases even shorter than the\nlight-crossing time of the central black hole. The observed gamma-ray\nlightcurves can be described by a power-law power density spectrum (PDS), with\na similar index for both BL Lacs and flat-spectrum radio quasars. We show that\nthis variability can be produced by turbulence in relativistic jets launched by\nmagnetically arrested accretion flows (MADs). We perform radiative transport\ncalculations on the turbulent, highly-magnetized jet launching region of a MAD\nwith a rapidly rotating supermassive black hole. The resulting synchrotron and\nsynchrotron self-Compton emission, originating from close to the black hole\nhorizon, is highly variable. This variability is characterized by PDS which is\nremarkably similar to the observed power-law spectrum at frequencies less than\na few per day. Furthermore, turbulence in the jet launching region naturally\nproduces fluctuations in the plasma on scales much smaller than the horizon\nradius. We speculate that similar turbulent processes, operating in the jet at\nlarge radii (and therefore high bulk Lorentz factor), are responsible for\nblazar variability over many decades in frequency, including on minute\ntimescales.\n", "  The spin-boson model is a simplified Hamiltonian often used to study\nnon-adiabatic dynamics in large condensed phase systems, even though it has not\nbeen solved in a fully analytic fashion. Herein, we present an exact analytic\nexpression for the dynamics of the spin-boson model in the infinitely slow bath\nlimit and generalize it to approximate dynamics for faster baths. We achieve\nthe latter by developing a hybrid approach that combines the exact slow-bath\nresult with the popular NIBA method to generate a memory kernel that is\nformally exact to second order in the diabatic coupling but also contains\nhigher-order contributions approximated from the second order term alone. This\nkernel has the same computational complexity as NIBA, but is found to yield\ndramatically superior dynamics in regimes where NIBA breaks down---such as\nsystems with large diabatic coupling or energy bias. This indicates that this\nhybrid approach could be used to cheaply incorporate higher order effects into\nsecond order methods, and could potentially be generalized to develop alternate\nkernel resummation schemes.\n", "  After more than a decade of extensive research on the magnetic order\ntriggered by lattice defects in a wide range of nominally non-magnetic\nmaterials, we report its application in a spintronic device. This device is\nbased on a spin-filter phenomenon we discovered at the interfaces between\ndefect-induced magnetic and non-magnetic regions, produced at the surface of a\nLi doped ZnO microwire by low-energy proton implantation. Positive\nmagnetoresistance is observed at 300~K and scales with the number of interfaces\nintroduced along the wire.\n", "  We present a search for metal absorption line systems at the highest\nredshifts to date using a deep (30h) VLT/X-Shooter spectrum of the z = 7.084\nquasi-stellar object (QSO) ULAS J1120+0641. We detect seven intervening systems\nat z > 5.5, with the highest-redshift system being a C IV absorber at z = 6.51.\nWe find tentative evidence that the mass density of C IV remains flat or\ndeclines with redshift at z < 6, while the number density of C II systems\nremains relatively flat over 5 < z < 7. These trends are broadly consistent\nwith models of chemical enrichment by star formation-driven winds that include\na softening of the ultraviolet background towards higher redshifts. We find a\nlarger number of weak ( W_rest < 0.3A ) Mg II systems over 5.9 < z < 7.0 than\npredicted by a power-law fit to the number density of stronger systems. This is\nconsistent with trends in the number density of weak Mg II systems at z = 2.5,\nand suggests that the mechanisms that create these absorbers are already in\nplace at z = 7. Finally, we investigate the associated narrow Si IV, C IV, and\nN V absorbers located near the QSO redshift, and find that at least one\ncomponent shows evidence of partial covering of the continuum source.\n", "  We demonstrate tuning of the Fermi contour anisotropy of two-dimensional (2D)\nholes in a symmetric GaAs (001) quantum well via the application of in-plane\nstrain. The ballistic transport of high-mobility hole carriers allows us to\nmeasure the Fermi wavevector of 2D holes via commensurability oscillations as a\nfunction of strain. Our results show that a small amount of in-plane strain, on\nthe order of $10^{-4}$, can induce significant Fermi wavevector anisotropy as\nlarge as 3.3, equivalent to a mass anisotropy of 11 in a parabolic band. Our\nmethod to tune the anisotropy \\textit{in situ} provides a platform to study the\nrole of anisotropy on phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect and\ncomposite fermions in interacting 2D systems.\n", "  Quantification of the velocity and magnetic field reversals in dynamo remains\nan interesting challenge. In this paper, using group-theoretic analysis, we\nclassify the reversing and non-reversing Fourier modes during a dynamo reversal\nin a Cartesian box. Based on odd-even parities of the wavenumber indices, we\ncategorise the velocity and magnetic Fourier modes into 8 classes each. Then,\nusing the properties of the nonlinear interactions in magnetohydrodynamics, we\nshow that these 16 elements form Klein 16-group $Z_2 \\times Z_2 \\times Z_2\n\\times Z_2$. We demonstrate that field reversals in a class of Taylor-Green\ndynamo, as well as the reversals in earlier experiments and models, belong to\none of the classes predicted by our group-theoretic arguments.\n", "  We study the plane (not necessarily monochromatic) gravitational waves at\nnonlinear quadratic order on a flat background in vacuum. We show that, in the\nharmonic gauge, the nonlinear waves are unstable. We argue that, at this order,\nthis instability can not be eliminated by means of a multiscale approach, i.e.\nintroducing suitable long variables, as it is often the case when secularities\nappear in a perturbative scheme. However, this is a non-physical and\ngauge-dependent effect that disappears in a suitable system of coordinates. In\nfacts, we show that in a specific gauge such instability does not occur, and\nthat it is possible to solve exactly the second order nonlinear equations of\ngravitational waves. Incidentally, we note that this gauge coincides with the\none used by Belinski and Zakharov to find exact solitonic solutions of\nEinstein's equations, that is to an exactly integrable case, and this fact\nmakes our second order nonlinear solutions less interesting. However, the\nimportant warning is that one must be aware of the existence of the instability\nreported in this paper, when studying nonlinear gravitational waves in the\nharmonic gauge.\n", "  The electrons found in Dirac materials are notorious for being difficult to\nmanipulate due to the Klein phenomenon and absence of backscattering. Here we\ninvestigate how spatial modulations of the Fermi velocity in two-dimensional\nDirac materials can give rise to localization effects, with either full\n(zero-dimensional) confinement or partial (one-dimensional) confinement\npossible depending on the geometry of the velocity modulation. We present\nseveral exactly solvable models illustrating the nature of the bound states\nwhich arise, revealing how the gradient of the Fermi velocity is crucial for\ndetermining fundamental properties of the bound states such as the zero-point\nenergy. We discuss the implications for guiding electronic waves in few-mode\nwaveguides formed by Fermi velocity modulation.\n", "  We study non-equilibrium quantum transport of spin, heat, and charge in\ndiffusive heterostructures including both superconductors and materials with\nspin-dependent fields, such as textured ferromagnets and spin-orbit coupled\nmaterials. Using the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity, we derive a\ngeneral analytical formula for the zero-temperature charge conductance valid in\nthe non-linear regime. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with\nprevious numerical calculations at small but finite temperatures. We predict a\nstrong deviation between the conductance spectra and local density of states in\ncertain junctions, which is important to correctly identify spectroscopic\nfingerprints of unconventional superconductivity.\n", "  Four groups (even-even, even-odd, odd-even and odd-odd) of heavy and\nsuper-heavy nuclei are of interest for the synthesis of the isotopes with\n$Z=119, 120$. We report calculations of $\\alpha$~decay half-lives using four\nmodels: AKRA (Akrawy); ASAF (Analytical Super-Asymmetric Fission); UNIV\n(Universal Formula), and semFIS (Semi-empirical formula based on Fission\nTheory). We compare the experimental $Q_\\alpha$ values either with AME16 atomic\nmass evaluation (whenever available) and with the theoretical model WS4, able\nto give masses of not yet measured nuclides. For $^{92,94}$Sr cluster\nradioactivity of $^{300,302}$120 we predict a branching ratio relative to\n$\\alpha$~decay of -0.10 and 0.49, respectively, meaning that it is worth trying\nto detect such kind of decay modes in competition with $\\alpha$~decay.\n", "  Imaging with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow for observing\nthe bulk of distant galaxies at the epoch of reionisation. The recovery of\ntheir properties, such as age, color excess E(B-V), specific star formation\nrate (sSFR) and stellar mass, will mostly rely on spectral energy distribution\nfitting, based on the data provided by JWST's two imager cameras, namely the\nNear Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid Infrared Imager (MIRI). In this work\nwe analyze the effect of choosing different combinations of NIRCam and MIRI\nbroad-band filters, from 0.6 {\\mu}m to 7.7 {\\mu}m, on the recovery of these\ngalaxy properties. We performed our tests on a sample of 1542 simulated\ngalaxies, with known input properties, at z=7-10. We found that, with only 8\nNIRCam broad-bands, we can recover the galaxy age within 0.1 Gyr and the color\nexcess within 0.06 mag for 70% of the galaxies. Besides, the stellar masses and\nsSFR are recovered within 0.2 and 0.3 dex, respectively, at z=7-9. Instead, at\nz=10, no NIRCam band traces purely the {\\lambda}> 4000 {\\AA} regime and the\npercentage of outliers in stellar mass (sSFR) increases by > 20% (> 90%), in\ncomparison to z=9. The MIRI F560W and F770W bands are crucial to improve the\nstellar mass and the sSFR estimation at z=10. When nebular emission lines are\npresent, deriving correct galaxy properties is challenging, at any redshift and\nwith any band combination. In particular, the stellar mass is systematically\noverestimated in up to 0.3 dex on average with NIRCam data alone and including\nMIRI observations improves only marginally the estimation.\n", "  We report the results of a survey for HI 21-cm absorption at redshifts of z >\n2.6 in a new sample of radio sources with the Green Bank and Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescopes. From a total of 25 targets, we report zero detections in the\n16 for which optical depth limits could be obtained. Based upon the detection\nrate for z > 0.1 associated absorption, we would expect approximately four\ndetections. Of the 11 which have previously not been searched, there is\nsufficient source-frame optical/ultra-violet photometry to determine the\nionising photon rate for four. Adding these to the literature, the hypothesis\nthat there is a critical rate of logQ = 56 ionising photons per second is now\nsignificant at ~7 sigma. This reaffirms our assertion that searching z > 3\nactive galaxies for which optical redshifts are available selects sources in\nwhich the ultra-violet luminosity is sufficient to ionise all of the neutral\ngas in the host galaxy.\n", "  Interest in finite-size systems has risen in the last decades, due to the\nfocus on nanotechnological applications and because they are convenient for\nnumerical treatment that can subsequently be extrapolated to infinite lattices.\nIndependently of the envisioned application, special attention must be given to\nboundary condition, which may or may not preserve the symmetry of the infinite\nlattice. Here we present a detailed study of the compatibility between boundary\nconditions and conservation laws. The conflict between open boundary conditions\nand momentum conservation is well understood, but we examine other symmetries,\nas well: we discuss gauge invariance, inversion, spin, and particle-hole\nsymmetry and their compatibility with open, periodic, and twisted boundary\nconditions. We develop the reasoning in the framework of the one-dimensional\nhalf-filled Hubbard model, whose Hamiltonian displays a variety of symmetries.\nOur discussion includes analytical and numerical results. Our analytical survey\nshows that boundary conditions break one or more symmetries of the\ninfinite-lattice Hamiltonian. The exception is twisted boundary condition with\nthe special torsion $\\Theta=\\pi L/2$, where $L$ is the lattice size. Our\nnumerical results for the ground-state energy at half-filling and the energy\ngap for $L=2$--$7$ show how the breaking of symmetry affects the convergence to\nthe $L\\to\\infty$ limit. We compare the computed energies and gaps with the\nexact results for the infinite lattice drawn from the Bethe-Ansatz solution.\nThe deviations are boundary-condition dependent. The special torsion yields\nmore rapid convergence than open or periodic boundary conditions. For sizes as\nsmall as $L=7$, the numerical results for twisted condition are very close to\nthe $L\\to\\infty$ limit. We also discuss the ground-state electronic density and\nmagnetization at half filling under the three boundary conditions.\n", "  Electronic structure has been studied in lightly electron doped correlated\nspin-orbit insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ by angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy. We have observed coexistence of the lower Hubbard band and the\nin-gap band, the momentum dependence of the latter traces that of the band\ncalculations without on-site Coulomb repulsion. The in-gap state remained\nanisotropically gapped in all observed momentum area, forming a remnant Fermi\nsurface state, evolving towards the Fermi energy by carrier doping. These\nexperimental results show a striking similarity with those observed in deeply\nunderdoped cuprates, suggesting the common nature of the nodal liquid states\nobserved in both compounds.\n", "  It is of great interest to explore intrinsic two-dimensional ferromagnetism\nand seek better two-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall insulator materials.\nHere, we show that the FeBr$_3$ monolayer is an intrinsic two-dimensional\nferromagnetic material whose Curie temperature is 140 K thanks to its strong\nspin exchange interaction and giant uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Our phonon\nspectra and mechanical analysis indicate that the FeBr$_3$ monolayer is\ndynamically and mechanically stable. Our electronic structure calculation shows\nthat there is one Dirac cone at K point in the Brillouin zone and the\nspin-orbit coupling opens a semiconductor gap of 33.5 meV. Further\ntight-binding analysis reveals that the Chern number is equivalent to 1 and\nthere is a quantum anomalous Hall conductivity $\\sigma _{xy} = e^2/h$, and the\nchiral edge states are fully spin-polarized when an edge is created.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the main results are not affected by electron\ncorrelation effects and biaxial strain. Therefore, this FeBr$_3$ monolayer as\n2D material would be useful for spintronic applications.\n", "  It is illustrated how LHC precision measurements of rates and distributions\nin single-Higgs production can be used to constrain the charm Yukawa as well as\nthe Higgs trilinear coupling.\n", "  Waiting time distribution and the zero-frequency full counting statistics of\nunidirectional electron transport through a double quantum dot molecule\nattached to spin-polarized leads are analyzed using the quantum master\nequation. The waiting time distribution exhibits a non-trivial dependence on\nthe value of the exchange coupling between the dots and the gradient of the\napplied magnetic field, which reveals the oscillations between the spin states\nof the molecule. The zero-frequency full counting statistics, on the other\nhand, is independent of the aforementioned quantities, thus giving no insight\ninto the internal dynamics. The fact that the waiting time distribution and the\nzero-frequency full counting statistics give a non-equivalent information is\nassociated with two factors. Firstly, it can be explained by the sensitivity to\ndifferent timescales of the dynamics of the system. Secondly, it is associated\nwith the presence of the correlation between subsequent waiting times, which\nmakes the renewal theory, relating the full counting statistics and the waiting\ntime distribution, not longer applicable. The study highlights the particular\nusefulness of the waiting time distribution for the analysis of the internal\ndynamics of mesoscopic systems.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new method for evaluating scalar one-loop Feynman\nintegrals in generalized D-dimension. The calculations play an important\nbuilding block for two-loop and higher-loop corrections to the processes at\nfuture colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International\nLinear Collider (ILC). In this method, scalar one-loop N-point functions will\nbe presented as the one-fold Mellin-Barnes representation of (N-1)-point ones\nwith shifting space-time dimension. This representation offers a clear\nadvantage that we can construct recursively the analytic expressions for\nN-point functions from the basic ones which are one-point functions. The\ncompact formulae for scalar one-loop two-point functions with massive internal\nlines and three-point, four-point functions with massless internal lines are\ngiven as examples in this article. In particular, they are written in terms of\ngeneralized hypergeometric series such as Gauss, Appell F 1 functions. We also\nperform a sample numerical check for the analytical expressions in this report\nby comparing with LoopTools and AMBRE/MB. We find that the numerical results\nfrom this work are in good agreement with LoopTools at $\\epsilon^0$ -expansion\nand AMBRE/MB at higher-order of $\\epsilon$-expansion, at higher D-dimension.\n", "  SoLid, located at SCK-CEN in Mol, Belgium, is a reactor antineutrino\nexperiment at a very short baseline of 5.5 - 10m aiming at the search for\nsterile neutrinos and for high precision measurement of the neutrino energy\nspectrum of Uranium-235. It uses a novel approach using Lithium-6 sheets and\nPVT cubes as scintillators for tagging the Inverse Beta-Decay products (neutron\nand positron). Being located overground and close to the BR2 research reactor,\nthe experiment faces a large amount of backgrounds. Efficient real-time\nbackground and noise rejection is essential in order to increase the\nsignal-background ratio for precise oscillation measurement and decrease data\nproduction to a rate which can be handled by the online software. Therefore, a\nreliable distinction between the neutrons and background signals is crucial.\nThis can be performed online with a dedicated firmware trigger. A peak counting\nalgorithm and an algorithm measuring time over threshold have been identified\nas performing well both in terms of efficiency and fake rate, and have been\nimplemented onto an FPGA. After having introduced the experimental and\ntheoretical background of neutrino oscillation physics, as well as SoLid's\ndetector technology, read-out system and trigger scheme, the thesis presents\nthe design of the firmware neutron trigger implemented by applying machine\nlearning methods.\n", "  In a recent work, Kilcik et al. (2017), have detected the temporal and\nperiodic behavior of sunspot counts (SSC) in flaring (i.e. C, M, or X class\nflares), and non-flaring active regions for the last two solar cycles, covering\nthe period: 1996 - 2016. The main results obtained are: 1) The temporal\nbehavior of monthly means of daily total SSC in flaring and non-flaring active\nregions are different and these differences are also varying from cycle to\ncycle; 2) The periodicities detected in SSC of flaring and non-flaring active\nregions are quite different and these variations are also different from one\ncycle to another; the highest detected period in the flaring active regions is\n113 days, while there are much higher periodicities (327, 312, and 256 days) in\nnon-flaring regions. The detection of typical different periodicities in\nflaring and non-flaring regions can suggests both important differences and\nphysical interpretation in the magneto-hydrodynamic behavior of the Sun. For\nthis reason in the present paper we show a further periodicity analysis of the\nsunspot counts in flaring and in non-flaring active regions using the same data\nsource of that used by the above cited authors and applying a powerful wavelet\nanalysis tool which is particularly useful to detect multiscale features of\ncomplex unsteady and unevenly sampled time series. In order to futher support\nthe differences and similarities found in the time behavior of SSC in flaring\nand non-flaring regions, we also computed the behavior of the wavelet entropy,\na proper time function which allow us to measure the degree of complexity in\nthe dynamics of the related time series.\n", "  By using N-body hydrodynamical cosmological simulations in which the\nchemistry of major metals and molecules is consistently solved for, we study\nthe interaction of metallic fine-structure lines with the CMB. Our analysis\nshows that the collisional induced emissions in the OI 145 $\\mu$m and CII 158\n$\\mu$m lines during reionization introduce a distortion of the CMB spectrum at\nlow frequencies ($\\nu < 300$ GHz) with amplitudes up to $\\Delta\nI_{\\nu}/B_{\\nu}(T_{\\rm CMB})\\sim 10^{-8}$-$10^{-7}$, i.e., at the $\\sim 0.1$\npercent level of FIRAS upper limits. Shorter wavelength fine-structure\ntransitions (OI 63 $\\mu$m, FeII 26 $\\mu$m, and SiII 35 $\\mu$m) typically sample\nthe reionization epoch at higher observing frequencies ($\\nu > 400$ GHz). This\ncorresponds to the Wien tail of the CMB spectrum and the distortion level\ninduced by those lines may be as high as $\\Delta I_{\\nu}/B_{\\nu}(T_{\\rm\nCMB})\\sim 10^{-4}$. The angular anisotropy produced by these lines should be\nmore relevant at higher frequencies: while practically negligible at $\\nu=145\n$GHz, signatures from CII 158 $\\mu$m and OI 145 $\\mu$m should amount to 1%-5%\nof the anisotropy power measured at $l \\sim 5000$ and $\\nu=220 $GHz by the ACT\nand SPT collaborations (after assuming $\\Delta \\nu_{\\rm obs}/\\nu_{\\rm\nobs}\\simeq 0.005$ for the line observations). Our simulations show that\nanisotropy maps from different lines (e.g., OI 145 $\\mu$m and CII 158 $\\mu$m)\nat the same redshift show a very high degree ($>0.8$) of spatial correlation,\nallowing for the use of observations at different frequencies to unveil the\nsame snapshot of the reionization epoch. Finally, our simulations demonstrate\nthat line-emission anisotropies extracted in narrow frequency/redshift shells\nare practically uncorrelated in frequency space, thus enabling standard methods\nfor removal of foregrounds that vary smoothly in frequency, just as in HI 21 cm\nstudies.\n", "  Investigating dispersion surface morphology of sonic metamaterials is crucial\nin providing information on related phenomena as inertial coupling, acoustic\ntransparency, polarisation, and absorption. In the present study, we look into\nfrequency surface morphology of two-dimensional metamaterials of K3,3 and K6\ntopologies. The elastic structures under consideration consist of the same\nsubstratum lattice points and form a pair of sublattices with hexagonal\nsymmetry. We show that, through introducing universal localised mass-in-mass\nphononic microstructures at lattice points, six single optical\nfrequency-surfaces can be formed with required properties including negative\ngroup velocity. Splitting the frequency-surfaces is based on the classical\nanalog of the quantum phenomenon of \"energy-level repulsion\", which can be\nachieved only through internal anisotropy of the nodes and allows us to obtain\ndifferent frequency band gaps.\n", "  We study the Facilitated TASEP, an interacting particle system on the one\ndimensional integer lattice. We prove that starting from step initial\ncondition, the position of the rightmost particle has Tracy Widom GSE\nstatistics on a cube root time scale, while the statistics in the bulk of the\nrarefaction fan are GUE. This uses a mapping with last-passage percolation in a\nhalf-quadrant which is exactly solvable through Pfaffian Schur processes.\n  Our results further probe the question of how first particles fluctuate for\nexclusion processes with downward jump discontinuities in their limiting\ndensity profiles. Through the Facilitated TASEP and a previously studied MADM\nexclusion process we deduce that cube-root time fluctuations seem to be a\ncommon feature of such systems. However, the statistics which arise are shown\nto be model dependent (here they are GSE, whereas for the MADM exclusion\nprocess they are GUE).\n  We also discuss a two-dimensional crossover between GUE, GOE and GSE\ndistribution by studying the multipoint distribution of the first particles\nwhen the rate of the first one varies. In terms of half-space last passage\npercolation, this corresponds to last passage times close to the boundary when\nthe size of the boundary weights is simultaneously scaled close to the critical\npoint.\n", "  We show that the well known Kronecker product is a suitable tool for the\nconstruction of matrix representations of widely used spin Hamiltonians. In\nthis way we avoid the explicit use of basis sets for the construction of the\nmatrix elements. As illustrative examples we discuss two isotropic models and\nan anisotropic one.\n", "  We present a novel distributed Lagrange multiplier/fictitious domain (DLM/FD)\nmethod for simulating fluid-particle interaction in Oldroyd-B fluids under\ncreeping conditions. The results concerning two ball interaction in a three\ndimensional (3D) bounded shear flow are obtained for Weissenberg numbers up to\n1 . The pass and return trajectories of the two ball mass centers are similar\nto those in a Newtonian fluid; but they lose the symmetry due to the effect of\nelastic force arising from viscoelastic fluids. A tumbling chain of two balls\n(a dipole) may occur, depending on the value of the Weissenberg number and the\ninitial vertical displacement of the ball mass center to the middle plane\nbetween two walls.\n", "  The relaxation phenomena of spin-torque oscillators consisting of\nnanostructured ferromagnets are interesting research targets in magnetism. A\ntheoretical study on the relaxation time of a spin-torque oscillator from one\nself-oscillation state to another is investigated. By solving the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation both analytically and numerically, it is shown\nthat the oscillator relaxes to the self-oscillation state exponentially within\na few nanoseconds, except when magnetization is close to a critical point. The\nrelaxation rate, which is an inverse of relaxation time, is proportional to the\ncurrent. On the other hand, a critical slowing down appears near the critical\npoint, where relaxation is inversely proportional to time, and the relaxation\ntime becomes on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. These conclusions are\nprimarily obtained for a spin-torque oscillator consisting of a perpendicularly\nmagnetized free layer and an in-plane magnetized pinned layer, and are further\ndeveloped for application to arbitrary types of spin-torque oscillators.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental observations of capillary-induced spooling\nof fibers inside droplets both in spider capture silk and in synthetic systems,\nwe investigate the behavior of a fiber packed in a drop. Using a simplified 2D\nmodel, we provide analytical predictions for the buckling threshold and the\ndeep post-buckling asymptotic behavior. The threshold for spooling is found to\nbe in particularly good agreement with experimental results. We further solve\nthe Elastica equations for a fiber confined in a soft potential, and track the\nequilibrium paths using numerical continuation techniques. A wealth of\ndifferent paths corresponding to different symmetries is uncovered, and their\nstability is finally discussed.\n", "  The largest Solar flare have been recorded in gamma flash and hard spectra up\nto tens GeV energy. The present building and upgrade of Hyper-Kamiokande (HK)\nand IceCube (as well as Deep Core, PINGU) neutrino detectors do offer a novel\nway to largest trace of solar Flare: their sudden anti-neutrino (or neutrino)\nflare made by proton scattering and pion decays via Delta resonance production.\nThese signals might be observable at largest flare by HK via soft spectra up to\ntens- hundred MeV energy and by IceCube-PINGU at higher, GeV up to hundred GeV,\nenergies. We show the expected rate of signals for the most powerful solar\nflare occurred in recent decades.\n", "  The Juno spacecraft has measured Jupiter's low-order, even gravitational\nmoments, $J_2$--$J_8$, to an unprecedented precision, providing important\nconstraints on the density profile and core mass of the planet. Here we report\non a selection of interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of\nhydrogen-helium mixtures. We demonstrate that a dilute core, expanded to a\nsignificant fraction of the planet's radius, is helpful in reconciling the\ncalculated $J_n$ with Juno's observations. Although model predictions are\nstrongly affected by the chosen equation of state, the prediction of an\nenrichment of $Z$ in the deep, metallic envelope over that in the shallow,\nmolecular envelope holds. We estimate Jupiter's core to contain an 7--25 Earth\nmass of heavy elements. We discuss the current difficulties in reconciling\nmeasured $J_n$ with the equations of state, and with theory for formation and\nevolution of the planet.\n", "  Nonlinear optical signals in the condensed phase are often accompanied by\nsequences of lower-order processes, known as cascades, which share the same\nphase matching and power dependence on the incoming fields and are thus hard to\ndistinguish. The suppression of cascading in order to reveal the desired\nnonlinear signal has been a major challenge in multidimensional Raman\nspectroscopy, i.e., the $\\chi^{(5)}$ signal being masked by cascading signals\ngiven by a product of two $\\chi^{(3)}$ processes. Since cascading originates\nfrom the exchange of a virtual photon between molecules, it can be manipulated\nby performing the experiment in an optical microcavity. Using a quantum\nelectrodynamical (QED) treatment we demonstrate that the $\\chi^{(3)}$ cascading\ncontributions can be greatly suppressed. By optimizing the cavity size and the\nincoming pulse directions, we show that up to $\\sim$99.5\\% suppression of the\ncascading signal is possible.\n", "  The random magnetic field produced by nuclear spins has long been viewed as\nthe dominating source of decoherence in the quantum-dot based spins. Here we\nobtain in both exact and analytical manner the dynamics of spin qubits coupled\nto nuclear spin environments via the hyperfine interaction, going beyond the\nweak system-bath interaction and Markovian approximation. We predict that the\ndetailed-balance breaking produced by chemical potential gradient in nuclear\nbaths leads to the rapid oscillations of populations, quantum coherence and\nentanglement, which are absent in the conventional case (i.e., Overhauser\nnoise). This is attributed to the nonequilibrium feature of the system as shown\nin the relation between the oscillation period and the chemical potential\nimbalance. Our results reveal the essentiality of nonequilibriumness with\ndetailed-balance breaking for enhancing the dynamical coherence and\nentanglement of spin qubits. Moreover, our exact solution explicitly\ndemonstrates that the non-Markovian bath comprised by nuclear spins can\npreserve the collective quantum state, due to the recovery of coherence.\nFinally, we propose an experiment using ultracold trapped ions to observe these\nnonequilibrium and memory effects.\n", "  Exciton-polaritons are a coherent electron-hole-photon (e-h-p) system where\ncondensation has been observed in semiconductor microcavities. In contrast to\nequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for long lifetime systems,\npolariton condensates have a dynamical nonequilibrium feature owing to the\nsimilar physical structure that they have to semiconductor lasers. One of the\ndistinguishing features of a condensate to a laser is the presence of strong\ncoupling between the matter and photon fields. Irrespective of its equilibrium\nor nonequilibrium nature, exciton-polariton have been observed to maintain\nstrong coupling. We show that by investigating high density regime of\nexciton-polariton condensates, the negative branch directly observed in\nphotoluminescence. This is evidence that the present e-h-p system is still in\nthe strong coupling regime, contrary to past results where the system reduced\nto standard lasing at high density.\n", "  In this paper we estimate diffuse foreground minimized Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) Stokes Q and U polarization maps based upon the fundamental\nconcept of Gaussian nature of CMB and strong non-Gaussian nature of\nastrophysical polarized foregrounds using WMAP nine year published polarization\nmaps. We excise regions of the sky that define position of the known point\nsources, regions that are strongly contaminated by either the detector noise or\nby the diffuse foregrounds or both, and then perform foreground minimizations\nover the surviving sky regions that constitute approximately $50\\%$ of the full\nsky area. We critically evaluate performance of foreground minimizations in\nseveral ways and show that our foreground minimization method removes\nsignificant foregrounds from input maps. The cleaned Stokes \\{Q, U\\}\npolarization maps have less EE and BB power from relevant sky region compared\nto WMAP foreground-reduced Stokes \\{Q, U\\} polarization maps at different\nmultipole ranges. We validate our methodology by performing detailed Monte\nCarlo simulations. The main driving machinery of our method is an\ninternal-linear-combination (ILC) approach, however, unlike simple variance\nminimization performed in usual ILC method, the core of the method being\ndependent on the theoretically well motivated concept of Gaussianity of CMB\npolarization a direct connection is established between observations and models\nof inflation. Additionally, the method, like the usual ILC method, is\nindependent on modeling uncertainties of polarized foregrounds. It will be\nuseful to apply our method in future generation low-noise CMB polarization\nexperiments.\n", "  Three known examples of coherent emission in radio astronomical sources are\nreviewed: plasma emission, electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) and pulsar\nradio emission.\n", "  We investigate the nonequilibrium transport properties of a silicene armchair\nnanoribbon with a random distribution of adsorbed atoms in apex positions. A\nferromagnetic insulator grown below the nanoribbon splits spin-up and spin-down\nelectron bands and gives rise to a spin polarization of the conductance. The\nconductance vanishes when the Fermi energy matches the adatom levels due to the\ncoupling of adatom localized states with the continuum spectra of the\nnanoribbon. This is the well-known Fano effect, resulting in a spin-dependent\nantiresonance in the conductance. The different antiresonance energies of\nspin-up and spin-down electrons give rise to a full spin polarization of the\nconductance in a broad energy window. This spin-dependent Fano effect opens the\npossibility to using it in spintronics as a tuneable source of polarized\nelectrons.\n", "  Star surveys and model analyses show that many stars have absolute stable\nfluxes as good as 3% in 0.3-35{\\mu}m wavebands and about 1% in the visible\nwavebands. The relative flux calibrations between stars are better than 0.2%.\nSome stars have extremely stable fluxes and can be used as long term flux\ncalibration sources. Stellar brightness is several orders of magnitude lower\nthan most ground objects while the stars do not usually appear in remote\nsensing cameras, which makes the stars inappropriate for being calibration\nsources. The calibration method using stars discussed in this paper is through\na mini-camera attached to remote sensing satellite. The mini-camera works at\nsimilar wavebands as the remote sensing cameras and it can observe the stars\nand the ground objects alternatively. High signal-to-noise ratio is achieved\nfor the relatively faint stars through longer exposure time. Simultaneous\nprecise cross-calibration is obtained as the mini-camera and remote sensing\ncameras look at the ground objects at the same time. The fluxes from the stars\nused as calibration standards are transferred to the remote sensing cameras\nthrough this procedure. Analysis shows that a 2% accurate calibration is\npossible.\n", "  In this work, we make two improvements on the staggered grid hydrodynamics\n(SGH) Lagrangian scheme for modeling 2-dimensional compressible multi-material\nflows on triangular mesh. The first improvement is the construction of a\ndynamic local remeshing scheme for preventing mesh distortion. The remeshing\nscheme is similar to many published algorithms except that it introduces some\nspecial operations for treating grids around multi-material interfaces. This\nmakes the simulation of extremely deforming and topology-variable\nmulti-material processes possible, such as the complete process of a heavy\nfluid dipping into a light fluid. The second improvement is the construction of\nan Euler-like flow on each edge of the mesh to count for the \"edge-bending\"\neffect, so as to mitigate the \"checkerboard\" oscillation that commonly exists\nin Lagrangian simulations, especially the triangular mesh based simulations.\nSeveral typical hydrodynamic problems are simulated by the improved staggered\ngrid Lagrangian hydrodynamic method to test its performance.\n", "  The purpose of this book is to explain Quantum Bayesianism ('QBism') to\n\"people without easy access to mathematical formulas and equations\" (4-5).\nQbism is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that \"doesn't meddle with the\ntechnical aspects of the theory [but instead] reinterprets the fundamental\nterms of the theory and gives them new meaning\" (3). The most important\nmotivation for QBism, enthusiastically stated on the book's cover, is that\nQBism provides \"a way past quantum theory's paradoxes and puzzles\" such that\nmuch of the weirdness associated with quantum theory \"dissolves under the lens\nof QBism\".\n  Could a non-technical book that almost fits in your pocket really succeed in\nresolving the notorious paradoxes of quantum theory? I believe the answer is:\nnot in this case. There are three primary reasons. Firstly, the argument that\nQBism solves quantum paradoxes is not convincing. Secondly, it proves difficult\nto pin down exactly what QBism says. Thirdly, as a scientific theory QBism\nseems explanatorily inert, which is maybe why the topic of scientific\nexplanation is not broached. Sections 2-4 below discuss each of these problems\nin turn. However, there is still a wealth of insights that make this book a\nworthwhile read, and I shall begin with those.\n", "  PHL 6625 is a luminous quasi-stellar object (QSO) at z = 0.3954 located\nbehind the nearby galaxy NGC 247 (z = 0.0005). Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nobservations revealed an arc structure associated with it. We report on\nspectroscopic observations with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and\nmultiwavelength observations from the radio to the X-ray band for the system,\nsuggesting that PHL 6625 and the arc are a close pair of merging galaxies,\ninstead of a strong gravitational lens system. The QSO host galaxy is estimated\nto be (4-28) x 10^10 M_sun, and the mass of the companion galaxy of is\nestimated to be M_* = (6.8 +/- 2.4) x 10^9 M_sun, suggesting that this is a\nminor merger system. The QSO displays typical broad emission lines, from which\na black hole mass of about (2-5) x 10^8 M_sun and an Eddington ratio of about\n0.01-0.05 can be inferred. The system represents an interesting and rare case\nwhere a QSO is associated with an ongoing minor merger, analogous to Arp 142.\n", "  States of self stress (SSS) are assignments of forces on the edges of a\nnetwork that satisfy mechanical equilibrium in the absence of external forces.\nIn this work we show that a particular class of quasilocalized SSS in\npacking-derived networks, first introduced in [D. M. Sussman, C. P. Goodrich,\nand A. J. Liu, Soft Matter 12, 3982 (2016)], are characterized by a lengthscale\n$\\ell_c$ that scales as $1/\\sqrt{z_c-z}$ where $z$ is the mean connectivity of\nthe network, and $z_c\\!\\equiv\\!4$ is the Maxwell threshold in two dimensions,\nat odds with previous claims. Our results verify the previously proposed\nanalogy between quasilocalized SSS and the mechanical response to a local\ndipolar force in random networks of relaxed Hookean springs. We show that the\nnormalization factor that distinguishes between quasilocalized SSS and the\nresponse to a local dipole constitutes a measure of the mechanical coupling of\nthe forced spring to the elastic network in which it is embedded. We further\ndemonstrate that the lengthscale that characterizes quasilocalized SSS does not\ndepend on its associated degree of mechanical coupling, but instead only on the\nnetwork connectivity.\n", "  Manipulating vortices in non-conventional superconductors is nowadays a\nchallenging path toward controlling functionalities for superconducting\nnanodevices. Here, we directly observe and control single vortex core\ntrajectories with unmatched resolution using a new scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy at very low temperature. Our data show the depinning threshold of\na Bragg-glass in a weakly disordered superconductor, a clean 2H-NbSe2 crystal.\nWe first experimentally capture the linear and collective response, the\nCampbell regime. Upon strong drives, the oscillating trajectories perform a\nseries of stick-slip motions that mimics the lattice periodicity. We then\ntheoretically elucidate this peculiar non-linear regime by solving the Langevin\ndynamics equations. We additionally explore the impact of initial conditions\nand reveal an enhancement of the long-range correlations with the cooling\nprocedure. Finally, our work establishes a connection between theory of vortex\npinning, memory effects and vortex lineshapes, thus offering a new platform to\ninvestigate the relationship between viscous media and individual controllable\nobjects in any many-body systems.\n", "  Quantum dots embedded in photonic nanostructures have in recent years proven\nto be a very powerful solid-state platform for quantum optics experiments. The\ncombination of near-unity radiative coupling of a single quantum dot to a\nphotonic mode and the ability to eliminate decoherence processes imply that an\nunprecedented light-matter interface can be obtained. As a result,\nhigh-cooperativity photon-emitter quantum interfaces can be constructed opening\na path-way to deterministic photonic quantum gates for quantum-information\nprocessing applications. In the present manuscript, I review current\nstate-of-the-art on quantum dot devices and their applications for quantum\ntechnology. The overarching long-term goal of the research field is to\nconstruct photonic quantum networks where remote entanglement can be\ndistributed over long distances by photons.\n", "  In this work has been proposed a numerical scheme with the aim of simulate\nthe coalescence process between water drops immersed in a continuous phase\n(n-heptane). This numerical scheme is based in the Finite Volume method and two\ndifferent values for the initial velocity of the drops were chosen. Depending\nof the initial velocity of collision some scenarios emerge, such as: permanent\ncoalescence, formation of satellite drops etc. For some snap shots the\nstreamlines are calculated for the different process of permanent coalescence.\nThese streamlines allow the understanding of the dynamics of the droplets\nimmersed on the n-heptane phase. The model used for the surface tension is\npresented and its effects on the dynamics of coalescence of the droplets are\nshowed, which after some time tends to the spherical form.\n", "  In this paper is described a numerical scheme that is used to simulate the\ncoalescence process between clusters of water drops immersed in a continuous\nhydrocarbon phase (n-heptane). Two different values for the initial velocity of\nthe drops were chosen. Depending of the initial velocity of collision some\nscenarios emerge, such as: permanent coalescence, formation of satellite drops\netc. For some snap shots the streamlines are calculated for the different\nprocess of permanent coalescence. These streamlines allow the understanding of\nthe dynamics of the droplets immersed on the n-heptane phase.\n", "  Radio Exploration of Planetary Habitability was the fifth in the series of\nAmerican Astronomical Society's Topical Conference Series. Notable aspects of\nthe conference included the interdisciplinary nature of both the topics and the\nintellectual breadth of the participants, the diversity of approaches to\nstudying this topic presented by recent discoveries and of the participants\nthemselves, the expanding meaning of the topic of \"star-planet interactions,\"\nand the expectation of an increasingly statistical approach to the topic.\nPotential areas of future research include the actual extent to which planetary\nmagnetic fields shield planetary atmospheres; the planetary dynamo process\nitself, particularly once multiple extrasolar planetary magnetic fields are\nconfirmed; and \"planet-star interactions.\" A major major topic of the\nconference concerned observational opportunities, highlighted by a number of\nnew or upcoming, specialized observatories to observe exoplanets especially at\nradio wavelengths. This article summarizes these main points of the conference\nand expands briefly upon these potential avenues for future investigation. A\nfuture meeting on this topic, given the variety of data sets being generated\nover the next few years, is warranted.\n", "  The description of large temporal graphs requires effective methods giving an\nappropriate mesoscopic partition. Many approaches exist today to detect\ncommunities in static graphs. However, many networks are intrinsically\ndynamical, and need a dynamic mesoscale description, as interpreting them as\nstatic networks would cause loss of important information. For example, dynamic\nprocesses such as the emergence of new scientific disciplines, their fusion,\nsplit or death need a mesoscopic description of the evolving network of\nscientific articles. There are two straightforward approaches to describe an\nevolving network using methods developed for static networks.\n  The first finds the community structure of the aggregated network; however,\nthis approach discards most temporal information, and may lead to inappropriate\ndescriptions, as very different dynamic data can give rise to the identical\nstatic graphs.\n  The opposite approach closely follows the evolutions and builds networks for\nsuccessive time slices by selecting the relevant nodes and edges, the\nmesoscopic structure of each of these slices is found independently and the\nstructures are connected to obtain a temporal description. By using an optimal\nstructural description at each time slice, this method avoids the inertia of\nthe aggregated approach. The inherent fuzziness of the communities leads to\nnoise and artifacts.\n  Here, we present an approach that distinguishes real trends and noise in the\nmesoscopic description of data using the continuity of social evolutions. To be\nfollow the dynamics, we compute partitions for each time slice, but to avoid\ntransients generated by noise, we modify the community description at time t\nusing the structures found at times t-1 and t+1. We show the relevance of our\nmethod on the analysis of a scientific network showing the birth of a new\nsubfield, wavelet analysis.\n", "  Employing the PHFB model, nuclear transition matrix elements $M^{\\left(\nK\\right) }$ for the neutrinoless double-$\\beta^{-} $ decay of $\\ ^{76}$Ge and\n$^{82}$Se isotopes are calculated within mechanisms involving light as well as\nheavy Majorana neutrinos, and classical Majorons by considering the spin-tensor\ndecomposition of realistic KUO and empirical JUN45 effective two-body\ninteraction. It is noticed that the effects due to the SRC on NTMEs $M^{\\left(\n0\\nu \\right) }$ and $M^{\\left( 0N\\right) }$ due to the exchange of light and\nheavy Majorana neutrinos, respectively, is maximally incorporated by the\ncentral part of the effective two-body interaction, which varies by a small\namount with the inclusion of spin-orbit and tensor components. The maximum\nuncertainty in the average NTMEs $\\overline{M}^{(0\\nu)}$ and\n$\\overline{M}^{(0N)}$ turns out to be about 10\\% and 37\\%, respectively.\n", "  The transient response of model hard sphere glasses is examined during the\napplication of steady rate start-up shear using Brownian Dynamics (BD)\nsimulations, experimental rheology and confocal microscopy. With increasing\nstrain the glass initially exhibits an almost linear elastic stress increase, a\nstress peak at the yield point and then reaches a constant steady state. The\nstress overshoot has a non-monotonic dependence with Peclet number, Pe, and\nvolume fraction, {\\phi}, determined by the available free volume and a\ncompetition between structural relaxation and shear advection. Examination of\nthe structural properties under shear revealed an increasing anisotropic radial\ndistribution function, g(r), mostly in the velocity - gradient (xy) plane,\nwhich decreases after the stress peak with considerable anisotropy remaining in\nthe steady-state. Low rates minimally distort the structure, while high rates\nshow distortion with signatures of transient elongation. As a mechanism of\nstoring energy, particles are trapped within a cage distorted more than\nBrownian relaxation allows, while at larger strains, stresses are relaxed as\nparticles are forced out of the cage due to advection. Even in the steady\nstate, intermediate super diffusion is observed at high rates and is a\nsignature of the continuous breaking and reformation of cages under shear.\n", "  Large ultra-sensitive detector arrays are needed for present and future\nobservatories for far infra-red, submillimeter wave (THz), and millimeter wave\nastronomy. With increasing array size, it is increasingly important to control\nstray radiation inside the detector chips themselves, the surface wave. We\ndemonstrate this effect with focal plane arrays of 880 lens-antenna coupled\nMicrowave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). Presented here are near field\nmeasurements of the MKID optical response versus the position on the array of a\nreimaged optical source. We demonstrate that the optical response of a detector\nin these arrays saturates off-pixel at the $\\sim-30$ dB level compared to the\npeak pixel response. The result is that the power detected from a point source\nat the pixel position is almost identical to the stray response integrated over\nthe chip area. With such a contribution, it would be impossible to measure\nextended sources, while the point source sensitivity is degraded due to an\nincrease of the stray loading. However, we show that by incorporating an\non-chip stray light absorber, the surface wave contribution is reduced by a\nfactor $>$10. With the on-chip stray light absorber the point source response\nis close to simulations down to the $\\sim-35$ dB level, the simulation based on\nan ideal Gaussian illumination of the optics. In addition, as a crosscheck we\nshow that the extended source response of a single pixel in the array with the\nabsorbing grid is in agreement with the integral of the point source\nmeasurements.\n", "  We study thermo-mechanical properties of matter at extreme conditions deep in\nthe supercritical state, at temperatures exceeding the critical one up to four\norders of magnitude. We calculate the Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameter {\\gamma} and find\nthat it decreases with temperature from 3 to 1 on isochores depending on the\ndensity. Our results indicate that from the perspective of thermo-mechanical\nproperties, the supercritical state is characterized by the wide range of\n{\\gamma} which includes the solid-like values - an interesting finding in view\nof the common perception of the supercritical state as being an intermediate\nstate between gases and liquids. We rationalize this result by considering the\nrelative weights of oscillatory and diffusive components of the supercritical\nsystem below the Frenkel line. We also find that {\\gamma} is nearly constant at\nthe Frenkel line above the critical point and explain this universality in\nterms of pressure and temperature scaling of system properties along the lines\nwhere particle dynamics changes qualitatively.\n", "  Localization-based imaging has revolutionized fluorescence optical microscopy\nand has also enabled unprecedented ultrasound images of microvascular\nstructures in deep tissues. Herein, we introduce a new concept of localization\noptoacoustic tomography (LOAT) that employs rapid sequential acquisition of\nthree-dimensional optoacoustic images from flowing absorbing particles. We show\nthat the new method enables breaking through the spatial resolution barrier of\nacoustic diffraction while further enhancing the visibility of structures under\nlimited-view tomographic conditions. Given the intrinsic sensitivity of\noptoacoustics to multiple hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters, LOAT may\nenable new level of performance in studying functional and anatomical\nalterations of microcirculation.\n", "  TOPCAT, the Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables, is an interactive\ndesktop application for retrieval, analysis and manipulation of tabular data,\noffering a powerful and flexible range of interactive visualization options\namongst other features. Its visualization capabilities focus on enabling\ninteractive exploration of large static local tables - millions of rows and\nhundreds of columns can easily be handled on a standard desktop or laptop\nmachine, and various options are provided for meaningful graphical\nrepresentation of such large datasets. TOPCAT has been developed in the context\nof astronomy, but many of its features are equally applicable to other domains.\nThe software, which is free and open source, is written in Java, and the\nunderlying high-performance visualisation library is suitable for re-use in\nother applications.\n", "  Matrix exponentiation (ME) is widely used in various fields of science and\nengineering. For example, the unitary dynamics of quantum systems is described\nby exponentiation of Hamiltonian operators. However, despite a significant\nattention, the numerical evaluation of ME remains computationally expensive,\nparticularly for large dimensions. Often this process becomes a bottleneck in\nalgorithms requiring iterative evaluation of ME. Here we propose a method for\napproximating ME of a single operator with a bounded coefficient into a product\nof certain discrete operators. This approach, which we refer to as Rapid\nExponentiation using Discrete Operators (REDO), is particularly efficient for\niterating ME over large numbers. We describe REDO in the context of a quantum\nsystem with a constant as well as a time-dependent Hamiltonian, although in\nprinciple, it can be adapted in a more general setting. As concrete examples,\nwe choose two applications. First, we incorporate REDO in optimal quantum\ncontrol algorithms and report a speed-up of several folds over a wide range of\nsystem size. Secondly, we propose REDO for numerical simulations of quantum\ndynamics. In particular, we study exotic quantum freezing with noisy drive\nfields.\n", "  In this article we address the general approach for calculating dynamical\ndipole polarizabilities of small quantum systems, based on a sum-over-states\nformula involving in principle the entire energy spectrum of the system. We\ncomplement this method by a few-parameter model involving a limited number of\neffective transitions, allowing for a compact and accurate representation of\nboth the isotropic and anisotropic components of the polarizability. We apply\nthe method to the series of ten heteronuclear molecules composed of two of\n($^7$Li,$^{23}$Na,$^{39}$K,$^{87}$Rb,$^{133}$Cs) alkali-metal atoms. We rely on\nboth up-to-date spectroscopically-determined potential energy curves for the\nlowest electronic states, and on our systematic studies of these systems\nperformed during the last decade for higher excited states and for permanent\nand transition dipole moments. Such a compilation is timely for the\ncontinuously growing researches on ultracold polar molecules. Indeed the\nknowledge of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities is crucial to model the\noptical response of molecules when trapped in optical lattices, and to\ndetermine optimal lattice frequencies ensuring optimal transfer to the absolute\nground state of initially weakly-bound molecules. When they exist, we determine\nthe so-called \"magic frequencies\" where the ac-Stark shift and thus the viewed\ntrap depth, is the same for both weakly-bound and ground-state molecules.\n", "  We investigate the optomechanical interaction between light and metallic\nnanowires through the action of bolometric forces. We show that the response\ntime of the photothermal forces induced on the nanowire is fast and the\nstrength of the interaction can overcome the radiation pressure force.\nFurthermore, we suggest the photothermal forces can be enhanced by surface\nplasmon excitation to cool the sub-megahertz vibrational modes of the nanowires\nclose to its quantum limit.\n", "  The importance of allowance for the time-dependent effect in the kinetics at\nthe photospheric phase during a supernova explosion has been confirmed by\nseveral independent research groups. The time-dependent effect provides a\nhigher degree of hydrogen ionization in comparison with the steady-state\nsolutions and strengthens the H$\\alpha$ line in the resulting simulated\nspectrum, with the intensity of the effect increasing with time. However, some\nresearchers argue that the time-dependent ionization effect is unimportant. Its\nallowance leads to an insignificant strengthening of H$\\alpha$ in their\nmodeling only in the first days after explosion. We have demonstrated the\nimportance of the time-dependent effect with the models of SN 1999em as an\nexample using the new original LEVELS software package. The role of a number of\nfactors that can weaken the time-dependent effect has been checked. We have\nconfirmed that the intensity of the effect is affected by the abundance of\nmetal admixtures in the envelope, while the addition of extra levels to\nthemodel hydrogen atom weakens the time-dependent effect to a lesser degree and\nnever removes it completely.\n", "  Weighted networks capture the structure of complex systems where interaction\nstrength is meaningful. This information is essential to a large number of\nprocesses, such as threshold dynamics, where link weights reflect the amount of\ninfluence that neighbours have in determining a node's behaviour. Despite\ndescribing numerous cascading phenomena, such as neural firing or social\ncontagion, threshold models have never been explicitly addressed on weighted\nnetworks. We fill this gap by studying a dynamical threshold model over\nsynthetic and real weighted networks with numerical and analytical tools. We\nshow that the time of cascade emergence depends non-monotonously on weight\nheterogeneities, which accelerate or decelerate the dynamics, and lead to\nnon-trivial parameter spaces for various networks and weight distributions. Our\nmethodology applies to arbitrary binary state processes and link properties,\nand may prove instrumental in understanding the role of edge heterogeneities in\nvarious natural and social phenomena.\n", "  It has been shown that in investigating the electromagnetic and meson fields\nof elementary particles, the effects of gravitational interaction cannot be\nneglected. The present note is an attempt to find solutions to the equations of\nthe general relativistic gravitational and scalar meson fields of a point\nnuclear charge. The solution is nonsingular at all points of the gravitational\nand meson fields. Although it contains several functions whose form is not\ngiven, this solution can be used to obtain the potential of the scalar meson\nfield, which is a generalization of the Yukawa potential; furthermore, it makes\nit possible to calculate the mass and self-energy of the nucleon, which turn\nout to be finite.\n", "  To obtain a generalized wave equation for a field in general covariant form,\none must define covariant differentiation of a generalized wave function\ndescribing particles with arbitrary spin. Gel'fand and Iaglom, Dirac, and Fierz\nand Pauli have studied the generalized wave equation in the special theory of\nrelativity. In this paper, the Gel'fand-Iaglom field equation was generalized\nto the curved space based on the veilbein framework. The general covariant\nfield equations for arbitrary spin were obtained. More importantly, in this\nwork, we introduced the gauge covariant derivative with the local Lorentz\ntransformation, which is the foundation for a gauge theory of gravitation.\n", "  Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films possess different chemical and physical\nproperties based on surface modification. The bond structure of pristine PDMS\nfilms and plasma treated PDMS films differ in a particular region of silicate\nbonds. We have studied the surface physical properties of pristine PDMS films\nand plasma treated PDMS films through optical technique. It is already known\nthat plasma treated PDMS films forms very thin SiO2 layer on its surface. Due\nto difference in coefficient of thermal expansion of the surface SiO2 and the\nremaining bulk layer, the SiO2 layer develops cracks. These formations are\nexplored to characterize PDMS surface by observing intensity of scattered light\nwhile the films are stretched. Pristine PDMS films do not show such optical\nscattering. Further the intensity measurements were repeated over period of\ntime to monitor surface properties with time. It was observed that plasma\ntreated PDMS film; the scattered light intensity is linearly dependent on the\napplied force for stretching. After a substantial time, scattering intensity is\nreduced to the value which is almost equal to that of pristine PDMS surface. It\nis proposed that basic light scattering through plasma treated PDMS occurs due\nto the decrease in the width of the cracks when the PDMS film is stretched. The\nchange in the scattering property of plasma treated PDMS surface over time\ncould be attributed to healing of cracks by the migration of polymer chain\nmolecules from the bulk to the surface. It is also reported that with reference\nto various bonds present on surface plasma treated PDMS surface regains its\noriginal properties as that of pristine PDMS with time. Therefore the optical\ntechnique could be employed to study surface characteristics of PDMS surface as\nan alternative approach to conventional spectroscopic techniques.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to present a study on the representations of\ncoordinate, momentum and dispersion operators in the framework of a phase space\nrepresentation of quantum mechanics that we have introduced and studied in\nprevious works. We begin in the introduction section with a recall about the\nconcept of representation of operators on wave function spaces. Then, we show\nthat in the case of the phase space representation the coordinate and momentum\noperators can be represented either with differential operators or with\nmatrices. The explicit expressions of both the differential operators and\nmatrices representations are established. Multidimensional generalization of\nthe obtained results are performed and phase space representation of dispersion\noperators are given.\n", "  Successive releases of Planck data have demonstrated the strength of the\nSunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ) effect in detecting hot baryons out to the galaxy\ncluster peripheries. To infer the hot gas pressure structure from nearby galaxy\nclusters to more distant objects, we developed a parametric method that models\nthe spectral energy distribution and spatial anisotropies of both the Galactic\nthermal dust and the Cosmic Microwave Background, that are mixed-up with the\ncluster SZ and dust signals. Taking advantage of the best angular resolution of\nthe High Frequency Instrument channels (5 arcmin) and using X-ray priors in the\ninnermost cluster regions that are not resolved with Planck, this modelling\nallowed us to analyze a sample of 61 nearby members of the Planck catalog of SZ\nsources ($0 < z < 0.5$, $\\tilde{z} = 0.15$) using the full mission data, as\nwell as to examine a distant sample of 23 clusters ($0.5 < z < 1$, $\\tilde{z} =\n0.56$) that have been recently followed-up with XMM-Newton and Chandra\nobservations. We find that (i) the average shape of the mass-scaled pressure\nprofiles agrees with results obtained by the Planck collaboration in the nearby\ncluster sample, and that (ii) no sign of evolution is discernible between\naveraged pressure profiles of the low- and high-redshift cluster samples. In\nline with theoretical predictions for these halo masses and redshift ranges,\nthe dispersion of individual profiles relative to a self-similar shape stays\nwell below 10 % inside $r_{500}$ but increases in the cluster outskirts.\n", "  We consider the problem of geometric optimisation of the lowest eigenvalue of\nthe Laplacian in the exterior of a compact set in any dimension, subject to\nattractive Robin boundary conditions.\n  As an improvement upon our previous work (arXiv:1608.04896, to appear in J.\nConvex Anal.), we show that under either a constraint of fixed perimeter or\narea, the maximiser within the class of exteriors of simply connected planar\nsets is always the exterior of a disk, without the need of convexity\nassumption. Moreover, we generalise the result to disconnected compact planar\nsets. Namely, we prove that under a constraint of fixed average value of the\nperimeter over all the connected components, the maximiser within the class of\ndisconnected compact planar sets, consisting of finitely many simply connected\ncomponents, is again a disk.\n  In higher dimensions, we prove a completely new result that the lowest point\nin the spectrum is maximised by the exterior of a ball among all sets exterior\nto bounded convex sets satisfying a constraint on the integral of a dimensional\npower of the mean curvature of their boundaries. Furthermore, it follows that\nthe critical coupling at which the lowest point in the spectrum becomes a\ndiscrete eigenvalue emerging from the essential spectrum is minimised under the\nsame constraint by the critical coupling for the exterior of a ball.\n", "  Motivated by the coincidence of topological entropies the connection between\nabelian sandpiles and harmonic models was established by K. Schmidt and E.\nVerbitskiy (2009). The dissipative sandpile models were shown to be symbolic\nrepresentations of algebraic $Z^d$-actions of the harmonic models. Both models\nare determined by so-called simple sandpile polynomials. We extend this result\nto arbitrary sandpile polynomials. Moreover, we show that any sandpile model\ndetermined by a factor of a sandpile polynomial acts as an equal entropy cover\nof the corresponding algebraic model. For a special class of factors these\ncovers are shown to be symbolic representations.\n", "  The decoherence of a two-state system coupled with a sub-Ohmic bath is\ninvestigated theoretically by means of the perturbation approach based on a\nunitary transformation. It is shown that the decoherence depends strongly and\nsensitively on the structure of environment. Nonadiabatic effect is treated\nthrough the introduction of a function $\\xi_k$ which depends on the boson\nfrequency and renormalized tunneling. The results are as follows:(1) the\nnon-equilibrium correlation function $P(t)$, the dynamical susceptibility\n$\\chi''(\\omega)$ and the equilibrium correlation function $C(t)$ are\nanalytically obtained for $s\\leq 1$; (2) the phase diagram of thermodynamic\ntransition shows the delocalized-localized transition point $\\alpha_l$ which\nagrees with exact results and numerical data from the Numerical Renormalization\nGroup; (3) the dynamical transition point $\\alpha_c$ between coherent and\nincoherent phase is explicitly given for the first time. A crossover from the\ncoherent oscillation to incoherent relaxation appears with increasing coupling\n(for $\\alpha > \\alpha_c $, the coherent dynamics disappear); (4) the Shiba's\nrelation and sum rule are exactly satisfied when $\\alpha \\leq \\alpha_c $; (5)\nan underdamping-overdamping transition point $\\alpha_c^{*}$ exists in the\nfunction $S(\\omega)$. Consequently, the dynamical phase diagrams in both ohmic\nand sub-Ohmic case are mapped out. For $\\Delta \\ll \\omega_c$, the critical\ncouplings ($\\alpha_l, \\alpha_c$ and $\\alpha_c^{*}$) are proportional to\n$\\Delta^{1-s}$.\n"]}
