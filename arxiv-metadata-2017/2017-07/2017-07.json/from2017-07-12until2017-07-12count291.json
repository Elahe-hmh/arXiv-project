Violations of this assumption have\nvariously been thought to suggest \"backward causation\", a \"conspiracy\" on the\npart of nature, or the denial of \"free will\". It will be shown here that these\nare spurious worries, and that denial of SI simply implies nonlocal correlation\nbetween spacelike degrees of freedom. Lorentz-invariant theories in which SI\ndoes not hold are easily constructed: two are exhibited here. It is\nconjectured, on this basis, that quantum-mechanical phenomena may be modeled by\na local theory after all.\n", "  We study the percolative properties of random interlacements on the product\nof G with the integer line Z, when G is a weighted graph satisfying certain\nsub-Gaussian estimates attached to the parameters alpha > 1, measuring the\nvolume growth on G, and beta between 2 and alpha + 1, measuring the\nsub-diffusive nature of the random walk on G. We develop decoupling\ninequalities, which are a key tool in showing that the critical level u_* for\nthe percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements is always finite in\nour set-up, and that it is positive when alpha \\geq 1 + beta/2. We also obtain\nseveral stretched exponential controls both in the percolative and\nnon-percolative phases of the model. Even in the case where G = Z^d, d \\geq 2,\nseveral of these results are new.\n", "  It is usually assumed that the \"$t$\" parameter in the equations of dynamics\ncan be identified with the indication of the pointer of a clock. Things are not\nso easy, however. In fact, since the equations of motion can be written in\nterms of $t$ but also of $t'=f(t)$, $f$ being any well behaved function, each\none of those infinite parametric times $t'$ is as good as the Newtonian one to\nstudy classical dynamics. Here we show that the relation between the\nmathematical parametric time $t$ in the equations of dynamics and the physical\ndynamical time $\\sigma$ that is measured with clocks is more complex and subtle\nthan usually assumed. These two times, therefore, must be carefully\ndistinguished since their difference may have significant consequences.\nFurthermore, we show that not all the dynamical clock-times are necessarily\nequivalent and that the observational fingerprint of this non-equivalence has\nthe same form as that of the Pioneer anomaly.\n", "  The invariants of rank 2 Joyce-Song semistable pairs over a Calabi-Yau\nthreefold were computed in arXiv:1101.2252, using the wall-crossing formula of\nJoyce-Song and Kontsevich-Soibelman. Such wall-crossing computations often\ndepend on the combinatorial properties of certain elements of a Hall-algebra\n(these are the stack functions defined by Joyce). These combinatorial\ncomputations become immediately complicated and hard to carry out, when\nstudying higher rank stable pairs with rank$>2$. The main purpose of this\narticle is to introduce an independent approach to computation of rank 2 stable\npair invariants, without applying the wallcrossing formula and rather by\nstratifying their corresponding moduli space and directly computing the\nweighted Euler characteristics of the strata. This approach may similarly be\nused to avoid complex combinatorial wallcrossing calculations in rank$>2$\ncases.\n", "  The BCS theory models electron correlations with pure zero-momentum pairs.\nHere we consider a family of pairing Hamiltonians, where the electron\ncorrelations are modelled with pure arbitrary-momentum pairs. We find all\nmodels in the family are exactly solvable, and present these solutions. It is\ninteresting to note that the $\\eta$ pair or the $d$ -wave pair condensate in\n$T_{c}$ superconductivity can be the ground state of a Hamiltonian in the\nfamily. These models are two-dimensional because only the z-component of the\ntotal electron spin $S_z$ is conserved. Significantly, for the $\\eta$ pair or\n$d$ -wave pairing model in the family we find an analytical expression of\nenergy and an abrupt ground state change from independent particle state to the\n$d$ -wave pair condensate, suggesting a quantum phase transition.\n", "  Theories that contain first class constraints possess gauge invariance which\nresults in the necessity of altering the measure in the associated quantum\nmechanical path integral. If the path integral is derived from the canonical\nstructure of the theory, then the choice of gauge conditions used in\nconstructing Faddeev's measure cannot be covariant. This shortcoming is\nnormally overcome either by using the \"Faddeev-Popov\" quantization procedure,\nor by the approach of Batalin-Fradkin-Fradkina-Vilkovisky, and then\ndemonstrating that these approaches are equivalent to the path integral\nconstructed from the canonical approach with Faddeev's measure. We propose in\nthis paper an alternate way of defining the measure for the path integral when\nit is constructed using the canonical procedure for theories containing first\nclass constraints and that this new approach can be used in conjunction with\ncovariant gauges. This procedure follows the Faddeev-Popov approach, but rather\nthan working with the form of the gauge transformation in configuration space,\nit employs the generator of the gauge transformation in phase space. We\ndemonstrate this approach to the path integral by applying it to Yang-Mills\ntheory, a spin-two field and the first order Einstein-Hilbert action in two\ndimensions. The problems associated with defining the measure for theories\ncontaining second-class constraints and ones in which there are fewer secondary\nfirst class constraints than primary first class constraints are discussed.\n", "  Blind Quantum Computing (BQC) allows a client to have a server carry out a\nquantum computation for them such that the client's input, output and\ncomputation remain private. A desirable property for any BQC protocol is\nverification, whereby the client can verify with high probability whether the\nserver has followed the instructions of the protocol, or if there has been some\ndeviation resulting in a corrupted output state. A verifiable BQC protocol can\nbe viewed as an interactive proof system leading to consequences for complexity\ntheory. The authors, together with Broadbent, previously proposed a universal\nand unconditionally secure BQC scheme where the client only needs to be able to\nprepare single qubits in separable states randomly chosen from a finite set and\nsend them to the server, who has the balance of the required quantum\ncomputational resources. In this paper we extend that protocol with new\nfunctionality allowing blind computational basis measurements, which we use to\nconstruct a new verifiable BQC protocol based on a new class of resource\nstates. We rigorously prove that the probability of failing to detect an\nincorrect output is exponentially small in a security parameter, while resource\noverhead remains polynomial in this parameter. The new resource state allows\nentangling gates to be performed between arbitrary pairs of logical qubits with\nonly constant overhead. This is a significant improvement on the original\nscheme, which required that all computations to be performed must first be put\ninto a nearest neighbour form, incurring linear overhead in the number of\nqubits. Such an improvement has important consequences for efficiency and\nfault-tolerance thresholds.\n", "  Seiberg-Witten theory can be embedded in F-theory using D3 branes probing an\norientifold geometry. The non-perturbative corrections in the orientifold\npicture map directly to the instanton corrections in the corresponding gauge\ntheory that convert the classical moduli space to the quantum one. In this\nshort review we argue that the recently proposed class of conformal Gaiotto\nmodels may also be embedded in F-theory. The F-theory constructions help us not\nonly to understand the Gaiotto dualities but also to extend to the\nnon-conformal cases with and without cascading behaviors. For the conformal\ncases, the near horizon geometries in F-theory capture both the UV and IR\nbehaviors succinctly.\n", "  We numerically investigated the entanglement product in the simplest coupled\nkicked top model with the spin $j=1$. Different from the dynamical pattern of\nentanglement in the semiclassical regime, two similar initial states may have\ndiscordant entanglement oscillations. A candidate of the quantum signature of\nthis classical chaotic system was proposed. The potential antimonotonic\nrelation between the rank correlation coefficient qualifying the concordant of\ntwo entanglement evolutions and the stationary entanglement was preliminarily\nrevealed.\n", "  The $B^0_s$ and $B^0$ mixing frequencies, $\\Delta m_s$ and $\\Delta m_d$, are\nmeasured using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0\nfb^{-1} collected by the LHCb experiment in $pp$ collisions at a centre of mass\nenergy of 7 TeV during 2011. Around 1.8x10^6 candidate events are selected of\nthe type $B^0_{(s)} \\to D^-_{(s)} \\mu^+$ (+ anything), where about half are\nfrom peaking and combinatorial backgrounds. To determine the B decay times, a\ncorrection is required for the momentum carried by missing particles, which is\nperformed using a simulation-based statistical method. Associated production of\nmuons or mesons allows us to tag the initial-state flavour and so to resolve\noscillations due to mixing. We obtain \\Delta m_s = (17.93 \\pm 0.22 (stat) \\pm\n0.15 (syst)) ps^{-1}, \\Delta m_d = (0.503 \\pm 0.011 (stat) \\pm 0.013 (syst))\nps^{-1}. The hypothesis of no oscillations is rejected by the equivalent of 5.8\nstandard deviations for $B^0_s$ and 13.0 standard deviations for $B^0$. This is\nthe first observation of $B^0_s$ mixing to be made using only semileptonic\ndecays.\n", "  We study Pandharipande-Thomas's stable pair theory on $K3$ fibrations over\ncurves with possibly nodal fibers. We describe stable pair invariants of the\nfiberwise irreducible curve classes in terms of Kawai-Yoshioka's formula for\nthe Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of stable pairs on $K3$ surfaces and\nNoether-Lefschetz numbers of the fibration. Moreover, we investigate the\nrelation of these invariants with the perverse (non-commutative) stable pair\ninvariants of the $K3$ fibration. In the case that the $K3$ fibration is a\nprojective Calabi-Yau threefold, by means of wall-crossing techniques, we write\nthe stable pair invariants in terms of the generalized Donaldson-Thomas\ninvariants of 2-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves supported on the\nfibers.\n", "  The low luminosity QSO (LLQSO) sample consists of type 1 active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) up to a redshift of z=0.06 in the Hamburg/ESO QSO survey. Its\npurpose is to study how the brightest AGN in the nearby universe evolve with\nrespect to AGN activity and host properties as a function of redshift. We show\nthat our sample lies well between the NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) sample and the\nPalomar Green (PG) QSO sample in terms of redshift, gas masses and luminosities\nand seems to connect them. The continuous growth in mass, luminosity and,\nlinked to this, the AGN activity over the samples has either a statistical\nreason or is indicative of an evolutionary link between the different\npopulations and might be related to cosmic downsizing. In addition, we present\nfirst results of our observations of three galaxies from our sample with the\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA).\n", "  We present a novel technique to obtain relativistic corrections to the\ncentral force problem in the Lagrangian formulation, using a generalized\npotential energy function. We derive a general expression for a generalized\npotential energy function for all powers of the velocity, which when made a\npart of the regular classical Lagrangian can reproduce the correct\n(relativistic) force equation. We then go on to derive the Hamiltonian and\nestimate the corrections to the total energy of the system up to the fourth\npower in $|\\vec{v}|/c$. We found that our work is able to provide a more\ncomprehensive understanding of relativistic corrections to the central force\nresults and provides corrections to both the kinetic and potential energy of\nthe system. We employ our methodology to calculate relativistic corrections to\nthe circular orbit under the gravitational force and also the first-order\ncorrections to the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom using a\nsemi-classical approach. Our predictions in both problems give reasonable\nagreement with the known results. Thus we feel that this work has pedagogical\nvalue and can be used by undergraduate students to better understand the\ncentral force and the relativistic corrections to it.\n", "  In this paper we present a first order formulation for non-extremal Anti-de\nSitter black hole solutions in four dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ U(1)-gauged\nSupergravity. The dynamics is determined in terms of a quantity $\\mathcal{W}$\nwhich plays the role of a superpotential for the gauging potential in the\naction. We show how the first order flow arises from writing the action as a\nsum of squares and we identify the superpotential driving the first order flow\nfor two classes of solutions (electric and magnetic) of the $t^3$ model. After\nidentifying $\\mathcal{W}$, we study the Hamilton-Jacobi holographic\nrenormalization procedure in presence of mixed boundary conditions for the\nscalar fields. We compute the renormalized on-shell action and the mass of the\nblack hole configurations. The expression obtained for the mass satisfies the\nfirst law of thermodynamics.\n", "  We present a computational approach to general hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces\nin Weierstrass normal form. The surface is either given by a list of the branch\npoints, the coefficients of the defining polynomial or a system of cuts for the\ncurve. A canonical basis of the homology is introduced algorithmically for this\ncurve. The periods of the holomorphic differentials and the Abel map are\ncomputed with the Clenshaw-Curtis method in order to achieve spectral accuracy.\nThe code can handle almost degenerate Riemann surfaces. This work generalizes\nprevious work on real hyperelliptic surfaces with prescribed cuts to arbitrary\nhyperelliptic surfaces. As an example, solutions to the sine-Gordon equation in\nterms of multi-dimensional theta functions are studied, also in the solitonic\nlimit of these solutions.\n", "  We study the dynamical interactions of mass systems in equilibrium under\ntheir own gravity that mutually exert and experience gravitational forces. The\nmethod we employ is to model the dynamical evolution of two isolated bars,\nhosted within the same galactic system, under their mutual gravitational\ninteraction. In this study we present an analytical treatment of the secular\nevolution of two bars that oscillate with respect one another. Two cases of\ninteraction, with and without geometrical deformation, are discussed. In the\nlatter case, the bars are described as modified Jacobi ellipsoids. These\ntriaxial systems are formed by a rotating fluid mass in gravitational\nequilibrium with its own rotational velocity and the gravitational field of the\nother bar. The governing equation for the variation of their relative angular\nseparation is then numerically integrated, which also provides the time\nevolution of the geometrical parameters of the bodies. The case of rigid,\nnon-deformable, bars produces in some cases an oscillatory motion in the bodies\nsimilar to that of a harmonic oscillator. For the other case, a deformable\nrotating body that can be represented by a modified Jacobi ellipsoid under the\ninfluence of an exterior massive body will change its rotational velocity to\nescape from the attracting body, just as if the gravitational torque exerted by\nthe exterior body were of opposite sign. Instead, the exchange of angular\nmomentum will cause the Jacobian body to modify its geometry by enlarging its\nlong axis, located in the plane of rotation, thus decreasing its axial ratios.\n", "  Controlling quantum fluids at their fundamental length scale will yield\nsuperlative quantum simulators, precision sensors, and spintronic devices. This\nscale is typically below the optical diffraction limit, precluding precise\nwavefunction engineering using optical potentials alone. We present a protocol\nto rapidly control the phase and density of a quantum fluid down to the healing\nlength scale using strong time-dependent coupling between internal states of\nthe fluid in a magnetic field gradient. We demonstrate this protocol by\nsimulating the creation of a single stationary soliton and double soliton\nstates in a Bose-Einstein condensate with control over the individual soliton\npositions and trajectories, using experimentally feasible parameters. Such\nstates are yet to be realized experimentally, and are a path towards\nengineering soliton gases and exotic topological excitations.\n", "  We design a quantum molecular dynamics method for strongly correlated\nelectron metals. The strong electronic correlation effects are treated within a\nreal-space version of the Gutzwiller variational approximation (GA), which is\nsuitable for the inhomogeneity inherent in the process of quantum molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulation. We also propose an efficient algorithm based on the\nsecond-moment approximation to the electronic density of states for the search\nof the optimal variation parameters, from which the effective renormalized\ninteratomic MD potentials are fully determined. By considering a minimal\none-correlated-orbital Anderson many-particle model based on tight-binding\nhopping integrals, this fast GA-MD method is benchmarked with that using exact\ndiagonalization to solve the GA variational parameters. In the infinite damping\nlimit, the efficiency and accuracy are illustrated. This novel method will open\nup an unprecedented opportunity enabling large-scale quantum MD simulations of\nstrongly correlated electronic materials.\n", "  Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate numerical quantities\nwhich are hard to compute deterministically. One important example is the use\nin statistical physics of rapidly mixing Markov chains to approximately compute\npartition functions. In this work we describe a quantum algorithm which can\naccelerate Monte Carlo methods in a very general setting. The algorithm\nestimates the expected output value of an arbitrary randomised or quantum\nsubroutine with bounded variance, achieving a near-quadratic speedup over the\nbest possible classical algorithm. Combining the algorithm with the use of\nquantum walks gives a quantum speedup of the fastest known classical algorithms\nwith rigorous performance bounds for computing partition functions, which use\nmultiple-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. The quantum algorithm can\nalso be used to estimate the total variation distance between probability\ndistributions efficiently.\n", "  Quantum states of strongly correlated electrons are of prime importance to\nunderstand exotic properties of condensed matter systems and the\ncontrollability over those states promises unique electronic devices such as a\nMott memory. As a recent example, a ultrafast switching device was demonstrated\nusing the transition between the correlated Mott insulating state and a\nhidden-order metallic state of a layered transition metal dichalcogenides\n1T-TaS2. However, the origin of the hidden metallic state was not clear and\nonly the macroscopic switching by laser pulse and carrier injection was\nreported. Here, we demonstrate the nanoscale manipulation of the Mott\ninsulating state of 1T-TaS2. The electron pulse from a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope switches the insulating phase locally into a metallic phase which is\ntextured with irregular domain walls in the charge density wave (CDW) order\ninherent to this Mott state. The metallic state is a novel correlated phase\nnear the Mott criticality with a coherent feature at the Fermi energy, which is\ninduced by the moderate reduction of electron correlation due to the\ndecoherence in CDW. This work paves the avenue toward novel nanoscale\nelectronic devices based on correlated electrons.\n", "  We investigate the interplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon\ninteractions in the electronic structure of an exotic insulating state in the\nlayered dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, where the charge-density-wave (CDW) order\ncoexists with a Mott correlation gap. Scanning tunneling microscopy and\nspectroscopy measurements with high spatial and energy resolution determine\nunambiguously the CDW and the Mott gap as 0.20-0.24 eV and 0.32 eV,\nrespectively, through the real space electron phases measured across the\nmultiply formed energy gaps. An unusual local reduction of the Mott gap is\nobserved on the defect site, which indicates the renormalization of the on-site\nCoulomb interaction by the electron-phonon coupling as predicted by the\nHubbard-Holstein model. The Mott-gap renormalization provides new insight into\nthe disorder-induced quasi-metallic phases of 1T-TaS2.\n", "  We calculate one loop contributions to $\\Gamma(h \\rightarrow \\gamma \\,\n\\gamma)$ from higher dimensional operators, in the Standard Model Effective\nField Theory (SMEFT). Some technical challenges related to determining\nElectroweak one loop \"finite terms\" are discussed and overcome. Although we\nrestrict our attention to $\\Gamma(h \\rightarrow \\gamma \\, \\gamma)$, several\ndevelopments we report have broad implications. Firstly, the running of the\nvacuum expectation value modifies the $\\log(\\mu)$ dependence of processes in a\nmanner that is not captured in some past SMEFT Renormalization Group (RG)\ncalculations. Secondly, higher dimensional operators can source ghost\ninteractions in $R_\\xi$ gauges due to a modified gauge fixing procedure.\nLastly, higher dimensional operators can contribute with pure finite terms at\none loop in a manner that is not anticipated in a RG analysis. These results\ncast recent speculation on the nature of one loop corrections in the SMEFT in\nan entirely new light.\n", "  A two component nonlocal vector nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (VNLSE) is\nconsidered with a self-induced $ {\\cal PT}$ symmetric potential. It is shown\nthat the system possess a Lax pair and an infinite number of conserved\nquantities and hence integrable. Some of the conserved quantities like number\noperator, Hamiltonian etc. are found to be real-valued, in spite of these\ncharges being non-hermitian. The soliton solution for the same equation is\nobtained through the method of inverse scattering transformation and the\ncondition of reduction from nonlocal to local case is also mentioned. An\ninhomogeneous version of this VNLSE with space -time modulated nonlinear\ninteraction term is also considered and a mapping of this Eq. with standard\nVNLSE through similarity transformation is used to generate its solutions.\n", "  The installation and operation of a telescope in Antarctica represent\nparticular challenges, in particular the requirement to operate at extremely\ncold temperatures, to cope with rapid temperature fluctuations and to prevent\nfrosting. Heating of electronic subsystems is a necessity, but solutions must\nbe found to avoid the turbulence induced by temperature fluctua- tions on the\noptical paths. ASTEP 400 is a 40 cm Newton telescope installed at the Concordia\nstation, Dome C since 2010 for photometric observations of fields of stars and\ntheir exoplanets. While the telescope is designed to spread star light on\nseveral pixels to maximize photometric stability, we show that it is\nnonetheless sensitive to the extreme variations of the seeing at the ground\nlevel (between about 0.1 and 5 arcsec) and to temperature fluctuations between\n--30 degrees C and --80 degrees C. We analyze both day-time and night-time\nobservations and obtain the magnitude of the seeing caused by the mirrors, dome\nand camera. The most important effect arises from the heating of the primary\nmirror which gives rise to a mirror seeing of 0.23 arcsec K--1 . We propose\nsolutions to mitigate these effects.\n", "  In this manuscript, wave attributes of hot plasma around Reissner-\nN\u007fordstrom-de Sitter (RN-dS) metric in a Veselago medium are in- vestigated.\nGeneral relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) equations in planar\ncoordinates for the RN-dS horizon are reformulated by implementation of ADM 3+1\ntechnique. Further, perturba- tion scheme is used to arrive at linearly\nperturbed GRMHD equations whose component form is used to attain dispersion\nrelations for rotating (non-magnetized and magnetized) plasma. Wave propagation\nin hot plasma is explained by three dimensional graphical representation of the\nwave number, refractive index, its change with respect to angular velocity,\nphase and group velocities. Finally, comparison of wave properties is\npresented, results reassert the presence of Veselago medium.\n", "  In this work we analytically investigate the longitudinal optical\nconductivity of the C$_{2v}$ symmetric topological insulator. The conductivity\nexpressions at $ T = 0 $ are derived using the Kubo formula and expressed as a\nfunction of the ratio of the Dresselhaus and Rashba parameters that\ncharacterize the low-energy Hamiltonian. We find that the longitudinal\ninter-band conductivity vanishes when Dresselhaus and Rashba parameters are\nequal in strength, also called the persistent spin helix state. The\ncalculations are extended to obtain the frequency-dependent real and imaginary\ncomponents of the optical conductivity for the topological Kondo insulator\nSmB$_{6}$ which exhibits C$_{2v}$ symmetric and anisotropic Dirac cones hosting\ntopological states at the $ \\bar{X} $ point on the surface Brillouin zone.\n", "  Broad absorption line quasars are among the objects presenting the fastest\noutflows. The launching mechanism itself is not completely understood. Models\nin which they could be launched from the accretion disk, and then curved and\naccelerated by the effect of the radiation pressure, have been presented. We\nconducted an extensive observational campaign, from radio to optical band, to\ncollect information about their nature and test the models present in the\nliterature, the main dichotomy being between a young scenario and an\norientation one. We found a variety of possible orientations, morphologies, and\nradio ages, not converging to a particular explanation for the BAL phenomenon.\nFrom our latest observations in the m- and mm-band, we obtained an indication\nof a lower dust abundance with respect to normal quasars, thus suggesting a\npossible feedback process on the host galaxy. Also, in the low-frequency regime\nwe confirmed the presence of CSS components, sometime in conjunction with a GPS\none already detected at higher frequencies. Following this, about 70% of our\nsample turns out to be in a GPS or CSS+GPS phase. We conclude that fast\noutflows, responsible for the BAL features, can be more easily present among\nobjects going through a restarting or just-started radio phase, where radiation\npressure can substantially contribute to their acceleration.\n", "  We present accurate measurements of carrier-envelope phase effects on\nionisation of the noble gases with few-cycle laser pulses. The experimental\napparatus is calibrated by using atomic hydrogen data to remove any systematic\noffsets and thereby obtain accurate CEP data on other generally used noble\ngases such as Ar, Kr and Xe. Experimental results for H are well supported by\nexact TDSE theoretical simulations however significant differences are observed\nin case of noble gases.\n", "  We consider long-wave phonon-polaritons and longitudinal optical phonons in\nalkali-halide ionic crystals. The model of point charges that are polarized in\nthe self-consistent electromagnetic field in a dielectric environment is used.\nThe standard dispersion laws for both branches of phonon-polaritons and\nlongitudinal optical phonons are obtained. The transversal optical phonon\nfrequency is found from the electrostatic equilibrium condition. It is proved\nby comparison with tabular data that the found frequency coincides with the ion\nplasma frequency multiplied on the relation\n$\\sqrt{(\\varepsilon_{\\infty}+2)/(3(\\varepsilon_0-\\varepsilon_\\infty))},$ where\n$\\varepsilon_{\\infty}$ and $\\varepsilon_0$ are the high-frequency dielectric\nconstant and the static one respectively.\n", "  Coherent spatial transport or shuttling of a single electron spin through\nsemiconductor nanostructures is an important ingredient in many spintronic and\nquantum computing applications. In this work we analyze the possible errors in\nsolid-state quantum computation due to leakage in transporting a single-spin\nqubit through a semiconductor double quantum dot. In particular, we consider\nthree possible sources of leakage errors associated with such transport: finite\nramping times, spin-dependent tunneling rates between quantum dots induced by\nfinite spin-orbit couplings, and the presence of multiple valley states. In\neach case we present quantitative estimates of the leakage errors, and discuss\nhow they can be minimized. Moreover, we show that in order to minimize leakage\nerrors induced by spin-dependent tunnelings, it is necessary to apply pulses to\nperform certain carefully designed spin rotations. We further develop a\nformalism that allows one to systematically derive constraints on the pulse\nshapes and present a few examples to highlight the advantage of such an\napproach.\n", "  We report serendipitous detections of line emission with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 3, 6, and 7 in the central parsec\ndown to within 1\" around Sgr A* at an up to now highest resolution (<0.5\") view\nof the Galactic Center (GC) in the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) domain. From the 100\nGHz continuum and the H39\\alpha emission we obtain a uniform electron\ntemperature around 6000 K for the minispiral. The spectral index of Sgr A* is ~\n0.5 at 100 - 250 GHz and ~ 0.0 at 230 - 340 GHz. The bright sources in the\ncenter show spectral indices around -0.1 implying Bremsstrahlung emission,\nwhile dust emission is emerging in the minispiral exterior. Apart from CS,\nwhich is most widespread in the center, H13CO+, HC3N, SiO, SO, C2H, CH3OH, 13CS\nand N2H+ are also detected. The bulk of the clumpy emission regions is at\npositive velocities and in a region confined by the minispiral northern arm,\nbar and the sources IRS 3 and 7. Although partly spatially overlapping with the\nradio recombination line (RRL) emission at same negative velocities, the\nrelation to the minispiral remains unclear. A likely explanation is an\ninfalling clump consisting of denser cloud cores embedded in diffuse gas. The\ncentral association of clouds (CA) shows three times higher CS/X (X: any other\nobserved molecule) ratios than the circumnuclear disk (CND) suggesting a\ncombination of higher excitation, by a temperature gradient and/or IR-pumping,\nand abundance enhancement due to UV- and/or X-ray emission. Hence, we conclude\nthat this CA is closer to the center than the CND is to the center. Moreover,\nwe find molecular emission at velocities up to 200 km s-1. ...\n", "  We explore a new connection between Seiberg-Witten theory and quantum\nstatistical systems by relating the dual partition function of SU(2) Super\nYang-Mills theory in a self-dual Omega-background to the spectral determinant\nof an ideal Fermi gas. We show that the spectrum of this gas is encoded in the\nzeroes of the Painleve III tau function. In addition we find that the Nekrasov\npartition function on this background can be expressed as an O(2) matrix model.\nOur construction arises as a four-dimensional limit of a recently proposed\nconjecture relating topological strings and spectral theory. In this limit, we\nprovide a mathematical proof of the conjecture for the local P1xP1 geometry.\n", "  We investigate the statistics of the first detected passage time of a quantum\nwalk. The postulates of quantum theory, in particular the collapse of the wave\nfunction upon measurement, reveal an intimate connection between the wave\nfunction of a process free of measurements, i.e. the solution of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, and the statistics of first detection events on a site.\nFor stroboscopic measurements a quantum renewal equation yields basic\nproperties of quantum walks. For example, for a tight binding model on a ring\nwe discover critical sampling times, diverging quantities such as the mean time\nfor first detection, and an optimal detection rate. For a quantum walk on an\ninfinite line the probability of first detection decays like\n$(\\mbox{time})^{-3}$ with a superimposed oscillation, critical behavior for a\nspecific choice of sampling time, and vanishing amplitude when the sampling\ntime approaches zero due to the quantum Zeno effect.\n", "  Optical communication channels are ultimately quantum-mechanical in nature,\nand we must therefore look beyond classical information theory to determine\ntheir communication capacity as well as to find efficient encoding and decoding\nschemes of the highest rates. Thermal channels, which arise from linear\ncoupling of the field to a thermal environment, are of particular practical\nrelevance; their classical capacity has been recently established, but their\nquantum capacity remains unknown. While the capacity sets the ultimate limit on\nreliable communication rates, it does not promise that such rates are\nachievable by practical means. Here we construct efficiently encodable codes\nfor thermal channels which achieve the classical capacity and the so-called\nGaussian coherent information for transmission of classical and quantum\ninformation, respectively. Our codes are based on combining polar codes with a\ndiscretization of the channel input into a finite \"constellation\" of coherent\nstates. Encoding of classical information can be done using linear optics.\n", "  We investigate critical behaviors of a social contagion model on weighted\nnetworks. An edge-weight compartmental approach is applied to analyze the\nweighted social contagion on strongly heterogenous networks with skewed degree\nand weight distributions. We find that degree heterogeneity can not only alter\nthe nature of contagion transition from discontinuous to continuous but also\ncan enhance or hamper the size of adoption, depending on the unit transmission\nprobability. We also show that, the heterogeneity of weight distribution always\nhinder social contagions, and does not alter the transition type.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behaviors of stochastic cell fate decision between\nproliferation and differentiation. We propose a model of a self-replicating\nLangevin system, where cells choose their fate (i.e. proliferation or\ndifferentiation) depending on local cell density. Based on this model, we\npropose a scenario for multi-cellular organisms to maintain the density of\ncells (i.e., homeostasis) through finite-ranged cell-cell interactions.\nFurthermore, we numerically show that the distribution of the number of\ndescendant cells changes over time, thus unifying the previously proposed two\nmodels regarding homeostasis: the critical birth death process and the voter\nmodel. Our results provide a general platform for the study of stochastic cell\nfate decision in terms of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.\n", "  We introduced fermionic variables in complex modules over real Clifford\nalgebras of even dimension which are analog of the Witt basis. We built\nprimitive idempotents which are a set of equivalent Clifford vacuums. It is\nshown that the modules are decomposed into direct sum of minimal left ideals\ngenerated by these idempotents and that the fermionic variables can be\nconsidered as more fundamental mathematical objects than spinors.\n", "  The extreme magnetoelectric medium (EME medium) is defined in terms of two\nmedium dyadics, $\\alpha$, producing electric polarization by the magnetic field\nand $\\beta$, producing magnetic polarization by the electric field. Plane-wave\npropagation of time-harmonic fields of fixed finite frequency in the EME medium\nis studied. It is shown that (if $\\omega\\neq 0$) the dispersion equation has a\ncubic and homogeneous form, whence the wave vector $k$ is either zero or has\narbitrary magnitude. In many cases there is no dispersion equation (\"NDE\nmedium\") to restrict the wave vector in an EME medium. Attention is paid to the\ncase where the two medium dyadics have the same set of eigenvectors. In such a\ncase the $k$ vector is restricted to three eigenplanes defined by the medium\ndyadics. The emergence of such a result is demonstrated by considering a more\nregular medium, and taking the limit of zero permittivity and permeability. The\nspecial case of uniaxial EME medium is studied in detail. It is shown that an\ninterface of a uniaxial EME medium appears as a DB boundary when the axis of\nthe medium is normal to the interface. More in general, EME media display\ninteresting wave effects that can potentially be realized through metasurface\nengineering.\n", "  The ability to perfectly guide surface electromagnetic waves around\nultra-sharp corners without back-scattering and radiation is in great demand\nfor various photonic and plasmonic applications. This is fundamentally\ndifficult to realize because of the dramatic momentum mismatch and wave nature\nof radiation at the sharp corners. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a\nsimple photonic structure, a periodic square array of metallic cylinders\nstanding on a metal surface, can behaves as a surface-wave photonic crystal\nwith complete photonic band gap to overcome this bottleneck simply. A\nline-defect waveguide can support and guide surface waves around ultra-sharp\ncorners without perceptible radiation and reflection, achieving almost perfect\ntransmission efficiency in a broad frequency range. We also demonstrate an\nideal T-shaped splitter to split input surface waves equally into two arms and\na square radiation-suppressed plasmonic open resonator with high quality\nfactors by simply inducing line-defects in this fully open surface-wave\nphotonic crystal.\n", "  A novel algorithm is provided to couple a Galilean invariant model with\ncurved spatial background by taking nonrelativistic limit of a unique minimally\ncoupled relativistic theory, which ensures Galilean symmetry in the flat limit\nand canonical transformation of the original fields. That the twin requirements\nare fulfilled is ensured by a new field, the existence of which was\ndemonstrated recently from Galilean gauge theory. The ambiguities and anomalies\nconcerning the recovery of Galilean symmetry in the flat limit of spatial non\nrelativistic diffeomorphic theories, reported in the literature, are focused\nand resolved from a new angle.\n", "  Quantum computing promises significant speed-up for certain types of\ncomputational problems. However, robust implementations of semiconducting\nqubits must overcome the effects of charge noise that currently limit coherence\nduring gate operations. Here we describe a scheme for protecting solid-state\nqubits from uniform electric field fluctuations by generalizing the concept of\na decoherence-free subspace for spins, and we propose a specific physical\nimplementation: a quadrupole charge qubit formed in a triple quantum dot. The\nunique design of the quadrupole qubit enables a particularly simple pulse\nsequence for suppressing the effects of noise during gate operations.\nSimulations yield gate fidelities 10-1,000 times better than traditional charge\nqubits, depending on the magnitude of the environmental noise. Our results\nsuggest that any qubit scheme employing Coulomb interactions (for example,\nencoded spin qubits or two-qubit gates) could benefit from such a quadrupolar\ndesign.\n", "  We determine the cost of performing Shor's algorithm for integer\nfactorization on a ternary quantum computer, using two natural models of\nuniversal fault-tolerant computing:\n  (i) a model based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability\nof the ternary Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control as\nits natural instrumentation set; (ii) a model based on a metaplectic\ntopological quantum computer (MTQC). A natural choice to implement Shor's\nalgorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic\ninto a ternary form. However, it is also possible to emulate the standard\nbinary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three-level system.\nWe compare the two approaches and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's\nperiod finding function in the two models. We also highlight the fact that the\ncost of achieving universality through magic states in MTQC architecture is\nasymptotically lower than in generic ternary case.\n", "  We study the single electron spectra from $D-$ and $B-$meson semileptonic\ndecays in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$200, 62.4, and 19.2 GeV by\nemploying the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach that has\nbeen shown to reasonably describe the charm dynamics at RHIC and LHC energies\non a microscopic level. In this approach the initial heavy quarks are produced\nby using the PYTHIA which is tuned to reproduce the FONLL calculations. The\nproduced heavy quarks interact with off-shell massive partons in QGP with\nscattering cross sections which are calculated in the dynamical quasi-particle\nmodel (DQPM). At energy densities close to the critical energy density the\nheavy quarks are hadronized into heavy mesons through either coalescence or\nfragmentation. After hadronization the heavy mesons interact with the light\nhadrons by employing the scattering cross sections from an effective\nLagrangian. The final heavy mesons then produce single electrons through\nsemileptonic decay. We find that the PHSD approach well describes the nuclear\nmodification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ of single electrons in\nd+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$ 200 GeV and the elliptic flow\nin Au+Au reactions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$ 62.4 GeV from the PHENIX\ncollaboration, however, the large $R_{\\rm AA}$ at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$ 62.4 GeV\nis not described at all. Furthermore, we make predictions for the $R_{\\rm AA}$\nof $D-$mesons and of single electrons at the lower energy of $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=$ 19.2 GeV. Additionally, the medium modification of the azimuthal angle\n$\\phi$ between a heavy quark and a heavy antiquark is studied. We find that the\ntransverse flow enhances the azimuthal angular distributions close to $\\phi=$ 0\nbecause the heavy flavors strongly interact with nuclear medium in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions and almost flow with the bulk matter.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) electrides are a new concept material in which anionic\nelectrons are confined in the interlayer space between positively charged\nlayers. We have performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nmeasurements on Y$_2$C, which is a possible 2D electride, in order to verify\nthe formation of 2D electride states in Y$_2$C. We clearly observe the\nexistence of semimetallic \"electride bands\" near the Fermi level, as predicted\nby ${ab}$ ${initio}$ calculations, conclusively demonstrating that Y$_2$C is a\nquasi-2D electride with electride bands derived from interlayer anionic\nelectrons.\n", "  Using the sensitivity of magneto-induced second harmonic generation to spin\ncurrents (SC), we demonstrate in Fe/Au/Fe/MgO(001) pseudo spin valves the\ngeneration of 250 fs-long SC pulses. Their temporal profile indicates that\nsuperdiffusive hot electron transport across a sub-100~nm Au layer is close to\nthe ballistic limit and the pulse duration is primarily determined by the\nthermalization time of laser-excited hot carriers in Fe. Considering the\ncalculated spin-dependent Fe/Au interface transmittance we conclude that a\nnon-thermal spin-dependent Seebeck effect is responsible for the generation of\nultrashort SC pulses. We also show that hot electron spins rotate upon\ninteraction with non-collinear magnetization at the Au/Fe interface, which\nholds high potential for future spintronic devices.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of two-component vector solitons, namely\nbright-in-dark solitons, via the variational approximation in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. The system is described by a vector nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation appropriate to multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The\nvariational approximation is based on hyperbolic secant (hyperbolic tangent)\nfor the bright (dark) component, which leads to a system of coupled ordinary\ndifferential equations for the evolution of the ansatz parameters. We obtain\nthe oscillation dynamics of two-component dark-bright vector solitons.\nAnalytical calculations are performed for same-width components in the vector\nsoliton and numerical calculations extend the results to arbitrary widths. We\ncalculate the binding energy of the system and find it proportional to the\nintercomponent coupling interaction, and numerically demonstrate the break up\nor unbinding of a dark-bright soliton. Our calculations explore observable\neigenmodes, namely the internal oscillation eigenmode and the Goldstone\neigenmode. We find analytically that the density of the bright component is\nrequired to be less than the density of the dark component in order to find the\ninternal oscillation eigenmode of the vector soliton and support the existence\nof the dark-bright soliton. This outcome is confirmed by numerical results.\nNumerically, we find that the oscillation frequency is amplitude independent.\nFor dark-bright vector solitons in $^{87}$Rb we find that the oscillation\nfrequency range is 90 to 405 Hz, and therefore observable in multi-component\nBEC experiments.\n", "  We develop a quantum theory describing the input-output properties of\nJosephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers. This allows us to show how such\na device can be used as a source of nonclassical radiation, and how dispersion\nengineering can be used to tailor gain profiles and squeezing spectra with\nattractive properties, ranging from genuinely broadband spectra to \"squeezing\ncombs\" consisting of a number of discrete entangled quasimodes. The device's\noutput field can be used to generate a multi-mode squeezed bath--a powerful\nresource for dissipative quantum state preparation. In particular, we show how\nit can be used to generate continuous variable cluster states that are\nuniversal for measurement based quantum computing. The favourable scaling\nproperties of the preparation scheme makes it a promising path towards\ncontinuous variable quantum computing in the microwave regime.\n", "  We report the experimental evidence of the existence of a random attractor in\na fully developed turbulent swirling flow. By defining a global observable\nwhich tracks the asymmetry in the flux of angular momentum imparted to the\nflow, we can first reconstruct the associated turbulent attractor and then\nfollow its route towards chaos. We further show that the experimental attractor\ncan be modeled by stochastic Duffing equations, that match the quantitative\nproperties of the experimental flow, namely the number of quasi-stationary\nstates and transition rates among them, the effective dimensions, and the\ncontinuity of the first Lyapunov exponents. Such properties can neither be\nrecovered using deterministic models nor using stochastic differential\nequations based on effective potentials obtained by inverting the probability\ndistributions of the experimental global observables. Our findings open the way\nto low dimensional modeling of systems featuring a large number of degrees of\nfreedom and multiple quasi-stationary states.\n", "  The occurrence of non-Abelian symmetry-locked states in ultracold fermionic\nmixtures with four components is investigated. We study the phase diagram in\nthe presence of an attractive interaction between the species of two pairs of\nthe mixture, and general (also repulsive) interactions between the species of\neach pair. This system is physically realized, e.g., in mixtures of two\ndifferent earth-alkaline species, both of them with two hyperfine levels\nselectively populated. We find an extended region of the diagram exhibiting a\ntwo-flavors superfluid symmetry-locking (TSFL) phase. This phase is present\nalso for not too large repulsive intra-pair interactions and it is\ncharacterized by a global non-Abelian symmetry group obtained by locking\ntogether two independent invariance groups of the corresponding normal state.\nExplicit estimates are reported for the mixture of the fermionic isotopes\n$^{171}\\mathrm{Yb}$-$^{173}\\mathrm{Yb}$, indicating that the TFSL phase can be\nachieved also without tuning the interactions between $\\mathrm{Yb}$ atoms.\n", "  An algebraic structure of matter spectrum is studied. It is shown that a base\nmathematical construction, lying in the ground of matter spectrum (introduced\nby Heisenberg) , is a two-level Hilbert space. Two-level structure of the\nHilbert space is defined by the following pair: 1) a separable Hilbert space\nwith operator algebras and fundamental symmetries; 2) a nonseparable (physical)\nHilbert space with dynamical and gauge symmetries, that is, a space of states\n(energy levels) of the matter spectrum. The each state of matter spectrum is\ndefined by a cyclic representation within Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction.\nA decomposition of the physical Hilbert space onto coherent subspaces is given.\nThis decomposition allows one to describe the all observed spectrum of states\non an equal footing, including lepton, meson and baryon sectors of the matter\nspectrum. Following to Heisenberg, we assume that there exist no fundamental\nparticles, there exist fundamental symmetries. It is shown also that all the\nsymmetries of matter spectrum are divided onto three kinds: fundamental,\ndynamical and gauge symmetries.\n", "  The isotropic majority-vote (MV) model which, apart from the one-dimensional\ncase, is thought to be non-equilibrium and violating the detailed balance\ncondition. We show that this is not true, when the model is defined on a\ncomplete graph. In the stationary regime, the MV model on a fully connected\ngraph fulfills the detailed balance. We derive the exact expression for the\nprobability distribution of finding the system in a given spin configuration.\nWe show that it only depends on the absolute value of magnetization. Our\ntheoretical predictions are validated by numerical simulations.\n", "  Using self dual Ashtekar variables, we investigate (at the effective level)\nthe spherically symmetry reduced model of loop quantum gravity, both in vacuum\nand when coupled to a scalar field. Within the real Ashtekar-Barbero\nformulation, the system scalar field coupled to spherically symmetric gravity\nis known to possess a non closed (quantum) algebra of constraints once the\nholonomy corrections are introduced, which forbids the loop quantization of the\nmodel. Moreover, the vacuum case, while not anomalous, introduces modifications\nwhich are usually interpreted as an effective signature change of the metric in\nthe deep quantum region. We show in this paper that both those complications\ndisappear when working with self dual Ashtekar variables, both in the vacuum\ncase and in the case of gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field. In this\nframework, the algebra of the holonomy corrected constraints is anomaly free\nand reproduces the classical hypersurface deformation algebra without any\ndeformations. A possible path towards quantization of this model is briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  We prove new quantitative limitations on any approximate simultaneous cloning\nor broadcasting of mixed states. The results are based on information-theoretic\n(entropic) considerations and generalize the well known no-cloning and\nno-broadcasting theorems. We also observe and exploit the fact that the\nuniversal cloning machine on the symmetric subspace of $n$ qudits and\nsymmetrized partial trace channels are dual to each other. This duality\nmanifests itself both in the algebraic sense of adjointness of quantum channels\nand in the operational sense that a universal cloning machine can be used as an\napproximate recovery channel for a symmetrized partial trace channel and vice\nversa. The duality extends to give control on the performance of generalized\nUQCMs on subspaces more general than the symmetric subspace. This gives a way\nto quantify the usefulness of a-priori information in the context of cloning.\nFor example, we can control the performance of an antisymmetric analogue of the\nUQCM in recovering from the loss of $n-k$ fermionic particles.\n", "  We define single electron spin qubits in a silicon MOS double quantum dot\nsystem. By mapping the qubit resonance frequency as a function of gate-induced\nelectric field, the spectrum reveals an anticrossing that is consistent with an\ninter-valley spin-orbit coupling. We fit the data from which we extract an\ninter-valley coupling strength of 43 MHz. In addition, we observe a narrow\nresonance near the primary qubit resonance when we operate the device in the\n(1,1) charge configuration. The experimental data is consistent with a\nsimulation involving two weakly exchanged-coupled spins with a g-factor\ndifference of 1 MHz, of the same order as the Rabi frequency. We conclude that\nthe narrow resonance is the result of driven transitions between the T- and T+\ntriplet states, using an ESR signal of frequency located halfway between the\nresonance frequencies of the two individual spins. The findings presented here\noffer an alternative method of implementing two-qubit gates, of relevance to\nthe operation of larger scale spin qubit systems.\n", "  We introduce a method for summing Feynman's perturbation series based on\ndiagrammatic Monte Carlo that significantly improves its convergence\nproperties. This allows us to investigate in a controllable manner the\npseudogap regime of the Hubbard model and to study the nodal/antinodal\ndichotomy at low doping and intermediate coupling. Marked differences from the\nweak coupling scenario are manifest, such as a higher degree of incoherence at\nthe antinodes than at the `hot spots'. Our results show that the pseudogap and\nreduction of quasiparticle coherence at the antinode is due to\nantiferromagnetic spin correlations centered around the commensurate\n$(\\pi,\\pi)$ wavevector. In contrast, the dominant source of scattering at the\nnode is associated with incommensurate momentum transfer. Umklapp scattering is\nfound to play a key role in the nodal/antinodal dichotomy.\n", "  The origin of very low-mass hydrogen-burning stars, brown dwarfs, and\nplanetary-mass objects at the low-mass end of the initial mass function is not\nyet fully understood. Gravitational fragmentation of circumstellar discs\nprovides a possible mechanism for the formation of such low-mass objects. The\nkinematic and binary properties of very low-mass objects formed through disc\nfragmentation at early times (< 10 Myr) were discussed in Li et al. (2015). In\nthis paper we extend the analysis by following the long-term evolution of\ndisc-fragmented systems, up to an age of 10 Gyr, covering the ages of the\nstellar and substellar population in the Galactic field. We find that the\nsystems continue to decay, although the rates at which companions escape or\ncollide with each other are substantially lower than during the first 10 Myr,\nand that dynamical evolution is limited beyond 1 Gyr. By t = 10 Gyr, about one\nthird of the host stars is single, and more than half have only one companion\nleft. Most of the other systems have two companions left that orbit their host\nstar in widely separated orbits. A small fraction of companions have formed\nbinaries that orbit the host star in a hierarchical triple configuration. The\nmajority of such double companion systems have internal orbits that are\nretrograde with respect to their orbits around their host stars. Our\nsimulations allow a comparison between the predicted outcomes of\ndisc-fragmentation with the observed low-mass hydrogen-burning stars, brown\ndwarfs, and planetary-mass objects in the Solar neighborhood. Imaging and\nradial velocity surveys for faint binary companions among nearby stars are\nnecessary for verification or rejection for the formation mechanism proposed in\nthis paper.\n", "  The high harmonic generation in periodically corrugated submicrometer\nwaveguides is studied numerically. Plasmonic field enhancement in the vicinity\nof the corrugations allows to use low pump intensities. Simultaneously,\nperiodic placement of the corrugations leads to quasi-phase-matching and\ncorresponding increase of the high harmonic efficiency. The optimization of\nwaveguide geometry is performed, and the resulting spectra are analyzed by the\nmeans of (1+1)D numerical model.\n", "  In this letter we study the weak-convergence properties of random variables\ngenerated by unsharp quantum measurements. More precisely, for a sequence of\nrandom variables generated by repeated unsharp quantum measurements, we study\nthe limit distribution of relative frequency. We provide the de Finetti-type\nrepresentation theorem for all separable states, showing that the distribution\ncan be well approximated by mixture of normal distributions. No symmetry\nrestrictions, such as the permutational invariance were needed. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the convergence rates and show that the relative frequency can\nstabilize to some constant at best at the rate of order $1/\\sqrt N$ for all\nseparable inputs. On the other hand, we provide an example of a strictly\nunsharp quantum measurement where the better rates are achieved by using\nentangled inputs. This means that in certain cases the noise generated by the\nmeasurement process can be suppressed by using entanglement. We deliver our\nresult in the form of quantum information task where the player achieves the\ngoal with certainty in the limiting case by using entangled inputs or fails\nwith certainty by using separable inputs.\n", "  The electronic excitation of molecules triggers diverse phenomena such as\nluminescence and photovoltaic effects, which are the bases of various\nenergy-converting devices. Understanding and control of the excitations at the\nsingle-molecule level are long standing targets, however, they have been\nhampered by the limited spatial resolution in optical probing techniques. Here\nwe investigate the electronic excitation of a single molecule with\nsub-molecular precision using a localised plasmon at the tip apex of a scanning\ntunnelling microscope (STM) as an excitation probe. Coherent energy transfer\nbetween the plasmon and molecular excitons is discovered when the plasmon is\nlocated in the proximity of isolated molecules, which is corroborated by a\ntheoretical analysis. The polarised plasmonic field enables selective\nexcitation of an electronic transition between anisotropic frontier molecular\norbitals. Our findings have established the foundation of a novel\nsingle-molecule spectroscopy with STM, providing an integrated platform for\nreal-space investigation of localised excited states.\n", "  Adsorbed atoms and molecules play an important role in controlling and tuning\nthe functional properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Understanding and\npredicting this process from theory is challenging because of the need to\ncapture the complex interplay between the local chemistry and the long-range\nscreening response. To address this problem, we present a first-principles\nmultiscale approach that combines linear-scaling density-functional theory,\ncontinuum screening theory and large-scale tight-binding simulations into a\nseamless parameter-free theory of adsorbates on 2D materials. We apply this\nmethod to investigate the electronic structure of doped graphene with a single\ncalcium (Ca) adatom and find that the Ca atom acts as a Coulomb impurity which\nmodifies the graphene local density of states (LDOS) within a distance of\nseveral nanometres in its vicinity. We also observe an important doping\ndependence of the graphene LDOS near the Ca atom, which gives insights into\nelectronic screening in graphene. Our multiscale framework opens up the\npossibility of investigating complex mesoscale adsorbate configurations on 2D\nmaterials relevant to real devices.\n", "  Dark matter drops out of kinetic equilibrium with standard model particles\nwhen the momentum-transfer rate equals the expansion rate. In a\nradiation-dominated universe, this occurs at essentially the same time as dark\nmatter kinetically decouples from the plasma. Dark matter may also fall out of\nkinetic equilibrium with standard model particles during an early\nmatter-dominated era (EMDE), which occurs when the energy content of the\nUniverse is dominated by either a decaying oscillating scalar field or a\nsemistable massive particle before big bang nucleosynthesis. Until now, it has\nbeen assumed that kinetic decoupling during an EMDE happens similarly to the\nway it does in a radiation-dominated era. We show that this is not the case. By\nstudying the evolution of the dark matter temperature, we establish a\nquasidecoupled state for dark matter in an EMDE, during which the dark matter\ntemperature cools faster than the plasma temperature but slower than it would\ncool if the dark matter were fully decoupled. The dark matter does not fully\ndecouple until the EMDE ends and the Universe becomes radiation dominated. We\nalso extend the criteria for quasidecoupling to other nonstandard thermal\nhistories and consider how quasidecoupling affects the free-streaming length of\ndark matter.\n", "  The local statistical fluctuations in Brownian ensembles, the intermediate\nstate of perturbation of one classical ensemble by another one, are system-size\ninvariant if the perturbation parameter has the same size-dependence as that of\nthe ensemble averaged local level density. The sensitivity to local spectral\ndensity however makes the measures for the critical statistics non-stationary\nalong the spectrum.\n", "  We investigate the usefulness of ground states of quantum spin chains with\nsymmetry-protected topological order (SPTO) for measurement-based quantum\ncomputation. We show that, in spatial dimension one, if an SPTO phase supports\nquantum wire, then, subject to an additional symmetry condition that is\nsatisfied in all cases so far investigated, it can also be used for quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  We find a realization of the $Z_2$-symmetry in the neutrino mass matrix which\nexpresses a rotation of the $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry and is able to impose a generic\nsmallest mixing angle, in contrast to a zero-value predicted by the usual\nnon-rotated form of the $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry. We extend this symmetry for the\nlepton sector within type-I seesaw scenario, and show it can accommodate the\nmixing angles, the mass hierarchies and the lepton asymmetry in the universe.\nWe then study the effects of perturbing the specific form of the neutrino mass\nmatrix imposed by the symmetry and compute the resulting mixing and mass\nspectrum. We trace back this \"low-scale\" perturbation to a \"high-scale\"\nperturbation, and find realizations of this latter one arising from exact\nsymmetries with an enriched matter content.\n", "  In this paper we study bond percolation on a one-dimensional chain with\npower-law bond probability $C/ r^{1+\\sigma}$, where $r$ is the distance length\nbetween distinct sites. We introduce and test an order $N$ Monte Carlo\nalgorithm and we determine as a function of $\\sigma$ the critical value $C_{c}$\nat which percolation occurs. The critical exponents in the range $0<\\sigma<1$\nare reported and compared with mean-field and $\\varepsilon$-expansion results.\nOur analysis is in agreement, up to a numerical precision $\\approx 10^{-3}$,\nwith the mean field result for the anomalous dimension $\\eta=2-\\sigma$, showing\nthat there is no correction to $\\eta$ due to correlation effects.\n", "  The XXL survey currently covers two 25 sq. deg. patches with XMM observations\nof ~10ks. We summarise the scientific results associated with the first release\nof the XXL data set, that occurred mid 2016. We review several arguments for\nincreasing the survey depth to 40 ks during the next decade of XMM operations.\nX-ray (z<2) cluster, (z<4) AGN and cosmic background survey science will then\nbenefit from an extraordinary data reservoir. This, combined with deep\nmulti-$\\lambda$ observations, will lead to solid standalone cosmological\nconstraints and provide a wealth of information on the formation and evolution\nof AGN, clusters and the X-ray background. In particular, it will offer a\nunique opportunity to pinpoint the z>1 cluster density. It will eventually\nconstitute a reference study and an ideal calibration field for the upcoming\neROSITA and Euclid missions.\n", "  Production cross-sections of prompt charm mesons are measured using data from\n$pp$ collisions at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of $5\\,$TeV. The data\nsample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $8.60\\pm0.33\\,$pb$^{-1}$\ncollected by the LHCb experiment. The production cross-sections of $D^0$,\n$D^+$, $D_s^+$, and $D^{*+}$ mesons are measured in bins of charm meson\ntransverse momentum, $p_{\\text{T}}$, and rapidity, $y$. They cover the rapidity\nrange $2.0<y<4.5$ and transverse momentum ranges $0 < p_{\\text{T}} < 10\\,\n\\text{GeV}/c$ for $D^0$ and $D^+$ and $1 < p_{\\text{T}} < 10\\, \\text{GeV}/c$\nfor $D_s^+$ and $D^{*+}$ mesons.

Here, we study a simple system of fermions\nhopping in a cubic lattice subject to a Weyl type spin-orbit coupling (SOC). As\none tunes the SOC parameter at the half filling, the system displays Weyl\nfermions and also various TPT due to the collision of particle-particle or\nhole-hole Weyl Fermi Surface (WFS). At the zero temperature, the TPT is found\nto be a third order one whose critical exponent is determined. We derive the\nscaling functions of the specific heat, compressibility and magnetic\nsusceptibilities. In contrast to all the previous cases in quantum or\ntopological transitions, although the leading terms are non-universal and\ncutoff dependent, the sub-leading terms satisfy universal scaling relations.\nThe sub-leading scaling leads to the topological depletions (TD) which show\nnon-analytic and non-Fermi liquid corrections in the quantum critical regime,\ncan be easily distinguished from the analytic leading terms and detected\nexperimentally. One can also form a topological Wilson ratio from the TD of two\nconserved quantities such as the specific heat and the compressibility. As a\nbyproduct, we also find Type II Weyl fermions appearing as the TPT due to the\ncollision of the extended particle-hole WFS. Experimental realizations and\ndetections in cold atom systems and materials with SOC are discussed.\n", "  The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; inner $\\sim{}200~\\rm{}pc$) of the Milky Way\nis a star formation (SF) environment with very extreme physical properties.\nExploration of SF in this region is important because (i) this region allows us\nto test models of star formation under exceptional conditions, and (ii) the CMZ\nclouds might be suitable to serve as templates to understand the physics of\nstarburst galaxies in the nearby and the distant universe. For this reason we\nlaunched the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS), the first\nsystematic study that resolves all major CMZ clouds at interferometer angular\nresolution (i.e., a few arc seconds). Here we present initial results based on\nobservations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Atacama Pathfinder\nExperiment (APEX). Our study is complemented by dust emission data from the\nHerschel Space Telescope and a comprehensive literature survey of CMZ star\nformation activity. Our research reveals (i) an unusually steep linewidth-size\nrelation, $\\sigma(v)\\propto{}r_{\\rm{}eff}^{0.66\\pm{}0.18}$, down to velocity\ndispersions $\\sim{}0.6~\\rm{}km\\,s^{-1}$ at 0.1 pc scale. This scaling law\npotentially results from the decay of gas motions to transonic velocities in\nstrong shocks. The data also show that, relative to dense gas in the solar\nneighborhood, (ii) star formation is suppressed by factors $\\gtrsim{}10$ in\nindividual CMZ clouds. This observation encourages exploration of processes\nthat can suppress SF inside dense clouds for a significant period of time.\n", "  We present the first systematic study of the density structure of clouds\nfound in a complete sample covering all major molecular clouds in the Central\nMolecular Zone (CMZ; inner $\\sim{}200~\\rm{}pc$) of the Milky Way. This is made\npossible by using data from the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS),\nthe first study resolving all major molecular clouds in the CMZ at\ninterferometer angular resolution. We find that many CMZ molecular clouds have\nunusually shallow density gradients compared to regions elsewhere in the Milky\nWay. This is possibly a consequence of weak gravitational binding of the\nclouds. The resulting relative absence of dense gas on spatial scales\n$\\sim{}0.1~\\rm{}pc$ is probably one of the reasons why star formation (SF) in\ndense gas of the CMZ is suppressed by a factor $\\sim{}10$, compared to solar\nneighborhood clouds. Another factor suppressing star formation are the high SF\ndensity thresholds that likely result from the observed gas kinematics.\nFurther, it is possible but not certain that the star formation activity and\nthe cloud density structure evolve systematically as clouds orbit the CMZ.\n", "  We investigate the nonlinear scattering dynamics in interacting atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates under non-Hermitian dissipative conditions. We show\nthat by carefully engineering a momentum-dependent atomic loss profile one can\nachieve matter-wave amplification through four wave mixing in a one-dimensional\nquasi free-space setup - a process that is forbidden in the counterpart\nHermitian systems due to energy mismatch. Additionally, we show that similar\neffects lead to rich nonlinear dynamics in higher dimensions. Finally, we\npropose a physical realization for selectively tailoring the momentum-dependent\natomic dissipation. Our strategy is based on a two step process: (i) exciting\natoms to narrow Rydberg- or metastable excited states, and (ii) introducing\nloss through recoil; all while leaving the bulk condensate intact due to\nprotection by quantum interference.\n", "  A gauged Dirac-Weyl equation in (2+1)-dimension is considered. This equation\nhas the particularity to describe the states of a graphene Dirac matter. In\nparticular we are interested in matter interacting with a Chern-Simons gauge\nfields. We show that exact self-dual solutions are admitted. These solutions\nare the same as those supported by nonrelativistic matter interacting with a\nChern-Simons gauge field.\n", "  In a two-dimensional (2D) classical fluid, a large-scale flow structure\nemerges out of turbulence, which is known as the inverse energy cascade where\nenergy flows from small to large length scales. An interesting question is\nwhether this phenomenon can occur in a superfluid, which is inviscid and\nirrotational by nature. Atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of highly\noblate geometry provide an experimental venue for studying 2D superfluid\nturbulence, but their full investigation has been hindered due to a lack of the\ncirculation sign information of individual quantum vortices in a turbulent\nsample. Here, we demonstrate a vortex sign detection method by using Bragg\nscattering, and we investigate decaying turbulence in a highly oblate BEC at\nlow temperatures, with our lowest being $\\sim 0.5 T_c$, where $T_c$ is the\nsuperfluid critical temperature. We observe that weak spatial pairing between\nvortices and antivortices develops in the turbulent BEC, which corresponds to\nthe vortex-dipole gas regime predicted for high dissipation. Our results\nprovide a direct quantitative marker for the survey of various 2D turbulence\nregimes in the BEC system.\n", "  Heavy fermion materials gain high electronic masses and expand Fermi surfaces\nwhen the high-temperature localized f electrons become itinerant and hybridize\nwith the conduction band at low temperatures. However, despite the common\napplication of this model, direct microscopic verification remains lacking.\nHere we report high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nmeasurements on CeCoIn5, a prototypical heavy fermion compound, and reveal the\nlong-sought band hybridization and Fermi surface expansion. Unexpectedly, the\nlocalized-to-itinerant transition occurs at surprisingly high temperatures, yet\nf electrons are still largely localized at the lowest temperature. Moreover,\ncrystal field excitations likely play an important role in the anomalous\ntemperature dependence. Our results paint an comprehensive unanticipated\nexperimental picture of the heavy fermion formation in a periodic multi-level\nAnderson/Kondo lattice, and set the stage for understanding the emergent\nproperties in related materials.\n", "  We have realised laser-doped all-silicon superconducting (S)/ normal metal\n(N) bilayers of tunable thickness and dopant concentration. We observed a\nstrong reduction of the bilayers critical temperature when increasing the\nnormal metal thickness, a signature of the highly transparent S/N interface\nassociated to the epitaxial sharp laser doping profile. We extracted the\ninterface resistance by fitting with the linearised Usadel equations,\ndemonstrating a reduction of one order of magnitude from previous\nsuperconductor/doped Si interfaces. In this well controlled crystalline system\nwe exploited the low resistance S/N interfaces to elaborate all-silicon lateral\nSNS Josephson junctions with long range proximity effect. Their dc transport\nproperties, such as the critical and retrapping currents, could be well\nunderstood in the diffusive regime. Furthermore, this work lead to the\nestimation of important parameters in ultra-doped superconducting Si, such as\nthe Fermi velocity, the coherence length, or the electron-phonon coupling\nconstant, fundamental to conceive an all-silicon superconducting electronics.\n", "  This paper presents an improved MHD modeling of the confined filament\neruption in solar active region NOAA~9957 on 2002 May~27 by extending the\nparametric studies of the event in Torok & Kliem 2005 and Hassanin & Kliem\n2016. Here the initial flux rope equilibrium is chosen to possess a small apex\nheight identical to the observed initial filament height, which implies a more\nrealistic inclusion of the photospheric line tying. The model matches the\nobservations as closely as in the preceding studies, with the closest agreement\nagain being obtained for an initial average flux rope twist of about $4\\pi$.\nThus, the model for strongly writhing confined solar eruptions, which assumes\nthat a kink-unstable flux rope in the stability domain of the torus instability\nexists at the onset of the eruption's main acceleration phase, is further\nsubstantiated.\n", "  The algebraic structure of representation theory naturally arises from 2D\nfixed-point tensor network states, which conceptually formulates the pattern of\nlong-range entanglement realized in such states. In 3D, the same underlying\nstructure is also shared by Turaev-Viro state-sum topological quantum field\ntheory (TQFT). We show that a 2D fixed-point tensor network state arises\nnaturally on the boundary of the 3D manifold on which the TQFT is defined, and\nthe fact that exactly the same information is needed to construct either the\ntensor network or the TQFT is made explicit in a form of holography.\nFurthermore, the entanglement of the fixed-point states leads to an emergence\nof pre-geometry in the 3D TQFT bulk. We further extend these ideas to the case\nwhere an additional global onsite unitary symmetry is imposed on the tensor\nnetwork states.\n", "  Topologically protected defects have been observed and studied in a wide\nrange of fields, such as cosmology, spin systems, cold atoms and optics as they\nare quenched across a phase transition into an ordered state. Revealing their\norigin and control is becoming increasingly important field of research, as\nthey limit the coherence of the system and its ability to approach a fully\nordered state. Here, we present dissipative topological defects in a 1-D ring\nnetwork of phase-locked lasers, and show how their formation is related to the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism and is governed in a universal manner by two competing\ntime scales of the lasers, namely the phase locking time and synchronization\ntime of their amplitude fluctuations. The ratio between these two time scales\ndepends on the system parameters such as gain and coupling strength, and thus\noffers the possibility to control the probability of topological defects in the\nsystem. Enabling the system to dissipate to the fully ordered, defect-free\nstate can be exploited for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems in\nvarious fields. As opposed to unitary systems where quenching is obtained via\nexternal cooling mostly through the edges, our dissipative system is kept\nstrictly uniform even for fast quenches.\n", "  Urban scholars have studied street networks in various ways, but there are\ndata availability and consistency limitations to the current urban\nplanning/street network analysis literature. To address these challenges, this\narticle presents OSMnx, a new tool to make the collection of data and creation\nand analysis of street networks simple, consistent, automatable and sound from\nthe perspectives of graph theory, transportation, and urban design. OSMnx\ncontributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners:\nfirst, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building\nfootprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of\nstreet network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of\nnetwork topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as\nshapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street\nnetworks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks,\nand calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those\ncommon in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures\nof the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a\nsimple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in\nPortland, Oregon.\n", "  Under the Thomas-Fermi approximation, a relatively much simpler analytical\nsolutions of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the two-species BEC\nhave been derived. Additionally, a model for the asymmetric states has been\nproposed, and the competition between the symmetric and asymmetric states has\nbeen evaluated. The whole parameter-space is divided into zones, each supports\na specific phase, namely, the symmetric miscible phase, the symmetric\nimmiscible phase, or the asymmetric phase. Based on the division the\nphase-diagrams against any set of parameters can be plotted. Thereby, the\neffects of these parameters can be visualized. There are three critical values\nin the inter-species interaction $% V_{AB} $ and one in the ratio of particle\nnumbers $N_{A}/N_{B}$. They govern the transitions between the phases. Two\ncases, (i) the repulsive $V_{AB}$ matches the repulsive $% V_{A}+V_{B}$, and\n(ii) the attractive $V_{AB}$ nearly cancels the effect of the repulsive\n$V_{A}+V_{B}$ have been particularly taken into account. The former leads to a\ncomplete separation of the two kinds of atoms , while the latter lead to a\ncollapse. Finally, based on an equation derived in the paper, a convenient\nexperimental approach is proposed to determine the ratio of particle numbers .\n", "  Neutral-current production of $K^{+}$ by atmospheric neutrinos is a\nbackground in searches for the proton decay $p \\rightarrow K^{+} \\bar{\\nu}$.\nReactions such as $\\nu p \\rightarrow \\nu K^{+} \\Lambda$ are indistinguishable\nfrom proton decays when the decay products of the $\\Lambda$ are below detection\nthreshold. Events with $K^{+}$ are identified in MINERvA by reconstructing the\ntiming signature of a $K^{+}$ decay at rest. A sample of 201 neutrino-induced\nneutral-current $K^{+}$ events is used to measure differential cross sections\nwith respect to the $K^{+}$ kinetic energy, and the non-$K^{+}$ hadronic\nvisible energy. An excess of events at low hadronic visible energy is observed\nrelative to the prediction of the NEUT event generator. Good agreement is\nobserved with the cross section prediction of the GENIE generator. A search for\nphotons from $\\pi^{0}$ decay, which would veto a neutral-current $K^{+}$ event\nin a proton decay search, is performed, and a 2$\\sigma$ deficit of detached\nphotons is observed relative to the GENIE prediction.\n", "  A superclimbing dislocation spread over several valleys of Peierls potential\nin solid Helium-4 represents a non-Luttinger Liquid according to the elementary\nscaling dimensional analysis because its excitation spectrum is parabolic.\nMonte Carlo simulations, however, reveal that such a dislocation develops\nLuttinger Liquid behavior, which can also undergo a transition into insulating\nstate. External bias can restore the parabolic spectrum. An experimental\nverification of the effect is proposed.\n", "  Deterministically aperiodic sequences are an intermediary between periodic\nsequences and completely random sequences. Materials which are translationally\nperiodic have Bloch-like extended states, while random media exhibit Anderson\nlocalisation. Materials constructed on the basis of deterministic aperiodic\nsequences such as Fibonacci, Thue-Morse, and Rudin-Shapiro exhibit different\nproperties, which can be related to their spectrum. Here, by investigating the\ndynamics of discrete-time quantum walks using different aperiodic sequences of\ncoin operations in position space and time we establish the role of the\ndiffraction spectra in characterizing the spreading of the wavepacket.\n", "  We study the classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular\nlattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a magnetic field. We focus\nin particular in the emergence of a composite spin crystal phase, dubbed\nantiferromagnetic skyrmion lattice, that was recently observed in [Phys. Rev. B\n92, 214439 (2015)] for intermediate fields. This complex phase can be made up\nfrom three inter-penetrated skyrmion lattices, one for each sub-lattice of the\noriginal triangular one. Following these recent numerical results, in this\npaper we explicitly construct the low-energy effective action that reproduces\nthe correct phenomenology and could serve as a starting point to study the\ncoupling to charge carriers, lattice vibrations, structural disorder and\ntransport phenomena.\n", "  Multilayer networks are widespread in natural and manmade systems. Key\nproperties of these networks are their spectral and eigenfunction\ncharacteristics, as they determine the critical properties of many dynamics\noccurring on top of them. In this paper, we numerically demonstrate that the\nnormalized localization length $\\beta$ of the eigenfunctions of multilayer\nrandom networks follows a simple scaling law given by $\\beta=x^*/(1+x^*)$, with\n$x^*=\\gamma(b_{\\text{eff}}^2/L)^\\delta$, $\\gamma,\\delta\\sim 1$ and\n$b_{\\text{eff}}$ being the effective bandwidth of the adjacency matrix of the\nnetwork, whose size is $L=M\\times N$. The reported scaling law for $\\beta$\nmight help to better understand criticality in multilayer networks as well as\nto predict the eigenfunction localization properties of them.\n", "  We consider inter-atomic forces due to resonant dipole-dipole interactions\nwithin a dimer of highly excited Rydberg atoms, embedded in an ultra-cold gas.\nThese forces rely on a coherent superposition of two-atom electronic states,\nwhich is destroyed by continuous monitoring of the dimer state through a\ndetection scheme utilizing controllable interactions with the background gas\natoms. We show that this intrinsic decoherence of the molecular energy surface\ncan gradually deteriorate a repulsive dimer state, causing a mixing of\nattractive and repulsive character. For sufficiently strong decoherence, a\nZeno-like effect causes a complete arrest of interatomic forces. We finally\nshow how short decohering pulses can controllably redistribute population\nbetween the different molecular energy surfaces.\n", "  Here we report the evidence of the type II Dirac Fermion in the layered\ncrystal PdTe2. The de Haas-van Alphen oscillations find a small Fermi pocket\nwith a cross section of 0.077nm-2 with a nontrivial Berry phase.\nFirst-principal calculations reveal that it is originated from the hole pocket\nof a tilted Dirac cone. Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy demonstrates\na type II Dirac cone featured dispersion. We also suggest PdTe2 is an improved\nplatform to host the topological superconductors.\n", "  Predators may attack isolated or grouped prey in a cooperative, collective\nway. Whether a gregarious behavior is advantageous to each species depends on\nseveral conditions and game theory is a useful tool to deal with such a\nproblem. We here extend the Lett-Auger-Gaillard model [Theor. Pop. Biol. 65\n(2004) 263] to spatially distributed populations and compare the resulting\nbehavior with their mean-field predictions for the coevolving densities of\npredator and prey strategies. Besides its richer behavior in the presence of\nspatial organization, we also show that the coexistence phase in which\ncollective and individual strategies for each group are present is stable\nbecause of an effective, cyclic dominance mechanism similar to a well-studied\ngeneralization of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with four species, a further\nexample of how ubiquitous this coexistence mechanism is.\n", "  We calculate one loop $y_t$ and $\\lambda$ dependent corrections to\n$\\bar{\\Gamma}_Z,\\bar{R}_f^0$ and the partial $Z$ widths due to dimension six\noperators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), including\nfinite terms. We assume $\\rm CP$ symmetry and a $\\rm U(3)^5$ symmetry in the UV\nmatching onto the dimension six operators, dominantly broken by the Standard\nModel Yukawa matrices. Corrections to these observables are predicted using the\ninput parameters $\\{\\hat{\\alpha}_{ew}, \\hat{M}_Z, \\hat{G}_F, \\hat{m}_t,\n\\hat{m}_h\\}$ extracted with one loop corrections in the same limit. We show\nthat at one loop the number of SMEFT parameters contributing to the precise\nLEPI pseudo-observables exceeds the number of measurements. As a result the\nSMEFT parameters contributing to LEP data are formally unbounded when the size\nof loop corrections are reached until other data is considered in a global\nanalysis. The size of these loop effects is generically a correction of order\n$\\sim\\%$ to leading effects in the SMEFT, but we find multiple large numerical\ncoefficients in our calculation at this order. We use a $\\rm \\overline{MS}$\nscheme, modified for the SMEFT, for renormalization. Some subtleties involving\nnovel evanescent scheme dependence present in this result are explained.\n", "  We investigate the formation of Majorana fermions in finite-size graphene\nstrips with open boundary conditions in both directions, in the presence of an\nin-plane magnetic field and in the proximity of a superconducting substrate. We\nshow that for long enough strips the Majorana states can form in the presence\nof a Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling, as well as in the presence of an\ninhomogeneous magnetic field. We find that, unlike infinite graphene ribbons in\nwhich Majorana states arise solely close to the bottom of the band and the Van\nHove singularities, for finite-size systems this can happen also at much\nsmaller doping values, close to the Dirac points, and depends strongly on the\ntype of the short edges of the systems (e.g. armchair vs. zigzag), as well as\non the width of the ribbons.\n", "  We present a fast and versatile method to calculate the characteristic\nspectrum $h_c$ of the gravitational wave background (GWB) emitted by a\npopulation of eccentric massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). We fit the\nspectrum of a reference MBHB with a simple analytic function and show that the\nspectrum of any other MBHB can be derived from this reference spectrum via\nsimple scalings of mass, redshift and frequency. We then apply our calculation\nto a realistic population of MBHBs evolving via 3-body scattering of stars in\ngalactic nuclei. We demonstrate that our analytic prescription satisfactorily\ndescribes the signal in the frequency band relevant to pulsar timing array\n(PTA) observations. Finally we model the high frequency steepening of the GWB\nto provide a complete description of the features characterizing the spectrum.\nFor typical stellar distributions observed in massive galaxies, our calculation\nshows that 3-body scattering alone is unlikely to affect the GWB in the PTA\nband and a low frequency turnover in the spectrum is caused primarily by high\neccentricities.\n", "  RNA interference (RNAi) is a fundamental cellular process that inhibits gene\nexpression through cleavage and destruction of target mRNA. It is responsible\nfor a number of important intracellular functions, from being the first line of\nimmune defence against pathogens to regulating development and morphogenesis.\nIn this paper we consider a mathematical model of RNAi with particular emphasis\non time delays associated with two aspects of primed amplification: binding of\nsiRNA to aberrant RNA, and binding of siRNA to mRNA, both of which result in\nthe expanded production of dsRNA responsible for RNA silencing. Analytical and\nnumerical stability analyses are performed to identify regions of stability of\ndifferent steady states and to determine conditions on parameters that lead to\ninstability. Our results suggest that while the original model without time\ndelays exhibits a bi-stability due to the presence of a hysteresis loop, under\nthe influence of time delays, one of the two steady states with the high\n(default) or small (silenced) concentration of mRNA can actually lose its\nstability via a Hopf bifurcation. This leads to the co-existence of a stable\nsteady state and a stable periodic orbit, which has a profound effect on the\ndynamics of the system.\n", "  We derive a class of thermodynamically consistent variants of\nMaxwell/Oldroyd-B type models for viscoelastic fluids. In particular, we study\nthe models that allow one to consider temperature dependent material\ncoefficients. This naturally calls for the formulation of a temperature\nevolution equation that would accompany the evolution equations for the\nmechanical quantities. The evolution equation for the temperature is explicitly\nformulated, and it is shown to be consistent with the laws of thermodynamics\nand the evolution equations for the mechanical quantities. The temperature\nevolution equation contains terms that are ignored or even not thought of in\nmost of the works dealing with this class of fluids. The impact of the\nadditional terms in the temperature evolution equation on the flow dynamics is\ndocumented by the solution of simple initial/boundary value problems.\n", "  We present a study of non-sequential double recombination (NSDR) high\nharmonic generation (HHG) in a molecular-like system. Using a Coulomb-corrected\nthree-step model we are able to classically describe the observed NSDR HHG\ncutoffs precisely for all internuclear distances showing an intrinsic\ndependence on the location of the nuclei in the NSDR HHG process originating\npartly from the strong electron correlation in the NSDR HHG process. This\ndependence modifies the classically allowed return energies which in return\nchanges the cutoffs observed in the HHG spectra. We also observe that the NSDR\nHHG signal changes its character for internuclear distances of $R\\gtrsim 8-9$\na.u. which is proposed to stem from a change in the charge transfer dynamics\nwithin the molecule. For large internuclear distances of $R\\gtrsim 13$ a.u. we\nobserve a clear signature of the point of emission for the first electron\nemitted in the NSDR HHG signal and we also see signs of molecular exchange\npaths contributing to the HHG spectrum for these internuclear distances.\n", "  We consider the inverse problem in pulsar timing array (PTA) analysis,\ninvestigating what astrophysical information about the underlying massive black\nhole binary (MBHB) population can be recovered from the detection of a\nstochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We employ a physically\nmotivated model that connects the GWB spectrum to a series of parameters\ndescribing the underlying redshift evolution of the MBHB mass function and to\nthe typical eccentricity they acquire while interacting with the dense\nenvironment of post merger galactic nuclei. This allows the folding in of\ninformation about the spectral shape of the GWB into the analysis. The priors\non the model parameters are assumed to be uninformative and consistent with the\ncurrent lack of secure observations of sub-parsec MBHBs. We explore the\nimplications of current upper limits as well as of future detections with a\nvariety of PTA configurations. We confirm our previous finding that current\nupper limits can only place an upper bound on the overall MBHB merger rate.\nDepending on the properties of the array, future detections can also constrain\nseveral MBHB population models at different degrees of fidelity. In particular,\na simultaneous detection of a steepening of the spectrum at high frequency and\na bending at low frequency will place strong constraints on both the MBHB mass\nfunction and on the typical eccentricity of inspiralling MBHBs, providing\ninsights on MBHB astrophysics unlikely to be achievable by any other means.\n", "  Crystallization is a process of great practical relevance in which rare but\ncrucial fluctuations lead to the formation of a solid phase starting from the\nliquid. Like in all first order first transitions there is an interplay between\nenthalpy and entropy. Based on this idea, to drive crystallization in molecular\nsimulations, we introduce two collective variables, one enthalpic and the other\nentropic. Defined in this way, these collective variables do not prejudge the\nstructure the system is going to crystallize into. We show the usefulness of\nthis approach by studying the case of sodium and aluminum that crystallize in\nthe bcc and fcc crystalline structure, respectively. Using these two generic\ncollective variables, we perform variationally enhanced sampling and well\ntempered metadynamics simulations, and find that the systems transform\nspontaneously and reversibly between the liquid and the solid phases.\n", "  The photon blockade (PB) effect in emitter-cavity systems depends on the\nanharmonicity of the ladder of dressed energy eigenstates. The recent\ndevelopments in color center photonics are leading toward experimental\ndemonstrations of multi-emitter-cavity solid-state systems with an expanded set\nof energy levels compared to the traditionally studied single-emitter systems.\nWe focus on the case of N = 2 nonidentical quasi-atoms strongly coupled to a\nnanocavity in the bad cavity regime (with parameters within reach of the color\ncenter systems), and discover three PB mechanisms: polaritonic, subradiant and\nunconventional. The polaritonic PB, which is the conventional mechanism studied\nin single-emitter-cavity systems, also occurs at the polariton frequencies in\nmulti-emitter systems. The subradiant PB is a new interference effect owing to\nthe inhomogeneous broadening of the emitters which results in a purer and a\nmore robust single photon emission than the polaritonic PB. The unconventional\nPB in the modeled system corresponds to the suppression of the single- and\ntwo-photon correlation statistics and the enhancement of the three-photon\ncorrelation statistic. Using the effective Hamiltonian approach, we unravel the\norigin and the time-domain evolution of these phenomena.\n", "  The KdV equation can be derived in the shallow water limit of the Euler\nequations. Over the last few decades, this equation has been extended to\ninclude both higher order effects (KdV2) and an uneven river bottom. Although\nthis equation is not integrable and has only one conservation law, exact\nperiodic and solitonic solutions exist for the even bottom case. The method\nused to find them assumes the same function forms as for KdV solutions. KdV2\nequation imposes more constraints on parameters of solutions. For soliton case\nKdV2 solution occurs for particular ratio of wave amplitude to water depth\nonly. For periodic case physically relevant solutions are admissible only for\ntwo narrow intervals of elliptic parameter $m$. For a range of $m$ near one the\ncnoidal waves are upright as expected, but are inverted in $m$ region close to\nzero. Properties of exact solutions of KdV and KdV2 are compared.\n", "  Larmor's theorem holds for magnetic systems that are invariant under spin\nrotation. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling this invariance is lost and\nLarmor's theorem is broken: for systems of interacting electrons, this gives\nrise to a subtle interplay between the spin-orbit coupling acting on individual\nsingle-particle states and Coulomb many-body effects. We consider a\nquasi-two-dimensional, partially spin-polarized electron gas in a semiconductor\nquantum well in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling.\nUsing a linear-response approach based on time-dependent density-functional\ntheory, we calculate the dispersions of spin-flip waves. We obtain analytic\nresults for small wave vectors and up to second order in the Rashba and\nDresselhaus coupling strengths $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Comparison with\nexperimental data from inelastic light scattering allows us to extract $\\alpha$\nand $\\beta$ as well as the spin-wave stiffness very accurately. We find\nsignificant deviations from the local density approximation for spin-dependent\nelectron systems.\n", "  Producing and maintaining entanglement reside at the heart of the optimal\nconstruction of quan- tum operations and are fundamental issues in the\nrealization of universal quantum computation. We here introduce a setup of spin\nqubits that allows for geometric implementation of entangling gates between the\nregister qubits with any arbitrary entangling power. We show this by demon-\nstrating a circuit through a spin chain, which performs universal nonadiabatic\nholonomic two-qubit entanglers. The proposed gates are all electric and\ngeometric, which would help to realize fast and robust entangling gates on spin\nqubits. This family of entangling gates contains gates that are as efficient as\nthe CNOT gate in quantum algorithms. We examine the robustness of the circuit\nto some extent.\n", "  Using optical measurements, we demonstrate that the rotation of micron-scale\ngraphene nanoplatelets levitated in a quadrupole ion trap in high vacuum can be\nfrequency locked to an applied radio frequency (rf) electric field. Over time,\nfrequency locking stabilizes the nanoplatelet so that its axis of rotation is\nnormal to the nanoplatelet and perpendicular to the rf electric field. We\nobserve that residual slow dynamics of the direction of the axis of rotation in\nthe plane normal to the rf electric field are determined by an applied magnetic\nfield. We present a simple model that accurately describes our observations.\nFrom our data and model we can infer both a diamagnetic polarizability and a\nmagnetic moment proportional to the frequency of rotation, which we compare to\ntheoretical values. Our results establish that trapping technologies have\napplications for materials measurements at the nanoscale.\n", "  We explore in greater detail our investigations of shear diffusion in\nhyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories in arXiv:1604.05092 [hep-th]. This\nadapts and generalizes the membrane-paradigm-like analysis of Kovtun, Son and\nStarinets for shear gravitational perturbations in the near horizon region\ngiven certain self-consistent approximations, leading to the shear diffusion\nconstant on an appropriately defined stretched horizon. In theories containing\na gauge field, some of the metric perturbations mix with some of the gauge\nfield perturbations and the above analysis is somewhat more complicated. We\nfind a similar near-horizon analysis can be obtained in terms of new field\nvariables involving a linear combination of the metric and the gauge field\nperturbation resulting in a corresponding diffusion equation. Thereby as\nbefore, for theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating exponents $z,\n\\theta$ satisfying $z<4-\\theta$ in four bulk dimensions, our analysis here\nresults in a similar expression for the shear diffusion constant with power-law\nscaling with temperature suggesting universal behaviour in relation to the\nviscosity bound. For $z=4-\\theta$, we find logarithmic behaviour.\n", "  For weakly disordered fractional quantum Hall phases, the non linear\nphotoconductivity is related to the charge susceptibility of the clean system\nby a Floquet boost. Thus, it may be possible to probe collective charge modes\nat finite wavevectors by electrical transport. Incompressible phases,\nirradiated at slightly above the magneto-roton gap, are predicted to exhibit\nnegative photoconductivity and zero resistance states with spontaneous internal\nelectric fields. Non linear conductivity can probe composite fermions' charge\nexcitations in compressible filling factors.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the dark matter particle is a scalar WIMP\nmessenger associated to neutrino mass generation, made stable by the same\nsymmetry responsible for the radiative origin of neutrino mass. We focus on\nsome of the implications of this proposal as realized within the\nsinglet-triplet scotogenic dark matter model.We identify consistent parameter\nsets consistent both with neutrino mass and the observed dark matter abundance.\nFinally we characterize the expected phenomenological profile of heavy Higgs\nboson physics at the LHC as well as at future linear Colliders.\n", "  In solid state conductors, linear response to a steady electric field is\nnormally dominated by Bloch state occupation number changes that are correlated\nwith group velocity and lead to a steady state current. However, for a number\nof important physical observables, the most important response even in\nconductors can be electric-field induced coherence between Bloch states in\ndifferent bands, such as that responsible for screening in dielectrics.\nExamples include the anomalous and spin-Hall effects, spin torques, minimum\nconductivities and the chiral anomaly. In this paper we present a general\nquantum kinetic theory of linear response to an electric field which can be\napplied to solids with arbitrarily complicated band structures and includes the\ninter-band coherence response and the Bloch-state repopulation responses on an\nequal footing. We aim to enable extensive transport theory applications using\ncomputational packages based on maximally localized Wannier functions. The\nformalism is based on density-matrix equations of motion, on a Born\napproximation treatment of disorder, and on an expansion in scattering rate to\nleading non-trivial order. The quasiparticle bands are treated in a completely\ngeneral manner that allows for arbitrary forms of the spin-orbit interaction\nand for the broken time reversal symmetry of magnetic conductors. We\ndemonstrate that the inter-band response in conductors consists primarily of\ntwo terms: an intrinsic contribution due to the entire Fermi sea that captures\nthe Berry curvature contribution to wave-packet dynamics, and an anomalous\ncontribution caused by scattering that is sensitive to the presence of the\nFermi surface. We solve for some electric-field response properties of simple\nmodel systems that are known to be dominated by interband coherence\ncontributions and discuss an extensive list of complicated problems that cannot\nbe solved analytically.\n", "  In quantum lattice systems with geometric frustration, particles cannot move\ncoherently due to destructive interference between tunnelling processes. Here\nwe show that purely local, Markovian dissipation can induce mobility and\nlong-range first-order coherence in frustrated lattice systems that is entirely\ngenerated by incoherent processes. Interactions reduce the coherences and\nmobility but do not destroy them. These effects are observable in experimental\nimplementations of driven-dissipative lattices with a flat band and non-uniform\ndissipation.\n", "  Sequential traces of user data are frequently observed online and offline,\ne.g., as sequences of visited websites or as sequences of locations captured by\nGPS. However, understanding factors explaining the production of sequence data\nis a challenging task, especially since the data generation is often not\nhomogeneous. For example, navigation behavior might change in different phases\nof browsing a website, or movement behavior may vary between groups of users.\nIn this work, we tackle this task and propose MixedTrails, a Bayesian approach\nfor comparing the plausibility of hypotheses regarding the generative processes\nof heterogeneous sequence data. Each hypothesis is derived from existing\nliterature, theory or intuition and represents a belief about transition\nprobabilities between a set of states that can vary between groups of observed\ntransitions. For example, when trying to understand human movement in a city\nand given some observed data, a hypothesis assuming tourists to be more likely\nto move towards points of interests than locals, can be shown to be more\nplausible than a hypothesis assuming the opposite. Our approach incorporates\nsuch hypotheses as Bayesian priors in a generative mixed transition Markov\nchain model, and compares their plausibility utilizing Bayes factors. We\ndiscuss analytical and approximate inference methods for calculating the\nmarginal likelihoods for Bayes factors, give guidance on interpreting the\nresults, and illustrate our approach with several experiments on synthetic and\nempirical data from Wikipedia and Flickr. Thus, this work enables a novel kind\nof analysis for studying sequential data in many application areas.\n", "  Although single and two-qubit gates are sufficient for universal quantum\ncomputation, single-shot three-qubit gates greatly simplify quantum error\ncorrection schemes and algorithms. We design fast, high-fidelity three-qubit\nentangling gates based on microwave pulses for transmon qubits coupled through\na superconducting resonator. We show that when interqubit frequency differences\nare comparable to single-qubit anharmonicities, errors occur primarily through\na single unwanted transition. This feature enables the design of fast\nthree-qubit gates based on simple analytical pulse shapes that are engineered\nto minimize such errors. We show that a three-qubit ccz gate can be performed\nin 260 ns with fidelities exceeding $99.38\\%$, or $99.99\\%$ with numerical\noptimization.\n", "  Rotating the magnetization of a shape anisotropic magnetostrictive nanomagnet\nwith voltage-generated stress/strain dissipates much less energy than most\nother magnetization rotation schemes, but its application to writing bits in\nnon-volatile magnetic memory has been hindered by the fundamental inability of\nstress/strain to rotate magnetization by full 180 degrees. Normally,\nstress/strain can rotate the magnetization of a shape anisotropic elliptical\nnanomagnet by only up to 90 degrees, resulting in incomplete magnetization\nreversal. Recently, we predicted that applying uniaxial stress sequentially\nalong two different axes that are not collinear with the major or minor axis of\nthe elliptical nanomagnet will rotate the magnetization by full 180 degrees.\nHere, we demonstrate this complete 180 degree rotation in elliptical\nCo-nanomagnets (fabricated on a piezoelectric substrate) at room temperature.\nThe two stresses are generated by sequentially applying voltages to two pairs\nof shorted electrodes placed on the substrate such that the line joining the\ncenters of the electrodes in one pair intersects the major axis of a nanomagnet\nat ~+30 degrees and the line joining the centers of the electrodes in the other\npair intersects at ~ -30 degrees. A finite element analysis has been performed\nto determine the stress distribution underneath the nanomagnets when one or\nboth pairs of electrodes are activated, and this has been approximately\nincorporated into a micromagnetic simulation of magnetization dynamics to\nconfirm that the generated stress can produce the observed magnetization\nrotations. This result portends an extremely energy-efficient non-volatile\n\"straintronic\" memory technology predicated on writing bits in nanomagnets with\nelectrically generated stress.\n", "  We demonstrate the emergence of an entire flat band embedded in dispersive\nbands at the exceptional point of a PT symmetric photonic lattice. For this to\noccur, the gain and loss parameter effectively alters the size of the partial\nflat band windows and band gap of the photonic lattice simultaneously. The mode\nassociated with the entire flat band is robust against changes in the system\nsize and survives even at the edge of the lattice. Our proposal offers a route\nfor controllable localization of light in non-Hermitian systems and a technique\nfor measuring non-Hermiticity via localization.\n", "  The spin-boson model describes a qubit coupled to a bosonic bath in thermal\nequilibrium, and is applicable to a wide range of physical contexts. We show\nthat two weak conditions for the qubit evolution to be Markovian (decreasing\nsystem distinguishability and divisibility) are violated at all times t>0,\nexcept for a measure-zero set of model parameters. Thus, the recently\nidentified phenomenon of `eternal non-Markovianity' is generic for the\nspin-boson model. Moreover, there can never be more than one strictly positive\ndecoherence rate, even in the Markovian regime. The main result relies on a\nrecent derivation of the exact form of the master equation. We also show that\napproximations of the spin-boson model in the literature need not exhibit\ngeneric eternal non-Markovianity, indicating the presence of corresponding\ninherent `Markovian' assumptions.\n", "  An essential step in quantum key distribution is the estimation of parameters\nrelated to the leaked amount of information, which is usually done by sampling\nof the communication data. When the data size is finite, the final key rate\ndepends on how the estimation process handles statistical fluctuations. Many of\nthe present security analyses are based on the method with simple random\nsampling, where hypergeometric distribution or its known bounds are used for\nthe estimation. Here we propose a concise method based on Bernoulli sampling,\nwhich is related to binomial distribution. Our method is suitable for the BB84\nprotocol with weak coherent pulses, reducing the number of estimated parameters\nto achieve a higher key generation rate compared to the method with simple\nrandom sampling. We also applied the method to prove the security of the\ndifferential-quadrature-phase-shift (DQPS) protocol in the finite-key regime.\nThe result indicates that, the advantage of the DQPS protocol over the\nphase-encoding BB84 protocol in terms of the key rate, which was previously\nconfirmed in the asymptotic regime, persists in the finite-key regime.\n", "  We investigate how next-generation laser pulses at 10 PW $-$ 200 PW interact\nwith a solid target in the presence of a relativistically underdense preplasma\nproduced by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Laser hole boring and\nrelativistic transparency are strongly restrained due to the generation of\nelectron-positron pairs and $\\gamma$-ray photons via quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) processes. A pair plasma with a density above the initial preplasma\ndensity is formed, counteracting the electron-free channel produced by the hole\nboring. This pair-dominated plasma can block the laser transport and trigger an\navalanche-like QED cascade, efficiently transfering the laser energy to\nphotons. This renders a 1-$\\rm\\mu m$-scalelength, underdense preplasma\ncompletely opaque to laser pulses at this power level. The QED-induced opacity\ntherefore sets much higher contrast requirements for such pulse in solid-target\nexperiments than expected by classical plasma physics. Our simulations show for\nexample, that proton acceleration from the rear of a solid with a preplasma\nwould be strongly impaired.\n", "  In the present work, we aim at taking a step towards the spectral stability\nanalysis of Peregrine solitons, i.e., wave structures that are used to emulate\nextreme wave events. Given the space-time localized nature of Peregrine\nsolitons, this is a priori a non-trivial task. Our main tool in this effort\nwill be the study of the spectral stability of the periodic generalization of\nthe Peregrine soliton in the evolution variable, namely the Kuznetsov--Ma\nbreather. Given the periodic structure of the latter, we compute the\ncorresponding Floquet multipliers, and examine them in the limit where the\nperiod of the orbit tends to infinity. This way, we extrapolate towards the\nstability of the limiting structure, namely the Peregrine soliton. We find that\nmultiple unstable modes of the background are enhanced, yet no additional\nunstable eigenmodes arise as the Peregrine limit is approached. We explore the\ninstability evolution also in direct numerical simulations.\n", "  A quantum hydrodynamic model is used to study the edge modes of chiral Berry\nplasmons. The transcendental equation of the dispersion relation is solved\nnonlinearly and semi-analytically. We predict a new one-way chiral edge state\nwith the quantum effect compared to that without the quantum effect, at the\nboth side of $q=0$. Indeed, the plasmon frequencies for positive and negative\n$q$, exhibit different limits for $q\\rightarrow 0^{-}$ and $q\\rightarrow\n0^{+}$. As a result, the quantum effect enhances the chirality in the vicinity\nof $q=0$. Both counterpropagating edge modes exhibit greater confinement to the\nedge with the quantum effect. In addition, new localized edge modes are found\nwith increased Berry flux in both cases, i.e., without and with the quantum\neffect.\n", "  We study charge and spin transport along grain boundaries in single layer\ngraphene in the presence of a quantizing magnetic field. Transport states in a\ngrain boundary are produced by hybridization of Landau zero modes with\ninterfacial states. In selected energy regimes quantum Hall edge states can be\ndeflected either fully or partially into grain boundary states. The degree of\nedge state deflection is studied in the nonlocal conductance and in the shot\nnoise. We also consider the possibility of grain boundaries as gate-switchable\nspin filters, a functionality enabled by counterpropagating transport channels\nlaterally confined in the grain boundary.\n", "  There has been a surge of recent interest in the role of anisotropy in\ninteraction-induced phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) charged carrier systems.\nA fundamental question is how an anisotropy in the energy-band structure of the\ncarriers at zero magnetic field affects the properties of the interacting\nparticles at high fields, in particular of the composite fermions (CFs) and the\nfractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs). We demonstrate here tunable anisotropy\nfor holes and hole-flux CFs confined to GaAs quantum wells, via applying\n\\textit{in situ} in-plane strain and measuring their Fermi wavevector\nanisotropy through commensurability oscillations. For strains on the order of\n$10^{-4}$ we observe significant deformations of the shapes of the Fermi\ncontours for both holes and CFs. The measured Fermi contour anisotropy for CFs\nat high magnetic field ($\\alpha_\\mathrm{CF}$) is less than the anisotropy of\ntheir low-field hole (fermion) counterparts ($\\alpha_\\mathrm{F}$), and closely\nfollows the relation: $\\alpha_\\mathrm{CF} = \\sqrt{\\alpha_\\mathrm{F}}$. The\nenergy gap measured for the $\\nu = 2/3$ FQHS, on the other hand, is nearly\nunaffected by the Fermi contour anisotropy up to $\\alpha_\\mathrm{F} \\sim 3.3$,\nthe highest anisotropy achieved in our experiments.\n", "  The new generation of powerful instruments is reaching sensitivities and\ntemporal resolutions that will allow multi-messenger astronomy of explosive\ntransient phenomena, with high-energy neutrinos as a central figure. We derive\ngeneral criteria for the detectability of neutrinos from powerful transient\nsources, for given instrument sensitivities. In practice, we provide the\nminimal photon flux necessary for neutrino detection based on two main\nobservables, the bolometric luminosity and the time variability of the\nemission. This limit can be compared to the observations in specified\nwavelengths in order to target the most promising sources for follow-ups. Our\ncriteria can also help discriminating false associations of neutrino events\nwith a flaring source. We find that relativistic transient sources such as\nHigh- and Low-Luminosity GRBs, Blazar flares, Tidal Disruption Events and\nmagnetar flares could be observed with IceCube, as they have a good chance to\noccur within a detectable distance. Among non-relativistic transient sources,\nonly luminous supernovae appear as promising candidates. We caution that our\ncriterion should not be directly applied to low-luminosity GRBs and Type Ibc\nsupernovae, as these objects could have hosted a choked GRB, leading to\nneutrino emission without a relevant counterpart radiation. We treat a set of\nconcrete examples and show that several transients, some of which are being\nmonitored by IceCube, are far from meeting the criterion for detectability\n(e.g., Crab flares or Swift J1644+57).\n", "  We continue a previous study about the infrared loop effects in the\n$D$-dimensional de Sitter space for a real scalar $\\phi^4$ theory from the\ncomplementary series whose bare mass belongs to the interval\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\, \\left(D-1\\right) < m \\leq \\frac{D-1}{2}$, in units of the\nHubble scale. The lower bound comes from the appearance of discrete states in\nthe mass spectrum of the theory when that bound is violated, causing large IR\nloop effects in the vertices. We derive an equation which allows to perform a\nself--consistent resummation of the leading IR contributions from all loops to\nthe two-point correlation functions in an expanding Poincar\\'{e} patch of the\nde Sitter manifold. The resummation can be done for density perturbations of\nthe Bunch--Davies state which violate the de Sitter isometry. There exist\nsolutions having a singular (exploding) behavior and therefore the backreaction\ncan change the de Sitter geometry.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the $D^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^- \\ell\\bar\\nu$ and\n$\\bar D^0\\to \\pi^+\\pi^0 \\ell\\bar\\nu$ decays. We construct a general angular\ndistribution which can include arbitrary partial waves of $\\pi\\pi$. Retaining\nthe S-wave and P-wave contributions we study the branching ratios,\nforward--backward asymmetries and a few other observables. The P-wave\ncontribution is dominated by $\\rho^0$ resonance, and the S-wave contribution is\nanalyzed using the unitarized chiral perturbation theory. The obtained\nbranching fraction for $D\\to \\rho\\ell\\nu$, at the order $10^{-3}$, is\nconsistent with the available experimental data. The S-wave contribution has a\nbranching ratio at the order of $10^{-4}$, and this prediction can be tested by\nexperiments like BESIII and LHCb. Future measurements can also be used to\nexamine the $\\pi$--$\\pi$ scattering phase shift.\n", "  We analyze the phenomenon of size-flow transmutation in ultrarelativistic\nnuclear collisions in a model where the initial size fluctuations are driven by\nthe wounded quarks and the collectivity is provided by viscous hydrodynamics.\nIt is found that the model properly reproduces the data for the transverse\nmomentum fluctuations measured for Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76TeV by the ALICE\nCollaboration. The agreement holds for a remarkably wide range of centralities,\nfrom 0-5% up to 70-80%, and displays a departure from a simple scaling with\n$(dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta)^{1/2}$ in the form seen in the data. The overall agreement\nin the model with wounded quarks is significantly better than with nucleon\nparticipants. This feature joins the previously-found wounded quark\nmultiplicity scaling in the argumentation in favor of subnucleonic degrees of\nfreedom in the early dynamics. We also examine in detail the correlations\nbetween measures of the initial size and final average transverse momentum of\nhadrons. Predictions are made for the transverse momentum fluctuations in p+Pb\ncollisions at 5.02TeV.\n", "  Using the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha (PMODLH) 13.7 m telescope, we\nreport a 96-square-degree 12CO/13CO/C18O mapping observation toward the\nGalactic region of l = [139.75, 149.75]$^\\circ$, b = [-5.25, 5.25]$^\\circ$. The\nmolecular structure of the Local Arm and Perseus Arm are presented. Combining\nHI data and part of the Outer Arm results, we obtain that the warp structure of\nboth atomic and molecular gas is obvious, while the flare structure only exists\nin atomic gas in this observing region. In addition, five filamentary giant\nmolecular clouds on the Perseus Arm are identified. Among them, four are newly\nidentified. Their relations with the Milky Way large-scale structure are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider evolving networks in which each node can have various associated\nproperties (a state) in addition to those that arise from network structure.\nFor example, each node can have a spatial location and a velocity, or some more\nabstract internal property that describes something like social trait. Edges\nbetween nodes are created and destroyed, and new nodes enter the system. We\nintroduce a \"local state degree distribution\" (LSDD) as the degree distribution\nat a particular point in state space. We then make a mean-field assumption and\nthereby derive an integro-partial differential equation that is satisfied by\nthe LSDD. We perform numerical experiments and find good agreement between\nsolutions of the integro-differential equation and the LSDD from stochastic\nsimulations of the full model. To illustrate our theory, we apply it to a\nsimple continuum model for osteocyte network formation within bones, with a\nview to understanding changes that may take place during cancer. Our results\nsuggest that increased rates of differentiation lead to higher densities of\nosteocytes but with a lower number of dendrites. To help provide biological\ncontext, we also include an introduction to osteocytes, the formation of\nosteocyte networks, and the role of osteocytes in bona metastasis.\n", "  The cold curves for energy and pressure of Copper, Iron, and Tantalum were\nobtained using methods of the density functional theory. We consider\nhydrostatic and uniaxial deformations in the range from double compression of\nthe initial volume per atom to double stretching. The presence of allotropic\ntransformation from $\\alpha$ - phase of Iron to the hexaferrum with the growth\nof pressure is observed. In the case of hydrostatic deformations we also have\nobtained analogous cold curves, but with non-zero electronic temperatures in\nthe range up to 5 eV. The similar volume and electronic temperature ranges have\nbeen considered recently. The behavior of electronic internal energy, pressure,\nand density of states was investigated in the volume and temperature ranges\ncalled above. The maximum hydrostatic strains and the types of lattice\ninstabilities were theoretically predicted for the considered metals. The\ninfluence of high electronic temperature on the electronic heat conductivity\nand electric resistivity has been provided for d-band metals by the approach\nbased on the solution of Boltzmann kinetic equation in $\\tau$-approximation.\nThis data is compared with the results of quantum molecular dynamics for Gold.\n", "  The optical and UV emission from sub-parsec massive black hole binaries\n(MBHBs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is believed to vary periodically, on\ntimescales comparable to the binary's orbital time. If driven by accretion rate\nfluctuations, the variability could be isotropic. If dominated by relativistic\nDoppler modulation, the variability should instead be anisotropic, resembling a\nrotating forward-beamed lighthouse. We consider the infrared (IR) reverberation\nof either type of periodic emission by pc-scale circumbinary dust tori. We\npredict the phase and amplitude of IR variability as a function of the ratio of\ndust light crossing time to the source variability period, and of the torus\ninclination and opening angle. We enumerate several differences between the\nisotropic and anisotropic cases. Interestingly, for a nearly face-on binary\nwith an inclined dust torus, the Doppler boost can produce IR variability\nwithout any observable optical/UV variability. Such orphan-IR variability would\nhave been missed in optical searches for periodic AGN. We apply our models to\ntime-domain WISE IR data from the MBHB candidate PG 1302-102 and find\nconsistency with dust reverberation by both isotropically emitting and\nDoppler-boosted sources in the shorter wavelength W1-W2 (2.8-5.3 micrometer)\nbands. We constrain the dust torus to be thin (aspect ratio ~0.1), with an\ninner radius at 1-5 pc. More generally, our dust echo models will aid in\nidentifying new MBHB candidates, determining their nature, and constraining the\nphysical properties of MBHBs and their dust tori.\n", "  We study the effects of local perturbations on the dynamics of disordered\nfermionic systems in order to characterize time-irreversibility. We focus on\nthree different systems, the non-interacting Anderson and Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper\n(AAH-) models, and the interacting spinless disordered t-V chain. First, we\nconsider the effect on the full many-body wave-functions by measuring the\nLoschmidt echo (LE). We show that in the extended/ergodic phase the LE decays\nexponentially fast with time, while in the localized phase the decay is\nalgebraic. We demonstrate that the exponent of the decay of the LE in the\nlocalized phase diverges proportionally to the single-particle localization\nlength as we approach the metal-insulator transition in the AAH model. Second,\nwe probe different phases of disordered systems by studying the time\nexpectation value of local observables evolved with two Hamiltonians that\ndiffer by a spatially local perturbation. Remarkably, we find that many-body\nlocalized systems could lose memory of the initial state in the long-time\nlimit, in contrast to the non-interacting localized phase where some memory is\nalways preserved.\n", "  In this paper, we construct and study solutions of Einstein's equations in\nvacuum with a positive cosmological constant which can be considered as\ninhomogeneous generalizations of the Nariai cosmological model. Similar to this\nNariai spacetime, our solutions are at the borderline between gravitational\ncollapse and de-Sitter-like exponential expansion. Our studies focus in\nparticular on the intriguing oscillatory dynamics which we discover. Our\ninvestigations are carried out both analytically (using heuristic mode analysis\narguments) and numerically (using the numerical infrastructure recently\nintroduced by us).\n", "  Quantum entanglement between distant qubits is an important feature of\nquantum networks. Distribution of entanglement over long distances can be\nenabled through coherently interfacing qubit pairs via photonic channels. Here,\nwe report the realization of optically generated quantum entanglement between\nelectron spin qubits confined in two distant semiconductor quantum dots. The\nprotocol relies on spin-photon entanglement in the trionic $\\Lambda$-system and\nquantum erasure of the Raman-photon path. The measurement of a single Raman\nphoton is used to project the spin qubits into a joint quantum state with an\ninterferometrically stabilized and tunable relative phase. We report an average\nBell-state fidelity for $|\\psi^{(+)}\\rangle$ and $|\\psi^{(-)}\\rangle$ states of\n$61.6\\pm2.3\\%$ and a record-high entanglement generation rate of 7.3 kHz\nbetween distant qubits.\n", "  We explore the potential for the discovery of the triple-Higgs signal in the\n$2b2l^{\\pm}4j+E\\!\\!\\!/$ decay channel at a $100$ TeV hadron collider. We\nconsider both the Standard Model and generic new-physics contributions,\ndescribed by an effective Lagrangian that includes higher-dimensional\noperators. The selected subset of operators is motivated by composite-Higgs and\nHiggs-inflation models. In the Standard Model, we perform both a parton-level\nand a detector-level analysis. Although the parton-level results are\nencouraging, the detector-level results demonstrate that this mode will be\nreally challenging. However, sizable contributions from new effective operators\ncan largely increase the cross section and/or modify the kinematics of the\nHiggs bosons in the final state. Taking into account the projected constraints\nfrom single and double Higgs-boson production, we propose benchmark points in\nthe new physics models for the measurement of the triple-Higgs boson final\nstate for future collider projects.\n", "  We statistically evaluate the relative orientation between gas column density\nstructures, inferred from Herschel submillimetre observations, and the magnetic\nfield projected on the plane of sky, inferred from polarized thermal emission\nof Galactic dust observed by BLASTPol at 250, 350, and 500 micron, towards the\nVela C molecular complex. First, we find very good agreement between the\npolarization orientations in the three wavelength-bands, suggesting that, at\nthe considered common angular resolution of 3.0 arcminutes that corresponds to\na physical scale of approximately 0.61 pc, the inferred magnetic field\norientation is not significantly affected by temperature or dust grain\nalignment effects. Second, we find that the relative orientation between gas\ncolumn density structures and the magnetic field changes progressively with\nincreasing gas column density, from mostly parallel or having no preferred\norientation at low column densities to mostly perpendicular at the highest\ncolumn densities. This observation is in agreement with previous studies by the\nPlanck collaboration towards more nearby molecular clouds. Finally, we find a\ncorrespondence between the trends in relative orientation and the shape of the\ncolumn density probability distribution functions. In the sub-regions of Vela C\ndominated by one clear filamentary structure, or \"ridges\", we find a sharp\ntransition from preferentially parallel or having no preferred relative\norientation at low column densities to preferentially perpendicular at highest\ncolumn densities. In the sub-regions of Vela C dominated by several filamentary\nstructures with multiple orientations, or \"nests\", such a transition is also\npresent, but it is clearly less sharp than in the ridge-like sub-regions. Both\nof these results suggest that the magnetic field is dynamically important for\nthe formation of density structures in this region.\n", "  A few approximate schemes to solve the Hedin equations self-consistently\nintroduced in (Phys. Rev. B 94, 155101 (2016)) are explored and tested for the\n3D electron gas at metallic densities. We calculate one electron spectra,\ndielectric properties, compressibility, and correlation energy. Considerable\nreduction in the calculated band width (as compared to the self consistent GW\nresult) has been found when vertex correction was used for both polarizability\nand self energy. Generally, it is advantageous to obtain the diagrammatic\nrepresentation of polarizability from the definition of this quantity as a\nfunctional derivative of the electronic density with respect to the total field\n(external plus induced). For self energy, the first order vertex correction\nseems to be sufficient for the range of densities considered. Whenever it is\npossible, we compare the accuracy of our vertex-corrected schemes with the\naccuracy of the self-consistent quasi-particle GW approximation (QSGW), which\nis less expensive computationally. We show that QSGW approach performs poorly\nand we relate this poor performance with an inaccurate description of the\nscreening in the QSGW method (with an error comprising a factor 2-3 in the\nphysically important range of momenta).\n", "  BaBiO3 is a well-known example of a 3D charge density wavecompound, in which\nthe CDW behavior is induced by charge disproportionation at the Bi site. At\nambient pressure, this compound is a charge-ordered insulator, but little is\nknown about its high-pressure behavior. In this work, we study from\nfirst-principles the high-pressure phase diagram of BaBiO3 using phonon modes\nanalysis and evolutionary crystal structure prediction. We show that charge\ndisproportionation is very robust in this compound and persists up to 100 GPa.\nThis causes the system to remain insulating up to the highest pressure we\nstudied.\n", "  We present the first extensive spectroscopic study of the global population\nin star clusters Trumpler~16, Trumpler~14 and Collinder~232 in the Carina\nNebula, using data from the Gaia-ESO Survey, down to solar-mass stars. In\naddition to the standard homogeneous Survey data reduction, a special\nprocessing was applied here because of the bright nebulosity surrounding Carina\nstars. We find about four hundred good candidate members ranging from OB types\ndown to slightly sub-solar masses. About one-hundred heavily-reddened\nearly-type Carina members found here were previously unrecognized or poorly\nclassified, including two candidate O stars and several candidate Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Their large brightness makes them useful tracers of the obscured Carina\npopulation. The spectroscopically-derived temperatures for nearly 300 low-mass\nmembers allows the inference of individual extinction values, and the study of\nthe relative placement of stars along the line of sight. We find a complex\nspatial structure, with definite clustering of low-mass members around the most\nmassive stars, and spatially-variable extinction. By combining the new data\nwith existing X-ray data we obtain a more complete picture of the\nthree-dimensional spatial structure of the Carina clusters, and of their\nconnection to bright and dark nebulosity, and UV sources. The identification of\ntens of background giants enables us also to determine the total optical depth\nof the Carina nebula along many sightlines. We are also able to put constraints\non the star-formation history of the region, with Trumpler~14 stars found to be\nsystematically younger than stars in other sub-clusters. We find a large\npercentage of fast-rotating stars among Carina solar-mass members, which\nprovide new constraints on the rotational evolution of pre-main-sequence stars\nin this mass range.\n", "  We propose to use a dissipatively engineered nitrogen vacancy (NV) center as\na mediator of interaction between two nuclear spins that are protected from\ndecoherence and relaxation of the NV. Under ambient conditions this scheme\nachieves highly selective high-fidelity quantum gates between nuclear spins in\na quantum register even at large NV-nuclear distances. Importantly, this method\nallows for the use of nuclear spins as a sensor rather than a memory, while the\nNV spin acts as an ancillary system for the initialization and read out of the\nsensor. The immunity to the decoherence and relaxation of the NV center leads\nto a tunable sharp frequency filter while allowing at the same time the\ncontinuous collection of the signal to achieve simultaneously high spectral\nselectivity and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\n", "  We use the poor man's scaling approach to study the phase boundaries of a\npair of quantum impurity models featuring a power-law density of states\n$\\rho(\\omega)\\propto|\\omega|^r$ that gives rise to quantum phase transitions\nbetween local-moment and Kondo-screened phases. For the Anderson model with a\npseudogap (i.e., $r>0$), we find the phase boundary for (a) $0<r<1/2$, a range\nover which the model exhibits interacting quantum critical points both at and\naway from particle-hole symmetry, and (b) $r>1$, where the phases are separated\nby first-order quantum phase transitions. For the particle-hole-symmetric Kondo\nmodel with easy-axis or easy-plane anisotropy of the spin exchange, the phase\nboundary and scaling trajectories are obtained for both $r>0$ and $r<0$ (the\nlater case describing a density of states that diverges at the Fermi energy).\nComparison with nonperturbative results from the numerical renormalization\ngroup shows that poor man's scaling correctly describes the shape of phase\nboundaries expressed as functional relations between model parameters.\n", "  Electron dynamics surrounding the X-line in magnetopause-type asymmetric\nreconnection is investigated using a two-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulation. We study electron properties of three characteristic regions in the\nvicinity of the X-line. The fluid properties, velocity distribution functions\n(VDFs), and orbits are studied and cross-compared. On the magnetospheric side\nof the X-line, the normal electric field enhances the electron meandering\nmotion from the magnetosheath side. The motion leads to a crescent-shaped\ncomponent in the electron VDF, in agreement with recent studies. On the\nmagnetosheath side of the X-line, the magnetic field line is so stretched in\nthe third dimension that its curvature radius is comparable with typical\nelectron Larmor radius. The electron motion becomes nonadiabatic, and therefore\nthe electron idealness is no longer expected to hold. Around the middle of the\noutflow regions, the electron nonidealness is coincident with the region of the\nnonadiabatic motion. Finally, we introduce a finite-time mixing fraction (FTMF)\nto evaluate electron mixing. The FTMF marks the magnetospheric side of the\nX-line, where the nonideal energy dissipation occurs.\n", "  We study the behaviour of the Uhlmann connection in systems of fermions\nundergoing phase transitions. In particular, we analyse some of the\nparadigmatic cases of topological insulators and superconductors in dimension\none, as well as the BCS theory of superconductivity in three dimensions. We\nshow that the Uhlmann connection signals phase transitions in which the\neigenbasis of the state of the system changes. Moreover, using the established\nfidelity approach and the study of the edge states, we show the absence of\nthermally driven phase transitions in the case of topological insulators and\nsuperconductors. We clarify what is the relevant parameter space associated\nwith the Uhlmann connection so that it signals the existence of order in mixed\nstates.\n", "  Anomalies in the abundance measurements of short lived radionuclides in\nmeteorites indicate that the protosolar nebulae was irradiated by a high amount\nof energetic particles (E$\\gtrsim$10 MeV). The particle flux of the\ncontemporary Sun cannot explain these anomalies. However, similar to T Tauri\nstars the young Sun was more active and probably produced enough high energy\nparticles to explain those anomalies. We want to study the interaction of\nstellar energetic particles with the gas component of the disk and identify\npossible observational tracers of this interaction. We use a 2D radiation\nthermo-chemical protoplanetary disk code to model a disk representative for T\nTauri stars. We use a particle energy distribution derived from solar flare\nobservations and an enhanced stellar particle flux proposed for T Tauri stars.\nFor this particle spectrum we calculate the stellar particle ionization rate\nthroughout the disk with an accurate particle transport model. We study the\nimpact of stellar particles for models with varying X-ray and cosmic-ray\nionization rates. We find that stellar particle ionization has a significant\nimpact on the abundances of the common disk ionization tracers HCO$^+$ and\nN$_2$H$^+$, especially in models with low cosmic-ray ionization rates. In\ncontrast to cosmic rays and X-rays, stellar particles cannot reach the midplane\nof the disk. Therefore molecular ions residing in the disk surface layers are\nmore affected by stellar particle ionization than molecular ions tracing the\ncold layers/midplane of the disk. Spatially resolved observations of molecular\nions tracing different vertical layers of the disk allow to disentangle the\ncontribution of stellar particle ionization from other competing ionization\nsources. Modeling such observations with a model like the one presented here\nallows to constrain the stellar particle flux in disks around T Tauri stars.\n", "  For fluctuating currents in non-equilibrium steady states, the recently\ndiscovered thermodynamic uncertainty relation expresses a fundamental relation\nbetween their variance and the overall entropic cost associated with the\ndriving. We show that this relation holds not only for the long-time limit of\nfluctuations, as described by large deviation theory, but also for fluctuations\non arbitrary finite time scales. This generalization facilitates applying the\nthermodynamic uncertainty relation to single molecule experiments, for which\ninfinite timescales are not accessible. Importantly, often this finite-time\nvariant of the relation allows inferring a bound on the entropy production that\nis even stronger than the one obtained from the long-time limit. We illustrate\nthe relation for the fluctuating work that is performed by a stochastically\nswitching laser tweezer on a trapped colloidal particle.\n", "  Context. In multiple pre-main-sequence systems the lifetime of circumstellar\ndisks appears to be shorter than around single stars, and the actual\ndissipation process may depend on the binary parameters of the systems. Aims.\nWe report high spatial resolution observations of multiple T Tauri systems at\noptical and infrared wavelengths. We determine if the components are\ngravitationally bound and orbital motion is visible, derive orbital parameters\nand investigate possible correlations between the binary parameters and disk\nstates. Methods. We selected 18 T Tau multiple systems (16 binary and two\ntriple systems, yielding $16 + 2\\times2=20$ binary pairs) in the Taurus-Auriga\nstar forming region from the survey by Leinert et al. (1993), with spectral\ntypes from K1 to M5 and separations from 0.22\" (31 AU) to 5.8\" (814 AU). We\nanalysed data acquired in 2006-07 at Calar Alto using the AstraLux lucky\nimaging system, along with data from SPHERE and NACO at the VLT, and from the\nliterature. Results. We found ten pairs to orbit each other, five pairs that\nmay show orbital motion and five likely common proper motion pairs. We found no\nobvious correlation between the stellar parameters and binary configuration.\nThe 10 $\\mu$m infra-red excess varies between 0.1 and 7.2 magnitudes (similar\nto the distribution in single stars, where it is between 1.7 and 9.1), implying\nthat the presence of the binary star does not greatly influence the emission\nfrom the inner disk. Conclusions. We have detected orbital motion in young T\nTauri systems over a timescale of $\\approx20$ years. Further observations with\neven longer temporal baseline will provide crucial information on the dynamics\nof these young stellar systems.\n", "  The properties of a bound electron system immersed in a plasma environment\nare strongly modified by the surrounding plasma. The modification of a basic\nquantity, the ionization energy, is described by the electronic self-energy and\nby dynamical screening within the framework of the quantum statistical theory.\nIntroducing the ionic dynamical structure factor as the indicator for the ionic\nmicro-field, we demonstrate that ionic correlations and fluctuations play a\ncritical role in determining the ionization potential depression. This is in\nparticular true for mixtures of different ions with large mass and charge\nasymmetry. The ionization potential depression is calculated for dense aluminum\nplasmas as well as for a CH plasma and compared to the experimental data and\nmore phenomenological approaches used so far.\n", "  The hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) permeating galaxy clusters and groups is\nnot pristine, as it is continuously enriched by metals synthesised in Type Ia\n(SNIa) and core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae since the major epoch of star\nformation (z ~ 2-3). The cluster/group enrichment history and the mechanisms\nresponsible for releasing and mixing the metals can be probed via the radial\ndistribution of SNIa and SNcc products within the ICM. In this paper, we use\ndeep XMM-Newton/EPIC observations from a sample of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy\nclusters, groups, and ellipticals (CHEERS) to constrain the average radial O,\nMg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni abundance profiles. The radial distributions of\nall these elements, averaged over a large sample for the first time, represent\nthe best constrained profiles available currently. We find an overall decrease\nof the Fe abundance with radius out to ~$0.9 r_{500}$ and ~$0.6 r_{500}$ for\nclusters and groups, respectively, in good agreement with predictions from the\nmost recent hydrodynamical simulations. The average radial profiles of all the\nother elements (X) are also centrally peaked and, when rescaled to their\naverage central X/Fe ratios, follow well the Fe profile out to at least\n~0.5$r_{500}$. Using two sets of SNIa and SNcc yield models reproducing well\nthe X/Fe abundance pattern in the core, we find that, as predicted by recent\nsimulations, the relative contribution of SNIa (SNcc) to the total ICM\nenrichment is consistent with being uniform at all radii, both for clusters and\ngroups. In addition to implying that the central metal peak is balanced between\nSNIa and SNcc, our results suggest that the enriching SNIa and SNcc products\nmust share the same origin, and that the delay between the bulk of the SNIa and\nSNcc explosions must be shorter than the timescale necessary to diffuse out the\nmetals.\n", "  Precision experiments, such as the search for electric dipole moments of\ncharged particles using storage rings, demand for an understanding of the spin\ndynamics with unprecedented accuracy. The ultimate aim is to measure the\nelectric dipole moments with a sensitivity up to 15 orders in magnitude better\nthan the magnetic dipole moment of the stored particles. This formidable task\nrequires an understanding of the background to the signal of the electric\ndipole from rotations of the spins in the spurious magnetic fields of a storage\nring. One of the observables, especially sensitive to the imperfection magnetic\nfields in the ring is the angular orientation of stable spin axis. Up to now,\nthe stable spin axis has never been determined experimentally, and in addition,\nthe JEDI collaboration for the first time succeeded to quantify the background\nsignals that stem from false rotations of the magnetic dipole moments in the\nhorizontal and longitudinal imperfection magnetic fields of the storage ring.\nTo this end, we developed a new method based on the spin tune response of a\nmachine to artificially applied longitudinal magnetic fields. This novel\ntechnique, called \\textit{spin tune mapping}, emerges as a very powerful tool\nto probe the spin dynamics in storage rings. The technique was experimentally\ntested in 2014 at the cooler synchrotron COSY, and for the first time, the\nangular orientation of the stable spin axis at two different locations in the\nring has been determined to an unprecedented accuracy of better than\n$2.8\\mu$rad.\n", "  High-resolution imaging reveals a large morphological variety of\nprotoplanetary disks. To date, no constraints on their global evolution have\nbeen found from this census. An evolutionary classification of disks was\nproposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I\nsources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of\nevolution than Group II. Disk evolution can be constrained from the comparison\nof disks with different properties. A first attempt of disk taxonomy is now\npossible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig\nAe/Be stars becoming available. Near-IR images of six Group II disks in\nscattered light were obtained with VLT/NACO in Polarimetric Differential\nImaging, which is the most efficient technique to image the light scattered by\nthe disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties of\nthis sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the\nliterature. Three Group II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in\nthe disk of HD163296 indicates the presence of a persistent ring-like structure\nwith a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact (less than\n100 AU) disk is detected around HD142666 and AK Sco. A taxonomic analysis of 17\nHerbig Ae/Be sources reveals that the difference between Group I and Group II\nis due to the presence or absence of a large disk cavity (larger than 5 AU).\nThere is no evidence supporting the evolution from Group I to Group II. Group\nII are not evolved version of the Group I. Within the Group II disks, very\ndifferent geometries (both self-shadowed and compact) exist. HD163296 could be\nthe primordial version of a typical Group I. Other Group II, like AK Sco and\nHD142666, could be smaller counterpart of Group I unable to open cavities as\nlarge as those of Group I.\n", "  A theoretical model for high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in bulk solids\nis considered. Our approach treats laser-induced inter- and intraband currents\non an equal footing. The sum of these currents is the source of the high-order\nharmonic radiation, and does not depend on the particular electromagnetic gauge\nwe choose to describe the process. On the other hand, as it is shown using\nanalytic and numerical calculations, the distinction between intra- and\ninterband dynamics is gauge dependent, implying that the interpretation of the\nprocess of HHG using these terms requires carefulness.\n", "  We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 5 science\nverification observations of the red supergiant VY CMa to study the\npolarization of SiO thermal/masers lines and dust continuum at ~1.7 mm\nwavelength. We analyse both linear and circular polarization and derive the\nmagnetic field strength and structure, assuming the polarization of the lines\noriginates from the Zeeman effect, and that of the dust originates from aligned\ndust grains. We also discuss other effects that could give rise to the observed\npolarization.\n  We detect, for the first time, significant polarization (~3%) of the\ncircumstellar dust emission at millimeter wavelengths. The polarization is\nuniform with an electric vector position angle of $\\sim8^\\circ$. Varying levels\nof linear polarization are detected for the J=4-3 28SiO v=0, 1, 2, and 29SiO\nv=0, 1 lines, with the strongest polarization fraction of ~30% found for the\n29SiO v=1 maser. The linear polarization vectors rotate with velocity,\nconsistent with earlier observations. We also find significant (up to ~1%)\ncircular polarization in several lines, consistent with previous measurements.\nWe conclude that the detection is robust against calibration and regular\ninstrumental errors, although we cannot yet fully rule out non-standard\ninstrumental effects.\n  Emission from magnetically aligned grains is the most likely origin of the\nobserved continuum polarization. This implies that the dust is embedded in a\nmagnetic field >13 mG. The maser line polarization traces the magnetic field\nstructure. The magnetic field in the gas and dust is consistent with an\napproximately toroidal field configuration, but only higher angular resolution\nobservations will be able to reveal more detailed field structure. If the\ncircular polarization is due to Zeeman splitting, it indicates a magnetic field\nstrength of ~1-3 Gauss, consistent with previous maser observations.\n", "  We present a microscopic theory for the Raman response of a clean multiband\nsuperconductor accounting for the effects of vertex corrections and long-range\nCoulomb interaction. The measured Raman intensity, $R(\\Omega)$, is proportional\nto the imaginary part of the fully renormalized particle-hole correlator with\nRaman form-factors $\\gamma(\\vec k)$. In a BCS superconductor, a bare Raman\nbubble is non-zero for any $\\gamma(\\vec k)$ and diverges at $\\Omega = 2\\Delta\n+0$, where $\\Delta$ is the largest gap along the Fermi surface. However, for\n$\\gamma(\\vec k) =$ const, the full $R(\\Omega)$ is expected to vanish due to\nparticle number conservation. It was long thought that this vanishing is due to\nthe singular screening by long-range Coulomb interaction. We argue that this\nvanishing actually holds due to vertex corrections from the same short-range\ninteraction that gives rise to superconductivity. We further argue that\nlong-range Coulomb interaction does not affect the Raman signal for $any$\n$\\gamma(\\vec k)$. We argue that vertex corrections eliminate the divergence at\n$2\\Delta$ and replace it with a maximum at a somewhat larger frequency. We also\nargue that vertex corrections give rise to sharp peaks in $R(\\Omega)$ at\n$\\Omega < 2\\Delta$, when $\\Omega$ coincides with the frequency of one of\ncollective modes in a superconductor, e.g, Leggett mode, Bardasis-Schrieffer\nmode, or an excitonic mode.\n", "  The solar coronal heating problem is an open question since 1939. One\nproposed model for the transport and release of mechanical energy generated in\nthe sub-phorospheric layers and photosphere is the nanoflare model that\nincorporates Ohmic heating which releases a part of the energy stored in the\nmagnetic field via magnetic reconnection. The problem with the verification of\nthis model is that we cannot resolve observationally small scale events.\nHistograms of observable characteristics of flares, show powerlaw behavior, for\nboth energy release rate, size and total energy. Depending on the powerlaw\nindex of the energy release, nanoflares might be an important candidate for\ncoronal heating; we seek to find that index. In this paper, we employ a\nnumerical 3D-MHD simulation produced by the numerical code Bifrost, and a new\ntechnique to identify the 3D heating events at a specific instant. The quantity\nwe explore is the Joule heating, which is explicitly correlated with the\nmagnetic reconnection because depends on the curl of the magnetic field. We are\nable to identify 4136 events in a volume $24 \\times 24 \\times 9.5 \\\n\\textrm{Mm}^3$ (i.e. $768 \\times 786 \\times 331$ grid cells) of a specific\nsnapshot. We find a powerlaw slope of the released energy per second, and two\npowerlaw slopes of the identified volume. The identified energy events do not\nrepresent all the released energy, but of the identified events, the total\nenergy of the largest events dominate the energy release. Most of the energy\nrelease happens in the lower corona, while heating drops with height. We find\nthat with a specific identification method that large events can be resolved\ninto smaller ones, but at the expense of the total identified energy releases.\nThe energy release which cannot be identified as an event favours a low energy\nrelease mechanism.\n", "  Aims: In this paper we present a case study to investigate conditions\nnecessary to detect a characteristic magnetic field substructure embedded in a\nlarge-scale field. A helical magnetic field with a surrounding hourglass shaped\nfield is expected from theoretical predictions and self-consistent\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to be present in the specific case of\nprotostellar outflows. Hence, such an outflow environment is the perfect for\nour study. Methodes: We present synthetic polarisation maps in the infrared and\nmillimeter regime of protostellar outflows performed with the newly developed\nRT and polarisation code POLARIS. The code, as the first, includes a\nself-consistent description of various alignement mechanism like the imperfect\nDavis-Greenstein (IDG) and the radiative torque (RAT) alignment. We investigate\nfor which effects the grain size distribution, and applied alignement mechanism\nhave. Results: We find that the IDG mechanism cannot produce any measurable\npolarization degree (< 1 %) whereas RAT alignment produced polarization degrees\nof a few 1 %. Furthermore, we developed a method to identify the origin of the\npolarization. We show that the helical magnetic field in the outflow can only\nbe observed close to the outflow axis and at its tip, whereas in the\nsurrounding regions the hourglass field in the foreground dominates the\npolarization. Furthermore, the polarization degree in the outflow lobe is lower\nthan in the surroundings in agreement with observations. We also find that the\norientation of the polarization vector flips around a few 100 micron due to the\ntransition from dichroic extinction to thermal re-emission. Hence, in order to\navoid ambiguities when interpreting polarization data, we suggest to observed\nin the far-infrared and mm regime. Finally, we show that with ALMA it is\npossible to observe the polarization emerging from protostellar outflows.\n", "  The flow and deformation of macromolecules is ubiquitous in nature and\nindustry, and an understanding of this phenomenon at both macroscopic and\nmicroscopic length scales is of fundamental and practical importance. Here we\npresent the formulation of a general mathematical framework, which could be\nused to extract, from scattering experiments, the molecular relaxation of\ndeformed polymers. By combining and modestly extending several key conceptual\ningredients in the literature, we show how the anisotropic single-chain\nstructure factor can be decomposed by spherical harmonics and experimentally\nreconstructed from its cross sections on the scattering planes. The resulting\nwavenumber-dependent expansion coefficients constitute a characteristic\nfingerprint of the macromolecular deformation, permitting detailed examinations\nof polymer dynamics at the microscopic level. We apply this approach to survey\na long-standing problem in polymer physics regarding the molecular relaxation\nin entangled polymers after a large step deformation. The classical tube theory\nof Doi and Edwards predicts a fast chain retraction process immediately after\nthe deformation, followed by a slow orientation relaxation through the\nreptation mechanism. This chain retraction hypothesis, which is the keystone of\nthe tube theory for macromolecular flow and deformation, was critically\nexamined by analyzing the fine features of the two-dimensional anisotropic\nspectra from small-angle neutron scattering by entangled polystyrenes. It is\nshown that the unique scattering patterns associated with the chain retraction\nmechanism were not experimentally observed. This result calls for a fundamental\nrevision of the current theoretical picture for nonlinear rheological behavior\nof entangled polymeric liquids.\n", "  We grow nearly freestanding single-layer 1T'-WTe2 on graphitized 6H-SiC(0001)\nby using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and characterize its electronic\nstructure with scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy (STM/STS). We\ndemonstrate the existence of topological edge states at the periphery of\nsingle-layer WTe2 islands. Surprisingly, we also find a band gap in the bulk\nand the semiconducting behaviors of the single-layer WTe2 at low temperature,\nwhich is likely resulted from an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW)\ntransition. The realization of two-dimensional topological insulators (2D TIs)\nin single-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) thus provides a promising\nplatform for further exploration of the 2D TIs' physics and related\napplications.\n", "  The generalization of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz\n(MERA) to continuous systems, or cMERA [Haegeman et al., Phys. Rev. Lett, 110,\n100402 (2013)], is expected to become a powerful variational ansatz for the\nground state of strongly interacting quantum field theories. In this paper we\ninvestigate, in the simpler context of Gaussian cMERA for free theories, the\nextent to which the cMERA state $|\\Psi^\\Lambda\\rangle$ with finite UV cut-off\n$\\Lambda$ can capture the spacetime symmetries of the ground state\n$|\\Psi\\rangle$. For a free boson conformal field theory (CFT) in 1+1 dimensions\nas a concrete example, we build a quasi-local unitary transformation $V$ that\nmaps $|\\Psi\\rangle$ into $|\\Psi^\\Lambda\\rangle$ and show two main results. (i)\nAny spacetime symmetry of the ground state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is also mapped by $V$\ninto a spacetime symmetry of the cMERA $|\\Psi^\\Lambda\\rangle$. However, while\nin the CFT the stress-energy tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ (in terms of which all the\nspacetime symmetry generators are expressed) is local, the corresponding cMERA\nstress-energy tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\Lambda}(x) = V T_{\\mu\\nu}(x) V^{\\dagger}$ is\nquasi-local. (ii) From the cMERA, we can extract quasi-local scaling operators\n$O^{\\Lambda}_{\\alpha}(x)$ characterized by the exact same scaling dimensions\n$\\Delta_{\\alpha}$, conformal spins $s_{\\alpha}$, operator product expansion\ncoefficients $C_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$, and central charge $c$ as the original\nCFT. Finally, we argue that these results should also apply to interacting\ntheories.\n", "  The ability to engineer nonreciprocal interactions is an essential tool in\nmodern communication technology as well as a powerful resource for building\nquantum networks. Aside from large reverse isolation, a nonreciprocal device\nsuitable for applications must also have high efficiency (low insertion loss)\nand low output noise. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown\nthat nonreciprocal behavior can be achieved in optomechanical systems, but\nperformance in these last two attributes has been limited. Here we demonstrate\nan efficient, frequency-converting microwave isolator based on the\noptomechanical interactions between electromagnetic fields and a mechanically\ncompliant vacuum gap capacitor. We achieve simultaneous reverse isolation of\nmore than 20 dB and insertion loss less than 1.5 dB over a bandwidth of 5 kHz.\nWe characterize the nonreciprocal noise performance of the device, observing\nthat the residual thermal noise from the mechanical environments is routed\nsolely to the input of the isolator. Our measurements show quantitative\nagreement with a general coupled-mode theory. Unlike conventional isolators and\ncirculators, these compact nonreciprocal devices do not require a static\nmagnetic field, and they allow for dynamic control of the direction of\nisolation. With these advantages, similar devices could enable programmable,\nhigh-efficiency connections between disparate nodes of quantum networks, even\nefficiently bridging the microwave and optical domains.\n", "  Multi-phase fast, massive outflows have been postulated to play a crucial\nrole in galaxy evolution. The aim of this work is to constrain the nature and\nthe fraction of outflowing gas in AGNs, as well as the nuclear conditions\npossibly at the origin of such phenomena.\n  We present a large spectroscopic sample of X-ray detected SDSS AGNs at z\n<0.8. X-ray and optical flux ratio diagnostics are used to select the sample.\nPhysical and kinematic characterisation are derived re-analysing optical (and\nX-ray) spectra.\n  We derive the incidence of ionised (~40%) and atomic (< 1%) outflows covering\na wide range of AGN bolometric luminosity, from 10^42 to 10^46 erg/s. We also\nderive bolometric luminosities and X-ray bolometric corrections to test whether\nthe presence of outflows is associated with an X-ray loudness, as suggested by\nour recent results obtained studying high-z QSOs.\n  We study the relations between the outflow velocity inferred from [O III]\nkinematic analysis and different AGN power tracers, such as black hole mass\n(M_BH), [O III] and X-ray luminosity. We show a well defined positive trend\nbetween outflow velocity and L_X, for the first time over a range of 5 order of\nmagnitudes. Overall, we find that in the QSO-luminosity regime and at M_BH>10^8\nMsun the fraction of AGNs with outflows becomes >50%. Finally, we discuss our\nresults about X-ray bolometric corrections and outflow incidence in cold and\nionised phases in the context of an evolutionary sequence allowing two distinct\nstages for the feedback phase: an initial stage characterized by X-ray/optical\nobscured AGNs in which the atomic gas is still present in the ISM and the\noutflow processes involve all the gas components, and a later stage associated\nwith unobscured AGNs, which line of sight has been cleaned and the cold\ncomponents have been heated or exhausted.\n", "  We present optical nanoantennas designed for applications that require\nprocessing temperatures larger than 800{\\deg}C. The antennas consist of arrays\nof Re/Pt bilayer strips fabricated with a lift-off-free technique on top of\netched trenches. Reflectance measurements show a clear plasmonic resonance at\napproximately 670 nm for light polarized orthogonal to the strip axis. The\nfunctionality of the antennas is demonstrated by growing single-walled carbon\nnanotubes (CNTs) on top of the antenna arrays and measuring the corresponding\nRaman signal enhancement of individual CNTs. The results of the measurements\nare quantitatively discussed in light of numerical simulations which highlight\nthe impact of the substrate.\n", "  We study the electrocaloric (EC) effect in bulk BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) using\nmolecular dynamics simulations of a first principles-based effective\nHamiltonian, combined with direct measurements of the adiabatic EC temperature\nchange in BTO single crystals. We examine in particular the dependence of the\nEC effect on the direction of the applied electric field at all three\nferroelectric transitions, and we show that the EC response is strongly\nanisotropic. Most strikingly, an inverse caloric effect, i.e., a temperature\nincrease under field removal, can be observed at both\nferroelectric-ferroelectric transitions for certain orientations of the applied\nfield. Using the generalized Clausius-Clapeyron equation, we show that the\ninverse effect occurs exactly for those cases where the field orientation\nfavors the higher temperature/higher entropy phase. Our simulations show that\ntemperature changes of around 1 K can in principle be obtained at the\ntetragonal-orthorhombic transition close to room temperature, even for small\napplied fields, provided that the applied field is strong enough to drive the\nsystem across the first order transition line. Our direct EC measurements for\nBTO single crystals at the cubic-tetragonal and at the tetragonal-orthorhombic\ntransitions are in good qualitative agreement with our theoretical predictions,\nand in particular confirm the occurrence of an inverse EC effect at the\ntetragonal-orthorhombic transition for electric fields applied along the [001]\npseudo-cubic direction.\n", "  We study the role of fluctuations in percolation of sparse complex networks.\nTo this end we consider two random correlated realizations of the initial\ndamage of the nodes and we evaluate the fraction of nodes that are expected to\nremain in the giant component of the network in both cases or just in one case.\nOur framework includes a message-passing algorithm able to predict the\nfluctuations in a single network, and an analytic prediction of the expected\nfluctuations in ensembles of sparse networks. This approach is applied to real\necological and infrastructure networks and it is shown to characterize the\nexpected fluctuations in their response to external damage.\n", "  Aims: Recent observations have challenged our understanding of rotational\nmixing in massive stars by revealing a population of fast-rotating objects with\napparently normal surface nitrogen abundances. However, several questions have\narisen because of a number of issues, which have rendered a reinvestigation\nnecessary; these issues include the presence of numerous upper limits for the\nnitrogen abundance, unknown multiplicity status, and a mix of stars with\ndifferent physical properties, such as their mass and evolutionary state, which\nare known to control the amount of rotational mixing. Methods: We have\ncarefully selected a large sample of bright, fast-rotating early-type stars of\nour Galaxy (40 objects with spectral types between B0.5 and O4). Their\nhigh-quality, high-resolution optical spectra were then analysed with the\nstellar atmosphere modelling codes DETAIL/SURFACE or CMFGEN, depending on the\ntemperature of the target. Several internal and external checks were performed\nto validate our methods; notably, we compared our results with literature data\nfor some well-known objects, studied the effect of gravity darkening, or\nconfronted the results provided by the two codes for stars amenable to both\nanalyses. Furthermore, we studied the radial velocities of the stars to assess\ntheir binarity. Results: This first part of our study presents our methods and\nprovides the derived stellar parameters, He, CNO abundances, and the\nmultiplicity status of every star of the sample. It is the first time that He\nand CNO abundances of such a large number of Galactic massive fast rotators are\ndetermined in a homogeneous way.\n", "  We addressed the so far unexplored issue of outflows induced by exponentially\ngrowing power sources, focusing on early supermassive black holes (BHs). We\nassumed that these objects grow to $10^9\\;M_{\\odot}$ by z=6 by\nEddington-limited accretion and convert 5% of their bolometric output into a\nwind. We first considered the case of energy-driven and momentum-driven\noutflows expanding in a region where the gas and total mass densities are\nuniform and equal to the average values in the Universe at $z>6$. We derived\nanalytic solutions for the evolution of the outflow, finding that, for an\nexponentially growing power with e-folding time $t_{Sal}$, the late time\nexpansion of the outflow radius is also exponential, with e-folding time of\n$5t_{Sal}$ and $4t_{Sal}$ in the energy-driven and momentum-driven limit,\nrespectively.\n  We then considered energy-driven outflows produced by QSOs at the center of\nearly dark matter halos of different masses and powered by BHs growing from\ndifferent seeds. We followed the evolution of the source power and of the gas\nand dark matter density profiles in the halos from the beginning of the\naccretion until $z=6$. The final bubble radius and velocity do not depend on\nthe seed BH mass but are instead smaller for larger halo masses. At z=6, bubble\nradii in the range 50-180 kpc and velocities in the range 400-1000 km s$^{-1}$\nare expected for QSOs hosted by halos in the mass range\n$3\\times10^{11}-10^{13}\\;M_{\\odot}$.\n  By the time the QSO is observed, we found that the total thermal energy\ninjected within the bubble in the case of an energy-driven outflow is\n$E_{th}\\sim5 \\times 10^{60}$ erg. This is in excellent agreement with the value\nof $E_{th}=(6.2\\pm 1.7)\\times 10^{60}$ erg measured through the detection of\nthe thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect around a large population of luminous QSOs\nat lower redshift. [abridged]\n", "  We investigate the intrinsic Baldwin effect (Beff) of the broad H$\\alpha$ and\nH$\\beta$ emission lines for six Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with\ndifferent broad line characteristics: two Seyfert 1 (NGC 4151 and NGC 5548),\ntwo AGNs with double-peaked broad line profiles (3C 390.3 and Arp 102B), one\nnarrow line Seyfert 1 (Ark 564), and one high-luminosity quasar with highly red\nasymmetric broad line profiles (E1821+643). We found that a significant\nintrinsic Beff was present in all Type 1 AGNs in our sample. Moreover, we do\nnot see strong difference in intrinsic Beff slopes in different types of AGNs\nwhich probably have different physical properties, such as inclination, broad\nline region geometry, or accretion rate. Additionally, we found that the\nintrinsic Beff was not connected with the global one, which, instead, could not\nbe detected in the broad H$\\alpha$ or H$\\beta$ emission lines. In the case of\nNGC 4151, the detected variation of the Beff slope could be due to the change\nin the site of line formation in the BLR. Finally, the intrinsic Beff might be\ncaused by the additional optical continuum component that is not part of the\nionization continuum.\n", "  Context: We present results of an extensive world-wide observing campaign of\nMN Draconis.\n  Aims: MN Draconis is a poorly known active dwarf nova in the period gap and\nis one of the only two known cases of period gap SU UMa objects showing the\nnegative superhumps. Photometric behaviour of MN Draconis poses a challenge for\nexisting models of the superhump and superoutburst mechanisms. Therefore,\nthorough investigation of peculiar systems, such as MN Draconis, is crucial for\nour understanding of evolution of the close binary stars.\n  Methods: To measure fundamental parameters of the system, we collected\nphotometric data in October 2009, June-September 2013 and June-December 2015.\nAnalysis of the light curves, $O-C$ diagrams and power spectra was carried out.\n  Results: During our three observational seasons we detected four\nsuperoutburts and several normal outbursts. Based on the two consecutive\nsuperoutbursts detected in 2015, the supercycle length was derived P_sc = 74\n+/- 0.5 days and it has been increasing with a rate of P_dot = 3.3 x 10^(-3)\nduring last twelve years. Based on the positive and negative superhumps we\ncalculated the period excess epsilon = 5.6% +/- 0.1%, the period deficit\nepsilon_ = 2.5% +/- 0.6%, and in result, the orbital period P_orb = 0.0994(1)\ndays (143.126 +/- 0.144 min). We updated the basic light curve parameters of MN\nDraconis.\n  Conclusions: MN Draconis is the first discovered SU UMa system in the period\ngap with increasing supercycle length.\n", "  We report on a theoretical and experimental investigation of the normal\ncontact of stretched neo-Hookean substrates with rigid spherical probes.\nStarting from a published formulation of surface Green's function for\nincremental displacements on a pre-stretched, neo-Hookean, substrate (L.H. Lee\n\\textit{J. Mech. Phys. Sol.} \\textbf{56} (2008) 2957-2971), a model is derived\nfor both adhesive and non-adhesive contacts. The shape of the elliptical\ncontact area together with the contact load and the contact stiffness are\npredicted as a function of the in-plane stretch ratios $\\lambda_x$ and\n$\\lambda_y$ of the substrate. The validity of this model is assessed by contact\nexperiments carried out using an uniaxally stretched silicone rubber. for\nstretch ratio below about 1.25, a good agreement is observed between theory and\nexperiments. Above this threshold, some deviations from the theoretical\nprediction are induced as a result of the departure of the mechanical response\nof the silicone rubber from the neo-Hokeean description embedded in the model.\n", "  We investigate effects of strong correlation on the surface state of\ntopological insulator (TI). We argue that electrons in the regime of crossover\nfrom weak anti-localization to weak localization, are strongly correlated and\ncalculate magneto-transport coefficients of TI using gauge gravity principle.\nThen, we examine, magneto-conductivity (MC) formula and find excellent\nagreement with the data of chrome doped Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ in the crossover\nregime. We also find that cusp-like peak in MC at low doping is absent, which\nis natural since quasi-particles disappear due to the strong correlation.\n", "  This letter reports the successful use of feedback from a spin polarization\nmeasurement to the revolution frequency of a 0.97 GeV/$c$ bunched and polarized\ndeuteron beam in the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) storage ring in order to control\nboth the precession rate ($\\approx 121$ kHz) and the phase of the horizontal\npolarization component. Real time synchronization with a radio frequency (rf)\nsolenoid made possible the rotation of the polarization out of the horizontal\nplane, yielding a demonstration of the feedback method to manipulate the\npolarization. In particular, the rotation rate shows a sinusoidal function of\nthe horizontal polarization phase (relative to the rf solenoid), which was\ncontrolled to within a one standard deviation range of $\\sigma = 0.21$ rad. The\nminimum possible adjustment was 3.7 mHz out of a revolution frequency of 753\nkHz, which changes the precession rate by 26 mrad/s. Such a capability meets a\nrequirement for the use of storage rings to look for an intrinsic electric\ndipole moment of charged particles.\n", "  Transit spectroscopy is one of the most commonly used techniques for\nexoplanet atmosphere characterisation. This technique has been used to detect\nionized and neutral species in exoplanet atmospheres by comparing the observed\nstellar lines in and out of transit. The centre-to-limb variation (CLV) of the\nstellar lines across the stellar disk is an important effect for transmission\nspectroscopy, since it results in a change of stellar line depth when the\nplanet transits different parts of the stellar disk. We reanalyse the transit\ndata of HD 189733b taken with the HARPS spectrograph to study the CLV effect\nduring transit. The transmission light curve of the Na i D line so obtained\nshows a clear imprint of the CLV effect. We use a one-dimensional non-LTE\nstellar spectral model to simulate the CLV effect. After applying the\ncorrection, the measurement of the Na i absorption in the atmosphere of HD\n189733b becomes better determined. We compare the CLV effect of HD 189733b to\nthat of HD 209458b. The CLV effects are different for these two benchmark\nplanetary systems and this is attributed to their different stellar effective\ntemperatures and transit impact parameters. We then explore the general CLV\neffect that occurs during exoplanet transits. Normally, a star with a lower\neffective temperature exhibits a stronger CLV effect and its CLV feature\nextends over a relatively broad wavelength range. The transit impact parameter\n(b) describes the transit trajectory on the stellar disk and thus determines\nthe actual manifestation of the CLV effect. We introduce a b-diagram which\ndescribes the behavior of the CLV effect as the function of different impact\nparameters. With improving observational precision, a careful modeling and\ncorrection of the CLV effect is necessary for exoplanet atmosphere\ncharacterisation using transit spectroscopy.\n", "  Ultracold plasmas (UCP) provide a well-controlled system for studying\nmultiple aspects in plasma physics that include collisions and strong coupling\neffects. By applying a short electric field pulse to a UCP, a plasma electron\ncenter-of-mass (CM) oscillation can be initiated. In accessible parameter\nranges, the damping rate of this oscillation is determined by the electron-ion\ncollision rate. We performed measurements of the oscillation damping rate with\nsuch parameters and compared the measured rates to both a molecular dynamic\n(MD) simulation that includes strong coupling effects and to Monte-Carlo\ncollisional operator simulation designed to predict the damping rate including\nonly weak coupling considerations. We found agreement between experimentally\nmeasured damping rate and the MD result. This agreement did require including\nthe influence of a previously unreported UCP heating mechanism whereby the\npresence of a DC electric field during ionization increased the electron\ntemperature, but estimations and simulations indicate that such a heating\nmechanism should be present for our parameters. The measured damping rate at\nour coldest electron temperature conditions was much faster than the weak\ncoupling prediction obtained from the Monte-Carlo operator simulation, which\nindicates the presence of significant strong coupling influence. The density\naveraged electron strong coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ measured at our coldest\nelectron temperature conditions was 0.35.\n", "  We report infrared magneto-spectroscopy studies on thin crystals of an\nemerging Dirac material ZrTe5 near the intrinsic limit. The observed structure\nof the Landau level transitions and zero-field infrared absorption indicate a\ntwo-dimensional Dirac-like electronic structure, similar to that in graphene\nbut with a small relativistic mass corresponding to a 9.4 meV energy gap.\nMeasurements with circularly polarized light reveal a significant electron-hole\nasymmetry, which leads to splitting of the Landau level transitions at high\nmagnetic fields. Our model, based on the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang effective\nHamiltonian, quantitatively explains all observed transitions, determining the\nvalues of the Fermi velocity, Dirac mass (or gap), electron-hole asymmetry, and\nelectron and hole g-factors.\n", "  We present results on the growth of CdTe-HgTe core-shell nanowires, a\nrealization of a quasi one-dimensional heterostructure of the topological\ninsulator HgTe. The growth is a two step process consisting of the growth of\nsingle crystalline zinc blende CdTe nanowires with the vapor-liquid-solid\nmethod and the overgrowth of these wires with HgTe such that a closed shell is\nformed around the CdTe core structure. The CdTe wire growth is monitored by\nRHEED allowing us to infer information on the crystal properties from the\nelectron diffraction pattern. This information is used to find and control the\noptimal growth temperature. High quality single crystal CdTe nanowires grow\nwith a preferred orientation. For the growth of the conductive HgTe shell\nstructure we find that the supplied Hg:Te ratio is the crucial parameter to\nfacilitate growth on all surface facets.\n", "  We derive the equations for calculating the high-frequency asymptotics of the\nlocal two-particle vertex function for a multi-orbital impurity model. These\nrelate the asymptotics for a general local interaction to equal-time\ntwo-particle Green's functions, which we sample using continuous-time quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations with a worm algorithm. As specific examples we study\nthe single-orbital Hubbard model and the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals of SrVO$_3$\nwithin dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). We demonstrate how the knowledge of\nthe high-frequency asymptotics reduces the statistical uncertainties of the\nvertex and further eliminates finite box size effects. The proposed method\nbenefits the calculation of non-local susceptibilities in DMFT and diagrammatic\nextensions of DMFT.\n", "  We consider the possibility of gauge coupling unification within the simplest\nrealizations of the $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\times SU(3)_L \\times SU(3)_R \\times\nU(1)_{X}}$ gauge theory. We present a first exploration of the renormalization\ngroup equations governing the \"bottom-up\" evolution of the gauge couplings in a\ngeneric model with free normalization for the generators. Interestingly, we\nfind that for a $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\times SU(3)_L \\times SU(3)_R \\times\nU(1)_{X}}$ symmetry breaking scale $M_X$ as low as a few TeV one can achieve\nunification in the presence of leptonic octets. We briefly comment on possible\ngrand unified theory frameworks which can embed the $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\times\nSU(3)_L \\times SU(3)_R \\times U(1)_{X}}$ model as well as possible\nimplications, such as lepton flavour violating physics at the LHC.\n", "  Aims. We aim to infer the sub-surface distribution of the Sun's\nnon-axisymmetric azimuthal magnetic flux from observable quantities, such as\nthe surface magnetic field and the large scale plasma flows.\n  Methods. We have built a kinematic flux transport model of the solar dynamo\nbased on the Babcock-Leighton framework. We constructed the source term for the\npoloidal field using SOLIS magnetograms spanning three solar cycles. Based on\nthis source we calculated the azimuthal flux below the surface. The flux\ntransport model has two free parameters which we constrain using sunspot\nobservations from cycle 22. We compared the model results with observations\nfrom cycle 23.\n  Results. The structure of the azimuthal field is mainly axisymmetric. The\ndepartures from axisymmetry represent, on average, ~3% of the total azimuthal\nflux. Owing to its relative weakness, the non-axisymmetric structure of the\nazimuthal field does not have a significant impact on the location in which the\nemergences appear or on the amount of flux contained in them. We find that the\nprobability of emergence is a function of the ratio between the flux content of\nan active region and the underlying azimuthal flux.\n", "  The determination of the electron mass from Penning-trap measurements with\n$^{12}$C$^{5+}$ ions and from theoretical results for the bound-electron $g$\nfactor is described in detail. Some recently calculated contributions slightly\nshift the extracted mass value. Prospects of a further improvement of the\nelectron mass are discussed both from the experimental and from the theoretical\npoint of view. Measurements with $^4$He$^+$ ions will enable a consistency\ncheck of the electron mass value, and in future an improvement of the $^4$He\nnuclear mass and a determination of the fine-structure constant.\n", "  We disentangle X-ray disk reflection from complex line-of-sight absorption in\nthe nearby Seyfert NGC 4151, using a suite of Suzaku, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton\nobservations. Extending upon earlier published work, we pursue a physically\nmotivated model using the latest angle-resolved version of the lamp-post\ngeometry reflection model relxillCp_lp together with a Comptonization\ncontinuum. We use the long-look simultaneous Suzaku/NuSTAR observation to\ndevelop a baseline model wherein we model reflected emission as a combination\nof lamp-post components at the heights of 1.2 and 15.0 gravitational radii. We\nargue for a vertically extended corona as opposed to two compact and distinct\nprimary sources. We find two neutral absorbers (one full-covering and one\npartial-covering), an ionized absorber ($\\log \\xi = 2.8$), and a highly-ionized\nultra-fast outflow, which have all been reported previously. All analyzed\nspectra are well described by this baseline model. The bulk of the spectral\nvariability between 1 keV and 6 keV can be accounted for by changes in the\ncolumn density of both neutral absorbers, which appear to be degenerate and\ninversely correlated with the variable hard continuum component flux. We track\nvariability in absorption on both short (2 d) and long ($\\sim$1 yr) timescales;\nthe observed evolution is either consistent with changes in the absorber\nstructure (clumpy absorber at distances ranging from the broad line region\n(BLR) to the inner torus or a dusty radiatively driven wind) or a geometrically\nstable neutral absorber that becomes increasingly ionized at a rising flux\nlevel. The soft X-rays below 1 keV are dominated by photoionized emission from\nextended gas that may act as a warm mirror for the nuclear radiation.\n", "  Topological nodal line semimetals are characterized by the crossing of the\nconduction and valence bands along one or more closed loops in the Brillouin\nzone. Usually, these loops are either isolated or touch each other at some\nhighly symmetric points. Here, we introduce a new kind of nodal line semimetal,\nthat contains a pair of linked nodal loops. A concrete two-band model was\nconstructed, which supports a pair of nodal lines with a double-helix\nstructure, which can be further twisted into a Hopf link because of the\nperiodicity of the Brillouin zone. The nodal lines are stabilized by the\ncombined spatial inversion $\\mathcal{P}$ and time reversal $\\mathcal{T}$\nsymmetry; the individual $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$ symmetries must be\nbroken. The band exhibits nontrivial topology that each nodal loop carries a\n$\\pi$ Berry flux. Surface flat bands emerge at the open boundary and are\nexactly encircled by the projection of the nodal lines on the surface Brillouin\nzone. The experimental implementation of our model using cold atoms in optical\nlattices is discussed.\n", "  We analyze a measurement scheme that allows determination of the Berry\ncurvature and the topological Chern number of a Hamiltonian with parameters\nexploring a two-dimensional closed manifold. Our method uses continuous\nmonitoring of the gradient of the Hamiltonian with respect to one parameter\nduring a quasi-adiabatic quench of the other. Measurement back-action leads to\ndisturbance of the system dynamics, but we show that this can be compensated by\na feedback Hamiltonian. As an example, we analyze the implementation with a\nsuperconducting qubit subject to time varying, near resonant microwave fields;\nequivalent to a spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field.\n", "  The threshold properties of very small lasers (down to the nanoscale) are a\ntopic of active research in light of continuous progress in nanofabrication.\nWith the help of a simple rate equation model we analyze the intrinsic,\nmacroscopic dynamics of threshold crossing for Class B lasers. We use the\ndeterministic aspects of the basic rate equations to extract some fundamental\ntime constants from an approximate analysis of laser dynamics in the threshold\nregion. Approximate solutions for the population inversion and for the field\nintensity, up to the point where the latter reaches macroscopic levels, are\nfound and discussed. The resulting timescales characterize the laser's ability\nto respond to perturbations (external modulation or intrinsic fluctuations in\nthe lasing transition region). Numerical verifications test the accuracy of\nthese solutions and confirm their validity. The predictions are used to\ninterpret experimental results obtained in mesoscale lasers and to speculated\nabout their extension to nanolasers.\n", "  We consider the formation of order in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D)\nanti-ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate quenched from an easy-axis (EA) to an\neasy-plane (EP) nematic phase. We define the relevant order parameter to\nquantify the spin-nematic degrees of freedom and study the evolution of the\nspin-nematic and superfluid order during the coarsening dynamics using\nnumerical simulations. We observe dynamical scaling in the late time dynamics\nwith both types of order extending across the system with a diffusive growth\nlaw. We identify half-quantum vortices (HQVs) as the relevant topological\ndefects of the ordering dynamics, and demonstrate that the growth of both types\nof order is determined by the mutual annihilation of these vortices.\n", "  A $SU(N)_L\\times SU(N)_R$ gauge theory for a scalar multiplet $Y$\ntransforming in the bi-fundamental representation $(N,\\bar N)$ preserves, for\n$N>4$, an accidental $U(1)$ symmetry firstly broken at operator dimension $N$.\nTwo configurations are possible for the vacuum expectation value of $Y$, which\ncorrespond to the (maximal) little groups $\\mathcal{H}_s=SU(N)_{L+R}$ and\n$\\mathcal{H}_h=SU(N-1)_L\\times SU(N-1)_R\\times U(1)_{L+R}$. In the first case\nthe accidental $U(1)$ gets also broken, yielding a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson\nwith mass suppression controlled by $N$, while in the second case a global\n$U(1)$ remains unbroken. The strong CP problem is solved by coupling $Y$ to new\nfermions carrying color. The first case allows for a Peccei-Quinn solution with\n$U(1)_{PQ}$ protected up to order $N$ by the gauge symmetry. In the second case\n$U(1)$ can get broken by condensates of the new strong dynamics, resulting in a\ncomposite axion. By coupling $Y$ to fermions carrying only weak isospin, models\nfor axion-like particles can be constructed.\n", "  We show that the CPN model with odd number of scalar fields and V-shaped\npotential possesses finite energy compact solutions in the form of Q-balls and\nQ-shells. The solutions were obtained in 3+1 dimensions. Q-balls appears for\nN=1 and N=3 whereas Q-shells are present for higher odd values of N. We show\nthat energy of these solutions behaves as E~|Q|^5/6, where Q is the Noether\ncharge.\n", "  Ferrimagnetic Mn$_2$Fe$_x$Ga $(0.26 \\leq x \\leq 1.12)$ thin films have been\ncharacterised by X-ray diffraction, SQUID magnetometry, X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy\nwith the aim of determining the structure and site-specific magnetism of this\ntetragonal, D0$_{22}$-structure Heusler compound. High-quality epitaxial films\nwith low RMS surface roughness ($\\sim 0.6$ nm) are grown by magnetron\nco-sputtering. The tetragonal distortion induces strong perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy along the $c$-axis with a typical coercive field $\\mu_0 H\\sim 0.8$ T\nand an anisotropy field ranging from $6$ to $8$ T. Upon increasing the Fe\ncontent $x$, substantial uniaxial anisotropy, $K_\\mathrm{u} \\geq 1.0$ MJ/m$^3$\ncan be maintained over the full $x$ range, while the magnetisation of the\ncompound is reduced from $400$ to $280$ kA/m. The total magnetisation is almost\nentirely given by the sum of the spin moments originating from the\nferrimagnetic Mn and Fe sublattices, with the latter being coupled\nferromagnetically to one of the former. The orbital magnetic moments are\npractically quenched, and have negligible contributions to the magnetisation.\nThe films with $x=0.73$ exhibit a high anomalous Hall angle of $2.5$ % and a\nhigh Fermi-level spin polarisation, above $51$ %, as measured by point contact\nAndreev reflection. The Fe-substituted Mn$_2$Ga films are highly tunable with a\nunique combination of high anisotropy, low magnetisation, appreciable spin\npolarisation and low surface roughness, making them very strong candidates for\nthermally-stable spin-transfer-torque switching nanomagnets with lateral\ndimensions down to $10$ nm.\n", "  We study far-from-equilibrium dynamics in models of freely cooling granular\ngas and ballistically aggregating compact clusters. For both the cases, from\nevent driven molecular dynamics simulations we have presented detailed results\non structure and dynamics in space dimensions $d=1$ and $2$. Via appropriate\nanalyses it has been confirmed that the ballistic aggregation mechanism applies\nin $d=1$ granular gases as well. Aging phenomena for this mechanism, in both\nthe dimensions, have been studied via the two-time density autocorrelation\nfunction. This quantity is demonstrated to exhibit scaling property similar to\nthat in the standard phase transition kinetics. The corresponding functional\nforms have been quantified and discussed in connection with the structural\nproperties. Our results on aging establish a more complete equivalence between\nthe granular gas and the ballistic aggregation models in $d=1$.\n", "  Approximately 3-17 percent of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) without detected\nrest-frame UV/optical broad emission lines (type-2 AGN) do not show absorption\nin X-rays. The physical origin behind the apparently discordant optical/X-ray\nproperties is not fully understood. Our study aims at providing insight into\nthis issue by conducting a detailed analysis of the nuclear dust extinction and\nX-ray absorption properties of two AGN with low X-ray absorption and with high\noptical extinction, for which a rich set of high quality spectroscopic data is\navailable from XMM-Newton archive data in X-rays and XSHOOTER proprietary data\nat UV-to-NIR wavelengths. In order to unveil the apparent mismatch, we have\ndetermined the A$_{\\rm V}$/N$_{\\rm H}$ and both the Super Massive Black Hole\n(SMBH) and the host galaxy masses. We find that the mismatch is caused in one\ncase by an abnormally high dust-to-gas ratio that makes the UV/optical emission\nto appear more obscured than in the X-rays. For the other object we find that\nthe dust-to-gas ratio is similar to the Galactic one but the AGN is hosted by a\nvery massive galaxy so that the broad emission lines and the nuclear continuum\nare swamped by the star-light and difficult to detect.\n", "  Monoaxial chiral magnets can form a peculiar noncollinear spin structure\ncalled the chiral soliton lattice in an applied magnetic field perpendicular to\nthe helical axis. We study magnetic properties and electrical transport in the\nchiral soliton lattice by a Monte Carlo simulation for a one-dimensional Kondo\nlattice model including the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between classical\nlocalized spins. We show that the model exhibits a helical spin structure at a\nzero magnetic field, which turns into the chiral soliton lattice, and finally,\nto a forced ferromagnetic state with increasing the external magnetic field. In\nthe chiral soliton lattice state, we find negative magnetoresistance\nproportional to the number of solitons at low temperature, which corroborates\nthe spin scattering of electrons by chiral solitons. We also discuss the\ntemperature and magnetic field dependence of the spin structure factor and\nelectrical resistivity, in comparison with experiments for CrNb$_{3}$S$_{6}$.\n", "  With electron and hole pockets touching at the Weyl node, type-II Weyl\nsemimetal is a newly proposed topological state distinct from its type-I\ncousin. We numerically study the localization effect for tilted type-I as well\nas type-II Weyl semimetals and give the global phase diagram. For dis- ordered\ntype-I Weyl semimetal, an intermediate three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall\nphase is confirmed between Weyl semimetal phase and diffusive metal phase.\nHowever, this intermediate phase is absent for disordered type-II Weyl\nsemimetal. Besides, near the Weyl nodes, comparing to its type-I cousin,\ntype-II Weyl semimetal possesses even larger ratio between the transport\nlifetime along the direction of tilt and the quantum lifetime. Near the phase\nboundary between the type-I and the type-II Weyl semimetals, infinitesimal\ndisorder will induce an insulating phase so that in this region, the concept of\nWeyl semimetal is meaningless for real materials.\n", "  We present a detailed characterization of the growth dynamics of\nGa(Al)As(111)A surfaces. We develop a theoretical growth model that well\ndescribes the observed behavior on the growth parameters and underlines the\nEhrlich-Schwoebel barrier as leading factor that determines the growth\ndynamics. On such basis we analyze the factors that lead to the huge observed\nroughness on such surface orientations and we identify the growth conditions\nthat drive the typical three-dimensional growth of Ga(Al)As(111)A towards\natomically flat surface. GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells realized on optimized\nsurface (<0.2 nm roughness) show a record low emission linewidth of 4.5 meV.\n", "  We use a non-perturbative renormalization group approach to develop a unified\npicture of the Bose polaron problem, where a mobile impurity is strongly\ninteracting with a surrounding Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A detailed\ntheoretical analysis of the phase diagram is presented and the\npolaron-to-molecule transition is discussed. For attractive polarons we argue\nthat a description in terms of an effective Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian with\nrenormalized parameters is possible. Its strong coupling regime is realized\nclose to a Feshbach resonance, where we predict a sharp increase of the\neffective mass. Already for weaker interactions, before the polaron mass\ndiverges, we predict a transition to a regime where states exist below the\npolaron energy and the attractive polaron is no longer the ground state. On the\nrepulsive side of the Feshbach resonance we recover the repulsive polaron,\nwhich has a finite lifetime because it can decay into low-lying molecular\nstates. We show for the entire range of couplings that the polaron energy has\nlogarithmic corrections in comparison with predictions by the mean-field\napproach. We demonstrate that they are a consequence of the polaronic mass\nrenormalization which is due to quantum fluctuations of correlated phonons in\nthe polaron cloud.\n", "  We present a new method of deriving a boundary condition at a thin membrane\nfor diffusion from experimental data. Based on experimental results obtained\nfor normal diffusion of ethanol in water, we show that the derived boundary\ncondition at a membrane contains a term with the Riemann--Liouville fractional\ntime derivative of the $1/2$ order. Such a form of the boundary condition shows\nthat a transfer of particles through a thin membrane is a `long memory\nprocess'. Presented method is an example that an important part of mathematical\nmodel of physical process may be derived directly from experimental data.\n", "  We consider the capacitive interaction between a charge qubit and a sensor\nquantum dot(SQD) perturbatively to the second order of their coupling constant\nat zero temperature by utilizing the method of non-equilibrium Green's\nfunctions together with infinite-U Lacroix approximation and employing Majorana\nfermion representation for qubit isospin operators. The effect of back-actions\non dynamics of the system is taken into account by calculating the\nself-energies and the Green's functions in a self-consistent manner. To\ndemonstrate the applicability of the method, we investigate relevant physical\nquantities of the system at zero and finite bias voltages. In the regime of\nweak SQD-qubit coupling, we find a linear relation between the stationary-state\nexpectation values of the third component of the qubit isospin vector,\n$\\left\\langle \\tau_{3}\\right\\rangle $, and the differential conductance of the\nSQD. Furthermore, our numerical results predict that the effect of SQD-qubit\ncoupling on differential conductance of the SQD should be maximized at zero\nbias voltage. Moreover, we obtain an analytical expression to describe the\nbehavior of the differential conductance of the SQD with respect to the qubit\nparameters. Our results at zero bias voltage are consistent with the results of\nnumerical renormalization group method.\n", "  We investigate pseudorapidity correlations of the average transverse flow of\nparticles emitted in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We employ 3+1\ndimensional viscous relativistic hydrodynamics with initial conditions from the\nquark Glauber Monte Carlo model to confront the recent measurements on the\npseudorapidity correlations of the transverse momentum fluctuations in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2760$GeV. We find good agreement between the model\npredictions and data. Further, we study two other observables build with the\ncovariance of the average transverse momentum in different rapidity bins. These\nobservables have better stability under various systematics, thus allowing for\na robust comparison between data and model. The transverse flow-transverse flow\ncorrelation coefficient is directly related to correlations of the underlying\ncollective flow at different pseudorapidities. The 3-bin measure of $p_T$\nfactorization breaking in pseudorapidity gives an estimate of possible\ndecorrelation of the average transverse flow in the longitudinal direction.\n", "  We explore the impact of nuclear matter saturation on the properties and\nsystematics of finite nuclei across the nuclear chart. Using the ab initio\nin-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG), we study ground-state\nenergies and charge radii of closed-shell nuclei from $^4$He to $^{78}$Ni,\nbased on a set of low-resolution two- and three-nucleon interactions that\npredict realistic saturation properties. We first investigate in detail the\nconvergence properties of these Hamiltonians with respect to model-space\ntruncations for both two- and three-body interactions. We find one particular\ninteraction that reproduces well the ground-state energies of all closed-shell\nnuclei studied. As expected from their saturation points relative to this\ninteraction, the other Hamiltonians underbind nuclei, but lead to a remarkably\nsimilar systematics of ground-state energies. Extending our calculations to\ncomplete isotopic chains in the $sd$ and $pf$ shells with the valence-space\nIM-SRG, the same interaction reproduces not only experimental ground states but\ntwo-neutron-separation energies and first excited $2^+$ states. We also\ncalculate radii with the valence-space IM-SRG for the first time. Since this\nparticular interaction saturates at too high density, charge radii are still\ntoo small compared with experiment. Except for this underprediction, the radii\nsystematics is, however, well reproduced. Our results highlight the importance\nof nuclear matter as a theoretical benchmark for the development of\nnext-generation chiral interactions.\n", "  51 Eridani b is an exoplanet around a young (20 Myr) nearby (29.4 pc) F0-type\nstar, recently discovered by direct imaging. Being only 0.5\" away from its host\nstar it is well suited for spectroscopic analysis using integral field\nspectrographs. We aim to refine the atmospheric properties of this and to\nfurther constrain the architecture of the system by searching for additional\ncompanions. Using the SPHERE instrument at the VLT we extend the spectral\ncoverage of the planet to the complete Y- to H-band range and provide\nphotometry in the K12-bands (2.11, 2.25 micron). The object is compared to\nother cool and peculiar dwarfs. Furthermore, the posterior probability\ndistributions of cloudy and clear atmospheric models are explored using MCMC.\nWe verified our methods by determining atmospheric parameters for the two\nbenchmark brown dwarfs Gl 570D and HD 3651B. For probing the innermost region\nfor additional companions, archival VLT-NACO (L') SAM data is used. We present\nthe first spectrophotometric measurements in the Y- and K-bands for the planet\nand revise its J-band flux to values 40% fainter than previous measurements.\nCloudy models with uniform cloud coverage provide a good match to the data. We\nderive the temperature, radius, surface gravity, metallicity and cloud\nsedimentation parameter f_sed. We find that the atmosphere is highly\nsuper-solar (Fe/H~1.0) with an extended, thick cloud cover of small particles.\nThe model radius and surface gravity suggest planetary masses of about 9 M_jup.\nThe evolutionary model only provides a lower mass limit of >2 M_jup (for pure\nhot-start). The cold-start model cannot explain the planet's luminosity. The\nSPHERE and NACO/SAM detection limits probe the 51 Eri system at Solar System\nscales and exclude brown-dwarf companions more massive than 20 M_jup beyond\nseparations of ~2.5 au and giant planets more massive than 2 M_jup beyond 9 au.\n", "  Polar compensation can play an important role in the determination of\ninterfacial electronic and magnetic properties in oxide heterostructures. Using\nx-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, bulk\nmagnetometry, and transport measurements, we find that interfacial charge\nredistribution via polar compensation is essential for explaining the evolution\nof interfacial ferromagnetism in LaNiO$_3$/CaMnO$_3$ superlattices as a\nfunction of LaNiO$_3$ layer thickness. In insulating superlattices (4 unit\ncells or less of LaNiO$_3$), magnetism is dominated by Ni-Mn superexchange,\nwhile itinerant electron-based Mn-Mn double-exchange plays a role in thicker\nmetallic superlattices. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and resonant x-ray\nscattering show that Ni-Mn superexchange contributes to the magnetization even\nin metallic superlattices. This Ni-Mn superexchange interaction can be\nexplained in terms of polar compensation at the LaNiO$_3$-CaMnO$_3$ interface.\nThese results highlight the different mechanisms responsible for interfacial\nferromagnetism and the importance of understanding compensation due to polar\nmismatch at oxide-based interfaces when engineering magnetic properties.\n", "  A search for the production of heavy resonances decaying into top\nquark-antiquark pairs is presented. The analysis is performed in the\nlepton+jets and fully hadronic channels using data collected in proton-proton\ncollisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV using the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 2.6 inverse femtobarns. The selection is\noptimized for massive resonances, where the top quarks have large Lorentz\nboosts. No evidence for resonant t t-bar production is found in the data, and\nupper limits on the production cross section of heavy resonances are set. The\nexclusion limits for resonances with masses above 2 TeV are significantly\nimproved compared to those of previous analyses at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV.\n", "  We show that the chemical potential of a one-dimensional (1D) interacting\nBose gas exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence which is peculiar of\nsuperfluids. The effect is a direct consequence of the phononic nature of the\nexcitation spectrum at large wavelengths exhibited by 1D Bose gases. For low\ntemperatures $T$, we demonstrate that the coefficient in $T^2$ expansion of the\nchemical potential is entirely defined by the zero-temperature density\ndependence of the sound velocity. We calculate that coefficient along the\ncrossover between the Bogoliubov weakly-interacting gas and the Tonks-Girardeau\ngas of impenetrable bosons. Analytic expansions are provided in the asymptotic\nregimes. The theoretical predictions along the crossover are confirmed by\ncomparison with the exactly solvable Yang-Yang model in which the\nfinite-temperature equation of state is obtained numerically by solving\nBethe-{\\it ansatz} equations. A 1D ring geometry is equivalent to imposing\nperiodic boundary conditions and arising finite-size effects are studied in\ndetails. At $T=0$ we calculated various thermodynamic functions, including the\ninelastic structure factor, as a function of the number of atoms, pointing out\nthe occurrence of important deviations from the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We consider the quantum Rabi model with external time modulation of the\natomic frequency, which can be employed to create excitations from the vacuum\nstate of the electromagnetic field as a consequence of the dynamical Casimir\neffect. Excitations can also be systematically subtracted from the atom-field\nsystem by suitably adjusting the modulation frequency, in the so-called\nanti-dynamical Casimir effect (ADCE). We evaluate the quantum thermodynamical\nwork and show that a realistic out-of-equilibrium finite-time protocol\nharnessing ADCE allows for work extraction from the system, whose amount can be\nmuch bigger then the modulation amplitude, $| W_{\\mathrm{ADCE}}| \\gg \\hbar\n\\epsilon_\\Omega$, in contrast to the case of very slow adiabatic modulations.\nWe provide means to control work extraction in state-of-the-art experimental\nscenarios, where precise frequency adjustments or complete system isolation may\nbe difficult to attain.\n", "  We study the topological properties of magnon excitations in a wide class of\nthree dimensional (3D) honeycomb lattices with ferromagnetic ground states. It\nis found that they host nodal ring magnon excitations. These rings locate on\nthe same plane in the momentum space. The rings can be gapped by\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions to form two Weyl points with opposite\ncharges. We explicitly discuss these physics in the simplest 3D honeycomb\nlattice, the hyperhoneycomb lattice and show drumhead and arc surface states in\nthe nodal ring and Weyl phases, respectively, due to the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence.\n", "  We report on the exciton and trion density dynamics in a single layer of\nMoSe$_2$, resonantly excited and probed using three-pulse four-wave mixing\n(FWM), at temperatures from 300K to 77K . A multi-exponential third-order\nresponse function for amplitude and phase of the heterodyne-detected FWM signal\nincluding four decay processes is used to model the data. We provide a\nconsistent interpretation within the intrinsic band structure, not requiring\nthe inclusion of extrinsic effects. We find an exciton radiative lifetime in\nthe sub-picosecond range consistent to what has been recently reported. After\nthe dominating radiative decay, the remaining exciton density, which has been\nscattered from the initially excited bright radiative state into dark states of\ndifferent nature by exciton-phonon scattering or disorder scattering, shows a\nslower dynamics, covering 10ps to 10ns timescales. This includes direct bright\ntransitions with larger in-plane momentum, as well as indirect dark transitions\nto indirect dark states. We find that exciton-exciton annihilation is not\nrelevant in the observed dynamics, in variance from previous finding under\nnon-resonant excitation. The trion density at 77K reveals a decay of the order\nof 1ps, similar to what is observed for the exciton. After few tens of\npicoseconds, the trion dynamics resembles the one of the exciton, indicating\nthat trion ionization occurs on this timescale.\n", "  Context. Methane is among the main components of the ice mantles of\ninsterstellar dust grains, where it is at the start of a rich solid-phase\nchemical network. Quantification of the photon-induced desorption yield of\nthese frozen molecules and understanding of the underlying processes is\nnecessary to accurately model the observations and the chemical evolution of\nvarious regions of the interstellar medium. Aims. This study aims at\nexperimentally determining absolute photodesorption yields for the CH4 molecule\nas a function of photon energy. The influence of the ice composition is also\ninvestigated. By studying the methane desorption from layered CH4:CO ice,\nindirect desorption processes triggered by the excitation of the CO molecules\nis monitored and quantified. Methods. Tunable monochromatic VUV light from the\nDESIRS beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron is used in the 7 - 13.6 eV (177 - 91\nnm) range to irradiate pure CH4 or layers of CH4 deposited on top of CO ice\nsamples. The release of species in the gas phase is monitored by quadrupole\nmass spectrometry and absolute photodesorption yields of intact CH4 are\ndeduced. Results. CH4 photodesorbs for photon energies higher than ~9.1 eV\n(~136 nm). The photodesorption spectrum follows the absorption spectrum of CH4,\nwhich confirms a desorption mechanism mediated by electronic transitions in the\nice. When it is deposited on top of CO, CH4 desorbs between 8 and 9 eV with a\npattern characteristic of CO absorption, indicating desorption induced by\nenergy transfer from CO molecules. Conclusions. The photodesorption of CH4 from\nthe pure ice in various interstellar environments is around 2.0 x 10^-3\nmolecules per incident photon. Results on CO-induced indirect desorption of CH4\nprovide useful insights for the generalization of this process to other\nmolecules co-existing with CO in ice mantles.\n", "  We present the successful synthesis of single-atom-thick borophene\nnanoribbons (BNRs) by self-assembly of boron on Ag(110) surface. The scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) studies reveal high quality BNRs: all the ribbons\nare along the [-110] direction of Ag(110), and can run across the steps on the\nsurface. The width of ribbons is distributed in a narrow range around 10.3 nm.\nHigh resolution STM images revealed four ordered surface structures in BNRs.\nCombined with DFT calculations, we found that all the four structures of boron\nnanoribbons consist of the boron chains with different width, separated by\nhexagonal hole arrays. The successful synthesis of BNRs enriches the low\ndimensional allotrope of boron and may promote further applications of\nborophene\n", "  Aims. Numerous trans-Neptunian objects are known to be in mean-motion\nresonance with Neptune. We aim to describe their long-term orbital evolution\n(both past and future) by means of a one-degree-of-freedom secular model. In\nthis paper, we focus only on objects with a semi-major axis larger than 50\nastronomical units (au).\n  Methods. For each resonant object considered, a 500 000-year numerical\nintegration is performed. The output is digitally filtered to get the\nparameters of the resonant secular model. Their long-term (Giga-year) orbital\nevolution is then represented by the level curves of the secular Hamiltonian.\n  Results. For the majority of objects considered, the mean-motion resonance\nhas little impact on the long-term trajectories (the secular dynamics is\nsimilar to a non-resonant one). However, a subset of objects is strongly\naffected by the resonance, producing moderately-high-amplitude oscillations of\nthe perihelion distance and/or libration of the argument of perihelion around a\nfixed centre. Moreover, the high perihelion distance of the object 2015 FJ345\nis plainly explained by long-term resonant dynamics, allowing us to also deduce\nits orbital elements at the time of capture in resonance (at least 15 million\nyears ago). The same type of past evolution is expected for 2014 FZ71.\n", "  We have investigated co-directional and contra-directional couplings between\nspin wave and acoustic wave in one-dimensional periodic structure (magphonic\ncrystal). The system consists of two ferromagnetic layers alternating in space.\nWe have taken into consideration materials commonly used in magnonics: yttrium\niron garnet, CoFeB, permalloy, and cobalt. The coupled mode theory (CMT)\nformalism have been successfully implemented to describe magnetoelastic\ninteraction as a periodic perturbation in the magphonic crystal. The results of\nCMT calculations have been verified by more rigorous simulations by\nfrequency-domain plane wave method and time-domain finite element method. The\npresented resonant coupling in the magphonic crystal is an active in-space\nmechanism which spatially transfers energy between propagating spin and\nacoustic modes, thus creating propagating magnetoelastic wave. We have shown,\nthat CMT analysis of the magnetoelastic coupling is an useful tool to optimize\nand design a spin wave - acoustic wave transducer based on a magphonic\ncrystals. The effect of spin wave damping has been included to the model to\ndiscuss the efficiency of such a device. Our model shows that it is possible to\nobtain forward conversion of the acoustic wave to the spin wave in case of\nco-directional coupling and backward conversion in case of contra-directional\ncoupling.\n", "  Collective leadership and herding may arise in standard models of opinion\ndynamics as an interplay of a strong separation of time scales within the\npopulation and its hierarchical organization. Using the voter model as a simple\nopinion formation model, we show that, in the herding phase, a group of agents\nbecome effectively the leaders of the dynamics while the rest of the population\nfollow blindly their opinion. Interestingly, in some cases such herding\ndynamics accelerates the time to consensus, which then become size independent\nor, on the contrary, makes the consensus nearly impossible. These new behaviors\nhave important consequences when an external noise is added to the system that\nmakes consensus (absorbing) states to disappear. We analyze this new model\nwhich shows an interesting phase diagram, with a purely diffusive phase, a\nherding (or two-states) phase, and mixed phases where both behaviors are\npossible.\n", "  In high energy heavy-ion collisions the magnetic field is very strong right\nafter the nuclei penetrate each other and a non-equilibrium system of quarks\nand gluons builds up. Even though quarks might not be very abundant initially,\ntheir dynamics must necessarily be influenced by the Lorentz force. Employing\nthe 3+1d partonic cascade BAMPS we show that the circular Larmor movement of\nthe quarks leads to a strong positive anisotropic flow of quarks at very soft\ntransverse momenta. We explore the regions where the effect is visible, and\nexplicitly show how collisions damp the effect. As a possible application we\nlook at photon production from the flowing non-equilibrium medium.\n", "  Gravitational domain wall solutions in gauged supergravity are often\nconstructed within truncations that do not include vectors. As a consequence\nthe gauge group is only a global symmetry of this truncation. The consistency\nof the truncation requires the restriction to solutions with vanishing Noether\ncharge under this global symmetry, since otherwise vector fields are sourced.\nWe show that this has interesting consequences for the orbit structure of the\nsolutions under the global symmetries. We investigate this for\n$\\text{CSO}(p,q,r)$-gaugings in various dimensions with scalar fields truncated\nto the $\\text{SL}(n,\\mathbb{R})/\\text{SO}(n)$ subcoset. We prove that the seed\nsolution $-$ which generates all other solutions using only global\ntransformations $-$ has a diagonal coset matrix. This means that there exists a\ntransformation at the boundary of the geometry that diagonalises the coset\nmatrix and that this same transformation also diagonalises the whole flow as a\nconsequence of the vanishing charge.\n", "  We report a new effect of a cascade replication of dissipative solitons from\na single one. It is discussed in the framework of a common model based on the\none-dimensional cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in which an\nadditional linear term is introduced to account the perturbation from a\nparticular potential of externally applied force. The effect manifestation is\ndemonstrated on the light beams propagating through a planar waveguide. The\nwaveguide consists of a nonlinear layer able to guide dissipative solitons, and\na magneto-optic substrate. In the waveguide an externally applied force is\nconsidered to be an inhomogeneous magnetic field which is induced by modulated\nelectric currents flowing along a set of direct conducting wires adjusted on\nthe top of the waveguide.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions between competing equilibrium shapes of nuclei with\nan odd number of nucleons are explored using a microscopic framework of nuclear\nenergy density functionals and a particle-boson core coupling model. The boson\nHamiltonian for the even-even core nucleus, as well as the spherical\nsingle-particle energies and occupation probabilities of unpaired nucleons, are\ncompletely determined by a constrained self-consistent mean-field calculation\nfor a specific choice of the energy density functional and pairing interaction.\nOnly the strength parameters of the particle-core coupling have to be adjusted\nto reproduce a few empirical low-energy spectroscopic properties of the\ncorresponding odd-mass system. The model is applied to the odd-A Ba, Xe, La and\nCs isotopes with mass $A\\approx 130$, for which the corresponding even-even Ba\nand Xe nuclei present a typical case of $\\gamma$-soft nuclear potential. The\ntheoretical results reproduce the experimental low-energy excitation spectra\nand electromagnetic properties, and confirm that a phase transition between\nnearly spherical and $\\gamma$-soft nuclear shapes occurs also in the odd-A\nsystems.\n", "  We analyzed spectral and imaging data from the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS), images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and magnetograms from the Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO. We report observations of small flaring\nloops in the penumbra of a large sunspot on July 19, 2013. Our main event\nconsisted of a loop spanning ~ 15 arcsec, from the umbral-penumbral boundary to\nan opposite polarity region outside the penumbra. It lasted approximately 10\nminutes with a two minute impulsive peak and was observed in all AIA/SDO\nchannels, while the IRIS slit was located near its penumbral footpoint. Mass\nmotions with an apparent velocity of ~ 100 km/s were detected beyond the\nbrightening, starting in the rise phase of the impulsive peak; these were\napparently associated with a higher-lying loop. We interpret these motions in\nterms of two-loop interaction. IRIS spectra in both the C II and Si IV lines\nshowed very extended wings, up to about 400 km/s, first in the blue (upflows)\nand subsequently in the red wing. In addition to the strong lines, emission was\ndetected in the weak lines of Cl I, O I and C I as well as in the Mg II triplet\nlines. Absorption features in the profiles of the C II doublet, the Si IV\ndoublet and the Mg h and k lines indicate the existence of material with a\nlower source function between the brightening and the observer. We attribute\nthis absorption to the higher loop and this adds further credibility to the\ntwo-loop interaction hypothesis. We conclude that the absorption features in\nthe C II, Si IV and Mg II profiles originate in a higher-lying, descending\nloop; as this approached the already activated lower-lying loop, their\ninteraction gave rise to the impulsive peak, the very broad line profiles and\nthe mass motions.\n", "  Path integrals describing quantum many-body systems can be calculated with\nMonte Carlo sampling techniques, but average quantities are often subject to\nsignal-to-noise ratios that degrade exponentially with time. A\nphase-reweighting technique inspired by recent observations of random walk\nstatistics in correlation functions is proposed that allows energy levels to be\nextracted from late-time correlation functions with time-independent\nsignal-to-noise ratios. Phase reweighting effectively includes dynamical\nrefinement of source magnitudes but introduces a bias associated with the\nphase. This bias can be removed by performing an extrapolation, but at the\nexpense of re-introducing a signal-to-noise problem. Lattice Quantum\nChromodynamics calculations of the $\\rho$ and nucleon masses and of the\n$\\Xi\\Xi$ binding energy show consistency between standard results obtained\nusing earlier-time correlation functions and phase-reweighted results using\nlate-time correlation functions inaccessible to standard statistical analysis\nmethods.\n", "  Thanks to the detections of more than 3000 exoplanets these last 20 years,\nstatistical studies have already highlighted some properties in the\ndistribution of the planet parameters. Nevertheless, few studies have yet\ninvestigated the planet populations from short to large separations around the\nsame star since this requires the use of different detection techniques that\nusually target different types of stars. We wish to develop a tool that\ncombines direct and indirect methods so as to correctly investigate the giant\nplanet populations at all separations. We developed the MESS2 code, a Monte\nCarlo simulation code combining radial velocity and direct imaging data\nobtained at different epochs for a given star to estimate the detection\nprobability of giant planets spanning a wide range of physical separations. It\nis based on the generation of synthetic planet populations. We apply MESS2 on a\nyoung M1-type, the nearby star AUMic observed with HARPS and NACO/ESO. We show\nthat giant planet detection limits are significantly improved at intermediate\nseparations (~20au in the case of AUMic). We show that the traditional approach\nof analysing independently the RV and DI detection limits systematically\noverestimates the planet detection limits and hence planet occurrence rates.\nThe use of MESS2 allows to obtain correct planet occurrence rates in\nstatistical studies, making use of multi-epoch DI data and/or RV measurements.\nWe also show that MESS2 can optimise the schedule of future DI observations.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the first and second order cosmological\nperturbations in the light mass Galileon (LMG) scenario. LMG action includes\ncubic Galileon term along with the standard kinetic term and a potential which\nis added phenomenologically to achieve late time acceleration. The scalar field\nis nonminimally coupled to matter in the Einstein frame. Integral solutions of\ngrowing and decaying modes are obtained. The effect of the conformal coupling\nconstant ($\\beta$), at the perturbation level, has been studied. In this\nregard, we have studied linear power spectrum and bispectrum. Though different\nvalues of $\\beta$ has different effects on power spectrum on reduced bispectrum\nthe effect is not significant. It has been found that the redshift-space\ndistortions (RSD) data can be very useful to constrain $\\beta$. In this study\nwe consider potentials which can lead to tracker behavior of the scalar field.\n", "  We consider a two-level open quantum system undergoing either pure dephasing,\ndissipative, or multiply decohering dynamics and show that, whenever the\ndynamics is non-Markovian, the initial speed of evolution is a monotonic\nfunction of the relevant physical parameter driving the transition between the\nMarkovian and non-Markovian behaviour of the dynamics. In particular, within\nthe considered models, a speed increase can only be observed in the presence of\nbackflow of information from the environment to the system.\n", "  The discovery of Proxima b, a terrestrial temperate planet, presents the\nopportunity of studying a potentially habitable world in optimal conditions. A\nkey aspect to model its habitability is to understand the radiation environment\nof the planet in the full spectral domain. We characterize the X-rays to mid-IR\nradiative properties of Proxima with the goal of providing the\ntop-of-atmosphere fluxes on the planet. We also aim at constraining the\nfundamental properties of the star. We employ observations from a large number\nof facilities and make use of different methodologies to piece together the\nfull spectral energy distribution of Proxima. In the high-energy domain, we pay\nparticular attention to the contribution by rotational modulation, activity\ncycle, and flares so that the data provided are representative of the overall\nradiation dose received by the atmosphere of the planet. We present the full\nspectrum of Proxima covering 0.7 to 30000 nm. The integration of the data shows\nthat the top-of-atmosphere average XUV irradiance on Proxima b is 0.293 W m^-2,\ni.e., nearly 60 times higher than Earth, and that the total irradiance is\n877+/-44 W m^-2, or 64+/-3% of the solar constant but with a significantly\nredder spectrum. We also provide laws for the XUV evolution of Proxima\ncorresponding to two scenarios. Regarding the fundamental properties of\nProxima, we find M=0.120+/-0.003 Msun, R=0.146+/-0.007 Rsun, Teff=2980+/-80 K,\nand L=0.00151+/-0.00008 Lsun. In addition, our analysis reveals a ~20% excess\nin the 3-30 micron flux of the star that is best interpreted as arising from\nwarm dust in the system. The data provided here should be useful to further\ninvestigate the current atmospheric properties of Proxima b as well as its past\nhistory, with the overall aim of firmly establishing the habitability of the\nplanet.\n", "  The model proposed by Georgi and Machacek enables the Higgs sector to involve\nisospin triplet scalar fields while retaining a custodial $SU(2)_V$ symmetry in\nthe potential and thus ensuring the electroweak $\\rho$ parameter to be one at\ntree level. This custodial symmetry, however, is explicitly broken by loop\neffects of the $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge gauge interaction. In order to make the\nmodel consistent at high energies, we construct the most general form of the\nHiggs potential without the custodial symmetry, and then we derive the one-loop\n$\\beta$-functions for all the model parameters. Assuming the $\\delta_i$\nquantities describing the custodial symmetry breaking to be zero at low energy,\nwe find that $|\\delta_i|$ are typically smaller than the magnitude of the\n$U(1)_Y$ gauge coupling and the other running parameters in the potential also\nat high energy without spoiling perturbativity and vacuum stability. We also\nclarify that the mass degeneracy among the $SU(2)_V$ 5-plet and 3-plet Higgs\nbosons is smoothly broken by $\\sim 0.1\\%$ corrections. These results show that\nthe amount of the custodial symmetry breaking is well kept under control up to\nenergies close to the theory cutoff.\n", "  CONTEXT: For more than two decades, stellar atmosphere codes have been used\nto derive the stellar and wind parameters of massive stars. Although they have\nbecome a powerful tool and sufficiently reproduce the observed spectral\nappearance, they can hardly be used for more than measuring parameters. One\nmajor obstacle is their inconsistency between the calculated radiation field\nand the wind stratification due to the usage of prescribed mass-loss rates and\nwind-velocity fields. AIMS: We present the concepts for a new generation of\nhydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE)\nstellar atmosphere models that allow for detailed studies of radiation-driven\nstellar winds. As a first demonstration, this new kind of model is applied to a\nmassive O star. METHODS: Based on earlier works, the PoWR code has been\nextended with the option to consistently solve the hydrodynamic equation\ntogether with the statistical equations and the radiative transfer in order to\nobtain a hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere stratification. In these\nmodels, the whole velocity field is iteratively updated together with an\nadjustment of the mass-loss rate. RESULTS: The concepts for obtaining\nhydrodynamically consistent models using a comoving-frame radiative transfer\nare outlined. To provide a useful benchmark, we present a demonstration model,\nwhich was motivated to describe the well-studied O4 supergiant Zeta Pup. The\nobtained stellar and wind parameters are within the current range of literature\nvalues. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the PoWR code has been used to obtain\na hydrodynamically consistent model for a massive O star. This has been\nachieved by a profound revision of earlier concepts used for Wolf-Rayet stars.\nThe velocity field is shaped by various elements contributing to the radiative\nacceleration, especially in the outer wind. (...)\n", "  The charge asymmetry due to higher-order QED corrections in elastic\nlepton-proton scattering is estimated without employing the ultrarelativistic\napproximation. Our calculation is performed by generalizing the soft-photon\napproximation approach suggested by Tsai. Corresponding loop integrals that\ntake a form of Passarino-Veltman scalar three-point functions are calculated\nanalytically without neglecting the mass of the lepton. Our results provide\nmodel-independent charge asymmetry predictions for scattering of unpolarized\nand massive leptons on proton targets. These predictions can be used in\ncorresponding experiments to determine the contribution coming from\nmodel-dependent hard two-photon exchange processes.\n", "  In this work, the role which three-dimensional shaping plays in the\ngeneration of rotational transform in toroidal magnetically confinement devices\nis explored. The susceptance matrix as defined by Strand & Houlberg (2001) is\npresented and compared to simulations of three dimensional MHD equilibria. The\ndependence of the edge rotational transform on axisymmetric shaping is briefly\nexplored. It is then shown how simple three dimensional shaping can drive\nrotational transform in a simply shaped stellarator. It is found that modes\nwith high poloidal mode number drive edge transform with little effect on the\ncore, while modes with poloidal mode m < 2 drive both edge and core rotational\ntransforms. This work concludes with a discussion of the non-linearity of the\nthree dimensional shape space as defined in terms of magnetic symmetry.\n", "  (abridged) Type II and anomalous Cepheids (ACs) are useful distance\nindicators when there are too few classical Cepheids or when RR Lyrae stars are\ntoo faint. We study the sample of 335 Type II and ACs in the Small and Large\nMCls detected in OGLE-III data.The SEDs are constructed and fitted with a dust\nradiative transfer model, thereby leading to a determination of luminosity and\neffective temperature.In addition, a subsample of targets is investigated for\npossible binarity by looking for the light-time travel effect (LITE).\nHertzsprung-Russell diagrams (HRD) are constructed and compared to evolutionary\ntracks and theoretical instability strips (ISs). In agreement with previous\nsuggestions, the BL Her subclass can be explained by the evolution of\n$\\sim$0.5-0.6~\\msol\\ stars evolving off the ZAHB and the ACs can be explained\nby the evolution of $\\sim$1.1-2.3~\\msol\\ stars. The evolution of the W Vir\nsubclass is not clear. A relation to binarity might be at the origin of the W\nVir stars, which has already been explicitly suggested for the peculiar W Vir\nstars. For $\\sim60\\%$ of the RV Tau and $\\sim 10\\%$ of the W Vir objects an\ninfrared excess is detected from the SED fitting. A recent result is confirmed\nthat stars exist with luminosities below that predicted from single-star\nevolution, which show a clear infrared excess, and the shape of the excess\nsuggests a connection to binary evolution. The investigation of the LITE effect\nrevealed 20 systems that appear to show periodic variations and may be new\nbinaries, although this study requires follow-up. About 40 stars show\nsignificant period changes.\n", "  It is not well known what drives the chemistry of a protostellar envelope, in\nparticular the role of the stellar mass and the outflows on its chemical\nenrichment. We study the chemical structure of NGC 1333 IRAS 4A in order to (i)\ninvestigate the influence of the outflows on the chemistry, (ii) constrain the\nage of our object, (iii) compare it with a typical high-mass protostellar\nenvelope. In our analysis we use JCMT line mapping and HIFI pointed spectra. To\nstudy the influence of the outflow on the degree of deuteration, we compare\nJCMT maps of HCO+ and DCO+ with non-LTE (RADEX) models in a region that\nspatially covers the outflow activity of IRAS 4A. To study the envelope\nchemistry, we derive empirical molecular abundance profiles for the observed\nspecies using the radiative transfer code (RATRAN) and adopting a 1D dust\ndensity/temperature profile from the literature. We compare our best-fit\nobserved abundance profiles with the predictions from the time dependent gas\ngrain chemical code (ALCHEMIC). The CO, HCN, HNC and CN abundance require an\nenhanced UV field which points towards an outflow cavity. The abundances (wrt\nH2) are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those observed in the high mass\nprotostellar envelope (AFGL 2591), while they are found to be similar within\nfactors of a few with respect to CO. Differences in UV radiation may be\nresponsible for such chemical differentiation, but temperature differences seem\na more plausible explanation. The CH3OH modeled abundance profile points\ntowards an age of > 4x10^4 yrs for IRAS 4A. The spatial distribution of H2D+\ndiffers from that of other deuterated species, indicating an origin from a\nforeground colder layer (<20 K). The observed abundances can be explained by\npassive heating towards the high mass protostellar envelope, while the presence\nof UV cavity channels become more important toward the low mass protostellar\nenvelope.\n", "  We introduce and implement an importance-sampling Monte Carlo algorithm to\nstudy systems of globally-coupled oscillators. Our computational method\nefficiently obtains estimates of the tails of the distribution of various\nmeasures of dynamical trajectories corresponding to states occurring with\n(exponentially) small probabilities. We demonstrate the general validity of our\nresults by applying the method to two contrasting cases: the driven-dissipative\nKuramoto model, a paradigm in the study of spontaneous synchronization; and the\nconservative Hamiltonian mean-field model, a prototypical system of long-range\ninteractions. We present results for the distribution of the finite-time\nLyapunov exponent and a time-averaged order parameter. Among other features,\nour results show most notably that the distributions exhibit a vanishing\nstandard deviation but a skewness that is increasing in magnitude with the\nnumber of oscillators, implying that non-trivial asymmetries and states\nyielding rare/atypical values of the observables persist even for a large\nnumber of oscillators.\n", "  We present constraints on variations in the initial mass function (IMF) of\nnine local early-type galaxies based on their low mass X-ray binary (LMXB)\npopulations. Comprised of accreting black holes and neutron stars, these LMXBs\ncan be used to constrain the important high mass end of the IMF. We consider\nthe LMXB populations beyond the cores of the galaxies ($>0.2R_{e}$; covering\n$75-90\\%$ of their stellar light) and find no evidence for systematic\nvariations of the IMF with velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$). We reject IMFs which\nbecome increasingly bottom heavy with $\\sigma$, up to steep power-laws\n(exponent, $\\alpha>2.8$) in massive galaxies ($\\sigma>300$km/s), for\ngalactocentric radii $>1/4\\ R_{e}$. Previously proposed IMFs that become\nincreasingly bottom heavy with $\\sigma$ are consistent with these data if only\nthe number of low mass stars $(<0.5M_{\\odot}$) varies. We note that our results\nare consistent with some recent work which proposes that extreme IMFs are only\npresent in the central regions of these galaxies. We also consider IMFs that\nbecome increasingly top-heavy with $\\sigma$, resulting in significantly more\nLMXBs. Such a model is consistent with these observations, but additional data\nare required to significantly distinguish between this and an invariant IMF.\nFor six of these galaxies, we directly compare with published IMF mismatch\nparameters from the Atlas3D survey, $\\alpha_{dyn}$. We find good agreement with\nthe LMXB population if galaxies with higher $\\alpha_{dyn}$ have more top-heavy\nIMFs -- although we caution that our sample is quite small. Future LMXB\nobservations can provide further insights into the origin of $\\alpha_{dyn}$\nvariations.\n", "  Tidal streams of disrupting dwarf galaxies orbiting around their host galaxy\noffer a unique way to constrain the shape of galactic gravitational potentials.\nSuch streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic\nscales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an\nalternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND),\nand we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical\nevolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a\nrealistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the\npresent-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its\nimmense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom\non the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total\nluminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size\nrelation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our\nsimulations and observations of this system. The observed stellar velocities in\nthe leading arm can be reproduced if we include a massive hot gas corona around\nthe Milky Way that is flattened in the direction of the principal plane of its\nsatellites. This is the first time that tidal dissolution in MOND has been\ntested rigorously at these mass and acceleration scales.\n", "  Shifting the Fermi energy in solids by doping, defect formation or gating\ngenerally results in changes in the charge density distribution, which reflect\nthe ability of the bonding pattern in solids to adjust to such external\nperturbations. In the ionic limit, such changes are described by the formal\noxidation states (FOS) whereby a single atom type is presumed to absorb the\nfull burden of the perturbation (change in charge) of the whole compound. In\nthis picture, when the solar absorber CsSnI3 loses 50 % of its Sn atoms thereby\nforming the ordered vacancy compound Cs2SnI6, the Sn is said to change from\nSn2+ to Sn4+. In reality, the charge redistribution is more complex. To\nunderstand the electronic properties of these two groups and to gauge the\ntrends in s-electron charge on the nucleus, we studied the 113/216 compound\npairs CsSnCl3/Cs2SnCl6; CsSnBr3/Cs2SnBr6, and CsSnI3/Cs2SnI6. We have\ncalculated the electronic structure of these three compound pairs,\ncomplementing them by CsSnF3/Cs2SnF6 in the hypothetical cubic structure for\ncompleting the chemical trends. These materials were also synthesized by\nchemical routes and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy\nand K-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. We find that in going from 113 to 216\nthere is a decrease in the s charge on Sn, in agreement with the FOS picture.\nHowever, at the same time, we observe an increase of the p charge via downshift\nof the otherwise unoccupied p level, an effect that tends to replenish much of\nthe lost s charge. This effect is theoretically explained as a self-regulating\nresponse [H. Raebiger, S. Lany, and A. Zunger, Nature 453, 763 (2008)] whereby\nthe system re-hybridizes to minimize the effect of the charge perturbation\ncreated by vacancy formation. Our work clarifies the relation between FOS and\ncharge transfer that can be applied to a wide variety of materials.\n", "  Quenches in isolated quantum systems are currently a subject of intense\nstudy. Here, we consider quantum few-mode systems that are integrable in their\nclassical mean-field limit and become dynamically unstable after a quench of a\nsystem parameter. Specifically, we study a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a\ndouble-well potential and an antiferromagnetic spinor BEC constrained to a\nsingle spatial mode. We study the time dynamics after the quench within the\ntruncated Wigner approximation (TWA) and find that system relaxes to a steady\nstate due to phase-space mixing. Using the action-angle formalism and a\npendulum as an illustration, we derive general analytical expressions for the\ntime evolution of expectation values of observables and their long-time limits.\nWe find that the deviation of the long-time expectation value from its\nclassical value scales as $1/O(\\ln N )$, where $N$ is the number of atoms in\nthe condensate. Furthermore, the relaxation of an observable to its steady\nstate value is a damped oscillation and the damping is Gaussian in time. We\nconfirm our results with numerical TWA simulations.\n", "  We develop a complexity measure for large-scale economic systems based on\nShannon's concept of entropy. By adopting Leontief's perspective of the\nproduction process as a circular flow, we formulate the process as a Markov\nchain. Then we derive a measure of economic complexity as the average number of\nbits required to encode the flow of goods and services in the production\nprocess. We illustrate this measure using data from seven national economies,\nspanning several decades.\n", "  The theory of full counting statistics allows complete characterization of\ncharge transport processes through nanoscale systems. The majority of existing\ntheoretical treatments used to obtain the current cumulants rely on\nperturbative approximations with respect to either the system-bath coupling or\nthe electronic tunnelling coupling within the system. This is not generally\nwell suited to electron transfer through organic molecules where these\ncouplings can be on the same order of magnitude. Here we present a\nnon-perturbative approach that uses the formalism of the hierarchical equations\nof motion to describe the system-bath dynamics while retaining a weak coupling\nwith respect to source and drain leads. The scope of this new framework is\ndemonstrated by comparisons with a perturbative approach for a dimer system\ncoupled to a thermal bath. The inadequacy of the perturbative approach to\ndescribe current fluctuations in a variety of regimes is shown.\n", "  In recent years it has been claimed that the length of stellar activity\ncycles is determined by the stellar rotation rate. It is observed that the\ncycle period increases with rotation period along the so-called active and\ninactive sequences. In this picture the Sun occupies a solitary position in\nbetween the two sequences. Our goal is to measure cyclic variations of the\nstellar light curve amplitude and the rotation period using four years of\nKepler data. Periodic changes of the light curve amplitude or the stellar\nrotation period are associated with an underlying activity cycle. Using the\nMcQuillan et al. 2014 sample we compute the rotation period and the variability\namplitude for each Kepler quarter and search for periodic variations of both\ntime series. To test for periodicity in each stellar time series we consider\nLomb-Scargle periodograms and use a selection based on a False Alarm\nProbability (FAP). We detect amplitude periodicities in 3203 stars between\n0.5-6 years covering rotation periods between 1-40 days. Given our sample size\nof 23,601 stars and our selection criteria that the FAP is less than 5%, this\nnumber is almost three times higher than that expected from pure noise. We do\nnot detect periodicities in the rotation period beyond those expected from\nnoise. Our measurements reveal that the cycle period shows a weak dependence on\nrotation rate, slightly increasing for longer rotation period. We further show\nthat the shape of the variability deviates from a pure sine curve, consistent\nwith observations of the solar cycle. Our measurements do not support the\nexistence of distinct sequences in the P_rot-P_cyc plane, although there is\nsome evidence for the inactive sequence for rotation periods between 5-25 days.\nUnfortunately, the total observing time is too short to draw sound conclusions\non activity cycles with similar length as the solar cycle.\n", "  Long-range interactions and, in particular, two-body potentials with\npower-law long-distance tails are ubiquitous in nature. For two bosons or\nfermions in one spatial dimension, the latter case being formally equivalent to\nthree-dimensional $s$-wave scattering, we show how generic asymptotic\ninteraction tails can be accounted for in the long-distance limit of scattering\nwave functions. This is made possible by introducing a generalisation of the\ncollisional phase shifts to include space dependence. We show that this\ndistance dependence is universal, in that it does not depend on short-distance\ndetails of the interaction. The energy dependence is also universal, and is\nfully determined by the asymptotic tails of the two-body potential. As an\nimportant application of our findings, we describe how to eliminate finite-size\neffects with long-range potentials in the calculation of scattering phase\nshifts from exact diagonalisation. We show that even with moderately small\nsystem sizes it is possible to accurately extract phase shifts that would\notherwise be plagued with finite-size errors. We also consider multi-channel\nscattering, focusing on the estimation of open channel asymptotic interaction\nstrengths via finite-size analysis.\n", "  Neutron diffraction and magnetic susceptibility studies of a polycrystalline\nSrCr$_2$As$_2$ sample reveal that this compound is an itinerant G-type\nantiferromagnet below the N${\\rm \\acute{e}}$el temperature $T_{\\textrm N}$ =\n590(5) K with the Cr magnetic moments aligned along the tetragonal $c$ axis.\nThe system remains tetragonal to the lowest measured temperature ($\\sim$12 K).\nThe lattice parameter ratio $c/a$ and the magnetic moment saturate at about the\nsame temperature below $\\sim$ 200 K, indicating a possible magnetoelastic\ncoupling. The ordered moment, $\\mu=1.9(1)~\\mu_{\\rm B}$/Cr, measured at $T = 12$\nK, is significantly reduced compared to its localized value ($4~\\mu_{\\rm\nB}$/Cr) due to the itinerant character brought about by the hybridization\nbetween the Cr $3d$ and As $4p$ orbitals.\n", "  We study resonant radiation generated by bound solitons in a twin-core fiber\nnear zero-dispersion wavelength, in the presence of higher order dispersion\nterms. We propose a theoretical description of dispersive wave generation\nmechanism and derive resonance conditions. The presence of third order\ndispersion term leads to generation of polychromatic dispersive radiation and\ntransition from the regime of center of mass oscillations to the regime of\namplitude oscillations. Such a transition is not reproduced in the case of\nsymmetric fourth order dispersion.\n", "  In supersymmetric axion models, if the gravitino or axino is the lightest\nSUSY particle (LSP), the other is often the next-to-LSP (NLSP). We investigate\nthe cosmology of such a scenario and point out that the lifetime of the NLSP\nnaturally becomes comparable to the present age of the universe in a viable\nparameter region. This is a well-motivated example of the so-called decaying\ndark matter model, which is recently considered as an extension of the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model to relax some cosmological tensions.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive redshift-space distortion analysis based on cosmic\nvoids in the large-scale distribution of galaxies observed with the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. To this end, we measure multipoles of the void-galaxy\ncross-correlation function and compare them with standard model predictions in\ncosmology. Merely considering linear-order theory allows us to accurately\ndescribe the data on the entire available range of scales and to probe\nvoid-centric distances down to about $2h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$. Common systematics,\nsuch as the Fingers-of-God effect, scale-dependent galaxy bias, and nonlinear\nclustering do not seem to play a significant role in our analysis. We constrain\nthe growth rate of structure via the redshift-space distortion parameter\n$\\beta$ at two median redshifts, $\\beta(\\bar{z}=0.32)=0.599^{+0.134}_{-0.124}$\nand $\\beta(\\bar{z}=0.54)=0.457^{+0.056}_{-0.054}$, with a precision that is\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art galaxy-clustering results. While the\nhigh-redshift constraint perfectly agrees with model expectations, we observe a\nmild $2\\sigma$ deviation at $\\bar{z}=0.32$, which increases to $3\\sigma$ when\nthe data is restricted to the lowest available redshift range of $0.15<z<0.33$.\n", "  With the increasing number of deep multi-wavelength galaxy surveys, the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies has become an invaluable tool\nfor studying the formation of their structures and their evolution. In this\ncontext, standard analysis relies on simple spectro-photometric selection\ncriteria based on a few SED colors. If this fully supervised classification\nalready yielded clear achievements, it is not optimal to extract relevant\ninformation from the data. In this article, we propose to employ very recent\nadvances in machine learning, and more precisely in feature learning, to derive\na data-driven diagram. We show that the proposed approach based on denoising\nautoencoders recovers the bi-modality in the galaxy population in an\nunsupervised manner, without using any prior knowledge on galaxy SED\nclassification. This technique has been compared to principal component\nanalysis (PCA) and to standard color/color representations. In addition,\npreliminary results illustrate that this enables the capturing of extra\nphysically meaningful information, such as redshift dependence, galaxy mass\nevolution and variation over the specific star formation rate. PCA also results\nin an unsupervised representation with physical properties, such as mass and\nsSFR, although this representation separates out. less other characteristics\n(bimodality, redshift evolution) than denoising autoencoders.\n", "  Context. Studies on compact galaxy groups have led to the conclusion that a\nplenitude of phenomena take place in between galaxies that form them. However,\nradio data on these objects are extremely scarce and not much is known\nconcerning the existence and role of the magnetic field in intergalactic space.\nAims. We aim to study a small sample of galaxy groups that look promising as\npossible sources of intergalactic magnetic fields; for example data from radio\nsurveys suggest that most of the radio emission is due to extended, diffuse\nstructures in and out of the galaxies. Methods. We used the Effelsberg 100 m\nradio telescope at 4.85 GHz and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data at 1.40 GHz.\nAfter subtraction of compact sources we analysed the maps searching for\ndiffuse, intergalactic radio emission. Spectral index and magnetic field\nproperties were derived. Results. Intergalactic magnetic fields exist in groups\nHCG 15 and HCG 60, whereas there are no signs of them in HCG 68. There are also\nhints of an intergalactic bridge in HCG 44 at 4.85 GHz. Conclusions.\nIntergalactic magnetic fields exist in galaxy groups and their energy density\nmay be comparable to the thermal (X-ray) density, suggesting an important role\nof the magnetic field in the intra-group medium, wherever it is detected.\n", "  We present millimetre dust emission measurements of two Lyman Break Galaxies\nat z~3 and construct for the first time fully sampled infrared spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs), from mid-IR to the Rayleigh-Jeans tail, of individually\ndetected, unlensed, UV-selected, main sequence (MS) galaxies at $z=3$. The SED\nmodelling of the two sources confirms previous findings, based on stacked\nensembles, of an increasing mean radiation field <U> with redshift, consistent\nwith a rapidly decreasing gas metallicity in z > 2 galaxies. Complementing our\nstudy with CO[3-2] emission line observations, we measure the molecular gas\nmass (M_H2) reservoir of the systems using three independent approaches: 1) CO\nline observations, 2) the dust to gas mass ratio vs metallicity relation and 3)\na single band, dust emission flux on the Rayleigh-Jeans side of the SED. All\ntechniques return consistent M_H2 estimates within a factor of ~2 or less,\nyielding gas depletion time-scales (tau_dep ~ 0.35 Gyrs) and gas-to-stellar\nmass ratios (M_H2/M* ~ 0.5-1) for our z~3 massive MS galaxies. The overall\nproperties of our galaxies are consistent with trends and relations established\nat lower redshifts, extending the apparent uniformity of star-forming galaxies\nover the last 11.5 billion years.\n", "  Establishing good electrical contacts to nanoscale devices is a major issue\nfor modern technology and contacting 2D materials is no exception to the rule.\nOne-dimensional edge-contacts to graphene were recently shown to outperform\nsurface contacts but the method remains difficult to scale up. We report a\nresist-free and scalable method to fabricate few graphene layers with\nelectrical contacts in a single growth step. This method derives from the\ndiscovery reported here of the growth of few graphene layers on a metallic\ncarbide by thermal annealing of a carbide forming metallic film on SiC in high\nvacuum. We exploit the combined effect of edge-contact and partially-covalent\nsurface epitaxy between graphene and the metallic carbide to fabricate devices\nin which low contact-resistance and Josephson effect are observed. Implementing\nthis approach could significantly simplify the realization of large-scale\ngraphene circuits.\n", "  We study a general flat space/boson star transition model in quasi-local\nensemble through approaches familiar from holographic superconductor theories.\nWe manage to find a parameter $\\psi_{2}$, which is proved to be useful in\ndisclosing properties of phase transitions. In this work, we explore effects of\nthe scalar mass, scalar charge and St$\\ddot{u}$ckelberg mechanism on the\ncritical phase transition points and the order of transitions mainly from\nbehaviors of the parameter $\\psi_{2}$. We mention that properties of\ntransitions in quasi-local gravity are strikingly similar to those in\nholographic superconductor models. We also obtain an analytical relation\n$\\psi_{2}\\varpropto(\\mu-\\mu_{c})^{1/2}$, which also holds for the condensed\nscalar operator in the holographic insulator/superconductor system in\naccordance with mean field theories.\n", "  Context. Mars-crossing asteroids (MCs) are a dynamically unstable group\nbetween the main belt and the near-Earth populations. Characterising the\nphysical properties of a large sample of MCs can help to understand the\noriginal sources of many near-Earth asteroids, some of which may produce\nmeteorites on Earth. Aims. Our aim is to provide diameters and albedos of MCs\nwith available WISE/NEOWISE data. Methods. We used the near-Earth asteroid\nthermal model to find the best-fitting values of equivalent diameter and,\nwhenever possible, the infrared beaming parameter. With the diameter and\ntabulated asteroid absolute magnitudes we also computed the visible geometric\nalbedos. Results. We determined the diameters and beaming parameters of 404\nobjects observed during the fully cryogenic phase of the WISE mission, most of\nwhich have not been published elsewhere. We also obtained 1572 diameters from\ndata from the 3-Band and posterior non-cryogenic phases using a default value\nof beaming parameter. The average beaming parameter is 1.2 +/- 0.2 for objects\nsmaller than 10 km, which constitute most of our sample. This is higher than\nthe typical value of 1.0 found for the whole main belt and is possibly related\nto the fact that WISE is able to observe many more small objects at shorter\nheliocentric distances, i.e. at higher phase angles. We argue that this is a\nbetter default value for modelling Mars-crossing asteroids from the\nWISE/NEOWISE catalogue and discuss the effects of this choice on the diameter\nand albedo distributions. We find a double-peaked distribution for the visible\ngeometric albedos, which is expected since this population is compositionally\ndiverse and includes objects in the major spectral complexes. However, the\ndistribution of beaming parameters is homogeneous for both low- and high-albedo\nobjects.\n", "  The detectability of gravitational waves originating from primordial black\nholes or other large macroscopic dark-matter candidates inspiraling into\nSagittarius ${\\rm A}^{\\!*}$ is investigated. It is shown that LISA should be a\nformidable machine to detect the stochastic signal from the accumulated\ncollection of such objects that have been gravitationally captured by\nSgr$\\,{\\rm A}^{\\!*}$, provided they have masses above $\\sim\n10^{-20}\\,M_{\\odot}$. This is especially so, if they are the main component of\nthe dark matter, and the dark-matter density at Sagittarius ${\\rm A}^{\\!*}$\nexceeds its value in the solar-neighborhood. Notably, the window of mass that\nis unconstrained by various gravitational lensing arguments and observations,\n$2 \\times 10^{20}\\,{\\rm g} \\leq m_{\\rm DM} \\leq 4 \\times 10^{24}\\,{\\rm g}$,\nwill be accessible. Forecasts are derived for the event rates and signal\nstrengths as a function of dark-matter mass, assuming that the dark-matter\ncandidates are not tidally disrupted during the inspiral. This is certainly the\ncase for primordial black holes, and it shown that it is also very likely the\ncase for candidate objects of nuclear density.\n", "  We present an experimental determination of the $4 \\: S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 6\\:\nS_{1/2}$ transition frequency in atomic potassium, $^{39}$K, using direct\nfrequency comb spectroscopy. The output of a stabilized optical frequency comb\nwas used to excite a thermal atomic vapor. The repetition rate of the frequency\ncomb was scanned and the transitions were excited using step-wise two-photon\nexcitation. The center of gravity frequency for the transition was found to be\n$\\nu_\\textrm{cog} = 822\\, 951\\, 698.09(13)$ MHz and the measured hyperfine $A$\ncoefficient of the $6\\: S_{1/2}$ state was $21.93(11)$ MHz. The measurements\nare in agreement with previous values and represent an improvement by a factor\nof 700 in the uncertainty of the center of gravity measurement.\n", "  This thesis presents the results of the experimental study performed on spin\nqubits realized in gate-defined gallium arsenide quantum dots, with the focus\non noise suppression and long-distance coupling.\n", "  Spin-current generation by fluid motion is theoretically investigated. Based\non quantum kinetic theory, the spin-diffusion equation coupled with fluid\nvorticity is derived. We show that spin currents are generated by the vorticity\ngradient in both laminar and turbulent flows and that the generated spin\ncurrents can be detected by the inverse spin Hall voltage measurements, which\nare predicted to be proportional to the flow velocity in a laminar flow. In\ncontrast, the voltage in a turbulent flow is proportional to the square of the\nflow velocity. This study will pave the way to fluid spintronics.\n", "  PhD thesis dealing with various aspects of multipartite entanglement, such as\nentanglement measures, absolutely maximally entangled states, bell\ninequalities, entanglement spectrum and quantum frustration. Also some quantum\nalgorithms run with the IBM quantum computer are covered, together with others\napplied to adiabatic quantum computation and quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  ZwCl 2341.1+0000, a merging galaxy cluster with disturbed X-ray morphology\nand widely separated ($\\sim$3 Mpc) double radio relics, was thought to be an\nextremely massive ($10-30 \\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$) and complex system with\nlittle known about its merger history. We present JVLA 2-4 GHz observations of\nthe cluster, along with new spectroscopy from our Keck/DEIMOS survey, and apply\nGaussian Mixture Modeling to the three-dimensional distribution of 227\nconfirmed cluster galaxies. After adopting the Bayesian Information Criterion\nto avoid overfitting, which we discover can bias total dynamical mass estimates\nhigh, we find that a three-substructure model with a total dynamical mass\nestimate of $9.39 \\pm 0.81 \\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$ is favored. We also present\ndeep Subaru imaging and perform the first weak lensing analysis on this system,\nobtaining a weak lensing mass estimate of $5.57 \\pm 2.47 \\times 10^{14}\nM_\\odot$. This is a more robust estimate because it does not depend on the\ndynamical state of the system, which is disturbed due to the merger. Our\nresults indicate that ZwCl 2341.1+0000 is a multiple merger system comprised of\nat least three substructures, with the main merger that produced the radio\nrelics occurring near to the plane of the sky, and a younger merger in the\nNorth occurring closer to the line of sight. Dynamical modeling of the main\nmerger reproduces observed quantities (relic positions and polarizations,\nsubcluster separation and radial velocity difference), if the merger axis angle\nof $\\sim$10$^{+34}_{-6}$ degrees and the collision speed at pericenter is\n$\\sim$1900$^{+300}_{-200}$ km/s.\n", "  Based on Bohr model, we have presented a general formalism describing the\ncollective motion for any deformed system, in which the collective Hamiltonian\nis expressed as vibrations in the body-fixed frame, rotation of whole system\naround the laboratory frame, and coupling between vibrations and rotation.\nUnder the condition of decoupling approximation, we have derived the quantized\nHamiltonian operator. Based on the operator, we have calculated the rotational\nspectra for some special octupole and hexadecapole deformed systems, and shown\ntheir dependencies on deformation. The result indicates that the contribution\nof octupole or hexadecapole deformations to the lowest band is regular, while\nthat to higher bands is dramatic. These features reflecting octupole and\nhexadecapole deformations are helpful to recognize the properties of real\nnuclei with octupole and/or hexadecapole deformations coexisting with\nquadrupole deformations.\n", "  The constant pairing Hamiltonian holds exact solutions worked out by\nRichardson in the early Sixties. This exact solution of the pairing Hamiltonian\nregained interest at the end of the Nineties. The discret complex-energy states\nhad been included in the Richardson's solutions by Hasegawa et al. [1]. In this\ncontribution we reformulate the problem of determining the exact eigenenergies\nof the pairing Hamiltonian when the continuum is included through the single\nparticle level density. The solutions with discret complex-energy states is\nrecovered by analytic continuation of the equations to the complex energy\nplane. This formulation may be applied to loosely bound system where the\ncorrelations with the continuum-spectrum of energy is really important. Some\ndetails are given to show how the many-body eigenenergy emerges as sum of the\npair-energies.\n", "  We explore the possibility that Fast Radio Bursts are due to the annihilation\nof cusps on cosmic string loops. We compute the energy released in the\nannihilation events in the radio region, the expected event rate, and the time\nscale of the bursts. We find that the energy and event rates are sufficiently\nhigh and the time scale is sufficiently small to explain the current data. We\npredict how the event rate will change as the resolution of telescopes\nimproves. Since the burst rate depends on the string tension, future data will\nallow the determination of the tension.\n", "  We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of a damped Peyrard-Bishop DNA model\ntaking into account long-range interactions with distance dependence |l|^-s on\nthe elastic coupling constant between different DNA base pairs. Considering\nboth Stokes and long-range hydrodynamical damping forces, we use the discrete\ndifference operator technique and show in the short wavelength modes that the\nlattice equation can be governed by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We\nfound analytically that the technique leads to the correct expression for the\nbreather soliton parameters. We found that the viscosity makes the amplitude of\nthe breather to damp out. We compare the approximate analytic results with\nnumerical simulations for the value s = 3 (dipole-dipole interactions).\n", "  Quantum state discrimination underlies various applications in quantum\ninformation processing tasks. It essentially describes the distinguishability\nof quantum systems in different states, and the general process of extracting\nclassical information from quantum systems. It is also useful in quantum\ninformation applications, such as the characterisation of mutual information in\ncryptographic protocols, or as a technique to derive fundamental theorems in\nquantum foundations. It has deep connections to physical principles such as\nrelativistic causality. Quantum state discrimination traces a long history of\nseveral decades, starting with the early attempts to formalise information\nprocessing of physical systems such as optical communication with photons.\nNevertheless, in most cases, optimal strategies of quantum state discrimination\nremain unsolved, and related applications are valid in some limited cases only.\nThe present review aims to provide an overview on quantum state discrimination,\ncovering some recent progress, and addressing applications in some selected\ntopics. This review serves to strengthen the link between results in quantum\nstate discrimination and quantum information applications, by showing the ways\nin which the fundamental results are exploited in applications and vice versa.\n", "  Physical laws are a set of rules in the relationship between observations\nmade by the experimenter. All these observations are made through a mechanism\nthat links the external world to the experimenter's awareness, a mechanism\nwhich is not under the experimenter's control. We discuss how this mechanism\ncan affect the physical laws as implied by the experimenter, and define\nfundamental physical laws as the ones which remain invariant under the change\nof such mechanism.\n", "  We investigate adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs with power-law degree\ndistribution. Motivation for this study is twofold. First, vibrational states\nin granular matter and jammed sphere packings; second, graphs encoding social\ninteraction, especially electronic commerce. We establish the position of the\nmobility edge, and show that it strongly depends on the power in the degree\ndistribution and on the ratio of the sizes of the two parts of the bipartite\ngraph. At the jamming threshold, where the two parts have the same size,\nlocalization vanishes. We found that the multifractal spectrum is non-trivial\nin the delocalized phase, but still near the mobility edge. We also study an\nempirical bipartite graph, namely the Amazon reviewer-item network. We found\nthat in this specific graph mobility edge disappears and we draw a conclusion\nfrom this fact regarding earlier empirical studies of the Amazon network.\n", "  We report magnetic and calorimetric measurements down to T = 1 mK on the\ncanonical heavy-electron metal YbRh2Si2. The data reveal the development of\nnuclear antiferromagnetic order slightly above 2 mK. The latter weakens the\nprimary electronic antiferromagnetism, thereby paving the way for\nheavy-electron superconductivity below Tc = 2 mK. Our results demonstrate that\nsuperconductivity driven by quantum criticality is a general phenomenon.\n", "  Semiconductor nanowires have opened new research avenues in quantum transport\nowing to their confined geometry and electrostatic tunability. They have\noffered an exceptional testbed for superconductivity, leading to the\nrealization of hybrid systems combining the macroscopic quantum properties of\nsuperconductors with the possibility to control charges down to a single\nelectron. These advances brought semiconductor nanowires to the forefront of\nefforts to realize topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. A prime\nchallenge to benefit from the topological properties of Majoranas is to reduce\nthe disorder in hybrid nanowire devices. Here, we show ballistic\nsuperconductivity in InSb semiconductor nanowires. Our structural and chemical\nanalyses demonstrate a high-quality interface between the nanowire and a NbTiN\nsuperconductor which enables ballistic transport. This is manifested by a\nquantized conductance for normal carriers, a strongly enhanced conductance for\nAndreev-reflecting carriers, and an induced hard gap with a significantly\nreduced density of states. These results pave the way for disorder-free\nMajorana devices.\n", "  A relativistic electron beam propagating through plasma induces a return\ncurrent in the system. Such a system of counterstreaming forward and return\ncurrent is susceptible to host of instabilities out of which Weibel remains a\ndominant mode for destabilizing the system. Weibel instability has been widely\ninvestigated in simulations, experiments, as well as, analytically using fluid\nand kinetic treatments. A purely growing mode like Weibel instability can also\nbe understood by using conservation theorems and energy principle analysis. An\nelectrostatic analog to the Weibel instability, two stream instability in a\nbeam plasma system has already been investigated using energy principle\nanalysis [Lashmore-Davies 2007]. A detailed analytical description of\nconservation theorem for 2D Weibel instability in a beam plasma system has been\ncarried out in this manuscript.\n", "  Although stiction is a cumbersome problem for microsystems, it stimulates\ninvestigations of surface adhesion. In fact, the shape of an adhered cantilever\ncarries information of the adhesion energy that locks one end to the substrate.\nWe demonstrate here that the system is also sensitive to the dispersion forces\nthat are operative very close to the point of contact, but their contribution\nto the shape is maximum at about one third of the unadhered length. When the\nforce exceeds a critical value the cantilever does not lose stability but it\nsettles at smaller unadhered length, whose relation to adhesion energy is only\nslightly affected by the force. Our calculations suggest to use adhered\ncantilevers to measure the dispersion forces at short separations, where other\nmethods suffer from jump-to-contact instability. Simultaneous measurement of\nthe force and adhesion energy allows the separation of the dispersion\ncontribution to the surface adhesion.\n", "  The formation of Correlated Electron Pairs Oscillating around the Fermi level\nin Resonant Quantum States (CEPO-RQS), when a metal is cooled to its critical\ntemperature T=Tc, is studied. The necessary conditions for the existence of\nCEPO-RQS are analyzed. The participation of electron-electron interaction\nscreened by an electron dielectric constant of the form proposed by Thomas\nFermi is considered and a physical meaning for the electron-phonon-electron\ninteraction in the formation of the CEPO-RQS is given. The internal state of\nthe CEPO-RQS is characterized by taking into account the internal Hamiltonian,\nobtaining a general equation that represents its binding energy and depends\nonly on temperature and critical temperature. A parameter is also defined that\ncontains the properties that qualitatively characterizes the nature of a\nmaterial to form the CEPO-RQS.\n", "  We report on an experimental study of the vertical impact of a concave nosed\naxisymmetric body on a free surface. Previous studies have shown that bodies\nwith a convex nose, like a sphere, produce a well defined splash with a\nrelatively large cavity behind the model. In contrast, we find that with a\nconcave nose, there is hardly a splash and the cavity extent is greatly\nreduced. This may be explained by the fact that in the concave nosed case, the\ninitial impact is between a confined air pocket and the free surface unlike in\nthe convex nosed case. From measurements of the unsteady pressure in the\nconcave nose portion, we show that in this case, the maximum pressures are\nsignificantly lower than the classically expected \"water hammer\" pressures and\nalso lower than those generally measured on other geometries. Thus, the\npresence of an air pocket in the case of a concave nosed body adds an\ninteresting dimension to the classical problem of impact of solid bodies on to\na free surface.\n", "  In this article we present a brief introduction to the kinematical setup that\nunderlies the quantization used in loop quantum gravity. This review has been\npublished as a chapter in the monograph \"Loop Quantum Gravity: The First 30\nYears\", edited by Abhay Ashtekar and Jorge Pullin, that was recently published\nin the series \"100 Years of General Relativity\".\n", "  Second quantization has been widely used in quantum mechanics and quantum\nchemistry, which is trivial and error-prone for researchers. Fortunately it is\na good candidate for automatic evaluation with its simple, trivial and\nintrinsic iterative nature. This article presents an automatic and generic tool\nfor these kinds of evaluations. We believe it could be a helpful tool for\nscientists, and hope the idea of automatic evaluation could be generalized to\nother equation derivations in the future.\n", "  We investigated the properties of $80$ Be star disks, using the time\ndependent viscous decretion disk (VDD) model to interpret their mid-infrared\ncontinuum fluxes. Besides estimating the typical parameter ranges for such\ndisks, this approach allowed us to relate the disk structure to its\nevolutionary status. In this contribution, we present a brief summary of the\nrecently published results, and discuss some properties and time-scales of the\nVDD model solution.\n", "  In the last several years, there has been a wealth of studies to clarify the\nrole of thin layers of electrocatalysts on semiconducting photoelectrodes to\nthe efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It has been shown that\nthe addition of a thin oxide overlayer in many cases cathodically shifts the\npotential of photocurrent onset and/or increases the maximum photocurrent,\nleading to greater collection efficiencies beneficial for OER. However, the\norigin of this enhancement is not well understood. Here, we present a model\nrelying on analytical expressions rather than differential equations to\ninvestigate the role of surface states in electrocatalyst-modified\nsemiconductor photoelectrodes. Without catalyst overlayer, we find that if\nsurface states are screened, meaning charged surface states are electronically\nneutralized via nearby solution ions, no Helmholtz potential is generated and\nphotoelectrodes exhibit good performance. In contrast, if the surface states\nare unscreened, an additional Helmholtz potential forms decreasing the amount\nof band bending and resulting in poor performance. In the presence of a\ncatalyst overlayer, there is a strong dependence on how the surface states\ninteract with the catalyst. Catalysts in series with surface states can\nincrease the effective rate of transfer from surface states to solution,\nleading to an increase in total current while catalysts that act in parallel\nwith surface states can increase the open circuit voltage or photovoltage. Both\nseries and parallel catalyst effects operate in tandem in real devices, leading\nto an increase in current and/or photovoltage, depending on the relevant\nexchange currents. This model does not only help to understand the role of\nsurface states in charge transfer and ultimately efficiencies in\nphotoelectrochemical systems but also allows facile application for other\nresearchers.\n", "  We propose a novel periodicity-free unfolding method of the electronic energy\nspectra. Our new method solves a serious problem that calculated electronic\nband structure strongly depends on the choice of the simulation cell, i.e.,\nprimitive-cell or supercell. The present method projects the electronic states\nonto the free-electron states, giving rise to the {\\it plane-wave unfolded}\nspectra. Using the method, the energy spectra can be calculated as a completely\nindependent quantity from the choice of the simulation cell. We have examined\nthe unfolded energy spectra in detail for three models and clarified the\nvalidity of our method: One-dimensional interacting two chain model, monolayer\ngraphene, and twisted bilayer graphene. Furthermore, we have discussed that our\npresent method is directly related to the experimental ARPES (Angle-Resolved\nPhoto-Emission Spectroscopy) spectra.\n", "  We examine the effect of different sources of technical noise on inverse weak\nvalue-based precision phase measurements. We find that this type of measurement\nis similarly robust to technical noise as related experiments in the weak value\nregime. In particular, the measurements considered here are robust to additive\nGaussian white noise and angular jitter noise commonly encountered in optical\nexperiments. Additionally, we show the same techniques used for precision phase\nmeasurement can be used with the same technical advantages for optical\nfrequency measurements.\n", "  We study the magnetocapacitance (MC) effect and magnetoelectric (ME) coupling\nin spin-flop driven antiferromagnet Co4Ta2O9. The magnetocapacitance data at\nhigh magnetic fields are analyzed by phenomenological Ginzburg-landau theory of\nferroelectromagnets and it is found that change in dielectric constant is\nproportional to the square of magnetization. The saturation polarization and\nmagnetoelectric coupling are estimated to be 52microC/m2 and $\\gamma$ = 1.4\nx10-3 (emu/g)-2 respectively at 6 Tesla. Electric polarization is achieved\nbelow Neel temperature only when the sample is cooled in the presence of\nmagnetic field and it is established that the ground state is non-ferroelectric\nimplying that magnetic lattice does not lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking\nin Co4Ta2O9.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations are performed to study ground-state\nproperties of a mixed spin-1 and spin-1/2 Lieb-lattice Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet, in order to get further insight beyond the modified spin-wave\n(MSW) study reported in [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 86, 014002 (2017)]. It is confirmed\nthat the MSW results are in good agreement with the QMC results. In particular,\nthe scaling relation found in the MSW study, which argues that sublattice spin\nreductions are inversely proportional to the sublattice sizes, is observed in\nour QMC simulation. We present a rigorous proof for spontaneous sublattice\nmagnetizations induced by an infinitesimal uniform magnetic field. The\ncalculation process in the MSW theory is reexamined to clarify the mathematical\nstructure behind the scaling relation for sublattice long-range orders.\n", "  An angle-resolved x-ray spectroscopic scheme is presented for determining the\nhyperfine splitting of highly charged ions. For helium-like ions, in\nparticular, we propose to measure either the angular distribution or\npolarization of the $1s2p~^{3}P_{1}, F \\rightarrow 1s^{2}~^{1}S_{0}, F_{f}$\nemission following the stimulated decay of the initial $1s2s~^{1}S_{0}, F_{i}$\nlevel. It is found that both the angular and polarization characteristics of\nthe emitted x-ray photons strongly depends on the (relative) \\textit{splitting}\nof the partially overlapping hyperfine $1s2p~^{3}P_{1}, F$ resonances and may\nthus help resolve their hyperfine structure. The proposed scheme is feasible\nwith present-day photon detectors and allows a measurement of the hyperfine\nsplitting of helium-like ions with a relative accuracy of about $10^{-4}$.\n", "  The hybrid quantum network, a universal form of quantum network which is\naimed for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation, is that\nthe quantum nodes in it are realized with different physical systems. This\nuniversal form of quantum network can combine the advantages and avoid the\ninherent defects of the different physical system. However, one obstacle\nstanding in the way is the compatible photonic quantum interface. One possible\nsolution is using non-degenerate, narrow-band, entangled photon pairs as the\nphotonic interface. Here, for the first time, we generate nondegenrate\nnarrow-band polarization-entangled photon pairs in cavity-enhanced spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion process. The bandwidths and central wavelengths of\nthe signal and idler photons are 9 MHz at 935 nm and 9.5 MHz at 880 nm, which\nare compatible with trapped ion system and solid-state quantum memory system.\nThe entanglement of the photon source is certified by quantum state tomography,\nshowing a fidelity of 89.6% between the generated quantum state with a Bell\nstate. Besides, a strong violation against Bell inequality with 2.36+/-0.03\nfurther confirms the entanglement property of the photon pairs. Our method is\nsuitable for the hybrid quantum network and will take a big step in this field.\n", "  The search of binary sequences with low auto-correlations (LABS) is a\ndiscrete combinatorial optimization problem contained in the NP-hard\ncomputational complexity class. We study this problem using Warning Propagation\n(WP) , a message passing algorithm, and compare the performance of the\nalgorithm in the original problem and in two different disordered versions. We\nshow that in all the cases Warning Propagation converges to low energy minima\nof the solution space. Our results highlight the importance of the local\nstructure of the interaction graph of the variables for the convergence time of\nthe algorithm and for the quality of the solutions obtained by WP. While in\ngeneral the algorithm does not provide the optimal solutions in large systems\nit does provide, in polynomial time, solutions that are energetically similar\nto the optimal ones. Moreover, we designed hybrid models that interpolate\nbetween the standard LABS problem and the disordered versions of it, and\nexploit them to improved the convergence time of WP and the quality of the\nsolutions.\n", "  This paper is devoted to investigate the recently proposed modified\nGauss-Bonnet $f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity, with $\\mathcal{G}$, the Gauss-Bonnet\nterm, coupled with ${T}$, the trace of energy-momentum tensor. We have used the\nNoether symmetry methodology to discuss some cosmologically important\n$f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity models with anisotropic background. In particular,\nthe Noether symmetry equations for modified $f(\\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity are\nreported for locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type $I$ universe.\nExplicitly, two models have been proposed to explore the exact solutions and\nthe conserved quantities. It is concluded that the specific models of modified\nGauss-Bonnet gravity may be used to reconstruct $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology without\ninvolving any cosmological constant.\n", "  We discuss a model with stable topological solitons in Minkowski space with\nonly three degrees of freedom, the rotational angles of a spatial Dreibein.\nThis model has four types of solitons differing in two topological quantum\nnumbers which we identify with electric charge and spin. The vacuum has a\ntwo-dimensional degeneracy leading to two types of massless excitations,\ncharacterised by a topological quantum number which could have a physical\nequivalent in the photon number.\n", "  We investigate the relation between the parameters of the energy spectrum and\nthe frequency and amplitude of the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz\nQPOs) in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636$-$53. We fit the $3-180$-keV\nspectrum of this source with a model that includes a thermal Comptonisation\ncomponent. We show that the frequencies of both kHz QPOs follow the same\nrelation as a function of the parameters of this spectral component, except for\na systematic frequency shift, whereas the rms fractional amplitude of each QPO\nfollows a different relation with respect to those same parameters. This\nimplies that, while the dynamical mechanism that sets the frequencies of the\nQPO can be the same for both kHz QPOs, the radiative mechanisms that set the\namplitudes of the lower and the upper kHz QPO are likely different. We discuss\nthe implications of these results to the modelling of the kHz QPOs and the\npossibility that the lower kHz QPO reflects a resonance between the\nComptonising medium and the photons from the accretion disc and/or the neutron\nstar surface.\n", "  We report results of the dielectric and pyroelectric measurements on solid\nsolutions of Ga$_2$$_-$$_x$Fe$_x$O$_3$ with x = 0.75, 1.0 and 1.25. These\nsystems exhibit dipolar cluster glass behavior in addition to the spin glass\nbehavior making them belong to a class of few systems showing multiglass\nbehavior. Presence of two contributing relaxations in dielectric data are\nobserved possibly due to the flipping and breathing of polar nano-clusters.\nFurther, emergence of polarization in these systems can be understood in terms\nof thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) effect caused by defect\ndipoles possibly associated with charged oxygen vacancies rather than the\nintrinsic ferroelectric behavior.\n", "  Interferometric out-of-focus imaging of ice particles is realized. The\noverlapping defocused images of two nearby ice particles are analyzed. If one\nparticle is much smaller than the other one, the pattern constitutes an\noff-axis hologram whose analysis gives the exact size and shape of the biggest\nparticle. Using two angles of view, we obtain a 3D description of the biggest\nice particle.\n", "  Adopting the graph-theoretic approach to the correlation experiments, we\nanalyze the origin of monogamy and prove that it can be recognised as a\nconsequence of exclusivity principle(EP). We provide an operational criterion\nfor monogamy: if the fractional packing number of the graph corresponding to\nthe union of event sets of several physical experiments does not exceed the sum\nof independence numbers of each individual experiment graph, then these\nexperiments are monogamous. As applications of this observation, several\nexamples are provided, including the monogamy for experiments of\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) type, Klyachko-Can-Binicio\\u{g}lu-Shumovsky\n(KCBS) type, and for the first time we give some monogamy relations of\nSwetlichny's genuine nonlocality. We also give the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for several experiments to be monogamous: several experiments are\nmonogamous if and only if the Lov\\'asz number the union exclusive graph is less\nthan or equal to the sum of independence numbers of each exclusive graph.\n", "  We calculate the centrality dependence of inclusive cross section of large-pT\ncharmed-meson ($D^{0}$, $D^{*}$, $D^{*+}$, and $D_{s}^{+}$) from heavy quark\nfragmentation by the hard photoproduction processes for the nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The numerical results\nindicate that the modification of the hard photoproduction processes cannot be\nnegligible for the charmed-meson production in Au-Au collisions at Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Pb-Pb collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n", "  Direct imaging of exoplanets or circumstellar disk material requires extreme\ncontrast at the 10-6 to 10-12 levels at < 100 mas angular separation from the\nstar. Focal-plane mask (FPM) coronagraphic imaging has played a key role in\nthis field, taking advantage of progress in Adaptive Optics on ground-based 8+m\nclass telescopes. However, large telescope entrance pupils usually consist of\ncomplex, sometimes segmented, non-ideal apertures, which include a central\nobstruction for the secondary mirror and its support structure. In practice,\nthis negatively impacts wavefront quality and coronagraphic performance, in\nterms of achievable contrast and inner working angle. Recent theoretical works\non structured darkness have shown that solutions for FPM phase profiles,\noptimized for non-ideal apertures, can be numerically derived. Here we present\nand discuss a first experimental validation of this concept, using reflective\nliquid crystal spatial light modulators as adaptive FPM coronagraphs.\n", "  In the present work we explore resistive circuits where the individual\nresistors are arranged in fractal-like patterns. These circuits have some of\nthe characteristics typically found in geometric fractals, namely\nself-similarity and scale invariance. Considering resistive circuits as graphs,\nwe propose a definition of self-similar circuits which mimics a self-similar\nfractal. General properties of the resistive circuits generated by this\napproach are investigated, and interesting examples are commented in detail.\nSpecifically, we consider self-similar resistive series, tree-like resistive\nnetworks and Sierpinski's configurations with resistors.\n", "  We study the linear perturbations in a stable Jeans cloud, i.e; the dimension\nof the cloud is less than the Jeans length. We find that the linear\nperturbation of density in such a system obeys a wave equation in acoustic\nanalogue of Minkowski space-time which is similar to Klein-Gordon equation for\ntachyon field in Minkowski space-time, i.e; Klein-Gordon equation with negative\nmass-squared term in a flat space time background. We further find the analogy\nwith tachyon field for linear perturbation of density by studying linear\nperturbations in a stable cloud made of Bose-Einstein condensate as dark\nmatter.\n", "  In this paper, we investigated structures and charge density waves, including\nits origin of CDW, by using first-principles calculations. Firstly, we\nperformed structure searches of NbSe_2 under different pressures to explore the\npossible structures of the CDW phase in NbSe_2. The stability of the resulted\nstructure is proved by extensive studies of energy calculations and phonon\nspectra. Based on the detailed analysis on electronic properties (both in real\nspace and K space) and band structures during CDW transitions, we believe the\nstructure distortion and the displacement of atoms are the origin of CDW, which\nalso cause the change of the Fermi surfaces and electronic density of states\n(DOS). In the end, the results of band structure and DOS were used to explain\nthe reason why CDW and superconducting orders compete with each other at low\ntemperature.\n", "  Discrete element numerical simulations of unsteady, homogeneous shear flows\nhave been performed by instantly applying a constant shear rate to a random,\nstatic, isotropic assembly of identical, soft, frictional spheres at either\nzero or finite pressure by keeping constant the solid volume fraction until the\nsteady state is reached. If the system is slowly sheared, or, equivalently, if\nthe particles are sufficiently rigid, the granular material exhibits either\nlarge or small fluctuations in the evolving pressure, depending whether the\naverage number of contacts per particle (coordination number) is less or larger\nthan a critical value. The amplitude of the pressure fluctuations is\nrate-dependent when the coordination number is less than the critical and\nrate-independent otherwise, signatures of fluid-like and solid-like behaviour,\nrespectively. The same critical coordination number has been previously found\nto represent the minimum value at which rate-independent components of the\nstresses develop in steady, simple shearing and the jamming transition in\nisotropic random packings. The observed complex behaviour of the measured\npressure in the fluid-solid transition clearly suggests the need for\nincorporating in a nontrivial way the coordination number, the solid volume\nfraction, the particle stiffness and the intensity of the particle agitation in\nconstitutive models for the onset and the arrest of granular flows.\n", "  This article presents a synopsis of the activity in Jupiter's North\nEquatorial Belt (NEB) from 1986 to 2010, and of the speeds of dark formations\non its south edge and bright streaks ('rifts') in its interior. In particular I\ndiscuss NEB expansion events (NEEs), which took place every 3-5 years during\nthis time, and how the various features of the NEB are involved in them. I\npresent evidence that the NEE affects not just the northern edge, but the whole\nwidth of the belt. It begins with an outbreak of a bright rift that is more\nnortherly and slower-moving than usual; this is often involved with the first\nejection of dark material northwards into the N. Tropical Zone, but typically\nthe rift also expands southwards across the width of the NEB. NEBs dark\nformations are usually affected, as they are during individual interactions\nwith rifts at other times; they may be disrupted, or intensified, and they\nusually undergo deceleration. The expansion of the dark NEB to the north occurs\nconcurrently, and is followed by the appearance of new dark 'barges' and white\novals flanking the NEBn jet. The speed of the NEBs dark formations varies with\ntheir mean spacing, consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that they are\nplanetary Rossby waves. In most apparitions since 2000 we have also detected\nsmaller, faster features (120 m/s). I propose that these represent waves of the\nsame type, but with higher frequency, and that their speed is slightly less\nthan the true wind speed at cloud-top level under normal conditions.\n", "  Renewable energy conversion and storage, and greenhouse gas emission-free\ntechnologies are within the primary tasks and challenges for the society.\nHydrogen fuel, produced by alkaline water electrolysis is fulfilling all these\ndemands, however the technology is economically feeble, limited by the slow\nrate of oxygen evolution reaction. Complex metal oxides were suggested to\novercome this problem being low-cost efficient catalysts. However, the\ninsufficient long-term stability, degradation of structure and electrocatalytic\nactivity are restricting their utilization. Here we report on a new\nperovskite-based self-assembling material BaCo0.98Ti0.02O3-$\\delta$:Co3O4 with\nsuperior performance, showing outstanding properties compared to current\nstate-of-the-art materials without degeneration of its properties even at 353\nK. By chemical and structural analysis the degradation mechanism was identified\nand modified by selective doping. Short-range order and chemical composition\nrather than long-range order are factors determining the outstanding\nperformance. The derived general design rules can be used for further\ndevelopment of oxide-based electrocatalytic materials.\n", "  A Revival of the South Equatorial Belt (SEB) is an organised disturbance on a\ngrand scale. It starts with a single vigorous outbreak from which energetic\nstorms and disturbances spread around the planet in the different zonal\ncurrents. The Revival that began in 2010 was better observed than any before\nit. The observations largely validate the historical descriptions of these\nevents: the major features portrayed therein, albeit at lower resolution, are\nindeed the large structural features described here. Our major conclusions\nabout the 2010 SEB Revival are as follows, and we show that most of them may be\ntypical of SEB Revivals.\n  1) The Revival started with a bright white plume.\n  2) The initial plume erupted in a pre-existing cyclonic oval ('barge').\nSubsequent white plumes continued to appear on the track of this barge, which\nwas the location of the sub-surface source of the whole Revival.\n  3) These plumes were extremely bright in the methane absorption band, i.e.\nthrusting up to very high altitudes, especially when new.\n  4) Brilliant, methane-bright plumes also appeared along the leading edge of\nthe central branch. Altogether, 7 plumes appeared at the source and at least 6\nalong the leading edge.\n  5) The central branch of the outbreak was composed of large convective cells,\neach initiated by a bright plume, which only occupied a part of each cell,\nwhile a very dark streak defined its west edge.\n  6) The southern branch began with darkening and sudden acceleration of\npre-existing faint spots in a slowly retrograding wave-train.\n  7) Subsequent darker spots in the southern branch were complex structures,\nnot coherent vortices.\n  8) Dark spots in the southern branch had typical SEBs jetstream speeds but\nwere unusually far south....\n", "  A brief introduction to radar: principles, Doppler effect, antennas,\nwaveforms, power budget - and future radars. [13 pages]\n", "  A novel time-domain approach using the momentum operator is used to model\nspontaneous four-wave mixing in a lossless nonlinear waveguide. The effects of\nself- and cross-phase modulation on the photon-pair production rate and\nheralded photon purity are investigated. We show that in the special case where\nonly one half of the photon-pair state is filtered that the generation rate and\npurity of the heralded photons are unmodified by the presence of self- and\ncross-phase modulation. The significance of this special case arises when we\nconsider heralded single-photon sources, where future schemes are likely to\nonly filter the herald photon to ensure a high heralding efficiency is\nmaintained.\n", "  We study theoretically the two-center interferences occurring in high\nharmonic generation from diatomic molecules. By solving the time-dependent\nSchroedinger equation, either numerically or with the molecular strong-field\napproximation, we show that the electron dynamics results in a strong spectral\nsmoothing of the interference, depending on the value and sign of the driving\nlaser field at recombination. Strikingly, the associated phase-jumps are in\nopposite directions for the short and long trajectories. In these conditions,\nthe harmonic emission is not simply proportional to the recombination dipole\nany more. This has important consequences in high harmonic spectroscopy, e.g.,\nfor accessing the molecular-frame recombination dipole in amplitude and phase.\n", "  After it was proposed that life on Earth might descend from seeding by an\nearlier civilization, some authors noted that this alternative offers a\ntestable aspect: the seeds could be supplied with a signature that might be\nfound in extant organisms. In particular, it was suggested that the optimal\nlocation for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part\nof cells. However, as the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too\nspeculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because encoding/decoding a\nsignature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt is\ndoomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss\nthe motivation for inserting a signature. We then show that \"biological SETI\"\ninvolves even weaker assumptions than traditional SETI and admits a\nwell-defined methodological framework. After assessing the possibility in terms\nof molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting\nthe guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first\nprinciples and be convention-free, develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the\ncanonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision structure of interlocked\nsystematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,\nwe perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses.\nStatistical analysis reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the\ncode, interdependence analysis precludes overinterpretation, and comparison\nanalysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic structures,\nin agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the\ncanonical code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found\nattributes are consistent with the initial assumption, but that they make\nperfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some of the most\nuniversal codes of culture.\n", "  The discovery of strong gamma-ray and hard X-ray emission and the results\nfrom various multifrequency campaigns have disclosed new aspects of the blazar\nphenomenology, leading to a much more robust understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying their emission, and offering clues for the energetics of their\nrelativistic jets. I review these aspects, and propose that all the diversity\nin the blazar phenomenology depends on only one parameter. I also suggest that\nsome of the blazar characteristics can be explained by the internal shock\nscenario, as proposed to explain the emission from gamma-ray bursts.\n", "  Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies have recently received a lot of\nattention due to their unusual optical--X-ray properties which are not yet well\nunderstood. Photoionization models of the circum-nuclear emission/absorption\nregions allow to investigate scenarios to explain the main characteristics of\nNLSy1s, i.e., (i) extremely steep X-ray spectra within the ROSAT energy range,\n(ii) narrow Balmer lines and (iii) weak forbidden lines except for some\nrelatively strong high-ionization iron lines. Here, we focus on (iii). In\nparticular, we study the influence of different EUV - soft-X-ray spectral\nshapes (a giant soft excess, a steep X-ray powerlaw, presence of a warm\nabsorber) and NLR cloud properties on the predicted optical emission-line\nratios. The calculations were carried out with Ferland's code Cloudy.\n", "  The contact Darwin term is demonstrated to be of the same origin as the\nspin-orbit interaction. The $(Z\\alpha)^4 m^3/M^2$ correction to the Lamb shift,\ngenerated by the Darwin term, is found for an arbitrary nonvanishing spin of\nthe nucleus, both half-integer and integer.
