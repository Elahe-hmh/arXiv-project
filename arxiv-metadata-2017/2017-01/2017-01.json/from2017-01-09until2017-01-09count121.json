We have used the\ncolor and rotation method to investigate the properties of the invariant tori\nin the 4D spaces of section. We compare our results with those of previous\nworks and we describe the morphology of the rotational, as well as of the tube\ntori in the 4D space. We find sticky chaotic orbits in the immediate\nneighborhood of sets of invariant tori surrounding 3D stable periodic orbits.\nParticularly useful for galactic dynamics is the behavior of chaotic orbits\ntrapped for long time between 4D invariant tori. We find that they support\nduring this time the same structure as the quasi-periodic orbits around the\nstable periodic orbits, contributing however to a local increase of the\ndispersion of velocities. Finally we find that the tube tori do not appear in\nthe 3D projections of the spaces of section in the axisymmetric Hamiltonian we\nexamined.\n", "  We study the orbital behavior at the neighborhood of complex unstable\nperiodic orbits in a 3D autonomous Hamiltonian system of galactic type. At a\ntransition of a family of periodic orbits from stability to complex instability\n(also known as Hamiltonian Hopf Bifurcation) the four eigenvalues of the stable\nperiodic orbits move out of the unit circle. Then the periodic orbits become\ncomplex unstable. In this paper we first integrate initial conditions close to\nthe ones of a complex unstable periodic orbit, which is close to the transition\npoint. Then, we plot the consequents of the corresponding orbit in a 4D surface\nof section. To visualize this surface of section we use the method of color and\nrotation [Patsis and Zachilas 1994]. We find that the consequents are contained\nin 2D \"confined tori\". Then, we investigate the structure of the phase space in\nthe neighborhood of complex unstable periodic orbits, which are further away\nfrom the transition point. In these cases we observe clouds of points in the 4D\nsurfaces of section. The transition between the two types of orbital behavior\nis abrupt.\n", "  This paper discusses phase space structures encountered in the neighborhood\nof periodic orbits with high order multiplicity in a 3D autonomous Hamiltonian\nsystem with a potential of galactic type. We consider 4D spaces of section and\nwe use the method of color and rotation [Patsis and Zachilas 1994] in order to\nvisualize them. As examples we use the case of two orbits, one 2-periodic and\none 7-periodic. We investigate the structure of multiple tori around them in\nthe 4D surface of section and in addition we study the orbital behavior in the\nneighborhood of the corresponding simple unstable periodic orbits. By\nconsidering initially a few consequents in the neighborhood of the orbits in\nboth cases we find a structure in the space of section, which is in direct\ncorrespondence with what is observed in a resonance zone of a 2D autonomous\nHamiltonian system. However, in our 3D case we have instead of stability\nislands rotational tori, while the chaotic zone connecting the points of the\nunstable periodic orbit is replaced by filaments extending in 4D following a\nsmooth color variation. For more intersections, the consequents of the orbit\nwhich started in the neighborhood of the unstable periodic orbit, diffuse in\nphase space and form a cloud that occupies a large volume surrounding the\nregion containing the rotational tori. In this cloud the colors of the points\nare mixed. The same structures have been observed in the neighborhood of all\nm-periodic orbits we have examined in the system. This indicates a generic\nbehavior.\n", "  We study the dynamics in the neighborhood of simple and double unstable\nperiodic orbits in a rotating 3D autonomous Hamiltonian system of galactic\ntype. In order to visualize the four dimensional spaces of section we use the\nmethod of color and rotation. We investigate the structure of the invariant\nmanifolds that we found in the neighborhood of simple and double unstable\nperiodic orbits in the 4D spaces of section. We consider orbits in the\nneighborhood of the families x1v2, belonging to the x1 tree, and the z-axis\n(the rotational axis of our system). Close to the transition points from\nstability to simple instability, in the neighborhood of the bifurcated simple\nunstable x1v2 periodic orbits we encounter the phenomenon of stickiness as the\nasymptotic curves of the unstable manifold surround regions of the phase space\noccupied by rotational tori existing in the region. For larger energies, away\nfrom the bifurcating point, the consequents of the chaotic orbits form clouds\nof points with mixing of color in their 4D representations. In the case of\ndouble instability, close to x1v2 orbits, we find clouds of points in the four\ndimensional spaces of section. However, in some cases of double unstable\nperiodic orbits belonging to the z-axis family we can visualize the associated\nunstable eigensurface. Chaotic orbits close to the periodic orbit remain sticky\nto this surface for long times (of the order of a Hubble time or more). Among\nthe orbits we studied we found those close to the double unstable orbits of the\nx1v2 family having the largest diffusion speed.\n", "  We have assembled CO2 emission figures from collections of urban GHG emission\nestimates published in peer reviewed journals or reports from research\ninstitutes and non-governmental organizations. Analyzing the scaling with\npopulation size we find that the exponent is development dependent with a\ntransition from super- to sub-linear scaling. From the climate change\nmitigation point of view, the results suggest that urbanization is desirable in\ndeveloped countries and should be avoided in developing ones. Further, we\ncompare this analysis with a second scaling relation, namely the fundamental\nallometry between city population and area, and propose that density might be\nthe decisive quantity. Last, we derive the theoretical country-wide urban\nemissions by integration and obtain a dependence on the size of the largest\ncity.\n", "  Understanding the rich behavior that emerges from systems of interacting\nquantum particles, such as electrons in materials, nucleons in nuclei or\nneutron stars, the quark-gluon plasma, and superfluid liquid helium, requires\ninvestigation of systems that are clean, accessible, and have tunable\nparameters. Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this\napplication largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.\nSpecifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the\ninteraction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for\nexperimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood\nbecause interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important,\nmean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps\ndoes not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where $a$ is\ninfinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they\ndepend only on the particle density and quantum statistics. While the unitary\nFermi gas has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical\ninvestigation, the degenerate unitary Bose gas has generally been deemed\nexperimentally inaccessible because of three-body loss rates that increase\ndramatically with increasing $a$. Here, we investigate dynamics of a unitary\nBose gas for timescales that are short compared to the loss. We find that the\nmomentum distribution of the unitary Bose gas evolves on timescales fast\ncompared to losses, and that both the timescale for this evolution and the\nlimiting shape of the momentum distribution are consistent with universal\nscaling with density. This work demonstrates that a unitary Bose gas can be\ncreated and probed dynamically, and thus opens the door for further exploration\nof this novel strongly interacting quantum liquid.\n", "  This research aims to develop a new approach toward a consistent coupling of\nelectromagnetic and gravitational fields by using an electron that couples with\na weak gravitational potential by means of its electromagnetic field. We find\nthe value of the tiny coupling constant of gravity with electromagnetic fields,\nwhich depends on the speed of light and a universal minimum speed that\nrepresents the lowest limit of speed for any particle. Such a minimum speed,\nunattainable by particles, represents a preferred reference frame associated\nwith a background field that breaks the Lorentz symmetry. The metric of the\nflat spacetime shall include the presence of a uniform vacuum energy density,\nwhich leads to a negative pressure at cosmological scales, i.e., the\ncosmological anti-gravity. The tiny values of the cosmological constant and the\nvacuum energy density will be successfully obtained in agreement with the\nobservational data.\n", "  We investigate steam condensation induced water hammer (CIWH) phenomena and\npresent new theoretical results. We use the WAHA3 model based on two-phase flow\nsix first-order partial differential equations that present one dimensional,\nsurface averaged mass, momentum and energy balances. A second order accurate\nhigh-resolution shock-capturing numerical scheme was applied with different\nkind of limiters in the numerical calculations. The applied two-fluid model\nshows some similarities to Relap5 which is widely used in the nuclear industry\nto simulate nuclear power plant accidents. This model was validated with\ndifferent CIWH experiments which were performed in the PMK-2 facility, which is\na full-pressure thermo-hydraulic model of the nuclear power plant of\nVVER-440/312 type in the Energy Research Center of the Hungarian Academy of\nSciences in Budapest and in the Rosa facility in Japan. In our recent study we\nshow the first part of a planned large database which will give us the upper\nand lower flooding mass flow rates for various pipe geometries where CIWH can\nhappen. Such a reliable database would be a great help for future reactor\nconstructions and scheming.\n", "  Nearly all astrophysical and cosmological data point convincingly to a large\ncomponent of cold dark matter in the Universe. The axion particle, first\ntheorized as a solution to the strong charge-parity problem of quantum\nchromodynamics, has been established as a prominent CDM candidate. Cosmic\nobservation and particle physics experiments have bracketed the unknown mass of\nthe axion between approximately a $\\mu$eV and a meV. The Axion Dark Matter\neXperiement (ADMX) has successfully completed searches between 1.9 and 3.7\n$\\mu$eV down to the KSVZ photon-coupling limit. ADMX and the Axion Dark Matter\neXperiement High-Frequency (ADMX-HF) will search for axions at weaker coupling\nand/or higher frequencies within the next few years. Status of the experiments,\ncurrent research and development, and projected mass-coupling exclusion limits\nare presented.\n", "  Human development has far-reaching impacts on the surface of the globe. The\ntransformation of natural land cover occurs in different forms and urban growth\nis one of the most eminent transformative processes. We analyze global land\ncover data and extract cities as defined by maximally connected urban clusters.\nThe analysis of the city size distribution for all cities on the globe confirms\nZipf's law. Moreover, by investigating the percolation properties of the\nclustering of urban areas we assess the closeness to criticality for various\ncountries. At the critical thresholds, the urban land cover of the countries\nundergoes a transition from separated clusters to a gigantic component on the\ncountry scale. We study the Zipf-exponents as a function of the closeness to\npercolation and find a systematic decrease with increasing scale, which could\nbe the reason for deviating exponents reported in literature. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the average size of the clusters as a function of the proximity to\npercolation and find country specific behavior. By relating the standard\ndeviation and the average of cluster sizes -- analogous to Taylor's law -- we\nsuggest an alternative way to identify the percolation transition. We calculate\nspatial correlations of the urban land cover and find long-range correlations.\nFinally, by relating the areas of cities with population figures we address the\nglobal aspect of the allometry of cities, finding an exponent $\\delta\\approx\n0.85$, i.e. large cities have lower densities.\n", "  We present analytic angular differential cross section model for laser\nassisted proton nucleon scattering on a Woods-Saxon optical potential where the\nnth-order photon absorption is taken into account simultaneously. As a physical\nexample we calculate cross sections for proton - $^{12}$C collision at 49 MeV\nin the laboratory frame where the laser intensity is in the range of $ 10^{7} -\n10^{21}$ W/cm$^2$ at optical frequencies. The upper intensity limit is slightly\nbelow the relativistic regime.\n", "  We study transport properties of hexagonal zigzag graphene quantum rings\nconnected to semi-infinite nanoribbons. Open two-fold symmetric structures\nsupport localized states that can be traced back to those existing in the\nisolated six-fold symmetric rings. Using a tight-binding Hamiltonian within the\nGreen's function formalism, we show that an external magnetic field promotes\nthese localized states to Fano resonances with robust signatures in transport.\nLocal density of states and current distributions of the resonant states are\ncalculated as a function of the magnetic flux intensity. For structures on\ncorrugated substrates we analyze the effect of strain by including an\nout-of-plane centro-symmetric deformation in the model. We show that small\nstrains shift the resonance positions without further modifications, while high\nstrains introduce new ones.\n", "  We investigate the two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes(NS) and the\ncontinuity equations in Cartesian coordinates and Eulerian description for\nnon-Newtonian fluids. As a non-Newtonian viscosity we consider the Ladyzenskaya\nmodel with a non-linear velocity dependent stress tensor. The key idea is the\nmulti-dimensional generalization of the well-known self-similar Ansatz, which\nwas already used for non-compressible and compressible viscous flow studies.\nThe geometrical interpretations of the trial function is also discussed. We\ncompare our recent results to the former Newtonian ones.\n", "  Caldeira-Leggett model of reservoir is generalized to a reservoir modeled by\na continuum of real Klein-Gordon fields, instead of harmonic oscillators. A\nquantum Langevin type dissipative equation is obtained for the scalar field.\nThe susceptibility of the medium is defined in terms of the reservoir Green's\nfunction and the coupling function satisfying causality condition. The\nconnection between the coupling function and the susceptibility of the medium\nis found to be a Hankel transform from which the coupling function can be\ndetermined in terms of the susceptibility of the medium. Noise currents and\ntheir fluctuation-dissipation relation are obtained. In a homogeneous medium or\nreservoir, explicit form of the quantum scalar field, and its large-time limit,\nare found.\n", "  In this article we will present pure two-dimensional analytic solutions for\nthe coupled non-compressible Newtoniain Navier-Stokes\n  --- with Boussinesq approximation --- and the heat conduction equation. The\nsystem was investigated from E.N. Lorenz half a century ago with Fourier series\nand pioneered the way to the paradigm of chaos. We present a novel analysis of\nthe same system where the key idea is the two-dimensional generalization of the\nwell-known self-similar Ansatz of Barenblatt which will be interpreted in a\ngeometrical way. The results, the pressure, temperature and velocity fields are\nall analytic and can be expressed with the help of the error functions. The\ntemperature field has a strongly damped oscillating behavior which is an\ninteresting feature.\n", "  For some blazars, the gamma-ray absorption features due to pair-production on\nthe Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) are fainter than expected. The present\nwork reviews the main models that could explain this paradox, with emphasis on\nconservative ones, that do not include any new physics. The models that are\nintrinsic to the source, do allow a very hard primary spectrum, but fail to\nexplain a regular redshift dependence of the anomaly starting energy. The model\nthat includes a contribution from secondary photons produced by cosmic rays\n(CR) near the Earth seems to require a well collimated CR beam, what is hard to\nachieve. Finally, the model with secondary photons produced in electromagnetic\n(EM) cascades initiated by primary gamma-rays is considered. In principle, it\nallows to decrease the statistical significance of the anomaly and, while\nrequiring quite low EGMF strength B, does not contradict to most contemporary\nconstraints on the B value. Additionally, it is shown that the recently\nobserved correlation between directions to hard gamma-ray sources and voids in\nthe Large Scale Structure is a natural feature of the EM cascade model.\n", "  The origin of life can be understood mathematically to be the origin of\ninformation that can replicate. The likelihood that entropy spontaneously\nbecomes information can be calculated from first principles, and depends\nexponentially on the amount of information that is necessary for replication.\nWe do not know what the minimum amount of information for self-replication is\nbecause it must depend on the local chemistry, but we can study how this\nlikelihood behaves in different known chemistries, and we can study ways in\nwhich this likelihood can be enhanced. Here we present evidence from numerical\nsimulations (using the digital life chemistry \"Avida\") that using a biased\nprobability distribution for the creation of monomers (the \"biased typewriter\")\ncan exponentially increase the likelihood of spontaneous emergence of\ninformation from entropy. We show that this likelihood may depend on the length\nof the sequence that the information is embedded in, but in a non-trivial\nmanner: there may be an optimum sequence length that maximizes the likelihood.\nWe conclude that the likelihood of spontaneous emergence of self-replication is\nmuch more malleable than previously thought, and that the biased probability\ndistributions of monomers that are the norm in biochemistry may significantly\nenhance these likelihoods\n", "  For the classical mind, quantum mechanics is boggling enough; nevertheless\nmore bizarre behavior could be imagined, thereby concentrating on propositional\nstructures (empirical logics) that transcend the quantum domain. One can also\nconsistently suppose predictions and probabilities which are neither classical\nnor quantum, but which are subject to subclassicality; that is, the additivity\nof probabilities for mutually exclusive, co-measurable observables, as\nformalized by admissibility rules and frame functions.\n", "  We report a spin-orbit coupling induced back-action cooling in an\noptomechanical system, composed of a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein\ncondensate trapped in an optical cavity with one movable end mirror, by\nsuppressing heating effects of quantum noises. The collective density\nexcitations of the spin-orbit coupling mediated hyperfine states - serving as\natomic oscillators equally coupled to the cavity field - trigger strongly\ndriven atomic back-action. We find that the back-action not only revamps\nlow-temperature dynamics of its own but also provides an opportunity to cool\nthe mechanical mirror to its quantum mechanical ground state. Further, we\ndemonstrate that the strength of spin-orbit coupling also superintends dynamic\nstructure factor and squeezes nonlinear quantum noises, like thermo-mechanical\nand photon shot noise, which enhances optomechanical features of hybrid cavity\nbeyond the previous investigations. Our findings are testable in a realistic\nsetup and enhance the functionality of cavity-optomechanics with spin-orbit\ncoupled hyperfine states in the field of quantum optics and quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  We examine the (2+1)-dimensional Dirac equation in a homogeneous magnetic\nfield under the non-relativistic anti-Snyder model which is relevant to\ndeformed special relativity (DSR) since it exhibits an intrinsic upper bound of\nthe momentum of free particles. After setting up the formalism, exact eigen\nsolutions are derived in momentum space representation and they are expressed\nin terms of finite orthogonal Romanovski polynomials. There is a finite maximum\nnumber of allowable bound states due to the orthogonality of the polynomials\nand the maximum energy is truncated at the maximum n. Similar to the minimal\nlength case, the degeneracy of the Dirac-Landau levels in anti- Snyder model\nare modified and there are states that do not exist in the ordinary quantum\nmechanics limit. By taking zero mass limit, we explore the motion of effective\nzero mass charged Fermions in Graphene like material and obtained a maximum\nbound of deformed parameter. Furthermore, we consider the modified energy\ndispersion relations and its application in describing the behavior of\nneutrinos oscillation under modified commutation relations.\n", "  We compare the set of local galaxies having dynamically measured black holes\nwith a large, unbiased sample of galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. We confirm earlier work showing that the majority of black hole hosts\nhave significantly higher velocity dispersions sigma than local galaxies of\nsimilar stellar mass. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to illustrate the effect\non black hole scaling relations if this bias arises from the requirement that\nthe black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole\nmasses with spatially resolved kinematics. We find that this selection effect\nartificially increases the normalization of the Mbh-sigma relation by a factor\nof at least ~3; the bias for the Mbh-Mstar relation is even larger. Our Monte\nCarlo simulations and analysis of the residuals from scaling relations both\nindicate that sigma is more fundamental than Mstar or effective radius. In\nparticular, the Mbh-Mstar relation is mostly a consequence of the Mbh-sigma and\nsigma-Mstar relations, and is heavily biased by up to a factor of 50 at small\nmasses. This helps resolve the discrepancy between dynamically-based black\nhole-galaxy scaling relations versus those of active galaxies. Our simulations\nalso disfavour broad distributions of black hole masses at fixed sigma.\nCorrecting for this bias suggests that the calibration factor used to estimate\nblack hole masses in active galaxies should be reduced to values of fvir~1.\nBlack hole mass densities should also be proportionally smaller, perhaps\nimplying significantly higher radiative efficiencies/black hole spins. Reducing\nblack hole masses also reduces the gravitational wave signal expected from\nblack hole mergers.\n", "  Recently, black phosphorus (BP) has joined the two dimensional material\nfamily as a promising candidate for photonic applications, due to its moderate\nbandgap, high carrier mobility, and compatibility with a diverse range of\nsubstrates. Photodetectors are probably the most explored BP photonic devices,\nhowever, their unique potential compared with other layered materials in the\nmid-infrared wavelength range has not been revealed. Here, we demonstrate BP\nmid infrared detectors at 3.39 um with high internal gain, resulting in an\nexternal responsivity of 82 A/W. Noise measurements show that such BP\nphotodetectors are capable of sensing low intensity mid-infrared light in the\npicowatt range. Moreover, the high photoresponse remains effective at kilohertz\nmodulation frequencies, because of the fast carrier dynamics arising from BPs\nmoderate bandgap. The high photoresponse at mid infrared wavelengths and the\nlarge dynamic bandwidth, together with its unique polarization dependent\nresponse induced by low crystalline symmetry, can be coalesced to promise\nphotonic applications such as chip-scale mid-infrared sensing and imaging at\nlow light levels.\n", "  We report on the experimental realization of a photonic system that simulates\nthe one-dimensional two-particle Hubbard model. This analogy is realized by\nmeans of two-dimensional arrays of coupled optical waveguides, fabricated using\nfemtosecond laser inscription. By tuning the analogous \"interaction strength\",\nwe reach the strongly-interacting regime of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, and\ndemonstrate the suppression of standard tunneling for individual \"particles\".\nIn this regime, the formation of bound states is identified through the direct\nobservation of pair tunneling. We then demonstrate the coherent destruction of\ntunneling (CDT) for the paired particles in the presence of an engineered\noscillating force of high frequency. The precise control over the analogous\n\"interaction strength\" and driving force offered by our experimental system\nopens an exciting route towards quantum simulation of few-body physics in\nphotonics.\n", "  We measured metallicities for 33 z=3.4-4.2 absorption line systems drawn from\na sample of H I-selected-Lyman limit systems (LLSs) identified in Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) quasar spectra and stratified based on metal line features.\nWe obtained higher-resolution spectra with the Keck Echellette Spectrograph and\nImager, selecting targets according to our stratification scheme in an effort\nto fully sample the LLS population metallicity distribution. We established a\nplausible range of H I column densities and measured column densities (or\nlimits) for ions of carbon, silicon, and aluminum, finding ionization-corrected\nmetallicities or upper limits. Interestingly, our ionization models were better\nconstrained with enhanced $\\alpha$-to-aluminum abundances, with a median\nabundance ratio of [$\\alpha$/Al]=0.3. Measured metallicities were generally\nlow, ranging from [M/H]=-3 to -1.68, with even lower metallicities likely for\nsome systems with upper limits. Using survival statistics to incorporate\nlimits, we constructed the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for LLS\nmetallicities. Recent models of galaxy evolution propose that galaxies\nreplenish their gas from the low-metallicity intergalactic medium (IGM) via\nhigh-density H I \"flows\" and eject enriched interstellar gas via outflows.\nThus, there has been some expectation that LLSs at the peak of cosmic star\nformation ($z\\approx3$) might have a bimodal metallicity distribution. We\nmodeled our CDF as a mix of two Gaussian distributions, one reflecting the\nmetallicity of the IGM and the other representative of the interstellar medium\nof star-forming galaxies. This bimodal distribution yielded a poor fit. A\nsingle Gaussian distribution better represented the sample with a low mean\nmetallicity of [M/H] $\\approx -2.5$.\n", "  The weak coupling asymptotics to order $\\gamma$ of the ground state energy of\nthe delta-function Fermi gas, derived heuristically in the literature, is here\nmade rigorous. Further asymptotics are in principle computable. The analysis\napplies to the Gaudin integral equation a method previously used by one of the\nauthors for the asymptotics of large Toeplitz matrices.\n", "  The discovery of the quantised Hall effect, and its subsequent topological\nexplanation, demonstrated the important role topology can play in determining\nthe properties of quantum systems. This realisation led to the development of\ntopological band theory, where, in addition to band index and quasimomentum,\nBloch bands are also characterised by a set of topological invariants. This\ntopological theory can be readily extended to periodically-driven systems. In\nthe limit of fast driving, the topology of the system can still be captured by\nthe topological invariants used to describe static systems. In the limit of\nslow driving, however, situations can arise where standard topological\ninvariants are zero, but yet, topologically protected edge modes are still\nobserved. These \"anomalous\" topological edge modes have no static analogue, and\nare associated with a distinct topological invariant, which takes into account\nthe full time-evolution over a driving period. Here we demonstrate the first\nexperimental observation of such anomalous topological edge modes in an\nultrafast-laser-inscribed photonic lattice. This inscription technique allows\none to address each bond of a lattice independently and dynamically, generating\na rich band structure with robust anomalous chiral edge modes and the potential\nfor perfectly localised bulk states.\n", "  We predict by first principles calculations that the recently prepared\nborophene is a pristine two-dimensional (2D) monolayer superconductor, in which\nthe superconductivity can be significantly enhanced by strain and charge\ncarrier doping. The intrinsic metallic ground state with high density of states\nat Fermi energy and strong Fermi surface nesting lead to sizeable\nelectron-phonon coupling, making the freestanding borophene superconduct with\n$T_c$ close to 19.0 K. The tensile strain can increase $T_c$ to 27.4 K, while\nthe hole doping can notably increase $T_c$ to 34.8 K. The results indicate that\nthe borophene grown on substrates with large lattice parameters or under\nphotoexcitation can show enhanced superconductivity with $T_c$ far more above\nliquid hydrogen temperature of 20.3 K, which will largely broaden the\napplications of such novel material.\n", "  We investigate the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the triangular\nlattice as a function of spatial anisotropy with respect to both tunneling and\nnearest-neighbor interaction strength. At half-filling the system can be tuned\nfrom decoupled one-dimensional chains to a two-dimensional solid phase with\nalternating density order by adjusting the anisotropic coupling. At\nintermediate anisotropy, however, frustration effects dominate and an\nincommensurate supersolid phase emerges, which is characterized by\nincommensurate density order as well as an anisotropic superfluid density. We\ndemonstrate that this intermediate phase results from the proliferation of\ntopological defects in the form of quantum bosonic domain walls. Accordingly,\nthe structure factor has peaks at wave vectors, which are linearly related to\nthe number of domain walls in a finite system in agreement with extensive\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss possible connections with the\nsupersolid behavior in the high-temperature superconducting striped phase.\n", "  A detailed Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of an Abelian topological gravity is\nperformed; we show that this formalism is equivalent and more economical than\nDirac's method. In particular, we identify the complete set of constraints of\nthe theory, from which the number of physical degrees of freedom is explicitly\ncomputed. We prove that the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets and the Dirac\nones coincide to each other. Moreover, we perform the Faddeev-Jackiw analysis\nof the theory at the chiral point, and the full set of constraints and the\ngeneralized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets are constructed. Finally we compare our\nresults with those found in the literature and we discuss some remarks and\nprospects.\n", "  Quantum image processing (QIP) means the quantum based methods to speed up\nimage processing algorithms. Many quantum image processing schemes claim that\ntheir efficiency are theoretically higher than their corresponding classical\nschemes. However, most of them do not consider the problem of measurement. As\nwe all know, measurement will lead to collapse. That is to say, executing the\nalgorithm once, users can only measure the final state one time. Therefore, if\nusers want to regain the results (the processed images), they must execute the\nalgorithms many times and then measure the final state many times to get all\nthe pixels' values. If the measurement process is taken into account, whether\nor not the algorithms are really efficient needs to be reconsidered. In this\npaper, we try to solve the problem of measurement and give a quantum image\nmatching algorithm. Unlike most of the QIP algorithms, our scheme interests\nonly one pixel (the target pixel) instead of the whole image. It modifies the\nprobability of pixels based on Grover's algorithm to make the target pixel to\nbe measured with higher probability, and the measurement step is executed only\nonce. An example is given to explain the algorithm more vividly. Complexity\nanalysis indicates that the quantum scheme's complexity is $O(2^{n})$ in\ncontradistinction to the classical scheme's complexity $O(2^{2n+2m})$, where\n$m$ and $n$ are integers related to the size of images.\n", "  We discuss several examples of generating apparent singular points as a\nresult of differentiating particular homogeneous linear ordinary differential\nequations with polynomial coefficients and formulate two general conjectures on\nthe generation and removal of apparent singularities in arbitrary Fuchsian\ndifferential equations with polynomial coefficients. We consider a model\nproblem in polymer physics.\n", "  In the framework of a multiorbital Hubbard model description of\nsuperconductivity, a matrix formulation of the superconducting pairing\ninteraction that has been widely used is designed to treat spin, charge and\norbital fluctuations within a random phase approximation (RPA). In terms of\nFeynman diagrams, this takes into account particle-hole ladder and bubble\ncontributions as expected. It turns out, however, that this matrix formulation\nalso generates additional terms which have the diagrammatic structure of vertex\ncorrections. Here we examine these terms and discuss the relationship between\nthe matrix-RPA superconducting pairing interaction and the Feynman diagrams\nthat it sums.\n", "  Because of relativistic off-center motion of the charged spectators and the\nlocal momentum-imbalance experienced by the participants, a huge magnetic field\nis likely generated in high-energy collisions. The influence of such\nshort-lived magnetic field on the QCD phase-transition(s) shall be analysed.\nFrom Polyakov linear-sigma model, we study the chiral phase-transition and the\nmagnetic response and susceptibility in dependence on temperature, density and\nmagnetic field strength. The systematic measurements of the phase-transition\ncharacterizing signals, such as the fluctuations, the dynamical correlations\nand the in-medium modifications of rho-meson, for instance, in different\ninteracting systems and collision centralities are conjectured to reveal an\nalmost complete description for the QCD phase-structure and the chemical\nfreezeout. We limit the discussion to NICA energies.\n", "  We investigate the two-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetric\nYang-Mills (SYM) theory on the discretized curved space (polyhedra). We first\nrevisit that the number of supersymmetries of the continuum $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$\nSYM theory on any curved manifold can be enhanced at least to two by\nintroducing an appropriate $U(1)$ gauge background associated with the\n$U(1)_{V}$ symmetry. We then show that the generalized Sugino model on the\ndiscretized curved space, which was proposed in our previous work, can be\nidentified to the discretization of this SUSY enhanced theory, where one of the\nsupersymmetries remains and the other is broken but restored in the continuum\nlimit. We find that the $U(1)_{A}$ anomaly exists also in the discretized\ntheory as a result of an unbalance of the number of the fermions proportional\nto the Euler characteristics of the polyhedra. We then study this model by\nusing the numerical Monte-Carlo simulation. We propose a novel phase-quench\nmethod called \"anomaly-phase-quenched approximation\" with respect to the\n$U(1)_A$ anomaly. We numerically show that the Ward-Takahashi (WT) identity\nassociated with the remaining supersymmetry is realized by adopting this\napproximation. We figure out the relation between the sign (phase) problem and\npseudo-zero-modes of the Dirac operator. We also show that the divergent\nbehavior of the scalar one-point function gets milder as the genus of the\nbackground increases. These are the first numerical observations for the\nsupersymmetric lattice model on the curved space with generic topologies.\n", "  The angular wave functions for a hydrogen atom are well known to be spherical\nharmonics, and are obtained as the solutions of a partial differential\nequation. However, the differential operator is given by the Casimir operator\nof the $SU(2)$ algebra and its eigenvalue $l(l+1) \\hbar^2$, where $l$ is\nnon-negative integer, is easily obtained by an algebraic method. Therefore the\nshape of the wave function may also be obtained by extending the algebraic\nmethod. In this paper, we describe the method and show that wave functions with\ndifferent quantum numbers are connected by a rotational group in the cases of\n$l=0$, 1 and 2.\n", "  We study the ground state and the thermal phase diagram of a two-species\nBose-Hubbard model, with $U(1)\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, describing atoms\nand molecules on a 2D optical lattice interacting via a Feshbach resonance.\nUsing quantum Monte Carlo simulations and mean field theory, we show that the\nconversion between the two-species, coherently coupling the atomic and\nmolecular states, has a crucial impact on the Mott-Superfluid transition and\nstabilizes an insulating phase with a gap controlled by the conversion term --\n\\textit{the Feshbach insulator} -- instead of a standard Mott insulating phase.\nDepending on the detuning between atoms and molecules, this model exhibits\nthree phases: the Feshbach insulator, a molecular condensate coexisting with\nnon condensed atoms and a mixed atomic-molecular condensate. Employing a\nfinite-size scaling method, we observe 3D XY (3D Ising) transition when $U(1)$\n($ \\mathbb{Z}_2$) is broken whereas the transition is first-order when both\n$U(1)$ and $ \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries are spontaneously broken. The finite\ntemperature phase diagram is also discussed. The thermal disappearance of the\nmolecular superfluid leads to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition with\nunusual universal jump in the superfluid density. The loss of the\nquasi-long-range coherence of the mixed atomic and molecular superfluid is more\nsubtle since only atoms exhibit conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ncriticality. We also observe a classical first-order transition between the\nmixed superfluid and the normal Bose liquid at low temperature.\n", "  Non-centrosymmetric superconductors exhibit the magnetoelectric effect which\nmanifests itself in the appearance of the magnetic spin polarization in\nresponse to a dissipationless electric current (supercurrent). While much\nattention has been dedicated to the thermodynamic version of this phenomenon\n(Edelstein effect), non-equilibrium transport magnetoelectric effects have not\nbeen explored yet. We propose the magnetoelectric Andreev effect (MAE) which\nconsists in the generation of spin-polarized triplet Andreev conductance by an\nelectric supercurrent. The MAE stems from the spin polarization of the\nCooper-pair condensate due to a supercurrent-induced non-unitary triplet\npairing. We propose the realization of such non-unitary pairing and MAE in\nsuperconducting proximity structures based on two-dimensional helical metals --\nstrongly spin-orbit-coupled electronic systems with the Dirac spectrum such as\nthe topological surface states. Our results uncover an unexplored route towards\nelectrically controlled superconducting spintronics and are a smoking gun for\ninduced unconventional superconductivity in spin-orbit-coupled materials.\n", "  The concept of wave-particle duality, which is a key element of quantum\ntheory, has been remarkably found to manifest itself in several experimental\nrealizations as in the famous double-slit experiment. In this specific case, a\nsingle particle seems to travel through two separated slits simultaneously.\nNevertheless, it is never possible to measure it in both slits, which naturally\nappears as a manifestation of the collapse postulate. In this respect, one\ncould as well ask if it is possible to \"perceive\" the presence of the particle\nat the two slits simultaneously, once its collapse could be avoided. In this\narticle, we use the recently proposed entanglement mediation protocol to\nprovide a positive answer to this question. It is shown that a photon which\nbehaves like a wave, i.e., which seems to be present in two distant locations\nat the same time, can modify two existing physical realities in these\nlocations. Calculations of the \"weak trace\" left by such photon also enforce\nthe validity of the present argumentation.\n", "  We describe a technique for using simulated tensor perturbations in order to\nplace upper limits on the intensity of magnetic fields in the early universe.\nAs an example, we apply this technique to the beginning of primordial\nnucleosynthesis. We determined that any magnetic seed fields that existed\nbefore that time were still in the process of being amplified. In the future,\nwe plan to apply this technique to a wider range of initial magnetic fields and\ncosmological epochs.\n", "  We consider a semi-infinite spatially dispersive dielectric with unequal\ntransverse and longitudinal susceptibilities. The effect of the boundary is\ncharacterized by arbitrary reflection coefficients for polarization waves in\nthe material that propagate to the surface. Specific values of these\ncoefficients correspond to various additional boundary conditions (ABC) for\nMaxwell's equations. We derive the electromagnetic reflection and transmission\ncoefficients at the boundary and investigate their dependence on material\nparameters and ABC. We also investigate the electromagnetic zero-point and\nthermal spectral energy density outside the dielectric. The nonlocal response\nremoves the boundary divergence of the spectral energy density that is present\nin a local model. The spectral energy density shows a large dependence on the\ndifference between the transverse and longitudinal susceptibilities, even at\ndistances up to 10nm from the boundary.\n", "  We analyze the exchange of information in different cosmological backgrounds\nwhen sender and receiver are timelike separated and communicate through\nmassless fields (without the exchange of light-signals). Remarkably, we show\nthat the dominance of a cosmological constant makes the amount of recoverable\ninformation imprinted in the field by the sender extremely resilient: it does\nnot decay in time or with the spatial separation of sender and receiver, and it\nactually increases with the rate of expansion of the Universe. This is in stark\ncontrast with the information carried by conventional light-signals and with\nprevious results on timelike communication through massless fields in matter\ndominated cosmologies.\n", "  We argue that moduli stabilization generically restricts the evolution\nfollowing transitions between weakly coupled de Sitter vacua and can induce a\nstrong selection bias towards inflationary cosmologies. The energy density of\ndomain walls between vacua typically destabilizes Kahler moduli and triggers a\nrunaway towards large volume. This decompactification phase can collapse the\nnew de Sitter region unless a minimum amount of inflation occurs after the\ntransition. A stable vacuum transition is guaranteed only if the inflationary\nexpansion generates overlapping past light cones for all observable modes\noriginating from the reheating surface, which leads to an approximately flat\nand isotropic universe. High scale inflation is vastly favored. Our results\npoint towards a framework for studying parameter fine-tuning and inflationary\ninitial conditions in flux compactifications.\n", "  Nanophotonic quantum information processing systems require spatially\nordered, spectrally uniform single photon sources (SPSs) integrated on-chip\nwith co-designed light manipulating elements providing emission rate\nenhancement, emitted photon guidance, and lossless propagation. Towards this\ngoal, we consider systems comprising an SPS array with each SPS coupled to a\ndielectric building block (DBB) based multifunctional light manipulation unit\n(LMU). For the SPS array, we report triggered single photon emission from\nGaAs(001)/InGaAs single quantum dots (SQDs) grown selectively on top of\nnanomesas using the approach of substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy\n(SESRE). Systematic temperature and power dependent photoluminescence (PL), PL\nexcitation, time-resolved PL, and emission statistics studies reveal high\nspectral uniformity and single photon emission at 8 K with g(2)(0) of 0.19\nplusminus 0.03. The SESRE based SPS arrays, following growth of a planarizing\noverlayer, are readily integrable with LMUs fabricated subsequently using\neither the 2D photonic crystal approach or, as theoretically examined here, DBB\nbased LMUs. We report the simulated optical response of SPS embedded in DBB\nbased nanoantenna-waveguide structures as the multifunctional LMU. The multiple\nfunctions of emission rate enhancement, guiding, and lossless propagation\nderive from the behavior of the same collective Mie resonance (dominantly\nmagnetic) of the interacting DBB based LMU tuned to the SPS targeted emission\nwavelength of 980 nm. The simulation utilizes an analytical approach that\nprovides physical insight to the obtained numerical results. Together, the\ncombined experimental and modelling demonstrations open a rich approach to\nimplementing co-designed on-chip integrated SPS-LMU that, in turn, serve as\nbasic elements of integrated nanophotonic information processing systems.\n", "  We study $\\Lambda$ baryons of spin-parity $\\frac{1}{2}^{\\pm}$ with either a\nstrange or charm valence quark in full 2+1 flavor lattice QCD. Multiple $SU(3)$\nsinglet and octet operators are employed to generate the desired single baryon\nstates on the lattice. Via the variational method, the couplings of these\nstates to the different operators provide information about the flavor\nstructure of the $\\Lambda$ baryons. We make use of the gauge configurations of\nthe PACS-CS Collaboration and chirally extrapolate the results for the masses\nand $SU(3)$ flavor components to the physical point. We furthermore gradually\nchange the hopping parameter of the heaviest quark from strange to charm to\nstudy how the properties of the $\\Lambda$ baryons evolve as a function of the\nheavy quark mass. It is found that the baryon energy levels increase almost\nlinearly with the quark mass. Meanwhile, the flavor structure of most of the\nstates remains stable, with the exception of the lowest $\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$\nstate, which changes from a flavor singlet $\\Lambda$ to a $\\Lambda_c$ state\nwith singlet and octet components of comparable size. Finally, we discuss\nwhether our findings can be interpreted with the help of a simple quark model\nand find that the negative-parity $\\Lambda_c$ states can be naturally explained\nas diquark excitations of the light $u$ and $d$ quarks. On the other hand, the\nquark-model picture does not appear to be adequate for the negative-parity\n$\\Lambda$ states, suggesting the importance of other degrees of freedom to\ndescribe them.\n", "  We aim to present a generalized Bayesian inference method for constraining\ninteriors of super Earths and sub-Neptunes. Our methodology succeeds in\nquantifying the degeneracy and correlation of structural parameters for high\ndimensional parameter spaces. Specifically, we identify what constraints can be\nplaced on composition and thickness of core, mantle, ice, ocean, and\natmospheric layers given observations of mass, radius, and bulk refractory\nabundance constraints (Fe, Mg, Si) from observations of the host star's\nphotospheric composition. We employed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference\nanalysis that formally accounts for observational and model uncertainties.\nUsing a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we computed joint and marginal\nposterior probability distributions for all structural parameters of interest.\nWe included state-of-the-art structural models based on self-consistent\nthermodynamics of core, mantle, high-pressure ice, and liquid water.\nFurthermore, we tested and compared two different atmospheric models that are\ntailored for modeling thick and thin atmospheres, respectively. First, we\nvalidate our method against Neptune. Second, we apply it to synthetic\nexoplanets of fixed mass and determine the effect on interior structure and\ncomposition when (1) radius, (2) atmospheric model, (3) data uncertainties, (4)\nsemi-major axes, (5) atmospheric composition (i.e., a priori assumption of\nenriched envelopes versus pure H/He envelopes), and (6) prior distributions are\nvaried. Our main conclusions are: [...]\n", "  The problem of explaining both inflationary and dark matter physics in the\nframework of a minimal extension of the Standard Model was investigated. To\nthis end, the Standard Model completed by a real scalar singlet playing a role\nof the dark matter candidate has been considered. We assumed both the dark\nmatter field and the Higgs doublet to be nonminimally coupled to gravity. Using\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime we derived an effective action for the\ninflationary period and analyzed its consequences. In this approach, after\nintegrating out both dark matter and Standard Model sectors we obtained the\neffective action expressed purely in terms of the gravitational field. We paid\nspecial attention to determination, by explicit calculations, of the form of\ncoefficients controlling the higher-order in curvature gravitational terms.\nTheir connection to the Standard Model coupling constants has been discussed.\n", "  We use the concept of the spiral rotation curves universality to investigate\nthe luminous and dark matter properties of the dwarf disc galaxies in the local\nvolume (size $\\sim11$ Mpc). Our sample includes 36 objects with rotation curves\ncarefully selected from the literature. We find that, despite the large\nvariations of our sample in luminosities ($\\sim$ 2 of dex), the rotation curves\nin specifically normalized units, look all alike and lead to the lower-mass\nversion of the universal rotation curve of spiral galaxies found in Persic et\nal. We mass model the double normalized universal rotation curve\n$V(R/R_{opt})/V_{opt}$ of dwarf disc galaxies: the results show that these\nsystems are totally dominated by dark matter whose density shows a core size\nbetween 2 and 3 stellar disc scale lengths. Similar to galaxies of different\nHubble types and luminosities, the core radius $r_0$ and the central density\n$\\rho_0$ of the dark matter halo of these objects are related by $ \\rho_0 r_0\n\\sim 100\\hspace{0.1cm} \\mathrm{M_\\odot pc^{-2}}$. The structural properties of\nthe dark and luminous matter emerge very well correlated. In addition, to\ndescribe these relations, we need to introduce a new parameter, measuring the\ncompactness of light distribution of a (dwarf) disc galaxy. These structural\nproperties also indicate that there is no evidence of abrupt decline at the\nfaint end of the baryonic to halo mass relation. Finally, we find that the\ndistributions of the stellar disc and its dark matter halo are closely related.\n", "  Magnetic excitations are investigated for a hexagonal polar magnet Fe2Mo3O8\nby terahertz spectroscopy. We observed magnon modes including an electric-field\nactive magnon, electromagnon, in the collinear antiferromagnetic phase with\nspins parallel to the c axis. We unravel the nature of these excitations by\ninvestigating the correlation between the evolution of the mode profile and the\nmagnetic transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic order induced by\nmagnetic field or Zn-doping. We propose that the observed electromagnon mode\ninvolves the collective precession of the spins with oscillating in-plane\nelectric polarization through the mechanism of the linear magnetoelectric\neffect.\n", "  We study the spread of a persuasive new idea through a population of\ncontinuous-time random walkers in one dimension. The idea spreads via social\ngatherings involving groups of nearby walkers who act according to a biased\n\"majority rule\": After each gathering, the group takes on the new idea if more\nthan a critical fraction $\\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{2} < \\frac{1}{2}$ of them\nalready hold it; otherwise they all reject it. The boundary of a domain where\nthe new idea has taken hold expands as a traveling wave in the density of new\nidea holders. Our walkers move by L\\'{e}vy motion, and we compute the wave\nvelocity analytically as a function of the frequency of social gatherings and\nthe exponent of the jump distribution. When this distribution is sufficiently\nheavy tailed, then, counter to intuition, the idea can propagate faster if\nsocial gatherings are held less frequently. When jumps are truncated, a\ncritical gathering frequency can emerge which maximizes propagation velocity.\nWe explore our model by simulation, confirming our analytical results.\n", "  We calculate the phase diagram of identical fermions in a 2-dimensional (2D)\nlattice immersed in a 3D Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The fermions exchange\ndensity fluctuations in the BEC, which gives rise to an attractive induced\ninteraction. The resulting zero temperature phase diagram exhibits topological\n$p_x+ip_y$ superfluid phases as well as a phase separation region. We show how\nto use the flexibility of the Bose-Fermi mixture to tune the induced\ninteraction, so that it maximises the pairing between nearest neighbour sites,\nwhereas phase separation originating from long range interactions is\nsuppressed. Finally, we calculate the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\ncritical temperature of the topological superfluid in the lattice and discuss\nexperimental realisations.\n", "  We develop the field theory of antiferromagnets to layered structures on BCT\ncrystal lattices with nearest-neibour and next-nearest-neighbour ferro- and/or\nantiferromagnetic interactions. For this aim the field theoretical counterpart\nof a lattice Heisenberg model is derived by standard theoretical methods:\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation and a generalized mean-field approach. We\nshown that the inter-layer interactions are a pure thermal fluctuation effect\nwhereas the ground state is characterized by a perfect in-layer\nantiferromagnetic order and a lack of inter-layer coupling. This is a\ndemonstration of 2D-3D dimensional crossover which is supposed to occur in real\nantiferromagnets, for example, in the spin-dimer antiferromagnet BaCuSi2O6.\n", "  This is a brief review of my work on the correspondence between\nfour-dimensional $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetric field theories realized by\nbrane tilings and two-dimensional integrable lattice models. I explain how to\nconstruct integrable lattice models from extended operators in partially\ntopological quantum field theories, and elucidate the correspondence as an\napplication of this construction.\n", "  Over the past decades, a great body of theoretical and mathematical work has\nbeen devoted to random-matrix descriptions of open quantum systems. In these\nnotes, based on lectures delivered at the Les Houches Summer School \"Stochastic\nProcesses and Random Matrices\" in July 2015, we review the physical origins and\nmathematical structures of the underlying models, and collect key predictions\nwhich give insight into the typical system behaviour. In particular, we aim to\ngive an idea how the different features are interlinked. The notes mainly focus\non elastic scattering but also include a short detour to interacting systems,\nwhich we motivate by the overarching question of ergodicity. The first chapters\nintroduce general notions from random matrix theory, such as the ten\nuniversality classes and ensembles of hermitian, unitary, positive-definite and\nnon-hermitian matrices. We then review microscopic scattering models that form\nthe basis for statistical descriptions, and consider signatures of random\nscattering in decay, dynamics and transport. The last chapter briefly touches\non Anderson localization and localization in interacting systems.\n", "  We use the recently released cosmic chronometer data and the latest measured\nvalue of the local Hubble parameter, combined with the latest joint light\ncurves of Supernovae Type Ia, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation distance\nmeasurements, in order to impose constraints on the viable and most used $f(R)$\ngravity models. We consider four $f(R)$ models, namely the Hu-Sawicki, the\nStarobinsky, the Tsujikawa, and the exponential one, and we parametrize them\nintroducing a distortion parameter $b$ that quantifies the deviation from\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our analysis reveals that a small but non-zero\ndeviation from $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology is slightly favored, with the\ncorresponding fittings exhibiting very efficient $AIC$ and $BIC$ Information\nCriteria values. Clearly, $f(R)$ gravity is consistent with observations, and\nit can serve as a candidate for modified gravity.\n", "  The empirical correlation between the mass of a super-massive black hole\n(MBH) and its host galaxy properties is widely considered to be evidence of\ntheir co-evolution. A powerful way to test the co-evolution scenario and learn\nabout the feedback processes linking galaxies and nuclear activity is to\nmeasure these correlations as a function of redshift. Unfortunately, currently\nMBH can only be estimated in active galaxies at cosmological distances. At\nthese distances, bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) can outshine the host\ngalaxy, making it extremely difficult to measure the host's luminosity.\nStrongly lensed AGNs provide in principle a great opportunity to improve the\nsensitivity and accuracy of the host galaxy luminosity measurements as the host\ngalaxy is magnified and more easily separated from the point source, provided\nthe lens model is sufficiently accurate. In order to measure the MBH-L\ncorrelation with strong lensing, it is necessary to ensure that the lens\nmodelling is accurate, and that the host galaxy luminosity can be recovered to\nat least a precision and accuracy better than that of the typical MBH\nmeasurement. We carry out extensive and realistic simulations of deep Hubble\nSpace Telescope observations of lensed AGNs obtained by our collaboration. We\nshow that the host galaxy luminosity can be recovered with better accuracy and\nprecision than the typical uncertainty on MBH(~ 0.5 dex) for hosts as faint as\n2-4 magnitudes dimmer than the AGN itself. Our simulations will be used to\nestimate bias and uncertainties on the actual measurements to be presented in a\nfuture paper.\n", "  Unconventional superconductivity in iron pnictides and chalcogenides has been\nsuggested to be controlled by the interplay of low-energy antiferromagnetic\nspin fluctuations and the particular topology of the Fermi surface in these\nmaterials. Based on this premise, one would also expect the large class of\nisostructural and isoelectronic iron germanide compounds to be good\nsuperconductors. As a matter of fact, they, however, superconduct at very low\ntemperatures or not at all. In this work we establish that superconductivity in\niron germanides is suppressed by strong ferromagnetic tendencies, which\nsurprisingly do not originate from changes in bond-angles or -distances with\nrespect to iron pnictides and chalcogenides, but are due to changes in the\nelectronic structure in a wide range of energies happening upon substitution of\natom species (As by Ge and the corresponding spacer cations). Our results\nindicate that superconductivity in iron-based materials may not always be fully\nunderstood based on $d$ or $dp$ model Hamiltonians only.\n", "  We present the magnetic and thermal properties of the bosonic-superfluid\nphase in a spin-dimer network using both quasistatic and rapidly-changing\npulsed magnetic fields. The entropy derived from a heat-capacity study reveals\nthat the pulsed-field measurements are strongly adiabatic in nature and are\nresponsible for the onset of a significant magnetocaloric effect (MCE). In\ncontrast to previous predictions we show that the MCE is not just confined to\nthe critical regions, but occurs for all fields greater than zero at\nsufficiently low temperatures. We explain the MCE using a model of the thermal\noccupation of exchange-coupled dimer spin-states and highlight that failure to\ntake this effect into account inevitably leads to incorrect interpretations of\nexperimental results. In addition, the heat capacity in our material is\nsuggestive of an extraordinary contribution from zero-point fluctuations and\nappears to indicate universal behavior with different critical exponents at the\ntwo field-induced critical points. The data are consistent with a\ntwo-dimensional nature of spin excitations in the system.\n", "  Starting by revisiting Special Relativity, here we provide a reliable\ncharacterization of the entire 4-dimensional fundamental structures in our\nreality where the frame of discrete tangent space of $F^{1,3}$ is quantized to\nmassless, zero-momentum particles distributing on a 4-dimensional regular base\n$\\{\\mathbb{N}\\cdot c_\\alpha\\}$ with metric\n$B(c_\\alpha,c_\\beta)=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\text{diag}(+,+,+,+)$, determining\nthe constant $c$ locally, as well as instant characterizations on all particles\nmoving along the proper time of $\\tau\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Together with\n$\\phi_\\text{IV}$ on 1-dimensional space $\\{\\mathbb{N}\\cdot c_4\\}$ of\n$B(c_\\alpha,c_4)=0$, the quantized particles of tangent frame are split\nanti-symmetrically from roots $\\gamma_{\\alpha4}$ in a rank-4 Lie algebra with\nexactly $c_\\alpha$ the generators of its Cartan subalgebra. As with the\ncombined frame-Higgs valued in $\\gamma_{\\alpha4}$, every massive particle is\nrelated to some split frame and Higgs to obtain its unique quantized relative\n3-velocity, 4-velocity, and rest mass under the restriction of Pauli Exclusion\nPrinciple at each $\\tau$. We calculated the domains $S_i\\subset F$ and\n$S_0\\subset F_\\geq$ in $F_\\geq\\oplus F^3$ the spacetime in which a massive\nparticle $\\mathtt{p}$ evolves with $\\{x^\\alpha\\}$ of $x^\\alpha\\in S_\\alpha$ the\ncoordinate its Center-of-Mass under an eligible observation that $\\vert\nF\\vert=\\vert F_\\geq\\vert=\\aleph_0<\\vert\\mathbb{R}\\vert$, available for\npost-Newtonian approaches.\n", "  We calculate current (shot) noise in a metallic diffusive conductor generated\nby spin imbalance in the absence of a net electric current. This situation is\nmodeled in an idealized three-terminal setup with two biased ferromagnetic\nleads (F-leads) and one normal lead (N-lead). Parallel magnetization of the\nF-leads gives rise in spin-imbalance and finite shot noise at the N-lead.\nFinite spin relaxation results in an increase of the shot noise, which depends\non the ratio of the length of the conductor ($L$) and the spin relaxation\nlength ($l_s$). For $L\\gg l_s$ the shot noise increases by a factor of two and\ncoincides with the case of the anti-parallel magnetization of the F-leads.\n", "  We report on two-photon interference (TPI) experiments using remote\ndeterministic single-photon sources. Employing 3D in-situ electron-beam\nlithography, we fabricate quantum-light sources at specific target wavelengths\nby integrating pre-selected semiconductor quantum dots within monolithic\nmicrolenses. The individual single-photon sources show TPI visibilities of 49%\nand 22%, respectively, under pulsed p-shell excitation at 80 MHz. For the\nmutual TPI of the remote sources, we observe an uncorrected visibility of 29%,\nin quantitative agreement with the pure dephasing of the individual sources.\nDue to its efficient photon extraction within a broad spectral range (> 20 nm),\nour microlens-based approach is predestinated for future entanglement swapping\nexperiments utilizing entangled photon pairs emitted by distant\nbiexciton-exciton radiative cascades.\n", "  We derive the necessary conditions for implementing a regulator that depends\non both momentum and frequency in the nonperturbative renormalization group\nflow equations of out-of-equilibrium statistical systems. We consider model A\nas a benchmark and compute its dynamical critical exponent $z$. This allows us\nto show that frequency regulators compatible with causality and the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem can be devised. We show that when the Principle\nof Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) is employed to optimize the critical exponents\n$\\eta$, $\\nu$ and $z$, the use of frequency regulators becomes necessary to\nmake the PMS a self-consistent criterion.\n", "  We scrutinize the behavior of eigenvalues of an electron of Helium atom as it\ninteracts with electric field directed along $z$-axis and exposed to linearly\npolarized intense laser field radiation. In order to achieve this, we freeze\none electron of the helium atom at its ionic ground state and the motion of the\nsecond electron in the ion core is treated via a more general case of screened\nCoulomb potential model. Using the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) unitary\ntransformation, which is semiclassical counterpart of the Block-Nordsieck\ntransformation in the quantized field formalism, the squared vector potential\nthat appears in the equation of motion is eliminated and the resultant equation\nis expressed in KH frame. Within this frame, the resulting potential and the\ncorresponding wave function have been expanded in Fourier series and using\nEhlotzkys approximation, we obtain a laser-dressed potential to simulate\nintense laser field. By fitting the more general case of screened Coulomb\npotential model into the laser-dressed potential, and then expanding it in\nTaylor series up to $\\mathcal{O}(r^4,\\alpha_0^9)$, we obtain the solution\n(eigenvalues and wave function) of an electron of Helium atom under the\ninfluence of external electric field and high-intensity laser field, within the\nframework of perturbation theory formalism. We found that the variation in\nfrequency of laser radiation has no effect on the eigenvalues of an electron of\nhelium for a particular electric field intensity directed along $z$-axis. Also,\nfor a very strong external electric field and an infinitesimal screening\nparameter, the system is strongly bound. This work has potential application in\nthe areas of atomic and molecular processes in external fields including\ninteractions with strong fields and short pulses.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of utilising 21cm intensity mapping, optical\ngalaxy, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys to constrain the power\nspectrum of primordial fluctuations predicted by single-field slow-roll\ninflation models. Implementing a Fisher forecast analysis, we derive\nconstraints on the spectral tilt parameter $n_{\\rm s}$ and its first and second\nrunnings $(\\alpha_{\\rm s},\\beta_{\\rm s})$. We show that 21cm intensity mapping\nsurveys with instruments like the Square Kilometre Array, CHIME, and HIRAX, can\nbe powerful probes of the primordial features. We combine our forecasts with\nthe ones derived for a COrE-like CMB survey, as well as for a Stage IV optical\ngalaxy survey similar to Euclid. The synergies between different surveys can be\nexploited to rule out a large fraction of the available inflationary models.\n", "  We report on the low and moderate Q^2 nucleon spin structure measurements\ndone at Jefferson Lab, examining specifically the inclusive program. We discuss\nwhat the data teach us about quark confinement and the emergence of the\neffective hadronic degrees of freedom from the fundamental partonic ones. We\nshow how this experimental program has reached its goal by providing a precise\nmapping at low, intermediate and moderately high Q^2 which has followed in many\nadvances, e.g., with Chiral Perturbation Theory. Another example of a recent\nadvance imputable to the JLab spin data is the improved understanding of\n\\alpha_s at low energy, which allowed Light-Front Holographic QCD, an\napproximation to non-perturbative QCD, to derive the hadron spectrum from\n\\Lambda_s.\n", "  A new mode of nuclear fission has been proposed by the FOBOS collaboration,\ncalled Collinear Cluster Tri-partition (CCT), suggesting that three heavy\nfission fragments can be emitted perfectly collinearly in low-energy fission.\nIt is surprising that CCT escaped observation for so long given the relatively\nhigh reported yield, of roughly 0.5% relative to binary fission. These claims\ncall for an independent verification with a different experimental technique.\nVerification experiments based on direct observation of CCT fragments with\nfission fragment spectrometers require guidance with respect to the allowed\nkinetic energy range, which we present in this paper. We discuss corresponding\nmodel calculations which, if CCT is found in such verification experiments,\ncould indicate how the breakups proceed. We also study the intrinsic stability\nof collinearity. Three different decay models are used, which span together the\ntimescales of three-body fission. These models are used to calculate the\npossible kinetic energy ranges of CCT fragments in 235U(n,f) and 252Cf(sf). We\nuse semi-classical trajectory calculations with a Monte-Carlo method to study\nthe intrinsic stability of collinearity. CCT has a high net Q-value, but in a\nsequential decay, the intermediate steps are energetically and geometrically\nunfavorable or even forbidden. Moreover, perfect collinearity is extremely\nunstable, and broken by the slightest perturbation. According to our results,\nthe central fragment would be very difficult to detect due to its low kinetic\nenergy, raising the question of why previous experiments could not detect a\nmissing-mass signature corresponding to CCT. We find that a realization of CCT\nwould require an unphysical fine-tuning of the initial conditions. Our results\nenable independent experimental verification and encourage further critical\ntheoretical studies of CCT.\n", "  The energy level structure of ${}^{12}$C nucleus at a few MeV above the\nthree-$\\alpha$ threshold is still unsatisfactory known. For instance, most\nmicroscopic calculations predicted that there exist one $0^+$-state in this\nenergy region besides the well known Hoyle state, while some experimental and\ntheoretical studies show the existing of two $0^+$-states.\n  In this paper, I will take a three-$\\alpha$-boson (3$\\alpha$) model for bound\nand continuum states in ${}^{12}$C, and study a transition process from the\n${}^{12}$C($0_1^+$) ground state to 3$\\alpha$ $0^+$ continuum states by the\nelectric monopole ($E0$) operator. The strength distribution of the process\nwill be calculated as a function of $3\\alpha$ energy using the Faddeev\nthree-body theory. The Hamiltonian for the $3\\alpha$ system consists of two-\nand three-$\\alpha$ potentials, and some three-$\\alpha$ potentials with\ndifferent range parameters will be examined.\n  Results of the strength function show a double-peaked bump at low energy\nregion, which can be considered as two $0^+$-states. The peak at higher energy\nmay originate from a 3$\\alpha$ resonant state. However, it is unlikely that the\npeak at the lower energy is related to a resonant state, which suggests that it\nmay be due to so called \"ghost anomaly\". Distributions of decaying particles\nare also calculated.\n", "  A quantum phase transition is generally thought to imprint distinctive\ncharacteristics on the nonequilibrium dynamics of a closed quantum system.\nSpecifically, the Loschmidt echo after a sudden quench to a quantum critical\npoint $-$ measuring the time dependence of the overlap between initial and\ntime-evolved states $-$ is expected to exhibit an accelerated relaxation\nfollowed by periodic revivals. We here introduce a new exactly solvable model,\nthe extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the Loschmidt echo of which provides a\ncounterexample. A parallell analysis of the quench dynamics of the three-site\nspin-interacting $XY$ model allows us to pinpoint the conditions under which a\nperiodic Loschmidt revival actually appears\n", "  The energy dependence of the rate coefficient of the H$_2^+\\ + {\\rm H}_2\n\\rightarrow {\\rm H}_3^+ + {\\rm H}$ reaction has been measured in the range of\ncollision energies between $k_\\mathrm{B}\\cdot 10$ K and $k_\\mathrm{B}\\cdot 300$\nmK. A clear deviation of the rate coefficient from the value expected on the\nbasis of the classical Langevin-capture behavior has been observed at collision\nenergies below $k_\\mathrm{B}\\cdot 1$ K, which is attributed to the joint\neffects of the ion-quadrupole and Coriolis interactions in collisions involving\northo-H$_2$ molecules in the $j = 1$ rotational level, which make up 75% of the\npopulation of the neutral H$_2$ molecules in the experiments. The experimental\nresults are compared to very recent predictions by Dashevskaya, Litvin, Nikitin\nand Troe (J. Chem. Phys., in press), with which they are in agreement.\n", "  On the basis of the augmented quasiclassical theory of superconductivity with\nthe Lorentz force, we study the mag- netic field dependence of the charge\ndistribution due to the Lorentz force in a d-wave vortex lattice with\nanisotropic Fermi surfaces. Owing to the competition between the energy-gap and\nFermi surface anisotropies, the charge profile in the vortex lattice changes\ndramatically with increasing magnetic field because of the overlaps of each\nnearest vortex-core charge. In addition, the accumulated charge in the core\nregion may reverse its sign as a function of magnetic field. This strong field\ndependence of the vortex-core charge cannot be observed in the model with an\nisotropic Fermi surface.\n", "  We investigate the nonradial oscillations of newly born neutron stars (NSs)\nand strange quark stars (SQSs). This is done with the relativistic nuclear\nfield theory with hyperon degrees of freedom employed to describe the equation\nof state for the stellar matter in NSs, and with both the MIT bag model and the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model adopted to construct the configurations of the SQSs.\nWe find that the gravitational-mode ($g$-mode) eigenfrequencies of newly born\nSQSs are about one order of magnitude lower than those of NSs, which is\nindependent of models implemented to describe the equation of state for the\nstrange quark matter. Meanwhile the eigenfrequencies of the other modes of\nnonradial oscillations, e.g., fundamental ($f$)- and pressure ($p$)-modes, are\nmuch larger than those of the $g$-mode. In the light of the first direct\nobservation of gravitational waves, it is promising to employ the gravitational\nwaves to identify the QCD phase transition in high density strong interaction\nmatter.\n", "  We demonstrate that Optimal Control Theory (OCT) with a state-dependent\nconstraint which depends on the state of the system at each instant can\nreproduce the famous counterintuitive mechanism of Stimulated Raman adiabatic\npassage (STIRAP). We examine this behavior in a {\\Lambda}-type three-level\nsystem and we show that could be applied for sequentially coupled many-level\nsystems. We study the robustness of the two methods with respect to pulse\nfluctuations and the decays. We show that new OCT formulation appears to be\nmore robust than STIRAP when a perturbation is introduced in the pulses. Such\nmethod is of great use for systems involving coherence loss such as molecular\nsystems with dissociation or ionization limits. It also may find potential\napplications in the control of chemical reactions, quantum optics, and quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  Following a paper in which the fundamental aspects of probabilistic inference\nwere introduced by means of a toy experiment, details of the analysis of\nsimulated long sequences of extractions are shown here. In fact, the striking\nperformance of probability-based inference and forecasting, compared to those\nobtained by simple `rules', might impress those practitioners who are usually\nunderwhelmed by the philosophical foundation of the different methods. The\nanalysis of the sequences also shows how the smallness of the probability of\nwhat has been actually observed, given the hypotheses of interest, is\nirrelevant for the purpose of inference.\n", "  The analysis of networks affects the research of many real phenomena. The\ncomplex network structure can be viewed as a network's state at the time of the\nanalysis or as a result of the process through which the network arises.\nResearch activities focus on both and, thanks to them, we know not only many\nmeasurable properties of networks but also the essence of some phenomena that\noccur during the evolution of networks. One typical research area is the\nanalysis of co-authorship networks and their evolution. In our paper, the\nanalysis of one real-world co-authorship network and inspiration from existing\nmodels form the basis of the hypothesis from which we derive new 3-lambda\nnetwork model. This hypothesis works with the assumption that regular behavior\nof nodes revolves around an average. However, some anomalies may occur. The\n3-lambda model is stochastic and uses the three parameters associated with the\naverage behavior of the nodes. The growth of the network based on this model\nassumes that one step of the growth is an interaction in which both new and\nexisting nodes are participating. In the paper we present the results of the\nanalysis of a co-authorship network and formulate a hypothesis and a model\nbased on this hypothesis. Later in the paper, we examine the outputs from the\nnetwork generator based on the 3-lambda model and show that generated networks\nhave characteristics known from the environment of real-world networks.\n", "  This is an editorial to the special issue on Cosmic Dust VIII.\n", "  Many social networks exhibit some underlying community structure. In\nparticular, in the context of historical research, clustering of different\ngroups into warring or friendly factions can lead to a better understanding of\nhow conflicts may arise, and whether they could be avoided or not. In this work\nwe study the crisis that started in 1225 when the Emperor of the Holy Roman\nEmpire, Frederick II and his son Henry VII got into a conflict which almost led\nto the rupture and dissolution of the Empire. We use a spin-glass-based\ncommunity detection algorithm to see how good this method is in detecting this\nrift and compare the results with an analysis performed by one of the authors\n(Gramsch) using standard social balance theory applied to History.\n", "  According to the standard model of cosmology, galaxies are embedded in dark\nmatter halos which are made of particles beyond the standard model of particle\nphysics, thus extending the mass and the size of the visible baryonic matter by\ntypically two orders of magnitude. The observed gas distribution throughout the\nnearby M81 group of galaxies shows evidence for past significant galaxy--galaxy\ninteractions but without a merger having occurred. This group is here studied\nfor possible dynamical solutions within the dark-matter standard model. In\norder to cover a comprehensive set of initial conditions, the inner three core\nmembers M81, M82 and NGC3077 are treated as a three-body model based on\nNavarro-Frenk-White profiles. The possible orbits of these galaxies are\nexamined statistically taking into account dynamical friction. Long living,\nnon-merging initial constellations which allow multiple galaxy-galaxy\nencounters comprise unbound galaxies only, which are arriving from a far\ndistance and happen to simultaneously encounter each other within the recent\n500 Myr. Our results are derived by the employment of two separate and\nindependent statistical methods, namely a Markov chain Monte Carlo method and\nthe genetic algorithm using the SAP system environment. The conclusions reached\nare confirmed by high-resolution simulations of live self-consistent systems\n(N-body calculations). Given the observed positions of the three galaxies the\nsolutions found comprise predictions for their proper motions.\n", "  A novel class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on the variational\napproach have recently emerged from separate proposals addressing, for example,\nquantum chemistry and combinatorial problems. These algorithms provide an\napproximate solution to the problem at hand by encoding it in the state of a\nquantum computer. The operations used to prepare the state are not a priori\nfixed but, quite the opposite, are subjected to a classical optimization\nprocedure that modifies the quantum gates and improves the quality of the\napproximate solution. While the quantum hardware determines the size of the\nproblem and what states are achievable (limited, respectively, by the number of\nqubits and by the kind and number of possible quantum gates), it is the\nclassical optimization procedure that determines the way in which the quantum\nstates are explored and whether the best available solution is actually\nreached. In addition, the quantities required in the optimization, for example\nthe objective function itself, have to be estimated with finite precision in\nany experimental implementation. While it is desirable to have very precise\nestimates, this comes at the cost of repeating the state preparation and\nmeasurement multiple times. Here we analyze the competing requirements of high\nprecision and low number of repetitions and study how the overall performance\nof the variational algorithm is affected by the precision level and the choice\nof the optimization method. Finally, this study introduces quasi-Newton\noptimization methods in the general context of hybrid variational algorithms\nand presents quantitative results for the Quantum Approximate Optimization\nAlgorithm.\n", "  We present an image-based method for comparing the structural properties of\ngalaxies produced in hydrodynamical simulations to real galaxies in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. The key feature of our work is the introduction of\nextensive observational realism, such as object crowding, noise and viewing\nangle, to the synthetic images of simulated galaxies, so that they can be\nfairly compared to real galaxy catalogs. We apply our methodology to the\ndust-free synthetic image catalog of galaxies from the Illustris simulation at\n$z=0$, which are then fit with bulge+disc models to obtain morphological\nparameters. In this first paper in a series, we detail our methods, quantify\nobservational biases, and present publicly available bulge+disc decomposition\ncatalogs. We find that our bulge+disc decompositions are largely robust to the\nobservational biases that affect decompositions of real galaxies. However, we\nidentify a significant population of galaxies (roughly 30\\% of the full sample)\nin Illustris that are prone to internal segmentation, leading to systematically\nreduced flux estimates by up to a factor of 6, smaller half-light radii by up\nto a factor of $\\sim$ 2, and generally erroneous bulge-to-total fractions of\n(B/T)=0.\n", "  In this paper, a unified nonlocal rational continuum enrichment technique is\npresented for improving the dispersive characteristics of some well known\nclassical continuum equations on the basis of atomistic dispersion relations.\nThis type of enrichment can be useful in a wide range of mechanical problems\nsuch as localization of strain and damage in many quasibrittle structures, size\neffects in microscale elastoplasticity, and multiscale modeling of materials. A\nnovel technique of transforming a discrete differential expression into an\nexact equivalent rational continuum derivative form is developed considering\nthe Taylor's series transformation of the continuous field variables and\ntraveling wave type of solutions for both the discrete and continuum field\nvariables. An exact equivalent continuum rod representation of the 1D harmonic\nlattice with the non-nearest neighbor interactions is developed considering the\nlattice details. Using similar enrichment technique in the variational\nframework, other useful higher-order equations, namely nonlocal rational\nMindlin-Herrmann rod and nonlocal rational Timoshenko beam equations, are\ndeveloped to explore their nonlocal properties in general. Some analytical and\nnumerical studies on the high frequency dynamic behavior of these novel\nnonlocal rational continuum models are presented with their comparison with the\natomistic solutions for the respective physical systems. These enriched\nrational continuum equations have crucial use in studying high-frequency\ndynamics of many nano-electro-mechanical sensors and devices, dynamics of\nphononic metamaterials, and wave propagation in composite structures.\n", "  Distribution of black spot defects and small clusters in 1 MeV krypton\nirradiated 3C-SiC has been investigated using advanced scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy (STEM) and TEM. We find that two thirds of clusters smaller\nthan 1 nm identified in STEM are invisible in TEM images. For clusters that are\nlarger than 1 nm, STEM and TEM results match very well. A cluster dynamics\nmodel has been developed for SiC to reveal processes that contribute to\nevolution of defect clusters and validated against the (S)TEM results.\nSimulations showed that a model based on established properties of point\ndefects (PDs) generation, reaction, clustering, and cluster dissociation, is\nunable to predict black spot defects distribution consistent with STEM\nobservations. This failure suggests that additional phenomena not included in a\nsimple point-defect picture may contribute to radiation-induced evolution of\ndefect clusters in SiC and using our model we have determined the effects of a\nnumber of these additional phenomena on cluster evolution. Using these\nadditional phenomena it is possible to fit parameters within physically\njustifiable ranges that yield agreement between cluster distributions predicted\nby simulations and those measured experimentally.\n", "  These notes aim at presenting an overview of Bayesian statistics, the\nunderlying concepts and application methodology that will be useful to\nastronomers seeking to analyse and interpret a wide variety of data about the\nUniverse. The level starts from elementary notions, without assuming any\nprevious knowledge of statistical methods, and then progresses to more\nadvanced, research-level topics. After an introduction to the importance of\nstatistical inference for the physical sciences, elementary notions of\nprobability theory and inference are introduced and explained. Bayesian methods\nare then presented, starting from the meaning of Bayes Theorem and its use as\ninferential engine, including a discussion on priors and posterior\ndistributions. Numerical methods for generating samples from arbitrary\nposteriors (including Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Nested Sampling) are then\ncovered. The last section deals with the topic of Bayesian model selection and\nhow it is used to assess the performance of models, and contrasts it with the\nclassical p-value approach. A series of exercises of various levels of\ndifficulty are designed to further the understanding of the theoretical\nmaterial, including fully worked out solutions for most of them.\n", "  We present the results of the long-term (20-year period, from 1996 to 2015)\noptical spectral monitoring of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 7469. The variation in\nthe light-curves of the broad He II {\\lambda}4686A H{\\beta} and H{\\alpha}\nlines, and the continuum at 5100A and 6300A have been explored. The maximum of\nactivity was in 1998, and the variability in the continuum and lines seems to\nhave two periods of around 1200 and 2600 days, however these periodicities\nshould be taken with caution because of the red-noise. Beside these periods,\nthere are several short-term (1-5 days) flare-like events in the light-curves.\nThere are good correlations between the continuum fluxes and H{\\alpha} and\nH{\\beta} line fluxes, but significantly smaller correlation between the He II\nand continuum. We found that the time-lags between the continuum and broad\nlines are different for H{\\beta} (~20 l.d.) and H{\\alpha} (~3 l.d.), and that\nHe II also has a smaller lag (~2-3 l.d.). The H{\\alpha} and H{\\beta} line\nprofiles show a slight red asymmetry, and the broad line profiles did not\nchanged in the 20-year period. Using the lags and widths of H{\\alpha} and\nH{\\beta} we estimated the central black hole mass and found that it is\n~(1-6)x$10^7 M_{\\odot}$, which is in agreement with previous reverberation\nestimates.\n", "  We describe and implement iMapD, a computer-assisted approach for\naccelerating the exploration of uncharted effective Free Energy Surfaces (FES),\nand more generally for the extraction of coarse-grained, macroscopic\ninformation from atomistic or stochastic (here Molecular Dynamics, MD)\nsimulations. The approach functionally links the MD simulator with nonlinear\nmanifold learning techniques. The added value comes from biasing the simulator\ntowards new, unexplored phase space regions by exploiting the smoothness of the\n(gradually, as the exploration progresses) revealed intrinsic low-dimensional\ngeometry of the FES.\n", "  Feynman described the double slit experiment as \"a phenomenon which is\nimpossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way and which\nhas in it the heart of quantum mechanics\". The double slit experiment,\nperformed one photon at a time, dramatically demonstrates the particle-wave\nduality of quantum objects by generating a fringe pattern corresponding to the\ninterference of light (a wave phenomenon) from two slits, even when there is\nonly one photon (a particle) at a time passing through the apparatus. The\nparticle-wave duality of light should also apply to complex three dimensional\noptical fields formed by multi-path interference, however, this has not been\ndemonstrated. Here we observe particle-wave duality of a three dimensional\nfield by generating a trefoil optical vortex knot - one photon at a time. This\nresult demonstrates a fundamental physical principle, that particle-wave\nduality implies interference in both space (between spatially distinct modes)\nand time (through the complex evolution of the superposition of modes), and has\nimplications for topologically entangled single photon states, orbital angular\nmomentum multiplexing and topological quantum computing.\n", "  We numerically investigate the statistical properties of electrochemical\ncapacitance in disordered two-dimensional mesoscopic capacitors. Based on the\ntight-binding Hamiltonian, the Green's function formalism is adopted to study\nthe average electrochemical capacitance, its fluctuation as well as the\ndistribution of capacitance of the disordered mesoscopic capacitors for three\ndifferent ensembles: orthogonal (symmetry index \\beta=1), unitary (\\beta=2),\nand symplectic (\\beta=4). It is found that the electrochemical capacitance in\nthe disordered systems exhibits universal behavior. In the case of single\nconducting channel, the electrochemical capacitance follows a symmetric\nGaussian distribution at weak disorders as expected from the random matrix\ntheory. In the strongly disordered regime, the distribution is found to be a\nsharply one-sided form with a nearly-constant tail in the large capacitance\nregion. This behavior is due to the existence of the necklace states in\ndisordered systems, which is characterized by the multi-resonance that gives\nrise to a large density of states. In addition, it is found that the necklace\nstate also enhances the fluctuation of electrochemical capacitance in the case\nof single conducting channel. When the number of conducting channels increases,\nthe influence of necklace states becomes less important. For large number of\nconducting channels, the electrochemical capacitance fluctuation develops a\nplateau region in the strongly disordered regime. The plateau value is\nidentified as universal electrochemical capacitance fluctuation, which is\nindependent of system parameters such as disorder strength, Fermi energy,\ngeometric capacitance, and system size. Importantly, the universal\nelectrochemical capacitance fluctuation is the same for all three ensembles,\nsuggesting a super-universal behavior.\n", "  We numerically study the parametric pumped current when magnetic field is\napplied both in the adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. In particular, we\ninvestigate the nature of pumped current for systems with resonance as well as\nanti-resonance. It is found that in the adiabatic regime, the pumped current\nchanges sign across the sharp resonance with long lifetime while the\nnon-adiabatic pumped current at finite frequency does not. When the lifetime of\nresonant level is short, the behaviors of adiabatic and non-adiabatic pumped\ncurrent are similar with sign changes. Our results show that at the energy\nwhere complete transmission occurs the adiabatic pumped current is zero while\nnon-adiabatic pumped current is non-zero. Different from the resonant case,\nboth adiabatic and non-adiabatic pumped current are zero at anti-resonance with\ncomplete reflection. We also investigate the pumped current when the other\nsystem parameters such as magnetic field, pumped frequency, and pumping\npotentials. Interesting behaviors are revealed. Finally, we study the symmetry\nrelation of pumped current for several systems with different spatial symmetry\nupon reversal of magnetic field. Different from the previous theoretical\nprediction, we find that a system with general inversion symmetry can pump out\na finite current in the adiabatic regime. At small magnetic field, the pumped\ncurrent has an approximate relation I(B) \\approx I(-B) both in adiabatic and\nnon-adiabatic regimes.\n", "  A photoinduced current of a layered MoS2-based transistor is studied from\nfirst-principles. Under the illumination of circular polarized light, a\nvalley-polarized current is generated, which can be tuned by the gate voltage.\nFor monolayer MoS2, the valley-polarized spin-up (down) electron current at K\n(K') points is induced by the right (left) circular polarized light. The valley\npolarization is found to reach +1.0 (-1.0) for the valley current that carried\nsuch a K (K') index. For bilayer MoS2, the spin-up (down) current can be\ninduced at both K and K' valleys by the right (left) circular light. In\ncontrast to monolayer MoS2, the photoinduced valley polarization shows\nasymmetric behavior upon reversal of the gate voltage. Our results show that\nthe valley polarization of the photoinduced current can be modulated by the\ncircular polarized light and the gate voltage. All the results can be well\nunderstood using a simple kp model.\n", "  We propose, for the first time, a valley Seebeck effect in gate tunable\nzigzag graphene nanoribbons as a result of the interplay between thermal\ngradient and valleytronics. A pure valley current is further generated by the\nthermal gradient as well as the external bias. In a broad temperature range,\nthe pure valley current is found to be linearly dependent on the temperature\ngradient while it increases with the increasing temperature of one lead for a\nfixed thermal gradient. A valley field effect transistor (FET) driven by the\ntemperature gradient is proposed that can turn on and off the pure valley\ncurrent by gate voltage. The threshold gate voltage and on valley current are\nproportional to the temperature gradient. When the system switches on at\npositive gate voltage, the pure valley current is nearly independent of gate\nvoltage. The valley transconductance is up to 30 {\\mu}S if we take Ampere as\nthe unit of the valley current. This valley FET may find potential application\nin future valleytronics and valley caloritronics.\n", "  The round trip time of the light pulse limits the maximum detectable\nfrequency response range of vibration in phase-sensitive optical time domain\nreflectometry ({\\phi}-OTDR). We propose a method to break the frequency\nresponse range restriction of {\\phi}-OTDR system by modulating the light pulse\ninterval randomly which enables a random sampling for every vibration point in\na long sensing fiber. This sub-Nyquist randomized sampling method is suits for\ndetecting sparse-wideband-frequency vibration signals. Up to MHz resonance\nvibration signal with over dozens of frequency components and 1.153MHz single\nfrequency vibration signal are clearly identified for a sensing range of 9.6km\nwith 10kHz maximum sampling rate.\n", "  Formally investigating the sources of students' difficulties around specific\nsubjects is crucial for developing appropriate strategies to help students. We\nhave been studying difficulties in understanding magnetism encountered by\nstudents in the calculus-based introductory physics courses. A majority of\nthese students are engineering majors. Student difficulties were assessed by\nadministering written free-response questions and by developing and\nadministering a research-based multiple-choice test to students. We also\nconducted individual interviews with a subset of students. Some of these\ninterviews were lecture-demonstration based interviews in which students were\nasked to predict the outcomes of experiments, perform the experiments and\nreconcile the differences between their predictions and observations. Some of\nthe common misconceptions found in magnetism are analogous to those found in\nelectrostatics. Some additional difficulties are due to the non-intuitive three\ndimensional nature of the relation between magnetic field, magnetic force and\nvelocity of the charged particles or direction of current. Another finding is\nthat students often used their gut feeling and had more difficulty reconciling\nwith the idea that the magnetic force and field are perpendicular to each other\nwhen they were shown actual lecture-demonstration setups and asked to predict\noutcomes of experiments than when they were asked to explain relation between\nmagnetic force and field theoretically solely based upon an equation. We\ndiscuss the implications of this research to teaching and learning.\n", "  Quantum image processing has been a hot topic. The first step of it is to\nstore an image into qubits, which is called quantum image preparation.\nDifferent quantum image representations may have different preparation methods.\nIn this paper, we use GQIR (the generalized quantum image representation) to\nrepresent an image, and try to decrease the operations used in preparation,\nwhich is also known as quantum image compression. Our compression scheme is\nbased on JPEG (named from its inventor: the Joint Photographic Experts Group)\n--- the most widely used method for still image compression in classical\ncomputers. We input the quantized JPEG coefficients into qubits and then\nconvert them into pixel values. Theoretical analysis and experimental results\nshow that the compression ratio of our scheme is obviously higher than that of\nthe previous compression method.\n", "  These lecture notes, suitable for a two-semester introductory course or\nself-study, offer an elementary and self-contained exposition of the basic\ntools and concepts that are encountered in practical computations in\nperturbative thermal field theory. Selected applications to heavy ion collision\nphysics and cosmology are outlined in the last chapter.\n", "  Linear-scaling electronic structure methods based on the calculation of\nmoments of the underlying electronic Hamiltonian offer a computationally\nefficient and numerically robust scheme to drive large-scale atomistic\nsimulations, in which the quantum-mechanical nature of the electrons is\nexplicitly taken into account. We compare the kernel polynomial method to the\nFermi operator expansion method and establish a formal connection between the\ntwo approaches. We show that the convolution of the kernel polynomial method\nmay be understood as an effective electron temperature. The results of a number\nof possible kernels are formally examined, and then applied to a representative\ntight-binding model.\n", "  We study a static spherically symmetric problem with a black hole and\nradially directed geodesic flows of dark matter. The obtained solutions have\nthe following properties. At large distances, the gravitational field produces\nconstant velocities of circular motion, i.e., flat rotation curves. At smaller\ndistances, the field switches to Newtonian regime, then to Schwarzschild\nregime. Deviations from Schwarzschild regime start below the gravitational\nradius. The dark matter prevents the creation of event horizon, instead, a\nspherical region possessing extremely large redshift is created. The structure\nof space-time for the obtained solutions is investigated and the implications\nfor the models of the galaxies are discussed.\n", "  We construct triaxial dynamical models for the Milky Way nuclear star cluster\nusing Schwarzschild's orbit superposition technique. We fit the stellar\nkinematic maps presented in Feldmeier et al. (2014). The models are used to\nconstrain the supermassive black hole mass M_BH, dynamical mass-to-light ratio\nM/L, and the intrinsic shape of the cluster. Our best-fitting model has M_BH =\n(3.0 +1.1 -1.3)x10^6 M_sun, M/L = (0.90 +0.76 -0.08) M_sun/L_{sun,4.5micron},\nand a compression of the cluster along the line-of-sight. Our results are in\nagreement with the direct measurement of the supermassive black hole mass using\nthe motion of stars on Keplerian orbits. The mass-to-light ratio is consistent\nwith stellar population studies of other galaxies in the mid-infrared. It is\npossible that we underestimate M_BH and overestimate the cluster's triaxiality\ndue to observational effects. The spatially semi-resolved kinematic data and\nextinction within the nuclear star cluster bias the observations to the near\nside of the cluster, and may appear as a compression of the nuclear star\ncluster along the line-of-sight. We derive a total dynamical mass for the Milky\nWay nuclear star cluster of M_MWNSC = (2.1 +-0.7)x10^7 M_sun within a sphere\nwith radius r = 2 x r_eff = 8.4 pc. The best-fitting model is tangentially\nanisotropic in the central r = 0.5-2 pc of the nuclear star cluster, but close\nto isotropic at larger radii. Our triaxial models are able to recover complex\nkinematic substructures in the velocity map.\n", "  Geophysical inversion should ideally produce geologically realistic\nsubsurface models that explain the available data. Multiple-point statistics is\na geostatistical approach to construct subsurface models that are consistent\nwith site-specific data, but also display the same type of patterns as those\nfound in a training image. The training image can be seen as a conceptual model\nof the subsurface and is used as a non-parametric model of spatial variability.\nInversion based on multiple-point statistics is challenging due to high\nnonlinearity and time-consuming geostatistical resimulation steps that are\nneeded to create new model proposals. We propose an entirely new model proposal\nmechanism for geophysical inversion that is inspired by texture synthesis in\ncomputer vision. Instead of resimulating pixels based on higher-order patterns\nin the training image, we identify a suitable patch of the training image that\nreplace a corresponding patch in the current model without breaking the\npatterns found in the training image, that is, remaining consistent with the\ngiven prior. We consider three cross-hole ground-penetrating radar examples in\nwhich the new model proposal mechanism is employed within an extended\nMetropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion. The model proposal step\nis about 40 times faster than state-of-the-art multiple-point statistics\nresimulation techniques, the number of necessary MCMC steps is lower and the\nquality of the final model realizations is of similar quality. The model\nproposal mechanism is presently limited to 2-D fields, but the method is\ngeneral and can be applied to a wide range of subsurface settings and\ngeophysical data types.\n", "  Diffusion couples Zn/CuxTiy were prepared by the melting contact method and\nthen annealed at 663K for various times. Using scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), we discovered 7 new\nsystems, i.e. Zn/Cu9Ti, Zn/Cu4Ti, Zn/Cu2Ti, Zn/Cu7Ti3, Zn/Cu3Ti2, Zn/Cu11Ti9\nand Zn/Cu9Ti11, which can form the interesting periodic-layered structure\nwithin the reaction zones. By the traditional metallographic treatment and the\nin-situ section observation method respectively, it was confirmed that the\nperiodic-layered structure is really composed of the CuZn2 singer-phase and the\n(CuZn2+TiZn3) two-phase layers distributing alternately within the reaction\nfront area. Furthermore, the thickness of the periodic layers relates to the\ncomposition of Cu-Ti substrates: the higher content of Cu atoms in C--Ti alloy\nsubstrates, the thinner the layers will be. The experimental results are in\naccordance to the prediction of the diffusion-induced stresses model.\n", "  Solid state reaction between nanocrystalline Cu and Sn films was investigated\nat room temperature by depth profiling with secondary neutral mass spectrometry\nand by X-ray diffraction. A rapid diffusion intermixing was observed leading to\nthe formation of homogeneous Cu 6Sn5 layer. There is no indication of the\nappearance of the Cu3Sn phase. This offers a way for solid phase soldering at\nlow temperatures, i.e. to produce homogeneous Cu6Sn5 intermediate layer of\nseveral tens of nanometers during reasonable time (in the order of hours or\nless). From the detailed analysis of the growth of the planar reaction layer,\nformed at the initial interface in Sn(100 nm)/Cu(50 nm) system, the value of\nthe parabolic growth rate coefficient at room temperature is 2.3 x 10-15 cm2/s.\nIn addition, the overall increase of the composition near to the substrate\ninside the Cu film was interpreted by grain boundary diffusion induced solid\nstate reaction: the new phase formed along the grain boundaries and grew\nperpendicular to the boundary planes. From the initial slope of the composition\nversus time function, the interface velocity during this reaction was estimated\nto be about 0.5 nm/h.\n", "  Sputtering of PbTe crystals by Ar plasma with ion energies 50-550 eV is\ninvestigated. A dependence of sputter yields of the Te and Pb on the sputtering\nion energy and sputtering time is measured. New phenomena: aperiodical\noscillations of Pb and Te sputtering; a huge preference of Te sputtering\nreaching more than two orders of magnitude at the beginning of sputtering\nprocess; and a significant excess of Te integrated sputter yield over that of\nPb for prolonged sputtering by low energy plasma at 50-160 eV, are observed. It\nis substantiated that these phenomena can be caused by the peculiarities of the\ncharge states of the interstitial Pb and Te in PbTe crystal matrix and the\nprocesses of re-deposition of sputtered atoms on the sputtered surface\n", "  Dielectric resonators are employed to build state-of-the-art low-noise and\nhigh- stability oscillators operating at room and cryogenic temperatures. A\nresonator temperature coefficient of frequency is one criterion of performance.\nThis paper reports on predictions and measurements of this temperature\ncoefficient of frequency for three types of cylindrically-symmetric Bragg\nresonators operated at microwave frequencies. At room temperature, microwave\nBragg resonators have the best potential to reach extremely high Q-factors.\nResearch has been conducted over the last decade on modeling, optimizing and\nrealizing such high Q-factor devices for applications such as filtering,\nsensing, and frequency metrology. We present an optimized design, which has a\ntemperature sensitivity 2 to 4 times less than current whispering gallery mode\nresonators without using temperature compensating techniques and about 30% less\nthan other existing Bragg resonators. Also, the performance of a new generation\nsingle-layered Bragg resonators, based on a hybrid-Bragg-mode, is reported with\na sensitivity of about -12ppm/K at 295K. For a single reflector resonator, it\nachieves a similar level of performance as a double-Bragg-reflector resonator\nbut with a more compact structure and performs six times better than\nwhispering-gallery-mode resonators. The hybrid resonator promises to deliver a\nnew generation of high-sensitivity sensors and high-stability room-temperature\noscillators.\n", "  We have investigated morphology of the lateral surfaces of PbTe crystal\nsamples grown from melt by the Bridgman method sputtered by Ar+ plasma with ion\nenergy of 50-550 eV for 5-50 minutes under Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry\n(SNMS) conditions. The sputtered PbTe crystal surface was found to be\nsimultaneously both the source of sputtered material and the efficient\nsubstrate for re-deposition of the sputtered material during the depth\nprofiling. During sputtering PbTe crystal surface is forming the dimple relief.\nTo be redeposited the sputtered Pb and Te form arrays of the microscopic\nsurface structures in the shapes of hillocks, pyramids, cones and others on the\nPbTe crystal sputtered surface. Correlation between the density of re-deposited\nmicroscopic surface structures, their shape, and average size, on the one hand,\nand the energy and duration of sputtering, on the other, is revealed.\n", "  Scientific curiosity, exploration of georesources and environmental concerns\nare pushing the geoscientific research community toward subsurface\ninvestigations of ever-increasing complexity. This review explores various\napproaches to formulate and solve inverse problems in ways that effectively\nintegrate geological concepts with geophysical and hydrogeological data. Modern\ngeostatistical simulation algorithms can produce multiple subsurface\nrealizations that are in agreement with conceptual geological models and\nstatistical rock physics can be used to map these realizations into physical\nproperties that are sensed by the geophysical or hydrogeological data. The\ninverse problem consists of finding one or an ensemble of such subsurface\nrealizations that are in agreement with the data. The most general inversion\nframeworks are presently often computationally intractable when applied to\nlarge-scale problems and it is necessary to better understand the implications\nof simplifying (1) the conceptual geological model (e.g., using model\ncompression); (2) the physical forward problem (e.g., using proxy models); and\n(3) the algorithm used to solve the inverse problem (e.g., Markov chain Monte\nCarlo or local optimization methods) to reach practical and robust solutions\ngiven today's computer resources and knowledge. We also highlight the need to\nnot only use geophysical and hydrogeological data for parameter estimation\npurposes, but also to use them to falsify or corroborate alternative geological\nscenarios.\n", "  Rare-earth-doped optical materials are important for light sources in\noptoelectronics, as well as for efficient optical amplification elements and\nother elements of photonics. On the basis of the previously developed method of\nanhydrous, low-temperature synthesis of Er/Yb oxides from their chlorides we\nfabricated proper nanoparticles with defined parameters and used them for the\ndevelopment of optically transparent, luminescent polymer nanocomposite with\nlow optical scattering, suitable for direct, light-induced formation of\nphotonic elements. Introduction of preformed gold nanoparticles in such a\nnanocomposite was also performed and an enhancement of luminescence due to the\ninfluence of plasmon effects was detected.\n", "  In this paper we present a parallelization strategy on distributed memory\nsystems for the Fast Kinetic Scheme --- a semi-Lagrangian scheme developed in\n[J. Comput. Phys., Vol. 255, 2013, pp 680-698] for solving kinetic equations.\nThe original algorithm was proposed for the BGK approximation of the collision\nkernel. In this work we deal with its extension to the full Boltzmann equation\nin six dimensions, where the collision operator is resolved by means of fast\nspectral method. We present close to ideal scalability of the proposed\nalgorithm on tera- and peta-scale systems.\n", "  This paper is devoted to present the results of creation of gold\nnanoparticles on titanium surface. We focused on the problem how to create gold\nnanoparticles on the titanium surface with defined particle size and\ndistribution, which could be interesting for several applications (e.g.\nproviding well-defined substrates for biomedical research, etc.). To do that\nthe sample is affected by the complex physical rout of gold nanoparticles\nformation: by gold ion implantation, thin Au layer deposition and thermal\nannealing. The effect of the technology, influence on the surface structure and\nits parameters were investigated by the X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron\nand Atomic Force Microscopy, as well as by Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry\nmethods.\n", "  Quantification of Ge in Si1-xGex structures (0.092<x<0.78) was carried by\ntime-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and electron-gas\nsecondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS). A good linear correlation\n(R2>0.9997) of intensity ratios of GeCs2+/SiCs2+ and 74Ge-/30Si- secondary ions\nand post-ionized 70Ge+/28Si+ sputtered neutrals with Ge concentration was\nobtained. The calibration data were used for quantitative depth profiling of\n[10x(12.3 nm Si0.63Ge0.37/34 nm Si)] structures on Si. Satisfactory compliance\nof the quantified Ge concentration in SiGe layers with the data measured by\nhigh-resolution X-ray diffraction was obtained for both techniques. Both SIMS\nand SNMS experimental profiles were fitted using the Hofmann\nmixing-roughness-information depth (MRI) model. In case of TOF-SIMS the quality\nof the reconstruction was higher than for SNMS since not only the progressing\nroughening, but also crater effect and other processes unaccounted in the MRI\nsimulation could have significant impact on plasma sputter depth profiling.\n", "  The surface properties of metallic implants play an important role in their\nclinical success. Improving upon the inherent shortcomings of Ti implants, such\nas poor bioactivity, is imperative for achieving clinical use. In this study,\nwe have developed a Ti implant modified with Ca or dual Ca + Si ions on the\nsurface using an electron cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS). The\nphysicochemical and biological properties of ion-implanted Ti surfaces were\nanalyzed using various analytical techniques, such as surface analyses,\npotentiodynamic polarization and cell culture. Experimental results indicated\nthat a rough morphology was observed on the Ti substrate surface modified by\nECRIS plasma ions. The in vitro electrochemical measurement results also\nindicated that the Ca + Si ion-implanted surface had a more beneficial and\ndesired behavior than the pristine Ti substrate. Compared to the pristine Ti\nsubstrate, all ion-implanted samples had a lower hemolysis ratio. MG63 cells\ncultured on the high Ca and dual Ca + Si ion-implanted surfaces revealed\nsignificantly greater cell viability in comparison to the pristine Ti\nsubstrate. In conclusion, surface modification by electron cyclotron resonance\nCa and Si ion sources could be an effective method for Ti implants.\n", "  We propose a new framework to compare alternative geostatistical descriptions\nof a given site. Multiple realizations of each of the considered geostatistical\nmodels and their corresponding tomograms (based on inversion of\nnoise-contaminated simulated data) are used as a multivariate training image.\nThe training image is scanned with a direct sampling algorithm to obtain\nconditional realizations of hydraulic conductivity that are not only in\nagreement with the geostatistical model, but also honor the spatially varying\nresolution of the site-specific tomogram. Model comparison is based on the\nquality of the simulated geophysical data from the ensemble of conditional\nrealizations. The tomogram in this study is obtained by inversion of cross-hole\nground-penetrating radar (GPR) first-arrival travel time data acquired at the\nMAcro-Dispersion Experiment (MADE) site in Mississippi (USA). Various\nheterogeneity descriptions ranging from multi-Gaussian fields to fields with\ncomplex multiple-point statistics inferred from outcrops are considered. Under\nthe assumption that the relationship between porosity and hydraulic\nconductivity inferred from local measurements is valid, we find that\nconditioned multi-Gaussian realizations and derivatives thereof can explain the\ncrosshole geophysical data. A training image based on an aquifer analog from\nGermany was found to be in better agreement with the geophysical data than the\none based on the local outcrop, which appears to under-represent high hydraulic\nconductivity zones. These findings are only based on the information content in\na single resolution-limited tomogram and extending the analysis to tracer or\nhigher resolution surface GPR data might lead to different conclusions (e.g.,\nthat discrete facies boundaries are necessary).\n", "  The color of hot-dip galvanized steel sheet was adjusted in a reproducible\nway using a liquid Zn-Ti metallic bath, air atmosphere, and controlling the\nbath temperature as the only experimental parameter. Coloring was found only\nfor sample s cooled in air and dipped into Ti-containing liquid Zn. For samples\ndipped into a 0.15 wt pct Ti-containing Zn bath, the color remained metallic\n(gray) below a 792 K (519 C) bath temperature; it was yellow at 814 K, violet\nat 847 K, and blue at 873 K. With the increasing bath temperature, the\nthickness of the adhered Zn-Ti layer gradually decreased from 52 to 32\nmicrometers, while the thickness of the outer TiO2 layer gradually increased\nfrom 24 to 69 nm. Due to small Al contamination of the Zn bath, a thin (around\n2 nm) alumina-rich layer is found between the outer TiO2 layer and the inner\nmacroscopic Zn layer. It is proven that the color change was governed by the\nformation of thin outer TiO2 layer; different colors appear depending on the\nthickness of this layer, mostly due to the destructive interference of visible\nlight on this transparent nano-layer. A complex model was built to explain the\nresults using known relationships of chemical thermodynamics, adhesion, heat\nflow, kinetics of chemical reactions, diffusion, and optics.\n", "  The near-surface environment is often too complex to enable inference of\nhydrological and environmental variables using one geophysical data type alone.\nJoint inversion and coupled inverse modeling involving numerical flow- and\ntransport simulators have, in the last decade, played important roles in\npushing applications towards increasingly challenging targets. Joint inversion\nof geophysical data that is based on structural constraints is often favored\nover model coupling based on explicit petrophysical relationships. More\nspecifically, cross-gradient joint inversion has been applied to a wide range\nof near-surface applications and geophysical data types. To infer hydrological\nsubsurface properties, the most appropriate approach is often to use temporal\nchanges in geophysical data that can be related to hydrological state\nvariables. This allows using geophysical data as indirect hydrological\nobservables, while the coupling with a flow- and transport simulator ensures\nphysical consistency. Future research avenues include investigating the\nvalidity of different coupling strategies at various scales, the spatial\nstatistics of near-surface petrophysical relationships, the influence of the\nmodel conceptualization, fully probabilistic joint inversions, and how to\ninclude complex prior information in the joint inversion.\n", "  Geophysical methods offer several key advantages over conventional subsurface\nmeasurement approaches, yet their use for hydrologic interpretation is often\nproblematic. Here, we introduce theory and concepts of a novel Bayesian\napproach for high-resolution soil moisture estimation using traveltime\nobservations from crosshole Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) experiments. The\nrecently developed Multi-try DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis with\nsampling from past states, MT-DREAM(ZS) is being used to infer, as closely and\nconsistently as possible, the posterior distribution of spatially distributed\nvadose zone soil moisture and/or porosity under saturated conditions. Two\ndiffering and opposing model parameterization schemes are being considered, one\ninvolving a classical uniform grid discretization and the other based on a\ndiscrete cosine transformation (DCT). We illustrate our approach using two\ndifferent case studies involving geophysical data from a synthetic water tracer\ninfiltration study and a real-world field study under saturated conditions. Our\nresults demonstrate that the DCT parameterization yields the most accurate\nestimates of distributed soil moisture for a large range of spatial\nresolutions, and superior MCMC convergence rates. In addition, DCT is admirably\nsuited to investigate and quantify the effects of model truncation errors on\nthe MT-DREAM(ZS) inversion results. For the field example, lateral anisotropy\nneeds to be enforced to derive reliable soil moisture variability. Our results\nalso demonstrate that the posterior soil moisture uncertainty derived with the\nproposed Bayesian procedure is significantly larger than its counterpart\nestimated from classical smoothness-constrained deterministic inversions.\n", "  A spectroscopic study of Rydberg states of helium ($n$ = 30 and 45) in\nmagnetic, electric and combined magnetic and electric fields with arbitrary\nrelative orientations of the field vectors is presented. The emphasis is on two\nspecial cases where (i) the diamagnetic term is negligible and both\nparamagnetic Zeeman and Stark effects are linear ($n$ = 30, $B \\leq$ 120 mT and\n$F$ = 0 - 78 V/cm ), and (ii) the diamagnetic term is dominant and the Stark\neffect is linear ($n$ = 45, $B$ = 277 mT and $F$ = 0 - 8 V/cm). Both cases\ncorrespond to regimes where the interactions induced by the electric and\nmagnetic fields are much weaker than the Coulomb interaction, but much stronger\nthan the spin-orbit interaction. The experimental spectra are compared to\nspectra calculated by determining the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix\ndescribing helium Rydberg states in the external fields. The spectra and the\ncalculated energy-level diagrams in external fields reveal avoided crossings\nbetween levels of different $m_l$ values and pronounced $m_l$-mixing effects at\nall angles between the electric and magnetic field vectors other than 0. These\nobservations are discussed in the context of the development of a method to\ngenerate dense samples of cold atoms and molecules in a magnetic trap following\nRydberg-Stark deceleration.\n", "  We present a scheme for nanoscopic imaging of a quantum mechanical two-level\nsystem using an optical probe in the far-field. Existing super-resolution\nschemes require more than two-levels and depend on an incoherent response to\nthe lasers. Here, quantum control of the two states proceeds via rapid\nadiabatic passage. We implement this scheme on an array of semiconductor\nself-assembled quantum dots. Each quantum dot results in a bright spot in the\nimage with extents down to 30 nm ({\\lambda}/31). Rapid adiabatic passage is\nestablished as a versatile tool in the super-resolution toolbox.\n", "  Experiments have revealed a nontrivial cancer-inhibiting capability of liquid\nmedia treated by the plasma jet capable of forming thinly stratified\nself-organized patterns at a plasma-liquid interface. A pronounced cancer\ndepressing activity towards at least two kinds of human cancer cells, namely\nbreast cancer MDA-MB-231 and human glioblastoma U87 cancer lines, was\ndemonstrated. After a short treatment at the thinly stratified self-organized\nplasma-liquid interface pattern, the cancer inhibiting media demonstrate well\npronounced depression and apoptosis activities towards tumor cells, not\nachievable without interfacial stratification of plasma jet to thin (of several\num) current filaments, which therefore play a pivotal (yet still not completely\nclear) role in building up the cancer inhibition properties. Moreover, thinly\nstratified, self-organized interfacial discharge is capable to efficiently\ncontrol the ROS and RNS concentrations in the cancer-inhibiting media, and in\nparticular, abnormal ROS/RNS ratios not achievable in discharges which do not\nform stratified thin-filament patterns could be obtained. These results were\nexplained in terms of interaction of thin plasma filaments of the\nself-organized pattern with gas and liquid, where the unusual interaction\nconditions (i.e., high surface-to-volume ratios etc.) cause accumulation of\nROS, RNS and other species in unusual ratios and concentrations, thus forming\npotentially efficient anti-cancer cocktail. Our funding could be extremely\nimportant for handling the cancer proliferation problem, and hence, it should\nbe brought to light to attract due attention of the researchers and explore the\npossible potential of this approach in tackling the challenging problem of high\ncancer-induced mortality and rising morbidity trends.\n", "  Most of the vibrating mechanisms of optofluidicsystems are based on local\nheating of membranes that in-duces liquid flow. We report here a new type of\ndiaphragmpump in a liquid film based on the optical radiation pres-sure force.\nWe modulate a low power laser that gener-ates, at resonance, a symmetric\nvibration of a free standingsoap film. The film lifetime strongly varies from\n56 s at lowpower (2 mW) to 2 s at higher power (70 mW). Since thelaser beam\nonly acts mechanically on the interfaces, sucha pump could be easily\nimplemented on delicate micro-equipment on chips or in biological systems.\n", "  The ultimate goal of exoplanetologists is to discover life outside our Earth\nand to fully understand our place in the Universe. Even though we have never\nbeen closer to attaining this goal, we still need to understand how and where\nthe planets (efficiently) form. In this manuscript I briefly discuss the\nimportant role of stellar metallicity and chemistry on the formation and\nevolution of exoplanets.\n", "  We study the trion and biexciton in transition metal dichalcogenides\nmonolayers within the framework of a nonrelativistic potential model using the\nmethod of hyperspherical harmonics (HH). We solve the three- and four-body\nSchr\\\"odinger equations with the Keldysh potential by expanding the wave\nfunctions of a trion and biexciton in terms of the antisymmetrized HH. Results\nof the calculations for the ground state energies are in good agreement with\nsimilar calculations for the Keldysh potential and in reasonable agreement with\nexperimental measurements of trion and biexciton binding energies.\n", "  In this work, we show the flux tubes of the quark-antiquark and quark-quark\nat finite temperature for SU(3) Lattice QCD. The chromomagnetic and\nchromoelectric fields are calculated above and below the phase transition.\n", "  We present an extensive study of the MSSM parameter space allowing for\ngeneral generation mixing in the squark sector. Employing an MCMC algorithm, we\nestablish the parameter ranges which are allowed with respect to various\nexperimental and theoretical constraints. Based on this analysis, we propose\nbenchmark scenarios for future studies. Moreover, we discuss aspects of\nsignatures at the LHC.\n", "  Verstraelen et al. (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 12 (2016) 3894-3912) recently\nintroduced a new method for partitioning the electron density of a material\ninto constituent atoms. Their approach falls within the class of atomic\npopulation analysis methods called stockholder charge partitioning methods in\nwhich a material electron distribution is divided into overlapping atoms. The\nMinimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method proposed by Verstraelen et\nal. composes the pro-atom density as a sum of exponential functions, where the\nnumber of exponential functions equals that element's row in the Periodic\nTable. Specifically, one exponential function is used for H and He, two for Li\nthrough Ne, three for Na through Ar, etc. In the MBIS method, the exponential\nfunctions parameters defining the pro-atom density are optimized in a\nself-consistent iterative procedure. Close examination reveals some important\nanomalies in the article by Verstaelen et al. The purpose of this comment\narticle is to bring these important issues to readers' attention and to start a\ndiscussion of them.\n", "  In this manuscript, we demonstrate the ability of nonlinear light-atom\ninteractions to produce tunably non-Gaussian, partially self-healing optical\nmodes. Gaussian spatial-mode light tuned near to the atomic resonances in hot\nrubidium vapor is shown to result in non-Gaussian output mode structures that\nmay be controlled by varying either the input beam power or the temperature of\nthe atomic vapor. We show that the output modes exhibit a degree of\nself-reconstruction after encountering an obstruction in the beam path. The\nresultant modes are similar to truncated Bessel-Gauss modes that exhibit the\nability to self-reconstruct earlier upon propagation than Gaussian modes. The\nability to generate tunable, self-reconstructing beams has potential\napplications to a variety of imaging and communication scenarios.\n"]}
