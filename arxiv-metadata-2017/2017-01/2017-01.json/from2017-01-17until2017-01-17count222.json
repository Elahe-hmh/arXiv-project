Dimension-six\nterms have been enumerated in the classical article by Buchmueller and Wyler\n[3]. Although redundance of some of those operators has been already noted in\nthe literature, no updated complete list has been published to date. Here we\nperform their classification once again from the outset. Assuming baryon number\nconservation, we find 15 + 19 + 25 = 59 independent operators (barring flavour\nstructure and Hermitian conjugations), as compared to 16 + 35 + 29 = 80 in\nRef.[3]. The three summed numbers refer to operators containing 0, 2 and 4\nfermion fields. If the assumption of baryon number conservation is relaxed, 4\nnew operators arise in the four-fermion sector.\n", "  The possibility of avoiding the big bang singularity by means of a\ngeneralized uncertainty principle is investigated. In relation with this\nmatter, the statistical mechanics of a free-particle system obeying the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle is studied and it is shown that the entropy\nof the system has a finite value in the infinite temperature limit. It is then\nargued that negative temperatures and negative pressures are possible in this\nsystem. Finally, it is shown that this model can remove the big bang\nsingularity.\n", "  We consider families of non-self-adjoint perturbations of self-adjoint\nharmonic and anharmonic oscillators. The norms of spectral projections of these\noperators are found to grow at intermediate rates from arbitrarily slowly to\nexponentially rapidly.\n", "  We present a graded-geometric approach to modular classes of Lie algebroids\nand their generalizations, introducing in this setting an idea of relative\nmodular class of a Dirac structure for a certain type of Courant algebroids,\ncalled projectable. This novel approach puts several concepts related to\nPoisson geometry and its generalizations in a new light and simplifies proofs.\nIt gives, in particular, a nice geometric interpretation of modular classes of\ntwisted-Poisson structures on Lie algebroids.\n", "  Behavior of Andreev gap states in a quantum dot with Coulomb repulsion\nsymmetrically attached to superconducting leads is studied via the perturbation\nexpansion in the interaction strength. We find the exact asymptotic form of the\nspin-symmetric solution for the Andreev states continuously approaching the\nFermi level. We thereby derive a critical interaction at which the Andreev\nstates at zero temperature merge at the Fermi energy, being the upper bound for\nthe $0-\\pi$ transition. We show that the spin-symmetric solution becomes\ndegenerate beyond this interaction, in the $\\pi$ phase, and the Andreev states\ndo not split unless the degeneracy is lifted. We further demonstrate that the\ndegeneracy of the spin-symmetric state extends also into the $0$ phase in which\nthe solutions with zero and non-zero frequencies of the Andreev states may\ncoexist.\n", "  The Lagrangian description of mechanical systems and the Legendre\nTransformation (considered as a passage from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian\nformulation of the dynamics) for point-like objects, for which the\ninfinitesimal configuration space is TM, is based on the existence of canonical\nsymplectic isomorphisms of double vector bundles T*TM, T*TM, and TT*M. We show\nthat there exist an analogous picture in the dynamics of objects for which the\nconfiguration space is the vector bundle of n-vectors, if we make use of\ncertain graded bundle structures of degree n, i.e. objects generalizing vector\nbundles (for which n=1). For instance, the role of TT*M is played in our\napproach by the vector bundle of n-vectors on the bundle of n-covectors, which\nis canonically a graded bundle of degree n over the bundle of n-vectors.\nDynamics of strings and the Plateau problem in statics are particular cases of\nthis framework.\n", "  We investigate how to experimentally detect a recently proposed measure to\nquantify macroscopic quantum superpositions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 220401\n(2011)], namely, \"macroscopic quantumness\" $\\mathcal{I}$. Schemes based on\noverlap measurements for harmonic oscillator states and for qubit states are\nextensively investigated. Effects of detection inefficiency and coarse-graining\nare analyzed in order to assess feasibility of the schemes.\n", "  Despite tremendous advances in the fundamentals and applications of cavity\nquantum electrodynamics (CQED), investigations in this field have primarily\nbeen limited to optical cavities composed of purely dielectric materials. Here,\nwe demonstrate a hybrid metal-dielectric nanocavity design and realize it in\nthe InAs/GaAs quantum photonics platform utilizing angled rotational metal\nevaporation. Key features of our nanometallic light-matter interface include:\n(i) order of magnitude reduction in mode volume compared to that of leading\nphotonic crystal CQED systems; (ii) surface-emitting nanoscale cylindrical\ngeometry and therefore good collection efficiency; and finally (iii) strong and\nbroadband spontaneous emission rate enhancement (Purcell factor ~ 8) of single\nphotons. This light-matter interface may play an important role in quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  The sub-volume scaling of the entanglement entropy with the system's size,\n$n$, has been a subject of vigorous study in the last decade [1]. The area law\nprovably holds for gapped one dimensional systems [2] and it was believed to be\nviolated by at most a factor of $\\log\\left(n\\right)$ in physically reasonable\nmodels such as critical systems.\n  In this paper, we generalize the spin$-1$ model of Bravyi et al [3] to all\ninteger spin-$s$ chains, whereby we introduce a class of exactly solvable\nmodels that are physical and exhibit signatures of criticality, yet violate the\narea law by a power law. The proposed Hamiltonian is local and translationally\ninvariant in the bulk. We prove that it is frustration free and has a unique\nground state. Moreover, we prove that the energy gap scales as $n^{-c}$, where\nusing the theory of Brownian excursions, we prove $c\\ge2$. This rules out the\npossibility of these models being described by a conformal field theory. We\nanalytically show that the Schmidt rank grows exponentially with $n$ and that\nthe half-chain entanglement entropy to the leading order scales as $\\sqrt{n}$\n(Eq. 16). Geometrically, the ground state is seen as a uniform superposition of\nall $s-$colored Motzkin walks. Lastly, we introduce an external field which\nallows us to remove the boundary terms yet retain the desired properties of the\nmodel. Our techniques for obtaining the asymptotic form of the entanglement\nentropy, the gap upper bound and the self-contained expositions of the\ncombinatorial techniques, more akin to lattice paths, may be of independent\ninterest.\n", "  For a smooth manifold $M$, it was shown in \\cite{BPH} that every affine\nconnection on the tangent bundle $TM$ naturally gives rise to covariant\ndifferentiation of multivector fields (MVFs) and differential forms along MVFs.\nIn this paper, we generalize the covariant derivative of \\cite{BPH} and\nconstruct covariant derivatives along MVFs which are not induced by affine\nconnections on $TM$. We call this more general class of covariant derivatives\n\\textit{higher affine connections}. In addition, we also propose a framework\nwhich gives rise to non-induced higher connections; this framework is obtained\nby equipping the full exterior bundle $\\wedge^\\bullet TM$ with an associative\nbilinear form $\\eta$. Since the latter can be shown to be equivalent to a set\nof differential forms of various degrees, this framework also provides a link\nbetween higher connections and multisymplectic geometry.\n", "  We investigate the unextendible maximally entangled bases in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$ and present a $30$-number UMEB\nconstruction in $\\mathbb{C}^{6}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{6}$. For higher\ndimensional case, we show that for a given $N$-number UMEB in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$, there is a $\\widetilde{N}$-number,\n$\\widetilde{N}=(qd)^2-(d^2-N)$, UMEB in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{qd}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{qd}$ for any $q\\in\\mathbb{N}$. As an\nexample, for $\\mathbb{C}^{12n}\\bigotimes\\mathbb{C}^{12n}$ systems, we show that\nthere are at least two sets of UMEBs which are not equivalent.\n", "  We develop and test an automated technique to model the dynamics of\ninteracting galaxy pairs. We use Identikit (Barnes & Hibbard 2009, Barnes 2011)\nas a tool for modeling and matching the morphology and kinematics of the\ninteracting pairs of equal-mass galaxies. In order to reduce the effect of\nsubjective human judgement, we automate the selection of phase-space regions\nused to match simulations to data, and we explore how selection of these\nregions affects the random uncertainties of parameters in the best-fit model.\nIn this work, we use an independent set of GADGET SPH simulations as input data\nto determine the systematic bias in the measured encounter parameters based on\nthe known initial conditions of these simulations. We test both cold gas and\nyoung stellar components in the GADGET simulations to explore the effect of\nchoosing HI vs. H$\\alpha$ as the line of sight velocity tracer. We find that we\ncan group the results into tests with good, fair, and poor convergence based on\nthe distribution of parameters of models close to the best-fit model. For tests\nwith good and fair convergence, we rule out large fractions of parameter space\nand recover merger stage, eccentricity, pericentric distance, viewing angle,\nand initial disc orientations within 3$\\sigma$ of the correct value. All of\ntests on prograde-prograde systems have either good or fair convergence. The\nresults of tests on edge-on discs are less biased than face-on tests.\nRetrograde and polar systems do not converge and may require constraints from\nregions other than the tidal tails and bridges.\n", "  In natural SUSY models higgsinos are always light because \\mu^2 cannot be\nmuch larger than M_Z^2, while squarks and gluinos may be very heavy. Unless\ngluinos are discovered at LHC13, the commonly assumed unification of gaugino\nmass parameters will imply correspondingly heavy winos and binos, resulting in\na higgsino-like LSP and small inter-higgsino mass splittings. The small visible\nenergy release in higgsino decays makes their pair production difficult to\ndetect at the LHC. Relaxing gaugino mass universality allows for relatively\nlight winos and binos without violating LHC gluino mass bounds and without\naffecting naturalness. In the case where the bino mass M_1<~ \\mu, then one\nobtains a mixed bino-higgsino LSP with instead sizable w_1-z_1 and z_2-z_1 mass\ngaps. The thermal neutralino abundance can match the measured dark matter\ndensity in contrast to models with a higgsino-like LSP where WIMPs (weakly\ninteracting massive particles) are underproduced by factors of 10-15. If\ninstead M_2<~ \\mu, then one obtains a mixed wino-higgsino LSP with large\nz_2-z_1 but small w_1-z_1 mass gaps with still an under-abundance of\nthermally-produced WIMPs. Portions of the light wino parameter space may\nalready be excluded by the IceCube upper bound on the spin-dependent\nneutralino-nucleon cross section. We discuss dark matter detection in other\ndirect and indirect detection experiments and caution that the bounds from\nthese must be interpreted with care. Finally, we show that LHC13 experiments\nshould be able to probe these non-universal mass scenarios via a variety of\nchannels including multi-lepton + etmiss events, WZ+etmiss events, Wh+etmiss\nevents and W^\\pm W^\\pm +etmiss events from electroweak chargino and neutralino\nproduction.\n", "  Crook's Fluctuation Theorem and Jarzynski equality are immensely powerful\ntools in obtaining equilibrium properties through non-equilibrium transition\nbetween two equilibrium states. In this letter, we propose an extension to the\nCrook's fluctuation theorem for transition between two non-equilibrium steady\nstates (NESS). Using the proposed theorem, we show that it is possible to\nobtain free energy differences of multiple equilibrium states from a single set\nof data obtained from the transition between two NESS. The results are verified\nusing numerical simulations by employing Nose-Hoover dynamics and a single\ndimensional $\\phi^4$ chain. The equations are cast in a manner that makes it\npossible to do experimental verification. The proposed method can provide\nfree-energy difference for a range of temperature, and consequently is much\nfaster than either the Jarzynski equality or the Crooks's fluctuation theorem.\n", "  The unbounded center of mass (CM) energy of oppositely moving colliding\nparticles near horizon emerge also in 1+1- dimensional Horava-Lifshitz gravity.\nThis theory has imprints of renormalizable quantum gravity characteristics in\naccordance with the method of simple power counting. Surpris- ingly the result\nobtained is not valid for a 1- dimensional Compton- like process between an\noutgoing photon and an infalling massless/ massive particle. It is possible to\nachieve unbounded CM energy due to collision between infalling photons and\nparticles. The source of outgoing particles may be at- tributed to an explosive\nprocess just outside the horizon for a black hole and the naturally repulsive\ncharacter for the case of a naked singularity. It is found that absence of\nangular momenta in 1+1- dimensions does not yield unbounded energy for\ncollisions in the vicinity of naked singularities.\n", "  We introduce the anisotropic two-photon Rabi model in which the rotating and\ncounter rotating terms enters along with two different coupling constants.\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors are studied with exact means. We employ a\nvariation of the Braak method based on Bogolubov rotation of the underlying\n$su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. Accordingly, the spectrum is provided by the analytical\nproperties of a suitable meromorphic function. Our formalism applies to the\ntwo-modes Rabi model as well, sharing the same algebraic structure of the\ntwo-photon model. Through the analysis of the spectrum, we discover that the\nmodel displays close analogies to many-body systems undergoing quantum phase\ntransitions.\n", "  We scrutinize the diagrammatic perturbation theory of noninteracting\nelectrons in a random potential with the aim to accomplish a consistent\ncomprehensive theory of quantum diffusion. Ward identity between the\none-electron self-energy and the two-particle irreducible vertex is generally\nnot guaranteed in the perturbation theory with only elastic scatterings. We\nshow how the Ward identity can be established in practical approximations and\nhow the functions from the perturbation expansion should be used to obtain a\nfully consistent conserving theory. We derive the low-energy asymptotics of the\nconserving full two-particle vertex from which we find an exact representation\nof the diffusion pole and of the static diffusion constant in terms of Green\nfunctions of the perturbation expansion. We illustrate the construction on the\nleading vertex corrections to the mean-field diffusion due to maximally-crossed\ndiagrams responsible for weak localization.\n", "  We estimate the rate of dark matter scattering in collapsed structures\nthroughout the history of the Universe. If the scattering cross-section is\nvelocity-independent, then the canonical picture is correct that scatterings\noccur mainly at late times. The scattering rate peaks slightly at redshift z~6,\nand remains significant today. Half the scatterings occur after z~1, in\nstructures more massive than 10^12 M_sun. Within a factor of two, these numbers\nare robust to changes in the assumed astrophysics, and the scatterings would be\ncaptured in cosmological simulations. However, for particle physics models with\na velocity-dependent cross-section (as for Yukawa potential interactions via a\nmassive mediator), the scattering rate peaks before z~20, in objects with mass\nless than 10^4 M_sun. These precise values are sensitive to the\nredshift-dependent mass-concentration relation and the small-scale cutoff in\nthe matter power spectrum. In extreme cases, the qualitative effect of early\ninteractions may be reminiscent of warm dark matter and strongly affect the\nsubsequent growth of structure. However, these scatterings are being missed in\nexisting cosmological simulations with limited mass resolution.\n", "  With the rise of Wikipedia as a first-stop source for scientific knowledge,\nit is important to compare its representation of that knowledge to that of the\nacademic literature. Here we identify the 250 most heavily used journals in\neach of 26 research fields (4,721 journals, 19.4M articles in total) indexed by\nthe Scopus database, and test whether topic, academic status, and accessibility\nmake articles from these journals more or less likely to be referenced on\nWikipedia. We find that a journal's academic status (impact factor) and\naccessibility (open access policy) both strongly increase the probability of it\nbeing referenced on Wikipedia. Controlling for field and impact factor, the\nodds that an open access journal is referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47%\nhigher compared to paywall journals. One of the implications of this study is\nthat a major consequence of open access policies is to significantly amplify\nthe diffusion of science, through an intermediary like Wikipedia, to a broad\naudience.\n", "  In a setting of noncommutative space with minimal length we confirm the\ngeneral assertion that the more nonclassical an input state for a beam splitter\nis, the more entangled its output state becomes. By analysing various\nnonclassical properties we find that the odd Schr\\\"odinger cat states are more\nnonclassical than the even Schr\\\"odinger cat states, hence producing more\nentanglement, which in turn are more nonclassical than coherent states. Both\nthe nonclassicality and the entanglement can be enhanced by increasing the\nnoncommutativity of the underlying space. In addition we find as a by-product\nsome rare explicit minimum uncertainty quadrature and number squeezed states,\ni.e. ideal squeezed states.\n", "  We consider an important class of self-assembly problems and using the\nformalism of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive a set of design principles\nfor growing controlled assemblies far from equilibrium. The design principles\nconstrain the set of structures that can be obtained under non-equilibrium\nconditions. Our central result provides intuition for how equilibrium\nself-assembly landscapes are modified under finite non-equilibrium drive.\n", "  We study the relationship between initial data sets with horizons and the\nexistence of metrics of positive scalar curvature. We define a Cauchy Domain of\nOuter Communications (CDOC) to be an asymptotically flat initial set $(M, g,\nK)$ such that the boundary $\\partial M$ of $M$ is a collection of Marginally\nOuter (or Inner) Trapped Surfaces (MOTSs and/or MITSs) and such that\n$M\\setminus \\partial M$ contains no MOTSs or MITSs. This definition is meant to\ncapture, on the level of the initial data sets, the well known notion of the\ndomain of outer communications (DOC) as the region of spacetime outside of all\nthe black holes (and white holes). Our main theorem establishes that in\ndimensions $3\\leq n \\leq 7$, a CDOC which satisfies the dominant energy\ncondition and has a strictly stable boundary has a positive scalar curvature\nmetric which smoothly compactifies the asymptotically flat end and is a\nRiemannian product metric near the boundary where the cross sectional metric is\nconformal to a small perturbation of the initial metric on the boundary\n$\\partial M$ induced by $g$. This result may be viewed as a generalization of\nGalloway and Schoen's higher dimensional black hole topology theorem\n\\cite{GS06} to the exterior of the horizon. We also show how this result leads\nto a number of topological restrictions on the CDOC, which allows one to also\nview this as an extension of the initial data topological censorship theorem,\nestablished in \\cite{EGP13} in dimension $n=3$, to higher dimensions.\n", "  We prove that the corona product of two graphs has no Laplacian perfect state\ntransfer whenever the first graph has at least two vertices. This complements a\nresult of Coutinho and Liu who showed that no tree of size greater than two has\nLaplacian perfect state transfer. In contrast, we prove that the corona product\nof two graphs exhibits Laplacian pretty good state transfer, under some mild\nconditions. This provides the first known examples of families of graphs with\nLaplacian pretty good state transfer. Our result extends of the work of Fan and\nGodsil on double stars to the Laplacian setting. Moreover, we also show that\nthe corona product of any cocktail party graph with a single vertex graph has\nLaplacian pretty good state transfer, even though odd cocktail party graphs\nhave no perfect state transfer.\n", "  Time reversal (T) invariant topological insulator is widely recognized as one\nof the fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics, for which the most\nfascinating hallmark is perhaps a spin based topological protection, the total\ncancellation of scattering of conduction electrons with certain spins on matter\nsurface. Recently, it has created a paradigm shift for topological insulators,\nfrom electronics to photonics, phononics as well as mechanics, bringing about\nnot only involved new physics but also potential applications in robust wave\ntransport. Despite the growing interests in realizing topologically protected\nacoustic wave transport, T-invariant acoustic topological insulator has not yet\nbeen achieved. Here, we report the first demonstration of acoustic topological\ninsulator: a strongly coupled metamaterial ring lattice that supports one-way\npropagation of helical edge states under T-symmetry, backscattering immune to\nboundary abrupt variations. The very unique thing is the formation of\nspin-filtered interface states due to lattice dislocations. The mechanism\nunderlying the formation of topologically protected edge states and interface\nstates is applicable in various other wave systems or higher dimensions.\n", "  We present a microscopic study on the impact of doping on the carrier\ndynamics in graphene, in particular focusing on its influence on the\ntechnologically relevant carrier multiplication in realistic, doped graphene\nsamples. Treating the time- and momentum-resolved carrier-light,\ncarrier-carrier, and carrier-phonon interactions on the same microscopic\nfooting, the appearance of Auger-induced carrier multiplication up to a Fermi\nlevel of 300 meV is revealed. Furthermore, we show that doping favors the\nso-called hot carrier multiplication occurring within one band. Our results are\ndirectly compared to recent time-resolved ARPES measurements and exhibit an\nexcellent agreement on the temporal evolution of the hot carrier multiplication\nfor n- and p-doped graphene. The gained insights shed light on the ultrafast\ncarrier dynamics in realistic, doped graphene samples\n", "  Through the past decade the field of network science has established itself\nas a common ground for the cross-fertilization of exciting inter-disciplinary\nstudies which has motivated researchers to model almost every physical system\nas an interacting network consisting of nodes and links. Although public\ntransport networks such as airline and railway networks have been extensively\nstudied, the status of bus networks still remains in obscurity. In developing\ncountries like India, where bus networks play an important role in day-to-day\ncommutation, it is of significant interest to analyze its topological structure\nand answer some of the basic questions on its evolution, growth, robustness and\nresiliency. In this paper, we model the bus networks of major Indian cities as\ngraphs in \\textit{L}-space, and evaluate their various statistical properties\nusing concepts from network science. Our analysis reveals a wide spectrum of\nnetwork topology with the common underlying feature of small-world property. We\nobserve that the networks although, robust and resilient to random attacks are\nparticularly degree-sensitive. Unlike real-world networks, like Internet, WWW\nand airline, which are virtual, bus networks are physically constrained. The\npresence of various geographical and economic constraints allow these networks\nto evolve over time. Our findings therefore, throw light on the evolution of\nsuch geographically and socio-economically constrained networks which will help\nus in designing more efficient networks in the future.\n", "  We show that there exists a natural Tulczyjew triple in the dynamics of\nobjects for which the standard kinematic configuration space $TM$, i.e. the\ntangent bundle, is replaced with its $n$-th exterior power, i.e. the bundle of\ntangent $n$-vectors. In this framework, which is fully covariant, we\ngeometrically derive phase equations, as well as Euler-Lagrange equations,\nincluding nonholonomic constraints into the picture. Dynamics of strings and a\nconstrained Plateau problem in statics are particular cases of this framework.\n", "  We review the concept of a graded bundle, which is a generalisation of a\nvector bundle, its linearisation, and a double structure of this kind. We then\npresent applications of these structures in geometric mechanics including\nsystems with higher order Lagrangian and the Plateau problem.\n", "  By performing large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations,\nwe investigate a one-dimensional correlated bosonic lattice model with a\nsynthetic spin-orbit coupling realized in recent experiments. In the insulating\nregime, this model exhibits a symmetry-protected topological phase. This\nsymmetry-protected topological phase is stabilized by time-reversal symmetry\nand it is identified as a Haldane phase. We confirm our conclusions further by\nanalyzing the entanglement spectrum. In addition, we find four conventional\nphases: a Mott insulating phase with no long range order, a ferromagnetic\nsuperfluid phase, a ferromagnetic insulating phase and a density-wave phase.\n", "  In this work we study the Hubbard model on a bi-partite lattice using the\ncoupled-cluster method (CCM). We first investigate what, within this approach,\nallows us to reproduce the zero order parameter in the 1D model, as predicted\nby the exact solution. We show that we need a critical correlation in some of\nthe coupled-cluster model coefficients to reproduce this result, as can be\nobtained by applying some very accurate results using the CCM for the\nHeisenberg model. Using the same approach we then tackle the 2D Hubbard model\non a square and a honeycomb lattice, both of which can be thought to represent\n2D materials. We also analyse the charge and spin excitations, with reasonable\nresults.\n", "  We study quantum teleportation between two different types of optical qubits\nusing hybrid entanglement as a quantum channel under decoherence effects. One\ntype of qubit employs the vacuum and single photon states for the basis, called\na single-rail single-photon qubit, and the other utilizes coherent states of\nopposite phases. We find that teleportation from a single-rail single-photon\nqubit to a coherent state qubit is better than the opposite direction in terms\nof fidelity and success probability. We compare our results with those using a\ndifferent type of hybrid entanglement between a polarized single-photon qubit\nand a coherent state.\n", "  We suggest and investigate a scheme for non-deterministic noiseless linear\namplification of coherent states using successive photon addition, $(\\hat\na^{\\dagger})^2$, where $\\hat a^\\dagger$ is the photon creation operator. We\ncompare it with a previous proposal using the photon addition-then-subtraction,\n$\\hat a \\hat a^\\dagger$, where $\\hat a$ is the photon annihilation operator,\nthat works as an appropriate amplifier only for weak light fields. We show that\nwhen the amplitude of a coherent state is $|\\alpha| \\gtrsim 0.91$, the $(\\hat\na^{\\dagger})^2$ operation serves as a more efficient amplifier compared to the\n$\\hat a \\hat a^\\dagger$ operation in terms of equivalent input noise. Using\n$\\hat a \\hat a^\\dagger$ and $(\\hat a^{\\dagger})^2$ as basic building blocks, we\ncompare combinatorial amplifications of coherent states using $(\\hat a \\hat\na^\\dagger)^2$, $\\hat a^{\\dagger 4}$, $\\hat a \\hat a^\\dagger\\hat a^{\\dagger 2}$,\nand $\\hat a^{\\dagger 2}\\hat a \\hat a^\\dagger$, and show that $(\\hat a \\hat\na^\\dagger)^2$, $\\hat a^{\\dagger 2}\\hat a \\hat a^\\dagger$, and $\\hat a^{\\dagger\n4}$ exhibit strongest noiseless properties for $|\\alpha| \\lesssim 0.51$, $0.51\n\\lesssim |\\alpha| \\lesssim 1.05 $, and $|\\alpha|\\gtrsim 1.05 $, respectively.\nWe further show that the $(\\hat a^{\\dagger})^2$ operation can be used for\namplifying superpositions of the coherent states. In contrast to previous\nstudies, our work provides efficient schemes to implement a noiseless amplifier\nfor light fields with medium and large amplitudes.\n", "  We investigate the properties of a real scalar field in the Finslerian\nRanders spacetime, where the local Lorentz violation is driven by a geometrical\nbackground vector. We propose a dynamics for the scalar field by a minimal\ncoupling of the scalar field and the Finsler metric. The coupling is\nintrinsically defined on the Randers spacetime, and it leads to a non-canonical\nkinetic term for the scalar field. The nonlinear dynamics can be split into a\nlinear and nonlinear regimes, which depend perturbatively on the even and odd\npowers of the Lorentz-violating parameter, respectively. We analyze the\nplane-waves solutions and the modified dispersion relations, and it turns out\nthat the spectrum is free of tachyons up to second-order.\n", "  We investigate the effect of order parameter fluctuations in the holographic\nsuperconductor. In particular, using a fully backreacted bulk geometry, the\nintrinsic spectral functions of the order parameter in both the normal and the\nsuperconducting phase are computed. We also present a vector-like large-$N$\nversion of the Ginzburg-Landau model that accurately describes our\nlong-wavelength results in both phases. The large-$N$ limit of the latter model\nexplains why the Higgs mode and the second-sound mode are not present in the\nspectral functions. Our results indicate that the holographic superconductor\ndescribes a relativistic multi-component superfluid in the universal regime of\nthe BEC-BCS crossover.\n", "  I explore the use of quantum information as a security enabler for the future\ndriverless vehicle. Specifically, I investigate the role combined classical and\nquantum information can have on the most important characteristic of the\ndriverless vehicle paradigm - the vehicle location. By using\ninformation-theoretic verification frameworks, coupled with emerging\nquantum-based location-verification procedures, I show how vehicle positions\ncan be authenticated with a probability of error simply not attainable in\nclassical-only networks. I also discuss how other quantum applications can be\nseamlessly encapsulated within the same vehicular communication infrastructure\nrequired for location verification. The two technology enablers required for\nthe driverless quantum vehicle are an increase in current quantum memory\ntimescales (likely) and wide-scale deployment of classical vehicular\ncommunication infrastructure (underway). I argue the enhanced safety features\ndelivered by the `Quantum Car' mean its eventual deployment is inevitable.\n", "  It has been shown recently that relativistic distortions generate a dipolar\nmodulation in the two-point correlation function of galaxies. To measure this\nrelativistic dipole it is necessary to cross-correlate different populations of\ngalaxies with for example different luminosities or colours. In this paper, we\nconstruct an optimal estimator to measure the dipole with multiple populations.\nWe show that this estimator increases the signal-to-noise of the dipole by up\nto 35 percent. Using 6 populations of galaxies, in a survey with halos and\nnumber densities similar to those of the millennium simulation, we forecast a\ncumulative signal-to-noise of 4.4. For the main galaxy sample of SDSS at low\nredshift z<0.2 our optimal estimator predicts a cumulative signal-to-noise of\n2.4. Finally we forecast a cumulative signal-to-noise of 7.4 in the upcoming\nDESI survey. These forecasts indicate that with the appropriate choice of\nestimator the relativistic dipole should be detectable in current and future\nsurveys.\n", "  An alternative to the Big Bang cosmologies is obtained by the Big Bounce\ncosmologies. In this paper, we study a bounce cosmology with a Type IV\nsingularity occurring at the bouncing point, in the context of $F(R)$ modified\ngravity. We investigate the evolution of the Hubble radius and we examine the\nissue of primordial cosmological perturbations in detail. As we demonstrate,\nfor the singular bounce, the primordial perturbations originating from the\ncosmological era near the bounce, do not produce a scale invariant spectrum and\nalso the short wavelength modes, after these exit the horizon, do not freeze,\nbut grow linearly with time. After presenting the cosmological perturbations\nstudy, we discuss the viability of the singular bounce model, and our results\nindicate that the singular bounce must be combined with another cosmological\nscenario, or should be modified appropriately, in order that it leads to a\nviable cosmology. The study of the slow-roll parameters leads to the same\nresult, indicating the singular bounce theory is unstable at the singularity\npoint, for certain values of the parameters. We also conformally transform the\nJordan frame singular bounce, and as we demonstrate, the Einstein frame metric\nleads to a Big Rip singularity. Therefore, the Type IV singularity in the\nJordan frame, becomes a Big Rip singularity in the Einstein frame. Finally, we\nbriefly study a generalized singular cosmological model, which contains two\nType IV singularities, with quite appealing features.\n", "  Properties of unitary time evolution of quantum systems can be applied to\ndefine quantum cryptographic protocols. Dynamics of a qubit can be exploited as\na data encryption/decryption procedure by means of timed measurements,\nimplementation of an open-loop control scheme over a qubit increases robustness\nof a protocol employing this principle.\n", "  Imaging single proteins has been a long-standing ambition for advancing\nvarious fields in natural science, as for instance structural biology,\nbiophysics and molecular nanotechnology. In particular, revealing the distinct\nconformations of an individual protein is of utmost importance. Here, we show\nthe imaging of individual proteins and protein complexes by low-energy electron\nholography. Samples of individual proteins and protein complexes on ultraclean\nfreestanding graphene were prepared by soft-landing electrospray ion beam\ndeposition, which allows chemical- and conformational-specific selection and\ngentle deposition. Low-energy electrons do not induce radiation damage, which\nenables acquiring sub-nanometer resolution images of individual proteins\n(cytochrome C and bovine serum albumin) as well as of protein complexes\n(hemoglobin), which are not the result of an averaging process.\n", "  Observations by Fermi LAT enabled us to explore the population of\nnon-recycled gamma-ray pulsars with the set of 89 objects. It was recently\nnoted that there are apparent differences in properties of radio-quiet and\nradio-loud subsets. In particular, average observed radio-loud pulsar is\nyounger than radio-quiet one and is located at smaller galactic latitude. Even\nso, the analysis based on the full list of pulsars may suffer from selection\neffects. Namely, most of radio-loud pulsars are first discovered in the\nradio-band, while radio-quiet ones are found using the gamma-ray data. In this\nwork we perform a blind search for gamma-ray pulsars using the Fermi LAT data\nalone using all point sources from 3FGL catalog as the candidates. Unlike\npreceding blind search, the present catalog is constructed with novel\nsemi-coherent method and covers the full range of characteristic ages down to 1\nkyr. The search resulted in the catalog of 40 non-recycled pulsars, 26 of which\nare radio-quiet. There are no statistically significant differences in age and\ngalactic latitude distributions for the radio-loud and radio-quiet pulsars,\nwhile the rotation period distributions are marginally different with\n$2.4\\sigma$ pre-trial statistical significance. The fraction of radio-quiet\npulsars is estimated as $\\epsilon_{RQ}=63\\pm 8\\%$. The results are in agreement\nwith the predictions of the outer magnitosphere models, while the Polar cap\nmodels are disfavored.\n", "  Smooth $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-supermanifolds have been introduced and studied\nrecently. The corresponding sign rule is given by the \"scalar product\" of the\ninvolved $\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-degrees. It exhibits interesting changes in\ncomparison with the sign rule using the parity of the total degree. With the\nnew rule, nonzero degree even coordinates are not nilpotent, and even (resp.,\nodd) coordinates do not necessarily commute (resp., anticommute) pairwise. The\nclassical Batchelor-Gawcedzki theorem says that any smooth supermanifold is\ndiffeomorphic to the \"superization\" $\\Pi E$ of a vector bundle $E$. It is also\nknown that this result fails in the complex analytic category. Hence, it is\nnatural to ask whether an analogous statement goes through in the category of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-supermanifolds with its local model made of formal power\nseries. We give a positive answer to this question.\n", "  We consider wavepackets composed of two modulated carrier Bloch waves with\nopposite group velocities in the one dimensional periodic Nonlinear\nSchroedinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation. These can be approximated by first\norder coupled mode equations (CMEs) for the two slowly varying envelopes. Under\na suitably selected periodic perturbation of the periodic structure the CMEs\npossess a spectral gap of the corresponding spatial operator and allow families\nof exponentially localized solitary waves parametrized by velocity. This leads\nto a family of approximate solitary waves in the periodic nonlinear\nSchroedinger equation. Besides a formal derivation of the CMEs a rigorous\njustification of the approximation and an error estimate in the supremum norm\nare provided. Several numerical tests corroborate the analysis.\n", "  Nonequilibrium dynamics of noninteracting bosons in a one-dimensional\nring-shaped lattice is studied by means of the Kinetic Monte Carlo method. The\nsystem is approximated by the classical XY model (the kinetic term is\nneglected) and then the simulations are performed for the planar classical\nspins. We study the dynamics that follows a finite-time quench to zero\ntemperature. If the quench is slow enough the system can equilibrate and\nfinally reaches the ground state with uniform spin alignment. However, we show\nthat if the quench is faster than the relaxation rate, the system can get\nlocked in a current-carrying metastable state characterized by a nonzero\nwinding number. We analyze how the zero-temperature state depends on the quench\nrate.\n", "  We consider a quantum theory of elastic light scattering from macroscopic\natomic sample existing in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase. Following\nto the second quantized formalism we introduce a set of coupled and closed\ndiagram equations for the polariton propagator contributing to the $T$ -matrix\nand scattering amplitude. Our approach allows to follow important density\ncorrection to the quasi-energy structure caused by static interaction and\nradiation losses associated with incoherent scattering in the case of near\nresonance excitation.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of methods to reduce statistical errors and\nexcited-state contamination in the calculation of matrix elements of quark\nbilinear operators in nucleon states. All the calculations were done on a 2+1\nflavor ensemble with lattices of size $32^3 \\times 64$ generated using the\nrational hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm at $a=0.081$~fm and with $M_\\pi=312$ MeV.\nThe statistical precision of the data is improved using the all-mode-averaging\nmethod. We compare two methods for reducing excited-state contamination: a\nvariational analysis and a two-state fit to data at multiple values of the\nsource-sink separation $t_{\\rm sep}$. We show that both methods can be tuned to\nsignificantly reduce excited-state contamination and discuss their relative\nadvantages and cost-effectiveness. A detailed analysis of the size of source\nsmearing used in the calculation of quark propagators and the range of values\nof $t_{\\rm sep}$ needed to demonstrate convergence of the isovector charges of\nthe nucleon to the $t_{\\rm sep} \\to \\infty $ estimates is presented.\n", "  We analyse solutions of the MHD equations around the electroweak transition\ntaking into account the effects of the chiral anomaly. It is shown that a\ntransition that is not of the first order has direct consequences on the\nevolution of the asymmetry between left- and right-handed leptons. Assuming an\ninitial chiral asymmetry in the symmetric phase at temperatures higher than the\ntransition temperature, as well as the existence of magnetic fields, it is\ndemonstrated that the asymmetry typically grows with time, until it undergoes a\nfast decrease at the transition, and then eventually gets damped at lower\ntemperatures in the broken phase. We argue that it is unlikely to have any\nsignificant magnetic field amplification as a consequence of the electroweak\ntransition in the Standard model, even when the chiral anomaly is introduced.\nThe presence of a chiral asymmetry between left- and right-handed charge\ncarriers naturally leads to the creation of helical magnetic fields from\nnon-helical fields and this can have consequences on their subsequent\nevolution.\n", "  A new heavy resonance may be observable at the LHC if it has a significant\ndecay branching fraction into a pair of photons. We entertain this possibility\nby looking at the modest excess in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum around\n750 GeV recently reported in the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Assuming that it is\na spinless boson, dubbed $\\tilde s$, we consider it within a model containing\ntwo weak scalar doublets having zero vacuum expectation values and a scalar\nsinglet in addition to the doublet responsible for breaking the electroweak\nsymmetry. The model also possesses three Dirac neutral singlet fermions, the\nlightest one of which can play the role of dark matter and which participate\nwith the new doublet scalars in generating light neutrino masses radiatively.\nWe show that the model is consistent with all phenomenological constraints and\ncan yield a production cross section\n$\\sigma(pp\\rightarrow\\tilde{s}\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma)$ of roughly the desired\nsize, mainly via the photon-fusion contribution, without involving extra\ncolored fermions or bosons. We also discuss other major decay modes of $\\tilde\ns$ which are potentially testable in upcoming LHC measurements.\n", "  We study the localization of the interior transmission eigenvalues (ITEs) in\nthe case when the domain is the unit ball $\\{x \\in {\\mathbb R}^d:\\: |x| \\leq\n1\\}, \\: d\\geq 2,$ and the coefficients $c_j(x), \\: j =1,2,$ and the indices of\nrefraction $n_j(x), \\: j =1,2,$ are constants near the boundary $|x| = 1$. We\nprove that in this case the eigenvalue-free region obtained in [16] for\nstrictly concave domains can be significantly improved. In particular, if\n$c_j(x), n_j(x), j = 1,2$ are constants for $|x| \\leq 1$, we show that all\n(ITEs) lie in a strip $\\{ \\lambda \\in {\\mathbb C}:\\:|{\\rm Im}\\: \\lambda| \\leq\nC\\}$.\n", "  The Unruh vacuum not admitting any outgoing flux at the horizon implies that\nthe origin of the outgoing Hawking radiation is the atmosphere of a\nnear-horizon quantum region without resort to the firewall; however, the\nexistence of the firewall of superplanckian excitations at the horizon can be\nsupported by the infinite Tolman temperature at the horizon. In an exactly\nsoluble model, we explicitly show that the firewall necessarily emerges out of\nthe Unruh vacuum so that the Tolman temperature in the Unruh vacuum is\ndivergent in essence due to the infinitely blueshifted negative ingoing flux\ncrossing the horizon rather than the outgoing flux. We also show that the\noutgoing Hawking radiation in the Unruh vacuum indeed originates from the\natmosphere, not just at the horizon, which is of no relevance to the infinite\nblueshift. Consequently, the firewall from the infinite Tolman temperature and\nthe Hawking radiation from the atmosphere turn out to be compatible, once we\nwaive the claim that the Hawking radiation in the Unruh vacuum originates from\nthe infinitely blueshifted outgoing excitations at the horizon.\n", "  Criticality in models of correlated electrons emerges in proximity of a\nlow-temperature singularity in a two-particle Green function. Such\nsingularities are generally related to a symmetry breaking of the one-particle\nself-energy. A consistent description demands that the symmetry breaking in the\nself-energy emerges at the critical point of the respective two-particle\nfunction. This cannot easily be achieved in models of correlated electrons,\nsince there are two ways connecting one- and two-electron functions that cannot\nbe made fully equivalent in approximations. We present a general construction\nof diagrammatic two-particle approximations consistent with the one-particle\nfunctions so that both produce qualitatively the same quantum critical behavior\nin thermodynamically equivalent descriptions. The general scheme is applied on\nthe single-impurity Anderson model to derive qualitatively the same Kondo\ncritical scale from the spectral function and the magnetic susceptibility.\n", "  According to a recent numerical finding, the dynamics of a glass former is\nexclusively due to the forces within the first coordination shell. This implies\nthat the Kohlrausch beta should be understandable in terms of the effective\nnearest-neighbor potential.\n  The present paper proposes a relation for the Kohlrausch beta based on the\nAdam-Gibbs conjecture of a flow barrier proportional to the number of atoms or\nmolecules in a cooperatively rearranging region. The conjecture implies that\nbeta is given by the ratio of the structural entropy increase per particle to\nthe barrier increase per particle. Making use of a recent numerical\ndetermination of the structural entropy per particle in Lennard-Jones-like\npotentials, one can show that the relation leads to values between 0.3 and 0.6.\n", "  We constructed the conformally invariant model for scalar particle creation\ninduced by strong gravitational fields. Starting from the \"usual\"\nhydrodynamical description of the particle motion written in the Eulerian\ncoordinates we substituted the particle number conservation law (which enters\nthe formalism) by \"the particle creation law\", proportional to the square of\nthe Weyl tensor (following the famous result by Ya.B.Zel`dovich and A.\nA.Starobinsky). Then, demanding the conformal invariance of the whole dynamical\nsystem, we have got both the (Weyl)-conformal gravity and the Einstein--Hilbert\ngravity action integral with dilaton field. Thus, we obtained something like\nthe induced gravity suggested first by A. D.Sakharov. It is shown that the\nresulting system is self-consistent. We considered also the vacuum equations.\nIt is shown that, beside the \"empty vacuum\", there may exist the \"dynamical\nvacuum\", which is nothing more but the Dirac sea.\n", "  Striating HTS coated conductor (CC) tapes into narrow filaments offers the\npossibility of reducing the tapes' magnetization losses without unreasonably\ndecreasing their current-carrying capability. However, realizing well-separated\nstriations presents technological challenges, especially if the number of\nfilaments is large and/or if a thick layer of metallic stabilizer is present.\nIn these situations, the filaments can be easily coupled and their\neffectiveness to reduce magnetization losses is strongly diminished or\neliminated. While the onset of coupling is well visible from magnetization loss\nmeasurements, the actual path of the coupling current is unknown. In this\ncontribution we present a systematic study of the transverse resistance in HTS\nCC samples in order to get a deeper understanding of those paths. The measured\nsamples differ in terms of manufacturer (SuperPower and SuperOx), and presence\nand thickness of stabilizer material. In addition, oxidation is used as a means\nto increase the resistance between the filaments in non-stabilized samples. The\nresults are interpreted with a chain network model. This work provides useful\ninsights on the factors determining the transverse resistance in striated HTS\nCCs, thus indicating ways to improve the effectiveness of the striation process\nfor AC loss reduction.\n", "  Probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) are used to model a variety of discrete\nspatially extended systems undergoing parallel-updating. We propose an\nembedding of a number of classical nonequilibrium concepts in the PCA-world. We\nstart from time-symmetric PCA, satisfying detailed balance, and we give their\nKubo formula for linear response. Close-to-detailed balance we investigate the\nform of the McLennan distribution and the minimum entropy production principle.\nMore generally, when time-symmetry is broken in the stationary process, there\nis a fluctuation symmetry for a corresponding entropy flux. For linear response\naround nonequilibria we also give the appropriate formula which is now not only\nentropic in nature.\n", "  We report on the switching current distributions in nano-hybrid Josephson\njunctions made of InAs semiconductor nanowires. Temperature dependence of the\nswitching current distribution can be understood by motion of Josephson phase\nparticle escaping from a tilted washboard potential, fitted well to the\nmacroscopic quantum tunneling, thermal activation and phase diffusion models,\ndepending on temperature. Application of gate voltage to tune the Josephson\ncoupling strength enables us to adjust the effective temperature for the\nescaping process, which would be promising for developing gate-tunable\nsuperconducting phase qubits.\n", "  The transition to turbulence in plane Poiseuille flow (PPF) is connected with\nthe presence of exact coherent structures. In contrast to other shear flows,\nPPF has a number of different coherent states that are relevant for the\ntransition. We here discuss the different states, compare the critical Reynolds\nnumbers and optimal wavelengths for their appearance, and explore the\ndifferences between flows operating at constant mass flux or at constant\npressure drop. The Reynolds numbers quoted here are based on the mean flow\nvelocity and refer to constant mass flux, the ones for constant pressure drop\nare always higher. The Tollmien-Schlichting waves bifurcate subcritically from\nthe laminar profile at $Re=5772$ and reach down to $Re=2609$ (at a different\noptimal wave length). Their localized counter part bifurcates at the even lower\nvalue $Re=2334$. Three dimensional exact solutions appear at much lower\nReynolds numbers. We describe one exact solutions that is spanwise localized\nand has a critical Reynolds number of $316$. Comparison to plane Couette flow\nsuggests that this is likely the lowest Reynolds number for exact coherent\nstructures in PPF. Streamwise localized versions of this state require higher\nReynolds numbers, with the lowest bifurcation occurring near $Re=1018$.\n", "  The Kitaev honeycomb model is a paradigm of exactly-solvable models, showing\nnon-trivial physical properties such as topological quantum order, abelian and\nnon-abelian anyons, and chirality. Its solution is one of the most beautiful\nexamples of the interplay of different mathematical techniques in condensed\nmatter physics. In this paper, we show how to derive a tensor network (TN)\ndescription of the eigenstates of this spin-1/2 model in the thermodynamic\nlimit, and in particular for its ground state. In our setting, eigenstates are\nnaturally encoded by an exact 3d TN structure made of fermionic unitary\noperators, corresponding to the unitary quantum circuit building up the\nmany-body quantum state. In our derivation we review how the different\n\"solution ingredients\" of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be accounted for in\nthe TN language, namely: Jordan-Wigner transformation, braidings of Majorana\nmodes, fermionic Fourier transformation, and Bogoliubov transformation. The TN\nbuilt in this way allows for a clear understanding of several properties of the\nmodel. In particular, we show how the fidelity diagram is straightforward both\nat zero temperature and at finite temperature in the vortex-free sector. We\nalso show how the properties of two-point correlation functions follow easily.\nFinally, we also discuss the pros and cons of contracting of our 3d TN down to\na 2d Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) with finite bond dimension. The\nresults in this paper can be extended to generalizations of the Kitaev model,\ne.g., to other lattices, spins, and dimensions.\n", "  This review discusses the main experiments and theoretical views related to\nobservation of high-temperature superconductivity in intercalated FeSe\ncompounds and single layer films of FeSe on substrates like SrTiO_3. We\nconsider in detail the electronic structure of these systems, both theoretical\ncalculations of this structure at hand and their correspondence with ARPES\nexperiments. It is stressed that electronic spectrum of these systems is\nqualitatively different from typical picture of the spectrum in well studied\nFeAs superconductors and the related problems of theoretical description of\nspectrum formation are also discussed. We also discuss the possible mechanisms\nof Cooper pairing in monolayers of FeSe and problems appearing here. As single\nlayer films of FeSe on SrTiO_3 can be represented as typical Ginzburg\n\"sandwiches\", we analyze the possibility of rising the critical temperature of\nsuperconducting transition T_c due to different variants of \"excitonic\"\nmechanism of superconductivity. It is shown, that in its classic variant (as\nproposed for such systems by Allender, Bray and Bardeen) this mechanism is\nunable to explain the observed values of T_c, but situation is different when\nwe consider instead of \"excitons\" the optical phonons in SrTiO_3 (with energy\nof the order of 100 meV). We consider both the simplest model of T_c\nenhancement due to interaction with such phonons and more specific models with\ndominant \"forward\" scattering, which allow to understand the growth of T_c as\ncompared with the case of bulk FeSe and intercalated FeSe systems. We also\ndiscuss the problems connected with antiadiabatic nature of superconductivity\ndue to such mechanism.\n", "  Non-equilibrium driving of biochemical reactions is believed to enable their\nrobust functioning despite the presence of thermal fluctuations and other\nsources of disorder. Such robust functions include sensory adaptation, enhanced\nenyzmatic specificity and maintenance of coherent oscillations. Non-equilibrium\nbiochemical reactions can be modeled as a master equation whose rate constants\nbreak detailed balance. We find that non equilibrium fluxes can support\ntopologically protected boundary modes that resemble similar modes in\nelectronic and mechanical systems. We show that when a biochemical network can\nbe decomposed into two ordered bulks that meet at a possibly disordered\ninterferace, the ordered bulks can be each associated with a topologically\ninvariant winding number. If the winding numbers are mismatched, we are\nguaranteed that the steady state distribution is localized at the interface\nbetween the bulks, even in the presence of strong disorder in reaction rates.\nWe argue that our work provides a framework for how biochemical systems can use\nnon equilibrium driving to achieve robust function.\n", "  We present supergravity solution for F-string in pp wave background obtained\nfrom AdS4 X CP3 with zero flat directions.The classical solution is shown to\nbreak all space-time supersymmetries. We explicitly write down the standard as\nwell as supernumerary Killing spinors both for the background and F-string\nsolution.\n", "  We show that supercocycles on super $L_\\infty$-algebras capture, at the\nrational level, the twisted cohomological charge structure of the fields of\nM-theory and of type IIA string theory. We show that rational 4-sphere-valued\nsupercocycles for M-branes in M-theory descend to supercocycles in type IIA\nstring theory with coefficients in the free loop space of the 4-sphere, to\nyield the Ramond-Ramond fields in the rational image of twisted K-theory, with\nthe twist given by the B-field. In particular, we derive the M2/M5\n$\\leftrightarrow$ F1/Dp/NS5 correspondence via dimensional reduction of\nsphere-valued super-$L_\\infty$-cocycles.\n", "  Fully gapped two-dimensional superconductors coupled to dynamical\nelectromagnetism are known to exhibit topological order. In this work, we\ndevelop a unified low-energy description for spin-singlet paired states by\nderiving topological Chern-Simons field theories for $s$-wave, $d+id$, and\nchiral higher even-wave superconductors. These theories capture the quantum\nstatistics and fusion rules of Bogoliubov quasiparticles and vortices and\nincorporate global continuous symmetries - specifically, spin rotation and\nconservation of magnetic flux - present in all singlet superconductors. For all\nsuch systems, we compute the Hall response for these symmetries and investigate\nthe physics at the edge. In particular, the weakly-coupled phase of a chiral\n$d+id$ chiral state has a spin Hall coefficient $\\nu_s=2$ and a vanishing Hall\nresponse for the magnetic flux symmetry. We argue that the latter is a generic\nresult for two-dimensional superconductors with gapped photons, thereby\ndemonstrating the absence of a spontaneous magnetic field in the ground state\nof chiral superconductors. It is also shown that the Chern-Simons theories of\nchiral spin-singlet superconductors derived here fall into Kitaev's 16-fold\nclassification of topological superconductors.\n", "  Heterostructure interface provides a powerful platform to observe rich\nemergent phenomena, such as interfacial superconductivity, nontrivial\ntopological surface state. Here SrRuO3/SrIrO3 superlattices were epitaxially\nsynthesized. The magnetic and electrical properties of these superlattices were\ncharacterized. Broad cusps in the zero field cooling magnetization curves and\nnear stable residual magnetization below the broad cusps, as well as two steps\nmagnetization hysteresis loops are observed. The magnetization relaxes\nfollowing a modified Stretched function model indicating coexistence of spin\nglass and ferromagnetic ordering in the superlattices. Topological Hall effect\nwas demonstrated at low temperature and weakened with the increase of SrIrO3\nlayer thickness. These results suggest that chiral ordering spin texture were\ngenerated at the interfaces due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)\ninteraction, which generates the spin glass behaviors. The present work\ndemonstrates that SrIrO3 can effectively induce interface DM interactions in\nheterostructures, it would pave light on the new research directions of strong\nspin orbit interaction oxides, from the viewpoints of both basic science and\nprospective spintronics devices applications.\n", "  We present results for the isovector axial, scalar and tensor charges\n$g^{u-d}_A$, $g^{u-d}_S$ and $g^{u-d}_T$ of the nucleon needed to probe the\nStandard Model and novel physics. The axial charge is a fundamental parameter\ndescribing the weak interactions of nucleons. The scalar and tensor charges\nprobe novel interactions at the TeV scale in neutron and nuclear\n$\\beta$-decays, and the flavor-diagonal tensor charges $g^{u}_T$, $g^{d}_T$ and\n$g^{s}_T$ are needed to quantify the contribution of the quark electric dipole\nmoment (EDM) to the neutron EDM. The 9 ensembles, generated by the MILC\nCollaboration using the HISQ action with 2+1+1 dynamical flavors, span three\nlattice spacings $a \\approx 0.06, 0.09$ and 0.12 fm and light-quark masses\ncorresponding to the pion masses $M_\\pi \\approx 135, 225$ and 315 MeV.\nHigh-statistics estimates on five ensembles using the all-mode-averaging method\nallow us to quantify all systematic uncertainties and perform a simultaneous\nextrapolation in the lattice spacing, lattice volume and light-quark masses for\nthe connected contributions. Our final estimates, in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$\nscheme at 2 GeV, of the isovector charges are $g_A^{u-d} = 1.195(33)(20)$,\n$g_S^{u-d} = 0.97(12)(6) $ and $g_T^{u-d} = 0.987(51)(20)$. The first error\nincludes statistical and all systematic uncertainties except that due to the\nextrapolation Ansatz, which is given by the second error estimate. Combining\nour estimate for $g_S^{u-d}$ with the difference of light quarks masses\n$(m_d-m_u)^{\\rm QCD}=2.67(35)$ MeV given by FLAG, we obtain $(M_N-M_P)^{\\rm\nQCD} = 2.59(49)$ MeV. Estimates of the connected part of the flavor-diagonal\ntensor charges of the proton are $g^{u}_T=0.792(42)$ and $g^{d}_T=-0.194(14)$.\nCombining our new estimates with precision low-energy experiments, we update\nconstraints on novel scalar and tensor interactions, $\\epsilon_{S,T}$, at the\nTeV scale.\n", "  Groups make decisions on both the production and the distribution of\nresources. These decisions typically involve a tension between increasing the\ntotal level of group resources (i.e. social efficiency) and distributing these\nresources among group members (i.e. individuals' relative shares). This is the\ncase because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus\nresulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dual-process\napproach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension.\nWe conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different\nallocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed\napproach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using\nthe Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the\nexperimental manipulation of response times). To test for robustness,\nexperiments were conducted in two countries: the US and India. Despite absolute\nlevel differences across countries, in both locations we show that: (i) time\npressure and low CRT scores are associated with individuals' concerns for their\nrelative shares; (ii) time delay and high CRT scores are associated with\nindividuals' concerns for social efficiency. These findings demonstrate that\ndeliberation favours social efficiency by overriding individuals' intuitive\ntendency to focus on relative shares.\n", "  The first full amplitude analysis of $B^+\\to J/\\psi \\phi K^+$ with\n$J/\\psi\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $\\phi\\to K^+K^-$ decays is performed with a data sample\nof 3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and $8$ TeV\nwith the LHCb detector. The data cannot be described by a model that contains\nonly excited kaon states decaying into $\\phi K^+$, and four $J/\\psi\\phi$\nstructures are observed, each with significance over $5$ standard deviations.\nThe quantum numbers of these structures are determined with significance of at\nleast $4$ standard deviations. The lightest has mass consistent with, but width\nmuch larger than, previous measurements of the claimed $X(4140)$ state.\n", "  The first full amplitude analysis of $B^+\\to J/\\psi \\phi K^+$ with\n$J/\\psi\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $\\phi\\to K^+K^-$ decays is performed with a data sample\nof 3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and $8$ TeV\nwith the LHCb detector.

The\nmodel includes significant contributions from a number of expected kaon\nexcitations, including the first observation of the $K^{*}(1680)^+\\to\\phi K^+$\ntransition.\n", "  The concept of scattering coefficients has played a pivotal role in a broad\nrange of inverse scattering and imaging problems in acoustic, and\nelectromagnetic media. In view of their promising applications in inverse\nproblems related to mathematical imaging and elastic cloaking, the notion of\nelastic scattering coefficients of an inclusion is presented from the\nperspective of boundary layer potentials and a few properties are discussed. A\nreconstruction algorithm is developed and analyzed for extracting the elastic\nscattering coefficients from multi-static response measurements of the\nscattered field in order to cater to inverse scattering problems. The decay\nrate, stability and error analyses, and the estimate of maximal resolving order\nin terms of the signal-to-noise ratio are discussed. Moreover,\nscattering-coefficients-vanishing structures are designed and their utility for\nenhancement of nearly elastic cloaking is elucidated.\n", "  One of the strengths of quantum information theory is that it can treat\nquantum states without referring to their particular physical representation.\nIn principle, quantum states can be therefore fully swapped between various\nquantum systems by their mutual interaction and this quantum state transfer is\ncrucial for many quantum communication and information processing tasks. In\npractice, however, the achievable interaction time and strength are often\nlimited by decoherence. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a\nprocedure for faithful quantum state transfer between two weakly interacting\nqubits. Our scheme enables a probabilistic yet perfect unidirectional transfer\nof an arbitrary unknown state of a source qubit onto a target qubit prepared\ninitially in a known state. The transfer is achieved by a combination of a\nsuitable measurement of the source qubit and quantum filtering on the target\nqubit depending on the outcome of measurement on the source qubit. We\nexperimentally verify feasibility and robustness of the transfer using a linear\noptical setup with qubits encoded into polarization states of single photons.\n", "  Through the theoretical study of electron spin lifetime in the 2DEG of doped\nSi, we highlight a dominant spin relaxation mechanism induced by the impurity\ncentral-cell potential near an interface via intervalley electron scattering.\nAt low temperatures and with modest doping, this Yafet spin flip mechanism can\nbecome much more important than the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation indcued by\nthe structural Rashba spin-orbit coupling field. As the leading-order\nimpurity-induced spin flip happens only between two non-opposite valleys in Si,\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems in Si MOSFETs or SiGe\nheterostructures are a natural platform to test and utilize this spin\nrelaxation mechanism due to the valley splitting near the interface and its\ntunability by electrical gating or applied stress. Our proposed new spin\nrelaxation mechanism may explain a part of the spin relaxation contribution to\nSi-based 2DEG systems.\n", "  Let $\\Lambda\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ be a domain consisting of several cylinders\nattached to a bounded center. One says that $\\Lambda$ admits a threshold\nresonance if there exists a non-trivial bounded function $u$ solving $-\\Delta\nu=\\nu u$ in $\\Lambda$ and vanishing at the boundary, where $\\nu$ is the bottom\nof the essential spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian in $\\Lambda$. We derive a\nsufficient condition for the absence of threshold resonances in terms of the\nLaplacian eigenvalues on the center. The proof is elementary and is based on\nthe min-max principle. Some two- and three-dimensional examples and\napplications to the study of Laplacians on thin networks are discussed.\n", "  In this paper we study the general conditions that have to be met for a\ngauged extension of a two-dimensional bosonic sigma-model to exist. In an\ninversion of the usual approach of identifying a global symmetry and then\npromoting it to a local one, we focus directly on the gauge symmetries of the\ntheory. This allows for action functionals which are gauge invariant for rather\ngeneral background fields in the sense that their invariance conditions are\nmilder than the usual case. In particular, the vector fields that control the\ngauging need not be Killing. The relaxation of isometry for the background\nfields is controlled by two connections on a Lie algebroid L in which the gauge\nfields take values, in a generalization of the common Lie-algebraic picture.\nHere we show that these connections can always be determined when L is a Dirac\nstructure in the H-twisted Courant algebroid. This also leads us to a\nderivation of the general form for the gauge symmetries of a wide class of\ntwo-dimensional topological field theories called Dirac sigma-models, which\ninterpolate between the G/G Wess-Zumino-Witten model and the (Wess-Zumino-term\ntwisted) Poisson sigma model.\n", "  In this paper we prove a mirror symmetry conjecture based on the work of\nBrini-Eynard-Mari\\~no \\cite{BEM} and Diaconescu-Shende-Vafa \\cite{DSV}. This\nconjecture relates open Gromov-Witten invariants of the conifold transition of\na torus knot to the topological recursion on the B-model spectral curve.\n", "  Tight-binding lattice models allow the creation of bound composite objects\nwhich, in the strong-interacting regime, are protected against dissociation. We\nshow that a local impurity in the lattice potential can generate a coherent\nsplit of an incoming bound particle wave-packet which consequently produces a\nNOON state between the endpoints. This is non trivial because when finite\nlattices are involved, edge-localisation effects make their use for\nnon-classical state generation and information transfer challenging. We derive\nan effective model to describe the propagation of bound particles in a\nBose-Hubbard chain. We introduce local impurities in the lattice potential to\ninhibit localisation effects and to split the propagating bound particle, thus\nenabling the generation of distant NOON states. We analyse how minimal\nengineering transfer schemes improve the transfer fidelity and we quantify the\nrobustness to typical decoherence effects in optical lattice implementations.\nOur scheme potentially have an impact on quantum-enhanced atomic interferometry\nin a lattice.\n", "  We investigate evolution of an accretion disc in binary black hole (BBH)\nsystems and possible electromagnetic counterparts of the gravitational waves\nfrom mergers of BBHs. Perna et al. (2016) proposed a novel evolutionary\nscenario of an accretion disc in BBHs in which a disc eventually becomes\n\"dead\", i.e., the magnetorotational instability (MRI) becomes inactive. In\ntheir scenario, the dead disc survives until {\\it a few seconds before} the\nmerger event. We improve the dead disc model and propose another scenario,\ntaking account of effects of the tidal torque from the companion and the\ncritical ionization degree for MRI activation more carefully. We find that the\nmass of the dead disc is much lower than that in the Perna's scenario. When the\nbinary separation sufficiently becomes small, the mass inflow induced by the\ntidal torque reactivates MRI, restarting mass accretion onto the black hole. We\nalso find that this disc \"revival\" happens {\\it more than thousands of years\nbefore} the merger. The mass accretion induced by the tidal torque increases as\nthe separation decreases, and a relativistic jet could be launched before the\nmerger. The emissions from these jets are too faint compared to GRBs, but\ndetectable if the merger events happen within $\\lesssim 10$ Mpc or if the\nmasses of the black holes are as massive as $\\sim 10^5 M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We study two-body $B_{(c)}\\to M_c(\\pi,K)$ and semileptonic $B_{c}\\to\nM_c\\ell^-\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ decays with $M_c=(J/\\psi,X_c^0)$, where $X_c^0\\equiv\nX^0(3872)$ is regarded as the tetraquark state of $c\\bar cu\\bar u(d\\bar d)$.\nWith the decay constant $f_{X_c^0}=(234\\pm 52)$~MeV determined from the data,\nwe predict that ${\\cal B}(B^-\\to X_c^0\\pi^-)=(11.5\\pm 5.7)\\times 10^{-6}$,\n${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0\\to X_c^0\\bar K^0)=(2.1\\pm 1.0)\\times 10^{-4}$, and ${\\cal\nB}(\\bar B^0_s\\to X_c^0\\bar K^0)=(11.4\\pm 5.6)\\times 10^{-6}$. With the form\nfactors in QCD models, we calculate that ${\\cal B}(B_c^-\\to X_c^0\\pi^-,X_c^0\nK^-)=(6.0\\pm 2.6)\\times 10^{-5}$ and $(4.7\\pm 2.0)\\times 10^{-6}$, and ${\\cal\nB}(B_c^-\\to J/\\psi \\mu^-\\bar \\nu_\\mu, X_c^0 \\mu^-\\bar \\nu_\\mu\n)=(2.3\\pm0.6)\\times 10^{-2}$ and $(1.35\\pm 0.18)\\times 10^{-3}$, respectively,\nand extract the ratio of the fragmentation fractions to be $f_c/f_u=(6.4\\pm\n1.9)\\times 10^{-3}$.\n", "  Topological insulators (superconductors) are materials that host\nsymmetry-protected metallic edge states in an insulating (superconducting)\nbulk. Although they are well understood, a thermodynamic description of these\nmaterials remained elusive, firstly because the edges yield a non-extensive\ncontribution to the thermodynamic potential, and secondly because topological\nfield theories involve non-local order parameters, and cannot be captured by\nthe Ginzburg-Landau formalism. Recently, this challenge has been overcome: by\nusing Hill thermodynamics to describe the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model in two\ndimensions, it was shown that at the topological phase change the thermodynamic\npotential does not scale extensively due to boundary effects. Here, we extend\nthis approach to different topological models in various dimensions (the Kitaev\nchain and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in one dimension, the Kane-Mele model in\ntwo dimensions and the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model in three dimensions) at zero\ntemperature. Surprisingly, all models exhibit the same universal behavior in\nthe order of the topological-phase transition, depending on the dimension.\nMoreover, we derive the topological phase diagram at finite temperature using\nthis thermodynamic description, and show that it displays a good agreement with\nthe one calculated from the Uhlmann phase. Our work reveals unexpected\nuniversalities and opens the path to a thermodynamic description of systems\nwith a non-local order parameter.\n", "  The paper presents briefly some general points of the theory of Surface\nEnhanced Raman Scattering on metals, semiconductors, dielectrics and graphene.\nIt is pointed out that the reason of SERS on graphene and some other 2D\nmaterials is not the chemical enhancement mechanism as it is widely accepted in\nliterature, but ripples, which are necessarily present on a graphene surface\nand are analogues of the surface roughness, which is a reason of SERS. In\naddition, it is indicated that the quadrupole interaction, which arises in\nstrong SERS is practically absent in the system with graphene. The results are\nconfirmed by the analysis of the SERS, usual Raman and IR spectra of\nphthalocyanine molecule and by some other experimental data.\n", "  We report the fabrication of strongly coupled nanohybrid superconducting\njunctions using PbS semiconductor nanowires and Pb0.5In0.5 superconducting\nelectrodes. The maximum supercurrent in the junction reaches up to ~15 \\mu A at\n0.3 K, which is the highest value ever observed in semiconductor-nanowire-based\nsuperconducting junctions. The observation of microwave-induced constant\nvoltage steps confirms the existence of genuine Josephson coupling through the\nnanowire. Monotonic suppression of the critical current under an external\nmagnetic field is also in good agreement with the narrow junction model. The\ntemperature-dependent stochastic distribution of the switching current exhibits\na crossover from phase diffusion to a thermal activation process as the\ntemperature decreases. These strongly coupled nanohybrid superconducting\njunctions would be advantageous to the development of gate-tunable\nsuperconducting quantum information devices.\n", "  The dijet production cross section for jets containing a $b$-hadron\n($b$-jets) has been measured in proton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data\nused correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.2 fb$^{-1}$. The cross section\nis measured for events with two identified $b$-jets with a transverse momentum\n$p_T > 20$ GeV and a minimum separation in the $\\eta$-$\\phi$ plane of $\\Delta R\n= 0.4$. At least one of the jets in the event is required to have $p_T > 270$\nGeV. The cross section is measured differentially as a function of dijet\ninvariant mass, dijet transverse momentum, boost of the dijet system, and the\nrapidity difference, azimuthal angle and angular distance between the $b$-jets.\nThe results are compared to different predictions of leading order and\nnext-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics matrix elements\nsupplemented with models for parton-showers and hadronization.\n", "  We theoretically study the response of a many-body localized system to a\nlocal quench from a quantum information perspective. We find that the local\nquench triggers entanglement growth throughout the whole system, giving rise to\na logarithmic lightcone. This saturates the modified Lieb-Robinson bound for\nquantum information propagation in many-body localized systems previously\nconjectured based on the existence of local integrals of motion. In addition,\nnear the localization-delocalization transition, we find that the final states\nafter the local quench exhibit volume-law entanglement. We also show that the\nlocal quench induces a deterministic orthogonality catastrophe for highly\nexcited eigenstates, where the typical wave-function overlap between the pre-\nand post-quench eigenstates decays {\\it exponentially} with the system size.\n", "  We propose and prove the Verlinde formula for the quantization of the Higgs\nbundle moduli spaces and stacks for any simple and simply-connected group. This\ngeneralizes the equivariant Verlinde formula for the case of $SU(n)$ proposed\npreviously by the second and third author. We further establish a Verlinde\nformula for the quantization of parabolic Higgs bundle moduli spaces and\nstacks. Finally, we prove that these dimensions form a one-parameter family of\n$1+1$-dimensional TQFT, uniquely classified by the complex Verlinde algebra,\nwhich is a one-parameter family of Frobenius algebras. We construct this\none-parameter family of Frobenius algebras as a deformation of the classical\nVerlinde algebra for $G$.\n", "  We develop a gyrokinetic treatment for ions in the magnetic presheath, close\nto the plasma-wall boundary. We focus on magnetic presheaths with a small\nmagnetic field to wall angle, $\\alpha \\ll 1$ (in radians). Characteristic\nlengths perpendicular to the wall in such a magnetic presheath scale with the\ntypical ion Larmor orbit size, $\\rho_{\\text{i}}$. The smallest scale length\nassociated with variations parallel to the wall is taken to be across the\nmagnetic field, and ordered $l = \\rho_{\\text{i}} / \\delta$, where $ \\delta \\ll\n1$ is assumed. The scale lengths along the magnetic field line are assumed so\nlong that variations associated with this direction are neglected. These\norderings are consistent with what we expect close to the divertor target of a\ntokamak. We allow for a strong component of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ in the\ndirection normal to the electron repelling wall, with strong variation in the\nsame direction. The large change of the electric field over an ion Larmor\nradius distorts the orbit so that it is not circular. We solve for the lowest\norder orbits by identifying coordinates, which consist of constants of\nintegration, an adiabatic invariant and a gyrophase, associated with periodic\nion motion in the system with $\\alpha = \\delta = 0$. By using these new\ncoordinates as variables in the limit $\\alpha \\sim \\delta \\ll 1$, we obtain a\ngeneralized ion gyrokinetic equation. We find another quantity that is\nconserved to first order and use this to simplify the gyrokinetic equation,\nsolving it in the case of a collisionless magnetic presheath. Assuming a\nBoltzmann response for the electrons, a form of the quasineutrality equation\nthat exploits the change of variables is derived. The gyrokinetic and\nquasineutrality equations give the ion distribution function and electrostatic\npotential in the magnetic presheath if the entrance boundary condition is\nspecified.\n", "  A thorough understanding of the mean-free-path (MFP) distribution of the\nenergy carriers is crucial to engineer and tune the transport properties of\nmaterials. In this context, a significant body of work has investigated the\nphonon and electron MFP distribution, however, similar studies of the magnon\nMFP distribution have not been carried out so far. In this work, we used\nthickness-dependence measurements of the longitudinal spin Seebeck (LSSE)\neffect of yttrium iron garnet films to reconstruct the cumulative distribution\nof a SSE related effective magnon MFP. By using the experimental data reported\nby Guo et al. [Phys. Rev. X 6, 031012 (2016)], we adapted the phonon MFP\nreconstruction algorithm proposed by A.J. Minnich, [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,\n205901 (2012)] and apply it to magnons. The reconstruction showed that magnons\nwith different MFP contribute in different manner to the total LSSE and the\neffective magnon MFP distribution spreads far beyond their typical averaged\nvalues.\n", "  We investigate the electrostatic charging of an agitated bed of identical\ngrains using simulations, mathematical modeling, and experiments. We simulate\ncharging with a discrete-element model including electrical multipoles and find\nthat infinitesimally small initial charges can grow exponentially rapidly. We\npropose a mathematical Turing model that defines conditions for exponential\ncharging to occur and provides insights into the mechanisms involved. Finally,\nwe confirm the predicted exponential growth in experiments using vibrated\ngrains under microgravity, and we describe novel predicted spatiotemporal\nstates that merit further study.\n", "  Solid-state spin arrays are being engineered in varied systems, including\ngated coupled quantum dots and interacting dopants in semiconductor structures.\nBeyond quantum computation, these arrays are useful integrated analog\nsimulators for many-body models. As entanglement between individual spins is\nextremely short ranged in these models, one has to measure the entanglement\nentropy of a block in order to truly verify their many-body entangled nature.\nRemarkably, the characteristic scaling of entanglement entropy, predicted by\nconformal field theory, has never been measured. Here we show that with as few\nas two replicas of a spin array, and capacitive double-dot singlet-triplet\nmeasurements on neighboring spin pairs, the above scaling of the entanglement\nentropy can be verified. This opens up the controlled simulation of quantum\nfield theories, as we exemplify with uniform chains and Kondo-type impurity\nmodels, in engineered solid-state systems. Our procedure remains effective even\nin the presence of typical imperfections of realistic quantum devices and can\nbe used for thermometry, and to bound entanglement and discord in mixed\nmany-body states.\n", "  In this work we study the Quasi Normal Modes(QNMs) under massless scalar\nperturbations and the thermodynamics of linearly charged BTZ black holes in\nmassive gravity in the (Anti)de Sitter((A)dS) space time. It is found that the\nbehavior of QNMs changes with the massive parameter and also with the charge of\nthe black hole. The thermodynamics of such black holes in the (A)dS space time\nis also analyzed in detail. The behavior of specific heat with temperature for\nsuch black holes gives an indication of a phase transition that depends on the\nmassive parameter and also on the charge of the black hole.\n", "  We compare the effective spin-orbital super\\-exchange triggered by magnetic\n$3d$ impurities with $d^3$ and $d^2$ configurations and either no orbital\ndegree of freedom (orbital dilution) or hole replacing a doublon (charge\ndilution) in a $4d^4$ Mott insulator with $S=1$ spins. Impurities causing\norbital dilution act either as spin defects decoupled from the surrounding\nions, or generate orbital polarons along $d^3$-$d^4$ hybrid bonds. The exchange\non these bonds determines which orbital is occupied by a doublon on the host\nsite. In case of charge dilution by $3d^2$ impurities additional $\\propto\nT_i^+T_j^+$ terms arise which enhance orbital fluctuations. We show that such\nterms may radically change orbital pattern at relatively low doping by $x=1/8$\nhole defects. Our findings provide new perspective for future theoretical and\nexperimental studies of doped transition metal oxides.\n", "  The theorem of Lieb, Schultz and Mattis (LSM), which states that the S=1/2\nXXZ spin chain has gapless or degenerate ground states, can be applied to\nbroader models. Independently, Kolb considered the relation between the wave\nnumber $q$ and the twisting boundary condition, and he obtained a similar\nresult as LSM. However, in frustrating cases it is known that there exist\nseveral exceptions for the assumption of the unique lowest state for the finite\nsize, which is important in the traditional LSM theorem. In our previous paper,\nwithout the assumption of the uniqueness, we have extended the LSMK theorem for\nfrustrating and non-symmetric cases. However, there remains a complexity in the\nproof of continuity. In this paper, we will simplify the proof than the\nprevious work.\n", "  By analyzing 482 pb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected at $\\sqrt\ns=4.009$ GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we measure the\nabsolute branching fractions for the semileptonic decays $D_{s}^{+}\\to\\eta\ne^{+}\\nu_{e}$ and $D_{s}^{+}\\to \\eta'e^{+}\\nu_{e}$ to be\n${B}(D_{s}^{+}\\rightarrow\\eta e^{+}\\nu_{e})=(2.30\\pm0.31\\pm0.08)$\\% and\n${B}(D_{s}^{+}\\rightarrow\\eta'e^{+} \\nu_{e}) = (0.93\\pm0.30\\pm0.05)$\\%,\nrespectively, and their ratio\n$\\frac{{B}(D_{s}^{+}\\rightarrow\\eta'e^{+}\\nu_{e})}\n{{B}(D_{s}^{+}\\rightarrow\\eta e^{+}\\nu_{e})}=0.40\\pm0.14\\pm0.02$, where the\nfirst uncertainties are statistical and the second ones are systematic. The\nresults are in good agreement with previous measurements within uncertainties;\nthey can be used to determine the $\\eta-\\eta'$ mixing angle and improve upon\nthe $D_s^+$ semileptonic branching ratio precision.\n", "  We derive exact scaling laws for a three-dimensional incompressible helical\ntwo-fluid plasma, without the assumption of isotropy. For each ideal invariant\nof the two-fluid model, i.e. the total energy, the electron helicity and the\nproton helicity, we derive simple scaling laws in terms of two-point increments\ncorrelation functions expressed in terms of the velocity field of each species\nand the magnetic field. These variables are appropriate for comparison with\n\\textit{in-situ} measurements in the solar wind at different spatial ranges and\ndata from numerical simulations. Finally, with the exact scaling laws and\ndimensional analysis we predict the magnetic energy and electron helicity\nspectra for different ranges of scales.\n", "  The superconducting critical temperature (Tc > 15K) of niobium titanium\nnitride (NbTiN) thin films allows for low-loss circuits up to 1.1 THz, enabling\non-chip spectroscopy and multi-pixel imaging with advanced detectors. The drive\nfor large scale detector microchips is demanding NbTiN films with uniform\nproperties over an increasingly larger area. This article provides an\nexperimental comparison between two reactive d.c. sputter systems with\ndifferent target sizes: a small target (100mm diameter) and a large target (127\nmm x 444.5 mm). This article focuses on maximizing the Tc of the films and the\naccompanying I-V characteristics of the sputter plasma, and we find that both\nsystems are capable of depositing films with Tc > 15 K. The resulting film\nuniformity is presented in a second manuscript in this volume. We find that\nthese films are deposited within the transition from metallic to compound\nsputtering, at the point where target nitridation most strongly depends on\nnitrogen flow. Key in the deposition optimization is to increase the system's\npumping speed and gas flows to counteract the hysteretic effects induced by the\ntarget size. Using the I-V characteristics as a guide proves to be an effective\nway to optimize a reactive sputter system, for it can show whether the optimal\ndeposition regime is hysteresis-free and accessible.\n", "  Uniformity in thickness and electronic properties of superconducting niobium\ntitanium nitride (NbTiN) thin films is a critical issue for upscaling\nsuperconducting electronics, such as microwave kinetic inductance detectors for\nsubmillimeter wave astronomy. In this article we make an experimental\ncomparison between the uniformity of NbTiN thin films produced by two DC\nmagnetron sputtering systems with vastly different target sizes: the Nordiko\n2000 equipped with a circular 100mm diameter target, and the Evatec LLS801 with\na rectangular target of 127 mm x 444.5 mm. In addition to the films deposited\nstaticly in both systems, we have also deposited films in the LLS801 while\nshuttling the substrate in front of the target, with the aim of further\nenhancing the uniformity. Among these three setups, the LLS801 system with\nsubstrate shuttling has yielded the highest uniformity in film thickness\n(+/-2%), effective resistivity (decreasing by 5% from center to edge), and\nsuperconducting critical temperature (T_c = 15.0 K - 15.3 K) over a 100 mm\ndiameter wafer. However, the shuttling appears to increase the resistivity by\nalmost a factor of 2 compared to static deposition. Surface SEM inspections\nsuggest that the shuttling could have induced a different mode of\nmicrostructural film growth.\n", "  We show that resonant dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms in a\ntriangular lattice can give rise to artificial magnetic fields for spin\nexcitations. We consider the coherent dipole-dipole coupling between $np$ and\n$ns$ Rydberg states and derive an effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian for the $np$\nexcitations. By breaking time-reversal symmetry via external fields we engineer\ncomplex hopping amplitudes for transitions between two rectangular\nsub-lattices. The phase of these hopping amplitudes depends on the direction of\nthe hop. This gives rise to a staggered, artificial magnetic field which\ninduces non-trivial topological effects. We calculate the single-particle band\nstructure and investigate its Chern numbers as a function of the lattice\nparameters and the detuning between the two sub-lattices. We identify extended\nparameter regimes where the Chern number of the lowest band is $C=1$ or $C=2$.\n", "  We analyze the performance of quantum parameter estimation in the presence of\nthe most general Gaussian dissipative reservoir. We derive lower bounds on the\nprecision of phase estimation and a closely related problem of frequency\nestimation. For both problems we show that it is impossible to achieve the\nHeisenberg limit asymptotically in the presence of such a reservoir. However,\nwe also find that for any fixed number of probes used in the setup there exists\na Gaussian dissipative reservoir, which, in principle, allows for the\nHeisenberg-limited performance for that number of probes. We discuss a\nrealistic implementation of a frequency estimation scheme in the presence of a\nGaussian dissipative reservoir in a cavity system.\n", "  We present a detailed derivation of the master equation describing a general\ntime-dependent quantum system with classical Poisson white noise and outline\nits various properties. We discuss the limiting cases of Poisson white noise\nand provide approximations for the different noise strength regimes. We show\nthat using the eigenstates of the noise superoperator as a basis can be a\nuseful way of expressing the master equation. Using this we simulate various\nsettings to illustrate different effects of Poisson noise. In particular, we\nshow a dip in the fidelity as a function of noise strength where high fidelity\ncan occur in the strong noise regime for some cases. We also investigate recent\nclaims [Jing et al., Phys. Rev. A 89 032110 (2014)] that this type of noise may\nimprove rather than destroy adiabaticity.\n", "  A relationship between the discrete Dirac-K\\\"ahler equation and discrete\nanalogues of some Dirac type equations in the geometric spacetime algebra is\ndiscussed. We show that a solution of the discrete Dirac-K\\\"ahler equation can\nbe represented as the sum and difference of solutions of discrete Dirac type\nequations with the corresponding sign of the mass term.\n", "  We present a study of the strong isospin-breaking (IB) effect, due in QCD to\nthe difference between $u$- and $d$-quark masses, in the leptonic decay\nconstants of charmed and beauty pseudoscalar and vector mesons using the method\nof QCD sum rules. We apply the sum-rule analysis to the decay constants of\nmesons containing one heavy quark and one light quark with the light mass in\nthe range from the average $u/d$ quark mass to the strange-quark mass. We then\nanalyse the dependence of the decay constants on the light quark mass and\nextract with good accuracy the IB ratios of decay constants at leading order in\nthe mass difference $(m_d - m_u)$, obtaining: $(f_{D^+} - f_{D^0}) / f_{D} =\n0.0047 (6)$, $(f_{D^{*+}} - f_{D^{*0}}) / f_{D^*} = 0.0068 (9)$, $(f_{B^0} -\nf_{B^+}) / f_{B} = 0.0047 (6)$, and $(f_{B^{*0}} - f_{B^{*+}}) / f_{B^*} =\n0.0045 (5)$, which yield: $f_{D^+} - f_{D^0} = 0.97 \\pm 0.13$ MeV, $f_{D^{*+}}\n- f_{D^{*0}} = 1.73 \\pm 0.27$ MeV, $f_{B^0} - f_{B^+} = 0.90 \\pm 0.13$ MeV,\n$f_{B^{*0}} - f_{B^{*+}} = 0.81 \\pm 0.11$ MeV. In the case of the $D$-meson our\nfinding is consistent with recent lattice QCD results, whereas it is much lower\nin the case of the $B$-meson showing a tension of $\\approx 3$ standard\ndeviations.\n", "  We consider the spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABSs) in an exemplary\n4-terminal superconducting structure where 4 chaotic cavities are connected by\nQPCs to the terminals and to each other forming a ring. Such a tunable device\ncan be realized in 2DEG-superconductor structures.\n  We concentrate on the limit of a short structure and large conductance of the\nQPCs where a quasi-continuous spectrum is formed. The energies can be tuned by\nthe superconducting phases. We observe the opening and closing of gaps in the\nspectrum. This concerns the usual proximity gap that separates the levels from\nzero energy as well as less usual \"smile\" gaps that split the levels of the\nspectrum.\n  We demonstrate a remarkable crossover in the overall spectrum that occurs\nupon changing the ratio of conductance of the inner and outer QPCs. At big\nvalues of the ratio, the levels exhibit a generic behavior expected for the\nspectrum of a disordered system manifesting level repulsion and \"Brownian\nmotion\" upon changing the phases. At small values of the ratio, the levels are\nsqueezed into narrow bunches separated by wide smile gaps. Each bunch consists\nof almost degenerate ABSs.\n  We study in detail the properties of the spectrum in the limit of a small\nratio, paying special attention to the crossings of bunches. We distinguish two\ntypes of crossings: i. with a regular phase dependence of the levels and ii.\ncrossings where the Brownian motion of the levels leads to an apparently\nirregular phase-dependence. We work out a perturbation theory to explain the\nobservations.\n  The unusual properties of the spectrum originate from unobvious topological\neffects. Topology of the first kind is related to the winding of the\nsemiclassical Green's function. It is responsible for the proximity gaps.\nTopology of the second kind comes about the discreteness of the number of modes\nand is responsible for the smile gaps.\n", "  The remarkable gapless and linear band structure of graphene opens up new\ncarrier relaxation channels bridging the valence and the conduction band. These\nAuger scattering processes change the number of charge carriers and can give\nrise to a significant multiplication of optically excited carriers in graphene.\nThis is an ultrafast many-particle phenomenon that is of great interest both\nfor fundamental many-particle physics as well as technological applications.\nHere, we review the research on carrier multiplication in graphene and\nLandau-quantized graphene including theoretical modelling and experimental\ndemonstration.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new framework for treating the angular\ninformation in the pulsar timing array response to a gravitational wave\nbackground based on standard cosmic microwave background techniques. We\ncalculate the angular power spectrum of the all-sky gravitational redshift\npattern induced at the earth for both a single bright source of gravitational\nradiation and a statistically isotropic, unpolarized Gaussian random\ngravitational wave background. The angular power spectrum is the harmonic\ntransform of the Hellings & Downs curve. We use the power spectrum to examine\nthe expected variance in the Hellings & Downs curve in both cases. Finally, we\ndiscuss the extent to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to the angular\npower spectrum and find that the power spectrum sensitivity is dominated by the\nquadrupole anisotropy of the gravitational redshift map.\n", "  We introduce an equilibrium formulation of the functional renormalization\ngroup (fRG) for inhomogeneous systems capable of dealing with spatially\nfinite-ranged interactions. In the general third order truncated form of fRG,\nthe dependence of the two-particle vertex is described by O(N^4) independent\nvariables, where N is the dimension of the single-particle system. In a\nprevious paper [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045128 (2014)], the so-called coupled-ladder\napproximation (CLA) was introduced and shown to admit a consistent treatment\nfor models with a purely onsite interaction, reducing the vertex to O(N^2)\nindependent variables. Here, we extend this scheme to the extended coupled\nladder approximation (eCLA), which includes a spatially extended feedback\nbetween the individual channels, measured by a feedback length L, using O(N^2\nL^2) independent variables for the vertex. We apply the eCLA to three types of\none-dimensional models : First, to a quantum point contact (QPC) with a\nparabolic barrier top and short-ranged interactions. Here eCLA achieves\nconvergence for L equal to the characteristic length l_x of the QPC. It also\nturns out that the additional feedback stabilizes the fRG-flow. This enables\nus, second, to study the crossover between a QPC and a quantum dot, again for a\nmodel with short-ranged interactions. Third, the enlarged feedback also enables\nthe treatment of a finite-ranged interaction extending over up to L sites.\nEstimating the form of such a finite-ranged interaction in a QPC, we study its\neffects on the conductance and the density. For low densities and sufficiently\nlarge interaction ranges the conductance develops additional oscillatory\nfeatures, and the corresponding density shows fluctuations that can be\ninterpreted as Friedel oscillations arising from a renormalized barrier shape\nwith a rather flat top and steep flanks.\n", "  The evolution of the magnetic and charge transport properties of itinerant\nmagnetic metal MnSi with the substitution of Al and Ga on the Si site is\ninvestigated. We observe an increase in unit cell volume indicating that both\nAl and Ga substitutions create negative chemical pressure. There are\nsubstantial increases in the Curie temperature and the ordered moment\ndemonstrating that the substitutions give the magnetism a more local character.\nThe substitutions also increase the range of temperature and field where the\nskyrmion phase is stable due to a change in the character of the magnetism. In\ncontrast to the behavior of pure MnSi and expectations for the intrinsic\nanomalous Hall effect, we find a significant temperature dependence to the\nmagnitude and sign of anomalous Hall conductivity constant in Al or Ga\nsubstituted samples. This temperature dependence likely reflects changes in the\nspin-orbit coupling strength with temperature, which may have significant\nconsequences on the helical and skyrmion states. Overall, we observe a\ncontinuous evolution of magnetic and charge transport properties through\npositive to negative pressure\n", "  We discuss and measure the phase shift imposed onto a radially polarized\nlight beam when focusing it onto an $^{174}\\text{Yb}^{+}$ ion. In the\nderivation of the expected phase shifts we include the properties of the\ninvolved atomic levels. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the\nscattering cross section and its relation to the efficiency for coupling the\nfocused light to an atom. The phase shifts found in the experiment are\ncompatible with the expected ones when accounting for known deficiencies of the\nfocusing optics and the motion of the trapped ion at the Doppler limit of laser\ncooling.\n", "  We study the impact of including quark- and gluon-initiated jet\ndiscrimination in the search for strongly interacting supersymmetric particles\nat the LHC. Taking the example of gluino pair production, considerable\nimprovement is observed in the LHC search reach on including the jet\nsubstructure observables to the standard kinematic variables within a\nmultivariate analysis. In particular, quark and gluon jet separation has higher\nimpact in the region of intermediate mass-gap between the gluino and the\nlightest neutralino, as the difference between the signal and the standard\nmodel background kinematic distributions is reduced in this region. We also\ncompare the predictions from different Monte Carlo event generators to estimate\nthe uncertainty originating from the modelling of the parton shower and\nhadronization processes.\n", "  We study the semi-exclusive production of $\\pi^\\pm B_s^0$ pairs in hadron\ncolliders which is associated with the $X(5568)$ structure observed by the D0\nCollaboration in 2016, but that was not confirmed by LHCb and CMS later. The\nreason of its appearance in the D0 and absence in LHCb and CMS is discussed in\nthis letter. In a semi-exclusive process, one might miss the third particle\nwhich is produced together with the $\\pi^\\pm B_s^0$ simultaneously. In the\nthree-body Dalitz plot, once the remaining region is narrow enough after the\nkinematic cuts, its reflection to another invariant mass distribution will\naccumulate a large number of events within a specific energy region. If there\nis an enhancement in the remaining region, it will make the reflection\nstructure more pronounced. The precise line shape of the reflection will depend\non the specific interaction form. A combined study of different cone cuts and\nthe low-energy dynamics, e.g. the Landau singularity, demonstrates that the\n$X(5568)$ structure could come from this kinematic reflection. This conclusion\ncan be checked by both searching for the enhancement in another invariant mass\ndistribution, such as $B_s^0\\bar{B}^0$, and the cone cut dependence of the\n$X(5568)$ mass. Such a combined study can be used to distinguish the effects of\nthe triangle singularity from a genuine state. We also propose how to avoid\nthis kinematic reflection in future experimental analysis.\n", "  We develop an approach to characterize excited states of disordered many-body\nsystems using spatially resolved structures of entanglement. We show that the\nbehavior of the mutual information (MI) between two parties of a many-body\nsystem can signal a qualitative difference between thermal and localized phases\n-- MI is finite in insulators while it approaches zero in the thermodynamic\nlimit in the ergodic phase. Related quantities, such as the recently introduced\nCodification Volume (CV), are shown to be suitable to quantify the correlation\nlength of the system. These ideas are illustrated using prototypical\nnon-interacting wavefunctions of localized and extended particles and then\napplied to characterize states of strongly excited interacting spin chains. We\nespecially focus on evolution of spatial structure of quantum information\nbetween high temperature diffusive and many-body localized phases believed to\nexist in these models. We study MI as a function of disorder strength both\naveraged over the eigenstates and in time-evolved product states drawn from\ncontinuously deformed family of initial states realizable experimentally. As\nexpected, spectral and time-evolved averages coincide inside the ergodic phase\nand differ significantly outside. We also highlight dispersion among the\ninitial states \\emph{within} the localized phase -- some of these show\nconsiderable generation and delocalization of quantum information.\n", "  Prospects of using metal hole arrays for the enhanced optical detection of\nmolecular chirality in nanosize volumes are investigated. Light transmission\nthrough the holes filled with an optically active material is modeled and the\nactivity enhancement by more than an order of magnitude is demonstrated. The\nspatial resolution of the chirality detection is shown to be of a few tens of\nnanometers. From comparing the effect in arrays of cylindrical holes and holes\nof complex chiral shape, it is concluded that the detection sensitivity is\ndetermined by the plasmonic near field enhancement. The intrinsic chirality of\nthe arrays due to their shape appears to be less important.\n", "  The Short BaseLine (SBL) neutrino oscillations anomalies hint at the presence\nof a sterile neutrino with a mass of around 1 eV. However, such neutrino is\nhighly incompatible with the cosmological data, in particular from the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB), if no new physics is assumed. An interesting\npossibility for reconciling the 1 eV sterile neutrino presence in cosmology is\nrelated to the existence of a new pseudoscalar interaction. If the sterile\nneutrinos experience such a pseudoscalar interaction, the cosmological analyses\nof the full CMB data prefer a sterile neutrino mass that is fully compatible\nwith the SBL determinations. The additional interaction allows to obtain also\nan improved compatibility of the cosmological predictions with the local\nmeasurements of the Hubble parameter.\n", "  The Shannon entropy, the desequilibrium and their generalizations (R\\'enyi\nand Tsallis entropies) of the three-dimensional single-particle systems in a\nspherically-symmetric potential $V(r)$ can be decomposed into angular and\nradial parts. The radial part depends on the analytical form of the potential,\nbut the angular part does not. In this paper we first calculate the angular\nentropy of any central potential by means of two analytical procedures. Then,\nwe explicitly find the dominant term of the radial entropy for the highly\nenergetic (i.e., Rydberg) stationary states of the oscillator-like systems. The\nangular and radial contributions to these entropic measures are analytically\nexpressed in terms of the quantum numbers which characterize the corresponding\nquantum states and, for the radial part, the oscillator strength. In the latter\ncase we use some recent powerful results of the information theory of the\nLaguerre polynomials and spherical harmonics which control the oscillator-like\nwavefunctions.\n", "  We introduce a so-called `coprimeness-preserving non-integrable' extension\n(another terminology is `quasi-integrable' extension) to the two-dimensional\nToda lattice equation. We believe that this equation is the first example of\nsuch discrete equation defined over a three-dimensional lattice. We prove that\nall the iterates of the equation are irreducible Laurent polynomials of the\ninitial data and that every pair of two iterates is co-prime, which indicate\nconfined singularities of the equation. By reducing the equation to two- or\none-dimensional lattices, we obtain coprimeness-preserving non-integrable\nextensions to the one-dimensional Toda lattice equation and the Somos-4\nrecurrence.\n", "  We report on new distances and proper motions to seven stars across the\nSerpens/Aquila complex. The observations were obtained as part of the Gould's\nBelt Distances Survey (GOBELINS) project between September 2013 and April 2016\nwith the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). One of our targets is the\nproto-Herbig AeBe object EC 95, which is a binary system embedded in the\nSerpens Core. For this system, we combined the GOBELINS observations with\nprevious VLBA data to cover a total period of ~8 years, and derive the orbital\nelements and an updated source distance. The individual distances to sources in\nthe complex are fully consistent with each other, and the mean value\ncorresponds to a distance of $436.0\\pm9.2$~pc for the Serpens/W40 complex.\nGiven this new evidence, we argue that Serpens Main, W40 and Serpens South are\nphysically associated and form a single cloud structure.\n", "  We observe that the periodic variations in spin-down rate and beam-width of\nthe radio pulsar PSR B1828-11 are getting faster. In the context of a free\nprecession model, this corresponds to a decrease in the precession period\n$P_{\\mathrm{fp}}$. We investigate how a precession model can account for such a\ndecrease in $P_{\\mathrm{fp}}$, in terms of an increase over time in the\nabsolute biaxial deformation ($|\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{p}}|{\\sim}10^{-8}$) of this\npulsar. We perform a Bayesian model comparison against the 'base' precession\nmodel (with constant $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{p}}$) developed in Ashton et al (2016),\nand we obtain decisive odds in favour of a time-varying deformation. We study\ntwo types of time-variation: (i) a linear drift with a posterior estimate of\n$\\dot{\\epsilon}_{\\mathrm{p}}{\\sim}10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and odds of\n$10^{75}$ compared to the base-model, and (ii) $N$ discrete positive jumps in\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{p}}$ with very similar odds to the linear\n$\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{p}}$-drift model. The physical mechanism explaining this\nbehaviour is unclear, but the observation could provide a crucial probe of the\ninterior physics of neutron stars. We also place an upper bound on the rate at\nwhich the precessional motion is damped, and translate this into a bound on a\ndissipative mutual friction-type coupling between the star's crust and core.\n", "  In this paper, we are looking for $\\mathcal{N}=1$, AdS$_4$ sourceless vacua\nin type IIB. While several examples exist in type IIA , there exists only one\nexample of such vacua in type IIB . Thanks to the framework of generalized\ngeometry we were able to devise a semi-algorithmical method to look for\nsourceless vacua. We present this method, which can easily be generalized to\nmore complex cases, and give two new vacua in type IIB.\n", "  Concise and explicit formulas for dyadic Green's functions, representing the\nelectric and magnetic fields due to a dipole source placed in layered media,\nare derived in this paper. First, the electric and magnetic fields in the\nspectral domain for the half space are expressed using Fresnel reflection and\ntransmission coefficients. Each component of electric field in the spectral\ndomain constitutes the spectral Green's function in layered media. The Green's\nfunction in the spatial domain is then recovered involving Sommerfeld integrals\nfor each component in the spectral domain. By using Bessel identities, the\nnumber of Sommerfeld integrals are reduced, resulting in much simpler and more\nefficient formulas for numerical implementation compared with previous results.\nThis approach is extended to the three-layer Green's function. In addition, the\nsingular part of the Green's function is naturally separated out so that\nintegral equation methods developed for free space Green's functions can be\nused with minimal modification. Numerical results are included to show\nefficiency and accuracy of the derived formulas.\n", "  In nuclear matter at neutron-star densities and temperatures, Cooper pairing\nleads to the formation of a gap in the nucleon excitation spectra resulting in\nexponentially strong Boltzmann suppression of many transport coefficients.\nPrevious calculations have shown evidence that density oscillations of\nsufficiently large amplitude can overcome this suppression for flavor-changing\n$\\beta$ processes, via the mechanism of \"gap bridging\". We address the\nsimplifications made in that initial work, and show that gap bridging can\ncounteract Boltzmann suppression of neutrino emissivity for the realistic case\nof modified Urca processes in matter with $^3P_2$ neutron pairing.\n", "  We use the action-angle variables to describe the geodesic motions in the\n$5$-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$. This formulation allows us to\nstudy thoroughly the complete integrability of the system. We find that the\nHamiltonian involves a reduced number of action variables. Therefore one of the\nfundamental frequency is zero indicating a chaotic behavior when the system is\nperturbed.\n", "  We analyze a multilayer neural field model of spatial working memory,\nfocusing on the impact of interlaminar connectivity, spatial heterogeneity, and\nvelocity inputs. Models of spatial working memory typically employ networks\nthat generate persistent activity via a combination of local excitation and\nlateral inhibition. Our model is comprised of a multilayer set of equations\nthat describes connectivity between neurons in the same and different layers\nusing an integral term. The kernel of this integral term then captures the\nimpact of different interlaminar connection strengths, spatial heterogeneity,\nand velocity input. We begin our analysis by focusing on how interlaminar\nconnectivity shapes the form and stability of (persistent) bump attractor\nsolutions to the model. Subsequently, we derive a low-dimensional approximation\nthat describes how spatial heterogeneity, velocity input, and noise combine to\ndetermine the position of bump solutions. The main impact of spatial\nheterogeneity is to break the translation symmetry of the network, so bumps\nprefer to reside at one of a finite number of local attractors in the domain.\nWith the reduced model in hand, we can then approximate the dynamics of the\nbump position using a continuous time Markov chain model that describes bump\nmotion between local attractors. While heterogeneity reduces the effective\ndiffusion of the bumps, it also disrupts the processing of velocity inputs by\nslowing the velocity-induced propagation of bumps. However, we demonstrate that\nnoise can play a constructive role by promoting bump motion transitions,\nrestoring a mean bump velocity that is close to the input velocity.\n", "  We present a brief survey of some results on electroweak properties of\ncomposite systems that are obtained in the frameworks of our version of the\ninstant form of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM). Our approach describes\nwell the $\\pi$- and the $\\rho$- mesons in wide range of momentum transfers\n$Q^{2}$. At large $Q^{2}$ the obtained pion form factor asymptotics coincides\nwith that of QCD predictions. The method permits to perform analytic\ncontinuation of pion form factor to complex plane of momentum transfers that is\nin accordance with predictions of quantum field theory.\n", "  The most commonly used index of stellar magnetic activity is the instrumental\nflux scale of singly-ionized calcium H & K line core emission, S, developed by\nthe Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) HK Project, or the derivative index R'_HK.\nAccurately placing the Sun on the S scale is important for comparing solar\nactivity to that of the Sun-like stars. We present previously unpublished\nmeasurements of the reflected sunlight from the Moon using the\nsecond-generation MWO HK photometer during solar cycle 23 and determine cycle\nminimum S_min,23 = 0.1634 +/- 0.0008, amplitude Delta S_23 = 0.0143 +/- 0.0012,\nand mean <S_23> = 0.1701 +/- 0.0005. By establishing a proxy relationship with\nthe closely related National Solar Observatory Sacramento Peak calcium K\nemission index, itself well-correlated with the Kodaikanal Observatory plage\nindex, we extend the MWO S time series to cover cycles 15-24 and find on\naverage <S_min> = 0.1621 +/- 0.0008, <Delta S_cyc> = 0.0145 +/- 0.0012, <S_cyc>\n= 0.1694 +/- 0.0005. Our measurements represent an improvement over previous\nestimates which relied on stellar measurements or solar proxies with\nnon-overlapping time series. We find good agreement from these results with\nmeasurements by the Solar-Stellar Spectrograph at Lowell Observatory, an\nindependently calibrated instrument, which gives us additional confidence that\nwe have accurately placed the Sun on the S-index flux scale.\n", "  We study the entropy of Chinese and English texts, based on characters in\ncase of Chinese texts and based on words for both languages. Significant\ndifferences are found between the languages and between different personal\nstyles of debating partners. The entropy analysis points in the direction of\nlower entropy, that is of higher complexity. Such a text analysis would be\napplied for individuals of different styles, a single individual at different\nage, as well as different groups of the population.\n", "  We present the first results of the Gould's Belt Distances Survey (GOBELINS),\na project aimed at measuring the proper motion and trigonometric parallax of a\nlarge sample of young stars in nearby regions using multi-epoch Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA) radio observations. Enough VLBA detections have now been\nobtained for 16 stellar systems in Ophiuchus to derive their parallax and\nproper motion. This leads to distance determinations for individual stars with\nan accuracy of 0.3 to a few percent. In addition, the orbits of 6 multiple\nsystems were modelled by combining absolute positions with VLBA (and in some\ncases, near infrared) angular separations. Twelve stellar systems are located\nin the dark cloud Lynds 1688, the individual distances for this sample are\nhighly consistent with one another, and yield a mean parallax for Lynds 1688 of\n$\\varpi=7.28\\pm0.06$ mas, corresponding to a distance $d=137.3\\pm1.2$ pc. This\nrepresents an accuracy better than 1%. Three systems for which astrometric\nelements could be measured are located in the eastern streamer (Lynds 1689) and\nyield an estimate of $\\varpi=6.79\\pm0.16$ mas, corresponding to a distance\n$d=147.3\\pm3.4$ pc. This suggests that the eastern streamer is located about 10\npc farther than the core, but this conclusion needs to be confirmed by\nobservations (currently being collected) of additional sources in the eastern\nstreamer. From the measured proper motions, we estimate the one-dimensional\nvelocity dispersion in Lynds 1688 to be 2.8$\\pm$1.8 and 3.0$\\pm$2.0 ${\\rm\nkm~s}^{-1}$, in R.A. and DEC., respectively, these are larger than, but still\nconsistent within $1\\sigma$, with those found in other studies.\n", "  We report on the fabrication and measurement results of the electrical\ntransport properties of superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) weak\nlinks, made of PbIn superconductor and Au metal. The maximum supercurrent\nreaches up to ~ 6 \\mu A at T = 2.3 K and the supercurrent persists even at\nhigher temperature of T = 4.7 K. Magnetic field dependence of the critical\ncurrent is consistent with a theoretical fit using the narrow junction model.\nThe superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was also fabricated\nusing two PbIn-Au-PbIn junctions connected in parallel. Under perpendicular\nmagnetic field, we clearly observed periodic oscillations of dV/dI with a\nperiod of magnetic flux quantum threading into the supercurrent loop of the\nSQUID. Our fabrication methods would provide an easy and simple way to explore\nthe superconducting proximity effects without ultra-low-temperature cryostats.\n", "  In this paper we give estimates for the proton--proton cross sections into\npairs of quarkonium states $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and\n$\\Upsilon(2S)$ at the scheduled AFTER@LHC energy of $115$GeV. The estimates are\nbased on the intrinsic heavy flavor mechanism which is observable for high\nvalues of $x_F$, a range outside the dominance of single parton and double\nparton scattering.\n", "  The possibility of in-memory computing with volatile memristive devices,\nnamely, memristors requiring a power source to sustain their memory, is\ndemonstrated. We have adopted a hysteretic graphene-based field emission\nstructure as a prototype of volatile memristor, which is characterized by a\nnon-pinched hysteresis loop. Memristive model of the structure is developed and\nused to simulate a polymorphic circuit implementing in-memory computing gates\nsuch as the material implication. Specific regions of parameter space realizing\nuseful logic functions are identified. Our results are applicable to other\nrealizations of volatile memory devices.\n", "  The Newton limit of gravity is studied in the presence of Lorentz-violating\ngravitational operators of arbitrary mass dimension. The linearized modified\nEinstein equations are obtained and the perturbative solutions are constructed\nand characterized. We develop a formalism for data analysis in laboratory\nexperiments testing gravity at short range and demonstrate that these tests\nprovide unique sensitivity to deviations from local Lorentz invariance.\n", "  We present the next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to\nthe top quark pair production associated with a hard photon at the current and\nfuture hadron colliders. The dependence of the leading order (LO) and NLO EW\ncorrected cross sections on the photon transverse momentum cut are\ninvestigated. We also provide the LO and NLO EW corrected distributions of the\ntransverse momentum of final top quark and photon and the invariant mass of top\nquark pair and top-antitop-photon system. The results show that the NLO EW\ncorrections are significant in high energy regions due to the EW Sudakov\neffect.\n", "  The aim of the Asteroid Science Intersections with In-Space Mine Engineering\n(ASIME) 2016 conference on September 21-22, 2016 in Luxembourg City was to\nprovide an environment for the detailed discussion of the specific properties\nof asteroids, with the engineering needs of space missions that utilize\nasteroids.\n  The ASIME 2016 Conference produced a layered record of discussions from the\nasteroid scientists and the asteroid miners to understand each other's key\nconcerns and to address key scientific questions from the asteroid mining\ncompanies: Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries and TransAstra. These\nQuestions were the focus of the two day conference, were addressed by\nscientists inside and outside of the ASIME Conference and are the focus of this\nWhite Paper.\n  The Questions from the asteroid mining companies have been sorted into the\nthree asteroid science themes: 1) survey, 2) surface and 3) subsurface and 4)\nOther. The answers to those Questions have been provided by the scientists with\ntheir conference presentations or edited directly into an early open-access\ncollaborative Google document (August 2016-October 2016), or inserted by A.\nGraps using additional reference materials. During the ASIME 2016 last\ntwo-hours, the scientists turned the Questions from the Asteroid Miners around\nby presenting their own key concerns: Questions from the Asteroid Scientists .\nThese answers in this White Paper will point to the Science Knowledge Gaps\n(SKGs) for advancing the asteroid in-space resource utilisation domain.\n", "  We present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the\nGalactic Bulge Survey X-ray source CXOGBS J174954.5-294335 (hereafter, referred\nto as CX19). CX19 is a long period, eclipsing intermediate polar type\ncataclysmic variable with broad, single-peaked Balmer and Paschen emission\nlines along with HeII $\\lambda4686$ and Bowen blend emission features. With\ncoverage of one full and two partial eclipses and archival photometry, we\ndetermine the ephemeris for CX19 to be HJD(eclipse) = 2455691.8581(5) +\n0.358704(2)$\\times$N. We also recovered the white dwarf spin period of P$_{\\rm\nspin}$ = 503.32(3) seconds which gives a P$_{\\rm spin}$/P$_{\\rm orb}$ =\n0.016(6), comparable to several confirmed, long period intermediate polars.\nCX19 also shows a clear X-ray eclipse in the 0.3-8.0 keV range observed with\nChandra. Two optical outbursts were observed lasting between 6-8 hours (lower\nlimits) reaching $\\sim$1.3 mags in amplitude. The outbursts, both in duration\nand magnitude, the accretion disc dominated spectra and hard X-ray emission are\nreminiscent of the intermediate polar V1223 Sgr sharing many of the same\ncharacteristics. If we assume a main sequence companion, we estimate the donor\nto be an early G-type star and find a minimum distance of $d \\approx$ 2.1 kpc\nand a 0.5-10.0 keV X-ray luminosity upper limit of 2.0 $\\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. Such an X-ray luminosity is consistent with a white dwarf accretor in\na magnetic cataclysmic variable system. To date, CX19 is only the second\ndeeply-eclipsing intermediate polar with X-ray eclipses and the first which is\noptically accessible.\n", "  We investigate the gap in the single-electron spectrum of twisted bilayer\ngraphene. In a perfect infinite lattice of a twisted bilayer, the gap varies\nexponentially in response to weak changes of the twist angle. Such a large\nsensitivity makes theoretical predictions of the gap nearly impossible, since\nexperimentally the twist angle is always known with finite accuracy. To address\nthis issue, we numerically study finite clusters of twisted bilayer graphene.\nFor finite systems, changing the twist angle causes a gradual crossover between\ngapless and gapped regimes. The crossover occurs when the finite-size\nquantization energy becomes comparable to the matrix elements responsible for\nthe generation of the gap. We further argue that disorder scattering can induce\nsimilar crossover, in which the mean-free path plays the same role as the\nsystem size for the finite clusters. It is demonstrated that, to observe the\ngap experimentally, it is necessary to have a sample of suitable purity, and to\npossess the ability to tune the twist angle accurately.\n", "  We present the analysis of the archival Suzaku and Swift X-ray observations\nof the young $\\gamma$-ray pulsar J1932+1916 field. The data revealed a\npoint-like object at the $\\gamma$-ray position of the pulsar and diffuse X-ray\nemission around it. Spectra of the point-like source and diffuse emission are\nwell-described by absorbed power-law models with spectral parameters typical\nfor pulsar plus pulsar wind nebula systems. Therefore we suggest that Suzaku\nand Swift detected the X-ray counterpart of PSR J1932+1916. Assuming this\ninterpretation, we constrain the distance to the pulsar in the range of 2-6\nkpc. We also suggest possible association of the pulsar with the nearby\nsupernova remnant G54.4-0.3 and discuss its implications for the pulsar proper\nmotion, age and distance.\n", "  The question how complex systems become more organized and efficient with\ntime is open. Examples are, the formation of elementary particles from pure\nenergy, the formation of atoms from particles, the formation of stars and\ngalaxies, the formation of molecules from atoms, of organisms, and of the\nsociety. In this sequence, order appears inside complex systems and randomness\n(entropy) is expelled to their surroundings. Key features of self-organizing\nsystems are that they are open and they are far away from equilibrium, with\nincreasing energy flowing through them. This work searches for global measures\nof such self-organizing systems, that are predictable and do not depend on the\nsubstrate of the system studied. Our results will help to understand the\nexistence of complex systems and mechanisms of self-organization. In part we\nalso provide insights, in this work, about the underlying physical essence of\nthe Moore's law and the multiple logistic growth observed in technological\nprogress.\n", "  The assumption that the production of quark-antiquark pairs and their\nsequential string-breaking taking place through the event horizon of the color\nconfinement determines freezeout temperature and gives a plausible\ninterpretation of the thermal pattern of pp and AA collisions. When relating\nthe black-hole electric charges to the baryon-chemical potentials it was found\nthat the phenomenologically-deduced parameters from various particle ratios in\nthe statistical thermal models agree well with the ones determined from the\nthermal radiation from charged black-hole. Accordingly, the resulting freezeout\nconditions, such as $s/T^3=7$ and $<E>/<N>=1~$GeV, are confirmed at finite\nchemical potentials, as well. Furthermore, the problematic of strangeness\nproduction in elementary collisions can be interpreted by thermal particle\nproduction from the Hawking-Unruh radiation. Consequently, the freezeout\ntemperature depends on the quark masses. This leads to a deviation from full\nequilibrium and thus a suppression of the strangeness production in the\nelementary collisions. But in nucleus-nucleus collisions, an average\ntemperature should be introduced in order to dilute the quark masses. This\nnearly removes the strangeness suppression. An extension to finite chemical\npotentials is introduced. The particle ratios of kaon-to-pion, phi-to-kaon and\nantilambda-to-pion are determined from Hawking-Unruh radiation and compared\nwith the thermal calculations and the measurements in different experiments. We\nconclude that these particle ratios can be reproduced, at least qualitatively,\nas Hawking-Unruh radiation at finite chemical potential. With increasing\nenergy, both K+/pi+ and phi/K^- keep their maximum values at low SPS energies.\nBut the further energy decrease rapidly reduces both ratios. For Lambda/pi-,\nthere is an increase with increasing collision energy, i.e. no saturation is to\nbe observed.\n", "  Using novel instrumentation to combine extreme conditions of intense pulsed\nmagnetic field up to 60~T and high pressure up to 4~GPa, we have established\nthe three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field - pressure - temperature phase\ndiagram of a pure stoichiometric heavy-fermion antiferromagnet\n(CeRh$_2$Si$_2$). We find a temperature- and pressure-dependent decoupling of\nthe critical and pseudo-metamagnetic fields, at the borderlines of\nantiferromagnetism and strongly-correlated paramagnetism. This 3D phase diagram\nis representative of a class of heavy-fermion Ising antiferromagnets, where\nlong-range magnetic ordering is decoupled from a maximum in the magnetic\nsusceptibility. The combination of extreme conditions enabled us to\ncharacterize different quantum phase transitions, where peculiar quantum\ncritical properties are revealed. The interest to couple the effects of\nmagnetic field and pressure on quantum-critical correlated-electron systems is\nstressed.\n", "  We investigate the spherically symmetric 1D ablation problem. We show that\nthe parabolic heat equation fails to describe the approach to steady state in\ninfinite space. The hyperbolic equation shows an approach to steady state with\na time constant given by the thermal relaxation time. However the infinite\ngeometry is rather unphysical and gives rise to a so-called zero mode.\nTherefore we also consider the finite problem with a large boundary at constant\ntemperature. Then both equations show approach to steady state, but only the\nhyperbolic equation seems to be physically correct for small times.\n", "  The Morgan-Morgan-Finney (MMF) model is a widely used semi-physically based\nsoil erosion model that has been tested and validated in various land use types\nand climatic regions. The latest version of the model, the modified MMF (MMMF)\nmodel, improved its conceptual physical representations through several\nmodifications of the original model. However, the MMMF model has three\nproblematic parts to be corrected: 1) the effective rainfall equation, 2) the\ninterflow equation, and 3) the improperly normalized C-factor of the transport\ncapacity equation. In this commentary, we identify and correct the problematic\nparts of the MMMF model, which should result in more accurate estimations of\nrunoff and soil erosion rates.\n", "  Context: The rotation history of the Crab Pulsar is well described by (1) a\nrotation frequency $\\nu$ and a slowdown model that is specified by its first\ntwo time derivatives $\\dot \\nu$ and $\\ddot \\nu$, known as the secular slowdown\nmodel, (2) occasional (once in $\\approx 2$ years) significant and abrupt\nincreases in the magnitude of $\\nu$ and $\\dot \\nu$ (occurring on timescales of\nminutes), known as glitches, and (3) much slower increases and decreases in\n$\\nu$ and $\\dot \\nu$ (occurring over months and years) that are an order of\nmagnitude smaller, known as timing noise.\n  Aims: This work reports a speed-up event in the Crab Pulsar that occurred\naround $2015$ February that is distinct from glitches and timing noise.\n  Methods: Monthly $\\nu$s and $\\dot \\nu$s of the Crab Pulsar, obtained at radio\nfrequencies and published by Jodrell Bank Observatory (JBO), are used to\ndemonstrate the speed-up event. Monthly arrival times of the Crab Pulsar's\npulse, also published by JBO, combined with X-ray data from the RXTE, SWIFT,\nand NUSTAR observatories are used to verify the result.\n  Results: The speed-up event is caused by a persistent increase in $\\dot \\nu$,\nwhich results in a monotonic increase in $\\nu$. Over the last $\\approx 550$\ndays, $\\nu$ has increased monotonically by an amount that is $\\approx 10$ times\nlarger than the timing noise level.\n  Conclusions: This is a unique event in the Crab Pulsar. This is probably due\nto a small increase in the Crab Pulsar's internal temperature. In its absence,\nthe next large glitch in the Crab Pulsar is expected to occur around $2019$\nMarch. However, this event could have an important bearing on its occurrence.\n", "  The identification of a solution to the dark matter problem has many arrows\nto its bow: if dark matter is a new elementary particle, both laboratory\nexperiments and astrophysics can bring relevant and complementary pieces of\ninformation, that than can be confronted and composed to solve this intriguing\npuzzle. Although we currently do not have a unique and obvious target for the\nDM particle, we can rely on a broad range of ideas, tools and methods that make\nthe investigation of dark matter a multi-frequency, multi-messenger and\nmulti-techniques integrated endeavour.\n", "  Nonlinear model of diffusive shock acceleration is used for investigation of\nthe particle acceleration in old supernova remnants W28 and W44. We modeled the\nhydrodynamical evolution of the remnants, shock modification and streaming\ninstability produced by accelerated particles. Comparison with available radio\nand gamma-ray data is given.\n", "  In this paper we define a kind of decomposition for a quantum access\nstructure. We propose a conception of minimal maximal quantum access structure\nand obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for minimal maximal quantum\naccess structure, which shows the relationship between the number of minimal\nauthorized sets and that of the players. Moreover, we investigate the\nconstruction of efficient quantum secret schemes by using these techniques, a\ndecomposition and minimal maximal quantum access structure. A major advantage\nof these techniques is that it allows us to construct a method to realize a\ngeneral quantum access structure. For these quantum access structures, we\npresent two quantum secret schemes via the idea of concatenation or a\ndecomposition of a quantum access structure. As a consequence, the application\nof these techniques allow us to save more quantum shares and reduce more cost\nthan the existing scheme.\n", "  In this paper we study the occurrence of accelerating universe versus\ndecelerating universe between the F(R) gravity frame (Jordan frame) and\nnon-minimally coupled scalar field theory frame, and the minimally coupled\nscalar field theory frame (Einstein frame) for various models. As we show, if\nacceleration is imposed in one frame, it will not necessarily correspond to an\naccelerating metric when transformed in another frame. As we will demonstrate,\nthis issue is model and frame-dependent but it seems there is no general scheme\nwhich permits to classify such cases.\n", "  We have obtained the Vlasov equation and Boltzmann kinetic equation using\nPoisson bracket (classical Hamilton equation) and Rindler Hamiltonian. Further,\nwe treat the whole Universe as a statistical system with galaxies as the point\nparticle constituents in large scale structure. Since the collisions of\ngalaxies are very rare phenomena, we assume that the gas with the constituents\nas point galaxies satisfy Vlasov equation. Considering the astrophysical\ncatastrophic event, e.g., the creation of gravity waves by the collisions of\nblack holes, and further assuming that when such a wave passes through the gas\ncauses a kind of polarization of mass distribution. This polarization of mass\ndistribution will further gives rise to gravitational permittivity or\ndielectric constant. We have shown that the low frequency gravity waves will be\nabsorbed, whereas the high frequency part will pass through the gas of point\ngalaxies. It is further noticed that the region in space with extremely high\ngravitational field is transparent to gravity waves. In the other part of this\nwork, using the Boltzmann equation and replacing the collision term by the\nrelaxation time approximation and further assuming a small deviation from the\nequilibrium configuration of the stellar / galactic plasma in Rindler space, we\nhave obtained the kinetic coefficients. For the first time we have derived an\nexpression for the coefficient of gravitational flow. It has further been shown\nthat in presence of strong gravitational field all the kinetic coefficients\nbecome vanishingly small.\n", "  We provide a sphere-packing lower bound for the optimal error probability in\nfinite blocklengths when coding over a symmetric classical-quantum channel. Our\nresult shows that the pre-factor can be significantly improved from the order\nof the subexponential to the polynomial. The established pre-factor is\nessentially optimal because it matches the best known random coding upper bound\nin the classical case. Our approaches rely on a sharp concentration inequality\nin strong large deviation theory and crucial properties of the error-exponent\nfunction.\n", "  We consider the inclusive top quark distributions in $e^+e^-\\to\nt_{L,R}+\\rm{anything}$. We analyze the modifications of the basic SM\ncontributions which would result from $t_{R}$ compositeness for example from\nthe presence of form factors in the $t_{R}$ couplings and of an effective top\nmass $m_t(s)$. We also look at parton like contributions representing\nadditional new particle production related to $t_{R}$ constituents. One\nobserves a large sensitivity of the $t_{R}$ inclusive distribution to these\nvarious effects with specific shapes differing from those of the $t_{L}$\ndistribution and we show that these effects may even be also observable in the\nunpolarized top case.\n", "  A fully (pseudo-)spectral solver for direct numerical simulations of\nlarge-scale turbulent channel flows is described. The solver utilizes the\nChebyshev base functions suggested by J. Shen [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 16, 1,\n1995], that lead to stable and robust numerical schemes, even at very large\nscale. New and fast algorithms for the direct solution of the linear systems\nare devised, and algorithms and matrices for all required scalar products and\ntransforms are provided. We validate the solver for very high Reynolds numbers.\nSpecifically, the solver is shown to reproduce the first order statistics of\nHoyas and Jim\\'{e}nez [Phys. Fluids, 18(1), 2006], for a channel flow at\n$Re_{\\tau}=2000$. The solver is available through the open source project\nspectralDNS [https://github.com/spectralDNS].\n", "  We examine the optical photometric and polarimetric variability of the\nluminous type 1 non-blazar quasar 3C 323.1 (PG 1545+210). Two optical\nspectro-polarimetric measurements taken during the periods 1996$-$98 and 2003\ncombined with a $V$-band imaging polarimetric measurement taken in 2002 reveal\nthat (1) as noted in the literature, the polarization of 3C 323.1 is confined\nonly to the continuum emission, that is, the emission from the broad line\nregion is unpolarized; (2) the polarized flux spectra show evidence of a\ntime-variable broad absorption feature in the wavelength range of the Balmer\ncontinuum and other recombination lines; (3) weak variability in the\npolarization position angle ($PA$) of $\\sim$ 4 deg over a time-scale of 4$-$6\nyears is observed; and (4) the V-band total flux and the polarized flux show\nhighly correlated variability over a time-scale of one year. Taking the\nabove-mentioned photometric and polarimetric variability properties and the\nresults from previous studies into consideration, we propose a geometrical\nmodel for the polarization source in 3C 323.1, in which an equatorial absorbing\nregion and an axi-asymmetric equatorial electron-scattering region are assumed\nto be located between the accretion disc and the broad line region. The\nscattering/absorbing regions can perhaps be attributed to the accretion disc\nwind or flared disc surface, but further polarimetric monitoring observations\nfor 3C~323.1 and other quasars with continuum-confined polarization are needed\nto probe the true physical origins of these regions.\n", "  A microscopic basis is provided for the spin-fermion model used to describe\nthe physics of the underdoped cuprates. In this way, a spin-fermion coupling is\nshown to take care of the local no double occupancy constraint, which is\nignored in the weakly coupled regime. This ingredient is proved to be essential\nto capture the physics of strong correlations, however. We elaborate further on\nour recent proposal for the strong-coupling version of the spin-fermion model\nthat may prove to be the correct starting point to deal with the strong\ncorrelation physics displayed by the underdoped cuprates.\n", "  In this work we investigate a inflationary scenario generated by a large\nscalar field $\\phi$ that non-minimally couples to a $f(R)$ modified gravity\nmodel. For a Starobinsky's like model, it is found that along a particular flat\ndirection, the scalar potential takes a simple form $V = (M_p^4/4)\n[V(\\phi)/\\alpha(\\phi)^2]$ where $\\alpha(\\phi)$ is a non-minimal coupling to\nRicci scalar $R$ in the model. The inflation, therefore, is effectively\nrepresented as a single field inflaton scenario. For a specific example, such\nas a scalar potential $V(\\phi) = \\mu_1\\phi^2 + \\mu_2\\phi^4$, we found that the\npredictions match nicely in the $1\\sigma$ confidence level of \\textit{Plank}\nTT, TE, EE+lowP combination data of Planck 2015 CMB data for $ 0<\\mu_3 \\leq\n100$, where $\\mu_3 := |\\mu_1|/(\\mu_2 M_p^2)$. For example, taking $\\mu_3 =\n0.01$ the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r=0.0004$ and and spectral index $n_s =\n0.96985$ for $N_\\ast = 50$ while taking $\\mu_3 = 100.0$ produces $r= 0.03$ and\n$n_s = 0.96359$ for $N_\\ast = 60$.\n", "  The dual-axis radiography for hydrodynamic testing (DARHT) facility at Los\nAlamos National Laboratory uses two electron linear-induction accelerators\n(LIA) to produce the source spots for perpendicular flash radiographs of a\ndynamic experiment.Manipulating the beam current is a means for adjusting the\ndose, and one way to do this is to change the size of the cathode. This article\ndescribes simulations undertaken to develop scaling laws for use as design\ntools in changing the Axis-1 beam current by changing the cathode size.\n", "  We study Coulomb branch moduli spaces of a class of three dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories whose quiver satisfies the balance condition.\nThe Coulomb branch is described by dressed monopole operators which can be\ncounted using the Monopole formula. We mainly focus on A-type quivers in this\npaper, using Hilbert Series to study their moduli spaces, and present the\ninteresting pattern which emerges. All of these balanced A-type quiver gauge\ntheories can be realized on brane intervals in Type IIB string theory, where\nmirror symmetry acts by exchanging the five branes and induces an equivalence\nbetween Coulomb branch and Higgs branch of mirror pairs. For each theory, we\nexplicitly discuss the gauge invariant generators on the Higgs branch and the\nrelations they satisfy. Finally, some analysis on $D_4$ balanced quivers also\npresents an interesting structure of their moduli spaces.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the use of subwavelength optical nanoantennae\nto assist the gentle ablation of nanostructures directly using ultralow fluence\nfrom a Ti: sapphire oscillator through the excitation of surface plasmon waves.\nWe show that this ablation mechanism is the same for metal and dielectric. The\nanalytical solutions of ablation threshold are in excellent agreement with the\nexperiment estimations. Surface plasmon assisted locally enhanced ablation at\nnanoscale provides a method for nanomachining, manipulation and modification\nthe nanostructures without collateral thermal damage to the materials. It is\nalso shown that this ablation can deposit low-density high quality thin nano\nfilm.\n", "  Using a particle-in-cell (PIC) code, we investigated the possibilities for\nemittance growth through the quadrupole magnets of the system used to transport\nthe high-current electron beam from an induction accelerator to the\nbremsstrahlung converter target used for flash radiography. We found that even\nhighly mismatched beams exhibited little emittance growth (< 6%), which we\nattribute to softening of their initial hard edge current distributions. We\nalso used this PIC code to evaluate the accuracy of emittance measurements\nusing a solenoid focal scan following the quadrupole magnets. If the beam is\nround after the solenoids, the simulations indicate that the measurement is\nhighly accurate, but it is substantially inaccurate for elliptical beams.\n", "  Isolating the singularity in the Green's function solution of the\ninhomogeneous, differential equation for the Stermheimer function of a layered\nelectron gas, permits the construction of an approximate solution of the\nStermheimer function which includes the exact contributions from its\nsingularities.\n", "  Current investigations into pedagogical goals of introductory algebra-based\nphysics students at the University of Central Arkansas, by learning orientation\ntowards an in-class metacognitive group problem solving task, seek to determine\npossible relationships with attitudinal shifts and course performance. Students\nthus far have been untreated with known group-based learning pedagogies, so as\nto establish trends of common group habits, and ultimately to properly inform\nimplementation of group-based pedagogies in reaction to these trends. However,\nstudents' group dynamics and learning orientations prove difficult to map to\ngroup-based measurements; an estimate of group learning orientation and\npreferred working group dynamic is here explored as a potential means of\ninterpreting students' use of problem solving strategies. A means of \"sampling\"\naudiovisual data in a live classroom of several simultaneous groups is also\npresented as a way to estimate the frequency of chosen strategies to this end.\n", "  We present a new inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation\nfor estimating parameters governing an entire network based on link-traced\nsamples of that network. To do this, we first take summary statistics from an\nobserved link-traced network sample, such as a recruitment network of subjects\nin a hard-to-reach population. Then we assume prior distributions, such as\nmultivariate uniform, for the distribution of some parameters governing the\nstructure of the network and behaviour of its nodes. Then, we draw many\nindependent and identically distributed values for these parameters. For each\nset of values, we simulate a population network, take a link-traced sample from\nthat network, and find the summary statistics for that sample. The statistics\nfrom the sample, and the parameters that eventually led to that sample, are\ncollectively treated as a single point. We take a Kernel Density estimate of\nthe points from many simulations, and observe the density across the hyperplane\ncoinciding with the statistic values of the originally observed sample. This\ndensity function is treat as a posterior estimate of the paramaters of the\nnetwork that provided the observed sample.\n  We also apply this method to a network of precedence citations between legal\ndocuments, centered around cases overseen by the Supreme Court of Canada, is\nobserved. The features of certain cases that lead to their frequent citation\nare inferred, and their effects estimated by ABC. Future work and extensions\nare also briefly discussed.\n", "  Hand-crafted features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic\nresonance images (DCE-MRIs) have shown strong predictive abilities in\ncharacterization of breast lesions. However, heterogeneity across medical image\ndatasets hinders the generalizability of these features. One of the sources of\nthe heterogeneity is the variation of MR scanner magnet strength, which has a\nstrong influence on image quality, leading to variations in the extracted image\nfeatures. Thus, statistical decision algorithms need to account for such data\nheterogeneity. Despite the variations, we hypothesize that there exist\nunderlying relationships between the features extracted from the datasets\nacquired with different magnet strength MR scanners. We compared the use of a\nmulti-task learning (MTL) method that incorporates those relationships during\nthe classifier training to support vector machines run on a merged dataset that\nincludes cases with various MRI strength images. As a result, higher predictive\npower is achieved with the MTL method.\n", "  We use the Dirac equation in a fixed black hole background and different\nindependent techniques to demonstrate the absence of fermionic bound states\naround a Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we show that no embedded\neigenvalues exist which have been claimed for the case when the energy is less\nthan the particle's mass. We explicitly prove that the claims regarding the\nembedded eigenvalues can be traced back to an oversimplified approximation in\nthe calculation. We conclude that no bound states exist regardless the value of\nthe mass.\n", "  In the present paper, we study the thermodynamics behavior of the field\nequations for the generalized f(T) gravity with an arbitrary coupling between\nmatter and the torsion scalar. In this regard, we explore the verification of\nthe first law of thermodynamics at the ap- parent horizon of the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universe in two different perspectives namely the\nnon-equilibrium and equilibrium de- scriptions of thermodynamics. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the valid- ity of the second law of thermodynamics for both\ndescriptions of this scenario with assumption that the temperature of matter\ninside the horizon is similar to that of horizon.\n", "  Stable luminescent pi-radicals with doublet emission have aroused a growing\ninterest for functional molecular materials. We have demonstrated a neutral\npi-radical dye\n(4-N-carbazolyl-2,6-dichlorophenyl)bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)-methyl (TTM-1Cz)\nwith remarkable doublet emission, which could be used as triplet sensitizer to\ninitiate the photophysical process of triplet-triplet annihilation photon\nupconversion (TTA-UC). Dexter-like excited doublet-triplet energy transfer\n(DTET) was confirmed by theoretical calculation. A mixed solution of TTM-1Cz\nand aromatic emitters could ambidextrous upconvert red light to cyan light or\ngreen light = 532 nm) to blue light. This finding of DTET phenomena provides a\nnew perspective in designing new triplet sensitizer for TTA-UC.\n", "  It has been accepted that the polarization of the photon in vector beams is\nentangled with its momentum. Here a quantum description is advanced for the\npolarization that shows entanglement with the momentum. This is done by showing\nthat the Jones vector at each value of the momentum plays the role of the\npolarization wavefunction in the sense that the Pauli matrices represent the\nCartesian components of the polarization in the local reference system with\nrespect to which the Jones vector is defined. The unit vector that the\nconstraint of transversality condition requires to specify the local reference\nsystem turns out to be a gauge degree of freedom that determines the\nentanglement of the polarization with the momentum and has observable effects.\n", "  We present briefly the first results obtained by the application of the\nKYNREFREV-reverberation model, which is ready for its use in XSPEC. This model\ncomputes the time dependent reflection spectra of the disc as a response to a\nflash of primary power-law radiation from a point source corona located on the\naxis of the black-hole accretion disc. The assumptions of the model are:\ncentral Kerr black hole, surrounded by a Keplerian, geometrically thin,\noptically thick, ionised disc with the possibility of defining the radial\ndensity profile and a stationary hot point-like patch of plasma located on the\nsystem rotation axis and emitting isotropic power-law radiation (lamp-post\ngeometry). Full relativistic ray-tracing code in vacuum is used for photon\npaths from the corona to the disc and to the observer and from the disc to the\nobserver. The ionisation of the disc is set for each radius according to the\namount of the incident primary flux and the density of the accretion disc. In\nthis paper we comment on some preliminary results obtained through the analysis\nof X-ray reverberation time-lags from 1H 0707-495 and IRAS 13224-3809.\n", "  After a short review of the classical Lie theorem, a finite dimensional Lie\nalgebra of vector fields is considered and the most general conditions under\nwhich the integral curves of one of the fields can be obtained by quadratures\nin a prescribed way will be discussed, determining also the number of\nquadratures needed to integrate the system. The theory will be illustrated with\nexamples andbn an extension of the theorem where the Lie algebras are replaced\nby some distributions will also be presented.\n", "  A new method of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) for BEGe detectors is\ndeveloped to suppress Compton-continuum by digital pulse shape analysis (PSA),\nwhich helps reduce the Compton background level in gamma ray spectrometry. A\ndecision parameter related to the rise time of a pulse shape was presented. The\nmethod was verified by experiments using 60Co and 137Cs sources. The result\nindicated that the 60Co Peak to Compton ratio and the Cs-Peak to Co-Compton\nratio could be improved by more than two and three times, respectively.\n", "  The high quality data provided by helioseismology, solar neutrino flux\nmeasurements, spectral determination of solar abundances, nuclear reactions\nrates coefficients among other experimental data, leads to the highly accurate\nprediction of the internal structure of the present Sun - the standard solar\nmodel. In this talk, I have discussed how the standard solar model, the best\nrepresentation of the real Sun, can be used to study the properties of dark\nmatter, for which two complementary approaches have been developed: - to limit\nthe number of theoretical candidates proposed as the dark matter particles,\nthis analysis complements the experimental search of dark matter, and - as a\ntemplate for the study of the impact of dark matter in the evolution of stars,\nwhich possibly occurs for stellar populations formed in regions of high density\nof dark matter, such as stars formed in the centre of galaxies and the first\ngenerations of stars.\n", "  So far, direct detection searches have come empty handed in their quest for\nDark Matter (DM). Meanwhile, asteroseismology arises as a complementary tool to\nstudy DM, as its accumulation in a star can enhance energy transport, by\nproviding a conduction mechanism, producing significant changes in the stellar\nstructure during the course of the star's evolution. The stellar core,\nparticularly affected by the presence of DM, can be investigated through\nprecise asteroseismic diagnostics. We modelled three stars including DM energy\ntransport: the Sun, a slightly less massive and much older star, KIC 7871531\n($0.85 \\, M_{\\odot}$, $9.41 \\, \\text{Gyr}$), and a more massive and younger\none, KIC 8379927 ($1.12 \\, M_{\\odot}$, $1.82 \\, \\text{Gyr}$). We considered\nboth the case of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles, albeit with a low\nannihilation, and the case of Asymmetric DM for which the number of trapped\nparticles in the star can be much greater. By analysing these models with\nasteroseismic separation ratios weighted towards the core, we found indications\nlimiting the effective spin-dependent DM-proton coupling for masses of a few\nGeV. This independent result is very close to the most recent and most\nstringent direct detection DM constraints.\n", "  Recently, a simple and elegant \"dimple\" model was introduced by McMeeking et\nal. (Adv Eng Mat 12(5), 389-397, 2010) to show a mechanism for a bistable\nadhesive system involving a surface with a shallow depression. The system\nshows, at least for intermediate levels of stickiness, that external pressure\ncan switch the system into a \"strong adhesive\" regime of full contact, or into\nweak adhesion and complete pull-off, similarly to the contact of surfaces with\na single scale of periodical waviness. We add to this model the effect of\nroughness, in the simple form of axisymmetric single scale of waviness,\npermitting a very detailed study, and we show that this induces a resistance to\njumping into full contact on one hand (limiting the \"strong adhesion\" regime),\nand an enhancement of pull-off and of hysteresis starting from the partial\ncontact state on the other (enhancing the \"weak adhesion\" regime). We show the\nsystem depends only on two dimensionless parameters, depending on the ratio of\nwork of adhesion to the energy to flatten the dimple or waviness, respectively.\nThe system becomes pressure-sensitive also in the intermediate states, as it is\nobserved in real adhesive rough systems. The model obviously is specular to the\nGuduru model of rough spheres (Guduru, JMPS, 55, 473--488, 2007), with which it\nshares the limitations of the analysis assuming a connected contact (crack)\narea, and serves also the purpose of showing the effect of a depression into an\notherwise periodic rough contact, towards the understanding of adhesion with\nmultiple scales of roughness.\n", "  We have derived exact axisymmetric solutions of the two-dimensional\nLane-Emden equations with rotation. These solutions are intrinsically favored\nby the differential equations regardless of any adopted boundary conditions and\nthe physical solutions of the Cauchy problem are bound to oscillate about and\nremain close to these intrinsic solutions. The isothermal solutions are\ndescribed by power-law density profiles in the radial direction, whereas the\npolytropic solutions are described by radial density profiles that are powers\nof the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind. Both families of\nsolutions decay exponentially in the vertical direction and both result in\nincreasing or nearly flat radial rotation curves. The results are applicable to\ngaseous spiral-galaxy disks that exhibit flat rotation curves and to the early\nstages of protoplanetary disk formation before the central star is formed.\n", "  Our computation effort is primarily concentrated on support of current and\nfuture measurements being carried out at various synchrotron radiation\nfacilities around the globe, and photodissociation computations for\nastrophysical applications. In our work we solve the Schr\\\"odinger or Dirac\nequation for the appropriate collision problem using the R-matrix or R-matrix\nwith pseudo-states approach from first principles. The time dependent\nclose-coupling (TDCC) method is also used in our work. A brief summary of the\nmethodology and ongoing developments implemented in the R-matrix suite of\nBreit-Pauli and Dirac-Atomic R-matrix codes (DARC) is presented.\n", "  The hypothesis is made that, at large scales where General Relativity may be\napplied, the empty space is scale invariant. This establishes a relation\nbetween the cosmological constant and the scale factor of the scale invariant\nframework. This relation brings major simplifications in the scale invariant\nequations for cosmology, which now contain a new term, depending on the\nderivative of the scale factor, that opposes to gravity and produces an\naccelerated expansion. The displacements due to the acceleration term make a\nhigh contribution Omega_l to the energy-density of the Universe, satisfying an\nequation of the form Omega_m+\\Omega_k+Omega_l = 1. The models do not demand the\nexistence of unknown particles. There is a family of flat models with different\ndensity parameters Omega_m < 1.\n  Numerical integrations of the cosmological equations for different values of\nthe curvature and density parameter k and Omega_m are performed. The presence\nof even tiny amounts of matter in the Universe tends to kill scale invariance.\nThe point is that for Omega_m = 0.3 the effect is not yet completely killed.\nThe models with non-zero density start explosively with first a braking phase\nfollowed by a continuously accelerating expansion. Several observational\nproperties are examined, in particular the distances, the m--z diagram, the\nOmega_m vs. lambda plot. Comparisons with observations are also performed for\nthe Hubble constant H_0 vs. Omega_m, for the expansion history in the plot\nH(z)/(z+1) vs. redshift z and for the transition redshift from braking to\nacceleration. These first dynamical tests are satisfied by the scale invariant\nmodels, which thus deserve further studies.\n", "  We studied electric current and noise in planar GaN nanowires (NWs). The\nresults obtained at low voltages provide us with estimates of the depletion\neffects in the NWs. For larger voltages, we observed the space-charge limited\ncurrent (SCLC) effect. The onset of the effect clearly correlates with the NW\nwidth. For narrow NWs the mature SCLC regime was achieved. This effect has\ngreat impact on fluctuation characteristics of studied NWs. At low voltages, we\nfound that the normalized noise level increases with decreasing NW width. In\nthe SCLC regime, a further increase in the normalized noise intensity (up to\n1E4 times) was observed, as well as a change in the shape of the spectra with a\ntendency towards slope -3/2. We suggest that the features of the electric\ncurrent and noise found in the NWs are of a general character and will have an\nimpact on the development of NW-based devices.\n", "  This article provides an introduction to and review of the field of\ncomputer-aided molecular design (CAMD). It is intended to be approachable for\nthe absolute beginner as well as useful to the seasoned CAMD practitioner. We\nbegin by discussing various quantitative structure-property relationships\n(QSPRs) which have been demonstrated to work well with CAMD problems. The\nmethods discussed in this article are (1) group contribution methods, (2)\ntopological indices, and (3) signature descriptors. Next, we present general\noptimization formulations for various forms of the CAMD problem. Common design\nconstraints are discussed and structural feasibility constraints are provided\nfor the three types of QSPRs addressed. We then detail useful techniques for\napproaching CAMD optimization problems, including decomposition methods,\nheuristic approaches, and mathematical programming strategies. Finally, we\ndiscuss many applications that have been addressed using CAMD.\n", "  Using a macroscopic approach, we studied theoretically the heat generation\ndue to spin transport in a typical spin valve with nonmagnetic spacer layer of\nfinite thickness. Our analysis shows that the spin-dependent heat generation\ncan also be caused by another mechanism, the spin-conserving scattering in the\npresence of spin accumulation gradient, in addition to the well-known spin-flip\nscattering. The two mechanisms have equal contributions in semi-infinite\nlayers, such as the ferromagnetic layers of the spin valve. However, in the\nnonmagnetic layer of a thickness much smaller than its spin-diffusion length,\nthe spin-dependent heat generation is dominated by the spin-flip scattering in\nthe antiparallel configuration, and by the spin-conserving scattering in the\nparallel configuration. We also proved that the spin-dependent heat generation\ncannot be interpreted as the Joule heating of the spin-coupled interface\nresistance in each individual layer. An effective resistance is proposed as an\nalternative so that the heat generation can still be described simply by\napplying Joule's law to an equivalent circuit.\n", "  While all organisms on Earth descend from a common ancestor, there is no\nconsensus on whether the origin of this ancestral self-replicator was a one-off\nevent or whether it was only the final survivor of multiple origins. Here we\nuse the digital evolution system Avida to study the origin of self-replicating\ncomputer programs. By using a computational system, we avoid many of the\nuncertainties inherent in any biochemical system of self-replicators (while\nrunning the risk of ignoring a fundamental aspect of biochemistry). We\ngenerated the exhaustive set of minimal-genome self-replicators and analyzed\nthe network structure of this fitness landscape. We further examined the\nevolvability of these self-replicators and found that the evolvability of a\nself-replicator is dependent on its genomic architecture. We studied the\ndifferential ability of replicators to take over the population when competed\nagainst each other (akin to a primordial-soup model of biogenesis) and found\nthat the probability of a self-replicator out-competing the others is not\nuniform. Instead, progenitor (most-recent common ancestor) genotypes are\nclustered in a small region of the replicator space. Our results demonstrate\nhow computational systems can be used as test systems for hypotheses concerning\nthe origin of life.\n", "  The fundamental understanding of loop formation of long polymer chains in\nsolution has been an important thread of research for several theoretical and\nexperimental studies. Loop formations are important phenomenological parameters\nin many important biological processes. Here we give a general method for\nfinding an exact analytical solution for the occurrence of looping of a long\npolymer chains in solution modeled by using a Smoluchowski-like equation with a\ndelocalized sink. The average rate constant for the delocalized sink is\nexplicitly expressed in terms of the corresponding rate constants for localized\nsinks with different initial conditions. Simple analytical expressions are\nprovided for average rate constant.\n", "  We construct the kinetic theory in ($1+2d$)-dimensional phase space and time\nwhen all abelian and nonabelian phase-space Berry curvatures are nonzero. Then\nwe calculate anomalous transports induced by the Berry curvatures on the basis\nof the kinetic theory. As an example, we study anomalous charge and spin\ntransports induced by the SU($2$) Berry curvatures. We also derive the\ntopological effective theory to reproduce the transports in insulators\ncalculated from the kinetic theory. Such an effective theory is given by the\nnonabelian phase space Chern-Simons theory.\n", "  The temperature coefficients for all the directions of the Nagoya muon\ntelescope were obtained. The zenith angular dependence of the temperature\ncoefficients was studied.\n", "  The Dragon-II linear induction accelerator is able to provide triple-pulse\nelectron beams with an adjustable pulse spacing at the minimum of 300 ns. As a\nmain determinant of the image quality, the X-ray spot size is usually quoted as\nan evaluation of the resolving power. The pinhole imaging method is applied to\nmeasure the two-dimensional spatial distribution of the triple-pulse X-ray\nsource, by which the azimuthal asymmetry of the source can be analyzed. The\nspot size of each pulse is characterized by both the full-width at half-maximum\nand the LANL definition. The weighted RMS radius at different sum ratios of\nphoton intensity is also calculated, which directly takes into account the\ncontribution of every single photon within the boundary of the spot.\n", "  As everyone knows who has opened a kitchen faucet, pipe flow is laminar at\nlow flow velocities and turbulent at high flow velocities. At intermediate\nvelocities there is a transition wherein plugs of laminar flow alternate along\nthe pipe with \"flashes\" of a type of fluctuating, non-laminar flow which\nremains poorly known. We show experimentally that the fluid friction of flash\nflow is diagnostic of turbulence. We also show that the statistics of flash\nflow are in keeping with Kolmogorov's phenomenological theory of turbulence (so\nthat, e.g., the energy spectra of both flash flow and turbulent flow satisfy\nsmall-scale universality). We conclude that transitional pipe flows are two-\nphase flows in which one phase is laminar and the other, carried by flashes, is\nturbulent in the sense of Kolmogorov.\n", "  Solar Orbiter is a joint ESA-NASA mission planed for launch in October 2018.\nThe science payload includes remote-sensing and in-situ instrumentation\ndesigned with the primary goal of understanding how the Sun creates and\ncontrols the heliosphere. The spacecraft will follow an elliptical orbit around\nthe Sun, with perihelion as close as 0.28 AU. During the late orbit phase the\norbital plane will reach inclinations above 30 degrees, allowing direct\nobservations of the solar polar regions. The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD)\nis an instrument suite consisting of several sensors measuring electrons,\nprotons and ions over a broad energy interval (2 keV to 15 MeV for electrons, 3\nkeV to 100 MeV for protons and few tens of keV/nuc to 450 MeV/nuc for ions),\nproviding composition, spectra, timing and anisotropy information. We present\nan overview of Solar Orbiter from the energetic particle perspective,\nsummarizing the capabilities of EPD and the opportunities that these new\nobservations will provide for understanding how energetic particles are\naccelerated during solar eruptions and how they propagate through the\nHeliosphere.\n", "  High-energy muons from air shower events detected in IceCube are selected\nusing state of the art machine learning algorithms. Attributes to distinguish a\nHE-muon event from the background of low-energy muon bundles are selected using\nthe mRMR algorithm and the events are classified by a random forest model. In a\nsubsequent analysis step the obtained sample is used to reconstruct the\natmospheric muon energy spectrum, using the unfolding software TRUEE. The\nreconstructed spectrum covers an energy range from $10^4\\,$GeV to $10^6\\,$GeV.\nThe general analysis scheme is presented, including results using the first\nyear of data taken with IceCube in its complete configuration with $86$\ninstrumented strings.\n", "  It has been recently demonstrated that textured closed surfaces which are\nmade out of perfect electric conductors (PECs) can mimic highly localized\nsurface plasmons (LSPs). Here, we propose an effective medium which can\naccurately model LSP resonances in a two-dimensional periodically decorated PEC\ncylinder. The accuracy of previous models is limited to structures with\ndeep-subwavelength and high number of grooves. However, we show that our model\ncan successfully predict the ultra-sharp LSP resonances which exist in\nstructures with relatively lower number of grooves. Such resonances are not\ncorrectly predictable with previous models that give some spurious resonances.\nThe success of the proposed model is indebted to the incorporation of an\neffective surface conductivity which is created at the interface of the\ncylinder and the homogeneous medium surrounding the structure. This surface\nconductivity models the effect of higher diffracted orders which are excited in\nthe periodic structure. The validity of the proposed model is verified by\nfull-wave simulations.\n", "  In 1615 Paolo A. Foscarini, a Carmelite monk lived in a monastery of south\nItaly near Cosenza (Calabria), published a Trattato which, at variance to what\nwas common at the time, has not been written in Latin, but in volgare, the\nancient Italian language. We are currently investigating the Trattato, and we\nfound strong evidences that, hidden in the Italian language of early\nseventeenth century, it represents, to our knowledge, the first systematic\nattempt to interpret something unknown at that time, as meteo-climate changes\nand their forecasting, in the scientific framework of environmental physical\neffects related to Sun-Atmosphere relationships.\n", "  The revival structures for the X_m exceptional orthogonal polynomials of the\nScarf I potential endowed with position-dependent effective mass is studied in\nthe context of the generalized Gazeau-Klauder coherent states. It is shown that\nin the case of the constant mass, the deduced coherent states mimic full and\nfractional revivals phenomena. However in the case of position-dependent\neffective mass, although full revivals take place during their time evolution,\nthere is no fractional revivals as defined in the common sense. These\nproperties are illustrated numerically by means of some specific profile mass\nfunctions, with and without singularities. We have also observed a close\nconnection between the coherence time {\\tau}_coh^m? and the mass parameter ?.\n", "  We discuss the side resonances of optically detected magnetic resonance in\ndiamond crystal and propose the new approach to the calculation of hyperfine\ninteraction in composed system, consisted of negatively charged\nnitrogen-vacancy NV- center and nearby 13C nuclear spin. Energy levels and spin\nstates are obtained by new method. The base of this method is the using of\ncomplete set of commuting operators. In zero magnetic field, predicted the\nexistence of metastable excited state.\n", "  Non-equilibrium and equilibrium thermodynamics of an interacting component of\na special-relativistic multi-component system is discussed by using an entropy\nidentity. The special case of the corresponding free component is considered.\n", "  Experimental demonstration of entanglement needs to have a precise control of\nexperimentalist over the system on which the measurements are performed as\nprescribed by an appropriate entanglement witness. To avoid such trust problem,\nrecently device-independent entanglement witnesses (\\emph{DIEW}s) for genuine\ntripartite entanglement have been proposed where witnesses are capable of\ntesting genuine entanglement without precise description of Hilbert space\ndimension and measured operators i.e apparatus are treated as black boxes. Here\nwe design a protocol for enhancing the possibility of identifying genuine\ntripartite entanglement in a device independent manner. We consider three mixed\ntripartite quantum states none of whose genuine entanglement can be detected by\napplying standard \\emph{DIEW}s, but their genuine tripartite entanglement can\nbe detected by applying the same when distributed in some suitable entanglement\nswapping network.\n", "  Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) theory predicts the abundances of the light\nelements D, $^3$He, $^4$He and $^7$Li produced in the early universe. The\nprimordial abundances of D and $^4$He inferred from observational data are in\ngood agreement with predictions, however, the BBN theory overestimates the\nprimordial $^7$Li abundance by about a factor of three. This is the so-called\n\"cosmological lithium problem\". Solutions to this problem using conventional\nastrophysics and nuclear physics have not been successful over the past few\ndecades, probably indicating the presence of new physics during the era of BBN.\nWe have investigated the impact on BBN predictions of adopting a generalized\ndistribution to describe the velocities of nucleons in the framework of Tsallis\nnon-extensive statistics. This generalized velocity distribution is\ncharacterized by a parameter $q$, and reduces to the usually assumed\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution for $q$ = 1. We find excellent agreement between\npredicted and observed primordial abundances of D, $^4$He and $^7$Li for\n$1.069\\leq q \\leq 1.082$, suggesting a possible new solution to the\ncosmological lithium problem.\n", "  We study the ferromagnetic layer thickness dependence of the\nvoltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) in gated CoFeB/MgO\nheterostructures with heavy metal underlayers. When the effective CoFeB\nthickness is below ~1 nm, the VCMA efficiency of Ta/CoFeB/MgO heterostructures\nconsiderably decreases with decreasing CoFeB thickness. We find that a high\norder phenomenological term used to describe the thickness dependence of the\nareal magnetic anisotropy energy can also account for the change in the areal\nVCMA efficiency. In this structure, the higher order term competes against the\ncommon interfacial VCMA, thereby reducing the efficiency at lower CoFeB\nthickness. The areal VCMA efficiency does not saturate even when the effective\nCoFeB thickness exceeds ~1 nm. We consider the higher order term is related to\nthe strain that develops at the CoFeB/MgO interface: as the average strain of\nthe CoFeB layer changes with its thickness, the electronic structure of the\nCoFeB/MgO interface varies leading to changes in areal magnetic anisotropy\nenergy and VCMA efficiency.\n", "  Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is an experimental technique to detect\nmaterial structures in the nanometer to micrometer range. The solution of the\nstructural model constructed from SANS strongly depends on the accuracy of the\nreduced data. The time-of-flight (TOF) SANS data are dependent on the\nwavelength of the pulsed neutron source. Therefore, data reduction must be\nhandled very carefully to transform measured neutron events into neutron\nscattering intensity. In this study, reduction algorithms for TOF SANS data are\ndeveloped and optimized using simulated data from a virtual neutron experiment.\nEach possible effect on the measured data is studied systematically, and\nsuitable corrections are performed to obtain high-quality data. This work will\nfacilitate scientific research and the instrument design at China Spallation\nNeutron Source.\n", "  High temperature (high-Tc) superconductors like cuprates have superior\ncritical current properties in magnetic fields over other superconductors.\nHowever, superconducting wires for high-field-magnet applications are still\ndominated by low-Tc Nb3Sn due probably to cost and processing issues. The\nrecent discovery of a second class of high-Tc materials, Fe-based\nsuperconductors, may provide another option for high-field-magnet wires. In\nparticular, AEFe2As2 (AE: Alkali earth elements, AE-122) is one of the best\ncandidates for high-field-magnet applications because of its high upper\ncritical field, Hc2, moderate Hc2 anisotropy, and intermediate Tc. Here we\nreport on in-field transport properties of P-doped BaFe2As2 (Ba-122) thin films\ngrown on technical substrates (i.e., biaxially textured oxides templates on\nmetal tapes) by pulsed laser deposition. The P-doped Ba-122 coated conductor\nsample exceeds a transport Jc of 10^5 A/cm^2 at 15 T for both major\ncrystallographic directions of the applied magnetic field, which is favourable\nfor practical applications. Our P-doped Ba-122 coated conductors show a\nsuperior in-field Jc over MgB2 and NbTi, and a comparable level to Nb3Sn above\n20 T. By analysing the E-J curves for determining Jc, a non-Ohmic linear\ndifferential signature is observed at low field due to flux flow along the\ngrain boundaries. However, grain boundaries work as flux pinning centres as\ndemonstrated by the pinning force analysis.\n", "  We observed the Galactic mixed-morphology supernova remnant G166.0+4.3 with\nSuzaku. The X-ray spectrum in the western part of the remnant is well\nrepresented by a one-component ionizing plasma model. The spectrum in the\nnortheastern region can be explained by two components. One is the Fe-rich\ncomponent with the electron temperature $kT_e = 0.87_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$ keV. The\nother is the recombining plasma component of lighter elements with $kT_e =\n0.46\\pm0.03$ keV, the initial temperature $kT_{init} = 3$ keV (fixed) and the\nionization parameter $n_et = (6.1_{-0.4}^{+0.5}) \\times 10^{11} \\rm cm^{-3} s$.\nAs the formation process of the recombining plasma, two scenarios, the\nrarefaction and thermal conduction, are considered. The former would not be\nfavored since we found the recombining plasma only in the northeastern region\nwhereas the latter would explain the origin of the RP. In the latter scenario,\nan RP is anticipated in a part of the remnant where blast waves are in contact\nwith cool dense gas. The emission measure suggests higher ambient gas density\nin the northeastern region. The morphology of the radio shell and a GeV\ngamma-ray emission also suggest a molecular cloud in the region.\n", "  Consider an abstract operator $L$ which acts on monomials $x^n$ according to\n$L x^n= \\lambda_n x^n + \\nu_n x^{n-2}$ for $\\lambda_n$ and $\\nu_n$ some\ncoefficients. Let $P_n(x)$ be eigenpolynomials of degree $n$ of $L$: $L P_n(x)\n= \\lambda_n P_n(x)$. A classification of all the cases for which the\npolynomials $P_n(x)$ are orthogonal is provided. A general derivation of the\nalgebras explaining the bispectrality of the polynomials is given. The\nresulting algebras prove to be central extensions of the Askey-Wilson algebra\nand its degenerate cases.\n", "  This letter proposes a new spoof surface plasmon transmission line (SSP-TL)\nusing capacitor loading techniques. This new SSP-TL features flexible and\nreconfigurable dispersion control and highly selective filtering performance\nwithout resorting to configuration change. Moreover, it requires much smaller\nline width than the conventional SSP-TLs for achieving a extremely slow wave\n(or a highly confined field), which is quite useful for a compact system. To\nillustrate the design principle, several examples are designed within the\nfrequency range of 2-8 GHz. Both numerical and experimental results are given\nin comparison with the conventional SSP-TL. It is demonstrated that the\nproposed technique provides a better performance in size reduction and\ndispersion reconfigurability.\n", "  In this work the one-parameter Fisher-R\\'enyi measure of complexity for\ngeneral $d$-dimensional probability distributions is introduced and its main\nanalytic properties are discussed. Then, this quantity is determined for the\nhydrogenic systems in terms of the quantum numbers of the quantum states and\nthe nuclear charge.\n", "  The mechanism by which the Earth's magnetic field is generated is thought to\nbe thermal convection in the metallic liquid iron core. Computational\nconsiderations previously restricted most numerical simulations to a regime\nwhere the diffusivities of momentum and electric current are roughly equal,\nleading to similar spectra for both velocities and magnetic fields. Here we\npresent results of a suite of self-consistent spherical shell computations with\nultra-low viscosities. The most Earth-like of our models (S4) has a twenty-fold\ndifference in the aforementioned diffusivities, leading to significant scale\nseparation between magnetic and velocity fields, the latter being dominated by\nsmall scales. This has repercussions for the leading force balance, which can\nbe magnetostrophic at large scales (with a major role played by the Lorentz\nforce) whereas small scales require a different balance. This is the so-called\nstrong field limit. Outside boundary layers, viscous forces have a magnitude\nwhich is about one thousandth of the Lorentz force. In this dynamo dissipation\nis almost exclusively Ohmic, as in the Earth, with convection inside the\nso-called tangent cylinder playing a crucial role. Our most extreme dynamo has\nsignificantly more magnetic energy than kinetic energy (as in the Earth). Our\nmodel suggests Ohmic dissipation in the Earth's core is as high as 10TW.\n", "  Aims. Clinical data indicating a heart rate (HR) target during rate control\ntherapy for permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) and assessing its eventual\nrelationship with reduced exercise tolerance are lacking. The present study\naims at investigating the impact of resting HR on the hemodynamic response to\nexercise in permanent AF patients by means of a computational cardiovascular\nmodel.\n  Methods. The AF lumped-parameter model was run to simulate resting (1\nMetabolic Equivalent of Task-MET) and various exercise conditions (4 METs:\nbrisk walking; 6 METs: skiing; 8 METs: running), considering different resting\nHR (70 bpm for the slower resting HR-SHR simulations, and 100 bpm for the\nhigher resting HR-HHR simulations). To compare relative variations of\ncardiovascular variables upon exertion, the variation comparative index (VCI) -\nthe absolute variation between the exercise and the resting values in SHR\nsimulations referred to the absolute variation in HHR simulations -was\ncalculated at each exercise grade (VCI4, VCI6 and VCI8).\n  Results. Pulmonary venous pressure underwent a greater increase in HHR\ncompared to SHR simulations (VCI4 = 0.71, VCI6 = 0.73 and VCI8 = 0.77), while\nfor systemic arterial pressure the opposite is true (VCI4 = 1.15, VCI6 = 1.36,\nVCI8 = 1.56).\n  Conclusions. The computational findings suggest that a slower, with respect\nto a higher resting HR, might be preferable in permanent AF patients, since\nduring exercise pulmonary venous pressure undergoes a slighter increase and\nsystemic blood pressure reveals a more appropriate increase.\n", "  To explain the unusual richness and compactness of the Abell 2744, we propose\na hypothesis that it may be a rich supercluster aligned along the sightline,\nand present a supporting evidence obtained numerically from the MultiDark\nPlanck 2 simulations with a linear box size of $1\\,h^{-1}$Gpc. Applying the\nfriends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm with a linkage length of $0.33$ to a sample\nof the cluster-size halos from the simulations, we identify the superclusters\nand investigate how many superclusters have filamentary branches that would\nappear to be similar to the Abell 2744 if the filamentary axis is aligned with\nthe sightline. Generating randomly a unit vector as a sightline at the position\nof the core member of each supercluster and projecting the positions of the\nmembers onto the plane perpendicular to the direction of the sightline, we\nmeasure two dimensional distances ($R_{2d}$) of the member halos from the core\nfor each supercluster. Defining a Abell 2744-like spuercluster as the one\nhaving a filamentary branch composed of eight or more members with $R_{2d}\\le\n1\\,$Mpc and masses comparable to those of the observed Abell 2744\nsubstructures, we find one Abell 2744-like supercluster at $z=0.3$ and two at\n$z=0$. Repeating the same analysis but with the data from the Big MultiDark\nPlanck simulations performed on a larger box of linear size of\n$2.5\\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the number of the Abell 2744-like superclusters\nat $z=0$ increases up to eighteen, among which three are found more massive\nthan $5\\times 10^{15}\\,M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  Symmetry algebras of Killing vector fields and conformal Killing vectors\nfields can be extended to Killing-Yano and conformal Killing-Yano superalgebras\nin constant curvature manifolds. By defining $\\mathbb{Z}$-gradations and\nfiltrations of these superalgebras, we show that the second cohomology groups\nof them are trivial and they cannot be deformed to other Lie superalgebras.\nThis shows the rigidity of Killing-Yano and conformal Killing-Yano\nsuperalgebras and reveals the fact that they correspond to geometric invariants\nof constant curvature manifolds. We discuss the structures and dimensions of\nthese superalgebras on $AdS$ spacetimes as examples.\n", "  A spherically symmetric collapsing scalar field model is discussed with a\ndissipative fluid which includes a heat flux. This vastly general matter\ndistribution is analyzed at the expense of a high degree of symmetry in the\nspace-time, that of conformal flatness and self-similarity. Indeed collapsing\nmodels terminating into a curvature singularity can be obtained. The formation\nof black holes or the occurrence of naked singularities depends on the initial\ncollapsing profiles.\n", "  We present a versatile setup for investigating the nanofluidic behavior of\nnanoparticles as a function of the gap distance between two confining surfaces.\nThe setup is designed as an open system which operates with small amounts of\ndispersion of $\\approx 20\\,\\mu$l, permits the use of coated and patterned\nsamples, and allows high-numerical-aperture microscopy access. Piezo elements\nenable 5D relative positioning of the surfaces. We achieve a parallelization of\nless than $1\\,$nm vertical deviation over a lateral distance of $10\\,\\mu$m. The\nvertical separation is tunable and detectable with subnanometer accuracy down\nto direct contact. At rest, the gap distance is stable on a nanometer level.\nUsing the tool we measure the vertical position termed height and the lateral\ndiffusion of $60\\,$nm charged Au nanospheres as a function of confinement\nbetween a glass and a polymer surface. Interferometric scattering detection\nresults in sub $10\\,$nm vertical and sub $5\\,$nm lateral particle localization\naccuracy, and a single particle illumination time below $40\\,\\mu$s. We measure\nthe height of the particles to be consistently above the gap center,\ncorresponding to a higher charge on the polymer substrate. In terms of\ndiffusion, we find a strong monotonic decay of the diffusion constant with\ndecreasing gap distance. This result cannot be explained by hydrodynamic\neffects, including the asymmetric vertical position of the particles in the\ngap. Instead we attribute it to an electroviscous effect. For strong\nconfinement of less than $120\\,$nm gap distance, we detect an onset of\nsub-diffusion which can be correlated to a motion of the particles along\nhigh-gap-distance paths.\n", "  The crystal structure of CeN was investigated up to pressures of 82 GPa,\nusing diamond anvil cell powder X-ray diffraction in two experiments with He\nand Si-oil as the pressure transmitting media. In contrast to previous reports,\nwe do not observe the B2 (CsCl type) structure at high pressure. Instead, the\nstructural phase transition, starting at 65 GPa, from the ambient rock salt B1\nstructure results in a distorted CsCl-like B10 structure, irrespective of the\npressure medium. Our result unambiguously confirms two recent density\nfunctional theory (DFT) studies predicting the B10 phase to be stable at these\npressures, rather than the B2 (CsCl type) phase previously reported. The B10\nstructure appears to approach the B2 structure as pressure is increased\nfurther, but DFT calculations indicate that an L1 0 structure (AuCu type) is\nenergetically favored.\n", "  Advances in the emerging field of coherent quantum feedback control (CQFC)\nhave led to the development of new capabilities in the areas of quantum control\nand quantum engineering, with a particular impact on the theory and\napplications of quantum optical networks. We consider a CQFC network consisting\nof two coupled optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) and study the squeezing\nspectrum of its output field. The performance of this network as a\nsqueezed-light source with desired spectral characteristics is optimized by\nsearching over the space of model parameters with experimentally motivated\nbounds. We use the QNET package to model the network's dynamics and the PyGMO\npackage of global optimization algorithms to maximize the degree of squeezing\nat a selected sideband frequency or the average degree of squeezing over a\nselected bandwidth. The use of global search methods is critical for\nidentifying the best possible performance of the CQFC network, especially for\nsqueezing at higher-frequency sidebands and higher bandwidths. The results\ndemonstrate that the CQFC network of two coupled OPOs makes it possible to vary\nthe squeezing spectrum, effectively utilize the available pump power, and\noverall significantly outperform a single OPO. Additionally, the Hessian\neigenvalue analysis shows that the squeezing generation performance of the\noptimally operated CQFC network is robust to small variations of phase\nparameters.\n", "  The bosonic nature of light leads to counter-intuitive bunching effects. We\ndescribe an experimentally testable effect in which a single photon is induced\nthrough a highly reflecting beamsplitter by a large amplitude coherent state,\nwith probability 1/e in the limit of large coherent state amplitude. We use\nthis effect to construct a viable implementation of the bare raising operator\non coherent states via conditional measurement, which succeeds with high\nprobability and fidelity even in the high amplitude limit.\n", "  We investigated the perpendicular exchange bias (PEB) switching from\nnegative- to positive-exchange bias state for Cr2O3/Pt/Co exchange coupling\nthin film system exhibiting positive exchange bias phenomena. By changing Pt\nspacer layer thickness or measurements temperature, we demonstrated the control\nof two kind of intermediate state of the switching; the double hysteresis loop\nindicating local, non-averaged PEB, and single hysteresis loop indicating\naveraged PEB. We proposed the way to control the lateral ferromagnetic domain\nthough the control of PEB magnitude.\n", "  We propose a method to solve the initial value problem for the ultradiscrete\nSomos-4 and Somos-5 equations by expressing terms in the equations as convex\npolygons and regarding max-plus algebras as those on polygons.\n", "  The spatial distribution of Cherenkov radiation from cascade showers\ngenerated by muons in water has been measured with Cherenkov water calorimeter\n(CWC) NEVOD. This result allowed to improve the techniques of treating cascade\nshowers with unknown axes by means of CWC response analysis. The techniques of\nselecting the events with high energy cascade showers and reconstructing their\nparameters are discussed. Preliminary results of measurements of the spectrum\nof cascade showers in the energy range 100 GeV - 20 TeV generated by cosmic ray\nmuons at large zenith angles and their comparison with expectation are\npresented.\n", "  A recent analysis by Pikovski et al. [Nat. Phys. 11, 668 (2015)] has\ntriggered interest in the question of how to include relativistic corrections\nin the quantum dynamics governing many-particle systems in a gravitational\nfield. Here we show how the center-of-mass motion of a quantum system subject\nto gravity can be derived more rigorously, addressing the ambiguous definition\nof relativistic center-of-mass coordinates. We further demonstrate that,\ncontrary to the prediction by Pikovski et al., external forces play a crucial\nrole in the relativistic coupling of internal and external degrees of freedom,\nresulting in a complete cancellation of the alleged coupling in Earth-bound\nlaboratories for systems supported against gravity by an external force. We\nconclude that the proposed decoherence effect is an effect of relative\nacceleration between quantum system and measurement device, rather than a\nuniversal effect in gravitational fields.\n", "  The contact between rough surfaces with adhesion is an extremely difficult\nproblem, and the approximation of the DMT theory (to neglect deformations due\nto attractive forces), originally developed for spherical contact of very small\nradius, are receiving some new interest. The DMT approximation leads to\nextremely large overestimate of the adhesive forces in the case of spherical\ncontact, except at pull-off. For cylindrical contact, the opposite trend is\nfound for larger contact areas. These findings suggest some caution in solving\nrough contacts with DMT models, unless the Tabor parameter is really low.\nFurther approximate models like that of Pastewka & Robbins' may be explained to\nwork only for a coincidence of error cancellation in their range of parameters.\n", "  A personal recollection of events that preceded the construction of\nSupergravity and of some subsequent developments.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of message passing for spatially coupled codes and,\nin particular, the set of density evolution equations that tracks the profile\nof decoding errors along the spatial direction of coupling. It is known that,\nfor suitable boundary conditions and after a transient phase, the error profile\nexhibits a \"solitonic behavior\". Namely, a uniquely-shaped wavelike solution\ndevelops, that propagates with constant velocity. Under this assumption we\nderive an analytical formula for the velocity in the framework of a continuum\nlimit of the spatially coupled system. The general formalism is developed for\nspatially coupled low-density parity-check codes on general binary memoryless\nsymmetric channels which form the main system of interest in this work. We\napply the formula for special channels and illustrate that it matches the\ndirect numerical evaluation of the velocity for a wide range of noise values. A\npossible application of the velocity formula to the evaluation of finite size\nscaling law parameters is also discussed. We conduct a similar analysis for\ngeneral scalar systems and illustrate the findings with applications to\ncompressive sensing and generalized low-density parity-check codes on the\nbinary erasure or binary symmetric channels.\n", "  Recently, Hoang et al. (arXiv:1608.05284) reported analysis of the\ninteraction of relativistic spacecrafts with interstellar medium (ISM, i.e. gas\natoms and dust particles) relevant for the Breakthrough starshot initiative\n(https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3). The main conclusion is that\ndust pose much greater threat to the starship than gas atoms. However, analysis\nused to treat interaction of the spaceship with gas atoms is based on the\nincorrect use of the Szenes model. Only by proper treatment of the Szenes model\ncan be found if the conclusion remains valid - or not. In the following, the\nmain comments we have raised about the paper are listed. Present text is based\non the v2 version of the above mentioned paper [0] that was accepted for\npublication in Astophysical Journal.\n", "  We show that gyrotropic structures with balanced gain and loss that respect\nanti-linear symmetries exhibit a giant non-reciprocity at the so-called exact\nphase where the eigenfrequencies of the isolated non-Hermitian set-up are real.\nThe effect occurs in a parameter domain near an exceptional point (EP)\ndegeneracy, where mode-orthogonality collapses. The theoretical predictions are\nconfirmed numerically in the microwave domain, where a non-reciprocal transport\nabove 90dB is demonstrated, and are further verified using lump-circuitry\nmodeling. The analysis allows us to speculate the universal nature of the\nphenomenon for any wave system where EP and gyrotropy can co-exist.\n", "  We represent noise strength analysis of Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars (AXPs) 4U\n0142+61, 1RXS J170849.9-400910, 1E 1841-045, 1E 2259+586 and Soft Gamma\nRepeaters (SGRs) SGR J1833-0832, SWIFT J1822.3-1606 and SWIFT J1834.9-0846\ntogether with the X-Ray binaries GX 1+4 and 4U 1907+09 for comparison with\naccreting sources. Using our timing solutions, we extracted residuals of pulse\narrival times after removal of spin down trends and we calculated assoicated\nnoise strength of each source. Our preliminary results indicate that the noise\nstrength is scaling up with spin-down rate. This indicates that, increase in\nspin-down rate leads to more torque noise on the magnetars. In addition, we\npresent our analysis with Bayesian statistics on the previously reported\ntransient QPO feature of 4U 1907+09.\n", "  In this contribution, it is our aim to show that the Chern-Simons terms of\nmodified gravity can be understood as generated by the addition of a\n3-dimensional algebraic manifold to an initial 11-dimensional space-time\nmanifold; this builds up an 11+3-dimensional space-time. In this system,\nfirstly, some fields living in the bulk join the fields that live on the\n11-dimensional manifold, so that the rank of the gauge fields exceeds the\ndimension of the algebra; consequently, there emerges an anomaly. To solve this\nproblem, another 11-dimensional manifold is included in the 11 +3-dimensional\nspace-time, and it interacts with the initial manifold by exchanging\nChern-Simons fields. This mechanism is able to remove the anomaly. Chern-Simons\nterms actually produce an extra manifold between the pair of 11-dimensional\nmanifolds of the 11+3-space-time. Summing up over the topology of both the\n11-dimensional manifolds and the topology of the exchanged Chern-Simons\nmanifold in the bulk , we conclude that the total topology shrinks to one,\nwhich is in agreement with the main idea of the Big Bang theory.\n", "  Foundations of a new projection-based model reduction approach for convection\ndominated nonlinear fluid flows are summarized. In this method the evolution of\nthe flow is approximated in the Lagrangian frame of reference. Global basis\nfunctions are used to approximate both the state and the position of the\nLagrangian computational domain. It is demonstrated that in this framework,\ncertain wave-like solutions exhibit low-rank structure and thus, can be\nefficiently compressed using relatively few global basis. The proposed approach\nis successfully demonstrated for the reduction of several simple but\nrepresentative problems.\n", "  In this article, we propose and numerically analyze an all dielectric biaxial\nmetamaterial [ADBM] constructed by multilayer pattering of a sub-wavelength\nridge array of Silicon and a flat SiO2 layer. The proposed ADBM can support\nDyakonov Surface Waves [DSWs] with infinite propagation length which can\npropagate in a wide angular domain. Though natural uniaxial and biaxial\nmaterials and also nanowire all dielectric metamaterials can also support DSWs,\nthe angular existence domain [AED] is limited to a very narrow range. Our\nproposed ADBM can support can overcome this limitation and it can achieve\nhigher AED than any all dielectric structures reported in literature till date.\nOur proposed ADBM can be easily fabricated by the current fabrication\ntechnology. Due to its lossless nature, it may find substantial applications in\noptical sensing, optical interconnects, wave-guiding, solar energy harvesting\netc.\n", "  Plasmonic metasurfaces have been employed for tuning and controlling light\nenabling various novel applications. Their appeal is enhanced with the\nincorporation of an active element with the metasurfaces paving the way for\ndynamic control. In this letter, we realize a dynamic polarization state\ngenerator using graphene-integrated anisotropic metasurface (GIAM), where a\nlinear incidence polarization is controllably converted into an elliptical one.\nThe anisotropic metasurface leads to an intrinsic polarization conversion when\nilluminated with non-orthogonal incident polarization. Additionally, the\nsingle-layer graphene allows us to tune the phase and intensity of the\nreflected light on the application of a gate voltage, enabling dynamic\npolarization control. The stokes polarization parameters of the reflected light\nare measured using rotating polarizer method and it is demonstrated that a\nlarge change in the ellipticity as well as orientation angle can be induced by\nthis device. We also provide experimental evidence that the titl angle can\nchange independent of the ellipticity going from positive values to nearly zero\nto negative values while ellipticity is constant.\n", "  A general quantum thermodynamics network is composed of thermal devices\nconnected to the environments through quantum wires. The coupling between the\ndevices and the wires may introduce additional decay channels which modify the\nsystem performance with respect to the directly-coupled device. We analyze this\neffect in a quantum three-level device connected to a heat bath or to a work\nsource through a two-level wire. The steady state heat currents are decomposed\ninto the contributions of the set of simple circuits in the graph representing\nthe master equation. Each circuit is associated with a mechanism in the device\noperation and the system performance can be described by a small number of\ncircuit representatives of those mechanisms. Although in the limit of weak\ncoupling between the device and the wire the new irreversible contributions can\nbecome small, they prevent the system from reaching the Carnot efficiency.\n", "  The monitoring of sleep patterns without patient's inconvenience or\ninvolvement of a medical specialist is a clinical question of significant\nimportance. To this end, we propose an automatic sleep stage monitoring system\nbased on an affordable, unobtrusive, discreet, and long-term wearable in-ear\nsensor for recording the Electroencephalogram (ear-EEG). The selected features\nfor sleep pattern classification from a single ear-EEG channel include the\nspectral edge frequency (SEF) and multi- scale fuzzy entropy (MSFE), a\nstructural complexity feature. In this preliminary study, the manually scored\nhypnograms from simultaneous scalp-EEG and ear-EEG recordings of four subjects\nare used as labels for two analysis scenarios: 1) classification of ear-EEG\nhypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings and 2) prediction of scalp-EEG\nhypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings. We consider both 2-class and 4-class\nsleep scoring, with the achieved accuracies ranging from 78.5 % to 95.2 % for\near-EEG labels predicted from ear-EEG, and 76.8 % to 91.8 % for scalp-EEG\nlabels predicted from ear-EEG. The corresponding kappa coefficients, which\nrange from 0.64 to 0.83 for Scenario 1 and from 0.65 to 0.80 for Scenario 2,\nindicate a Substantial to Almost Perfect agreement, thus proving the\nfeasibility of in-ear sensing for sleep monitoring in the community.\n", "  We study the nucleation of GaN islands grown by plasma-assisted\nmolecular-beam epitaxy on AlN(0001) in a Stranski-Krastanov mode. In\nparticular, we assess the variation of their height and density as a function\nof GaN coverage. We show that the GaN growth passes four stages: initially, the\ngrowth is layer-by-layer; subsequently, two-dimensional precursor islands form,\nwhich transform into genuine three-dimensional islands. During the latter\nstage, island height and density increase with GaN coverage until the density\nsaturates. During further GaN growth, the density remains constant and a\nbimodal height distribution appears. The variation of island height and density\nas a function of substrate temperature is discussed in the framework of an\nequilibrium model for Stranski-Krastanov growth.\n", "  Electrical spin injection from the Heusler alloy Co_2MnGe into a p-i-n\nAl_0.1Ga_0.9As/GaAs light emitting diode is demonstrated. A maximum\nsteady-state spin polarization of approximately 13% at 2 K is measured in two\ntypes of heterostructures. The injected spin polarization at 2 K is calculated\nto be 27% based on a calibration of the spin detector using Hanle effect\nmeasurements. Although the dependence on electrical bias conditions is\nqualitatively similar to Fe-based spin injection devices of the same design,\nthe spin polarization injected from Co_2MnGe decays more rapidly with\nincreasing temperature.\n", "  Electrical spin injection from ferromagnetic $\\delta$-MnGa into an (Al,Ga)As\np-i-n light emitting diode (LED) is demonstrated. The $\\delta$-MnGa layers show\nstrong perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy, enabling detection of spin\ninjection at remanence without an applied magnetic field. The bias and\ntemperature dependence of the spin injection are found to be qualitatively\nsimilar to Fe-based spin LED devices. A Hanle effect is observed and\ndemonstrates complete depolarization of spins in the semiconductor in a\ntransverse magnetic field.\n"]}
